GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 

As most of you, I suppose, are aware, I have been undergoing a 
siege of very serious illness for the last five months. It would be im- 
possible for me, on this occasion, to occupy sufficient time to express the 
desires of my heart and my feelings, as I would desire to express them 
to you, but 1 felt that it was my duty, if possible, to be present and take 
some little part this morning in the opening session of this eighty-ninth 
Semi-annual Conference of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints. ' 

CLEAR OF MIND THOUGH WEAK IN BODY 

For more than seventy years I have been a worker in this cause 
with you and your fathers and progenitors, pioneers who broke the way 
into these valleys of the mountains; and my heart is just as firmly 
set with you today as it ever has been. Although somewhat weakened 
in body, my mind is clear with reference to my duty, and with reference 
to the duties and responsibilities that rest upon the Latter-day Saints ; 
and I am ever anxious for the progress of the work of the Lord, for the 
prosperity of the people of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints throughout the world. I am as anxious as I ever have been, and 
as earnest in my desires that Zion shall prosper, -and that the Lord shall 
favor his people and magnify them in his sight, and in the knowledge 
and understanding of the intelligent people of all the world. 

CONTINUOUS COMMUNICATION WITH THE SPIRIT OF THE LORD 

I will not, I dare not, attempt to enter upon many things that are 
resting upon my mind this morning, and I shall postpone until some 
future time, the Lord being willing, my attempt to tell you some of the 
things that are in my mind, and that dwell in my heart. I have not lived 
alone these five months. I have dwelt in the spirit of prayer, of suppli- 
cation, of faith and of determination ; and I have had my communica- 
tion with the Spirit of the Lord continuously ; and I am glad to say to you, 
my brethren and sisters, that it is a happy meeting this morning for me 
to have the privilege of joining with you in the opening of this eighty- 
ninth Semi-annual Conference of the Church. 

God Almighty bless you and those who shall address you, and Pres- 
ident Lund, who will continue in charge of the services, in my absence, 
at least ; and all who take part in the services of this conference, that you 
may have a time of rejoicing and of great reward. 

SOME CURRENT HISTORY. 

I have drawn a few items, by request, from the current events of the 
Church and its history, that I think will be interesting to be read by our 
people in the Deseret News, this evening, and for thi f s reason I will sub- 
mit these items to the clerk to be handed over to the Deseret News for 
publication. 

Hoping that you will pardon my effort to say anything under so un- 
favorable circumstances to myself, I bless you in the name of the Lord 



PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 3 

Jesus Christ, and invoke his favor and blessing and protection upon you 
now and forever. Amen. 

At the close of President Smith's remarks the organist struck a chord 
of "We thank thee, O God, for a prophet." The congregation arose in 
unison, and without announcement, and under strong emotion, sang that 
sacred song so dear to the Saints. 

The following are the items of current history referred to in Presi- 
dent Smith's remarks : 

TITHING 

We have been blessed with a most abundant harvest in all the stakes 
and wards of the Church. The Lord has greatly blessed the people, and 
it is gratifying to note that our tithing records show an increase in tithing 
paid for the first nine months of this year over the corresponding- months 
of 1917. 

PRIESTHOOD ACTIVITIES 

In consequence of so many of our young men being drafted into the 
war, the activities of our quorums of the priesthood, especially of the 
Elders, Priests and Teachers quorums, are very much impaired. In some 
wards nearly every priest and teacher of draft age is in the war. The 
quorums have been seriously depleted, and a corresponding effect has 
also been felt in the Sunday School and Y. M. M. I. A. 

MISSIONARY WORK 

The extension of the draft age has also affected our missionary work, 
and we are not now sending missionaries out who are within the draft age. 

RELIEF SOCIETY WHEAT 

Our Relief Societies were called on, just prior to harvest time of 
this year, to supply the government with all the wheat they had stored 
up for years. Of course, they promptly and loyally complied with the 
request, and the wheat has been taken over by the government and used 
to help meet the demand made upon this country by our allies. The 
money received for this wheat is a trust fund, and should be kept in the 
banks, and when the proper time arrives, used to purchase wheat to be 
saved up against another time of need. The policy inaugurated by the 
leaders of the Church years ago with reference to this matter is a sound 
policy and should be continued. 

TEMPLES 

The Hawaiian temple is now nearing completion. Substantial prog- 
ress is being made with the Cardston temple. The building is enclosed, 
and the finishing work now in process. 

MILITARY SERVICE 

We believe that our brethren who have answered the call of their 
Country and entered the war should have their names on record in the 
Church, and Bishops should enter every member of their ward who is in 



4 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 

the military service of the United States or its allies on the tithing record, 
as this record is a roll of honor. Further details will be given by the 
Presiding Bishopric. 

REORGANIZATION OF THE PRESIDING BISHOPRIC 

Bishop Orrin P. Miller, first counselor to Presiding Bishop C. W. 
Nibley, passed away on July 7, 1918, after a long and severe illness. 
On July 18, Bishop David A. Smith was set apart as first counselor, and 
Elder John Wells ordained a Bishop and set apart as second counselor to 
Presiding Bishop C. W. Nibley. 

DEATHS 

Since our last conference Bishop William Fairbourn, of Crescent 
Ward, Jordan stake, has passed away ; and Marion A. Woolley, of Kanab 
stake, and George E. Giles, of Provo, Utah, laboring in the Australian 
and Samoan mission fields respectively, also passed away. 

NEW WARDS ORGANIZED 

The following new wards have been organized since our last con- 
ference : 

Redcliffe, Utah, Strawberry and Alterra wards, in Duchesne stake; 
Veyo and Central, in St. George stake; Wandamere, in Granite stake; 
Lark, in Jordan stake; Topaz, in Portneuf stake, and Pegram Branch 
in Montpelier stake. 

PRESIDENT ANTHON H. LUND. 

I believe I can answer for all present that we are most happy to have 
the privilege to see our beloved President with us again. I know that 
he has the prayers of his people who are asking the Lord to restore him, 
to strengthen him and to relieve him of his sickness, and I hope that the 
prayers of the Saints will be heard in his behalf, that we may again see 
him able to be with us, and again sit under his voice and hear his inspired 
instructions to us. The Lord bless President Smith and make him well. 

ZION IS PROSPERING 

I am glad this morning to see this sea of faces beaming with joy at 
beholding our President in the conference, and I believe that the Lord will 
bless his servants who shall address us this day. We can bring you the 
glad tidings that Zion is prospering, that the work is going forward, and, 
I believe that the Saints are making headway, both spiritually and tem- 
porally. 

I received a few notes from Brother Wells, of the Presiding Bishop- 
ric. He tells us there has been an increase in the births, blessings and bap- ' 
tisms in the stakes of Zion compared with the corresponding period of 
the previous year. A larger number of recommends for the temples have 
been issued for the first six months of this year than in the same length 
of time of any previous year. During the six months ending June 30, 



PRESIDENT ANTHON H. LUND

there were performed in the temples 119,166 baptisms, and 119,400 
endowments, sealings and other ordinances. 

We are pleased to see the people flocking to the temples. We know 
that they do this for an unselfish purpose. They go there to labor for 
others, and spend their means to get to the temples, and yet I believe that 
all who attend to this work feel that they are paid in the present, though 
there will be a great reward for them in the future, when they shall meet 
their ancestors and friends, and be able to tell them what they have done 
for them in the temples. In working for others in the temples they them- 
selves get strengthened in their faith. They feel that thy are indeed help- 
ers in the great work of salvation. Our Redeemer is the Author of the 
plan of salvation, he has given his life for us all, and has accomplished and 
finished the work given him by his Father for the redemption of all his 
children who are willing to believe in him as the Savior of the world. His 
is the only name given whereby salvation can be obtained. We are helping 
in this great work by doing for others that which they cannot do for them- 
selves in their present condition. Millions of spirits who have occupied 
tabernacles upon the earth have not had the opportunity of hearing the 
voice of the servants of God, and have not even heard the name of Jesus 
Christ ; but the plan of salvation, as framed in the eternal councils, was so 
broad that it provides the means of redemption for every soul that has 
lived or shall live upon this earth, who will accept its conditions. 

The subject of doing work for the dead was revealed very early to 
the Prophet Joseph. In the first visit made to him by the angel, when 
Joseph was about eighteen years old, the angel explained the scriptures 
to him and quoted the last chapter in the Old Testament, where Malachi 
refers to the coming of Elijah who should turn the hearts of the fathers 
to the children, and the children's hearts to the fathers. Joseph may not 
have fully understood it then, but before his death the spirit worked upon 
him to make things plain, and to give the keys of this great principle to 
his fellow laborers, the apostles. And he was so impressed with the work 
that he calls it the "most glorious of all subjects belonging to the everlast- 
ing gospel." So I am glad to state to you that there has been progress 
in this matter ; that the Saints are influenced by the spirit of salvation for 
the dead, and are accomplishing a great work in the temples. 

ATTENDANCE AT SACRAMENT MEETINGS 

There has been a larger attendance at sacrament meetings in the six 
months ending June 30, than during any other similar period since reports 
were kept. We are pleased to hear this, and we want to say to the Latter- 
day Saints that none of them should be satisfied to stay at home and not 
attend the sacrament meetings. Don't feel that you can get along just as 
well without as with attendance at these meetings. It is a great loss to 
those who stay away. You go there to worship God, to be instructed in 
his ways, and to renew your covenants with him. In partaking of the 
sacrament you make the promise that you will take upon you the name of 
the Son of God, that you will always remember him and -keep his com- 
mandments which he has given you, and then the promise is that you 



6 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



will have his Spirit to be with you. You cannot progress spiritually if you 
do not partake of these holy things, and doing it will strengthen and in- 
spire you during the week days; and, therefore, let us all feel that it is 
our duty to attend sacrament meetings and thereby help to build up one 
another in our holy faith. 

PRIESTHOOD MEETING AND MILITARY SERVICE ' 

The attendance at the weekly priesthood meetings has fallen off, in 
consequence of a large number being in military service. Many of our 
boys who hold the priesthood have been called to go in defense of our 
Country. Willingly they have accepted the call, and, I believe that they 
will do honor to their parents by noble devotion to the cause of their 
Country, by their righteous living, and by the example they will show to 
others. We pray that God will be with them, shield and protect them, 
and that we may have the joy to see them come back pure and good, 
as they left us. 

There are fifty-six thousand holding the priesthood. Of these there 
are fifteen thousand who are not able to do much active labor, mostly on 
account of 'age, infirmity or sickness, or by reason of their occupation or 
absence from home on military service. 

I thought these few items would be interesting to us all. They were 
just handed to me. 

THE WORK IN THE MISSIONS 

Our missionary work, brethren and sisters, is still progressing. In the 
different missions of the United States, a good work is being done. We 
still have a goodly number laboring in these missions, and they are meet- 
ing with success and performing their labors to the satisfaction of their 
presidents. In the neutral countries, in Europe, we are hindered some- 
what in keeping up the usual number of missionaries. At present we 
have very few in the Scandinavian countries and in Holland, and we 
haven't any over in Turkey. The elders fyave been withdrawn from there 
on account of the unsafety of strangers, and especially Americans, in that 
country. In Norway, Denmark, and Sweden, we have but thirteen mis- 
sionaries left, where we used to have a hundred or more. Much work, 
therefore, is resting upon these few men, and most of them have been 
longer than usual in the missionary field. The expenses now are double 
what they used to be, and this makes it quite hard for them to meet the 
cost of living, but they are willing to do what they can to keep up the 
work. At present the governments of these countries do not want aliens 
to come and take up residence with them. I suppose the reason for this is 
mostly of an economic nature. They want to save provisions at home, and 
not have aliens come from other countries to settle there and thus increase 
their burdens. I do not think it is on account of their being "Mormons" 
that our elders cannot be admitted. I believe they are just as free to come 
as other people, but when .one comes into a city in Norway, he is only 
allowed to stay two or three days, and then he must travel further. This 
would prevent our missionaries from taking charge of branches and con- 



PRESIDENT ANTHON H. LUND

ferences. We hope that some arrangement can be made whereby a few 
experienced elders may be permitted to go there and take charge of the 
work. We can use quite a number of our local men there to labor in the 
work, but very few of them are able to support themselves like our mis- 
sionaries from home do, hence we are limited in using many of them, but 
the work will go ahead. I remember the time when we had no elders from 
Zion laboring with us in Scandinavia, and yet the work progressed. The 
Lord cannot be stayed in carrying out his purposes. 

In Australia and New Zealand we were prohibited from sending more 
elders there, but this has been modified. The matter has been taken up in 
Washington with the ambassadors from those countries, and they have 
given us permission to send elders to replace those who are released, so 
that we can keep up the work on that side of the globe. On the islands 
of the sea we have not been hindered much, and the work is progressing 
there. Our elders who go there are a blessing to the natives, not only in 
preaching and in spiritual matters, but also in temporal things. For in- 
stance, in Tahiti, at the pearl-fishing season, it has been the custom for 
the natives to get their supplies from the merchants who allow them to 
keep an open account. The natives are not careful in their buying and 
often find their indebtedness far in excess of their wages, and therefore 
are under the necessity of working another season to pay the bills due their 
creditors, and then again obtain their supplies on credit. President Ern- 
est Rossiter, who presides over the members of our Church in Tahiti, and 
some of the elders laboring there, now accompany those of our people who 
are engaged in diving for the pearl oysters. They encourage the natives 
not to run in debt, and they help them to get their supplies at wholesale 
rates. The consequence has been that when the fishing season is over they 
draw their wages and are no longer in the bondage of debt. The elders 
hold meetings and encourage their members to resist temptations and live 
lives of Latter-day Saints. Workers, not members of the Church, see the 
beneficial results of this move and are trying to follow the same course. 
The same way on other islands, the Elders are trying to teach the people 
a better way of living, temporally as well as spiritually. 

THE TEMPLE BLOCK MISSION 

We have one of the best mission fields right here on this temple block 
where Brother Goddard and his assistants are laboring diligently in ex- 
plaining the principles to tourists who come here to see what the "'Mor- 
mons" have done and learn what they believe. They ask many questions, 
which guides are always ready to answer in explanation of our belief, and 
many of them go away without the prejudice against us which they enter- 
tained when they came. We have found the effect of this temple block 
service in the different missions. When our elders chance to enter the 
homes of these visitors they have invited them in, treated them kindly, and 
told them what a splendid time they had in Salt Lake City, and how 
pleased they were to hear the gospel explained to them by our guides. In 
this tabernacle we have recitals during the summer. Brother McClellan 
and his assistant organists are doing a splendid work here. People come 



8 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



and listen to the great organ, they hear the beautiful music, and many have 
been moved even to tears. So that when they go away they cannot be- 
lieve the stories that the "Mormons" are such an ignorant, uncultured 
people as some have tried to portray them. They remember with pleas- 
ure what has been done for them. 

LABORS OF LADY MISSIONARIES 

In the mission fields, now that so many of our young men have had 
to come home and go into the army, we have been assisted very much by 
our young women, who have gone out and filled missions. They also are 
successful in tracting, in meeting the people and getting into their homes. 
Those who may be afraid of the elders, cannot believe that these innocent 
girls can come for any purpose of deceiving, and they are willing to listen 
to them, and many have been brought to believe in the truth by the simple 
testimonies borne by these young women who have accepted missions. 
The Lord bless them and make them successful in their labors. 

i 

OUR DUTY IN WARNING AND HELPING TO WARN 

This duty of informing the world concerning our belief and warning 
them of what is coming, rests upon the Latter-day Saints. If you read 
the 33rd chapter of Ezekiel, you can see what the Lord says against those 
who are watchmen and not performing their duties. If the people are 
warned and do not heed the warning, the Lord says their blood will be 
upon themselves, but if they are not warned and the watchman has been 
careless in failing to give them the warning, the blood will be on his skirts. 
Now, we elders of Israel do not want to incur any blame or punishment 
because of neglect of duties in regard to informing' the w r orld. We can- 
not send our young men. We will be obliged therefore to call on our 
experienced elders, many of whom have performed excellent missions 
before. When we ask them to go today we find in some cases that their 
circumstances are such that they cannot go. But we have a great many 
who have not been on missions, and perhaps are not suitable for mission- 
ary life, but who could do their duty by helping some of these able and 
experienced men to go and preach the gospel. It would not cost much ; 
it is a good way of using the mammon of unrighteousness to make friends 
for us hereafter, as alluded to by Jesus. Why, in early days of the Church 
when we sent men out as missionaries, they went without purse or scrip. 
I remember two elders who were sent to a large city in Norway ; one was a 
g'ood speaker, the other was not much of a speaker, but he was a good 
tailor. He took work and he supported his fellow missionary, and they 
laid the foundation of a splendid branch, and so wherever the elders were 
sent they were willing to work for the furtherance of the cause, they 
would labor with their hands and give all they made to help in this work. 
However, we do not go so far as this at home. Many of our brethren 
who have been blessed temporally would feel more blessed if they would 
use some of their means to have a good elder go on. a mission and labor 
where we are under the necessity of sending missionaries. 



PRESIDENT ANTHON H. LUND 9 

THE ADVATAGES AND BLESSINGS OF CHURCH GATHERINGS 

Now, brethren, I am afraid my voice doesn't reach you all. I am glad 
to see this congregation. I know that you came to learn more of the 
ways of the Lord and to worship him. What a splendid thing it was that ■ 
the Lord in the very opening revelation in April, 1830, gave us the com- 
mand, that we should meet in conference every three months, or at times 
appointed. We come together, we meet friends, we talk over past times ; 
those who are a little wayward get strengthened and encouraged to take 
a right course, and the Saints rejoice in learning what the Church is do- 
ing, and to know that they are in accord with the spirit of the work. 

When the tribes of Israel rebelled in the days of Rehoboam they fol- 
lowed Jeroboam, who led them into idolatry. A few years before, they had 
helped to build that beautiful temple, Solomon's temple, and they had re- 
joiced in going there. It was a command of God that they should go 
every year and make an offering in the temple of the Lord. Jeroboam 
j-ealized what that meant. If his subjects should go to Jerusalem, they 
would soon go back again and join with the two tribes in their worship, 
and his power over them would be lost, so he established places of wor- 
ship on mountains in his own country to keep them away from the temple, 
of God in Jerusalem. 

Now, we love to see our people come here to our conferences, and we 
know that they feel blessed in coming, and that when they return home 
the spirit of the conference will follow them. 

God bless you, brethren and sisters, help us to be faithful and true in 
our covenants with the Lord, and to so live that when life is ended we 
may feel that we have done the best we have understood, I ask in the 
name of Jesus. Amen. 

PRESIDENT CHARLES W. PENROSE. 

It would be .very difficult for me, and I believe for any one of our 
brethren to express the joy and gratitude which well up in our hearts 
this morning in beholding the form and features and hearing the voice 
of our beloved president. 

THE PEOPLE'S LOVE FOR PRESIDENT SMITH 

We have sympathized with him in his affliction, and have earnestly 
desired that he might be touched by the healing power of God, so that 
his days might be prolonged on the earth, and that he might be spared 
to be with us again to give us instructions, to preside over the Church 
and all its affairs, as he has done so well in the past ; and the Lord 
has heard our prayers, to the extent, at least, that he is present with us 
this morning. This has been the desire of the Latter-day Saints every- 
where, I believe also, the desire of many people who are not members 
of our Church. They have learned to love and respect President Smith, 
and I have heard from many of them the earnest wish that he might 



10 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



fully recover. Wc value him not only as a man clothed upon with the 
Holy Priesthood and holding the keys of the kingdom of God on the 
earth, but we love him for himself ; and those of us who have been with 
him so much in the past and know of his labors from boyhood up to 
the present time, feel very thankful this morning to God that he is 
with us, and hope and desire that his days may be still prolonged, that 
he may be able to accomplish all that he has in his heart to do, and 
that we may be blessed with his presence and teachings. 

A REPRESENTATIVE CONGREGATION 

This congregation this morning and those who will be here during 
the sessions of this conference are representative people. We represent 
the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in all the world. We 
have people here from all the stakes of Zion, from the various missions 
abroad, acting in different capacities where they dwell, and they are here 
to represent those among whom they live as well as being present them- 
selves. And this is a very important gathering. I hope we will all hear 
with prayerful hearts and recipient souls, so that we may receive the word 
of the Lord through our faith, and that what we hear we may remember, 
and that the spirit of it, if not the actual words, may be carried to every 
part of the Church where these representative people reside. 

OUR WORK DIFFERENT FROM OTHER CHURCH ORGANIZATIONS 

This work in which we are engaged is altogether different in many 
respects from any other religious organization in the world. This we 
should feel in our hearts, and the testimony we have received concern- 
ing it should have weight upon our minds. Every person who has been 
baptized into this Church and confirmed as a member, and especially those 
who have been ordained to any office in the priesthood, have a mission 
to perform in the world. This gospel is to be sent to every nation and 
kindred and tongue- and people. This was the voice of the angel that 
came to the Prophet Joseph in his boyhood in revealing the place where 
the plates were, the language of which has been translated into English 
and called the Book of Mormon. We have the gospel to present to the 
world, to all nations, to every class and kind of people, to the Christian 
world and to the heathen world, to the preachers as well as to the people. 
While we do not despise the teachings of good men in the various Chris- 
tian sects or in the various sects in heathendom, when they endeavor to 
enlighten the minds of mankind, when they desire to benefit the people, 
but feel in our hearts to bless them so far as they are sincere and earnest 
in their work; at the same time, we must not lose sight of the fact that 
this organization to which we belong, of which we are members and 
should be active workers in, is the only Church upon the face of earth 
with which the Lord has declared he is pleased, well pleased, when the 
people do right, that this is the only Church of Jesus Christ on the face 
of the earth. There could not be a dozen or even two different churches 
of Christ. There could not be two different religions from God, the 



PRESIDENT CHARLES W. PENROSE

Father. Our common sense tells us this, if there' were no particular reve- 
lations to that effect. 

THE MISSION OF THE CHURCH 

We should understand that we are called of God to be sei ✓ants of 
the Lord Jesus Christ, to follow in his footsteps as far as we are able to 
do so; that we should embody his character, that we should observe the 
law of obedience to God as he observed it ; understand that we came 
here not to do our own will unless it be like God's will, in conformity 
therewith, in harmony with him and his purposes ; that we came here 
for this purpose, to learn the ways of God and to walk in the path that 
he marks out for us. And the Church is organized to that end, to carry 
and to send forth the gospel of Jesus Christ, the gospel of salvation, to 
all peoples upon the face, of the earth, to every country, to the islands 
of the sea, the continents, and every part of this globe where there are 
people dwelling. This is our mission, and those of us who cannot go 
there should do everything in our power with all our hearts to send the 
gospel there ; and, as President Lund has intimated to us this morning, 
when able men, men who are able to carry this gospel and to preach it in 
plainness, by authority and in the power of God, are not able financially 
to perform this duty, they should be aided by their brethren and sisters 
at home. We have proven how easy it is comparatiyely to raise funds 
for different purposes, worthy purposes. Israel has responded to the call 
of the Nation. This is right, part of our duty, but it just shows to us 
what we can do when we get the spirit of a work; and there are means 
enough that can be raised from the ranks of Israel to send just as many 
elders as we are able to send in these times at any rate, abroad in the 
world and sustain them or sustain their families at home while they are 
away. 

THE DUTY OF THE SEVENTIES 

I might say that this work ought to, in my opinion, devolve largely 
upon the different quorums of seventies in the Church. This is a won- 
derful organization in every respect, and the seventies, those elders who 
.are called to compose quorums of seventies, elders presided over each one 
by seven of its number, should have it in their hearts to send this gospel 
to the ends of the earth. That is what they are for ; that is their special 
calling. Every elder has received authority from God to hold the Mel- 
chizedek Priesthood and to be a minister of the Most High, whether he be 
a standing minister in the stakes of Zion or is sent forth by proper au- 
thority to different parts in the world ; but especially the seventies in the 
Church are called and appointed and ordained to preach the gospel to 
the ends of the earth under the direction of the Twelve apostles. 

This is part of the system to which we belong. What a beautiful 
system it is ! Provision made in it for carrying the gospel abroad and 
for preaching to the people at home, and for setting in order the people 
in all the different parts of Zion, and for the establishment of the pur- 
poses of the Almighty, all in perfect order. If you would all keep in 
the order that is appointed by revelation from on high, there would be no

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



trouble among us, all the powers and authorities vested in different call- 
ings in the Church, but all would work in perfect harmony, and it does 
to a very large extent. We only have a little ripple now and then from 
persons who are either not fully informed or become ambitious, wish to 
step out of their place and do' that for which they have not been ap- 
pointed. 

OUR AUTHORITY DIVINE 

Now, my brethren and sisters, this morning I rejoice in the testi- 
mony in my heart of the divinity of this work, and of this great fact that 
we are representing the only Church under the direction personally of 
Jesus Christ, our Redeemer, which is recognized on high. The power 
and authority has come from on high to the leaders of this Church to 
seal on earth, and what they seal in the way appointed will be sealed in 
heaven ; to loose on earth when it becomes proper and necessary, and it 
shall be loosed in heaven. We work together with the powers on high. 
The authority given by the Lord to us is divine authority. It is not 
the authority of men although it is given to men. Men are called and 
ordained to different offices in the holy priesthood that they may labor 
for the salvation of souls, not only for the living but also for the dead. 

THE DUTY OF THE PRESENT 

Our work goes back to our ancestry, to former generations as far as 
we can extend it. It also goes forward for the benefit of our posterity, 
and we stand here on the earth between these two seas, not "unbounded" 
seas, as we used to sing in one of the old sectarian hymns — "On two 
unbounded seas I stand" was one of the songs that used to be sung in the 
old Dissenting churches ; of course that is an absurdity — but we do stand 
between the past and the future. W r e, who are here today in the present, 
not only have a duty to perform in carrying the gospel of Jesus Christ 
as it has been restored in the latter days, to all the world, but to labor for 
the salvation of our ancestors by attending to ordinances for them which 
they could not now perform, being in the spirit world ; also to lay a 
foundation for our posterity to walk in our ways as far as we do right, 
to learn to keep God's commandments and, when we pass away, to bear off 
this kingdom and carry it to a consummation under the direction of Jesus 
Christ, our Redeemer, who is perfect in his obedience to the great Eter- 
nal Father whom we worship. 

DOCTRINES REVEALED FROM GOD 

The doctrines of the Church that have been given to lis have been 
revealed from God. The doctrine of faith — real faith, not mere belief, 
but real, whole-souled faith in the Supreme Being, the Father of us all 
in our spirit state ; to have faith in him and in his Son Jesus Christ, who 
represents him fully and completely in personality, in appearance, in 
form, in feature, in spirit and in power, and is appointed to be the man- 
ifestation of God in the flesh. He has ended his mission on earth ; he is 



PRESIDENT CHARLES IV. PENROSE 



13 



filling it on high ; he kept every commandment of God before he came 
into the world ; he kept the commandments of God while he was here, 
and has continued to be subservient to his Father .in heaven, so that 
they two are one, and the Holy Ghost, the third person in the holy 
Trinity — a personage of spirit — is one with them ; and by the power that 
emanates from Deity the worlds are created and peopled and led on 
from stage to stage in progress towards perfection, all to be obedient 
to the eternal principles of right embodied in the personages of the Trin- 
ity, our Father, our Elder Brother, and the Holy Ghost. From them 
proceeds that universal essence or spirit, the Holy Spirit, which is "in 
all things and through all things and round about all things," and as we 
are told in God's revelation to us, "is the law by which all things are 
governed." 

The Lord has revealed to us through the prophet Joseph that by 
the power of that Spirit he created all things, firstly spiritual and after- 
wards temporal. That is boundless ; wherever there is space, that Spirit 
is, so that there are kingdoms everywhere, as the revelation says : "There 
is no space in which there is no kingdom, and there is no kingdom in 
which there is no space ;" and this universal Spirit, which is the Spirit 
of life, the Spirit of light, the Spirit of truth, is the vital principle that 
animates all things organized under the direction of our Father and 
those associated with him, and is the one eternal Spirit by which things 
that are spiritual are manifest to those who are temporal. Now, that 
Spirit is with the Saints in its higher forms, in its higher gifts, in its 
higher manifestations. It is sealed upon us by the laying on of hands 
after we are baptized, as a heavenly gift, an abiding witness, and the 
doctrine of faith in Christ has to be taught to all the world as plainly as 
we can make it clear, to overcome the fallacies existing in the world — 
in the Christian nations and in the heathen nations — about an impersonal 
deity, about something which is nothing, a blank contradiction, that 
error may be dispelled, that darkness may be rolled away from the minds 
of the children of men, and the light of the everlasting gospel shall shine 
in, that they may learn something about God their Father, something 
about their origin, something about their duty, and something about their 
destiny. 

, EVERY MAN SHOULD LEARN HIS DUTY 

This work belongs to us who are here today, and those whom we 
represent in the different parts of the Church, and every man should learn 
his standing in the priesthood which is given to him, learn his duties. He 
can read most of them from the Doctrine and Covenants, which God has 
given to us as a sacred book, one of the written standards of the Church, 
which with the Bible and the Book of Mormon and the Pearl of Great 
Price comprehends the written standards. And we are not bound to re- 
ceive every book that somebody publishes with his own personal views and 
notions to' lead people astray and to glorify himself. Every man should 
learn his duty from that which God has revealed, and there is plenty 
revealed to enable us to understand our callings, our duties, our powers in 
the priesthood, and its limits. We are to advocate the freedom of con- 



14 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



science, and the freedom of speech and of good law. The freedom of 
speech should not be extended to license, whether it be by word of mouth 
or by the press, but that liberty which God designs for his children to 
have is embodied in the Gospel of Jesus Christ, so that our gospel is 
a gospel of liberty. It preaches liberty from sin, shows how people may 
repent, how they may turn away from evil doings so as to preserve their 
bodies as well as their spirits in purity before the Lord so _ that they 
may be quickened by his Spirit and learn of him, and come into sweet 
communion with him, and learn by the revelations of the Holy Ghost to 
them individually what they are required to do. Every man should un- 
derstand that. Besides that, there is order in the Church, by which the 
law of the Lord can be made known to the members of the Church, and 
the man who stands at the head holds the keys thereof. If we would 
all do that it would save a great deal of trouble and would accomplish 
a great deal of good. 

OUR CHURCH IS DIVINE 

Now, T desire this morning in my heart that all persons who attend 
this conference shall go away feeling the fact to be clear to their minds 
and burning in their souls, that this Church to which we belong is a 
divine Church. It is not a church of men. It is a Church from God, 
revealed by Jesus Christ and by those whom he has appointed. He vis- 
ited the Prophet Joseph, personally, and the priesthood itself came from 
on high, and was bestowed by the laying on of hands upon the Prophet 
Joseph, by beings who held the keys, and has come down from him to us 
and is the same to us as it was to him and the brethren associated with 
him in the early rise of the Church. It is called the priesthood after the 
order of Melchizedek, because Melchizedek was a very great and effective 
high priest, and the priesthood after the order of Aaron is so named 
because he was in a large degree a leading faithful priest. Some things 
he did that were wrong, like Moses did, and they were chastised for their 
misdeeds and weaknesses, but this priesthood is that which they held, 
and it is the only authority that God has given to man on the earth to 
represent him and to administer the ordinances of the Church in the name 
of the Lord Jesus Christ, or in the name of the Father and of the Son 
and of the Holy Ghost, in those things that the Lord has specially re- 
quired to be done in that order. 

OUR DUTY UNDER THIS KNOWLEDGE 

And, this work should be rooted in our hearts. We have a duty to 
perform. We are here to do it. That is what we are here for on the 
earth. The Lord kept our spirits back to this dispensation, that we might 
come here and aid in the building up of his kingdom and bringing about 
his purposes, which are all bound up in the redemption of the race, as 
President Lund has told us this morning, for the salvation of all man- 
kind, with only a few exceptions. Everything is to be saved that can be 
saved, and onlv those who will utterly rebel against the principles of 
salvation will be ultimately lost and "go away with the devil and his 



PRESIDENT CHARLES IV. PENROSE 



15 



angels in eternity, to suffer the wrath of God ;" they are to receive the 
penalty that is their portion, but all the rest are to come forth, every man 
in his order, and be judged according to his works, and when he has 
received the proper penalty or has been forgiven through deep and earn- 
est and real repentance, and turns unto God and bows the knee and is 
willing to do all things that the Lord commands, then all these can be 
brought up into some place or position where they can glorify God, and 
enjoy their own existence, and unite with their kind in the kingdom or 
order to which they are appointed, and in which they receive a just degree 
of glory. 

This is a great and mighty work because it is divine, and we should 
carry that knowledge with us. While we treat everybody in the world 
with proper respect, respecting their feelings, respecting their notions and 
ideas, as far as they are worthy of any respect — we do . not wish to inter- 
fere with the mode of worship or anything in which they may engage 
that is lawful— at the same time we have to remember the fact that we 
are the people of the Lord, and that we are here and are baptized into 
His Church, and ordained to the priesthood or appointed in the several 
auxiliary societies, that we may be saviors of men and of women and of 
children, and that we may plant in the earth a structure that cannot be 
uprooted, the benefits of which will go to our posterity and reach back to 
our ancestors for generations that are past. It is a splendid work. There 
is no language in which its greatness can be properly extolled and glori- 
fied and explained, because it is divine, and carries the mark of divinity 
in every part of its organism, in all its doctrines and precepts and ordin- 
ances and ceremonies, all of which are from God and not from man. 



OUR MISSION THE SALVATION OF SOULS 

Now, brethren and sisters, this is our mission on the earth, to labor 
for the salvation of souls, to do good and fear not, to stand, each man 
and woman in his or her lot and place, and labor for the redemption of 
the race, under the direction of the Lord Jesus Christ, our Master. It is 
a splendid work in which to be engaged. I have been in it for a long 
time, and I can say that I have more joy, and always have, in carrying 
the gospel to people afar off, or preaching it to people at home, when I 
have the spirit of it, than in anything else that I have been engaged in 
at any time. There is a joy. a complete satisfaction and contentment of 
soul in laboring for this cause, that does not go with anything else in the 
world. This will be our payment right here, if we get no other pay, but 
the glory that is to come, oh ! if we could only express what we can see 
and feel of it, I think we would enthuse other people. I think we would 
inspire them to works of righteousness, and to join in and bring about the 
purposes of the Almighty, because this work is to go pn forever and ever, 
and there is no end to it. This work will go on in the worlds that are 
to come, and our posterity, if they are only trained up in the right way and 
will walk in the path of righteousness, will help to carry this on, genera- 
tion after generation, eternity after eternity, and there is no end of it.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



ETERNAL OR CELESTIAL MARRIAGE 

One of the greatest manifestations of the mind and will of God to 
this Church is in the doctrine revealed to the Prophet Joseph Smith on 
eternal or celestial marriage. This ought to be impressed on the minds 
of our children, our hoys and our girls. Not merely as a matter of duty 
should they receive the ordinance of eternal matrimony, but as a great 
deligkt, as a privilege. Thankful they should be in their hearts that they 
can be worthy of receiving that great blessing — a man to have a wife 
sealed to him by the holy order of God, by that which is from all eternity, 
by the power of the eternal priesthood, which is without beginning of 
days or end of years, and that this shall be recorded on earth and re- 
corded in heaven. It shall be sealed on earth by the power of the Most 
High in men appointed to perform it, and sealed in heaven to stand for- 
ever, both beyond the veil and in and after the resurrection, saith the 
Lord your God. What a privilege for men and women to be sealed to- 
gether by the holy order of God in holy matrimony, loving one another 
with all their hearts, putting down every feeling of discord that may 
arise, subduing every feeling of personality wherein they disagree, trying 
to harmonize in the household and build upon a foundation that shall 
never be destroyed, that the children after them shall come forth in purity 
to serve the Lord, to spread his gospel in the world, and in the world to 
come shall be with them in the holy patriarchal order of the family rela-. 
tion, and that they shall increase, worlds without end, in their posterity, 
in knowledge, in wisdom, in understanding, in dominion, in power, in 
glory, and in close intercourse with the great Eternal Father and beings 
of his character. That is what is involved in this splendid order of celes- 
tial marriage. 

When I speak of "celestial marriage" I mean just as we can read 
about it in the 132nd section of the Doctrine and Covenants. It is given 
as a commandment ; that is, this celestial marriage, which is eteral mar- 
riage, marriage for time and all eternity. That is necessary for a man and 
a woman to attain to the highest degree of glory in the celestial world. 
If they do not receive it in their hearts they are damned, or condemned, 
because if they do riot receive it then they cannot go further ; their rela- 
tions will end at death. But if they are united by the holy order of God, 
by that power which is from all eternity,ordained, as Jesus said, by him and 
his Father before the world was. it shall abide in death and it shall abide 
in and after the resurrection. The children, the posterity of the persons 
thus joined, shall belong to them, to one another, and with that order 
they will progress in all things and have an endless posterity while eternal 
ages roll along. That is a privilege. We need not class it as a duty, al- 
though it is, for it is a commandment of God. 

PLURAL MARRIAGES NO LONGER SOLEMNIZED 

There is another portion of that revelation which relates to further 
orders in that holy order of marriage which is under special direction, the 
power and keys of which are confined to one individual, who is the 



PRESIDENT CHARLES IV. PENROSE 



17 



President of the Church. Read it carefully. The keys of that power are 
given only to one man at a time on the earth, and you will see sometime, 
if you cannot now, the wisdom of that law. He holds the key of that 
power, and when he turns it, as Brother Woodruff did, it closes the door. 
He issued a manifesto which was adopted by the Church, that plural 
marriages should no longer be solemnized, because the highest court, the 
court of last resort in this land, passed upon the laws that had been 
enacted by Congress, and pronounced them constitutional, then we sub- 
mitted to the law of the land, as we are told to do in the revelations of 
God, and to the authority that belongs to the one man in the law of God. 
Now then, when you hear of people — I want to refer to this as clearly as 
possible, and I find it necessary to do it because of some recent occur- 
rences — when men go around and whisper in the ears of the people that 
this thing is all right if you can keep it secret ; keep it from the man that 
holds the keys — Think of it ! — if you can keep it from him, don't say 
anything to him about it ; it is all right. Such deception has been exposed 
and condemned several times, but it is cropping out again. 

President Lorenzo Snow, in the year 1900, the 8th day of January, 
issued a statement through the Deseret Neivs, announcing that plural 
marriages were positively forbidden. They were stopped before that, of 
course, and the congregation in conference assembled endorsed the de- 
cision of President Wilford Woodruff, who held the keys, that this kind 
of marriages should be permitted no longer. President Lorenzo Snow, 
on the date named, published in .the Dcscrct News a statement to the effect 
and told the brethren everywhere that if they entered into that kind of 
marriage it would be at their own risk under the law, for the Jaw is 
against it, the law of the land and the law of the Church; and when peo- 
ple are inveigled into any relation of plural marriage by persons pretend- 
ing to have a right to do it, they are led astray, and I am afraid when 
they are, they are very willing to be led astray, at least in some instances, 
but there are only a few such cases to be heard of nowadays, and yet 
they continue. There are persons who claim to hold the priesthood, 
who go around among the people and tell them it is all right and that 
it can be done. 

President Joseph F. Smith, in 1904 — he had spoken about this before, 
but he then issued a public manifestation which also was published in the 
Dcserct News, proclaiming to all the Church that there was not one 
man in the Church that had any right to administer that order of mar- 
riage, and yet such things have been done since that time, and we hear 
now that it is springing up again, and there are persons going around 
among the people and trying to lead them astray in regard to this. Let 
me read to vou a verse or two. Here is what President Lorenzo Snow 
said January 8, 1900 : 

"I feel it just to both 'Mormons' and non-'Mormons' to state that in ac- 
cordance with the manifesto of the late President Woodruff, dated September 
26th, 1890, which was presented to and unanimously accepted by our general 
conference on the 6th of October, 1890, the Church had positively abandoned 
the practice of polygamy or the solemnization of plural marriages in this and 
every other state, and that no member or officer thereof has any authority what- 
ever to perform such plural marriages or enter into such relationship." 



18 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Here is what was said over the signature of President Smith: 

"Inasmuch as there are numerous reports in circulation that plural mar- 
riages have been entered into contrary to the official declaration of President 
Woodruff of September 26th, 1890, commonly called the Manifesto, which was 
issued by President Woodruff and adopted by the Church at its general con- 
ference, October 6th, 1890, which forbade any marriage violative of the law of 
the land, I, Joseph F. Smith, President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints, do hereby affirm and declare that no such marriages have been 
solemnized with the sanction, consent or knowledge of the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints. I hereby announce that all such marriages are 
prohibited, and if any officer or member of the Church shall assume to sol- 
emnize or enter into any such marriage, he will be deemed in transgression 
against the Church, and will be liable to be dealt with according to the rules 
and regulations thereof, and excommunicated therefrom." 

Thereupon the following- resolution was unanimously adopted when 
this instruction and decision from the President of the Church was pre- 
sented : 

"Resolved that we, the members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints, in general conference assembled, hereby approve and endorse the 
statement and declaration of President Joseph F. Smith, just made to the 
conference concerning plural marriages, and will support the courts of the 
Church in the enforcement thereof." 

On January 31st, 1914, a message was sent to all the presidents of 
stakes and counselors, signed by the Presidency of the Church, Joseph 
F. Smith, Anthon H. Lund and Charles W. Penrose, saying: 

"Having reason to believe that some members of the Church are secretly 
engaged, advising and encouraging others to enter into unauthorized and un- 
lawful marriages, we have deemed it advisable to call your attention to the 
communication we addressed to you on this subject on the 5th of October, 
1910, a copy of which is herewith appended; and believing, as we do, that these 
people are at the bottom of all the violations referred to in our communica- 
tion, we direct your special attention to them, with the request that any in- 
formation received by you from time to time relating to cases of this char- 
acter, be followed up and investigated, with a view to having this class of 
offenders placed on trial for their fellowship in the Church, as we regard them 
equally culpable with actual offenders. Please make the same request of 
your bishops." 

Now, perhaps it might be thought there was no particular need to 
speak of this in this public conference, but I feel it a duty resting upon me, 
because I have heard so many stories that are being told concerning this 
that I thought it ought to be presented to this congregation, and I hope 
I have not trodden on the feet of any of my brethren in doing it. I know 
that this is their mind and will, and I know there are many members of 
our Church who point to certain parties and say they know that those 
parties have been married in plural marriage, that is, they have been 
joined — for there is no marriage in it — in plural marriage, but they do 
not tell that in a way that those parties can be properly handled. There 
is order in this Church, as there is in all the works of God, and there are 
proper tribunals to which these things should be presented. The bish- 
ops, as common judges in Israel, can take up such cases, and when they 
find the evidence, the proof is given them, can withdraw the hand of 



PRESIDENT CHARLES IV. PENROSE. 



19 



fellowship from the offenders, and they can send up the cases of men 
holding the priesthood, who have been shown to be transgressing in this 
way, to the high council of the stake wherein they reside, and it is the 
duty of the high councils in the respective stakes of Zion to act on these 
cases when they are so presented. 

The Council of the Twelve, which is a traveling, presiding high 
council, has had to take up some of these cases and has acted upon them, 
but the Twelve are not in a position always to do this, and when the people 
say: "Oh, the Church knows about it, the Church knows about it," they 
are mistaken ; the Church does not know, and if they know, it is their 
duty to take the matter before the proper authorities and get the matter 
handled, and stop this talk about the Church knowing it. Every case 
of this kind, when people make such remarks, is a reflection upon the 
President of the Church, who holds the keys, and it is intimated that he 
has one thing for the public and another thing in private ; that is a wicked 
falsehood, and I denounce it as such. I know that President Smith is 
the very soul of honor. I know that he stands, in his right place and holds 
the keys of this power, and if he thought it was proper to countenance such 
things in any way, he would do it with the greatest boldness in the world. 
I have not talked to him about this particular point, this morning or at 
any time recently, but I know that this is his mind, and I think that it is 
a good time to speak of it now. 

STATUS OF PEOPLE WHO ENTER MARRIAGE WITHOUT AUTHORITY 

Brethren and sisters, when we enter into any order that God has 
appointed, we have to do it properly, righteously, in the right spirit, and 
the man who holds the keys only has the right to regulate the matter. 
Do not believe these stories that men who are seeking to indulge their 
own lust are circulating around among the people, but try to guard the 
purity of our innocent girls, many of whom have never heard of such 
things, and these things are whispered in their ears by some designing 
person who is a rebel, a rebel against the Church of Christ and a rebel 
against the laws of the land — the laws of Utah I refer to. The laws of 
Utah forbid these things. The laws of Utah provide a very heavy pen- 
alty for any person who solemnizes such a marriage, a very heavy pen- 
alty for the man who enters into such a pretended marriage. It is not 
recognized as a marriage, but it is called a marriage so that cases may be 
tried in court. So that a man who goes around and does this, either by 
solemnizing such a thing or by advocating it, is a rebel against the Church 
and a rebel against the country, the state to which he belongs. That may 
sound rather harsh language, but it does not fully express my feelings 
and the feelings of others in regard to such persons. Now, I hope there 
are only a few cases existing among the people that I have referred to, 
because it is a serious thing to have people fancy that they are married, 
when there was no real marriage, no marriage according to the Church, 
no marriage according to the laws of the land ; and yet they live together 
with all the privileges of matrimony. It is wrong, displeasing to the 
Lord, displeasing to those who are in authority in the Church, and

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



offensive to a great many people who are surrounded by such persons and 
have to meet them pretty nearly every day. I would say to my brethren 
in the priesthood that while we want to extend the hand of kindness to 
repentant souls, while we do not want to throw a straw in the way of a 
repentant sinner, either in time or eternity, it does not follow, when 
such persons really repent, that they should be put up on high to be a 
mark for the people to respect in high places. Just think that over in 
your minds. Repentance is right, and encouragement of repentance is 
right, and the forgiving of sinners is right. God forgives sin when peo- 
ple properly repent, but that does not involve the idea that they should 
be set up in high places to be a mark of respect for people who feel that 
these persons have been in transgression. 

THE SPIRIT OF GOD AS A CONSTANT WITNESS 

Now, brethren and sisters, let us all do our duty. Let us rejoice in 
the Lord. Let us feel glad in this splendid work of the Lord that has 
been established. Let us do all in our power to spread forth the gospel 
by carrying it or sending it to the ends of the earth. It is a glorious work 
to carry this message of salvation, to bring souls, honest souls, into the 
knowledge of the truth and into the Church of Christ, to baptize them 
for the remission of their sins, and their sins are washed away : as the 
water washes their bodies, so their souls are cleansed, their spiritual being- 
is cleansed and revived, and they are born unto Christ Jesus, and become 
part of him, or of his body, the Church; and then by the laying on of 
hands to confer upon them the gift of the Holy Ghost as a gift from 
God, the Holy Spirit to be with them as a constant witness, as the abiding 
testimony, as the light of God, lit up in their souls, and to enable them 
to come near to the Lord and receive the revelations of his will concern- 
ing themselves, but not to govern the Church unless they are so appointed. 
Now, that is a splendid thing, and it is a reality. I know it is true. I 
know "it works," as the saying is, in every land to which it is carried. 
People of different languages and countries and customs, to whom I have 
had the privilege of bearing my testimony, who have embraced the gospel, 
have received this one spirit, which gives the testimony of Jesus, and it 
is a reality and no moonshine about it. It is the light from the Sun of 
Righteousness. It is the glory of God that shines around about them. 
It fills the soul with peace. It gives them an abiding witness of the life 
and death and atonement of the Lord Jesus Christ, of the divine author- 
ity of the Prophet Joseph Smith, of the divine authority of the elders of 
Israel who bear this priesthood, and it is a real thing in the soul of man. 

TESTIMONY AND BLESSINGS 

I thank my God this morning in the midst of this congregation for 
this knowledge. I desire it to rest upon the people. I desire the Latter- 
day Saints to realize that they are members of the body of Christ, that 
they are all under covenant to walk in his ways, to serve him and keep his 
commandments, and when they receive the sacrament of the Lord's sup- 



PRESIDENT CHARLES W. PENROSE.

per, that they renew their covenants with him, declaring that they are 
willing to take npon them his name, and to keep the commandments which 
he has given them, so that the Holy Spirit may be with them always. 
What a blessing! What a great gift from God, and it is true, just as 
true as that we are here in this congregation this morning. 

Now, may the Lord bless his servant, President Smith, and prolong 
his days on the earth in usefulness, according to the full desire of his 
heart. The Lord will bless him in time and in eternity, in the body or 
out of the body. He is one of the chosen of God before the foundations 
of the world, to come here on the earth and hold the keys of this last dis- 
pensation, and he will carry with him wherever he goes, on the earth or 
in the spirit world, the might and strength and power of the Holy Priest- 
hood after the order of the Son of God, to be a witness for Him, to spread 
truth and light and salvation among the children of men, when they are 
out of the body as well as in the body, and stand in his lot and place as a 
leader in Israel, with the glory of God surrounding him forever and ever. 
God bless this congregation, and while we are here together in this confer- 
ence may the Spirit of the Lord inspire every one who speaks, that they 
may bring forth words of eternal life, and may the Holy Spirit accom- 
pany them, and may we all be able to carry it with us wherever we go, 
as ministers of Christ, exemplars as well as preachers of the word, and 
stand in our lot and place and do our duty to the full extent, then our 
glory is sure, our exaltation is certain, and it will be forever and ever. 
Amen. 



PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 

I feel it imperative upon myself to endorse and affirm without res- 
ervation the statements that have been made by President Penrose in re- 
lation to the subject upon which he last treated. I want to say to this 
congregation, and to the world, that never at any time since my presidency 
in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints have I authorized 
any man to perform plural marriage, and never since my presidency 
of the Church has any plural marriage been performed with my sanction 
or knowledge, or with the consent of the Church of Jesus Christ of Lat- 
ter-day Saints ; and therefore such unions as have been formed unlaw- 
fully, contrary to the order of the Church, are null and void in the sight 
of God, and are not marriages. I hope you will put this down in your 
note-book of remembrance, and bear it in mind henceforth. 

The Choir and congregation sang Elder Joseph R. Shepherd, former

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT. 

It is ever and always a very great pleasure to me to meet with the 
Latter-day Saints in any of their assemblies, and I am particularly pleased 
to be present at our general conferences. It was a custom with me as a 
child to attend our general conferences regularly, and for thirty-six years, 
before this month expires, it has been my privilege to attend these con- 
ferences as one of the general authorities of the Church, and I have never 
yet attended a conference in this building but what I have been fed the 
bread of life by those who have spoken to the people. I rejoice with you 
in the very splendid meeting which we held here this morning, in the 
inspiration that came to each and all of the presidency of the Church as 
they addressed us. I desire to echo the sentiments expressed of gratitude 
and thanksgiving to our heavenly Father that our beloved President was 
able to be with us at our session this morning ; and I hope and pray, that 
the exertion necessary on his part to attend may not have been so great 
but what he can be with us again before our conference shall close. 

REGARDING FALSE TEACHING 

I desire on behalf of the council that I have the honor to preside 
over to say that we endorse the references, which were made here this 
morning by President Penrose, and so forcibly reaffirmed by the President 
of the Church, regarding this question of plural marriage and the fact that 
some men are today teaching it in secret, pretending that they are mar- 
ried or are entering into what they call plural marriage. Such men are 
indeed rebels, and traitors to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints, because they are branding it in the eyes of people who are not of 
us as being a dishonest organization. Personally, and I also speak for 
each member of the council of the Twelve Apostles, because I know their 
sentiments and I know that they are behind me, I endorse with all my 
heart these remarks. I want to say to the Latter-day Saints that in my 
opinion when any rebel or traitor to the work of God comes into their 
homes and tells them something false about the Church that there is a lack 
of patriotism on the part of all such individuals for not giving the traitor 
away. I would like you to get this into your minds. These people go 
around and lie, to put it in good, plain English, and they tell people, 
"Don't you say anything, don't you tell who told you that it was right." 



ELDER HEBER J. GRANT 



23 



You don't have to keep the confidence of those who are crooked, you 
don't have to keep the confidence of somebody who is telling you that 
which is false, and such people ought to be exposed, and exposed upon 
the house tops ; they go around posing as superior to honest, straight-for- 
ward, upright people, branding the Church and the leaders of the Church 
with infamy by pretending we preach one thing in public and do another 
thing in private. I do not care to say any more on this subject. I seldom, 
if ever, speak on it that it doesn't arouse almost every particle of anger in 
my nature. Some of them say the Lord has directed them to take more 
wives. Well, I think he directed them just like he directed the negro 
(not that I am saying this to reflect upon negroes), but there was a 
negro who prayed : "Oh Lawd, oh Lawd, oh Lawd ; send dis heah niggah 
a turkey." He prayed for a whole week, and he didn't get any turkey, 
and at the end of a week he said : "Dis heah niggah don' know how to 
pray," so that night the negro prayed, "Oh Lawd, oh Lawd, oh Lawd, 
send dis heah niggah to a turkey," and he, said, "Dis heah niggah had 
turkey dinner the next night." 

A REMARKABLE MANIFESTATION 

I indorse the remarks made by President Penrose regarding the peace 
and the joy and the happiness that comes into the human heart in testi- 
fying of the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ which has again been revealed 
to the earth. From October when I was called to be one of the council of 
the Twelve, until the following February, I had but little joy and happi- 
ness in my labors. There was a spirit following me that told me that I 
lacked the experience, that I lacked the inspiration, that I lacked the testi- 
mony to be worthy of the position of an apostle of the Lord, Jesus Christ. 
My dear mother had inspired me with such a love of the gospel and with 
such a reverence and admiration for the men who stood at the head of 
this Church, that when I was called to be one of them I was overpowered ; 
I felt my unworthiness and the adversary taking advantage of that feeling 
in my heart, day and night, the spirit pursued me, suggesting that I re- 
sign, and when I testified of the divinity of the work we are engaged in, 
the words would come back, "You haven't seen the Savior ; you have no 
right to bear such a testimony," and I was very unhappy. 

But in February, 1883, while riding along on the Navajo Indian Res- 
ervation with Elder Brigham Young, Jr., and fifteen or twenty other breth- 
ren, including the late president, Lot Smith, of one of the Arizona stakes,on 
our way to visit the Navajos and Moquis — as we were traveling that day, 
going through a part of the Navajo Reservation to get to' the Moqui Res- 
ervation — as we were traveling to the southeast, suddenly the road turned 
and veered almost to the northeast, but there was a path, a trail, leading 
on in the direction in which we had been traveling. There were perhaps 
eight or ten of us on horseback and the rest in wagons. Brother Smith 
and I were at the rear of our company. When we came to the trail I said, 
"Wait a minute. Lot ; where does this trail lead to ?" 

He said, "Oh, it leads back in the road three or four miles over here, 
but we have to make a detour of eight or nine miles to avoid a large 
gully that no wagons can cross." 



24 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



I asked : "Can a horseman get over that gully ?" 
He answered, "Yes." 

I said, "Any danger from Indians, by being out there alone?" 
He answered, "No." 

I said, "I want to be alone, so you go on with the company and I will 
meet you over there where the trail and road join." 

One reason that I asked if there was any danger was because a few 
days before our company had visited the spot where George A. Smith, Jr., 
had been killed by the Navajo Indians, and I had that event in my mind 
at the time I was speaking. I had perhaps gone one mile when in the 
kind providences of the Lord it was manifested to me perfectly so far as 
my intelligence is concerned — I did not see heaven, I did not see a council 
held there, but like Lehi of old, I seemed to see, and my very being was 
so saturated with the information that I received, as I stopped my animal 
and sat there and communed with heaven, that I am as absolutely con- 
vinced of the information that came to me upon that occasion as though 
the voice of God had spoken the words to me. 

It was manifested to me there and then as I sat there and wept for 
joy that it was not because of any particular intelligence that I possessed, 
that it was not because of any knowledge that I possessed more than a 
testimony of the gospel, that it was not because of my wisdom, that I had 
been called to be one of the apostles of the Lord Jesus Christ in this last 
dispensation, but it was because the prophet of God, the man who was the 
chosen instrument in the hands of the living God of establishing again 
upon the earth the plan of life and salvation, Joseph Smith, desired that 
I be called, and that my father, Jedediah M. Grant, who gave his life for 
the gospel, while one of the presidency of the Church, a counselor to Pres- 
ident Brigham Young, and who had been dead for nearly twenty-six 
years, desired that his son should be a member of the Council of the 
Twelve. It was manifested to me that the prophet and my father were 
able to bestow upon me the apostleship because of their faithfulness, inas- 
much as I had lived a clean life, that now it remained for me to make a 
success or a failure of that calling. 

GREAT JOY IN THE TESTIMONY OBTAINED 

I can bear witness to you here today that I do not believe that any 
man on earth from that day, February, 1883, until now, thirty-five years 
ago, has had sweeter joy, more perfect and exquisite happiness than I 
have had in lifting up my voice and testifying of the gospel at home and 
abroad in every land and in every clime where it has fallen to my lot to go. 
A.nd I have gone to Japan, I have been in the Hawaiian Islands, I have 
been from Canada to Mexico, I have been in nearly every state in the 
Union of the United States ; I have been in England, Ireland, Scotland, 
Wales, Germany, Holland, Belgium, France, Switzerland, Italy, Norway, 
Sweden and Denmark and I have had joy beyond my ability to express, 
in lifting up my voice, in bearing witness to those with whom I have come 
in contact that I know that God lives, that I know that Jesus is the Christ, 
the Savior of the world, the Redeemer of mankind ; that I know that 
Joseph Smith was and is a prophet of the true and living God, that I have 



ELDER HEBER J. GRANT 



25 



the abiding testimony in my heart that Brigham Young was a chosen 
instrument of the living God, that John Taylor, that Wilford Woodruff, 
that Lorenzo Snow were, and that today Joseph F. Smith is the representa- 
tive of the living God, and the mouthpiece of God here upon the earth. 

I do not have the language at my command to express the gratitude 
to God for this knowledge that I possess ; and time and time again my heart 
has been melted, my eyes have wept tears of gratitude for the knowledge 
that he lives and that this gospel called "Mormonism" is in very deed the 
plan of life and salvation, that it is the only true gospel upon the face of 
the earth, that it is in very deed the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. That 
God may help you and me and everyone to live it is my constant and earn- 
est prayer. 

HOW THE POWER OF THE PRIESTHOOD HAS BEEN MAINTAINED BY THE 
AUTHORITIES OF THE CHURCH 

I will read from Section 121 of the Doctrine and Covenants : 

We have learned, by sad experience, that it is the nature and disposition 
of almost all men, as soon as they get a little authority, as they suppose, they 
will immediately begin to exercise unrighteous dominion. 

Hence many are called, but few are chosen. 

No power or influence can or ought to be maintained by virtue of the 
Priesthood, only by persuasion, by long suffering, by gentleness, and meek- 
ness, and by love unfeigned; 

By kindness, and pure knowledge, which shall greasy enlarge the soul 
without hypocrisy, and without guile, 

Reproving betimes with sharpness, when moved upon by the Holy Ghost, 
and then showing forth afterwards an increase of love toward him whom 
thou hast reproved, lest he esteem thee to be his enemy; 

That he may know that thy faithfulness is stronger than the cords of 
death ; 

Let thy bowels also be full of charity towards all men, and to the house- 
hold of faith, and let virtue garnish thy thoughts unceasingly, then shall thy 
confidence wax strong in the presence of God, and the doctrine of the Priest- 
hood shall distil upon thy soul as the dews from heaven. 

The Holy Ghost shall be thy constant companion, and thy sceptre an 
unchanging sceptre of righteousness and truth, and thy dominion shall be an 
everlasting dominion, and without compulsory means it shail flow unto thee 
for ever and ever. 

I want to bear witness to you here today that during the thirty-six 
years this month that I have been a member of the Council of the Twelve, 
that no power or influence has ever been exercised by the prophet of God 
who has presided over this Church during this time except exactly as 
taught in the Doctrine and Covenants ; and that no one of all the men I 
have been associated with as presidents of the Church has had more char- 
ity, more love, and has exercised the priesthood by the power of the living 
God in meekness and mercy and kindness, than the man who stands at the 
head of the Church today, Joseph F. Smith. 

That God may preserve his life for many, many years yet to come 
is the earnest prayer of my heart, and that of every Latter-day Saint in 
all the land. May God guide us to his praise continually and forever, is 
my prayer, and I ask it in the name of Jesus. x\men.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



ELDER RUDGER CLAWSON. 

Greatness of the Lord Jesus — The 
burden of his mission — Scattering 
and gathering of Israel — The Church 
and Kingdom of God predicated up- 
on repentance — The judgments of 
God upon the unrepentant — The 
Millennium can only come through 
the establishment of righteous 
peace which can never exist if the 
earth is governed by militarism — 
The Central Powers therefore can- 
not win — The time for repentance 
and reformation is at hand — The day 
to approach the Lord in faith and 
prayer. 

I greatly rejoiced in the spirit of 
this morning's meeting', and was 
particularly pleased with the pres- 
ence of President Smith, as of 
course we all were. I have listened 
wifh much interest to the testi- 
money and exhortation of President 
Grant, and I humbly desire an in- 
terest in your faith and prayers that 
I may be led to say something this 
afternoon that will be instructive 
to those who are assembled. 

My brethren and .sisters, we learn 
from the scriptures and also know 
from our own experience, some- 
thing of the character of that Holy 
Being whom we have come to- 
gether to worship this afternoon. 
I doubt if we can fully compre- 
hend the greatness of his attributes. 
It is said of him in Exodus that, 
"He passed by before Moses and 
proclaimed the Lord God, the Lord 
God merciful and gracious, long 
suffering and abundant in goodness 
and truth." And in the 103d Psalm 
we find two references to the Al- 
mighty that are very striking. One 
is that "the Lord is merciful and 
gracious, slow to anger, and plen- 
teous in mercy," and the other "the 
mercy of the Lord is from everlast- 
ing to everlasting upon them that 
fear him, and his righteousness unto 
children's children, to such as keep 



his covenants, and to those that re- 
member his commandments to do 
them." 

How broad and far reaching is 
the love and mercy of the Lord. 
But remember that his mercy is in- 
variably predicated upon repentance, 
repentance of sin ; and the history 
of his people, I think, will substan- 
tiate this statement. You will re- 
member that in the wilderness 
Moses was constantly calling upon 
the people to repent of their sins 
that they might be forgiven by sac- 
rifice. It 'was the burden of his 
mission apparently to bring the 
people into harmony with the Lord 
and with his work by repentance ; 
and so it was in the meridian of 
time. The people who dwelt in Pal- 
estine had a great temple, the temple 
of the Lord, and they had the law 
of Moses, but it seems that they 
strayed away from the law because 
we read that in those days came 
John the Baptist preaching in the 
wilderness of Judea saying, "Re- 
pent ye, repent ye, for the kingdom 
of heaven is at hand." And still 
later we learn that after John was 
put into prison, the Savior came in- 
to Galilee preaching the gospel of 
the Kingdom of God, saying, "The 
time is fulfilled, the Kindom of God 
is at hand ; therefore repent and be- 
lieve the gospel." And it appeared 
that Jerusalem and all of Judea 
came out to hear the preaching of 
John, and were baptized of him in 
the Jordan river. But the Phari- 
sees and the Sadducees rejected him 
and he pronounced a woe against 
them demanding that they should 
bring forth fruits meet for repent- 
ance. This they did not do, they 
were rebellious, they loved dark- 
ness rather than light, and their 
deeds were evil. They went so far 
as to crucify their Lord. As a re- 



ELDER RUDGER CLAWSON. 



27 



suit Jerusalem was trodden down 
of the gentiles and the people of 
God were scattered among the na- 
tions where they have been to this 
day, and they have been hated and 
persecuted because of the stand 
which they took at that time. 

But we can see a day of deliver- 
ance coming - for Israel. Jerusalem 
has fallen into the hands of the 
Christian nations, and doubtless this 
will eventually open up the way for 
the return of the Jews to Jerusalem, 
and the building up of the waste 
places of Palestine. You will re- 
member that the Savior stood up- 
on Mount Olivet and wept over 
Jerusalem, and said, "Oh, Jeru- 
salem, Jerusalem, how often 
would I have gathered thy children 
together even as a hen gathereth 
her chickens under her wings, but 
ye would not," thus giving evidence, 
as I have said, of the spirit of unre- 
pentance and of rebellion. And let 
me remind you, brethren and sisters, 
that the coming forth of the work 
of God in our day, of the true 
Church and kingdom of God as re- 
ferred to by President Penrose so 
powerfully this morning, was pred- 
icated upon the principle of repent- 
ance. In an early day, in fact it was 
April, 1829, the Lord said to Joseph 
Smith and Oliver Cowdery, "Say 
nothing but repentance unto this 
generation, keep my commandments 
and assist to bring forth my work 
according to my commandments and 
you shall be blessed." Somewhat 
later than this, in the year 1831, 
the Lord again referred to this im- 
portant subject as he has done all 
through the Book of Covenants. He 
spoke of the great necessity of his 
people, and the people of the world, 
repenting of their sins and turning 
from evil unto him. Let me read to 
you a few words of that impressive 



revelation. Oh, how powerful is 
the word of the Lord when it comes 
direct from him by revelation to his 
servants. The language is simple 
enough, a child could understand it, 
but the spirit and power of it is in- 
deed impressive. Listen to these 
words : 

Lift up your voices and spare not. 
Call upon the nations to repent, both 
old and young, both bond and free, 
saying, prepare yourselves for ^ l he 
great day of the Lord; 

For if I, who am a man, do lift up 
my voice and call upon you to repent, 
and ye hate me, what will ye say 
when the day cometh when the thun- 
ders shall utter their voices from the 
ends of the earth, speaking to the ears 
of all that live, saying, Repent, and 
prepare for the great day of the Lord. 

Yea, and again, when the lightnings 
shall streak forth from the east unto 
the wes^t, and shah after forth their 
voices unto all that live, and make 
the ears of all tingle that hear, say- 
ing these words. Repent ye, for the 
great day of the Lord is coming. 

And again, the Lord shall utter his 
voice out of heaven, saying, Hearken, 
O ye nations of the earth, and hear 
tha words' of that God who made you. 

O, ye nations of the earth, how of- 
ten would I have gathered you to- 
gether as a hen gathereth her chick- 
ens under her v/ings, but ye would 
not? 

How oft have I called upon you by 
the mouth of my servants, and by the 
ministering of angels, and by mine 
own voice, and by the voice of thun- 
derings, and by the voice of light- 
nings, and by the voice of tempests, 
and bv the voice of earthciuakes, and 
preat hailstorms, and by the voice of 
famines and pestilences of every kind, 
and bv the great sound of a trumn. 
and by the voice .of iudgment. and 
by the voice of merry all the dav long, 
and bv the voice of glory, and honor, 
and the riches of eternal life, and 
would have saved you with an ever- 
lasting salvation, but you would not' 

Toehold the dav has come, when the 
rim of the wrath of mine indignation 
is full. 

Behold, verily T say unto you, that 



28 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



these arc the words of the Lord your 
God; 

Wherefore labor ye, labor ye in my 
vineyard for the last time — for the last 
time call upon the inhabitant of the 
earth. 

For in my own due time will I come 
upon the earth in judgment, and my 
people shall be redeemed and shall 
reign with me on eartTi. 

For the great Millennium, of which 
I have spoken by the mouth of my 
servants, shall come. 

Brethren and sisters, these are the 
words of the Almighty, and they 
emphasize and confirm the words of 
the prophet Isaiah who has .spoken 
upon this subject. O, how great is 
the mercy of the Lord. For eighty- 
eight years this people have lifted 
up their voices at home and abroad 
crying" repentance to the nations of 
the earth, but comparatively few 
have accepted the gospel, and now 
the judgments of God are going 
forth and have been going forth all 
these years, for the simple reason 
that we are living in the last time. 
It is here. The Lord has so de- 
clared it. And notwithstanding 
present conditions, that the wrJrkl 
today is in turmoil and the hearts 
of men are failing them for fear, 
not knowing what will be, still, as 
a people, we have received a promise 
from the Lord. He has declared it 
in modern revelation, that the Mil- 
lennium, a thousand years of rest 
and peace, shall come. Didn't 
Isaiah refer to this matter hundreds 
of years ago when he said that God 
would judge the nations and would 
rebuke many people and thev will 
turn their swords into plow-shares 
and their spears into pruning hooks, 
nation shall not lift up the sword 
against nation and they shall learn 
war no more? 

And so we may be very certain, 
that a time is coming when there 
shall be no more war. It is the voice 



of the prophet, it is the voice of God 
unto his people ; and I want to ,say 
to you, brethren and sisters, to me, 
to be personal, it is as clear as the 
noon day sun that the Central 
Powers cannot win this war because 
if thev should win this war and fix 
the principle of militarism perma- 
nently upon the earth, the Millenni- 
um could not come. Militarism must 
be put down. It is the purpose of 
the Allies without question to crush 
out the spirit of cruelty and of van- 
dalism that is abroad in the earth. 

I do not say, I am not prepared to 
sav, that this is the last great war ; 
I wouldn't sav that, but it does seem 
to me that this great world war, the 
greatest we have ever known or 
ever read of in history, by far the 
greatest, is leading up to the Mil- 
lennium that will come. I enter- 
tain that view and that feeling, and 
it is in accordance with the word of 
the Lord which must eventually be 
fulfilled. The earth may pass away, 
the stars may drop from their or- 
bits, but every iot and tittle of the 
word of God will be realized. He is 
a God of truth and cannot He ; and 
let me repeat to you that surelv this 
is a time for repentance and re- 
formation as President Penrose 
suggested this morning so beaut 1 '- 
fullv, a time to draw near to the 
Lord in faith and by prayer. This 
is a time to honor the priesthood, 
surelv, to honor that great principle 
of divine authoritv which has been 
given to the Church. This is a tune , 
of all times to pay our tithes and 
our offerings to the Lord. To give 
to him his iust dues since he has 
onened the windows of heaven and 
blessed us so abundantlv as a people 
and as individuals. This is a time 
to keep the Avord of wisdom our- 
selves right now. todav, and to teach 
our children to do the same. It is, I

take it, the law of health to the 
Latter-day Saints given for their 
blessing, for their peace and for 
their prosperity. It also brings 
spiritual gifts, such as wisdom and 
knowledge. And above all things it 
is a time for solemn prayer to the 
Lord. We surely cannot reach him 
nor get near to him without the ex- 
ercise of faith in prayer. 

In conclusion I am constrained to 
read the last verse of a hymn that 
was sung at the morning session: 

'•Hark, from all lands, from the isles 
of the ocean, 
Praise to Jehovah ascending on 
high ; 

Fallen are engines of war and commo- 
tion, 

Shouts of salvation are rending the 
sky." 

May the Lord bless us and guide 
us by his Spirit, sustain us in 
every trying situation and event- 
ually bring us off victorious, is my 
prayer in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 

Norman McCarty sang a tenor 
.solo: "How lovely are thy dwell- 
ings." 

ELDER J. GOLDEN KIMBALL. 

(Of the First Council of Seventy.) 

I have to confess that I am cer- 
tainly taken by surprise. I had no 
expectation whatever of being called 
upon at this time. I do hope that the 
few minutes that I occupy I may be 
favored of the Lord and be influ- 
enced by his Holy Spirit. I have had 
experience enough along this line of 
work to realize that the servants of 
God, when they speak, should speak 
under the influence of the Holy 
Spirit ; that the servants of God 



are entitled, if they do the will of 
the Father, to revelation and inspi- 
ration. The Prophet Joseph Smith 
says that no man should testify that 
Jesus is the Christ, unless it be by 
the Spirit of prophecy and revela- 
tion. I am a very strong believer 
in this, although we are not always 
under his influence. 

Brethren and sisters, I do not 
think that you question my integrity 
and my loyalty and patriotism to 
the Church of Jesus Christ of Lat- 
ter-day Saints. I think there are 
times when you have questioned 
very much what I say to you, and 
criticized me very severely some- 
times, but I get a good deal of com- 
fort out of the fact that none of the 
rest of you escape any better than 
I do. Our people and the children 
of men are very ready to criticize 
the brethren of the authorities and 
the local brethren who preside over 
the stakes and over the wards. They 
seem to feel that it is their right, 
and they certainly take advantage 
of it, some of them ; so that I am 
not discouraged at all. I often won- 
der when you do have the Spirit 
of God. I used to think I had it 
in the Southern States, when I be- 
came excited and sensational, and 
my face was red, and the cords of- 
my neck were swollen — I thought 
then, in my ignorance, that it was 
the Holy Ghost. I learned differ- 
ently afterwards. I am sure that 
was not the Spirit of God. I have 
learned since that the Spirit of God 
gives you joy and peace and pa- 
tience and long-suffering and gen- 
tleness, and you have the spirit of 
forgiveness and you love the souls 
of the children of men. I have 
learned that the Holy Ghost is the 
spirit of prophecy and the spirit of 
revelation. I often think, when I 
reflect along this line, sometimes 



30 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



when I have preached and per- 
haps in my egotism I thought I had 
the Spirit of God, but after some 
of the brethren talked to me I was 
very doubtful about it. I think of my 
father — our father, the father of a 
great race of people — he prophecied 
once somewhere on these temple 
grounds, when the people were in 
poverty, when they were almost dis- 
heartened, and things looked so 
dark and dreary before them. He- 
ber C. Kimball prophecied that 
goods would be sold as cheaply in 
Salt Lake City as in New York. 
After he (sat down, lie said ko 
Brigham Young, "Well, Brother 
Brig-ham, I have done it now." 

Brother Brigham said, "Never 
mind, Heber ; let it go." 

They did not. either one of them, 
believe it (Laughter; 

After the meeting adjourned, 
Apostle Charles C. Rich, I am told, 
went up to Heber C. Kimball, and 
he said, "Heber, I don't believe a 
word you said." 

Heber said: "Neither do I." 

(Laughter.) But he rounded it 
out: "But God hath spoken." 

, It was not Heber at all ; it was 
Cod who' spoke through Heber as 
a prophet. A short time after, the 
prophecy was literally fulfilled. 

So that sometimes, and very of- 
ten, the servants of God speak by 
the Spirit of God, but some of the 
people haven't got the same spirit, 
and do not believe the servants of 
God. Now, brethren, I want to ex- 
press to you this thought, that it is 
just as necessary for you Latter- 
day Saints to have the Spirt of God 
as it is for the apostles and the 
seventies and the presidents of 
stakes and the bishops, for when 
you speak, or when the servants of 



God speak under the influence of 
the Holy Spirit, it is the word of 
God to the Latter-day Saints. 

I do not care whether you like 
the mannerism or the crudity of 
the speaker. That does not make 
any difference, whatever; it is the 
word of God to you. 

Now, brethren, in a few words: 
I was very glad to hear Brother 
Penrose speak of the seventies. We 
are laboring under great difficul- 
ties in order to find men who are 
prepared to go out as witnesses of 
the Lord to the nations of the earth. 
I was at a seventies' meeting not 
long ago in the Richmond ward, 
and there were forty-five seventies 
there— a very splendid body of 
priesthood— and I said: "Now, 
brethren, I don't want to talk mis- 
sion to you if you have to go to 
war. I guess it would be a good 
thing to find out how many of you 
are between the ages of eighteen 
and forty-five." Over forty of them 
stood up. I told them to go to war 
as soon as they could, and on their 
return, after peace is declared, be 
prepared to preach the gospel of 
Jesus Christ. That is about the 
condition. The Lord said, not only 
to the seventies but to the priest- 
hood of God: "If you desire 'to 
serve ? God, you are called to the 
work." I have that desire burning 
m my heart, like a living fire, and 
so has every other man who holds 
the priesthood of God and has the 
spirit of his appointment. Again 
in that same revelation, the Lord 
tells us what qualifies us for the 
work It is not money. What is 
it? It is faith, hope, charity and 
love, with an eye single to the glory 
ot God, and any man who holds the 
priesthood of God, who has those 
gifts, he is qualified and fitted for 
the work. All he needs is to be 



ELDER RULON S. WELLS 



31 



called to the work by those holding 
divine authority. 

In conclusion : I have worked in 
the Church, perhaps not as well as 
I might have done, but I have 
staked everything on it. As I told 
a man one day, I had fifty-two 
cards in the beginning. I never 
played cards in my life — only smut. 
But to illustrate : I am not a card 
player, but in the begining I had 
fifty-two of them — that is a deck, I 
think. Some of you seventies are 
better informed, perhaps, than I, 
but at the present time I have only 
one card left. Do you know what 
I have staked it on ? Eternal life ; 
and if I fail in that I have failed in 
everything. Why? Because "sal- 
vation is the greatest gift of God to 
his children." Of all the gifts and 
all the blessings that God can give 
to his children, the "greatest gift is 
salvation." If you leave your father 
and if you leave your mother, your 
wife and your children, and your 
flocks and your herds, and all that 
you have, and go out as a witness 
for God, he has promised you an 
hundred fold. All the investments 
I ever made in my life, except the 
one of two Liberty Bonds I have 
been able to pay for, at four per 
cent, I have paid from eighteen per 
cent down, and all I got out of it 
was experience ; the other fellow 
got my money. (Laughter.) But 
this investment we have started out 
for, the Lord has promised you an 
hundred fold, and I pray God that 
this spirit may burn in the hearts of 
the priesthood of God, that every 
man shall understand for himself, 
as I understand for myself, that the 
priesthood of God is "inseparably 
connected with heaven." That is 
what places us in communication 
with our God. 

I know, as well as I know any- 



thing, that this is the kingdom of 
God, that this is the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 
that Joseph Smith is a prophet of 
God, that Joseph F. Smith is a 
prophet of God. I have always sus- 
tained the prophets of God, and I 
never talked with one of the Pres- 
idency of the Church that I did not 
rise to my feet and know that they 
were prophets of God. The Lord 
bless you. Amen. 

ELDER RULON S. WELLS. 

(Of the First Council of Seventy.) 

' T 

It is a matter of great satisfac- 
tion to me to be present here in 
this general conference of the 
Church, and I have been greatly 
pleased in listening to the words 
that have been spoken ; and. with 
all of the rest of my brethren I 
have rejoiced exceedingly in seeing 
the face of our beloved President 
with us here this morning. 

Reference was made this morn- 
ing to the work of the seventies. 
President Penrose, in his splendid 
address, spoke of the obligation 
that rests upon the Church of send- 
ing the "Gospel of the Kingdom" 
to the nations of the earth. Presi- 
dent Lund - likewise spoke of this 
great missionary labor, and the im- 
pression has been made upon my 
mind, as no doubt it has been made 
upon the minds of all of my breth- 
ren who constitute the membership 
of the Seventies' quorums, who are 
present here, that the special duty 
of carrying that message to our 
Father's children has been laid up- 
on our shoulders. 

We live in the day that has been 
spoken of by the prophets ; we see 
the signs of the coming of the Son 
of Man, and of what is called the 



32 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



end of the world. It is no doubt 
this universal war (the like of 
which has never been known) that 
now impresses the minds of men 
that we live in that wonderful day. 
After the Savior had been predict- 
ing the destruction of the temple, 
his disciples came to him privately, 
saying: "Tell us when shall these 
things be, and what shall be the 
sign of thy coming, and of the 
end of the world?" And in reply, 
after telling of the wars and rumors 
of wars which preceded the fall of 
Jerusalem, he said, among other 
things, "For nation shall rise 
against nation and kingdom against 
kingdom ; and there shall be fam- 
ines, and pestilences, and earth- 
quakes, in divers places" (Matt. 
24:1-7). 

And doubtless the apostle John 
beheld in vision the same eventful 
day when he declared, "And I saw 
another angel fly in the midst of 
heaven, having the everlasting gos- 
pel to preach unto them that dwell 
on the earth, and to every nation, 
and kindred, and tongue, and' peo- 
ple, saying with a loud voice, "Fear 
God, and give glory to him ; for 
the hour of his judgment is come" 
(Rev. 14:6). 

These words have been literally 
fulfilled, for the nations and the 
kingdoms of this world have been 
arrayed against each other in the 
most gigantic and greatest war the 
world has ever known. Famines, 
pestilences and earthquakes have 
occurred in divers places. Let all 
men repent and turn to the Lord 
for indeed "the hour of his judg- 
ment is come." 

Another sign of the Lord's com- 
ing and of the end of the world, 
given by the Savior himself, was 
this : "And this gospel of the king- 
dom shall be preached in all the 



world, for a witness unto all na- 
tions ; and then shall the end come" 
(Matt. 24:14). 

And this was the vision of John 
when he saw the angel fly in the 
midst of heaven having the ever- 
lasting gospel to preach unto them 
that dwell on the earth. 

These words, too, have been ful- 
filled for the angel came, the ever- 
lasting gospel has been restored to 
earth, and this gospel of the king- 
dom is being "preached in all the 
world for a witness unto all na- 
tions," and when this labor is com- 
pleted, "then shall the end come." 

In the establishment of this 
Church the quorums of the Seventy 
have been organized with the spe- 
cial mission of carrying into effect 
this obligation, that our Father's 
children might receive the truth, be 
brought into the fold, and escape 
the judgments which are to come. 
It is well, therefore, for our breth- 
ren of the quorums of the Seven- 
ties, to understand something of 
their obligation and of the purpose 
of these organizations, and the rela- 
tionship which they bear to the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints. It is with the quorums 
of the Seventies as it is with other 
quorums — they bear the same rela- 
tionship to the Church ; they are or- 
ganized into quorums of the priest- 
hood, to fit and to qualify them- 
selves for their various' lines of ser- 
vice in the upbuilding of the Church 
of Christ upon the earth. When 
we are privileged to be at home 
and associate with our brethren in 
quorum capacity we are in out 
training camps, drilling and train- 
ing ourselves for the service that 
we are to render to the Church, 
and when the Church calls us we 
are expected to respond. Where 
is our first allegiance? There have 



ELDER RULON S. WELLS 



33 



sometimes been misunderstandings 
existing among the brethren, and 
some have said, "My first alle- 
giance is to my priesthood, and no- 
body should interfere or assign me 
to any duty that in any way inter- 
feres with my quorum work in the 
quorum where I belong." Presi- 
dent Joseph F. Smith presides over 
the Church of Jesus Christ of Lat- 
ter-day Saints in all the world, at 
the present time, and when he 
speaks for the Church, and as the 
mouthpiece of God unto the people, 
and if service is required, he may 
call from any of the quorums of the 
priesthood men to render the spe- 
cial lines of service and of labor, 
for which they should have been 
qualifying and preparing them- 
selves in their training camps. So, 
if Seventies are needed to preach 
the gospel to the nations of the 
earth, the call will come from that 
source, and being endowed with 
power from on high, and divinely 
called, they go forth as witnesses 
for the Lord and carry the gospel 
message ; and if any other service 
is required of those who hold the 
priesthood or of any member of 
the Church, all are subject to that 
call, the call of the Church. 

In every stake of Zion there is a 
president of the stake ; he is the 
president of the church in that 
stake ; every institution, every or- 
ganization, and every member of 
that stake is under the jurisdiction 
of that stake president ; for he is 
the president of the church in 
that stake of Zion. His juris- 
diction, however, is limited to the 
boundaries of his stake ; and if the 
service of any man, any membe: 
of the Church is needed in the work 
of the ministry, in the building up 
of the Church, in the work and the 
labor of that stake of Zion, it is his 



prerogative to call, and it is the duty 
of every member of the Church, be 
he high priest, seventy, elder, or a 
member of the lesser priesthood, 
residing in his stake, to respond to 
that call. 

In every ward there is a bishop. 
He, besides being a bishop and a 
common judge in Israel, has been 
ordained a high priest, and set apart 
to preside in that ward. He is the 
president of the church in his ward, 
and has jurisdiction over every in- 
stitution and over every member of 
the Church in his ward and has the 
right to call them to his aid in be- 
half of the Church. His jurisdic- 
tion is limited to the boundaries 
of the ward. 

It is essential that we should 
have the priesthood. We cannot do 
without it. The Church could not 
perform its labor without the priest- 
hood, for this is the work of God 
and he has endowed his Church 
and his servants who hold the 
priesthood with power from on 
high giving them the right to of- 
ficiate in his name, and he recog- 
nizes their official acts just pre- 
cisely the same as if he had per- 
formed those acts himself. 

So, without the priesthood, the 
work of the Church could not be 
done, and therefore the priesthood 
is paramount ; but the Church, 
through its presiding authority, di- 
rects the labors of the priesthood, 
and it is the duty of every man 
who holds that priesthood to re- 
spond to the call of the Church. 

Our soldier boys have been in 
their training camps, subject to the 
call of their Country through the 
commander-in-chief. They have 
been qualifying themselves in their 
drills and in their exercises, that 
they might become capable and ef- 
ficient soldiers to battle for life 



34

and liberty on the battle fields of 
France and of Europe. They have 
been armed with the necessary 
weapons to carry on the great war 
for human liberty, and they have 
learned how to wield those weapons 
to the greatest advantage. They 
have been clothed in their Country's 
uniform, let no others presume to 
wear it. The call came and now 
they are fighting the enemies of hu- 
man liberty, and in doing this they 
are opening the gospel door to the 
nations of the earth. This is a part 
of the work of God, for his design 
is that his children shall be free in- 
deed, free from oppression, free 
from tyranny and despotic rule, and 
therefore they are engaged in the 
cause of righteousness and truth. 
Success attend them in their bat- 
tles and give them a glorious vic- 
tory over all of their foes ! 

And while our enlisted boys in 
khaki are fighting for civil liberty, 
let all the priesthood battle for the 
freedom of the soul against the 
arch enemy of God, who seeks to 
enslave the soul, the tyrant that 
would make us slaves indeed, put- 
ting us under the bondage of sin. 
Let us go into our* training camps, 
into the quorums of the priesthood ; 
we have been armed with the shield 
of faith and the sword of truth. Let 
us learn by drilling how to wield 
these weapons that we may success- 
fully combat the powers of evil. 
We have been clothed with divine 
authority, the uniform of God's 
soldiers. Let no others presume to 
wear it ; and when the Church calls, 
through the commander-in-chief, let 
us go forth and battle for the great 
cause of spiritual liberty, and^God 
will give success to our arms. 

Let the Seventies realize that 
they are enlisted in the armies of 
the Lord. They belong to the se- 



lective draft, to go forth and fight 
the battles of the Lord. There 
may be other volunteers, from the 
elders' quorums, and from the high 
priests' quorums, as their circum- 
stances shall allow, but we are in 
the draft, and let us respond when- 
ever the call shall come to do our 
duty, and fight the battle of human 
liberty. God help us to do it, I 
pray in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 

ELDER CHARLES A. CALLIS. 

(President of the Southern States 
Mission.) 

I earnestly pray, my dear breth- 
ren and sisters, that the Lord by his 
Holy Spirit will enable me to say 
something that will be for our good. 
I testify in earnestness of spirit that 
the speakers this day have spoken 
under the power of the Holy Ghost, 
and therefore their words have gone 
to the hearts of those who heard 
them. With you I rejoice with 
all my soul that God blessed us 
with the presence and counsels of 
his Prophet this morning. The life 
of our leader, President Smith, his 
splendid life, given in the service 
of our heavenly Father, is an in- 
spiration, not only to the Latter-day 
Saints, but to those who have not 
yet become members of the Church 
of Jesus Christ. As I gazed upon 
his countenance this morning, and 
as my soul was thrilled with his 
inspired words, the promise that 
the Lord made to the Prophet Jo- 
seph came to me. That promise was 
this, that the testimony of traitors 
should never turn the people of God 
against the Prophet Joseph Smith; 
and that promise is a continuing 
one. It has been realized in the 
life of President Smith ; for never 



ELDER CHARLES A. CALLIS 



35 



was a leader held in more love and 
affection than is the present leader 
of the Church today. 

The Lord Jesus Christ said : 
"Except a corn of wheat fall into 
the ground and die, it abideth 
alone ; but if it die, it bringeth forth 
much fruit." 

The world today is immersed in 
the spirit of sacrifice. This nation 
today is finding itself through the 
glorious mission that it is perform- 
ing. Sacrifice, we are told, brings 
forth the blessings of heaven, and 
the Lord Jesus said that it is more 
blessed to give than to receive. The 
mothers of this nation today are 
sowing precious seeds in this great 
conflict. The mothers in Israel, 
many of them, have been deprived 
voluntarily, however, of the com- 
pany of their sons, by reason of 
them being on missions, and many 
of these boys, after two years or 
two years and six months' absence, 
have returned home only to em- 
brace their mothers and then go 
into this awful world conflict. Can 
the world point to more sublime 
faith and sacrifice than these patri- 
otic mothers are making? This 
faith did not spring from the earth. 
It is not earthy. It is the gospel 
of Jesus Christ, which is the power 
of God unto salvation, that sus- 
tains these mothers, and that has 
given birth to this glorious faith 
which all men everywhere cannot 
help but praise and admire. For 
what is more sacred and divine 
than the faith of a mother ? If this 
gospel were a base system, if the 
leaders, the priesthood of this 
Church, were designing men, bent 
only upon achieving the subjuga- 
tion of the people to their own 
pleasure and will, how could such 
a faith as that arise out of this sys- 
tem? I want to bear testimony to 



you that the splendid faith of these 
mothers is a living, abiding, perma- 
nent testimony that this Church is 
of God, and that the gospel is in- 
deed the power of God unto salva- 
tion. 

In the days of Kirtland, in the 
darkest hour of the history of the 
Church, the very midnight of its 
history, when the powers of evil 
were attempting to destroy the 
Church, the word of the Lord came 
to the Prophet Joseph: "Something 
new must be done for the salvation 
of my Church." And then Joseph, 
always imbued with the spirit of 
sacrifice, sowed corns of wheat in 
the ground, so to speak. He took 
his choice servant, Heber C. Kim- 
ball, and he called upon Willard 
Richards, two stalwart defenders of 
the prophet and of the gospel ; and 
these men with others, he sent to 
England to preach the gospel, be- 
cause it was the will of the Lord 
that they should go. Oh, what a 
splendid spectacle — the prophet, 
surrounded by traitors, some, alas, 
in the Church, surrounded by en- 
emies, voluntarily depriving him- 
self of the support of these two 
pillars of the Church, whom he 
sent to Great Britain to open up the 
gospel door to the inhabitants of 
that great land. And when they 
arrived in Preston, behold, their 
eyes met this inscription written up- 
on a banner : "Truth will prevail." 
It did prevail. It shall ever pre- 
vail, because this work is the truth 
of God, and truth is imperishable ; 
it is of God, and like God, it is 
eternal and shall live forever. 

The Apostle Paul said: "For 
ye know the grace of our Lord 
Jesus Christ, that though he was 
rich, yet for your sakes he became 
poor, that ye, through his poverty, 
might be rich." Ah, there is the 



36 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



grand principle of sacrifice. I tell 
you, my brethren and sisters, that 
the life that is lived for self is use- 
less to our fellow men and to the 
Lord. When a man lives and works 
for himself he begins to die, be- 
cause there is no life in work 
wrought for one's self. The work 
that has life and progress in it is 
the work that is done for our fel- 
low men, and the Book of Mormon 
says that "When ye are in the ser- 
vice of your fellow men ye are only 
in the service of your God." 

Well, these mothers whose sons 
are going to fight the battles of 
liberty, what fruits are we going 
to receive from that splendid and 
sacred sacrifice? First of all, the 
words of the prophets of God will 
be fulfilled by the utter defeat and 
demoralization of that power which 
was once flung from the battle- 
ments of heaven into the very 
bosom of hell. Again, out of this 
world conflict will come a period of 
peace, of rest ; how long we know 
not ; but in this period of peace the 
servants of God will go forth to 
^preach the everlasting gospel, and 
countless thousands shall come into 
the Church, praising God because 
they accepted the glorious message 
brought to them by his servants. 
Again, another fruit of this conflict, 
of this sacrifice, will be this — a new 
Jerusalem of liberty, of the rights 
of men, shall descend out of the 
firmament of liberty; it shall rest 
upon the earth, and the right of ev- 
ery man to life, liberty, and the 
pursuit of happiness shall be estab- 
lished, let us pray, nevermore to 
perish from the earth! God bless 
our armies. May they go forth with 
invincible power. Oh, may God 
bring the people to repentance, that 
they may escape a prolongation of 
this terrible conflict; for when sin- 



cere repentance begins, then we 
may expect, nay, we have faith that 
the end of this war will soon be in 
sight. 

I feel, my brethren and sisters, 
that in Israel there is no disposi- 
tion to be a stumbling block to our 
brethren. But if I by my reckless- 
ness or indiscretion in using any 
civic right I have make a stumbling 
block for the young man, in encour- 
aging the saloon, or by using things 
which God hath forbidden, if I 
forget myself and I cause that boy 
to take the first step in his down- 
ward career, oh, God help me to 
remember this awful truth, ':hat I 
am starting the boy down the track, 
but I can never repent for aim, 
for repentance is an individual gift 
which God hath given. Let us re- 
member it. As a man cannot di- 
vide t his righteousness with his fel- 
low men — for each and every one 
of us must work out our salvation 
in fear and in trembling — let us also 
remember that we cannot repent for 
our fellow men. We can preach the 
gospel to them ; we can console 
them; we can call them to repent- 
ance, but after all, repentance is a 
gift from God and comes only to 
the penitent and repentant heart. 
So let us keep this lesson in view, 
that with the help of our heavenly 
Father no word, no act of ours shall 
ever be the means of creating a 
stumbling block for the youth of 
Israel. 

God bless the gospel. In the mis- 
sions it is growing by leaps and by 
bounds. During the past six months 
we have witnessed miraculous and 
sudden conversions to the truth. 
There was an apostle in the South- 
ern States mission about two years 
ago; and a woman who was af- 
flicted with the dread malady of 
pellagra in a state pronounced in- 



ELDER CHARLES A. CALLIS

curable, asked to be administered 
to. She was administered to by this 
servant of the Lord. Eighteen 
months later this woman came to 
me. I did not recognize her, there 
was such a marked improvement in 
her condition. "Why," she said, "I 
am the one whom you and Brother 

■ administered to, and I am 

healed. The power of God hath 
healed me." 

Again, this same apostle, in bid- 
ding adieu to the Saints in one of 
our branches, when shaking hands 
with a good, faithful sister, whose 
husband was not in the Church, and 
we had well nigh given up hopes of 
him ever coming into the Church, 
said: "Sister, I promise you that 
the desires of your heart shall be 
realized, and your husband will 
come into the Church." Imagine 
my deep pleasure, for the poor 
wife had almost despaired of see- 
ing this promise realized — she kept 
it sacred, told no one about it— 
when the day came only a few 



weeks ago that her husband experi- 
enced a change of heart. It was 
miraculous. God's power touched 
his heart, and he came to me and 
said : "Brother Callis, I want to be 
baptized," and we all joined ' in 
shedding tears of joy with that de- 
voted and faithful wife who had 
experienced the fulfilment of this 
inspired promise. 

I know the gospel is true. I bear 
testimony to it in humility, and in 
deep gratitude, and with the fer- 
vent desire that I may ever conduct 
myself so that I shall be worthy of 
this testimony abiding in me, is my 
earnest prayer in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 

The choir and congregation sang : 
"Do What is Right." 

Conference adjourned until Sat- 
urday morning, 10 o'clock. 

The benediction was pronounced 
by President Joseph E. Robinson, of 
the California Mission. 



SECOND DAY.

The congregation was called to 
order by President Joseph F. Smith. 

The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn : "Come come, ye Saints, 
no toil nor labor fear." 

Prayer was offered by Elder 
Joseph S. Geddes, president of the 
Oneida stake of Zinn. 

The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn : "Hail to the man who 
communed with Jehovah."

Not an accident — Nephi and the

The twelfth day of October, 
1918, will be the four hundred and 
twenty-sixth anniversary of the 
discovery of America by Columbus, 
and the day has been set apart by 
proclamation of the President of 
the United States for general ob- 
servance throughout the nation. It 
might not be amiss, at this general 
conference of the Church to antici- 
pate that observance, in so far, at 
least, as to make reference to this 
great and illustrious event and to 
some of the issues that have grown 
out of it. I cannot hope to elabor- 
ate my theme ; the time is too lim- 
ited for that ; but will give it to you 
in headlines, as Brother Roberts 



would say, merely throwing out a 
few thoughts which you can clothe 
for yourselves at your leisure^ 

Columbus discovered America in 
the year 1492. He was not the first 
white man to tread the soil of the 
New World. Five hundred years 
before his time an Icelandic sailor, 
Lief Erickson, with a band of dar- 
ing spirits, grounded keel on the 
shores of New England, named by 
him Vinland (Vine Land) from 
the wild grapes that grew there in 
profusion. They built a few huts, 
but did not make a permanent set- 
tlement, did not remain very long. 
Other Norsemen followed in their 
wake. But no tidings of these ad- 
venturous exploits had. penetrated 
to the other European nations when 
Columbus started upon his great 
voyage. 

Columbus believed that the earth 
was round, but he was not the first 
to entertain that theory. Sir John 
Mandeville, an English traveler, 
wrote a treatise upon the subject in 
1356, long before Columbus was 
born, having become convinced of 
it by astronomical observations. 
That treatise is said to be "the very 
first English book that ever was 
written" (Ridpath's History of the 
United States, chapter 3). Most of 
the people of that time believed the 
earth to be flat or shaped like a 
cheese, and that one had but to sail 
westward a certain .distance beyond 
the Pillars of Hercules — the Strait 
of Gibraltar — and he would come 
to "the slipping off place," and go 
down and be heard from no more. 
In the face of this terrible tradition, 
widely prevalent in that age, it took 



ELDER ORSON F. WHITNEY. 



some degree of courage and forti- 
tude to set out for the unknown 
West. Columbus was one of a 
number of learned men who held 
that the earth was a sphere. While 
not the first to hold that theory, he 
was the first to put it into practice. 
He believed that he could reach In- 
dia by sailing westward. Accord- 
ingly, he sailed for India, and found 
America on the way. [President 
Smith, sotto voce, from his seat be- 
hind the speaker : "He could hardly 
have missed it."] PresMent Smith 
remarks that "he could hardly have 
missed it." (Laughter.') Landing 
on one of the Bahama Islands — San 
Salvador — Columbus supposed it to 
be the coast of India, and he never 
learned to the contrary so long as 
he lived on earth. That is why he 
called the natives "Indians." 

The discovery of America was 
not an accident. The event had 
been fore-ordained in the eternal 
councils. The prophets of old had 
it in view. Jacob foresaw it when 
he blessed his son Joseph, calling 
him "a fruitful bough by a well, 
whose branches run over the wall" 
[of waters] "unto the utmost bound 
of the everlasting hills" (Gen. 49: 
22-26). Moses had it in prophetic 
vision when he blessed the tribes 
of Israel, making great and peculiar 
promises to the tribe of Joseph, 
whose land (America) was to be 
"precious" for the things of heaven 
and of earth, and whose descend- 
ants through Ephraim were to 
"push the people," the Lord's peo- 
ple, "together to the ends of the 
earth" (Deut. 33:13-17); a hint 
foreshadowing the gathering of 
Israel in the last days. 

There was an American prophet 
named Nephi. He came from Jeru- 
salem six hundred years before the 
birth of the Savior — came with his 



father, Lehi, and an Israelitish col- 
ony, and both South and North 
America were eventually peopled 
by their descendants. Those who 
followed Nephi were known as 
Nephites, while a degenerate fac- 
tion who had for their leader Ne- 
phi's brother Laman, were termed 
Lamanites. These were the ances- 
tors of the American .Indians. Ne- 
phi was shown by an angel the 
glorious future of this land, a land 
of promise, the land of Joseph, the 
latid of Zion, the theatre of won- 
derful events in .days that were to 
come. I shall now read to the con- 
gregation a portion of Nephi's vis- 
ion of the future of America, an 'I 
in order to avoid repetition ami 
thus save time, will comment upo" 
the several paragraphs as I proceed. 
First Nephi, thirteenth chapter : 

"And it came to pass that the angel 
spake unto me, saying, Look! And I 
looked and beheld many nations and 
kingdoms. 

"And the angel said unto me, What 
beholdest thou? And I said, I behold 
many nations and kingdoms. 

"And he said unto me, These are 
the nations and kingdoms of the Gen- 
tiles." 

The word "Gentiles" in the fore- 
going quotation refers to the 
peoples of Europe at the time 
of Columbus and the great 
discovery. Let me interject here 
that the word "Gentile," as we use 
it, is not intended as a term of re- 
proach. The nickname "Mormon" 
was originally applied to the Lat- 
ter-day Saints in derision. We are 
railed "Mormons" because we be- 
lieve in the Book of Mormon, from 
which I am reading. Mormon, a 
Nephite prophet, was the compiler 
of this record. But "Gentile" meant 
in ancient times "one of another 
nation or people." The great pro- 



40 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



erenitor of the Gentiles was Japheth, 
one of the three sons of Noah, bv 
whom earth was reneopled after the 
"'nod. Shem peopled Asia and be- 
came the ancestor of Abraham, 
Tsaac and Jacob, those great patri- 
archs of the chosen seed. Ham in- 
habited Africa: he was the father 
of the black races. From Japheth 
sprang the European nations, and 
it was to them that the angel re- 
ferred in sneaking to Nephi. The 
origin of the English word "Gen- 
tile" is in the Greek "Gentili's," 
which simply means of or pertam- 
ing to a nation or people not of the 
House of Israel. But let me read 
further : 

"And it came to pass that I looked 
and beheld manv waters; and they 
divided the Gentiles from the seed of 
mv brethren. 

"And it came to pass that the angel 
said unto me, Behold the wrath of 
God is upon the seed of thy breth- 
ren." 

Here is meant the Lamanites, 
who were cursed for their iriicmitv 
with dark skins and benighted 
minds. Thev were the brethren of 
the Neohites, the seed or descend- 
ants of the rebellions brothers of 
Nephi. and bv them the Neohites 
were destroved about the vear 420 
A. D. "Manv waters" describes 
the ocean d : viding the American 
continents from the Eastern Hem- 
isphere. 

"And T looked and beheld a man 
amonsr the Gentiles who was separ- 
ated from the seed of mv brethren 
by the many waters: and I beheld 
the Spirit of God, that it came down 
and wrought upon the man and he 
went forth i^on the many waters, 
even unto the seea of my brethren 
who were in the promised land." 

I need not stop to say that this 
man Avas Christopher Columbus, 



impelled by the Spirit of God 10 
cross the deep, and thus build, as 
God's servants have always done, 
better than he knew. 

"And it came to pass that I beheld 
the Spirit of God, that it wrought 
upon other Gentiles; and they went 
forth out of captivity, upon the many 

waters." 

This reference is to the Pilgrims 
or Puritans, who about the begin- 
ning of the Seventeenth century 
fled from England to Holland to 
escape religious persecution in their 
own land, and then returned to Eng- 
land and sailed for America, land- 
in 9" at Plymouth Rock in December, 
1620. They were followed by many 
others. In fact, before the Puri- 
tans settled in Massachusetts, an 
English colonv had settled in Vir- 
ginia, where they founded James- 
town ; and Huguenots from France, 
Cavaliers and Roundheads from 
England, with Scotch and Irish and 
German emigrants of all classes 
came flocking to North Amer- 
ican shores, and were the elements 
of the great nation subsequently 
founded here. 

"And it came to pass that I beheld 
many multitudes of the Gentiles upon 
the land ,of promise; and I beheld the 
wrath of God, that it was upon the 
seed of my brethren; and they were 
scattered before the Gentiles and were 
smitten." 

The history of the .red man, 
rmshed back by the white man land- 
ing in America, is too well known 
to require extended comment. 

"And I beheld the Spirit of the 
Lord, that it was upon the Gentiles, 
that they did prosper and obtain the 
land for their inheritance; and I be- 
held that they w,ere white and exceed- 
ing fair and beautiful, like unto my 
people before they were slain.

"And it came to pass that I, Nephi, 
beheld that the Gentiles who had 
gone forth out of captivity did hum- 
ble themselves before the Lord; and 
the power of the Lord was with 
them. 

"And I beheld that their mother 
Gentiles were gathered together upon 
the waters and upon the land also, to 
battle against them; 

"And I beheld that the power of 
God was with them and also that the 
wrath of God was upon those that 
were gathered together against them 
to battle. 

"And I, Nephi, beheld that the 
Gentiles that had gone out of cap- 
tivity were delivered by the power of 
God out of the hands of all other 
nations." 

Thus is portrayed in brief the 
Revolutionary War, that heroic 
strife of the American colonies for 
freedom and independence, follow- 
ed by the setting up of the Govern- 
ment of the Llnited States, the 
greatest and best government that 
the sun shines on. Great are the 
promises of God concerning this 
nation, provided it be a righteous 
nation ; for he says in other parts 
of this sacred book that he "will 
fortify this land against all other 
nations," that there shall be "no 
king upon this land," and that they 
"who fight ag'ainst Zion shall per- 
ish." 

I wish now to dwell upon another 
phase of the subject. How wonder- 
fully the Gentiles have prospered 
upon this , choice land. I feel that 
I cannot do better at this point than 
to read a few paragraphs from the 
writings of Dr. John Lord, show- 
ing how marvelously God has 
blessed America, and forecasting 
some of the great things that he 
intends yet to do for her. In the 
sixth volume of Beacon Lights of 
History, is a lecture entitled "Mar- 



itime Discoveries." Therein that 
writer says : 

"The discovery of America opened 
a new field for industry and enterprise 
to all the discontented and impover- 
ished and oppressed Europeans who 
emigrated. At first they emigrated 
to dig silver and gold. * * * * 
Many were disappointed, and were 
obliged to turn agriculturists, as in 
Virginia. Many came to New Eng- 
land from political and religious mo- 
tives. But all came to better their 
fortunes. Gradually the United 
States and Canada became populated 
from east to west and from north to 
south. The surplus population of 
Europe poured itself into the wilds of 
America. Generally the emigrants 
were farmers. With the growth of 
agricultural industry were developed 
commerce and manufactures. Thus, 
materially, the world was immensely 
benefited." 

Dr. Lord then speaks of the fu- 
ture : 

"There is no calculating the future 
resources and wealth of the New 
World, especially in the United 
States. There are no conceivable 
bounds to their future commerce, 
manufactures, and agricultural pro- 
ducts. We can predict with certainty 
the rise of new cities, villas, palaces, 
material splendor, limited only to the 
increasing resources and population 
of the country. Who can tell the 
number of miles of new railroads yet 
to be made; the new inventions to 
abridge human labor; what great em- 
pires are destined to rise; what un- 
known forms of luxury will be found 
out: what new and magnificent 
trophies of art and science will grad- 
ually be seen; what mechanism, what 
material glories, are sure to come? 
This is not speculation. Nothing can 
retard the growth of America in ma- 
terial wealth and glory. 

"And what then? * * * * The 
world has witnessed many powerful 
empires which have passed away and 
left not a rack behind.' What re- 
mains of the antediluvian world? — 
not even a spike of Noah's ark, larger 
and stronger than any modern ship. 



42 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



What remains .of Nineveh, of Baby- 
lon, of Thebes, of Tyre, of Carthage, 
— those great centers of wealth and 
power? What remains of Roman 
greatness even, except in laws and 
literatu^l and renovated statues? 
* * * What is the simple story of 
all the ages? — industry, wealth, cor- 
ruption, decay, and ruin. What con- 
servative power has been strong 
enough to arrest the ruin of the na- 
tions of antiquity? 

"Now if this is to be the destiny of 
America, — an unbounded material 
growth, followed by corruption and 
ruin, — then Columbus has simply ex- 
tended the realm for men to try ma- 
terial experiments. Make New York 

second Carthage, arid Boston a sec- 
ond Athens, and Philadelphia a sec- 
ond Antioch, and Washington a sec- 
ond Rome, and we simply repeat the 
old experiments. 

"But has America no higher destiny 
than to repeat the old experiments 
and improve upon them and become 
rich and powerful? Has she no 
higher and nobler mission? If Amer- 
ica has a great mission to declare and 
to fulfil, she must put forth alto- 
gether new forces, and these not ma- 
terial. And these alone will save her 
and save the world. * * * The real 
glory of America is to be something 
entirely different from that of which 
the ancients boasted. And this is to 
be moral and spiritual, — that which 
the ancients lacked. 

"I cannot see that civilization gain- 
ed anything, morally, by the discov- 
ery of America, until the new settlers 
were animated by other motives than 
a desire for sudden wealth. When 
the country became colonized by . men 
who sought liberty to worship God, — 
men of lofty purposes, willing to un- 
dergo sufferings and danger in order 
to plant the seeds of a higher civiliza- 
tion, — then there arose new forms of 
social and political life. * * * An 
entirely new political organization 
was gradually formed, resting equally 
on such pillars as independent town- 
ships and independent States, and 
these represented by delegates in a 
national centre. 

"So we believe America was dis- 
covered, not so much to furnish a field 
for indefinite material expansion, — 
but to introduce new forms of gov- 



ernment, new social institutions, new 
customs and manners, new experi- 
ments in liberty, new religious organi- 
zations. * * * If America has a 
destiny to fulfill for other nations, she 
must give them something more val- 
uable than reaping machines, palace 
cars, and horse railroads. She must 
give, not only machinery to abridge 
labor, but institutions and ideas to 
expand the mind and elevate the soul. 

* * * Unless something new is born 
here, ivhich has a peculiar power to save, 
wherein will America ultimately differ 
from other parts of Christendom? 

* * * America is a glorious boon 
to civilization, but only as she fulfils 
a nezv mission in history, — not to be- 
come more potent in material forces, 
but in those spiritual agencies which 
prevent corruption and decay." 

I presume the learned author of 
those splendid words would stand 
appalled at the "presumption," the 
seeming audacity of one who would 
stand up in a public assembly and 
announce to him and to all the 
world that this "something new" — 
new and yet old — having "a pe- 
culiar power to save," has already 
come, and that it lies at the very 
foundation of this work, God's 
mighty and marvelous work of the 
last days. Yes, whatever men may 
think or say, this is our position. 
In the Everlasting Gospel and in 
the powers of the Eternal Priest- 
hood, restored to earth through the 
instrumentality of a Prophet of 
God, in this the final dispensation of 
Gospel grace, are those "spiritual 
agencies which prevent corruption 
and decay," "institutions and ideas 
to expand the mind and elevate the 
soul," forces and powers which can 
alone save this nation and "save the 
world." 

The Latter-day Saints believe 
Columbus was inspired to discover 
this land in order that a free na- 
tion, dedicated to the maintenance 
and preservation of the rights of 



ELDER ORSON F. WHITNEY 



43 



man, including his right to worship 
God according to the dictates of his 
own conscience, might arise here ; 
a nation founded upon the proposi- 
tion that all men have equal rights 
to life, liberty and the pursuit of 
happiness, and that governments 
derive their just powers from the 
consent of the governed — a doc- 
trine diametrically opposed to the 
old autocratic notions prevalent in 
European and oriental lands. And 
we further believe that this nation 
was established so that the great 
work of Israel's God might come 
forth under its protecting aegis, and 
not be crushed out by the tyranny 
of man; to the end that the gospel, 
"the power of God unto salvation," 
might be preached in all the world 
as a witness before the end comes ; 
that the House of Israel might be 
gathered in from their long disper- 
sion, that Zion might arise, and the 
glory of God rest upon her, and the 
world be prepared for the coming 
of the King of kings, the Lord 
Jesus Christ, in his glory. We be- 
lieve this fervently. It is our mes- 
sage to the world. , 

America has fulfilled, or is ful- 
filling her high and noble mission. 
True, there have been some abuses, 
things that were never contem- 
plated by the founders of our na- 
tion, by the signers of the immortal 
Declaration, by the framers of the 
glorious Constitution. Men have 
been persecuted under the Stars and 
Stripes for their religious convic- 
tions. But it was not the Constitu- 
tion that did it ; it was not the 
Declaration, not. the Flag, that was 
responsible. These things occurred, 
not because of the Constitution, but 
in spite of it, and because the laws 
were not enforced for the protec- 
tion of the weak against the strong. 
Yet we do not hold this against our 



Government. We are willing to let 
bygones be bygones. America is 
fulfilling her mission despite such 
lapses ; for she has fostered and in 
a sense brought forth the Church 
of God, which represents the lift- 
ing of the ensign for the gathering 
of scattered Israel. Under her pro- 
tecting shield "the little stone" has 
come forth that is destined to be- 
come "a mountain" and fill the 
whole earth. 

And we stand by our country , 
we are glad and proud to see her 
continuing the noble work that God 
has placed upon her. Even as 
Joseph of old, liberated from prison 
and exalted to a throne, ministered 
to his brethren who had hated him 
and cast him out and sold him into 
slavery, so this Land of Joseph, lift- 
ed up on high, enthroned in beauty 
and power and glory, is now minis- 
tering to the needy nations who 1 
come bending to her for food, for 
succor, for assistance. America, re- 
discovering herself, forgiving the 
past and magnanimously returning 
good for evil, has even crossed the 
ocean with her armies and navies 
and is sending her sons to the front 
to help the nations of Europe, the 
democracies of the Old World, fight 
the battle of freedom and equal right. 
And I thank God, for one, that our 
boys have the privilege of partici- 
pating in this glorious strife. They 
are pre-eminently the sons of lib- 
erty, for the gospel covenant in 
which they were begotten and born, 
is liberty's perfect law, and it is 
most fitting and appropriate that 
they should play their part in the 
great and mighty drama that is 
fated to spread the principles of 
human freedom and clear the way 
for the carrying of the message of 
salvation into every nook and cor- 
ner of the world.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



God bless our country ! God 
bless America in ber heaven-ap- 
pointed task of succoring the needy 
nations, of guarding the ark of lib- 
erty, keeping alive the fires of free- 
dom, and maintaining the rights of 
man ! Amen. 

A duet: "The morning breaks, 
the shadows flee," was sung by 
David Reese and Anthony C. Lund. 

ELDER DAVID O. McKAY. 

■ A beautiful hymn and a significant 
prophecy — Necessity of considering 
the meaning of the Church of Christ 
— The change among the Jews re- 
garding the Holy One of Israel — 
God will remember his promises — 
The Holy Land about to be restored 
to Judah — Responsibility upon the 
peoples of the earth regarding the 
gospel of Christ — What are the re- 
sponsibilities of the Latter-day 
Saints?— An appeal to the youth of 
Zion to read the signs of the times, 
and to set an example of purity and 
chastity before the world — A strik- 
ing illustration. 

I was just wondering how many 
in this magnificent audience fully 
appreciate, or appreciate even to a 
slight degree, the sinificance of the 
third stanza of that beautiful hymn 
so inspirinly sung just now by these 
two elders. While the inspiration 
of 'their music is still thrilling our 
hearts, let me read : 

The Gentile fulness now comes in, 

And Israel's blessings are at hand: 
Lo! Judah's remnant, cleansed from 
ski, 

Shall in their promised Canaan stand. 
And the next equally applicable: 

Jehovah speaks! let earth give ear, 
And Gentile nations turn and live; 

His mighty arm is making bare, 
His cov'nant people to receive. 

Over two thousand years ago a 



prophet on the American continent 
prophesied of the restoration of 
Israel to "their promised Canaan," 
and also of the land of America, the 
mission of which has been so elo- 
quently explained to us by my 
brother, Elder Orson F. Whitney. 
If you will turn to the 19th chapter 
of I Nephi you will find these .sig- 
nificant words : 

And as for those who are at Jeru- 
salem, saith the prophet, they shall be 
scourged by all people, because they 
crucify the God of Israel, and turn 
their hearts aside, rejecting signs and 
wonders, and power and glory of the 
God of Israel; 

And because they turn their hearts 
aside, saith the prophet, and have de- 
spised the Holy One of Israel, they 
shall wander in the flesh, and perish, 
and become a hiss and by-word, and 
be hated among all nations; 

Nevertheless, when that day com- 
eth, saith the prophet, that they no 
more turn aside their hearts against 
the Holy One of Israel, then will he 
remember the covenants which he 
made to their fathers; 

Yea, then will he remember the 
isles of the sea; yea, and all the peo- 
ple who are of the house of Israel, 
will I gather in, saith the Lord, ac- 
cording to the words of the prophet 
Zenos, from the four quarters of the 
earth ; 

Yea, and all the earth shall see the 
salvation of the Lord, saith the proph- 
et; every nation, kindred, tongue and 
people shall be blessed. 

And I, Nephi, have written these 
things unto my people, that perhaps 
I might persuade them that they 
would remember the Lord, their Re- 
deemer. 

During the few moments that I 
occupy this position, I desire to say 
something regarding this significant 
prophecy with a view of reaching 
the young men and the young wom- 
en of Israel, that they might do two 
things, the first of which is to stop 
amidst their pleasures, to pause in 
the midst of the rush of this Twen-

tieth Century and think, — think of 
the significance and mission of the 
Church of Jesus Christ ; to try to 
realize even in a slight degree, the 
significance of the world changes 
that are now taking place, and 
measure them by the standard of 
• righteousness as taught by their 
parents and the authorities of the 
Church. 

Boys, now is the time to think, to 
pray, and to search, as we have 
never searched before, for the ever- 
lasting truth ; to realize while we 
are young that God's hand is over 
the destinies of the world, that he 
-is shaping the destinies of nations. 
Benjamin Franklin once said, "The 
longer I live the more convincing 
proofs I see of this truth, that God 
governs in the affairs of man ; and 
if a sparrow cannot fall to the 
ground without his notice, how is it 
probable that an empire can rise 
without his aid ?" 

I believe that the providence of 
God is shaping and will shape the 
destiny of the nations now in the 
grip of the worst war known to his- 
tory.

"Under the storm and the cloud today, 
And today the hard peril and pain. 
Tomorrow the stone shall be rolled 
away, 

For the sunshine shall follow the 
rain. 

Merciful Father, I will not complain, 
I know that the sunshine shall follow 
the rain." 

Twentv-three hundred years ago 
the prophet looking down through 
the vista of time saw this day. He 
saw Israel scattered among all na- 
trons. He saw them become a hiss 
and a by-word, but added, "never- 
theless, when the day cometh that 
they no more turn aside their hearts 
against the Holy One of Israel" — 
note he does not say when they ac- 



cept him as their Redeemer, nor 
necessarily declare to the world that 
he was the Messiah to come to their 
people — the prophet words it most 
significantly ; viz. /'when they no 
more turn aside their hearts against 
the Redeemer, then in that day will 
he remember the covenants that he 
made to their fathers." 

Brethren, isn't it a significant 
thing that today there is a change 
in the hearts of the descendants of 
Israel in regard to the Holy One of 
Israel ? 

In 1918, while visiting the Cali- 
fornia Mission with President Rob- 
inson, he put in my hand a book 
entitled, Jesus, the Jetv, written 
by a prominent Jew of Sacramento. 
In the first chapter of that book we 
get a picture of the enmity and bit- 
terness of the Jews when the au- 
thor was a boy. Their hearts were 
not turned, evgn at that late date, 
much toward the Holy One, but 
most bitterly against him. He said 
in substance : "I remember when a 
boy that one of my classmates 
brought into the class a book con- 
taining the name of Jesus. I re- 
member how wrought up and ex- 
cited the rabbi became when he was 
made aware of its presence in the 
schoolroom. 'Sacrilege ! Sacrilege !' 
he indignantly cried. Then the 
rabbi proceeded to denounce the 
Holy One. He said : 'How can any 
lew who realizes what that name 
has brought upon his people even 
touch a book containing the name 
of Jesus?' He told how the Jews 
bad been persecuted, how they had 
made outcasts and wanderers over 
been driven from pillar to post, and 
the face of the earth ; how their 
beards had been torn from their 
roots, their teeth drawn from their 
jaws ; how they had been whipped 
at the post, put upon the rack, and 



4(>

their bones drawn joint from joint; 
how they had been outraged, rav- 
ished, and killed, all on account of 
Jesus" — and by the Christians, 
President Smith adds. That is one 
picture, when that man was but a 
boy — when you were boys, my fel- 
low workers in the priesthood. Here 
is another picture given by a promi- 
nent Jew, Tsadore Singer, the editor 
of the Jewish Encyclopedia : "When 
I was a boy, had my father. who was 
a very pious man. heard the name 
of Jesus uttered from the pulpit of 
our synagogue, he and every other 
man in the congregation would have 
left the building, and the rabbi 
would have been dismissed at once." 
That is illustrative of the spirit 
among the descendants of Israel 
when this Rook of Mormon came 
forth among the children of men. 
Even at that time no man, it seems 
to me. acting upon his ordinary 
judgment, would dare say that the 
time would come when they would 
accept that Holy One. but here, two 
thousand years before, a prophet of 
God said the day would come when 
they would no more turn their 
hearts aside from the Holy One, 
and that then he would remember, 
the promises he made to their 
fathers. 

Now the question is : Has that 
day come? That same man who 
heard his teacher say, "Sacrilege. 
Sacrilege !" because a boy happened 
to bring a book containing the name 
of Tesus, said : 

"I began to study his teachings. 
I found what his teachings were — 
purity, humility ; 'Blessed are the 
poor in spirit.! 'Blessed are they 
that mourn.' 'Blessed are the pure in 
heart, for they should ,see God ; 
blessed are the meek, for they shall 
inherit the earth ; blessed are they 
that hunger and thirst after right- 



eousness, for they shall be filled.'' 
And then he proceeds to show how 
Tsrael today is indebted to Jesus the 
Jew. Tn one chapter entitled, "Is 
the Messiah yet to come?" he says: 
"The enlightened Jew says no, but 
the Messianic age is what the Jews 
today are looking forward to." 

And here in that connection let 
me just read one verse from that 
same Mr. Singer : "I regard Jesus of 
Nazareth as a Jew of the Jews, one 
whom all Jewish people" — all Jew- 
ish people ! — "are learning to love. 
His teaching has been an immense 
service to the world in bringing 
Israel's God to the knowledge of 
hundreds of millions of mankind. 
The great change in Jewish thought 
concerning Jesus of Nazareth I can- 
not better illustrate than by this 
fact — " and then he relates the in- 
stance of his childhood, as I have 
read it. 

"Now. it is not strange in many 
synagogues to hear sermons preach- 
ed eulogistic of this Jesus, and no- 
body thinks of protesting. In fact, 
we are all glad to claim Jesus as one 
of our people." 

Boys of latter-day Israel, does it 
not seem that the time has come 
when "their hearts no more turn 
against the Holy One?" It seems 
to me that it has. Then, if so, great 
events are to take place. God has 
said he will remember his promises. 
What are they? Turn to the tenth 
chapter of II Nephi, and there you 
will find that "when the day cometh 
that they believe in me. then shall 
they be restored in the flesh unto 
their own land." In the month of 
December, 1917, General Allenby,of 
the British army, took possession 
of the holy city, Jerusalem. Today 
the Holy Land is practically freed 
from the domination of the Turk, 
and it is under the rule of the Gen-

tile. It was significant that during 
that very month one of the leaders 
of the British parliament, announc- 
in the taking of Jerusalem, also sug- 
gested that it should be made the 
home of the Jews. In that same 
paragraph in II Nephi the prophet 
also added this significant refer- 
ence : "And the Gentiles shall be 
great in mine eyes, because they 
shall be the means of restoring 
Israel unto their lands." As soon, 
practically, as the announcement 
was made by Mr. Balfour, I think, 
that Jerusalem should be held for 
the Jews, a prominent Jew in this 
country wrote an article in one of 
the magazines saying, "We don't 
want to go back to Jerusalem. The 
Holy Land is of such strategic value 
that should the Jews gather there 
and build a Jewish republic, and the 
nations go to war later, we shall be 
crushed as Belgium was crushed in 
this war ;" but he was answered by 
the leaders of the Zionist movement, 
one of whom is Israel Zangwill. the 
author of that most patriotic Amer- 
ican play. The Melting Pot, and 
they said this : "Place the Jewish 
republic under the protection of 
some such nations as Great Britain 
and the United States," and in har- 
mony with that sentiment, June the 
26th of this year, prominent Jews 
held a convention in Pittsburg in 
which it was stated publicly and au- 
thoritatively that at that time fifty 
thousand Jews were with General 
Allenby working for the freedom of 
the Holy Land ; and the Jews who 
stood up in that convention, said : 
"We dedicate the rest of our lives 
to the rebuilding of Jerusalem." 

It is said by some one that we 
cannot see great events when we 
are right close to them, and it may 
be that we are too close to the ful- 
filment of these prophecies to get 



their full significance. However, I 
am sure this morning that we .get at 
least glimpses of their significance. 
This is one thought, then, which I 
desire to give to the boys and the 
eirls of Zion — that ''The providence 
that watches over the affairs of men 
works out of their mistakes at t : mes 
a healthier issue than could have 
been accomplished by their own 
wisest forethought." 

I grant you that the gentile na- 
tion, Great Britain, did not go over 
there to get Jerusalem free for the 
Jews. In this great war they want- 
ed to protect their possessions and 
interests in the far east. That was 
simply a strategic movement in this 
great war, but out of it what has 
come? I myself heard within the 
last month a prominent Jew of our 
own state express to an audience his 
appreciation of what is now dawn- 
ing for his people. "Under the 
storm and the cloud today, and to- 
day the hard peril and pain, tomor- 
row the stone shall be rolled away 
for the sunshine shall follow the 
rain." God's providence will bring 
out of this great conflict blessings 
to humanity of which they scarcely 
dream. 

But in order that they might 
have them and acknowledge them, 
there is a responsibility upon the 
peoples of the earth. Liberty is 
offered them ; and the perfect law of 
liberty, the gospel of Jesus Christ, 
is offered them. In this day, the 
greatest in the world's history, a 
day toward which prophets looked 
with longing hearts, you and I are 
witnesses of the fulfilment, at least 
in part, of God's promises. You 
and I, then, have the responsibility 
if there is anything at all in the 
testimony we bear, of giving to this 
people, not only the Jews, but to 



48 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



the world, the gospel, the .perfect 
law ©f liberty. 

What is our responsibility? I said 
there were two things I would like 
to have the boys think of. One I 
have mentioned ; viz., To read the 
signs of the times and see if they 
cannot discern the existence and 
providence of an allwise Creator. As 
soon as they feel that truth in their 
hearts, and know it, oh, how dis- 
tasteful will sin become to them ! 
What was the other? That they 
might realize that they must set an 
example of purity and chastity to 
the world. I mention this because it 
is the crying- need of the world to- 
day. In this the boys and girls of 
Zion must lead or the world will 
ask you, when you claim that this 
is the gospel, the perfet law of free- 
dom — "what are the fruits of ft? 
What are the fruits?" 

Oh, how my heart warmed yes- 
terday, with yours, when we list- 
ened to President Smith say : "For 
seventy years T have devoted my 
l : fe to this work." T have heard 
him say that what he is, he is be- 
cause of the gospel of Jesus Christ. 
That gospel which can make a man 
of strength, a man of charactei, a 
man of God. such as I bear testi- 
mony to you President Smith is, has 
in it the redeeming power for the 
salvation of mankind. But the 
foundation of growth in this 
Church is purity, with faith in God. 
T am glad that our nation is in part 
fulfiling its mission in sending out 
with the boys the message of purity, 
telling them that though they are 
soldiers, they cannot violate with 
imnunity the principle of chastity. 

Illustrative of this, I read The 
Nurse and the Knight, a little book 
sent bv Corporal Wendell Whitney 
to his father, Elder Orson F. Whit- 
ney, a letter from a Red Cros> 



nurse, in which, in substance, in one 
place she said : 

"First I was in Paris, where the 
wounded came to have their wounds 
dressed. I saw them wash their 
wounds and they were clean. The 
boys seemed to be happy, and look- 
ed with pride and honor upon the 
wounds they had received in a 
righteous cause. Later I was placed 
in an emergency hispital near the 
battle line. There some worse 
cases came, but they too were 
proud. Then later I went to the 
base hospital, part of the trenches, 
and there I saw men with their 
bodies mangled ; I saw in one case 
some German prisoners with their 
legs blr^vn off, but they had their 
hearts, chey had their minds and 
their souls, and they could still live 
and love and think. It was not 
the worst thing I had seen. Then 
there came .some from Verdun, 
where the liquid fire had been blown 
into their faces. They were scarred 
and blind. Oh, it was worse than 
death. Death seemed sweet to those 
others, and this was worse, but it 
was not the worst thing I saw. I 
saw men who were standing there 
by the big guns that were placed 
up by the French to withstand the 
German great guns that were blow- 
ing off the hills of Verdun. When 
they were brought back they were 
mad. But that was not the worst 
thing I saw. When with a Red 
Cross nurse, whose name you have 
seen in the papers, we passed a 
certain hospital there in Paris, she 
said, T can stand everything else 
in this Avar but that,' 'Why, what 
is it?" 'Don't you know?'" 'Why, 
no,' 'Haven't you nursed in there?' 
'No.' 'Then thank God you have 
not had to nurse there. Those are 
the boys who could fight for their 
country, but who could not fight

for themselves. The soldiers whom 
you have nursed with their bodies 
clean, if they died they died in hon- 
or. If they lived they lived in hon- 
or ; but those boys in there, wich 
the poison of sin in their blood, die 
in loathesome horror. If they live 
they live to be a sorrow and a curse 
to those who trust and love them." 

Oh, boys of Zion, can't you ,see 
what the nations need? Will you 
set an example? God help us to 
tell them that the hour of his judg- 
ment is come. God has spoken. 
The .day of Israel is here, and the 
coming- of the Son of Man is not 
far off. How many years it matters 
not. It is near by. We must do 
our part and prepare for it. I pray 
that we may prove worthy sons and 
daughters of Zion, entitled to the 
blessings of Israel, entitled to par- 
ticipate in the great consummation 
of all things in this last dispen- 
sation, and I ask it in the name of 
Jesus Christ. Amen.

The spirit of Anti-christ — Two dia- 
metrically opposed schools of phil- 
osophy concerning the salvation of 
man — One based on individual 
choice, the other ,on force and com- 
pulsion — The spirit of Anti-christ in 
the world today — Proof that it di- 
rects the German people — The ex- 
istence of Christianity is at stake in 
the present world struggle — Anti- 
christ banished, from the earth, the 
former-day Christian Church both 
in the eastern and western conti- 
nents — Our duty is not only to 
make the world safe for Democracy, 
but safe for the true Christianity 
upon which the salvation of the 
world depends. 

I shall read a paragraph from 
the first general ep : stle of Tohn to 
thp Church, from the third verse: 
"Every spirit that confesseth not 



that Jesus Christ has come in the 
flesh is not of God ; and this is that 
spirit of Anti-christ whereof ye 
have heard that it should come; 
and even now already is it in the 
world." 

The scripture which I have read 
makes plain the fact that any spirit 
which assumes the guise of Christ, 
but is in opposition to him, and the 
doctrines which he taught, is Anti- 
christ. Knowledge of the great 
plan of human redemption, and the 
part which was to be taken in it by 
Jesus Christ, did not have its origin 
with the personal appearance of the 
Redeemer and his ministry, in the 
meridian of time. 

Since a very early period of the 
world's historyi presume if we had 
authentic record of it from the very 
beginning, there have existed two 
schools of philosophy, each pur- 
porting to have as its basis the wel- 
fare of mankind while in mortality, 
and his redemption in the life to 
come. The doctrines taught by 
these two schools, while having the 
same purpose in view were dia- 
metrically opposed. 

Upon the one hand it was urged 
that the redemption of the human 
family could best be accomplished 
through an agencv wlr'ch should 
assume responsibility for the life 
and actions of the individual, guar- 
anteeing redemption, and a return 
to the presence of the Creator, with- 
out regard to his conduct while in 
the flesh, the condition being that 
in consideration of salvation the 
individual should render service, 
and acknowledge allegiance to the 
rower thus assuming - responsibility 
for his conduct during his mortal 
life. Tt was, in effect, a plan to 
=ave and redeem mankind, whether 
he .desired and labored for it or not. 

In contrast to this compulsory 



50 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



plan of redemption, and directly 
opposed to it, was the doctrine that 
man. endowed as he is with reason, 
and possessed, in a limited degree, 
with the intelligence of the Creator, 
in whose image he is formed, en- 
dowed with knowledge which en- 
abled him to .discern between right 
and wrong, between good and evil, 
became a responsible agent, and 
that his status in the life to come 
was governed by his conduct while 
in mortality. That in order to at- 
tain to exaltation he must live a 
righteous life, not because he was 
compelled to do so by superior 
force, but because he loved right- 
eousness. In one case it was the 
doctrine of force, of compulsion, in 
the other the voluntary will of man 
to do right for right's sake. 

Christ was the exponent, the em- 
bodiment of the latter idea, and that 
which conflicts with it is Anti- 
christ. A great struggle has al- 
ways existed between these two 
ideas. Systems of religion have 
been evolved which made compli- 
ance with certain rules indispensa- 
ble to the eternal welfare of man, 
and compulsory laws enacted by 
which it was sought to compel com- 
pliance with them, regardless of the 
will of the individual. 

Civil governments have been es- 
tablished in which this doctrine of 
compulsory obedience to law was 
imperative. notwithstanding the 
fact that the individual had no par- 
ticipation in framing the law or its 
administration. It is the principle 
that whoever has the power to im- 
pose his will upon another is justi- 
fied in doing so, that the w r eak have 
no rishts which the strong are un- 
der obligation to respect. 

Opposed to this idea is the doc- 
trine of Christianity, which teaches 
self sacrifice, that the strong should 



not only respect but help the weak, 
that he, too, may become strong, 
that in both civil and religious life 
man .should follow his own inclina- 
tion, framing such laws as seem 
best adapted - to his condition, and 
administering them in his own way, 
worshiping whom or what he may 
desire, or not worshiping at all, but 
with this one fundamental truth 
written in his creed, that whether 
great or small, he has no authority, 
either in civil or religious life, to 
infringe upon the rights of his 
neighbor, or exercise coersion or 
unrighteous dominion over him. He 
must do to others as he would that 
others do to him under like circum- 
stances. 

Exemplifying this doctrine Christ 
testified that he came not into the 
world to do his own will, but the 
will of the Father, who sent him. 
That he came not to seek his own 
aggrandizement, and dominate 
others, but to serve them. Testify- 
ing that he who would be greatest 
in the kingdom of heaven must be 
the servant, not the master, of all. 
_^ In the general epistle to the 
Church, from which I have quoted. 
John warns his brethren to beware 
of any spirit which may come into 
the world teaching .doctrines which 
are contrary to those taught by the 
Redeemer, and declares "that such 
are Anti-christ. The scripture 
warns us to be especially careful in 
the latter days, the dispensation of 
the fulness of times, when we are 
told that this spirit will manifest 
itself. 

I do not think it necessary to en- 
ter into any argument to convince 
this congregation of thoughtful, ob^ 
serving people, that the spirit of 
Anti-christ is in the world todav, 
and js making the greatest effort to 
obtain world dominion, and the

overthrow of Christianity that has 
ever been made since the beginning 
of time. That I may justify this 
assertion permit me to draw the 
contrast between the teachings of 
Christ and the outspoken declara- 
tions and teachings of the men who 
control the lives, and to a great ex- 
tent the thought of the German peo- 
ple, who are in some respects among 
the most civilized people of the 
world. The statement that world 
dominion is sought is justified, it 
appears to me, by the following : 

Carl Peters, in his book, Clear the 
Wax, published in 1915, says: "Not 
live and let live ; but live, and direct 
the lives of others, that is power." 

Baron Von Bernhardi, in his 
book, Germany and the Next V/ar, 
savs : "Might is at once the su- 
preme right, world power or down- 
fall will be our rallying cry." 

Contrast those words with the 
doctrine taught by the Redeemer of 
the world. 

Christ said: "Blessed are the 
peace makers, for they shall be 
called the children of God." 

Husro Mustenberger, in his book. 
The War and America, says: "Ye 
shall love peace as a means to new 
wars, and the short peace more 
than the lonef. Be not considerate 
of thy neighbor. This new table. 
O, my brethren, put I up over you, 
become hard." 

Christ said : "Ye have heard it 
said, thou shalt love thy neighbor 
and hate thine enemy. But I say 
unto you, love your enemies, bless 
them that curse you, do good to 
them that hate you, and pray for 
them that desp : tefully use you." 

When questioned regarding the 
health of his wife, Count Von Bis- 
marck answered : "She is very well, 
only she suffers from her hatred of 
the French, all and each of whom 



she would like to see either shot, or 
stabbed dead, even to the very small 
children." 

Henrich Vieroldt, the German 
poet, answering the recent criticism 
of a Swiss newspaper, which com- 
mented on one of his poems says : 
"If the treasury of the German lan- 
guage contained expressions of hate 
and anger a thousand times 
stronger, I would have hurled them 
in the world's face." 

The Redeemer said : "Blessed 
are the merciful, for they shall ob- 
tain mercy." 

On August 26, 1914, General 
Stenger, commander of the 58th 
brigade, of the German army, issued 
the following order of the day : 
"Beginning with today, no more 
prisoners will be taken. All pris- 
oners are to be put to death. Pris- 
oners even in large units are to be 
put to death. No living man is to 
be left behind us." 

Such teachings, my brethren and 
sisters, can have but one result, a 
result which is expressed by 
Thomas Mann, in the Rund- 
schau, November, 1914, in which 
he says : "Culture is a spiritual or- 
ganization of the world which does 
not exclude bloody savagery. It 
raises the demoniac to sublimity. It 
is above morality, reason, or sci- 
ence." 

It will be observed that the quo- 
tations which I have made, and 
which are but a small part of utter- 
ances of like character which might 
be submitted, are the words of sol- 
diers, statesmen, professors, authors 
and poets, proving that the anti- 
Christian doctrines which are advo- 
cated are not confined to any par- 
ticular class among the German 
people. I do not believe that these 
doctrines are universally accepted in 
Germany ; but, on the contrary, that 



52 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



there are many devout Christians 
there who follow the Redeemer, ac- 
cording; to the light which they pos- 
sess, but that the existence of Chris- 
tianity is at stake in the present 
great struggle, I sincerely believe. 

Those who follow Christ have 
ever traveled over stony paths. He 
was crucified because he taught doc- 
trines which conflicted with the 
selfish ambition of the men who 
controlled the world at the time of 
his coming. Those who believed in 
him were persecuted, driven into 
the dens and caves of the earth, 
until the Church ceased to exist. On 
this continent of ours, to which ref- 
erence has so appropriately been 
made, by preceding speakers, men 
inspired by this same selfish spirit 
sought to, and finally succeeded in, 
destroying Christianity. Let me 
read from the Book of Mormon : 

"And now it came to pass that when 
Moroni, who was the chief commander 
of the Nephites, had heard of these 
dissensions, he was angry with Amal- 
ickiah. And it came to pass that he 
rent his coat; and he took a piece 
thereof, and wrote upon it. In memory 
of our God. Our religion and freedom. 
And our peace, our wives and our chil- 
dren. And he fastened it upon the end 
of a pole, and he fastened on his head 
plate, and his breast plate, and his 
shield, and girded on his armor about 
his loins. And he took the pole which 
had on the end thereof his rent coat, 
(and he called it the Title of Liberty), 
and he bowed himself to the earth, 
and he prayed mightily to his God for 
the blessing of liberty to rest upon his 
brethren, so long as there should a 
band of Christians remain to possess 
the land. For thus were all the true 
believers in Christ, who belonged to 
the Church of God, called by those 
who did not belong to the church. 

"And therefore, at this time Moroni 
prayed that the cause of the Chris- 
tians, and the freedom of the land 
might be favored. And when Moroni 
had said these words, he went forth 
among the people, waving the rent of 



his garment in the air, that all might 
see the writing which he had written 
upon the rent, and crying with a loud 
voice saying: Behold, whomsoever 
will maintain this title upon the land, 
let them come forth in the strength 
of the Lord, and .enter into a covenant 
that they will maintain their rights, 
and their religion, that the Lord God 
may bless them." 

My brethren and sisters, we have 
heard a great deal since, the begin- 
ning of this devastating war, in re- 
gard to making the world safe for 
■democracy. My appeal to you this 
morning is to make the world safe 
for Christianity, for if Christianity 
is safe, then is democracy safe also. 
Then is representative government 
by the people, and for the people, 
safe. Then are the principles of 
charity, and mercy, and justice safe, 
for these, and every other thing 
which the heart of man may desire 
in righteousness are made safe 
when the doctrines taught by the 
Redeemer are acknowledged to be 
the supreme law, and he the Law- 
giver. 

So I appeal to you to reflect, and 
to resolve, in the words of Morom 
which I have read, that so long as 
there is a band of Christians left 
in the world, they will gird on their 
armor, the armor of righteousness, 
that the word of the Lord may be 
advocated in every nation, and if 
necessary the arm of every Chris- 
tian be steeled to fight for the per- 
petuitv of these eternal truths upon 
which the salvation of the world de- 
pends today. God give victory to 
the armies which are fightinsf in de- 
fense of these principles. May he 
p-ive strength to the Latter-dav 
Saints to properly perform their 
part in this great struggle, and 
above all mav he give power to 
spread these truths among all na- 
tions, until the world shall be con-

ELDER JOSEPH F. SMITH, JR. 

A call to repentance — Man's duty fol- 
lowing repentance — Order in the 
government of the Church — Fallac: 
of purported and false visions and 
revelations by lay members for the 
people — Only one man properly 
called and appointed to receive 
revelation for the guidance of the 
Church — The word of the Lord on 
this subject which should set all 
doubts at rest — -When the Elders 
speak by inspiration they speak 
in .order and according to the doc- 
trines and revelations given to the 
Church — Members are entitled to 
know for themselves, by searching 



the revealed word of God — This 
word is not given in a corner ^ut 
openly. 

I trust and pray that I may be led, 
in such remarks as I may make this 
afternoon, by the Spirit of the Lord, 
for I desire, my brethren and sis- 
ters, to speak only that which will be 
in harmony with the word of truth 
as it has been revealed for the salva- 
tion of the children of men. 

I was greatly edified this morning 
by the remarks of the brethren, like- 
wise by the remarks of those who 
occupied the time yesterday. I re- 
joice in a knowledge,such as I have, 
of the truth and a testimony of the 
truth as it has been made known to 
us in the dispensation of the ful- 
ness of times. I will read, with 
your permission, a word or two 
from one of the revelations given 
through the Prophet Joseph 
Smith. This revelation was given 
in the year 1830, in October of that 
year, the portion to which I refer 
reads as follows : 

Yea, open your mouths and they 
shall be filled, saying — Repent, repent, 
and prepare ye the way of the Lord, 
and make his paths straight; for the 
kingdom of heaven is at hand. 

Yea, repent and be baptized, every 
one of you, for a remission of your 
sins; yea, be baptized even by water, 
and then cometh the baptism of fire 
and of the Holy Ghost. 

Behold, verily, verily, I say unto 
you, this is my gospel, and remem- 
ber that they shall have faith in me, 
or they can in no wise be saved. 

And upon this rock I will build my 
Church; yea, upon this rock ye are 
built, and if ye continue, the gates of 
hell shall not prevail against you. 

And ye shall remember the church 
articles and covenants to keep them. 

And whoso having faith you shall 
confirm in my church, by the laying 
on of the hands, and I will bestow the 
gift of the Holy Ghost upon them. 

And the Book of Mormon and the 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Holy Scriptures, are given of me for 
your instruction; and the power of 
my Spirit quickeneth all things. 

Wherefore, be faithful, praying 
always, having your lamps trimmed 
and burning, and ,oil with you, that 
you may be ready at the coming of 
the Bridegroom. 

For behold, verily, verily, I say un- 
to you, that I come quickly. Even so. 
Amen. 

Now I desire to call attention to 
bne or two things in these passages 
of scripture. In the first place in 
order that a man may be saved in 
the kingdom of God he must have 
faith in our Lord and Savior Jesus 
Christ, he must accept him and be- 
lieve that he is indeed the Son of 
God and the Redeemer of the 
world. When he knows that, re- 
pents of his sins, and is baptized 
for the remission of his sins, then it 
is his duty to continue in well doing, 
remembering, as stated here, the 
Church articles and covenants to 
keep them ; and the Book of Mor- 
mon and the Holy Scriptures which 
contain in great part these articles 
and covenants. For the Lord de- 
clares they are given of him for our 
instruction by the power of the 
Spirit which quickeneth all things. 
Now, the book of Doctrine and Cov- 
enants was not mentioned in this 
revelation for the very good reason 
that in the year 1830, in October, 
there was no book of Doctrine and 
Covenants ; otherwise, without a 
doubt, the Lord would have added 
it to these scriptures and would have 
commanded us to search the things 
contained therein which pertain to 
our salvation. Indeed, we may say 
in truth that the revelations in the 
Doctrine and Covenants are in- 
cluded in the holy scriptures, for 
such they are. 

Now, the Lord has revealed un- 
to us in these modern scriptures as 



well as in the scriptures that were 
given in ancient times, the necessary 
articles and covenants by which we 
may be guided and directed in 
church government and understand 
the truth of the gospel. Through 
the faith, diligence and heed we 
give to these instructions, we may 
know that the Lord and Savior of 
this world is indeed our Redeemer 
and the Son of God. We may 
know this provided our studies and 
faithfulness are guided by prayer, 
for in this same commandment, the 
Lord declared that we should pray 
always. "Wherefore," said he, "be 
faithful, praying always, having 
your lamps trimmed and burning, 
and'oil with you." 

I desire to say in connection with 
this which I have read that there is 
no reason in the world why each 
member of the Church should not 
have a thorough understanding of 
the principles of the gospel, of the 
order of the Church, and the gov- 
ernment of the Church, so that none 
need be led astray by any wind of 
doctrine, or notion, that prevails 
among the children of men, which 
may come to their attention. If 
we are firmly grounded in the faith 
and built upon the rock, we will 
know the truth, the truth which will 
make us free. There is a Tying 
spirit abroad in the land. In my 
travels in the stakes of Zion, my 
attention has been called, on a num- 
ber of occasions, to a purported 
revelation or vision or manifesta- 
tion, whatever it may be called, sup- 
posed to have been received by 
President Smith sometime in the 
distant past, in regard to events of 
great importance dealing with the 
nations of the earth and the Latter- 
day Saints. Many things in that 
purported vision, or revelation, are 
absurd. My attention has been call- 



ELDER JOSEPH F. SMITH, JR. 



55 



ed to this thing, and good brethren 
and good sisters have inquired of 
me to know whether or not there 
was any truth in that which had 
come to their attention. It is in 
printed form ; and I have been un- 
der the necessity of telling them that 
there was no truth in it. Then, in 
other places I have discovered that 
people have copies of a purported 
vision by the Prophet Joseph Smith 
given in Nauvoo, and some people 
are circulating this supposed vision, 
or revelation, or conversation 
which the prophet is reported to 
have held with a number of individ- 
uals in the city of Nauvoo. I want 
to say to you, my brethren and sis- 
ters, that if you understand the 
Church articles and covenants, if 
you will read the sciptures and be- 
come familiar with those things 
which are recorded in the revela- 
tions from the Lord, it will not be 
necessary for you to ask any ques- 
tions in regard to the authenticity 
or otherwise of any purported rev- 
elation, vision, or manifestation that 
proceeds out of darkness, concocted 
in some corner, surreptitiously pre- 
sented, and not coming through the 
proper channels of the Church. Let 
me add that when a revelation 
comes for the guidance of this 
people, you may be sure that it will 
not be presented in some mysterious 
manner contrary to the order of 
the Church. It will go forth in such 
form that the people will understand 
that it comes from those who are in 
authority, for it will be sent either 
to the presidents of stakes and the 
bishops of the wards over the sig- 
natures of the presiding authorities, 
or it will be published in some of the 
regular papers or magazines under 
the control and direction of the 
Church or it will be presented be- 
fore such a gathering as this, at a 



general conference. It will not 
spring up in some distant part of 
the Church and be in the hands of 
some obscure individual without 
authority, and thus be circulated 
among the Latter-day Saints. Now, 
you may remember this. 

Again, here is another thought I 
desire to call your attention to, Not 
very long ago a good sister, I sup- 
pose a good sister, one who means 
well, placed into my hands a pur- 
ported vision, or revelation, which 
she claims she received, dealing 
with matters pertaining to the wel- 
fare of the people. Now, the Lord 
is not going to give unto any wo- 
man in this Church a revelation for 
the Church. He is not going to give 
unto any man in this Church, other 
than the one who is properly ap- 
pointed, a revelation for the guid- 
ance of the Church, for everything 
will be done in order. When you 
find good sisters, or otherwise, and 
brethren, circulating revelations or 
manifestations which they them- 
selves have received, you put it down 
that it is contrary to the law and 
the order of the Church and the doc- 
trine the Lord has revealed. In the 
early days of the Church, back as 
early as the year 1831, a woman by 
the name of Hubble claimed to have 
received revelations which caused a 
great deal of confusion among some 
of the members of the Church be- 
cause they did not understand the 
proper order. The Church was 
young, the people who had come in- 
to it were new and untrained so far 
as the gospel was concerned, and did 
not thoroughly understand the order 
of Church government. The wom- 
an was deceiving them. Also on 
another occasion one Hiram Page 
received what he claimed to be rev- 
elations, which he gave forth as 
coming from the Lord for the bene-

GENERAL CONEERENCE. 



fit of the Church, and there was 
necessity of rebuking him. The 
Lord gave a revelation unto the 
Prophet Joseph Smith in February, 
1831. declaring the proper order in 
the Church for the bestowal of rev- 
elation, a few verses of which I w.ll 
read to you : 

O hearken, ye elders of my. church, 
and give an ear to the words which 
I shall speak unto you. 

For behold, verily, verily, T say un- 
to you, that ye have received a com- 
mandment for a law unto my Church, 
through him whom I have appointed 
unto you, to receive commandments 
and revelations from my hand. 

And this ye shall know assuredly 
that there is none other appointed un- 
to you to receive commandments and 
revelations until he be taken, if he 
abide in me. 

But verily, verily. I say unto you, 
that none else shall be appointed un- 
to this gift except it be through him, 
for if it be taken from him, he shall 
not have power except to appoint an- 
other in his stead. 

That provision for the appoint- 
ment of another was never exercis- 
ed, because the Prophet Joseph 
Smith did remain true and stead- 
fast to the end, and there was no 
necessity for the Lord choosing an- 
other to take his place because of 
any transgression on his part. But, 
to continue : 

And this shall be a law unto you, 
that ye receive not the teachings of 
any that shall come before you as 
revelations or commandments. 

And this I give unto you that you 
may not be deceived, that you may 
know they are not of me. 

For verily I say unto you, that he 
that is ordained of me shall come 
in at the gate and be ordained as I 
have told you before, to teach those 
revelations which you have received, 
and shall receive through him whom 
I have appointed. 

And now, behold, I give unto you 
a commandment, that when ye are 



assembled together, ye shall instruct 
and edify each other, that ye may 
know how to act and direct my church, 
how to act upon the points of my law 
and commandments, which I have 
given ; 

And thus ye shall become instruct- 
ed in the law of my Church, and be 
sanctified by that which ye have re- 
ceived, and ye shall bind yourselves to 
act in all holiness before me. 

Now I maintain that there is no 
occasion for any member of this 
Church to have a doubt in his mind 
regarding matters of revelation as 
coming for the guidance of the 
Church, because when such things 
come they will come in the proper 
channels and be presented by those 
who are ordained to this calling and 
who are known to the Church. 
Therefore, when you hear these ru- 
mors, you put it down that they are 
false, and it is absolutely unneces- 
sary for you to ask the question of 
anyone, because you ought to know 
by the inspiration you have your- 
selves whether or not they are true. 

Now, just one more thought. I 
realize this, when the brethren, the 
authorities of the Church, the elders 
of Israel, speak unto the people, and 
the)- have the Spirit of the Lord, 
they speak by inspiration, and, as we 
read in Section 1 of the Doctrine 
and Covenants, when they so speak, 
that which they say is scripture, 
and the Lord will recognize it as 
such, and it is binding upon the 
people when they so speak as if 
he himself spoke unto them ; but 
when they speak unto the people 
by inspiration, as they 'do from 
time to time, it will be in order and 
according to the doctrines and the 
revelations which have been given 
to the Church, so that all who hear 
may understand. 

If we will hearken unto the 
words of the Lord and search for

ourselves and obtain knowledge 
from the Book of Mormon, from 
the Bible, from the Doctrine and 
Covenants, from the Pearl of 
Great Price, and from the instruc- 
tion given us from time to time 
by the authorities of the Church, 
and seek to do the will of the Lord, 
remembering our prayers and our 
covenants before him, we will not 
go astray. 

I wonder, let me say in con- 
clusion, I wonder if we are in- 
deed a praying people. I know that 
many of us pray. I doubt if we all 
do. I rather fear there are some 
among us who have neglected this 
important duty. In regard to this 
there is a statement in Section 68 
of the Doctrine and Covenants that 
I think our attention should be 
called to. The Lord says here 
that it is the duty of parents to 
teach their children the principles 
of the gospel before they reach the 
age of accountability, and among 
other things that they should teach 
them is to observe their prayers ; 
and further on in this revelation we 
find the following: 

And a commandment I give unto 
them, that he that observeth not his 
prayers before the Lord in the season 
thereof, let him he had in remem- 
brance before the judge of my people. 

Now, I say this is a very serious 
thing. We ought to be a praying 
people, and if there are in Zion 
those who do not observe their 
prayers in the season thereof, they 
are amenable to the law of the 
Church and may be brought before 
the judge, or in other words, the 
bishop, and he can try them for 
their fellowship, because the Lord 
himself has declared it in these 
words which I have read unto you. 

Now, let us serve the Lord and 



keep his commandments, labor in 
righteousness, and in all things re- 
member our covenants and look for 
guidance to the captain of the ship, 
and not be led astray by what may 
be purported as having come from 
him when it is done in a corner and 
not openly and above board and 
presented to the Church in the prop- 
er manner. The Lord bless you is 
my prayer in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 

PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 

SPURIOUS REVELATION. 

Again I feel that it is an oppor- 
tunity for me to say a few words. 
This wonderful, mysterious revela- 
tion that I have been said to have 
received a great many years ago, 
was given in French, and I never 
knew but two or three words in 
French in my life ; consequently, I 
could not have been the originator 
of that revelation. I want you to 
understand that. I have denied it, 
I suppose, a hundred times, when I 
have been inquired of about it. It 
was gotten up by some mysterious 
person who undertook, to create 
a sensation and lay the responsibil- 
ity upon me. I am not guilty. 
When the Lord reveals something 
to me, I will consider the matter 
with my brethren, and when it be- 
comes proper, I will let it be known 
to the people, and not otherwise. 

HOW THE "BLACK/' "red" AND 

"white horse" revelation was 
started. 

The ridiculous story about the 
"red horse," and "the black horse," 
and "the white horse," and a lot of 
trash that has been circulated about 
and printed and sent around as a 



58 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



srreat revelation given by the Proph- 
et Joseph Smith, is a matter that 
was trotten up, T understand, some 
ten vears after the death of the 
Prophet Toseph Smith, by two of 
our brethren who put together 
some broken sentences from the 
Prophet that thev may have heard 
him utter from time to time, and 
formulated this so called revelation 
out of it. and it was never spoken 
bv the prophet in the manner in 
which thev have put it forth. It is 
simply false; that is all there is to 
it. 

HOW THE STRANG REVELATION 
WAS CONCOCTEP. 

Tn 1858. I had the privilege of 
traveling throus'h California with 
Charles Weslev Wand ell. a former 
member of the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-dav Saints, and at 
that time also a member of the 
Church. He told me himself, in the 
presence of witnesses, that he wrote 
the document himself on which the 
organization of J. J. Strang was 
founded, and he was never so sur- 
prised as when he found that J. J. 
Strang accented his vagaries for a 
revelation from God, and he had 
onlv laughed at it and repented of 
it ever since. 

HOW MEN MAY KNOW THE TRUTH. 

Now, these stories of revelations 
that are being circulated around are 
of no conseauence except for rumor 
and silly talk bv persons that have 
no authority. The fact of the mat- 
ter is simply here and this. No man 
can enter into God's rest unless he 
will absorb the truth in so far that 
all error, all falsehood, all misun- 
derstandings and mis-statements he 
will be able to sift thoroughly and 
dissolve, and know that it is error 



and not truth. When you know 
God's truth, when vou enter into 
God's rest, you will not be hunt- 
ing after revelations from Tom, 
Dick and Harry all over the world. 
You will not be following the will 
of the wisps of the vagaries of men 
and women who advance nonsense 
and their own ideas. When you 
know the truth you will abide in the 
truth, and the truth will make you 
free, and it is onlv the truth that will 
free vou from the errors of men, 
and from the falsehood and misrep- 
resentations of the evil one who 
lavs in wait to dece : ve and to mis- 
lead the people of God from the 
paths of righteousness and truth. 
God bless you. Amen. 

A trio, "Loyalty," voices selected 
from the choir, was sung. 

ELDER JAMES E. TALMAGE. 

The comprehensiveness of the gospel

I believe that no person who has 
followed the addresses at this con- 
ference can fail to have reflected 
upon the comprehensiveness of the 
rospel of Jesus Christ. The truth 
has been declared unto us in sim- 
plicity and plainness. We have not 
fathered here to listen to fervid ora- 
tory, or impassioned speech, but we 
have heard again and again the 
eternal truth delivered with that elo- 
quence that appeals to the heart in- 
stead of to the ear. We have had 
instructions given unto us relating 
to the affairs of every-day life, go-

ing back into the eternities that pre- 
ceded mortality, and onward into 
the eternities beyond the grave. 

We have learned that the things 
of man shall endure as man endures, 
and that the things of God are eter- 
nal as He is eternal ; that in the 
things and affairs of man the au- 
thority of man is operative, and 
that, in the affairs of heaven, only 
the authority of heaven is valid. 
There is nothing new in this ; it was 
preached in earlier dispensations ; 
and, indeed, has been made known 
to those who would listen, even 
from the time of Adam. I remem- 
ber that on one occasion the Christ 
was particularly emphatic in eluci- 
dation of that eternal truth. There 
came to Him certain hypercritical 
Tews who, not being able to answer 
His doctrine, undertook to find fault 
with some trifles in the life and con- 
duct of His followers, as you mav 
read for yourselves in the fifteenth 
chaoter of Matthew. They came 
asking why His disciples trans- 
gressed the tradition of the elders, 
in that they ate without first wash- 
ing their hands, and the Lord turned 
11 Don them, it seems to me — I be- 
lieve He sometimes became in- 
censed, and if He ever did He was 
incensed on this occasion, for when 
thev asked Him that question He 
said unto them : 

"Why do ye also transgress the 
commandment of God by your tra- 
dition ?" Mark you, not by the law. 
It was no part of the law of Moses, 
the thing that they did, and for 
which He arraigned them. It was 
only their rabbinical tradition, and 
this was it. "For God commanded, 
saying, honor thy father and thy 
mother." And then He went on to 
explain and bring home to them the 
fact that they sanctioned dishonor 
to father and mother: "Ye hypo- 



crites," said He, "well did Esaias 
prophesy of you saying, This people 
draweth nigh unto me with their 
mouth, and honoreth me with their 
lips, but their heart is far from me. 
But in vain do they worship me, 
teaching for doctrines the com- 
mandments of men." 

Then crying out to the multitude 
He said unto them : "Hear and un- 
derstand ; not that which goeth into 
the mouth defileth a man, but that 
which cometh out of a man, this de- 
fileth a man." 

And now for the point I would 
have you specially observe : "Then 
came his disciples and said' unto 
him, Knowest thou that the Phari- 
sees were offended after they heard 
this saying? But he answered and 
said, Every plant which my heav- 
enly Father hath not planted, shall 
be rooted up. Let them alone : they 
be blind leaders of the blind. And 
if the blind lead the blind, both shall 
fall into the ditch." 

"Every plant which my heavenly 
Father hath not planted, shall be 
rooted up ;" and conversely : Every 
plant which our heavenly Father 
hath planted, shall endure. So it is 
with the institutions on earth. Every 
one that has not been formed in ac- 
cordance with the will of God shall 
be rooted up, overthrown, or 
brought into the dust. This is the 
day of commotion. Have you never 
read that all things should be in 
commotion in these the last days? 
This is the day of shaking, when 
everything that can be shaken shall 
be shaken, and only those things 
which are established upon an eter- 
nal foundation shall endure. The 
writer of the epistle to the Hebrews 
understood that principle, as is 
Dlainly set forth in his warning to 
the people : "See that ye refuse not 
him that speaketh" referring to the 



60 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Christ, "For if they escaped not 
who refused him that spake on 
earth, much more shall not we es- 
cape, if we turn away from him that 
spcaketh from heaven : Whose voice 
then shook the earth; but now he 
hath promised, saying, Yet once 
more I shake not the earth only, but 
also heaven. And this word, Yet 
once more signifieth the removing" 
of those things that are shaken, as 
of things that are made, that those 
things which cannot be shaken may 
remain." 

The things of God are not to be 
shaken by the boom of man's great- 
est artillery ; they shall endure in 
spite of bomb and shell. But the 
handiwork of man shall be shattered 
and crushed. So not only all mate- 
rial things, but all man's theories 
and conjectures and philosophy, and 
science falsely so called. One of the 
results of the great conflict into 
which the world is plunged shall be 
the dethronement of German philos- 
ophy, as .well as the overthrow of 
German autocracy, for much of it is 
false and shall not endure. Rio-ht 
8: lad am I that we stand upon the 
rock of revelation, and though the 
rains may beat and the winds may 
blow, we shall not be moved unless 
we get frightened and abandon the 
refuge of safetv, and be swept into 
the whirlpool of man-made doctrine. 
True it is that kingdoms rise and 
fall sometimes by direction, some- 
times by permission of the Lord, by 
allowance, because of His respect 
for higher laws. He will not inter- 
fere with the agency of nations or 
of individuals. 

But I .do not believe that God ever 
planted the plant of tyranny or 
kinerlv despotism. That is a weed 
that He has permited to erow up, 
and vou know how careful He is not 
to prematurely root up, as evinced 



by His own teaching to the people 
in that wonderful parable of the 
wheat and the tares. The impetuous 
disciples would have rushed into the 
field to pluck up the tares, but He 
forbade them, saying, "Let both 
grow together until the harvest," 
and explained to them that any 
forceful extirpation of the tares 
would have imperiled the wheat. 

Never before, since the days of 
the Son of Man in the flesh, has the 
earth been prepared for the kind of 
government that shall be established 
abroad as it has been established 
here. Fifty years ago, twenty years 
aeo, ten years ago, to have attempt- 
ed forcibly to extirpate the weeds of 
autocracv would have imperiled the 
wheat of real democracy. There is 
a wonderful element of timeliness 
in all the doings of God, and He 
doeth all things well, and in the 
right season. 

The gospel of Jesus Christ ^s 
given of God ; it is eternal. Have 
vou ever found a single passage in 
Holy Writ that indicates in the least 
degree any revision or alteration of 
the fundamental laws and principles 
of the gospel? Have you ever found 
it necessarv for God to amend Him- 
self and His words? Men make 
constitutions and enact laws, and 
then have to repeal and alter them, 
but the fundamental laws of truth 
are eternal ; they will never be 
amended, thev will never be 
changed. As declared to Adam, so 
is it declared unto the world todav: 
Fxceot ye have faith in God and in 
His Son Testis Christ, as the one 
and onlv Savior and Redeemer of 
mankind : except ye repent of your 
sins with a real and genuine repent- 
ance ; except ye be baptized by im- 
mersion in water, at the hands of 
one having; authority, and receive 
the gift of the Holy Ghost by the

authorized laying on of hands, there 
is no possibility of your finding 
place in the kingdom of God. We 
look in vain for modification or 
qualification. The gospel is as sim- 
ple today as it ever has been, and it 
will never be less simple. There- 
fore the Church of Jesus Christ, 
which is the earthly embodiment of 
the gospel, the organization through 
which the gospel is to be declared 
to the world, is established in this 
dispensation, for so the Lord hath 
declared, never more to be thrown 
down. You have never learned of 
any revision, amendment to or alter- 
ation in the law of the gospel of 
Jesus Christ, and in the form of the 
Church. Like the gospel itself, the 
Church adapts itself to the necessi- 
ties of the times, to the conditions 
of life, but without the alteration of 
a single vital principle revealed of 
God. 

The world is full of sects and 
churches, and there is scarcely one 
that has not a counterpart in the 
form of a revised or reformed or 
reorganized sect ; but the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is 
no sect. Even its worst and most 
unprincipled critics have never ven- 
tured upon such a palpable false- 
hood as would be the declaration 
that this is a sectarian organization. 
What was it ever dissected from? 
From what other organization has 
it ever been divided? And the 
thought of division, breaking away 
from, is essential to the idea of a 
sect. Now, be it known that the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints is no sect. It is an orig- 
inal creation with the Lord, and 
when reestablished upon the earth in 
this age of the world it was a restor- 
ation. Therefore, if I may be per- 
mitted the paradoxical expression, I 
would say that the concept of a re- 



organized Church of Jesus Christ is 
unthinkable. Such a thing cannot 
be. It would mean that the Lord 
had changed His word, and that 
when He said that this, the restored 
church or kingdom of God should 
nevermore be thrown down, He 
spoke falsely ; that after all, these 
are not the last clays ; that this is not 
the dispensation of the fulness of 
times ; that there is to be another 
restoration. Such contradiction in 
terms my mind is altogether too 
feeble to comprehend. This Church 
will never be reorganized. There 
never will be a reorganized Church 
of Jesus Christ upon the earth. 
There can be none such, except as 
man misuses names. 

My heart and soul are in this 
Church for what it is. I cannot be 
mistaken. I take it to be what the 
Lord has said it is, and if it be not 
that, it is but another deception of 
the devil. But the glorious fact is 
that its fruits are not the fruits of 
deception ; they are love for human- 
ity, reverence for liberty and the in- 
herent rights of men, tolerance for 
another's opinions, as long as he 
does not carry his opinions, if they 
are wrong, too far, so as to infringe 
upon the rights of others. I am 
willing that a man shall believe 
just what he likes, as long as he 
does not try to force his belief upon 
me, if I think he is wrong. 

Now-, in this day of whirl and 
swirl, when all things are in commo- 
tion, and men's hearts are failing 
them, is there no sure anchorage for 
our individual barks? Is there no 
haven of safety to the great ocean 
of unrest? Thank God, we find it 
in His word ; for all that the Lord 
has foretold shall come to pass liter- 
ally and in fulness. To regulate the 
things of God, to administer in the 
ordinances of heaven, requires a 



62 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



power higher than any that man can 
originate or arrogate to himself. 1 
doubt if any one would challenge 
me to serious debate upon that prop- 
osition. Let Caesar regulate the 
things of Caesar, if you will ; but do 
not let Caesar try to administer the 
things of God, for God's house is 
not a house of confusion. Refer- 
ence to this great principle was 
made yesterday. Men may estab- 
lish laws, and so far as they are not 
infringements upon the inherent 
rights of men they are valid and 
must be obeyed by all concerned; 
but no legislature, no parliament, no 
congress created by man, can legis- 
late with regard to affairs beyond 
the grave. As illustrated by the in- 
stance referred to yesterday — the 
covenant of marriage — man may es- 
tablish laws and may perform cere- 
monies of marriage to be of effect 
"until death do you part." Those 
are the very ominous words that oc- 
cur in many prescribed ceremonies. 
But we regard marriage as some- 
thing more than a ceremony. It is 
an ordinance, and that ordinance 
can be administered only by those 
having the authority of God, if it is 
to be in effect beyond the grave. 
And so with every other relation- 
ship that is established by and 
among men. 

Permit me to read to you from 
the 132nd section of the Doctrine 
and Covenants,' wherein the Lord 
says : 

"Behold ! mine house is a house 
of order, saith the Lord God, and 
not a house of confusion. 

"Will I accept of an offering, 
saith the Lord, that is not made in 
my name ! 

"Or, will I receive at your hands 
that which I have not appointed! 

"And will I appoint unto you, 
saith the Lord, except it be by law, 



even as I and my Father ordained 
unto you, before the world was ! 

"I am the Lord thy God, and I 
give unto you this commandment, 
that no man shall come unto the 
Father but by me, or by my word, 
which is my law, saith the Lord ; 

"And everything that is in the 
world, whether it be ordained of 
men, by thrones, or principalities, or 
powers, or things of name, whatso- 
ever they may be, that are not by 
me, or by my word, saith the Lord, 
shall be thrown down, and shall not 
remain after men are dead, neither 
in nor after the resurrection saith 
the Lord your God ; 

"For whatsoever things remain, 
are by me ; and whatsoever things 
are not by me, shall be shaken and 
destroyed." 

Could it be otherwise? Human 
institutions, purely, human institu- 
tions, will end with human life, and 
in and after the resurrection they 
will have no place nor name ; but 
the institutions established by the 
authority of heaven .shall endure, 
and these alone are the things that 
can endure. In the same revelation 
we find this doctrine set forth, with 
which I am sure you are familiar, 
but on which we may well refresh 
our minds, relating to what the Lord 
calls by the comprehensive and sig- 
nificant name of "A new and an 
everlasting covenant." 

"And verily I say unto you, that 
the conditions of this law are these : 
All covenants, contracts, bonds, 
obligations, oaths, vows, perform- 
ances, connections, associations, or 
expectations, that are not made, and 
entered into, and sealed, by the 
Holy Spirit of promise, of him who 
is anointed, both as well for time 
and for all eternitv, and that too 
most holv, bv revelation and com- 
mandment through the medium of

mine anointed, whom I have ap- 
pointed on the earth to hold this 
power, (and I have appointed unto 
my servant Joseph to hold this 
power in the last .days, and there is 
never but one on the earth at a 
time, on whom this power and the 
keys of this Priesthood are con- 
ferred,) are of no efficacy, virtue 
or force, in and after the resurrec- 
tion from the dead ; for all con- 
tracts that are not made unto this 
end, have an end when men are 
dead." 

Is that not consistent with our 
conception of the eternal character 
of the gospel of Jesus Christ? 
Were the power to direct this au- 
thority in operation vested in more 
than one man upon the earth at a 
time, there would be introduced at 
once the possibility of confusion 
and of a conflict of authority. With 
respect to the word of the Lord as 
given unto the people, I do not 
think that you have found any of 
the general authorities of the 
church, of the Council of the 
Twelve or others, who have inde- 
pendently undertaken to give out 
to the people any new revelation in- 
volving vital principles of doctrine 
or practice ; and no one of them 
would think of doing it until it had 
been submitted to the one man who 
holds the keys of that power and 
priesthood here upon the earth at 
this time. God's house is a house of 
order, I repeat. Let us put ourselves 
in order, if there be need of such 
renovation, that we may be fit for 
an abiding place in the Lord's king- 
dom ; for while the Church shall 
never be reformed and reorganized, 
there is need of individual reforma- 
tion in many cases. I trust that we 
shall increase in faith and in works, 
and come to be what the Lord 
would have us be, and serve Him 
with full purpose of heart, that we 



may be ready to go out when the 
cry shall be heard, as soon it shall 
be heard, "Behold, the Bridegroom 
cometh ; go ye out to meet him." 
For such I pray in the name of the 
Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER STEPHEN L. RICHARDS 

The gospel in application — Necessity 
of utilizing all existing organizations 
of the Church — Eminent need of 
counteracting the influences of the 
world — Our opportunity and obliga- 
tion to cultivate the spiritual in 
man — The high mission ' of Amer- 
ica in the world, to be accomplished 
largely as the Church fulfills its 
destiny among God's children. 

Great truths have been declared 
in our hearing at this conference ; 
the eternal principles of the gospel 
have been pronounced with marked 
and impressive emphasis. I have 
been built up in my spirit, and 
stimulated in my resolution to keep 
the commandments of God, and to 
do his will ; and I am certain that 
the feeling that has come to my 
heart has come to the hearts of all 
those who have heard the inspired 
words of this conference. 

The excellent themes of the gos- , 
pel, however, can save the souls of 
men only as they find application in 
their lives. The spiritual refreshing 
that we get from a consideration 
of these great truths cannot be 
effectual in bringing the exaltation 
and the glory that we hope for, un- 
less we incorporate them into our 
lives. I have been thinking, as I 
have listened to the exposition of 
these great principles of truth, how 
it may be possible for the men and 
women here gathered to disseminate 
them in such a manner as to bring 
them home to those who so sorely 
need them, and upon whom the 
Church and the country and all de- 
pend for advancement and progress.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



I have looked through this great 
congregation, and so far as I am 
able to see in to this sea of faces 
there are substantially none of the 
young men to whom our beloved 
Elder McKay addressed his stir- 
ring"- appeal here this morning: T 
can discern scarcely one of the 
whole number present who has not 
reached maturity, whose life and 
habits are not substantially formed, 
and who, according to the best of 
my opinion, is not conducting him- 
self in substantial conformity to the 
principles of the gospel and attempt- 
ing to live according to its teach- 
ings. But we know that there are 
thousands of young men and young 
women in the Church of Christ who 
•do need the refreshing and the up- 
building" which comes from the ex- 
position of these great truths. We 
do know that there are many who 
need to have the word of God 
brought home to them, so that they 
may live according to it and entitle 
themselves to the rich blessings 
which are promised to the faithful 
and the good. Not only do we 
know that there are to be found 
thousands of such young men and 
young women within the Church, 
who are sorely in need of these 
saving gospel principles, but we 
know that there are countless mil- 
lions, both of young and old in the 
world, who need these great truths 
and their adoption in their lives. 
Hence we are confronted with this 
momentous question : how shall we 
perform our service and our obliga- 
tion to those who are not here, and 
who do not come within the sound 
pi the inspired voices which have 
so eloquently and impressively de- 
clared the great truths of the gos- 
pel? 

Some one said yesterday that this 
was a representative gathering. I 
think it is indeed representative, be- 



cause as you look over the faces of 
the men and women here you see 
that they are in the main the officers 
of the Church, the officers of the 
various organizations which make 
up the Church; and it is fortunate 
indeed that these men and women 
come to receive the word of the 
Lord, and are able to carry it back- 
to those whom they represent. We 
have been given these Church or- 
ganizations to provide for all the 
needs of the people. There is the 
great organization of the priest- 
hood, with the various quorums, 
appointed by the Lord. How emi- 
nently proper and fit it is that these 
quorums of the priesthood should 
see to it that the word of God is 
taught to their members, and that 
they use their good offices to see 
that ' these great principles of the 
priesthood and of the gospel of 
Jesus Christ are made applicable in 
the lives of those to whom this dele- 
gation of authority is given. To my 
brethren who preside over these 
quorums I suggest that when they 
go to their homes they try to give 
to those who have not come to this 
great gathering of the Saints, some- 
thing of the Spirit and of the words 
of instruction that have been here so 
forcibly and impressively given. 

Aside from the quorums of the 
priesthood there are the auxiliary 
organizations of the Church, given 
through the providence of the 
Lord as helps to the priesthood, 
for the establishment of his word 
and truth in the hearts of the 
people. These organizations are 
chiefly devoted to the care and nur- 
ture of the young in the principles 
of the gospel. What remarkable 
opportunities we enjoy in these 
splendid organizations, but how 
essential it is that every one of 
them be used to its full extent. To 
my thinking, there has never been 



ELDER STEPHEN L. RICHARDS. 



65 



a time in the history of the Church 
when there was more real need of 
using- these great auxiliary organ- 
izations of the Church to the full 
measure of their capacity, than there 
is today. Our young people are 
surrounded with influences, the like 
of which have seldom, if ever, been 
brought to them in such large meas- 
ure as we see now. Everywhere 
and on every hand come the influ- 
ences of the world. In our schools, 
in the work in which our young 
people engage, in every environ- 
ment of their lives is bo be found 
prominently and predominantly the 
influence of the world. Our schools 
are devoted to tne culture that 
comes to the mind. They do some- 
thing to help improve the bodies of 
the boys and girls, but they elim- 
inate every single thing that would 
contribute to their spiritual growth 
and advancement. They will not 
even permit the reading- of the word 
of God without comment in many 
of them, and they place the ban- up- 
on any teaching that tends to teach 
boys and girls their relationship to 
God, and their true relationship to 
each other. All that partakes of 
the Spirit has been banished from 
the schools. What a great need 
there is for something to take the 
place of this great loss in the edu- 
cational processes of the clay. How 
necessary it is then that the Sunday 
Schools, the Mutual Improvement 
Associations, the Religion Classes, 
and the Primary Associations, re- 
ceive the support and the coopera- 
tive assistance of every man and 
every woman in this Church. 

I tell you, my brethren and sis- 
ters, we cannot hope to counteract 
these outside influences unless we 
unite in bringing to bear upon the 
minds and the hearts and the souls 
of our boys and girls the precious 



influences of the gospel of Jesus 
Christ. We must let them know 
the beauty, the comprehensiveness, 
the desirability of the incorporation 
of these great principles of the gos- 
pel in their lives. We must coun- 
teract this environment. We must 
let them know that the spirit of the 
world will lead them away from the 
Spirit of God, and we must infuse 
into them a testimony of the truth 
of this gospel, and a desire to live 
it and to keep the commandments 
of God. To that end I take it we 
must use the utmost of our endeav- 
or to teach our boys and girls to 
keep themselves ever clean and 
pure and wholesome, so that they 
may be in condition to receive of 
the Spirit of God and a testimony 
of the truth. The Spirit of God 
cannot dwell in unclean persons, 
and whenever our boys and girls 
are permitted to go astray, they 
alienate themselves from this be- 
nign Spirit which keeps them true, 
and which will lead them back into 
the presence of their Father in 
heaven. 

I plead for the young people of 
the Church. We have all the 
agencies that we need. Unlike the 
people of the world, we have every 
organization that is necessary for 
the care and the protection of oUr 
youth. I have heard men and wo- 
men engaged in the social work of 
the world wonder what on earth 
they could do to meet the emer- 
gency that has arisen at this time 
of war, and to provide methods 
and means of protection against the 
ev'ls that . war always brings to 
.people. We have that protection ; 
all of these means are at our dis- 
posal, ami it seems to me that it is 
for us here highly to resolve that 
each and every one of us, as the 
representatives of the people of 



66 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



God, will use our best effort, will 
■devote ourselves and lend ourselves 
to the great task of keeping our 
boys and girls free from the influ- 
ences of the world, and of implant- 
ing in their hearts the sacred prin- 
ciples of truth which have been 
enunciated here at this great con- 
ference of the Church. 

No man can do a bigger thing, 
nor a better thing in this world, 
than to save his fellowmen. No 
man can do a bigger job than to 
teach boys and girls the principles 
of truth. We are essentially a 
great body of teachers. We ought 
to devote ourselves to our callings. 
We ought to equip ourselves with 
everything that we can get in order 
to help us counteract the evils that 
come into our midst, and to keep 
our boys and girls true. We have 
heard, in a most impressive way, of 
the destiny of America. We believe 
that which has been said. We all 
know that this is the land of Zion, 
and that from this great country 
shall go forth the saving principles 
of liberty and freedom to the ends 
of the earth. 

Is it presumptuous to say that 
this great land of America can only 
accomplish its high mission in the 
world, just to the extent that the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints accomplishes and ful- 
fills its great destiny among God's 
children ? I believe it to be the 
truth. I believe that right here is 
the nucleus of the great principles 
of the gospel of Jesus Christ, that 
must spread out from these moun- 
tain valleys into this gxeat land of 
America, and from thence to the 
very remote corners of the earth, in 
order that people may be given the 
opportunity of embracing the gos- 
pel of Christ, which is the true law 
of liberty. God help us, my breth- 



ren and sisters, to so live this gos- 
pel that the sermon of our lives 
shall preach it everywhere we are 
known and (spoken of, and help 
us to protect ourselves against the 
incursion of the follies and the sins 
of the world, to keep ourselves im- 
maculate and spotless before God, 
that his Spirit may be with us and 
go out from among us. These are 
the desires of my heart, and I be- 
lieve that they are the desires of 
the men and women who are here 
assembled. May we all go forth 
and keep the commandments of 
God, and teach our children in 
their homes and the organizations 
of the Church the truth of the ever- 
lasting gospel, and prevail upon 
them to live clear and free from 
the sins of the world, I humbly 
pray, in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

Edna Gottberg sang the sacred 
solo, "I will lift up mine eyes to 
the hills," Psalm 121. 

Announcement was made of the 
holding of overflow meetings to-

THIRD DAY. 



Conference continued in the Tab- 
ernacle, Sunday, October 6, 1918, 10 
o'clock a. m., President Joseph F. 
Smith, presiding. 

The great congregation, filling 
every available space, was called 
to order by President Joseph F. 
Smith. 

The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn, "Come, let us anew our 
journey pursue." 

Elder Arthur Winter, offered 
prayer. 

The hymn, "Sweet is the peace 
the gospel brings," was sung by 
the choir. 

President Joseph F. Smith said: 
"I understand there are 42 mem- 
bers of our choir, many of them 
among the best of our singers, who 
are now in the military service of 
the United States." He also an- 
nounced the overflow meetings in 
the /Assembly Hall ; and at the Bu- 
reau of Information, the weather 
permitting. 

ELDER RICHARD R. LYMAN. 

Why should we come together, so 
often in worship? — Purpose of meet- 
ing is to learn to do better — The 
lesson of the Pharisee — The funda- 
mental make-up of Government and 
Church is their sons and daughters 
— To make good men and women of 
them is an end for which we strug- 
gle — An example of missionary 
work — Importance of the greatest 
Church and Nation — A letter from 
which may be learned how more 
successfully to teach — Institutions 
in which the Latter-day Saints have 
aid in teaching their children. 

I certainly desire that while I 
stand before th ; s great congrega- 
tion, the words I speak mav be 
prompted by that same excellent 



spirit which has directed the other 
utterances of this conference. 

It seems odd that we should meet 
together so frequently and should 
have such tremendous interest in 
this one subject — the gospel of 
Jesus Christ. The reason we are 
not weary from this repetition is 
that the gospel of Jesus Christ is 
classic. A classic grows better and 
dearer and sweeter with repetition, 
"it is always new and incapable of 
growing old." 

As I see these presidents of stakes 
their counselors, their bishops of 
wards and counselors, high coun- 
cilors and other leading Church 
men sitting here day after day 
listening to the teachings of the 
servants of our Father in heaven, 
and realize what important elements 
they are in a business and financial 
way, in their respective com- 
munities, I appreciate that they 
regard, as do we all, these meetings, 
these conferences, this worship of 
ours, as of first importance. What 
are we struggling for ? We are aim- 
ing to reach perfection. We sang 
it yesterday in that glorious hymn : 
"Thus on to eternal perfection, the 
honest and faithful will go." 

It was intimated yesterday by one 
speaker that perhaps all of us are 
not living in strict conformity with 
some of the teachings and practices 
of the Church. It was said, with 
regret, that some of the members 
of the Church may not be prayerful. 
Perhaps some do not pray in secret, 
and there may be some who do not 
pray with their families. Why is it 
necessary that we should pray in 
secret and that frequently? Why is 
it necessary that we should pray 



68 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



With our families? Why is it 
necessary that we should come to- 
gether so often to worship?, The 
reason is because we are clothe;! 
upon with mortality. We all have 
tremendous imperfections. We all 
have shortcoming's and weaknesses 
to overcome. We pray in secret, 
we pray with our families, we go 
to our places of worship, we come 
together as we have met this morn- 
ing to worship in order that we may 
become perfect, even as our Father 
in heaven is perfect. When we go 
from this building, this conference 
will not have been a complete suc- 
cess if as a result of it we say only 
in our hearts, "How well the breth- 
ren have spoken." We should leave 
this service with bowed hea r1 s think- 
ing. These meetings should make 
us all reflect and resolve anew to be 
better. This lesson is beautifully 
and forcefully taught by the fol- 
lowing familiar but classic lines 
from the scriptures : 

Two men went up into the temple 
to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the 
other a publican. 

The Pharisee stood and prayed thus 
with himself, God, I thank thee, that 
I am not as other men are, extortion- 
ers, unjust, adulterers, or even as this 
publican. 

1 fast twice in the week, I give tithes 
of all that I possess. 

And the publican, standing afar off, 
would not lift up so much as his eyes 
unto heaven, but smote upon his 
breast, saying, God be merciful to 
me a sinner. 

And the great Master said : 
I tell you, this man went down to 
his house justified rather than the 
other; for every one that exalteth him- 
self shall be abased; and he that hum- 
bleth himself shall be exalted. 

Here in humility we are studying, 
teaching, learning, helping one an- 
other to be perfect in accordance 



with the teachings of the gospel of 
Jesus Christ. We believe in being 
honest. Are we honest? We be- 
lieve in being true. Are we true? 
We believe in being chaste. Are we 
chaste? We believe in being benev- 
olent. Do we love the unfor- 
tunate, do we feed the hungry? do 
we clothe the naked ? do we visit the 
widows and the fatherless? We 
believe in .doing good to all men. All 
these teachings are a part of the 
gospel of Jesus Christ. Until we are 
able to love perfectly in accordance 
with it, we have reason to meet, we 
have reason to pray, we have reason 
to worship, we have reason to par- 
take of the sacrament. All these 
things we aim to do that we may 
finally be perfect, even as our Father 
in heaven is perfect. 

The gospel of Jesus Christ — it in- 
cludes every earthly and heavenly 
thing that is good for man. Every 
rule, every teaching, every philoso- 
phy, every principle, that lifts man 
up, that makes him strong, that 
makes him better, that makes him 
Godlike — all these things belong to 
the gospel of Jesus Christ. That we 
may more nearly live in accordance 
with it is the purpose of our meet- 
ing. If here or elsewhere, in any 
philosophy, or in any science, there 
"is anything virtuous, lovely, or of 
good report, or praiseworthy," 
whether it be in our own country, or 
any other country, whether it be in 
our own or any other church, we. 
Fatter-day Saints, seek for these 
things. 

In our great democratic govern- 
ment, the fundamental element in 
its makeup is its daughters and its 
sons. In this Church of ours, in 
our own families, the fundamental 
element is also our daughters and 
our sons. To make these men and 
women truly good, truly wise, •

truly Godlike, is one of the ends.for 
which we struggle. The spirit of 
the gospel of Jesus Christ tends to 
lift men up — to make them stronger 
and better. Nor are our labors con- 
fined to our own families. We do 
missionary work with our friends 
and with our associates and with 
our neighbors. 

Only a little while ago I sat dur- 
ing an evening with a man who is 
comparatively old. He said that 
one of the traveling brethren of the 
Church came to him when he was 
a young man, and he said, "I will 
never forget the lessons he taught 
me." He came into my place in the 
early evening; and explained that 
he was to leave at five o'clock the 
next morning, but he said, 'I want 
to talk to you. I want to teach you. 
I want you to know the gospel of 
Jesus Christ. I want you to be a 
man. I want you to be clean. I 
want you to read the scriptures, I 
want you to be familiar with the 
life and teachings of Jesus of Naz- 
areth. 

"He not only pleaded with me for 
one hour or two hours, but all night 
long. At five o'clock in the morning 
his team came and he drove away 
without having- taken off his coat 
or his shoes. He would not be sat- 
isfied until I told him that I would 
give the matter serious considera- 
tion, and if upon investigation I 
found these things as he represented. 
I would be willing to lay my work 
aside and go into the mission field 
and teach others. He came to me 
thus earnestly when I was a boy, 
and he made me a man. He taught 
me to look towards the rising sun. 
He gave me art ambition. He taught 
me to be clean. 

"I have introduced you to my 
sons and to my daughters, to my 
sons-in-law and my daughters-in- 



law and you have ,seen my grand- 
children. For these, for the example 
I have set them, I am indebted to 
the man who labored so earnestly all 
night long to induce me to take a 
mission. If some degree of success 
is coming to my children and you 
can see that it is, I feel sure, that it 
is to a degree because of, and not 
in spite of, the life of their father." 
This is an example of the intense 
missionary spirit — the desire to do 
good to others — that fills the hearts 
of faithful Latter-day Saints. 

The important element in the 
Church, in the Nation, in the family, 
as I have said already, is our 
daughters and our sons. We want 
them to be true, we want them to 
be good, we want them to be vir- 
tuous. We are meeting here, we are 
uniting our hearts, we are uniting 
our faith in prayer to our Father in 
heaven that he will give us the 
power to bring them up as they 
ought to be brought up. O, that we 
had the faith, O, that we had the 
power, O, that we had lived the life 
that would bring such faith that we 
could know that those who have 
gone abroad, would come back to 
us clean, noble, men of God, pro- 
tected bv his Soirit from every 
harm ! Who is there here that has 
alwavs prayed, who is there here 
that has alwavs had the faith, who is 
there here that alwavs partakes of 
the sacrament worthilv, and there- 
fore has the right to expect such a 
blessing? Who is there here that 
deserves to have the life of his son 
nreserved bv the power of God? 
Being mortal we each and all have 
reason to .smite upon our breasts 
and exclaim, "Father, have mercv on 
me s sinner." We are struggling 
for the good, for the salvation, for 
the education, for the progress, of 
our daughters and our sons. In this 



70 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



great struggle we need our heavenly 
Father's help. 

I have in my hands a recent num- 
ber of The Outlook. In it is a letter 
written by a father to his soldier 
son. From this letter, some of us 
may perhaps learn how, more suc- 
cessfully to teach our own sons. — I 
quote with a few slight changes the 
following portions of the letter. 

My son, hold fast always to the 
grand old Anglo-Saxon ideals of per- 
sonal chastity. So live, that when you 
return, you will not have to turn away 
from your mother's or your sister's 
kiss. 

The part religion will play in all 
these things of which I. have written, 
I shall not amplify, but only remark, 
it needs all the assistance of a super- 
natural faith, a faith in God, to keep 
most of us, all the time, up to the 
level of our possibilities." 

We pray, we fast, we partake of 
the sacrament, — we live the lives of 
Latter-day Saints so as to have this 
faith. 

T have written you a long letter; 
but, as I see before me on my table 
this portrait of a boy in uniform who 
is taller than his father, and, thank 
God, better equipped for life and fitter 
to command men and himself, I have 
been moved to go on and on to the 
point of tedium. Let me whisper a 
secret. While it has tickled my vanity 
to know how proud you are of your 
father's little successes, and while this 
has been a real spur to me, yet all 
the while I know, and so should you, 
that you, my son, are my real success. 
Every line of your clean, strong body, 
every expression of your alert, steadv 
mind, has been to me a joy beyond all 
rewards of money or distinction or 
service. I suppose children never 
can know until too late what they 
mean to parents. If this letter were 
not already so long, I could tell you 
tales of men known to me personally 
and to the whole world, who would 
gl?dly give every dollar they possess 
and every shred of fame, if their sons 



were only honorable, useful, and noble 
men. I blush to think how often I've 
boasted of you, my boy. All that ever 
I dreamed of doing or being I know 
you will accomplish, if you come 
through this war alive. 

As for that, it is in the hands of you 
and God. Remember there are a 
thousand things worse than being 
dead. I know you will never take an 
ignoble chance to live or refuse a 
noble chance to die. Either would be 
sorrow's crown of sorrow to your 
mother and me, who have poured into 
your life more than you can ever sur- 
mise — more, even, than we possessed, 
it seems — of high purpose and expecta- 
tion and patriotism. You are the 
flower and fruit of our life; therefore, 
we thank God daily that you are a 
good soldier of the world's welfare 
and of the American flag. 

We have in the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints our Re- 
ligion Classes, the Primary Associa- 
tions, the Mutual Improvement As- 
sociations and the Sabbath-Schools, 
all devoted to the training of our 
boys and girls. In these we strug- 
gle, we try, we pray, we fast, we 
teach, we partake of #ie sacrament, 
and we worship, in the hope that 
our Father in heaven will bless us 
with wisdom to so bring up our 
daughters and our sons that to us, 
to him, to the Church, and to the 
country, they will be a credit.

ELDER HYRUM G. SMITH. 

(Presiding Patriarch of the Church.) 

I am grateful for another priv- 
ilege of meeting with the Latter- 
day Saints in general conference, 
and trust that while I stand before 
you I may be blessed with that 
same sweet spirit which has ac- 



ELDER HYRUM G. SMITH

companied my brethren who have 
already spoken to you. I know 
•that our Father in heaven is kind 
and merciful unto us, and that he, 
like all natural fathers, is grieved 
when he hears his children cry in 
distress. He is also grieved when 
he sees his children suffering be- 
cause of their sins or their weak- 
nesses. Our Father in heaven, 
like our fathers in the flesh, loves 
to see our purity and our good 
lives, our good examples ; he loves 
to see us grow in good and in do- 
ing good. 

In section 1 of the Doctrine and 
Covenants, we read these distinctive 
words : 

"For I the Lord cannot look upon 
sin with the least degree of allow- 
ance; 

"Nevertheless, he that repents and 
does the commandments of the Lord 
shall be forgiven." 

Now, he does not say how soon 
that forgiveness shall come, but 
does make it plain that he will for- 
give those who repent and keep the 
commandments of the Lord. 

T have been very much blessed 
and edified in the instructions of 
the general authorities of the 
Church, and in their remarks con- 
cencerning the holy priesthood and 
the officers therein. I desire to add 
my testimonv concerning the faith- 
fulness of the brethren and sisters 
who are called into positions of re- 
sponsibility throughout the stakes 
and wards of Zion, for we have men 
and women who love the Lord, who 
love to obey his commandments, 
and are receiving his mercies and 
favors in their labors, in their 
homes and in their ministry among 
the people ; and those who are cry- 
ing unto the Lord, or those who 
are suffering in sorrow or sin are 



but few. We have also discovered 
beauty and harmony in the organ- 
ization of the Church. We find 
here the order of which the Lord 
has spoken, the different officers of 
the holy priesthood, from the low- 
est to the highest, and each one 
knows his place and his duties. 
The deacon knows his place, the 
teacher knows his, the priest, his, 
and so on up the scale in the priest- 
hood. 

Elders know their places and 
their duties. Many, of them go 
abroad in the earth preaching the 
gospel, baptizing honest and con- 
verted souls into the fold of Christ. 
They do not do these things just 
because they have the priesthood, 
but because they have been given 
special appointment and they are 
working in the order which has 
been appointed unto them. Going 
on up the ladder in the priesthood, 
we have other officers who labor 
not only because they have, been 
given an office of. power and au- 
thority, but because they have been 
called and appointed and given a 
particular field of labor. We have 
bishops who preside over wards. 
Each one presides over the partic- 
ular ward which has been ap- 
pointed unto him. He does not pre- 
side everywhere just because he is 
a bishop. Neither does the elder 
labor everywhere just because he is 
an elder, but he labors only in the 
field appointed unto him. 

We have in the Church a num- 
ber of men who have been called 
and ordained to administer bless- 
ings unto the people, blessings of 
comfort, blessings of prophecy, 
when they are directed so to do. 
These men are given an office in 
the priesthood, and just because 
they have this office, it does not 
mean that they can bless every- 



7 2 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



where and everybody, but, like the 
bishops, elders, and other officers in 
the priesthood, they are given their 
particular field of labor. So we 
would have the Latter-day Saints 
understand that in the Church, which 
is a part of the kingdom of God, 
there is order, and the officers of 
the priesthood are the men who 
should establish and maintain this 
order in the Church, that the work 
of the Lord may go on with his 
blessings upon it. There a|re a 
number of members of the Church 
who go about from place to place, 
from one ward and from one stake 
to another, seeking their blessings, 
which may be permissible if done in 
strict accordance with the estab- 
lished order of the Church ; other- 
wise they are out of order. If they 
have a righteous purpose, a right- 
eous desire, it is their privilege to 
secure their blessings from the 
Lord at the hands of the brethren 
who are ordained to the office of 
patriarch ; but I would like to ad- 
monish my brethren and sisters not 
to seek blessings of men only, but 
seek the blessings of the Lord at 
the hands of his authorized ser- 
vants. It does not matter particu- 
larly who the man is, if he holds the 
keys to your blessing's, and if you 
live in his stake or in his field of 
labor, he is authorized to adminis- 
ter unto you the blessings of the 
Lord. 

I trust, my brethren and sisters, 
that we shall all receive our bless- 
ings, and that we shall understand 
that they are predicated upon obe- 
dience to the law of the Lord. The 
Lord has made the laws upon which 
our blessings are predicated, and if 
we observe those laws then the 
Lord is bound, he says, and we shall 
receive the blessing ; but if we have 
committed sins which are displeas- 



ing before the Lord, if we have 
broken his commandments, we may 
deceive his servants here upon the 
earth, we may deceive the bishops, 
the presidents, the patriarchs, or 
other servants of God, perhaps may 
secure the words of a blessing, but 
the Lord who gave the command- 
ment, who knows the law, who 
knows our sins, will not give the 
blessing until we have rendered 
obedience unto the law upon which 
it is predicated. So that, though it 
may be possible for us to deceive 
our fellowmen, let us not think that 
we can deceive the Lord ; for he 
knows our hearts, our desires, our 
deeds, and will reward us day and 
night, year in and year out, ac- 
cording to our faithfulness in ob- 
serving" his commandments as they 
have been given unto us. 

So let us, brethren and sisters, 
learn the law r s upon which our 
blessings are predicated, and then 
render obedience unto them. Then 
our promises will be sure and we 
will not have to practice deception 
in any way to get a blessing which 
might otherwise be withheld from 
us. 

The Lord desires to bless his 
children, he has in store every bless- 
ing that is needful for the faith- 
ful ; and, as his servant, I invoke 
his blessings upon you, my breth- 
ren and sisters, and upon the faith- 
ful Latter-day Saints throughout 
the world, whether they be gath- 
ered here, or whether they be in 
their homes abroad, I invoke the 
blessings of God upon them all. 

I pray that the Lord will continue 
to bless his servants whom he has 
called to hold positions of responsi- 
bility in his Church; that he will 
continue to heal up the body of our 
dear president, that he will comfort 
and sustain him and preserve him 



ELDER CHARLES IV. NIBLEY.

yet many years to live with us in 
usefulness according to his desires, 
to teach us both by his word and by 
his deed, as he has done so nobly 
in the past seventy years. We love 
him and we know the Lord loves 
him. We cannot hold up before 
our Father in heaven a more no- 
ble example of faithfulness in all 
the history of the Church. And 
so I pray with you, my brethren and 
sisters, that the Lord will continue 
to remember him, and also his as- 
sociates in the holy priesthood and 
in the organizations of the Church, 
down to the least and Hast one 
called, that the work of the Lord 
may continue to grow in the earth. 
I also pray and invoke the blessings 
of the Lord upon good governments 
throughout the world, upon those 
who are called to establish good 
governments, that these may be es- 
tablished as this government was 
established, under the power and 
influence of the Holy Spirit. 

God bless you, my brethren and 
sisters ; God bless all faithful Lat- 
ter-day Saints, and the honest in 
heart in all the world, that the truth 
may be learned and obeyed, that 
God's purposes may be brought to 
pass, that peace again may soon 
come to the world ; and I pray for 
these blessings and invoke them up- 
on us all in the name of the Lord 
Jesus Christ. Amen. 

Iniz Robinson, of the California 
mission, sang a sacred solo, en- 
titled, "My Fa : th in Thee." 

ELDER CHARLES W. NIBLEY. 

(Presiding Bishop of the Church.) 

This is a duty from which I nat- 
urally shrink. To address so large 



a congregation as I see before me, 
rather fills my spirit with awe. 
Nevertheless, I am glad to meet 
with you and to try to fulfil the 
duties always that are assigned me 
in the Church. 

I see nothing but good ahead for 
Israel, for the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints. The 
Church is increasing, I believe, in 
every way — increasing in numbers 
and increasing also in faith and 
good works. Surely this is a day 
when our faith should be made 
stronger, when we see what is 
transpiring in the world and what 
is being brought to pass ; this day 
when thrones are tottering and fall- 
ing ; when abdications of kings and 
kingly powers are taking place 
when everything is in commotion 
and when men's hearts are failing 
them for fear of the things that 
are coming or transpiring upon the 
earth. 

I do not see how it could be other- 
wise than that our faith in the Lord 
and in the gospel of Jesus Christ 
should increase. The Church 
from the beginning has grown, not- 
withstanding the terrible oppos : - 
tion of ignorance, chiefly ignorance ; 
the opposition, too, of maliciousness, 
wickedness, persecutions which it 
endured until very recent years, 
and which was so pronounced 
against it by all people misin- 
formed concerning it. 

During the fourteen years in 
which the Prophet Joseph Smith led 
the Church, it increased, notwith'- 
standing the malicious and wicked 
opposition that he encountered and 
that the Church encountered under 
his presidency. During the thirty- 
three years that President Young 
led the Church, notwithstanding its 
trials and tribulations, it increased 



74 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



in a wonderful way — a marvelous 
work and a wonder. In the ten 
years that President Taylor pre- 
sided over the Church, the Church 
still continued to grow and increase ; 
and during the ten years or so of 
President Woodruff's presidency, 
and the three or four years of 
President Snow's presidency, mak- 
ing seventy-one years of growth of 
the Church in all ; during the presi- 
dency of these brethren whom I 
have named, it grew and increased 
all the time. During the Presidency 
of President Smith, which will be 
seventeen years now in a few days, 
the Church has doubled in numbers 
and has more than doubled in 
wealth ; that is to say, the member- 
ship of the Church has increased 
to as large a number as the member- 
ship of the Church was after a 
growth of seventy-one years during 
the presidency of the former five 
presidents of the Church, and dur- 
in that seventeen years the Church 
has more than doubled in wealth 
and in the payment of tithes. So 
that I see nothing but growth and 
good and development and spread- 
ing abroad and the fulfilling of the 
mission of this Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints. Why 
should it not grow? Has God not 
spoken ? 

I sat here this morning looking 
at this vast congregation, and I 
said to mvself, "Why are we here? 
Why am I here?" Well, the ans- 
wer came to my mind in this way. 
If Joseph Smith had not declared 
that he had a manifestation of the 
Father and the Son and a visita- 
tion from them, and that he had 
conversed with the Father and the 
Son, the Almighty God and Jesus 
Christ, his Son, the Redeemer of 
the world; that he had seen them 
and talked with them and been in- 



structed by them ; I would not have 
been here. It is because of that 
vision that I am here, that my par- 
ents received of that truth, believed 
it, accepted it with all their hearts, 
and for that reason primarily, 
fundamentally, I am here in this 
conference this morning. If the 
Book of Mormon had not been re- 
vealed in the marvelous and miracu- 
lous way that it was, I would not 
have been here today. This wonder- 
ful gathering of Latter-day Saints 
that we see here today and which 
gathers here for every semi-annual 
conference, would not ,so gather and 
we would not behold the spectacle 
that we do in this congregation, had 
it not been that the Lord spoke ; the 
Lord manifested himself ; the Lord 
sent angels to reveal his gospel, to 
reveal the Book of Mormon — a 
most wonderful and marvelous 
manifestation. Something to lay 
hold of from the Lord, is the Book 
of Mormon. As the tablets of 
stone with the Ten Commandments 
handed down to Moses became 
something real and personal in the 
way of manifestation to the people, 
so also the Book of Mormon, hand- 
ed down in the miraculous way that 
it has been, is real and something 
tangible for us to take hold of and 
believe. If it is not true, what is 
it? Where did it come from if it 
is not true? If its origin is not 
what it proclaims it to be "then what 
is its origin? It is there and can- 
not be explained away as I see it, 
only by accepting the truth; only 
by accepting the statement made by 
the Prophet concerning its origin. 

We all know of the witnesses to 
it. Three men testified to it ; truth- 
ful men, that God Almighty sent 
down an angel to reveal and testify 
to them of its truth, and their testi- 
mony stands ; it cannot be impeach- 



ELDER CHARLES W. NIBLEY.

ed. Had Joseph Smith, in company 
with these three witnesses, framed 
up a story to delude and defraud 
and ensnare the world, it would 
have been quickly exposed, for the 
reason that these witneses, one and 
all of them, became bitter enemies 
of the Prophet Joseph Smith and 
were cut off from the Church. Now, 
would not they have said, "We 
have been trying to palm off some- 
thing on the world which is fraudu- 
lent, which is not true, which is 
false?" These three men became 
bitter enemies of the Prophet; they 
were cut off from the Church, as I 
remember, in 1838. Oliver Cow- 
dery lived for ten years out of the 
Church ; in 1848 he was rebaptized 
as a member of the Church, and 
I believe died in that year. Dur- 
ing that ten years he was at enmity 
with the Prophet Joseph Smith and 
with the Church, now, wouldn't he 
have denounced the thing as a fraud 
and set himself straight before the 
world by publishing to all the world 
that he had made a false statement 
concerning the Book of Mormon, if 
his testimony had not in the first 
place been absolutely true? 

David Whitmer lived some forty- 
three years after he was cut off 
from the Church in 1838 and never 
rejoined it. In 1878, the late Elder 
Orson Pratt and President Joseph 
F. Smith, who is with us today, 
visited David Whitmer at his home 
in Richmond, Missouri. That was 
forty years after David Whitmer 
had been cut off from the Church. 
David Whitmer at that time was in 
the possession of his faculties, clear 
and keen. A number of his relatives 
and immediate friends who were not 
members of our Church, were called 
into his room and sat in it with 
Elder Pratt and President Smith, 
and then and there David Whitmer 



retold the story of the visit of the 
angel to him and of the voice of 
God affirming that the Book of 
Mormon is true. For forty years 
this man, David Whitmer, had been 
out of the Church, estranged from 
it, he was never reconciled to the 
Prophet Joseph Smith. Don't you 
think that if he had been mistaken 
as to seeing and hearing an angel 
and hearing the voice of God, would 
not he .in all that time have roused 
himself and said, "This thing is a 
fraud ; Joseph Smith was not a true 
Prophet ; our testimony concerning 
the Book of Mormon is false." But 
during all that time, notwithstand- 
ing his enmity to the Church, his 
ill-feeling toward the Prophet, he 
not only did not deny his testimony 
concerning the Book of Mormon 
but affirmed and reaffirmed it time 
after time, and this latter time that 
I speak of, in 1878, he affirmed it in 
the strongest possible manner in the 
hearing of Elder Orson Pratt and 
President Joseph F. Smith and a 
room full of non-"Mormon" friends, 
who were there and heard him. He 
declared to them all that his testi- 
mony was true, the God's truth ; 
that he did see and hear the angel 
of the Lord, and that he did hear 
the voice of the Lord from Heaven, 
and that his testimony concerning 
the Book of Mormon must stand as 
the truth forever. 

And Martin Harris, the third wit- 
ness, the same. I heard Martin 
Harris in 1870 stand right here on 
this stand, and although he had been 
out of the Church for thirty-two 
years, yet he came back and stood 
here, and . I heard him testify that 
his witness to the divinity of the 
Book of Mormon was true before 
God. 

Can you anywhere in all the world 
get such convincing and unim- 



76 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



peachable testimony? No, you can't. 
Well, that is why I am here; that 
is why you are here ; that is what 
brings these people together. 

The Lord has manifested by the 
power of the Spirit the truth of his 
work, and that with this work he 
has conferred upon this Church 
divine authority, given to his priest- 
hood. He has conferred upon it 
authority to act in his name so that 
whenever an elder of this Church 
shall take a man down into the 
water and baptize him he does it by 
the authority of God and that or- 
dinance is recognized by God the 
Eternal Father. And when the el- 
ders lay hands upon him and say 
unto him, "Receive ye the Holy 
Ghost," he receives the Holy Ghost. 
That divine authority is here and it 
is nowhere else in all the world than 
here. What ! Do you mean to say 
the Lord does not operate with any 
other people, only the small number 
of Latter-day Saints who are in the 
world? Oh, no! Oh, no! The Lord 
is operating all over the world by 
his power and manifesting it, oh, 
so gloriously these days in the bat- 
tles that are going on. The Lord 
is there to see — to see what? To 
see that right shall triumph and that 
freedom shall obtain. The Lord re- 
veals himself to the world in many 
ways. One of the old prophets de- 
clared that in the last days the Lord 
will pour out his Spirit upon all 
flesh. That means Chinese, Japan- 
ese and all others as well as white 
people ; upon all flesh, he says he 
will pour out his Spirit. 

In this wonderful age in which it 
is such a glorious privilege to live, 
since this spiritual truth was intro- 
duced into the world through the 
ag'ency of the Prophet Joseph Smith 
from God Almighty himself, see 
what has transpired ; see what 



has come to pass! Why, for 
nearly six thousand years ships had 
been sailing as St. Paul said he sail- 
ed and waited three days for a fav- 
orable wind. They" could not go any- 
where without it. Could people 
travel to and fro as they do now? 
No. Daniel, the prophet, says that 
in the last days knowledge shall be 
increased — that is, the Spirit of the 
Lord .shall be poured out upon the 
people and they shall get more in- 
formation, more knowledge than 
they ever had before. And he is not 
pouring out that Spirit alone upon 
us but on all the world, and, as the 
Prophet Daniel said, knowledge 
shall be increased and many shall 
run to and fro. I do not know how 
the whole changed situation between 
the olden time and now could be put 
in fewer words than that knowledge 
shall be increased and many shall 
run to and fro, because there was 
not so very much knowledge on 
many things and people did not 
travel and had not the means to 
move to and fro, so these are the 
last days and the Lord has poured 
out his Spirit upon the people and 
invention after invention, multiplied 
by the million ; knowledge after 
knowledge ; improvement after im- 
provement, we see in so many 
marvelous ways. Why have not 
these inventions come before? Be- 
cause the last days were not yet 
here. Was the mind of man during 
the five or six thousand years that 
had passed up to the time of the 
great manifestation to the Prophet 
Joseph Smith in 1820, not as acute, 
not as capable of comprehending as 
the mind of man is today ? We have 
it on the testimony of the greatest 
scientists, that there has not been 
any appreciable difference between 
the mind of man today and the mind 
of man four thousand years ago. 



ELDER CHARLES IV. NIBLEY

Alfred Russell Wallace, and other 
scientists, so declare, and they de- 
clare further that the mind of man 
is just as much depraved today as 
four thousand years ago, so it is not 
that the mind of man is any brighter 
to grasp these things today than the 
mind was formerly, but because the 
Lord Almighty has poured out his 
Spirit upon all flesh ki all nations, 
and so invention after invention 
goes on. 

What was it that made a James 
Watt s : t there by his mother's fire 
in Scotland, and notice the tea-ket- 
tle lid move up and down? A 
thought, an inspiration of the Al- 
mighty fastened it in his mind. 
"There is power there," he said: 
"There is something there that 
makes that tea-kettle lid rise — the 
power of steam." Why, men had 
sat looking at tea-kettles for five 
thousand years or more. They had 
not thought of that power because 
the inspiration of the Almighty had 
not touched the mind to make them 
think of it. That is why. and that 
is the only reason why. "There is a 
spirit in man," says the Scripture, 
"and the inspiration of the Almighty 
sdveth them understanding," and so 
he is pouring out his Spirit upon 
all flesh and these wonderful, 
marvelous inventions are the result. 
Here we see in this building these 
electric lights. Somewhere in the 
'canyon, miles away, water is tumb- 
ling down hill over a wheel and here 
is the light. Wonderful ! Marvelous ! 
Why, on every automobile you have 
a complete electric light plant. Did 
you ever think of it? It is all so 
common'' with us now that it almost 
ceases to be a wonder. Rut when we 
stop to think, we see how wonder- 
ful it all is. Think of the engines 
of destruction that have been in- 
vented and manufactured during the 



present world-war. The whole face 
of the world seems changed through 
the knowlede that man has received 
from the Almighty. The Lord is 
giving this information and glory be 
to him and not to man. That is 
where the world makes a mistake, 
they take all credit to themselves. 

For about six thousand years men 
had been reaping their grain with a 
sickle. Why was there no improve- 
ment during all that time? I can 
remember between fifty and sixty 
years ago when we used to take a 
sickle and reap grain and lay each 
little bundle down as it was reaped. 
I can remember when we used to 
flail out wheat with a flail or tramp 
it out with oxen like they had done 
in the time of Moses when he de- 
livered the law that thou shalt not 
muzzle the ox that treadeth out the 
corn. There had been practically 
no change in all these matters for 
about six thousand years. We do 
not sow and reap in that manner 
now. All these wonderful inven- 
tions and mechanical improvements, 
practically every one, have been re- 
vealed by the inspiration of the Al- 
mighty to the mind of men since 
the day the Lord spoke to the 
Prophet Joseph Smith and revealed 
himself and started what Brother 
Whitney so beautifully referred to 
yesterday as the new spiritual forces 
which should revolutionize the 
thought of the world, and which 
have in them the means of salvation 
for the world, for the gospel of 
Jesus Christ is the power of God 
unto salvation. It is not in man that 
walks to guide his steps aright. The 
Lord is working these wonders and 
overruling in it all, and while we 
know that he is working in the na- 
tions and give him all honor and 
credit for it, we still know absolutelv 
that in a special way he is work-

ing with this organization, the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints, in which alone is the 
f orce and agency and power that will 
save the world and redeem mankind, 
and shall persist and continue for- 
ever. 

I thought yesterday, as Brother 
Whitney was talking, of some lines 
of Byron, who, lamenting how na- 
tions rise and nations fall, and his- 
tory repeats itself — just a repetition 
of the old story — Byron says in 
these lines : 

Here is the moral of all human tales, 
'Tis but the same rehearsal of the past. 
First freedom, and then glory; when 

that fails. 
Wealth, vice, corruption, barbarism at 

last. 

So history, with all its volumes vast, 
Hath but one page. 

It would seem it is just the same 
old story told and told, but I thought 
to myself, poor sceptical, unbeliev- 
ing Byron. Has the Lord Almighty 
through the Prophet Daniel not de- 
clared that in the last days — and 
these are the last clays all right, and 
don't you forget it — in the last days, 
the God of heaven will set up a 
kingdom which shall stand for- 
ever ; it should never fall ; it should 
never be given to another people, 
but it should endure forever? 

This is the Church of God. This 
is Christ's Church ; Joseph Smith 
was and is a prophet of the Most 
High God. The leaders of this 
Church have been inspired and are 
inspired of the Almighty to give 
direction, to give revelation, to give 
guidance to this great work, none 
more so than the present president 
of the Church who lives and has al- 
ways lived so that the Lord, 
through his Spirit can manifest un- 
to him, give direction and counsel 
and guidance to the Latter-day 



Saints, and it will not fail, it will 
stand forever. God grant it, 
through Jesus Christ. Amen. 

A number of notices of meetings 
were given out — among them a 
notice of a special priesthood meet- 
ing in the Assembly Hall on Mon- 
day, Oct. 7, 10 a. m., and of the 
conference of the Sunday School 
Union, this evening at 7 o'clock, to 
which all are invited. 

PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 

VOTE ON THE PURCHASE OF LIBERTY 
BONDS. 

The Latter-day Saints are well 
aware of the fact that the Church 
has appropriated, on account of lib- 
erty bonds, a sum aggregating more 
than half a million of dollars. I feel 
to propose that we again appropriate 
the sum of $250,000 for the purchase 
of bonds of the Fourth Liberty 
Loan. The motion is seconded. I 
sincerely regret that the financial 
condition of the Church — on 
account of the great demands upon 
it for funds for the support of our 
educational institutions, and for the 
accomplishment of our building 
operations that are in hand — is such 
that we cannot offer more at this 
time. This is a matter that is be- 
yond the immediate reach of the 
council of the Church, appointed 
by the authority of God, by revela- 
tion, to use the funds of the Church, 
and therefore I submit it to this 
great conference of the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 
All who are in favor of this move 
will please signify it by raising the 
right hand. (Unanimous response.) 
Contrary minded, if there are any, 
by the same sign. (No response.) 
I see no contrary votes. 



ELDER DANIEL HEINER.

The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn : "The Spirit of God like 
a fire is burning." 

The Conference adjourned until 
2 o'clock p. m. 

Benediction was pronounced by- 
Elder Charles H. Hart, of the 
First Council of Seventy. 



OVERFLOW MEETING. 

An overflow meeting was held in 
the Assembly Hall, Sunday morn- 
ing, October 6, at 10 o'clock a. m., 
presided over by Elder Stephen L. 
Richards, of the Council of 
Twelve Apostles. 

Singing and music were fur- 
nished by the LeGrand ward choir, 
Elder H. E. Dewsnup, chorister. 

The choir and congregation sang, 
''Come, dearest Lord, descend and 
dwell." 

Prayer was offered by Elder 
Elias A. Smith. 

The choir sang the anthem : 
"How amiable are thy dwellings." 

ELDER DANIEL HEINER. 

(President of the Morgan Stake of 
Zion.) 

If the Lord will support me, I 
will be glad to say a few words. I 
have been very much impressed 
with the conference up to this time, 
with the "many things of real worth 
that we have listened to, and I 
have felt to say that surely the 
Lord is with hi.s people. Never 
in my life was I more pleased an 1 
thankful for a testimony of the gos- 
pel than I am at this time. I also 
feel more thankful, it seems to me, 
for our valleys of these mountains, 
and for our beautiful homes, for 



our beautiful streams and for these 
beautiful mountains. I truly feel 
that this is a blessed spot, most 
blessed of all upon the face of the 
earth. I often think about the ad- 
vice that was given to our leaders 
in early .days that they ought to go 
to the Lower California to locate. I 
visited Lower California a couple 
of years ago, all the way up as far 
as Berkley. I spenr a month up 
there, and I thought of what had 
been said, that we ought to locate 
up there. But while they have a 
beautiful valley, especially around 
Los Angeles, with their beautiful 
groves of oranges, etc., yet it took 
millions of money to get the water 
out to produce what they have 
there. I want to say that we Latter- 
da v Saints ought to be very thank- 
ful for what the" Lord has done 
for us in locating us here. 

W e are surely living in a wonder- 
ful time. It seems that great 
things are transpiring nearly every 
minute ; and if there ever has been 
'a. time when the Latter-day Saints 
ought to be true and faithful to 
their covenants it is now. I have 
often wondered if we are thankful 
enough for our country here and 
for the land of America. You know, 
we are a blessed people to have the 
(privilege to live in this land of 
America. One of the Nephite. 
Prophets, 2,400 years ago, stated : 
"Blessed are the people whose feet 
are planted in the land of Zion." 
As I have said, I wonder sometimes 
if we appreciate it as we ought to 
do. I often times wish that the 
rulers of our own Nation and even 
other nations would read the Book 
of Mormon, and study its contents. 
Frequently I have thought they 
would figure things out in a differ- 
ent way if they did. I feel that we 
ought to stand by this great Nation,

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



and I feel that the whole people of 
the United States ought to really 
repent and turn from immorality, 
and live better lives. I have some- 
times thought, I would like to hear 
of the President of the United 
States making a proclamation, ask- 
ing the people to repent and turn to 
God. I have thought that if that 
could be done, and the people would 
listen, that the peace of the millen- 
nium would be much nearer. 

Our boys now over in France are 
very anxious for us to live righteous 
lives. They are not only expect- 
ing us to put up our money in buy- 
ing liberty bonds, but they expect 
us to keep our covenants. They 
are anxious for us to keep the home 
fires burning, and if Ave can assure 
them that we are true to our cov- 
enants, and that we are waking up 
and understanding the real condi- 
tion that the world is in at the pres- 
ent time, and that we are living up 
to the requirements of the gospel, 
it will help to keep up their morale, 
and they will surely feel like thev 
had more to fight for and to come 
back to. 

I would just like to leave a 
thought with you, and that is for 
us to attend to our prayers, to 
attend to our sacrament meetings, 
and to wake up, and not be so in- 
different, remember the Lord and 
be true to our covenants. I ask 
the Lord to bless us and help us 
to live aright, in the name of Jesus 
Chrst. Amen. 

ELDER REY L. PRATT. 

(President of Mexican Mission.) 

T sincerely trust, my brethren and 
sisters, that the few moments I 
occupy this morning I mav be assis- 
ted by the Spirit of the Lord, and 
I therefore ask an interest in your 



faith and prayers, that his Spirit 
may be with me and with you, and 
that we may be mutually benefited 
by what I may say. 

I am grateful to my heavenly 
Father for the privilege I have had 
to come up to this conference ; and 
we, I think, as a people, should be 
grateful to him for the blessings we 
have already received in this confer- 
ence. I acknowledge the hand of the 
Lord, and I believe firmly that the 
sincere prayers of the Saints in be- 
half of our beloved President have 
been answered in Irs behalf, and the 
Lord has permitted him, after a 
long illness, to stand again before 
the people and give them counsel 
and advice. 

A reference has been made by the 
brethren who have- spoken in the 
sessions held in the tabernacle to the 
missionary work, and the miss : on- 
ary obligation that rests upon the 
people of he Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints. This gospel 
of the kingdom must by us be 
preached to every nation, kindred 
and tongue. We have heard it de- 
clared in unmistakable terms that 
the gospel as it stands revealed in 
the earth today through the Prophet 
Joseph Smith, and the Church as 
organized through h : s instrumental- 
ity, are the very gospel and the 
very Church of our Lord and Sav- 
ior Jesus Christ. We recognize 
good wherever we find it, but we 
declare with boldness that the power 
to preach the gospel and to officiate 
in all of the ordinances thereof 
exists only with the Church of 
T^sns Christ of Latter-day Saints. 
Now that being the case, it seems 
that we should sense the res^onsi- 
Irlity that rests upon us to carry the 
gospel -message to the untold mil- 
lions of the Lord's children who yet 
sit in darkness among the nations of 



ELDER REY L. PRATT. 



81 



the earth. "God moves in a mysteri- 
ous way his wonders to perform," 
and who knows but what the mighty 
conflict being' waged in the world 
today is the Lord's way of prepar- 
ing for the further spread of the gos- 
pel even among peoples who up to 
date have not been able to hear it, 
in nations where the elders of the 
Church have been debarred from 
carrying the gospel message of 
peace and salvation? 

Brethren and sisters, a thing that 
it seems to me we should realize 
and sense is the fact that our Father 
in heaven. is just as much the Father 
of the heathen races, of the benight- 
ed tribes and races of the earth, and 
of all people upon the earth, as he 
is our Father. I call your attention 
to the writings of Paul to Timothy. 
"I exhort, therefore, that first of all 
supplications, prayers and giving of 
thanks be made for all men, for this 
is good and acceptable in the sight 
of God, our Savior, who will have 
all men to be saved, and come into 
the knowledge of the truth." We 
see therein that the Lord does not 
design and desire only one portion 
or part of his people, or one nation 
of his children to be saved and come 
to the knowledge of the truth ; but 
lie wishes all to be saved. We are 
prone to think, just as the Jews ol 
old thought, that we are the only 
favored people upon the face of the 
earth in the sight of the Lord. And 
the Jews were a favored race. And 
so today the blood of Israel as 
fathered out among the peoples of 
the Latter-day Saints are highly 
favored of the Lord. But I want 
to bear you my testimony that, just 
as the Tews fell into disfavor when 
they disobeyed the one God whom 
they worshiped, so might we, if we 
should turn our backs upon the 
Holv One of Israel, and if we re- 



ject the teachings of his gospel and 
cease to live by the things that he 
has given unto men. A lesson was 
given to Pecer, the chief of the apos- 
tles, in times of old in the conversion 
of Cornelius, a Gentile, and after 
Peter had witnessed the manifesta- 
tions of the Holy Spirit as poured 
out upon this man and his family, 
"then Peter opened his mouth and 
said, of a truth I perceive that God 
is no respecter of persons, but in 
every nation he that feareth him and 
worketh righteousness is accepted of 
him." Now this is just as true today 
as it was then. And this gospel of 
the kingdom is being preached in all 
the earth, among all people and 
among all men, to search out those 
who will accept it and who will live 
according to his commandments. 
And I want to tell you that it makes 
no difference what blood flows in 
our veins, only those who accept the 
Lord and live humbly before him, 
in harmony with him and his com- 
mandments, will be favored of the 
Lord and accepted of him and be 
saved in his kingdom. Nationally, 
at least, we are learning the same 
great lesson. There was a time 
when the people of this great 
country of ours were termed Irish- 
Americans and many other kinds of 
hyphenated Americans. Down in 
the section of the country where I 
am do : ng missionary work the poli- 
ticians always count upon the Mexi- 
can vote, for I will say in passing 
that we have hundreds and thous- 
ands of Mexicans, or .oeople of 
Mexican blood, in the United States, 
who are native-born American citi- 
zens. But this great world conflict 
will eradicate that spirit that is pre- 
dominant in certain sections of the 
country. 

T want to believe, and do, that 
when this war is over we will all 



82. 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



be in a political sense just as the 
Nephites and Lamanites were in a 
religious sense after the advent of 
the Savior among them. Where 
before there had been jarring sects 
and parties known as Nephites and 
Lamanites, Zoramites and other 
"ites," after the Savior had come 
and taught them the gospel of truth, 
and after they had been chastened 
by the terrible judgments of God 
upon them, those who escaped turn- 
ed from their wickedness and from 
their evil contentions and became a 
united people, and they were no 
longer known as Nephites or La- 
manites but were all known as the 
Church of Christ. And so, I believe 
that in this country of ours after 
the war is over all who live here 
will be true Americans, and there 
will be no German- Americans, 
Irish-Americans, Mexicans, or the 
like, but we will all be known as full 
fledged American citizens. 

I had the opportunity a short time 
ago of speaking at the service held 
; n honor of the first boy that fell 
from the countv where I now live. 
L T pon the stand sat his aged father, 
eleven years a cripple from rheuma- 
tism. He was of Scandinavian 
origin and could scarcely speak the 
English langauge, but that bov of 
his in the spirit of true American- 
ism volunteered with the first that 
served their country and he gave 
his life in defense of the spirit of 
Americanism. Can we say he was 
less an American because of his 
Scan d : n avian blood? T can in- 
deed say that he was a true Ameri- 
can. At the close of the meeting, 
word came in that another young 
man, who a few months before hai 
left a bride of eight months and 
his aged parents, had also been 
killed. That boy was a Mexican 
from just below where I live, yet 



no man will be able to say that he 
was not a true American, and no 
father or mother can offer a great- 
er sacrifice for freedom than did 
his. And can any wife be more 
faithful to her country than that 
one who sent her husband away 
to defend that country? So we 
see that in our country's hour of 
need men of different bloods faith- 
fully spring side by side to her de- 
fence and by their lives and deeds 
they make themselves true Ameri- 
cans. 

So also it is in the Church. 
Deeds, and not blood, determine 
our right to be called Saints of 
God. Away down there in Mexico 
our native Mexican brethren and 
sisters, although for four years left 
alone, ^continue to meet together 
and praise, the Lord and testify of 
his goodness and that the gospel is 
true. They are living their religion 
and keeping the commandments of 
the Lord as they understand them. 
Are they any less worthy to be 
called the Saints of God because 
of their blood? I recall a man down 
in Mexico who was drafted into 
the army and forced to leave 
everything he had and to leave h : s 
family destitute. After having 
been away about a vear, during 
which time he received a daily 
pittance of twenty-five cents from 
which he had to feed and clothe 
himself, he wrote to me and asked 
"Where shall I send my tithing?" 
On learning where to send it he 
sent a tithing of the pittance he had 
received while in the army. Is 
his offering less acceptable, or is 
he less a member of the Church, 
or less worthy of receiving an in- 
heritance in the kingdom of God 
because of his blood? I want to 
tell you that such is not the case. 
God is no respecter of persons, 



ELDER REV L. PRATT. 



83 



then why should we be? But this 
thing he does require of Jew and 
Gentile, and of every nation what- 
soever, and it is due from all those 
who may be found among all na- 
t : ons, that they live the gospel and 
live according to its requirements, 
and when the Savior comes there 
will be a universal brotherhood of 
man and we shall not look down 
upon a man because of his blood 
or his station, but he shall be meas- 
ured according to his worth. 

I wish to testify, in conclusion, 
that I know that the gospel is true. 
I know that it has been establish- 
ed upon the earth for the salvation 
of all men, and I know that your 
sons who are in the mission field 
bearing their humble testimony and 
teaching this gospel are just as 
loyal to their country as are your 
sons who are in the army, and 
those sons of yours out there are 
not in any way hiding behind their 
ecclesiastical calling to avoid a duty 
?n the armies of their country. They 
have received a classification and 
have been assigned a .special work 
by the Government of the United 
States which recognizes the neces- 
sity of doing just the work that 
they are doing, and when the 
United States needs them and wish- 
es to call them in they are willing 
to serve their country in freedom's 
cause wherever they may be called. 

May the Lord bless us in our en- 
deavors to serve humanity I ask 
in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER PETER M. HANSEN. 

(President Bear River Stake of Zion.) 

My brethren and sisters; It is a 
pleasure to me to meet with you 
this beautiful morning in continua- 
tion of our splendid eighty-ninth 
semi-annual conference of the 



Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints ; and to hear the excel- 
lent testimonies we have received. 
It is an evidence to us that we are 
indeed the Church of Christ, and a 
joy that we have the privilege of 
living in the dispensation of the ful- 
ness of times, led by prophets and 
inspired men who have been chosen 
of the Lord to guide and direct his 
people. 

We have been interested in the 
discourses that have been delivered 
which are testimonies to us that the 
great latter-day work in which we 
are engaged, is of God. 

What we need in this Church to- 
day, my brethren and sisters, are 
teachers, to teach the word of God 
to our young people, men and wom- 
en who are qualified for this duty, 
and I hope that we will not shirk 
the responsibility that rests upon us. 
We cannot dodge the responsibility 
that is required of us in this beau- 
tiful world in which we live. If we 
do, T think we will not live in a 
better world. But there are certain 
responsibilities that are resting upon 
every man and woman in Zion. One 
obligation is to teach the gospel to 
the young people in the splendid 
organizations that we have in this 
Church today. We call, perhaps, a 
number of sisters to preside in the 
Primary organizations in the wards 
and stakes where we live, and we 
send our children, but we never go 
there ourselves, we never meet with 
those s : sters in teaching our chil- 
dren. Now if we would make it a 
point to meet in this organization 
once every year, what a splendid 
thing it would be for us, and what 
a splendid thing it woidd be for our 
children, what interest they would 
have in us and the work in which 
we are engaged ! So in the Mutual 
Improvements Associations, we ap- 



S4 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



■point a certain number of men and 
women to preside in these organi- 
zations, but we never go there our- 
selves. We never show much inter- 
est in them. We leave the work to 
these officers that we have appoint- 
ed. Now, if every man and woman 
would make it a point to visit these 
organizations once a year, what an 
excellent thing it would be for us 
and our interest in these organiza- 
tions. How the young people would 
rejoice to see our presence with 
them once in a while. The same 
with our priesthood quorums. Men 
shirk responsibilities more or less. 
We should not shirk responsibili- 
ties ; we should not dodge these 
things, because it is detrimental to 
us as well as to the Church at large 
to do so. 

The greatness of the work and 
responsibilities that rest upon us, 
my brethren and sisters, we can- 
hardly comprehend. Our brother 
has said it is our responsibility to 
preach the gospel to the world. Half 
of the people of the world today are 
starving for a little love and sym- 
pathy that should be extended to 
them, and the other half of ail the 
world today are starving because 
they are not willing to give it. That 
is the condition the world is in ; arid 
I hope that we as Latter-day Saints 
may not be starving for the want of 
these things, that our young people 
may be more diligent in serving the 
Lord and striving to keep his com- 
mandments. 

I have a son in South Africa, who 
has been in that field laboring now 
for nearly three years. A short 
time ago he was sent to a new field 
of labor, where elders had not been 
before, a stranger, a poor, insig- 
nificant boy, as it were, yet an elder 
of the Church going there in the 
service of the Lord and with the 



blessings of the. servants of God 
upon his head. He labored there 
for ,six months. Lately I received 
word from him that he had been 
called into another field to labor. 
He says, "I have baptized two mem- 
bers of the Church, I have blessed 
two children ; and we had a meet- 
ing a short time ago, where I made 
my farewell address. The people 
of the little meeting we had of ten 
or twenty shed tears to know that 
I was to leave that little community 
and go into another." He went 
there as a strange boy, yet he made 
converts, had the love and confi- 
dence of the people, which love we 
have inasmuch as we strive for it, 
inasmuch as we seek to do the will 
of God and to keep his command- 
ments. 

I was very much intereste l la .t 
evening' in Brother Nibley's address 
delivered before the priesthood, 
wherein he stated that the Latter- 
day Saints are blessed with boun- 
teous crops this season, more so 
than he could ever remember be- 
fore. Now I bear that same testi- 
mony, my brethren and sisters, that 
our people are blessed this season 
as perhaps we have never been 
blessed before. I hope that we will 
not forget the Lord. Elder Hyrum 
M. Smith, in one of the last dis- 
courses that he delivered, I think, 
in one of the Idaho stakes of Zion, 
said that if the Latter-day Saints 
will be a prayerful people, if they 
will be diligent in saying their pray- 
ers morning and night, if they will 
be diligent in attending their sacra- 
ment meeting's every Sunday or as 
often as they can, if they will pay 
an honest tithing, doing those du- 
ties, they will never apostatize from 
the Church. I believe that, and it is 
possible for us all to do. It is pos- 
sible for the little children even to 



ELDER THOMAS D. REUS. 



85 



meet together often and to partake 
of the sacrament, to pay an honest 
tithing, to say their prayers morn- 
ing and night, and in secret. It is 
possible and it would not be diffi- 
cult; if we would do that, what a 
reformation would come in the 
Church. Let us be more diligent. 

In the stake in which I reside, 
we have over a thousand people who 
are non-" Mormons." a splendid 
class of people. We visit with 
them, we associate with them, 
and it is a pleasure for us to do 
so, because they are good neigh- 
bors, they are good citizens, they 
are good home-builders, and we ap- 
preciate their company. We do not 
quarrel with them ; we let them wor- 
ship as they will, and they do. We 
say, do not embrace "Mormonism" 
until you investigate for yourself, 
test its principles, and if you find 
them worth while, if we can assist 
you, if we can help you in explain- 
ing the principles of the gospel, we 
shall cheerfully do so. The conse- 
quence is that we have a satisfaction 
in living among them, and I trust 
that they have with us. I wish that 
we may be exemplar)- men and 
women. That preaches the gospel 
more than anything else that we do 
in the Church. How effectively it 
preaches the gospel to those who 
are not of us. if we can be exem- 
plary men and women ! 

I reioice in the. spirit of the gos- 
pel. I rejoice that we are here in 
conference, and that we have the 
privilege to listen to the servants 
of God. Another thing, my breth- 
ren and sisters, this is a splend'd 
year to pay our debts and obliga- 
tions. 

A dollar now, you know, is not 
worth more than about 50 cents in 
the commodities of life, but it is 
worth one hundred cents on ^the 



dollar in paying our debts and obli- 
gations ; and for that reason, this is 
a splendid year to meet our obliga- 
tions. 

I am a little interested in the 
banks of the state where I live, and 
men will come to the banks, and 
beg for money at eight or nine per 
cent. Now that should not be the 
case. Let us pay our obligations as 
we can, while we have the splendid 
opportunity now afforded us. 

God bless you, my brethren and 
sisters. May peace and the bless- 
ings of the Lord attend us, and may 
we be worthy of every blessing that 
we enjoy, is my prayer, and I ask 
it in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

Sister Amelia Margetts sang a 
solo, "Song of my soul." 

ELDER THOMAS D. REES. 

(President of the Juab Stake of Zion. ) 

I assure you that it is not my wish 
that I occupy this position this 
morning. I would far rather be 
seated wtih you in the audience, and 
listen to the instructions from my 
brethren. When I was called to 
occupy this position the thought 
never entered my mind of not beuig 
present, even though I feared I 
might not be able to instruct you in 
our most holy faith. I have been 
taught in this Church that obedience 
is one of its great principles — -that 
they who obey it never fall away 
from the teachings of the Lord. 

I have been taught to obey the 
laws of our great Government, the 
authorities of this Church, and my 
father and my mother giving - to 
them the obedience of a ,son. This 
lesson came to me in early life. I 
remember on one occasion my 
father invited me to accompany him 
to an adjoining valley. There were 



86 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



others in the company, and we trav- 
eled through the canyon from one 
valley to the other, changing our 
directions often, and as we emerged 
into the valley that was strange to 
me, I beheld, to my astonishment, 
that the sun was going down in the 
east. But all day long I had been 
curious in asking questions, and I 
thought I would remain silent and 
watch for the morning. And when 
the morning came, behold the sun 
was coming up in the west, and I 
turned to one of my brethren and 
said, "What a peculiar place, the 
sun is coming up in the west!" Jok- 
ingly he said, "Another one of your 
wonderful questions." One of the 
boys from another place stated, why 
you are twisted. My father came to 
my rescue, saying, "No ; the sun is 
rising in the east all right," and I 
looked at him. I could see. I had 
eyes. I knew directions, and the 
sun was coming up in the west, even 
if my father told me that it was not 
so, and he could not convince me ; 
yet I obeyed. Have you ever been 
turned round, and some one has 
tried to change you as to the right 
direction by conversation ? You will 
realize my situation. And when we 
started out with the wagon, he gave 
me the lines. I was a youngster of 
seven and eager to drive. As we 
came to the parting of the roads, I 
knew that we were to go south, and 
I turned the team south, as I 
thought. My father said, turn left, 
and lo and behold, when I turned 
left the team was facing the north. 
Now, he said, drive south, and I 
started. Driving north I knew I 
could see the sun coming up in the 
west, and the directions — why, I 
was positive that I was going north, 
and that my father was wrong. He 
talked to me. He said, "Yes, you 
are going south. Keep on going 



south, and I knew I was going 
north. And I kept on going north, 
but the thought of disobeying my 
father never entered my mind. I 
thought he was wrong, but I obey- 
ed, and drove on. Finally we came 
to our destination all right. 

In my work as a boy, and as I _ 
grew older, I met many people who 
would come to me and ,say, "The 
Church is not the same as it was in 
the .days of the Prophet. It is not 
the same as it was in the days of 
Brigham Young." I thought in my 
heart, your point of direction is lost, 
even if you think absolutely that you 
are right ; if you will obey, the rime 
will come, as it came to me in that 
valley, when things will adjust 
themselves, even as I could see that 
my father was right and I was 
wrong. So, when I see some of . 
those who were brethren stray away 
from the Church, and are positive 
that they are right, I think of the 
lesson I learned when I was a boy. 
Within themselves they seem to feel 
that they are right, but if they had 
the power to obey they would again 
adjust themselves. 

As Latter-day Saints we owe it to 
the principle of obedience, to teach 
it to our boys and our girls, telling 
them that this Church is the Church 
and kingdom of God, given to us 
through his prophets. We are not 
afraid to state to all the world that 
this is the true Church that we be- 
long to, and the people should not 
take offense at that, nor claim that 
when we do it we are egotistic, be- 
cause Christ tells us unequivocally 
that there is but one Church that is 
or can be his on the earth. As Lat- 
ter-day Saints we are just following 
his admonition, and stating boldly 
to the world that we possess that 
truth. It is possible for all the 
churches to be wrong, but it is not 



ELDER THOMAS D. REES. 



87 



possible for more than one to be 
right. And therefore we feel that 
we have the right to testify to the 
world of these truths. That is the 
reason we cherish the salvation of 
men so greatly, considering it a 
privilege to live on this earth, ac- 
counting the human being the great- 
est gift. We have given our boys 
and girls the greatest riches God has 
ever given us, because they will 
stand with us in the eternities as 
our wealth, to hold up our hands. 
They are the riches God intended 
we should have when he sent us to 
this earth to live and enjoy the gos- 
pel. O what a beautiful thing is 
virtue to every boy and girl in this 
Church ! How grand it is that we 
can give to them that wonderful, 
progressive spirit that God has 
given us, a knowledge that we can 
go back to our Eternal Father. 

The I AM within us teaches us 
that we existed before we came 
here, that we exist now, and it 
seems impossible with the feeling 
that we have within us to ever cease 
to exist. Then we should teach our 
boys and girls the lessons of obe- 
dience, virtue, honesty and truth, 
that they may walk before their 
heavenly Father as he would have 
them walk, and before their fellow 
men, in dignity, and in the power 
of the holy priesthood. We are 
claiming the greatest blessing that 
can be given to the children of men 
— these boys and girls — for they 
will be with us throughout all eter- 
nity. In the eternities they can be 
perfected with us. Think of the 
possibilities, what they mean to us, 
the little children whom God gives 
to our arms to teach. Think of the 
minds of these children and the 
power inherent in them to be crea- 
tors in the hereafter ! Do they not 
mean more to our lives than our 



lands and our chattels? For our 
children will have the power of 
eternal progression, until out of 
their hands will roll systems of 
worlds, with all the wealth neces- 
sary to the : r creation. Far greater 
are these blessings to us than the 
things of this life. When we meas- 
ure them, how we cherish this priv- 
ilege of coming upon this earth and 
taking upon us this tabernacle of 
flesh that we might be able to go 
onward in this great progress of 
eternity ! 

I have always said, teach the boy 
to kneel down and pray unto his 
heavenly Father, because it takes a 
strong character to kneel down in 
prayer. It takes a character whose 
soul will enlarge so that he forgets 
the little things of life, and becomes 
mighty in himself, when reaching 
up in the spirit of a good prayer. 

Hence, each father and mother 
should teach their boys and girls to 
kneel down in prayer before God, 
that they may be exalted in them- 
selves. It requires obedience, and 
a power of character to kneel down 
each day in prayer. It builds us up 
so that we are more like God intend- 
ed we should be when he sent us 
here to this earth. It builds us up 
so that we can look upon our fellow 
men as our brethren, and look out 
upon all God's creatures giving 
them a sympathetic hand, enabling 
us to feel that all mankind are the 
children of God. But we despise 
sin. We love the human race and 
the children of God, but the sins 
that men commit we despise. It is 
our mission upon this earth to seek 
to do away with ,sin, and teach men 
that the greatest joy and the great- 
est happiness, the greatest love, can 
come from living an honest life, 
from living this religion of ours, 
where jealousy should find no place,

but peace of mind with God, and 
good will to our fellow men. 

May God bless and help us, that 
we may be of service to him, that 
we may have time to turn from the 
things of earth and spend more time 
with the wealth that God has given 
us, our boys and our girls ; because, 
after all, they will go with us and 
be ours when we leave all this 
world's goods behind. This is my 
prayer for the Latter-day Saints 
and for the people of this earth. 
And may peace come to this earth, 
and may the day speedily come 
when we will live as our Father .de- 
sires we shall live, is my prayer, in 
the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER JOSEPH B. KEELER. 

(President of the Utah Stake of Zion.) 

I testify to you, my brethren and 
sisters, that the Spirit of the Lord 
is here, because of the words that 
have been uttered in our hearing 
and the thoughts that have been 
going through our minds. Some of 
them have been passing through my 
mind, and likely through your 
minds, and to a great extent we are 
one in the Lord this day. May this 
Spirit continue to be with us 
throughout the sessions of this con- 
ference, as it has been through the 
sessions that have preceded this. 

A great deal has been said, and 
will be said, regarding the patriot- 
ism and the loyalty that has been 
manifested toward our Government 
and the cause of the allies in which 
we are now engaged to bring about 
freedom and justice in the world. 
We have another loyalty and patri- 
otism that we should never forget, 
and that is to the Church of Jesus 
Christ to which we belong. Peace 
would be in the earth today if all the 



inhabitants thereof were members 
in full fellowship in Christ's Church. 
There would be no war, there would 
be no trouble, no famine, no pestil- 
ence, if there were a brotherhood of 
man, if we could say truly that we 
are citizens of this world. 

I said to a German brother the 
other day, it is impossible for us to 
be at war. It is impossible for us 
to hate each other. We cannot do 
it, and why ? Because we are mem- 
bers of the Church of Christ. And 
so the millennium would be here to- 
day if men and women were obe- 
dient to the principles of the ever- 
lasting gospel. Now this thing that 
is so much desired, peace and good 
will in the earth will come to the 
extent that men will forsake un- 
righteousness and cling unto that 
which is good. This Church is so 
organized that these principles of 
love, of intelligence, may be dis- 
seminated throughout the earth. 
And how thankful we should be, 
my brethren and sisters, that we are 
members of the Church of Christ, 
the only true Church that God rec- 
ognizes upon the face of this earth. 

We have institutions in the 
Church that are intended for our 
development and our education. 
Elder Stephen L. Richards re- 
marked yesterday that we are all 
teachers, that is, the priesthood, and 
we can well include in that class the 
sisters now, to the extent that we 
will be patriotic and loyal to these 
institutions. To that extent will 
this Church grow and increase in 
the earth, and we will not only be- 
come teachers of one another, but 
Ave will become teachers of the 
world. But I apprehend that in 
preparing ourselves to become 
teachers, we are doing as much or 
more for ouselves individually than 
we are to others. Really, the Lord 



ELDER JOSEPH B. KEELER. 



89 



does not intend men and women to 
preach this gospel more than men 
and women need themselves to be 
obedient to this call to be teachers. 

Let us read the ninth and tenth 
chapters of TTI Nephi, and there 
see how completely Jehovah preach- 
ed the gospel to the people then 
upon this continent, to half a world, 
we may sav. Every soul, whether 
he was in the open field or in the 
home, or in the fastnesses of the 
mountains, heard his voice. He 
preached to all the world with one 
voice, and all the world at that time 
heard his voice. T mean noAv, of 
course, the earth. That was then 
understood by that people to whom 
he preached. We need the Lord, 
we need the institutions of his 
Church, and therefore it would be 
well for us to sustain everv organi- 
zation. I always feel to bless the 
sisters who so faithfully perform 
their labor in the Primary organi- 
zations among these young and 
budding children. Our Father in 
heaven notices them, notwithstand- 
ing the fact that we sometimes al- 
most forget them as parents. T sav 
to you, my sisters, go on in this 
good work. God notices you. and 
will bless you. So with the Young 
Ladies' Mutual Improvement Asso- 
ciations. What a wonderful organ- 
ization for good ! What a social 
function it performs anion? the 
Latter-dav Saints. So with the 
Young Men's Mutual Improvement 
Associations. What a grand oppor- 
tunitv it is there for every voting 
man to become acquainted with the 
principles of the gospel and to learn 
how to deliver those principles in 
such a wav that thev may be lis- 
tened to and understood by others. 
The Religion Class organization, 
that organization which has not, I 
feel, received the support that it 



ought to receive, O that is a won- 
derful organization, my brethren 
and sisters. There is no organiza- 
tion in the world like it. It comes 
to our children in the day time, in 
the week clay. It comes to them 
alongside of their school work while 
they are getting this secular train- 
ing. Here is an opportunity for 
them to be truly built up and 
trained. 

I feel that we do not appreciate 
the wonderful blessings and oppor- 
tunities that we enjoy as Latter-day 
Saints through these organizations. 

And then there is that wonderful 
organization of the young, the Sun- 
day School. The churches, the 
school houses, the assembly halls 
could not hold, as they are able to 
do, all of these young people, if 
they would embrace the opportunity 
presented to them in attending this 
wonderful institution. 

And then the Relief Society. 
There is another institution, humble 
in its action, but very efficient in 
everything that it does. I am glad 
indeed to learn now that it is com- 
ing more to the notice of Latter-day 
Samts and of the world. God bless 
that institution. May it prosper. 

We have another organization in 
our midst, and that is the Church 
schools. The Church, through the 
Trustee-in-Trust, is taking some- 
thing like a third of a million dol- 
lars annually, and giving it for the 
support of these institutions. 

I feel that sometimes the Latter- 
day Saints do not fully appreciate 
this wonderful blessing which we 
have, especially in these regions 
where they are located. Why, these 
school rooms ought to be filled to 
overflowing, so that each teacher 
who is employed there should be 
able to teach to his or her full ca- 
pacity, that the Latter-day Saints 



90 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



should be there so that there would 
not be empty benches nor small 
classes. It is a great thing, a great 
blessing, to be able at the same time 
that our young people are receiving 
secular knowledge and training, to 
be also trained in the principles of 
the everlasting gospel, and be im- 
mersed, as it were, in the Spirit of 
the Lord at the same time, which 
gives light and understanding to the 
human mind. 

One thing in this connection that 
I will take the liberty of mention- 
ing. The United States Govern- 
ment, through its liberality and gen- 
erosity, has established one of the 
units of the Students' Army Train- 
ing Corps in one of our Latter-day 
Saint institutions, that of the Brig- 
ham Young University, at Provo. 
Now here is an opportunity along 
with the other institutions of this 
day for our young men to go, who 
are nineteen or twenty years old, 
who are about to be called now to 
go into the service of their country 
for the cause of liberty and justice 
in the world, to receive a training 
in the world and to be under the 
influence of this institution, and be 
prepared to take very active part, 
even that of officers, if their work 
so qualifies them. I hope that the 
Latter-day Saints will take advan- 
tage of this and see to it that no 
young man is deprived of the op- 
portunity. Now then, my brethren 
and sisters, we need these institu- 
tions more than the institutions need 
us, and it behooves us to take ad- 
vantage, while our day lasts, so that 
we may regard the opportunities 
that have been given to us. 

I testify to you, my brethren and 
sisters, that this is the Church and 
kingdom of God. All things will be 
shaken that can be shaken, thrones 
will totter, because earthly nations 



as they are now constructed will 
pass away, and there will be an end 
of such nations, but the Church and 
kingdom of God will not pass away. 
It will endure through all of the 
vicissitudes that this poor world is 
called to pass through. We belong 
to this Church, and if we adhere to 
its principles we will weather the 
gale with it, which may God grant, 
is my prayer, in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 

A selection entitled, "Friendship" 
was sung by a quartette compose ! 
of Elders Pike, Acomb, Aldous and 
Shurtliff. 

ELDER NEPHI L. MORRIS. 

(President of the Salt Lake Stake of 
Zion.) 

I was strongly tempted to put my 
hand out to steady the ark by sug- 
gesting to Elder Richards that my 
time be given to President Seymour 
B. Young and to himself ; but I 
thought that obedience, after lis- 
tening to President Rees' remarks, 
was the better. 

I have greatly rejoiced in the in- 
spiring discourses of this most ex- 
cellent conference. I wish that all 
the young men and young women 
of Zion could have heard what 
Elder David O. McKay had to say 
yesterday in his great appeal for 
better morals. I deplore, with el- 
der Richards, that there were so 
few of the young men and young 
women who were present on that 
occasion ; and I hope that some- 
thing will develop that will bring 
about a reform with respect to the 
attendance at the meetings of the 
Saints. There should be, and can 
be, I believe, a great improvement, 
when we consider that there is so 



ELDER NEPHI L. MORRIS. 



91 



small a percentage of attendance 
at our priesthood meetings, and a 
correspondingly small attendance 
of the membership of the Saints at 
the regular meetings. It was a 
great height that Elder McKay 
reached, but unfortunately it will 
only reach a few of us, with 
his soul-burning and soul-moving 
words. I rejoiced in the very en- 
lightening discourse of Elder Or- 
son F. Whitney, regarding the dis- 
covery of America. I appreciate, 
perhaps as never before, what a 
great thing it is to be Latter-day 
Saints and to have the Latter-day 
Saints' comprehension of things, 
and to know something of Amer- 
ica and its origin ; to know that 
it was the very cradle of humanity ; 
to know that it was not the new 
world but the old ; to know that 
God has held it in reserve until this 
day and age for the consummation 
of his great and mighty purposes 
in the earth. 

I am a better American because 
of my being a Latter-day Saint, and 
so are you all, and America is en- 
riched and benefited by the fact 
that the "Mormon" people have 
these exalted conceptions of the 
mission and destiny of America in 
the world. 

I rejoice in these things, because 
they reflect to me the inspiration 
of God and the providence of God 
over mankind and particularly over 
his people in this dispensation. 

I rejoice that we are living in a 
land of peace and security, a land 
to which war has not yet come, 
al,thou,gh we have gone to war. 
There is an infinite difference be- 
tween those two propositions. 

Listening to those inspiring ad- 
dresses in the tabernacle last even- 
ing, I could not help but feel and 
my soul went out in gratitude to 



God for his mercy in gathering this 
people in these western mountain 
regions, yet I feel thankful that we 
can take part in this great and ter- 
rible conflict, which means the great 
turning point in human history. 

I rejoice in the hymn, which I 
have never heard sung, written by 
that estimable little Latter-day 
Saint, Sister Emily Hill Woodman- 
see, on page 434 of our hymn book, 
and which I will take the liberty 
here to read : 

Uphold the right, tho' fierce the fight, 

A,nd powerful is the foe; 
As freedom's friend, her cause defend, 

Nor fear nor favor show. 

No coward can be called a man — 
No friend will friends betray; 

Who would be free, alert must be; 
Indifference will not pay. 

Note how they toil whose aim is spoil, 

Who plundering plots devise; 
Yet time will teach, that fool's o'er- 
reach 

The mark, and lose the prize. 

Can justice deign to wrong maintain, 

Whoever wills it so? 
Can honor mate with treacherous 
hate? 

Can figs on thistles grow? 

Dare to be true, and hopeful too; 

Be watchful, brave and shrewd; 
Weigh every act; be wise, in fact, 

To serve the general good. 

Nor basely yield, nor quit a field — 

Important is the fray; 
Scorn to recede, there is no need 

To give our rights away. 

Left handed fraud let those applaud 
Who would by fraud prevail; 

In freedom's name, contest their claim, 
Use no such word as fail; 

Honor we must each sacred trust, 

And rightful zeal display; 
Our part fulfill, then, come what will, 

High heaven will clear the way." 

Such sentiments, my brethren and 



92 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



sisters, are in beautiful contrast to 
the spirit of selfishness, hate, desire 
for dominion and glory. 

We were all moved greatly and 
deeply by the dispatches which 
reached us last night ; but these 
things should not move us from 
duty. We should not quit the field, 
because it is an important fray. 

I have thought the day would 
come, and I hope soon, when there 
would be a declaration of peace, 
when the world would be restored 
not only to a normal condition, but 
to a far better condition than it has 
even known. But the ends of jus- 
toe must be met, and though France 
and England and Belgium and Italy 
have been glorified by the baptism 
of blood and fire through which 
they have passed, I fear that the 
lesson has not yet been written deep 
enough in the heart of America to 
make of us the nation God would 
have us be. I don't believe that 
peace is quite at our doors as yet. 
If it is a lesson God would have us 
to learn, it has not been fully 
learned. 

I have hoped for .some weeks that 
when the time for a dictated peace 
come, that America would prove 
herself the great, big magnanimous 
nation that she is, and bring back 
her two to four millions of men 
from France to their homes, where 
they should be just as soon as con- 
ditions in Europe will permit ; and 
then let this great army of indus- 
trials, workers and artisans of all 
kinds, go back there as volunteers 
to help build devastated Belgium 
and France. England cannot do it ; 
France cannot do it ; Italy cannot 
do it ; America can do it. Such an 
act of magnanimity, such an evi- 
dence of human love and fraternal 
spirit and disposition would for- 
ever revolutionize the world. I do 



not believe we shall see such a thing 
accomplished ; but while sitting here 
this morning this thought came to 
me. Yes, Germany, if you are 
ready for peace, stay where you are, 
in Belgium and in France. Lay 
down your arms and pile them 
mountain high, and utilize your 
efficiency and your ingenuity for the 
reduction or trans formation of those 
arms into plows and pruning hooks 
and the various implements of hus- 
bandry, and break up and put in 
tillable shape the soil that you have 
torn up, and plant the_ trees that 
you have chopped down, and con- 
struct the highways and the cottages 
and the buildings which you 
have destroyed. Remain there, and 
make restitution now, and undo as 
far as you can that which you did 
in your mad rush for glory, con- 
quest and power. Make restitution 
as far as you can. You cannot re- 
store those husbands, those fathers, 
to the children of that land ; you 
cannot, in the least degree, repair 
the broken hearts, the deserted fire- 
sides, the desolate homes ; but you 
can, and if I had my way, you 
would, restore Belgium and France 
completely, in terms of bricks and 
mortar, and macadamized roads, 
and farms and orchards and vine- 
yards, and make full restitution. 
Justice demands that of you. 

God hasten the day when Justice 
shall rule in the world and selfish- 
ness shall hide its head and stand 
subdued, for selfishness is always de- 
structive of self, and the only hope 
of the great and goodly race, the 
German people, is that contrition of 
heart shall be given them, till they 
are willing to make restitution. If 
not, they must be continued in the 
conflict until they are brought to 
their knees. Amen. 



ELDER SEYMOUR B. YOUNG

PRESIDENT SEYMOUR B. 
YOUNG. 

(Of the First Council of Seventy.) 

My brethren and sisters: With 
you I am in deep sympathy with 
the remarks that have been made 
by my brethren during this semi- 
annual conference. I rejoice when 
I hear the testimonies of my breth- 
ren, brethren who stand as leaders 
of the people. 

I believe I echo your sentiment, 
every one of you, when I state that 
my heart bounded within me with 
joy, it had a new mooring, a new 
rhythm of happiness, when I saw 
President Joseph F. Smith enter 
the tabernacle on the first day of 
the conference, and then, yes- 
terday, as well, heard his voice 
again in our midst. With you I 
have been praying for this, for this 
denoument, and the Lord has heard 
the prayers of the Saints. Presi- 
dent Smith has had a new lease of 
life, as it were, and we hear his 
voice again and his teachings, and 
I pray that this may continue, that 
his power of health and life may 
increase, that he may live to be a 
blessing and a comfort to Israel for 
•many years to come. 

As my brethren have expressed 
themselves this morning, I agree 
fully with their sentiments, that 
"obedience is better than sac- 
rifice, and to hearken than 
the fat of rams." The power of 
faith also that was in the heart 
of the Prophet Joseph Smith, 
prompting him to kneel in humility 
in the sight of heaven before his 
heavenly Father, away from the 
haunts of men — he wanted to be 
alone, in communion with his heav- 
enly Father ; he wanted to know of 
his existence ; he wanted to know 
of his willingness to respond to a 



humble prayer of one of his hum- 
ble children ; and the Lord was 
never found to fail to respond to 
such prayer, and he gave the re- 
sponse in full measure. And so, 
year after year, teaching, in answer 
to prayer, this humble youth, giv- 
ing him line upon line and precept 
upon precept, here a little and there 
a little, and finally the culminating 
power and faith to that degree that 
he was permitted to bring to pass 
the righteousness of God in the or- 
ganization of his Church and to be- 
gin the institution of the latter-day 
gathering of Israel. Josiah Quincy 
wrote of his interviews with the 
prophet, a short year previous to 
the martyrdom of the prophet. He 
describes him as physically one of 
the perfect men of nature, and of 
high spirituality, and then he makes 
this wonderful prediction, if it may 
be a prediction, and I believe it will 
be verified: "It is not improbable 
that, in the coming generations, this 
question may be asked in our public 
institutions of learning, What great 
American has made the greater im- 
press upon the hearts of h:,s coun- 
trymen? And this answer will not 
be unlikely, it will not be improb- 
able, 'That man is the 'Mormon' 
Prophet Joseph Smith." 

The result of his ministry, the 
organization of the Church of Jesus 
Christ once more upon the earth, 
the calling around him of stalwart 
men, men who were not afraid, to 
attest and to speak their convic- 
tions, men who, though strong of 
nature and brave of heart and fear- 
less, were yet humble as children, 
so that the spirit of inquiry could 
reach them in the humility of their 
souls. They could see that God 
had raised a prophet again, and giv- 
en him his power and his strength ; 
and in their humility they accepted 



94 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



of the testimony of a great prophet. 
They knew that he had seen God, 
the eternal Father. They knew that 
he had heard the voice of Jesus 
Christ, and seen his person. They 
knew that by that inspiration which 
followed him, and which responded 
to his prayer on every occasion ; holy 
messengers came to him and deliv- 
ered to him the gospel of the Lord 
Jesus Christ, the way to organize 
the Church, the plan by which sal- 
vation was to reach humanity the 
world over. And so the gospel be- 
gan to be preached by this united 
band of brethren, who gathered 
around the Prophet Joseph, in the 
days of the infancy of the Church, 
and the result has been wonderful 
to behold. 

And I was thinking, like Brother 
Morris, of the wonderful plan God 
instituted through his Prophet Jo- 
seph Smith, how the very events, 
the very providential occurrences, 
and the times, have been so propi- 
tious that seemingly everything has 
worked out for the advancement of 
this great cause of truth. Do I in- 
clude with that everything, the op- 
position, which they have met from 
time to time? Yes, for that was a 
schooling to them. It was a neces- 
sary schooling. The men who were 
known as among the leaders of the 
Church from the time of its organ- 
ization to the present have been 
men that were willing to accept of 
the providences of God. I re- 
member reading something about 
their experiences in Jackson coun- 
ty, Missouri, in Far West, and in 
the massacre that occurred at 
Haun's Mill, 1838, and other places, 
showing what those new beginners 
felt, if I may use the sentence, 
members who had had little experi- 
ence or none, meeting these awful 
conditions, where they saw their 



brethren, their sisters, their chil- 
dren, shot down : where men and 
women and children were banished 
from their homes in winter season. 
This came to the new converts of 
the faith. It had made such an 
impress upon them, this gospel 
of Jesus Christ had found such a 
hold upon their hearts that they 
never flinched nor turned from 
their conviction. Although caused 
to wander, to wade through these 
scenes of oppression and depriva- 
tion, yet they remain true and faith- 
ful. So the Church had, in the be- 
ginning, stalwart men, as it has to- 
day, only they are multiplied by 
thousands and hundreds of thou- 
sands. We have our leader 
with us, the prophet, seer and reve- 
lator, the man who says, Thus 
saith the Lord to Israel, to all the 
world, if they believe, for his min- 
istry extends to every son and 
daughter of God that will hear, and 
to them he has promised, as you 
have heard today, he will own 
them to be his children, if they will 
accept his word. 

My brethren and sisters, I have 
as great a wish that the war would 
speedily terminate as any man can 
have ; and yet I feel, as Brother 
Morris has expressed himself this 
morning and other brethren during 
this conference, that in the due time 
of the Lord he will bring peace to 
the earth. And when he brings 
peace to the earth, and establishes 
his rule and reign of righteousness, 
it will be established, and we will 
see the glory and the happiness of 
that peaceful reign upon the earth. 

I hope with all my heart that 
the teachings of these good mothers 
and the teachings of these good 
fathers may be so deeply impressed 
upon the hearts of our soldier boys 
that they will go into action, go 



ELDER JONATHAN G. CUTLER.

into the trenched fields and receive 
their training, and march, into the 
battles with clean hands and pure 
hearts, as they left you from your 
firesides. Should they do this, 
and I believe they will, most of 
them, and I hope all of them, you 
will .see the blessing of God upon 
them wherever they go ; and this 
may be a consolation to every 
mother's heart. 

God bless you all, my brethren 
and sisters, and hasten the day of 
peace, and the rule and reign of 
righteousness upon the earth, is my 
humble prayer in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 



ELDER STEPHEN L. RICHARDS 

I am sure that I speak your feel- 
ings when I say to the LeGrand 
ward choir, and the excellent mu- 
sicians who have accompanied 
them, that we have enjoyed their 
splendid music this day. We thank 
them, also those who have sung 
to us in the selections intervening, 
for the very excellent renditions 
with which they have favored us. 

I am also very sure that we have 
greatly enjoyed the excellent and 
inspired words that have been spo- 
ken by the brethren who have ad- 
dressed us. 

The choir sang: "With sheathed 
sword." 

Prayer was offered by Elder 
Elijah Allen of the presidency of 
the Maricopa Stake of Zion. 



OUTDOOR MEETING. 

An open air meeting was held at 
the Bureau of Information build- 
ing at 10 o'clock, Sunday, October 



6, Elder Joseph W. McMurrin, of 
the First Council of Seventy, pre- 
siding. 

Music was furnished by the con- 
gregation, Elder Joseph Spencer 
Cornwall, chorister. 

Congregation sang : "Come, 
come, ye Saints." 

The opening prayer was offered 
by Elder Charles S. Parker. 

The Congregation sang, "Sow- 
ing." 

ELDER JOSEPH W. McMURRIN. 

(Of the First Council of Seventy.) 

We are very glad to see such a 
manifestation of anxiety to hear 
the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ 
expounded. While the weather is 
not very propitious, we trust that 
in our souls we may be fed with 
the bread of life, and that we may 
rejoice in the things pertaining to 
the kingdom of God that may be 
brought to our attention. 



ELDER JONATHAN C. CUTLER. 

(President of the Curlew Stake of 
Zion, Idaho.) 

The beloved apostle, John, left on 
record, for the benefit and consola- 
tion of the children of men, these 
words: "For God sent not his Son 
into the world to condemn the 
world, but that the world through 
him might be saved." So, if men 
and women are condemned, it is by 
our own actions. It was not the 
purpose or the mission of the Mas- 
ter to condemn men. Salvation is 
held out to all of the children of 
men. 

While the Lord uses no particular 
coercion, we are persuaded, counsel- 



96 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



ed, and advised to live the gospel. 
The Latter-day Saints have heen 
accused of being' a narrow-minded 
people, but this is from the lack of 
understanding of those who do not 
understand our intent nor the gospel 
as we preach it. We are broader 
than any other denomination in our 
views and in our teachings of the 
gospel. We understand that it is 
the object, and was the object in 
the beginning, to accomplish the sal- 
vation of all of the human family, 
and that some time and somewhere, 
all who desired would receive some 
kind of salvation. But the plan of 
salvation holds out, throug'h the 
gospel, a code of laws that can not 
only bring unto the children of men 
salvation, but will bring unto them 
exaltation, and bring them back in- 
to the presence of our Father, from 
whence we came ; and in order that 
we may gain this exaltation, it is 
necessary for us to live up to the 
code of laws that has been laid 
down By the Master for us to fol- 
low, and we must comply with these 
in order that we may come back 
into his presence and receive the 
blessing that is in store for the 
faithful. We believe in an individ- 
ual salvation as well as a general 
salvation, and in order that men 
may be exalted, they must comply 
with the laws and ordinances laid 
down by the lawgivers, even before 
the foundation of this earth. 

Some have the idea that salva- 
tion simply means a reunion of the 
body with the spirit, or a resurrec- 
tion of the body; and if they can 
only attain to it, this seems to be 
the height of the ambition of a great 
many people with whom I have 
talked. But the atonement was as 
wide as the fall. We are told in 
the I Corinthians 15 that "As in 



Adam all die, even so in Christ shall 
all be made alive." So, without 
any particular exertion upon the 
part of the children of men, we 
are going to be resurrected. But 
this does not insure to any individ- 
ual salvation, nor exaltation, which 
to obtain, I believe, is the ambition 
of every man and woman. There 
is none but desires salvation, though 
there are a great many who are not 
working to that end. Now, in order 
that we may bring and merit unto 
ourselves a complete exaltation, and 
be worthy to come back into the 
presence of our Father, there is a 
code of laws that we must live up 
to. First, we must have faith in 
God the Eternal Father. We must 
be willing' to repent of our sins. And 
after we have repented of our sins, 
it then becomes necessary for us to 
be baptized by immersion for the 
remission of them, and receive the 
Holy Ghost, which is a guide to t-he 
path of men and women here in the 
earth. We take the stand as Latter- 
day Saints that all men and all wo- 
men must comply with the law in 
order to gain an exaltation. 

But, says one, are you going to 
condemn all who are not baptized ? 
There are millions of people who 
have not had the privilege of re- 
ceiving the gospel, and what is 
going to become of this class of 
people? There is where we take 
a broader view of the gospel of 
Jesus Christ than does any other de- 
nomination. We do not hold that 
this life is the only chance that men 
have to hear or embrace the gos- 
pel, but we believe that the time 
will come when every knee shall 
bow and every tongue confess that 
Jesus is the Christ, and men who do 
not have that privilege here will 
have the privilege hereafter granted 



ELDER .JONATHAN C. CUTLER.

unto them. We are given to under- 
stand by the Apostle Peter that 
the gospel is preached to the spirits 
in the spirit world. Isaiah foresaw 
this. He foresaw the mission of 
the Savior. He saw that he was 
going to come here in the flesh, and 
would be crucified, and while his 
body was lying in the tomb, "He 
went and unlocked the prison door 
and let the captives free." Peter 
gave us to understand that this was 
carried out. He says, "For this 
cause was the gospel preached unto 
them that are dead ;" showing that 
all who do not have the privilege 
here are going to have the privilege 
sometime and somewhere. 

Men may reject the gospel here, 
and it seems that even they are 
going to have another chance of 
hearing it, according to the words 
of Peter, though Noah preached to 
the people and warned them in his 
day and they rejected his counsel 
and teaching, and no doubt called 
him (as they have called the 'ser- 
vants of God in all ages) imposters, 
and would not accept his message. 
The result was, according to the 
decrees of the Lord, that the flood 
came and overtook the people, and 
there were only a few saved ; yet, 
even that class of people had the 
privilege of hearing the sound of the 
gospel in the spirit world, and were 
given another chance to receive it. 

But in this world, now and here, 
my friends, my brethren and sisters, 
is the place that we should receive 
the gospel. If we do not, we make 
the sad mistake that the people in 
Noah's day made, and condemn our- 
selves. Remember, there was a long 
period of time, for two thousand 
years, after that people had been 
swept from the earth, that they lay 
in the prison in the spirit world. 



Alma told his son, in pleading with 
him, trying to show him that the 
spirits of all men when they leave 
the body go back into the presence 
of God from whence they came, for 
a partial judgment, that the spirits of 
the righteous are assigned to a place 
of peace, rest, and happiness, while 
on the other hand, the spirits of the 
wicked go to a place of punishment 
during that period. This also bears 
out the statement of the rich man 
and Lazarus. While Lazarus was a 
good man and did all the good he 
could here, we find the rich man 
did just the opposite ; and the time 
came that Lazarus died, and the rich 
man died, and they met on the other 
side. It was then that the eyes of 
the rich man were opened. He saw- 
where he had made the mistake 
here in mortality, and he pleaded 
with Lazarus to visit him. But the 
answer was, There is a gulf between 
you and me, and I cannot come. 
The rich man felt the truth of it, 
and pleaded with Lazarus that a 
spirit or an angel might be sent 
down to the earth to warn his breth- 
ren, because he did not want them 
to come where he was. The answer 
was this, They have Moses and the 
prophets, and if they will not listen 
and hearken unto the voice of the 
prophets, they would not accept one 
though he be raised from the dead. 
This gives us to understand that a 
place of punishment and a place of 
anything but happines is prepared 
for the spirits who leave this life 
and go into the spirit world unpre- 
pared. We have evidence upon evi- 
dence, to which we cannot refer this 
morning on account of the time not 
permitting. 

What I wish to impress upon the 
young people especially is, prepare 
yourselves in this life, that you may 



98 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



be able to continue the work and not 
be hindered and condemned as were 
the rich man and the antediluvian, 
who by error hindered and con- 
demned themselves for that period 
of time. The object of the gospel 
was to .save, and not only save, but 
to exalt all mankind. This is the 
object the Lord has in these the 
last days in revealing the gospel un- 
to the children of men, that we may 
receive an exaltation, and come back 
into his presence. 

I want to bear my testimony to 
you here this morning. I know that 
the gospel is true. I know that the 
Lord has again spoken from the 
heavens, and revealed his priest- 
hood, and has delegated the author- 
ity and power to men to officiate in 
his name arid make it binding, as 
was promised to Peter, that what- 
ever he bound on earth should be 
bound in heaven, and whatever he 
loosed on earth, should be loosed 
in heaven. That same power is 
here, the same blessing and the same 
gifts are here with the Church to- 
day, as in that day. This is why 
we are called a peculiar people, be- 
cause we differ from the world. We 
d,o not find anv fault with them. 
We think it is the right of all men 
to worship according to the dic- 
tates of their conscience. We do not 
condemn them, but we have a great- 
er lieht. And it is our duty to hold 
that light up to the world, that it 
may shine that they may see as we 
see. 

I prav the Lord to bless us with 
his spirit, that our understandings 
may be quickened, that our deter- 
minations for good may be increas- 
ed, and that we may be able not 
only to gain a salvation in the king- 
dom of God, but to gain an exalta- 
tion, ard come back into his pres- 
ence and live forever, in the name 
of Jesus. Amen. 



ELDER DAVID HALLS. 

(President of the Young Stake of 
Zion, Colorado.) 

I am reminded of a saying of the 
Savior, "Come unto me, ye that la- 
bor and are heavy laden." We can 
take that as we desire to take it. If 
we are sick, we think of that and 
seek our heavenly Father. If we 
are weary in mind or body, and 
think of that admonition, we turn 
to our heavenly Father. So we can 
construe that just as we please, ac- 
cording to our attitude and accord- 
ing to our needs. 

I am reminded of the time when 
Cornelius needed assistance, and he 
went to his heavenly Father, and he 
was directed what to do. He sent 
for the servants of the Lord, and 
they directed him what to do, and 
he was baptized, he and his whole 
household, and no doubt they were 
saved in the kingdom of heaven. 

I am reminded of another in- 
stance at another time and place, 
when a man went to his heavenly 
Father. You remember one time in 
the history of the Nephites that one 
Alma was converted by Abinadi the 
Prophet, and performed a wonder- 
ful work and brought souls almost 
everywhere, so far as he knew ev- 
erywhere, to repentance, and estab- 
lished the Church. After a while his 
son and others, sons of Mosiah, 
went about trying to undo that 
work ; and it worried Alma very 
much, and he importuned the Lord, 
and finally his prayer was answered. 
The Lord came to his rescue, and 
xAlma, his son, and the sons 
of Mosiah were converted, and 
much good resulted. Through 
their efforts, many of the La- 
manites received the gospel. All 
this through the blessings of the 
Lord listening to his servant Alma 
and answering his prayer. So we 



ELDER BENJAMIN GODDARD 



99 



find these instances, one on one con- 
tinent, and one on the other, where 
the Lord was willing to listen to 
his servants and do what they asked 
him to do, inasmuch as it was asked 
in righteousness. 

I want to call attention to another 
time in the history of the world, in 
our day, when a boy importuned his 
heavenly Father to know what was 
right. He wanted to know whHi 
of the denominations that he was 
acquainted with was the denomina- 
tion of the Almighty. He did not 
have any doubt but what one of 
them belonged to God. It was all 
he knew, and, of course, he thought 
that he had heard the truth among 
some of them. And so, according 
to his faith and his prayer and the 
trusting nature of his soul, the Lord 
came to him, and the Son was re- 
vealed to him, and after that, angels 
came to him and established this 
gospel ; and so thousands of people 
have been made partakers of the 
truth through that humble boy's 
seeking his heavenly Father to 
know that which was the truth. So 
the Lord has blessed his people 
through the faith and fidelity of the 
boy prophet. 

I have quoted these three in- 
stances, on two continents and at 
various periods of time, to show un- 
to us that the Lord is no respecter 
of persons, but that in every age 
and to every people, those who seek 
him in righteousness will be heard 
of him, and find him ; and so we 
find him today, in these trying times 
— because some of us labor and are 
heavy laden. Into the homes of the 
Latter-dav Saints, as well as in the 
nations of the earth, sorrow comes, 
and probbaly will come, and we 
need to seek our heavenly Father 
and importune him for his bless- 
ings. 



I want, before I close, to bear my 
testimony to the truthfulness of the 
gospel. Not long ago I found my- 
self in a hospital, surrounded by 
strangers, people not of our faith ; 
and I want to testify that I desired 
more than anything at that time, to 
see an elder in Israel ; and after a 
few days, one of my friends heard I 
was there, and came. The greatest 
blessing I received at that time was 
for that elder of Israel to come 
there and lay his hands upon me and 
bless me ; and I know that the Lord 
blessed me, and I thank my heav- 
enly Father for this manifestation 
of his goodness. I thank him that 
he answers my prayers, and that he 
answers your prayers, and the 
prayers of the honest in heart in 
all ages of the world. 

So may he answer our prayers in 
the future, that we may have peace 
in the land, that iniquity may cease, 
that war and bloodshed may be ban- 
ished from the face of the earth, and 
the people of the earth and the rul- 
ers of the earth may be willing to 
serve the Lord and keep his com- 
mandments. And may truth and 
righteousness go out from Zion, and 
spread over all the earth, and the 
knowledge of the Lord cover the 
earth as the waters cover the sea ; 
and may all people hear of the boy 
prophet, Joseph, and of the won- 
derful message that we have ; and 
that the honest in heart may hear 
and obey the gospel, I ask in the 
name of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER BENJAMIN GODDARD. 

(Of the Bureau of Information, Salt 
Lake City.) 

I am very glad to be with you, 
my brethren and sisters, but sorry 
that we cannot accommodate every

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



one who desires to attend this meet- 
ing; the weatKer being unpropitious 
has compelled us to crowd here. 
Whether or not you are all mem- 
bers of the Church, I do not know, 
for gathered together upon this 
block are many strangers from for- 
eign lands. 

Many years ago two young elders 
were preaching the gospel as mis- 
sionaries in one of our mining 
camps in the mountains. There 
were quite a few strangers gath- 
ered round to listen to them. They 
were only boys ; but they were ex- 
plaining the gospel as taught to 
them by their fathers and mothers 
and according the testimonies that 
they had received ; and in that 
crowd were one or two Latter-day 
Saints, that these young elders did 
not know anything about; one of 
them was an elder, and he remarked 
to his companion. "I can hardly 
stand still ; these people around us 
are listening to these young men, 
and I have a testimony of the gos- 
pel, too, and I want to bear it." So 
when the time came, and one of 
the elders discontinued, he stepped 
into the street and commenced also 
to bear his testimony. That elder 
had performed missions, he knew 
just what the gospel was, he wanted 
to help those young men, he felt the 
time was opportune for bearing his 
testimony, and he did so to the 
amazement and the consternation 
of some gathered there, the elders 
themselves not knowing who he 
was. 

Upon the Temple block it is per- 
fectly natural for us to preach the 
gospel, very often unto strangers, 
however, for they are the ones who 
come here daily. Perhaps, for your 
information, I might say that upon 
this block everv year we have from 
200.000 to 300,000 strangers from 



all parts of the world, desirous of 
knowing something with regard to 
the Church of Jesus Christ of Lat- 
ter-day Saints, and the principles 
revealed through the Prophet 
Joseph Smith ; they come, and we 
■do not know who they are or where 
they are from, until they make it 
known ; but the same testimony that 
you have, Latter-day Saints, is 
borne unto them under the shadow 
of this roof, and it commences very 
often with the beautiful little story 
referred to by Brother Halls. I 
want to emphasize that. To us it 
means everything as far as this 
Church is concerned, as far as our 
faith is concerned, as far as our 
hope of eternal life is concerned, for 
without that, we would not be here, 
nor would we understand the gos- 
rel of the Lord Jesus Christ in its 
fulness. 

A gentleman came here recently 
and handed me his card. I have it 
here now — a t'tled gentleman, a 
professor of the Universitv and di- 
rector of the Academy Royal, at 
Brussels. He was traveling 
through here and had called on the 
Presidency, had visited a number 
of our institutions, and he had seen 
what Salt Lake City was. He gazed 
with wonder upon the Temple, and 
later came into the office adjoining 
here. And this was his story, in his 
broken tongue, which I cannot give 
to you, for he gave it as only a 
Belgian can. 

"I have visited your city. I have 
seen these wonderful streets. I 
have seen those wonderful build- 
ings. I have been talking to some 
of vour officers in the Church. I 
find that there is here in Salt Lake 
City something that I do not under- 
stand. I want to know something 
more of your faith and what you 
believe in." 



ELDER BENJAMIN GODDARD 



101 



And then he asked the. very sim- 
ple question, that caused some of 
our people to smile, "Do you be- 
lieve in God? Do you believe in 
Jesus Christ?" 

You could observe how anxious 
he was to learn of our faith. How 
•did we commence to answer that, 
think you? "Believe in God? Yes, 
the very first article of our faith is, 
'We believe in God, the Eternal 
Father, and in his Son, Jesus Christ, 
and in the Holy Ghost,' a sentence 
that every little boy and every little 
girl in our Sunday School can re- 
cite. It is taught unto them, and 
they understand it." 

"How do you know that? How 
do you know that there is a God? 
How do you know that he has a Son 
Jesus Christ?" 

And then comes up the story that 
Brother Halls very briefly touched 
upon, that the very beginning of 
our work was a revelation from 
God to the boy prophet Joseph 
Smith, as beautiful a story as is to 
be found in any literature — that a 
boy between fourteen and fifteen 
vears of age, with a deep anxiety 
to know the will of God, bowed in 
humble prayer, and in faith asked 
the Lord for direction. 

" 'How do we know that there is 
a God ? How do we know that he 
has a Son Jesus Christ?' We know 
it because Joseph Smith the Proph- 
et saw God, he heard him speak, he 
saw his Son Jesus Christ, he heard 
the words of the Father, when 
nointing unto the Son, saying, 'This 
is my beloved Son, hear ye him.' It 
is not a fairy storv, it occurred in 
that beautiful grove near Palmyra, 
in the western part of the State of 
New York." 

The gentleman was surprised at 
that story. He could scarcely com- 
prehend it. But I could tell by the 



change of his countenance, by the 
glance of his eye, by the eager man- 
ner in which he leaned forward to 
learn more, that he caught the 
spirit of that first vision as you and 
I caught it. 

And then he asked, "Well, that 
God, is he like a man?" 

Then comes the truth made 
known in this dispensation by the 
boy prophet Joseph Smith, that the 
Eternal One is not a mythical be 
ing, he is not a being without body, 
parts or passions, he is not a spirit 
pervading all space ; but he is a per- 
sonage, a personage of body, of 
spirit, with parts as I have, and that 
it has been made known through 
the Prophet Joseph Smith that man, 
in very deed, is in the image of God, 
the Eternal Father, that the Son is 
also in his express image. Joseph 
Smith received this testimony, he 
could never depart from it, he could 
not deny it. He had seen the Fath- 
er, he 'had seen the Son, he had re- 
reived from the Son, Jesus Christ, 
instructions with regard to this 
great mission ; and this testimony 
many of my brethren and sisters 
here have received, and in this re- 
spect we stand to a very great ex- 
tent in the same position as Joseph 
Smith. 

I trust we shall have the very 
same spirit, for after he had re- 
ferred to the instructions given him 
of the Lord Jesus Christ, he stated 
— that the spirit of bitter reviling 
and persecution which followed 
gave him, the youthful prophet, a 
great deal of sorrow. Ffowever, he 
says in his own statement : 

"It was nevertheless a fact that I 
had beheld a vision. I have thought 
since, that I felt much like Paul, when 
he made his defense before King 
Agrippa, and related the account of 
the vision he had when he saw a light. 



102 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



and heard a voice; but still there were 
but few who believed him; some said 
he was dishonest, others said he was 
mad; and he was ridiculed and reviled, 
But all this did not destroy the reality 
of his vision. He had seen a vision, 
he knew he had, and all the persecu- 
tion under heaven could not make it 
otherwise; and though they should 
persecute him unto death, yet he knew, 
and would know to his latest breath, 
that he had both seen a light, and 
heard a voice speaking unto him, and 
all the world could not make him 
think or believe otherwise. 

"So it was with me. I had actually 
seen a light, and in the midst of that 
light I saw two personages, and they 
did dn reality speak to me; and though 
I was hated and persecuted for saying 
that I had seen a vision, yet it was 
true; and while they were persecuting 
me, reviling me, and speaking all man- 
ner of evil against me falsely for so 
saying, I was led to say in my heart: 
Why persecute me for telling the 
truth? I have actually seen a vision, 
and who am I that T can withstand 
God, or why does the world think to 
make me deny what I have actually 
seen? For I had seen a vision; I 
knew it, and I knew that God knew it, 
and I could not deny it, neither dared 
I do it, at least I knew that by so 
doing I would offend God, and come 
under condemnation." 

"Now," said my friend, "tell me 
something more." 

"Very well, we have commenced 
now with this great revelation com- 
ing in the latter days to the Prophet 
Joseph Smith. We believe in God 
the Eternal Father and in his Son 
Jesus Christ. Why? Because the 
Prophet Joseph saw them, heard 
them, received revelations from 
them. We have faith in God. So 
that the first principle of the gospel 
comes in. Isn't it easy to have 
faith in such a God? Faith, fol- 
lowed by repentance, baptism by 
immersion for the remission of sins, 
the gift of the Holy Ghost by the 
laying on of hands. We have these 
plain and simple principles before 



us day by day, and do not they in- 
spire our lives?" 

I am not going to take more time. 
You want to hear from President 
McMurrin. We love to hear him 
and his testimony, for few men in 
this Church have been raised from 
('eath unto life while defending the 
truth as has this man who is before 
you, a living testimony of the power 
of God in this dispensation, and we 
love him for that, as well as for his 
fidelity. 

Now, what is the lesson 1 want 
to draw ? We are amongst the peo- 
ple of the world, coming in contact 
with them day by day. . It is my 
privilege to meet them by the thou- 
sands, it is your privilege to meet 
them in your various localities. 
Where do we stand? We stand 
ready at all times to do as the 
Prophet Joseph Smith said : we have 
received this testimony of the gos- 
pel in our hearts, we know that it 
is true. God knows that I know 
that this gospel is true, that the tes- 
timony that I bear comes from mv 
very heart, and that the dearest 
thing to me on earth is the gospel 
of the Lord Jesus Christ, that it ha<; 
given unto me certain blessings. It 
has given them unto you Latter- 
day Saints. In the temple of the 
Lord we have been sealed as hus- 
bands and wives for time and for 
all eternity. We have had innumer- 
able blessings. What shall we do? 
We will do as the Prophet Joseph 
said, continue to bear this testimony. 
They may persecute us, ridicule us, 
heap upon us all manner of calumny 
but we know that the gospel is true. 
In our various localities, wherever 
we live, in every little village, in 
every little town, by our lives we 
will declare that this gospel is true. 
With our voices we will bear testi- 
mony that Joseph Smith was a 



ELDER JOSEPH U 

prophet of God. In our homes, with 
these little children, such boys and 
girls as these blessed mothers have 
clinging to them now, in our fam- 
ilies we will teach our children from 
babvhood, that the greatest thing on 
earth is a testimony of the gospel of 
the Lord Jesus Christ, and that it 
will save them, and save us through 
all the eternities to come. 

May God bless you, and may God 
bless all Israel. 

I rejoice exceedingly with you 
that the President of our Church, 
the Prophet of the Lord, is so fully 
recovered that he could be with 'is 
in this conference. I believe all 
Israel throughout the length and 
breadth of the land has been plead - 
ing for him. Let us continue to 
prav that God will bless "our proph- 
et dear." And may God establish 
us fullv in the truth and enable us 
to appreciate h : s revelations, as 
p-iven unto us through the Prophet 
T oseph Smith, is my earnest oraver 
in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER JOSEPH W. McMURRIN. 

(Of the First Council ,of Seventy.) 

I hope all who are here feel that 
it has been better to come into this 
fathering here in the Bureau of In- 
formation building, than to have 
seoarated and gone to our homes 
without continuing the meeting, 
when the storm came upon us, which 
we started in the open air. 

I suppose everyone present knows 
that the same gospel taught in this 
Catherine - , is the gospel that has 
been taught, and is being taught, in 
the Tabernacle, and in the Assemblv 
Hall, by the servants of God who 
have been called to take part in 
those meetings, for there is but one 



. McMURRIN. 103 

gospel. We have all been baptized 
into one spirit. We all have the 
same feeling that has been referred 
to by the brethren, a feeling of ab- 
solute assurance relative to the truth 
of the work that God, our Father, 
has planted upon the earth in this 
the dispensation of the fulness of 
times. There is no doubt in our 
minds regarding it. We bear testi- 
mony to the mission of the Prophet 
Toseph Smith, and declare that he 
in answer to prayer, had a vision of 
the Father and the Son, and com- 
munication from our Father in 
heaven, concerning the fact that the 
time had come that had been spoken 
of bv the holy prophets ; for the re- 
establishment of the work of God 
in the latter times. 

We bear that testimony because 
we have tested the work, just as 
was taught by the Lord Jesus Christ 
when he stood upon the earth and 
when men looked upon him as an 
imposter. Thev could not feel that 
the Messiah who had been spoken 
of by the prophets, wherein thev 
had oortraved the greatness and 
pTandenr of his mission and the 
work that he was to accomplish, 
could possiblv be the lowlv babe 
born in Bethlehem, who was looked 
nnon as the son of the carpenter. 
Surely he could not be the Being 
that had claimed the attention of the 
prophets from the beginnine of 
time down to that period. What 
rould the Lord Jesus Christ sav to 
the unbelieving people relative to 
his calling? Onlv, "My doctrine is 
not mine, but his that sent me. If 
anv man will do his will, he shall 
know of the doctrine, whether it be 
of God. or whether I soeak of mv- 
self." So taught the Redeemer of 
the world, this was the manner of 
test that he offered to the children 
of men. that they might know 



104 



GENERAL CONEERENCE. 



whether he was an imposter, or 
whether he was in very deed, the 
. Savior and Redeemer that the 
prophets had sung" about in all ages. 

In the remtroduction of the gos- 
pel of the Son of God in this last 
dispensation, by the commandment 
of our Father in heaven, the same 
test has been placed in the hands of 
men, that is, if this work that has 
been revealed from on high be the 
work of God, it is the right of men 
to know concerning the work, for 
God is no respecter of persons, and 
if men could know concerning the 
ministry and work and authority of 
the Lord Jesus Christ by the testing 
of the doctrines, through an accept- 
ance of the truth he expounded, it 
is the right of men in this dispensa- 
tion to know concerning- the revela- 
tion of God our Heavenly Father in 
the same manner. It is because men 
have tested the promise that has 
been made in our own age, that they 
bear testimony concerning the work 
of God, and declare without a sem- 
blance of doubt, that they know 
that this work to which they have 
given their allegiance is the work 
of God, that the gospel they are 
teaching is the very same gospel 
that was taught by the Redeemer of 
the world — not a new gospel, but 
the old gospel, for there is but one 
gospel. We should understand that. 
All men should understand it. It 
has been .declared by one of the in- 
spired apostles, "I marvel that ye 
are so soon removed from him that 
called you into the grace of Christ 
unto another gospel ; which is not 
another ; but there be some that 
trouble you. and would pervert the 
gospel of Christ. But though we, 
or an angel from heaven, preach 
any other gospel unto you than that 
which we have preached unto you, 
let him be accursed." This was the 



doctrine of the apostle as he wrote 
by the inspiration of the Almighty ; 
the .scriptures abundantly teach that 
there is but one gospel. This is one 
of the evidences of the truth of the 
work of God concerning which we 
testify, for we say today as the 
apostle said, there is but one way 
of being saved, Jesus our Lord is 
the only Being through whom sal- 
vation can come, and there is no 
other name under heaven whereby 
man can be saved, only the name of 
the Lord Jesus Christ. 

But men are saved, if Jesus Christ 
be true, by an acceptance of his gos- 
pel. So taught one of the apostles 
as he was lit up by the inspiration 
of heaven, when he declared, "For 
I am not ashamed of the gospel of 
Christ ; for it is the power of God 
unto salvation." The gospel of 
Christ is the power of salvation, and 
for that gospel we contend, because 
we know the truth of it. We bear 
record of this truth and ask men 
everywhere, "Why should not God 
the Father reveal himself in this age 
of the world as he has revealed him- 
self in former ages? It is the doc- 
trine of our Father, as taught by 
the holy prophets, and as taught 
also by the Son of God, and as 
taught in much plainness by his 
apostles, that our Father in heaven 
is the same yesterday, today, and 
forever, he is without the shadow 
of turning, his gospel is an everlast- 
ing gospel, not a gospel in the dis- 
pensation of the meridian of times 
for the people of that period, and 
then a changed gospel in the latter 
times for the people who live now. 
But it has always been the same 
gospel. 

It was this very gospel that has 
been revealed through the great 
prophet of the latter-days, and that 
we advocate today, that our father 



Elder Joseph tv. McMurrin. 



105 



Adam received, and that he taught 
to his sons and daughters in the 
Garden of Eden. When the angel 
asked why Adam did certain things 
he could only answer, "I know not, 
save the Lord commanded me." 
And God revealed his plan of salva- 
tion to our father Adam in the be- 
ginning, and taught to our father 
Adam in the Garden of Eden the 
mission of the .Lord Jesus Christ, 
and commanded him to teach his 
children concerning the mission of 
the Redeemer, that they might 
know they were to obtain eternal 
life in the presence of God by obe- 
dience to the principles of the gos- 
pel that have been advocated by our 
brethren in this congreagtion this 
afternoon. And by that revelation 
of our Father concerning the mis- 
sion of Jesus Christ, the fact, that 
the Son of the living God who gave 
his life for the salvation of the hu- 
man family, has been spread among 
all nations in every land ; and we 
are told that no matter how ignorant 
men may. be, or how they have 
fallen away from the truth that was 
revealed in the beginning, that in 
some form men everywhere still 
have some conception, however 
clouded it may be, concerning the 
mission of the Son of God and sal- 
vation coming to the children of 
men by the giving of the life of a 
God. 

I thank God for the gospel. I 
thank God for the disposition work- 
ing in me to honor the holy priest- 
hood. You who have been present 
in the meetings of this general con- 
ference have discovered the spon- 
taneous feeling that ran from heart 
to heart at the appearance of the 
President of the Church, President 
Joseph F. Smith, (who has been 
very sick for several months), when 
the great assemblage rose to their 



feet. I was glad to stand upon my 
feet to do honor to the President 
of the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints. I love the man, 
I love him because of the wonder- 
ful example he has been to the chil- 
dren of men. I love him because of 
the uprightness of his life, his hon- 
esty, his integrity, his unflinching 
testimony concerning the truth, be- 
cause of the giving of the very best 
that there has been in him during 
his whole life, for the advancement 
of the work of God. But above all 
that, we stand up in honor of the 
President because of the priesthood 
and presidency that has been con- 
ferred upon him as the mouthpiece 
of God, and as the man holding the 
keys of authority pertaining to this 
dispensation at the present time. 

I attended some years ago in the- 
Temple in Salt Lake City a gather- 
ing in honor of President Lorenzo 
Snow, and there saw a banner 
stretched across a part of the chapel 
in the annex of the Temple, upon 
which was written, "We delight to 
honor the man whom God hath hon- 
ored." I would like you to think of 
that, both young and old. Who 
could do better than to honor the 
man that God has honored? We 
are not worshiping men, we are not 
looking upon the President of the 
Church as some superior being to 
all other beings, but we see in him 
the authority that has been con- 
ferred upon him by the Lord our 
God, and we recognize and honor 
that authority. When we speak of 
earthly things, there is no trouble to 
honor authority. If the President 
of the United States were to make 
his appearance in a gathering of 
people anywhere in America, or for 
that matter anywhere in the wide 
world, men would stand up in his 
honor — not in honor of Woodrow 



106 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Wilson, the man, but in honor of the 
President of the United States. We 
can all understand that, we can all 
see the propriety of such an act, and 
we can all heartily approve of men 
showing to one of their fellows just 
such honor. And yet there are men 
who would attempt to question and 
condemn their fellows if they stand 
up in honor of the mouthpiece of 
the living God. We, however, de- 
light to honor him. 

I am told that these words to 
which I have referred, that were 
painted upon the banner in honor 
of President Lorenzo Snow, did not 
originate at that time, but a long 
time before. Dr. Bernhisel, who 
was our first representative in the 
halls of Congress from the territory 
of Utah, away back in Nauvoo, in 
the early days of the Church, when 
the Prophet Joseph Smith would 
enter a room where Dr. Bernhisel 
was sitting, the doctor would rise 
to his feet, and remain standing 
until the prophet himself took a 
seat ; the prophet, it is ,said, was em- 
barrassed at this mark of defer- 
ence, and remonstrated with Dr. 
Bernhisel, who was a man of supe- 
rior education. Such pronounced 
deference was not sought by Joseph 
Smith. It made him feel uncom- 
fortable. But when he remon- 
strated, Dr. Bernhisel said, "I de- 
light to honor the man whom God 
hath honored." Do you know, my 
brethren and sisters, there has been 
a disposition in my soul to honor 
Dr. Bernhisel from the moment I 
first learned of his making that 
declaration, of which I never could 
have been possessed, had I not 
heard the story. 

We honor the authority of God. 
It is a safe thing to honor such au- 
thority. Read the Holy Scriptures, 
and you will discover that God has 



vindicated his authority in all dis- 
pensations. Our Father in heaven 
has blessed men who have respected 
the authority he has conferred upon 
men in every age. You can also 
read of the distress and trouble, 
and even death, that has come upon 
men in past ages who have dared to 
speak slightingly of God's author- 
ity. While men do not lose their 
lives today if they speak in con- 
tempt of God's authority, while 
they can sneer at his authority, and 
they can trample under foot the 
counsel God gives through author- 
ity to the people, I desire to say 
that the authority of God, in the 
eyes of God, is just as sacred today 
as it ever has been in any past dis- 
pensation. And just as our Heav- 
enly Father has .delighted to bless 
men in past ages, who have honored 
the authority that God has given to 
weak men, so he will delight to 
bless men in this dispensation who 
will honor that authority. And I 
plead with this congregation, that 
men and women, that boys and 
girls, cultivate a disposition to hon- 
or the authority that God has 
placed upon men ; and God will 
honor you, and he will bless you, 
and will reveal unto you the truth, 
more perfectly, continually, of his 
great work that he has established 
for the salvation of the human 
family. 

Without authority, what can be 
accomplished? Our Elder Brother, 
the Lord Jesus Christ, commission- 
ed men in his time to preach the 
everlasting gospel. It could not 
have been preached without that 
authority. Men have forgotten the 
necessity of such divine commission 
in the age in which we live, but the 
necessity exists just the same. It 
is just as needful today for men to 
be properly commissioned in order 



ELDER JOSEPH W. McMURRIK. 



107 



to preach the gospel acceptably, and 
to administer properly in the ordi- 
nances of the gospel, as in any 
other age, and no man can minis- 
ter, mark you, in the name of the 
Lord Jesus Christ, and have his 
ministry sanctified, and approved 
by our Father in heaven, unless he 
be called of God to preach the gos- 
pel. I cannot call myself. That is 
the doctrine of the world, that men 
can feel within themselves, "Why, 
I am called to cry repentance among 
the people." That is not true, that 
is the plan of the adversary, to blind 
the eyes of the human race, that 
they may be led carefully away to 
destruction. -Many men delude them- 
selves with the thought that they 
are called without having been or- 
dained and .designated by the voice 
of the living God. What saith the 
Scripture? "No man taketh this 
honor unto himself, but he that is 
called of God as was Aaron." So 
the inspired apostle hath written, 
and so teaches "Mormonism." This 
is the doctrine pertaining to au- 
thority as it was taught by the apos- 
tles in the meridian of time. The 
salfsame doctrine is taught by the 
apostles of today. Divine authority 
cannot be assumed by any human 
being, without calling down the dis- 
pleasure of the Lord. 

When we consider earthly au- 
thority, we understand the question 
most readily. There is nobody in 
this congregation who imagines 
that any man in this land can feel 
in his heart, "I have been called to 
be a judge in the State of Utah, I 
have that feeling within me." Why, 
even the little boys and girls would 
understand, if a man set forth that 
sort of claim, and sought to main- 
tain it, that there was something 
wrong with him mentally. Judges 
are not appointed by having a call 



that comes from within the indi- 
vidual. A man cannot even be a 
city policeman, or a country con- 
stable by any such feeling taking 
possession of his mind. . He must 
be appointed by proper authority, 
the authority that has its founda- 
tion in the people. We have desig- 
nated how all these various posi- 
tions shall be filled, and for any 
man to imagine that he can fill even 
the humblest of these callings with- 
out being appointed according to 
the law of the land, is but an indi- 
cation of unusual weakness in his 
intellectual powers. 

When we come to the things of 
God, men seem not able to compre- 
hend so readily the need of divine 
authority. Some feel that it is all 
right for men to say within them- 
selves, that they are called to min- 
ister in the name of Jesus Christ, 
that revelation and ordination -ior 
the conferring of authority is non- 
essential. But the doctrine of the 
gospel is, "Ye have not chosen me, 
["the precious words of Jesus 
Christ], but I have chosen you, and 
ordained you, that ye should go and 
bring fruit, * * * that what- 
soever ye shall ask of the Father in 
my name, he may give it you." 
Bible students, is not this the doc- 
trine of the ancient apostles? In 
absolute harmony with this is the 
doctrine of the Prophet Joseph 
Smith, who has declared to us that 
John, the forerunner of the Lord 
Jesus Christ, made his appearance, 
and laid his hands upon Joseph

said, "Upon you, my fellow ser-

sins ; and this shall never be taken 
again from the earth, until the sons 
of Levi do offer again an offering 
unto the Lord in righteousness." 

Such is. a foundation stone of 
"Mormonism." An angel from on 
high, commissioned by the author 
of the everlasting gospel, the Lord 
Jesus Christ, laying his hands upon 
the head of the Prophet Joseph and 
conferring upon him authority. It 
is a bedrock stone, it cannot be 
overturned. It has withstood the on- 
slaughts that have been made in the 
past. No weak place has been found 
in this story of "Mormnoism," 
concerning the restoration of divine 
authority. When we speak of the 
coming of the Father and the Son, 
when we speak of the coming of 
John the Baptist, the forerunner of 
the Redeemer, the being who was 
honored with the high privilege of 
baptizing the Son of God, when we 
speak of Peter, James, and John, 
who came restoring the keys of the 
Melchizedek Priesthood — the men 
upon whom that Melchizedek 
Priesthood was bestowed by the 
Son of God — each restoring the au- 
thority they held in mortality, it is 
a story of strength, that has never 
been overcome, and there has never 
been any faulty place found in it ; 
and I want to say to you, my breth- 
ren and sisters, that with the re- 
storation of this authority that we 
honor, has come the promise of the 
living God that the work established 
under the direction and by the au- 
thority of this Priesthood now re- 
stored, shall endure forever and 
forever. That is the promise of 
God. It shall not be uprooted, it 
shall not be broken to pieces, it 
shall not come to naught, but it 
shall endure. These men so testify, 
I so testify, thank God with all my 
soul, and I know whereof I speak. 



I thought when we started our 
meeting in the open air, of a time 
long ago in Scotland, when 1 stood 
out in the open field, a boy mission- 
ary, with some tremblings and with 
some little fear and doubt in my 
mind ; although born in the Church, 
and taught the principles of the 
gospel ; when I came to minister in 
the name of Jesus Christ, when I 
was far away from father and 
mother, far away from my country 
and people, then there was a cry 
went out from my soul, "Am I a 
servant of Jesus Christ? Have I 
authority to minister in the name 
of the Redeemer of the world?" 
That thought came to me, and that 
cry of anxiety was in my soul, until 
God in his kindness and mercy, and 
in fulfilment of his promise, because 
I was anxious to know the truth, I 
was anxious to do my duty and to 
preach the gospel, revealed to me 
by the power of the Holy Ghost the 
truth of this gospel ; and the hap- 
piest moments I have ever known in 
my life, the happiest moments I 
ever expect to experience in the fu- 
ture of my life, have been and will 
be when T bear record in the name 
of the Lord Jesus Christ, that 
Toseph Smith was called of God to 
be a prophet, and was ordained an 
apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ, 
and commanded to organize this 
Church to which we have given our 
allegiance. 

No wonder we honor authority, 
even the authority of God, and we 
honor every other proper authority, 
the authority in every land ; be- 
cause it is an article of our faith 
that we "believe in being subject to 
kings, presidents, rulers, and mag- 
istrates, in obeying, honoring, and 
sustaining the law," wherever we 
may reside. We have honor for all 
authority, honor for the President

of the United States, love for Amer- 
ica. Why, I wear a little button 
here myself, for two stalwart sons 
who are in the service of the United 
States. Of course it wrenches the 
heart when they say good-bye. It 
wrenches the heart when they write 
that" ? No, we cannot say it, we 
job we have in hand, but we expect 
to do our 'duty, like men, be the cost 
what it may." Do you think we 
can call them back, do you think we 
can say, "O, son, you are not to do 
that?" No, we cannot say it, we 
can only say, "Go forward, my boy, 
in the accomplishment of duty ; con- 
secrate your life to the performance 
of the labor asked of you, even tn 
the laying; down of your life, if 
need be, for what God hath wrought 
in the establishment of this great 
Government of the United States of 
America, must be maintained, God 
having declared that he raised up 
wise men and inspired them to 
write the Constitution of our Coun- 
try, and to make firm and steadfast 
and sure, the Constitution of Amer- 
ica, and extend Liberty at last to 
every land and every people in the 
world. God himself has so said, 
and it is right and pleasing in his 
sight that all men shall enjoy the 
same libertv. It is for that we give 
our sons, that they mav not only 
Uiohold and sustain the institutions 
of our Country, but also establish 
the decree of God, and bring the 
blessings of the land to every na- 
tion under heaven. 

I bear reroH of the truth. I 
know of what I speak. I d ; d not 
obtain it from the teaching of father 
and mother, although, thank God, 1 
had a good father and mother, who 
believed the truth and who loved 
the truth. But when I bore record 
concerning the truth of this gospel. 



I had to obtain that knowledge in 
the same way that father and moth - 
er obtained it before me, by ser- 
vice, by giving my heart to God. 
There is no other way. Father and 
mother could not give me the testi- 
mony and knowledge, let them love 
ic ever so dearly, let them try ever 
so hard, they could only point out 
the way in which I should walk. In 
that path I myself finally came to 
a knowledge of the truth, revealed 
to me by the Lord God, just as it 
had been revealed to my parents be- 
fore me. The same thing is true 
todav. I cannot give a knowledge 
of this gospel to my own sons and 
daughters. T can only sav to them, 
This work is not my work, but His 
who has called me to minister there- 
in. If ve will do his will and test 
these ordinances and principles of 
the jrospel, von shall be brought to 
an understanding of the truth by 
the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, 
and know from the crown of your 
head to the soles of vour feet, that 
God has sooken and has established 
this work in which we are laboring. 

God help us to love it forever and 
forever, to maintain its principles, 
to uphold its authority, and to cul- 
tivate the disposition, every one of 
us, to say, not only when the Presi- 
dent of the Church makes his ap- 
nearance, but to sav to all authority, 
in the wards, and in the stakes, and 
in the miss : ons, "I delisrht to honor 
the man whom God hath honored." 
I humblv prav in the name of the 
Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The conpre°"ation sang: "Do 
What is Right." 

Benediction was pronounced bv 
Elder Hugh S. Geddes, president of 
the Oneida Stake of Zion.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



SECOND OVERFLOW 
[MEETING. 

A second overflow meeting was 
held in the Assembly Hall, at 2 
o'clock p. m., Sunday, October 6, 
Elder Anthony W. Ivins, of the 
Council of the Twelve, presiding. 

Singing' and music were fur- 
nished by the LeGrande ward choir 
under the direction of H. E. Dews- 
nup, chorister. 

The choir and congregation sang : 
"The spirit of God like a fire is 
burning." 

Elder Rodney C. Badger offered 
the opening prayer. 

The choir sang: "The Pilgrim 
Chorus." 

The general authorities of the 
Church were presented by Elder 
Anthony W. Ivins and unani- 
mously voted upon and sustained as 
at the closing meeting in the Taber- 
nacle. 



ELDER ANTHONY W. IVINS 

While I am on my feet, my 
brethren and sisters, I desire to 
call attention to the fact that, at 
the coming election, which will 
soon be held in this state, there 
will be presented to you for your 
vote, either for or against, an 
amendment to the constitution of 
the State of Utah providing for per- 
petual prohibition in this state. We 
already have laws prohibiting the 
manufacture or sale of intoxicating 
liquors in the state, which were 
enacted by the last legislature. 
There was also passed by the last 
legislature a resolution which is to 
be referred to the people amend- 
ing the constitution of the State, so 
that prohibition will become per- 



petual unless the ,state constitution 
shall be again amended. 

I do not think it necessary to en- 
ter into any argument at all to con- 
vince you of the action that ought 
to be taken by Latter-day Saints on 
this measure. We are only just 
now beginning to appreciate the 
benefits that have come to us 
through the abolition of this obnox- 
ious business, and we trust and ex- 
pect, in order that we may be in 
harmony with this nation, with its 
executive who calls our attention 
to the fact that the use of intoxi- 
cating liquors ought to be and must 
be prohibited in the nation, and the 
fact that all civilized nations in the 
world which have engaged in the 
great strug'gle that is now on, so 
far as I am able to learn, have 
placed themselves on record in op- 
position to the use of intoxicants. 
And so we want you to carefully 
consider this question, to think of 
it, and if you want a dry state to 
vote for that amendment to the con- 
stitution. 

May the Lord bless you, my 
brethren and .sisters, and his Spirit 
be with you while we shall contin- 
ue the service this afternoon, I pray 
in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER WM. H. MENDENHALL. 

(President of the Bannock Stake of 
Zion.) 

To begin with, my brethren and 
sisters, I desire to commend to you 
the advice of Brother Ivins in re- 
lation to the constitutional amend- 
ment, prohibiting the manufacture 
and sale of liquor in the State of 
L^tah. We have that amendment 
on the .statute books of the state of 
Idaho, and we would like to see the 
time when every adjoining state 



ELDER WILLIAM H. MENDENHALL. 



Ill 



shall adopt the same constitutional 
amendment. 

In Idaho we have tried two forms 
of prohibition. In the county from 
which I come we have had prohibi- 
tion for a number of years. The 
county seat of our county is Poca- 
tello. I remember in our campaign 
against the traffic in liquor that the 
whisky men tokl us that if we 
adopted the prohibition measure, 
the grass would grow up in the 
streets of Pocatello, business would 
be stagnant, and ruin would come 
to that city. And now after a num- 
ber of years of prohibition in Idaho, 
I am proud to say .to you that Poca- 
tello is the most prosperous city in 
the state, and instead of grass 
growing in the streets, the bu ; H- 
ings that were used for the traffic 
of liquor have been transformed 
into buildings used for other pur- 
noses, the streets and the sidewalks 
have been paved, and the city as a 
whole shows marked improvement 
over the conditions that existed in 
the days when liquor was trans- 
norted and dealt out to the people 
in lour county. So, from the ex- 
perience that we have had I des : rc 
to recommend to the people of the 

tat- of Utah the adoption of the 
constitutional amendment forever 
rrohibitm ' the manufacture and 
cale of Honor in the state of Utah. 
T am verv grateful, my brethren 
sisters, for the opportunity that 
T have of being present at this con- 
ference. I rejoice in the testimony 
of my brethren. I rejoice in the 
instructxn and the counsel given by 
the presiding authorities of the 
Church. And our service does not 
end. my brethren and sisters, at the 
dismissal of this meeting. But we 
who have been in attendance at the 

<=e^sions of this conference have a 



duty to perform after we have gone 
home from this conference of the 
Church. It becomes our duty to 
adopt in our homes the teachings, 
and instructions given by our breth- 
ren. It becomes our duty to dis- 
seminate the principles of the gos- 
pel in our wards, as they have been 
made clear to us, among our friends 
and our brethren and sisters wher- 
ever we may go, that all may have 
the privilege of enjoying the bless- 
ings of this great conference of the 
Church. All men and women in the 
Church have a right to know what 
the Lord expects of them. The Lord 
has said, "If any lack wisdom, let 
him ask of God, who giveth to all 
men liberally and upbraideth not." 
And the Lord Jesus said upon one 
occasion : "Ask and ye shall re- 
ceive, knock and it shall be opened 
unto you." The privilege of 
knowing our standing before the 
Lord, and what the Lord expects* of 
us as members of the Church, is 
within our right, and we have a 
right to go before the Lord and ask 
him, and receive from him inspira- 
tion and revelation pertaining to 
our own selves and the work that 
we should perform as members of 
the Church. 

Every blessing is predicated upon 
law, and in order for us to enjoy 
the blessings of the gospel, we must 
obey the commandments of the 
Lord. If we desire a blessing at 
the hands of the Lord, it becomes 
our duty to ask for it. In that con- 
nection, let me say that the Latter- 
dav Saints should observe their se- 
cret pravers. Latter-dav Samts 
should call their families together 
in the time and season thereof, and 
nour out their souls unto the Lor 1 
that thev mav ^e in communion 
with the Holy Spirit and be direct-

ed in their labors to do the things 
that the Lord requires at their 
hands. 

It is not the rule that the Lord 
shall come to us and bless us with 
blessing's that we need, without our 
asking. In reviewing the history 
of the Church, the Prophet Joseph 
Smith, in the beginning, when his 
mind was wrought up as to which 
of all the religious organizations of 
the world was right, and while he 
was pondering in his own mind, the 
Lord did not come to him and say 
that none of them are right. He 
went out into the woods alone, and 
poured out his soul to God to find 
out which of all the religious or- 
ganizations was right. Then the 
answer came to him in the visita- 
tion of the Father and the Son. The 
Father, pointing to the Son, said to 
the Prophet boy, "This is my be- 
loved Son, in whom I am well 
pleased ; hear ye him." Then the 
voice of the Lord to Joseph was that 
none of the organizations was ac- 
ceptable to him, and that he should 
wait, apart from any organization, 
and in the due time of the Lord he 
should be the instrument in bring- 
ing about God's purposes. Later on, 
when the Prophet desired to learn 
his standing before the Lord, pon- 
dering upon this question while 
lying upon his bed, an angel of the 
Lord appeared to him. Then the 
angel Moroni reconciled the Proph- 
et boy by saying that his labors, his 
acts, were acceptable before the 
Lord, and that he was in good 
standing, hrvine repented of his 
shortcomings, before our Father in 
heaven. Then he rehearsed the 
c torv of rh Q whereabouts of the 
Book o f Mormon, or the plates 
f^orr which : t was afterward trans- 
lated by him. and what the mission 
of the prophet should be in relation 



thereto. Later on, during the trans- 
lation of the Book of Mormon, the 
Prophet and Oliver Cowdery en- 
countered some problem in refer- 
ence to baptism for the remission of 
sins, as recorded in the Book of 
Mormon, and desired to know what 
was meant in relation to the subject 
of baptism by immersion. I pre- 
sume they consulted one with an- 
other, and talked about this matter 
of baptism, but the Lord did not 
come and say, This is the proper 
mode of baptism ; but we find that 
Joseph and Oliver went out and 
prayed to the Lord relative to the 
subject, and while in the attitude of 
supplicating the Lord upon this 
question, John the Baptist appeared 
to the Prophet Joseph Smith and 
Oliver Cowderv, and laid his hands 
upon their heads and ordained them 
to the Aaronic Priesthood, and com- 
manded them to ordain each other, 
and also commanded that they 
should baptize each other. 

So also, when any principle or 
ordinance of the gospel, or any laws 
of the Church, have been given in 
this dispensation, the brethren who 
stand at the head and have the right 
to receive these revelations have 
Qove to the Lord in secret prayer, 
and the Lord has come to them and 
revealed his mind and will upon 
these matters. 

When the question of tithing 
came up in the early historv of the 
Church, the Proohet Joseph went 
to the Lord, and said: "O Lord, 
show unto ns, thv servants, what 
tbrn rentiirest of this people as a 
t ; thinp\" Then the word of the 
Lord came to the Prophet Joseoh. 
that all of the surplus property of 
the people should be turned in as a 
tithmsr of the peoole. and after that 
one-tenth of all their interests 
should be given to the Church for

the upbuilding of Zion upon the 
earth. 

So that is the example set for us. 
While we have not the right to re- 
ceive revelations and visions for the 
Church, as has been explained in 
the discourses of our brethren, yet 
every member of the Church, 
whether he be young or old has a 
right to know his or her standing 
before the Lord, has a right to en- 
joy the testimony and the divine in- 
fluence of the Spirit of the Lord, 
has a right to receive revelation per- 
taining to himself and his .duty and 
ministry in the Church : and it only 
comes to us by our performance of 
■rluty, by our drawing near unto the 
Lord, as in the history of the organ- 
ization and the revelations to the 
Prophet Joseph Smith. 

I rejoice, my brethren and sis- 
ters, in the testimony that I have 
of the gospel of the' Lord Jesus. I 
know it is true. T know that Joseph 
Smith was a prophet of the Lord, 
and that the brethren who have suc- 
ceeded him. including President 
Joseph F. Smith, were prophets, 
seers and revelators, and were the 
right men in the right place. When 
T heard our beloved president say 
in his opening address that for sev- 
enty years he had devoted his time 
to the ministry, to the work of the 
Lord, to the spread of the gospel in 
many lands and climes, and in pre- 
siding among the brethren and sis- 
ters here at home. T honored and 
respected him. When I thousrht of 
the blessings we have enjoyed here 
at home, and of the wisdom and un- 
derstanding exhibited in his life, T 
am certainlv led to say that the Lord 
certainly blesses his servants. If 
we will devote our time and our 
talents to the ministry and the work 
of the Lord, the snirit of the go.s- 
pel. and the establishment of truth 



and righteousness in the earth, the 
Lord will continue to bless us. 

I bear witness to you that the 
Lord has again spoken from heav- 
en, has revealed his gospel, organ- 
ized his Church, and placed therein 
every blessing and gift that is neces- 
sary for tie to develop and grow 
and become like our Father in 
heaven, even in the gospel within 
the Church. It is an individual 
work. Every man must save him- 
self. True, we can do a great deal 
by helping one another, but the sal- 
vation, the exaltation, the blessings 
that we obtain hereafter depend 
upon ourselves, upon our labors 
and faithfulness in keeping the 
commandments of the Lord. 

May the Latter-day Saints every- 
where be faithful and devoted to the 
cause of Christ. We have been told 
during this conference, and it has 
been pointed out to us. of the great 
responsibility of the Church in re- 
lation to this great world war, and 
I trust the Latter-day Samts every- 
where will prepare themselves to do 
theu full duty in whatever calling 
may come to them. This is my 
prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 

ELDER JOSEPH REECE 

(President of the Neho Stake of 
Zion.) 

I sincerely trust, my brethren and 
sisters, that the Lord will bless me 
noon this occasion, that I may be 
able to say something that will in- 
struct vou who have come here to 
learn the ways of the Lord. 

I have one thought in my mind 
at present, which has come to me 
wh'le our brother has been speaking 
i" relation to 'the organization of 
this Church. While he was enu- 
merating to us the different person-

ages whom the Lord has sent from 
the kingdom above to restore unto 
his people this great organization, 
this great Church and Kingdom of 
God in which we are members. 
When we refer to the fact, that our 
kind eternal Father and his Son 
Jesus Christ, the Redeemer of man- 
kind, condescended to come to earth 
in answer to prayer, to deliver unto 
that boy the message which was es- 
sential at that time in order to pre- 
pare the way and to lav the founda- 
tion of this great work, — when we 
speak of the Lord Jesus Christ 
whom the Father introduced on 
that occasion to the boy Prophet a.; 
his Son, "My Only Begotten Son, 
in whom I am well pleased," — the 
question comes to me, who was that 
Son ? It occurs to me that this same 
Jesus Christ, the Redeemer and the 
Son of God, to whom the Father 
introduced the boy, was the same 
Jesus Christ who lived upon the 
earth during the meridian of time ; 
that he was the same Christ that 
was born of the Virgin Mary. He 
was born of a mortal mother and 
an immortal father. He lived upon 
the earth for a short period of time, 
for about 33 years. He entered 
noon his ministry ; he organized his 
Church with apostles, and evangel- 
ists and so on. In time he gave up 
bis life for the sins of the world, 
th?"c all the children of our Father 
•*n h°aven who live today, and who 
lived at the time of the Savior, or 
" T ho had lived noon ;h° earth before 
his dav, or shall live after we have 
passed awav, might be saved 
throusrh obedience to his laws. He 
pave un his life as a ransom for us 
all. My brethren and sisters, the 
Savior who talked with Joseph 
Smith the bov prophet was the iden- 
tical Savior, the identical Testis, who 
was born of the Virgin Mary, who 



was crucified upon Calvary's hill, 
whose body was laid in the tomb, 
and arose from the tomb on the 
third day and appeared to his 
friends and brethren. That identical 
Jesus Christ who was baptized in 
Jordan, appeared to Joseph Smith 
and gave him the necessary instruc- 
tion for the founding of his Church 
in our day. 

Our brother referred to the fact 
that John the Baptist had appeared 
and laid his hands upon Joseph and 
Oliver, conferring upon them the 
priesthood of Aaron, and had given 
them instruction as to how to go 
forth and labor in this great min- 
istry, and how to organize the 
Church of Christ. Who was this 
John? After that messenger had 
delivered his message to the prophet 
and had conferred his priesthood, 
he said, "My name is John, the 
same who is called John the Ba.n- 
tist in the scriptures." He was the 
same man who baptized our Lord 
and Savior, Jesus Christ, in the 
river Jordan, and none other. 

Who were Peter, James and John 
who laid their hands upon those 
two men, and conferred upon them 
the holv Melchizedek priesthood? 
Tt was the same Peter, and the same 
Talipes, and the same John who were 
Wt as the Presidency of the Church 
bv the Savior of the world at the 
time he ascended to heaven. Thev 
held the same authority, and con- 
ferred that authority noon Joseph 
in the dav in which we live. 

T hen we know of other visita- 
tions. We know that Moses ap- 
nea red. We know that Eli i ah ap- 
peared. We know that Moroni an- 
nearerl. and who was Moroni? He 
was the identical person who was 
entrusted with the care and disposi- 
tion of the nlates, the records from 
which the Book of Mormon were

taken, and the identical person who 
placed those plates in a secure place, 
where they were when he revealed 
them to the Prophet Joseph Smith. 
And it was his .duty, his prerogative 
and privilege to come back to this 
earth in his resurrected form, with 
that same body and that same per- 
son and stature, at the proper time, 
and to the proper one. These are 
the facts that have been passing 
through my mind while I was lis- 
tening to the discourse of my 
brother. We know that these things 
are true. 

We know of a surety that there 
will be a resurrection of the body of 
every child of God. These things 
are not a mystery to us. We have 
been blessed with the revelation of 
Go f1 . We have been blessed and fav- 
ored witti a visitation of these great 
men who have come in their resur- 
rected form, and restored thes° 
things. And these things are true, 
my brethren and sisters. There is 
absolutelv no delusion about them. 
True? Why, of course they are 
true. How could they be other- 
wise? How could all these things 
have transoired, how could this 
Church have been organized, and 
how could it have attained to its 
present standing and accomplish- 
ment? How could all the work 
that is beine accomph'shed by this 
Church, for instance the establish- 
ment of the missions that have been 
prooken of. to carrv this truth to the 
nations of the earth? How could 
all this be carried on with zeal and 
that same attainment, if it were not 
true ? 

Yon and T would have faltered 
Irnp- since if these rhinp-s had been 
a delusion. But these things ar° 
true and fa : tM 11 b and we have this 
I'"nw1e/Vp. God has descended to 
reveal it unto us, to all his children. 



We have this advantage over the 
children of the world. We have 
been willing to accept of these pre- 
cious things, and the Lord has been 
merciful unto us. Through the di- 
rection of his Spirit he has per- 
mitted and enabled our leaders, the 
men whom he has chosen, to estab- 
lish this work. Where would we 
have been if it had not been for this 
Church? God has blessed this work 
and prospered it till it has grown to 
the proportions which it has, and 
all these things have been brought 
about, mv brethren and sisters, 
through the obedience of his people 
to the things he has revealed for 
their abidance. 

All these things, these blessings, 
which we have received, have been 
ordamed of God. and brought about 
hv his power. We mav go out into 
<he world to preach the gospel and 
t^ifv to the nations of these truths 
which we have accepted, but we 
camot force them to accept of them. 
T t is not our privilege so to do. 
The Lord does not expect it. but h^ 
has commanded that we carrv this 
message to the world . that we use 
our means and our efforts and our 
talents as he shall bless us from 
time to time, in order that all of his 
children who live upon this earth 
may have the privilege of enjovin^ 
the same blessing and the same 
testimony and the same knowledge 
of things that we as a people en- 
jo v. 

We cannot afford to falter, my 
friends. The work of the ministry 
is great, and we are called and ap- 
pointed each one in our place to 
perform a certain labor. Mv breth- 
ren and sisters, let us attend to that. 
Let us see to it that we are found 
in our places, that we are perform-

vealed for his servants and his 
handmaids to follow. Let us see to 
it that we keep the commandments. 
Let us see to it that we attend to 
our prayers. Let us see to it that 
we attend to our work that he has 
called us to perform. Let us see to 
it that we attend to our worship, 
that we partake of the sacrament 
upon the Sabbath day, and that we 
do all things that will have a tend- 
ency to bring us together and to 
make us more faithful and more 
appreciative of the things that the 
Lord has done and is doing for us 
as a people. 

May God bless us and help us 
appreciate his blessings, and may 
they be increased unto us. May we 
grow in wisdom, in knowledge, and 
understanding. May we continue 
to be so faithful and true that the 
Lord will be pleased to own and 
bless us, as his people. May we be 
able to enjoy every blessing, privi- 
lege and gift which he has in store 
for his' faithful Saints. Nothing 
short of this, my brethren and sis- 
ters, will be satisfactory to you and 
me. May God help us in our weak- 
nesses, that we may be able to over- 
come with his strength, and make us 
equal to every occasion, that we 
may not falter, but that we may ever 
look forward to the promises which 
he has made. May we have the 
testimony burning" in our hearts to 
know that Jesus is the Christ, to 
know that Joseph Smith is a proph- 
et ; to know all that he received, and 
all the visitations that came to him, 
and all that has been revealed and 
restored to the earth, and know that 
these things are true, that we may 
not falter in the least, but continue 
to be faithful in good works, I hum- 
bly pray, in the name of Jesus. 
Amen. 



ELDER JOHN M. HENRIE 

(President of the Panguitch Stake of 
Zion.) 

I pray that the Spirit of the Lord 
may direct me in the remarks I 
make. It has been indeed a great 
blessing to me to have the privilege 
of attending this general conference 
of the Church, and listen to the 
many testimonies that have been 
borne, and further to listen to our 
brethren explain and enlarge upon 
the principles of the gospel that 
have been given to us in this the dis- 
pensation of the fulness of times. 
We have had enumerated to us in 
this meeting events that took place 
in connection with the restoration of 
the gospel. These things are marvel- 
ous and great. Our brethren and 
sisters who lived in the early history 
of the Church, had to wonder as to 
what would be the result of this 
great move, because it was new to 
them'. We live as those who di- 
rect the affairs of business after it 
has become established, by those 
who have gone through with the 
experimental part and have learned 
to know that it was successful and 
good. The stocks of corporations 
become valuable after the corpora- 
tion has made a success, and paid 
great dividends ; and I look upon 
this work' in, that same connection. 
It has become greater to us because 
of our seeing the wonderful success 
that has crowned these events that 
have been enumerated here in our 
meeting. If we had not received 
any advantages because of the vis- 
itation of God the Father and his 
Son Jesus Christ to the world, we 
might not be as strong in our testi- 
mony of its truths. But if as mem- 
bers of the Church we can individ- 
ually see where we have been greatly 



ELDER JOHN M. HENRIE 



117 



blessed because of that event, then 
our standing in the Church ought to 
be esteemed much higher by us much 
more so than if we had lived in the 
early part of the history of the 
Church, when it was experimental 
to a large degree with the people 
who lived at that time. I have 
thought often of my case, and won- 
dered what I would have been, had 
it not been that the glorious visita- 
tion was given to the Prophet 
Joseph Smith, and had not the gos- 
pel been restored. In my case, as 
with many of you, my parents were 
found in different parts of the 
world.. No other means under heav- 
en, probably, could have found 
them, and brought them together, 
and given me birth under such fa- 
orable circumstances and conditions 
as I enjoy. My mother, a little girl 
in a great city in the old country, 
was found and brought out into the 
valleys of these great Rocky moun- 
tains where there was great room 
for development. My father was 
found in an entirely different part 
of the world, and brought here by 
his parents, and united in the house 
of God, under the New and Ever- 
lasting Covenant, for time and 
eternity, to her, who gave me birth, 
with which I am pleased and well 
satisfied. This applies to a very 
large number of Saints who have 
been gathered to these valleys and 
who have had similar history and 
origin. These things have been 
brought about by the restoration of 
the gospel and the establishment of 
this great work. 

Another thing that I want to speak 
of briefly : in the day that the gospel 
was restored, our parents and grand 
parents were groping in darkness 
to a great extent as to what was 
the best means of living, whether,^ 
for instance, it was proper to par- 



take of stimulants to give them the 
strength needed for the accomplish- 
ment of their work. Light came 
through the restored gospel, show- 
ing that men are better without 
stimulants, without the use of nar- 
cotics, and things that have a tend- 
ency to injure and weaken our sys- 
tems. This truth did not come to 
us from a scientific source, but 
through the restored gospel, and by 
revelation from God. To me there 
has been nothing that has blessed 
me more than the words o ; f wisdom 
that were given through the Proph- 
et of God, who received the visit 
from the Father and the Son. You 
apply that to yourselves, as I can 
apply it to myself. We may con- 
template now a great people who 
have been blessed in their bodies 
and in their minds, and above all 
in their spirits, because of the 
knowledge revealed from heaven in 
connection with these other great 
events that took place. 

It has been made known to us 
that our citizenship in this, the 
United States, is in a government 
nearest to God, our Father and the 
government of heaven. Is that any 
advantage to us to have that faith 
in these trying circumstances con- 
fronting the world at the present 
time? To me the knowledge and 
testimony that every effort I put 
forth to assist our government and 
its allies in establishing freedom and 
equal rights among the children of 
men in the world, are stimulants 
to me to perform my duty as a citi- 
zen of the government of the United 
States. Is it any advantage to you 
to have that same knowledge, or 
that same testimony? I am sure 
that you all enjoy it as I enjoy it. 
Is it any advantage for us to know 
that we went down into the waters 
of baptism under the hands of our 



118 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



brethren who received of the priest- 
hood that was given unto the Proph- 
et Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowd- 
ery, by divine administration of 
heavenly beings? It is certainly a 
blessing to me to believe that I was. 
baptized by one who held the 
authority of God, and that my sins 
were remitted because of that bap- 
tism, and that through the imposi- 
tion of hands of those who are in 
authority I am entitled to the Holy 
Ghost to direct my every act in life. 
This is not, as I view it, any longer 
guess-work, or a matter of wonder 
as to what the result will be, be- 
cause I see, as I associate among the 
children of the Latter-day Saints, 
men and women in every part of 
this state and in other states, and 
in every part of the world, people 
who have been enlig'htened through 
the imposition of hands and the re- 
ception of the Holy Ghost. 

Is there any one who has a de- 
sire to know the things of the Lord 
that could not accept of these great 
principles, and see that they were a 
blessing to them because of having 
received them ? Is it any advantage 
to me as a husband and a father to 
know that I was married in the 
house of God, and that my _wif§ 
and children were sealed unto me 
for time and eternity, and that we 
shall know each other in our family 
circle throughout eternity? Does 
that bless us, my brethren and sis- 
ters, or are we still in wonderment 
as to whether that is a good doctrine 
or not ? It seems to me that no man 
or woman who is honest could deny 
the very power and effect of such 
a doctrine as that being taught to 
the children of men. 

Now, as I said, we are not guess- 
ing any longer as to what will be the 
result, but we live in this day when 
the God of heaven has permitted us 



to see the result and to know what 
the effect has been among the chil- 
dren of men. We see here an or- 
ganization of people who stand 
wholly and unitedly behind the great 
cause of the great portion of the 
world that are fighting for the lib- 
erty and the uplift of mankind. I 
do not know of anything that gave 
me greater pleasure than to see the 
unanimous vote of that great gath- 
ering of people this morning sus- 
taining and supporting the president 
of the Church to appropriate all of 
the means that we could .spare from 
the treasury of the Church to sup- 
port this great cause. 

There are two things that I have 
a greater appreciation for this day 
than any others. One is a knowl- 
edge of the truthfulness of the gos- 
pel, that we are in the light, that we 
know to that extent that we serve 
God, and develop within us the 
Spirit of God and magnify the 
priesthood that he has given to us, 
that our lives are acceptable to him, 
and that we can ,see that the result 
is good, that we are made stronger 
and more perfect and Godlike than 
without the organization of the 
Church and the principles of the 
gospel as they have been given un- 
to us. I believe in this day when 
our time is required for so many 
different purpose that we ought to 
be sure that we do not neglect any- 
thing that pertains to the gospel of 
Christ and our eternal salvation, 
that we may thus have power with- 
in ourselves not only to serve our 
country in this time of need, but to 
serve God,, and this is one of the 
great things that I am most pleased 
for. Another thing is citizenship 
in this great Government of the 
Linked States, and the faith that 
has come to me that its Constitution 
is an inspired instrument, and that 



ELDER JOSEPH E. ROBINSON 



119 



the Declaration of Independence 
was never made by man alone. Man 
would not have had courage and grit 
to have undertaken such a thing, but 
it was inspired of God, and the Con- 
stitution of the United States is su- 
perior to the documents or charters 
or constitutions of any other gov- 
ernment given unto men. This great 
organization of government is big 
enough to take in all peoples as rap- 
idly as they are able to come in and 
enjoy the blessings of it. 

I feel that as Saints of God we 
should realize the great responsi- 
bilities that rest upon us in the ser- 
vice of God, and live up to the re- 
quirements of the gospel in full, and 
develop within ourselves the Spirit 
of God, and a determination to be 
worthy, true citizens of this great 
Government, and assist it to the full- 
est possible extent. 

I rejoice in the testimony of the 
truth of the true gospel, and in the 
testimony of the truthfulness of the 
mission of the men who preside in 
the Church in this day, as well as 
those who have preceded them, in 
the past history of the Church. I 
am glad to feel within my soul, that 
Joseph F. Smith is a prophet and 
that he is recog'nized of the Lord 
as the head of the only Church rec- 
ognized of God in the world ; and 
that his brethren who are numbered 
with him as counselors, apostles, 
seventies, stake presidents, and bish- 
ops, are in line and in harmony 
with him. I am glad to know for 
myself that the gospel is true, and 
that there is power in it to save 
men from destruction and eternal 
torment and sufferings. There is 
no other people in a condition to 
know and enjoy the great blessings 
that the Latter-day Saints possess. 
Let us rejoice in that truth. Let us 
develop a further knowledge and 



gain a greater power than we have 
already gained, is my prayer, in the 
name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

A young ladies' trio sang: "I 
bring hearts-ease." 

ELDER JOSEPH E. ROBINSON. 

(President of the California Mission.) 

How blessed it is, my brethren 
and sisters, to have faith in God 
and in his work ; to know in one's 
own soul that Jesus is the Christ, 
the Redeemer, the Savior of man- 
kind, the Mediator of the New 
Covenant, and one who pleads with 
God for the salvation of his breth- 
ren and sisters. This is the thought 
that came to me whilst our breth- 
ren were bearing witness of the 
testimony of truth that is welling 
'up in their souls. They are not 
tossed about by every wind of doc- 
trine, not driven with the wind, 
not moved out of their place. Yet, 
whilst they were speaking I won- 
dered if here you had met some 
such conditions or whether you 
have had any such cases as we have 
met in the mission pver which I 
preside, of men who would "run 
without being sent," men who did 
not await until they were called up- 
on before they think they can be 
teachers of men, and who rise up 
with their hands to steady the ark 
of the covenant. 

I have wondered if in this land 
you have had any who are "mighty 
and strong who are come to divide 
by lot the inheritances of the 
Saints." We have had five such 
in the California mission since I 
have had the honor to preside in it. 
They have come to naught, and 
dwindled away. One in particular 
that I have in mind, who gathered 



120 



GENMRAt CONFERENCE. 



about him quite a little body of 
honest people, God-fearing people, 
humble and contrite and repentant 
when they were shown the error of 
their ways, for T had the privilege 
of baptizing a goodly number of 
them. This man went on for years, 
pretending that sometime he would 
come as a mighty and strong one 
and set the Church in order. He 
said that the people would be tried 
in all things ; so frequently he 
would be drunken with wine, that 
they might be tried in that way, and 
he reveled in the use of some drugs 
and tobacco, so that they might be 
tried in their faith because of this 
weakness. He took wives from 
.some men and gave them to others, 
and then took them himself, and 
then turned them back to the orig- 
inal husband, that they might bt 
tried in that way. And still they 
endured it because of their faith - 
in .some of his prophecies and the 
manner in which he interpreted the 
scriptures. When stricken and 
about to die, he was taken to a hos- 
pital, and several days before his 
death he told them not to bury him, 
but to watch over his body for 
three days and he would come and 
take it up again and establish them 
in their inheritance in Zion before 
God forever. They watched his 
body for six days, and then they 
buried him. 

I have wondered if there has 
been any one come to you who 
wanted to establish the "Order of 
Enoch," who want you to "join the 
United Order." We have had such 
one, and when certain of che 
Saints, his associates, moved by his 
testimony and his oratory, joined 
with him to have a "community of 
interests," in all of their real estate 
and effects, and they came with the 
deeds to their lands to be conveyed 



to the body that was being organ- 
ized by him, and they asked him 
for his deed, why, he had deeded 
his property to his wife and all he 
had was but the watch that he wore. 
This made them a little bit jealous' 
and fearful of the scheme, and so 
it all came to nothing. So I have 
noted that some men here at home, 
who have met with financial fail- 
ures, are quite willing to join the 
"Order of Enoch," and have the 
people pay their debts and take care 
of their families. I don't know 
whether you have met any such 
or not. 

I want to read to you, thus ex- 
tending the remarks of my breth- 
ren this afternoon, and what was 
said in the general conference yes- 
terday, from the Doctrine and Cov- 
enants, 42 : 1 1 : 

"And again, I say unto you, that 
it shall not be given to any one to go 
forth to preach my gospel, or to build 
up my Church, except he be ordained 
hv some one who has authority, <md 
it is known to the Church that he has 
authority, and has been regularly or- 
dained by the heads of the Church." 

Has any one been telling you that 
God can raise up a prophet at any 
time? That it does not require the 
authority of man to make proph- 
ets and apostles and leaders of the 
people? Have they quoted to you 
that Paul has said, that he "was an 
apostle not by man nor the hands 
of man," as a proof of this doc- 
trine? Or, that God sent his angel 
to ordain John when he was eight 
days old, or that he ordained Esaias 
by his own hands? If they have, 
they have told you the same things 
I have heard in the mission field. 
T am mindful of the fact that the 
least deacon in the Church could say 
with as much appropriateness as 



JOSEPH E, ROBINSON 



121 



Paul that he has the priesthood, 
"not by man nor by the hands of 
man," for man did not bring the 
priesthood, did not ordain it and 
cannot bestow it within and of 
himself. The priesthood of the 
Son of God is without beginning 
of days or end of years ; without 
father, and without mother, and 
without descent ;" but it is always, 
and has ever been given under the 
hands of some one 'whom God hath 
appointed. Paul was chosen and 
set apart to the ministry with 
Barnabas, by the Apostles, in the 
Church, and he was sent by the 
Lord, Jesus Christ, to Ananias, in 
Damascus, that through Ananias 
he might receive the Holy Ghost; 
and Cornelius, devout as he was, 
and visited by angels, did not re- 
ceive the Holy Ghost until the prop- 
er authoritv had been sent to him 
to bestow it. And so we may rest 
assured that John received his 
priesthood either from his father, 
who held it and who ministered at 
the altar in the temple, or from 
some one who was authorised to 
give the 'priesthood. Men may be 
appointed and ordained to fill cer- 
tain positions ; but all the wav 
through you find that the priest- 
hood came through the proper ord- 
er in the Church. Esaias received 
his priesthood at the hand of Mel- 
chizedek, the great high priest. So 
when, men claim these things, they 
are either ambitious to claim lead- 
ership themselves or have lo.st sight 
of the word of the Lord in refer- 
ence to priesthood and presidency. 

I am told that this 85th section of 
the Doctrine and Covenants, writ- 
ten into a letter of the Prophet 
Joseph Smith as he wrote to W. 
W. Phelps, is yet to be fulfilled, 
and men are teaching it and writ- 
ing about it today as they have been 



from the very time it came forth in 
the Church, and it was given No- 
vember, 1832. T want to read just 
a little. And if you will read the 
48th and 51st sections, you will find 
how the Lord determined that his 
Saints should receive their inherit- 
ances in Zion. They were conse- 
crating their goods when they were 
converted in the world and send- 
ing their funds up to Jackson 
county, to the Bishop of the Church, 
who was to buy lands for them, 
and give it to them "legally" by 
"deed" under the law, that they 
might receive it in severalty for 
themselves and their heirs after 
them. And when people had sent 
their moneys and then emigrated to 
Zion they found the Bishop was a 
little slow in doing his appointed 
work. The anger of the Prophet 
was aroused, and he wrote to 
Brother Phelps how badly tried he 
was over this matter, that people 
who had sold all they possessed, 
and had left their friends in the 
East and had sent their moneys 
ahead of them to Zion, and then 
came there, and found there was no 
place there, no inheritance prepared. 
It looked like a fraud upon the face 
of it. So he wrote to Brother 
Phelps how his soul was wrought 
up over this matter. Yet some men 
can read into this revelation, this 
letter of the Prophet, an event yet 
to be. I want to read to you just 
one paragraph when this one 
mighty and strong was to come, for 
we read here that record of all 
things that transpire in Zion should 
be kept, and that all who consecrat- 
ed property should receive an in- 
heritance legally from the Bishop. 
And if the Bishop would not do 
this, then God would send a mighty 
and strong one who would see that 
it was done, and that man*who zvas 



122

appointed and who was called of 
God, "that putteth forth his hand 
to .steady the ark of God, shall fall 
by the shaft of death, like as a tree 
that is smitten by the vivid shaft of 
lightning - ." A man in 1832 must 
today be 112 or 115 years of age, to 
say the least. Do any of you know 
of a man who was appointed at that 
time to do a work who is still liv- 
ing? And yet men, deluded by the 
cunning influences of the adversary, 
would today see a present fulfil- 
ment of these words as I have read 
them to you. 

How delightful it is, how thank- 
ful men should be, that God gra- 
ciously has given them faith, that 
they do not question his authority, 
that they are willing to follow the 
lead of the brethren who have been 
called to preside in the Church ; and 
we may rest assured that there will 
be none come out of this order, for 
as I read to you, they who preach 
the gospel or organize any of its 
branches or set in operation any of 
its functions must be regularly or- 
dained by the heads of the Church, 
and be known by the Church. 
So even if John should come, as 
some friends would try to make me 
believe, how would he be known? 
"O, his prophetic power and his 
personality would ■ declare him," 
they say. Aye, but that does not 
answer. The Lord has said, that 
he that is called must be regularly 
ordained by the heads of the 
Church, and knozvn by the people 
of the Church. While I agree John 
has a great work to perform yet, 
as we read in the scriptures, if he 
comes to us it will be as he came 
to the Prophet Joseph Smith, and 
■doubtless with other witnesses. 
Their work will have to be done by 
and through the proper order and 
priesthood, and through the proper 



and correct channels of the Church, 
and the people will know and un- 
derstand it, and it will not be a side 
issue, where Southerner or North- 
erner or West-man or "East-man" 
can say 'T am he." It is true that 
when the Prophet Joseph had his 
vision there was none others pres- 
ent of mortal men ; but the Father 
and the Son, two witnesses, were 
there, and when we stand before 
the pleasing bar of Almighty God, 
they will bear witness to the un- 
believer, that they revealed them- 
selves to the boy Prophet in this 
day, and under their divine guid- 
ance and instruction he set up the 
Church of Christ for the last time. 
And when John came with his, the 
Aaronic Priesthood, there were 
Joseph and Oliver present. When 
Peter and James in their resurrect- 
ed bodies and John still in the flesh 
came, there was Joseph and Oliver 
again. When the might v angels, 
Adam or Michael, and Elias and 
Elijah came, in the Kirtland temple, 
there were the brethren to bear 
witness of it, and "every word of 
the gospel shall be established in 
the mouth of two or more wit- 
nesses." So when one man rises 
vp> to iudge Israel, and to sav how 
we shall walk, and to divide the 
word of God to us, even though 
he claims an angel has visited him, 
we should look with suspicion upon 
that individual. In the last days, it 
is true that God would pour out 
his Spirit upon all flesh, and "their 
old men shall dream dreams, and 
their voting men shall see visions, 
and their sons and their daughters 
shall prophesv," that is not limited 
alone to the Church of Christ. It 
is to all flesh who accept the Christ 
as their Pedeemer. There are wise 
men in the world and there are 
daughters who prophesy ; but I am 



JOSEPH E. ROBINSON. 



1?3 



afraid there are some in the Church 
who dream dreams only. I have 
told the sisters in our mission, for 
several of them have dreamed 
dreams, that there has been no pro- 
vision for them to dream dreams 
for the Church. "Their old men 
shall dream dreams, their young 
men shall see visions, and their sons 
and daughters shall prophesy," but 
there is no chance for the sisters to 
dream dreams. So when they come 
to me with their wondrous dreams 
about what I .should do in order to 
establish the Church to save the 
Saints from destruction, I have met 
it with more or less suspicion 
despite their faithfulness and their 
sweetness and the consideration 
that should be given them because 
of their regard for me per.sonallv 
and for my people. But I am afraid 
of dreamers of that kind. 

I have never asked, since I ar- 
rived at the. age of judgment, and 
of ripe manhood, nor since I have 
been called to preside in the order 
of God and labor in his ministry, — 
I have not asked for visions nor 
tongues, nor the gift of prophecy, 
in the sense of being a prophet to 
Tsrael. T have asked for &ood com- 
mon sense. I have asked the Lord 
to keen me humble and stable : and 
T thank him with all my heart that 
I believe his word and sustain, with 
all mv heart, his priesthood. If I 
cannot both with my head and mv 
heart love him, let me love him with 
my heart alone and believe in his 
WOfd with all mv soul. I pray that 
it shall not be left to mv head alone, 
which mav err, and which is cold, 
and calculating. You wives want 
to be loved by your husbands with 
their whole hearts. No matter how 
much thev admire you, and speak 
of yotir graces with their lips, and 
tell of your virtues, you want their 



hearts. And ,so God has said, "O 
son, give me thy heart." We are 
told by the poet Holland, who was 
at once a poet and philosopher, that 

"Ofttimes the heart is wiser than the 
intellect, 

And leads with swifter hands and 
surer feet to wise conclusions." 

These men who spend all their 
time trying to figure out in the 
scriptures what awaits us, and to 
steady the ark by their interpreta- 
tion of the word of God, ofttimes 
are giving their heads to the ad- 
versary and withholding . their 
hearts from God, and stand on dan- 
gerous ground. 

I ask for the faith of the ancient 
seer who, stripped of his riches, his 
children taken from him, his friends 
finding fault with him ; sitting in 
the ashes of a once happy home, 
afflicted with a nauseating, humil- 
iating, disease, scraping the exuda- 
tions of that disease from his bodv 
with a potsherd ; his wife sickened 
with his appearance and what he 
had passed through, saying to him, 
"Whv don't you curse God and 
die ?" said, exulting in his heart be- 
cause he knew his God and his sal- 
vation, "Though he slay me, yet 
will I trust in him," for, "Though 
after my skin worms destroy this 
body of mine, yet in mv flesh shall 
I see God, whom I shall see for mv- 
self, and mine eyes shall behold, 
and not another, though my reins 
be consumed within me." 

I want the faith of Paul who, 
persecuted, maligned, misunder- 
stood, imprisoned, poverty stricken, 
earning his own livelihood as he 
oreached by the wavside, appealing 
from the courts of Rome to the 
Caesar himself, the head of the Ro- 
man government, in order, I take it, 
that he might bear witness of the 



124 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Christ to the very head of the civ- 
ilized world at that time, (for he 
need not have gone had he not de- 
sired it), I want the faith that he 
had after he had borne his testi- 
mony, after he had bidden farewell 
to the Saints, as he wrote to his 
loved son by adoption, Timothy, 
from his prison cell, perhaps by the 
rays of the sinking sun, that last 
that set for him in mortal life, these 
words: "I have fought the goo r l 
fight, I have kept the faith, I have 
finished my course, and henceforth 
there is laid up for me a crown of 
righteousness, which God, the just 
iudge, giveth to all those who love 
him and his appearing." 

I want the faith of President 
Smith who, after seventy long years 
of service, whilst broken in body 
with the responsibilities and labor 
of guiding this people, said : "Al- 
though I am weak in body, I was 
never stronger in my spirit and in 
my intellect and my determination 
to serve God and keep his com- 
mandments than today." You heard 
him Friday morning bear witness 
of that in our conference. 

I want the faith of the Prophet 
To.seph Smith, who thought per- 
haps if he withdrew from his peo- 
ple for a little season, he might re- 
lieve them from persecution ; but, 
his wife, like Job's wife, sent for 
him complamingly with others, ask- 
ing him to return to the body of 
the Church. He said : "If mv life, 
is no longer of worth to mv friends, 
it is useless to me," and added 
these words, as he set his face to- 
ward Carthage, knowing full well 
that his blood would be shed to bear 
witness of the Christ and the mes- 
sage he gave in this day: "I am 
p-oing like a lamb to the slaughter, 
but I am calm as a summer's morn- 
ing; T have a conscience void of 



offense towards God and towards 
all men. I shall die innocent, and 
it shall yet be said of me, 'He was 
murdered in cold blood.' " Dare 
any sycophant, any heretic, any fal- 
len teacher, any coward, use the 
words that the Prophet Joseph did ? 
Dare any man within and of him- 
self, unless his conscience was void 
of offense toward God and man, 
declare such a thing when he knew 
that death awaited him on the mor- 
row? O, the peace of Christ which 
passeth the understanding of man ; 
when it takes possession of the souls 
of his children, they are unmoved 
as a rock. When dire things come 
to them, they are unafraid, and like 
Joseph, "calm as a summer's morn- 
ing," content to await their redemp- 
tion, for they are not afraid of the 
bar of God, when they shall stand 
in the flesh for the final judgment. 

I want the faith of Hyrum, so 
sweet in his soul, so full of loyalty 
and fealty to his brother, the 
Prophet, reading the words of Mo- 
roni, who had seen ten thousand 
led by him, murdered about the Hill 
Cumorah ; who before closing the 
record of the Nephites uses these 
words, and Hyrum read them be- 
fore that last trip to Carthage, and 
turned the leaf down, upon them 
as his testimony : 

"And it came to pass that I pray- 
ed unto the Lord that he would eive 
unto the Gentiles grace, that they 
might have charity. And it came to 
pass that the Lord said unto me, if 
they have not charity it mattereth 
not unto thee, thou hast been faith- 
ful, wherefore thy garments shall 
be clean. And because thou hast 
seen my weakness, thou shalt be 
made strong, even unto the sitting 
down in the place which I have pre- 
pared in the mansions of my Fath- 
er. And now I, Moroni, bid fare-

well unto the Gentiles, yea, and also 
unto my brether whom I love, until 
we shall meet before the judgment 
seat of Christ, where all men shall 
know that my garments are not 
spotted with your blood." 

May each one of us have that 
faith dwelling in our hearts that we 
may not be afraid when we stand 
before the pleasing bar of Christ, 
is my prayer, in the name of th^ 
Lord Jesus. Amen. 

The choir sang: "God is our 
refuge." 

Benediction was pronounced by 
Elder Milando Pratt.

ELDER DON C. DRIGGS. 

(President of the Teton Stake of 
Zion.) 

My brethren and sisters. — It is 
certainly gratifying to be here today 
to participate in the exercises of 
this great conference of the Church. 



This is my first meeting of the con- 
ference. I happened to be engaged 
in the Government service, volun- 
tarily, in one of the departments of 
our Government, and was called 
away at the conference date to at- 
tend a meeting in Boise, and I have 
tried to fill both appointments. I 
came in this morning with the hope 
of getting in touch with the con- 
ference spirit and taking back some- 
thing that would be valuable to my- 
self and my people who live in one 
of the stakes established in the last 
few years in Idaho, a growing state, 
which is inhabited in the southern 
part, by Latter-day Saints. It has 
only been a few years ago it seems 
to me, that our people began to mi- 
grate into Idaho, to overflow the 
boundaries of this state. I remem- 
ber that at the time we went into 
Idaho, it was a period of depression 
in the Church, and the authorities 
felt the need of the young people 
staying at home, but they allowed 
a few of us to go over there. We 
have established a stake of Zion in 
that part of the country, have de- 
veloped now into quite a colony, and 
a good part of the Church is located 
within the boundaries of the state 
of Idaho. 

I rejoice in the progress of the 
Church, of the latter-day work, and 
that I have been permitted to have 
a humble part in its establishment, 
in its growth and development. I 
like to keep in touch with the spirit 
of the work and the progress of the 
Church, and know that I am in 
harmony with those who are 
charged with the responsibilty of 
carrying the work of the Lord. 

I rejoice in the work that our 
boys are doing, in the spirit that 
they are manifesting, not only in 
their loyalty to the Government of 
the Lmited States, but in the feel- 



126 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



ing- that comes to them at the same 
time, that they desire to place them- 
selves in harmony with the Church, 
and seek the blessings it is their 
right to enjoy, before they depart 
on their great mission of service to 
their country. I have noticed that 
as our boys go out in the service of 
our country, that they begin to think 
about the possibilities of the bless- 
ings that are vouchsafed unto them 
through the channels of the Priest- 
hood, and have a desire to receive 
these blessings. I feel that the ex- 
perience that our boys are getting 
in the service of our country is 
going to make them appreciate also 
the service that they may give to 
the Church. 

I believe that the spirit that the 
boys have in desiring to go forth in 
the service of their country is also 
enjoyed by the people. We find that 
our boys are not satisfied to stay 
back in the training camps, but are 
eager to get to the front, and when 
they get to the front "over there," 
that they are not satisfied to stay 
back, but are eager to get right on 
the firing line. We are beginning 
to get that spirit ourselves as a 
people. When the calls are made 
upon us from time to time to do ser- 
vice for our country, there is an 
eagerness to get into the front line, 
and to go "over the top." I am 
proud of the record we are making 
in this particular. I am proud of 
the record of the people in our par- 
ticular part of the country, and 1 
want to state here that at 8 o'clock- 
on the night of the drive for this 
Fourth Liberty Loan, we were able 
to telegraph to headquarters that 
we had gone "over the top," just 
at the close of the first day. And 
that is the spirit that is being mani- 
fest in our part of the country. I 
know it is the spirit all over the 



country, and especially .among the 
Latter-day Saints. I rejoice that we 
so readily take up the cause of our 
country, because it is really the 
■cause that we have been hgnung 
for ourselves these many years ; and 
it is characteristic of the Latter-day 
Saints that they adapt themselves 
to the needs of their country, and 
when an opportunity comes, that 
they are ready and willing to show 
their devotion and patriotism. These 
thoughts are uppermost in our 
minds. I know that we may be ex- 
cused for talking about them in our 
meetings, and we can be satisfied 
with the feeling that it is in har- 
mony with the teachings that we 
have always received. 

I rejoice in the testimony of the 
gospel of Jesus Christ. I desire to 
remain faithful to that testimony. 
I desire, as long as I am permitted 
to live upon the earth, to be permit- 
ted to have a desire and disposition 
to raise my voice in defense of the 
Church, and to live so as to be 
worthy of the blessings of the Lord. 
I pray that his favor and blessing 
may be enjoyed by all of us, that 
we may continue faithful in the 
discharge of every duty and obliga- 
tion resting upon us, in the name 
Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER JOHN M. BAXTER. 

(President of the Woodruff Stake of 
Zion.) 

I have enjoyed all of the sessions 
of this Conference, my brethren and 
sisters, and the sweet influence that 
has attended its meetings. I most 
humbly pray and desire that while 
we are assembled this afternoon, in 
this little meeting, the same sweet 
influence may attend us. 

The first article of faith of the 



ELDER JOHN M. BAXTER. 



127 



Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
clay Saints reads: "We believe in 
God the Eternal Father, and in his 
Son Jesus Christ, and in the Holy 
Ghost." It seems to me that all of 
the Christian world claim to believe 
in God our Eternal Father and in 
his Son Jesus Christ; but we, as 
Latter-day Saints, have a knowl- 
edge of God that the world does 
not have. We believe in the God of 
Abraham and Isaac and Jacob, the 
God of our fathers. 

We read in the 18th chapter of 
Genesis, that God made himself 
known to Abraham, on the plains of 
Mamre. He talked with him and 
ate with him, and associated with 
him, as one man talks and eats and 
associates with another. Abraham 
had great faith in God, because of 
his knowledge of God, because he 
had associated with him, had been 
near him. At the time of the de- 
stination of the cities of the plain, 
when God came down himself, 
Abraham had great influence with 
him concerning those things, be- 
cause of his knowledge and faith in 
God the Eternal Father. 

Isaac and Jacob were both famil- 
iar with God, and therefore, they 
had great faith in him. 

Our Lord and Savior, Jesus 
Christ, when upon the earth, said 
he was the very image of his Father 
in heaven, and those who had seen 
him had also seen the Father. They 
were so much alike in person that 
whoever looked upon the person of 
Jesus Christ could see in him the ex- 
act image of his Father ; and we 
know that our Savior had a body 
the same as the body of a man, and 
he mingled with men upon the earth, 
ate with them, conversed with them, 
and finally laid his body in the tomb 
as other men are laid away whe» 



they pass from this state of exist- 
ence. 

In our dispensation, the Lord has 
again revealed himself to men upon 
the earth. In answer to prayer, 
God the Eternal Father and his 
Son Jesus Christ appeared to Joseph 
Smith. They were in appearance 
similar to men, and they conversed 
with him, the Father saying, "This 
is my beloved Son, hear ye him." 
The Savior of the world conversed 
with the boy prophet, and instructed 
him concerning his future mission 
upon this earth. 

Now, my brethren and sisters, 
there is a great deal of difference 
between saying that we believe in 
God, and in Jesus Christ, his Son, 
and knotting God. We are told 
that to know God, and Jesus Christ 
his Son, is eternal life. And I be- 
lieve that is the only way that we 
will ever attain to eternal life, to 
obtain # a knowledge of God, our 
Eternal Father. I do not believe 
we can successfully worship him 
unless we know who he is. 

I believe that there are a great 
many people in the world today, 
who are *in the same condition tnai 
the people were at Athens when 
Paul went there, on one occasion. 
He saw upon an alter this inscription 
"Unto the unknown God ;" and he 
said, "Him whom ye ignorantly 
worship, declare I unto you ;" and 
then he preached unto them the 
true and the living God, the Father 
of our spirits, the creator of the 
heavens and the earth, the seas, 
and the fountains of water, and all 
that in them is. 

And that is the God whom we 
serve, worship, and pray to. We 
have faith in him, because of our 
knowledge of him. It seems to me 
that it is the only way we can 



128 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



have faith in anything. Our be- 
lief in anything" is through the 
knowledge that we have of that 
in which we believe. When we 
pray to God our Eternal Father, 
we expect our prayers to be an- 
swered. We pray in sincerity, as 
Latter-day Saints, and we have all 
faith and hope that our prayers 
will be answered. 

There are people praying today, 
in all this world, who never prayed 
before ; and it is difficult indeed 
Ifor people to pray to God who 
have not faith in him. It is evi- 
dent to me that a great majority of 
the people of the world today that 
I have been associated with, out- 
side of the Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints, do not know 
to whom they are praying ; they do 
not have a knowledge of God. If 
they had, they would not profane 
his name in one breath, and pray to 
him in the next. We are l;ving in 
an age of profanity. God has com- 
manded his people, Thou shalt not 
take the name of the Lord thy God 
in vain ;" and yet, over all this broad 
land, we find men and boys, young 
and old, who ought to know better, 
profaning the name of God ; and 
now, when distress, trials and troub- 
les are coming to them through this 
terrible world war, they are turn- 
ing to the Lord, endeavoring to 
pray to him for the protection of 
their sons, and those who are near 
and clear to them, who have been 
called into the war. 

The Lord has said, "If you will 
turn unto me, I will turn unto you." 
If you will turn unto God, he will 
turn unto you. If you will resist 
the devil, he will flee from you. 
And I believe in that saying. I be- 
lieve that it is true. If we have 
profaned the name of Deity, we 
have not known what we were do- 



ing, we have not known the true 
and the living God. I believe if 
those who have been guilty of it 
will repent, draw near unto the 
Lord in prayer, that he will draw 
near unto them and they will be 
forgiven for that which they have 
done. I believe in the principle of 
repentance, whether it is of pro- 
fanity, or the breaking of the Sab- 
bath day, or any other command- 
ment that the Lord has given unto 
us. After we have attained to a 
knowledge of these things, and 
know that we have done wrong, 
and we repent, the Lord will for- 
give us ; and so sure as we draw 
near unto him, so sure also will he 
draw near unto us, and his Holy 
Spirit will be with us, and guide 
and direct us in our lives. But we 
ought to pray consistently to God. 

I remember one little incident that 
brought this matter to my mind a 
few days ago. A man with whom 
I am well acquainted, a member of 
the Church, who has not done any- 
thing in the way of performing his 
spiritual duty in the Church, had 
never prayed before in his life 
with his family. He had an invalid 
mother who herself had been a 
praying woman, but his boys had 
never been taught to pray.' When 
they had gone away from home, 
they wrote letters home. The in- 
fluence that surrounded them at 
home in the organizations of the 
Church, appealed to them then 
more than it had at home ; and they 
wrote to their father and mother 
that they wanted them to pray for 
them night and morning. They 
wanted to be remembered in their 
prayers.. And this man, after that, 
commenced to pray to the Lord for 
the preservation of his boys. After 
# conversation with him regarding 
it, and he had informed me himself 



ELDER JOHN M. BAXTER. 



129 



that he had started to attend to his 
prayers, the next Sunday on my 
way to attend meeting' in our stake 
of Zion, I found him and his whole 
force of men (because he was a 
rancher ) working upon the Sab- 
bath day, just the same as on any 
other day of the week, — though 
doubtless on the evening of that 
Sabbath day, he knelt down, in his 
home and called upon the Lord to 
preserve the lives of his sons who 
were away. 1 do not feel that his 
life was consistent, or that his 
prayers were consistent. It will be 
very difficult for him to have faith 
in God the Eternal Father ; and it 
is said that without faith, it is im- 
possible to please God, for he that 
cometh to God must believe that he 
is, and that he is a rewarder of them 
that diligently seek him. There- 
fore, under those conditions, I can- 
not see how a man could have faith 
in God, and faith that his prayers 
would be answered. James the 
apostle tells us that when we ask 
anything from the Lord, we must 
.ask in faith, believing, never waver- 
ing, for he that wavereth is as the 
waves of the sea, driven by the 
winds and tossed ; and we should 
not think that any man under those 
conditions will receive the favor of 
the Lord. When we waver, we are 
unsettled in our minds as to whom 
we are praying. When we have 
never had a knowledge of God the 
Eternal Father, it is very difficult 
indeed for us to have faith in him, 
and have faith that our prayers will 
be answered. 

It seems to me that this present 
time in the world's history, is a time 
of repentance, a time when we 
should repent of our sins. If we 
have done evil, we will do evil no 
more ; and we will find grace in the 
sight of God our heaveny Father, 



that our faith in him will be in- 
creased that our prayers may be 
answered. 

It seems to me that it is a time 
that we should turn to the Lord, 
if we have disregarded his law, 
broken the Sabbath day, and des- 
ecrated that holy day that he has 
commanded us to keep holy. We 
should repent of it, and observe the 
Sabbath clay, work six days of the 
week, and upon the seventh day go 
to the house of the Lord, partake 
of the Sacrament there, and renew 
our covenants with him, promise 
that we will serve him and keep his 
commandments through the week 
that is before us. If. we have been 
in the habit of breaking the com- 
mandment which God gave that 
we should not take the name of the 
Lord our God in vain, we should 
repent of that, and not do. it any 
more, but be humble and prayerful, 
ask forgiveness of God for the des- 
ecration of his name, go before him 
and put ourselves right before the 
Lord, not only in those two things 
of which I have spoken, but in 
everything that we have clone that 
is wrong. It seems to me it is a 
fitting time, in this particular age 
of the world's history, for us to put 
our houses in order, to live the 
lives of Latter-day Saints, to trust 
in the true and the living God. 

I believe with all my heart that 
the destinies of men and nations are 
in the hands of the Lord, and I be- 
lieve that if the Latter-day Saints 
would overcome the weaknesses of 
their natures, and repent of their 
sins, draw near unto the Lord by 
prayers and supplications, and make 
their lives consistent with the same, 
thev would have greater power and 
influence to bring about the condi- 
tions that thev are desirous of 
bringing about. We would thus have 



130 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



power with the Lord. I believe it is 
within the province of the Lord to 
save every man and woman and 
child who will turn to him, serve 
him and keep his commandments. 

I pray the Lord to bless you 
with his Holy Spirit, to guide and 
direct you in your lives, that you may 
draw near unto him, that we all 
may repent of our sins, overcome 
the weaknesses of our flesh, and 
live lives consistent with the teach- 
ings that we have received as Lat- 
ter-day Saints, in the name of Jesus. 
Amen. 

Elder Joseph Kjar sang a solo: 
"Keep the home fires burning." 



ELDER EDWARD W. CROFT. 

(President of the Big Horn Stake of 
Zion." 1 

If there was ever a moment in my 
life, my brethren and sisters, when 
I deeply felt to appreciate the fact 
that I am a member of the Church, 
it is at this particular time. During 
this conference there has not been 
one moment that it has been my 
privilege to listen to the servants of 
God, that the prayer has not been 
in my heart, "Thank God for my 
humble standing in the Church." If 
there has been a minute during the 
conference, that I have not enjoyed 
so very much, it might be termed 
the one that I am living right now. 

I feel this afternoon that of all 
the history of the Church that 
should be inspiring to the Latter- 
day Saints, the hours spent in a 
general conference should be con- 
sidered the most important. I 
thought yesterday during the meet- 
ings, what a glorious interpretation 
we have of the mission of this coun- 
try ! I thought, too, yesterday af- 



ternoon, what could we ask, as cit- 
izens of this country, of our flag, 
that it has not given to us, and does 
not give to us every day? Along 
with that thought, there was a kin- 
dred thought that went through my 
mind, what is there in the experi- 
ence of mortal man, that he could 
ask for, pray for, possess, as a mor- 
tal being, that this great organiza- 
tion of ours does not give us ? 

I thought, too, what a glorious 
thing it is to be reared in this 
Church, what a glorious privilege it 
is to be born under the new and 
everlasting covenant, what a bless- 
ing it is to hold the priesthood, what 
a protection it is to. know where we 
came from, what we are doing here, 
and what our life's mission is, and 
what will be the ultimate result of 
our actions in this life, and to know 
where we are going! 

There is an old story that is told 
of a king who had certain individu- 
als to perform before him to make 
him laugh and be happy when he 
seemed to be downcast, otherwise 
than happy. A particular fool, for 
so they were called, had presented 
to him a token, I believe a cane; 
and the king told him whenever he 
found a bigger fool than he was,»to 
hand him the cane. The story tells 
us that after a number of years, this 
fool was called before the king, and 
the king was going to take his final 
journey, the journey that we all will 
take sooner or later; and the fool 
stood before the king and said, 
"Where are you going? Where do 
you expect to go, now that you are 
dying?" And the king said, "I do 
not know." And the fool said, 
"Take the cane." 

As I sat yesterday and heard the 
plea of the man who presides over 
our meeting today, to the young 
men of Israel, I thought of some of 



ELDER E. IV. CROFT 



131 



the experiences that I have encoun- 
tered as a practicing physician. I 
have watched all my life some of the 
things that my mother taught me as 
a boy, and I have found that she 
told me the truth about this great 
latter-day work, and about some 
other things about my nature that 1 
did not understand as a boy. She 
told me that the Lord had given me 
appetites and passions, that if prop- 
erly controlled and governed, they 
were to be a blessing to me all my 
life ; but, on the other hand, if I ever 
became the slave to any of them, 
that I would be in the most abject 
slavery. She talked about them as 
masters, who when once they have 
the fetters of slavery wrapped about 
a human being, have no mercy and 
are the downfall of thousands of 
boys and girls. Yesterday, while 
Brother McKay made that beautiful 
plea to the youth of Zion to con- 
serve their manhood, their minds, 
and their bodies for the great and 
glorious work of God in which we 
are engaged, I thought of the things 
that my mother told me;' and this 
afternoon, in the moment that is 
left me, I would like to say a word 
to our boys, the youth of Zion. 

I believe that I have had experi- 
ences that have taught me one thing 
that I want to give you here this af- 
ternoon. 

I heard a great man make this 
statement to a class of his students, 
"Boys, there are certain conditions 
in you as human beings, certain pas- 
sions, that unless taken care of, will 
become the master of you ; and 
there is one the gratification of 
which is stronger than the desire 
for self-preservation." I have 
watched in my experience as a phy- 
sician, and I know that man spoke 
the truth! and I testify to you, my 
young brethren and sisters, as a 



man of experience in this regard, 
that there is no protection you can 
give a young man that will equip 
him like the protection that this 
Church gives. 

Up in our stake the other night, 
we had the Attorney General of 
Wyoming, Mr. Preston, talk to us 
on the Liberty Loan. I know he 
will not care if I repeat his thought 
to you, because he spoke in all earn- 
estness, and he told me after the 
meeting that he spoke from the bot- 
tom of his heart. He said : "I have 
watched during this great war, es- 
pecially since Uncle Sam called his 
sons to the colors and we sent them 
across the seas to fight in this great 
ant glorious cause of ours, in the 
districts where your 'Mormon' peo- 
ple live, and I have discovered that 
in all the requirements in the matter 
of Thrift Stamps and War Savings 
Stamps and Liberty Bonds, and vol- 
unteering, and in the selective draft, 
that the Latter-day Saint people 
have gone over the top in a more 
glorious way than anything that I 
have ever seen in my life." 

"Now," I told him, "Mr. Preston, 
that is not surprising to me, and it 
would not be surprising to you if 
you knew the hearts of our people 
as I know them, and if you knew 
what we think of the flag and what 
we think of the Constitution, as I 
know." 

You will remember last April a 
prominent man stood in the Tab- 
ernacle here and spoke of the di- 
vinity of the Constitution of the 
United States. I heard him make 
a similar talk in the theatre in Chey- 
enne, and came to Salt Lake with 
him ; and I told him after he was 
through with his talk, in a conversa- 
tion with him, "Your talk certainlv 
found lodgment in my heart, for I 
have been taught as a boy to honor 



132 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



the Constitution of the United 
States as the greatest document 
that has guided any government in 
the history of the world, and, more 
than that, I have been taught to be- 
lieve that it was divinely given to 
the world." 

My brethren and sisters, it is no 
wonder that Latter-day Saints ap- 
preciate the position our country is 
in, and appreciate the opportunity 
that comes to them to aid our Gov- 
ernment, for we know what it is, 
and we know that while there are 
mistakes on the part of men who 
administer the laws, we know as 
God knows, and he gave us this 
Constitution, that it is divine, and 
we know that when we turned our 
eyes toward poor stricken Europe, 
we were doing God's service. We 
saw early in the war, those of us 
who stopped to think, only one 
thing, and that was the adversary 
endeavoring once more to throttle 
the liberty that God gave us when 
"the stars of morning sang to- 
gether, and all the sons . of God 
shouted for joy." We knew that 
there never was, and perhaps can 
never be a man, closer to the being 
who proposed to make you and 
me go back whether we wanted to 
or not, and be saved. There never 
has been a mortal, as far as my 
judgment can go, that has been as 
close to that individual as the pres- 
ent ruler of Germany. 

As I look at this war, I can see 
so many good things that will come. 
I can see, too, that the Lord is with 
his people. Out there in my little 
home town at Cowley, we have 
not a boy left. Practically all 
of them volunteered, there have 
been very few of them drafted ; 
and I know what is in their hearts. 
I know that they have not gone 
over there with any intention of 



slaughtering their fellow men un- 
necessarily ; I know, too, that they 
have not gone over there with the 
purpose in their hearts of changing 
the boundaries of countries ; but 
their mission, as they know it, and 
we know it, is to change the hearts 
of men ; and when they see that we 
have done that, they will be willing 
to say Amen to their work across 
the water, and will come back here 
and again be sifted into the Church 
and into our country. They will 
have learned some of the lessons of 
life that you and I could not teach 
them, and their fathers and moth- 
ers could not teach them. They will 
have learned things that will make 
them some of the best boys and 
some of the best men that we will 
ever have in our country. 

Now, my brothers and sisters, I 
am thankful above all things, this 
afternoon, that I can sit in that 
grand old building [the Taber- 
nacle], in this one, or any other 
place, and have go into my heart 
the words of the servants of God. 
I am not so particular about how 
it is said, or who says it : the thing 
that I am particular about is that 
my own heart be a receptacle for 
the word of God and a place 
in which the teachings of this 
Church can find lodgment, for I tes- 
tify to you in words of soberness, 
that you cannot find anything like 
it outside of this Church, you can- 
not find anything that can direct 
you as can this Church and the ser- 
vants of God whom he has chosen. 

So I am thankful, today, above 
all other things, that my father and 
my mother, in the little old isle of 
England, saw and heard a "Mor- 
mon" elder, and came to this coun- 
try, and that I have had the priv- 
ilege of over thirty years of work in 
the Church ; and I say to you that 



ELDER E. IV. CROFT 



133 



while I love my profession, and 
while I love to work in the town, 
in the city, in the state, or in the 
nation, or anywhere else that I can 
do anything for humanity — it is the 
work in this Church that brings 
joy to my soul and satisfaction to 
life. 

I know, too, that there has, never 
been a thing taugjht tme \hat J 
have had to be retaught, or had to 
relearn ; and I cannot say that for 
anything else that I have ever stud- 
ied. I have dug and plugged along 
in school, and gotten things from 
what I supposed to be science, and 
I have had to absolutely remodel 
my learning, and adjust it to the 
development of that particular sci- 
ence. But, with the work of God, 
the science of theology, as directed 
by our Lord and Master Jesus 
Christ, ever since that memorable 
day when he shone the light of 
truth and knowledge of a living 
God into the hearfof Joseph Smith, 
those things have not been in doubt ; 
and from that clay to the present, 
we Latter-day Saints have not had 
to relearn anything that the Church 
has ever given us ; but we can sit 
down with it and study it and meas- 
ure it by any measurement that man 
might hand us to use, and it never 
fails to follow along with any true 
science or any truth that has ever 
been given to the world. 

May God grant that we may- have 
his Spirit always with us, for I as- 
sure you and testify to you, that I 
know that there is no other guide to 
our feet, there is no other lamp to 
our faith, there is no security but 
direction by the Spirit of God ; and 
you brethren of the priesthood, let 
me ask you this question as the last 
word, "Is there anything that you 
will take from this world — or you 
mothers, heirs to the priesthood 



with your husbands, is there any- 
thing you will take out of mortality 
— that you do not get through the 
priesthood that our brethren hold? 
If there is, name it. No, your 
hearts tell you that there are only a 
few things that you will ever get 
away from this world with, and 
those few things are the precious 
gifts of God to us and our children, 
who could not be bound to us for 
all time and all eternity but through 
the channels of the holy Melchize- 
dek priesthood. May God grant 
that we may magnify it as brethren 
in the priesthood, is my prayer in 
the name of Jesus. Amen. 

E LDER BENJAMIN GODDARD. 

(Of the. Bureau of Information, Salt 
Lake City.) 

I am very glad to be here for the 
second time today, worshiping the 
Lord in such an assembly. I have 
enjoyed listening to the testimonies 
of my brethren. I appreciate, as do 
they, my membership in this 
Church. In connection with my 
work upon this block, which is go- 
ing on day after clay, year after 
year, I meet people from all coun- 
tries, of all faiths and creeds ; and 
every time I talk with regard to 
our work and the organization of 
the Church, my heart swells within 
me, for I am more proud of it than 
ever. 

A gentleman came here some 
time ago, the editor of the Baltimore 
Southern Methodist, administer of 
prominence. He spent a little time 
here, and went around with one of 
our business men who acted as a 
guide, and then he asked if he 
could not see the gentleman who 
had charge of the work, and came 



134 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



into my office. He was astonished at 
the work that we were doing. He 
was perfectly amazed at the infor- 
mation that had been given him 
with regard to the organization of 
our Church. He admired every 
phase of our work, and then he 
went home again, and in his own 
paper, wrote a very long article 
with regard to his visit here and 
the vitality of the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints. 
Amongst other things, he said, "I 
was informed by a business man 
that he had leisure from time to 
time, and rejoiced in coming and 
giving his time unto the work of 
informing the strangers of the faith 
of the Latter-day Saints. And then," 
he said, "I was told that when a 
crowd of tourists came there, if 
none of these guides were present, 
the gentleman in charge could call 
upon the 'phone for a prominent 
business man, a prominent banker, 
or a lady of leisure, and they would 
respond readily, and go around with 
the tourists, describing to them the 
organization of the Church and 
the faith of the Latter-dav Saints." 
And then he remarked, "I wonder 
how many Methodist business men 
there are in the city of Baltimore 
who would respond to my call, or 
who could give an intelligent ex-' 
position of their faith or the organ- 
ization of my Church, if they should 
be called." 

Amongst all these churches and 
their membership, there is not the 
live spirit of testimony that there 
is among the Latter-day Saints. I 
rejoice in this work. I rejoice that 
I am a member of this Church, that 
it is a living Church, that there is 
power in it. It is so organized that 
we can take hold of any movement 
and push it through to success ; and 
hence the report that our brother 



brings us from the Big Horn stake, 
in Wyoming. 

In corroboration, in order that 
you young men many really feel as 
I feel with regard to the Church, 
I thought of a little paragraph that 
was published a short time ago. In 
July, 1917, a prominent Utahn, who 
had been appointed by the Govern- 
ment, for certain service in our 
State, made this statemnt in com- 
pliment to the people of Utah : 

/ 

"For me to undertake the reorgan- 
ization of conservation forces in the 
State at this time would be like try- 
ing to 'paint the lily.' The forces now 
organized are doubtless working more 
effectively than similar committees 
will be able to work in any State of 
the Union; and while not a 'Mormon' 
myself, I cannot refrain from paying 
the 'Mormon' Church and the 'Mor- 
mon' people the compliment that they 
are now, through the professional and 
practical and energetic local defense 
committees, providing the government 
with a model of .efficiency in organiza- 
tion for food conservation; and I only 
wish every state in the Union had the 
nucleus of such an organization in 
entering into this most important 
work." 

I am proud of the organization 
of our Church, and the way that we 
can handle matters for the benefit 
of our children, for the benefit of 
the United States. But I come back 
again to this thought; What is the 
Church? Not that monument of 
stone over there, not that oval shap- 
ed dome, the Tabernacle, not the 
Assembly Hall, not your chapels 
nor your churches that are built of 
stone and brick in various parts of 
the state, or wherever the Church 
exists. The Church is the member- 
ship thereof, you who are present, 
and all the rest of the live members 
of it ; and the Church has vitality 
because we, the members of it, are 



ELDER BENJAMIN GODDARD 



135 



willing to consecrate ourselves to 
its service, we are willing- to re- 
spond to every call that is made up- 
on us. If the Church calls for a 
tenth of our income, we are will- 
' ing to give it, and witness our de- 
votion by our giving. 

A minister came to me a short 
time ago. He was going to the 
Northwest. He had been appointed 
by one of the churches to investigate 
the tithing system of the "Mormon" 
Church. He came here to find out 
something about it. We showed 
him our system at the Presiding 
Bishop's office, and explained to him 
how it worked, how these bishops 
gave their time to the work, how 
many of the brethren were laboring 
in various capacities to perform 
their labors unselfishly and freely, 
and how liberally our members re- 
spond to that law of God in the 
payment of their tithing. After he 
had visited the Presiding Bishop's 
office, and we had discussed this 
tithing question at some length, he 
asked the very pertinent question, 
"How do you think that would 
work in our church? You know 
what I am here for. I am trying 
to find out just how you work this 
tithing question, and if possible, 
arrange so that it can be adapted 
to Methodism." 

"Well," I said, "frankly, do you 
want me to tell you just how I feel 
about it?" 

"O yes," was the reply, "tell me 
just how you feel." 

"I think it would be an utter fail- 
ure. You cannot introduce it in 
vour church and make a success of 
it. Why? In the first place, your 
membersip does not recognize it as 
a law of God given to them .directly 
by revelation in this day- In the 
second place, they may not trust 
their leaders. They do not know 



how the money will be spent. They 
do not know but that numerous sal- 
aries will be paid to the very persons 
who are to administer the funds. 
The difference between your organ- 
ization and ours stamps our organ- 
ization as divine. Our membership 
know that the tithing which they 
pay unto the Lord comes back again 
to them; and with that tithing we 
go into southern Utah or elsewhere, 
and if a dam is washed out, and the 
people might starve without relief, 
we build their dam with the tithing. 
If our people need educational help, 
we establish our Church schools 
amongst them from our tithing 
fund. If we have widows and or- 
phans that have to be maintained, 
or if we have distress of any nature, 
from our tithing funds we minister 
especially at such times to the 
people ; and our membership recog- 
nize that the Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints is a grand fra- 
ternal organization for their benefit, 
for their relief — we need no others 
— and they have confidence in 
these bishops and in these presidents 
of stakes who are giving their time, 
who are giving their energies, who 
are laboring continuously for the 
p"ood of their people ; and not work- 
ing for salaries, and they are not 
getting them. There is this differ- 
ence between our Church and 
others. I do not believe it would 
work." 

With the Latter-day Saints, how- 
ever, it is different, our membership 
recognizes tithing as a divine insti- 
tution. 

Permit me to .draw attention to 
a particular passage of Scripture 
that has always impressed me. as I 
have no doubt it does you. Com- 
menting upon our Church again, 
the Apostle Peter, speaking with re- 
gard tn the membership, says, "Ye 



136 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



also, as lively stones, are built up 
a spiritual house, a holy priesthood, 
to offer up spiritual sacrifices, ac- 
ceptable to God by Jesus Chrisc." 
Who are we, therefore ? We are the 
living- stones in this great edifice, in 
this Church of God. It is built up 
of us. 

Now, what else is there to it? In 
the second chapter of Ephesians, 
the Apostle Peter says, "Ye are no 
more strangers and foreigners, but 
fellow citizens with the saints, and 
of the household of God, and are 
built upon the foundation of the 
apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ 
himself being the chief corner- 
stone." This is the living Church 
Christ the foundation, Christ the 
revelator, Christ who gave unto the 
Prophet Joseph Smith the keys, who 
spake to him personally, with re- 
gard to the organization of this 
Church. 

And in this Church, what have we 
Latter-day Saints ? An organization 
which we should be proud of. At 
the head, prophets and apostles 
whom we can sustain with all our 
souls, because we know that they 
are laboring with an eye single to 
the glory of God, and for the bene- 
fit of his people. O, we may think 
sometimes, these apostles have a 
grand time, they are traveling all 
the time, they are eating the best, 
etc. I admit that they are most hos- 
pitably entertained. You are glad 
to receive them. But my soul goes 
out in sympathy to these apostles of 
God. They have consecrated them- 
selves to God's service ; and from 
being accustomed to having the best 
their good wives could prepare for 
them, accustomed to good beds, 
accustomed to the comforts of 
home, they now go out visiting all 
the stakes of Zion, under various 
conditions and enduring many dis- 



comforts, accepting whatever is pro- 
vided for them and thanking the 
Lord for it; or traveling 40 or 50 
miles over rough roads, until they 
are almost shaken to pieces ; and 
they come back home and in a day 
or two, off again. A wife of one 
of them told me one day that she 
hardly knew whether she had a hus- 
band or not, we call for so much of 
their time. But they are willing to 
give it. We love them because of 
their fidelity, because of their de- 
votion, and it is their labors that 
make us strong. 

Prophets and apostles, pastors 
teachers, deacons, presidents of 
stakes, bishops ; and in the various 
organizations, we have everything 
that could minister unto our wants 
— our Relief Society caring for the 
sick, and the dying, and burying the 
dead ; our young men's organiza- 
tions, seeking to save the boys and 
train them in chastity ; our young 
women's organization, teaching 
virtue and purity unto the girls, and 
striving to lead them in the path of 
righteousness : our Sunday Schools, 
our Religion Classes, our Primary, 
ex>cd, "helps in government." I 
thank God that we have such a 
Church, and that it ministers unto 
us so many good things. God bless 
the man that stands at the head. If 
there ever was a time when Israel 
shouH bow in praver and plead with 
God, it is now, for never could you 
find a man Avho would be more de- 
voted, who would set a better ex- 
ample, who would live a cleaner 
life, who would ''o all that God 
would have him ' 1 o, to the laving 
down of his l : fe. than President 
Toseoh F. Smith. We need him. In 
my heart I praise God that he has 
b^en able to be with us at this con- 
ference, that we have heard his 
voice. May God bless and strength- 



ELDER DAVID 0. McKAY 



137 



en him is the prayer of all Israel. 

And now, my brethren and sis- 
ters, my heart is full .of thanksgiv- 
ing for the blessings that have come 
to me and to mine in this Church. 
My hope and prayer is that I may 
so live that I may receive the bless- 
ings promised the faithful, and that 
I may have every member of my 
family forever with me. 

May God strengthen and sustain 
us, and lead us to the accomplish- 
ment of good, I ask in the name of 
Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The General Authorities, as pre- 
sented in the Tabernacle, were then 
presented by Brother Goddar.d, ami 
sustained unanimously. 

ELDER DAVID 0. McKAY. 

(Of the Council of Twelve Apostles.) 

Ideals and character-building — A Col- 
lege illustration — Breaking ideals is 
breaking character — An illustration 
of a mother and her son who went 
to war — Make Prohibition safe, by 
voting in November to adopt the 
Prohibition amendment to the Utah 
state Constitution. 

At the conclusion of this pleas- 
ing, and most profitable session, 
which is one of ten general ses- 
sions held during this conference, 
I desire to say just this; that not 
one of us can go back to our homes 
with the same responsibility which 
we had when we left. Our pres- 
ence, our impression-s, our accept- 
ance of the principles which have 
been enunciated throughout these 
various sessions, have placed great- 
er obligations on us than we have 
ever had before. 'To him who 
knoweth to do good and doeth it 
not, to him it is sin." I never heard 
one of our brethren bear testimony 
to the divinity of this work, with- 



out feeling that the strength and 
growth of his character depends up- 
on a consistent life with that testi- 
mony ; and it makes character to 
live in harmony with man's ideals, 
or at least to strive to live in har- 
mony with them. 

I can illustrate what I mean by 
relating an incident of what hap- 
pened to two of our boys at col- 
lege. They had been taught as you 
boys and I have been taught, that 
next to bur lives, we should cher- 
ish the chastity referred to by Dr. 
Croft. 

One of these boys noticed that 
there was a laxity among his class- 
mates, in regard to that cleanliness 
in association with other boys and 
girls ; and after a few months at 
college, he partook of a different 
spirit from the one he had in his 
home, and one night, he said to his 
companion, who was older than he, 
"I am going out tonight with those 
fellows." 

"Well, you better not," said his 
companion. 

"Oh," he said, "I do not know! 
Those fellows have a good time, 
take their wine, have their cigar- 
ettes and their cigars, they enjoy 
themselves ; and here we are re- 
strained. They get their lessons, 
they are doing just as well in col- 
lege as we are, and I am going out 
with them. I am not so sure that 
our ideals are necessary, anyhow." 

The older one walked up, put his 
hand on his companion's shoulder, 
and said, "Those boys may be get- 
ting along all right in school, they 
may do these things to which you 
refer with impunity, but you can't." 

"Why?" 

"Because you know better. And 
once you break through that ideal, 
vour character is broken." 

Tt was the best lesson he learn- 



138 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



in college, and I am very glad that 
he learned it and lived it. 

I have thought of the application 
of that principle to our boys who 
are at the front. These boys must be 
brave, they cannot shirk a duty, 
their blows must be mighty in de- 
fense of righteousness, their power 
of resistance must be great, or else 
they are going to weaken, weaken 
their characters, and come back 
men unfit to take their places in this 
great nation, to say nothing of this 
great Church. Why? Why, my 
brethren and sisters, because they 
know. They know what chastity 
means. They know what the right- 
eousness of the cause for which 
they are fighting is. And when their 
mothers kissed them good-bye, they 
went with a last impression that 
they must maintain that ideal of 
purity. You let a boy fall down, 
and he is miserable, because he has 
not lived up to what he knows to 
be right. 

I shall never forget the picture of 
an Arizona mother's parting with 
her son. It was about a year and a 
half ago, when we first entered the 
war. He was one of the first to go. 
The mother, with her heart almost 
breaking, went with him to the re- 
cruiting office, and in the presence 
of a United States officer, when 
she was taking her last good-bye, 
said, "John, I want you to come 
back to me just as clean and sweet 
as you are now, or do not come 
back at all." 

And the officer said, "Why, 
madam, you must not expect that 
of your boy." 

"I do expect it of him," she re- 
turned, "and every 'Mormon' 
mother expects it of her boy. I do 
expect it of you, John, and I know 
you will ;" and with that she gave 
him a caress and went back to her 



home, and he to fight for his coun- 
try. 

Don't yOu think that boy will 
strike for righteousness, for the 
ideals of home, and the ideals of his 
character? He knows what is 
right; and if he is going to be a 
man of strong character, he must 
maintain those ideals. 

And so to us, I would like to say 
at parting that the thoughts that 
have been awakened in our minds, 
the resolutions that have been made 
in our hearts, have placed upon us 
greater responsibility than we have 
ever had before. God help us to 
be true to them, and to radiate that 
strength of character, that faith and 
confidence in God and his eternal 
work that will encourage others to 
seek higher ideals, and arouse in 
others' hearts higher hopes and as- 
pirations. . 

Brothers and sisters, I have re- 
joiced in this gathering, in every 
gathering of the Latter-day Saints, 
because the power of salvation is 
here — salvation here and now — 
happiness, peace and prosperity 
here. 

I leave my blessing with you, 
with the Latter-day Saints in all 
Israel, in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 

.Brethren and sisters, on the next 
election day, the people of Utah are 
asked to vote on an amendment to 
the Constitution of the State of 
Utah. There- are several amend- 
ments. I am going to mention only 
one. It pertains to Prohibition in 
our State. As you know, we have 
Prohibition by legislative enact- 
ment, but it is not a part of the 
Constitution of the State, now if 
we can make it a part of the Con- 
stitution of the State, Prohibition 
is safe. Now, the suggestion is that 



ELDER DAVID 0. McKAY 



139 



the prohibition statute be made a 
rart of the Constitution of the 
State. I am sure there is not a 
member of the Church anywhere 
who does not approve of this, there 
is not a law-abiding citizen through- 
out the state who does not desire 
it. But here is the danger : we may 
not think of voting it ! I am simply 
mentioning it so that when you go 
to the polls you will look at that 
amendment and vote "Yes." 

We desire to thank the brethren 
of this male chorus for the excel- 
lent service rendered this afternoon, 
and the organist, and you, my breth- 
ren and sisters, who have rendered 
your assistance here by your atten- 
tion, and the spirit that has radi- 
ated from your good souls. We 
thank these brethren of the stake 
presidencies and appreciate the 
spirit they have manifested and the 
testimonies they have borne. 

The choir sang : "Set the lower 
lights along the shore."

CLOSING SESSION. 

In the Tabernacle, the conference 
was called to order at 2 o'clock p. 
m., by President Anthon H. Lund, 
President Joseph F. Smith, presid- 
ing. 

The choir and congregation sang : 
"Redeemer of Israel." 

The choir sang the hymn : "Great 
God, attend while Zion sings." 

Prayer was offered by Elder Ed- 
ward H. Anderson. 

A trio, "God be merciful," was 
sung by Evan Arthur, Evangeline 
Thomas, and James H. Nielson. 



ELDER CHARLES H. HART. 

(Of the First Council of Seventy.) 

The singing of this conference 
has seemed to me to be particularly 
appropriate. I have seen new 
meaning in many of the old songs 
which have been sung. To begin 
with we sang : 

Hail to the brightness of Zion's glad 
morning, 

Joy to the lands that in darkness 

have lain! 
Hushed be the accents of sorrow and 

mourning, 
Zion in triumph begins her glad 

reign. 

i 

Hark! from all lands, from the isles 
of the ocean, 
Praise to Jehovah ascending on 
high; 

Fallen are engines of war and com- 
motion, 

Shouts of salvation are rending the 
sky. 

The next to the last line is pro- 
phetic for the future ; but it is cer- 
tainly appropriate for us to exclaim 
today, "Joy to the lands that in 
darkness have lain." 

We sang also the song composed 
by Brother Parley P. Pratt: 

"The morning breaks, the shadows 
flee; • 

Lo! Zion's standard is unfurled 
The dawning of a brighter day 
Majestic rises on the world. 

The clouds of error disappear 
Before the rays of truth divine; 

The glory, bursting from afar. 

Wide o'er the nations soon will 
shine." 

And others of the songs were 
particularly appropriate and strik- 
ing at this time. If we understand 
the word "Zion" in the larger mean- 
ing of referring to North and South 
America, the land of Joseph, ther 
there is an added meaning to these 



140 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



words which I have read. In order 
to understand what this glad news 
means to countries like Belgium 
and France and other nations that 
soon shall be liberated, we must 
visualize some of their sufferings. 
I think this people should be able 
to sympathize very fully with these 
oppressed peoples, because there 
have been some things in our his- 
tory which should help us to be very 
sympathetic. We, whose ancestors 
had the experiences of migrating 
from New York and Ohio to Mis- 
souri and from thence to Illinois, and 
who witnessed the slaying of the 
prophet and the patriarch while un- 
der official protection, and the wan- 
derings of the people from thence 
to the Rocky Mountains, and being- 
separated, husband from wife 
and child from parent, in connection 
with the call of the Mormon Battal- 
ion, we appreciate the joy and the 
peace that we have here in these 
mountain valleys, and yet we have 
learned so well the lesson taught in 
the parable of the Good Samaritan, 
that we know who our neighbor 
is ; and so with the sufferings of 
our brethren and sisters across the 
great waters, we are able to sym- 
pathize, and our contemplation of 
peace here is only of short duration, 
because our minds go to our suf- 
fering brethren and sisters abroad. 

What joy must come to the hearts 
of the Belgians today as they realize 
that their deliverance is not far off, 
those who suffered the pangs con- 
nected with the abuse of the doc- 
trine of hostages. Lieutenant Eber- 
lein confesses how he clubbed with 
the butt of the gun, hostages, in 
order to have them take perilous 
positions so that their own country- 
men in seeking to defend themselves 
would slay these hostages. That is 
almost like "seething the kid in its 



mother's milk," or like the incident 
of which Byron writes, of the eagle 
wounded with the arrow, and yet 
the keener pain was when he real- 
ized that it was a pinion of its own 
which had sped the shaft which 
then festered in its" vitals. 

Notwithstanding article 50 of the 
agreement at the second Hague con- 
vention, to which the German Em- 
pire was a party, there were many 
abuses of the doctrine of penalties. 
First, five hundred million francs 
were levied upon Belgium, that 
stripped nation, then the subject of 
charity froirf other lands ; then a 
monthly levy of at first forty mil- 
lion francs, then increased to fifty 
and afterwards to sixty million 
francs that those people, with much 
of their machinery shipped to Ger- 
many, their raw material either cut 
off or taken from them, besides the 
individual penalizing of various 
towns and cities. 

But one of the most deplorable 
incidents in the occupation by Ger- 
many of Belgium, was their system 
of deportations. Contrary to article 
52 of the same agreement which had 
been entered into, some of those de- 
ported were required, so Minister 
Gerard told us, to manufacture am- 
munition to be used against their 
countrymen. Ninety minutes not- 
ice was given to men and women to 
prepare for the deportation. Tens 
of thousands were deported for lab- 
or in Germany under that order. 
Many of the orders issued against 
the Belgians were expressly re- 
quired to be carried out without 
mercy. That was the expression 
frequently used in those messages, 
that they were to be carried out 
without mercy. 

One of the correspondents, Will 
Irwin, in the Saturday Evening Post 
of October 6, 1917, said : 



CHARLES H. HART. 



141 



Some ten or a dozen American cor- 
respondents, of whoim I was one, 
witnessed the first German drive 
through Belgium. Most of us were 
so appalled and horrified by what we 
saw as to become anti-German for 
life. 

Air. Whitlock, our Minister to 
Belgium, reporting" on the situation, 
said : 

They have dealt a mortal blow to 
any prospect they may ever have had 
of being tolerated by the population 
of Flanders; in tearing away from 
nearly every humble home in the land 
a husband, a father or a son and 
brother, they have lighted a fire of 
hatred that will never go out; they 
have brought home to ever}' heart in 
the land, in a way that will impress 
its horrors indelibly on the memory 
of three generations, a realization of 
what German methods mean, not as 
with the early atrocities in the heat 
of passion and the first lust of war, 
but by one of those deeds that make 
one despair of the future of the hu- 
man race, a deed coldly nlanned, 
studiously matured, and deliberately 
and systematically executed, a deed 
so cruel that German soldiers are said 
to have wept in its execution, and so 
monstrous that even German officers 
are now said to be ashamed. 

This is from an official report of 
our Minister to Belgium, a reliable 
and conservative man. 

Some of the Belgian petitions ani 
appeals read very much like some 
of the many petitions that were 
offered in behalf of the Latter-day 
Saints, while they were passing 
through some of the tribulations to 
which I have referred. Here is 
one : 

You are a father, you know that 
there is not in the order of humanity 
a right more honorable or more holy 
than that of the family, for .every 
Christi?n the inviolability of God, who 
created the family, attaches to it. The 
German o..cers who have been bil- 



leted for a long time in our homes 
know how deep in our hearts we of 
the North hold family affection, and 
that it is the sweetest thing in life to 
us. Thus to dismember the family by 
tearing youths and girls from their 
homes is not war; it is for us tortures 
and the worst of tortures — unlimited 
moral torture. The violation of family 
rights is doubled by a violation of the 
sacred demands of morality. Morality 
is exposed to perils, the mere idea of 
which is revolting to every honest 
man, from the promiscuity which in- 
evitably accompanies removals en 
masse, involving mixture of the sexes, 
or, at all events, of persons of very 
unequal moral standing. Young girls 
of irreproachable life, who have never 
committed any worse offense than that 
of trying to pick up some hread or a 
few potatoes to feed a numerous fam- 
ily, and who have besides paid the 
light penalty for such trespass, have 
been carried off. Their mothers, who 
have watched so closely over them 
and had no other joy than that of 
keeping their daughters beside them, 
in the absence of father and sons fight- 
ing or killed at the front — these 
mothers are now alone. 

And Mr. Herbert Hoover, giving 
an official report of the conditions 
existing in Belgium after the occu- 
pation by Germany, used very 
strong language : 

The sight of the destroyed homes 
and cities, the widow.ed and fatherless, 
the destitute, the physical misery of a 
people but partially nourished at best 
the deportation of men by tens of 
thousands to slavery in German mines 
and factories, the execution of men 
and women for paltry effusions of 
their loyalty to their country, the 
sacking of every resource through 
financial robbery, tihe battening of 
armies on the slender produce of the 
country, the denudation of the country 
of cattle, horses and textiles; all these 
things we had to witness, dumb to 
help other than by protest and svm- 
pathy, during this long and terrible 
time — and still these are not the 
events of battle heat, but the effects of 
a grinding heel of a race demanding 
the mastership of the world. 



142 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



All these things are well known to 
the world — but what can never be 
known is the dumb agony of the 
people, the expressionless faces of mil- 
lions whose souls have passed the 
whole gamut of emotions. And why? 
Because these, a free and democratic 
people, dared plunge their bodies be- 
fore the march ,of autocracy. 

And as we were eloquently told 
last night by the French officer, as 
to France fourteen hundred thous- 
and of their men have perished, a 
like number seriously wounded ; and 
our English officer told us of the 
great numbers that England has 
lost. So, if the day is approaching 
when darkness and error shall flee 
away, when the lands that in dark- 
ness have lain shall receive the light, 
will there not be great rejoicing? 
We rece'ved word last night that 
the fourteen terms proposed by 
President Wilson last January 8th, 
that this law which had gone forth 
from Zion might be accepted by the 
Central Powers, one of which pro- 
vides for the righting of the wrongs 
against Alsace and Lorraine. Think 
of the joy there to the lands which 
in darkness have lain to those people 
who are not permitted the privilege 
of their own language or to inscribe 
upon the tombstones the names and 
record of the departed in the native 
language of the people. 

We must not be too optimistic in 
reference to the prospect for im- 
mediate peace, because one of the 
great obstacles lies in the fact here- 
tofore suggested by American 
statesmen, of the want of capacity 
for convenanted peace. We must 
not grow too enthusiastic because 
we hear the shout "Kamerad" even 
by a nation, because, if we grant an 
armistice we may have the exper- 
ience that we had when we protested 
against the sinking of the Lusi- 
tania, and were given to under- 



stand that such warfare would 
cease, only to find that upon better 
preparation the work was renewed 
with greater energy ; and just as our 
New York boys learned last week, 
when the word "Kamerad" was 
sounded and heeded they discovered 
a little later it was only for an op- 
portunity of throwing hand gre- 
nades at them. So, there are some 
■difficulti es in the way yet of secur- 
ing- peace. I rejoice that we are not 
relaxing, that in the very face of 
the announcement that the Central 
Powers are willing to discuss the 
fourteen terms specified by our na- 
tion, that our Church made the pur- 
chase today of a quarter of a 
million dollars in defense of liberty 
and truth. 

Word has been given during this 
conference of the abuse of the free- 
dom of speech. Freedom of speech 
and of the press are glorious rights 
guaranteed by the Constitution, a 
protection against the repetition of 
those things that our ancestors in 
England had experienced when men 
were not free to write and speak 
as they cho.se ; but there are other 
rights that are guaranteed by the 
Constitution in addition to the right 
of speech. The freedom of the 
press is no higher or greater than 
the freedom of speech, and these 
guaranteed rights always had cer- 
tain limitations. Under the rights 
of free speech or of a free press one 
would not have the right to utter 
blasphemy; neither would he have 
the right to publish immorality, nor 
.sedition, as some have learned re- 
cently in this great Republic of ours 
under the prosecution of a Utah 
boy ; neither would it give the right 
to character assassination. While 
attention has been called to the fact 
that we have realized in a few in- 
stances that a spirit of lying is

143 



abroad and that some first class 
falsehoods have been put forward 
and industriously circulated, our 
Government has experienced the 
same thing" upon a larger scale. The 
French officer referred last night to 
some of those falsehoods uttered 
against his own country, that it was 
a decadent nation ; have you not 
heard that? And also that France 
had been bled white, — another false- 
hood. So our own country has list- 
ed some one hundred important 
falsehoods that have been circulated 
in this country ; and I think the les- 
son to us is not to repeat these idle 
tales because there is no more criti- 
cal period of this great world con- 
flict than we are passing through 
now. If we' make serious mistakes 
now in being too anxious for an 
early peace, it may result these mil- 
lions shall have died in vain, if we 
do not square a peace which shall 
usher in the Millennium or tend 
very stronsdy in that direction. So 
the duty of citizenship, as I view it, 
is to be careful how we pass along 
any of these falsehoods, e : ther 
against the Church or against the 
state, and it is no excuse or justi- 
fication to the person repeating a 
slander, that he has heard it from 
someone else ; that is no justifica- 
tion, so we mav well stop and in- 
quire when anv strange tale comes 
to us. whether it is true or not. The 
matiirv. "Where d'd vou eet vour 
facts." would be pertinent both as 
to these Church rumors ana as to 
these rumors pertaining to the situ* . 
Tt is a time for care. The Deseret 
News, in its excellent editorial col- 
umn the other night, called attention 
to the fact that when that maernin- 
rent parade was passing,', and the 
fla? was being carried ; n a formal 
manner, that some citizens were 
either too careless or too ignorant 



to salute the flag as it passed by; 
and it occurs to me in connection 
with this epidemic that is abroad, 
that care must be used, care by those 
who are taken with it, that they may 
not expose others. I have seen 
people sneezing and coughing in 
public assemblages and in the street 
cars, without the use of a handker- 
chiefs and, if affected with infec- 
tious disease, endangering those in 
near radius. 

I have already taken more time, 
perhaps, than I should. May the 
Lord bless us, help us to be true 
and faithful and loyal citizens to 
our country and to our Church, I 
pray in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER LEVI EDGAR YOUNG. 
(Of the First Council of Seventy.) 

While Elder Hart was speaking 
about the great world's war, I was 
thinking of the heroism of our .sol- 
diers, as well as the terrible suffer- 
ings of the people of Europe. To- 
day, I feel more than ever the need 
of bowing our heads in the pres- 
ence of a loving God, who is di- 
recting the world to a better life. 
This wild and distracted world is 
still his. The war will end in vic- 
tory — a victory that will go down 
the ages. This consummation of 
human happiness shall be given us 
because we have desired to do our 
best, and to be our best. We are 
standing in the service of our King 
and Master, and we are obtaining 
new visions of a higher and newer 
life for ourselves and humanity. 
God grant that the day of peace 
may come, and the world may be 
governed by the Prince of Peace. 

And yet, I believe that after this 
great conflict of arms is over with, 
that a greater conflict is going to 



144 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



take place in the world, a conflict 
that you and I must prepare for 
with all our might and strength. It 
will be the conflict between intelli- 
ence and ignorance, between mor- 
ality and immorality, between the 
Spirit of God and the spirit of dark- 
ness. In the wake of all wars 
come ignorance and immorality . In 
fact, the history of the world 
proves that after great struggles of 
might, men are in darknkess, for 
war precipitates the greater evils in 
human society on one hand as well 
as the better spiritual attitude to- 
ward life on the other. 

The question with you and me is : 
which will prevail? The Latter- 
day Saints have a message to the 
world that the spiritual life must 
prevail ; that the gospel of Jesus 
Christ must triumph. It will be 
through our lives, our words, and 
our actions, that the influence of the 
gospel of Jesus Christ will be felt in 
the world. I believe firmly what 
has been suggested in this confer- 
ence, that one reason for this war 
is the false philosophies that have 
been rampant in the hearts of stu- 
dents of the European countries 
and ofthe world. The great mes- 
sage that you and I must bear must 
be prefaced with the divine thought 
that God made man in his own 
image, in the image of God made 
he him. This is a divine truth. Its 
divinity stamps divinity upon us. 
We are divine. The children of 
God in deed and in truth. We have 
not evolved from something lower. 
The vision of Moses as found in 
the Pearl of Great Price tells us 
this. I wish the message could be 
carried to the world, for we are 
distinctly told that man is in the 
image of God materially and spirit- 
ually. This great fundamental 



truth is what the world needs to- 
day. We are in the image of God, 
with a great spiritual outlook on 
life. What the world needs is 
idealism, religion, and faith in God, 
which humanity has long since lost. 
We need idealizing. Yet this con- 
gregation and conference, our acts 
and our words, certainly stamp the 
Latter-day Saints as a people with 
ideals. The gospel of Jesus Christ 
is idealistic. As a people we idealize 
the earth, we idealize man, we ideal- 
ize everything pertaining to right- 
eousness and truth, and we are con- 
vinced that the truth will pervail 
in all the world. This war now 
raging in Europe was not of God ; 
but it has been permitted ; it has 
come as a. result of the ignorance 
of humanity. God is a God of love 
for his children, and though this 
war is permitted, there will come 
out of it the great conflict of light 
against darkness. But light and 
truth will prevail. The gospel of 
Jesus Christ is the message to the 
world that God lives, that Jesus is 
the Christ and the Redeemer of the 
world, and that Joseph Smith is a 
prophet of the living God in whom 
we have great faith. 

The question was asked me re- 
cently, "If God is a God of love, 
what will be the compensation for 
this war?" We can all judge what 
the ultimate outcome of it is to be. 
No one can tell when the compensa- 
tion will come to us. But compensa- 
tion will come, for the world is go- 
ing to be made better, and prepared 
for the gospel of Christ. 

In 1777, the first Continental 
Congress sent Benjamin Franklin 
to the court of. France to ask for 
succor for the American cause. The 
Council of State voted to help Amer- 
ica, and one young officer, Lafa- 



ELDER LEVI EDGAR YOUNG. 



145 



yette, asked permission to lead four 
or five thousand men to America. 
It was permitted, and a few weeks 
after, Lafayette, with his men, came 
into Philadelphia ; they had been 
nine weeks on the sea. Lafayette 
was taken to the camp of 
Washington and was put on 
the staff .of the commander- 
in-chief. He immediately went to 
work to train the American forces. 
After a long struggle, until 1781, 
the American colonies won their in- 
dependence. 

They had fought for great ideals, 
and when independence was gained 
Lafayette bade farewell to General 
Washington on the banks of the 
Potomac, General Washington, 
grasping the hand of that young 
French officer, said in French, "God 
grant that your people may never 
need America's help, but always 
know that America will love your 
country." When those French sol- 
diers left France, many a mother 
wondered when the compensation 
would come back, when their 
boys' work would be rewarded. 
Many French soldiers fell fighting 
for America's cause. 

Lafayette went back and report- 
ed to his government that many of 
his men had fallen for the cause of 
truth and liberty in America. The 
government passed a resolution of 
thanks, and one old man, a Catholic 
Father, prayed to God that France 
might receive a just compensation 
for her sacrifice. 

The compensation did not imme- 
diately come to the French people. 
Nearly a hundred and fifty years 
afterwards, on the sixth day of 
September, 1917, General Pershing 
of the American army had been pro- 
grammed to give an address before 
the tomb of Lafayette. He went 
down to the tomb with his staff of- 



ficers. General Pershing stepped 
before the tomb of Lafayette, and 
in French said, "Lafayette, we are 
here !" That is all that he said, but 
it is a speech that has gone into the 
'hearts of humanity, and the com- 
pensation for what France did over 
a hundred years ago has gone back- 
to France. 

My brethren and sisters, the 
world is in need of the gospel of 
Jesus Christ. Liberty, democracy, 
truth, light, intelligence, morality, is 
what we are fighting for. The 
American troops will never listen to 
peace, nor will Britain, or France, 
or Servia, or Belgium, until a new 
life, a new liberty, and a new dem- 
ocracy, strike deep into the hearts 
of the Germanic people of Europe. 
■,~Xhere will be no peace, it is our 
-.g^aith, until the world is partly 
slighted, and made safe for democ- 
racy, that the gospel of Jesus Christ 
may become supreme in the hearts 
of men. 

God made man in his own image, 
in the image of God made he him, 
'is our message to the world. Amen. 

Prof. J. J. McClellan rendered 
a voluntary on the great organ, 
finishing with the melody of, "O 
my Father." 

ELDER WALTER P. MONSON. 

(President of the Eastern States 
Mission.) 

This is an inspiring sight, my 
brethren and sisters, to see so many 
Latter-day Saints gathered together 
in one place. In the Eastern States 
mission we have no such congrega- 
tions, but ours is composed of 
twenty or thirty, sometimes one 
hundred, where -we, in our weak 
way, and by the assistance of our 
heavenly Father, are attempting to 



146 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



proclaim to them the principles of 
life eternal. 

I have been greatly interested 
and edified in the remarks that 
have been made by the speakers at 
this conference. I am sure that 
they have been inspired by the 
Spirit of our heavenly Father ; and 
it is the inspiration of that Spirit 
that I desire to enjoy for the few 
moments that I shall stand before 
you. 

Brother Levi Edgar Young said, 
"the thing that the world needs 
most is a knowledge of the true and 
the living God." Is it not a singular 
thing, but a thing that should give 
great joy and satisfaction to every 
Latter-day Saint's heart, to know 
that the prayer of faith was re- 
warded by the revelation of God 
himself and his Son Jesus Christ, 
nearly one hundred years ago, when 
Joseph Smith, the boy, went into 
the woods near Palmyra, New 
York, supplicated God in fervent 
prayer to know which of all the 
sects and denominations then exist- 
ing in the world was right? When 
the Father and the Son appeared 
to him, the Savior, who had been 
introduced with the words, "This is 
my beloved Son ; hear him," said 
that Joseph should join himself to 
none of the then existing organiza- 
tions upon the earth, "for," said the 
Savior, "they have a form of god- 
liness, but they derty the power 
thereof. They preach for hire, 
they divine for money, they draw 
near unto me with their lips and 
honor me with their mouths, but 
have removed their hearts far from 
me ; they teach for doctrine the 
commandments of men." 

Despite the fact that one hun- 
dred years have .passed, there has 
been no consistent attempt on the 
part of the representatives of the 



existing churches or organizations 
of that time to prove that they were 
not teaching for hire, that they were 
not divining for money, that they 
were not drawing near unto him 
with their lips and honoring him 
with their mouths, and that their 
hearts were not removed far from 
him ; but rather, they have made 
vicious attacks upon the one who 
gave the message of Jesus Christ 
to the world. Are we to apologize 
for what the Savior said, in the 
face of the present condition of the 
world ? No ; a thousand times no. 
Let it be heralded to the world. 
God has revealed himself and his 
plan of life and salvation to the 
children of men, and it is our priv- 
ilege, aye, it is our duty, to proclaim 
that message to the world. 

Among other attempts that have 
been made to discredit those who 
have been instrumental in the fur- 
thering of the purposes of the 
Lord, a recent attempt was made 
in one of the army camps, as pub- 
lished in the Boston Transcript. I 
desire to read to you from the Bos- 
ton Transcript, of July 13, 1918: 

"While Father McQuaide, a popular 
chaplain of a well-known San Fran- 
cisco regiment, was waiting a few days 
at Camp Mills, L. L, before embarking 
for France, many men from other 
regiments who were without Catholic 
chaplains, learning of his presence, 
visited him, almost invariably for con- 
fession. One day, after hearing many, 
Father McQuaide was conscious of 
the presence of another waiting sol- 
dier, and in his characteristic way he 
said: 'Now, kneel right here and bless 
yourself, my boy.' The soldier looked 
up meekly and said: 'I don't know 
how. I am an elder in the 'Mormon' 
Church.' " 

This is intended for a slur upon 
the Latter-day Saints, but oh, how 
they have misunderstood the mes- 



ELDER WALTER P. MONSON 



147 



sage of Christ to the world. When 
the devil appeared to the Savior in 
his emaciated, hungry condition, he 
said : "If you are the Son of God, 
turn these stones into bread," or, in 
other words, "Bless your hungry 
self." Did he do so? No; he did 
not do it. He did not bless himself 
on that occasion; but out on the 
shores of the Sea of Galilee, where 
there were four thousand who were 
hungered, he took the loaves and 
small fishes, and blessed them and 
gave them to the multitude, thus 
extending the blessing of his au- 
thority to others. And in- his dy- 
ing moments upon the cross, while 
they wagged their heads and mock- 
ingly said : "If you are the Son of 
God, come down and save your- 
self," did he bless himself by sav- 
ing his life? No. He went to a 
martyr's death, crucified. What 
for? That you and I might live. 
And yet they make ridicule and 
light of the fact that the Latter-day 
Saints do not know how to bless 
themselves. Why, bless your souls, 
the priesthood that has been given 
to the elders in this Church is not 
intended for blessing oneself, but 
for blessing others. How true this 
is, and in harmony with the state- 
ment of St. James, when he said : 
"Is any sick among you? Let him 
call for the elders of the Church ; 
and let them pray over him, anoint- 
ing him with oil in the name , of 
the Lord ; and the prayer of faith 
shall save the sick, and the Lord 
shall raise him up." He did not 
say, "Anoint yourself and bless 
yourself," but let the priesthood of 
others be operative in behalf of the 
afflicted. 

Now, I want to bear to you my 
testimony, my brothers and sisters, 
that I do know that this is the 
true work of God, and that if we 



will persist unto the end to pro- 
claim this gospel to the world in 
holiness of life and purpose, that 
we shall be preserved from the 
pitfalls of the evil one, for he has 
preserved us amid the trials and 
persecutions that have been heaped 
upon this people from the earliest 
organization of the Church to the 
present time. We praise God that 
we live in this land of liberty, where 
we can worship God according to 
the dictates of our own conscience, 
and the opposition, for the most 
part, is from organizations that 
have found their origin under mo- 
narchial forms of civil government. 

God bless us all, that we might 
keep our covenants true and sa- 
cred, and ever be found with the 
faithful, I pray in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 

ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD. 

(President of the Northwestern States 
Mission.) 

While President Grant was read- 
ing the 121st section of the book 
of Doctrine and Covenants, the 
other day, which contains the in- 
structions from the Lord concern- 
ing the spirit that should actuate the 
priesthood of this Church, my mind 
went out to some of the statements 
which have been made by the en- 
emies of this Church. One that im- 
pressed itself upon me was the ut- 
terance of a noted divine in the 
city of Portland, a few years ago, 
wherein he charged that the "Mor- 
mon" Church was the most perfect 
organization in the world, the most 
powerful; but he feared it, because 
of its power. He was afraid that 
this power would be utilized for un- 
holy purposes. I recall at the 
same time that a noted official of 
the Government said that "the 



148 



GENERAL CONEERENCE. 



'Mormon' Church and the German 
army are the most efficient organ- 
izations in the world ;"and he de- 
plored that, while we have efficiency 
in both these organizations, there 
was the surrender of individuality. 
He hoped that the day might come 
when we could have equal efficiency 
as shown in these two great insti- 
tutions in the earth, and yet have 
freedom and liberty. These two 
systems, that is, the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints and the 
German army, so far as the spirit 
that dominates and actuates them 
is concerned, are as far apart as 
the two poles can be. There are 
two methods by which efficiency 
may be obtained even in the home 
— one by the whip that brings im- 
mediate obedience from the child — 
you can get what you wish by fear, 
by punishment ; the other method is 
to obtain it through love. If you 
will observe the rule, however, to 
punish and obtain obedience 
through that means, you can do it 
until the child becomes of your'own 
age and size, and then your power 
is gone ; but if you control by love, 
it will endure forever and ever, 
even into the eternal world. These 
two spirits respectively are charac- 
teristic of these two organizations 
— -the one that rules by fear and 
punishment illustrates the spirit 
that dominates and actuates and 
controls the German army, and ob- 
tains the efficiency of that people. 
I rejoice to be a witness to the 
nations of the earth that the spirit 
that domintaes and controls the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints is the spirit of love. 
Here is liberty; here is freedom. 
No man has coerced me nor has 
he coerced you, and yet we have 
been united ; we have thought alike 
we have believed alike ; we have 



had one common teacher ; it has not 
been the whip, nor the lash, nor 
the threat, but it has been the wit- 
ness and the testimony of the Holy 
Ghost that has born to us all the 
same witness concerning the teach- 
ings of the leaders of this Church ; 
and how, in my heart, I rejoice that 
1 have always found it possible 
to yield, and gladly and willingly 
have I yielded, to the instructions 
and endorsed the counsel and ad- 
vice, which have been given, and 
have always felt a perfectly free 
man. 

These two systems were in op- 
eration in the very beginning ; on 
the one hand was he, who offered 
himself to redeem the world ; but, 
said he, "I will save all men." By 
what means ? Taking away their 
individual liberty. The right to 
think, the right to act ; but said he, 
"I want the glory." It was a new 
scheme, and if it succeeded it was 
his, and he wanted the glory. On 
the other hand was the Christ, giv- 
ing unto all men their free agency, 
holding them, nevertheless, ac- 
countable, but extending unto them 
the right of choice and the reward 
that should follow ; and the honor 
and the glory were the Father's. 
There was war over that questiori 
when the Father's decision was ap- 
pealed from, and the majority of 
the great body who were present 
voted against him who sought to 
take away the agency of man ; there 
was war in heaven, actual combat. 
The forces of evil were cast down 
to Jhe earth, and here they have 
been and here the war wages and 
never have these combats ceased. 
When these two great characters 
in the drama of the world met in 
the hour of temptation, the great 
thing for which both were seeking 
— the right to preside over the 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD. 



149 



Kingdoms of this world, was dis- 
cussed ; in panoramic view .they 
passed before the mind of Jesus. 
Satan said, "Aren't they splendid? 
Wouldn't you like them?" In his 
heart he knew that it was what 
Jesus came to obtain — the right to 
rule over them, to die for them and 
to save them, and in his own heart 
he was saying: "You don't have to 
die for them if you will only do 
what I tell you now ; you can have 
them on easy terms ; you just fall 
down and worship me ; behold they 
are mine and I will give them to 
you." Jesus knew who it was, how- 
ever, and he said : 'Get thee behind 
me, Satan.' Jesus in his own heart 
no doubt realized that Satan's was 
only a squatter's claim upon the 
earth. It is true he had been ruling 
from the rivers to the ends of the 
earth, but his claim was no good ; 
it was not valid at all ; and if Jesus 
should bow down and worship him. 
Jesus would have a title that was 
worthless and at the same time 
lose his opportunity to redeem the 
world in the way God had decreed. 
So he died to win the right to rule 
and he is the only one who ever 
shall rule by "right Divine." Those 
powers are still in the world ; they 
are arrayed against each other to- 
day. When shall the conflict end? 
There is no doubt in our minds 
what the result will be when that 
end shall come. Satan even steals 
the liveries of heaven to accomplish 
his purposes and he will give reve- 
lation — this is a wonderful 'time 
for revelation. He is giving reve- 
lations to some poor, deluded Lat- 
ter-day Saints. I think that the 
greatest prophet of Baal in Europe 
today is the German Kaiser ; I 
haven't any doubt but that he has 
received revelation. I haven't any 
doubts but that he feels in his own 



heart that he has been anointed as 
he said he was, and set apart by 
God to dominate and rule the earth. 

It is the power of the evil forces 
arrayed through a political form of 
government for the purpose of stay- 
ing the fulfilment of these ancient 
predictions referred to in this con- 
flict, when in the interpretation of 
Nebuchadnezzar's dream Danial 
said, that in the days of these king- 
doms, our days, the God of heaven 
should establish a Kingdom that 
should roll forth and fill the whole 
earth. 

My brethren and sisters, it warms 
my heart to be able to say and to 
feel that God is not only working in 
this Church, but outside of it, as 
indicated and as it has been re- 
ferred to by the brethren here, that 
the Lord established the Constitu- 
tion of the Linked States for the 
blessing of all flesh. In my soul I 
believe that that is part of the great 
Kingdom of God, the political part, 
for Jesus was to come as "King 
of kings and Lord of lords." In 
the capacity of King of kings he 
rules in a political way, and as Lord 
of lords in a spiritual way. He is 
the greatest statesman the world 
has ever seen, and that great 
kingdom, cut out of the mountain 
without hands, founded by God, 
has been rolling forth. Let me tell 
you, my weak-kneed brethren and 
sisters, if there are any of you 
here, take courage, for God's 
word shall not fail when he pre- 
dicted that the instrument known as 
the Constitution of the LTiited 
States, the Spirit of Liberty estab- 
lished here by a few weak colonists, 
was his order of things for the gov- 
ernment of men, and it should roll 
forth to fill the whole earth. There 
were great kingdoms, in the world 
that refused to believe it, but it has 



150 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



rolled forth until it now bids fair 
to reach every nation, kindred and 
tongue and people in the earth, and 
bring God's form of political gov- 
ernment for the delivery of the 
souls of men just as sure as that 
has been true, just so sure am I that 
this is God's spiritual part of the 
great kingdom that Daniel saw — 
the more sacred, the more holy part, 
the sanctifying thing that shall not 
only sanctify men, but shall sancti- 
fy nations, when at the peace 
table the sword shall be sheathed 
and the covenant and agreement of 
peace signed. 

We shall not have a lasting and 
enduring peace until men shall ac- 
cept that other part of the Kingdom 
of God, the truth that has been de- 
livered in the restoration of the 
everlasting gospel. My heart thrills 
when I look at our boys. I saw 
seven or eight hundred of them 
leaving Camp Lewis in the Ninety- 
first Division, going to France. 
Don't you fathers and mothers 
grieve any more about them as to 
whether or not they will keep them- 
selves clean. I have this witness 
and testimony that they are doing 
it ; about ninety per cent of them, are 
as clean and as pure as though they 
were missionaries performing their 
work in the mission field. I have 
had the sanction and opportu- 
nity to ordain scores of them 
to the priesthood, many who never 
had any priesthood, did not know 
anything about it nor care about 
it ; but the Spirit of the Lord 
is working upon them, and I 
have a witness that they will keep 
themselves true to their covenants, 
though many of them shall in all 
probability lay down their lives. 
But I see them in the visions as 
of the future, men who today are 
clothed upon with the uniform of 



their country, going forth to offer 
their lives for the establishment of 
truth and liberty among the na- ■ 
tions of the earth. I see the day 
when they will go forth as mission- 
aries of the Church. Such a band 
of men God is preparing to do a 
work that never before has been 
done in the history of this Church ; 
when they will stand in Germany, 
in Belgium, in France, in the isl- 
ands of the sea, and in all the Euro- 
pean nations, these very identical 
men, ministers of the Lord Jesus 
Christ, carrying the balm that will 
heal the wounds of the nations. 
There will not be a dog to wag its 
tail against them. They shall be 
honored. God is preparing them for 
another service. 

May the Lord bless this Church 
and the membership thereof, that 
we may get out of debt in this good 
time; seventies and elders, prepare 
yourselves for the great demand, for 
it will come and God's word shall 
be carried to the ends of the earth. 
We do not retract what has been 
said concerning that message which 
was delivered to the Prophet Jo- 
seph Smith. We reannounce it, not 
in a spirit of boastfulness, but in a 
spirit of deep gratitude to God our 
Father, and say to all the ends of 
the earth, this is essential for the 
salvation and peace of the world. 
God speed the time when the world 
will receive it, I humbly pray, in 
the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 

I have only one regret, and that 
is that this day could not be length- 
ened out some six or eight or twelve 
hours longer, so that we could hear

are full of the spirit of their mis- 
sions and of the Lord, and that

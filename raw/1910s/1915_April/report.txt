GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



I have no doubt that many of the 
good people gathered here this 
morning, not having heard, widl 
wonder what has become of the 
great Tabernacle organ. It may be 
proper for me to say to you that the 
organ is undergoing thorough re- 
pairs, and is in a condition that it 
can not be used at present. Per- 
haps it will not be prepared for use 
for several weeks to come. Since 
the last conference held in this tab- 
ernacle, the tabernacle itself has un- 
dergone somewhat extensive re- 
pairs. A new floor has been laid, 
the seats have all been renovated, 
repainted, revarnished, and the 
building put in very excellent con- 
dition. During the process of paint- 
ing and renovating the interior of 
the building, it was necessary to 
keep up a high degree of heat to 
dry the paint, etc., to have the build- 
ing ready for this conference. It 
was found that this prolonged heat- 
ing injuriously affected some parts 
of the organ, putting it really out of 
order for the present. I thought just 
a word of explanation with refer- 
ence to this matter might be ap- 
propriate at this time. 

This is the opening session of 
the eighty-fifth annual general con- 
ference of the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints. I feel 
very thankful indeed that I have 
been permitted, with the rest of you, 
to be present at the opening of this 
conference, and I hope that we will 
enjoy a blessed time together, dur- 
ing the three days that many, if not 
all of us, will have the privilege of 
assembling here, morning and af- 
ternoon, to be instructed and to 
give instruction and to hear exhor- 
tation and, if necessary, be reproved 
as the Spirit of the Lord may direct 
those who shall address us from 
time to time. I am very happy, in- 



deed, under' the impressions that 
weigh upon my mind with reference 
to the prosperity of the work of the 
Lord throughout these valleys of 
the mountains, and in the various 
missions of the Church throughout 
the world. Everything seems to 
point to the fact, which we hold in 
our faith and in our anticipation, 
that the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints, is still pursuing 
its course peacefully onward and up- 
ward, extending and increasing on 
the right hand and on the left, and 
all along the front. It is really un- 
necessary, perhaps, for me to re- 
peat, in some measure, at least, that 
which has been frequently said at 
the opening of conferences of the 
Church, that there never has been a 
time, at least within my remem- 
brance, when the Church was in a 
better condition spiritually and tem- 
porally, than it is today. I do not 
believe that there has ever been a 
time when the organizations of the 
various quorums of the Priesthood 
were more nearly perfect or more 
diligent than they are at present, or 
when the stakes of Zion were more 
properly guarded and their interests 
watched by those who are presid- 
ing over them than they are today. 
I believe that our general and aux- 
iliary organizations of the Church, 
also the standard organizations of 
the Priesthood, are performing their 
duty quite as well now, and I think 
somewhat better, than at any pre- 
vious period of the Church's his- 
tory. Why should it not be so ? We 
are not "ever learning and never 
coming to a knowledge of the 
truth." On the contrary, we are 
ever learning and are ever drawing 
nearer to a proper comprehension 
of the truth, the duty and the re- 
sponsibility that devolve upon mem- 
bers of the Church who are called

to responsible positions in it. Not 
only does this apply to those mem- 
bers which are called to act in re- 
sponsible positions, but it applies to 
those who may be termed "lay mem- 
bers," if we may use such a term 
with reference to members of the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints. 

Who is there, under the circum- 
stances that exist around us, that is 
not growing? Who is there of us 
that is not learning something day 
by day? Who is there of us that is 
not gaining experience as we pass 
along, and are attending to the du- 
ties of membership in the Church, 
and to the duties of citizens of our 
state, and citizens of our great and 
glorious nation? It seems to me 
that it would be a very sad comment 
upon the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints and her people to 
suppose for a moment that we are at 
a standstill, that we have ceased to 
grow, ceased to improve and to ad- 
vance in the scale of intelligence, 
and in the faithful performance of 
duty in every condition in which we 
are placed as a people and as mem- 
bers of the Church of Christ. 

I am most happy, my brethren 
and sisters, to say to you that which 
you all know, that the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is 
at peace with itself, and it is at peace 
with all the world. We have no 
spirit of war in our hearts. We 
have been taught and we have 
learned that it is a part of our duty, 
and a very important part, to aban- 
don the spirit of strife, contention, 
and warfare, either among ourselves 
or against any portion of the chil- 
dren of men. We send out our el- 
ders to the nations of the earth, not 
to make war upon the religious or- 
ganizations that exist, not to con- 
tend w'ith them and to create strife, 



confusion and contention among the 
inhabitants of the world. The mes- 
sage that we have to bear to men is 
the message of life, peace, salvation, 
and redemption from sin. 

Our elders are instructed here, 
and they are taught from their 
childhood up, that they are not to 
go out and make war upon the re- 
ligious organizations of the world 
when they are called to go out to 
preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ, 
but to go and bear with them the 
message which has been given to 
us through the instrumentality of 
the Prophet Joseph, in this latter 
dispensation, whereby men may 
learn the truth, if they will. They 
are sent out to offer the olive 
branch of peace to the world, to of- 
fer the knowledge that God has 
spoken from the heavens once more 
to his children upon the earth ; that 
God has in his mercy restored again 
to the world the fulness of the 
Gospel of His Only Begotten Son, 
in the flesh, that God has revealed 
and restored to mankind the divine 
power and authority from Himself, 
whereby they are enabled and auth- 
orized to perform the ordinances of 
the Gospel of Jesus Christ neces- 
sary for their salvation, and their 
performance of these ordinances 
must of necessity be acceptable un- 
to God who has given to them the 
authority to perform them in His 
name. Our elders are sent out to 
preach repentance of sin, to preach 
righteousness, to preach to the 
world the gospel of love, of fellow- 
ship and of friendship among man- 
kind, to teach men and women to 
do that which is right in the sight of 
God and in the presence of all men, 
to teach them the fact that God has 
organized His Church, a Church of 
which He, Himself, is the author 
and the founder — not Joseph Smith,

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



not President Brigham Young, not 
the Twelve Apostles, that have been 
chosen in this dispensation — to them 
does not belong the honor of estab- 
lishing the Church, God is its au- 
thor, God is its founder and we are 
sent out and we send out our elders 
to make this proclamation to the 
world, and leave it to their own 
judgment and discretion as to 
whether they will investigate it, 
learn the, truth for themselves, and 
accept it, or whether they will reject 
it. We do not make war upon them ; 
if they do not receive it, we do not 
contend with them if they fail to 
benefit themselves by receiving the 
message that we give to them for 
their own good, we only pity. Our 
sympathy goes out to those who will 
not receive the truth and who will 
not walk in the light when the light 
shines before them ; not hatred, not 
enmity, not the spirit of condemna- 
tion ; it is our duty to leave con- 
demnation in the hands of Almighty 
God. He is the only real, true, 
righteous, impartial judge, and we 
leave judgment in His hands. Tt is 
not our business to proclaim calami- 
ties, judgments, destruction and the 
wrath of God upon men, if they will 
not receive the truth. Let them read 
the word of God, as recorded in the 
Xew and the Old Testaments, and, 
if they will receive it let them read 
the word that has been restored 
through the gift and power of God 
to Joseph the Prophet, as contained 
in the Doctrine and Covenants and 
in the Book of Mormon. Let them 
read these things, and they will learn 
there, themselves, the promises that 
God has made to those who will not 
hearken when they hear the truth, 
but will close their ear^ and their 
eyes against the light. We need not 
repeat these things and try to im- 
pose upon the feelings and judg- 



ments of men by threatening them 
or by warning them against the dan- 
gers and evils that may come upon 
the ungodly, the disobedient, the un- 
thankful, and those who will not 
yield to the truth. They will learn 
it soon enough, if we do not men- 
tion it to them at all. 

It is not a part of our business to 
dwell upon these things ; our duty is 
to tell the truth, preach the truth, 
the peaceable things of the King- 
dom of God, the way of life and 
salvation, the way of repentance, the 
way of righteousness, the way of 
love and of dealing one with an- 
other, the golden rule to do unto 
others as we would that they should 
do unto us, as taught by the Son of 
God. The great object and duty 
that devolves upon the Latter-day 
Saints is to learn, each man and 
each women for himself and for 
herself, their individual duty as 
members of the Church. Just as 
soon as a man or woman learns his 
and her duty to God and to those 
who are members with them in the 
household of faith, peace is estab- 
lished, love and good will are as- 
sured, no back-bitting, no fault-find- 
ing, no bearing false witness against 
neighbors, no strife, no contention. 
For the moment that a Latter-day 
Saint learns his duty, he will learn 
that it is his business to make peace, 
to establish good will, to work right- 
eousness, to be filled with the spirit 
of kindness, love, charity, and for- 
giveness ; and, so far as he con- 
cerned, there can be no war, no 
strife, no contention, no quarreling, 
no disunion ; no factions can arise 
among the people who know their 
duty as Latter-day Saints. 

Another great and important duty 
devolving upon this people is to 
teach their children, from their cra- 
dle until they become men and

women, every principle of the Gos- 
pel, and endeavor, as far as it lies in 
the power of the parents, to instil 
into their hearts a love for God, the 
truth, virtue, honesty, honor and in- 
tegrity to every thing that is good. 
That is important for all men and 
women who stand at the head of a 
family in the household of faith. 
Teach your children the love of God. 
Teach them to love the principles of 
the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Teach 
them to love their fellowmen, and 
especially to love their fellow mem- 
bers in the Church, that they may 
be true to their fellowship with the 
people of God. Teach them to 
honor the priesthood, to honor the 
authority that God has bestowed 
upon His Church for the proper 
.government of His Church. The 
house of God is a house of order, 
and not a house of confusion ; and 
it could not be thus, if there were 
not those who had authority to pre- 
side, to direct, to counsel, to lead in 
the affairs of the Church. No house 
would be a house of order if it were 
not properlv organized as the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints is organized. Take away 
the organization of the Church, and 
its power would cease. Every part 
of its organization is necessary, and 
essential to its perfect existence. 
Disregard, ignore, or omit any part 
and you start imperfection in the 
Church ; and if we should continue 
in that way we would find ourselves 
like those of old, being led by error, 
superstition, ignorance, and by the 
cunning and craftiness of men. We 
would soon leave out here a little 
and there a little, here a line and 
there a precept, until we would be- 
come like the rest of the world, 
divided, disorganized, confused, and 
without knowledge, without revela- 
t*»n or inspiration, and without Di- 



vine authority or power. Of course, 
it is very necessary that those who 
preside in the Church should learn 
thoroughly their duties. There is 
not a man holding any position of 
authority in the Church who can 
perform his duty as he should in 
any other spirit than in the spirit of 
fatherhood and brotherhood toward 
those over whom he presides. Those 
who have authority should not be 
rulers, nor dictators, they should not 
be arbitrary, they should gain the 
hearts, the confidence and the love 
of those over whom they preside, 
by kindness and love unfeigned, by 
gentleness of spirit, by persuasion, 
by an example that is above re- 
proach and above the reach of un- 
just criticism. In this way, in the 
kindness of their hearts, in their love 
for their people, they lead them in 
the path of righteousness, and teach 
them the way of salvation, by say- 
ing to them both by precept and 
example : Follow me, as I follow 
our head, the Redeemer of the 
world. This is the duty of those 
who preside. The duty of the high 
councils of the Church, when they 
are called to act upon questions in- 
volving the membership or standing 
of members of the Church, is to find 
out the truth, the facts, and then 
judge according to the truth and the 
facts that are brought to their un- 
derstanding, always tempered with 
mercy, love, and kindness, and with 
the spirit in their souls to save and 
not to destroy and cast out. Our 
mission is to save, not destroy ; our 
aim should be to build up, and not 
to tear down. Our calling is to 
convey the spirit of love, truth, 
peace and good will to mankind 
throughout the world ; that war may 
cease ; that strife may come to an 
end. and that peace may prevail. 
I thank God. my Heavenly Father,

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



as you do, every one of you present 
here today, and as do all the people 
of the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints, that our land is 
at peace as much as it is. I am sor- 
ry that there should be any internal 
disruptions, division, or contention 
existing at all among the various 
organizations of the people of our 
land. I am sorry that there should 
be strife. If they had the true spirit 
of the Gospel of Jesus Christ they 
would not have strife ; they would 
cease to harbor feelings of conten- 
tion and strife ; if troubles came they 
would meet together and deliberate 
in the spirit of wisdom, meekness 
and humility, invoking the blessing 
and spirit of Almighty God upon 
their deliberations and counsels, and 
calmly decide together upon that 
which would be for the common 
good, and then go as one man to do 
that which is necessary to build up 
the nation and the country in which 
we dwell. I am glad that we have 
kept out of war so far, and I hope 
and pray that we may not be under 
the necessity of sending our sons to 
war, or experience as a nation the 
distress, the anguish and sorrow 
that come from a condition such as 
exists upon the old continent. Oh 
God, have mercy upon thy poor 
children in Europe, and throughout 
the world, who are brought under 
the awful conditions that exist there 
because of the ambition and pride of 
men who claim the right and power 
to dictate, even to life or death, the 
conduct of the people over whom 
they rule. 

My brethren and sisters, God is 
with you ; the Lord is with this peo- 
ple ; and if we will be His children 
in very deed as He is in very deed 
our Father, I tell you that God will 
temper the elements for your good ; 
He will bless you with health ; He 



will bless you with abundance : He 
will bless the earth and make it 
fruitful. Those who reap their har- 
vest by the toil and sweat of their 
brow, from mother earth, will have 
bounteous harvests if they will only 
serve God in their hearts and in 
their outward life. I feel just as 
sure of this as I do that I am stand- 
ing before you here. 

I do not . feel that it would lie to 
my advantage, nor to yours, for me 
to continue my remarks very much 
longer. I have no need of course to 
refer to my personal feelings and 
condition ; but I have recently passed 
through my share of sorrow. Nev- 
ertheless the Lord has been so mer : 
ciful to me, He has blessed me in 
so many ways, and multiplied His 
favors and mercies upon me to such 
an extent that it would be shameful 
for me to complain, even under the 
most severe afflictions and adverse 
conditions and circumstances in life. 
T love truth wherever I see or find 
it. I love men and women who are 
virtuous and honorable. T would 
love a man, no matter who he is, if 
T knew that he was honest before 
God. He might differ with me in 
religious views, and in many other 
ways : but, is he honest with his fel- 
low man and with his God? If he 
is, I honor him, and I love him for 
his honesty. 

When I think of our mothers, the 
mothers of our children, and realize 
that under the inspiration of the 
Gospel they live virtuous, pure, hon- 
orable lives, true to their husbands, 
true to their children, true to their 
convictions of the Gospel, oh, how 
my soul goes out in pure love for 
them ; how noble and how God- 
given, how choice, how desirable 
and how indispensable they arc to 
the accomplishment of God's pur- 
poses and the fulfilment of His de-

crees. My brethren, can you mis- 
treat yonr wives, the mothers of 
vonr children? Can you help treat- 
ing- them with love and kindness? 
Can ) r ou help trying to make their 
lives as comfortable and happy as 
possible, lightening their burdens to 
the utmost of your ability, making 
life pleasant for them and for their 
children in their homes? How can 
you help it ? How can any one help 
feeling an intense interest in the 
mother of his children, and also in 
his children? If we possess the 
Spirit of God. we can not do other- 
wise. It is only when men depart 
from the right spirit, when they 
digress from their duty, that they 
will neglect or dishonor any soul 
that is committed to their care. They 
are bound to honor their wives and 
children. Intelligent men, men of 
business, men of affairs, men who 
are involved constantly in the labors 
of life, and have to devote their en- 
ergies and thought to their labors 
.and duties, may not enjoy as many 
comforts with their families as they 
would like, but if they have the 
Spirit of the Lord with them in the 
performance of their temporal du- 
ties, they will never neglect the 
mothers of their children, nor their 
children. They will not fail to teach 
them the principles of life and set 
before them a proper example. Don't 
do anything yourselves that you 
would have to say to your boy, 
"Don't do it." Live so that you can 
sav, "My son, do as I do, follow 
me, emulate my example." That is 
the wav fathers should live, every 
one of us ; and it is a shame, a weak- 
ening, shameful thing for any mem- 
ber of the Church to pursue a course 
that he knows is not right and that 
he would rather his children should 
not follow. What a shameful thing 
it is for a man to place upon himself 



an embargo, a handicap against do- 
ing his full duty to those that love 
him and whom he should love above 
his own life, by yielding to appe- 
tites that are wrong and to passions 
that are base, and doing things that 
he ought not to do, and that he 
would feign keep his children from 
doing. Do your duty, my brethren, 
and the Lord will do His for you. 

We want Zion to grow and be- 
come strong in righteousness. We 
desire the people of Zion to develop 
in understanding and grow in 
knowledge and become strong in 
wisdom. We want you to cultivate 
the spirit of mercy, of charity and 
forgiveness. We want you to be 
generous to the poor ; we desire that 
you will guard the helpless, the 
aged, and provide for them. God 
has made provision in His Church, 
in the complete organization of it, 
so that every faithful soul in it may 
be looked after and nurtured and 
cared for in the hour of need. The 
trouble with us at present is that 
there are so many men who are 
holding membership in the Church, 
who neglect their duty in so many 
ways, that we have not the means to 
provide as amply as we would like 
for the necessities of the poor. When 
you look upon a tithing record, a 
book of large dimensions, contain- 
ing the names of members of the 
Church who do not pay their tith- 
ing, you do not need to wonder why 
the Church has not more means to 
provide for the poor. We are doing 
the best we can with the means we 
have. I am going to read you just 
a few little things that we are doing 
with the means you consecrate to 
the Lord for the upbuilding of Zion.

Committee has examined the re-

The birth rate of the Church for the year 1914 is 39.5 to the thousand. 
The death rate for the year 1914 is 8.3 to the thousand. 
Marriage rate for the year 1914 is 17 to the thousand. 
During the year there were 14,717 children blessed. 
There are 1,316 Elders and 115 women laboring in the missions as 
missionaries. 

Of the membership of the Church residing in the stakes of Zion, 
319.000 were born in the United States. 

There has been a net increase in the membership of the Church in the 
stakes of Zion from the year 1901 to 1914 of 129,493 souls. 

There are now 739 wards and 33 independent branches. There are 
68 stakes of Zion and 21 missions. During the year 1914, 21 new wards 
have been organized and 2 stakes of Zion. 

There have been performed in the Temples during the past year, 
166,909 baptisms for the living and dead, and 72,952 endowments for the 
living and dead. Altogether 326,264 ordinances have been performed in 
the four temples. This is a very considerable increase over any previous 
year. 

Ward teaching has been given considerable attention by the stake and 
ward officers, with the results that in some of the stakes of Zion the work 
has been so well developed that 96 ( / ( of all the families are visited by the 
ward teachers each month. 



Now some people have reported 
that the tithes of the Church amount 
to millions every year, and Joseph F. 
Smith has the absolute control of all 
these millions, and never gives any 
account of them to the world, nor to 
anybody else. Now we are not giv- 
ing this to the world ; we are giving 
it to the Latter-day Saints. These 
amounts which I have read, I think 
it may be proper to state here, cover 
the entire tithing of the Church in 
all the world, for the year 1914. 
Now when you come to talk about 
the millions and millions of dollars 
of tithing paid by the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, it 
is simmered down to $1,887,920, for 
the year 1914, and that was an av- 
erage year. I may be pardoned, per- 
haps, if I say here, for the benefit of 
any who do not know the facts, that 
the law of tithing is a voluntary 
law : that is, it imposes only a vol- 
untary duty upon the people. No 
person's standing as a member of 



the Church, is jeopardized because 
he doesn't pay his tithing. There 
are a good many of us who don't 
observe all the laws, and it is a good 
thing that the Lord does not execute 
justice and judgment upon a great 
many of us because of it. 

The expenses of the general au- 
thorities and the maintenance of the 
First Presidency are paid out of the 
revenues derived from investments, 
and not out of the tithes of the 
Church. These investments, as a 
rule, consist of contributions of 
stocks of various kinds to the 
Church on tithing, which have been 
held by the Church ; and the divi- 
dends that we derive from these 
stocks and investments are for the 
benefit of the people in every in- 
stance, for the Church has never 
made an investment that had not for 
its object the benefiting of the whole 
people, as far as possible, fostering 
industries, and the colonization of 
our country. It has been done for 



10 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



aiding the settlers of our country, 
our state and our adjoining states, 
as far as possible, by assisting them 
with means, to help them lay the 
foundation of prosperity for them- 
selves. 

It just occurs to me that we are 
talking to you on the Sabbath day, 
and some people, perhaps, may feel 
that it is somewhat out of place for 
us to talk about money and tempor- 
alities, about tithing, or the expendi- 
ture of means and the uses made of 
it, on the Sabbath day, but the Sab- 
bath was made for man, and not 
man for the Sabbath. God made or 
designated the Sabbath day for a 
day of rest, a clay of worship, a day 
for goodly deeds, and for humility 
and penitence, and the worship of 
the Almighty in spirit and in truth. 

There has been collected for the 
war sufferers, which is being ex- 
pended under the direction of Presi- 
dent Hyrum M. Smith of the Euro- 
pean Mission, $33,000. This was 
done on one day, practically, a day 
set apart for general contributions 
for the benefit of the sufferers, in 
consequence of the war. T have a 
list of the names of all the stakes 
of Zion and the wards which con- 
tributed these means, and it was all 
contributed and handled and sent to 
the sufferers to lie distributed 
equally and impartially, — to Latter- 
day Saints, mind you, first. T want 
to tell you that, we will be honest 
with you ; we feel that it is the first 
duty of Latter-day Saints to take 
care of themselves, and of their 
poor; and then, if we can extend it 
to others, and as wide and as far as 
we can extend charity and assistance 
to others that are not members of 
the Church, we feel that it is our 
duty to do it. But first look after 
the members of our own household. 
The man who will not provide for 



his own house, as one of old has 
said, is worse than an infidel. So 
we make no apologies for saying 
that we have collected these means 
for the suffering Latter-day Saints 
that are afflicted because of the war, 
in Germany, in Austria, in Italy, in 
Switzerland, Holland and in Eng- 
land and anywhere else where they 
are suffering in consequence of it. 
It cost the fund not one penny, not 
even a postage stamp for collection. 
May be you would like to know 
that : there were no paid agencies, 
no paid collectors. No one received 
a nickel from the funds contributed 
for the assistance of the afflicted 
and the suffering. It was done 
through the channels of the holy 
priesthood, through the organization 
of the Church, in the regular way, 
and it has cost nobody anything. 
The First Presidency received the 
other day the following cable mes- 
sage from the President of the Swiss 
and German Mission : 

"Two thousand dollar relief fund 
thankfully received. Express gratitude to 
God's people. Conditions satisfactory. — 
VALENTINE, President Swiss and German 
Mission." 

We have received also a number 
of returns from President Mvrum 
M. Smith, but in volume, and these 
returns have not been condensed, so 
that they can be presented here. 

Now, we have a few more state- 
ments that I desire to read : Our 
records show that 73^ of all the 
Latter-day Saint families, residing 
in all the stakes of Zion. own their 
own homes. I am sorry that this 
figure is not as large as it has been 
in the past, but we have become 
more numerous than we were when 
95% of the people of the Church 
owned their own little homes and 
owed nothing to anybody for them. 



PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH.

Let me inject here, once more, my 
standing admonition to the Latter- 
day Saints : My brethren, see to it 
that yon do not put a mortgage 
upon the roof that covers the heads 
of your wives and your children. 
Don't do it. Don't plaster your 
farms with mortgages, because it is 
from your farms that you reap your 
food, and the means to provide your 
raiment and your other necessaries 
of life. Keep your possessions free 
from debt. Get out of debt as fast 
as you can, and keep out of debt, for 
that is the way in which the promise 
of God will be fulfilled to the people 
of His Church, that they will be- 
come the richest of all people in the 
world. But this will not happen 
while you mortgage your homes and 
your farms, or run into debt be- 
yond your ability to meet your obli- 
gations ; and thus, perhaps, your 
name and credit be dishonored be- 
cause you over-reached yourselves. 
"Never reach farther than you can 
gather," is a good motto. 

From each of the newly organized 
wards we have received calls to as- 
sist to help build new meeting- 
houses ; and so the work goes on. I 
have read the figures of the hun- 
dreds of thousands that we are ap- 
propriating for the assistance in the 
erection of meetinghouses, taberna- 
cles, and amusement places for the 
vouth of Zion. to keep them under 
proper restraint and control. 

The work in the temples has been 
the largest on record. There have 
been performed in the temples, dur- 
ing the past year, 166.909 baptisms 
for the living and dead, — an indica- 
tion that we are increasing the mem- 
bership of the Church very, very 
much faster in the spirit-world than 
we are on earth. 

Now, my brethren and sisters, we 
do not want to weary you with sta- 



tistics. Our duty is not to deal par- 
ticularly in statistics and in finan- 
cial matters. Our paramount duty 
is the preaching of the Gospel of 
Jesus Christ, and the inculcation of 
the principles of that Gospel in the 
hearts and souls of all our children. 
This is our duty. God bless you. I 
am glad to see you here. I surely 
welcome you with all my soul, and 
I feel in my soul that God will bless 
you for your presence here. Why 
are you here? Because you are 
members of the Church of Jesus 
Christ. You are here because this 
is the annual conference of the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints. You are here because 
you are members of that Church and 
because you are members of the 
priesthood and of the auxiliary or- 
ganizations of the Church and are 
all interested in the well-being, ad- 
vancement, and development, spirit- 
ually, intellectually, physically and 
financially, and every other way, of 
the people of the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints. God 
bless you, I humbly pray, in the 
name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

Stephens.

Certainty of the resurrection — "Eas- 
ter" an improper name for day cele- 
brating the sacred event — The Pass-

that though the body dies the spirit 
lives — Universality of the resurrec-

In presenting myself before you, 
and attempting to speak to you, I 
ask your faith and prayers in my 



12 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



behalf. With you I have listened 
with much interest and pleasure to 
the remarks of our President. He 
has given us the keynote of love and 
good will to one another, and asked 
us to perform the duties that devolve 
upon us, and I believe that we all 
feel to respond to this exhortation. 

The song that we have just lis- 
tened to, "He is Risen," was very 
appropriate, as this is Easter Sun- 
day, which we celebrate in memory 
of the resurrection of Jesus Christ. 
It was a happy message that came 
to the world through this event, the 
resurrection, that Jesus had con- 
quered death and had come forth 
out of the grave. 

The resurrection, the central fact 
of our faith, has been doubted by a 
great many, and yet He was seen 
by His apostles and some of His 
disciples, and by as many as five 
hundred at one time. To us there is 
no doubt about the resurrection. We 
feel grateful to believe and know 
that Christ did rise from the dead, 
that He laid down His life, of Him- 
self, and was able to take it again, 
and thereby give us the hope, the 
assurance, that resurrection will 
come to all of us. 

Last Thursday night was cele- 
brated in memory of His instituting 
the Holy Sacrament ; Friday we 
commemorated His crucifixion, and 
today, the first day of the week, we 
celebrate His resurrection. He rose 
from the grave, the crowning act of 
redemption, and thus finished the 
great mission given Him by His 
Heavenly Father. It was at the 
Jewish Passover that this great 
event occurred. Here in America, 
and in England, we call it Easter: 
in German v they call it Ostem. Both 
the English and the Germans have 
named this sacred festival after a 
heathen goddess. How much better 



it would have been to have kept the 
old name, or a derivation of it, as 
in other lands, for instance in Scan- 
dinavia, where it is called Paaske, 
instead of a name that has no found- 
ation upon holiness. Easter is one 
of the variable feasts. Among Chris- 
tian nations it has been thought best 
to celebrate it at a time when the 
feast would include Thursday. Fri- 
day and Sunday. In the early days 
the Christians, like the Jews, cele- 
brated it on a certain day of the 
month, but this has been changed to 
the present custom. 

I consider that this day brings to 
us more joy than the commemora- 
tion of any other event that has hap- 
pened in the world. The Passover 
was instituted to remember that a 
number of the children of Israel 
were saved from death by obeying a 
certain command of God. namely, 
that of sprinkling the blood on the 
door posts ; then the angel of death 
passed over, and the first-born in the 
families of the Israelites was spared, 
while among the Egyptians, and 
those who did not obey this com- 
mand, the first-born was stricken 
with death. The Passover that we 
commemorate today is of much 
greater importance. While the old 
Passover commemorated the saving 
of a few. our Passover commemor- 
ates the victory over death, the 
bringing of life unto the w hole hu- 
man race. Every son or daughter 
of Adam is benefited by this great 
event, because the resurrection will 
come to all. Jesus voluntarily gave 
His life for us. and by doing so re- 
deemed us from the effects of the 
fall. How grateful and thankful 
we ought to be to Him. 

Tn the morning of the day that 
He rose from the dead. He was seen 
bv some of the faithful women that 
believed in ITim. and by some of the 



PRESIDENT ANTHON H. LUND. 



13 



apostles. On the same day He 
joined two disciples going to Em- 
maus, who were very much con- 
cerned about what had taken place. 
Then, ''beginning at Moses and all 
the prophets, He expounded unto 
them" the scriptures concerning 
Himself, proving that Christ should 
suffer and rise again. Afterwards, 
in telling about His speaking to 
them, they said that their hearts 
burned within them. They had not 
understood the great mission that 
He was to perform. That evening 
His apostles had gathered in a room 
with closed doors, and as they were 
talking He appeared in their midst. 
All but Thomas were present ; ten 
of them saw Him, felt of Him, and 
rejoiced that the Master was again 
with them. Next Sunday, Thomas, 
the doubter, seeing Jesus, was con- 
vinced that He had risen. After this 
Jesus met with the Apostles at Lake 
Gennesaret. They received in- 
structions from Him there, and 
Peter was called to be the shepherd 
over His flock. 

While His body lay in the grave 
we are told that He went to the 
spirits in prison, and preached unto 
them. Luther in his little catechism 
said that Jesus went down to hell, 
and on the third day rose from the 
dead. Peter informs us of what He 
did during the time that He was in 
the spirit-world. The word "hell," 
as it occurs in the New Testament, 
has been translated from three dif- 
ferent words : Gehenna, Hades, and 
Tartarus. Whenever the word 
"Gehenna" is used it always means 
a place of torture, conveying the real 
meaning of the word "hell" to us. 
The other word is "Llades," which 
could have been translated better 
perhaps by the compound word 
"spirit- world." The Greeks under- 
stood the word to mean the realm of 



Pluto, or the place for the shades of 
departed ones, and in the latter sense 
it is used in the scriptures. We read 
in the Bible that "death and hell" 
should give up their dead, and in 
the Book of Mormon we read a sim- 
ilar statement. Hell does not mean 
the place of torture to which the 
wicked will be assigned at the great 
judgment, though those who have 
been wicked, and transgressed the 
law here, are not apt to be very 
happy in the spirit-world. 

Many people deny that the spirit 
lives, and can think and act between 
death and the resurrection. They 
who hold this opinion quote what 
the preacher says in the Book of 
Ecclesiastes, that "the living know 
that they shall die, but the dead 
know not anything ;" and in another 
verse in the same chapter he says, 
"Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do. 
do with all thy might, for there is 
no work, nor device, nor knowledge, 
nor wisdom in the grave whither 
thou goest." And so they conclude 
that spirit and body sleep in the 
grave untij the day of resurrection. 
Not long ago I read a tract upon 
this subject in which the author rid- 
iculed the idea of the spirits going 
to the spirit-world, and he declared 
that there is no such thing as a hu- 
man spirit. Now, what did the 
preacher mean? Did he mean that 
the spirit and the body lay in the 
grave slumbering, and hence there is 
"no knowledge, no wisdom, in the 
grave" and that "the dead know- 
not anything?" No, I firmly believe 
that he alluded o'nly to the body : the 
body is laid in the grave and it does 
not know anything, for the part of 
man that knows, thinks and wills, 
has left. And that this was really his 
meaning I take from another of his 
sayings : "Then shall the dust re- 
turn to the earth as it was, and the 



14 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



spirit shall return unto God that 
gave it." Now, this is said by the 
same man who wrote the above quo- 
tations, which are used so often 
against the doctrine of an interme- 
diate state between death and the 
resurrection. He declares that the 
spirit shall return to God who gave 
it ; consequently, he could not have 
included the spirit in his statement 
that "the dead know not anything;" 
he alluded to that part only that was 
laid in the grave. 

Alma is very plain on the subject 
of an intermediate state. He tells us 
that the spirits of the righteous go 
to a place in the spirit-world called 
Paradise, a place of joy and happi- 
ness ; and that the wicked go to a 
place by themselves also, where thev 
are suffering in the knowledge of 
the judgment that is coming. Now, 
when Jesus' spirit left His body, it 
went to Hades, but I believe it went 
to Paradise first, for He said to the 
repentant thief upon the cross, "To- 
day shalt thou be with me in Para- 
dise." No doubt He went there, and 
first of all informed those who had 
served God and been righteous, and 
whose day of resurrection perhaps 
was near, of what he had been able 
to accomplish, that He had fulfilled 
His mission, had overcome death, 
and thereby brought the hope to all 
that they should be resurrected. 
After this, He went on the glorious 
mission to preach to the spirits in 
prison, those who at one time were 
disobedient, and had rejected the 
gospel preached by Noah. His mis- 
sion was to proclaim liberty to the 
captives, open the prison doors to 
them that were bound. He read 
from the scroll handed to Him in 
the synagogue at Nazareth — the first 
verses of the 61st chapter of Isaiah 
— and they describe His own mis- 



sion, and allude to the work He was 
to perform. He brought joy to 
thousands who had so long been 
confined, and had suffered for their 
rejection of the gospel. 

When He was resurrected, Mary 
discovered that He was the Master, 
and wanted to worship Him, but He 
told her not to touch Him for He 
had not yet been with the Father. 
We understand where He had been 
and the work He had done, for His. 
mission was not only to the few that 
heard Him on earth, but to all both 
living and dead ; He said Himself, 
"the hour is coming, in the which all 
that are in their graves shall hear 
His voice." His mission was for all 
that should come upon the earth, 
and to all of them He brought re- 
lease from the bands of death, and 
He bestowed on all the precious 
blessing of the resurrection. But 
the resurrection will not be the same 
to all. for they who have done good 
will come forth unto the resurrec- 
tion of life, and they that have done 
evil will come forth unto the resur- 
rection of damnation. This we are 
told in the words of the Savior 
Himself. 

Now, we rejoice here today in 
dwelling upon this great event. We 
feel that it was true, what the 
Prophet Joseph received by revela- 
tion and gave to us concerning the 
resurrection and salvation for the 
dead. This doctrine gives a satis- 
factory explanation of the justice of 
God. If it be true, what many in 
the world believe, that only the few 
that hear the doctrine of Christ and 
receive it should be saved, and that 
all the other myriads who come upon 
the earth should be condemned, be- 
cause they had not heard His name, 
then it looks very unjust. But when 
we remember what Peter says, that 



BISHOP ORRIN P. MILLER. 



15 



the dead should hear the Gospel, 
that they might be judged accord- 
ing to men in the flesh, we begin to 
understand the justice of God. The 
Gospel will be preached to all ; every 
one shall hear of the Mission of 
Christ, and shall have a chance 
either to receive or reject, whether 
living upon the earth or whether 
they have departed. How broad is 
the platform of salvation ! The Lord 
is just to all, and no one coming be- 
fore His judgment seat shall be able 
to say that he has not been dealt 
with justly. 

Now. brethren and sisters, I see 
the time allotted is past. I rejoice 
to be with you ; I rejoice in the 
Gospel as preached to us; I rejoice 
in the restoration of the Gospel and 
in knowing that Joseph Smith was a 
Prophet of God. May the Lord 
bless us all, I ask in the name of 
Jesus. Amen. 

President Smith stated that an- 
other overflow meeting will be held 
in the Assembly Hall, at 2 p. m., at 
which Elder Joseph F. Smith, Jr., 
will preside ; also an outdoor meet- 
ing", in front of the Bureau of Infor- 
mation, at the same hour, under di- 
rection of Elder George F. Rich- 
ards. He also announced that ar- 
rangements have been made, by the 
Presiding Bishopric, to furnish ac- 
commodations to Conference visitors 
who are not otherwise provided for. 

"Rock of Ages," a soprano solo, 
was rendered by Sister Lily Shipp. 

The choir sang the anthem, "Song 
of the Redeemed." 

Benediction was pronounced by 
Elder Lewis Anderson. 

Conference adjourned until 2 
p. m. 



OVERFLOW MEETING. 

An overflow session of the Con- 
ference was held in the Assembly 
Hall, adjoining the Tabernacle, at 
10 a. m. The services were presided 
over by Elder Rudger Clawson, and 
the Cottonwood Stake Choir, under 
direction of Manasseh Smith, fur- 
nished the music. 

The Choir sang the hymn : 

Come, dearest Lord, descend and 
dwell, 

By faith and love, in every breast; 
Then shall we know, and taste,, and 
feel 

The joys that cannot be expressed. 

The invocation was offered by 
Elder John R. Barnes. 
The choir sang the hymn : 

As the dew, from heaven distilling, 
Gently on the grass descends, 

And revives it, thus fulfilling 
What Thy providence intends. 

BISHOP ORRIN P. MILLER. 

(Of the Presiding Bishopric.) 

It is a great surprise to me, my 
beloved brethren and sisters, to be 
called upon to address you for a few 
moments upon this occasion. My 
heart is full of gratitude to my 
Heavenly Father for this privilege, 
especially, of meeting with so many 
of the Latter-day Saints, and that 
we are assembled on such a beau- 
tiful Sabbath morning. The bosom 
of the earth having been refreshed 
by showers of rain, and then the 
sunshine, brings to our hearts 
thanksgiving and rejoicing, that we 
have such glorious conditions in 
coming together to worship the 
Lord. 

When we think that this is Easter 



16 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Sunday, a very important day to us 
Latter-day Saints, with the views 
we have of the life of the Savior, it 
brings to us rejoicing and thanks- 
giving. Our hearts bound with hap- 
piness when we realize that we have 
been established in these valleys, in 
the fastnesses of the Rocky Moun- 
tains, according to the predictions 
of ancient as well as modern proph- 
ets. O what joy it brings to us when 
we see the tens of thousands of 
honest-hearted, devoted people as- 
sembling together this morning to 
worship the Lord, and to be taught 
of His ways, that we might walk in 
the path which He has marked out 
for us as His children. We could 
not help but repoice at this, and 
our hearts are made glad because 
we have confidence in those that are 
leading us as prophets, seers, and 
revelators, in this the dispensation 
of the fulness of times. 

The great number of people that 
have gathered together upon this oc- 
casion have come from the various 
stakes of Zion, sixty-seven stakes 
now organized, and different states 
of the Union. I presume every stake 
in the Church is here represented ; I 
have noticed individuals from Can- 
ada on the north to Arizona and 
Old Mexico on the south, and T take 
it that all have come to headquar- 
ters, to the present center stake, that 
we may be taught of the wars and 
laws of the Lord, that we might be 
able to walk in His paths, and re- 
main true and faithful unto the end. 

What joy and satisfaction these 
thoughts bring to us, when we look 
back over the history of our people. 
In looking over this congregation, 
we see pioneers who blazed the way 
across the desert and came inte 
these valleys many years ago, and 
helped to establish the ensign that 
was spoken of by one of the ancient 



prophets, that should be established 
in the tops of the mountains, in the 
midst of the everlasting hills, and all 
nations should flow into it. We feel 
to rejoice that these prophecies are 
being fulfilled, and that we. the off- 
spring of those great pioneers, are 
enjoying these blessings, the fruits 
of their labor. When we reflect 
upon the conditions that confronted 
them when they came into the^e val- 
leys ; nothing but a barren waste, 
not a beautiful shrub or a tree, ex- 
cept the few that nature had pro- 
duced, the valley being desolate and 
barren, and the only human asso- 
ciate that they had, beside them- 
selves, was the Lamanite or native 
Indian ; and the howl of the coyote 
was heard on the plains and the 
prairies. When we look now at the 
condition of our people, luxury and 
ease evident in every valley in the 
fastnesses of the Rocky Mountains, 
and we are enjoying the best and 
happiest and most prosperous times 
that have ever come to our people 
since the settlement of these valleys ; 
and when we reflect that many were 
buried upon the plains on the jour- 
ney from the Missouri "River — my 
grandfather was buried out on the 
lonely desert, rolled up in a blanket 
and put into a shallow grave — when 
T reflect upon these things. T feel 
grateful to God for the blessings 
that have come to us. 

I feel like Neohi of old. full of 
gratitude and praise to my Heavenly 
Father, that T have been born of 
goodly parents, and that T have been 
taught in the ways of the Lord, 
that T might appreciate His bless- 
ings. And O how I rejoice that the 
hearts of my parents were touched 
when the humble elder came to them 
in their native country and preached 
unto them the Gospel of Jesus 
Christ, as we understand and enjoy

it this day. We rejoice in these 
things because we understand and 
comprehend them. My parents re- 
ceived the Gospel in their native 
country, one of them across the 
ocean, in the land of the troubled 
nations of today, and their coming 
to this blessed country made it pos- 
sible for me to be present with you 
upon this occasion. Why should we 
not rejoice when we realize these 
things. 

And now, my young brethren and 
sisters, you who have been born in 
these valleys, born "under the drop- 
pings of the sanctuary," heirs to the 
holy priesthood in the new and ever- 
lasting covenant which God has es- 
tablished in the earth, how we 
should rejoice in these things, and 
always be grateful and willing to 
bear our testimony to the great 
blessings which the Lord has given 
unto ns as His children. How we 
venerate the names and the mem- 
ories of our aged parents. We do 
not need to hire men to teach us, and 
to proclaim to us that the Gospel is 
true ; thousands of white-haired vet- 
erans could stand up in the congre- 
gations of the Saints today, should 
the President ask them, yea, ten 
thousand of them could rise up and 
proclaim in power and authority, 
but in a humble spirit, that they 
know Jesus is the Christ and that 
Joseph Smith was a prophet of God. 
We have been taught this truth, and 
have received a knowledge of it, we 
have received the Holy Ghost, and 
that testimony has come to us, hav- 
ing obeyed the law upon which these 
blessings are predicated. It is not 
guess-work with us ; we know it for 
a surety, we have been converted 
and convinced of these truths. We 
have been baptized in water, the 
same as the Savior was baptized by 
John, and we have come forth out of 



the water, and had hands laid upon 
us for the reception of the Holy 
Ghost, and the Holy Ghost has come 
to us, and it has been as the prom- 
ises said, a constant companion and 
guide to us, a monitor of righteous- 
ness and truth, that shall remain 
with us forever, if we are faithful. 
These truths abide in our hearts ; 
we know they are true, no matter 
what the world may say about us 
Latter-clay Saints. 

I desire to bear my testimony to 
the principles of the Gospel as they 
have been revealed to us. I have 
endeavored in my youth to accept 
every one of them, as the Prophet 
has revealed them ; and I bear my 
testimony to you that he has re- 
vealed no untruth, but everything 
that he has revealed has been the 
truth, and truth is mighty and will 
prevail. The Latter-day Saints can 
truly sing the beautiful hymn, 

"High on the mountain top truth's ban- 
ner is unfurled, 

Ye nations, now look up, it waves to all 
the world." 

May the Lord bless us is my 
prayer in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER CHARLES H. HART. 

( Of First Council of Seventy.) 

I rejoice with you, my brethren 
and sisters and friends, in the glory 
and beauty of this beautiful Easter 
morn, and for the hope and the as- 
surance which it brings unto us. It 
has been nearly eighty-five years 
now since the inauguration of these 
conferences, such as we are partici- 
pating in today. And during that 
time the people of the Church have 
become firmly established in the 
faith. They have stronger assur- 
ances and more evidences of the 



18 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



divinity of the work than ever be- 
fore. 

Men have examined, from the 
standpoint of reason and philosophy, 
in later years as never before per- 
haps in the history of the world, the 
great problems of life, particularly 
the immortality of the spirit. And 
it is interesting for us to know that 
their deductions are in confirmation 
of the teachings of the Church. I 
rejoice with you that our Heavenly 
Father sent His only begotten Son 
in the flesh to dwell upon the earth, 
and to give us an example of the 
perfect life, and also that He per- 
mitted that He should die for the 
sins of the world, and that He might 
be resurrected, as a concrete ex- 
ample of the great doctrine of the 
immortality of the spirit and the 
resurrection of the body. 

In the examination of this ques- 
tion of the immortality of the spirit, 
from the standpoint of reason and 
science and philosophy, men have 
considered the analogies we find in 
nature to those of the resurrection, 
and I think that the argument has 
not been stated more beautifully 
than by the present Secretary of this 
great Republic of ours. His words 
are familiar to many of you. They 
may seem trite even to some of you 
who are very familiar with them, 
but I think it would not be inappro- 
priate upon this Easter morn, to 
read this brief and concise argu- 
ment, by way of analogy with things 
we find in nature. He says : 

"If the Father deign to touch with 
divine power the cold and pulseless 
heart of the buried acorn, and to make 
it burst forth from its prison walls 
with new life, will He refuse the word 
of hope to the sons of men when the 
frost of winter comes? If matter, 
mute and inanimate, when touched by 
the forces of nature to a multitude of 
forms can never die, will the spirit of 



man surfer annihilation when it has 
paid a brief visit, like a royal guest, 
to this tenement of clay? No, I am 
as sure that there is another life as I 
am that I live this day. In Cairo I 
secured a few grains of wheat that had 
slumbered for more than three thous- 
and years in an Egyptian tomb. As I 
looked upon them this thought came 
into my mind: If one of these grains 
had been planted on the banks of the 
Nile the year after it grew, and if all 
its lineal descendants had been planted 
and replanted from that time till now, 
its progeny now would be sufficiently 
numerous to feed the teeming millions 
of the world. There is in a grain of 
wheat an invisible something that has 
power to discard the body which we 
see, and from earth and air fashion a 
new body so much like that one that 
we cannot tell the one from the other. 
And if this invisible germ of life in 
the grain of wheat can thus pass un- 
numbered through three thousand res- 
urrections, I shall not doubt that my 
soul has power to clothe itself with a 
body suited to its new existence, when 
this earthly form has crumbled into 
dust. If He stoops to give the rose- 
bush, whose withered blossoms float 
upon the autumn breeze, the sweet as- 
surance of another springtime, will He 
refuse the words of hope to the sons 
of men when the frosts of winter 
come? Will He leave neglected in the 
earth the soul of man made in the 
image of his Creator? 

In a little while we shall see the 
worm weave about itself a shroud, and 
appear lifeless. But not so. In a short 
time the cerement will be broken, and 
instead of the ugly worm, a beautiful 
winged creature will burst from the 
prison house, and with beautiful wings 
will flit from flower to flower. 

Some one has stated this argu- 
ment in the form of a question 
which really answers itself: "Shall 
man alone, for whom all else sur- 
vives, no resurrection know? Shall 
man alone, imperial man, be sown 
in barren ground, less privileged 
than the grain on which he feeds?" 
As I say, the question really con- 
veys its own answer. 



ELDER CHARLES H. HART.

But philosophers have gone 
deeper than these mere analogies of 
nature, and they have examined the 
arguments made of old to test them 
and to see whether they hold good 
in the light of modern reason and 
science. The lines of the poet Addi- 
son, which immortalize the argu- 
ment of Plato, have been so exam- 
ined. Addison says : 

"Plato, thou reasonest well; it must 
be so" — [That is, it must be that the 
spirit is immortal, and survives the 
death of the body.] 
Else whence this pleasing hope, 
This fond desire, this longing after im- 
mortality? 
Why shrinks the soul back upon itself, 
And startles at destruction? Or 
whence 

This secret dread and inward horror 
of falling into naught?" 

And he answers: 

" 'Tis the divinity that stirs within us. 
'Tis heaven itself that points out an 

hereafter. 
And intimates eternity to man; 
Eternity, thou dreadful pleasing 

thought." 

As I say, the argument of the 
philosopher Plato embodied in these 
lines of the poet has been re-exam- 
ined, and has been found to be 
sound. Of course there would not 
be planted in the human soul for a 
vain purpose the strongest desire 
that exists. It would not be planted 
there only to be mocked. 

One of the syllogysms upon the 
subject of the immortality of the 
spirit has for its terms the assump- 
tion of a reasonable universe, of a 
perfect Deity, and of the high value 
of human life. And. assuming these 
premises, then the conclusion fol- 
lows, with almost inevitable neces- 
sity, that man was not given life for 
a mere day. If we predicate the 
existence of a rational universe, peo- 



pled with creatures whose life is of 
high value, presided over by an all- 
wise and perfect Father, then we can 
conclude that we are not mere 
creatures of a day, that we are not 
chance creatures, to live for a brief 
span and then pass into nothing- 
ness ; but we can rely upon the con- 
viction that came to the Prophet Job 
of old, when he exclaimed : "I know 
that my Redeemer liveth and that 
He shall stand at the latter day upon 
the earth, and though after my skin 
worms destroy this body, yet in my 
flesh shall I see God." 

And why should there not be a 
resurrection of the body? Why 
should we not believe that the spirit 
is immortal? One of the greatest 
philosophers that America has pro- 
duced, John Fisk, in a work dedi- 
cated to his own children, makes the 
assertion that the assumption which 
some people indulge, that the spirit 
does not survive the death of the 
body is the most colossal instance of 
baseless assumption known to all the 
history of philosophy. 

One Dickinson, a European chem- 
ist, speaking on this question at 
Harvard, giving one of the so-called 
Ingersoll lectures on immortality, 
says that it is mere dogmatism to 
say that the soul does not survive 
the death of the body, and that it is 
mere prejudice or inertia to declare 
that we cannot determine whether 
or not the soul does survive the 
death of the body. He and other 
philosophers use the word "soul" in 
the same sense as the word "spirit" 
is used by the Latter-day Saints. 

A short time ago, in Great Brit- 
ain, there was assembled a notable 
gathering of scientists and philoso- 
phers, the first in the British king- 
dom, who came to hear one of their 
number, Sir Oliver Lodge, speak on 
this subject. After a very careful 



20 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



examination from a scientific and 
philosophical viewpoint of this sub- 
ject of the immortality of the spirit, 
Sir Oliver Lodge said, "Already the 
facts so examined have convinced 
me that memory and affection are 
not limited to that association with 
matter by which alone they can man- 
ifest themselves here and now, and 
that personality persists beyond the 
bodily death. The evidence to my 
mind goes to prove that discarnate 
intelligence under certain conditions 
may interact with us." 

Investigations along that line by 
this philosopher and many of his as- 
sociates have firmly convinced them 
of this great underlying doctrine of 
Christianity, the immortality of the 
spirit, or as they express it, the im- 
mortality of the soul. 

There have been many books 
written in recent times upon this 
subject. Professor Schuler of Har- 
vard has a book on the Individual, 
in which he treats upon the persist- 
ency and endurance of this thing we 
call the individual. 

The poet Tennyson exclaims : 

"O human will that shall endure 
When all that seems shall suffer shock." 

Why should not the spirit and the 
body be immortal? They are com- 
posed of immortal elements. There 
is no doctrine better established in 
science than that of the conservation 
of energy ; that energy, coarse, or- 
dinary energy, cannot be annihi- 
lated. And what excuse would 
there be to suppose then that the 
form of energy, the highest known 
to the universe, the individual, 
should ever perish. Matter is also 
imperishable. There is no doctrine 
better established in science today 
than that matter cannot be annihi- 
lated. The particles of which our 
bodies are composed are immortal ; 



they cannot be destroyed. The form 
may be changed, but the particles 
themselves can never be annihilated. 
And it is the promise of the Father, 
as exemplified in the life of the 
Lord and Master, that these im- 
mortal elements shall be inseparably 
connected with the spirit ; that mor- 
tality, that corruption shall be 
clothed upon with incorruption. One 
writer of comparatively recent times 
publishes a book, entitled, "The 
Scientific Demonstration of a Fu- 
ture Life," in which he undertakes 
to prove as a matter of science that 
the spirit survives the death of the 
body. It would not be profitable to 
take your time to go into the con- 
tents of this book by Mr. Hudson, 
a' psychologist of some standing. 
His argument is based upon the 
thought that there are some faculties 
of the human being that do not 
naturally function themselves in this 
life, and his argument is that there 
must needs be a future life for these 
same faculties to naturally function 
themselves. 

We are accustomed to associate 
the manifestations of the spirit with 
the body in which it appears, and it 
is difficult for us to dissociate in our 
thoughts the combination that we 
have been thus accustomed to. 
United States District Judge Cross- 
cup, in an argument some years ago 
with Prof. Haeckel, (who is said to 
be the only materialist today who 
has delved deeply into psychological 
phenomena and not convinced him- 
self of the immortality of the spirit) 
Judge Crosscup says that if one's 
knowledge of the human voice were 
associated only with the telephone, 
if all one's information of the hu- 
man voice, or of singing, had come 
to him by way of the telephone, it 
would be a very natural thing for 
him to associate the human voice 



ELDER REY L. PRATT. 



21 



with the telephone, and for him to 
erroneously conclude that if that 
instrument were destroyed that the 
human voice itself would cease. 
And he says — that it is no more rea- 
sonable to assume that the mani- 
festations of the spirit are thus in- 
separably connected with the human 
body, than to conclude in the cir- 
cumstances supposed that the hu- 
man voice is inseparably connected 
with the telephone. 

Philosophers have gone into the 
question of the relation of the brain 
to thought, and have discussed the 
question whether thought is a func- 
tion of the brain and some have con- 
cluded that if thought can be in any 
sense considered a function of the 
brain it is not a function of the 
brain in the sense that steam is a 
function of the tea kettle, but rather 
it is a permissive function or trans- 
missive function such as these panes 
of glass perform in transmitting the. 
rays of light and heat into this room. 
If the medium is obscured, the 
function will be imperfectly per- 
formed, and yet the window glass 
is not the creator of the light. Be- 
yond the pane of glass is the great 
orb of day, and while this medium 
performs that function, either 
perfectly or imperfectly, according 
to its nature and condition of clean- 
liness, still the sun and not the glass 
is the source of light and heat. So 
the brain is a medium through 
which the spirit manifests itself. 

But I rejoice with you, my 
brethren and sisters, that it is not 
necessary for us to go to the, reason- 
ing of science, or the deductions of 
philosophy for assurance upon this 
subject. It may be of interest, par- 
ticularly to the young who may not 
be as firmly founded in the truth 
as some of the older brethren and 
sisters are. But with the older por- 



tion, they know that the Lord lives, 
that this is His Church, that we are 
His children, that Jesus is the 
Christ, and that He laid down His 
life in redemption of His children, 
and at the same time gave us the 
concrete assurance, that the body 
does not absolutely perish with its 
seeming death, that we can say of 
the apparently lifeless body, "not 
dead but sleeping," and be assured 
that the spirit of man endures, and 
shall endure for all the ages to come. 

May the Lord bless us, and keep 
us in the faith, and in the guiding, 
sustaining and blessed assurances 
which the Gospel gives unto us, is 
my prayer in the name of Jesus. 
Amen.

ELDER REY L. PRATT. 

(President of Mexican Mission.) 

I am happy, my brethren and sis- 
ters, to meet with you today in con- 
ference, and I sincerely trust that 
during the few moments I occupy I 
may have the Spirit of the Lord to 
direct my remarks ; and I ask you 
to give me your sympathy, your 
faith and prayers, that the Lord may 
aid me. I fully realize that to preach 
the gospel to a congregation, be they 
Latter-day Saints or people of the 
world, without the Spirit of God to 
direct, one is unable to preach the 
Gospel in a way that would be in- 
structive, and that would be accept- 
able to our Father in heaven. 

Brethren and sisters, we are truly 
a remarkable people, and this great 
gathering today attests the remark- 
ableness of the Latter-day work, es- 
tablished through the instrumental- 



22 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



ity of the Prophet Joseph Smith. 
The lives of the great body of re- 
ligious worshipers, known as the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints, attest the fact that they 
are a peculiar people, that they are 
not of the world. This is exactly as 
it should be, for the Savior said to 
His disciples, when He labored with 
them, that if they were of the world 
the world would love its own, but 
because they were not of the world 
they were despised by the world. 

Our peculiarity consists in differ- 
ent purposes, in a different outlook 
for the future, in different aspira- 
tions, in different habits in life. If 
we are living up to the professions 
that we make, our lives are cleaner 
and better than those of the world 
that surround us. The Savior said 
to His disciples, when He was with 
them, that if their righteousness did 
not exceed the righteousness of the 
scribes and the pharisees, in no man- 
ner should they inherit the kingdom 
of heaven. The same is true today ; 
with the great knowledge that we 
have of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, 
and with the revelations we have re- 
ceived of the Lord as to how we 
ought to conduct our lives, if our 
righteousness is not greater than 
the righteousness of the people that 
have not received these things, I 
should say, in the words of the 
Savior, that in no wise can we in- 
herit the kingdom of our Father in 
heaven. 

We are living, brethren and sis- 
ters, in a day of the fulfillment of 
prophecy. I will read to you just 
a little from the 24th chapter of 
Matthew. Speaking of the Savior, 
it says : 

"And as He sat upon the Mount of 
Olives, the disciples came unto Him 
privately, saying: Tell us when these 
things shall be? And what shall be 



the sign of Thy coming and of the end 
of the world? And Jesus answered 
and said unto them: Take heed that 
no man deceive you, for many shall 
come in My name, saying I am the 
Christ, and shall deceive many. And 
ye shall hear of wars and rumors of 
wars; see that ye be not troubled, for 
all these things must come to pass, 
but the end is not yet. For nation 
shall rise against nation, and kingdom 
against kingdom, and there shall be 
famines and pestilences and earth- 
quakes in divers places. All these are 
the beginning of sorrows. Then shall 
they deliver you up to be afflicted, and 
shall kill you, and ye shall be hated of 
all nations, for my name's sake. And 
then shall many be offended, and shall 
bestray one another, and shall hate 
one another. And many false prophets 
shall rise, and shall deceive many. And 
because iniquity shall abound the love 
of many shall wax cold. But he that 
shall endure to the end, the same shall 
be saved." 

It is not my purpose to particu- 
larly call your attention to this part 
of the Savior's prophecies that we 
are w itnessing the fulfillment of, for 
many things have occurred, since 
the great war in Europe began, that 
signify the fact, that the great con- 
flict that is going on in the world, 
and the great earthquakes that have 
taken place during our short lives, 
the remarkable manifestations of 
those great calamities in the earth 
directly prove that they are the ful- 
fillment of the prophecies of the 
Lord. I shall, however, during the 
short time that I stand before you, 
call your attention to another part 
of the prophecies of the Lord, that 
pertain particularly to us as a peo- 
ple, and that concern us even more 
than the destruction that is going on 
in Europe : it is contained in verse 
14 of the same chapter: "And this 
gospel of the kingdom shall be 
preached in all the world for a wit- 
ness unto all nations, and then shall 
the end come." 



ELDER REY L. PRATT.

This has been, in some measure, 
fulfilled. This gospel of the king- 
dom has been set up in these latter 
days, with all of the gifts and powers 
that ever pertained to it in any dis- 
pensation in which it has been upon 
the earth, and it has been preached 
in many of the nations of the earth. 
But still there is a great work lying 
before this people in carrying the 
gospel of salvation unto millions 
who have never intelligently under- 
stood the Gospel of Jesus Christ. 
They have believed in false doc- 
trines, and have followed after 
teachers who have taught for doc- 
trines the commandments of men. 
They have not come in contact with 
the sweet spirit that emanates from 
a missionary clothed with the power 
of the holy priesthood to preach the 
Gospel of faith in God, the Father, 
in His Son Jesus Christ, and in the 
atonement, (which was so beauti- 
fully illustrated in the remarks made 
this morning by Brother Hart,) and 
of faith unto repentance, and bap- 
tism for the remission of sin. Mil- 
lions of people have never had these 
things brought aright to their atten- 
tion as the Lord has destined that 
it should be. It is our mission as a 
people, to preach this gospel to the 
world ; and we should enthuse our 
brethren with the desire to carry 
this message to those millions that 
do not know the truth. There are 
thousands of men in this Church, as 
stated by Bishop Miller, that are in 
every way capable of delivering to 
the world the truth in regard to the 
religion that will save them ; there 
are men in this congregation that 
could do this work effectively and 
well. But, are our minds led out 
along this line? are we thinking of 
the great work that devolves upon 
us? are we shaping our affairs to 
that end? I refer particularly to 



members of the Seventies' quorums, 
as they are expected to be minute 
men in the work of preaching the 
Gospel to the nations of the world. 
Are you preparing yourselves, and 
shaping your affairs so that when 
the call comes you can be ambassa- 
dors of life and salvation to people 
that know not the truth? 

This gospel is given to the world 
for the salvation of all mankind, 
providing they will live according 
to its. principles. But, how can they 
belive in Christ of whom they have 
not heard, and how can they hear 
except authorized ministers be sent 
to teach them that Christ is the 
means of salvation to the world ? It 
devolves upon us who have received 
the truth to take it to the world. It 
is not to be taken to one nation only, 
it is to be taken to all the nations 
of the world, according to the word 
of the Savior that I have read here. 
It is a common thing for many peo- 
ple to become narrow-minded. It 
was a common affliction among the 
converted Jews, they believed that 
the Savior's mission was particular- 
ly to them, and they believed that 
outside of them there was no fav- 
ored people of the Lord. It took a 
revelation from the Lord, and a 
great manifestation to Peter to con- 
vince him that the Gospel was also 
to the Gentiles, and that it was not 
for him to call unclean that that the 
Lord had said was clean. My breth- 
ren and sisters, this work is not only 
to the people of the same nation and 
race as ourselves, it is our mission 
to carry this message of salvation to 
all the world. Let us take into con- 
sideration that all mankind are the 
children of our Father in heaven^ 
and all mankind will have, accord- 
ing to the unchangeable decrees of" 
our Father in heaven, the privileges, 
of coming into His kingdom,

through this gospel that we have re- 
ceived. Peter said that he knew of 
a certainty, after he had received 
that great manifestation, that God 
was no respecter of persons, but 
that, out of every nation, he that 
would obey Him, and work right- 
eousness, would be accepted of 
Him ; and that is just as true today 
as it ever was. True it is that there 
are some nations less favored of the 
Lord than others. If you will read 
the history of those people, and the 
hand dealings of the Lord with 
them, you will find that their present 
conditions are a result of their fail- 
ure to receive the Gospel when it 
has been proclaimed unto them, but, 
in every instance, you will also find 
that God's justice has been manifest 
unto the people. This is particularly 
true of the people with whom T am 
laboring, the Lamanites. They have 
been brought to the condition in 
which they are today because of dis- 
obedience in the past. Rut the Lord 
has said He would, in His own due 
time, give them another trial, an- 
other chance. If you will take the 
time to read it, you will discover 
that the word of the Lord should go 
to them, from the Gentile nations 
to bring them back to a knowledge 
of the Christ. 

I do not desire, my brethren and 
sisters, to occupy much more of the 
time this morning ; but I wish to 
emphasize the fact that the Lord 
will fulfill His promises, and that in 
His own way, in His own time, and 
just as is shown very plainly in III 
Nephi, in the Book of Mormon, I 
wish to read a few words to show 
'that the Lord will fulfill all of His 
promises to His children, but He 
will do it in His own way. It is well 
for us to accept the Lord's way. and 
make ourselves willing and ready to 
work in it. 



And now, behold, I say unto you 
that when the Lord shall see fit in 
His wisdom that these sayings shall 
come unto the Gentiles, according to 
His word, then ye may know that the 
covenant which the Father hath made 
with the children of Israel, concern- 
ing their restoration to the lands of 
their inheritance, is already beginning 
to be fulfilled; and ye may know that 
the words of the Lord which have 
been spoken by the holy prophets 
shall all be fulfilled; and ve need not 
say that the Lord delays His coming 
unto the children of Israel; and ye 
need not imagine in your hearts that 
the words which have been spoken 
are vain, for behold, the Lord will re- 
member His covenant which He hath 
made unto His people of the house 
of Israel. And when ye shall see these 
things coming forth among you, then 
ye need not any longer spurn at the 
doings of the Lord, for the sword of 
His justice is in His right hand, and 
behold at that day, if ye shall spurn 
at His doings, He will cause that it 
shall soon overtake you. Wo unto 
him that spurneth at the doings of 
the Lord; yea, woe unto him that shall 
deny the Christ and His works; yea, 
woe unto him that shall deny the rev- 
elations of the Lord, and that shall 
say the Lord no longer worketh by 
revelation or by prophecy, or by gifts, 
or by tongues, or by healings, or by 
the power of the Holy Ghost; yea, and 
woe unto him that shall say at that 
day, to get gain, that there can be no 
miracle wrought by Jesus Christ; for 
he that doeth this shall become like 
unto the son of perdition, for whom 
there was no mercy, according to the 
word of Christ. Yea. and ye need 
not any longer hiss, nor spurn, nor 
make game of the Jews, nor any of' 
the remnant of the House of Tsrael, 
for behold the Lord remembereth His 
covenant unto them, and He will do 
unto them according to that which He 
hrtth sworn. Therefore ye need not 
suppose that ye can turn the right 
hand of the Lord unto the left, that 
lie may not execute judgment unto 
the house of Tsrael." (Ill Nephi, 
29 chapter.) 

How many arc there of us who 
are entirely guiltless of the things 
that the Lord has told in this chap- 



ELDER ANDREW JEN SON. 



25 



ter that we should not do? How 
many of us are entirely guiltless of 
looking down upon the Jews and 
upon certain branches of the House 
of Israel, and how many of us are 
there that do not believe implicitly 
in our hearts that the Lord is going 
to fulfill these mighty and, as they 
look to us, almost impossible prom- 
ises unto those people? 

1 testify to you, my brethren and 
sisters, that this word is true, and 
this book brought forth by the in- 
strumentality of Joseph Smith, is a 
revelation of God unto the world. 
And I testify that I know that 
Joseph Smith was a prophet of 
God. I know that, through the 
power which God gave him, He 
established this Church, and it shall 
not be taken away again, but it will 
go on to perfection, and those who 
do not go with it will be lost, be- 
cause the Church is not going to 
be left to any other people. I 
testify, furthermore, that I know 
that those who have governed the 
Church, and led us up to the pres- 
ent time, have been inspired of God. 
I testify that I have received man- 
ifestations, that Joseph F. Smith, 
who presides over this conference, 
and the Church, at the present time, 
is a man inspired of God, and he 
leads this Church by the inspiration 
and Spirit of the Almighty. When 
I have heard criticism, I have told 
the critics that their criticism will 
bring them condemnation if they do 
not repent. God will not permit His 
servant to guide this Church into 
error, it is going to be guided to 
success. Again I say, Joseph F. 
Smith is inspired of the Lord in 
what he does in the government of 
this Church. May the Lord help 
us to realize our duties in this 
Church, and perform them faith- 



fully, is my prayer in the name of 
Jesus. Amen.

ELDER ANDREW JENSON. 

(Assistant Church Historian.) 

The limited time at my command 
will only permit me to express a 
thought which has come to me while 
the brethren have been speaking to 
us. It may be based upon the say- 
ing of the Savior, when He, in His 
famous sermon on the mount, 
speaks as follows: "Ye shall know 
them by their fruits. Do men gather 
grapes of thorns or figs of thistles? 
Even so every good tree bringeth 
forth good fruit, but a corrupt tree 
bringeth forth evil fruit." 

The successful affairs of this life 
are as a rule made up of happy 
mediums. To illustrate : If a man 
spends his money in a very liberal 
and imprudent way, we call him a 
spendthrift. If he is too close with 
his means, we are tempted to call 
him a miser. We admire the happy 
medium when a man is neither a 
spnedthrift nor a miser. Again we 
sometimes find men who to all ap- 
pearances are too self-important, 
who assume a certain extreme dig- 
nity, which conveys the idea to 
others, that they consider themselves 
better than other people. As a con- 
trast to these we find people who, 
figuratively speaking, crawl in a 
hole, who are 'too modest, who dare 
not assert themselves in anything, 
and who dare not step to the front 
to show their real ability and the 
talent which God has given them. 
These are two extremes which most 
people do not admire. We like a 
man who does not exhibit either of 



26 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



these extremes — who is not too 
modest, nor too much inclined to 
self-assertion. Most of the successes 
which the human race have achieved 
in any of the affairs of life have been 
based on a happy medium. 

The Latter-day Saints are by most 
unprejudiced people referred to as 
a good and honest community. 
Sometimes, perhaps, we may over- 
draw the mark in regard to our own 
virtues and goodness. But true it is 
that we are not the people that our 
enemies claim that we are, when 
they endeavor to paint us black, and 
make us appear real wicked. Per- 
haps at times we go to the extreme 
in doting on and speaking of our 
purity and virtues, for even in that 
regard there is necessarily a happy 
medium and a certain way of get- 
ting at the truth. 

I have given this matter quite se- 
rious attention while I, during the 
past years, and particularly during 
the last few months, have been bus- 
ily engaged in perusing the history 
of the Church, or recording the ac- 
tions of the Latter-day Saints in 
these valleys. I have patiently gath- 
ered together the events of each day 
in regular chronological succession 
from the very day the pioneers first 
arrived in the Valley of the Great 
Salt Lake in July, 1847, to the close 
of the Nineteenth Century, and I 
find this truth proven beyond all 
doubt and beyond every attempt at 
successful contradiction, that there 
has from the beginning been a great 
difference in the general morals of 
the Latter-day Saints when they 
have been alone in these mountains 
and when they have been associated 
with other people not of their faith. 
In other words, the Latter-day 
Saints, ( when they have had an op- 
portunity to regulate their affairs 
according to their own religious and 



moral convictions or practical 
creed), have been far better than at 
other times when they, in a sense, 
have been helpless in the hands of 
others, or associated with more 
worldly-minded and less God-fear- 
ing neighbors. 

From the day of the arrival of the 
pioneers here in 1847 till the month 
of June, 1849, the "Mormons'" were 
alomst alone in these valleys. There 
was scarcely any one here who did 
not belong to the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints. It is 
very interesting indeed to read of 
the good morals and tenets of the 
people as they were reduced to 
practice at that time — a people who 
showed by their actions that they 
were indeed a God-fearing people, 
though suffering with poverty and 
want and beset with very many diffi- 
culties incident to western pioneer 
life. But they were a moral and 
virtuous people. Scarcely an oath 
or anything tending to vulgarity or 
blasphemy were heard in the streets 
of Great Salt Lake City in these 
early days. There was no drunken- 
ness or immoral practices to speak 
of. The vices that try good men's 
souls and which are so detrimental 
to the progress of a moral com- 
munity were almost unknown. 

But in the year 1849, after the 
gold had been discovered in Cali- 
fornia, a certain class of travelers 
commenced to pass through the 
Great Salt Lake Valley. Some of 
these were very good people, who 
not only behaved themselves like 
gentlemen, but who also spoke 
truthfully of the Latter-day Saints, 
calling them an honest and a God- 
fearing people. Some of these trans- 
continental travelers who had lis- 
tened to slanderous reports circulat- 
ing in the East were indeed sur- 
prised to find that the "Mormons"

27 



in the far-off valley of the Great 
Salt Lake consisted chiefly of men 
and women of most excellent char- 
acter and morals. Some of these 
travelers, however, were men of bad 
morals who endeavored to introduce 
vice of a serious nature among the 
Latter-day Saints. Thus, barring a 
few isolated cases, the year 1849 
witnessed the first introduction into 
these valleys of real blasphemy, 
theft, robbery, and other things re- 
pugnant to the feelings of a true 
Christian. 

In course of time, or after the 
lapse of a few years, the evils intro- 
duced into the midst of our people 
by these travelers (who were mostly 
bound for California and Oregon) 
subsided, and the "Mormons" were 
again left almost alone for a season. 
During that period we enjoyed com- 
paratively speaking immunity from 
nearly all the vices prevailing at that 
time in what we generally called the 
outside world, and the "Mormons" 
in. the Great Salt Lake Valley again 
made a record that reads well as 
matters of history at the present 
time. 

These happy conditions, however, 
were overturned to a very great ex- 
tent in the year 1858, when the so- 
called Johnston Army entered the 
Great Salt Lake Valley. There were 
about six thousand American troops 
and upwards of eleven thousand 
camp-followers. Most of the latter 
were men of questionable character, 
and there were also a few women 
whose morals were calculated to 
disgrace any community who would 
encourage their nefarious practices ; 
and yet these same people claimed 
that they came to Utah to teach the 
"Mormons" better morals. The 
complaint had been made against us 
in the East that we were not moral, 
and that we were the opposite to a 



,good people. Hence, these men and 
women, to whom I refer, were sent 
here, or came here of their own free 
will and choice, to introduce a 
higher and better civilization than 
the one which had existed before. 
Without going into details I will 
simply say in this connection that 
for the time being a most wonderful 
change took place in the moral 
status of certain localities in this 
intermountain region, particularly in 
Salt Lake City and Camp Floyd 
where most of the soldiers and 
camp-followers made their head- 
quarters. Quarreling, fighting, steal- 
ing, robbing and killing became 
common occurrences among the 
non-"Mormon" element in these 
valleys. One old settler said, "I 
have now lived in Provo ten years 
and I have heard more blasphemy 
and witnessed more vice in Salt 
Lake City in twenty-four hours than 
I have heard or witnessed all the 
time I have lived in the 'Mormon' 
town of Provo." 

I do not desire to draw an ex- 
treme picture of these changing con- 
ditions. I desire simply to refer to 
facts and present the truth as I find 
it recorded in the annals of a people 
who have ever been known to keep 
good records. Nor do I take as my 
authority "Mormon" statements 
alone, but the statements of other 
honest men and women who were 
not afraid to tell the truth and- to 
speak of things as they found them. 

The Latter-day Saints are by no 
means a perfect people, but what- 
ever may be said in regard to the 
"Mormons" on the one hand and 
the non-"Mormon" element on the 
other, the facts are these that at such 
times when the "Mormons" have 
been almost the sole inhabitants of 
these mountain valleys and have 
lived according to the religion of the 



28 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Latter-day Saints — the principles or 
creed known as "Moimonism," 
which we call the true Christian re- 
ligion — they have excelled in purity, 
honesty and sobriety. We have, in 
other words, fostered a practical 
Christian civilization whenever we 
have been let alone and given liberty 
to show our real characteristics. 

Passing on in my observations I 
will merely state that after the epi- 
sodes of 1858 and the few following 
years most of the soldiers who had 
arrived in the Valley were ordered 
away to participate in the war be- 
tween the North and the South, and 
most of the camp-followers left the 
territory about the same time. After 
their departure we had another sea- 
son of peace, comparatively speak- 
ing, and Christian civilization, in 
which purity of life again played a 
most prominent part. This condi- 
tion continued until the year 1869, 
when the Union Pacific Railroad 
was finished, and with that event 
came the introduction into Utah of 
a civilization of which we have 
never been proud. Then it was that 
we got the perpetual saloon, the per- 
petual house of ill-fame and those 
other perpetual things of evil which 
we often shudder to think of, espe- 
cially when we realize what it means 
as temptations and inducements to 
out young people. 

After a while conditions again 
changed a little for the better. Our 
people succeeding to a considerable 
extent to maintain law and order in 
a mixed community. But then came 
the remarkable year of 1890 when 
the "Mormons" lost permanent con- 
trol of Salt Lake City, Ogden and a 
few other towns. Since that time 
we have had to submit to the pres- 
ence of nearly all the vices, evils, 
and abominations which are cursing 
nearly every large city in the whole 



so-called civilized world. We are 
endeavoring to keep our young peo- 
ple as well as ourselves away from 
evil doing, but in many instances we 
are not as successful as we would 
like to be. 

From the various examples which 
I have quoted from history we can 
judge pretty well of "the fruits of 
the tree." We have had the priv- 
ilege of looking upon the different 
pictures of conditions in the differ- 
ent periods of our territorial and 
state history. We can compare 
notes with conditions when the in- 
habitants of Utah were almost pure- 
ly "Mormon" and when they have 
been mixed with other people. 

While I do not desire to laud my 
people, the Latter-day Saints, to the 
sky as a perfect people, I neverthe- 
less glory in telling the truth. I 
have belonged to the Latter-day 
Saints since I was a little boy and I 
love my people. I cannot feel satis- 
fied to stand silently by always, 
when I witness the wrongdoing of 
those who oppose us and listen to 
the vituperation and false accusa- 
tions which come from the outside 
world or from people who do not 
know us, or. worst of all, from those 
enemies in our own midst who know 
that they are not telling the truth. 
Once in a while I feel like raising 
my voice against the false accusa- 
tions concocted against us and en- 
deavor to make such corrections as 
are within my power. 

Without exaggeration and with- 
out stating anything bordering on 
the extreme the facts are, that when 
we as Latter-day Saints have had an 
opportunity to live by ourselves and 
to regulate our domestic and civil 
affairs according to our belief and 
preferences, we have ever built up 
model Christian communities. On 
the other hand, when we have been 



ELDER SAMUEL O. BENNION . 



29 



more or less in the power and under 
the influence of people opposed to 
us, we have to a greater or less ex- 
tent become mixed up with worldly 
affairs; for with our best efforts to 
steer clear of the "evils and vices in- 
troduced amongst us, we have occa- 
sionally yielded through weakness 
to that which is forbidden in the 
Word of God. 

In conclusion I assert that history 
bears out the fact that the fruit of 
the "Mormon" tree is good, far bet- 
ter than the fruit plucked from the 
so-called up-to-date Christian civili- 
zation which has been introduced 
amongst us from time to time. 
Whenever we have been mixed up 
with outside influences our high 
standard of morals has invariably 
been reduced. 

God bless you, my brethren and 
sisters. May the Lord God, our 
Heavenly Father, enable us to be 
faithful and true to the command- 
ments which He has given us and to 
the teachings of the Savior of the 
world, whom we adore and in whom 
we believe. May we continue to be 
a practical Christian people, and 
while we are at the present time a 
mixed community, let us take a con- 
sistent stand and be determined to 
serve the God of our fathers, remain 
true to our covenants, and ever have 
our eyes and ambition directed to- 
ward the Kingdom of God. While 
others may do wrong, let us en- 
deavor to retain our characteristics 
of purity, honesty and uprightness. 
I ask it in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 

ELDER SAMUEL O. BENNION. 

(President of Central States Mission.) 

I realize, my brethren and sisters, 
what it means, in some measure at 
least, to occupy this position, ad- 



dressing an audience of Latter-day 
Saints, many of whom have 
been reared in the Church, and 
filled missions abroad ; I realize the 
responsibility that attends the 
speaker and the audience together, 
that the Spirit of the Lord may di- 
rect the words of the one who ad- 
dresses them. 

I feel very weak in attempting to 
speak to you this morning, but I 
have been interested in the remarks 
that have been made by the speakers 
at this session of the conference ; 
and though we remain only a few 
moments longer in this meeting, I 
trust we may find it possible to com- 
mune with each other so that we will 
all be edified and blessed. 

I have been interested in the mis- 
sionary work for a good long while, 
and have learned what it means to 
enjoy the Spirit of the Lord. In 
speaking to the public, either to the 
Latter-day Saints or those who are 
not termed Saints, I have found that 
all men are more or less interested in 
religion, if you can get men to gath- 
er their thoughts for a short time, 
and concentrate them upon the 
many gifts and blessings that the 
Lord has given His children on this 
earth. I have never met a man in 
my experience but what wanted to 
be saved, but desired that, sometime 
in the future, he might dwell with 
our Father in heaven. I am re- 
minded always of the words of the 
Savior when He appeared unto 
Mary and told her to go and tell 
her brethren. He told her to touch 
Him not, for, said He, "I am not 
yet ascended to my Father ; but go 
to my brethren, and say unto them, 
I ascend unto my Father, and your 
Father ; and to my God, and your 
God." All men and women in the 
earth are children of the same God, 
and are entitled to His blessings ac- 



30 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



cording to their works ; and as a 
result of their works they will be 
rewarded at some future time. Here 
where we have grown up, the ma- 
jority of the people who belong to 
the Church have, I suppose, been 
born under the covenant, and have 
been familiar with the Gospel of 
Jesus Christ from childhood. They 
have become acquainted with it 
through early instruction, beginning 
in the Primary, then in the Mutual 
Improvement Association, Sunday 
School, etc., and many have gone on 
missions into the world ; it seems 
almost that they were born Latter- 
day Saints. 

I believe that a man's condition 
here is largely the result of his pre- 
existence, a subject which has been 
commented upon a little this morn- 
ing. A person's future will depend 
largely upon his life here. Today's 
condition is largely the result of 
yesterday's actions, and tomorrow 
will be largely affected by today. If 
men and women are inclined toward 
the Lord today, they are pretty apt 
to be that way tomorrow, and so on. 
I have learned that it is very profit- 
able for any man to be a possessor 
of a testimony of the Gospel ; to 
know that Jesus is the Christ, and 
that Joseph Smith was a prophet of 
God : such testimony is a gift of 
God. T have learned also that re- 
pentance is a gift of God, and that 
men cannot truly repent unless the 
Lord gives them the spirit of re- 
pentance. He gives all men the gift 
of repentance who draw near unto 
Him, and desire to forsake evil and 
choose the good. The same gospel 
that was given to man in the days of 
Adam, and in the days of all the 
holy prophets, is here upon the earth 
in this dispensation of the fulness of 
times. 

I am inclined to believe that the 



work of the Lord is nearing an end 
here, and that His work will not 
continue many more years. Accord- 
ing to the time of the Lord, we are 
in the last days, and this gospel must 
be preached diligently. For this 
purpose, more men and women are 
sent into the world today than at 
any other period, and still the cry is 
for more missionaries. There has 
never been a time in the history of 
our missions when there was more 
need of numerous missionaries than 
at the present time. Last summer 
there were four cities in the Central 
States Mission under the ministra- 
tion of only one elder and two lady 
missionaries, all that we could leave 
with them. They traveled from one 
city to another every week, encour- 
aging the people who were investi- 
gating the gospel. There are some 
men in this congregation who could 
go into the mission field, if they 
made up their mind to do it, and it 
would be a splendid experience for 
them, and a blessing to those to 
whom they ministered. I want to 
tell you that no man ever acquired a 
thorough knowledge of anything 
except by experience. He never 
truly acquires a knowledge of the 
advantages of money only as he has 
to toil in earning it. Property that 
comes to a man through inheritance 
is seldom properly appreciated by 
him ; in a majority of cases they lose 
it in a short time. Experience in 
the mission field, at home and 
abroad, is the best kind of training, 
the thing that fastens the gospel in 
the minds of the missionaries till 
they are able to hold fast and walk 
by the light of it. Preaching the 
.'gospel wherever permitted and 
practically living it, is a sure method 
of attaining success. 

The Lord has said, in the 58th 
section of the Doctrine and Cove- 



ELDER SAMUEL O. BEN N ION. 



31 



nants, that "men should be anxious- 
ly engaged in a good cause, and do 
many things of their own free will, 
and bring to pass much righteous- 
ness ; for the power is in them, 
wherein they are agents unto them- 
selves. And inasmuch as men do 
good they shall in nowise lose their 
reward." And so, my brethren and 
sisters, the power is in you and me, 
given by our Eternal Father, to 
every one of His sons and daugh- 
ters, that they may be prepared to 
work in the ministry of the Lord 
Jesus, at home and abroad. We can 
plan for a future experience in the 
mission field, a short or a long one, 
according to our desires. My 
brethren and sisters, it has been my 
desire to impress upon this body of 
men and women that missionaries 
are needed, men of experience. I 
want to say to you that I have never 
seen anyone come into the mission 
field yet but what there is a place for 
him. and there have been people 
somewhere who would listen to him. 
But we need older men than former- 
ly. The time has arrived, I firmly 
believe, when men who have already 
had an experience in the mission 
field are most needed. Experience 
keeps men alive, fresh and able ; de- 
cay results if we get into ruts, drift 
into easy paths, or become inactive. 
I believe that the Lord desires that 
the Priesthood in this Church 
should, every one of them,* be at 
work, at home or abroad ; and I be- 
lieve that all who are able to act as 
missionaries will be called. Joseph 
Smith said that every man who was 
called into the ministry in the world 
was ordained unto that calling be- 
fore the world was. If that be the 
case, they undoubtedly understood 
the gospel of Jesus Christ in the 
pre-existent state. My brethren and 



sisters, in order to obtain the bless- 
ings that have been pronounced 
upon the elders of Israel, those who 
are called will have to use the free 
agency that God gave unto them 
and exercise the power of their 
Priesthood in fulfilling the. require- 
ment that has been made of them. 
The Lord has said that "many are 
called, but few are chosen. And 
why are they not chosen? Because 
their hearts are set so much upon 
the things of this world." Men en- 
gage in business, and lose sight of 
the greater blessings and privileges, 
and the purpose for which they 
came into the earth. 

My brethren and sisters, time will 
not permit me to speak longer. I 
enjoy knowing that I am a Latter- 
day Saint. I value my membership 
in this Church as the greatest pos- 
session that has ever come to me. I 
rejoice in the knowledge that the 
Lord lives, and that Joseph Smith is 
a prophet of God, that this is the 
Church of Jesus Christ, and that this 
people called Latter-day Saints are 
His people. I know that those who 
go down into the waters of baptism 
will be accepted of Him. I know 
that Joseph Smith received the reve- 
lations of the Lord which he said he 
did, and that he received a visitation 
of the Father and the Son, and mes- 
sengers from the heavenly world. 

I humbly pray that the blessings 
of the Lord will continue with us 
each day while we live upon the 
earth, in the name of Jesus. Amen.

The living word of God — The Easter 
Anniversary — Christ's literal resur- 
rection — Evidences of the fact — The 
universal resurrection — Christ's par- 
entage — The Father, a Being of 
Tabernacle — The Holy Ghost a 
"Personage of Spirit" — The Spirit 
of God a boundless essence — Adam 
as the head of our race — We wor- 
ship only the eternal Father. 

I should have been well repaid 
for coming to this conference if I 
had only had the pleasure, that I 
now enjoy, of looking upon this vast 
congregation composed chiefly of 
Latter-day Saints, members of the 
Church of Jesus Christ, which He 
has established in the last days and 
for the last time, but I appreciate 
the privilege afforded me of ad- 
dressing my brethren and sisters, 
and earnestly desire that the 
good spirit which was present with 
us during our morning exercises will 
be with us this afternoon, and that 
I may be inspired by the same spirit 
which was present with us at the 
opening session. 

This morning I felt that we were 
receiving the word of God. We 
have some books which we recog- 
nize as containing the word of God : 
The Bible, composed of the Old and 



New Testaments, and the Book of 
Mormon, and the Doctrine and 
Covenants, and the Pearl of Great 
Price, which we recognize as the 
written standards of doctrine in the 
Church. These contain revelations 
given in the past; some of them in 
the very distant past. But it is 
a great consolation to me and must 
be to all Israel that we have the liv- 
ing word of God today, and that that 
which is spoken under the influence 
of the Holy Ghost is just as much 
the word of God, just as important 
and just as binding upon the people 
of God, as that which was given in 
former times. "Holy men of old 
spake and wrote as they were moved 
upon by the Holy Ghost," so Peter 
declared, and we can say that holy 
men in these latter times have 
spoken and do speak under the in- 
fluence of the same Spirit, and it 
is no less the word of God when it 
is spoken by that divine influence 
than that which was spoken under it 
hundreds of years ago. 

I do not think there was any 
prophet of God in any age of the 
world who brought forth more truth 
and more important truths than 
were revealed through the Prophet 
Joseph Smith. And since his day, 
as necessity has required, we have 
had the word of God through His 
living successors, and I am very 
grateful today for the privilege and 
blessing to live at a time when God 
speaks by the power of the Holy 
Ghost through His inspired ser- 
vants, and when He bears witness 
to the souls of those who will re- 
ceive His word the truth of that 
which is uttered. From my own 
feelings this mor'h'ing I believe that 
the general sentiment throughout 
Cne vast congregation assembled in 
this tabernacle, was, that we had the 
living word of God and it entered

our souls and we felt that we wanted 
to do that which the Lord requires 
of us ; that we were willing to re- 
ceive the instructions imparted by 
the man who holds the keys today, 
just as much as Joseph the prophet 
held them in his time, and as they 
were held by Peter in his time, or 
by any of the prophets of God who 
lived from the beginning. I am 
grateful for this and for the testi- 
mony of Jesus which is in my heart, 
that I know that my Redeemer lives 
and that through Him and by Him, 
if I will observe His laws and keep 
His commandments and be led by 
His Spirit, T shall have the privilege 
of rejoicing with Him in immortal 
glory in the presence of the Father. 

Today is celebrated throughout 
Christendom as the anniversary of 
the day on which Jesus who had 
been put to death on the cross, rose 
from the dead and appeared to His 
disciples, as was related by Presi- 
dent Lund this morning. I hope 
you all heard his brief discourse. If 
you didn't hear every word of it I 
hope you will read it when it is 
printed and published. I take pleas- 
ure in bearing testimony to the truth 
of that which He uttered, and which 
was spoken by the apostles whom 
Jesus Himself, in person, sent out 
into all the world after His appear- 
ance to them. I do not know whether 
this is actually the proper anniver- 
sary of that day, that Sunday 
morning, "the first day of the 
week," when Christ arose from the 
dead and made his personal appear- 
ance to Mary in the Garden, and 
afterwards to others of His follow- 
ers, to demonstrate to them the fact 
that He was living though He had 
been dead. It is not so much the 
time, the day, as the fact which is 
important. 

Is it a fact that Jesus of Nazareth, 



who was taken by wicked hands and 
nailed upon the cross, and crucified, 
and was slain and was buried, really 
rose from the dead? To us Latter- 
day Saints the matter seems so clear 
and plain that we wonder that any- 
body should dispute this, particu- 
larly among any of the so-called 
Christian sects. It is a marvel to us 
that men professing to be Christian- 
preachers will try to make their fol- 
lowers believe that the resurrection 
of Jesus Christ was not a literal 
fact, but that His Spirit merely rose 
from the body and the body went 
to dust like the bodies of all people 
as is generally supposed. Yet we 
read in some of their creeds that 
Jesus "suffered under Pontius 
Pilate, was crucified, died, buried 
and on the third day after, 
He rose from the dead." But if 
the notions that are now being 
taught to the people concerning 
Him are true, then He was raised 
on the day that He was crucified, 
not on the third day ; that His spirit 
left His body after it had hung for 
some hours upon the cross, for there 
He said: "Father, into Thy hands 
I commend my spirit." So we read 
in the New Testament, "And He 
bowed His head and gave up the 
ghost." So that the Spirit of Jesus, 
the Christ, ascended from the body 
while His body hung upon the cross, 
and they took down the defunct 
body and buried it in the tomb pre- 
pared by Joseph or' Arimathea. It 
was on the third day after that 
that He rose from the dead, accord- 
ing to the account which we have in 
the New Testament and which is 
generally received in word by the 
various sects of Christendom. 

Now is it a fact, is there evidence 
and proof that the man Jesus, who 
was crucified on the cross, actually 
rose from the dead and that in His 



34 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



body He appeared to His disciples? 
We believe that with all our hearts. 
We have had additional testimony 
and evidence to that which we read 
about in the New Testament, but I 
will read to you a few verses from 
the testimony of Paul on the sub- 
ject, which I think are important in 
the way of evidence of the actual 
fact of the resurrection of Jesus 
Christ. It is in that remarkable dis- 
course contained in the fifteenth 
chapter of the First Epistle of Paul 
to the Corinthians. That is. that 
which is called the First Epistle, for 
I find in the fifth chapter of that 
epistle he speaks of the former 
epistle that he wrote, on a certain 
very important subject, so that what 
is called "The First Epistle to the 
Corinthians" is merely the first that 
we have. I will commence at the 
first verse. I recommend the read- 
ing of this whole chapter to every- 
body interested in this very import- 
ant subject. A great manv verses 
from it are read usually at funerals, 
particularly by the Episcopal 
Church, and by some of the other 
churches. There are so manv beau- 
tiful utterances in this chapter that 
they ought to be familiar to all peo- 
ple who profess to be Christians. 
Paul commences this chapter in' this 
way : 

"Moreover, brethren. T declare unto 
you the gospel which I preached unto 
you, which also ve have received, and 
wherein ve stand; 

"P>v which also ve are saved, if ye 
keep in memory what I preached unto 
you. unless ve have believed in vain. 

"For T delivered unto vou first of 
all that which T also received, how 
that Christ died for our sins according 
to the scriptures: and that he was 
buried, and that he rose again the 
third day according to the scriptures; 
and that he was seen of Cephas," [that 
is another name for Peterl. "then of 
the twelve: 



"After that, he was seen of above 
five hundred brethren at once; of 
whom the greater part remain unto 
this present, but some are fallen 
asleep. 

"After that, he was seen of James; 
then of all the apostles. 

"And last of all he was seen of me 
also, as of one born out of due time. 

"For I am the least of the apostles, 
that am not meet to be called an 
apostle, because I persecuted the 
Church of God." 

Then we have the Avritten testi- 
mony of the men who are called the 
evangelists, the four evangelists, 
Matthew, Mark. Luke and John. 
Luke was a very fine writer. Tt 
is supposed that he wrote the Acts 
of the apostles. T believe that is 
generally conceded. P>ut we have 
in each of these writings called the 
Gospel of Matthew, and the Gospel 
of Mark, and of Luke and of John, 
distinct evidence given bv persons 
who saw the Savior after His res- 
urrection, and particularly that 
which is given by Luke, which T 
recommend you to read. Read the 
last chanter of "the Gospel accord- 
ing to Saint Luke" for in that we 
are told very definitely, that Jesus 
appeared to His apostles when thev 
were gathered in an upner room for 
fear of the Tews, and "thev were 
terrified and affrighted and sup- 
nosed thev had seen a spirit." Rut 
Tesus said unto them : "Why are 
ve troubled and why do thoughts 
arise in your hearts?" Pehold My 
hands and Mv feet, that it is T. My- 
self, handle Me and see. for a spirit 
hath not flesh and bones as ve see 
Me have." And while thev believed 
not vet for joy. and wondered, He 
said to them. Have ve here any 
meat? and thev gave Him a. piece 
of a broiled fish, and of an honev- 
ro«A \ n d He took it. and did 
eat before them." 



PRESIDENT CHARLES W. PENROSE.

Why did He do that, do you sup- 
pose ? W as it not to prove to them 
the fact that He was there in His 
body, the same body although 
changed in many particulars that 
hung on the cross, for there were 
the marks of the nails that were 
driven through His hands, and 
the mark of the Roman spear in His 
side, which He afterwards showed 
to Thomas and to others. What 
was the object that He had in view? 
Why to show them that He was not 
a mere spirit separated from the 
body, but that He was there in the 
body and that He was raised from 
the dead. Not only did these four 
men that I speak of give this testi- 
mony, but we have the writings of 
Peter, and of James, and here of 
Paul. And Paul wrote of some- 
thing which was well understood, 
evidently, among the disciples, the 
members of the Church then, that 
five hundred of the brethren at once 
saw Him, and knew that He lived 
and that He was in the body, that 
He was a tangible being with flesh 
and bones — not merely "flesh and 
bone" as so many of our brethren 
quote it — but flesh and bones, the 
same appearance of flesh and of 
bones that He had while He was in 
mortality. Paul explains in this same 
chapter, that when the body is 
placed in the grave it is placed there 
somewhat like we sow grain, He 
says, "it may chance of wheat or 
some other grain ; but that which 
thou sowest is not quickened except 
it die." He showed that Jesus' 
body was placed in the grave and 
that He came forth again. As to the 
deceased body he says : "It is sown 
in corruption; it is raised in incor- 
ruption. It is sown in weakness, it 
is raised in power. It is sown a 
natural body, it is raised a spiritual 
body." Further, he declares the 



fact that "Now is Christ risen from 
the dead and become the first-fruits 
of them that slept. For since by 
man came death, by man came also 
the resurrection from the dead." 
The great song of that time was, as 
we heard this morning "Christ is 
Risen!" Hallelujah! Praise to God 
for the resurrection of Jesus Christ, 
for it was the Father that raised 
up Christ from the dead! And in 
writing to the Romans, Paul de- 
clares : "If the Spirit of Him that 
raised up Jesus from the dead dwell 
in you, He that raised up Christ 
from the dead shall also quicken 
your mortal bodies by His Spirit 
that dwelleth in you." (Rom. 8:11). 
Paul also, in writing to the Phil- 
ippians, declares that, "We look for 
the Savior the Lord Jesus Christ" 
to come from heaven, "who shall 
change our vile body that it may be 
fashioned like unto His glorious 
body." (Phil. 3:21). Now then 
as to the resurrection of Jesus 
Christ, the fact seems to be just as 
well authenticated as the fact of His 
death and of His burial. Not only 
do we have these testimonies in the 
New Testament, but we have the 
testimony in the Book of Mormon 
which the Prophet Joseph translated 
by the gift and power of God, giv- 
ing a great deal of the history of the 
dealings of God with the ancient 
people on this continent; and- there 
we read of the appearance of Jesus, 
the Christ, to the Nephites, and He 
showed them His hands and His 
feet and invited them to test and 
prove that He was there in the body, 
not merely a spirit extricated from 
the body, a disembodied spirit, but 
the man Jesus, the Lord Christ 
raised from the dead, appearing in 
His resurrected body. 

Again, we have the testimony in 
our own day of the Prophet Joseph, 



36 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



when a boy, in that first glorious 
manifestation of God to man in the 
19th century. Joseph prayed to God 
in regard to the various religions 
existing in the world; he prayed 
that he might have knowledge and 
light concerning which was the true 
religion ; and we have that beau- 
tiful, simple, striking and touching 
account which you have all read, 
no doubt, when the Father and the 
Son both appeared to him and the 
Father, pointing to the Son, said: 
'This is my beloved son, hear him." 
It was Jesus the Christ raised from 
the dead that appeared to the 
prophet and that spake to him and 
taught him in regard to the fallacy 
of the teachings of men and their 
departure from the faith, and prom- 
ised that the truth should be re- 
stored in its fullness. I need not 
dwell further on that particular 
case. 

But, again, we read in the 76th 
section of the Doctrine and Cove- 
nants that on a certain day men- 
tioned there, Joseph Smith and Sid- 
ney Rigdon, being engaged in the 
work of revision or translation of 
the scriptures, came to a passage in 
the writings of John, and it was 
given to them in a way. a little dif- 
ferent to what it is in the New 
Testament. Jesus, who declared 
Himself, when among His disciples, 
when in mortality, as "the resur- 
rection and the life," saying that He 
had life in Himself, as the Father 
had life in Himself, and that He 
had power to lay clown His life and 
to take it up again. He added: 

"Marvel not at this, for the hour 
is coming in the which all that are 
in the graves shall hear the voice 
of the Son of God and shall come 
forth — they that have done good, 
in the resurrection of life, and they 
that have done evil in the resurrec- 



tion of damnation. (Jno. 5 :28, 29). 

It was given to the Prophet Joseph 
and Sidney Rigdon in this wise: 
"They that have done good, in the 
resurrection of the just ; and they 
that have done evil, in the resurrec- 
tion of the unjust," — quite similar 
in meaning only a little different in 
the wording. But they marveled at 
this, and they prayed, and they de- 
clare that the eyes of their under- 
standing were opened, and thev saw 
the Lord seated upon His throne 
and Jesus the Christ on His right 
hand ; they saw Him in the heavenly 
vision and conversed with Him and 
they said : 

"Now, after the many testimonies 
that have been given of Him this is 
our testimony last of all, that we 
give of Him. that He lives, for we 
saw Him on the right hand of God, 
and we heard the voice bearing 
record that he is the only begotten 
Son of God; that by Him, and 
through Him and of Him the worlds 
are and were created, and the inhab- 
itants thereof are begotten sons and 
daughters unto God." There is a 
great truth in that, which you might 
think about when you have a little 
leisure time, and see how wide and 
extensive a field it opens to view, 
and how it carries you into the deal- 
ings of God and His relationship to 
the beings who inhabit the various 
worlds that He has created ; and 
therein we have a definite revelation 
that the worlds are inhabited, which 
has been a matter in great dispute 
for many years and is so still. 

These are some of the evidences 
and testimonies concerning the 
Savior — that He rose from the dead, 
that He was resurrected, and that 
the resurrection was the raising of 
the body that was crucified on the 
cross, quickened by the power of 
God, by the vital spirit which quick- 



PRESIDENT CHARLES W. PENROSE. 



37 



eneth all things that are quickened. 
The Apostle Paul goes on to reason 
that if Christ was not risen, then 
we will not rise from the dead ; but 
that if He has been raised from the 
dead then we also shall be raised ; 
and he goes on to show how uni- 
versal that resurrection shall be — ■ 
some to come forth in the resurrec- 
tion of the just, and some in the 
resurrection of the unjust, and that 
there are to be different grades of 
glory among those that are resur- 
rected. If you want to learn a little 
more about that, in greater plain- 
ness, read the 88th section of the 
Doctrine and Covenants and you 
will find there something that may 
be called philosophical as well as 
theological. Those that obey celes- 
tial laws will so improve and purify 
and sanctify their bodies that those 
bodies will be fit to come forth in 
''the first resurrection" to celestial 
glory, and that they will then be 
"bodies celestial ;" while those who 
would not receive the laws of God 
which are celestial, that is, receiving 
every word that comes from the 
mouth of God, but will obey a ter- 
restial law, will be quickened by a 
portion of the terrestial glorv and 
receive of the same in a fulness ; 
and, as we learn also in The Vision, 
they will not be bodies celestial but 
"bodies terrestial," a different class, 
but raised from the dead and quick- 
ened by the power of that vital spirit 
which quickeneth all things. And 
they who do not receive the terres- 
tial laws but only the telestial, will 
come forth in the resurrection, 
raised with a telestial body and be 
Quickened by the telestial glory. In 
the revelation that I referred to, in 
the 88th section, we learn that they 
will improve, as all things will have 
to, for progress is the law of the 
universe, and all beings, all intelli- 



gences will have an opportunity of 
progressing along certain lines. 
Those who are of a celestial body 
shall come forth and have a body 
like unto the glorious body of the 
Son of God, and will dwell in His 
presence and be with Him in glory 
in the presence of the Father, while 
those who only obey the terrestial or 
the telestial laws, after they are re- 
deemed will come forth in the way 
that is described, "but where God 
and Christ dwell" — so it is said of 
the telestial — "they never can come 
worlds without end." That may 
answer some queries that are made 
in some of our theological classes. 
Now this all depends upon the res- 
urrection of Jesus the Christ. I say 
Jesus the Christ because that is what 
He was. Some few of our brethren 
get a notion in their heads that the 
Christ is not a person but a power ; 
but Jesus is called the Christ, over 
and over again both in former and 
in latter day revelation ; also He was 
the Logos, the Word of God. Not 
merely a word spoken but He is 
called the Word because the word 
of God came through Him and was 
embodied in Him. In the 93rd sec- 
tion of the Doctrine and Covenants 
you will read His own words about 
it, that He was the Word just as 
John declared; that He came forth 
from God, that He was in the be- 
ginning with God and was the first- 
born. 

Here is another point in the his- 
tory of that great and extraordinary 
Being. I say extraordinary, for He 
is different in many respects from 
all the sons of men : In the first 
place He is called the first-born in 
the spirit world ; He is called the 
first-born here in the Epistle to the 
Hebrews and in Colossians, and in 
the opening chapter of John's dis- 
course or "Gospel" He is called the 



38 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



only begotten son of God, "for God 
so loved the world that He gave His 
only begotten Son that through 
Him man might not perish but have 
everlasting life." Now here are two 
statements about Him, that He was 
the first-born ; He makes that state- 
ment to us in the revelation concern- 
ing Himself; "I also was in the be- 
ginning with the Father, and am the 
first-born." Some people have a 
notion that the first-born was that 
being who afterward was called 
Satan, Lucifer, who rebelled. That 
is a mistake ; Christ Himself puts 
that at rest by stating distinctly : "I 
also was in the beginning with the 
Father and am the first-born. Man 
also was in the beginning with God. 
That which is spirit," that portion 
of man that is spirit "was in the be- 
ginning with God ;" but Jesus, as 
He was called on earth, was the 
first-born and He dwelt in the pres- 
ence of the Father. What was He 
— the Father? No; He could not 
be His own father nor His own son, 
and Jesus was the Son of The 
Father, the Son of the Highest, 
and He was the first-born, and we 
were born afterwards in the spirit ; 
so that Christ was the first-born in 
the spirit. How was He brought 
forth — as an individual, conscious, 
thinking, intelligent spirit with 
agency? Why, He was begotten of 
the Father, and therefore the at- 
tributes of the Father came to Him 
by generation, and so to us, meas- 
urably, every one of us : but on the 
earth He was "the only begotten 
Son of God," born of the Virgin 
Mary. Let me read a verse from 
the description given to us by Luke 
on this matter. It is well enough 
to read all that was said concerning 
Jesus the Christ, because He was 
the greatest of all beings who ever 
dwelt upon the face of the earth. In 



the first chapter of the Gospel ac- 
cording to St. Luke we are told of a 
prophecy made through the father 
of John the Baptist concerning Him 
and we also read there that He 
should be called "the Son of the 
Highest," and that John should be a 
prophet to go before Him and pre- 
pare the way. Now here in this 
chapter we have an account of the 
appearance of an angel to Mary who 
was one of the ministering spirits 
and ladies in the temple. The angel 
appeared to her and hailed her in 
this way : 

"And the angel said unto her, Fear 
not, Mary: for thou hast found favor 
with God. 

"And, behold, thou shalt conceive in 
thy womb and bring forth a son and 
shalt call his name Jesus." [The mean- 
ing of the word Jesus being Savior.} 

"He shall be great, and shall be 
called the Son of the Highest: and the 
Lord God shall give unto him the 
throne of His father, David: 

"And He shall reign over the house 
of Jacob forever; and of His kingdom 
there shall be no end. 

"And the angel said unto her: The 
Holj' Ghost shall come upon thee, and 
the power of the Highest shall over- 
shadow thee; therefore also that holy 
thing which shall be born of thee shall 
be called the Son of God." 

Do you need any plainer explana- 
tion of this matter? This is con- 
sidered to be one of the great mys- 
teries, in the religious world. If you 
understood it just exactly as it is, it 
would not be so great a mystery. 
Believe what is written there by 
Luke, for that is the truth. Jesus 
of Nazareth was the Son of Mary 
and Lie was the Son of God, con- 
ceived by the power of the Holy 
Ghost, as all things are, but not be- 
gotten. Some of our good friends 
who desire to dispute with us, say 
that the "Mormons" don't believe in 
true doctrine, for they do not believe 



PRESIDENT CHARLES W. PENROSE. 



39 



that Jesus was begotten by the Holy 
Ghost. Well, the scripture does not 
say that He was ; it does not say any 
where that He was "begotten of the 
Holy Ghost." The Holy Ghost 
rested upon Mary, but the power of 
the Most High overshadowed her, 
and that which was born of her was 
the Son of God. He was the only be- 
gotten Son of God — not of the Holy 
Ghost — as well as the Son of Mary. 
He "was the first-born in the spirit, 
and as a Son of God the only begot- 
ten in the flesh. Therefore, as I 
said. He is an exceptional Being. 

If you want to read more about 
Him in this respect, take the first 
and second chapters of the Epistle 
to the Hebrews, and the first chap- 
ter of Colossians, that I haven't time 
to read here this afternoon, for I 
don't want to take up too much 
time ; but it is very interesting to 
read there how that He was the 
greatest, that He was the first, and 
so that He might "bring many sons 
unto glory," He was made in all 
points like they are, only He was 
without sin. He had a body fash- 
ioned like theirs ; it was born of the 
virgin ; it was a material body. He 
suffered all the pains and pangs of 
men and women and children ; He 
suffered that He might bear their 
sins and that He finally might die, 
laving down His life voluntarily — 
because He had life in Himself, and 
was raised up by the glorv of the 
Father, so that He had His body 
restored to Him, and in that He 
became in all respects exactly like 
the Father. 

You take the 130th section of the 
Doctrine and Covenants and vou 
will read there that God the Father 
is a being of tabernacle, that He is 
a snirit but that He has a body of 
flesh and bones as tangible as man's ; 
and the Son also ; but the Holy 



Ghost is a pers'onage of spirit, not 
of tabernacle. I want to touch just 
a little on that point and clear up 
some ideas that our brethren have 
in regard to it, which lead them 
sometimes into disputes; they do 
not seem to understand that the 
Holy Ghost, the personage spoken 
of there, is "a personage of spirit," 
and, yet, that the Holy Spirit or 
Holy Ghost — for the words are used 
interchangeably, if not synonym- 
ously — can be "poured out" and can 
be given to a number of people at 
the same time at different places and 
can permeate all things. Now, when 
Jesus was talking with His disciples, 
before His death and resurrection — 
as you read in the 14th and 16th 
chapters of the Gospel according to 
St. John ; (I will not turn to it; you 
turn to it and read it). It is good 
to read the Bible sometimes, breth- 
ren, even if it is "an old book;" if it 
is old it is not antiquated in that 
sense. It is true today as it was 
when it was written. We can un- 
derstand it if we get the same spirit 
in us by which it was written. There 
Jesus says to them : "It is expedient 
that I go away, for if I go not away 
the Comforter will not come ; but if 
I go away I will send Him unto you 
from the Father. When the spirit 
of truth is come, He shall guide you 
into all truth," and so on. Here is 
an individual, a personage, evident- 
ly, that He was speaking about, "a 
personage of spirit" as told in the 
revelation that I quoted from; but 
the Spirit of the Lord, sometimes 
called the Holy Spirit, sometimes 
called the Holy Ghost— because the 
words are used, as I have said, in- 
terchangeably — is an essence that 
permeates all things. 

Take the section <;hat I have- 
quoted to you. the 88th section of 
the Doctrine and Covenants, and! 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



you will read that there is a spirit 
which is called "the light of Christ." 
That is not Christ Himself in per- 
son, but it is the light of Christ; 
"as also He is in the sun and is the 
light of the sun and the power by 
which it was made ; and in the moon 
also, and the light of the moon ; and 
in the stars, and the light of the 
stars ; and in the earth also on which 
ye stand ; and the light which now 
enlighteneth your eyes is through 
Him that enlighteneth your under- 
standing, and is the same spirit 
which enlighteneth the mind and the 
soul and spirit of man ; the light 
which is in all things, which is 
through all things, which is round 
about all things and which is the law 
by which all things are governed." 
In other revelations of God to us, 
particularly in the 29th section of 
the Doctrine and Covenants, you 
will read there that God says, "I 
created all things by the power of 
my Spirit, firstly, spiritual, and aft- 
erwards temporal." All things that 
have life in the world, in the great 
universe of God, throughout bound- 
less space, all things that have life 
are quickened by that spirit, and 
that is under the direction of the 
Father and the Son and the per- 
sonage called the Holy Ghost, and 
it proceeds from the presence of 
God throughout the immensity of 
space. So we are told by the Lord 
Himself. There are three that bear 
record in heaven, John declares in 
the first epistle that he wrote after 
he wrote his "gospel," as it is called, 
"There are three that bear record in 
"heaven — the Father and the Word 
and the Holy Ghost, and these three 
are one ; and there are three that 
bear witness on the earth, the spirit 
and the wa*er and the blood, and 
these three agree in one" (I 
John) ; and as these three are differ- 



ent and separate and distinct, so are 
the other three — the Father and the 
Son and the Holy Ghost — three in- 
dividuals, not one person, not one 
substance, but different individuals. 
They three are the great, matchless, 
powerful, mighty rulers and gov- 
ernors of the universe, and all things 
are under their direction, and they 
three are one, just as Christ prayed 
that His disciples might all be one. 

There need not be any confusion 
in our minds regarding these im- 
portant things. It is important that 
we should know something about 
the Being whom we worship — the 
Father, for it is the Father whom 
we worship. We do not pray to 
the Son nor to the Holy Ghost ; we 
pray to the Father, in the name of 
Jesus Christ, the Son, under the in- 
fluence and guidance of the Holy 
Ghost. When we do that we are 
in accord with the Lord, and we are 
doing that which we are commanded 
to do. If we want to come unto the 
Father, we have to come unto Him 
by the Son. "No man cometh to 
the Father but by Me." Jesus said. 
He is the Mediator. He was so ap- 
pointed ; He is the greatest : He is 
the mightiest of all the sons of God. 
He was the first-born. How many 
ages, millions of ages ago it was, 
when He was the first-born we do 
not know, but that He had a mighty 
and long experience is evident by 
what He declared, that "the Father 
loveth the Son and showeth Him all 
things that He. Himself, doeth." 
That is why He was "in the begin- 
ning," in the creation. The Father 
told Him to go down and do certain 
things. He knew how to do them 
because He had seen the Father do 
them. He is the great eternal 
Christ, the Word of the living God, 
the Son of the Father, the first-born 
of all the children of God that after-

wards tabernacled here on the earth. 
He was not Adam ; Adam was not 
He ; He gave commandments to 
Adam in the Garden. Adam wor- 
shiped the Father, and we worship 
the Father ; we do not worship 
Adam. Adam is the head of the 
race, so far as the temporal body is 
concerned. He is placed at the head, 
as you will read in the Doctrine and 
Covenants in section 107. When 
Adam gathered with his posterity, 
before his departure, in the valley 
of Adam-ondi-Ahman, and there 
bestowed upon them his last bless- 
ing: "the Lord appeared unto them 
and they rose up and blessed Adam, 
and called him Michael, the Prince, 
the Archangel." That is who Adam 
was before he came to the earth in 
his temporal and mortal body: 

"And the Lord administered comfort 
unto Adam, and said unto him, I have 
set thee to be at the head — a multitude 
of nations shall come of thee and thou 
art a prince over them forever." 

But we are not to worship Adam ; 
we worship the same being whom 
Adam worshiped. Adam worshiped 
the Father in the name of the Son, 
as you will see if you will take the 
Pearl of Great Price and read the 
writings of Moses about him and 
about Enoch. Now, my brethren 
and sisters, we adore Jesus of Naz- 
areth ; we adore Him as the Mes- 
siah ; we adore Him as the Christ ; 
we adore Him as the only begotten 
Son of God in the flesh, literally, 
actually. We can understand that. 
We adore Him as the first-born of 
all the creation of God — that per- 
tains to this earth at any rate. But 
He is the revelation of the Father. 
Sometimes He is called both the 
Father and the Son. It does not 
mean that He is actually His own 
father or His own son. He repre- 



sents the Father; "in Him dwelleth 
the fulness of the Godhead, bodily ;" 
He looks just exactly like the 
Father, as the Prophet Joseph saw, 
in the vision. He is the express 
image of the Father. God is man- 
ifest in the flesh in Jesus of Nazar- 
eth, and we adore Him and venerate 
Him, and He is our Savior ; but we 
worship and pray to and obey the 
great Eternal Father of the spirits 
of all men. He is our Father and 
is our God and is Christ's Father 
and Christ's God just as well. 

Jesus Christ died for us. Death 
came into the world through the 
transgression of man. We have the 
revelation of God for that. We need 
not speculate on what there was be- 
fore Adam was on the earth ; it does 
not matter. Death came through 
the fall of Adam and it is called 
"the fall," in the revelations of God. 
Life came through Jesus Christ. "As 
in Adam all die, so in Christ shall 
all be made alive." Christ is risen! 
Hallelujah ! Glory to God in the 
Highest ! The Redeemer, the Savior 
of the world, was raised from the 
dead, and in Him there is life. In 
the beginning He was with God and 
He had life in Him, and that life is 
the light of man and the light of the 
world, and it is His light that shines 
from the sun, and from the moon, 
and from the stars, and is in all 
things and, under the word of God, 
the direction of the Holy One, with- 
out even touching a button the light 
will shine forth, and those who obey 
the laws given to obtain them, can 
receive the blessings and be enlight- 
ened by the power of that Holy 
Spirit as directed either by the 
Father or the Son, or by that per- 
sonage that is called the Holy Ghost, 
who came in power on the Day of 
Pentecost, and came in power on the 
day when the Kirtland Temple was

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



dedicated. His power and His 
presence were there made manifest 
in the same way as on the Day of 
Pentecost. And He is in this 
Church, and is under the direction 
of Christ. The Comforter is here ; 
our hearts are comforted by the 
power of His presence in the midst 
of His people. The Father and the 
Son and the Holy Ghost are the 
Deity ; they are one, and we are un- 
der their direction and they have re- 
stored the gospel, as we heard this 
morning. Praise be unto them, for 
this grand gift. Let us rejoice that 
we live in a day when the Gospel in 
its fulness and purity is restored, 
and we are participants in its bless- 
ings ! 

Every one of us can receive some 
special gift from the Divine Spirit : 
for there are many gifts of the 
Spirit, but it is the same Spirit, only 
one Spirit permeating all things ; 
and the Spirit that gives the gift of 
prophecy, or the gift of healing, or 
the gift of tongues, or the gift of 
interpretation, or the gift of visions, 
and so on, is one Spirit, but these 
are different manifestations of that 
Spirit. The highest manifestations 
are with the Father and the Son and 
the Holy Ghost, for they have the 
very fulness thereof and can impart 
it. In its lower manifestations it is 
here in natural things, in light, in 
heat, in electricity, in the various 
manifestations of that divine power 
which permeates all things and by 
which God created and governs all 
things. We can receive blessings 
from on high and blessings from be- 
neath. Thanks be to the Lord for 
the revelations of the Gospel ! 
Thanks be to God for the gift of 
His only begotten Son who died 
that we might live ! And if we will 
keep His commandments and walk 
in His light and do those things that 



He commands, He will bring us 
forth from the tomb and we will 
come forth with those that are His 
at His coming. He was the first- 
fruit ; afterwards shall be those who 
are Christ's at His coming. He 
knows them and He will call them 
forth; and then, as Job said, "Thou 
shalt call and I will answer ; for 
Thou shalt have a desire to the work 
of Thine hands." Glory be to God 
for the gift of His Son, Jesus Christ, 
who is the resurrection and the life ! 
He will appear to us in "the sweet 
bye and bye," and we will appear 
with Him in glory, if we will walk 
in His ways and keep His command- 
ments and be imbued with His holy, 
righteous, directing, enlightening 
spirit. May the Lord help us so to 
do, for Christ's sake. Amen.

PREST. FRANCIS M. LYMAN. 

Duties of Seventies clearly denned — 
To preach the Gospel abroad, and at 
home — To be preferably selected for 
that purpose — The lesser to assist 
the higher in home missionary labor 
— Duty of all to work diligently in 
priesthood callings— Great revival 
expected in Seventies' work. 

How delighted we have all been 
today in listening to the instructions 
and testimonies of the First Presi- 
dency, and the doctrines that have 
been unfolded to our minds — very 
important and very precious — in re- 
gard to our Savior, on this day 
somewhere near the anniversary of 
His resurrection, near enough as we 
all consider it, all Christian people. 
I feel very grateful that it falls to

my lot to follow my brethren for a 
few minutes upon subjects that are 
very close to our hearts, and that 
belong to us who are the representa- 
tives of our Savior, bearing divine 
authority from Him. I appreciate 
it all the more because there is so 
important a body of our brethren 
right here in front of me, and I 
don't know how long it will be be- 
fore I will have another opportunity 
of speaking to such a body of men — 
the leading brethren from all the 
stakes of Zion and many of the mis- 
sions, and from many of the wards 
of the Church. 

As you have listened so profound- 
ly to the brethren who have already 
spoken, I wouldn't have you forget 
anything that they have said, for I 
shall not be able to say anything to 
compare, possibly, with what they 
have said ; but I do desire of you 
that you will ask the Lord to help 
His servant the few minutes that he 
shall speak, and then I would like 
you to pay particular attention, and 
keep awake, and hear every word I 
say and treasure them up and profit 
by them. I want to read a few 
words from our Savior which are 
found in the 107 Section of the Doc- 
trine and Covenants, commencing 
with the 33d verse ; the Lord says : 

The Twelve are a traveling presid- 
ing High Council, to officiate in the 
name of the Lord, under the direction 
of the Presidency of the Church, agree- 
able to the institution of heaven; to 
build up the Church, and regulate all 
the affairs of the same in all nations; 
first unto the Gentiles and secondly 
unto the Jews. 

The seventy are to act in the name 
of the Lord, under the direction of the 
Twelve or the traveling High Council, 
in building up the Church and regulat- 
ing all the affairs of the same in all 
nations — first unto the Gentiles and 
then to the Jews; 

The Twelve being sent out, holding 
the keys, to open the door by the 



proclamation of the Gospel of Jesus 
Christ — and first unto the Gentiles and 
then unto the Jews. * * * * 

It is the duty of the traveling High 
Council to call upon the seventy, when 
they need assistance, to fill the several 
calls for preaching and administering 
the gospel, instead of any others. 

I desire to draw your attention, 
my brethren, to the fact disclosed in 
these words of the Lord — that the 
Twelve are traveling elders, and 
that the seventies also are traveling 
elders and are expected to join in 
the ministry of the Lord to preach 
the Gospel throughout the earth ; 
and T would like to draw your at- 
tention to the fact that the Twelve 
are now and have always been so 
engaged since they were chosen in 
this generation ; they have been min- 
ute men and traveling elders. 
Though composing the traveling 
presiding High Council of the 
Church, they are always in the field, 
always traveling and laboring. You 
have seen them and you do see them 
from week to week, from month to 
month, and from year to year. They 
come in your neighborhood and they 
assist you in regulating and setting 
in order the affairs of the Church in 
your stakes and wards, and they 
give careful attention to the prepar- 
ation of the elders that are called 
into the ministry abroad. 

Now it is disclosed here that in- 
stead of other men it is required of 
us to first call upon the seventies to 
assist us in the preaching of the 
Gospel ; and we have set a proper 
example by taking hold of the first 
seven presidents, the first council of 
seventy, and you will notice that 
they always travel with us. Have 
you noticed that they go from stake 
to stake as we do, that they labor 
with us, and assist us, and are in 
council with us, and that they give 



44 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



attention to the calling of seventies, 
the organization of quorums, and so 
forth, and preparing the brethren 
for their ministry abroad? Now we 
have latterly been giving a little 
more definite thought to the minis- 
try in the world, a little more definite 
than we have done in the past, and 
we have found this to be the case, 
that other brethren of necessity — I 
want to say of necessity — have been 
called into the field, and they have 
answered the call. The High Priests 
and the elders have generally gone 
into the field, and are today accom- 
plishing the work of preaching the 
Gospel more generally than ought 
to be required of them, for the rea- 
son that the seventies have not been 
called. The reason that they have 
not been called is because they are 
men occupied in all business affairs, 
their hands are full of business of 
all kinds, and they have been ex- 
cused. We have excused them more, 
possibly, than we ought to have 
done, I rather think ; but at any rate, 
we have come to the conclusion it is 
time now that the thousands of sev- 
enties that we have in the Church 
should have the right of way, to 
give them opportunity so that every 
seventy shall go into the field at least 
once and preach the Gospel. If he 
is very suitable and able, and con- 
ditions and necessary circumstances 
such that it is reasonably possible 
for him, he can go twice, and then 
possibly a third time. I remember 
going myself when I was a seventy, 
and I have been a seventy always 
since. I went abroad also when I 
was a high priest, and have gone 
since I was in the Council of the 
Twelve, and have been a minute 
man in preaching the Gospel 
at home all the time, when T have 
been at home. It is quite proper 
that the seventies while they are at 



home should be employed, and they 
are being faithfully and well em- 
ployed at home by the bishops, and 
the presidents of their stakes in 
Zion. It is all right that they should 
be employed there, but we do want 
to come to the time when the seven- 
ties will be preaching the Gospel 
quite generally in the world, every 
man having one opportunity, or two 
or three as the case may be. 

It took me forty years to perform 
my three missions abroad, and the 
balance of my life has been in mis- 
ions at home, before I was in the 
Council and since. I have been in 
the field all the time, like Presi- 
dent Joseph F. Smith, and many 
others of the brethren. We 
have been in the field and there 
has never been a moment but 
what we were minute men and ready 
for the fray. I state this matter 
now, because I want to draw the at- 
tention of the bishops to it. 1 see 
the bishops are gathered here, the 
high councilors, and presidents of 
stakes and so forth, and patriarchs 
in front ; and I would like every 
bishop and every president to bear 
in mind and take home with them 
the spirit of the remarks that I am 
about to make here to you. We 
want you to consider the seventies; 
we want you to look after them ; 
we want you to breathe the spirit of 
their .ministry into them and con- 
sider them when application is made 
for missionaries from your stakes 
and wards. Consider first the seven- 
ties : and as far as they are able and 
can help each other, able to take care 
of themselves, and with what assist- 
ance they can get at home, we want 
them to come into the field. The 
presidents of the missions have been 
asking for them, that is, asking for 
men of experience, men of age that 
have been proven and tried, that 



f RESIDENT FRANCIS M. LYMAN. 



45 



have been in the field abroad or have 
been workers at home. 

We want to put able men into the 
field, now that the spirit is in the 
earth and liberty is being extended, 
and especially religious liberty 
throughout the earth; we expect it 
to be much extended after the war 
is over and peace is declared. The 
Twelve have been out; they have 
been in the world; they have been 
in all the countries of the earth 
pretty near, and have blessed the 
countries and blessed the people and 
prepared the way for the preaching 
of the Gospel. We have had this in 
our hearts and souls for many years, 
and are laboring for it, and we want 
the way prepared ; we want the sev- 
enties that are here in the sound of 
my voice and those other brethren 
that are here, bishops and presidents 
of stakes, to talk upon this subject. 
We want them to get ready and pre- 
pared for the ministry. We want 
them to do what they are able to do, 
and we don't want them discour- 
aged ; for there are many of them, 
although they have business of all 
kinds, and have families and are 
building their homes, and accom- 
plishing wonders at home ; but most 
of them will find the way to go into 
the field and teach the Gospel, and 
they can afford to make some sac- 
rifices. W T e must make some sacri- 
fices and overcome some difficulties 
in order to accomplish what the 
Lord requires of us abroad as well 
as at home, and at home as well as 
abroad. Under the direction of the 
Presiding Seventy, as we have been 
talking to them latterly and consid- 
ering this matter, we desire this call 
and this consideration to go to every 
stake and ward, and to every council 
of the seventies, to councils that are 
complete or not complete. We want 
the seventies to come to the rescue 



and help us in preaching the Gospel, 
and we expect to call upon them in- 
stead of any others. But remember 
that the seventies may not be able to 
monopolize the whole field, hence 
there will be room for elders and 
high priests, and for other experi- 
enced men outside of the seventy, 
and we want them considered also. 
While we have been, for a number 
of years, asking that one experi- 
enced and trained man should be 
furnished for every two of the 
younger men that are sent out, we 
ask now that there be two well train- 
ed and experienced men sent out for 
each young and inexperienced man 
that is sent. We want able and ex- 
perienced men that have been 
abroad, or have been laboring most 
faithfully at home. 

I want to say to the brethren, the 
high priests at home, that we do not 
want them overlooked ; we want 
them considered ; men that have 
been bishops or high-counselors, and 
have held responsible positions and 
had great experience. We want 
them to have opportunity to go 
abroad as well as the seventies ; 
also, we want the balance of the 
room that is to spare abroad occu- 
pied by able elders. We_ prefer that 
you should keep the young men — 
such as deacons and teachers and 
priests — at home and give them 
thorough training in the lesser 
priesthood ; and remember that the 
deacons have a ministry as well as 
the teachers, and the deacons' min- 
istry is that of assisting the teachers 
when occasion requires ; and I have 
always interpreted it that the occa- 
sion always requires it. We want 
these young men given opportunity, 
and we want them employed. We 
want the teachers employed ; we 
want them to accompany the breth- 
ren that are called, the seventies and 



46 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



high priests, and elders that are 
operating as teachers at home. We 
want the teachers of the lesser 
priesthood, and the deacons, to have 
opportunity to visit with them, that 
they may be trained and have ex- 
perience here at home before they 
are sent abroad. You would be as- 
tonished to see the companies of 
young men that are sent to us, inex- 
perienced young men, only recently 
ordained elders in order to go on 
missions. When they give their 
genealogies we find they are teach- 
ers, sometimes deacons and some- 
times priests, that are just ordained 
elders in order that they may go 
abroad to preach the Gospel, — un- 
trained, inexperienced. They should 
work at home and train themselves, 
and be prepared so that as the sev- 
enties are depleted and pass into the 
high priests quorum, at the age of 
fifty or sixty years, and there is 
room there, we want the able, well 
trained and experienced elders to 
fill their places, so that we may have 
seventies enough to take care of the 
ministry abroad, as a rule, the ex- 
ceptions being where we need to use 
the elders and high priests. 

There is opportunity for all 
abroad; and if there is anything 
lacking, and they want opportunity, 
we have it at home, for the field at 
home will never be overstocked with 
men. The high priests and elders at 
home, and the seventies who are 
generally at home, and will be gen- 
erally at home, because they are not 
expected all to be in the field ; a 
thousand or fifteen hundred or two 
thousand on missions at a time will 
leave about eight thousand of them 
always at home, and we want them 
to work at home as well as they have 
been doing. Don't use them any 
less at home, but give them oppor- 
tunities to preach the Gospel at 



home as well as abroad. The able 
and successful bishops, presidents of 
stakes, presidents of seventies and 
of elders, and of high priests will 
furnish employment ; they will ar- 
range affairs and labors at home so 
that there is employment for every 
man who bears the priesthood. 
Every man who bears the priesthood 
is entitled to the right and privilege 
of magnifying that priesthood, at 
home or abroad, and we exhort you 
my brethren who have charge of 
these matters and are appointed and 
ordained for that purpose, we want 
you to see to it that employment is 
furnished every man that you lay 
your hands upon and ordain to the 
lesser priesthood or to the Melchize- 
dek priesthood. Furnish them em- 
ployment at home, and don't be sat- 
isfied with having ten or twenty sev- 
enties doing something, preaching 
the Gospel at home to the strangers, 
to those that are not of our faith, 
but let the whole army of seventies 
at home get into the field, and the 
armies of high priests and elders be 
in the field, every man magnifying 
his calling at home as well as 
abroad. Let that be done. We want 
that to be done and we will not be 
quite satisfied until the brethren can 
report that every member of our 
quorums of the priesthood is doing 
something, accomplishing some- 
thing, and you will be astonished at 
the converts that can be made at 
home. 

There are many reported now 
from various directions, but many 
more will be in a little while, and 
you will be astonished — if you go 
home from this conference and take 
this spirit among the seventies, — 
you will be astonished at the num- 
ber of seventies that will be ready 
at the call and recommendation of 
the presidents of stakes and bishops

of wards, under approval of the pre- 
siding seventy. They are acquainted 
with them as they are with the other 
elders, and they know how to rec- 
ommend them, and to consider them 
and weigh them. You will be as- 
tonished to see how the spirit will 
take hold of the seventies, and they 
will be prepared and ready for their 
work abroad. I want you to bear in 
mind that the body of the Twelve 
are giving careful attention to these 
matters. Every man that goes 
abroad comes immediately under the 
hands of the Twelve and the first 
council of seventies. We bless every 
man and set them apart, and our 
sisters also who go into the field ; 
quite a number of them are being 
sent. We are looking after this mat- 
ter, and we want everybody bearing 
the priesthood, every member of the 
priesthood, we want them to have 
opportunity to magnify their priest- 
hood. 

Take labor upon yourselves, 
brethren, and provide labor for your 
neighbors until every man is cared 
for, every high priest that is now 
careless and unemployed. It is re- 
ported that there are many of the 
priesthood unemployed, not fully 
occupied, not doing any good work 
— nothing is laid out for them. It is 
not every man that knows how to 
employ himself, but every man 
should know how to employ himself 
especially when he has had experi- 
ence, been abroad in the field, or 
laboring at home in important posi- 
tions. These brethren should know 
how to set themselves to work and 
do many things that they are not 
told to do that they discover ought 
to be done, for the inspiration of the 
priesthood should dwell in the heart 
of every man who receives it ; his 
eyes should be opened, his ears 
should be opened, his heart should 



be touched, ready and prepared to 
do some work for somebody ; and 
when you labor for your brother 
you always get the chief reward 
yourself. You may help him some, 
you may do him good, a world of 
good, but there is always greater 
good comes to you who do the labor 
— everyone — and we want that 
fashion followed. We don't want to 
give our entire attention now to the 
seventies, in getting them in their 
field, but we want the high priests 
taken care of, and we want the 
elders taken care of ; for the elders 
are two or three times as numerous 
as are the seventies, two or three 
times as numerous as are the high 
priests. The high priests compare 
about with the seventies, but the 
elders are much more numerous, 
and it will put you to your wits' end 
to find something for them to do. If 
they are idle they are mischievous 
and liable to get into trouble and 
difficulty, and they should be taken 
care of. If they labor, if they work 
day by day and magnify their call- 
ing they will grow stronger and 
stronger unto their perfect day. 

Now I feel delighted with this 
privilege of speaking to this body 
of men, and I want you to remem- 
ber what I have said, in connection 
with what we have heard here — the 
testimonies that have been given us 
by the Presidency today. Bear in 
mind this mission, and the sugges- 
tions and instructions in regard to 
the magnifying of the priesthood 
here at home, and magnifying it also 
abroad. Brother Hyrum M. Smith 
has sent quite a requisition for some 
able elders that can come and labor 
with him, whose conditions and cir- 
cumstances at home will allow them 
to stay until they have finished their 
missions, and that call will be a 
small one comparatively. We want 



48 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



at least one seventy from every quo- 
rum ; we want five seventies from 
every quorum that is able to send 
them ; or seven, that will only be one 
man out of ten, something- like that, 
to go abroad, and the others remain- 
ing at home and helping each other 
when it is necessary. But you will 
be astonished, when you inquire 
after the seventies and look right 
after them, to find the great number 
of them that are able to take care 
of themselves and their families, 
and go and preach the gospel for 
three years and then come home and 
stay six or ten years and then go 
again when they are wanted. 

May the Lord bless you my breth- 
ren. Think of these matters, give 
attention to them, and yon will find 
the presiding seventy around look- 
ing after you and feeling after the 
members of their quorums, and thev 
will be calling upon you and want 
you to consider them. Thev have 
felt just a little bit overlooked. T 
believe the seventies have b°en over- 
looked too much, and we have de- 
pended upon elders, and young men 
and inexnerienced men to go out 
and preach the Gospel in the world, 
and we want all the brethren to have 
opportunity to magnify their calling 
as they are required. You notice 
whenever we call men to preside 
over stakes, or over wards, or over 
quorums, or to go on missions, that 
they are expected to go at once into 
the field, and so it should be with 
every man who receives the priest- 
hood. TTe receives a commission 
from the Lord, and he should take 
hold of it and magnify it to the best 
of his ability, and the Lord will open 
the way for the good that is possible 
for him to accomplish. 

God bless you, my brethren and 
sisters, I pray. Let the spirit of this 
conference go home with you, and 



vou will be astonished what will be 
accomplished within the next six 
months, between now and October ; 
and the presiding" seventies will be 
able to tell us quite a story of what 
is being done in this movement for 
the seventies. May the Lord bless 
vou I pray in the name of Jesus. 
Amen. 

President Smith read several 
notices, and said : 

"Now, I don't want any of you 
to put your hands in your pockets, 
for fear somebody will see you do 
it. but I am requested to warn the 
congregation to look after their 
valuables if they have any with 
them, as we are favored— or un- 
fortunate — to have a large number 
of light-fingered "gentlemen" in the 
city, who are on their wax - to the 
San Francisco Fair, and are look- 
ing out for a chance. Take care of 
your money, and don't show them 
where it is." 

"A Lullaby" was rendered by a 
chorus of ladies, conducted by ^i>ter 
Lizzie Thomas Edward. 

The anthem. "Grant us Peace," 
was sung by the choir, Mrs. Sarah 
L. Wood and James Moncar ren- 
dering the duet. 

Bishop David A. Smith pro- 
nounced the benediction. 

Conference adjourned until Mon- 
day, April 5th, at 10 a. m. 



SECOND OVERFLOW 
MEETING. 

Another meeting of the Confer- 
ence was held in the Assembly Hall, 
at 2 p. m., at which Elder Joseph F. 
Smith, Jr., presided ; and the Cot- 
tonwood stake choir was again in 
attendance.

The service was commenced by 
the Choir singing - , the hymn : 

"An angel from on high, 

The long, long silence broke." 

Prayer was offered by Bishop 
Joseph A. Buttle. 

The Choir sang the anthem, 
"Daughter of Zion." 

ELDER WALTER P. MONSON. 

(President of Eastern States Mission.) 

Words fail to express the grati- 
tude which I have in meeting with 
you, this beautiful Easter Sunday, 
and in experiencing the sweet in- 
fluence which has characterized this 
conference thus far. I have often 
heard, while in the world, the beau- 
tiful hymn : 

"O ye mountains high, 
Where the clear blue sky 

Arches over the vales of the free; 
Where the pure breezes blow, 
And the clear streamlets flow, 

How I long to your bosom to flee." 

Never has that hymn been sung, 
in my hearing, while I have been 
away from the body of the Church, 
but what I have had a longing, a 
yearning for this land which is so 
dear to me. I have often thought of 
St. Bernard who, when he visited 
Switzerland, looked over the beau- 
tiful lakes, and saw the magnificent 
picture that was presented to him, 
how he covered his eyes lest the 
glorious scenes should detract from 
his love for duty, and from the love 
which he bore to his Maker. When 
I come into the vales of these moun- 
tains, and see the snow-capped 
peaks, that are familiar to me, there 
seems to be a necessity for me to 
cover my eyes also, lest the appeal 
should be so strong that it would 



detract from my desire to do my 
duty. I love these glorious moun- 
tains, and more than the mountains, 
I love the people who dwell here. 
More than the people who dwell 
here, even father and mother, houses 
and lands, and wife and children, I 
love that cause which I have been 
sent out into the world to represent. 

Eighty-five years ago this Church 
was organized with only six mem- 
bers, in the State of New York, the 
state where, perhaps, the greatest 
opposition is now prevailing against 
this work, and against this people. 
When we look over our weekly re- 
ports, in the mission field, we see 
there are only few baptisms, if any. 
The elders are plodding along, as it 
were, gleaning from among the 
crowded cities of the world, and 
from country districts, those who 
have a greater love for God than 
they have for their self-ambitions. 
It seems that the progress is not of 
the proportions that our elders 
would like to see it ; arid oftentimes 
an elder will express himself, that 
he cannot see any good resulting 
from his labors. But when we stop 
to consider the report that was read 
this morning by our beloved Presi- 
dent, Joseph F. Smith, and see how 
the Saints have been gathered from 
the various parts of the earth, how 
diligent they have been, not merely 
seeking this world's treasures, but 
how willingly they have laid' on the 
altar of sacrifice much of the means 
they have acquired to come and 
enter the House of the Lord, where 
they have done a magnificent and 
stupendous work for those who have 
gone beyond, those that were less 
fortunate than we. It causes my 
heart to leap with joy to know that 
my parents had the courage and 
fortitude to leave their possessions, 
and everything that was near and 



50 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



clear unto them, and come into these 
valleys of the mountains, where such 
love for truth can bear fruit in the 
hearts of their children. 

I love the people of the Lord. I 
love to see the progress that this 
work is making. Perhaps that can- 
not be seen or counted numerically 
only. I believe that the Almighty 
has anticipated this very condition, 
for we read in the 13th chapter of 
Matthew a statement made by the 
Master, that the kingdom of God 
was likened unto leaven which was 
hid in three measures of meal, and 
which leavened the whole lump. In 
order to measure the success attend- 
ant upon the work of the mission- 
aries in the world, one must under- 
stand what the teachings of sectar- 
ian ministers were about eighty-five 
years ago, in the year 1830, and then 
compare the teachings of the same 
sects and organizations of today. 
If you will turn back the pages of 
ecclesiastical history, you will find 
great speakers whose sermons are a 
matter of record, who taught that 
awful doctrine of hell fire, that un- 
less a person would be willing to 
kneel before the penitent bench, he 
would go into an ever-burning and 
never-ending hell. About twenty- 
five years ago this doctrine began to 
be disowned by the churches of the 
world, and thus it seems that one 
particle of the Gospel leaven has 
entered into the souls of the children 
of men, and they have cast off that 
damnable doctrine. Also, there was 
the doctrine taught that infants, 
whose parents refused to have them 
christened, or baptized, would go to 
a never-ending hell, there, perhaps, 
to serve as kindling for the devil. 
But these things have now been dis- 
carded. I doubt whether there was 
ever a person who has lived upon 
the earth, and who had been called 



upon to lay away a little one from 
its mother's arms, and buried it in 
the grave that ever thought that that 
child went to hell. It is people out- 
side of that relationship who have 
thought that such a little one was 
going to a never-ending hell. The 
love of Christ has more fully entered 
into the hearts of the children of 
men. All are growing nearer to it, 
and even though the people seek to 
destroy the work of the Lord, yet 
these things which God has or- 
dained, these works which He has 
performed, albeit by the slowest 
growth, will stand and endure. Some 
one has said, ''God can make an oak 
tree in a hundred years, and can 
make a mush-room in one night." 
We must reach out to the one hun- 
dred year mark before the wonder- 
ful growth is fully recognized, as 
shown by the testimonial that you 
give in your attendance upon this 
conference, and the love and devo- 
tion you show to the cause. 

In looking through one of the 
large book stores in New York City, 
I discovered a work entitled "A 
Century's Change in religion." This 
has come from the press at as late 
a date as Nov., 1914. It is written 
by one George Harris, a very 
learned divine. There are many 
things contained therein that we 
cannot accept, I may say, as gospel 
truth ; yet there are many things 
which he points out that have come 
about by the evolution of thought, 
and the culling process of truth. The 
author shows how many of the er- 
rors which our fathers inherited 
have been dead and buried for a 
number of years. I desire to read 
an extract from his Introductory : 

"I select this period also because a 
large part of it is within the recollec- 
tion of many now living. Indeed, 
those discoveries and influences which 



ELDER WALTER P. MO N SON 



51 



have, or are supposed to have, brought 
these changes have come upon us 
within the last fifty years. I do not 
mean that religious beliefs and prac- 
tices were stationary for eighteen 
hundred years, or during the first half 
of the 19th century, but that the 
changes of the last fifty years are more 
marked than those, we may almost 
say, of all the time preceding." 

Is it not a remarkable statement 
for a minister to make, that the last 
fifty years has seen greater religious 
advancement than all preceding time 
since Jesus came and ushered in His 
reign. I wonder if we realize the 
effect of the efforts of our humble 
elders in crystalizing these truths 
in the hearts of the children of men. 
Now I will read to you an extract 
concerning a doctrine that has been 
entirely ignored, or ridiculed, by 
most of the ministers of the Chris- 
tian world. It was a startling reve- 
lation to me to know that people in 
the world have so far ran into the 
realm of truth that they are growing 
into the desire to do work for their 
dead : 

"About thirty years ago a curious 
controversy arose, as to the decisive- 
ness of this life. It led to the trial of 
five' professors in the Theological 
Seminary at Andover, Massachusetts, 
who, it was alleged, taught that those 
who had not heard of Christ in this 
life, the heathen, the generations be- 
fore Christ, might, after death, have 
knowledge of Him and repent and be 
saved. A foreign missionary society 
refused for several years to appoint 
as missonaries young men who 
thought it possible that those who 
did not have the Gospel in this life 
might, after death, have opportunity 
to believe on Christ, or who went no 
further than saying that they did not 
know the fate of the heathen. 

"The accused professors argued 
from the universality of the Gospel. 
Christ died for all men, and since none 
can be saved except they believe on 
Christ, it would seem that all men will 
have the opportunity of knowing 



Christ; that if there are any, and there 
are certainly many, who do not know 
Him in this life, they will know Him 
in the intermediate state, before the 
day of judgment. It was thought that 
scripture lends itself to such a hope, 
for an apostle says that Christ, 'having 
been put to death in the flesh, but 
quickened in the spirit, went and 
preached unto the spirits in prison 
which aforetime were disobedient in 
the time of Noah;' and again says, 'For 
unto this end was the Gospel preached 
even to the dead;' and the most 
ancient creed of the Church says, that 
Christ crucified, dead and buried, de- 
scended into Hades, the abode of de- 
parted spirit. 

"The accusers said that scripture is 
emphatic on the decisiveness of this 
life, since it affirms that men shall 
be judged acording to the deeds done 
in the body; that now is the day of 
salvation; and said that the passages 
in Peter are obscure. They also de- 
clared that the 'nerve of missions' 
would be cut, if it were supposed that 
the heathen would have opportunity 
of salvation after death; that is, that 
the motive of missions is the fact that 
the heathen are going down to perdi- 
tion. Other charges were brought, as 
that the professors taught that there 
are imperfections in the Bible; but 
the gravamen of the accusation was 
that these teachers believed and taught 
that there may be a second probation, 
and that such an opinion is very 
dangerous, that men will postpone re- 
pentance to a more convenient season. 

"The Board of Visitors of the 
Seminary, before whom the professors 
were tried, removed one of them from 
office, acquitting four, although the 
evidence was the same for all; the 
case was carried to the Supreme Court 
of Massachusetts; the decision of the 
Visitors against the removed professor 
was declared invalid, on the ground 
that the other Board of the Seminary, 
the Trustees, were not made a part in 
the trial. It is not yet twenty-five 
years since the verdict was given, yet 
it is rather difficult not to realze what 
it was all about. It shows, however, 
how real the unseen world was, how 
intimately related the realms of light 
and darkness were to this world in 
the thought of men." 

Now I wonder where they got 



52 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



that from ! Surely the spirit of 
Elijah has spread out over the 
world, and it is "turning the hearts 
of the fathers to the children and 
the hearts of the children to the 
fathers, lest the earth be smitten 
with a curse." I will read a little 
further : 

"We do not profess so intimate 
knowledge of the unseen world, nor 
affirm positively that this life deter- 
mines the life to come. We do not 
speculate about it, we refuse to be- 
leve that all who have not consciously 
accepted Christ, those cut off in youth, 
those who grew up in vicious sur- 
roundings, those who never heard of 
Christ, are doomed to eternal woe. 
The mercy of the Lord is from ever- 
lasting to everlasting. And now a 
very orthodox writer says, in a book 
published by the American Tract 
Society which is most evangelical, 
and no one protests: 

" 'We repeat with all sacred empha- 
sis the words, ' 'the Gospel was 
preached even to the dead." We note 
the instance that is given, the spirits 
in prison, which aforetime were diso- 
bedient in the time of Noah, that is, 
the spirits of those who perished in the 
flood. We must not dogmatize, 
we need not vainly guess; but 
we may reverently affirm that the Son 
of man is capable of reaching and in- 
fluencing the souls of men on yon side 
of the veil, as well as on this; and that 
in a degree and by means infinitely 
beyond anything that science or faith 
can either dream or discover.' " 

The same writer says : 

" 'The horrible invention of a pur- 
gatory, from which man's enlightened 
conscience revolts, and which the 
Word of God makes absolutely incred- 
ible, has produced a violent reaction 
in modern minds, whereby even the 
idea of Hades — the scriptural idea of 
an intermediate state, where departed 
spirits await the resurrection of their 
bodies — is rudely blotted out, and so 
one of the grandest and one of the 
most fruitful periods of man's educa- 
tion for eternity is an utter blank in 
the minds of most of us. But we re- 
fuse to be robbed of what the Holy 
Ghost saith; whether by the abuses 



of Roman excess or by the violence 
of Protestant reaction. We hold to 
the teaching of Holy Scripture — what- 
ever may be the peril to a narrow 
sectarian type of orthodoxy. There 
is no purgatory, but there is an inter- 
mediate state. And the only glimpse 
we get into that world unseen 
(Hades), reveals to us the Spirit of 
Jesus proclaiming His Gospel unto 
the dead. Here let our authoritative 
teaching regarding the matter begin 
and end, flooding all the world of 
Hades with the light of the Savior's 
presence and the music of his blessed 
voice.' ' 

"I think all will agree that everlast- 
ing punishment is seldom, if ever, 
mentioned in the pulpit now that the 
word 'hell' seldom crosses the lips of 
any preacher. While it is believed 
that a man may be morally ruined, the 
conception is rather of character de- 
based, degenerated beyond hope of re- 
covery, than of acute physical suf- 
fering. The fire that is not quenched, 
the worm that dieth not, are, it is 
thought, figures of corrosion and de- 
cay. The lake that burnetii with fire 
and brimstone for ever and ever is 
symbolic of lost souls consumed with 
remorse. There is nothing more 
dreadful than a ruined soul, a hard- 
ened heart. Character is fixed by 
purpose, and it may be that after a 
time it cannot be changed. Judgment 
is upon character; heaven is good 
character, Christ-like character; hell 
is bad character, selfish, grasping, un- 
sympathetic character." 

Some "Mormon" elder must have 
explained these blessed principles to 
those who were moved upon to write 
such glorious truths. When we see 
the leaven raising the entire lump, 
our hearts are made to rejoice in the 
Holy One of Israel. His work is 
not marked out by that which can 
be seen by human eyes, but it is 
eternal in character, and of univer- 
sal dominion, and will endure 
throughout the ages to come. 

I rejoice in having this oppor- 
tunity of bearing my testimony, my 
brethren and sisters, for I feel that 
I know that God lives. There is no 



ELDER JOHN W. HART. 



fiber of my being that does not re- 
spond in joyous love to God, for 
the light and truth that He has 
given unto me, for I feel that the 
most sacred obligation that I have 
is to see to it that the sentiment 
never enters my heart, "Am I my 
brother's keeper?" The Lord has 
said of His Saints-. "Ye are the 
salt of the earth." No good house- 
wife ever makes a meal of salt, she 
uses just enough to make the meal 
palatable. Your sons and daughters 
out in the mission field, are a 
Sprinkling of salt in the fleshpots of 
the world. O, it causes my heart 
to rejoice to contemplate these 
things. An article from a very 
scholarly writer, says that the word 
"salt" and the word "Savior" came 
from the same root word. You 
now can see the beauty in the pass- 
age with such an explanation, "Ye 
are the salt of the earth" — ye are 
the saviors of the earth. How many 
of us have had it stated in our 
patriarchal blessings : "And you 
shall come forth and stand as a 
savior on Mount Zion, crowned with 
immortality and eternal life !" 

May God bless us with His Holy 
Spirit, that the greater degree of the 
religion of love, which is sure to 
follow the darkness of the exist- 
ing horrible war, may find a rest- 
ing place first in the hearts of God's 
people throughout the world, as 
enunciated by our beloved prophet, 
seer and revelator this morning. 
May God add His blessing to us all, 
I ask in Jesus' name. Amen. 

ELDER JOHN W. HART. 

(President of Rigby Stake.) 

My brethren and sisters, I am 
here this afternoon because I was 
requested to be here. I always pre- 
fer to sit in the audience rather than 



to occupy a place upon the stand. I 
am entirely relying upon the Spirit 
of the Lord to assist me in this posi- 
tion this afternoon. I know that if 
I say anything that will be of in- 
terest to us, or be beneficial, that it 
will be through His help, because in 
and of myself I am inadequate to 
successfully occupy such a respon- 
sible position as has been allotted to 
me here. 

There is a passage of scripture 
that very often comes to my mind. 
It is a passage that I think of a 
great deal, as it seems to me of great 
importance to all mankind: "This 
is eternal life to know Thee, the only 
true God and Jesus Christ whom 
Thou hast sent." In other words, 
if we attain to the greatest blessing 
that is in store for mankind, that of 
eternal life, it is absolutely necessary 
that we gain for ourselves a knowl- 
edge of the Father and of the Son, 
a knowledge of their attributes, of 
their characteristics and of our re- 
lationship to them, as mortals here 
upon the earth. I want to say, my 
brethren and sisters, that the key of 
this knowledge has been restored to 
the earth in this dispensation. It 
has come through the restoration of 
the Gospel to the Prophet Joseph 
Smith. We are fully aware that, at 
the time when this great revelation 
was given unto this young man, 
actual knowledge of the Son of God 
and our Heavenly Father was not in 
existence in the world. There was 
no religious denomination teaching 
the truth concerning those holy 
Beings. Mankind were being taught 
that God, our Heavenly Father, was 
a Being or a something that was not 
tangible, that He had neither body, 
parts nor passions, that He was 
some mythical being that we could 
not and ought not to be able to be- 
hold, or comprehend. I am justified 



54 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



in saying that, at the present time, 
by virtue of this key of knowledge 
coming to earth in this dispensation, 
and through the proclamation there- 
of by our humble elders, who have 
been sent to the world to preach the 
Gospel, the doctrine of a bodiless 
and passionless God, and a throne- 
less heaven, is not so prevalent, and 
the truth is taking the place thereof. 

One of the great testimonies that 
has come under my observation, is 
the change that is taking hold of 
men's minds concerning religious 
principles and doctrines. Great men 
have come forward and advocated a 
principle that borders on the truth 
that has been restored to the Latter- 
day Saints. They have not got it 
from any of their creeds, because it 
is not taught in any of them ; but 
they perceived a glimmer of light, 
and they have put forth their views 
along these lines, and it appears that 
they are approaching a true and cor- 
rect theory and idea concerning 
God, our Eternal Father, and Jesus 
Christ whom He hath sent. 

These wonderful conference gath- 
erings, are also a testimony to me, 
and I do not know where you could 
go in all the world and see anything 
equal to this that is before us today, 
these wonderful gatherings of peo- 
ple from all parts of the earth, we 
might say. ' They have come up here 
according to appointment, to be in- 
structed in the ways of the Lord. 
They have left their labors, their 
business and their worldly affairs 
behind them. They spend their own 
money, and give their time and 
means to come here and hear in- 
structions from the Lord, that they 
may carry them back to the people 
with whom they associate in these 
United States, and abroad also. We 
do not gain converts through hold- 
ing religious revivals, or on account 



of being able to send men into the 
world who have acquired ability to 
preach the Gospel; but we send, 
largely, young boys and girls who 
are inexperienced, and they humble 
themselves before the Lord, and 
carry this message to the world. It 
is through their humility, their 
cleanliness of life, their honesty of 
purpose, that mankind are attracted 
to them, and listen to the truth they 
proclaim. There is no organization 
in the world that conducts its prose- 
lyting along lines like these. They 
would be afraid to send their young 
men and young women into the 
world as we do. I venture to say 
that if they sent such missionaries 
among the Latter-day Saints, we 
would be the cause of their return- 
ing home with their religious views 
largely expanded, at least. 

This work is growing. We can 
hardly comprehend its magnitude. 
In the state of Idaho, where I live, 
there are from seventy to seventy- 
five thousand Latter-day Saints, and 
we are increasing. The influence of 
the Church is being felt ; it is ex- 
tending, results are beginning to be 
known and noticed, and we are glad 
to say that we see and realize good 
coming therefrom. We are doing 
all in our power to maintain the 
good influence of this great work 
that has been entrusted into our care 
in the state of Idaho. We are pro- 
gressing. I can state to you in truth- 
fulness that Idaho, the state of my 
adoption, has today upon its statutes 
the most drastic, honest, clean-cut, 
effective temperance legislation of 
any state in this nation. I want to 
warn those who do not live within 
the confines of that state that, after 
the fourth of next May, if you visit

your possession. I am thankful for 
this. I feel that we have now, to this 
extent at least, been enabled to 
throw safeguards around our young 
people, that they will not have these 
temptations to intemperance placed 
before them, and we will be enabled 
to devote our attention to other lines 
of improvement. We have ample 
opportunity for advancement along 
other lines, but this is a good start. 
I believe, my brethren and sisters, 
that one of the evils we should rem- 
edy in the communities of the Lat- 
ter-day Saints, as well as elsewhere, 
is the vicious forms of dancing. The 
methods and styles that are being 
adopted in that line, in a great many 
instances, are abominable. We who 
hold responsible positions, and have 
received the priesthood of the Mas- 
ter, should exert our influence and 
efforts to eradicate this evil. We 
ought to be as energetic in driving 
all evil things from our midst as the 
Savior of mankind was in driving 
the money changers out of the tem- 
ple. 

I hope and pray that we will be 
enabled to fulfill our obligations in 
these responsible conditions, and 
handle the problems confronting us 
honestly and conscientiously, that 
good may result from our efforts ; 
and mav the Lord bless us to this 
end. May He give us strength to 
do our duty. May He bless us with 
wisdom and understanding, that we 
will be enabled to see and compre- 
hend our duties and thwart the en- 
emv of the souls of our people. May 
His testimony be with us, that we 
mav grow in faith, that we may 
prosper and advance spiritually. 
Mav we gain for ourselves a knowl- 
edge of the Father and of the Son. 
and thereby secure the great bless- 
ing of eternal life, is my prayer, in 
the name of Jesus. Amen.

ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD. 

(President of Northwestern States 
Mission.) 

In the world, where we mission- 
aries are laboring, it becomes neces- 
sary to combat a false and erroneous 
impression that generally prevails 
among the religious denominations 
of today, that by mere lip service 
men can please God, and that by 
simply giving their hand to the min- 
ister who, at the revival, has touch- 
ed their hearts, they have then ob- 
tained religion and have passed to 
salvation ; or, by simply saying that 
they believe in the Lord Jesus Christ 
they then shall be saved ; or who are 
content to lull themselves into a 
sense of supposed security by re- 
peating the words of the scripture, 
that "the blood of Christ cleanseth 
us from all sin." The disposition 
and feeling is, to get this matter of 
religion over and through with in as 
little time as possible. And then the 
religious person thinks he is saved. 
I remember while doing missionary 
work in the city of St. Louis, several 
years ago, reading at the entrance 
of a tent where gospel meetings 
were held, where a man was preach- 
ing healing by faith, as well as ex- 
pounding his views of the doctrines 
of the gospel — a sign which ran: 
"Come and be healed and saved in 
15 minutes." 

There are many in the world who 
believe they can be saved in 15 min- 
utes. They remember the night they- 
were saved. They recall distinctly- 
the hour. Thev have had no experi- 
ences beyond that time. Sometimes 
I have attended these religious re- 
vivals, when the minister has asked 



56 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



those who were present who were 
saved to stand up, and I have never 
yet thought I was able to stand up. 
I remember on one occasion, as was 
usual, of a good sister coming to 
those who were sitting; she said to 
me, "Why, brother, are you not 
saved?" "No." said I, "I am not 
yet. I have been struggling for sal- 
vation, trying to obtain it, and to 
teach others how to get it, for many 
years. I do not know what I will 
do tomorrow, however ; I may lose 
it all then. I understand that 'the 
race is not to the swift nor the battle 
to the strong, but he that endureth 
to the end shall be saved.' " 

I have thought, as we have rather 
criticized the narrow view that some 
take of this matter of salvation, if 
we Latter-day Saints are not more 
or less affected by the same feelings, 
that we, once having received the 
gospel, having been baptized, count 
ourselves in fair condition for sal- 
vation. I discover occasionally, in 
the mission field, those who are 
drifting, claiming they are members 
of the church. They can remember 
that one time they were baptized, 
though sometimes they do not have 
the record of it ; but, just as long as 
they have been baptized, they feel 
that they are in a saved condition. 
I want to say to you. my brethren 
and sisters, not perhaps that you 
need it quite so much as some of 
us out in the mission field, and yet 
1 cannot hell) feeling that, even at 
home, we need to be told that we 
must do more than repent of our' 
sins and be baptized. And what do 
we mean by repenting of our sins? 
We mean that we have forsaken the 
sins we have been guilty of. that 
we do not sin again, that when we 
have thus repented, if we have 
wronged or injured a man or wom- 
an, if we have it within our power 



to repair that injury, that we go to 
them and repair that wrong before 
our baptism will be approved of and 
fully acceptable before the Lord. 
As we have told those who repent 
in the world : "Have you wronged 
a man or woman, from which wrong 
the man or woman is now suffering? 
If so, and it is in your power to go 
to that man or woman and make the 
wrong right, you should do it. I 
believe that is the thing God desires 
of those who accept baptism at His 
hands. 

I had an experience in a northern 
city, a few weeks ago, where two 
physicians offered themselves for 
baptism, a man and a woman — not 
related, though living in the same 
town and following the same pro- 
fession. I concluded, after investi- 
gation, that they were not ready for 
baptism ; so I asked them to defer 
their baptism. T felt impressed, as 
John did, when he said : "Who hath 
warned you to flee from the wrath 
to come? Bring forth fruit meet 
for repentance." That was my spirit 
and feeling toward them. And yet 
our hearts go out and we put forth 
our earnest efforts to bring men into 
the Church, those who are ready and 
prepared. In this case, however, T 
decided to seek the mind and will 
of God. Through prayer and con- 
templation it was revealed to me 
that thev were in sin and transgres- 
sion. And T wrote and told them 
what their sins were, and told them 
that it would be bringing condemna- 
tion upon their own souls to offer 
themselves to receive the holy and 
sacred ordinance of baptism when 
yet in their sins, in their transgres- 
sion and iniquity. The woman is 
repenting, but the man is filled with 
ragr. But everv word that T wrote 
them was confirmed by voluntary 
testimony from those informed

about these people, that they were 
guilty of wrong doing, and were 
seeking to come into this Church to 
cover up their crimes and shield 
them from exposure, while they still 
continued in their sins. 

We are not seeking for men to be 
baptized into the Church unless they 
have truly and sincerely repented ; 
and when they have thus repented 
and gone into the waters of baptism, 
and have covenanted with God to 
serve Him and keep His command- 
ments, I know that their sins are 
forgiven them. I have seen those 
who have sinned and done wrong, in 
their ignorance, repent before God, 
and receive the ordinance of bap- 
tism, and have their whole heart 
changed, and their countenance also 
become like that of a child. It has 
been a matter of astonishment to 
their neighbors and relatives, who 
would say : "What has happened to 
Brother So-and-So? How changed 
he is ! What transformation has 
come over his whole life !" So I 
know there is virtue and effect and 
power in the ordinance of baptism 
for the remission of sins. But we 
must know, as Latter-day Saints, 
that we should not stop here ; we 
have only put on the armor, only 
begun the battle when we have ac- 
cepted the ordinance of baptism, and 
had hands laid upon us for the gift 
of the Holy Ghost, who will teach 
us what else we should do. And 
there is no one thing that we can do 
and gain salvation, as was manifest 
in the answer of the Christ to the 
voting man who came asking the 
Master what thing he should do to 
inherit eternal life, he was like some 
of us who feel after we have done 
one or two things our salvation 
should be granted. Not one but 
many things the Master required of 
him, he answered, "All these have 



I kept from my youth up ; what lack 
I yet?" Many other requirements 
were made of him, which he could 
not meet and we are told that the 
young man went away sorrowing. 
Do you think that you and I will 
have our anticipations of salvation 
in the kingdom of God realized on 
any less terms than were offered to 
this young man ? I tell you nay. I 
tell you that, to receive the ordi- 
nance of baptism, and the laying on 
of hands for the gift of the Holy 
Ghost, is only to put on the armor, 
just to equip us for the battle ; and 
many of us have put on the armor, 
and it is rusty, we haven't done any- 
thing beyond receiving these ordi- 
nances.. As often happens with 
those who are given greater light 
and knowledge, like the self-right- 
eous Pharisee ; thank God they are 
not like yonder poor sinner. Some- 
times we discover that those who 
have entered into a covenant to 
serve God do not live any better 
lives as Latter-day Saints than they 
lived as Methodists or Baptists, and 
this will stand against them as cove- 
nant breakers. We covenanted and 
agreed when we were baptized to 
obey all God's laws, and keep all the 
requirements that He' would make 
known unto us for our perfection 
and salvation. 

Let me name some of the addi- 
tional requirements. Peter enumer- 
ated them in his second epistle, and 
they are appropriate for Latter-day 
Saints today. I don't hope to paint 
any new picture of what we must 
do to be saved, but just brighten the 
old one, or make it a little more 
luminous. I think these conferences 
are splendid occasions for us to 
sweep the cobwebs off from our 
spiritual vision, and think upon the 
things that we agreed in our hearts 
to do when we were received as 



58 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



members of the Church, when we 
covenanted with God to serve Him, 
as we entered into the waters of 
baptism. We remember the price 
our fathers and mothers were will- 
ing to pay for salvation, with what a 
spirit of determination they sacri- 
ficed, when they left all to come out 
of the world to these valleys of the 
mountains, crossing the plains and 
blazing the way to provide more 
favorable opportunities for us to in- 
corporate into our lives the splendid 
things necessary to prepare us to 
live in the celestial kingdom of God. 

Peter said : "And beside this 
[having complied with the first prin- 
ciples,] giving all diligence, add to 
your faith virtue, and to virtue 
knowledge." What is the standard 
of the Latter-day Saints, with re- 
spect to virtue ? You brethren and 
sisters know. You young men and 
young women know, who have been 
taught and reared in the Church ; 
we have learned it from our fatbers 
and mothers, that it would be better 
for we boys and girls to lose our 
lives than to lose our virtue, that 
we would rather die than to be de- 
spoiled, or despoil any of the daugh- 
ters of God. This is the standard 
that has been fixed for us, and it is 
not a double standard : the boy must 
live just as pure and innocent in his 
life as the girl whom he would ac- 
cept as his wife. We have not al- 
lowed one standard of morality for 
one class, or one sex, and another 
for another. There are those in the 
world, and I think some of them 
may be here, who seek to wrest the 
scriptures, and seek to justify them- 
selves in departing from the path 
of rectitude and virtue. Tt is some- 
what common for people to pretend 
to think that the old law has passed 
away, the law that said, though shalt 
not commit adulterv. But the es- 



sence of the law has not passed 
away, though a higher one has 
come. Jesus not only said, "Thou 
shalt not commit adultery," but "He 
that looketh upon a woman to lust 
after her hath already committed 
adultery in his heart." 

I tell you there is a terrible wave 
of immorality sweeping over the 
world, stalking abroad in high 
places and in low places, affecting 
not only the single but the married, 
not only the married men but the 
married women. I wonder if Zion 
can stand unscathed by the influence 
of that wave. It will come, if it has 
not come already to you, and you 
must beware. Do not take too much 
for granted from your sons and 
daughters. Do not mistrust them, 
but yet live so close to them that 
you do know the very secret 
thoughts of their hearts, and the 
trend of their lives. Hold sacred 
the duty to do everything you can 
to prevent the loss of human souls, 
for this wave will sweep before it 
to death and destruction those who 
do not hold themselves clean and 
pure in thought, in their hearts, and 
in their lives. 

I want to tell you, if Zion shall 
succeed in preserving this genera- 
tion from the damning influences of 
immorality and licentiousness, the 
world will yet say of the member^ 
of this Church, who survive the 
tremendous influences and forces 
that are seeking to push the people 
of the whole world into the pitfalls 
of sin, greater things to their honor 
than anything they have yet said 
about our fathers who founded a 
commonwealth, and made the desert 
blossom as the rose. We are still 
in the struggle to establish a new 
order of things in the world, a new 
race of men ancf women, whose 
hearts and intents are clean and 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD. 



59 



pure. We are here to fulfill the 
words of one who said that we must 
live so that if our -hearts were dis- 
closed, turned outside in, it would 
not show a single stain of sin ; that 
we should give our name and word 
to no document or agreement that 
we would not be unwilling for the 
angels to attest as witnesses ; that 
we should walk, unseduced, through 
life, within arm's length of that 
which is not ours, and nothing be- 
tween us and the gratification of our 
desires, but the indomitable law of 
rectitude, and stand forth in the 
world as pure and clean as if we 
were in the presence of God Him- 
self. This is what we should strive 
for, and it is the standard of virtue 
that we must attain. I must tell you 
that the men or women who think 
they can go into the sacred temples, 
and receive the blessings there to be 
obtained, can commit sins of this 
character, and escape the conse- 
quences will come up missing when 
they meet the examination that men 
and women will have to pass before 
entering into the kingdom of heav- 
en, for no unclean thing can go 
there. And so we have to struggle 
with this power that is aimed at 
frail humanity. 

And then we are to "add to our 
virtue knowledge." You know we 
believe in knowledge. "The glory 
of God is intelligence" was one of 
the favorite sayings of the Prophet 
Joseph Smith ; and we believe in 
study, we believe in learning. We 
are not afraid to investigate any- 
thing ; but I believe that every boy 
and girl, before they go away from 
home to school, and especially be- 
fore they go out of our own circles 
into the world elsewhere, should 
gain for themselves an undying tes- 
timony that God lives, and that 
Jesus is the Christ ; that the gospel 



is indeed the very truth of God. 
Men must have a true measuring 
rod to determine whether knowl- 
edge which comes to them is true 
or false. They must have a true 
balance or rule that is always re- 
liable, always dependable, by which 
they can weigh or measure every 
particle of information that comes 
to them. What will this rule be? 
I have discovered that the sure ac- 
tion of my soul is the knowledge I 
have that God lives, that Jesus is the 
Christ, and that our Father in heav- 
en has spoken, that those truths con- 
tained in the revelations of God in 
the Bible, Book of Mormon, and 
Doctrine and Covenants, are the 
very eternal truth. I have accepted 
them as my measuring rod, and I 
have not accepted as the final truth 
anything that does not square up to 
those eternal truths, that does not 
harmonize with the truth I have 
from God. Truth will harmonize 
with itself. Let us adopt this stand- 
ard when we go out into the world, 
and seek the world's knowledge, its 
science, and everything pertaining 
to the world and the world's work, 
and we shall be saved from ship- 
wreck. 

We have heard from our child- 
hood that the day would come when 
the Latter-day Saints would be the 
leaders of the world. I proclaim 
to you that within one hundred 
years, and perhaps before that time, 
the men who will be standing in the 
very vanguard in directing and 
piloting the world's thought, knowl- 
edge and power, shall come from 
the Latter-day Saints. Any people 
who are possessed of the truth w< 
have, who will live up to the doc- 
trines we have received, will come 
to be the light of the world, I don't 
care who they are, they will come 
to the top just as sure as the sun 



60 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



shines. So we are not afraid of 
true knowledge. 

And we are to "add to our knowl- 
edge temperance." I thank God that 
Idaho where so many of us live can 
say, as Brother Hart has just ad- 
vised us, has taken a great step in 
adopting prohibition towards an end 
so dear to the heart of every Latter- 
day Saint. We have received in the 
Word of Wisdom the higher law of 
temperance, and it is after all the 
thing that is necessary to be secured, 
to eradicate out of the hearts of 
men the spirit and disposition to 
drink intoxicating liquors. We be- 
lieve that it is necessary for man- 
kind not only to abolish the saloon, 
but we should abolish the very de- 
sire for it, we should spurn the de- 
sire for strong drink, crush it out 
and destroy it, that it may not con- 
taminate our souls, that we transmit 
to our posterity no longing for that 
which will defile their bodies. What 
a shame that some of us do not ap- 
preciate the blessed heritage we 
have received from our fathers and 
mothers, who a generation Or two 
ago, left these things in the old 
world, and banished them from 
their lives. We know that the eye 
of the world is turned on Utah, and 
the "Mormons." We have told 
them of our high standard of tem- 
perance, and that we believe in pro- 
hibition. Many of them have been 
watching us. We have told them 
we would be true to the cause and 
destroy the whole damnable evil. 1 
can't tell you how our hearts sank, 
and how we were shocked to know 
that when, apparently, we had it 
within our grasp to clear the balance 
of our state, the opportunity has 
slipped. I hope you will not aban- 
don the cause, that you will espouse 
it so loyally that you will get it next 
time, and make it just as strong as 



Idaho has. In the meantime, we 
stand for temperance in all things. 

This is the time for men to repent. 
You will discover that there are ap- 
petites and desires to conquer, and 
this life is the molding time ; this is 
the plastic age, and the material well - 
tempered ; and when fashioned we 
become brittle and hard. It will be 
difficult for us to change the old 
vessel when it is once moulded. Let 
us see to it, while the material is 
pliable, we incorporate into our lives 
those precious truths that our bodies 
may be beautiful to look upon, and 
we will love them, that we will de- 
sire to receive them again, and that 
they will not be to us a hideous 
monument, but full of all goodness 
and beauty. 

We are to "add to our temperance 
patience." , Do you think that one 
though he has lived up to all these 
other requirements of the gospel, 
but. when mad rage strikes him, 
yields to the wiles of the evil one, — 
is a fit subject for the celestial king- 
dom of God? Do you suppose our 
Father in heaven will allow a scene 
like that in His presence? I tell you 
such a one will go outside, and stay 
there until he has acquired control 
of his temper, until he has mastered 
his viciousness. We must have pa- 
tience with ourselves and patience 
with others, and not try to make 
everybody else measure up with our 
standard. We will discover there 
are those who will set us an example 
in some things, while we can set 
them an example in others. 

"Add to your patience godliness." 
Godliness, we know, is cleanliness 
and purity, not only outside but in- 
side. 

"Add to godliness brotherly kind- 
ness and charity." If you want to 
know what true charity is, read 
what Paul says, "Charity vaunteth

not itself," "desireth no evil,'' and 
so forth. 

O, my brethren and sisters, there 
is work yet for me and for yon to 
do. I do not want to make it appear 
that it is not possible to accomplish 
all this. It is, and I want yon to 
understand that not one single re- 
quirement that has been made is 
non-essential. The men or women 
who' become candidates for celestial 
glory must come np to these re- 
quirements, or they will not get in. 
James said, "He that keepeth the 
whole law, and yet offendeth in one 
thing is guilty of breaking all." 
What did he mean? He did not 
mean that the man who broke only 
one commandment was in the same 
condition as the one who did not 
keep any, but that when he had kept 
all except one he was not able to 
attain celestial glory until he kept 
the other requirement. For instance, 
it is necessary that specific things be 
compiled with in order to produce 
electricity, and if we neglect one 
particular item, do you sunpose we 
will o-et electricity? No. We are as 
though Ave had not done anything 
so far as final results Right] is con- 
cerned ; although we had done nine 
things required, and yet lack one. 
So I say to you that not one of the 
gospel requirements is non-essential. 
Thev are not given out of caprice 
of the mind of Jesus, they are eter- 
nal truths, just as eternal as the 
heavens are eternal, and as the law 
of gravitation is eternal ; we must 
observe them if we will gain celes- 
tial glory. 

Confucius said that those who 
know the truth are not as great as 
those who love it. I would like to 
paraphrase his words, and say that 
those who know the truth as we do 
are not as great as those of us who 
love it and obey it, for "he that 



knoweth the Master's will and doeth 
it not shall be beaten with many 
stripes." I do not want the 
Latter-day Saints to lose their op- 
portunity. Shame upon us Latter- 
day Saints if it can be said, truth- 
fully, that in the Christian Scientist 
church a more beautiful spirit pre- 
vails than among the Latter-day 
Saints. While I recognize that the 
Christian Scientists make a hobby 
of this doctrine of brotherly love, it 
cannot and should not be said that 
there exists more brotherly love in 
that church than with the Latter- 
day Saints. Suppose the Seventh 
Day Adventists, who have copied 
from us the doctrines of the Word 
of Wisdom, should set us an exam- 
ple in the matter of abstaining from 
intoxicating liquors, tea. coffee and 
tobacco, shall we who have received 
these laws from the Almighty, long 
before our advent friends adopted 
them, submit to being outdone in the 
matter? If the doctrine of tithing 
is adopted by other churches, shame 
upon us, who have received the 
word of God upon this matter, and 
know it to be divine, if we shall 
allow them to outdo us. We shall 
have to live the Law of Enoch be- 
fore we get into the celestial king- 
dom of God. You know, the 
Prophet Joseph stated that the law 
of tithing was a school master to 
bring us to live that higher law. I 
am sorry that many of the Latter- 
day Saints have not come up to the 
requirements of the school master. 
How shall we attain salvation ex- 
cept we can be honest It is just as 
necessary that a man shall be abso- 
lutely honest as it is that he shall be 
baptized, to obtain the celestial king- 
dom of God. 

My brethren and sisters, we are 
here reaping the reward of our 
former labors, and we are going 



62 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



hereafter to reap the consequences 
of our lives and works here. We 
know, from the doctrines that we 
have received, that men and women 
have existed before coming into this 
life, for countless ages, and that we 
have been developing certain qual- 
ities, and the reason we are separ- 
ated into great classes, as the Negro 
race and the other races on the 
earth, is not a matter of caprice. 
God did not take three beautiful 
children yesterday morning, and say 
to one, You go to the Negro wo- 
man, and to another one, You go to 
that Chinese mother, and to another, 
You go down to that beautiful 
Christian home. In my opinion, 
there were classes and races, and 
separation into different groups and 
conditions before we came to this 
world, and all are getting what they 
are entitled to receive here. But 
tin's is as far as we will travel to- 
gether, for after this life, some will 
get a celestial glory, and some a 
terrestrial glory, and some a telestial, 
and we will no longer journey in a 
great class, or in a great company, 
made up of all classes. I believe 
that, while there will be classes in 
the spheres to which we will belong, 
we shall be grouped on separate 
planets. If we comply with all re- 
quirements we will be prepared to 
go into the highest places for fur- 
ther advancement, and that is 
celestial glory, and it is gained by 
obedience to celestial law. The 
celestial abode will be upon this 
redeemed earth, for God has de- 
clared that it will fulfill the purpose 
for which He has created it, and 
it will no longer need to have the 
light of the sun by day nor moon 
and stars by night, but will have 
power to emit its own light. Tt shall 
be the home of those who overcome, 
and who have kept the law. and 



who have measured up to all the 
requirements. 

Thank God, there is a chance for 
those who struggle and do the best 
they can ; we come up and offer 
ourselves as candidates for admit- 
tance, and are found wanting, in a 
few things, there is a chance to 
become perfect. I tell you, we will 
have to examine ourselves, and we 
will be examined, and see if we are 
fit, and many will be turned back 
again and again until they do be- 
come perfect in all that God has re- 
quired. Some of us may fail en- 
tirely, and will lift up our eyes in 
sorrow, in the terrestrial or telestial 
w orld, beholding the celestial world 
and not able to enter it. Where 
will these be? I think, perhaps on 
Jupiter, or some other planet, when 
this glorious orb shall shine as a 
resplendent sun. It may be that 
they will look up and say, Yes, I 
was born in that place ; it was my 
privilege to stay there, but I have 
lost it. We will know then the full 
meaning of those words : 

"Of all sad words of tongue or pen, 
The saddest are these, It might have 
•been." 

"I might have been there, and I 
am not !" O, my brethren and sis- 
ters, let us struggle that we may at- 
tain the celestial glory. But, we 
cannot get there by lip service. It 
is a life's business, and then a con- 
tinuation of effort, and a continu- 
ation of struggle. But, O, it is 
worth it. It is worth ten thousand 
times more than has been required ; 
and we would never cease our ef- 
fort, if* we once had the taste of 
that joy that belongs to those who 
come into the presence of God. I 
am willing to give my all of means, 
heart, mind, and sacrifice to attain 
it.

We teach the doctrine that "as 
God is man may become." Not that 
all men will become what He is, but 
may become; how may we? By 
obedience to these requirements. 
While men will grow in the telestial 
and terrestrial kingdoms, they never 
can attain the perfection, felicity, 
and development of those who en- 
joy the celestial glory. If we get 
into that glorious place, we have got 
to walk in the light as He is in the 
light. And after all we have done, 
it will still be by the grace of God 
that we enter, and we will then cry 
unto Him, and blessed are we, if 
His answer is, "Thou hast been 
faithful over a few things, I will 
make thee ruler over many." If He 
will only name my poor name, and 
say. "Of me thou hast not been 
ashamed, come into the joy of thy 
Lord," I shall have my heart satis- 
fied, and feel repaid ten thousand 
times for all God has asked me to 
do. 

God give us the strength to be 
more faithful six months from to- 
day than we are now, and to ac- 
complish those things that He has 
required. Amen. 



ELDER RICHARD W. YOUNG. 

(President of Ensign Stake.) 

My brethren and sisters, I should 
esteem myself and yourselves, my 
audience, very happy indeed if I 
might be able to address you under 
the impulse of that same power and 
spirit, and intelligence that so far 
has controlled and dominated this 
meeting. It is always a great pleas- 
ure to me, and no doubt to you and 
the Latter-day Saints as a whole,, to 
have the privilege of attending these 
our annual and semi-annual confer- 
ences of the Church. In these great 



assemblies are we permitted to listen 
to the testimonies and receive the 
benefit of the instructions, and to be 
roused by the enthusiasm of the 
brethren who so ably, and by ap- 
pointment, preside over the destinies 
of this the Church of God. And not 
only is this privilege accorded us ; 
but by reason of the fact that we 
come together in great numbers, 
fired with the same desires, enter- 
taining the same belief, we receive a 
renewed enthusiasm and power, 
spirit and determination with refer- 
ence to the gospel and our participa- 
tion in the labors pertaining there- 
unto. 

It is always a great pleasure to us, 
(I undertake to say behind the back 
of President Smith that which I 
would not say before his face) — it is 
always a great pleasure to us Latter- 
day Saints to have the privilege of 
listening to our matchless leader. 
We are great admirers, we who 
know President Smith, of his splen- 
did intellect. We have sat many 
times under the potent influence of 
his oratory, — potent, in my humble 
judgment, by reason of his sincerity, 
by reason of his knowledge, by rea- 
son of his uncompromising faith, by 
reason of his mastery of the English 
language, by reason of his versa- 
tility of thought and idea. We have 
all listened time and again with the 
most unspeakable pleasure and the 
most immeasurable advantage and 
benefit to his sermons. This is one 
of the great privileges accorded us 
in attending these conferences. Not 
least among the privileges that we 
have on these occasions is listening 
to the powerful testimonies of the 
brethren who preside in the missions 
of the Church. They are filled with 
enthusiasm. Their knowledge of 
the Gospel has been kept bright by 
exercise. Their armor is not rusty.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



We all learn from them and from 
the power and influence that accom- 
panies their speaking" of the great 
advantage that there is and would 
be to us to labor constantly in the 
work of God. If we would have that 
spirit which they enjoy, the spirit 
which we had when we labored as 
missionaries in the field, it is only 
necessary that we, like them, should 
devote our whole time and attention 
to the Gospel. Of course this is not 
possible to the great majority of us. 
But still we may conclude that we 
would receive a great accession of 
faith and of power by increasing our 
attention, and by multiplying our 
labors in the great cause of truth 
and righteousness. 

It is my design to address you 
only for a very few minutes. Time 
would not permit that I should speak 
longer. I find my text in the words, 
or the idea at least (I cannot recall 
the precise words) of President 
Smith in his opening address this 
morning. The Latter-day Saints, 
he said, are a charitable people, filled 
with the fie si re to benefit and to save 
the world, and not to do the world 
injury. That is truly a characteristic 
of the Gospel of the Lord Jesus 
Christ. We could not claim that this 
is the Gospel of Jesus Christ, if it 
were not a gospel filled with love 
and characterized by charity. If 
ours were a doctrine of hatred, if 
ours were a doctrine inculcating the 
spirit of persecution, then we would 
not be walking in tne footsteps of 
our great and illustrious Exemplar, 
the Son of Man. We thank God 
that the history of the Church, the 
history of the Latter-day Saints, is 
not marred by any sentiment or by 
any act of oppression. Thank God 
that throughout the history of the 
Latter-day Saints, there has been 
evidenced a love of mankind, a de- 



sire to bless and to benefit and to 
save, rather than a disposition to 
oppress and to constrain those who 
are not of our faith. Oppression 
would be entirely inconsistent with 
our views respecting God, our rela- 
tion to God and our relations to each 
other. We could not believe as we 
do, that in the beginning we existed 
with God ; that we are in very fact 
the children of God ; that we are 
literally brothers and sisters ; that 
we will be saved, all of us, according 
to our faith and to our works. We 
could not believe, as has been point- 
ed out, that those of us who might 
fall by the wayside, or falter in this 
world, will have an opportunity in 
the next world of accepting the 
truth, and of advancing on to salva- 
tion. We could not believe that 
every soul that has been born into 
the world may become eventually, 
through endeavor and the things ac- 
complished, divine in his power and 
attributes, — I say we could not be- 
lieve all these glorious and humane 
truths, and then persecute and de- 
spitefully use our fellow creatures in 
this world. It would be absolutely 
inconsistent in us to oppress those 
who fail to believe as we believe. 
They have within them, as we have, 
not only a divine origin but the. 
spark of divine potentialities. 

Thank God, we do not share the 
conception that has marked the ages 
of the past, and to a large extent 
reaches down to the present day, 
notwithstanding the evolution of re- 
ligious belief in the past 100 years, 
that a large part of these sons and 
daughters of God have been fore- 
ordained to eternal destruction and 
damnation. I can well understand 
why those who entertain such per- 
verted ideas of religion, who assert 
that we are foreordained, do what 
we may, to encounter the condemna- 



ELDER JOSEPH E. SMITH, JR. 



65 



tion of God and to suffer irretriev- 
ably throughout eternity, would be 
inclined to judge us without charity 
or consideration. It would seem to 
be quite natural for such believers 
to exclaim: "Inasmuch as God has 
foreordained the condemnation of 
this people, well then let them be 
damned." I say, thank God that 
such charity destroying views and 
delusive doctrines have no part in 
the faith of the Latter-day Saints. 
Looking upon all mankind, those 
not of our faith as well as those that 
have come within the fold, as being 
of the same fatherhood, as brothers 
and sisters, with the prospect of sal- 
vation ahead of them, we would be 
sadly illogical if we were not filled 
with love and with charity, and a 
desire to help. 

And so, throughout the history of 
the Latter-day Saints, we have not 
been the persecutors ; but rather the 
persecuted. We have not been the 
oppressors ; we have been the op- 
pressed. We have not been the 
libellers and the slanderers of our 
fellow men ; we have suffered from 
those offenses. As it was in New 
York, so it was in Kirtland, — we 
were the persecuted. When we went 
into Missouri, where thousands of 
our members, owners of the soil, 
were dispossessed of their property, 
it was the same ; and so when we 
were driven out of Nauvoo without 
offense upon our part. In this state, 
you may search the statutes from 
the time the state of Deseret was 
organized, before the creation of the 
Territory, and you will search in 
vain for one statute that ever dis- 
criminated in the least degree 
ag'ainst those who were not of the 
faith of the Latter-day Saints. We 
who have lived in this state have 
seen men who have slandered the 
leaders of this people, who have said 



and printed of them the most de- 
spicable things, who have accused 
them of unchastity, of dishonesty 
and of all of the crimes in the cata- 
logue, we have seen those men live 
in peace in our midst and walk these 
streets absolutely without harm or 
molestation. And you know who 
have come from the west and the 
north, and from the east and the 
south, wherever our people have 
ever lived, that those who have 
charged these things against us and 
have done all manner of things to 
destroy us, you know that we have 
treated them charitably, that we 
have not sought to return evil for 
evil, but rather, following the ex- 
ample of Christ, that we have sought 
to return good for evil. I say I 
thank God that we are a charitable 
people. I thank God that we soon 
forget the offenses of people against 
us. We have elevated into the high- 
est political positions in this state 
men who in other days have been 
among the most uncompromising of 
our opponents. In the charity of 
our hearts, we have forgotten all 
that they have done in the past. 
Thank God that we do not desire to 
injure others, but rather to bless 
them. 

Now may God help us so to live 
that as a community and as individ- 
uals we may grow in grace and in 
the things of God, and be finally not 
only saved but exalted in His pres- 
ence ; which I ask in the name of 
Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER JOSEPH F. SMITH, JR. 

Ashamed that Utah is not yet a prohi- 
bition State — Church authorities advo- 
cate temperance, and desire prohibi- 
tion. 

The time is spent. It is not my 
purpose to detain you ; but I desire 



65 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



to say, in conclusion of these ser- 
vices," that I endorse the remarks 
that have been made here by our 
brethren, and trust that they will 
find an abiding place in the hearts 
of those assembled here. And I 
wish to say to Brother John W. 
Hart, that while I am very much 
chagrined, humiliated and ashamed 
of the condition that prevails in the 
State of Utah, not because the peo- 
ple so willed it, I am proud to know 
that the State of Idaho and the State 
of Colorado and the State of Ari- 
zona, and the States of Washington 
and Oregon, in this Rocky Moun- 
tain region and the Pacific Coast 
have set an example that is worth}' 
to be followed. And just one more 
word. The remark has been made 
that whispering is being indulged 
in to some extent by some of the 
people to the effect, that the author- 
ities of the Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints do not want 
prohibition, and I think I am in a 
position to say, that the authorities 
of the Church, the Presidency, and 
the Council of the Twelve, stand for 
temperance, and they do want such 
prohibition. Those who declare to 
the contrary, when they come to 
you, tell them that they speak that 
which is not true. And I think I 
know what I am talking about. 

I do not wish to make any more 
remarks because the time is spent. 

A selection, entitled, "A Perfect 
Day,"' was sung by a male chorus. 

The Choir sang the anthem, 
''Grant us Peace," Ada Russell and 
Manasseh Smith rendering the 
duet. ' 

Elder W. D. Kuhre pronounced 
the benediction. 



OUTDOOR MEETING. 

A meeting was held in front of 
the Bureau of Information, at 2 
p. m. Elder George F. Richards 
presided, and the 17th Ward choir, 
conducted by James H. Neilson, fur- 
nished the music. 

The Choir and congregation sang 
the hymn : "How firm a founda- 
tion," etc. 

The opening prayer was offered 
by Elder Benjamin Goddard. 

The Choir sang the hymn, "Jesus, 
I my cross have taken," Bessie S. 
Rex rendered the solo part. 

ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS. 

Faith of Saints manifest by very large 
attendance at Conference — Vital im- 
portance of religion — Compliance with 
Gospel ordinances repugnant to the 
worldly — All the truth of all religions 
embraced in "Mormonism" — God's 
mercy and justice evidenced in plan of 
salvation for the dead. 

My dear brethren, sisters, and 
friends, — we regret exceedingly that 
we have not a building sufficiently 
large to house all of the people who 
•have come up to this Temple Block 
today to worship the Lord, and that 
so many have to stand during our 
service. I do believe, though, if we 
will try and concentrate our minds 
upon the things of God and His 
kingdom, having a desire to worship 
Him in spirit and in truth, that we 
will be able to stand the fatigue ; 
and, through our faith, receive from 
the Lord that which will encourage 
and comfort us, and build us up in 
our faith. 

The large Tabernacle is filled to 
overflowing ; perhaps ten thousand 
people are assembled there. The 
Assembly Hall is filled to overflow- 
ing ; perhaps between two and three

67 



thousand people there, and, as you 
can see, a large concourse of people 
here. It all reflects credit upon the 
Latter-day Saints, and interest on 
their part in the work of the Lord. 
Those who had the privilege of at- 
tending the opening session of' our 
conference this morning, held in the 
large Tabernacle, and heard what 
President' Joseph F. Smith had to 
impart by way of instruction, and 
report of conditions, will surely have 
no doubt in their minds as to the de- 
velopment of this great work, its 
growth and progress in the earth. 

I have great joy and satisfaction, 
my brethren and sisters, in my re- 
ligion, my membership in this the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints, having the assurance 
that this work is the work of God, 
the power of God unto happiness 
and joy in this life, salvation and 
eternal life in the world to come. 
The principles and ordinances of the 
Gospel, which we have embraced as 
Latter-day Saints, are amply sus- 
tained by the scriptures. Those who 
have made an investigation, un- 
biased and thorough, will be con- 
vinced of this fact. 

There is a great satisfaction in be- 
ing right. There is great disap- 
pointment in having been wrong 
upon any question ; and the more 
important the question, the greater 
the satisfaction or the disappoint- 
ment, as the case may be. There is, 
my friends, no question of greater 
moment to the children of men than 
religion, the plan which God has in- 
stituted for the salvation of His chil- 
dren. I am thoroughly convinced 
that the time will come when all the 
problems of religion will be unrav- 
eled, and when that day comes, 
great will be the comfort of those 
who have been right, and great in- 
deed will be the discomfiture of 



those who have been wrong upon 
this important question. 

When God placed man upon the 
earth and shut him out from His 
presence, and required him to live 
by faith, He did not leave him with- 
out evidences of the existence, the 
power, and the love of God. Those 
evidences are so many, and so potent 
that those who> reject God and His 
existence are excluded from those 
who will receive salvation in His 
kingdom. "He that cometh to God 
must believe that He is" (Heb. 
11:6). 

There is a class of people in the 
world, and they are very numerous, 
who are willing to accept God ac- 
cording to their own conception of 
Him, His existence, and of the im- 
mortality of the soul of man, who 
are not willing to accept of certain 
principles and ordinances of the 
Gospel necessary for their salvation, 
such as repentance from sin, the ne- 
cessity for it as a condition of salva- 
tion, baptism by immersion in water 
for the remission of sins, the laying 
on of hands for the gift of the Holy 
Ghost — these and other ordinances, 
and the necessity for their being ad- 
ministered by one whose authority 
God recognizes. When the time 
comes when all things will be under- 
stood, if it shall prove true as the 
scriptures teach and as we believe, 
that these principles and ordinances, 
as well as faith in God the Eternal 
Father, and in His Son, Jesus 
Christ, are necessary to salvation, 
how much better off will we be who 
have accepted these great truths 
than those who have rejected them ; 
and if it were possible to be other- 
wise than true, would we not still 
be as well off as they, and if true we 
would be infinitely better off, we 
would have the satisfaction of hav- 



68 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



ing been right upon this great ques- 
tion. 

At any rate, we, as Latter-day 
Saints are on the sure side, as we 
have all that others accept of truth 
and many more truths, principles, 
and ordinances than they have. In- 
deed, this work which we have es- 
poused, commonly known as "Mor- 
monism," embraces all truth and all 
good. There is no truth or good 
that is not included in our religion, 
and there is nothing but truth and 
good included in it ; and these facts 
will be known to the world of man- 
kind in time, if not at the present. 

If it shall prove true, my friends, 
as the scriptures teach and as we be- 
lieve, that the Gospel is the plan 
which the Lord instituted from the 
foundation of the world, by which 
men can be saved in His kingdom 
and presence, and there is no other 
plan, and that it is the plan by which 
all men are to be judged, and that 
justice demands that it be taught to 
the dead as well as to the living, and 
that the ordinances which are neces- 
sary for the living are also neces- 
sary for the dead, what a satisfac- 
tion it will be when these things are 
known generally to those who have 
accepted of them. On the other 
hand, what a great disappointment 
it will be to those who have rejected, 
and how much better off we will be 
who have built temples and main- 
tained them at such cost, who have 
procured at great cost and effort the 
genealogies of our dead, and have 
gone into the temples of the Lord 
and performed these ordinances for 
them ! I say, what a satisfaction it 
will be to us, and what a disappoint- 
ment it will be to those who have 
rejected these principles. 

If it shall prove true, as we be- 
lieve, and as the scriptures plainly 
teach, that a worthy man and woman 



joined together as husband and wife, 
under solemn covenant for time and 
for all eternity, that union solemn- 
ized in the Temple of the Lord as He 
has directed, by the authority which 
he has delegated to men, and 
those relationships maintained and 
recognized in the life beyond, 
and that they shall have eter- 
nal increase in the kingdom of 
God, — and that all other unions will 
not be so recognized, — what a satis- 
faction it will be to those who have 
accepted this divine truth, this great 
hope, and have yielded obedience un- 
to it, and have been true and faithful 
in the keeping of their covenants ! 
On the other hand, what a great dis- 
appointment it will be to those who 
have rejected these scriptural and 
divine truths ! 

My brethren, sisters, and friends, 
we find that the Latter-day Saints 
are on the safe side of this great 
question from any angle that we 
may view it. Is it then to be won- 
dered that when men come among 
us, and women too, proselyting, that 
they do not convert the Latter-day 
Saints to their faith, their creeds and 
denominations ? Is it a wonder that 
our missionaries who have been in 
the field by thousands, yes hundreds 
of thousands, at different times, 
have not been converted in the world 
by men who have been schooled for 
the ministry? Is it a wonder that 
hundreds of thousands of men and 
women in the world, honest and con- 
scientious, have yielded obedience 
unto these principles, forsaking all 
that their former faith, or creeds, 
had to offer to them? Or is it a 
wonder that there are today, as there 
are, thousands of men and women 
who have come among us, not for 
religion's sake, many of whom, by 
investigation of these truths, have 
become converted, convinced, and 



ELDER GERMAN E. ELLSWORTH. 



69 



have turned away from their former 
faith, and adopted the true faith, the 
Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ? I 
say it is no wonder. The promise is 
that the truth shall be understood by 
the true individual, he whose heart 
is true before God, if he will seek 
with honest heart and purpose to 
know the truth, shall find it. "Seek 
and ye shall find." .By yielding obe- 
dience unto the commandments and 
the requirements of the Gospel, fol- 
lowing the dictates of his conscience, 
he may obtain eternal life, and 
through obedience and faithfulness, 
he may know while yet in life, that 
his course is approved of the Lord, 
and that it will bring to him a re- 
ward of eternal life. 

I bear you my testimony, as a wit- 
ness for the Lord this day, that T do 
know that these are the truths of 
God, that this Gospel is indeed the 
power of God unto salvation, and 
exaltation, unto all who will obey 
faithfully its precepts, and there is 
no other plan instituted by the Gods 
for the salvation of the children of 
men ; in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 

The choir sang the hymn, "True 
to the faith." 

ELDER GERMAN E. ELLSWORTH 

(President of Northern States Mission.) 

My brethren and sisters, I rejoice 
in having the privilege of mingling 
with you in this General Conference 
of the Church. I enjoyed, beyond 
measure, the instructions and the 
spirit of our morning session, and 
the words of President Smith 
wherein he said that the members 
of the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints are at peace with 
themselves, and there was no spirit 
of contention one with another 



within the Church. We have no 
power over the world except by the 
power of love, and we have no right 
to operate in any other way than 
in the spirit of love and kindness, 
the spirit of long suffering, and of 
gentleness toward our fellow men, 
for that is the Spirit of the Re- 
deemer, our Lord and Master. 

I was touched with his counsel, 
too, and I reflected on what we find 
recorded concerning the counsels 
of Adam, when before he left this 
earth, he called his sons and grand- 
sons, and all the generations that 
lived in his day, around him and 
gave them information concerning 
the things that he knew of God his 
Father. The knowledge that Adam 
possessed concerning his Father was 
handed down to his sons, his grand- 
sons, and great-grand-sons, and 
possibly many other generations. 
Those who lived in the days of 
Adam were acquainted with their 
fore-fathers, and possibly lived in 
the presence of many generations, 
and a knowledge of God was un- 
derstood by them, and many of them 
kept the commandments of the 
Lord. 

From time to time, during the 
days of the prophets of old, the Lord 
revealed Himself unto His chil- 
dren, and His attributes and His 
loving kindness were known among 
the children of men. On one oc- 
casion, when He was about to de- 
stroy the cities of the plains, we are 
told that one of the prophets 
pleaded with Him not to do so, ask- 
ing for the privilege of going and 
gathering out those who were 
honest, saying if he could find fifty 
righteous, would He spare the cities, 
and later if He would spare the 
cities even if he found but ten right- 
eous. And the Lord said His 
mercy would be extended toward 



70 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



them providing he could find these 
few righteous. In the days of Noah 
the Lord's patience and long-suf- 
fering toward the wicked lasted 
one hundred and twenty years, even 
after He gave the revelation to 
Noah to build an ark. The knowl- 
edge of our Heavenly Father was 
handed down by the prophets of the 
Lord from generation to generation 
until the coming of His Son, Jesus, 
into the earth, Jesus became a rev- 
elation of His Father to the chil- 
dren of- men, through all time there- 
after. Divine mercy was shown by 
the Almighty through His Son com- 
ing and ministering among men in 
the flesh, showing by His works 
among them, by His gentleness, 
kindness and long-suffering that the 
Father loves His earthly children. 

I rejoice in the spirit that was 
proclaimed this morning is possessed 
by the Latter-day Saints ; that their 
mission in the earth is one of peace, 
and the proclamation of peace even 
with the olive branch. All men must 
hear the Gospel of peace, and be 
judged thereby; not only hear the 
sound, but have in their hearts a 
knowledge of God, our Father, and 
comprehend His love toward the 
children of men. Latter-day Saints 
believe that very few men in the 
earth can commit the unpardonable 
sin, because they do not have knowl- 
edge enough concerning God. The 
sin for which there is no forgive- 
ness is the sin against light and 
knowledge. Men and women 
throughout the world, tens of thou- 
sands who now take sides against 
the Latter-day Saints, do so because 
they have no knowledge concerning 
that which has been revealed to us 
from the heavens. If they knew as 
we know, concerning the revelations 
of God our Father, they might be 
just as valiant for the truth, and 



just as zealous in proclaiming it as 
the Latter-day Saints themselves 
are. 

I rejoice to be associated with the 
young men and young women of 
Zion, your sons and daughters, who 
have been sent into the world with 
the olive branch of peace, to make 
friends with the world, to win their 
hearts in every way that is right, 
that thereby we may teach them 
the great things that our Father has 
revealed in this day and time. After 
the crucifixion of the Savior and the 
putting to death of the prophets of 
the Lord, and the true knowledge 
of God having departed from the 
earth, He has been merciful in these 
the last days in restoring anew the 
Gospel of Jesus ; not only restoring 
the Gospel, but revealing His own 
character, and the character of His 
Son to the. children of men. All the 
knowledge given to Adam, Abra- 
ham, Moses and the prophets of old, 
has been renewed in this day, 
through the coming of the Father 
and of the Son. It has been given 
to the Latter-day Saints to pro- 
claim to the world that God lives, 
that Jesus Christ is His Son, and 
that the love of God shall yet cover 
the earth as the waters cover the 
mighty deep. The knowledge of God 
shall spread upon the earth until 
every man who is seeking the truth 
may have the privilege of hearing 
and obeying it, working out salva- 
tion for themselves, and for their 
fathers and mothers who have gone 
before, and transmitting that knowl- 
edge to their posterity. 

I rejoice, my brethren and sisters, 
in the gathering of the Latter-day 
Saints, in these semi-annual con- 
ferences, and the quarterly confer- 
ences, and ward conferences. I be- 
lieve the day will speedily come 
when there will be some other feat-

ures connected with the Latter-day 
Saints gathering together, that used 
to be among the Saints of old. We 
make records of our dead ancestors, 
and transmit them to our posterity ; 
and I believe we will incorporate 
into our associations the spirit that 
was in the hearts of the prophets of 
old, and record the stories of our 
fathers, grandfathers and great- 
grand-fathers for the benefit of our 
children, that they may transmit it 
to the generations that follow. As I 
have already stated, Adam trans- 
mitted the knowledge of God to his 
posterity, and taught them all things 
concerning the purposes of God. In 
like manner, I believe we should 
teach our children the history of our 
parents and grandparents, and all 
relatives in whose presence we have 
lived ; and also teach them to trans- 
mit the same to their children, that 
the knowledge of our fathers may 
go to our descendants by word of 
mouth as well as by record. The 
Latter-day Saints have received a 
revelation from God, in this day, 
which is in harmony with the reve- 
lations that were given to Adam and 
the prophets of old, that God is our 
Father, that Jesus Christ is His Son, 
the only begotten of the Father in 
the flesh. 

To the Latter-day Saints has been 
given an understanding of the 
knowledge concerning God that was 
imparted to Adam. We are living 
in the dispensation in which this 
knowledge has again been revealed ; 
and I believe that we should trans- 
mit this important information to 
our children. God has been merci- 
ful and kind to us. It is a wonder- 
ful thing to have sounded in our 
ears, by the very men who stood in 
the presence of God the Father and 
His Son Jesus Christ, that we are 
His children, that God is in very 



deed our Heavenly Father, and 
Jesus is our Elder Brother. The 
world does not believe this, and sci- 
entific men, men of great worldly 
learning, have spent their lives in 
trying to prove some other way to 
account for the existence of man in 
the earth. 

I am glad, my brethren and sis- 
ters, that I know my father was a 
good man, and my grandfather like- 
wise. I am acquainted with some 
of their attributes and virtues, and 
some of the things they tried to do 
in the world. I know something 
also concerning my ancestors be- 
yond my grandfather, and what 
good things they tried to attain in 
life. That information ought to be 
transmitted, I think, to my children. 
A record of all the virtues of our 
forefathers should be transmitted to 
the children of men who now live 
and will live hereafter in the earth, 
that the good influence thereof 
might be passed on until the time 
when Jesus shall come to reign 
among His children here upon the 
earth, and dwell with the men and 
women who have worked for the 
building up of the kingdom of God. 
A doctrine that has been revealed 
in this day is that works should ac- 
company the faith of the Latter-day 
Saints ; not preaching, only, but 
building houses of worship, and 
temples : gathering genealogies, and 
histories. Seek and find all that we 
can concerning those who have gone 
before, and transmit all that is of 
value to our children, that they may 
do the work that our Heavenly 
Father has declared should be done 
in this day. 

I rejoice in the spiritual growth 
of the young men and young women 
who have been sent to the Northern 
States Mission. I rejoice when a 
testimonv of the Lord comes to them

in defending the faith, and greater 
love for the work of God comes into 
their hearts, and that the doctrine 
of peace, preached this morning, 
takes possession of them. If I ask 
them concerning the city where they 
labor, they can tell you there are 
many honest-hearted people in it, 
good men and good women, and 
they do not wish to be taken away 
from these cities, at least they do 
not want the judgment of the Lord 
to come upon them : they would 
plead with the Lord for the privilege 
that the city be saved. They desire 
to gather out the honest in heart, 
and teach them that God our 
Father, in this day has revealed 
again concerning His character and 
the character of His Son, and has 
restored the Gospel with lall the 
power that has ever been given to 
men in the earth for the winning 
of the souls of men, and for teach- 
ing men who they are, and what 
they are in the world for, and why 
they have been Iplaced upon the 
earth in this day and time. 

It is a glorious thing, my brethren 
and sisters, to have a knowledge in 
your heart that God lives, that Jesus 
is the Christ, and that our Father 
has been merciful to us in this day 
in restoring the plan whereby we 
might be saved in His kingdom. I 
know this Gospel is true. I know 
that Joseph Smith was a prophet of 
God. I know that Joseph F. Smith 
is a prophet of God, and that he has 
influence over the hearts of men and 
women to lift them up and make 
them better in this life ; and their 
righteous lives gives them a better 
chance of salvation in the life to 
come. I am only one of hundreds 
of voting men who have been 
touched by the lives of the men who 
stand at the head of this Church, in 
whose hearts dwells the love of God 



and the love of their fellow, men. 
That influence is not confined either 
to the President of the Church, and 
the Twelve Apostles, but is pos- 
sessed also by Stake Presidents and 
Bishops, and is in the hearts of all 
the men and women who have a 
testimony of God, and are striving 
to keep His commandments. 

May the God of heaven help us 
to defend the faith, to magnify 
the name of God through all our 
days, is my prayer in the name of 
Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER JOSEPH E. ROBINSON. 

(President of California Mission.) 

"Thy dead men shall live ; to- 
gether with my dead body shall they 
arise. Awake and sing, ye that 
dwell in dust, for thy clew is as the 
dew of herbs, and the earth shall 
cast out the dead," so said Isaiah to 
ancient Israel. Today (Easter Sun- 
day), throughout all Christendom, 
people who believe in the Lord Jesus 
Christ are giving evidence, by wor- 
ship and by offerings and gifts, that 
they believe the words of Isaiah. It 
was not always so, and so far as 
that is concerned, it is but true in a 
limited sense today, for of the 350,- 
000.000 of so-called Christians, 
against 1.500,000,000 of people in 
the world, there are many of the 
Christians who do not accept as a 
fact the teachings of the Bible that 
Christ did arise, and that the dead 
shall come again from the tomb as 
foretold by Isaiah and by the proph- 
ets who followed after him. 

As well said by Elder Richards, 
anyone who has studied the provi- 
dences of God from time imme- 
morial must be struck with the evi- 
dent love, mercy, charity and provi- 
dent kindness that lie has exercised

toward His children, for though 
Adam fell and brought upon himself 
and his children endless sleep in the 
grave, God suffered men not to die, 
until they had been sufficiently in- 
structed in the plan of life and sal- 
vation, to know that they might live 
again. An angel was sent who in- 
structed Adam not only in the prin- 
ciple of faith in God and repentance 
from wrong doing, but in the ordi- 
nance of baptism, and took him and 
laid him beneath the watery ele- 
ment, that he too should be born 
anew from the grave of waters and 
thus evidence faith in Christ, typi- 
fied by the Lamb, that he was in- 
structed to offer as a sacrifice to 
teach all his children in a concrete 
manner the fact that Christ, the 
Lamb of God, in the meridian of 
time should be offered up as a sac- 
rifice that men should not sleep 
eternally in the dust. So Adam was 
baptized, and he taught these prin- 
ciples of saving grace unto his chil- 
dren and his children's children for 
nearly a thousand years of mortal 
reckoning. 

Not only did God manifest Him- 
self to Adam and the ancient patri- 
archs — to Noah, who builded the 
ark, and to his sons, and their im- 
mediate descendants, but when 
Israel had become a nation of serfs 
in bondage in Egypt, He spoke unto 
them by the mouth of Aaron, as 
well as by that of Moses ; and not 
only to Israel did He make His call 
to repentance, but unto the Egyp- 
tians as well. For mark you, not 
one of the wondrous miracles per- 
formed in Egypt but what was a 
direct rebuke to the Egyptian gods. 

The insignia of power in Egypt 
was the sacred snake, two entwined 
which made the crown of the 
Pharaohs of Upper and Lower 
Egypt. The rod of Aaron, cast upon 



the ground in the symbol of that 
power, overcame the snake of the 
Egyptian, and in that little thing, 
showed the power of the Hebrew 
God to be greater than that of the 
magicians of the Egyptian king. 

The River Nile, the Father of 
Waters, the healer of the sick, wor- 
shiped by the Egyptians as the 
bringer of seed time and harvest — 
for in flood time it spread its waters 
out over the great valley of the Nile, 
making it the granary of the ancient 
world — this river became flooded 
with the red waters from the moun- 
tains, until it became like as blood 
and was a thing of disgust unto the 
people. It nauseated where once it 
had pleased, and sickened, they 
turned away from., that which once 
they had bowed down to in devo- 
tion, unto which they had offered 
virgins as sacrifice — and felt again 
that the wrath of the Hebrew God 
made manifest His omnipotence 
over theirs of the Nile. 

Its inundation brought with it, 
doubtless, the plague of frogs. The 
frog, in Egypt was a sacred crea- 
ture, and he who inadvertently 
should tread upon one and kill it, 
was himself to suffer the penalty of 
death. Now this great plague came 
upon the land, as foretold by Moses, 
until it crowded into their homes, 
into their bedrooms, and even into 
the kneading troughs. Sickened 
again, and in disgust, the Egyptian 
turned away from the laothsome 
creature, and was robbed again of a 
god that he had worshiped. 

So with the plague of lice and 
flies — for one of their most sacred 
goddesses was supposed to keep 
these things out of the land of Egypt 
— but they crept in upon them, into 
sanctuaries of their temples, even 
the holy of holies, and the priestly 
robes of the initiated priesthood, 



74 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



were all defiled by these loathsome 
things, until again they were dis- 
gusted with their gods and felt how 
impotent they were when arrayed 
against the power of Israel's God ; 
and so on, from step to step, the 
hail, the thunders and the lightnings 
which are so infrequent in that land, 
so much so that it is said "in Egypt 
it never rains," came upon them and 
destroyed their crops. Murrain 
came upon the beasts of the field 
and destroyed doubtless the great 
bull Amnion that they worshiped in 
the temple of Heliopolis. 

The great god Ra, the sun. that 
painted the flowers and ripened the 
harvest, that • secured them in 
warmth, was put out in the midst of 
darkness, that men could feel, and 
made a night of three days in which 
there could be no light made, and so 
this god in turn, was made to bow 
to the power of Israel's God. 

By this time, the Egyptians were 
ready to let Israel go, but Pharaoh 
hardened his heart again. His pos- 
sessions had not diminished so 
much. His servants had kept from 
him the dread things that had come 
to the common people ; and so he 
still held out for the power of the 
Egyptian god against that of Israel. 
Then the warning was sent unto 
him— for lie had refused longer to 
look upon the face of Moses — that 
the destroying angel should pass 
through the land, and that the first- 
born of every creature, both of man 
and beast should be destroyed ex- 
cept where they exercised faith in 
the blood of the Lamb, and typified 
it as it had been in Eden's garden 
by the sacrifice that was to be made, 
and their door-posts and the lintels 
thereof were to be sprinkled with 
blond of the sacrificial lamb. That 
night, we understand, a scourge 
passed over Egypt, and none es- 



caped except those who were faith- 
ful and did as ordered by Moses. 
In the house of Pharaoh was lifted 
the voice of mourning, for his first- 
born was stricken down with the 
dread malady, and so their great 
god Osiris, the last and final one, 
the arbiter of their fates, the one 
who gave life to the world, was put 
to naught and shamed by the power 
of the Hebrew God. 

And so by these miracles testi- 
mony was given to ancient Egypt, 
that they too might repent and not 
be cut off until they had been suffi- 
ciently instructed in the way of 
truth. And when Moses, having 
divided the waters of the Red Sea, 
and carried his people through vic- 
toriously to the nether side thereof, 
to the plains of Arabia, when he 
sought out his father-in-law Jethro, 
and announced unto him all that 
God had done in Egypt, the old 
priest, who had given to Moses his 
priesthood and instructed him ii1 the 
ways of righteousness, lifted up his 
voice and his eyes unto the heavens, 
and said, "Now I know that the 
Lord is greater than all — for in the 
thing wherein they dealt proudly — 
He was above them." 

And so the Lord, by His benefi- 
cence and love hath taught to all 
men as they would receive light and 
instruction, the fact of His redemp- 
tion — the truths of His Gospel. 

It was a hard thing to understand 
that men might live again — they 
who were laid away in their tomb — 
that their bodies, revivified, renewed 
and immortalized, should coine 
forth to eternal life, to immortality 
and everlasting youth : but Isaiah 
knew it, and declared it unto Israel 
as I have quoted : and the major 
prophets after him bear that same 
testimony. 

The Lamb of God Himself de- 



ELDERJOSEPH E. ROBINSON.

clared when he was upon the earth, 
"I am the resurrection and the life: 
he who believeth on me, though he 
were dead, yet shall he live," and 
said, "If I be lifted up, I shall draw 
all men unto me ;" and declared that 
not only should the living hear His 
voice, but they who were dead and 
in their graves should hear the voice 
of the Son of God and live." 

The testimony of the ancient 
fathers of the Church, as well as the 
Scripture, bear witness that Christ, 
before He arose from the grave and 
broke the. shackles of death, went 
into the prison house and preached 
to the spirits which were in prison — 
and for this reason, says Peter, "that 
they might be judged according to 
men in the flesh" — by the same law, 
by the same ordinances, by the same 
constraints, the same reasoning that 
men are judged today: faith in God, 
repentance from sin, baptism by im- 
mersion, and the laying on of hands 
for the gift of the Holy Ghost — for 
these were the principles of the Gos- 
pel that Christ and His apostles 
taught to men, by which He founded 
the Church, setting at the head first 
Apostles, Prophets, etc. — and being 
"judged according to men in the 
flesh," as you and I shall be judged, 
being in the spirit world they should 
"live according to God in the spirit." 

We have been told, and we have 
read, of the miraculous resurrection 
of the Christ, of His recovery from, 
death, and the bringing out of His 
body from the tomb, that He walked 
and talked with men, ate with them, 
and taught them for a season of sev- 
eral weeks relative to His plan and 
their labors for bringing to pass the 
salvation of the souls of men. I 
know that hard-headed men are 
loath to accept the fact that we can 
live again ; and yet, if this be not 
true, we stand as a contradiction of 



all of nature's creation. We are a 
paradox, yea, more than a paradox, 
an anomaly ; for God has set in our 
hearts alone, so far as we can deter- 
mine, the longing, the desire, the 
yearning after immortality and eter- 
nal life. We understand that there 
is nothing meaningless, nothing vain 
or waste in the emotions of living 
creatures : that they shall meet their 
complement here or hereafter. 

We build, we suffer, and we sacri- 
fice for things that within and of 
themselves of necessity, because of 
mortality, can never be attained unto 
in mortal life. Life were vain, in 
fact, "if in this life only we have 
hope," for the deepest things that 
stir our souls, that which appeals to 
us most, has to do with the future, 
with the eternal association with one 
another, in the family relationship, 
in the presence of God and His 
Christ, who was the first fruit of 
them who slept, and in whose image 
and likeness, John tells us, we shall 
be when He comes again, for the 
grave and death and hell shall give 
up the dead in them, and they shall 
come forth in the same type as the 
Master did. 

Men believed in spirits anciently, 
and they believe in them today, and 
when the Master stood before Hirs 
disciples, "they were affrighted," 
saith the scriptures, for they thought 
it was His Spirit, but He called unto 
them and said, "Handle me, and see 
that a spirit hath not flesh and bones 
as you see me have." And still they 
were afraid, and so He asked if they 
had anything to eat, and they gave 
to Him an honeycomb and fish, and 
He ate in their presence. A week 
later, on the Lord's day, when He 
appeared unto them again, and the 
doubtful one, Thomas, who had 
heard the testimony of his brethren 
and of the women who had seen the 



76 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Christ and conversed with Him, did 
not believe that testimony, but said, 
"ve have seen a spirit." and con- 
tended with them, that he would not 
believe unless he could thrust his 
hand into His side and feel the 
prints of the nails in the hands and 
feet of the Master, and would not 
believe that He had recovered His 
body from the dead — the Master ap- 
peared before him and said, "Reach 
hither thy hand and thrust it into 
my side and be not faithless but be- 
lieving," and Thomas, convinced in 
his soul, cried out, "My Lord, and 
my God ;" and the Master upbraided 
him gently because he had needed 
such a testimony to believe, because 
he would not accept the word of his 
brethren nor their testimony. He 
said, "Thomas, because thou hast 
seen me, thou hast believed : blessed 
are they who have not seen and yet 
have believed." 

And that is the touch-stone of 
virtue with the Christian today. 
Does he walk by faith? Is he will- 
ing to accept the words of the wit- 
nesses of the Christ and the words 
of the Master, and not desire to han- 
dle and see for himself as did 
Thomas? For I want to tell you 
that when a man has to do a thing, 
there is no virtue in it. But when 
he chooses to. when he exercises 
faith and confidence, then there is 
virtue and righteousness in it. 

T said if there be no immortality, 
we stand as a contradiction to the 
rules of nature, an anomaly in her 
handiwork, for when we look forth 
upon her creations, they all answer 
the end thereof in this life, except 
man. We need not deal with the 
vegetable field, but when we come 
to animate things, to the birds of the 
air and the fishes of the deep, and 
the beasts and the creeping things of 
the field — they have no thought of 



the morrow, no care and no heed. 
Divine providence cares for them, 
brings a complement of their lives 
to them. Some will tell us it is in- 
tuition that guides them so uner- 
ringly in the pursuit of that which 
prolongs their lives and enables 
them to perpetuate their species in 
the earth, and others would have us 
believe it is habit ; but those who 
walk by faith see behind it all a 
divine will that directs all of the en- 
ergies of nature and all of her crea- 
tures, to the end that His name shall 
be honored and glorified, and that 
His purposes relative to His creat- 
ures shall be fulfilled, and that thev 
aside from man. and man too, shall 
come to a fullness of joy. 

But with the creatures beneath 
men. they have not their own will, 
they answer the ends of the divine 
will. But when it comes to us. God 
hath given us our free agency to 
choose and to act for self. We 
gloried in this before the world? 
were. It is one of the greatest bene- 
factions that we have in this life, 
because by it and with it men can 
develop the divine which is within 
them and come into a full fruition 
of godliness. 

T said that beasts have no thought 
of the morrow, and no heed, except 
as instinct or divine love may guide 
them to provide for their morrow or 
for themselves : but when it comes 
to man, he has the capability of wor- 
ship, of paying homage and devo- 
tion that the beast has not ; and this 
of itself, according to the rules of 
nature, demands a complement in a 
being to worship, in someone to pay 
homage to and a creature that 
arouses our devotion, and to whom 
we can prove ourselves devoted ; 
and so this, of itself, makes God a 
necessity, for men to come into full 
complement of his God-given at- 



ELDER JOSEPH E. ROBINSON.

tributes and powers. Man alone 
has the power of conceiving of a 
heaven, of a hereafter, and it is with 
all men, from the most illustrious 
in the halls of learning, to the pagan 
of the darkest continent and to the 
Indian of our own loved country in 
his most remote and ignorant state. 
They dream — these latter — of their 
"happy hunting grounds," of a place 
where they shall be provided for, 
where gaunt famine and sickness 
are unknown, with a larder never 
empty, and where men dwell as 
brothers and friends. 

The Christian dreams of a place 
where he shall worship God and 
look upon His face, where there 
shall be anthems of hallelujahs sung 
forever. And the Latter-day Saint 
looks for the place where he shall 
build, as he began to build in this 
life for an eternal home, for the 
family relationship, for father and 
for mother, for wife and husband, 
for parents and children, to associate 
together until they shall come into a 
fullness of all that their fond hearts 
have desired and their minds have 
conceived of ; and it shall be an end- 
less home of eternal progression in 
the presence of the Christ and with 
the Father, who is God over all. The 
capabilities which man has are di- 
vine, and they only lack time and 
opportunity for expression in com- 
plete development to become like the 
Father, whose children we are. 

With Him and in His presence, in 
the eons of years yet to come, we 
shall come into a fulness of divinity, 
and build yet other mansions for our 
Father, thus adding to His glory as 
we add to the glory and perpetuity 
of our own homes and families. 

None but men can conceive of 
this, and when he has once con- 
ceived of it, and then is told that 
this probation is the end of life, and 



this is the end of progression, when 
death shall claim us and shall still 
the voice and shut down the eyes 
and make pulseless the hand — how 
vain is life, and how vain the im- 
aginations and sacrifices of man ! 
But how exalting the other thought ! 
What an incentive to correct living 
and to proper thinking for men to 
believe that they can strike hands 
with the Infinite. One can become 
like Him and have and hold the 
family relationship forever and ever 
without end of years, that God loved 
them from before the beginning 
until after the ending of this life, 
and that this bringeth a fullness of 
joy — to have the body and the spirit 
inseparably connected, the body by 
which we receive so many of our 
impressions in this life, by which we 
have manifested ourselves to our 
fellows, by which we have learned 
the sweets of life as well as the bit- 
ter things, by which we have 
achieved success, in which we have 
been chastened by adversity and sor- 
row, through which we have learned 
what it is to be cared for and to' be 
loved, that we in turn might be com- 
passionate and loving to others, and 
that the full development of our 
capabilities and talents must come 
and be with and through this vehicle 
that our Father hath clothed our 
spirits with, and that with this body 
we shall come into not only that 
which I have intimated, but untold, 
which the mind of man here, finite, 
cannot conceive of ! 

Would not life then be vain in 
conceiving these things and having 
these powers of conception, these be- 
liefs, these longings and yearnings, 
and have them go unanswered? 
After we have sacrificed for them, 
loved them, and loved those who 
have labored for them, would not 
life be vain? Would we not be a 



78 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



contradiction to the law of nature if 
there be nothing of life save this lit- 
tle span of existence, of mortality? 
And so today, in the light of modern 
revelation, in the light of what the 
scientist has unfolded, though as yet 
he has not demonstrated it in his 
laboratory — yet so nearly that our 
greatest thinkers today, — Stead and 
Lodge, who are dead, and Currie 
and Crooks, Myers and Funk and 
others alive, have announced the 
fact that there is an immortal > soul, 
and that it is not impossible even 
scientifically, to demonstrate suffi- 
ciently to prove to .the seeking mind 
and the faithful heart that Christ 
arose from the dead ; — so shall the 
bodies of men again live and be 
"energized" and be made immortal. 

I thank them for this testimony, 
because there are some who will not 
accept in faith, as I have said, nor 
as did Thomas, anything that is not 
demonstrated coldly before them ; 
but in the light of these things, and 
of modern revelation, I say again, 
as Isaiah said, unto you, and as this 
Sabbath day, the Easter Sunday, 
should bear witness to all men, — 
"Thy dead men shall live, together 
with my dead body shall they arise. 
Awake and sing, ye that dwell in the 
dust, for thy dew is as the dew of 
herbs, and thy earth shall cast out 
the dead." Amen. 

A quartet, consisting of James H. 
Neilson, Hyrum J. Christiansen, 
Harold Langton and Aner Hansen 
sang the hymn, "O, give me back 
my Prophet Dear." 

ELDER J. GOLDEN KIMBALL. 

(Of the First Council of Seventy.) 
To speak to people in the open is 
new to me, but there is something 
about it I like, and that is. if you 
don't care for what I say, you can 
return home! (Laughter.) 



I am trying to take the hopeful, 
optimistic view of things. I am 
a man among men who are looking 
into the future. I have hope of the 
future, and I am trying not tc be 
afraid of it. I am burning all my 
bridges behind me, so that I cannot 
go backward, I hope that my course 
will be onward and that I will look 
upward, that I will look out and for- 
ward, not backward. I am trying to 
be optimistic, and I am having quite 
a time of it. I cannot work myself 
up quite as well as the man whn 
fell from a twenty-story building, 
and as he passed a window of the 
tenth story, a drummer in the room, 
said to his wife : "Gee, that fel- 
low is optimistic." His wife said, 
"What do you mean ?" "Why, as the 
fellow passed the window, he said : 
'I'm all right yet.' " (Laughter.) 

Now, brethren, I read in Scripture, 
"He that is the greatest, shall be a 
servant." Some think that means 
he that is greatest in the kingdom of 
God must be a valet, or a butler, or 
a hostler. I do not believe in that 
doctrine, at all ; T think it means 
that he that is greatest in the king- 
dom of God must give service, be 
willing to sacrifice. He that is great- 
est must be a Joseph Smith, a Brig- 
ham Young — and I am not afraid to 
say, a Heber C. Kimball. 

What I want to talk about are real 
things, not something that I do not 
know anything about. When I get 
through, I will have told you some- 
thing I know, so that you can go 
home and think about it. I am go- 
ing to talk about things that have 
happened since I was born, not 
something that happened eighteen 
hundred years ago, or that will hap- 
pen hundreds of years in the future. 

When President Brigham Young 
came, with the pioneers, he was sick, 
and prostrated in the wagon in 



ELDER J. GOLDEN KIM R J LI

which he was riding", he rose and 
saw this valley, and said : ''This is 
the place: drive on!" He did not 
preach for an hour over it. When 
he came upon the ground where this 
Temple now stands, he dropped his 
cane, and said : "Here we will build 
a Temple to our God." They got 
bus)-, they prayed about it, they 
fasted, and then they built it. It 
took them 40 years. When I think 
about that building, every stone in it 
is a sermon to me. It tells of suf- 
fering, it tells of sacrifice, it preach- 
es — every rock in it, preaches a dis- 
course. When it was dedicated, it 
seemed to me that it was the great- 
est sermon that has ever been 
preached since the Sermon on the 
Mount. When I go up on the Capi- 
tol Hill, and see that great build- 
ing, a great pile of granite, etc., that 
will cost two million and a half ; 
there is not a stone in it that whis- 
pers ! It is speechless. It does not 
tell of suffering or of faith. Any 
man who will come to the Bureau 
of Information and listen to the 
guides will learn that every window, 
every steeple, everything about the 
Temple speaks of the things of God, 
and gives evidence of the faith of 
the people who built it. 

When I see this monument here, 
(indicating the Sea-Gull Monument 
standing on the Temple Grounds), 
I notice that many of you men pass 
it by as if it told no story. When 
I think of that monument, it tells me 
of suffering, it tells me of a people 
that were about to be destroyed by 
famine : it tells me of crickets that 
were destroying and eating up 
everything. The people prayed, 
they fasted, and they got busy, every 
man, woman, and child killed 
crickets. But they could not kill 
them all, so God came in and helped 
them. He sent the gulls, and they ate 



the crickets, and the people were 
saved. 

That Tabernacle preaches the 
same kind of sermon. I helped haul 
sand for it, when I was a boy. 
Every Saturday we had to haul 
sand, and that is how I learned 
something about these things. You 
see this wall surrounding this block 
— do you think we built it to keep 
the Indians out? I want to tell you 
we built it to give employment ; and 
when people were out of work, and 
hungry, we found something for 
them to do. If we could not find 
anything else to do, we built walls. 
That is what you want to do now — 
give service — give work. 

When Christ gathered the people 
together, they were hungry, and 
then their Master fed them, and 
after they were filled He gave them 
the Bread of Life, fed them, and 
then told them the truth. If people 
are out of employment, you find 
something for them to do, and then 
bless them. 

Think of what this people have 
done ; not what they have preached, 
but what they have accomplished, 
and what they have suffered. I 
desire to say to you Seventies, get 
ready, and after a while we will sing 
the hymn, "Hark, Listen to the 
Trumpeters ! They Sound for 
Volunteers." Now, we will not say 
to you what the Savior said to the 
young man, ''Sell whatsoever thou 
hast and give to the poor, and take 
up the cross and follow the Master 
and I will give you the greatest of 
all gifts that God has ever given His 
children, which is Eternal Life," 
all we ask you to do is to give what- 
soever you have to your family, and 
pick up your valise and go on a 
mission. Do you want eternal life? 
Almost everybody here would be 
awfully keen for it, if it did not cost 



80 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



anything. We would accept the 
whole world if it did not cost any- 
thing ; I would be willing to take 
half of it myself. (Laughter.) 

The greatest of all gifts is "Eter- 
nal Life," but we have to pay for 
it, just like our fathers and mothers 
did. We will have to pay for it 
with service, and with sacrifice ; as 
there can be no blessings obtained 
without sacrifice. I know what is the 
matter. We think more of automo- 
biles, we think more of oriental 
rugs, and hundred-dollar gowns 
than we do of salvation. T know 
you have faith, many of you, and 
now we want to begin to get hold 
with both hands and make this fight 
for the Lord. I prophesy that hun- 
dreds of you, thousands of you, will 
go into the world on missions. 

Now, my brethren every man who 
holds the holy Melchisedek Priest- 
hood, and is a Special Witness for 
God, should get ready for a mission. 
Begin to pay your debts, and train 
your family, and get them so that 
they will be glad to have you go. 
Stop writing letters to the First 
Council making a lot of excuses, 
that your wife is sick, that you are 
in debt, or that you are sick. What 
is faith for? Who is the Great 
Physician? Why don't I get well? 
Because I haven't faith enough. I 



am trying to hurry up and get well 
so that I can go. 

You must look into the future ; 
this world belongs to the visionary 
men. Brigham Young had a vision. 
He said that this city would reach 
to the point of the mountain south, 
and I am a witness that it will come 
true. People did not believe it. 
Joseph Smith had a vision, a revela- 
tion that we would "come to the 
Rocky Mountains and build great 
cities, and become a mighty people.'' 
We have started to fulfill that proph- 
ecy. 

Now, brethren and sisters, we 
have Prophets, we have Apostles, 
we have the gifts and the blessings. 
You Seventies must go out and heal 
the sick : you must go out and com- 
fort the desolate, and you must go 
to the nations of the world, after this 
war is over — it cannot last forever. 
You Seventies will go — this proph- 
ecy will come true, otherwise we 
will make High Priests of you and 
ordain other Seventies who will go. 
The Lord bless you. Amen. 

The Choir sang the anthem, 
"Awake my Soul," Geneva Harris 
and II. J. Christiansen sang the 
duet. 

Benediction was pronounced by 
Elder Win. J. Robinson. 



SECOND DAY. 



Conference was resumed, in the 
Tabernacle, at 10 a. m., Monday 
April 5th ; President Joseph F. 
Smith presiding. 

The congregation sang the hymn : 

Our God, we raise to Thee 
Thanks for Thy blessings free 

We here enjoy; 
In this far western land, 
A true and chosen band, 
Led hither by Thy hand, 

We sing for joy. 

Prayer was offered by Elder C. 
F. Middleton. 

The congregation sang the hymn : 

Come, come, ye Saints 
No toil nor labor fear, 

But with joy wend your way; 
Though hard to you 
This journey may appear, 

Grace shall be as your day. 

ELDER HEBER J. GRANT. 

Prevalence of Gospel testimony among 
the Saints. — Joy accompanying tes- 
timony bearing. — Righteous living 
essential to salvation. — Apostasy of 
men highly favored of God. 

I rejoice exceedingly in having 
this another opportunity of meeting 
in general conference. I have en- 
joyed very much indeed all that 
has been said thus far during our 
conference, and I humbly pray that 
the same good spirit which has 
characterized the remarks that have 
been made by those, who have pre- 
ceded me, may be given me. I do 
desire most earnestly that what I 
say may encourage and bless the 
Latter-day Saints, and that it may 
be in harmony with what has been 



said by those who have preceded 
me. 

I rejoice in the gospel of Jesus 
Christ. I rejoice in my association 
with the Latter-day Saints, and the 
privileges which have come to me in 
mingling with the people, and in 
learning of their feelings, of their 
devotion, of their love of God and 
for this work in which we are en- 
gaged. I rejoice in the abiding tes- 
timony of the divinity of the mis- 
sion of our Lord and Master, Jesus 
Christ, which is to be found among 
the people. The Latter-day Saints 
know that Jesus was in very deed 
the Redeemer of the world. They 
have a positive knowledge that 
Joseph Smith was chosen of God, 
and that he was the instrument in 
the hands of the Lord in establish- 
ing again on the earth the plan of 
life and salvation. They know that 
he was a true prophet of God ; they 
have no doubt regarding the divin- 
ity of his mission. The men who 
stand at the head of the various 
stakes of Zion and the women who 
preside over the Relief Societies, 
the principal auxiliary organization 
among our sisters — as I mingle 
among them, and also with men and 
women who preside over the Sab- 
bath Schools in the stakes, and the 
Mutual Improvement Associations, 
Religion Classes and Primaries, I 
find a devotion and love of God and 
of this work among all of them 
which is a constant inspiration to 
me. I rejoice in the rich outpour- 
ings of the Spirit of the Lord in our 
quarterly conferences. I rejoice in 
the blessings that come to me and to 



82 



(JEN ERAL CONFERENCE. 



others, as we mingle among the peo- 
ple, in being helped and strength- 
ened in teaching to them the Gospel 
of Christ. 

My heart has been filled with grat- 
itude, especially during the past six 
months, for what seemed to me to 
be an increased portion of the Spirit 
of the Lord, as I mingled among 
the people in discharge of the du- 
ties that devolved upon me. I know 
of nothing that brings greater joy 
to the human heart than laboring at 
home or abroad for the salvation of 
the souls of men. I know of noth- 
ing which gives us a greater love 
of all that is good, than teaching 
this Gospel of Jesus Christ. To me, 
one of the greatest testimonies of 
the divinity of the mission of our 
Savior is the joy and happiness that 
we all experience whenever we tes- 
tify that He was in very deed the 
Son of God and the Redeemer of 
the world. I know of nothing that 
brings greater joy, except testifying 
regarding the divinity of the mission 
of the Savior than to testify re- 
garding the divinity of the mission 
of the Prophet Joseph Smith. 

The three years that I presided 
over the European mission were in 
very deed the most pleasurable, the 
most happy, the most satisfactory 
years of all my life. When instruct- 
ing the Elders I told them whenever 
they seemed to be closed up in their 
spirits, whenever they seemed to 
lack ideas to express to the people, 
if they would only testify that they 
knew that Jesus was the Redeemer, 
and then testify regarding the divine 
mission of the Prophet Joseph 
Smith, that the Lord would open 
their mouths and bless them in 
speaking to the pepole. The testi- 
mony of all the Elders with whom 
I came in contact who had done this 
was that the Lord did, in very deed, 



bless them whenever they testified 
of the divinity of the mission of our 
Savior, or when they testified re- 
garding the divine mission of the 
Prophet Joseph Smith. Never at 
other times have I been as abund- 
antly blessed in preaching this Gos- 
pel as when I have been talking up- 
on these two themes. I rejoice in 
the individual testimony of the Lat- 
ter-day Saints regarding the divinity 
of this work in which we are en- 
gaged. I rejoice in the joy and the 
happiness that it brings to each and 
every one of us when we are doing 
our duty, and laboring for the ad- 
vancement of the Gospel, at home 
and abroad. 

I rejoice in the peace that cometh 
to every man — a peace that passeth 
understanding and my ability to ex- 
press it — when he is serving God. 
I wish that I possessed the power to 
inspire the Latter-day Saints to 
greater diligence, to greater faith- 
fulness, to a stronger determination 
to serve God and to keep His com- 
mandments. There is but one path 
of safety to the Latter-day Saints, 
and that is the path of duty. It is 
not a testimony, it is not marvelous 
manifestations, it is not knowing 
that the Gospel of Jesus Christ is 
true, that it is the plan of salvation, 
it is not actually knowing that the 
Savior is the Redeemer, and that 
Joseph Smith was His prophet, that 
will save you and me, but it is the 
keeping of the commandments of 
God, the living the life of a Latter- 
day Saint. 

I have been profoundly impressed 
upon many occasions, as I have 
studied the history of the early men 
in this Church, with the fact that 
one-half of the first quorum of 
Apostles fell by the wayside ; that 
all of the three witnesses to the 
Book of Mormon, who saw the 



ELDER HEBER J. GRANT 



83 



angel, who heard the voice of God, 
who heard the Lord testify to them 
that this work had been translated 
by the gift and power of God, that 
the Lord Himself, by His voice from 
heaven, had told these men to bear 
witness of this fact — should also 
fall by the wayside. The same with 
a majority of the eight witnesses. 
Oliver Cowdery, who heard the 
Savior's voice, and beheld a heav- 
enly messenger before the Church 
was organized, gave a description, 
which is recorded in the Pearl of 
Great Price, of his ordination, in 
connection with the Prophet, to the 
Aaronic Priesthood, stating it was 
beyond the language of man to paint 
the jov and the grandeur that sur- 
rounded them upon that occasion. 
He also had the Apostles of the 
Lord Jesus Christ, who lived upon 
the earth in the days of our Savior, 
lay their hands upon his head and 
ordain him to the Melchizedek, or 
the Higher Priesthood. In the 
Kirtland Temple, with the Prophet 
Joseph Smith, he saw the Savior, 
also Moses, Elias, and Elijah. He 
had given to him, in connection with 
the Prophet, every key and every 
authority of all the dispensations of 
the Gospel of Jesus Christ, from 
the earliest time down to the pres- 
ent, and yet by failing to do his duty 
by failing to keep the command- 
ments of God, this man lost his 
standing in the Church of Christ. 
True, he repented and came back. 
The same is true of Martin Harris. 
I remember hearing Martin Harris 
in this building testify to the truth 
of his testimony regarding the di- 
vinity of the Book of Mormon. I 
also rejoice that, although he never 
returned to the Church, David 
Whitmer never varied in bearing 
this testimony; the very fact 
that this man, although he bore 



this testimony to the day of his 
death, had no joy, no satisfaction 
in it, shows that the Spirit giveth 
life, and the letter killeth. I have 
met some who have visited David 
Whitmer, and he told them that it 
was one of the burdens of his life to 
have people come there day after 
day to whom he had to testify re- 
garding his knowledge of the Book 
of Mormon, and the visit of the 
angel to him. 

There is not a Latter-day Saint 
living who is keeping the command- 
ments of the Lord, who would not 
regard it as one of the greatest joys 
imaginable if he could testify that 
he had heard the voice of God, and 
that the Lord had given him a com- 
mandment ; and that, in fulfilment 
of the requirement of the Lord, he 
had recorded in this testimony : "we 
bear witness of these things." How 
we all. would rejoice to be able to 
bear such a testimony ; provided, we 
had the Spirit of God ; provided we 
were so living that it was not a 
dead letter with us. David Whit- 
mer stopped growing, notwith- 
standing the manifestations that he 
had received, when he failed to keep 
the commandments of God, when he 
failed to recognize the proper au- 
thority in the Church of Christ. 

May the Lord bless each and all 
of us ; and, as we grow in years 
and increase in understanding, may 
we grow in the light and knowledge 
of the gospel of Jesus Christ, in a 
determination to serve Him, and 
keep His commandments ; and may 
all of us who hold places of respon- 
sibility in the Church so order our 
lives that they may be an inspiration 
to the people, because of our faith- 
fulness, our diligence, our loyalty 
to this gospel, and our support of 
our file leaders, is my prayer, and I

ask it in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 

Sister Romania Hyde played a 
selection on the violin. 



ELDER RUGDER CLAWSON. 

Nebuchadnezzar's dream, and Daniel's 
interpretation — The great image a 
represenation of empires and king- 
doms — Fall of earthlv kingdoms, and 
establishment of God's Kingdom — 
Marvelous facts demonstrated by 
Joseph Smith's glorious vision — 
Perfect organization of the Church 
— Army of the Priesthood fighting 
sin. 

My brethren and sisters, the violin 
solo to which we have just listened 
rendered by Romania Hyde, was 
beautiful indeed, and speaks well for 
home talent. 

The words of counsel, testimony 
and instruction which have already 
been spoken at this conference are 
very precious to us. I think that we 
ought to be thankful that we have 
our file leaders with us today, the 
Presidency of the Church, and the 
president of the Twelve Apostles, 
and that .these men are strong - in 
limb and body, and powerful in ut- 
terance. Surely we ought to give 
heed to their counsels. 

I trust, my brethren and sisters, 
that during the few moments T oc- 
cupy I may have an interest in your 
faith and prayers, that T shall be 
able to say something that will be 
appropriate to this great gathering 
of Latter-day Saints, and that shall 
be comforting, encouraging and in- 
structive. 

Tn ancient times a very remark- 
able thing happened, remarkable be- 
cause it had a bearing and an in- 
fluence upon the destiny of the 
world, to the latest generation. You 



will perhaps remember that upon 
one occasion Nebuchadnezzar, king 
of Babylon, called into his presence 
Daniel, a young Hebrew, one of the 
chosen race, and demanded of this 
young man two things which the 
magicians of Babylon, the wise men, 
had not been able to do. One was 
that the young man should bring to 
the mind of the king a dream that 
he had dreamed, and then that he 
should give the interpretation there- 
of. Daniel replied and said that of 
himself he could not do this, but that 
the God of Heaven could do it. and 
would intervene and give the inter- 
pretation of the dream. So Daniel 
told the great king that in his dream 
he had seen a mighty image, and 
that this image represented the 
kingdoms of the world which should 
follow. Now, brethren and sisters, 
it is a fact that subsequent history 
has shown the exact fulfillment of 
Daniel's prophetic statement, so far 
as the world has progressed. 

It seems that Babylon, under 
Nebuchadnezzar and Belshazzar, 
represented the head of gold, .and 
that the great kingdom of the Medes 
and Persians, under Cyrus and 
Darius, represented the arms and 
shoulders of the image ; and follow- 
ing this was the powerful kingdom 
of Macedonia. Daniel did not name 
the kingdoms ; perhaps he didn't 
know what their names would be, 
but he described them ; and the great 
kingdom of Macedonia, under Alex- 
ander the Great and others, were 
represented by the belly and thighs 
of the image, which were of brass. 
Then came the mighty empire of 
Rome under the Caesars, which 
had in it the power and strength of 
iron, to break in pieces, to trample 
down and destroy. The Roman 
Empire, which later was split in 
twain, was represented by the legs 



ELDER RUDGER CLAW SON. 



85 



of the image. The comparison, you 
will see, is very correct and beauti- 
ful. After the decline and fall of 
the Roman Empire, the kingdom 
was divided into a number of small- 
er kingdoms, and these were repre- 
sented by the feet and toes of the 
image, which were composed of iron 
and miry clay ; that is to say, these 
kingdoms would have in them the 
strength of iron and the weakness of 
clay, and would not therefore cleave 
together. We know that they did 
not cleave together, that these king- 
doms, the present monarchies of 
Europe, are divided and are at this 
moment engaged in a great world 
conflict. 

But Daniel said, and this is the 
particular thing I want to call your 
attention to, that "in the days of 
these kings shall the God of heaven 
set up a kingdom which shall never 
be destroyed, and the kingdom shall 
not be left to other people, but it 
shall break in pieces and consume 
these kingdoms, and it shall stand 
forever. Forasmuch," he said, "as 
thou sawest that the stone was cut 
out of the mountain without hands, 
and that it break in pieces the iron, 
the brass, the clay, the silver and the 
gold, the great God of heaven has 
made known to the king things 
which would come to pass hereafter, 
and" he said — and I presume he said 
it with strong emphasis, "the dream 
is certain, and the interpretation 
thereof is sure." Now, we claim 
that this kingdom predicted by 
Daniel has been set up. But a 
stranger might ask, "Why, Mr. 
Claw son, surely you do not maintain 
that the kingdom referred to by 
Daniel has been set up in this day 
and age of the world?" Why, if 
that be the case, didn't this event 
attract world-wide attention? Did 
it not create a sensation ?" No, it 



did not. "How do you account for 
that?" Well, I think the answer 
would be that it was overlooked, be- 
cause the Lord works in a very quiet 
and logical way. He works through, 
men, through mortal men, and some- 
times it may not appear to the 
natural eye that the Lord is doing it, 
that His hand is in it. Sometimes 
we can only discern these things 
spiritually, by our faith, by our 
spiritual sight. It was overlooked, 
possibly, very much as the coming 
of the Messiah was overlooked by 
the Jews. They expected that He 
would come with demonstrations of 
great power, and of majesty and 
might ; but instead of that He came 
into the world in a very humble 
manner. He was born in a manger, 
and was known in His country as 
the son of Joseph and Mary, Joseph 
the carpenter. Therefore, the Jews 
did not perceive that He was the 
Savior. Thev rejected and crucified 
Him. 

So with reference to this great 
latter-day kingdom. The stranger 
might then ask, very consistently, 
"If that be the case will you kindly 
tell me how it was established?" 
Well, it happened in this way. Many 
years ago a boy by the name of 
Joseph Smith, who was nearing his 
fifteenth year — this was in 1820 — 
was seriously agitated over religious 
matters, due to a great revival in 
his neighborhood. He had a spirit- 
ual longing ; he was seeking for the 
true church ; he had not been able 
to find it. The contention was so 
serious, and the difference of opin- 
ion so great, that he could not de- 
termine which of all the sects was 
the true church, and so he followed 
the advice of James, the Apostle, 
who said, "If any man lack wisdom 
let him ask of God. who giveth lib- 
erally and upbraideth not, and it 



86 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



shall be given him." This young 
boy relied upon the word of the 
Lord. He never had prayed 
vocally, but he believed in the scrip- 
tures. He believed what James 
said, and thought he would venture. 
So he went out into the woods to 
pray, a mere stripling of a boy, and 
had a very wonderful experience. 
It can be told much better in his 
own words than I could tell it. Re- 
member, brethren and sisters, and 
friends that these words, which were 
written by Joseph Smith, the proph- 
et, and this manifestation was given 
to him at a very youthful period of 
his life. He said : 

"So in accordance with this, my de- 
termination to ask of God, I retired to 
the woods to make the attempt. It 
was on the morning of a beautiful, 
clear day, early in the spring of 1820. 
It was the first time in my life that I 
had made such an attempt, for amidst 
all my anxieties I had never, as yet, 
made the attempt to pray vocally. 

"After I had retired to the place 
where I had previously designed to 
go, having looked around me, finding 
myself alone, I kneeled down and 
began to offer up the desires of my 
heart to God. I had scarcely done so, 
when immediately I was seized upon 
by some power which entirely over- 
came me, and had such an astonishing 
influence over me as t o bind my 
tongue, so that I could not speak. 
Thick darkness gathered around me, 
and it seemed to me for a time as if 
I were doomed to sudden destruc- 
tion. 

"But, exerting all my powers to call 
upon God to deliver me out of the 
power of this enemy which had seized 
upon me, and at the very moment 
when I was ready to sink into despair 
and abandon myself to destruction — 
not to an imaginary ruin, but to the 
power of some actual bein^ from the 
unseen world, who had such marvel- 
ous power as I had never before felt 
in any being — just at this moment of 
great alarm, I saw a pillar of light 
exactly over my head, above the 
brightness of the sun, which descended 
gradually until it fell upon me. 

"Tt no sooner appeared than I found 



myself delivered from the enemy 
which held me bound. When the light 
rested upon me I saw two personages, 
whose brightness and glory defy all 
description, standing above me in the 
air. One of them spake unto me, call- 
ing me by name, and said, (pointing to 
the other), 'This is My beloved Son, 
hear Him!' 

"My object in going to inquire of 
the Lord was to know which of all the 
sects was right, that I might know 
which to join. No sonner, therefore, 
did I get possession of myself, so as to 
be able to speak, than I asked the 
personages who stood above me in 
the light, which of all the sects was 
right, and which I should join. 

"I was answered that I must join 
none of them, for they were all 
wrong; and the personage who ad- 
dressed me said that all their creeds 
were an abomination in His sight; that 
those professors were all corrupt; that 
they draw near to Me with their lips, 
but their hearts are far from Me ; 'they 
teach for doctrine the commandments 
of men, having a form of godliness, 
but they deny the power thereof.'" 

This was a most remarkable man- 
ifestation of God's goodness and 
love to the boy Joseph. It seems 
that the Father and Son manifested 
themselves in person to him, proving 
that they were beings of person- 
age ; so that it would not be neces- 
sary to go to the scriptures to prove 
this fact, although it could be easily 
proven from the scriptures. He saw 
with his eyes and heard with his 
ears, and the testimony he gives to 
the world, and transmits to us, is 
that God is a being of body, parts 
and passions, in the form of man. 
and that the Son is the express 
image of the Father, but separate 
and distinct from Him. What a 
glorious revealment was this, what a 
glorious new revelation to the world, 
to confirm the old revelations con- • 
tained in the scriptures. 

Xow, the thing that I want to 
stronglv emphasize is this, that al- 
though Joseph Smith saw the Father 
and the Son, and although he heard

their voices, this did not give him 
authority to act in their name, or to 
establish the Church of God, for that 
is exactly what he subsequently did. 
But before he could move in the 
direction of founding the Church of 
God he must have divine authority. 
That came to him later, as he testi- 
fied, then, on the 15th day of May, 
in 1829, the Angel, John the 
Baptist appeared to him and Oliver 
Cowdery, and laying his hands upon 
their heads said: "Upon you, my 
fellow servants, in the name of Mes- 
siah, I confer the Aaronic Priest- 
hood, which holds the keys of the 
ministering of angels, and of the 
gospel of repentance, and of baptism 
by immersion for the remission of 
sins, and this shall not again be 
taken from the earth until the sons 
of Levi do offer again an offering 
to the Lord in righteousness." 

Thus Joseph Smith received the 
authority, and the keys of the 
Aaronic Priesthood. Then a little 
later Peter, James and John, who 
held the Melchizedek, or High 
Priesthood, appeared and laid their 
hands upon his head ordaining him 
to the apostleship. Thus he received 
the power of the High Priesthood, 
as previously he was clothed upon 
with the power of the Lesser Priest- 
hood. With this great and glorious 
authority, he organized the Church 
on the 6th day of April, 1830, with 
six members. 

That which followed has con- 
firmed the truth of Joseph Smith's 
testimony to the world, because in 
the eighty-five years that have 
passed away the Latter-day Saints 
have grown to be a mighty people 
in the Rocky Mountains; and, 
moreover, they are thoroughly or- 
ganized. Now, what do we have? 
Why, we have sixty-seven stakes of 
Zion. and between -seven hundred 



and eight hundred wards. We have 
Latter-day Saints, members of the 
Church, numbering hundreds of 
thousands, growing out of this very 
small beginning. And what more 
do we have? Why, we have a 
President of the Church, a Prophet 
of God, who stands in the same rela- 
tion to the Church as Peter did in 
his day. He holds the keys of the 
kingdom of heaven upon the earth, 
and, in connection with his coun- 
selors, presides over the Church. We 
have Twelve Apostles, we have a 
presiding Patriarch of the Church, 
Seven Presidents of the first council 
of Seventy ; and a Presiding Bishop- 
ric. These constitute the general 
authorities of the Church. We have 
also presidents of stakes, high coun- 
cilors, bishops of wards and their 
counselors, to preside locally in the 
Church. And what further do we 
have? Why, we have a great body 
of Priesthood in the Church. There 
are 11,450 high priests, 11,112 
seventies, 27,382 elders, a total of 
49,944 men who hold the Higdi 
Priesthood of God. There are 8,830 
priests, 10,607 teachers ; and 22,722 
deacons, making 42,159 who hold 
the Lesser, or the Aaronic Priest- 
hood, making a total of 92,103 who 
hold the Priesthood. These men 
have been organized into quorums 
and are being disciplined for war. 
The weapon that has been put into 
their hands is keen in cutting; it is 
like a two-edged sword, to the divid- 
ing asunder of both joints and mar- 
row. This weapon is the Gospel of 
Jesus Christ. In order that these 
men may become more familiar with 
the Gospel, courses of study are 
prepared for them, but I want to telt 
you, that these courses of study do 
not completely fit men for the great 
conflict. It is the Spirit of God, the- 
Holy Ghost, that qualifies them, anr|

these studies are simply a guide to 
help them along in the work. 

Now, let me sa)^ that when the 
shock of battle comes, men will not 
be struck down and destroyed, but 
they will be lifted up by this great 
army of Priesthood, and will be con- 
verted and rescued from sin and 
wickedness. That is the warfare in 
which we are engaged — to fight 
spiritual darkness, to fight against 
immorality, to fight against in- 
temperance, to fight against dis- 
honesty, evil-speaking and strife, to 
fight against the conflict between 
capital and labor. It is intended that 
with this weapon they shall correct 
every evil in the world, and bring 
peace and happiness to our Father's 
children, for our motto is. Peace on 
earth and good will to men. 

Now, brethren and sisters, and the 
brethren particularly, remember the 
mark of your high calling. May the 
Lord bless you and help you to do 
your duty, help yon to give proper 
attention to the Priesthood, and 
thereby avail yourselves of every 
opportunity to prepare for the battle 
of the great God. I humbly ask it 
in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

In the beautiful prayer that was 
offered in the opening of this, the 
eighty-fifth annual conference of the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints, Brother McMurrin 
asked that the revelation of the mind 
and will of our Heavenly Father be 



given to the First Presidency, and 
that the spirit of inspiration might 
be given to those who speak to the 
people during this conference. The 
prayer impressed me, as no doubt 
it did others, and I was reminded of 
the fact that there are few people in 
all the world who believe that God 
reveals Himself to man in this day. 
No one who has received the gift of 
the Holy Ghost, after baptism by 
one holding the authority of the 
Holy Priesthood, will fail to know 
that God can reveal, and does reveal 
His mind and will to the members 
of His Church. It is ninety-five 
years since God revealed Himself 
to the boy, Joseph Smith, in the 
way that has been called to your at- 
tention this morning by Brother 
Clawson, and scarcely could it be 
told better than in the simple and 
forceful words of the Prophet him- 
self. This visitation of the Father 
and the Son to Joseph Smith was 
the opening of a new dispensation. 
That wonderful passage in the 
Epistle of James: "If any of you 
lack wisdom, let him ask of God, 
that giveth to all men liberally, and 
upbraideth not : and it shall be given 
him," was the passage in the Bible 
that impelled the boy to action. It 
was because of his faith, his confi- 
dence that there was a God, that he 
retired to the grove and pleaded 
with the Father to know his will 
concerning the churches organized 
at that time in the world. From 
that moment on, the heavens were 
opened unto him, not sealed to the 
children of God as was universally 
preached, but on the contrary it was 
evident that God had as much inter- 
est in the people, and in the estab- 
lishment of His Church in this the 
dispensation of the fulness of times, 
as He ever had in any dispensation 
from the beginning of the world.

Revelation, my brethren and sis- 
ters, is a fundamental principle of 
the Gospel of Jesus Christ. We 
cannot deny it unless we deny 
"Mormonism," so-called itself. If 
Joseph Smith did not receive a rev- 
elation from God, and many of 
them, and if heavenly personages 
did not appear to him and others, 
"Mormonism" would have failed be- 
fore this. I shall never, I hope, get 
tired of testifying that God did ap- 
pear to Joseph Smith, that He has 
established His Church in this the 
last dispensation, never more to be 
thrown down or given to another 
people. There will always be a dif- 
ference in the spirit of the people 
who believe in this great principle, 
there will always be a difference in 
their lives, as compared with those 
people who do not believe it, and 
who claim that there is no such 
thing as God revealing Himself to 
man. The ninth of our Articles of 
Faith states that, "We believe all 
that God has revealed, all that He 
does now reveal, and we believe that 
He will yet reveal many great and 
important things pertaining to the 
kingdom of God." 

Very often I have given strangers 
a card on which was printed the 
thirteen Articles of Faith, and how 
often have I had them say to me, 
"There is nothing particularly strik- 
ing in the articles ; the great body 
of Christian people believe in the 
principles that are announced in the 
articles, with the exceptions of one, 
perhaps," the one I have just 
quoted to you. But I want to say 
to you, my brethren and sisters, that 
there are others of the Articles of 
Faith that they do not believe in, or 
at least do not comprehend or under- 
stand their full meaning. The first 
one is: "We believe in God, the 
Eternal Father, and in His Son, 



Jesus Christ, and in the Holy 
Ghost." I take it for granted that 
nearly every one in this gathering 
today was present yesterday when 
our belief in God, His Son Jesus 
Christ and the Holy Ghost was so 
plainly portrayed, and I believe with 
all my heart and soul, the doctrines 
taught by Brother Penrose. When 
strangers have said, "We believe in 
God the Eternal Father," I have 
stated, "Yes, as far as you under- 
stand Him; but our idea, our con- 
ception of God, leads us to believe 
He is entirely a different God from 
the one in whom you believe, whom, 
you say, is a god without body' 
parts or passions." I am not going 
to take the time of the brethren 
and sisters, at this morning's service 
to discuss this question, but I simply 
say, with you, that the God whom 
we worship has passed through all 
the experience that we are now pass- 
ing through. He is an exalted 
being, a personality, and I predict 
the time will come when, instead of 
a handful of people believing in the 
personality of God, the great bodv 
of the people of the world will ac- 
knowledge that fact. 

Perhaps the question of revela- 
tion can be stated in no plainer way, 
conveying the sentiment of hun- 
dreds of thousands of people of this 
country, than was conveyed in the 
statement of Mr. Taylor, who prose- 
cuted what is known as "the Smoot 
case," with a view of expelling me 
from the Senate of the United 
States. In his summing up of the 
testimony and telling why I should 
be expelled from that body, he made 
this statement: 

"Several hundred thousand sincere 
men and women have believed and 
now believe, as they believe in their 
own . existence, that Joseph Smith, Jr 
received revelations direct from God-' 



9<) 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



and if any one ever believed that, we 
must assume that Senator Smoot be- 
believes it. 

"Now, a senator of the United 
States might believe anything else in 
the world but that, and not be inel- 
igible to a seat in the body of which 
he belongs. He might believe in 
polygamy, he might believe that 
murder was commendable, he might 
deny the propriety of a rule of life, of 
all the ten commandments, he might 
believe in the sacrifice of human life, 
he might believe in no God or in a 
thousand gods; he might be Jew or 
Gentile, Mohammedan or Buddhist, 
atheist or pantheist: he might believe 
that the world began last year, and 
would end next year: but to believe, 
with the kind of conviction that Reed 
Smoot possesses, that God speaks to 
him, or may speak to him, is to admit, 
by the inevitable logic of his convic- 
tion, that there is a superior authority 
with whom here and now he may con- 
verse, and whose command he can no 
more refuse to obey than he will him- 
self not to think." 

My brethren and sisters, I frankly 
admit that T believe that God can 
speak to His children in this day 
and dispensation. Had I better put 
it stronger, and say that I know that 
He can? And so do you know it. 
This is one of the great differences 
between a man who belongs to the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints, who has received bap- 
tism by immersion, received the gift 
of the Holy Ghost, and received the 
Priesthood, from those that never 
have had those privileges and bless- 
ings. If we judge from the Bible 
we are perfectly safe in saying there 
has never been a dispensation, from 
Father Adam till the present, that 
God in establishing it has not re- 
vealed Himself to His representa- 
tives, to men who have carried on 
the work : never. And, as the last 
dispensation has been established, 
we are perfectly safe in saying none 
has or will be established without 



God revealing Himself to those 
chosen to accomplish the same. I 
rejoice in the fact that I have this 
testimony. I rejoice in the fact that 
I believe with all my soul the testi- 
money of the Prophet, that God the 
Father spoke to him. 

Revelation is not enjoyed by the 
members of the Church, only. The 
Constitution of the United States 
was revealed from God ; and I can- 
not help but think if the people of 
the world would study the source of 
great discoveries made for the bet- 
terment of the children of men, in 
the sciences and in the arts, they 
would at once admit there was some 
power greater than man that had 
brought them about. The wireless 
telegraphy is a marvel and a won- 
der ; as well as the telephone, by 
which the human voice is now car- 
ried from ocean to ocean. These in- 
ventions did not come about through 
man's wisdom alone. The develop- 
ment of electricity and the transmis- 
sion of thousands of horsepower 
over a small copper wire, for hun- 
dreds of miles away from where the 
power is generated, have been made 
possible through inspiration from 
our Heavenly Father. We need not 
be told, my brethren and sisters, that 
the men who have made these great 
discoveries did not receive inspira- 
tion from a greater source than their 
own brain. If a man places himself 
in a position to receive revelation or 
inspiration from God, seeks it dili- 
gently and honestly, it is often 
granted him, particularly if his heart 
and soul are in attune with God's 
purposes. 

Yesterday we listened to some 
most excellent sermons : and as 
Brother Penrose was speaking I ex- 
pressed the wish that such a sermon 
could be heard by every person in 
the world. I was reading last night 



ELDER REED SMOOT.

a description of the revival meetings 
that are being held by "Billy" Sun- 
day in the larg'e eastern cities, and I 
could not help but contrast the spirit 
of this conference, the testimonies 
that have been borne, and the unity 
of the people, with the account given 
of a typical meeting conducted by 
that man. It may be, my brethren 
and sisters, and I have no doubt it 
is a fact, that something more than 
the delivery of prepared speeches, 
couched in words to tickle the ears 
of the people, must be adopted to 
bring about a testimony in the 
hearts of the people that there is 
something in Christian religion. The 
ministers of the different denomina- 
tions are beginning to recognize the 
fact that some change must be made 
in their services in order to create an 
interest in religion. They unite in 
inviting "Billy" Sunday to come to 
their churches and stir up the peo- 
ple, get them interested in the sub- 
ject of religion with the hope that 
they will become identified with one 
or another of the organized 
churches. But it is my belief that 
no person converted in a moment of 
excitement will ever stay converted 
very long. A knowledge of God is 
necessary to a living conversion, and 
it comes by the still, small voice that 
speaks to the soul, through the in- 
spiration of God, and not by getting 
men to sign pledges in a moment of 
excitement. 

There may be five or ten thousand 
"converted" by one sermon of Mr. 
Sunday, but how long will they re- 
main converted? Most of them 
about as long as it took to convert 
them. I do not sav that he is not 
doing some good. I believe there is 
.some good accomplished by all 
Christian churches. I do not think 
it 'is necessarv for a man who 
preaches the Gospel of Jesus Christ 



to become an acrobat while deliver- 
ing his message. I don't believe that 
such actions as indulged in by Sun- 
day have a tendency to make a man 
think seriously of his God, and the 
step that he is asked to take. It 
would not impress me with the truth 
of his message to have him jump 
upon the velvet-covered stand with 
a view of emphasizing some point in 
his sermon. Rather would I be im- 
pressed by a testimony such as that 
igiven this morning by Brother 
Grant. I know it is such that ap- 
peals to men's hearts. I know they 
will remember it longer. I also 
know that an appeal only to the 
emotions of men, and not to their 
understanding, does not and cannot 
effect a permanent conversion. An 
inward monitor called the con- 
science is possessed by every one. 
No one, old or young, ever com- 
mitted a wrong, at least the first 
wrong, but that his conscience told 
him it was a wrong, and conscience 
acts as an inspiration to man as long 
as he does not blunt it by repeated 
violations of its promptings. 

Men are trying hard to break 
down the fact that God established 
this Church by revelation through 
Joseph Smith. The writings of the 
enemies of the Church are intended 
to create in the minds of neople a 
distrust in the principle of revela- 
tion, and thus prove that no such 
occurrences as related by Toseph 
Smith ever took place ; if their 
efforts wer° successful, the Church 
would cease to be a factor in the 
affairs of the world. There is one 
peculiar thing, and I have noticed 
it not once but many times, that the 
enemies of this people go bevond all 
bounds of reason and truth in their 
criticisms, so much so that anv hon- 
est person knows, when reading 
their attacks, that thev cannot be 



92 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



true. Moderation in our enemies 
would be far more harmful to us 
than the extremes to which they go. 
The Church and its people should 
not be judged by the words of their 
enemies, no more than the Church 
was in the days of our Savior. It is 
well to consider the statements of 
the historian, as well as the testi- 
monies of our friends — compare 
them, study them, and they will 
prove the wisdom, character and 
mission of Joseph Smith the 
Prophet. 

In looking over some of the his- 
tory written against the Prophet 
Joseph Smith, I came across the 
statement made by Professor Hux- 
ley in his ''Agnosticism and Chris- 
tianity." I do not believe it wise 
for us to make as part of our ser- 
mons statements derogatory to the 
mission of Joseph Smith, or falsify- 
ing the position of the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 
and I am not going to read what 
Huxley records, other than the con- 
clusion ; if any of you desire to read 
all of his statement, untrue as it is, 
you may do so. After stating what 
he claims the Prophet to be, he says : 
"He must have been a man of some 
force of character, for a consider- 
able number of disciples soon gath- 
ered around him." Yes, they gath- 
ered about him in increasing num- 
bers as long as he lived. His mem- 
ory is honored, and the Church 
which he established, under the 
guidance of God, is growing, not 
only in numbers but in power in 
many parts of the world. You have 
all read what Josiah Quincy, of the 
class of 1821, I believe, of Harvard 
University, has said about this re- 
markable man, and the probability 
of the future position of this Church. 
He certainly could not be called a 
friend to "Mormonism." It cer- 



tainly could not be claimed that he 
was a defender of the Prophet 
Joseph Smith, and yet it seems to 
me when I read his statement, that 
what he says will have to be ad- 
mitted by all some time in the fu- 
ture. I cannot help but believe that 
he too was inspired. Time forbids 
my reading it to you. Men who 
lived with the Prophet, slept with 
him, men who were willing to die 
with him in defending the truth, 
ought to know about his character 
and his labors and his mission ; and 
who could have expressed it better 
than it was expressed in the auto- 
biography of Parley P. Pratt, giving 
an account of this wonderful man 
and his mission upon the earth. 
Again, let me ask you, my brethren 
and sisters, to read what President 
Young said of him, in the Journal 
of Discourses, telling of his personal 
knowledge of the man that God 
chose to open this dispensation. 

I could go on and multiply such 
testimonies by the hundreds, but 
time forbids. No matter how long 
I live, I never shall forget the many 
times that I heard my father testify 
of his love and loyalty to that re- 
markable man, Joseph Smith. He 
believed in him and in his mission, 
and loved the Gospel of Jesus Christ 
as taught by the Latter-day Saints. 
He was ready and willing, if it be- 
came necessary, to sacrifice his life 
for the cause, as have been thous- 
ands of others. It is my testimony 
to you this day that the world will 
yet acknowledge that Joseph Smith 
was one of the greatest of God's ser- 
vants, that it was he who was or- 
dained to establish God's Church in 
this dispensation. All must admit 
the revelation that was given before 
the Church was organized, foretell- 
ing that a marvelous work and a 
wonder was about to come forth. 



ELDER REED SMOOT.

has been fulfilled. Let the Prophet 
Joseph be judged by the records. 
Xo one can point to a doctrine re- 
vealed to him, and through him to 
the people, that is in conflict with 
the teachings of any of the servants 
of God in any dispensation of this 
world. 

I rejoice with the brethren who 
have preceded me in bearing my 
testimony that God lives, and that 
Jesus the Christ is the actual Son of 
God ; that this work is God's work, 
and that He has His hand over it, 
directing its affairs. Men may come 
and men may go, men may be true 
to the Church, and men may be false 
to it. but it will continue until it has 
fulfilled its mission in the world. 
When that day comes there will be 
no more wars, there will be a- com- 
plete understanding between men, 
there will be greater love in the 
hearts of the children of men for 
one another, and everything that has 
been foretold by all the prophets of 
God will come to pass, and that day 
will come in God's own due time. 
If we are not receiving revelations 
from God today, it is not His fault, 
it is the fault of ourselves. God's 
work and His Church will grow and 
increase just as fast as we. the mem- 
bers of it, are capable of carrying 
out the instructions of God. 

May God's blessings attend us all, 
and may His Holy Spirit be in the 
habitations of the people ; and may 
they pray to Him with the same con- 
fidence and in the same spirit that 
the boy Prophet prayed ninety-five 
years ago. May we have as much 
faith and confidence in God answer- 
ing our prayers as he had ; and all 
the storms from outside, all the op- 
position that may come from any 
source on earth, never can retard the 
growth of the Church that God has 
established. My brethren and sis- 



ters, God bless you, I ask in the 
name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The congregation sang the hymn : 

Redeemer of Israel, 

Our only delight, 
On whom for a blessing we call 
Our shadow by day, 

And our pillar by night, 
Our King, our Deliv'rer, our all! 

Elder William C. Parkinson pro- 
nounced the benediction.

presiding. 

The congregation sang the hymn : 

Guide us, O Thou great lehovah, 
Lead us to the promised land, 

We are weak, but Thou art able — 
Hold us with Thv powerful hand. 

Elder Joseph R. Shepherd of- 
fered the opening prayer. 

The congregation sang the hymn : 

How firm a foundation, ye Saints of 
the Lord, 
Is laid for your faith in His excel- 
lent word! 
What more can He say than to you He 
hath said, 
You who unto Jesus for refuge have 
fled?

that we have carefully audited the 
books and accounts for 1914 of the 
Trustee-in -Trust and of the Presid- 
ing Bishopric ; and have searchingiy 
examined the reports made by the 
various Stakes, Wards, Temples, 
General Auxiliary Organizations 
and all other institutions in which 
the Church is interested. 

From such audit and examination 
we are pleased to be able to report 
that the icceipts and disbursements 
of all Church funds are not only 
fully and accurately accounted for, 
but evidence a most careful and de- 
tailed consideration of the numer- 
ous items which constantly demand 
the attention of the presiding au- 
thorities. 

We feel especially gratified in 
noting the large amounts of money, 
which the liberality of the Saints 
has enabled you to spend for char- 
itable purposes, for the education of 
our youth, and for the promotion of 
God's work on earth, both in build- 
ing temples and meetinghouses at 
home, and in sustaining the vari- 
ous missions abroad in the world. 

Praying God to continue to bless 
you in thus carrying on the work

Faithfulness, peace, and comfort 
among the Saints. — Danger in ex- 
cessive pleasure-seeking. — Need for 
the young to be carefully guarded. — 
Profiting by experiences of former 
peoples. — Modesty in apparel, and 
patronage of home industries advo- 
cated. 

I sincerely trust that the few 
moments I occupy the Lord will 
bless me with strength to make you 
hear, and with ideas that will be 
fruitful of benefit to you, my dear 
brethren and sisters. 

My heart has been made glad dur- 
ing this conference, at the out-pour- 
ing of the Spirit of the Lord, and 
I feel that it has been well for us to 
be together. In the midst of the 
turmoil that exists in the world to- 
day, I have felt to praise my Maker 
for the peace and quiet 'that reigns 
in Israel ; for the blessings that 
abound in this great land of Amer- 
ica ; that our lot has been cast un- 
der the folds of the Stars and 
Stripes, and that our Heavenly 
Father saw fit to plant the feet of 
His people in this grand intermoun- 
tain country. It is a source of satis- 
faction and a testimony of the di- 
vinity of this work that notwith- 
standing the assaults of the adver- 
sary, and the mobbings and drivings 
of the people, they have kept the 
faith and have evidenced, by right 
living, their belief in God and their 
knowledge that He lives. As long 
as we are humble and keep the com- 
mandments of the Lord, there need 
be no anxiety as to the result. The 
danger to us, as it has been to all 
the peoples of God upon the earth, 
is from forsaking humility, lacking 
the charity that should abound in 
the hearts of men, and turning to

selfishness and unrighteousness. 
We have been wonderfully pros- 
pered as a people, and in traveling 
through the stakes of Zion I am 
gratified to see so many living in 
comfortable homes, and that the 
men of our communities are provid- 
ing the comforts and conveniences 
of life for their families. I believe 
this is pleasing to our Heavenly 
Father. 

Some times I wonder if we will 
err, if it is possible that your family 
and mine will make the mistake that 
has been made by the sons and 
daughters of God in the various 
ages of the world, and forsake the 
house of worship for the hot^e of 
pleasure. How are we going to be 
affected, as a people, by the general 
tendency to go to extremes in seek- 
ing amusement ? Pleasure-seeking 
increases among us as the years go 
by. I can remember as a child that 
I felt I was favored if I could have 
one excursion a year out to the 
Lake, and another one to Calder's 
Park. If I could go to one or two 
matinees in a season I was well sat- 
isfied. That left me plenty of time 
to attend my Sabbath School, Mu- 
tual Improvement Association, day 
school, and the other institutions 
provided for my edification and in- 
struction. 

There is a growing tendency in 
this age to live much more rapidly. 
Instead of thinking seriously of the 
purposes of life, many of our young 
people are devoted to light amuse- 
ments. "What shall we do tomor- 
row for fun?" "What shall we do 
next day for pleasure?" Let's go 
to the moving picture show to- 
night." "Let's go to the dance to- 
morrow night." This is the ten- 
dency of their ambition ; and I am 
wondering, my brethren and sisters, 



if. as the guardians of the children 
of the Latter-day Saints, we are as 
prudent and careful as we should be 
in safe-guarding, and in encourag- 
ing them to engage in more import- 
ant pursuits. Our children are the 
most precious gift that our Father 
bestows upon us. If we can guide 
their feet in the path-way of salva- 
tion, there will be joy eternal for 
us and for them ; but if, by reason of 
following after the fashions of the 
•world, or as the prophet predicted, 
it should happen in our clay that our 
children should be lovers of pleasure 
more than lovers of God, it will be 
a sad time for us, because those 
v\ ho pursue pleasure in this life to 
excess are likely to forsake the ways 
of the Lord. I am concerned for 
the youth of Israel ; I feel that we 
yll should be, and should assume the 
duty of looking after the Lord's lit- 
tle ones, teaching and safe-guarding 
them as far as it is possible. 

Some of our people are pattern- 
ing after the follies of the world, 
and are blinded to their danger until 
it is too late. Of the strangers 
who come to live in our midst, many 
are good, faithful, honorable men 
and women, then there is another 
class, who are devoted entirely to 
making money, and riotous living, 
and everything else must take sec- 
ond place. x\musement of every 
kind, and temptation of every kind 
is thereby placed within the reach of 
our children, and the result may be 
in some cases that, if we are not 
careful, we will lose some of them. 
It is your duty and mine to always 
be exemplary in our conduct ; to 
seek to do good to our fellow men, 
to encourage, not only our own chil- 
dren, but the children of our 
neighbor to works of righteousness, 
to honor the Sabbath Day and keep 



96

it holy ; to honor father and mother 
and observe the other command- 
ments that onr Heavenly Father has 
given to us from time to time. That 
is our privilege — nay, that is our 
duty, because the Lord has confer- 
red upon us the priesthood, and has 
given to us a knowledge that He 
lives. Let us look back a few hun- 
dred years and judge of the future 
by the past. Let me read just a few 
verses from the third chapter of 
Isaiah, of what the prophet of God 
foresaw among the people who 
should live after him. He says : 

"Moreover the Lord saith. Because 
the daughters of Zion are haughty, and 
walk with stretched forth necks and 
wanton eyes, walking and mincing as 
they go, and making a tinkling with 
their feet; 

"Therefore the Lord will smite with 
a scab the crown of the head of the 
daughters of Zion, and the Lord will 
discover their secret parts. 

"In that day the Lord will take away 
the bravery of their tinkling orna- 
ments about their feet, and their cauls, 
and their round tires like the moon, 

"The chains, and the bracelets, and 
mufflers, 

"The bonnets, and the ornaments of 
the legs, and the headbands, and the 
tablets, and the earrings, 

"The rings, and nose jewels. 

"The changeable suits of apparel, 
and the mantles, and the wimples, and 
the crisping pins, 

"The glasses, and the fine linen, and 
the hoods, and the veils. 

"And it shall come to r.ass, that in- 
stead of sweet smell there shall be 
stink; and instead of a girdle a rent; 
and instead of well set hair, baldness; 
and instead of a stomacher a girdiner 
of sackcloth; and burning instead of 
beauty. 

"Thy men shall fall hv the sword 
and thy mighty in the war. 

"And her gates shall lament and 
mourn; and she being desolate shall 
sit upon the ground." 

If the prophet had lived in our 
clay, could we better understand 



some of the terms he has used? It 
would almost seem that some of the 
things referred to are the ornaments 
of the present. I wonder, as I look 
back to the time that is past and see 
the destruction that did come upon 
some of those whom the Lord 
warned through His servants, if we 
cannot with profit remember the 
past, and teach and guide our chil- 
dren to avoid similar excesses and 
the sorrow that follows. 

I find also something else in the 
word of the Lord contained in the 
fifth chapter of Alma. He had been 
instructing the people with refer- 
ence to their duties and he strove to 
bless them by teaching what the 
Lord would have them know ; he 
was advising those whose ancestors 
had been miraculously guided across 
the mighty ocean to a land of prom- 
ise. Being a prophet, he was teach- 
ing under the inspiration of the 
Spirit of the Lord. He was evi- 
dently fearful of the result of the 
prosperity of the people and desired 
to save them from threatened dan- 
ger, and these are a few of the 
words that he spoke : "Yea, can ye 
be puffed up in the pride of your 
hearts? Yea, will ye still persist in 
the wearing of costly apparel and 
setting your hearts upon the vain 
things of the world, upon your 
riches?" Those are Alma's words 
to the people who dwelt upon this 
western land, those who had been 
blessed in a remarkable way. I 
would call your attention to the final 
destruction to that people. They 
were blessed of the Lord ; even the 
Savior Himself visited and minis- 
tered unto them, they saw Him and 
heard His voice, and for two hun- 
dred years afterward they were a 
righteous people. They were an in- 
telligent people, too, and highly civ- 
ilized, but they transgressed, and de-

struction followed. Look at the 
scattered bands of Lamanites that 
are in this land of ours today, and 
realize the pinnacle from which 
they fell by reason of disobedience 
to the commandments of God 
through his prophet. It is well for 
us to remember these things be- 
cause the same cause will produce 
the same effect. 

In our day the Lord has cau- 
tioned us again. The forty-second 
section of the Doctrine and Cove- 
nants contains this admonition to 
the Church. This doesn't refer to 
the time of Isaiah nor to the time 
of Alma, but comes right down to 
the day in which we live. Through 
His prophets He admonishes us 
with reference to our duties, and 
among the things He says are these : 
"And again, thou shalt not be proud 
in thy heart ; let all thy garments be 
plain, and their beauty the beauty 
of the work of thine own hands." 
What a splendid thing to contem- 
plate in our community. I would 
like to read that again. This is what 
the Lord advises : "Let all thy gar- 
ments be plain, and their beauty the 
beauty of the work of thine own 
hands." 

Now, my brethren and sisters, I 
think that is worthy of our consid- 
eration. When discussing the high 
cost of living, examine your own 
household, and I am talking to my- 
self while I talk to you. Am I in- 
creasing the cost of living by extrav- 
agance, or am I teaching my fam- 
ily to make the garments they wear ? 
Are we using the materials that are 
at hand, or are we sending across 
the ocean to bring from the nations 
afar expensive things for the adorn- 
ment of our persons? Right here 
in our own community there are 
those who prefer articles manufac- 
tured in distant lands, when right in 



our own neighborhood industries 
are struggling for existence, that 
would do well if we would patronize 
them, and employment would be 
furnished many hands now idle. 
Our factories can produce prac- 
tically all the things that we need, 
and they should be sustained by us. 
That is self-preservation, for we 
would keep our money at home and 
employ our own people. 

Now, I feel, my brethren and sis- 
ters, that this is worth thinking 
about. Look at the clothing worn 
by employes in offices and stores. 
What about the high cost of living? 
Extravagance is responsible for 
much of it. Many of our young 
men and girls when they go to their 
daily employment are attired as if 
they were going to a party. They 
cannot afford it, but beggar them- 
selves to keep up with the demands 
of fashion. I believe we give en- 
tirely too much attention to style, 
rather than to the things that will 
make us God's children eternally. 
We can afford to retrench, and I 
recommend to the Latter-day Saints 
the words of our beloved President 
along that line spoken in this con- 
ference. Let us set an example ; let 
us live within our means ; let us be 
lenders instead of borrowers ; let us 
not place our homes or the lands 
that produce our living under mort- 
gages, in order that we may ride in 
fine conveyances or keep up with the 
pace set by our neighbors who may 
be able to afford it. Let us be more 
concerned about the adornment of 
our minds that are eternal, rather 
than adornment of our persons with 
things that are of no lasting benefit. 
Let us keep the commandments of 
God ; let us live humble, and sweet, 
and pure. Let us not be lifted up in 
the pride of our hearts if we have 
been more successful than our

neighbor financially, but, mindful of 
the blessings of health and strength, 
and the gift of home and loved ones, 
appreciating the knowledge of the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ that is the 
power of God unto salvation, unto 
all those that believe and obey it; 
let us evidence by loving kindness 
to every child of our Heavenly 
Father that we are grateful. 

May the Lord add His blessing; 
may we be righteous exemplars ; 
may His peace be upon all Israel. 
May the spirit of kindness and love 
find its way into the hearts of man- 
kind everywhere, that war may 
cease and peace and happiness 
abound in the world, that from 
shore to shore and from pole to pole 
the Gospel may be preached with- 
out hindrance, and all God's chil- 
dren be called from the error of 
their way and partake of the glor- 
ious blessings that we enjoy in the 
valleys of these mountains, that 
eventually all mankind may rejoice 
in keeping the commandments of 
the Lord and obtain eternal life 
thereby, is my prayer in the name of 
Jesus Christ. Amen. 



ELDER ORSON F. WHITNEY. 

The Gospel — Tts Scope, and the Re- 
sponsibility of those who preach it 
— Spiritual and temporal activities — 
Various ways of preaching — No 
substitute permissible — Human the- 
ory versus divine revelation — The 
heroism of God's people. 

"Woe is unto me if I preach not the 
Gospel." 

So wrote the Apostle Paul to the 
Corinthians. I think I sense in 
some degree the weight of the re- 
sponsibility that Paul found himself 
under. Tt is a responsibility resting 
upon any people who have received 



a like commission from on high, a 
commission to preach the everlast- 
ing Gospel That responsibility rests 
upon the Latter-day Saints. We 
have received the same Gospel that 
Paul received, and are under a simi- 
lar obligation to preach it in all the 
world, as a witness to all nations, 
before the end comes. There is 
nothing so important, so imperative, 
as the delivery of the divine mes- 
sage that has been entrusted to us. 

But what is the Gospel? Do we 
mean by that term faith, repent- 
ance, baptism, and the gift of the 
Holy Ghost, with other principles 
of the religion of Jesus Christ — do 
we mean these, and these alone? 
Is there nothing more to the Gos- 
pel than the laws and ordinances 
thereof, and the preaching and per- 
forming of the same for the salva- 
tion of mankind? 

Last summer I stood upon what 
is called the Land of Zion — Jack- 
son County, Missouri, the spot that 
has been consecrated as the site for 
the City of Zion, the New Jerusa- 
lem, and the gathering thereto of a 
people who shall be prepared for 
the glorious coming of the Lord. I 
stood, in a local sense, upon the 
Land of Zion ; but in a larger sense 
T did not need to go to Jackson 
County, in order to be upon the 
Land of Zion. I was standing upon 
it here in Utah, before I went down 
to Missouri. The whole of Amer- 
ica is the Land of Zion, according 
to the teachings of the Prophet 
Joseph Smith. Even so, while we 
refer specifically to the Gospel, in- 
cluding in that reference such prin- 
ciples as faith, repentance, baptism, 
and the laying' on of hands for the 
gift of the Holy Ghost — while these, 
in a specific sense, are the Gospel, 
in a larger view the Gospel means 
everything connected with the work

of the Lord in which we are taking 
part. 

The very word "Gospel" teaches 
this truth. It springs from an 
Anglo-Saxon term— "Godspell," 
signifying God-story, or the story 
of God. When we speak of the 
Gospel in this greater sense, we 
mean the career of that divine Being 
who left His glorious throne in 
heaven and descended upon this 
planet to die that man might 
live, who became the author of sal- 
vation and the giver of eternal 
glory to all who would believe on 
Him and obey Him. The God-story 
includes the choosing of the Christ 
in the councils of eternity, the cre- 
ation, and the fall of Adam and 
Eve which prepared the way before 
the Savior and His great uplifting- 
work. It includes His death upon 
the Cross, and His resurrection, 
concerning which He said : "Be- 
cause I live ye shall live also." It 
includes all the dispensations of the 
Gospel from the days of Adam to 
the present time. It covers this 
great and final dispensation, which 
will gather to its bosom all former 
dispensations of God's dealings with 
man, and bind them together in one 
harmonious whole. It comprises the 
work of Joseph the Prophet and the 
latter-day restoration of the Gos- 
pel. It extends over the future, 
over the Millennium that is to come, 
the reign of universal peace and 
good will, and over the glorification 
of our planet and its conversion into 
a heaven, the abode of the righteous 
forevermore. These are all parts of 
the great God-story, the Gospel of 
the Lord Jesus Christ. 

The Latter-day Saints have been 
criticised and even ridiculed because 
the Church to which they belong has 
had so much to do with temporal 
things. Men have apostatized in 



times past, and have tried to justify 
their defection from the truth on 
the plea that the Church was en- 
grossed with temporalities — with 
the construction of canals, the build- 
ing of railroads, the extension of 
telegraphs, the founding of co-op- 
erative stores, mills, and factories, 
the institution and promotion of in- 
dustrial enterprises of various kinds. 
As if these things had no connec- 
tion with the work of God and were 
no part of the divine plan for the 
building up of His kingdom. As if 
a desert could be redeemed by 
prayer and prophecy alone ! As if 
colonization and empire-founding 
could be accomplished merely by 
sitting in meeting and singing 
hymns, or by preaching and listen- 
ing to sermons. The Latter-day 
Saints realize that the Gospel em- 
braces temporal as well as spiritual 
duties ; that it is intended to save the 
souls of men ; and that the soul is 
not spirit alone, nor body alone, but 
spirit and body combined. The two 
priesthoods under which this Church 
was organized and by virtue of 
which it carries on its work, are an 
object lesson, teaching the Latter- 
day Saints that they are expected to 
interest themselves in temporal af- 
fairs as well as in spiritual concerns 
— which, after all, include the 
temporal, as the greater includes the. 
less. All God's commandments are 
spiritual, and as such they cover all 
things, the temporal as well as the 
spiritual. Those same apostates, if 
they were here today, would com- 
plain about the water reservoirs, the 
sugar factories, the knitting works, 
and the various other enterprises that 
have been carried on or assisted with 
means voluntarily contributed by the 
Latter-day Saints for the building 
up of Zion. I wonder they did not 
grumble because our people in early 



100 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



days found it necessary to battle 
with crickets and grasshoppers and 
even to fight Indians, in order to 
save themselves from destruction. 
About the only temporal activities 
they did not find fault with were 
gold and silver mining, in which 
they themselves were engaged. 

Our missionaries, our boys, our 
fifteen hundred to two thousand 
striplings who go forth into the 
world to testify that Jesus is the 
Christ and that Joseph Smith is His 
Prophet — they are not the only ones 
who are preaching the Gospel in 
this dispensation. Their fathers and 
mothers who send them means to 
enable them to travel from place to 
place, they are preaching the Gos- 
pel by the assistance thus rendered 
to their sons in the mission field. 
And behind them also — as Brother 
Roberts reminded us in a recent 
meeting — is the great Church that 
sends them forth — a vast spiritual- 
temporal machine for the preaching 
of the Gospel, the saving of souls, 
and the preparation of the world 
for the Savior's coming. Those 
who receive these missionaries into 
their .homes, who feed them and 
help them on their way, are likewise 
preaching the Gospel ; for it can 
be preached in many ways, and by 
example as well as by precept. We 
can all be preachers of it — can all 
tell some part of the great story 
of God and the building up of his 
kingdom. They who pay tithes and 
offerings or otherwise contribute to 
the revenues of the Church, are 
helping to proclaim the message of 
salvation. The larger view need 
only to be taken, and our course is 
vindicated, whether it deals with 
things temporal or things spiritual. 
There is a work for every man, wo- 
man and child in the preaching of 
the Gospel, and woe unto those who 



have had this commission put upon 
them, if they neglect it! We need 
not worry about temporalities ; all 
we need concern ourselves over, is 
whether we are doing our duty 
where God has placed us, and hold- 
ing first in our hearts the interests 
of His work. Never aggrandize 
yourselves at the expense of the 
Kingdom of God. 

We cannot safely substitute any- 
thing for the Gospel. We have no 
right to take the theories of men. 
however scholarly, however learned, 
and set them up as a standard, and 
try to make the Gospel bow down 
to them ; making of them an iron 
bedstead upon which God's truth, if 
not long enough, must be stretched 
out, or if too long, must be chopped 
off — anything to make it fit into the 
system of men's thoughts and the- 
ories ! On the contrary, we should 
hold up the Gospel as the standard 
of truth, and measure thereby the 
theories and opinions of men. What 
God has revealed, what the prophets 
have spoken, what the servants of 
the Lord proclaim when inspired 
by the Holy Ghost, can be de- 
pended upon, for these are the ut- 
terances of a spirit that cannot lie 
and that does not make mistakes ; 
while the teachings of men are often 
based upon sophistry and founded 
upon false reasoning. Uninspired 
men are prone to judge by outward 
appearances, and to allow prejudice 
and plausibilities to usurp the place 
of divine truth as God has made it 
known. 

The Savior declared : "This gos- 
pel of the kingdom shall be preached 
in all the world for a witness unto 
all nations ; and then shall the end 
come." And He gave, as one of the 
signs of His second coming, "wars 
and rumors of wars," which He said 
"must come to pass." Joseph 



ELDER ORSON F. WHITNEY 



101 



Smith supplemented this divine pre- 
diction with the prophecy that war 
would be "poured out upon all na- 
tions ;" the Lord declared through 
him that those who gathered to Zion 
from the various nations would be 
the only people under the whole 
heaven that would not be at war one 
with another, and that they who 
would not take up the sword against 
their neighbor must needs flee unto 
Zion for safety. But last summer, 
as I am told — for I was not present 
— but I am informed that a learned 
gentleman, not of our faith, though 
a very estimable man, a scholar, a 
philosopher, a good and wise teach- 
er, stood up in Salt Lake City and 
declared it to be his conviction that 
there could not be another great 
war upon this earth. The peoples 
of the world were too refined, too 
civilized, too cultured, to permit or 
tolerate anything of the kind ; the 
financiers would not stand for it, 
would not furnish the "sinews of 
war," would, not finance the armies 
and the military movements, and 
consequently such a war could not 
be. Since then the greatest hell of 
conflict that the world has ever 
known has burst forth and now 
wraps Europe in flames. In the 
light of such developments, which 
are you going to depend upon — 
which can you afford to tie to — the 
theories of men or the revelations 
of Almighty God? 

What more eloquent preaching of 
the Gospel has there ever been, in 
this or any previous age, than the 
great gathering movement which 
has been going on since Joseph 
Smith lifted up the standard of the 
restored Gospel in this dispensa- 
tion? There is no more eloquent 
preaching than when men and 
women will forsake their native 
land, their homes, their parents. 



their children, their material pos r 
sessions — every earthly thing, and 
cross the stormy ocean, the heated 
plains, the frosty mountains, many 
of them laying down their lives, to 
be buried in lonely graves by the 
wayside ; pulling hand carts, wading 
rivers, crossing deserts, climbing 
mountains, and settling in a barren 
waste — all for what? Was it for 
gold and silver, houses and lands, 
flocks and herds, and the betterment 
of their temporal condition? Was 
it for the honors of men and the ap- 
plause of the world that they did 
these things ? No, it was because 
they loved God and wanted to build 
up His kingdom. They had heard 
the voice of the Shepherd; they 
were' His sheep, and a stranger 
they would not follow. Yet these 
people, our grandfathers and 
grandmothers, our parents, who 
came from Scandinavia, from 
Germany, from Switzerland, from 
England, Scotland, and Wales, 
from Australia and the islands of 
the sea, from Canada and the 
States of the Union, braving every 
hardship, facing every peril, laying 
their all upon the altar, coming out 
and fighting for God and His divine 
purpose — they are called by some 
"the offscourings of the earth," "the 
scum of creation!" Perhaps it is 
because they "came out on top !" 
(Laughter.) But cream also rises, 
and if I were asked to characterize 
and describe the Latter-day Saints 
who have made such sacrifices, I 
would say they are the cream of 
God's creation — the heroes and the 
heroines of modern times. There is 
no more eloquent preaching of the 
gospel than is found in their toils 
and privations, in their struggles 
and achievements. 

All men will not receive the Gos- 
pel. Some hate the truth, and turn 



102 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



from it instinctively. A man who 
is wallowing in sensuality, giving 
himself up to the gratification of his 
base appetities and desires, he does 
not love the person who comes to 
him and warns him to stop these 
evil practices ; he hates him — hates 
him for the message that he bears, 
for he wants to be let alone to con- 
tinue his wallowing in the mire. 
Such men will not receive the truth 
— unless God puts His Spirit into 
their hearts ; for after all men are 
not converted by preaching, nor by 
anything else than the Spirit of the 
Lord. Some people hate the truth, 
and love darkness rather than light, 
"because their deeds are evil." 

There are others who are clean 
of conduct, and who love the truth, 
or would love it if they could only 
see it. But they are spiritually blind. 
They have listened to lies and slan- 
ders about this work, until they are 
filled with prejudice and cannot see 
clearly. We are surrounded by such 
people here in Salt Lake City and 
elsewhere, and we must be patient 
with them. President Smith says 
that he can love any honest man, no 
matter how much he differs from 
him in opinion. We can all afford 
to follow that example, and be pa- 
tient and kind and forbearing to 
those who do not see just as we see. 

There are still others, who love 
the truth and who recognize it, but 
they dare not espouse it ; they are 
afraid of the social consequences. 
This whole broad land, this whole 
broad world is sprinkled with such 
people. Our boys meet them, and 
our girls, not only in the mission 
field, but in the colleges and univer- 
sities of East and West. When the 
principles of the Gospel are pre- 
sented to them they say, in surprise 
and astonishment: "Is that 'Mor- 
monisrn?" I never dreamed it. Why, 



that is true — I believe it with all my 
heart." And the tears spring to 
their eyes as they acknowledge it. 
But they don't come out in the open 
and fight for it. Why not? Judge 
ye. Brother Smoot truly told us 
that the crying evil of this genera- 
tion is moral cowardice. 

"They are slaves who fear to speak 
For the fallen and the weak; 
They are slaves who will not choose 
Hatred, scoffing and abuse, 
Rather than in silence shrink 
From the truth thfey needs must 
think; 

They are slaves who dare not be 
In the right with two or three." 

I thank God that I belong to a 
people who not only love the truth, 
but who recognized it when it came 
to them and were not ashamed to 
stoop and pick up the diamond from 
the dust. ''Truth is truth, where'er 
'tis found," and a diamond is a dia- 
mond, whether it sparkle in the dust 
at your feet or glitter in the diadem 
of a queen. I thank God that I am 
numbered among a people — that I 
am descended from parents and 
grandparents who not only saw the 
truth, and loved it, but also dared to 
come out and fight for it and suffer 
for it. "Scum of creation," for- 
sooth ! Where, then, will you find 
your heroes and heroines? 

Some day "Mormonism" will be 
popular ; the whole world will follow- 
after it, shouting its praises and eu- 
logizing those who were brave 
enough to befriend it in the days of 
its obscurity. There will be no lack 
of friends and followers in that day ; 
but now is the accepted time, when 
the world is being tested, to see 
whether it will befriend the truth in 
its poverty, and without waiting for 
it to become popular before bowing 
down to it and rendering the hom- 
age that is its due.

"Then to side with truth is noble 

When we share her wretched crust, 
Ere her cause bring fame and profit, 

And 'tis prosperous to be just; 
Then it is the brave man chooses, 

W r hile the coward stands aside, 
Doubting in his abject spirit, 

Till his Lord is crucified, 
And the multitude make virtue 

Of the faith they had denied." 

May God keep us steadfast in the 
truth, and help us to preach the Gos- 
pel and discharge the great respon- 
sibility that rests upon us, the pro- 
claiming of the message of salva- 
tion, by example as well as by pre- 
cept, and may we all endure faithful 
to the end, through Jesus Christ our 
Lord. Amen.

Mutual aid of Church members — 
Those who give offerings, and ob- 
serve to fast, bless themselves — 
Healthful effect of fasting — Fasting, 
a means of attaining self-control — If 
each member of Church donated 
ten cents monthly, all needs of the 
poor could be supplied. 

"Our people are efficient, prosper- 
ous and happy, because we are a 
body who aid One another in the pro- 
ductive life." This expression from 
a recent publication entitled, "The 
Religion worth having," came to me 
this afternoon as I listened to my 
brethren present the various phases 
of this great latter day work. The 
Latter-day Saints are truly a people 
who aid one another in the produc- 
tive life, a life that tends towards 
the salvation of the human being. 
By that salvation I do not mean just 



a place in the hereafter where all our 
cares and worries may cease, but a 
salvation that applies to the indi- 
vidual, to the family and to society 
here and now. Through the Gos- 
pel of Jesus Christ, and the perfect 
organization of the Church as re- 
vealed in this dispensation to the 
Prophet Joseph Smith, we are aid- 
ing one another spiritually by tak- 
ing advantage of the many oppor- 
tunities for service in the Church. 
We are fostering brotherhood by 
activity and association in priest- 
hood quorums, in auxiliary associa- 
tions and in our social gatherings 
and ward reunions. We are aiding 
the young people in securing ivhole- 
some pleasures, by giving them 
sweet and wholesome enjoyment 
under the direction of the priest- 
hood, as it serves particularly in the 
Mutual Improvement Associations 
of the Church as well as in other 
organizations and in the amuse- 
ments under the direction of the au- 
thorities of the ward. The Church 
is aiding in temporal matters and a 
practical benefit is resulting to the 
people today through the united ef- 
forts of the membership of the 
Church. In such ways, and many 
others, the Church fosters the prac- 
tical things of life. 

During the few minutes that I 
stand here this afternoon I desire 
to call attention to the principle 
of Fast Offerings, as one of our 
economic efforts toward aiding one 
another. I mention it because of 
the fact that in the report given by 
our president at the opening of this 
conference, it was stated that $160,- 

000 had been appropriated from the 
tithing fund to aid the worthy poor. 

1 thought at once of this principle 
established by revelation whereby 
all the men and women in the 
Church may not only benefit those. 



104 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



who are in need of financial aid, 
but by so doing may bring blessings 
unto themselves. We are asked, as 
a Church, to fast once a month — to 
refrain from eating from Saturday 
evening meal until Sunday evening 
meal. The requirement is that all 
members of the Church fast that 
day, attend to their meetings, par- 
ticularly their sacrament meeting, 
and in accordance with the revela- 
tion of God, give their oblations, 
render their sacraments and offer 
their prayers to God. We are asked, 
further, to contribute in effect the 
amount of those two meals for the 
benefit of the worthy poor in the 
ward. No stated amount is given, 
each one is left to give voluntarily 
that which he believes he ought to 
give, so that the bishop may have 
in his hands sufficient funds to aid 
those who may be in need. 

Now, it is a little, simple thing, 
and at first thought it does not seem 
to have much of the power of salva- 
tion in it, but like all other principles 
and ordinances of the Gospel of 
Christ, it is associated with the fun- 
damental principles of life and sal- 
vation. That is why I desire to call 
the attention of the presiding au- 
thorities who are before me, as well 
as of all the Saints in Israel, to the 
importance of living up to this re- 
quirement more closely in the future 
than they have done in the past. 
Let us see what it means. 

If we contribute to the bishop the 
value of two meals once a month, 
we are certainly no poorer finan- 
cially than we would be if we had 
-consumed those meals as we reg- 
ularlv do. There cannot be any 
loss to our own family in a financial 
•way, and we have given at least a 
mite towards alleviation of hunger, 
perhaps distress, in some home that 
is less fortunate, less blessed than 



we. There is no loss to us finan- 
cially, no man is poorer, no man is 
deprived of one blessing, no child 
is deprived of anything that he 
would have had if he refrained from 
giving that small contribution. 
Financially then, nobody who gives 
it is any the poorer. 

Physically, we are better off by 
refraining from eating at least once 
a month than we are when we eat 
regularly three meals a day. Time 
will not permit to go into this phase 
of the subject; but I am just re- 
minded now of having read a few 
days ago, the opinion -of one of our 
leading athletes who in his training 
watched the effect of eating three 
regular meals, then of eating two 
regular meals and finally of eating 
one meal daily, regularly, and he 
concludes so far as he is concerned 
that when he ate three meals a day 
he had been eating too much, and 
when so doing he found it neces- 
sary to fast at regular periods in 
order to maintain his vitality to the 
standard possessed when he ate 
more sparingly. Physiology books 
will give us the same lesson. So, 
generally speaking — each individ- 
ual must take this for his own good, 
— but generally speaking no person 
is injured in any way by his depriv- 
ing himself of those two meals on 
Fast Day, but on the contrary he is 
benefitted physically. 

There is still another blessing, 
and here I believe is the most potent 
factor, the most saving power in this 
Fast day requirement. What our 
young people need, what every man 
and woman in this world needs in 
order to keep himself or herself free 
and unspotted from the sins of the 
world, is the power of self-mastery. 
Fach individual should studiously 
practice self-control. It does not 
come all -at once. Nature never 



ELDER DAVID 6. McKAY 



105 



makes cash payments as a whole, 
says William George Jordan. Her 
payments are always made in small 
installments. Those who desire to 
win self-mastery must do it by 
constant application. About the 
only definite command, to fast as 
given in the Law, refers to this prin- 
ciple as an ''affliction of the soul," 
It is associated with spiritual uplift, 
and therein is one of the greatest 
blessings that come to those who 
will fast as God has asked them to. 
Some may say, "Well, that isn't 
much, I cannot see how the refrain- 
ing from partaking of food once a 
month regularly is going to give me 
any self-control." It does, however, 
it is one of the best lessons that 
adults as well as children can prac- 
tice. Appetite is calling, there is a 
yearning and the natural tendency is 
to yield. Teach the child to master 
appetite. Teach him, not harshly, 
but kindly, with the Spirit of the 
Lord, with the spirit in which the 
revelation was given, and you will 
find that in childhood these little les- 
sons in abstinence coming daily to 
your boy. unconsciously are placing 
into his little spirit power that may 
save him from falling in disgrace 
sometime when he is driven on by 
the fire of youth to the very verge of 
the precipice of destruction. Then 
is the time that he will need mastery 
of self and he will have it. Men 
who have studied this principle sug- 
gest that we need to take some such 
lesson as this not onlv weeklv or 
monthly, but daily. ' Mr. Wm. 
George Jordan, savs in that excel- 
lent article, "The Kingship of Self- 
Control" : 

_ "Let us each day do as mere exercises 
in discipline, in moral gymnastics, 
a few facts that are disagreeable to us', 
the doing of which will help us in in- 
stant action in our hour of need. The 



exercises may be very simple, drop- 
ping for a time an intensely interest- 
ing book at the most thrilling pa^e 
of the story, walking home when one 
is able, when the desire is to take a 
street car; talking to some disagree- 
able person and trying to make the 
conversation pleasant. These dailv 
exercises in moral discipline will have 
a wonderous tonic effect on man's 
whole nature. The individual can at- 
tain self-control in great things onl v 
through self-control in little things" 
Unat is in harmony with the sugges- 
tions that Professor James gives in 
Ins excellent article on "Habit " He 
makes practically the same point, by 
saying,] "Be systematically ascetic 
or heroic in little unnecessary points- 
do, every day or two, something for 
no other reason than that you would 
rather not do it; so that when the 
h-our of dire need draws nigh it may 
nnd you not unnerved and untrained 
to stand the test." He says it is some- 
thing like paying an insurance, a fire 
insurance; you may not need it, but if 
ever the fire come you are protected 
by the small payments you have 
given "so it is" he says, "in these 
daily habits of concentrated attention 
energetic volition and self-denial in un- 
necessary things. The man will stand 
like a tower when everything rocks 
around him and when his softer fellow 
mortals are winnowed like chaff in the 
blast." 

Don't think that there is not a 
spiritual significance in the little 
principle of fasting. Don't think 
parents, that you are favoring your 
child when, out of compassion, you 
say, "Oh give him his breakfast; 
oh let us have breakfast ; let us have 
dinner; I have the headache; the 
little boy is too young to go with- 
out his meal," and so on. You don't 
know what you are doing by such 
teaching as that. I want to tell you 
that the children of our Church can 
be so taught this principle of self- 
denial that they will set worthy ex- 
amples to their parents in the ob- 
servance of it. Your little deacons 
particularly — there is a magnificant 



106 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



opportunity for teaching them one 
way of honoring the priesthood. 

Now, what does obedience to this 
requirement mean in aiding those 
who might be in need? It means 
that one hundred sixty thousand 
dollars need not be taken from the 
tithing fund because some of us did 
not comply with the principle of 
fast-offerings ! If you estimate 
those two meals as being worth only 
five cents each — that is all, say that 
you are saving, by refraining from 
eating those two meals, only five 
cents each. If you contribute that 
amount as your offering on fast day, 
your bishop will have sufficient 
funds in his hands to pay out all 
that he needed in 1914 to support 
his worthy poor and will have as 
much more on hand towards help 
for the next year. Five cents a 
meal for each person is not much ; 
surely we ought to do that. This 
would mean $1.20 per capita, an 
amount more than sufficient to 
supply all the present demands for 
the worthy poor in our Church. 
Think what it means and particu- 
larly when we are aiding ourselves 
by doing it. We are losing nothing 
financially ; we are blessing our- 
selves physically, and we are gain- 
ing greater spiritual power, to 
withstand the temptations that we 
meet in life : and best of all, we are 
practicing the very essence of our 
religion ; the true Christ-spirit is 
manifest in that little offering. You 
know what the Savior said when He 
referred to the time when the Son 
of Man shall come in His Glory: 

"Come ye, blessed of My Father, 
inherit the kingdom prepared for you; 
for 1 was an hungered and ye gave 
Me meat; I was naked and ye clothed 
Me; I was thirsty and ye gave Me 
drink; I was sick and in prison and 
ye visited Me; and then they will say: 
Lord, when saw we Thde hungry and 



gave Thee meat? or thirsty and gave 
Thee drink? or naked and clothed 
Thee? or sick and in prison and visited 
Thee? Then will He say to them: 
Inasmuch as ye have done it unto the 
least of these My brethren ye have 
done it unto Me." 

That is in accord with the beauti- 
ful sentiment expressed in the last 
stanza of the hymn that the prophet 
had sung in Carthage jail, just be- 
fore he was martyred. "A Poor 
Wayfaring Man of Grief." You 
remember how he was hungry, 
thirsty, beaten, thrust into prison ; 
and then at last, in a moment, "the 
stranger started from disguise" : 

"The tokens in his hands 1 knew. 
The Savior stood before my eyes; 
He spake and my poor name he 
named, 

Of. me thou hast not been ashamed; 
These deeds shall thy memorial be, 
Fear not, thou didst them unto me." 

God help us to obey these prin- 
ciples more faithfully in the future 
than we have in the past, to be ef- 
ficient, prosperous and happy al- 
ways, because in the strictest sense 
of the word we do all we can, by 
obedience to the principles and or- 
dinances- of the Gospel, to aid one 
another in the productive life ; I ask 
it in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 

ELDER CHARLES A. CALLIS. 

( President of Southern States Mission.) 

In the Doctrine and Covenants, 
the Lord tells us that we offend Him 
when we do not acknowledge His 
hand in the events which shape our 
lives. We live in a day of miracles, 
but unfortunately the hearts of the 
people have waxed gross,, and their 
ears dull, that they do not perceive 
the hand of the Almighty in the 
events which are transpiring. I be-

lieve that the deliverance of Wash- 
ington's army by the fog, when mis- 
fortune faced him, was miraculous, 
as was the cloud and the pillar of 
fire that came between the fleeing 
Israelites and the pursuing Egyp- 
tians. Hundreds of years before the 
coming of the Redeemer in the flesh 
Xephi uttered this splendid proph- 
ecy : "In the day that the prophecies 
of Isaiah shall be fulfilled, men shall 
know of a surety, at the times when 
they shall come to pass." And so 
Jesus said to the people, "If any 
man will do the will of the Father he 
shall know of the doctrine whether 
it be of God or whether I speak of 
myself." Isaiah predicted the com- 
ing of Jesus, he predicted His life's 
work ; and Peter having obeyed the 
will of God could say so grandly to 
his Master, "Thou art the Christ, 
the Son of the living God." When 
Jesus passed away, what power was 
it that upheld Peter and his fellow 
apostles in declaring and testifying, 
and sealing their testimony with 
their life's blood What power was 
it that called them to adhere to this 
testimony? It was the power of 
God. It was the power of the Holy 
Ghost by which, the Prophet Joseph 
tells us, angels speak; therefore they 
speak the truth. 

It must be borne in mind that 
Isaiah predicted the mission of 
Joseph Smith, the prophet of God, 
as well as the .mission of Jesus the 
Redeemer ; and so the prophesy of 
Xephi holds good in this case, too, 
that men should know of a surety 
when all the prophecies of Isaiah 
should be fulfilled. So we behold 
the three witnesses to the Book of 
Mormon, faithful unto death to 
their testimony, speaking in the fear 
of God, because Nephi's promise 
had been richly fulfilled in them, and 
they knew by the power of God, 



what 

son } knew by the gift of the Holy 
and sfr that this book was translated 
bp 1 the gift and power of God. This 
testimony has come to the Saints of 
God, the testimony that they do 
know that Jesus is the Christ, and 
that Joseph Smith was a prophet of 
. God. 

Jesus said, speaking- of His sec- 
ond coming: "And He shall send 
His angels with the great sound of 
a trumpet ; and they shall gather to- 
gether His elect from the four 
winds, from one end of heaven to 
the other." Those angels have come ; 
that mighty angel Moroni brought 
the Book of Mormon; and the 
prophets of God predicted that when 
this book should come forth, in the 
dispensation of the fullness of times, 
the gathering of Israel from their 
long dispersion would commence. 
In the Kirtland Temple, Moses ap- 
peared unto the Prophet Joseph 
Smith and delivered unto him the 
keys of the gathering, and the peo- 
ple of God are engaged in this great, 
this noble, this mighty work, sup- 
ported by the knowledge, by the 
surety that this work is of God and 
that it is the power of God unto 
salvation. Look at the ministry of 
the elders in the field, your sons and 
daughters, my brethren and sisters. 
Truly their ministry is a miracle, 
when we contemplate the fact that 
they are there in the world outside, 
you might say, of the sphere of in- 
fluence which the priesthood wields 
at home. Men have said that the 
elders belong to the Church largely, 
because of their fathers and their 
mothers, because of the influence of 
the authorities of the Church. Then 
I ask, what power sustains them in 
the world when surrounded by 
strangers, by enemies in many 
cases? What power sustains them 
in delivering their testimony? What 



108 



GENERAL^ CONFERENCE. 



power magnifies them in the-ne 
of the people, and blesses them i 
power and influence in the pfeir. .- 
ing of the Gospel? It is the power 
of the Christ. Not long ago I stood 
on the streets of Ohio assisting a 
young elder to hold an open-air 
meeting. As that boy, 20 years old, 
stood before that vast congregation, 
preaching the Gospel, with the love 
of God and innocence stamped upon 
his features, the tears flowed from 
my eyes, and I said to myself, would 
to God that his father and mother 
could look upon their son at this 
moment. 

The spirit, the missionary spirit, 
is in this Church ; it is the greatest 
spirit of all. Why? Because this 
Church has a mission ; it is the great 
missionary in the world to prepare 
a people for the second coming of 
the Son of God. Last fall the 
Southern States Mission was hon- 
ored by the visit of President Joseph 
F. Smith. President Charles W. 
Penrose, Elders George Albert 
Smith and Joseph F. Smith, Jr.. of 
the Twelve, and the Presiding 
F>ishop, G. W. Nibley. In the great 
cities of Memphis. Chattanooga, At- 
lanta, and Jacksonville, the people 
turned out in multitudes to listen to 
the word of the Lord. Up to that 
time no general public invitation of 
that kind had been issued to the 
people of those great cities ; and 
when the President of the Church 
stood there and preached the Gos- 
pel to those congregations of Gen- 
tiles to men who were prominent in 
the business and professional life of 
those cities, to men who stood high 
in society and in governmental af- 
fairs, when T heard the President of 
the Church and his counselor, and 
the other brethren, preach the Gos- 
pel to them as missionaries, in the 
true missionary spirit. I felt to re- 



joice, because I knew that God was 
with His servants and that they 
were delivering His message to the 
people. 

Talk about their being something 
in "Mormonism !" Why, the Gen- 
tiles know there is something in 
"Mormonism." If every man, not 
in the Church, who believes that 
Joseph Smith is a prophet of God, 
I say, if every man who believes that 
Joseph Smith is a prophet of God 
would come into the Church, the 
membership of this Church would 
be added to by tens of thousands ; 
for the knowledge that Joseph was 
a prophet is deepening in the world, 
it is taking hold of the minds of 
men. This Book of Mormon, with 
the Bible, is confounding false doc- 
trine ; it is opening the eyes of the 
people ; it is causing those that 
erred to come to understanding ; it is 
causing those that murmur to learn 
doctrine and be blessed of the Lord. 
One of our Southern statesmen told 
President Smith that he had been to 
Utah, he said: "President Smith, 
as 1 surveyed the achievements of 
your people, as I looked at what 
*Mormonism' had done for the peo- 
ple, and what it had done for the 
country, 1 felt that there was power 
in 'Mormonism,' and power for 
good." My brethren and sisters, 
that statesman who declared that 
truth is only one of many who feel 
the same way. 

I rejoice in the glory of God. I 
love to see this Church grow in in- 
fluence and in power. When men 
honor my leaders, the leaders of this 
Church, they honor me; for as we 
help tO build up the work of the 
Lord we build up ourselves. This 
people must rise as a people, some 
must not pull down while others lift 
up : we must all rise together, keep 
the commandments of God and dis-

charge our duties. I thank God for 
this missionary spirit. I bear you 
my testimony, my brethren and sis- 
ters, that the authorities of this 
Church have the missionary spirit, 
and in that spirit this people will 
succeed. In that faith they will go 
forth to perfection. 

I beg of you, fathers and mothers, 
to write good letters to your sons ; 
write them Gospel letters, not 
gossip. Write them good Gospel 
letters, filled with the spirit, and 
filled with encouragement. Oh the 
beautiful letters that come from the 
mothers ! What splendid faith they 
have. It happens once in awhile, 
that an elder lays down his life in 
the field ; he dies at his post of duty. 
I tell you, my brethren and sisters, 
the faith of the mother rises to 
heights of sublimity. Her son, who 
is to his mother even as the apple 
of her eye, is brought home to her 
in death. That mother's sublime 
faith — it pierces the heavens, so to 
speak, and she beholds, in her sor- 
row, the power of God, and with an 
eye of faith, which all the mothers 
of Israel have, she looks upon her 
son, cold in death, yet she knows 
that God's rich promises in her son 
shall be fulfilled in God's own time 
and in His way. She knows that 



what God has begun in her darling 
son He will finish in glory, in honor, 
and in exaltation ; for she knows the 
holy ordinances by which this may 
be brought about. 

I desire to praise the Lord all the 
days of my life. I love God ; I love 
my brethren ; I love the people of 
the Lord; for they are the best 
people on the face of the earth. 

"I'll praise my Maker, while I've 
breath, 

And when my voice is lost in death 
Praise shall employ my noblest 
powers, 

My days of praise shall ne'er be past, 
While life and thought and being last 
Or immortality endures." 

Amen. 



The congregation sang the hymn : 

TheSpirit of God like a fire is burn- 
ing! 

The latter-day glory begins to come 
forth; 

The visions and blessings of old are 
returning, 
And angels are coming to visit the 
earth. 

Benediction was pronounced by 
Elder Walter P. Monson. 

Conference adjourned until Tues- 
day, April 6th, at 10 a. m. 



THIRD DAY. 



Conference was resumed in the 
Tabernacle, at 10 a. m., Tuesday, 
April 6th ; President Joseph F. 
Smith presiding. 

The congregation sang the hymn : 

O ye mountains high, where the clear 
blue sky- 
Arches over the vales of the free, 
Where the pure breezes blow and the 
clear streamlets flow, 
How I've longed to your bosom to 
flee. 

Elder John L. Herrick offered the 
opening prayer. 

The congregation sang the hymn : 

Now let us rejoice in the day of salva- 
tion ; 

No longer as stFangers on earth 

need we roam. 
Good tidings are sounding to us and 

each nation, 
And shortly the hour of redemption 

will come. 

ELDER ANTHONY W. IVINS. 

Evidences that "a great and marvelous 
work" has come forth — World-wide 
proclamation of the Gospel — Un- 
paralleled gathering from all na- 
tions — Many millions yet to be 
warned — Saints should be interested 
in national welfare — Righteousness 
needed in the nation, as in the 
Church. 

"Now, behold a great and marvel- 
ous work is about to come forth 
among the children of men. There- 
fore, O yet that embark in the service 
of God, see that ye serve Him with 
all your heart, might, mind and 
strength, that ye may stand blameless 
before God at the last day." 

T suppose, my brethren and sis- 



ters, that the varied exercises of this 
conference, the words of inspira- 
tion which have been spoken, have 
prompted us to think upon a variety 
of subjects. There has been some 
outstanding thought, perhaps, in all 
of our minds, varying as the dif- 
ferent subjects, all of which are of 
very great importance, have been 
treated. It has been so with me. 
From the opening session of the 
conference, when the President of 
the Church made that splendid re- 
port of its condition, I have been 
thinking of these words of the Lord 
which I have read. This revelation 
was given more than a year before 
the organization of the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 
The Church had not come into 
existence as a recognized body. The 
Book of Mormon had been pub- 
lished ; a few men and women had 
been converted to the truth, and to 
the divinity of the mission of the 
boy prophet, who had translated and 
published it to the world. More 
than a year later, when the Church 
was finally organized, there were but 
six persons present who were recog- 
nized as participating in that organ- 
ization, that were members of the 
Church. The total wealth of those 
people combined was scarcely suf- 
ficient to print the Book of Mormon 
and offer it to the world, and yet 
upon that little handful of men and 
women devolved the mission of pro- 
claiming to the world the opening 
of this Gospel dispensation, and the 
appearance of the Father and the 
Son. Their mission was to con-

found false doctrine, to proclaim 
truth, and lay the foundations for 
the establishment of God's kingdom 
upon earth. 

I have been looking - backward 
over these eighty-five years of the 
existence of the Church. I have 
been making some comparisons. I 
have been asking myself the ques- 
tion, have these words of the Lord, 
which were spoken before the or- 
ganization of the Church, been ful- 
filled, -were they true? And I re- 
membered that during those eighty- 
five years, from that little handful 
of people have come the multitude 
who make up the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints ; I re- 
membered that the Gospel had been 
preached in every state of this 
Union : that it had been preached in 
Mexico and Canada, and had been 
carried to South America ; that it 
had been preached in the Scandi- 
navian countries of northern Eur- 
ope, where multitudes of men and 
women, Israelites and heirs to the 
Gospel by right of the promise, have 
been brought into the fold of Christ, 
and numbered among the Saints of 
God ; that it had been preached in 
Germany, in Belgium, in Holland, 
in a limited degree in France, in the 
British Isles, and in the Turkish 
Empire : that it had been carried to 
India; not much done in China, but 
has been carried to the empire of 
Japan, and to all the Polynesian 
islands of the Pacific. Many thou- 
sands of people have believed and 
obeyed it ; inspired by the Spirit of 
the Lord they have been gathered 
together here in the tops of the 
mountains. Driven from place to 
place, in poverty, in distress, the 
Church was bodily moved from the 
east and planted here in these moun- 
tains, with the result which we see 
todav. 



There are scores of individuals 
in the Church today each of whom 
possess greater wealth than its en- 
tire membership did at the time that 
these words of the Lord were ut- 
tered. The Gospel has been preach- 
ed almost everywhere. There is not, 
I believe I am safe in saying, in the 
history of the world, a parallel to it. 
Greater multitudes of people may 
have been converted to the truth in 
other Gospel dispensations, but if 
so, that conversion occurred in their 
own immediate vicinity and neigh- 
borhood. To have covered the civ- 
ilized world, to have circumnavi- 
gated the earth, and above all, to 
have brought together these peo- 
ple from different nations, planting 
them in communities, strangers to 
each other by nationality and birth, 
and establish harmony, union, one 
purpose," that being the accomplish- 
ment of God's will in the earth, I 
say that no such thing has ever been 
undertaken and successfully ac- 
complished before in the world's 
history. A great and marvelous 
work was about to come forth, and 
I believe that we are justified in 
saying, not boasting, but in humility 
before the Lord, and giving Him 
credit for all that has been accom- 
plished, that He has vindicated His 
word, and that a great and marvel- 
ous work has been accomplished 
through the ministry of His ser- 
vants, endowed with the Holy 
Priesthood, as they have gone out 
from His Church, and promulgated 
the truths of His Gospel in the 
world. 

So much for the past. Now, when 
we contemplate these conditions, 
these splendid results, are we justi- 
fied in saying that we have done 
enough, that the work of the Lord 
is finished, that there is nothing 
more for Latter-day Saints to do?

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



I believe that there is no condition 
so dangerous, either to an individ- 
ual, a community, or a nation, as 
that which leads him to believe that 
he has reached the point where there 
is nothing more to do, nothing more 
to be accomplished, no farther 
progress, no development ; that very 
moment retrogression begins. So 
I see before me, just as I regard the 
accomplishments of the past a mir- 
acle wrought by the hand of God, as 
I look into the future greater works 
to be done, demanding our atten- 
tion, our energy, the exercise of our 
faith and all the power that we can 
get from the Father. While it is 
true that the Gospel has thus been 
generally preached in the world, it 
is also true that but a very small 
proportion of the inhabitants of the 
earth have yet heard it, or looked 
upon the face of a man bearing the 
Priesthood, and authorized to speak 
in the name of the Lord in this dis- 
pensation ; millions of people in our 
own country must hear the truth, 
millions of people in the old world, 
the empires of Russia, China, and 
India; millions of people who are 
in Mexico, Central and South Amer- 
ica must hear the Gospel, as we 
have heard it. 

One of the great future accomp- 
lishments of this Church, and one 
which devolves upon us, is the 
preaching of the Gospel of the Re- 
deemer to the scattered remnants of 
the House of Israel. I am a be- 
liever in the word of the Lord. I 
believe the things that are written 
in this book from which T read, the 
Doctrine and Covenants. I believe 
the promises of God as they are con- 
tained here in this Book of Mor- 
mon. What a strength that book 
has been to me ! How I have 
thanked the Lord for it, for it has 
taught me the better way of life. It 



deals plainly with the doctrines of 
the Gospel, teaches me my duty as 
a member of the Church, teaches me 
my duty to the state, teaches me my 
duty to my fellow man, and if the 
things contained there are true, just 
as^ certain as the sun shines in yon- 
der heaven, so will the remnant who 
have descended from the men who 
wrote it, be brought to a knowl- 
edge of the truth of the Gospel of 
the Redeemer, come into the Church 
and be numbered with the Saints 
of God. The Lord has promised it, 
unconditionally ; that is to say, un- 
conditionally except as it depends 
upon their repentance, but that they 
will repent He has told us in the 
most definite manner, and there are 
millions of them around us, my 
brethren and sisters. These Laman- 
ites, are heirs to the promises, and 
God has said, without qualification, 
that He will give this land to them 
for an everlasting inheritance, that 
they shall be, with us, the builders 
of the New Jerusalem ; the powers 
of heaven shall be among them, and 
they shall know the record of their 
fathers which has been brought to 
US through the instrumentality of 
the Prophet Joseph Smith. I could 
read to you from this same book the 
word of the Lord in regard to that. 
Perhaps I had better do it, because 
I like to justify what I say. by the 
word of the Lord : 

"Nevertheless, My work shall go 
forth, for inasmuch as the knowledge 
of a Savior has come unto the world, 
through the testimony of the Jews, 
even so shall the knowledge of a 
Savior come unto My people. 

"And to the Nephites, and the 
Jacobites, and the Josephites, and the 
Zoramites, through the testimony of 
their fathers — 

"And this testimony shall come to 
the knowledge of the Lamanites, and 
the Lemuelites, and the Ishmaelites, 



ELDER ANTHONY IV. IVINS. 



113 



who dwindled in unbelief because of 
the iniquity of their fathers, whom 
the Lord has suffered to destroy their 
brethren, the Nephites, because of 
their iniquities and their abomina- 
tions; 

'And for this very purpose are these 
plates preserved, which contain these 
records, that the promises of the 
Lord might be fulfilled which He made 
to His people." (Doc. and Cov. Sec. 
3:16-19.) 

This also was revealed to us be- 
fore the organization of the Church, 
so this great mission is upon us. 
The Lord expects us to perform it, 
and He will hold us responsible if 
we shall fail. And that is but a 
small part of our mission. Scat- 
tered among the nations of the earth 
are the house of Judah, the chosen 
people of the Lord. How long shall 
they continue, how long shall they 
suffer, how long shall they be a hiss 
and a by-word among the nations 
of the earth, because of transgres- 
sions of their fathers? This Book of 
Mormon, thank the Lord, gives them 
hope also, and I cry to the Lord 
that He will prepare their hearts, 
for the Redeemer testifies here 
that when these things come forth 
the Jews shall begin to believe, they 
shall begin to turn to Christ and 
recognize Him as their 'Redeemer, 
the Messiah. Just as certainly as 
they have been scattered, so will 
the Lord gather them together 
again, and restore to them the lands 
of their possessions, and they shall 
forever serve Him and honor Him 
as their fathers did in the begin- 
ning; and they must come through 
the efforts of the Latter-day Saints. 

So I say, brethren and sisters, 
there is plenty to do; we are not to 
be at ease in Zion ; we are not to 
say that the work of the Lord has 
been accomplished, and that there 
is nothing more to do, and those 



are the very things which the 
prophet, in this Book of Mormon, 
warns us against, and says that 
some of us will say; but we must 
continue to work. These are the 
things that I see in the future, that 
are abroad ; and as we preach the 
Gospel abroad so is it our duty to 
provide for, and assist, as we have 
hitherto done, those of our brethren 
and sisters who gather up to Zion 
from the nations of the earth, that 
they, like us, may become inde- 
pendent men and women. If there 
was nothing else in the history of 
the Church but that one fact, tens 
of thousands of people taken from 
the sweat houses of Europe, where 
they or their children never could 
have become independent men and 
women, have been brought here, 
planted upon this promised land, 
where they could become a part of 
it, owning it, claiming it as their 
own, under the permission of God 
our Father, by whom we hold all 
things, and have become independ- 
ent, loyal citizens of this good gov- 
ernment of ours. That work must 
continue. We cannot abandon it. 
So it seems to me that notwithstand- 
ing the magnitude of the work 
which was before the Church at the 
time of its inception, there is a 
greater field before us today than 
there ever has been before in its his- 
tory. 

There are other things for us to 
do, for our loyalty is not to the 
Church alone. We are here, we say, 
under the best government in the 
world and I believe it, and thank the 
Lord for it, a government, we say, 
which was established under the in- 
spiration of the Lord Himself, and 
I believe it ; we are citizens of that 
government. I never have been able 
to conceive that it is possible for me 
to be an acceptable member of the 



114 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Church in the sight of God, my 
Father, except that I am a devoted 
supporter of my country and its in- 
stitutions, honoring, obeying, and 
sustaining its laws, and just as I 
labor for the spread of the truth, 
just as I seek to bring people to a 
knowledge of it, so is it my duty 
to labor for the establishment of 
righteous government in the land in 
which I live. The Church and the 
State are so intimately associated 
that in my mind I cannot separate 
them, for I believe that without the 
State the Church could accomplish 
little, and that without the influence 
of religion, those restraining influ- 
ences which come through faith in 
God, and acknowledgement of our 
Redeemer as the Savior of the 
world, it is at least an excedingly 
difficult thing that good government 
may be established and maintained 
in the world. So T must labor for 
better citizenship. Isn't that true? 
Justice, temperance, and truth are 
the fundamental doctrines of all 
good government : and if I see those 
doctrines threatened, is it not my 
duty to oppose their enemies? It 
seems to me that it is. Pageants 
may parade the streets, artists and 
poets may immortalize freedom on 
canvass and in verse, but unless the 
things that we do are in harmony 
with that which we say. "it is like 
sounding brass of a tinkling cym- 
bal." And so I say that so long as 
there are in this great nation of ours 
men and women who cry for bread, 
who seek employment in vain, while 
others indulge in the extravagant 
accumulation and use of wealth : so 
long as our prisons are filled with 
men and women who defy the law, 
and those rules which are estab- 
lished for the security of society; so 
long as men in this free govern- 
ment shall deliberately ignore and 



defeat the will of the people whom 
they pretend to represent ; so long 
as there shall remain in this land of 
ours a single house of assignation, 
where the souls and bodies of wo- 
men are bartered for gold ; so long 
as there shall remain upon the op- 
posite sides of the streets from 
where houses of prayer are built, 
chapels of the devil, which, with 
open doors beckon your sons and 
invite them in, that they may be- 
come drunken and corrupted, their 
bodies and souls endangered ; — I 
say, so long as these conditions con- 
tinue there is work to do, for every 
man and woman who has taken up- 
on him or her the name of the Re- 
deemer. I do not wish to be re- 
garded as an agitator, I do not wish 
to be regarded as an extremist ; but 
my brethren and sisters, if I see 
these things as I move about among 
the cities of this country, is it my 
duty to be silent, or is it my duty, 
as a professed teacher of righteous- 
ness, to call attention to them, in 
order that they may be corrected? 
When men sell their votes by thou- 
sands, and ambitious men buy them 
in order that they may be magnified 
before the people ; and attain to 
those places of trust where your 
very lives and liberties are at stake, 
as occurred in the last election in 
one of the greatest states of this re- 
public, it seems to me that there is 
something to do; and if I see these 
forces which are making as surely 
for the disintegration of this gov- 
ernment as they ever made for the 
disintegration of governments that 
have existed before it. \ cannot re- 
strain the feeling which I have that 
it is my duty to call attention to 
them, not to complain, but in the 
hope that seeing them we may re- 
form. 

Just the other day a ship struck 



ELDER ANTHONY W. IVINS. 



115 



upon a rock, an uncharted reef, off 
the coast of California, and was 
wrecked. No one knew the rock 
was there before, but the captain of 
the vessel knows it now ; he knew 
when he struck it. Would it be 
proper for him to go away and say, 
"That hidden rock is there, but 
never mind, I won't say anything 
about it, I will just let somebody 
else come along and run their ship 
onto it, and be wrecked as I have 
been?" No, he puts it on the chart, 
so that the next mariner who comes 
knows that he must avoid that spot. 

So, my brethren and sisters, if 
you will read the word of the Lord, 
if you will be admonished by the 
prophecies contained in these books, 
if you will study the history of the 
nations that have lived before you, 
you will know that there is just one 
thing that makes for security, and 
that thing is righteousness and truth 
in the Church, in the State, in busi- 
ness, and in the life of every indi- 
vidual who pretends to serve his 
people, or to serve the Lord. That 
is all that I wanted to urge, just 
that there be righteousness, that 
there be integrity, that there be 
honesty. When I see the great 
work which is before us, and con- 
trast it with the past, I feel like 
buckling up my belt one hole 
shorter, as the Indian does when he 
lacks a meal, and going on with the 
fight. The battle with sin is real. 
Don't deceive yourselves by think- 
ing that the devil is dead. He is 
very much alive ; he knows the 
truth, he fears it, he trembles but 
he will never obey it until he is 
bound with chains and put where 
he belongs. And there are thou- 
sands of men in this country who 
are just as unconvertible as Lucifier 
himself, because they are his agents ; 



I would that they could all be con- 
verted to the Gospel of Christ; but' 
if that is impossible then I regard 
it to be my duty, as a citizen of this 
country, to see to it that just and 
merciful laws be enacted, so that if 
a man refuses to yield to reason, if 
he refuses to be converted to the 
truth, he may be restrained by force 
and put where he belongs, that he 
cease to be a menace to his fellow 
citizens. 

The Lord bless you, my brethren 
and sisters, guide us in the right 
way. Oh, how precious is the 
Spirit of God our Father, that leads 
us unto all truth ! I pray for it ; I 
need it myself every moment ; you 
need it. If you are guided by it 
you never will go astray, but you 
will feel as I do that in this fight 
with sin you had better die in the 
trenches, for that is where we all 
are, we are right in the trenches, in 
the first ranks ; better die there, as 
those Belgians died, than that we 
compromise with the devil to obtain 
peace, for he never keeps any con- 
tract that he makes, he never did, he 
never will, and if you accede to him 
one iota, you are like the fly that 
goes into the web of the spider, you 
become so entangled that you never 
can escape, and there you die. God 
help us carry on this magnificent 
work until His purposes are ac- 
complished, until the destiny of the 
Church is fulfilled, until the state is 
purified and we prepared, both re- 
ligiously and civilly, for the king- 
dom and coming of the Lord, that 
His will may be done on earth as it 
is in heaven, I pray through Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 

Elder Melvin Ballard sang a 
hymn entitled, "Come near me, O 
my Savior."

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS. 

Faithful continuance in righteous liv- 
ing essential to salvation — Obedi- 
ence to the law of tithing enjoined — 
— Need for missionary work among 
the Saints at home. 

"If in this life only we have hope 
in Christ, we are of all men most 
miserable." So said the Apostle 
Paul in his Epistle to the Corinthi- 
ans. The Latter-day Saints have 
hope in Christ beyond this life; yea 
an assurance that through Him we 
wilf live again ; that is to say, we 
will be resurrected after death, as 
He was resurrected ; and not only 
this, but we have hope in Christ and 
an assurance that we will be saved 
and exalted through Him, by keep- 
ing His laws and commandments. 
I think the Latter-day Saints under- 
stand, too, for they have been well 
taught, that this does not mean 
merely the accepting of the first 
principles and ordinances of the 
Gospel, but that we be true and 
faithful in keeping all of the com- 
mandments, obeying all of the laws, 
and that we continue, faithful unto 
the end. We preach the Gospel in 
the world, and tell the people that 
something more than faith is neces- 
sary to salvation, His command- 
ments must be obeyed. T have 
thought that we have need, my 
brethren and sisters, of being taught 
at home that faith alone is not all 
that is necessary to salvation, there 
are so many of our people who seem 
to be satisfied with only their faith, 
and the acceptance of the first prin- 
ciples and ordinances of the Gospel. 
There are many, who have never 
had sufficient faith to live the laws 
of the Lord, making them worthy to 
go up to the temple and receive the 
higher ordinances and greater bless- 
ings which are in store for the faith- 
ful. 



One of the laws which the Lord 
has given us, and which is neces- 
sary for the salvation of His chil- 
dren and for the welfare of His 
work, is the law of tithing. There 
are many thousands of Latter-day 
Saints who have been true and 
faithful in observing this law, who 
pay their tithing regularly, faith- 
fully and fully. There are others, 
counted by the thousands — twenty- 
two thousand, to be more definite, 
in the Church, who have had means 
which should have been tithed, and 
they have not paid a cent of tithing 
during the past year. They have 
been moving along, recognized as 
members of the Church, but they are 
not doing their full duty. They are 
wanting in faith to do the works 
which are necessary to salvation. It 
is our hope in Christ that we will- 
obtain salvation and eternal life by 
doing these things which He has 
commanded us to do, things which 
are right for us to do. Who will 
say that it is not right for every 
member of the Church, according to 
his financial strength, to aid in the 
building up of the kingdom with his 
finances ; and is not that what the 
Lord has required in this law? He 
does not ask one to do that which 
he cannot do. There is no one 
asked to pay a dollar's tithing until 
he has received ten dollars ; or ten 
cents tithing until he has received a 
dollar to be tithed. If we would 
pay our tithing as we receive our 
income, or interest, we would al- 
ways have something to pay as tith- 
ing. Who will pretend to say that 
it is not a just law? If this kingdom 
were on wheels, and it were possible 
for the Latter-day Saints to roll it 
forth by pushing and pulling, would 
we expect of the physically weak 
man or woman to push or pull as 
much as the one who is physically 



ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS. 



117 



strong? Why, certainly not. A lit- 
tle child ought to comprehend that 
principle. Of course, where much 
is given much is expected. 

I would ask you, brethren and sis- 
ters of the Church, if a person, being 
a member of any organization which 
is effected for the common good of 
its members, is considered a good 
member of that organization, if he 
will not do his part in carrying it 
on? If finances are necessary he 
will be expected to do his part in a 
financial way. What of those who 
would reap the benefits of the or- 
ganization, and refuse to do their 
part in maintaining it? I say, the 
law of tithing is a just, and right- 
eous law of God, it is our Father's 
provision for the carrying on of His 
work, in large measure, and His 
distribution of the financial respon- 
sibility of it, among His sons and 
daughters who have covenanted to 
obey Him. Now, since we .have 
twenty-two thousand men and wo- 
men who have means which should 
be tithed, and who refuse to pay 
their tithing, and who otherwise 
manifest their religious indifference, 
we have need of work at home as 
well as abroad. 

There are two great arms, at 
least, to this work, and the responsi- 
bility which rests upon us as Latter- 
day Saints, is the preaching of the 
Gospel to the nations of the earth, 
and the preaching of the Gospel to 
the people at home. The Lord said 
to His Prophet Ezekiel : 

"I have made thee a watchman unto 
the house of Israel," as we elders are 
watchmen. "When a righteous man 
turns from his righteousness and com- 
mit iniquity,and I lay a stumbling block 
before him, he shall die; because thou 
hast not given him warning.he shall die 
in his sin and his righteousness which 
he hath done shall not be remembered; 
but his blood will I require at thine 



hand. Nevertheless if thou warn 
the righteous man that the righteous 
sin not and he does not sin, he shall 
surely live, because he is warned; also 
thou hast delivered thy soul." (Ezek. 
3:20, 21.) 

There are men and women who 
have at some time repented of their 
sins, who made a good beginning, in 
this work, in embracing the Gospel, 
who have departed from their 
righteous ways, and are going into 
spiritual darkness, and it is for us to 
care properly for these people. I 
am asked, by stake presidents, when 
I go into their stakes, "What can 
we do to get these, our brethren and 
sisters whose names are on the non- 
tithe payers' list, to pay their tith- 
ing?" I have had to say, "I sup- 
pose that they are not able to take 
meat ; they need milk ; we will have 
to begin over again and convert 
them by preaching to them the first 
principles of the Gospel, and, when 
they get sufficient faith, then we 
may hope that they will live this and 
other laws." 

The non-observance of this prin- 
ciple of tithing is only one of the in- 
dications that there is need of con- 
stant labor at home in the stakes 
and wards of Zion. For instance, 
according to the reports which we 
have, there are in the stakes of the 
Church, a population of 372,000, 
and according to the statistics, only 
about fifty per cent of these men, 
women and children attend a re- 
ligious meeting upon the Sabbath 
day, including the Sunday School. 
Where are the 186,000 every Sab- 
bath day, who ought to be worship- 
ing the Lord? Isn't there some- 
thing for us to do? Of the 92,000 
male members who hold the Priest- 
hood in this Church, we are told 
that 29,000 of them are inactive; 
that 27,000 of them, during the year 



118 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



1914, did not attend a single 
quorum meeting. Is there not 
something for us to do? 

The hope we have in Christ, my 
brethren and sisters, is that we will 
obtain salvation, not by neglecting 
these duties, not by disregarding the 
commandments of the Lord, but by 
being true and faithful in keeping 
them all, and in laboring for the sal- 
vation of others. I feel that it is 
true religion and undefiled that we 
minister to the souls of men, for 
their salvation, at home as well as 
abroad, and in this ministry we 
establish ourselves in the faith, and 
anchor our souls in salvation. 

The Lord bless these hundreds 
and thousands of faithful workers 
in the Church, that they may be un- 
tiring, and the Lord bless those who 
are wanting in faith, and help them 
to keep His commandments, con- 
tinuing faithful unto the end, that 
they may receive salvation through 
Christ, our Savior, I pray. Amen. 



ELDER JOSEPH F. SMITH, JR. 

A summary of belief in doctrines of 
the Gospel — Temple ordinances es- 
sential to exaltation, for living and 
dead — Duty of Church members to 
love one another, and help all man- 
kind. 

It is always a pleasure to me to 
hear the Gospel preached, and to 
listen to the testimonies of the elders 
of Israel, for I accept the Gospel of 
Jesus Christ in its fulness as it has 
been revealed in these latter days. 
I believe absolutely in the great 
atonement of the Son of God. I 
accept Him as the only begotten Son 
of the Father, who came into the 
world to atone for sin and to give to 
the world life, that \vc might have it 
more abundantly. I believe in the 



Gospel of the resurrection of the 
dead, and that all men shall come 
forth from the grave in a literal 
resurrection, a uniting of body and 
spirit, never more to be separated. 
I believe that the just will be ex- 
alted to thrones and powers and 
principalities in the kingdom of 
God, and that every man shall re- 
ceive a reward according to his 
works. I believe in the doctrine of 
repentance from sin ; that it is nec- 
essary for all men to repent. I ac- 
cept the doctrine of baptism for the 
remission of sins, by immersion in 
water, the ordinance being perform- 
ed by one having authority to ad- 
minister in the name of the Lord. 
I believe in the doctrine of laying 
on of hands for the gift of the Holy 
Ghost, by which we are brought into 
communion with our Father in 
heaven and learn of His ways, that 
we may walk in His paths. I firmly 
believe in the doctrine of revelation 
and inspiration ; the privilege of man 
to communicate, under proper con- 
ditions and circumstances, with the 
Lord. I believe in the principle of 
prayer, and that no man can come 
unto God without he has in his heart 
the spirit of prayer., by which he 
communicates with the Father. I 
believe in the salvation of the hu- 
man family, and that it is the inten- 
tion and desire of the Lord to save 
all His children, with the exception 
of a very few who will not be saved, 
who reject salvation against them- 
selves because of their utter wicked- 
ness and sinning against the light. 
I believe the Gospel is universal, 
and it is not merely for the handful 
of people known as Latter-day 
Saints, but that the Lord desires to 
save all men, and eventually will 
save all through their acceptance of 
the Gospel of Jesus Christ and obe- 
dience to His laws, with the cxcep- 



ELDER JOSEPH F. SMITH, JR.

tion, as stated, of the few who re- 
ject salvation against themselves. I 
do not believe that a man is saved 
in this iife by believing, or profess- 
ing to believe on the Lord Jesus 
Christ, but that he must endure to 
the end and keep the commandments 
that are given. It is a principle of 
the Gospel that those who do not 
hear the plan of salvation here will 
have the privilege in the spirit 
world, and being judged, as Peter 
said, according to men in the flesh, 
through their repentance may live 
according to God in the spirit, and 
that all mankind will be ferreted out 
in this life or in the spirit world, and 
will have the Gospel preached to 
them. The time will come when 
every knee shall bow and every 
tongue confess that Jesus is the 
Christ. 

I thank the Lord for our temples, 
where we may go and receive bless- 
ings and Priesthood and power that 
are necessary for us to receive in 
order to gain exaltation in the king- 
dom of God. Where we may also 
go and have the privilege of work- 
ing for the salvation of the dead, 
that they too may receive the truth 
and be redeemed and accept the 
Gospel, just as we do now in the 
flesh. I am thankful to the Lord 
for the knowledge of the eternity of 
the marriage covenant, which gives 
the husband the right to claim his 
wife, and the wife the right to claim 
her husband in the world to come, 
providing they have gone to the 
House of the Lord and been united 
for time and all eternity by one hold- 
ing this sealing power, for in no 
other way can this great blessing be 
obtained. I am also thankful for the 
knowledge that the family relation, 
and the unity of the family, shall 
continue, where properlv organized, 
in righteousness in the life to come. 



I believe in all these doctrines that 
have been presented by the various 
speakers at this conference. I ac- 
cept them all, and rejoice to know 
that they have been revealed in truth 
and power, in this dispensation of 
the fulness of times. I pray that 
we as Latter-day Saints, may be 
united in every particular for our 
welfare, and see eye to eye in all 
these principles of truth, and stand 
together for the advancement of the 
Gospel throughout the world. I 
trust that all these things find an 
abiding place in our hearts, that we 
may in very deed stand in the 
trenches, or in the front ranks of the 
battle against sin, with united pur- 
pose. 

I believe it is our solemn duty to 
love one another, to believe in each 
other, to have faith in each other, 
that it is our duty to overlook the 
faults and the failings of each other, 
and not to magnify them in our own 
eyes nor before the eyes of the 
world. There should be no fault- 
finding, no back-biting, no evil 
speaking, one against another, in the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints. We should be true to 
each other and to every principle of 
our religion and not be envious one 
of another. We should not be jeal- 
ous one of another, nor angry with 
each other, and there should not 
arise in our hearts a feeling that we 
will not forgive one another our 
trespasses. There should be no feel- 
ing in the hearts of the children of 
God of unforgiveness against any 
man, no matter who he may be. The 
Lord has said — T think I will read it 
— in one of the revelations, the fol- 
lowing : 

Wherefore I say unto you, that ye 
ought to forgive one another, for he 
that forgiveth not his brother his tres- 
passes, standeth condemned before the 



120 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Lord, for there remaineth in him the 
greater sin. 

I the Lord will forgive whom I will 
forgive, but of you it is required to 
forgive all men; 

And ye ought to say in your hearts, 
let God judge between me and thee, 
and reward thee according to thy 
deeds. 

And he that repenteth not of his 
sins, and confesseth them not, then ye 
shall bring him before the church, and 
do with him as the scripture saith unto 
you, either by commandment or by 
revelation. 

And this ye shall do that God may 
be glorified, not because ye forgive 
not, having not compassion, but that 
ye may be justified in tlie eyes of the 
law, that ye may not offend him who 
is your Lawgiver. 

I believe in that doctrine. We 
ought not to harbor feelings one 
against another, but have a feeling 
of forgiveness and of brotherly love 
and sisterly love, one for another. 
Let each one of us remember his or 
her own individual failings and 
weaknesses and endeavor to correct 
them. We have not reached a con- 
dition of perfection yet. it is hardly 
to be expected that we will in this 
life, and yet, through the aid of the 
Holy Ghost, it is possible for us to 
stand united together seeing eye to 
eye and overcoming our sins and im- 
perfections. If we will do this, re- 
specting all the commandments of 
the Lord, we shall be a power in the 
world for good ; we shall overwhelm 
and overcome all evil, all opposition 
to the truth, and bring to pass right- 
eousness upon the face of the earth. 
For the Gospel will be spread and 
the people in the world will feel the 
influence which will be shed forth 
from the people of Zion. and they 
will be inclined more to repent of 
their sins and to receive the truth. 

There is no place in Zion for the 
wilful sinner. There is a place for 
the repentant sinner, for the man 



who turns away from iniquitv and 
seeks for life eternal and the' light 
of the Gospel. We should not look 
upon sin with the least degree of 
allowance, any more than the Lord 
can do so, but walk uprightly and 
perfectly before the Lord. It is our 
duty to look after each other, to 
protect each other, to warn each 
other of dangers, to teach each other 
the principles of the Gospel of the 
kingdom, and to stand together with 
a united front against the sins of 
the world. 

I pray that we will do so, that we 
will go from this conference with a 
determination in our hearts to con- 
tinue our labors more diligently, to 
stand more unitedly for the truth in 
every degree and particular; that 
the Lord may pour out His Spirit 
upon us, and bless us abundantly, 
which He will undoubtedly do, if we 
will observe His laws, and keep His 
commandments and the covenants 
we have made with Him to serve 
Him. 

This I pray, with every other 
blessing that will be for oiir good, 
in the name of the Lord lesus 
Christ. Amen. 



ELDER JAMES E. TALMAGE. 

Knowledge concerning God's attributes 
essential to intelligent worship— The 
relationship of Jesus Christ to God the 
Eternal Father, spiritually and bodily 
— Relationship of mankind to Deity. 

In common with my brethren and 
sisters who make up these assembled 
thousands of modern Israel, I have 
been fed with good food and made 
glad in each meeting of this confer- 
ence. I have felt that the Spirit of 
the Lord has been present with us 



ELDER JAMES E.TALM AGE. 



121 



in great abundance. We have heard 
much concerning our temporal 
duties, and much relating to our 
spiritual welfare. It has been made 
plain unto us that these two classes 
of things differ in degree rather 
that in kind, and that we cannot 
serve God acceptably by devoting 
ourselves wholly to scripture study, 
for there are many things pertain- 
ing to temporalities which enter into 
our duties and our appointed ex- 
periences here upon the earth. On 
the other hand, we have been as- 
sured, not for the first time, by any 
means, that we cannot please the 
Lord by wholly devoting ourselves 
to temporal affairs, to the exclusion 
of the consideration of the great 
spiritual principles and truths that 
have been given us. 

We belong to the Church of Jesus 
Christ, and much has been said con- 
cerning His proprietorship, His 
mastership, in the Church, the 
Church that bears His name. I 
take it to be a plain and simple prin- 
ciple that we cannot worship intelli- 
gently, and therefore acceptably 
unto the Lord, unless we know 
something of the attributes and of 
the will of Him whom we profess 
to worship. The relationship of 
the Christ to the Eternal Father has 
been set forth in such plainness that 
I do not think any wayfaring man 
amongst us can fail to understand. 
We recognize in Jesus Christ the 
Son of the Eternal Father, both in 
spirit and in body. There is no 
other meaning to attach to that ex- 
pression, as used bv the Eternal 
Father Himself— "Mine Only Be- 
gotten Son." Christ combined 
within His own person and nature 
the attributes of His mortal mother, 
and just as truly the attributes of 
His immortal Sire. By that fixed 
and inexorable law of nature, that 



every living organism shall follow 
after his kind, Jesus the Christ had 
the power to die, for He was the off- 
spring of a mortal woman ; and He 
had the power to withstand death 
indefinitely, for He was the son of 
an immortal Father. This sim- 
plicity of doctrine has shocked 
many, but the truth is frequently 
shocking just because of its sim- 
plicity and consequent grandeur. 
We must know something of the at- 
tributes of the Eternal Father, that 
we may the more fully comprehend 
His relationship to His Only Begot- 
ten Son. 

Did not Christ declare again and 
again that He possessed in His own 
person such power over life that no 
man could take His life from Him — 
in plain words, that no one could 
kill Him — until He would voluntar- 
ily surrender Himself, and permit 
mortal and infernal powers to pre- 
vail for the time being? How could 
it be otherwise for the Son of an 
immortal Father, who inherited the 
power to keep death in abevance? 
Death could not touch Him until 
He willed and permitted so. Did He 
not say also, not once but many a 
time, that He did what He had seen 
His Father do ? Did He not declare 
that He did only what He had seen 
His Father do, or what His Father 
had done? And did He not make 
it plain that He was following in 
the footsteps of His immortal 
Father, the very Eternal Father to 
whom we pray in the name of His 
Son ? It necessarily follows that the 
Eternal Father once passed through 
experiences analogous to those 
which His Son, the Lord Jesus, 
afterward passed through, and 
through which we are now passing. 
The Eternal Father, therefore, is a 
Being who has had experiences in- 
cident to the mortal state. He is a 



122 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



resurrected Being; He conquered 
death ; and He gave power unto 
His Son to conquer death, through 
whom power shall be given unto the 
Saints, yea, unto all who will accept 
the boon of eternal life, to be re- 
deemed from death. 

On an early occasion in the earthly 
ministry of Christ, when He first 
met Nathanael, Jesus recognized in 
the man at once an Israelite in 
whom was no guile. In His con- 
versation with Nathanael Jesus the 
Christ called Himself for the first 
time, as far as our scripture records 
show, The Son of Man (John 
1:51). Then, in an interview with 
Nicodemus, that renowned teacher 
in Israel and learned doctor of the 
law, Jesus called Himself again The 
Son of Man (John 3:13) ; and you 
will find the same expression used 
in the four gospels approximately 
eighty times. Eliminating all par- 
allel passages, or sayings that are 
reported by more than one of the 
writers, there are approximately 
forty separate instances in which 
Jesus Christ called Himself The 
Son of Man ; but nowhere in the 
four gospels do you find the title 
used by any other than the Christ, 
nor applied by the Christ to any 
other than Himself. 

It may be remarked, in passing, 
that you will find a somewhat sim- 
ilar expression used in the Old 
Testament, in the form of ad- 
dress ; and in these instances it is 
plainly used in its literal and ordi- 
nary or common meaning — the son 
of a mortal man. It is so used ap- 
proximately ninety times in the 
Book of Ezekiel ; in each instance, 
however, Jehovah applies it to His 
prophet, addressing him as "Son of 
man", as the context of the several 
passages plainly shows, to impress 



upon Ezekiel the fact that though 
he was permitted to voice and write 
the very words of Jehovah, he was 
nevertheless but a man. So also in 
the Book of Moses you will find that 
Satan blasphemously assumed to 
establish, or to make it appear that 
there existed, a similar difference 
between him and Moses, when he 
said "Moses, son of man, worship 
me". (Pearl of Great Price, Moses 
1:12). 

But the distinctive title "The Son 
of Man" as applied to Jesus 
Christ occurs only once in the Old 
Testament. It is in the seventh 
chapter of Daniel, wherein is given 
an account of a wonderful manifes- 
tation from God, in which Daniel 
saw, in the vision of the night, the 
scenes that shall take place in a time 
yet future, when the Ancient of 
Days, Adam, who is the patriarch 
of the race, shall sit to judge his 
posterity, and they shall come be- 
fore him, or as Daniel saw it, they 
came before him, in their order ; and 
among them there came one like 
unto The Son of Man who appeared 
in the clouds of heaven : and when 
He came all power and dominion 
were given unto Him, and His 
kingdom was declared to be an all- 
embracing and an everlasting king- 
dom. Thus is shown the superiority 
of the Son of Man over the Ancient 
of Days, or in other words, the su- 
premacy of Jesus the Christ over 
Adam, the patriarch of the race 
(see Dan. 7:9-14). 

Now, in the New Testament, out- 
side the four gospels, you will find 
the title "The Son of Man'' occur- 
ring about three times, and in each 
instance it is applied to the Christ, 
in His then glorified state (see Acts 
7 :56 ; Rev. 1 :13, and 14 :14) . When 
Stephen stood before his unright- 



ELDER JAMES E.TALMAGE. 



123 



eous judges, the heavens were 
opened to him, and he could not 
keep within his soul what he saw. 
He said, "Behold I see The Son of 
Man, standing on the right hand of 
God" ; and for that testimony they 
took Stephen out and stoned him, 
as for the testimony of the Father 
they had before crucified the Christ. 

God has glorified His Son ; but 
though the Son is glorified with the 
glory of the Father, you can't 
change the fact that He is the Son 
of that Father, and that Father, the 
Eternal Father, the Father of Jesus 
Christ, the Father of His spirit and 
the Father of His body, was once a 
Man, and has progressed, not by any 
favor but by the right of conquest 
over sin, and over death, to His 
present position of priesthood and 
power, of Godship and Godliness, 
as the Supreme Being whom we all 
profess to worship. We are all 
spirit sons and daughters of God ; 
but Jesus Christ was and is The 
Son of God in a superlative and dis- 
tinctive sense, God the Eternal 
Father being His Father both in 
spirit and in flesh. 

We believe in the more than im- 
. perial status of the human race. We 
believe that our spirits are the off- 
spring of Deity, and we hold that 
when Christ said to His apostles, 
"Be ye therefore perfect, even as 
your Father which is in heaven is 
perfect," He was not talking of a 
merely idealistic yet impossible 
achievement ; but that on the con- 
trary He meant that it was possible 
for men to advance until they shall 
become like unto the Gods in their 
powers and in their attainments, 
through righteousness. 

According to the spirit of the re- 
vealed word, perfection is rather 



relative than absolute. Though a 
man become perfect in his mortal 
sphere of activity, he is by no means 
perfect as gaged by the standard 
prevailing in heaven. As the 
Prophet Joseph said to the Church 
in early days, so now says the 
Church unto the world — if the heav- 
ens could be rent, and you could see 
the Eternal Father sitting upon His 
throne, you would see Him like a 
man in form. That the Eternal 
Father has called Himself a Man is 
plainly apparent in the testimony of 
Enoch the Seer; and in the same 
scripture Jesus Christ is designated 
"The Son of Man" even, before the 
time of the flood ; "For in the lan- 
guage of Adam, Man of Holiness 
is His name, and the name of His 
Only Begotten is the Son of Man, 
even Jesus Christ", (Moses 6:57; 
compare 7:24, 47 and 54). In a 
certain revelation to Enoch, the 
Eternal Father thus spake : "Be- 
hold, I am God ; Man of Holiness 
is my name, Man of Counsel is my 
name ; and Endless and Eternal is 
my name, also." (Moses 7:35). 
Thus does the light of modern rev- 
elation illuminate the dark passages 
of old. 

The doctrine of the relationship 
between God and men, as made 
plain through the word of revela- 
tion, is today as it was of old, 
though in the light of later scrip- 
ture we are enabled to read the 
meaning more clearly. It is pro- 
vided that we, the sons and daugh- 
ters of God, may advance until we 
become like unto our Eternal Father 
and our Eternal Mother, in that we 
may become perfect in our spheres 
as they are in theirs. That grand 
truth, taught by the Prophet Joseph, 
and ridiculed for the time, has now 
gripped the minds of the thinkers 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



and philosophers of the age. You 
will find it hinted at and timidly 
expressed in the writings of many 
recent and learned publications in 
the theological field. That great 
truth is finding its way into the 
literature of the world. It was 
crystallized into what we may call 
an aphorism, by President Lorenzo 
Snow : "As man is God once was ; 
as God is man may be". We know 
that Christ is God, and that He lived 
upon the earth as a Man. In the 
sense in which Christ was perfect 
in His sphere, we may become per- 
fect in ours. We may progress, not 
to become each one a savior of the 
world in the particular sense in 
which Christ was the Savior of the 
world, but we may follow Him to 
eternal glory, and to eternal life, 
which may our Father grant, in the 
name of Jesus. Amen. 

The congregation sang the hymn : 

Come, let us anew our journey pursue, 

Roll round with the year, 
And never stand still till the Master 
appear, 

His adorable will let us glady fulfill, 
And our talents improve, 
By the patience of hope and the labor 
of love. 

Benediction was pronounced by 
Elder Duncan M. McAllister. 

Conference adjourned until 2 
p. m.

When there's love at home; 



There is joy in ev'ry sound, 
When there's love at home. 

Prayer was offered by Elder 
Stephen L. Richards. 

The congregation sang the hymn :

PREST. SEYMOUR B. YOUNG. 

(President of First Council of Seventy.) 

My brethren and sisters, I can but 
express to you today the pleasure 
that I have in being with you at this 
great conference, and I have receiv- 
ed additional pleasure in listening 
to those who have spoken, and also 
have found joy in the true ring of 
the good spirit that actuated Presi- 
dent Smith's remarks in the begin- 
ning session of these services. I be- 
lieve in the Gospel of the Lord 
Jesus Christ; I have faith in His 
servants and in the Church. I be- 
lieve in the Prophet Joseph Smith; 
I believe in his sacred and important 
ministry. I believe the message that 
he received from the angel Moroni, 
bringing to him that great record of 
a portion of the house of Israel, 
whose remnants are today inhabi- 
tants of this American continent and 
the islands of the Pacific. 

I rejoice in the testimony of the 
Gospel that I have received. Like 
yourselves, my brethren and sisters, 
I «was born of goodly parents. I 
have heard from the lips of my 
father and mother, testimonies of 
the truth of this great work, from 
the earliest time that I can remem- 
ber. I imbibed the principles and 



PRESIDENT SEYMOUR B. YOUNG.

faith of the Gospel from my mother, 
From my first remembrance, I heard 
her speak of this great work, with 
the sublimest faith that a human 
being can possess, and the same can 
be truly said, as many of you know, 
of my noble father. He taught his 
children that Jesus was the Christ, 
that He is the Son of God, that He 
is the Savior of the world, the Re- 
deemer of all the children of our 
Heavenly Father ; and that Joseph 
Smith was sent with a high commis- 
sion to perform a great labor, to 
reveal a knowledge of the resurrec- 
tion and the eternal life of man, to 
bring to light again the truth of the 
everlasting Gospel that Jesus taught, 
and that His apostles taught, and 
that Paul alluded to when he said, 
"Woe is me if I preach not this 
Gospel for it is the power of God 
unto salvation to all them that be- 
lieve and obey." 

I rejoice today when I remember 
some of the things that I heard my 
father speak of. He said that at one 
time, during the early spring of 
1834, the Prophet Joseph inter- 
viewed himself and his brother 
Brigham. The Prophet said to these 
two brothers, Elder Brigham Young 
and Elder Joseph Young, "I am 
going to organize a company of men 
to journey up to Missouri, to the 
center stake of Zion, from whence 
the Saints have been driven, and 
robbed of their possessions, and I 
want you two brethren to consent to 
go with me. If you will go," he 
said, "I promise you in the name of 
the Lord that you shall go safely, 
and return in safety to your fami : 
lies." Of course, these faithful 
brethren were never known to re- 
fuse a call made upon them by the 
Prophet, and they joined the gallant 
company that accompanied the 
Prophet Joseph and his brother Hy- 



rum into the land of Missouri, with 
two hundred and ten others. I am 
glad of the testimonies I have heard 
borne in regard to that great mis- 
sion. At that time it was considered 
opportune to bring relief to those 
poor people, the Latter-day Saints, 
who had been driven from their 
homes in that part of the state of 
Missouri, Independence, Jackson 
county. The Prophet invited men 
who had some means, I heard my 
father say, and history bears this 
out, men that could command some 
resources, to go up to Zion, as it was 
called then, and redeem, by pur- 
chase, that portion of the land from 
which the Saints had been driven. 
When they arrived in the state of 
Missouri, and crossed the Fishing 
River, opposite Independence, a 
'great storm arose, and this was 
thought to be very providential. Lit- 
tle Fishing River, and Big Fishing 
River, rose thirty or forty feet in 
one night, so some of the mob testi- 
fied, and this proved a protection to 
the little band of brethren who went 
up in Zion's camp. 

While there encamped, there was 
dissatisfaction among some of the 
members of the camp, some of them 
felt to rebel against the require- 
ments made upon them by the 
Prophet. One evening some of them 
were stricken down with a terrible 
disease known as the Asiatic cholera 
— I do not know as the brethren rec- 
ognized at that time that that was 
the nature of the disease. Fourteen 
of that little band of brethren died 
within three days, with that terrible 
scourge. It is written in history 
that the Prophet Joseph and his 
brother Hyrum, by request of some 
of the afflicted ones, laid their hands 
upon the brethren who were sick 
and tried to rebuke the disease, but 
the disease laid hold upon these two 



126 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



great men to that degree that they 
were thrown to the ground in terri- 
ble convulsions. As they lay to- 
gether writhing in pain, they seized 
each other by the hand and strug- 
gled to their knees, holding fast to 
each other's hands, with a vow in 
their hearts that they would not 
arise from their kneeling position 
until they had a testimony from God 
that they would be restored. After 
praying for some time, the Prophet 
records, lifting their hearts to God, 
pleading with Him with all the 
strength that they could muster, 
Hyrum Smith rose to his feet and 
began to shout "Hosanna to God 
and the Lamb forever, for," said he 
to his brother Joseph, "I have had a 
vision, I have seen our dear old 
mother kneeling in the orchard 
praying for her bovs, and T have had 
a testimony from God that her pray- 
ers will be heard, and that we shall 
once more see her in life." Joseph, 
the Prophet, immediately arose from 
his knees and ioined in praise and 
halleluiah to God, for he too felt 
renewed strength and power from 
the intercession of her faithful 
prayers, and exclaimed, "God bless 
our dear old mother ; how often has 
she brought us from the depths of 
despair, sickness, pain and suffering 
through her devotion and pravers." 

I am glad that this testimony has 
come to me. from my father, and 
also from the history of the Church. 
The Prophet and his brother felt the 
blessed result of that good mother's 
prayer, and testified of her devoted 
love for her sons. Tt is in keeping 
with the mothers in this Church, the 
mothers of these boys and girls who 
are seated in this great congrega- 
tion. I do not mean particularlv of 
any age, but of all ages. All of us, 
my brethren and sisters, have real- 
ized how the faith and prayers of 



our dear mothers and fathers have 
prevailed, time and time again, with 
the Lord of heaven in our behalf. 

I am glad today that I can testify 
of the truth of the Gospel of the 
Lord Jesus Christ; it is indeed the 
power of God unto salvation. To- 
day, instead of having enemies in 
Independence, Jackson county, Mis- 
souri, Brother Bennion informs me 
there are many friends there who do 
not belong to our faith. There were 
very many people in that country 
that were not our friends, at the 
time of the gathering of our people 
there, and of their settlement in that 
county ; they far outnumbered us 
and were our bitter foes. Today 
they are friendly to our people; and 
T am glad that this is so. I am glad 
that our people have the opportunity 
once more of standing upon those 
sacred places that were designated 
by the Prophet Joseph Smith to be 
prominent cities, dwelling places for 
the Latter-day Saints some time in 
the future. We have a mission es- 
tablished there, a house of worship, 
and able missionaries under the 
president of that mission proclaming 
the Gospel on the very land from 
which the Saints were driven in 
olden time. "In olden times" I do 
not mean ages or centuries ago, but 
during the history that this people 
have made in the last eighty-five 
years. 

Things have turned in our favor 
in many places where we were at 
one time very greatly in disfavor, 
and I attribute this to the fact that 
this is indeed a progressive work. 
Tt is being taught by able mission- 
aries to the people of this land, and 
they are beginning to realize that 
there is some good in "Mormon- 
ism." The Lord is evidencing by 
His power and blessings that they 
are His people indeed. Many 



ELDER BRIGHAM H. ROBERTS. 



127 



strangers have been willing to ad- 
mit, although they have not had suf- 
ficient testimony of the Gospel to 
■embrace it, that there is much good 
in "Mormonism," and that it has 
brought to pass many good things. 
It has gathered men and women 
from every land and clime of the 
civilized world ; all of the Christian 
nations have contributed some of 
their population to this great move- 
ment, and their unification, their un- 
ion of purpose, have testified that 
they are being brought into unity 
of faith, and speaking the same lan- 
guage. Amalgamating together the 
gathered of the nations that have 
come to this place, I am reminded 
of that Mr. Brown who was long 
the bodyguard of Queen Victoria. 
He said to the beautiful Danish 
princess, whom the Prince had 
chosen for a wife, "In welcoming 
thee all Danes are we." I think that 
in welcoming the Latter-day Saints 
to this land that has been prepared 
for their gathering, we can say we 
are all one nation, one people, that 
we are one in purpose of heart, that 
we are worshiping one God, and 
that we have one faith, one baptism, 
one Lord. 

My brethren and sisters, I rejoice 
today in this testimony. I can say, 
in conclusion, when I look at this 
work and its progress, and when I 
realize the faith of our leaders, I 
feel like repeating what Queen Eliz- 
abeth said, when the Bishop of Can- 
terbury placed the crown upon her 
brow. "The Lord has done it and it 
is marvelous in our eyes." Amen. 

ELDER BRIGHAM H. ROBERTS. 

(Of the First Council of Seventy.) 

In placing upon record a num- 
ber of visions granted to him when 
a prisoner upon the Isle of Patmos, 



the beloved disciple of the Lord, 
John, recorded this : 

"I saw another angel fly in the midst 
of heaven having the everlasting 
Gospel to preach unto them that dwell 
on the earth, and to every nation, and 
kindred, and tongue and people, 

"Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, 
and give glory to Him; for the hour 
of_His judgment is come: and worship 
Him that made heaven and earth, and 
the sea, and the fountains of waters." 

Two very great things are implied 
in that scripture. First of all it is 
evident that "the hour of God's 
judgment" we naturally think of as 
in some way connected with a great 
epoch in relation to the earth and 
its history. "In the hour of God's 
judgment," it would appear from 
this scripture, men would be 
without the Gospel, — every nation 
and kindred and tongue and people, 
—or else why should there be need 
of the Lord sending an angel to re- 
store that Gospel to the world in the 
hour of His judgment, if it was al- 
ready on the earth. In the time of 
His judgment, also, it appears that 
every nation, kindred and tongue 
and people would be worshiping 
some other Deity than God who cre- 
ated the heavens and the earth and 
the seas and the fountains of water ; 
or else why this call to all nations to 
return to the worship of the true 
and the living God, creator of 
heaven and earth? 

The other great thing that is im- 
plied in this prophecy is the fact 
that in the hour of God's judgment 
He would restore the Gospel to the 
earth by the ministration of an 
angel. 

Those two things, I think, stand 
out strongly in this scripture, and 
it is generally understood I think 
in the Church that the dispensation 
of the Gospel given unto us, 



128 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



brought forth in our age by the 
ministry of angels, is the fulfillment 
of John's vision, although there be 
some among the Latter-day Saints 
who think that this passage has 
nothing to do with the introduction 
of the Gospel to the earth in our 
day; and there was one man very 
high in authority in the Church who 
rather scoffed at the idea of the 
elders using that passage of scrip- 
ture as a prophecy of the coming 
forth of the work of the Lord in 
these days. Yet the matter is de- 
cidedly settled by a revelation in the 
Doctrine and Covenants that is call- 
ed the "Appendix." By the way, our 
treatment of that revelation as to its 
placement in the Book of Doctrine 
and Covenants perhaps is a little 
misleading ; it was a revelation given 
on the 3rd of November, 1831, and 
was then called the "Appendix" to 
a little collection of the revelations 
that had been given to the Prophet 
up to November, 1831 ; and this rev- 
elation is the "Appendix" to that 
little collection rather than to the 
whole Book of Revelations in the 
Doctrine and Covenants ; but be- 
cause it was called an "Appendix" 
to that little collection, we have kept 
moving it back, in the book 
in succeeding editions, and admit- 
ting the subsequent revelations, 
still calling that the "Appen- 
dix ;" but as a matter of fact it 
was the "Appendix" only to the 
first collection of revelations that 
was made and that was intended to 
be published, and was partly pub- 
lished, in the city of Independence, 
in 1833. In this revelation occurs 
this passage : 

"For, behold, the Lord God hath 
sent forth the angel crying through 
the midst of heaven, saying, Prepare 
ye the way of the Lord, and make His 



paths straight, for the hour of His 
coming is nigh." 

And again: 

"Now, verily saith the Lord, that 
these things might be known among 
you, O inhabitants of the earth, I have 
sent forth mine angel" — 

This is in 1831, be it remem- 
bered — 

"flying through the midst of heaven, 
having the everlasting Gospel, who 
hath appeared unto some, and hath 
committed it unto man, who shall ap- 
pear unto many that dwell on the 
earth; 

"And this Gospel shall be preached 
unto every nation, and kindred, and 
tongue and, people, 

"And the servants of God shall go 
forth, saying, with a loud voice, Fear 
God and give glory to Him, for the 
hour of His judgment is come: 

"And worshp Him that made the 
heavens and the earth and the sea, and 
the fountains of waters." 

The language of this modern 
revelation describing the fulfillment 
of St. John's vision is so nearly 
identical with that of the Book of 
Revelation that I think there can be 
no mistake about it, vist that this 
dispensation of the Gospel com- 
mitted unto us is the fulfillment of 
John's great vision. And now, that 
being true, behold what burden, joy- 
ful burden however, is laid upon the 
Church of Christ! For with the 
acceptance of this dispensation of 
the Gospel, and the organization of 
the Church as the means of pro- 
claiming that Gospel to the world, 
comes the duty of preaching that 
Gospel to every nation and kindred 
and tongue and people. The 
Church has two great functions to 
perform, that is to say, you can 
generalize her responsibilities and 
her duties to the world under two 



ELDER BRIGHAM H. ROBERTS. 



129 



general heads, namely, the procla- 
mation of the truth which God has 
deposited with her, to all the in- 
habitants of the earth ; and the other 
great duty of the Church is to per- 
fect the lives of those who accept 
those truths. Upon those two things 
hang all the law and all the proph- 
ets, so to speak. 

I merely wish to call your atten- 
tion to one part of that great mis- 
sion, and that is the responsibility 
of making proclamation of the truth 
which God has restored to the earth, 
and deposited with His Church. 
That burden rests upon the whole 
Church of Christ ; not upon one sec- 
tion of it. You may use, and we 
are waking up to a realization of 
the fact that it was evidently God's 
intent that we should use, the 
seventies of the Church as the means 
for the proclamation of this Gospel. 
Now you may use them as the 
agency for this work, the principal 
one, but the duty and the burden of 
carrying out that part of the mission 
of the Church rests upon the entire 
body of the Church of Christ, and 
not upon the seventies alone. We 
are beginning to realize that in send- 
ing forth this message to the world 
we are doubtless using too many 
young men of inexperience, of 
scarcely matured minds ; young men 
whose judgment has not yet settled 
to full, manly judgment. In other 
words we have perhaps overlooked 
the admonition that the Prophet 
gave upon this subject in the very 
early history of the Church. For 
instance, he says in a letter from the 
elders in Kirtland to their brethren 
abroad, in 1833 : 

"Be careful about sending boys to 
preach the Gospel to the world; if 
they go, let them be accompanied by 
someone who is able to guide them in 
the proper channel, lest they become 



puffed up and fall under condemnation, 
and into the snare of the devil." 

We find it necessary to return to 
this counsel, or to be admonished by 
it ; and while we may continue to call 
young men, I hope we will, but at 
the same time we find a crying need 
for men of mature judgment, and of 
comprehensive knowledge of the 
great truths that we are to present 
to the children of men. In passing 
let me say that the Church has no 
higher duty to perform than this 
duty of teaching the Gospel. The 
organization of the Church is such 
that it proclaims to us, if we will 
but contemplate it, how highly the 
Lord regards the duty of Hi? 
Church in making proclamation of 
His message unto the inhabitants of 
the earth, since He sets apart and 
makes it the special duty of the 
Twelve Apostles and of the great 
body of the seventy — now ten thou- 
sand strong — to perform that duty. 
It is a labor worthy of the best man- 
hood, and of the highest talent, in 
the Church ; and is worthy of the 
greatest sacrifices, in order to send 
the message of God unto the in- 
habitants of the earth. This Church 
has prospered in proportion to her 
zeal, and earnestness in fulfilling this 
high duty that she owes both to God 
and to the children of men. When 
dark clouds gathered about the 
Church in Kirtland, and it did seem 
as if the powers of the nethermost 
world were combined in an effort to 
overthrow the Prophet and the work 
that he was founding, a strange 
thing happened. In a council meet- 
ing of the priesthood the Prophet 
arose and crossed the room and 
went to Heber C. Kimball and told 
him that the Spirit had whispered 
to him that for the salvation of the 
Church, it was necessary that the 
Lord's servant, Heber C. Kimball, 



130 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



cross the great waters and make 
proclamation of the Gospel in Eng- 
land. A strange way to save the 
Church, was it not? And yet it had 
that effect ; for from the introduc- 
tion of the Gospel at that time in 
England there began that great pro- 
cession of new membership into the 
Church, which so mightily strength- 
ened it. They gave to it new life 
and vigor and power in the world. 
The new disciples took the place of 
those who were disposed to fall 
away. 

Again you would naturally sup- 
pose after the experiences in Mis- 
souri, when the Latter-day Saints 
who had gathered to that state were 
as a people scattered and peeled, dis- 
possessed of all their earthly pos- 
sessions, and driven from the State 
of Missouri, everybody in distress, in 
sickness, and in poverty — you would 
naturally suppose, I say. that nobody 
would think of missionary work 
then ; and yet. in the midst of those 
trials, the word of the Lord came 
to the Prophet directing that the 
Twelve Apostles should take their 
departure from the land of Zion, 
from the public square in Far West, 
and cross the waters and preach the 
Gospel again in England : and so in 
the midst of the moving from Mis- 
souri and settling in Nauvoo, this 
mission was undertaken ; and again 
the work took a mighty stride for- 
ward as the result of the mission of 
the Apostles to those foreign lands. 
Tens of thousands were brought 
into the Church, and the means 
essential to carrying on the work 
of the Lord, came from that mission, 
and strengthened the hands of the 
brethren at Nauvoo. Tn each of 
these crises, you see, the Church 
turned to her great duty of making 
nroclamation of the Gospel, with the 
happiest results. 



When our people were expatri- 
ated from the United States and had 
been wonderfully led through the 
wilderness to these mountain val- 
leys, with a great portion of the 
Church still on wheels in the wilder- 
ness, and in encampments along the 
line of travel between these moun- 
tains and the Missouri River, you 
would naturally suppose that that 
was a time when every man of 
strength and wisdom and faith and 
spiritual power would be needed in 
Israel to locate the people in these 
mountain valleys ; yet the prophet of 
the Lord, then guiding the affairs of 
Israel, in 1849 ,"at the"October Con- 
ference of that year, before anvbody 
was very well settled in the new 
home, began a great foreign and do- 
mestic missionary work — leading to 
the founding of a number of foreign 
missions that have continued to this 
day. 

Addison Pratt, a returned mis- 
sionary from the South Pacific Is- 
lands, since the Church had no tem- 
ple at that time, was taken to the 
summit of Ensign Peak and given 
his endowments, that he might re- 
turn to those islands of the sea in 
which he had labored, with greater 
spiritual power, and with his two 
other companions go on with the 
work that had been opened up in 
those far away lands. 

Elder Amasa M. Lyman and 
Charles C. Rich, the latter a newly 
ordained apostle of the Lord Jesus 
Christ, were sent to the Pacific 
Coast, to California, to gather up 
those who had gone astray, and save 
the scattered sheep of the house of 
Israel. 

Orson Pratt, in 1848, had been 
sent to England, to preside in that 
mission ; and at this wonderful con- 
ference, of 1849, Franklin D. Rich- 
ards, a newly ordained apostle, at 



ELDER BRIGHAM H. ROBERTS. 



131 



the time, and a young man then, was 
sent to join Elder Pratt in the Brit- 
ish mission. 

Elder Lorenzo Snow was called 
to open the door of the Gospel in 
Italy and in other lands of Europe 
and India. 

Erastus Snow was called at the 
same time to open the door of the 
Gospel to the Scandinavian nations. 

Elder John Taylor was sent to 
open the door of the Gospel to the 
great empires of France and of Ger- 
many. These brethren had mavel- 
ous success, for God was with 
them, in establishing periodicals in 
the languages of the nations to 
which they were sent ; also in trans- 
lating some of the standard works 
of the Church — the Book of Mor- 
mon, the Doctrine and Covenants, 
and other works. They made wide 
proclamation of the Gospel in those 
days, and founded the missions that 
have continued until this present 
time in those several lands. The 
work under Elders Pratt and Rich- 
ards, in England, had a wonderful 
development. In the little less than 
three years that Orson Pratt pre- 
sided in that land, the "Millennial 
Star" increased in its circulation 
from three thousand seven hundred 
to twenty-two thousand. In about 
the same length of time, a little less 
than three years, in the British 
Isles, twenty-two thousand were 
added to the Church of Christ, and 
five thousand five hundred were 
emigrated to the land of Zion. You 
see how wonderfully God blesses 
His Church when she pays full and 
complete attention to this holy of- 
fice of making proclamation of the 
word of God to the inhabitants of 
the earth. It is the source of 
strength and life and progress to the 
Church. 

I am saying all this to you because 



I believe, while we have not been 
neglectful, I think, at any time, our 
circumstances and conditions con- 
sidered — we have not been neglect- 
ful at any time in attention to this 
great mission of ours ; and yet from 
time to time there do come, appar- 
ently, special openings, special op- 
portunities, calling for increased 
exertion upon our part, and, per- 
haps, the making of what we call 
sacrifices for this work. I believe 
that the stage of the world is being 
reset for increased opportunities for 
us to make proclamation of this 
message that has been committed 
unto us ; that the nations are on the 
way to that humiliation, to that con- 
dition, when they will lend an ear 
to what we have to say. Now my 
point is this, that while they are in 
preparation for the incoming of 
conditions wherein they will be more 
willing to listen to our message, 
it is becoming in us that we 
make preparation for the enlarged 
opportunity that is promised for a 
fruitful proclamation of the Gospel 
of Jesus Christ again restored to the 
earth. 

In pursuance of these ideas we are 
going among our seventies, and the 
local authorities of the stakes and 
wards are being asked to give more 
attention to the seventies as the most 
proper officers in the Church to fill 
the call for missionary service 
abroad. The mission service of the 
Church needs men of judgment, 
men of weight of character. There 
is nothing truer in the psychology 
of things, than this, that if you 
would appeal to men of character, 
men that are heads of families, men 
that have mature thought, and are 
earnest in fulfilling the purposes of 
life, if you would reach those classes 
— and they are the ones I take it that 
we are anxious to reach, because 



132 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



when we reach one of them we will 
reach not a unit but a group, a 
family, and they are the ones to 
which we should make most earnest 
appeal. Now, I say, if you want to 
reach that class of men, then you 
must send that class of men to them, 
or you will not reach them — at least 
so effectively, you will not reach 
them. That is the kind of men we 
want; and if it calls for sacrifice, 
then let us make the necessary sac- 
rifice, in wisdom of course, and 
judgment. 

There is just one other thing 
connected with that important mat- 
ter that I would like to call at- 
tention to, although I am afraid I 
am trespassing upon the time of 
others, but it is this : the Lord of 
heaven takes no pride in ignorance. 
His whole purpose is to give out 
intelligence and to save men through 
knowledge of correct doctrine and 
truth. He will take no pride in an 
ignorant ministry. When a num- 
ber of elders assembled in Kirtland 
and were waiting for a conference 
to be held before they should return 
to. their fields of labor, they asked 
the prophet what the Lord's will was 
concerning them, and the Lord gave 
this instruction : 

"I give unto you a commandment, 
that you shall teach one another the 
doctrine of the kingdom; 

"Teach ye diligently and my grace 
shall attend you, that you ma-" be in- 
structed more perfectly in theory, in- 
principle, in doctrine, in the law of 
the Gospel, in all things that pertain 
unto the kingdom of God, that are 
expedient for you to understand; 

"Of things both in heaven and in 
the earth, and under the earth; things 
which have been, things which are, 
things which must shortly come to 
pass; things which are at home, things 
which are abroad; the wars and the 
perplexities of the nations, and the 
judgments which are on the land, and 



a knowledge also of countries and of 
kingdoms." 

And why? Here is represented a 
very extensive field of knowledge. 
It covers every possible field of 
knowledge, why are the elders ad- 
monished, and even commanded to 
become acquainted with all these 
things? The Lord answers that 
question : 

"That ye may be prepared in all 
things when I shall send you again 
to magnify the calling whereunto I 
have called you, and the mission with 
which I have commissioned you." 

And again, in the same revela- 
tion : "As all have not faith — " as 
all are not able to attain unto knowl- 
edge by faith — not all gifted tb 
drink at the very fountain head — 

"And as all have not faith, seek ye 
diligently and teach one another words 
of wisdom; yea, seek ve out of the best 
books words of wisdom: seek learning 
even by study, and also by faith." 

That was the instruction of the 
Lord to the elders who were con- 
templating their mission to the 
world, and that was what was re- 
quired of them. Again, I say, since 
the world's stage is being set for a 
wider proclamation of the Gospel, 
let me admonish the seventies, 
among whom I stand, and with 
whom I more especially labor, let 
me say to them, to go to, now fill 
your minds with knowledge and 
also with faith, and let us draw to 
ourselves that spiritual power which 
comes from observing the laws of 
the Gospel; that when the great 
world's war shall cease, when its ter- 
rors shall no longer appal the peo- 
ple, and when they settle down to 
sober contemplation of the eternal 
verities, as they will, let us be

prepared to teach them the truth 
as God has revealed it, and thus help 
in the great period of reconstruction 
that will come to the world, and that 
will be absolutely necessary to the 
world. That is my admonition to 
you, in the name of Jesus. Amen.

ELDER J. GOLDEN KIMBALL. 

(Of the First Council of Seventy.) 

Brother Smoot yesterday quoted 
one of our articles of faith: "We 
believe all that God has revealed." 
I have been thinking about it; all 
that God has revealed, as found in 
the Bible, the Book of Mormon, the 
Doctrine and Covenants and Pearl 
of Great Price. When you think 
of it 'for one moment it requires a 
great big belief to believe all that 
God does now reveal; "and we be- 
lieve that He will, yet reveal many 
great and important things pertain- 
ing to the kingdom of God." It is 
not very difficult for a Latter-day 
Saint to believe all that has been re- 
vealed. To me it is all true, but the 
great trouble I am having is to make 
it work. (Laughter). I have been 
trying to crystallize what faith I 
have — and I might say that I haven't 
any to spare. Why not find out one 
or two or six of these splendid 
things that have been revealed and 
see if we can include them in our 
work? 

After listening to Brother Rob- 
erts I think I will have to put on 
what they call the "soft pedals," be- 
cause those things stir my soul. It 
is my calling ; it is my appointment. 
I feel it, and I sense it just as 
much as Brother Roberts does; it 
sounds to me like mobilizing, and I 



think that is the meaning of all this 
noise. 1 believe it will take time to 
awaken and arouse all the Seventies. 
We will have to get our choir to 
sing, "Hark, listen to the trumpet- 
ers !" I don't know but what it will 
be necessary to have a martial band 
and work up a little enthusiasm, and 
play on the imagination of these 
Seventies for a while ; it won't hurt 
them. You need not be afraid of 
getting them over excited. (Laugh- 
ter). We are almost immune to 
missionary work and the reason for 
this is, we haven't been called upon 
for a long time; only a very few 
Seventies are filling foreign mis- 
sions, at present. 

The presiding bishop's office re- 
port shows that there are over 11,- 
000 Seventies. I wish they would 
get busy and help us find about two 
thousand of that number, because 
they are not yet enrolled; I think 
we have decreased that number since 
last year. We have that great body 
of priesthood, and I don't think any 
one in this Church, not even the 
General Authorities, realize more 
than we do the condition, the finan- 
cial condition that our brethren are 
in. We find that it is because of 
the building of homes, the purchas- 
ing of land, and a great many other 
difficulties that have come to them. 
They have had sickness, and finan- 
cial, disappointment. The First 
Council have interviewed a great 
many men and I can say for the 
Seventies, as far as I am personally 
concerned — and I have interviewed 
just as many as any of the Council 
has — that we have few cowards in 
our band, but some of them have 
"served tables" so long, and settled 
difficulties, and been ward teachers, 
and slept in good beds and remained 
home, that it is just possible some of 
them have cowardly thoughts ; and 



134 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



the reason for this is, they have been 
at home so long they have become 
attached to their homes, and they 
need weaning. (Laughter). It is 
a very great responsibility. 

I am going to ask you a few ques- 
tions and then conclude my remarks. 
I wonder if we Seventies know what 
we want? I know my father 
preached once, "that to want a 
thing and you can't get it is hell." 
Some people have never been able 
to find out what they want. I have 
learned that when my family want 
anything they seem to want it 
mighty bad, and I never have much 
peace until I get it for them. Do 
we see and understand what we 
want? I now ask you in all solem- 
nity, brethren — and you might as 
well look the cannon in the mouth ; 
as this is no Sunday School proposi- 
tion when you talk about preaching 
the Gospel — don't we know, haven't 
we been? I know something about 
it ; T have filled two missions. I 
don't look like I would ever be able 
to go again, but I am ready. I 
hardly think I could pass a physical 
examination, but my temperature is 
all right, and my pulse is beating 
regularly, and I am ready to face 
the music. T have enough faith to 
accept a call. 

Do you want to "inherit eternal 
life?" Every man answer for him- 
self — no use trying to put the bur- 
den on the Council of the Twelve 
or the First Council of the Seventy. 
Do you want to inherit eternal life? 
Are you willing to pay the price? 
Do you want to take up the cross 
and follow vour Master, and inherit 
eternal life? Remember the young 
man — T wish I was as good as he 
was ; he observed all the laws ; but 
the Savior said : "One thing thou 
lackest;" and what did He tell him? 
Did He ask him if he was in debt? 



no, he knew ; he knew how to settle 
that matter at once. Sell whatso- 
ever thou hast, and give to the poor, 
and take up the cross and follow 
Me, and thou shalt inherit eternal 
life. And that is what the young 
man thought he wanted, when he 
asked the Master, "Good Master, 
what shall I do that I may inherit 
eternal life?" The young man re- 
ceived his answer, and he went away 
a good deal sicker than a lot of 
these Seventies will be when we get 
after them. He did not want eter- 
nal life at the price ; he did not 
have the faith. 

Faith is a process ; faith consists 
in hard work, and when you accept 
a call for a mission, the desire must 
be put in one's soul day after day. 
You think it over and over, and then 
go doggedly back to it and keep on 
asking yourself, What is it I really 
want? You will have an awful 
time answering the question. If you 
have found out what you want, then 
ni)- advice to you is to get prepared 
for it. I am willing to be one 
among the number. I am willing to 
sell what is necessary to pay my 
debts. I would be pleased to pay 
them. We will have to take care of 
your farms, and plow your land, and 
put in your grain and harvest your 
crops : we will have to help the wife 
with the children, and teach the boys 
to work ; and then we will go out 
and preach the Gospel, if you will 
assist us. This is no fifty-cent 
proposition. If you brethren can't 
go — you rich men and you poor men 
— then put up your money like men, 
and we will do the work. Money 
talks when it comes to missionary 
work, as our families have to be 
cared for. The Prophet Joseph 
Smith taught the doctrine that these 
Seventies were "not to serve tables, 
and they were not to settle difficul-

ties," but were to preach the Gospel 
to the nations of the earth, and the 
Twelve and Seventy have particu- 
larly to depend upon their ministry 
for their support and that of their 
families ; and they have a right, by 
virtue of their offices, to call upon 
the Churches to assist them. 

I have the spirit of the Seventy 
calling, I feel it in my' hands ; I feel 
its thrill all through my being, and 
I propose to breathe it into every 
Seventy that comes near me. So if 
you don't like it, you better keep 
away from me. I want eternal life. 
I want salvation, and I desire to 
breathe the same desire into my wife 
and children, so that they will want 
to partake o'f it, and be willing to 
make some sacrifice. I want to 
breathe it unto every Seventy that I 
come in contact with, and then go 
out into the world and see God's 
children partake of eternal life and 
salvation, the greatest of all gifts 
that God can give to His children. 
I want it. I know what I want, and 
I begin to find out what it will cost. 
The Lord bless you. Amen. 

ELDER RULON S. WELLS. 

(Of the First Council of Seventy.) 

This congregation will be pretty 
well impressed with the fact that 
the first council of the Seventy are 
in earnest about this missionary 
work, and feel the responsibility 
that has been placed upon the Sev- 
enties relative to the carrying of the 
Gospel to the world. I have re- 
joiced exceedingly in the spirit of 
this conference and in the words 
that have been spoken, from the 
opening address of President Smith 
which filled my soul with delight, to 
the last words that have been 
spoken. It is true that the Lord 
has instituted the office of a Seventy 



for the express purpose of pro- 
claiming the word of God to the 
nations of the earth ; and in our la- 
bors among our brethren we have 
discovered this, that more than half 
of them have already filled mis- 
sions in the world, and, although 
we now have comparatively few do- 
ing missionary work out of the vast 
army of the Seventy, there are, 
however, many who are supporting 
their sons now laboring as elders in 
the missionary field — some of them 
having two or three — the expense 
of whom are being met by their 
fathers, who are numbered among 
the Seventy. So I don't think that 
we ought to reproach our brethren 
of the Seventy because of the few- 
ness of their numbers now in the 
field, for they have done valiant ser- 
vice, and many of them have filled 
one or two, and some of them three 
missions abroad, and I glory in the 
work which they have performed. 

Our missionaries labor, it has 
been said, without pay and without 
compensation. It seems to me, how- 
ever, that this is a very great mis- 
take, to say that they are not com- 
pensated for their work. It is my 
faith and belief that all who labor 
for Zion, her interests and welfare, 
both at home and abroad, are the 
best paid people in all the world. 
Their names are upon the payroll, 
and the Lord is their paymaster. 

We read in the epistle of James, 
in the New Testament, where atten- 
tion is called to an ordinance of the 
Church : "Is any sick among you ? 
let him call for the elders of the 
church, and let them pray over him, 
anointing him with oil in the name 
of the Lord ; and the prayer of faith 
shall save the sick, and the Lord 
shall raise him up ; and if he have 
committed sins, they shall be for- 
given him." How can that be? 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Has this ordinance, the laying on of 
hands for the healing of the sick, 
anything to do with bringing about 
the remission of sins? We know, 
as Latter-day Saints, that the ordin- 
ance of baptism has been instituted 
in the Church for the express pur- 
pose of bringing us the remission 
of sins and that this ordinance of 
laying on hands for the healing of 
the sick is different from that. How 
do you obtain remission of sins? 
Through faith in God and repent- 
ance from sin and being buried by 
baptism for the remission of sins? 
And what follows this remission of 
sins, if our faith has been sincere 
and if our repentance has been 
genuine ? When we have been bur- 
ied by baptism for the remission of 
those sins, we come forth from 
that watery grave sweet and clean, 
even as a new-born babe, and then 
only are we prepared to receive that 
other ordinance, the laying on of 
hands for the reception of the holy 
Spirit; because the Spirit of God 
can not dwell in an unclean tab- 
ernacle. Our sins must first be 
remitted. It follows, then, that 
when we have had and do have the 
Spirit of God, that our sins have 
been forgiven. When men labor in 
any calling, go out and administer 
to the sick and enjoy the spirit of 
their calling, they have the Spirit 
of God, and their sins, of course, 
have been remitted or they would 
not have that Spirit. So with you, 
my brethren of the Seventy, if you 
will go and labor and magnify your 
calling, proclaiming the word of 
God and enjoying the spirit of 
your mission, which is the Spirit of 
God, your sins have been remitted 
and you are forgiven, and the power 
of God will be upon you. That is 
your compensation that is God's 
pay. Labor then for the salvation 



of souls, and God will reward you. 
Therefore, put your trust in Him 
and receive your compensation, the 
remission of your sins, the compan- 
ionship of God's Spirit, which I 
pray we may all do, in the name of 
Jesus Christ. Amen.

PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 

CLOSING ADDRESS. 

Knowledge of Gospel principles most 
essential for missionary service — 
Other missionary requisites, are, 
love and humility— First Presidency 
annoyed by unnecessary questions — 
Indignant repudiation of false state- 
ment concerning attitude on prohi- 
biten — Saints advised to endeavor 
to perfect their lives — Import nee 
of teachers' duties— The Saints en- 
joined to pray. 

I want to read a passage of the 
scripture which will apply not only 
to the Seventies but to all the Saints : 

"Wherefore, honest men, and wise 
men should be sought for dligently. 
and good men and wise men, ye should 
observe to uphold; otherwise whatso- 
ever is less than these cometh of evil. 

"And I give unto you a command- 
ment, that ye shall forsake all evil 
and cleave unto all good, that ye shall 
live by every word which proceedeth 
forth out of the mouth of God; 

"For He will give unto the faithful 
line upon line, precept uoon precept; 
and I will try you and prove you here- 
with : 

"And whoso layeth down his life in 
my cause, for My name's sake, shall 
find it again, even life eternal: 

"Therefore be not afraid of your 
enemies, for I have decreed in My 
heart, sayeth the Lord, that I will 
prove you in all things, whether you 
will abide in My covenant, even unto 
death, that you may be found worthy; 

"For if ye will not abide in My 
covenant, ye are not worthy of Me." 

I think that this passage of scrip- 



138 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



ture opens to us a vast field and 
subject for thought and reflection, 
for research, and careful attention. 
I believe in all the words that have 
been spoken by the Holy Prophets 
concerning the dispensation of the 
fulness of times and the establish- 
ment of the kingdom of God in the 
earth. I believe it is good to seek 
knowledge out of the best books, to 
learn the histories of nations, to be 
able to comprehend the purposes of 
God with reference to the nations of 
the earth ; and I believe that one of 
the most important things and per- 
haps more important to us than 
studying the history of the world, is 
that we study and become thorough- 
ly acquainted with the principles of 
the Gospel, that they may be estab- 
lished in our hearts and souls, above 
all other things, to qualify us to go 
out into the world to preach and 
teach them. We may know all about 
the philosophy of the ages and the 
history of the nations of the earth ; 
we may study the wisdom and 
knowledge of man and get all the 
information that we can acquire in 
a lifetime of research and study, but 
all of it put together will never 
qualify any one to become a minis- 
ter of the Gospel unless he has the 
knowledge and spirit of the first 
principles of the Gospel of Jesus 
Christ. 

Another thing — one of the indis- 
pensible qualifications of the Elders 
who go out into the world to preach 
is humility, meekness and love un- 
feigned, for the well-being and the 
salvation of the human family, and 
the desire to establish peace and 
righteousness in the earth among 
men. We can not preach the gospel 
of Christ without this spirit of hu- 
mility, meekness, faith in God and 
reliance upon His promises and 
word to us. You may learn all the 



wisdom of men, but that will not 
qualify you to do these things like 
the humble, guiding influence of 
the Spirit of God will. "Pride goeth 
before destruction, and an haughty 
spirit before a fall." 

It is necessary for the Elders who 
go out into the world to preach to 
study the spirit of the gospel, which 
is the spirit of humility, the spirit of 
meekness and of true devotion to 
whatever purpose you set your hand 
or your mind to do. If it is to 
preach the gospel, we should devote 
ourselves to the duties of that min- 
istry, and we ought to strive with 
the utmost of our ability to qualify 
ourselves to perform that specific 
labor, and the way to do it is to 
live so that the Spirit of God will 
have communion and be present 
with us to direct us in every mo- 
ment and hour of our ministry, 
night and day. It is surprising to 
hear the multitude of questions that 
are continuously sent to the Presi- 
dency of the Church, and to others 
of my brethren who are in leading 
positions, for information upon 
some of the most simple things that 
pertain to the Gospel. Hundreds 
of questions, communications, and 
letters are sent to us from time to 
time asking information and in- 
struction on matters that are so 
plainly written in the revelations of 
God — contained in the Book of 
Mormon, the Doctrine and Cove- 
nants, the Pearl of Great Price, and 
the Bible — it seems that any one 
who can read should understand. 
Why Elders and Bishops and mis- 
sionaries should be under the neces- 
sity of writing to inquire about 
many of these things is mysterious 
to me. They have the books and 
other sources of information within 
their reach ; they should have every 
facility to acquire the knowledge 



PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 



139 



that is necessary to fit them for their 
duties, if they will only pay attention 
to them ; but they don't always do it. 
Some people seem to like to ask 
questions. I have been so bored at 
times with questioners that I have 
said to them: "Answer your own 
questions yourselves and submit 
them to me, and I will tell you 
whether you are right or wrong, as 
near as I can. But if we were to 
devote ourselves to answering ques- 
tions that the Bishop should answer 
for the people, and attend to du- 
ties that should be attended to by 
the Teachers in the wards, we would 
have very little time for doing any- 
thing else. When the brethren and 
sisters want to know anything about 
temple work, about the ordinances, 
about the precepts and principles of 
the Gospel or the obligations of 
members in the Church, let them go 
to their Bishops and find out; and, 
if the Bishops can't inform them, 
let them go to the presidents of their 
stakes, and let the president of the 
stake and his counselors and the 
Bishop and his counselors get to- 
gether, if necessary, and answer the 
question. Then if they are not sat- 
isfied about it let them appeal to the 
Presidency of the Church or to the 
Twelve, or the Seventy or Presid- 
ing Bishopric as the case may re- 
quire, and possibly we may help you 
out. 

There is a disposition — I feel al- 
most indignant to refer to it at all, 
but I am led to believe that there is 
a feeling and disposition on the part 
of some of our brethren to miscon- 
strue my position, my feeling and 
my desire with reference to the tem- 
perance question. I thought I ex- 
pressed myself here last night as 
plainly as a man could do it, and 
yet the very remarks that I made 
here last evening, before the priest- 



hood meeting, have been, I am 
told, so misinterpreted and miscon- 
strued that I am beset to know what 
I meant, and as Brother Golden 
said : "I am going to tell you some- 
thing." I started out in this minis- 
try in 1854, a boy of fifteen years of 
age. From that hour until now I 
have never relented nor relaxed, one 
moment, in my advocacy of abstin- 
ence from strong drink, and my ad- 
vocacy of temperance and prohibi- 
tion, wherever prohibition can be ef- 
fected ; I believe in it. I believe that 
the time will come and that it is 
close by, when the people of this 
stalte will have to join in the proces- 
sion of other states and adopt a law 
of state-wide prohibition ; I believe 
the time will come when they will 
be forced to do it, to keep in line 
with the other states in the Union. 

I am delighted with the effort that 
is being put forth in Great Britain — 
the motherland and the fatherhr"" 1 
of many of the Latter-day Saints, 
and one of the most fruitful nurs- 
eries of the Church, where people 
have been let loose to indulge in 
drunkenness, to wallow in the de- 
basing evils of the "public house," 
the "beer shop" and to indulge in 
every species of licentiousness 
which leads to degradation and 'pov- 
erty. Many of the mayors of the 
great boroughs and cities are prin- 
cipal owners of the ale houses, and 
dispensaries of intoxicating drinks. 
Now the authorities of that great 
nation, the leaders of the people are 
waking up to these monstrous evils 
and are setting to work with a will 
and a determination to establish 
temperance in that land. It will be 
the salvation of our mother country, 
if they will only do it as Russia has 
done it. I propose to continue to 
preach abstinence and to advocate 
the cause of temperance ; I not only 



140 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



believe in and will advocate this, but 
I will also advocate and strive to the 
best of my ability to use every op- 
portunity or power within my reach 
for prohibition, in wisdom, and not 
in unwisdom. If I go to any extreme 
at all, in any matter, I hope it will 
be in the cause of justice, truth, 
temperance, righteousness and hon- 
esty of life and purpose. I may get 
extreme in matters of that kind, but 
I may not be so extreme as some 
people are in questions of policy. 

I have enjoyed the spirit of our 
conference. I feel that we have been 
blessed in our assemblies ; that much 
has been said of a very important 
and precious character to us, and I 
sincerely hope that the spirit of the 
conference will abide with us, will 
go with us to our homes, and that 
we will be able to continue to build 
on the foundations of the Gospel of 
the Son of God until we become per- 
fect even as our Father in heaven is 
perfect, according to the sphere and 
intelligence that we act in and pos- 
sess. I do not expect that any of 
us will ever become in mortality 
quite so perfect as God is perfect ; 
but in the spheres in which we are 
called to act, and according to the 
capacjty and breadth of intelligence 
that we possess, in our sphere and 
in the exercise of the talent, the 
ability and intelligence that God has 
given to us, we may become as per- 
fect in our sphere as God is perfect 
in His higher and more exalted 
sphere. I believe that. 

Now may the Lord bless Israel. 
May He bless our presiding Patri- 
arch, who will give us a parting 
blessing in the adjournment of this 
conference. May the Lord bless 
the presidents of the stakes of Zion 
and their counselors, and the high 
councils of the stakes, and the Bish- 
ops and their counselors, and all 



who are called to act in the very im- 
portant callings as teachers among 
the people. I don't know of any 
duty that is more sacred, or more 
necessary, if it is carried out as it 
should be, than the duties of the 
teachers who visit the homes of the 
people, who pray with them, who 
admonish them to virtue and honor, 
to unity, to love, and to faith in and 
fidelity to the cause of Zion ; who 
strive to settle uncertainties in the 
minds of the people and bring them 
to the standard of the knowledge 
that they should possess in the Gos- 
pel of Jesus Christ. May all the 
people open their doors, call in the 
members of their families and re- 
spect the visits of the teachers to 
their homes, and join with them in 
striving to bring about a better con- 
dition, if possible, in the home than 
ordinarily exists. If you can ad- 
vance, try to aid the teachers to 
help you make that advancement. 

May God bless Israel in all her 
abidings. Remember our Eld^-s 
who are laboring throughout the 
nations of the earth, in your 
prayers ; and remember your 
prayers, for the Lord has enjoined 
it upon us that we shall pray, morn- 
ing and evening. And the prophets 
of the Book of Mormon have en- 
joined upon us that we should carry 
with us always the spirit of prayer 
in our hearts, morning, noon and 
night, and that we should pray for 
the blessings of the Lord upon our 
families, our farms, our flocks, our 
herds, our business, and everything 
that we possess in the world. Do 
not forget to pray. Don't suppose 
for a moment that you are as safe 
and secure in the favor of the Lord 
when you feel independent of Him 
as you will be if you feel your de- 
pendence upon Him all the day long. 
God bless you. Amen. 



PATRIARCH HYRUM G. SMITH.

The congregation sang the hymn : 

We thank Thee, O God for a Prophet, 
To guide us in these latter days; 

We thank Thee for sending the gospel 
To lighten our minds with its rays. 

PATRIARCH HYRUM G. SMITH. 

BLESSING AND BENEDICTION. 

Our Father who art in heaven, at 
the close of this conference we re- 
turn unto Thee the thanks and the 
gratitude of our hearts 'for Thy 
many kindnesses unto us, for the 
words that have been spoken, for 
the revelation of Thy works and the 
work of Thy Son, Jesus Christ, and 
of His life and mission in the world. 
We pray Thee to bless and sanctify 
the teachings given at this confer- 
ence to the good of Thy people, and 
the furtherance of Thy work here 
upon the earth. Wilt Thou sanctify 
the songs and music which have 
been heard in this conference, to the 
good of all those who have heard 
the same. 

Wilt Thou remember Thy people 
who have been gathered together 
here in conference. Let Thy peace 
and blessings go with them to their 
homes, that they may have with 
them a constant and thorough un- 
derstanding of Thy word as it has 
been taught here ; that they may not 
misconstrue any of the teachings, 
and that they may have moral cour- 
age and strength to obey them in 
their lives, that they may thereby be 
worthy to receive Thy blessings. 

Now Father, as Thy servant 
whom thou hast called to bless Thy 
people, I seal upon this great multi- 
tude in this conference the blessings 
which Thou art willing to bestow 



upon us, Thy people, and upon Thy 
servants whom Thou has called to 
preside and to teach Thy people. 
Wilt Thou bless those who have 
heard these teachings, that they may 
take them to their homes and put 
them into practice. 

Help us, O Father, to do Thy will 
and to receive Thy blessings with 
humility and gratitude. Let Thy 
blessings go with this people to then- 
homes, that no ill or evil shall befall 
them, that they may go with Thy 
benediction, with Thy smile and ap- 
probation upon them ; may they by 
their good works, by their testi- 
monies, and by their loving kindne c ■ 
to their neighbors, influence many 
. others of Thy children to learn the 
truths Thou hast made known. 

Dismiss us now with Thy bless- 
ings, help us in all our endeavor-; to 
serve Thee and keep Thy command- 
ments, and unto Thee we will 
ascribe the honor and the praise for- 
ever, through Thy Son, Jesus 
Christ. Amen.

wards and organizations of the 
Church in Zion, love and greeting. 

We, the Elders and members of 
the Church of Christ, scattered in 
the nations of Europe, beseech for 
you a splendid outpouring of the 
Holy Ghost in the annual confer- 
ence, and the continued showering 
down of the choicest favors and 
blessings of God upon you in all 
your abiding places. 

You reside in the promised land, 
where the Lord has tenderly gath- 
ered you; we are yet scattered 
abroad in the earth. Your feet are 
planted in pleasant places and all 
your paths are peace ; we are among 
a people multitudes of whom find 
pleasure only in unrighteousness 
and tread the downward paths that 
lead to destruction and death. You 
are privileged to meet and worship 
the Lord in undisturbed tranquility : 
we meet under unfavorable circum- 
stances, some of our branches hav- 
ing been disorganized and many of 
our meetings suspended. Your pray- 
ers and songs of praise ascend in 
sweet cadence and joyous strains to 
the ears of the God of Sabaoth ; ours 
too, have been heard and answered. 
The word of the Lord falls upon 
your ears as a benediction from the 
lips of inspired men whose hearts 
are very near the Lord, while the 
elders are being rapidly withdrawn 
from us and we feel keenly their ab- 
sence. You dwell in beautiful 
homes among the pure in heart, 



while we are surrounded by Baby- 
lon. You inhabit the hills and val- 
leys of Zion, and through the favor 
of God and the blessings of in- 
dustry the earth yields in her abun- 
dance and strength ; in Europe the 
hills and valleys are torn and fur- 
rowed by trench and shell, and have 
become graveyards and fields of 
slaughter, and the otherwise fruitful 
ground is soaked in blood and glut- 
ted with the bodies of men. Your 
children ''grow up like calves of the 
stall," fed by the choicest inspira- 
tion of heaven and through your 
sons have the people of many na- 
tions been blessed ; our children are 
surrounded by fearful temptations, 
and they face unpromising pros- 
pects — some are already orphaned 
and some are denied the presence 
and protection of fathers and older 
brothers, and the minds of others 
are full of dread of the future. 

Nevertheless, we rejoice with you 
in all the blessings of prosperity 
and peace enjoyed by the body of 
the Church in Zion. We also are 
of the "body of Christ, but members 
in particular," members far removed 
from the head and trunk, but for all 
that, none the less a part of the 
body, and we are deeply interested 
in the welfare of the whole. We 
rejoice in the knowledge that, while 
we may be the "less honorable, and 
weaker members," yet we are not 
forgotten by the body which feels 
after us and is kindly solicitous of 
our well-being. 

In behalf of the Latter-day Saints 
in the nations of Europe, we thank

you, the body of the Saints and each 
member composing the body, for 
your considerate remembrance of us 
in your recent liberal, contributions 
to assist those of your members in 
these countries, who, because of 
wars and contentions, have been re- 
duced to privation and want. The 
Church has ever been mindful of her 
children and we who now have an- 
other instance of her mercy, extend 
to you our heartfelt gratitude and 
humbly acknowledge the open hand 
of our Father in heaven, whom we 
love and whom we worship in the 
name of Jesus Christ, His Son and 
our Redeemer. As it has been 
clearly shown that we have need of 
you, so do we pray that we may 
have power, through faith in God 
the Father and His Son Jesus 
Christ, to remain true to the Gospel 
we have received, and seek to work 
righteousness in the earth that you 
may also ever feel that you have 
need of us. 

In all our tribulations we rejoice 
in the knowledge and testimony of 
the truth, and count it a favor that 
we are found worthy to suffer af- 
fliction for Christ's sake and the 
Gospel's. We beseech you, broth- 
ers and sisters, pray for us that we 
may receive faith and strength to 



endure to the end so that, if not in 
this life, then in the life to come, 
we may be saved and found worthy 
to dwell with you in the Celestial 
kingdom of our Father in heaven. 

In the love of God and the fellow- 
ship of Jesus Christ, we salute all 
the Saints who have covenanted to 
serve the Most High "and the Lord 
make you to increase and abound in 
love one toward another, and to- 
ward all men, even as we do toward 
you, to the end that He may estab- 
lish us in holiness toward God, even 
the Father, at the coming of our 
Lord Jesus Christ with all His 
Saints." Amen. 

Hyrum M. Smith.

P. S. — The elders still remaining 
in these lands are in good health, 
and only need the cheerful en- 
couragement of their loved ones in 
Zion in order to remain in good 
spirits and hope. 

Let not the parents, relatives and 
friends of the missionaries worry 
and fret, we are in the hands of the 
Lord and we know, as you must 
know, that He can take care of us 
and preserve us while we are here, 
as well as He could if we were home 
with you.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Prayer was offered by Elder Hy- 
rum G. Smith, presiding Patriarch 
of the Church. 

The choir and congregation sang : 
"Come, come, ye Saints." 

THE SOLEMN ASSEMBLY. 

The quorums of the Priesthood 
and officers were present, in solemn 
assembly, for the purpose of voting, 
in that capacity, for General Au- 
thorities of the Church. The quo- 
rums and officers in nine divisions 
voted in the following order: First 
Presidency ; Apostles ; Patriarchs ; 
Presidents 'of ■st&kgs, Counselors 
and High Councilors; High 
Priests; Seventies; Elders; Bish- 
ops and Counselors, and the Lesser 
Priesthood. 

They were arranged as follows : 
First Presidency and Apostles, in 
their respective places on the stand ; 
Patriarchs, south wing of the stand ; 
Presidents of stakes, Counselors 
and High Counselors, lower stands 
and left front ; High Priests, left 
center of main hall ; Seventies, right 
center of main hall ; Elders back 
left of main hall ; Bishops and coun- 
selors, left wing of the stand, Les- 
ser Priesthood back of the north 
left isle. The remaining portions 
of the building, including the galler- 
ies, were occupied by members at 
large. 

ORDER OF VOTING. 

President Heber J. Grant stated 

that in voting, each quorum of the 
Priesthood would rise, and' the mem- 
bers voting would raise their right 
handsy and then be quickly seated 
so that the process of voting might 
be done as quickly as possible. 
Those wishing to vote in the nega- 
tive would vote in like manner. 

The order of voting was as fol- 
lows : 



First. — The First Presidency. 

Second. — The Apostles. 

Third. — Patriarchs. 

Fourth. — The Presidents of 
stakes, their Counselors, and High 
Councilors. . 

Fifth.— High Priests. 

Sixth. — Seventies. 

Seventh. — Elders. 

Eighth. — Bishops and their 
Counselors. 

Ninth. — The Lesser Priesthood 
(Priests, Teachers and Deacons.) 

Tenth. — All the members of the 
Church present. 

Practically the whole body of the 
hall was occupied completely by the 
Priesthood, and the scene from the 
stand, as the many thousands of 
men stood up, quorum by quorum, 
to vote, their right hands raised to 
the square, was the most impressive 
stately, and dignified religious sol- 
emnity that the eyes of man ever 
beheld, not to speak of the scene, 
when the whole audience ten thous- 
and in number, covenanted unan- 
imously in like manner to sustain 
their chosen leaders. 

OFFICERS VOTED FOR. 

Following are the officers voted 
upon, and the introductory remarks 
by: 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT. 

We will now present to the con- 
gregation the General Authorities 
of the Church, those holding the 
Priesthood only. Inasmuch as there 
will be ten votes called, compris- 
ing the different orders of the 
Priesthood, and the assembly as a 
whole, and it will take so much time, 
only the General Authorities will be 
presented at this conference. 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT.

In each instance President Grant 
announced the motion to sustain the 
authority voted upon and called for 
the affirmative vote. Following the 
response, the negative of the ques- 
tion was presented, and should there 
be any who favored it, they were 
requested to make known their will. 

The voting throughout, which 
was completed at 10:37 o'clock, was 
unanimous without exception in 
favor of the affirmative. 

A soprano solo, "A Voice in the 
Wilderness," was sung by Mrs. 
Brewerton. 

President Grant gave notice that 
an overflow meeting would now be 
opened in the Assembly Hall, and 
he appointed the First Council of 
Seventy to take charge, and devote 
the 'time and their remarks to the 
memory of President Joseph F. 
Smith. 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

We regret that all of the Saints cannot be present in one building to 
hear the remarks that may be made upon this occasion. We also regret 
that the men who stand at the head of this great body of Seventies could 
not remain here to partake of the spirit of this occasion. But we feel that 
those who have met in the Assembly Hall are entitled to hear some of the 
general authorities of the Church speak upon the life and labors, and bear 
witness of their love and reverence for, and their faith in, our beloved 
prophet, the late President Joseph F. Smith, who has departed this life 
since we last met in general conference. 

• THE SPIRIT GIVETH LIFE. 

Inasmuch as all that is said here today will be reported, and as our 
brethren of the Seventy can read what is said, they will miss only the spirit

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



of this occasion, which I feel in my heart — if the Lord will only bless us 
abundantly — will be considerable of a loss ; because, after all is said and 
done, in all the labors of the Latter-day Saints, it is the spirit that counts, 
for the spirit giveth life, and the dead letter killeth ; but we shall hope and 
pray that the spirit of this occasion will find echo in the hearts of our 
brethren who have just left us, when they read today's proceedings. 

A PLEDGE OF FAITHFUL SERVICE. 

I feel humble, beyond any language with which God has endowed me 
to express it, in standing before you here this morning, occupying the 
position in which you have just voted to sustain me. I recall standing 
before an audience in Tooele, after having been sustained as president of 
that stake, when I was a young man twenty-three years of age, pledging to 
that audience the best that was in me. I stand here today in all humility, 
acknowledging my own weakness, my own lack of wisdom and informa- 
tion, and my lack of the ability to occupy the exalted position in which 
you have voted to sustain me. But as I said as a boy in Tooele, I say here 
today: that by and with the help of the Lord, I shall do the best that I 
can to fulfil every obligation that shall rest upon me as President of the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, to the full extent of my 
ability. 

I will ask no man to be more liberal with his means, than I am with 
mine, in proportion to what he possesses, for the advancement of God's 
Kingdom. I will ask no man to observe the Word of Wisdom any more 
closely than I will observe it. I will ask no man to be more conscientious 
and prompt in the payment of his tithes and his offerings than I will be. 
I will ask no man to be more ready and willing to come early and to go 
late, and to labor with full power of mind and body, than I will labor, 
always in humility. I hope and pray for the blessings of the Lord, 
acknowledging freely and frankly, that without the Lord's blessings it will 
be an impossibility for me to make a success of the high calling whereunto 
I have been called. But, like Nephi of old, I know that the Lord makes 
no requirements of the children of men, save he will prepare a way for 
them, whereby they can accomplish the thing which he has required. With 
this knowledge in my heart, I accept the great responsibility, without 
fear of the consequences, knowing that God will sustain me as he has 
sustained all of my predecessors who have occupied this position, pro- 
vided always, that I shall labor in humility and in diligence, ever seeking 
for the guidance of his Holy Spirit : and this I shall endeavor to do. 

THE STANDARD OF ACTION. 

I shall not occupy your time by reading Section 121 of the Doctrine 
jnd Covenants. I will leave that for each and every one of those before 
me, and those to the right and the left, holding the priesthood', and as 
many of the audience as may feel so disposed, to read it when they go 
home. With the help of the Lord, I shall endeavor, standing at the head 
of the Priesthood of God upon the earth, to exercise the authority that has 
come to me in keeping with that wonderful revelation: "No power or 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT.

influence can or ought to be maintained by virtue of the Priesthood, only 
by persuasion, by long suffering, by gentleness, and meekness, and by 
love unfeigned." God being my helper, the priesthood that I hold, the 
position that I occupy, shall be exercised in accordance with these words 
that I have quoted to you. We can do nothing, as recorded in that rev- 
elation, only as we exercise love and charity and kindness — love unfeigned. 
With the help of the Lord that is exactly how I shall administer, to the best 
of my ability, the priesthood of God that has come to me. 

I could stand here and occupy all of the remaining time, with the 
hundred and one thoughts that have come into my mind, in connection 
with the duties that devolve upon me ; but I am anxious that my counselors 
should speak to you here this morning, and I am anxious to pay my trib- 
ute of respect to those men who have preceded me. I take no credit to 
myself for occupying the position that has come to, me. I realize that 
failure will be the result if I do not give the Lord the credit for calling me 
to, this position, and seek for the light of his Spirit to guide me in all 
that I shall do. 

PRESIDENT SNOW'S TESTIMONY CONCERNING THE PROPHET JOSEPH. 

I desire to read to you a testimony regarding the first man who occu- 
pied the position as President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints — the Prophet Joseph Smith, Jr. This testimony was given a short 
time before the death of the late beloved President of the Church, Lorenzo 
Snow, and will be found in the current June number of the Improvement 
Era, in an article written by his son, Elder LeRoi C. Snow. He said, 
referring to his father 

"His work on earth was nearly done, his mission was almost finished; he 
was about to return to his Maker, and with all the remaining strength of his 
soul he testified concerning the divinity of the work in which he and the 
Prophet Joseph Smith commenced their life's work when young men: 

" 'A word or two about Joseph Smith. Perhaps there are very few men now 
living who were so well acquainted with Joseph Smith, the Prophet as T was. 
I was, with him often-times. I visited him in his family, ate at his table, as- 
sociated with him under various circumstances, and had private interviews with 
him for counsel. I know that Joseph Smith was a Prophet of God; I know 
that he was an honorable man, a moral man, and that he had the respect of 
those who were acquainted with him. The Lord has shown me most clearly 
and completely that he was a Prophet of God, and that he held the holy 
priesthood and the authority to baptize people for the remission of their sins, 
and to lay hands upon them for the reception of the Holy Ghost, that they 
might receive a knowledge themselves in relation to these things. I am one 
who has received from the Lord the strongest revelation concerning the truth 
of this work. That manifestation was with me powerfully, for hours and hours, 
and whatever circumstance may occur in my life, as long as memory lasts 
this perfect knowledge wlil remain with me. 

As to the testimony that Lorenzo Snow, the Prophet of the Lord, in 
later years had, in this same article his testimony is recorded. 

"About, three weeks after his baptism, Lorenzo Snow received a wonder- 
ful vision which he tells in his own language, in his journal, as follows: 

" 'I had no sooner opened my lips in an effort to pray than I heard a 
sound, just above my head, like the rustling of silken robes, and immediately 
the Spirit of God descended upon me, completely enveloping my whole per-

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



son, filling me, from the crown of my head to the soles of my feet, and O, the 
joy and happiness I felt! No language can describe the almost instantaneous 
transition from a dense cloud of mental and spiritual darkness into a refulgence 
of light and knowledge, as it was at that time imparted to my understanding. 
I then received a perfect knowledge that God lives, that Jesus Christ is the 
Son of God, and of the restoration of the Holy Priesthood, and the fulness of 
the Gospel. It was a complete baptism — a tangible immersion in the heavenly 
principle or element (the gift of) the Holy Ghost; and even more real and 
physical in its effects upon every part of my system than the immersion by 
water; dispelling forever, so long as reason and memory lasts, all possibility 
of doubt or fear in relation to the fact handed down to us historically, that the 
'Babe of Bethlehem' is truly the Son of God; also the fact that he is now being 
revealed to the children of men, and communicating knowledge, the same as 
in the apostolic times. I was perfectly satisfied, as well as I might be, for 
my expectations were more than realized, I think I may safely say in an in- 
finite degree. . . . That night as I retired to rest the same wonderful 
manifestations were repeated, and continued to be for several successive nights. 
The sweet remembrance of those glorious experiences from that time to the 
present, bring them fresh before me, imparting an inspiring influence which 
pervades my whole being, and I trust will to the close of my earthly exist- 
ence. 

CONFIRMING TESTIMONY OF MANY OTHERS. 

I have listened to the testimony of all of the apostles who have lived, 
in these valleys of the mountains from Brigham Young to Josenh F. 
Smith, and have heard them tell of their personal acrmaintance with the 
Prophet Joseph Smith. The testimony of Joseph F. Smith was the 
testimony of one who as a child knew the Prophet and loved him. The 
testimony of Brigham Young, Jr., was in the same class; but all the 
other testimonies were those of men of experience, men of oower, men 
of individual determination, men who had wills and minds of their own, 
men who could not be led bv a man who did not teach the truth. 

The testimony of Brigham Young, of John Taylor, of Lorenzo Snow, 
Wilford Woodruff, Erastus Snow, George A. Smith, Heber C. Kimball, 
and of others who have held the apostleship, who have held the priest- 
hood of God and who knew the Prophet Joseph Smith intimately ; of 
every true Latter-day Saint, man and woman, including the testimony 
of my own dear departed' mother, than whom no sweeter, purer, nobler 
soul ever lived; the testimony of Eliza R. Snow, Zina D. H. Young, 
Bathsheba W. Smith, "Aunt Em." Wells, and others too numerous to 
mention. — was of their individual knowledge regarding the uprightness 
of the life of Joseph Smith, regarding the integrity of the man, regarding 
the inspiration of the living God that attended him in all of his labors. 

THE TRANSFIGURATION OF BRIGHAM YOUNG. 

I have the testimonies from George Romney, from my mother, from 
other relatives of mine and from scores of people, that, upon the day when 
Sidney Rigdon endeavored to steal the Church of Christ and to become 
the leader, God manifested to the people upon that occasion, by the trans- 
figuration of Brigham Young — so that he appeared as Joseph Smith, so 
that he spoke as Joseph Smith — and thereby the testimony came to the 
Saints that Brigham Young was the man to succeed Joseph Smith the 
Prophet of God. 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT.

PERSONAL TESTIMONY CONCERNING PRESIDENT BRIGHAM YOUNG. 

I became acquainted with Brigham Young when I was a little child 
six years of age ; from that time until the day of his death I was. intimate 
with him. I was as intimate with one of his boys — the late Feramorz L. 
Young — from the time that we were little children until he left to go to 
Mexico — as any two boys ever could be. Perhaps no three young men 
were ever more intimate than Heber J. Grant, Feramorz L. Young and 
General Richard W. Young. We grew up together. We slept together. 
We played together. We attended Sunday school together. We attended 
day school together. 

I was almost as familiar in the homes of President Brigham Young 
as I was in the home of my own mother. In one home, that of Aunt Emily 
Partridge Young, if I was hungry I felt as free to go in and' ask for some- 
thing to eat there as in ray own home. I have spent hours and hours, as a 
child, in the rooms of Eliza R. Snow, listening to her counsel and advice, 
and hearing her relate incidents in the life of Joseph Smith the Prophet, 
and bearing witness of the wonderful blessings of God to Brigham 
Young. As I say, I was familiar with the Prophet Brigham Young. I 
knelt down time and time again in his home in the Lion House at family 
pravers, as a child and as a young man : and I bear witness that as a little 
child, upon more than one occasion, because of the inspiration of the 
Lord to Brigham Young while he was supplicating God for guidance, I 
have lifted my head, turned and looked at the place where Brigham Young 
was praying, to see if the Lord was not there. It seemed to me that he 
talked to the Lord as one man would talk to another. I can bear witness 
of his kindness, of his love to me as an individual, of his love of God and 
of the inspiration of the Lord that came to him as he stood where I am 
standing, when I had the privilege of being in the audience and listening 
to his inspiring words. 

REVELATION TO PRESIDENT JOHN TAYLOR. 

I was called into the Council of the Twelve Aoostles bv a revelation 
of, the Lord to President Tohn Taylor, and from the time that I entered 
the Council of the Twelve, two years after Tohn Taylor was made 
President of the Church, until the day of his death, I met with him, week 
after week, in the Endowment house, and I know that he was a servant 
of the living God ; I know that the inspiration of the Lord came to him : 
and I know that upon all occasions, whenever he said : "This is what 
the Lord desires," and his associates in the council of the apostles sus- 
tained his position, that upon every occasion he was vindicated and the 
inspiration of the Lord to him showed that his wisdom bv the power of 
God, had been superior to the wisdom of other men. Several times I 
have gone to meetings in the old Endowment house, knowing that a cer- 
tain matter was to be discussed and mv mind was as perfectly set upon a 
certain position on that question as it is possible for a man to have his 
mind set. I believe I am as decided in my opinions as the majority of 
neople-. I have heard it said that there is nobodv as stubborn as a 
Scotchman except a Dutchman : and I am Scotch on my father's 
side and Dutch on my mother's (laughter). While I have gone 
to meetings in the old Endowment house determined' in favor of a certain 



8 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



line of policy, I have willingly and freely voted for the exact opposite of 
that policy, because of the inspiration of the Lord that came to John 
, Taylor. Upon every such occasion the servant of the Lord, President 
Taylor, was vindicated, and his superior judgment, by the inspiration of 
the Lord, asserted itself in favor of those things that were for the best 
good of the people. 

I could relate circumstance after circumstance when the apostles have 
been sent out to accomplish certain labors under the inspiration of the 
Lord to John Taylor, when they thought they could not accomplish the 
labors, they have returned and been able to bear testimony that by 
and with the help of the Lord they had been able to accomplish the labor 
placed upon them by President Taylor, the Prophet of the Lord. If time 
would permit, I would like to relate some of these incidents, because they 
are faith-promoting, but I have not the time. 

PRESIDENT WILFORD WOODRUFF A TRUE PROPHET OF GOD. 

I can bear witness that Wilford Woodruff was in very deed a servant 
of the living God and a true Prophet of God. Wilford Woodruff, a humble 
man, converted and baptized hundreds of people in a few months in Here- 
fordshire, England. In eight months, as I now remember it, he baptized 
between fifteen hundred and two thousand souls. I believe that no other 
man who ever walked the face of the earth was a greater converter of 
souls to the Gospel of Jesus Christ. He was a man of the most wonderful 
and marvelous humility ; a man who had never been engaged in any great 
business affairs ; a man who had devoted himself to farming, who had 
been engaged in raising fruits and cultivating the soil ; a humble man, of 
whom I had heard many people say that he lacked the ability to preside 
over the Church of Christ. But I want to bear witness to you that, under 
the inspiration of the Lord, and because of the humility of the man, be- 
cause of his godlike life and because God loved him, he was blessed upon 
more than one occasion with wisdom that was superior to all the wisdom 
of the bright financial minds in the Church. 

BEGINNING OF THE SUGAR INDUSTRY IN UTAH. 

President Woodruff announced that the Lord would like the great 
business of manufacturing sugar established in our midst, and a committee 
w?' appointed from the directorate of two of the largest Church institu- 
tions, two of the most substantial in all Israel, to look into the matter. 
Thev investigated the advisability of establishing the beet sugar industry 
in this State and unanimously reported adversely. President Woodruff 
was not satisfied. Another committee was appointed. I was on the first 
committee and he appointed me on the second committee. I begged 
to be excused, because I had already formed mv opinion, had already 
signed mv name to a report, but he would not listen to my request to 
be excused. We went into the matter again, thoroughly and carefullv, 
and the second committee reported adversely. President Woodruff 
said : "Never mind the report. The inspiration to rne is to establish the 
sugar industry." 

I was called upon a mission, and a letter was given to me in connec- 
tion with other members of the Council of the Apostles, and we were ?,ent

out to ask men to subscribe for stock in the Utah Sugar Company. I took 
individual letters to different men asking them to subscribe. I delivered a 
letter to the late David Eccles, than whom I never met a clearer-headed 
business man in my life, and I have met men who draw their hundred 
thousand dollars and more every year in salary. He had a comprehensive 
grasp on business affairs which to me was superior to that of any man I 
ever met. David smiled when the letter was presented to him, signed by 
President Woodruff and his counselors, asking him to invest five thousand 
dollars, or seven thousand five hundred dollars. He said : "Well, I would 
like to get off at the lowest figure. You can put me down for five thousand 
dollars." Then he added: "I hope they will buy lumber from me, so I 
may make a profit on a part of the five thousand dollars; and after I 
get the stock, if you can find someone who would like to buy it for 
twenty-five hundred dollars, I will be much obliged to you if you will 
come and get the stock." Years later, when he put hundreds of thou- 
sands of dollars into the sugar business, I don't know whether or not he 
felt to give credit to that humble man, Wilford Woodruff, for the inspira- 
tion of the Lord, whereby this great industry was established. 

But for the inspiration of the Lord to Wilford Woodruff I doubt if 
we would have any sugar business in this state or in Idaho, today, that 
would amount to very much. I am inclined to think that the Great West- 
ern or some other company would have established the business in Utah 
and Idaho, and that the people of these states would simply have been 
working for them instead of owning the majority of the stock in our 
great inter-mountain factories. 

After we had let the contract for the building of the sugar factory at 
Lehi, the panic of 1891 came on. There was a provision in the contract 
that before the machinery was shipped by the Dyer Company, if we would 
pay a forfeit of fifty thousand dollars the contract could be cancelled. I 
had been sent to New York, Chicago, Boston, Philadelphia. San Francisco 
and other places, by the Presidency, to try to raise the money necessary 
to build this factory, but it looked like an impossibility to get the money. 
It was the opinion of business men and others that we should pay the 
fifty thousand dollars forfeit and abandon the enterprise ; but when the 
recommendation was presented, Wilford Woodruff's answer was this: 
"From the day I received a knowledge of the divinity of the gospel of 
Jesus Christ revealed through the Prophet Joseph Smith, from the day 
that I went out as a humble priest to proclaim that gospel, although it 
looked like death in front of me, if the path of duty that the gospel 
required me to tread called me to face death, I have never 
turned to the right nor turned to the left ; and now the inspiration of the 
Lord to me is to build this factory. Every time I think of abandoning it, 
there is darkness ; and every time I think of building it, there is light. We 
will build the factory if it bursts the Church." 

We did built it and it did not burst the Church (laughter) ; and it 
and subsequent factories have made for our people and for the Church 
millions of dollars. 

PRESIDENT SNOW'S WORK OF THREE YEARS. 

I know that Lorenzo Snow was a Prophet of God. By his testi-

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



mony, which I have read to you, and by the testimony of my mother and 
hundreds of , others who knew the Prophet Joseph, as well as by the 
revelations of the Spirit of God to me, I know that Joseph Smith was a 
Prophet of God. I know of my own knowledge that Brigham Young, 
and John Taylor and Wilford Woodruff were Prophets of God. It is 
stated that men do not amount to much after they pass fifty, and that 
when they are sixty you ought to get some kind of a drug and put them 
to sleep, and that when they are seventy they are simply useless. But 
Lorenzo Snow came to the presidency of the Church when he was eighty- 
five years of age, and what he accomplished during the next three years 
of his life is simply marvelous to contemplate. He lifted the Church from 
the financial slough of despond, so to speak, from almost financial bank- 
ruptcy — when its credit was hardly good for a thousand dollars without 
security, when it was paying ten per cent for money — he lifted the Church 
out of that condition and made its credit A No. 1, so that people solicited 
and asked for the privilege of buying the bonds of this Church at six 
per cent. Ten per cent is sixty-six and two-thirds per cent more than 
six per cent, and in three short years this man, beyond the age of ability 
in the estimation of the world, this man who had not been engaged in fin- 
ancial affairs, who had been devoting his life for years to laboring in 
the Temple, took hold of the finances of the Church of Christ, under 
the inspiration of the living God, and in those three years changed every- 
thing, financially, from darkness to light. 

I know that Lorenzo Snow was God's mouthpiece upon the earth, 
that he was the representative of the Lord and that he was in very deed 
a Prophet of God. Read the wonderful testimony that he received a few 
weeks after his baptism, as recorded in the Improvement Era, concern- 
ing the knowledge that he received that God lived, that Jesus is the 
Christ, the Redeemer of the world, and that the priesthood of the living 
God has been restored to the earth. I know that that knowledge guided 
his life from that day to the day that he became God's representative upon 
the earth. 

THE COURAGE OF PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 

Lorenzo Snow was drowned in the harbor of Honolulu, in the 
Hawaiian Islands, and it took some hours to bring him to life again. At 
that particular time the Lord revealed to him the fact that the young 
man Joseph F. Smith, who had refused to get off the vessel that had 
carried them from San Francisco to Honolulu, and get into a small boat, 
would some day be the Prophet of God. Answering Lorenzo Snow who 
was in charge of the company, he said: "If you by the authority of the 
Priesthood of God, which you hold, tell me to get into that boat and at- 
tempt to land, I will do so, but unless you command me in the authority 
of the Priesthood, I wil not do so, because it is not safe to attempt to 
land in a small boat while this typhoon is raging." They laughed at the 
young man Joseph F. Smith, but he said, "The boat will capsize." The 
others got into the boat, and it did capsize ; and but for the blessings of 
the Lord in resuscitating Lorenzo Snow he would not have lived, because 
he was drowned upon that occasion. It was revealed to him, then and 
there, that the boy, with the courage of his convictions, with the iron

will to be laughed at and scorned as lacking courage ro go m mat. ooai, 
and who stayed on that vessel, would yet be the Prophet of God. Lorenzo 
Snow told me this upon more than one occasion, long years before Joseph 
F. Smith came to the presidency of the Church. 

EULOGY AND LETTER OF SYMPATHY IN MEMORY OF PRESIDENT 
JOSEPH F. SMITH. 

I said I wanted my counselors to say something, but I am afraid 
they are not going to have the chance. I now come to Joseph F. Smith. 
I apologize to his family for reading a personal letter of sympathy. 1 
had no idea as I sat down and picked up my pen and poured out my 
heart in love and sympathy to the family, that I would ever read in pub- 
lic that letter ; but I had failed to get my mind upon anything that I par- 
ticularly desired to say upon this occasion, and last night I borrowed 
from one of his sons a copy of the letter; and although it may not be 
good ethics, I wish to read it, because therein are the sentiments of my 
heart, poured out in love to his family. 

' At Home, November 20, 1918. 
To the family of President Joseph F. Smith, 

My dearly beloved friends: Language fails me to express to you my 
love for your dear departed father and husband. In dear Aunt Eliza 
R. Snow's words I can truthfully say, "He was beloved, beloved by all." 

For thirty-six years I have labored under his Presidency, while he 
was counselor to or the President of the Church. During all this time 
no man could possibly have inspired one over whom he presided with 
more love or confidence for him than President Smith did me. I have 
said many times that no man who ever lived, with whom I have been 
associated, had been beloved by me as much as your dear departed hus- 
band and father. 

I could not and did not in my heart bring myself to feel that he was 
going to leave us until the afternoon of the 18th, when I called and David 
said he wanted to see me. The President took my hand and pressed it 
with a power and strength that was far from what one could expect from 
a dying man, and he blessed me with power and the Spirit of the living 
God, and there was love in his eyes and a strong pressure of his hand, 
and with nearly every word he spoke his pressure of my hand thrilled my 
being, and tears of gratitude to God and love for His mouthpiece upon 
the earth filled my heart. His blessing was all that I could ask or ex- 
pect had he been my own dear father. . 

Sister Bowman entered and kissed and wept over her father, and I 
walked into the little front office and wept, feeling that the last words I 
would ever hear from his beloved lips had been spoken when he said to 
me, "The Lord bless you, my boy, the Lord bless you, you have a great 
responsibility. Always remember this is the Lord's work and not man's. 
The Lord is greater than any man. He knows whom He wants to lead 
His Church and never makes any mistakes. The Lord bless you." 

I 'returned to my office, but I did not even have the heart to mail 
some letters which I had written earlier in the day. I went home and 
after eating supper I again visited the President, whom I found in great

pain, and he asked President Lund who was there to bless him and sup- 
plicate the Lord to release him, and call him home. We placed our hands 
upon his head and President Lund told the Lord how much we loved our 
President and of our gratitude for the joy and happiness we had had in 
laboring with him, but asked that he be called home if his life could not 
be spared to us. 

The next morning I awoke at one o'clock and was not able to get to 
sleep until after six-thirty, as my mind was with the President. I got 
the November Era and reread the President's talk at the October confer- 
ence, and after doing so I wrote in my Era at the close of his talk: 

"Nov. 19/18. Re-read twice and wept as I think of how near death's door 
the President is. 

"It is 3:45 and I have been awake since one a. m." — Heber J .Grant. 
The President lived but one hour and five minutes after I had written 
that he was near death's door. 

The Lord has been very good to me in times of sorrow, and I hops, 
and pray with all my heart that He will bless and comfort your sorrowing 
hearts, as you read of his goodness to me. I am enclosing a copy of a 
letter telling of the blessings given to me in .times of affliction. There are 
two poems among those published with my letter to Brother and Sister 
Winters which have comforted and blessed me. "The Changed Cross," 
and "Providence is Over All."* Especially have I been blessed while read- 
ing Sister Woodmansee's inspiring words. I knew her from my earliest 
recollection until the day of her death, and my love of her poem was 
no doubt increased from the fact that she lived in perfect harmony with 
its teachings. 

I was once talking of the favorite poems of our Church leaders and 
I turned to President Smith and asked him which of our hymns was 
his favorite and he said he hardly knew, but he thought that perhaps 
his favorite was the splendid hymn, "Uphold the Right, Though Fierce 
the Fight,' by that heroic little soul, Sister Emily Hill Woodmansee."t 
I enclose a copy of this hymn with this letter. 

I have never known the joy and comfort of a father's love, but 
Presidents Joseph F. Smith, Francis M. Lyman, John Henry Smith, and 
others of my near and dear associates have given me a father's love and 
filled the place in my affections as completely as men not one's father 
could possibly do. 

Never in my life have I listened to more inspiring words than those 
at the funeral of my dear departed mother and at the funeral of my 
dear brother, Joseph Hyrum, which were spoken by President Smith. 

1 am thankful beyond any power to tell for the inspiration to do 
my full duty in the battle of life which has come to me from the example 
and loving teachings of your beloved father and husband. 

Flowers fade in a day, and so I shall send each of you for Gusta 
and myself in loving remembrance of your dear departed husband and 
father the book "Their Yesterdays." * * I send this book for the reason

that when I read it, March 20th, 1914, I marked one of the passages which 
seemed to me at the time I read the book to be inspirational. It is on 
pages 228-9. I wrote in my book the sentiments of my heart at the 
time regarding President Smith in connection with the words on those 
pages. What I wrote was as follows : "More than any man I have 
ever known, President Joseph F. Smith has done this. God bless him 
forever, and his posterity after him. The fact that he is the Prophet of 
•\ God today is a great testimony to me of the divinity of 'Mormonism' so 
called." 

Little did I think when I wrote these words that he would have de- 
parted this life by now. 

One of the most sincere and earnest prayers of my heart has been 
that President Smith should live to celebrate the one hundredth anniver- 
sary of the birth of the Church. I prayed for this some months ago at 
the close of a Temple fast meeting, and the Lord so abundantly blessed 
me that I felt my prayer would be answered, and I sat down weeping for 
joy. 

I could go on writing for hours, but I will close by sending my as- 
surance and that of Sister Grant of our profound sympathy, and our 
most earnest prayer for God to comfort and bless your sorrowing hearts. 
President Smith sealed us as husband and wife for time and all eternity, 
and Gusta shares in all the expressions of love for him and admiration of 
his character in this letter. Again, may God bless you and your loved 
ones now and forever. 

Your affectionate brother, 

(Signed) Heber J. Grant. 

At the grave of President Joseph F. Smith I read a poem entitled 
'"A Real Man"* and I expressed there the hope that I misrht live to be like 
Joseph F. Smith. I read at the grave the poem by Eliza R. Snow, written 
for the Prophet Joseph Smith. "He was beloved, beloved by all."t The 
prayer that I had in my heart, the desire that I had to follow in the foot- 
steps of this man of God, who presided over us with so much inspiration, 
with so much devotion, with so much integrity to God and to his fellow- 
men, the desire that I might be like him, is still in my heart. I pray God 
to bless his memory. I pray God to bless his wives and his children, that 
they may emulate his most wonderful and splendid example. I bear 
witness to you that from my early childhood days, when I could not 
thoroughly understand and comprehend the teachings of the gospel, that 
I have had my very being thrilled, and tears have rolled down my cheeks, 
under the inspiration of the living God, as I have listened to Toseuh F. 
Smith when preaching the gospel. I believe that Joseph F. Smith and 
his son Hyrum M. Smith, more than anv other men to whom I have lis- 
tened, who were born in the Church of Christ in our day, were the great- 
est preachers of righteousness. I know that whenever I heard that 
Joseph F. Smith was going to speak in one of the wards, that time and 
time again a.s a young man I have left my own ward and gone to listen

to him, because he always filled my being and lifted me up as I listened 
to him proclaim the gospel of Jesus Christ. I bear witness that he was 
one of the greatest prophets of God that has ever lived; that God was 
with him from the day that he went forth as a little boy of fifteen years 
of age, to proclaim the gospel of Jesus Christ in the Hawaiian Islands, 
until the day when, after giving sixty-five years of his life to the work 
of God, he closed his earthly career. 

May God bless each and all of us who have a knowledge of the di- 
vinity of the work in which we are engaged, and may we be faithful to 
the end as our prophet was, our beloved leader who has left us, Joseph 
F. Smith, is my prayer, and I ask it in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

PROVIDENCE IS OVER ALL. 

When dark and drear the skies appear, 

And doubt and dread would thee enthrall, 
Look up, nor fear, the day is near, 

And Providence is over all. 
From heaven above, His light and love, 

God. giveth freely when we call. 
Our utmost need is oft decreed, 

And Providence is over all. 

With jealous zeal God guards our weal, 

And lifts our wayward thoughts above; 
When storms assail life's bark so frail, 

We seek the haven of His love. 
And when our eyes transcend the skies 

His gracious purpose is complete, 
No more the night distracts our sight — 

The clouds are all beneath our feet. 

The direst woe that mortals know 

Can ne'er the honest heart appall 
Who holds the trust — that God is just, 

And Providence is over all. 
Should foes increase to mar our peace, 

Frustrated all their plans shall fall. 
Our utmost need is oft decreed, 

And Providence is over all. 

— Emily Hill Woodmansee. 

UPHOLD THE RIGHT 

Uphold the right, though fierce the fight, 

And powerful the foe. 
And freedom's friend, her cause defend, 

Nor fear nor favor show. 
No coward can be called a man, 

No friend will friends betray; 
•Who will be free, alert must be; 

Indifference will not pay. 

Note how they toil whose aim is spoil, . 

Who plundering plots devise; 
Yet time will teach that fools o'erreach 

The mark and lose the prize. 
Can justice deign to wrong maintain, 

Whoever wills it so? 
Can honor mate with treacherous hate? 

Can figs on thistles grow? 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT.

Dare to be true, and hopeful, too; 

Be watchful, brave and shrewd. 
Weigh every act; be wise, in fact, 

To serve the general good. 
Nor basely yield, nor quit the field — 

Important is the fray; 
Scorn to recede, there is no need 

To give our rights away. 

Left-handed fraud let those applaud 

Who would by fraud prevail: 
In freedom's name, contest their claim, 

Use no such word as fail; 
Honor we must each sacred trust, 

And rightful zeal display; 
Our part fulfill, then come what will, 

High heaven will clear the way. 

— Emily Hill Woodmansee. 

FROM "THEIR YESTERDAYS." 

'•'If the men of a race will perfect the manhood strength of the race; if 
they will exalt their manhood power; if they will fulfill the mission of life by 
perfecting and producing ever more perfect lives; if they will endeavor to con- 
tribute to the ages to come stronger, better, men than themselves; why, the 
work of the world will be done even as the plant produces its flowers and fruit, 
the work of the world will be done. In the exaltation of Life is the remedy 
for the evils that threaten the race. The reformations that men are always at- 
tempting in the social, religious, political, and industrial world are bu-t at- 
tempts to change the flavor or quality of the fruit when it is ripening on the 
tree. The true remedy lies in the life of the tree; in the soil from which it 
springs; in the source from which the fruit derives its quality and flavor. In 
the appreciation of Life, in the passion of Life, in the production of Life, in 
the perfection of Life, in the exaltation of Life, is the salvation of human kind. 
For this, and this alone, man has right to live — has right to his place and part 
in Life."— Harold Bell Wright. 

A REAL MAN. 

Men are of two kinds, and he 
Was of the kind I'd like to be. 
Some preach their virtues, and a few 
Express their lives by what they do. 
That sort was he. No flowery phrase 
Or glibly spoken words of praise 
Won friends for him. He wasn't cheap 
Or shallow, but his course ran deep, 
And it was pure. You know the kind. 
Not many in a life you find, 
Whose deeds outrun their words so far 
That more than what they seem they arc. 

There are two kinds of lies as well:- 

The kind you live, the ones you tell. 

Back through his years from age to youth 

He never acted one untruth. 

Out in the open light he fought 

And didn't care what others thought 

Nor what they said about his fight 

If he believed that he was right. 

The only deeds he ever hid 

Were acts of kindness that he did.

i What speech he had was plain and blunt. 
His was an unembellished front. 
Yet children loved him; babe and boy 
Played with the strength he could employ, 
Without one fear, and they are fleet 
To sense injustice and deceit. 
No back door gossio linked his name 
t With any shady tale of shame. 
He did not have to compromise 
With evil-doers, shrewd and wise, 
And let them ply their vicious trade 
Because of some past escapade. 

Men are of two kinds, and he 

Was of the kind I'd like to be. 

No door at which he ever knocked 

Against his manly form was locked; 

If ever man on earth was free 

And independent, it was he. 

No broken pledge lost him respect, 

He met all men with head erect; 

And when he passed I think there went 

A soul to yonder firmament 

So white, so splendid and so fine 

It came complete to God's design.

HYMN NO. 303. 

Thou dost not weep to weep alone; 

The broad bereavement seems to fall 
Unheeded and unfelt by none, 

He was beloved, beloved by all. 

But lo! what joy salutes our grief! 

Bright rainbows crown the tearful gloom, 
Hope, hope eternal, brings relief; 

Faith sounds a triumph o'er the tomb. 

It soothes our sorrow, says to thee, 
The Lord in chastening comes to bless: 

God is thy God, and He will be 
A father to the fatherless. 

'Tis well with the departed one; 

His heaven-lit lamp was shining bright, 
And when his mortal day went down, 

His spirit fled where reigns no night. 

'Tis meet to die as he has died, 

He smiled amid death's conquered gloom, 

While angels waited by his side, 
To bear a kindred spirit home. 

Vain are the trophies. wealth can give! 

His memory needs no sculptor's art; 
He's left a name — his virtues live, 

'Graved on the tablets of the heart. — Eliza R. Snow. 

The choir and congregation sang : 

"How firm a foundation, ye Saints of the Lord, 
Is laid for your faith in his excellent word."

PRESIDENT ANTHON H. LUND 

I rejoice this morning in seeing this great assemblage of Latter- 
day Saints and so many of the priesthood represented as are before me 
and around me here. What a marvelous work this is ! Seeing the vot- 
ing by quorums of the priesthood, I thought of the wonderful organiza- 
tion of the priesthood. 

god's marvelous work and a wonder. 

It brought to my mind the revelation given to the Prophet Joseph 
Smith, long before there was any one in the Church, in section four of 
the Doctrine and Covenants, in which the Lord said he was about to 
bring forth a marvelous and wonderful work. This has indeed been 
accomplished. The Prophet Joseph was indeed a man and prophet of 
God, and proved this both by his prophecies, by his teachings and by his 
life, and his successors followed him with great devotion to this great 
work. 

THE COURAGE OF BRIGHAM YOUNG. 

Today, the first of June, is the anniversary of the birth of Presi- 
dent Brigham Young. The Lord had a great work for him. He was 
indeed a Moses to lead his people away from persecution and oppression, 
into the wilderness. What sublime faith those men, the pioneers, showed 
in following him ! They did not know where they were going. They did 
not know what was before them, but they had confidence in their leader, 
and knowing he was appointed of God to lead them, they followed him. 

When they entered these valleys the prospect was not very encour- 
aging, and several of them thought it was better to go on to Oregon or 
California, or to places where there were already cultivated lands and an 
assurance that people were able to make a living. But their misgivings 
did not influence President Young, for he knew that this was the place ; 
he said so, and on the spot where the temple stands today, he said, "Here 
we will erect a temple to our God." President Brigham Young proved 
to be a courageous man. He was not afraid of the outlook. The Lord 
had pointed out to him that this would be the gathering place of the 
Saints. 

TRIBUTE TO PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 

We have heard President Grant speak about Brother John Taylor, 
about Brother Woodruff, and Brother Lorenzo Snow, and we have for 
some time looked forward to a day on which speeches should be made in 
memory of the prophet Joseph F. Smith. He was indeed loved by all. 
He was a great man. He was a great preacher of righteousness. How 
often have I sat listening to his voice and rejoiced in the truths that he 
put forth, the encouraging words he spoke* and the words of warning he 
gave unto the people! Take a view of his life. God had given him a 
strong and abiding faith. He never wavered. As early as fifteen years 
he was called to go to a land where much of the blood of Israel was

found. The four years he spent there were not years perhaps like many 
of us would have liked, but he looked upon them with joy and thank- 
fulness, for he loved the people among whom he labored. They loved 
him, and though they were poor and he was poor also, still those years 
were blessed years to him and to that people. 

President Smith was a dutiful child to his mother. He loved her 
with the greatest love. He often alluded to her and to the inestimable 
blessing that she had been to him. She taught him to read, she helped 
him in his studies, and her memory was ever kept by him in the deepest 
reverence. He liked to talk about her, and as he was a dutiful and lov- 
ing child himself, when he had children he was a loving father and a 
loving husband. He loved the little ones, even those not belonging 
to his family, and I have noticed how little children would be drawn to 
him even if they were perfect .strangers. There was an atmosphere 
about him that gave them confidence, so that they were not afraid to 
ccme and have him take them up in his arms. 

I have walked with him in the street and nearly every few steps 
he would meet acquaintances and have to stop and shake hands with 
them. He was loved by those who knew him. He never forgot his 
friends, even if he had not seen them for many years. His life was 
an exemplar)" one. 

Ever since I remember anything about him he was to me the type 
of a true Latter-day Saint ; and when I got more intimately connected 
with him I saw, every day, more and more evidence of his being just 
what I had imagined him to be. He was a true Latter-day Saint. He 
loved the gospel. He lover! to bear his testimony that Jesus was the 
Redeemer and Savior of the world. He bore testimony to the truth of 
the gospel, and to the divinity of the mission of Joseph Smith, and his 
testimony always strengthened the faith of those who listened to him. 

THE CHURCH FREED OF DEBT. 

President Smith was a good manager of the affairs of the Church. 
When his administration began, the Church was owing nearly a million 
dollars of bonds. President Smith was a man that did not like to be in 
debt, and as he felt in this regard himself, so he felt for the Church, and 
he put forth all his energy that the Church might get out of the bond- 
age of debt. It took about five years to do this, because so many other 
responsibilities had to be met, but I remember one day in the old office 
building how he rejoiced when we made a bon-fire of bonds that called 
for a million of dollars, for we felt, now is the Church free from debt. 

AN EPOCH OF CHURCH BUILDINGS. 

During the administration of President Smith there was an epoch 
of building meetinghouses and stake houses, ward tithing offices, acad- 
emies and temples. More has been done during these years in this re- 
gard than ever before, not only at home, but abroad ; meeting houses 
have been erected in the missions of the United States, England, Scan- 
dinavia, and on the islands of the sea, and the people rejoice in having 
places of their own where they can go and worship God. When we 



PRESIDENT ANTHON H. LUND. 



19 



travel here, at home, we are pleased to see these beautiful meetinghouses 
that have been erected, and very few have been built without help by the 
Trustee-in-Trust. And the work of building meetinghouses continues. 

A FAITH-PROMOTING PREACHER OF RIGHTEOUSNESS. 

President Smith was a spiritual-minded man, and he was well 
versed in all things pertaining to the priesthood, to temple work and to 
the different activities of the Church. Before I came into the presidency 
I have often gone to him and asked for his advice and counsel, and I 
always found it to be the very best that could be given ; and when I was 
called to be his counselor I felt indeed humble, and wondered how I could 
perform such an office to a man like him. During the seventeen years 
that we sat at the council table together, I admired the man more and 
more. I saw how true he was to his professions, how true he was to 
the interests of the Church, how true to his brethren and the Saints in 
general. 

When a case came before him to judge, he and his counselors 
would talk it over and give it their careful consideration until they came 
to the same conclusion. We felt indeed that he was a man of God, a man 
raised up to perform a wonderful work. We all miss Brother Joseph F. 
Smith. We loved him. We knew that he was a fearless man. When it 
came to anything pertaining to the Church, whatever he thought was 
for the best good of the work, he was not afraid to undertake it. In re- 
flecting upon his life, we see many things that are faith-promoting, and 
showing that the Lord's hand was with him, protecting him and giving 
him success in his labors. 

May the Lord bless his families and his children, that they may 
emulate the noble example that he has set them, and may we all, brethren 
and sisters, remember what he has done, may his memory remain green 
in bur minds, and may we carry out that which he worked for so earn- 
estly all his life. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT WILL KEEP HIS PLEDGES. 

President Grant has spoken to us this morning. He has told us 
what he intends to do, and I know he will carry it out, because he has 
always kept the pledges he has made; so I do not think that now, as 
president of the Church, he will go back upon such conduct. The Lord 
will bless him. There is a great work for him to do, to which the Lord 
has called him, and God will give him wisdom and strength to accom*. 
plish it and enable him to carry the great responsibility that the office im- 
poses upon him. 

May the Lord bless President Grant, that he may have joy in his 
labor, that his administration may be a prosperous one for the Latter- 
day Saints, I ask in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. 



The Tabernacle Choir sang: 
"Come Unto Me." 

The benediction was pronounced 



by Patriarch George L. Farrell, of 
the Cache Stake of Zion.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



OVERFLOW MEETING. 

An overflow meeting was held 
in the Assembly Hall, Sunday 
morning, June 1, 10:45 o'clock, pre- 
sided over by President Seymour B. 
Young, of the First Council of Sev- 
enty. 

The music was furnished by the 
Latter-day Saints University stu- 
dents choir, under the direction of 
B. Cecil Gates. 

The choir and' congregation sang : 
''How firm a foundation, ye Saints 

of the Lord, 
Is laid for your faith in his excel- 
lent word." 

Prayer was offered by Elder Levi 
Edgar Young of the First Council 
of Seventy. 

The choir sang: "I put my trust 
in thee." 

ELDER SEYMOUR B. YOUNG 

(Of the First Council of Seventy.) 

My brethren, sisters, friends, and 
strangers — We bid you all welcome 
here to our general conference. We 
hail this as. a very auspicious day 
for the renewal of the gatherings of 
our annual conference, which was 
postponed on account of conditions 
that were very unpropitious dur- 
ing the regularly appointed time, 
6th of April, last. 

This is the anniversary of the 
birthday of President Brigham 
Young, the great pioneer of this 
western country. Hence I consider 
this a very proper day for holding 
our deferred general annual confer- 
ence. In the large Tabernacle, we 
have just completed the grand cere- 
mony of sustaining by the votes of 
the presiding quorums of the priest- 
hood the general authorities of the 
Church. They were sustained by a 
rising vote of the quorums of the 
priesthood, separated and seated in 



different portions of the tabernacle ; 
then followed the sustaining vote of 
the entire congregation. 

It is suggested that we now give 
you the same privilege, of rising 
when you cast your vote sustaining 
the general authorities of the 
Church. This is the 89th annual 
conference of the Church. 

It is proposed that we sustain 
Heber J. Grant as Prophet, Seer 
and Revelator, and President of the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints. 

All arise, and all who favor this 
proposition will signify it by raising 
the right hand. (Unanimous vote.) 

The other general authorities of 
the Church were then presented and 
sustained in like manner, and as 
presented in the assembly at the 
Tabernacle. 

ELDER B. H. ROBERTS 

(Of the First Council of Seventy.) 

When the king of England dies, a 
herald is sent out to make the an- 
nouncement, which he does in this 
form : "The King is dead. Long 
live the King." No sooner is the an- 
nouncement made that the king is 
dead than it is followed by the other 
sentence, Long live the king. It is 
an announcement which means that 
though the king has just died, yet 
England has not been an instant 
without a ruler. In one breath the 
passing of one monarch is made 
known, and the all hail given to his 
immediate successor. That is the 
theory of the British constitution, 
that while kings may come and go, 
the British sovereign always is, and 
there is no lapse in succession to the 
throne. In some such way that is 
true of the Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints also. From the 
time it was organized by divine ap- 



ELDER B. H. ROBERTS.

pointment of God there has never 
been a moment when there has not 
been a President of the Church of 
Jesus Christ in the earth. And al- 
though presidents may come and go 
in the future, my faith is that there 
will never be a time when there is 
not an immediate successor in the 
presidency. The constitution of the 
Church makes this provision. 

The presiding authority in the 
Church consists of three high 
priests, who constitute the presi- 
dency of the high priesthood of the 
Church, and also the presidency of 
the Church. They are chosen, up- 
held and sustained by the priest- 
hood of the Church, and also by all 
the congregations of the Church, 
for all things must be done by com- 
mon consent in the Church, and no 
officer in the Church; from the pres- 
idency thereof down to the humblest 
branch president in the Church can 
hold his place and exercise the func- 
tion of his office otherwise than by 
the consent of the body of people 
over whom he is called to preside. 
There is none exempt from this 
constitutional regulation of the 
Church. It was so from the begin r 
ning; for although the Prophet Jo- 
seph Smith had received the keys 
of the holy priesthood, and God had 
communicated to him his mind and 
his will, yet when it came to the 
organization of the Church, and the 
time had arrived for him to exercise 
the authority which God had given 
him over others, he was informed 
that he must call the brethren and 
sisters together who had been bap- 
tized, and obtain their consent to 
organize the Church. This great 
question was submitted to that little 
band of people, the organization be- 
ing effected, of course, by six mem- 
bers in order to comply with the 
law of the State of New York re- 



specting religious organizations. 
The question was submitted to 
them, and they voted upon it, and 
they sustained Joseph Smith as the 
first elder and Oliver Cowdery as 
the second elder of the Church, and 
thus this Church by divine appoint- 
ment of officers and their being sus- 
tained by the membership of the 
Church, was brought into existence 
— this great institution now known 
as the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints. Today we are 
repeating the things that were done 
from the commencement, and are 
privileged to exercise the same 
right in saying who it is that we will 
accept from our hearts to be the 
general authorities of the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 

We stand at the point where one 
presidency leaves us, and another is 
inaugurated. I think it is fitting 
that we should not only have our 
minds drawn out towards the man 
who is taking on new responsibili- 
ties, viz., President Heber J. Grant, 
but that we should also remember 
in loving kindness the faithful la- 
bors of him who, so short a time 
ago, was the President, and very 
worthily the President of the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints, viz., President Joseph 
F. Smith. Those of us who were 
in close association with him and 
who knew him and worked with 
him, cannot, I think, look upon this 
inauguration of a new president 
without calling to mind the devo- 
tion, the fidelity, and the splendid 
administrative abilities of Joseph F. 
Smith, son of Hyrum Smith, the 
Patriarch of the Church, the second 
presiding Patriarch of the Church, 
succeeding the father of the 
Prophet Joseph, who was the first 
presiding Patriarch of the Church. 
This man Hyrum Smith was a man 



22 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. \ 



upon whom the Lord conferred very 
splendid and very great blessings, 
especially in regard to his posterity. 
Blessings and promises that had 
been previously pronounced upon 
the head of Oliver Cowdery were 
also gathered up and placed upon 
the head of Hyrum Smith and his 
posterity after him. And truly the 
blessing has been realized in the 
posterity of Hyrum Smith, for I 
think there is no other man in the 
Church from the beginning until 
now who has been more abundantly 
blessed in his posterity than has 
Hyrum Smith. He was blessed in 
his two sons, the late Patriarch John 
Smith, who for so many years was 
a prominent figure in our commu- 
nity, and known throughout the 
Church, many thousands of the 
Saints receiving patriarchal bless- 
ings under his hands. Hyrum 
Smith was likewise blessed, and 
splendidly blessed, in the person of 
his great son Joseph F. Smith, who 
for so many years devoted himself 
to the work of the ministry in the 
days of his youth, and finally was 
brought into the quorum of the 
Twelve Apostles, while yet a young 
man, which position he held for 
many years. At the inauguration of 
the administration of President 
John Taylor he became a counselor 
to President Taylor. He sustained 
the same position to President Wil- 
ford Woodruff, and then to Presi- 
dent Lorenzo Snow ; and finally he 
came to the presidency himself, and 
held that position for more than sev- 
enteen years. And under his admin- 
istration the Church was truly and 
greatly hlessed, [blessed not only 
by the wisdom that was manifest- 
ed in his counsels, but also blessed 
by the example of his righteous life. 
So that when he passed away he 
passed away in honor and much be- 



loved by the people. The blessing 
pronounced upon the head of Hy- 
rum Smith is not only manifested in 
the person of John Smith, the Pa- 
triarch, and President Joseph F. 
Smith, but from the loins of Presi- 
dent Smith there came forth men 
and women who were highly hon- 
ored in the community, and who 
have found place for ministry in the 
Church. Two of his sons have been 
brought into the apos'tolate of the 
Church, faithful men. One of them, 
Elder Hyrum M. Smith, as you of 
course recall, passing away about 
a year or more ago; but he left a 
name and a fame that is honored in 
Israel. I am glad to say that Presi- 
dent Smith is still honored by one of 
his sons being sustained this day as 
one of the Twelve Apostles. Presi- 
dent Smith, then, was honored in his 
life; and worthily represented the 
second Presiding Patriarch in the 
Church ; and this succession of 
righteous men in the family of Hy- 
rum Smith shows that the blessings 
of the Lord pronounced upon the 
heads of his servants are not mere 
words, but represent substance, rep- 
resent realities. So God has mag- 
nified this family in the Church, 
and has especially honored this 
branch of it as he promised to do in 
one of the revelations now extant 
in the Book of Doctrine and Cove- 
nants. 

My brethren and sisters, it would 
not be proper for me to occupy fur- 
ther of your time, but I just wanted 
to call your attention to these few 
things in relation to this day in re- 
gard to the incoming administra- 
tion by your legally taken votes, ac- 
cording to the constitution of the 
Church which God has established. 
Of course, however, Heber J. Grant 
has been the president in reality 
from the time that President Smith 



/. GOLDEN 

passed away, for when the first pre- 
siding quorum of the Church for 
any cause is disrupted and goes out 
of existence, the man holding the 
authority stands in the second 
quorum, of the Church, viz., the 
President of the quorum of the 
Twelve, and the authority to act is 
his until the Church can be assem- 
bled, as we are now assembled, and 
proceed with the organization as it 
has been done toda>. 

I congratulate the Church upon 
the noble men who have become 
God's representatives as the presi- 
dency of his Church in this dispen- 
sation. We this day inaugurate the 
seventh president of the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints; 
they represent a line of men who 
for simplicity of life and character, 
for greatness of soul, for bigness of 
faith, for fidelity to the trust which 
God and the Church imposed in 
them, stand unparalleled in the re- 
ligious history of the world. Thank 
God, not only for a prophet, but for 
all our prophets, the presidents of 
the Church, in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 

ELDER J. GOLDEN KIMBALL 

(Of the First Council of Seventy.) 

As stated, by President Seymour 
B. Young, it is desired that the 
First Council of the Seventy 
speak in memory of President 
Joseph F. Smith. I have known 
President Smith from my early 
youth, and have listened to his 
teachings, as an apostle and as the 
president of the Church during the 
greater part of my life. 

I remember, in the early .days of 
my youth, of " the people of this 
Church looking forward hopefully 
when the time should come that the 
■prophecy made by the servants of 
God would be fulfilled, viz: that 



KIMBALL. 23 

President Joseph F. Smith would 
become the President of the Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints. I can think of no man who 
has been president of the Church, 
who has had greater opportunities 
and advantages than he has had. 
President Smith was chosen and 
ordained an apostle in his youth. 
He was favored, as I remember it, 
by being sent on a mission to the 
Hawaiian Islands, when he was 15 
years old. He was hedged about 
and privileged in associating with 
great men, and his life and labors 
were in the service of the Lord, as 
a special witness and an apostle of 
Jesus Christ. President Smith was 
trained, instructed, and prepared 
for this great appointment as 
prophet, seer and revelator by the 
greatest men who ever lived, in my 
judgment, in the history of the 
world. 

I am proud of the fact that I am 
a natural born heir, and was given 
birth in this land of liberty and 
freedom. We are not .called upon 
to cry out, "All hail to the king." 
I thank God, I belong to a Church 
which is the Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints. It does not 
belong to President Joseph F. 
Smith, and he made no such claim, 
but it belongs to God the Father, 
and to his Son, Jesus Christ. There 
are no such things as earthly kings 
in Christ's Church. There never 
will be any king-men in Christ's 
Church. For when his disciples 
came to him, he tried to teach them 
the great lesson : whosoever will be 
greatest among you, let him be 
servant of all ; and when these same 
apostles asked the Savior, "Who is 
the greatest in the kingdom of 
heaven?" he called a little child to 
him and said : "Except ye be con- 
verted, and become as little chil- 



24 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



dren ye shall not enter into the 
kingdom of heaven." Joseph F. 
Smith was like that. He was a 
man of great integrity. Few men 
had greater integrity or greater 
faith. He loved God with all his 
heart, with all his soul, and with 
all his might and that is all a man 
can do. 

Time will not permit me to say 
more. I have always honored and 
respected and sustained President 
Joseph F. Smith, and I am glad of 
it. But I discovered, in the time 
that I have labored in the Church, 
that he was human just like the rest 
of us. I want to learn the lesson, 
Cursed be the men who trust in 
man. You want to learn that les- 
son, if you are to be tested and meet 
difficulties, and you will not stumble 
and lose the faith. I place my trust 
in God, the eternal Father, and it 
is my business to get a clear and 
true conception of God, and of 
Jesus Christ, ■ and to realize that 
these men whom we have sustained 
are servants of the people : they are 
servants of God, and we sustain 
them, and we uphold them. If 
there were no people, there would 
be no need of a Church, so that we 
all say — at least I do — God save 
the people. God bless you. Amen. 

ELDER RULON S. WELLS 

(Of the First Council of Seventy.) 

It is only natural that I should 
greatly love President Joseph F. 
Smith. I imbibed it from my father. 
He was very closely associated with 
my father, and my father with him 
in the ministry, in laboring in the 
house of the Lord and otherwise in 
the building up of the Church and 
kingdom of God on the earth. 
From my earliest, boyhood I have 
always loved Joseph F. Smith, and 



when his name was first presented 
no one voted more neartily than I 
did to sustain him as the prophet^ 
seer and revelator of the Church 
and the president of it in all the 
world. And throughout my life I 
have been more or less familiar 
with his labors and ministry. But 
I will not undertake, my brethren 
and sisters, in the few moments 
that are allotted to me to speak of 
his great work among the children 
of men, but I think more of those 
particular labors that have had a 
direct influence and bearing upon 
me and upon my life, for I can 
truly say that there is no man in 
the Church that has exerted a 
greater and more powerful influ- 
ence over me in my life than Joseph 
F. Smith. No man has so moved 
me from the bottom of my soul as 
he has done. Tears' have welled 
up in my eyes, and my heart has 
been filled with joy and with the 
testimony of the truth under the 
influence of the Spirit of the Lord 
as it has been manifest in this great 
man. I have listened to him when 
it seemed to me that God was 
speaking to me direct, and_tfie 
words he spoke sank so deeply in- 
to my heart that I have wondered 
why it was that all who heard him 
upon that occasion did not feel and 
know that the gospel is true, that 
they who heard it as it was pro- 
claimed by this great man and re- 
stored from heaven through the in- 
strumentality of his illustrious 
uncle, the Prophet Joseph Smith, 
were not thoroughly converted and 
convinced as to the truth of it. The 
occasion to which I now refer was 
a funeral service held in honor of 
a dearly loved sister of mine, Em- 
ma Wells, who died in the year, 
1877. He was the speaker upon that 
occasion. He spoke forth the words 



ELDER JOSEPH 

of eternal life. He explained the 
srospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. 
There were many there, kindred 
and friends and outsiders, non- 
members of the Church, a goodly 
number; and I marveled that any 
one could go from that service 
without being convinced in their 
souls that he was a servant of God, 
and that he spoke the truth as it 
had been revealed from heaven. It 
was the plan of life and salvation, 
the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ 
as it has been restored in its purity. 
Upon various occasions he has thus 
filled my soul with the testimony 
of the truth and has exerted a 
power and influence over me which 
I hope will always remain with me. 

When I think of the influence his 
ministry has had upon me and up- 
on my life, and then contemplate 
his extensive labors in this com- 
munity, I have wondered how many 
thousands have been thus filled with 
joy and with the testimony of the 
truth. And if it be true that when 
a man labors all his life and suc- 
ceeds in saving but one soul, great 
will be his ioy with that soul in the 
kingdom of our Father, then what 
must be in store for this great man 
as he goes back into the kingdom 
of his Father, having labored 
nearly all his life in the ministry 
and brought so many souls unto the 
knowledge of the truth. I praise 
God for having sent such a noble 
spirit into the world. . I thank him 
for his noble life, for his worthy 
example in this community. I 
thank the Lord for his labors 
among the people, for great good 
has been the results. I honor his 
memory today and ioin my breth- 
ren in tribute to this true servant 
of God for whom I have alwavs 
had unbounded love and admira- 
tion. May his children, who have 



W. McMURRIN. 25 

been so blessed and favored of the 
Lord in being born of such good- 
ly parents, continue to enjoy the 
blessings pronounced upon the 
posterity of their martyred ances- 
tor, Hyrum Smith, the Patriarch, 
is my prayer in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 

JOS. W. McMURRIN 

(Of the First Council of Seventy.) 

We have but one theme, my 
brethren and .sisters, to dwell upon 
this morning. We were instructed 
by President Heber J. Grant, when 
we were appointed to come to this 
meeting, to devote our time and 
the remarks that we made to the 
memory of President Joseph F. 
Smith. I don't know just how my 
fellow laborers feel in approaching 
a task of this character. I feel that 
it is impossible for me to say any- 
thing quite up to the standard of 
the man. 

Joseph F. Smith, (n my feelings, 
is one of the greatest men, if not 
the greatest man, with whom' T 
have ever been acquainted. I have 
never been in his presence without 
being impressed with the feeling 
that he was indeed a servant of the 
living God, and that he was a 
prophet of the Lord. Thirty-eight 
years ago, when I was laboring as 
a boy missionary afar off, a brother 
related to me the prophecy that has 
been referred to by Elder J. Gold- 
en Kimball, that was delivered in 
the Ogden tabernacle forty or 
fifty years ago. I do not know just 
how long ago. President Wood- 
ruff declared in that prophecy that 
the time would come when Joseph 
F. Smith would stand as the 
mouthpiece of God. In making the 
declaration he invited the fathers 
and mothers in the congregation to 



26 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



write down the prediction, that 
their childen after the parents pres- 
ent were dead and gone, might 
read and know that God had 
spoken in relation to the future 
life of Joseph F. Smith. We are 
all witnesses to the fulfilment of 
the inspired prophecy. While lis- 
tening to what has been said in this 
meeting, I have been impressed 
in much the same way as my 
brother, Elder Rulon S. Wells, has 
just stated. I have often felt, 
when listening to words spoken by 
President Joseph F. Smith, that 
the very word of God was being 
declared, and that the inspiration 
and power of the Holy Ghost was 
resting upon the mouthpiece of 
God in a most remarkable and un- 
usual manner. 

I had the very great pleasure, 
just about two years ago, of being 
one of a party invited by Presi- 
dent Joseph F. Smith to make a 
journey to St. George. The 
brethren and sisters forming the 
party visited one line of settlements 
in going to St. George, and another 
line of settlements in returning to 
Salt Lake City. President Joseph 
F. Smith spoke in all of the meet- 
ings that were held, both going and 
returning, and notwithstanding 
the fact that he was under bodily 
ailment at the time, the spirit of 
his great calling rested upon him 
most marvelously, and he ex- 
pounded the doctrines of the ever- 
lasting srospel in very great clear- 
ness. The hearts of thousands of 
people were made glad through his 
inspired teachings and testimony. 

I always felt in his presence that 
I was indeed in the presence of 
God's anointed servant, and always 
rejoiced in knowing that he was a 
man filled with prophetic power ; 
and, above all else, that he was a 



man who had consecrated to the » 
very uttermost his time, and tal- 
ents, to the upbuilding of the king- 
dom of God. 

I believe that President Joseph 
F. Smith was just as true to the 
work of God, just as true to the 
Prophet Joseph Smith, just as true 
to his brethren in the holy priest- 
hood as any man who' ever lived. 
I believe that President Joseph F. 
Smith accepted the wonderful mis- 
sion of the Lord Jesus Christ, and 
understood that he was to be saved 
through the atoning blood of the 
Redeemer of the world by obe_- 
dience to the doctrines of the gos- 
pel, just as fully and completely 
as any man that ever lived. Presi- 
dent Joseph F. Smith, in my judg- 
ment, gave his time, and his 
thought, and his ability in the most . 
unselfish manner for the benefit 
and blessing of the Latter-day 
Saints, and for the advancement 
of the work of God. I thank God 
that it was my privilege occasion- 
ally to be in his presence. I am 
grateful for the words of blessing 
that he has spoken to me individ- 
ually. I thank the Lord for the 
impressions that have been made 
upon me by his splendid life. I 
believe those impressions are of an 
indelible character, and that they 
will be beneficial to me, and be a 
blessing to me as long as I live in 
mortality. 

I also thank God for the splendid 
family of President Joseph F. 
Smith. IJhave been very happy in 
my association with some of his 
boys, and know them to be true 
men. I am not closely acquainted 
with all of his sons. I believe, 
from what I know of them that 
they are all true men ; I have had 
close companionship with Hyrum 
M. Smith, with Joseph Fielding 



ELDER CHARLES H. HART. 



27 



Smith, with David A. Smith, with 
E. Wesley Smith. I am proud of 
their acquaintance. There are no 
better men in my judgment to be 
found among the people of the 
Latter-day Saints. 

God bless the family of our late 
President, and may the truth of the 
gospel of Jesus Christ, that was 
always the greatest thing in the 
thought of President Smith, be the 
greatest thing in the affections of 
his sons and daughters, and their 
children, and their generations af- 
ter them for ever and ever. 

My brethren and sisters, let us 
all be faithful. By good lives we 
can all honor our fathers. We have 
all had godly fathers, fathers that 
have been true to the work of God 
and to the great founders chosen 
to introduce it, they have ever been 
willing to lay down their lives if 
need be for the work revealed in 
this dispensation , I hope that not 
only the family of our great presi- 
dent will honor forever the name 
of their distinguished sire, but that 
we will all honor our good fath- 
ers, and our good mothers, and that 
we may all recognize and be sure 
of the fact that we are also en- 
listed in the cause of Christ, and 
that we will give to the full, alle- 
giance to the Master. 

We are all called to be expound- 
ers of the faith of the gospel that 
made the men who have been our 
leaders as great and noble as they 
were. It was the gospel of the 
Lord Jesus Christ, and living close- 
ly to the principles of that gospel, 
and consecrating their time and 
service to the advancement of the 
work of God, that made them ail 
mighty. God help every one of us 
to be true and steadfast to the 
same faith, that we also, when we 
have finished the race we are run 



ning, may have companionship 
with the great leader of .Israel 
whose memory we honor this day. 
I pray the blessings of God upon 
every one in this congregation, in 
the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER CHARLES H. HART 

(Of the First Council of Seventy). 

It is fitting and proper that this 
special conference should be con- 
vened on the 1st day of June, the 
89th anniversary of the holding of 
the first conference ever held by 
this Church. 

Of course, none of you will un- 
derstand that Brother Roberts, in 
using the beautiful and appropriate 
illustration that he did in the open- 
ing of his remarks, meant to up- 
hold kingcraft, because, as most of 
you know, Brother Roberts has just 
spent many months at the front, 
willing to go "over the top," in the 
contest of democracy against autoc- 
racy ; but he meant to point out that 
the Church could say, as Tennyson 
has his brook say, that "Men may 
come and men may go, but I go on 
forever." And it is a very appro- 
priate thing that as men go and 
men come in these leading po- 
sitions that we should pause briefly 
to pay a just tribute to the memory 
of those who have gone. 

I feel it a great honor to say a 
few words in commemoration of 
that great character, Joseph F. 
Smith, |the greatest preacher of 
righteousness, in my opinion, of 
this dispensation. I have been with 
his son Hyrum very much, and I 
think it is appropriate, in view of 
his recent demise, to mention his 
name. I have heard him deliver 
more than fifty sermons in succes- 
sion, and after each of which I 
could say "that indeed is worthy of

an apostle of our Lord and Savior." 
And yet the training of his father 
was such that I always placed his 
father first as a great preacher of 
righteousness. 

I may be pardoned if I relate a 
personal incident which will illus- 
trate the effect of his preaching and 
his spirit upon myself. Under pe- 
culiar circumstances, I came into a 
meeting at Logan at which he 
spoke and at which he presided. I 
had taken a long trip by team 
through the mountains and held 
many meetings. It had taken, me 
through the mountains from Cache 
county to Rich county, from thence 
to Bear Lake county, and from 
thence to Wyoming and back to 
Gem Valley, as they call it now, and 
through Oneida county. We had 
held many meetings, and it was cold 
and there was much loss of sleep 
and much fatigue, so that when I 
came into that meeting I was thor- 
oughly exhausted both in body and 
mind, and it was only by force of 
circumstances that I was induced to 
go into his company and the com- 
pany of the Saints. But under the 
inspiration of his speaking as the 
Spirit of God seemed to flow from 
him to his audience and back again 
to him, the result upon me was such 
that at the close of the meeting I 
was as free from fatigue and weari- 
ness as I ever was in my life. I 
paid special attention to my condiv 
tion, and could not detect the slight- 
est weariness either in body or in 
mind. A veteran newspaper re- 
porter who was in attendance to 
report the speaking, became so ab- 
sorbed that he failed to take any 
notes of the inspired talk of Presi- 
dent Smith. 

I think that the Prophet Joseph 
F. Smith, had more elements of 
greatness in him than any other 



man that it has been my privilege 
to know. He was great in a larger 
number of ways than any other 
man I ever knew. He was great 
in courage, and stern in righteous- 
ness, and yet there was a rare com- 
bination of kindness, meekness and 
gentleness. He was as kind and 
loving as a child. In fact it could 
be said of him that he had "the 
heart of childhood taken up and 
matured in the power of manhood." 
No man would have met death 
more willingly, in my judgment, for 
his convictions. He was a man 
great in his fidelity to his people 
and to the truth, and great in his 
testimony of the prophetic calling 
of the Prophet Joseph and of the 
divine mission of our Lord and 
Savior Jesus Christ. He had ele- 
ments of strength so combined that 
he was indeed a truly great man; 
the favor of God was upon him. I 
think he exemplified more than any 
"other man I ever knew the fulfil- 
ment of the scriptural injunction 
and promise to "seek first the king- 
dom of God and His righteous- 
ness," and all other things should 
be added thereto. 

Here are some lines that I think 
of, in connection with the life and 
character and ministry of our late 
lamented Prophet: 

"He was one who never turned his 
back, 

But marched breast forward; 
Never doubted clouds would break; 
Never dreamed, though right were 
worsted, 

Wrong would triumph. 
He held, we fall to rise, are baffled 

To fight better, sleep to wake." 

He was such a man as Holland 
describes or asks for when he ex- 
claims : 

"God give us men. The time demands 
Strong minds, great hearts, true faith 
and willing hands; 



ELDER LEVI EDGAR YOUNG.

Men whom the lust of office does 
not kill; 

Men whom the spoils of office can- 
not buy; 

Men who possess opinions and a will; 
Men who have honor; men who will 
not lie, 

Men who can stand before a dema- 
gogue 

And damn his treacherous flatteries 

without winking; 
Tall men, sun crowned, who live 

above the fog 
In public duty and private thinking!" 

I pray the Lord to bless the mem- 
ory of President Joseph F. Smith 
and his posterity. His works will 
live after him. He has left an im- 
pression upon the Church that will 
be enduring. I had the deepest love 
and the greatest admiration for him 
during his life, and I regret that I 
did not let him know at least a frac- 
tional part of the love and admira- 
tion I had for him and his ministry 
and the things he accomplished. 
May the Lord bless his memory 
and bless us that we may follow the 
good example he set for us, I pray 
in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER LEVI EDGAR YOUNG 

(Of the First Council of Seventy). 

I bear you my testimony, my 
brethren and sisters, that all that 
has been said this day in reference 
to the character of President Joseph 
F. Smith is quite true. 

I look upon a man as great when 
he stands for great principles ; and 
that is the standard by which we 
should judge people. When people 
stand for principle, and know by 
their faith in God that the principle 
is true, it is always a mark of true 
greatness ; and when a man links up 
his life with God, becomes one with 
God, and he and God are friends, 
you may depend upon it you, have 
the truest standard of greatness that 
can be possibly created. 



The glorious thing to me in the 
life of President Joseph F. Smith 
was not only his wonderful strength 
of character, his true conception of 
life, .his splendid idealism of re- 
ligion and his great faith in God ; 
but his living the divine injunction 
"unless ye can become as a little 
child ye cannot enter the kingdom 
of heaven." He was great in his 
power to understand life and to see 
God. His faith was one of the most 
sublime things I ever knew. He 
never compromised with wrong or 
with evil in any form. Man to him 
is free, but free to do right, not free 
to do wrong. I remember a state- 
ment that he once made concerning 
the meaning of liberty which I shall 
never forget. Said he: "Liberty is 
obedience to just law." That to me 
is one of the most wonderful ideas 
concerning liberty and American- 
ism that I have ever heard. Obe- 
dience to law is liberty. What kind 
of law? Law that is founded, on 
truth. Law that is an expression of 
God's will to his people. Therefore, 
he was very democratic. He was 
very loving of his fellow man. How 
true it was that he showed his love 
for God' because he loved his fellow 
men so much. He feared no man. 
He loved his God, and with his 
great linking of truth with God's 
truth, he lived a truly inspiring life. 
Standing upon the principle of right 
living, he truly entered the kingdom 
of heaven. "Unless ye become as a 
little child, ye cannot know God." 
To me he was very great, very cour- 
ageous, very brave, very true, and 
above all, he was the child of God. 
He looked up, and with sublime 
faith made his life divine. 

May we see the beauty of his- life, 
the truth of his words, the greatness 
of his soul, the magnanimity of his 
spirit, his great relationship to God. 
Amen.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



PREST. SEYMOUR B. YOUNG 

(Of the First Council of Seventy.) 

I want to thank Brother B. 
Cecil Gates and those who have been 
with him in giving us good 'music 
today. 

I also want to speak in regard to 
President Joseph F. Smith, as this 
day has been chosen. 

At the funeral of his son, Hyrum 
M. Smith, just as the family were 
taking leave of the remains in the 
Beehive house, I entered the house 
that morning, and while standing a 
little way from the bier of our be- 
loved apostle, there came from an- 
other room President Joseph F. 
Smith, the father of the beloved 
deceased. He saw me and came di- 
rectly to me, and putting his arms 
around me drew me to his bosom, 
and we kissed and embraced each 
other. And he said, "Seymour, we 
have been boys tcgether." And 
when we thus embraced I found that 
we were both weeping. President 
Joseph F. Smith has been indeed 
a remarkable man. He has main- 
tained the love of his people from 
the beginning of his ministry to the 
end of his life. I don ; t believe that 
he had an enemy in the world, or 
an enemy that could give any rea- 
son for his enmity ; because all men 
saw in Joseph F. Smith, our re- 



cent president, a man who stood 
high in the estimation of humanity, 
and of God our eternal Father. 

President Heber J. Grant has now 
been sustained by the congrega- 
tions of the Saints, and by the 
special quorums of the priesthood, 
and I beseech for him that love, 
reverence, and sustaining power 
that he so well deserves and has so 
well merited through his life of de- 
votion and faithful labors all the 
days of his life. For I have known 
him since the days of Nauvoo, and 
I say that I have never known bet- 
ter and truer men, than President 
Joseph F. Smith and President 
Heber J. Grant. We are all glad 
today that so noble a man has been 
chosen by the people and sanctioned 
by the voice of our heavenly Father 
to be the President of the Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints. May the Lord add his 
blessings to you fathers and moth- 
ers, boys and girls, friends and 
strangers, who are here attending 
our general conference, I pray in 
the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

"We thank thee, O God for a 
prophet," was sung by the choir and 
congregation. 

Elder Jonathan Golden Kimball 
offered the benediction. 



AFTERNOON SESSION. 



President Heber J. Grant, pre- 
sided in the Tabernacle, and called 
the congregation to order at 2 
o'clock. 

The Choir and congregation 
sang: "Guide us, O thou great Je- 
hovah." 



Prayer was offered by Elder 
Moses Taylor, president of the 
Summit stake of Zion. 

The choir sang: "Hope thou in 

God," ,solo by Edna Gothberg. 



PRESIDENT CHARLES W. PENROSE. 31 

PRES. CHARLES W. PENROSE 

This is a splendid sight, especially to us who sit here on this plat- 
form, but the spectacle presented by our congregation this morning, if 
anything, was still grander because of the order of the seating and the 
kind of persons assembled, particularly on the lower floor of this build- 
ing. 

THE SOLEMN ASSEMBLY. 

It was a unique congregation, what we call in this Church a "solemn 
assembly" of the holy priesthood, the several authorities of the Church 
being arranged to sit in their proper places, according to their relationship 
to each other, in this splendid organization which the Lord has estab- 
lished on the earth, and of the spirit and power attending the congrega- 
tion, and especially the speakers. No such a scene as that we beheld this 
morning could be seen in any of the congregations of the various churches 
in the world, Christian, or heathen, or pagan. 

It is something peculiar to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints, and this order of priesthood, as exhibited here this morn- 
ing in our meeting, is not of man's formation. It is divine and bears the 
stamp of divinity upon it in its order and in the relationship that exists 
between these different bodies of the priesthood, all animated by one 
spirit. Truly we can say, as the apostles of old said : We have one Lord, 
and one faith and one baptism," and one hope of our calling. "And God 
hath set in the Church first apostles, secondly prophets, after that helps 
and governments, and miracles and signs and gifts and blessings and the 
various authorities, all for the work of the ministry, for the perfecting of 
the Saints, and for the edifying of the body of Christ, until we all come 
in unity of the faith to the knowledge of the Son of God," that we may 
"grow up unto him who is our living head" in all things. I thank God 
with all my soul today for this glorious privilege of being present and of 
being associated with the body of men .who by uplifted hand recognized 
the authorities of the Church and voted, without a dissenting sign or 
manifestation of any kind, to sustain them, being of one heart and one 
mind and led by one spirit. This is not the first occasion of the kind in 
which I have participated. 

LEADERS OF THE LATTER-DAY DISPENSATION. 

We had a splendid discourse from President Grant in relation to the 
successive presidents that we have had from the beginning of the Church, 
from the Prophet Joseph Smith down to the present time. I did. not have 
the joy and pleasure of being personally acquainted with the Prophet 
Joseph Smith, but felt familiar with him because of my association with 
so many with whom he was acquainted, and who received the priesthood 
of God under his ordination — under his hands, and also by reading his 
discourses, accounts of his life and works, and receiving by the power of 
God a testimony of the fact that he was divinely called to usher in the 
last dispensation, the dispensation of the fulness of times, in the which 
as the Lord revealed anciently, he would "gather together in one all 



32 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



things that are in him, both in the heavens and in the earth," and this is 
that dispensation. And I received when I was a boy, when I first em- 
braced the gospel, a testimony by the power and gift of the Holy Ghost, 
and by many signs and tokens and manifestations to me, personally, a 
knowledge of this great fact — that God has opened the heavens in the 
latter times and once more communicated with man, and that Jesus, who 
is the Christ, his beloved Son, also has been engaged in this work under 
his direction, and this Church, which bears his name, is indeed the Church 
of Christ, composed of Latter-day Saints instead of former-day Saints. ' 
This testimony was given to me, as I have stated, through my obedience 
to the gospel in an early day, and since that time, I thank the Lord I 
have had the opportunity of laboring in this great cause, the greatest 
thing on the earth, a divine Church, set up not only by divine authority 
but by divine persons and the actual participation in and direction of 
Jesus of Nazareth, who is the Christ, the Son of the living God and the 
Savior of the world. 

I was present when President John Taylor succeeded to the presi- 
dency of the Church, after the death of President Brigham Young. I 
was well acquainted with him, but I was not in Nauvoo when the mantle 
of the prophet Joseph fell upon him, as we have heard testified of many 
times ; but I became acquainted with brother Brigham until we became 
very familiar, and I had great joy in knowing that he loved me as well as 
that I loved him, that we often had an opportunity of holding converse 
and that he understood me as well as I, measureably at least, understood 
him, and I know that he was the proper successor and inheritor to the 
authority that was placed upon the Prophet Joseph, that he was the 
rightful president of this Church, and that he conducted this Church under 
the inspiration of the Almighty. And the great works he accomplished 
are seen, many of them, in the building up of this State now in the Ameri- 
can Union. But when Brother John Taylor succeeded to the presidency 
I was present, when that splendid assembly, the kind of which we had 
this morning, was established here, and took part in it, and so when his 
successor was appointed. I was here present when President Wilford 
Woodruff was called to be the President of the Church and also Lorenzo 
Snow and Joseph F. Smith, our beloved apostle and prophet and presi- 
dent who has recently passed away, and I am thankful in my soul today 
that I am privileged to be here and take part in the installation of Presi- 
dent Heber J. Grant as prophet, seer and revelator, and President of the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, his authority extending 
through all the world. And with all my heart I joined with the brethren 
this morning in lifting up my right hand in token to the heavens that 
I accepted these men in their several callings as servants of the Most 
High, holding the authority of the holy priesthood, which is after the 
order of the Son of God. 

MEN CAN DO LITTLE OF THEMSELVES. 

I feel as if I could not attempt to add much to the eulogies pro- 
nounced upon these great men whose names have been mentioned to 
us. President Brigham Young, I regarded as one of the most remark- 



PRESIDENT CHARLES W. PENROSE. 



33 



able men of his time. I was going to say, apart from his calling as the 
prophet of the Lord, but I do not know that he would have made any 
great mark in the world but for this calling. For I realize fully the 
truth of the revelation of God through the Prophet Joseph that the powers 
of this priesthood, represented here this morning, are "inseparably con- 
nected with the powers behind the veil," that alone we are not very 
mighty ; that of ourselves we can do very little ; but with those heavenly 
powers associated with us and we with them, great things have been ac- 
complished and still greater are in progress and will be accomplished. 
For this is the work of the Lord and it is established in the earth for a 
direct and divine purpose, and will be accomplished although the means 
by which it is and will be accomplished may be of themselves not very 
great or mighty, but the powers behind the veil are with us, not only those 
great men who performed so wonderful a work before President Grant's 
coming into the presidency, are with the Lord behind the veil, not only 
they are with us and thousands of the departed ones who have worked 
in the ministry, but all the great and the mighty of the ages past are with 
us, powers of the holy priesthood, held by men of God from the beginning 
are with us, and in that and the oversight and direction of the Lord 
Jesus Christ as our living head, we can and will prevail over darkness and 
error and wickedness and corruption and disorder and confusion, and in 
the place thereof through this agency will come order and peace and con- 
cord and brotherly love and the union and power of mankind when 
united together by the Holy Spirit from on high. This is being poured 
out upon those who will obey the principles of the gospel, and the fruits 
thereof are already being made manifest in the earth, and the time will 
come when all the predictions of the prophets of oldj concerning the es- 
tablishment of the reign of peace will be fulfilled, but it will come through 
righteousness, and righteousness through the preaching of the truth, the 
word of God, by the power of God, in the authority of God. 

CONCERNING PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 

I had the pleasure of laboring under the direction of those great 
men who were talked about this morning, President Taylor, President 
Woodruff, President Lorenzo Snow, and President Joseph F. Smith. 
When we had finished our voting we sang the song: "How firm a 'founda- 
tion, ye Saints of the Lord, is laid for your faith in his excellent word. 
What more can he say than to you He hath said?" I thought, when 
President Grant sat down, if I was called upon to speak, as he announced 
that his counselors would have something to say, and after Brother 
Lund had finished his excellent remarks, what more could I say than to 
you these have said. I felt very much as a witness did, when called into 
court to give testimony on a certain case, and had been preceded by a 
man who told what he knew and who said : "Your Honor, I says as he 
says," and that was all he couH tell. I was very much in the same con- 
dition, but I know that would not suffice, so here this afternoon I take 
pride and pleasure in adding my testimony to the remarks made -here 
this morning concerning each one of the presidents of the Church of 



34 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, from the time of the Prophet Joseph 
down to the decease of our beloved Brother Joseph F. Smith. I loved 
him with all my heart, and I am always glad to know that he loved me. 

From the first time we met, we felt as though we were kindred spirits. 
The first time I met him was about 59 years ago, in Liverpool, and when 
we struck hands and were introduced to each other our hearts went with 
our hands, and we have always loved each other from that time to the 
time that he departed ; my love remains and abides in my heart, and I 
am proud of having been associated with him in the ministry. It was 
through him, that I was called to the apostleship, and ordained under his 
hands, and also afterwards to be one of his counselors in the First Presi- 
dency. In this, I had opportunities of knowing the kind of a man he was 
and is. He was one of the grand men of the age. He was great in all 
things he undertook. He had failings, no doubt, like others had, but 
they were not very manifest. He was a great man in the ministry. He 
was, indeed, as was pronounced upon his head this morning, a preacher 
of righteousness and he was a liver of righteousness. He was exemplary 
in all his ways, in public and in private, and he had a kind heart as well 
as a strong mind. In all things that came under his notice and his direc- 
tion he was strong and mighty, not only spiritually, but in what we call 
temporal things his judgment was splendid. He was accurate. He was 
awake and alive to his duties. He loved to perform them faithfully and 
he did so. I am sure that his labors were acceptable unto God, and when 
"the books are opened and men are judged out of the things written in 
the books, according to their works," he will stand in the front rank, and 
he will shine in the fulness of the celestial glory, with the sons of God 
who minister before the Most High. 

God bless his family, those whom he has left to follow in his foot- 
steps. He had a splendid family, men and women that ought to be hon- 
ored, and will be in Israel all their days and throughout all their genera- 
tions. They will be prospered in all things ; the Lord will be with them, 
and the influence of the great man who stands as a patriarch at their 
head will be upon them. 

THE MANTLE OF JOSEPH RESTING UPON HEBER. 

I believe in the influence of those who hold the priesthood behind, 
the veil. The testimony given concerning the falling of the mantle of 
Joseph the prophet upon Brigham Young, when he became the leader 
of the Church, has been repeated in these times, and quite recently con- 
cerning our late president and the president who has been elected, ap- 
pointed and sustained today, and I believe that the prophet Joseph will be 
near to Heber J. Grant when necessary — Joseph F. Smith, I mean. And 
so in regard to his family. I am satisfied in my own mind, and by my 
own experience, that the powers on high are with the powers on the earth. 
Men holding the Holy Priesthood, who have ministered in the flesh and 
have gone into the world of spirits, and are laboring there in the same 
great cause as that in -which we are engaged in the flesh, help the breth- 
ren in their times of need, and are with them, and stand by them in times 



PRESIDENT CHARLES W. PENROSE. 



35 



that try men's souls. I am assured of this, I say, in my own experience; 
and this is the power by which we shall prevail over the things of the 
world. The time will come when the priesthood behind the veil will 
minister personally in the temples of God to men holding the priesthood 
in the flesh, revealing matters that are needful to be known concerning 
the departed that the work being performed for the dead, as well as for 
the living may go on and be accomplished and perfected properly, and 
that we may grow up together in Jesus the Christ, who is our living head. 

SOME THINGS THAT PRESIDENT SMITH WOULD SAY. 

Now, my brethren and sisters, there are two or three things that I 
think President Joseph F. Smith would talk about, if he were present 
with us today. One is that great truth concerning Jesus of Nazareth. 
During the later years of his life, President Smith took great pleasure and 
joy in bearing his testimony to his certainty of knowledge that Jesus is 
and was the Christ, that he died for mankind, that through him and by 
him the worlds were made, under the direction of the great Eternal 
Father, and that he came on the earth in the meridian of time, and laid 
down his life, voluntarily, for the sins of mankind, that through faith and 
repentance and baptism, and obedience to all the ordinances of the house 
of the Lord, men might be raised from the dead and saved and become per- 
fected in the celestial glory, to inherit the fulness of the blessings 
pertaining to eternal lives; and that through him and by him all the dead, 
small and great, will come forth from their tombs and stand upon their 
feet and be judged according to their works, the good, bad or indifferent, 
of all races and countries and climes, for he is the Redeemer of the 
world ; and "as in Adam all die," so in Christ shall all be raised from the 
dead. This was one of the themes on which he dwelt before he departed 
from us, and especially in later years. 

THE CHURCH OF CHRIST THE ONLY CHURCH. 

Another truth is that this Church, to which we belong, is the only 
Church of Christ on the earth. This is not saying anything against the 
views or opinions of our friends and neighbors, or people afar off, who 
differ from us in our views, not at all. We are quite willing that they 
shall go their way, particularly if they will allow us to go ours. Some- 
times they have tried to prevent us, but they have not accomplished very 
much in their efforts, no matter what they have done, but this work has 
gone on in spite of opposition as it will go on until everything beneath 
the eternal heavens is subdued unto the Father, and the Son, and the 
Holy Ghost, and divinity shall reign on the earth instead of mortality 
and wickedness and corruption. 

This Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has a special mission 
in the world and that mission has come from on high, not from the minds 
of men, not from the reading of books, not inherited from old creeds, but 
it is the gospel of Jesus Christ, restored to earth in its fulness, in its 
purity, in its power, in its authority and' its unity with the heavens ; and it 



36 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



will prevail. All the different sects and organizations in Christendom 
and the others that are in heathendom suit pretty well the people who 
adhere to them. AW right. Let them stay by them, if they think they 
are good enough ; but they are not good enough for Latter-day Saints. 
We want the truth as it is on high, and as it is revealed from on high 
to the servants of God on the earth.; and this organization to which we 
belong is peculiar to itself. 

NO NEED FOR OUTSIDE ORDERS. 

That introduces another point that I am -sure President Joseph F. 
Smith, if he were here, would touch upon at this conference, and it is 
this : That when we are in this Church and members of it, we belong to 
the body of Christ, and there is no need for us to go outside of it for 
anything in the world, particularly of a religious character. We have 
no need to dabble in -the things of the world ; we have no need to join 
other organizations that are antagonistic to or out of harmony with this 
Church. Here is something for the Latter-day Saints to consider at 
this conference. There is nothing new in what I am saying, but it needs 
to be impressed upon the minds of our people in every part of the Church, 
and these men who hold the holy priesthood who have lifted up their hands 
today to sustain the authorities of this Church should carry with them, 
when they go home, this spirit and this determination as advice for our 
people. We will serve the Lord! Let the dying world go to its grave 
if it will. Let the wicked that are being bound in bundles go to the 
burning if they do not repent, but as for us, We, with all we are and with 
all we have, should be in this Church in body and in spirit, in every 
capacity, and there should be no need and no desire on our part to go out- 
side of the strait and narrow way, the only way which leads to the 
presence of the Eternal Father and to the gift of eternal life. 

Now, this is not saying anything against people who desire to be- 
long, to other societies. If a man is satisfied with any of the Christian 
sects, if it suits him or suits his wife, that is his concern. Generally 
speaking it is the "wife who does the religion in the outside world. I 
have conversed with a great many very prominent men, some of them 
members of Congress, and this is what they say : Oh, I don't care about 
religion, my wife does all that and I go to Church with her." Well, let 
•people who like that kind of thing keep on liking it and if they do not 
choose to receive what we have — which is perfection in religion, which 
is Godlike and comes from God, and leads to God — if they do not like 
that, why they have the privilege of letting it alone. We would not do 
anything to compel them, if we had the power, to walk in our way ; but 
that is not the point. If men like to believe in the doctrines and principles 
and sermons that are preached in the world, all right, but as for us, what 
should we do ? What is the duty of the .elders of Israel and of men 
holding the holy priesthood, and of the members of the Church who have 
been baptized into the Church? Their duty is to be with Christ, baptized 
into Christ, having put on Christ, coming unto him, belonging to him, to 
be part of the body of Christ, which is his Church, and to have no entang- 



PRESIDENT CHARLES W.. PENROSE. 



37 



ling alliances with anything outside. Not to .do any injury to anybody else 
who does not see as we do, not at all; not to find fault with them for 
taking their own way, but our way should be the way of the Lord. 

We have no need of anything else. In the troubles that are coming— 
for the world is menaced now with troubles and strife and division which 
will bring misery and sorrow and destruction to many souls — let our 
place be in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, in the order 
of the holy priesthood, and we have no need to join other orders to take 
away part of our time, part of our influence, and part of our means and 
to hinder us from devoting ourselves entirely to the work of the Lord. 
Let me urge this upon the attention of my dear brethren and sisters who 
are here this afternoon. This is the Lord's work and it is marvelous in 
our eyes. Brother Lund alluded to the revelation of the Lord in the 
beginning, before there was any organized church of the Saints : "A great 
and marvelous work is about to come forth unto the children of men. 
Therefore, thrust in your sickle and reap." Yes, indeed, a marvelous 
work and a wonder, just as Isaiah predicted ; and one of the signs of it 
was that the wisdom of the wise would perish and the understanding of 
the prudent would come to naught ; but wisdom and inspiration and 
knowledge and certainty and power are in the gospel of Jesus Christ, 
revealed from him and by him and under his direction in the last days. 
Oh my brethren and sisters, why waste your time, your talents, your 
means, your influence in following something that will perish and pass 
away, when you could devote yourselves to a thing that will stand for- 
ever? For this Church and kingdom, to which you belong, will abide 
and continue in .time, in eternity, while endless ages roll along, and you 
with it will become mightier and more powerful ; while the things of this 
world will pass away and perish, and will not abide in nor after the resur- 
rection, saith the Lord our God. 

JOSEPH A MIGHTY PREACHER OF RIGHTEOUSNESS. 

So I say of our dear president, Brother Joseph F. Smith, to whose 
grandeur of character and faithfulness in the ministry and power and 
authority from God I add my humble testimony, if he were here I feel 
assured that he would touch on these questions in a far better way than 
I could attempt to do. He was a mighty preacher before the Lord. His 
words were golden. Many of them are treasured up ; others have passed 
away and will be heard perhaps no more until many ages may come in 
the future. The time will come when all things will be made manifest 
and the veil of the covering be taken away and we shall see as we are 
seen, and know as we are known. Our true character will come up and 
we will be judged and valued for what we are, not for what men have 
thought about us. In that time all these great things that are hid shall 
be revealed, from the beginning to the end of time, down through the 
great dispensations of the past and brought forth in the greatest dispensa- 
tion of all, the dispensation of the fullness of times. 

Now I add my testimony to the eulogies pronounced this morning so 
beautifully by our brethren upon the great men who have been with us 



38 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



and who have departed from us. The Lord has proved to us that great 
as. they were, others can come forth to perform his work, when he is 
with them ; that this work does not depend upon any single individual or 
any little coterie of individuals. It is the Lord's work, and is marvelous 
in our eyes. We will abide with it and give it our support, do what little 
we can while we live on the earth, and when we depart we fully expect, 
without any doubt in our souls, to go over to the great multitude of men 
and women behind the veil who are engaged in this same work, carrying 
it to those who sit in darkness in the spirit world, working 
for Christ and for the salvation of mankind under his direction, fighting 
under his banner the powers that are evil and preparing the great day 
when he shall come, and the Saints with him, arid reign over all the 
earth in mighty power and glory. God help us to do this. God help us 
to see things as they are, to withdraw our influence from those things 
that are not of God, center our affections, our thoughts, our means, our 
influence, our power, and especially the authority of the holy priesthood 
in this great Church that the Lord has set up, which shall win its widen- 
ing way until all the generations of men that can be saved in this world 
and in the world behind the veil, shall be brought out of darkness into 
light and bow the knee to King Immanuel, and serve God our heavenly 
Father and acknowledge Jesus the Christ as King and Lord of all. Amen.

ELDER RUDGER CLAWSON 

In the quorums of the priesthood 
there is an irresistible, compelling 
power — The leaders of Israel, what 
■a galaxy of men! — President loseph 
F. Smith a powerful preacher of 
righteousness. 

Brethren and sisters, my feelings 
this afternoon are quite in accord 
with the views expressed by Presi- 
dent Penrose. I think we had a 
glorious meeting this morning. The 
gathering in of the quorums of the 
priesthood and arranging them in 
their order was eminently proper, 
and as they sat here filling the body 
of the house they presented a most 
inspiring scene. And when they 
arose and voted for our new Presi- 
dent and the General Authorities 
of the Church, quorum after quor- 
um, with uplifted hands, and fin- 
ally, when all the congregation 



stood with uplifted hands and 
voted, it indicated to me that there 
is in these quorums of priesthood 
an irresistable, compelling power; 
I was reminded of the trite saying 
that in unity there is strength, in 
division weakness. And surely, 
brethren and sisters, the Latter- 
day Saints are strong because they 
have a united priesthood and peo- 
ple. 

The theme chosen and dwelt up- 
on by the speakers this morning 
Was most ennobling. Our leaders, 
T ~-poh Smith, Brigham Young;, 
John Taylor, Wilford Woodruff, 
Lorenzo Snow and Joseph F. 
Smith — what a galaxy of men ! 
Where could you find their equal in 
all the world? These men were 
brilliant in the knowledge of truth. 
They were learned in the deep 
things of God, and they exercised 
keys and powers bearing upon the 
salvation of immortal souls. These 
men, prophets, seers and revelators, 
held the keys of the kingdom of 



ELDER RUDGER CLAW SON

heaven. Great were they indeed, 
but men, nevertheless, with their 
weaknesses and imperfections. 
However, their record, their faith, 
their words, their lives are before 
us, as an open book. Scan them 
as you will, investigate, look up 
their records from all sides and you 
will find no great blemishes. They 
were pure, good men, free from the 
sins of the world, and men whom 
we could safely follow. 

The late President Joseph 
Smith — I loved sincerely and deep- 
ly. I loved him because of his in- 
tegrity to the work of God. I 
loved him because of his good ex- 
ample before the Church and be- 
fore the world. I loved him be- 
cause of his kindly and thought- 
ful consideration for his brethren 
and associates in the ministry and 
for the Latter-day Saints generally, 
for he was a most genial and lov- 
able man. I loved him because of 
the wise counsel and timely ad- 
monitions that constantly fell from 
his lips. He was indeed a power- 
ful preacher of righteousness. The 
influence of his words will be felt 
by the coming generations. A . 
righteous man may die and pass 
from the earth, but his words of 
truth and testimony can not die and 
will not pass away,, but they will 
live in the hearts of the people and 
bear Jruit to the honor and the 
glory of God. 

The following fervent exhorta- 
tion was uttered by President 
Joseph F. Smith, at the April 
conference of 190Z, which was 
shorty after he had been sustained 
as President of the Church. Breth- 
ren and .sisters give ear to these 
words : 

"Let us sustain the cause of Zion. 
Let no man speak lightly of the or- 



dinances of the house of God. Let 
no man hold in derision the priest- 
hood that the Lord has restored to 
the earth. It is the authority that 
He has given unto men. Let no man 
look contemptuously upon the organ- 
ization of the Churcxi of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints as it has been 
established in the earth through the 
instrumentality of the Prophet Joseph 
Smith, whom the Lord raised up 
when he was but a child to lay the 
foundation of the same. Let no man 
treat these things lightly or doubt- 
ingly, but let every man seek to in- 
still and understand me truth and 
teach his children to become famil- 
iar with those truths of heaven which 
have been restored to earth in the 
latter days. I believe with all my soul 
in God the Father and our Lord and 
Savior Jesus Christ. I believe with 
all my might, mind and strength in 
the Savior of the world , and in the 
principles of • redemption from death 
and sin. I believe in the divine mis- 
sion of the Prophet Joseph Smith. 
I believe in all the truth that I know, 
and I believe that there are many 
principles of eternal truth that still 
lie hidden from man and from the 
understanding of men which will yet 
be revealed by the power of God unto 
his faithful servants. I believe that 
the Lord has revealed unto the chil- 
dren of men all that they know. I 
do not believe that any man has dis- 
covered any principle of science or 
art, in mechanism or mathematics or 
anything else that God did not know 
before man did. Man is indebted to 
the Source of all intelligence and 
truth for the knowledge that he pos- 
sesses and all who will yield obe- 
dience to the promptings of the Spirit 
which lead to virtue, to honor, to the 
love of God and man to the love of 
truth and that which is ennobling and 
enlarging to the soul will get a clean- 
er and more expansive and more di- 
rect and conclusive knowledge of 
God's truths than any one else can 
obtain. I believe this because I know 
it is true. The Lord Almighty iive^. 
He made the heavens and the earth 
and the fountains of water. We are 
his children, his offspring and we are 
not here by chance. The Lord le- 
signed our coming and the object of 
our being here. He designs that we 
shall accomplish our mission to be-

come conformed to the likeness and 
image of Jesus Christ that like him 
we may be without sin unto salva- 
tion, and like him we may be filled 
with pure intelligence, and like him 
we may be exalted to the right hand 
of the Father to sit upon thrones and 
have dominions and power in the 
sphere in which we shall be called 
to act. I testify to tnis doctrine for 
the Lord has made me to know and 
feel the truth of it from the crown of 
my head to the souls of my feet. 1 
love good honorable men, even men 
who may be mistaken, as far as ibeir 
judgment is concerned, but who try 
to do right. I love them for the rea- 
son that they are my brethren and 
sons of my Father and I would that 
they might all see the truth as it is 
in Christ Jesus and accept it and re- 
ceive all the benefits of it in time and 
throughout all eternity. If the Lord 
has revealed to the world a plan of 
salvation and redemption from sin 
by which men may be exalted again 
into his presence and partake of 
eternal life with him, I submit as a 
propos : tion that can not be contro- 
verted that no man can be exalted in 
the presence of God and attain to a 
fulness of glory and happiness in his 
kingdom and presence save and ex- 
cept he will obey the plan that God 
'has devised and revealed." 

Brethren and sisters, if we will 
take these few precious words to 
heart, treasure them up in our 
souls, and conform our lives to 
them, we will surely attain to a sal- 
vation and an exaltation in the ce- 
lestial kingdom, which is God's 
greatest gift to man. May the Lord 
bless us and help us to do his will, 
ard to follow in the steps of our 
file leaders, is my prayer in the 
name of Jesus. Amen.

I 

I rejoice today in being permitted 
to meet with you in this general 
conference and in being permitted 
to raise my hand to sustain those 
whom our heavenly Father has 
called to preside over us. It must 
be a source of strength to the Presi- 
dent of this Church to look into the 
faces of thousands of honest men 
and' women and observe them raise 
their hand in covenant with our 
Father in heaven, and sustain him 
in the office to which he has been 
called as president, of this great 
Church. The obligation that we 
make when we raise our hands un- 
der such circumstances, is a most 
sacred one. It does not mean that 
we will go quietly on our way and 
be willing that the prophet of the 
Lord shall direct this work, but it ' 
means, — if I understand the obliga- 
tion I assumed when I raised my 
hand — that we will stand behind 
him ; we will pray for him ; we will 
defend his good name, and we will 
strive to carry out his instructions 
as the Lord shall direct him to offer 
them to us while he remains in that 
position. So it is a power of 
strength that has been reared to- 
day to our beloved president, Heber 
J. Grant, and his counselors, as we 
voted for them in this solemn as- 
sembly. 

It is with peculiar feelings that I 
stand here today. At our last gen- 
eral conference I was stricken ill, 
and was only able to attend one 
meeting of the conference, being 
taken to the hospital from the first 
meeting in the morning. I am grate- 
ful that the remembrance I have of 



ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH 



41 



President Smith was his wonderful 
testimony borne on that occasion 
to us. I look back and feel that 
it was a privilege to be at that meet- 
ing, because it was the last assembly 
that he addressed in this great 
building. His work is done. The 
beautiful tributes that have been 
paid to him bv loving brothers and 
sisters of this Church have no effect 
now other than to comfort those of 
us who remain, but his wonderful 
devotion to duty, his magnanimous 
feeling toward mankind, his tender 
love of the weak and the erring, will 
be sources of inspiration to all of us 
who knew him, as long as we live 
upon the earth. 

There was no duty too arduous 
for him to perform, if he felt it 
was the will of the Lord. He began 
his work in infancy almost, and I 
might say in passing that his life 
was preserved from being smoth- 
ered to death by a mob when he was 
a little baby in his mother's arms. 
He was resuscitated and brought 
back to life after his little body had 
turned black as a result of suffoca- 
tion. He came across the great 
plains with his mother, and while 
only a child was a man in . deter- 
mination, standing by the side of his 
mother and those who were with 
her, determined to do his duty and 
serve God and keep his command- 
ments. When a mere youth he was 
called to the islands of the sea as 
referred to here this morning. He 
had to work his way across the 
ocean and was willing to do any- 
thing that he might be able to reach 
his field of labor ; not going as some 
of us do today, in a palace car and 
in a palatial steamer, but he went in 
a humble manner. He wrought 
upon the hearts of the people of that 
land until today there are thousands 
in the islands of the sea who call his 



name blessed; and in that land to 
which I have been called to go, he 
ministered in his young manhood, 
devoted himself in faith and devo- 
tion to win mankind to repentance, 
to warn men of the judgments that 
were impending, calling them from 
the error of their ways, begging 
them to turn to the Lord, to receive 
the gospel, and to accept of the 
mercy of our Father to those who 
love him and keep his command- 
ments. 

These are some of the memories 
that come to me upon my feet re- 
garding this blessed man. Of 
course, most of you, many of you, 
know how near he was to me, 
almost like a father. I had the op- 
portunity of traveling with him 
from ocean to ocean, and from the 
north land to the south, all over the 
United States. I had the pleasuie 
of watching over him by day and 
fuidin.? him by night. I have re- 
joiced in the testimony of the gos- 
pel that I have heard him bear in 
many places, and I have been made 
glad when I have seen the great 
strong men of the earth shake his 
hand and go away with the impres- 
sion that he was indeed no ordinary 
man. I have known of people who, 
out of curiosity, called at the office 
here in Salt Lake City to see Presi- 
dent Smith, and before they have 
left the ground upon which the 
building stands, I have heard them 
say, turning to each- other: "What 
a wonderful character!" 

Think of him as a little boy whose 
father was taken from him in his 
childhood — this little boy who was 
willing to go where the Lord want- 
ed him to go. He had not the op- 
portunities of college, of university- 
training, but he was lifted up clay 
by day, under the inspiration of al- 
mighty God, until he could stand 



42 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



among his fellows, honored and 
blessed,. and loved, not only by all 
Israel, but by many of those who 
are alien to the gospel of Jesus 
Christ. What did it, my brethren 
and sisters? It was the gospel of 
our Lord. It was devotion to the 
Father of us all. It was a desire 
to bless mankind, and a knowledge 
that our Father lives; that Jesus is 
th^ Christ, and then a determination 
to live \-.p to that knowledge in ol- 
der that he might gain a place be- 
side his beloved father and mother 
and the prophets who had gone be- 
fore, to be worthy of their compan- 
ionship throughout the ages of eter- 
nity. 

He was blessed as few men have 
been blessed in this world — indeed 
I might say as no other man I know 
of in this world, — by a most re- 
markable family, to which refer- 
ence has been made today, men and 
women who honor the Lord and 
keep his commandments, who re- 
vere their husband and father. We 
do well to remember, even at this 
remote period of time from his 
passing, the man who has been lift- 
ed from poverty to affluence, who 
was able to stand among his fel- 
lows unsurpassed by any child of 
our father who lived in his day. I 
am grateful that I have had the 
touch of his. hand, I am thankful 
that I have had the press of his lips 
upon mine, I am pleased that he 
considers me one of his family, and 
today I mourn his departure and 
remember his passing as if it were 
but yesterday. 

I am grateful to be permitted to 
Walk along the paths that he has 
walked, and as I go to that land re- 
ferred to by President Grant, I de- 
sire, with all my soul, to be worthy 
of those who have preceded me — 
the great and good men of this 



Church who have presided there in 
honor and dignity, and among them 
our beloved brother and president, 
Joseph F. Smith. There are those 
sitting here upon this stand who 
have been there and have per- 
formed a wonderful labor. I 
would like to say to you, my broth- 
ers and sisters, that I esteem it an 
honor — nay, more- than an honor, I 
esteem it a very great blessing — 
that the Lord has raised me from 
the feeble condition that I was in a 
short time ago, restoring me to 
such a condition of health that the 
brethren have felt that it will be 
possible for me to fill a mission in 
-a foreign land. I would not under- 
take ; it if it were any other kind of 
a mission. I know that my Re- 
deemer lives ; I know that Jesus 
Christ is the Son of God and is ex- 
alted at the right hand of his Fa- 
ther. I know that Joseph Smith 
was a prophet of the Lord. While 
he gave his temporal life in order 
that his testimony might be binding 
upon the children of men, I am sure 
as I stand here that today he is ex- 
alted in the presence of the Re- 
deemer, rejoicing in the develop- 
ment that has come to the work of 
the Lord since the gospel of Jesus 
Christ was restored to the earth 
through his humble instrumentality. 
I am grateful for the testimony that 
burns in my bosom that this is our 
Father's, work. 

Be diligent, ye men of Israel, who 
bear the Priesthood of our Lord. 
Do not think that you can gain the 
honor, the distinction and the eter- 
nal blessings that President Smith 
will gain if you do the works that 
are less than he has done. It is not 
necessary that a man should be a 
member of the Quorum of the 
Twelve, or the Presidency of the 
Church, in order to obtain the 



ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH 



43 



greatest blessings in the kingdom 
of our heavenly Father. These are 
but offices required in the Church, 
and there % are many faithful and 
devoted men worthy to fill these of- 
fices whose time and talents are 
needed throughout the Church. 
Th^re are, in the Church more good 
men than those occupying these 
positions, and remember that in 
the * ranks and throughout the 
Church there is ample opportunity 
for every man and for every woman 
to do something for the blessing of 
their fellows and for^the advance- 
ment of the work of the Lord. 

I see sitting before me today men 
who have been in the mission-field 
as presidents of missions, who have 
come her-e from their fields of labor, 
honorably released. They have 
performed yeoman service; tl\ey 
have devoted themselves to the 
blessing of God's children. They 
have left, in the fields from which 
they have come, men and women 
who bless them and who will 
remember them in tenderness 
throughout all times. I feel in my 
soul to bless them and welcome 
them home with their loved ones 
and pray that they may have their 
feet planted here among their loved 
ones in the valleys of the moun- 
tains with the same determination 
to serve God and magnify their call- 
ing, as they have manifested while 
they have been entrusted with pre- 
siding offices in the mission-field. 
I see before me men who have been 
called to succeed them. I pray that 
the spirit of their calling may fall 
upon them, that they may feel the 
inspiration of the Lord and fully 
understand the necessity of doing 
their duty as they go to their fields 
of labor, that they may rejoice in 
seeing the children of our Father 
come to him by reason of their 



faith and their devotion ; that they 
may rejoice, as those who come 
home have rejoiced and, if possible, 
that the blessings of the Lord may 
be more abundantly bestowed upon 
those among whom they minister, 
than has been done in the past. 

The world is in distress, in tra- 
vail, from one end of it to the 
other. Men and women are looking 
here and there, seeking where they 
shall go to do the things that will 
bring them peace. My brethren, 
the authority of the holy priesthood 
is upon the earth. The gospel of 
Jesus Christ has been restored. The 
truth revealed from heaven is here 
and it " is that truth,' that gospel, 
which, if the world only knew it, 
will be a panacea for all their ills. 
It is the only thing that will bring 
them peace while they remain upon 
the earth. 

I find here a short section of the 
Doctrine and Covenants to which 
I wish to draw your attention. I 
would like every man who bears the 
priesthood of our hea'venly Father 
to remember the words of this par- 
ticular section. I would like every 
man to apply it to himself, and* I 
would like every good woman who 
has received the blessings of the 
gospel to apply it to her life; and 
applying it to our lives, remember 
that our days are numbered and 
that the opportunity to magnify our 
calling will soon be cut short here 
in this world. This is a revelation 
given to the Prophet Joseph Smith 
in Harmony, Susquehanna county, 
Pennsylvania, February, 1829: 

"Now behold, a marvelous work is 
about to to come fortk among the 
children of men; 

"Therefore, O ye that embark in 
•the service of God. see that ye serve 
him with all your heart, might, mind 
and strength, that ye may stand 
blameless before God at the last day:" 



44 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



That is what I would Jike us to 
remember. That is the word of the 
Lord unto Israel, repeated again 
this day by one of God's servants. 
The world has need of you and of 
your ministry. There are no other 
men in the world, outside this 
Church, who have the rights that 
you have, and the privileges, and 
no other body of men will have the 
opportunities that come to you. 
Now that the time is near at hand 
when the bars will be let down and 
the barriers overthrown that have 
been raised to the spread of the gos- 
pel, when the sound of the voice of 
the Lord shall come to you, through 
his servants, "Prepare to go into 
the world and preach the gospel," 
do not do as Jonah did, do not 
try to hide or run away from your 
duty; do not make excuses that you 
do not have the necessary means to 
go ; do not set up foolish things 
in the way of your vision that will 
prevent your seeing eternal life in 
the presence of our heavenly Fa- 
ther, which ca"n come only by reason 
of faith and devotion in his cause. 
Let every man set his house in or- 
der; let every man who bears the 
priesthood, set himself in order, and 
when the call comes from the serv- 
ants of the Lord, telling him to go 
into the world to teach the truth, to 
warn the children of men, as our 
Father requires they shall be 
warned, let no man hide behind 
some foolish thing, to be swallowed 
up, if not by a great fish, by the 
foolish things of the world. 

I pray that the Spirit of God 
may burn in the bosoms of the Lat- 
ter-day Saints ; that the love and 
charity our Father has for his chil- 
dren may be ours ; that we may re- 
joice when we see his children un- 
derstanding the truth and that we 
may be willing to make what may 



sometimes be termed a sacrifice; 
that we may be willing to make the 
investment to bless our kind, going 
forth with all our might to bring 
light and salvation to the children of 
men by preaching unto them the re- 
stored gospel of our Lord. 

Now, my brethren and sisters, I 
may have no- other opportunity of 
saying goodbye to you, before I 
leave. Next Wednesday I expect 
to take the train to the coast and 
then across the ocean to the field 
to which I have been called. Thank 
God for the opportunity of going. 
I am grateful that the knowledge of 
this truth has come into my soul. I 
am thankful for the companionship 
of the men by whom I have been 
surrounded and with whom I have 
been permitted to associate. I am 
grateful for you and for the kind- 
ness you have bestowed upon me as 
I have ministered unto you in your 
homes in the stakes and wards of 
the land. God bless you and' yours 
and all Israel. O, brothers and sis- 
ters, pray with all your might that 
the light may enter into the hearts 
of the children of men; that they 
may turn from the error of their 
ways when the' gospel is brought to 
them by a humble eider; that they 
may understand the voice and re- 
ceive the message and be gathered 
out from the nations, before the 
Lord shall sweep the earth again 
with his scourges, as he has prom- 
ised to do. This is" but the begin- 
ning of sorrow and it is your duty 
and mine to minimise so far as pos- 
sible, the sorrows of our Father's 
children, by blessing them with the 
message of peace, with the gospel 
of love, and call them from the er- 
ror of their ways; that they may 
rejoice with us, if we are faithful, 
in the mansions of glory on high. 
May the peace and blessing of our 



ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH 



45 



'leavenly Father be upon us all. 
May we be worthy of the opportun- 
ity that has come to us. May we 
see the magnitude of the work we 
have set our hands to do and re- 
member the commandment that we 
shall do it with all our might, mind 
and strength; that we may stand 
"blameless before the Lord at the 
last day. 

With all my heau, I sustain the 
men whom we have sustained today 
— President Grant and his coun- 
selors- — to preside over us. They 
have been called by divine power; 
they have been sustained by this 
great people, and the Lord will sus- 
tain them in their ministry. They 
are unselfish and they are untiring 
in going about doing good and 
blessing those who live upon the 
earth. I honor them and I love 
them. I pray that our Father will 
bless them that they may have joy 
in their ministry. I pray that these, 
my brethren of the Council of the 
Twelve, whom I soon stiall leave, 
may have joy in their ministry 
wherever they may go. Brethren 
and sisters, welcome them into your 
homes and into the organized stakes 
as they go among you. They bring 
to you a message of love, as also do 
the First Council of Seventy, the 
Patriarch and the presiding Bishop- 
ric, all those who, <is general au- 
thorities of the Church go to visit 
you from time to time. These all 
are our Father's servants. Honor 
them, sustain them, and bless them, 
and our Father will honor and sus- 
tain and bless you. I pray that our 
Father may grant unto you the 
peace that passeth all understand- 
ing. 

May the joy of the memory of 
that devoted man, President Joseph 
F. Smith, m whose honor, in part 
at ieast, we have met here today, 



remain with us. Let us try, so far 

as may be, to measure up to his 
splendid virtue and. bv and by — it 
may not be long for any of us — 
when the Father of us all shall sum- 
mon us home, that we may find 
awaiting us on the other shore 
these splendid men and women who 
have honored God and kept his 
commandments, who have earned 
celestial glory in our Father's king- 
dom, that we may rejoice with 
them and they with us throughout 
the ages of eternity, is my desire! 
O may the Lord bless us all; may 
he help us to appreciate the oppor- 
tunity that is placed in our way 
and give us a burning desire to bless- 
our kind. May we honor him and 
keep his commandments, and in the 
end obtain eternal life and celestial 
glory with our Father's children 
wherever they may be in the world, 
who are worthy, is my prayer in 
the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

Tribute to President Joseph F. Smith 
— The elements of greatness — 
The .machinery and the power — 
Anecdote of Bishop Newel K. 
Whitney — Jeremiah's call — Joseph 
and Sidney's vision — Church lead- 
ers past and present. 

President Joseph F. Smith was 
not only a Prophet; he was also a 
Patriarch— a fatherly man in every 
sense of the term. Second only 
to his loyalty and devotion to the 
work of God, was his warm and 
tender love for his family — his 
wives and children. Their welfare 
and happiness in time and for all 
eternity were his constant care. 

And how rich was his recom- 
pense! In all that numerous flock 
of sons and daughters, not one 
"black sheep" is to be found, not

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



one wanderer from the fold of the 
Good Shepherd. This reflection 
must have been to him an unfail- 
ing source of comfort and consola- 
tion. The divinest work of Divin- 
ity, the most Godlike of all 
achievements, is in "bringing to 
pass the immortality and eternal 
life of man." Next to that, and 
indeed a very part thereof, is the 
rearing of a family as President 
Smith reared his. He fully real- 
ized that it represented the nucleus 
and foundation of his eternal 
glory. 

His paternal affection, though it 
began at home, did not end there. 
It went out far beyond the bound- 
aries of his domestic domain. It 
embraced God's people as a whole, 
rich and poor, high and low. All 
who served the Lord were sharers 
in his sympathy and esteem. 

Few things pleased the Presi- 
dent more than to welcome to his 
hospitable home, or to public halls 
owned by the Church, his friends 
and fellow-laborers, for purposes 
of entertainment. A marked feat- 
ure of his administration was an 
extended series of receptions, given 
at Conference time, in honor of the 
veterans who drove ox teams or 
pulled hand carts over the plains 
in pre-railroad days, or were oc- 
cupying posts of hardship, if not 
of danger, in out of the way sec- 
tions. 

His kind thoughtfulness for the 
aged, and his tender concern for 
little children, were among his 
most pronounced characteristics. 
He held that children as well as 
men and women have rights, ' and 
that these rights should always be 
respected. I was present on one 
occasion when he expressed him- 
self indignantly over the conduct 
of a woman who, coming late into 



a public assembly, drew a child 
out of a seat that / she wished to 
occupy. I have known him to 
leave his place on a railroad train 
to speak a word of comfort to a 
poor old lady, whose feelings had 
been hurt by an ill-mannered con- 
ductor. Once I saw him, when an 
excursion was about to start, walk 
the full length of the crowded train, 
with no apparent object but to sat- 
isfy himself that everyone else was 
comfortably seated; and not until 
every chick and child was provided 
for, did the President of the 
Church take his seat. 

"Safety first" was his business 
motto. He never plunged reck- 
lessly into an enterprise, however 
inviting, and always lnolted before 
he leaped. Like Longfellow's 
Blacksmith, he "owed not any 
man," and this was ever his coun- 
sel to the people. Nor would he 
allow the Church to become indeb- 
ted for a single dollar that it could 
not pay %i demand. As Trustee- 
in-Trust, he permitted no needless 
expenditure of the funds entrusted 
to his care, and he kept and ren- 
dered strict account of all monies 
or other properties that came into 
his hands as custodian. He was 
determined that the credit of the 
Church, which he had helped to 
make "gilt-edged," should so re- 
main. 

A complete list of the public works 
connected with President Smith's 
career would form a lengthy cata- 
logue. Never before in the his- 
tory of the Latter-day Saints was 
there such a building administra- 
tion. Those who criticized him 
for what they deemed a too active 
narticioation in commercial affairs, 
and thought that he should have 
been engrossed in spiritual things 
to the exclusion of the temporal, 



ELDER ORSON F. WHITNEY 



47 



overlooked the fact that from the 
"Mormon" point of view, the spir- 
itual includes the temporal. 

Every one who truly knew Jo- 
seph F. Smith recognized in him a 
man of mighty faith and religious 
power — a spiritual giant. A won- 
derfully impressive public speaker, 
he was deliberate and slow of ut- 
terance until aroused, when his 
words came like a torrent, with 
the roar of the cataract or the 
thunder peal. In forceful and ve- 
hement oratory, or what might be 
termed emotional eloquence, he had 
no equal in the Church. 

President Smith's dominant 
traits were his unflinching cour- 
age and his unflagging devotion 
to duty. A man more diligent, 
more industrious, more zealous in 
the practice of the principles he- 
professed, it would be impossible 
to find. Honest, tearless, and de- 
termined, he did not court martyr- 
dom, but neither would he have 
shrunk from it, had the choice been 
between death and dishonor. He 
was an example of moral recti- 
tude, of clean conduct, of right liv- 
ing. His noble qualities, his illus- 
trious lineage, and his exalted na- 
tion gave him a prestige 'all but 
unrivaled in the annals of the 
Church over which he presided. 
From his youth up, throughout his 
entire career, he stood a stalwart in 
the land, a man of unblemished in- 
tegrity, a rock against which the 
billows of temptation beat and 
dashed in vain. 

What made Joseph F. Smith 
such a character? Two things: In 
the first place, he was a big man — 
big by nature, and developed by 
experience. In the next place, Gccl 
was with him. The machinery is 
one thing, and the power that 
moves the machinery is another. 



The two combined constitute great . 
ness. 

Presiding Bishop Edward 
Hunter — he it was, if I remember 
aright — once related to me an an- 
ecdote about his predecessor, my 
grandfather, Newel K. Whitney, 
the second man called to the Bish- 
opric in this dispensation. It was 
at Kirtland, Ohio, in December, 
1831. The law of consecration had 
been revealed and was about to be 
put into operation. The properties 
of the Saints had to be consecrated 
for the building up of Zion, and 
Bishops were needed to handle 
these properties and administer the 
temporalities of the Church. Ed- 
ward Partridge was the first Bish- 
op called, but'' he had been sent 
down into Missouri, where the 
foundations of Zion were laid, and 
another Bishop was needed for 
Kirtland, — a Stake of Zion. The 
Lord said: "My servant Newel K. 
Whitney is the man who shall be 
appointed and ordained unto this 
power." (Doctrine & Covenants 
72:8.) Newel K. Whitney, stag- 
gering under the weight of the re- 
sponsibility that was about to be 
placed upon him, said to the Proph- 
et: "Brother Joseph, I can't see a 
Bishop in myself." 

No ; but God could see it in him. 
He was a natural Bishop — a first 
class man of affairs. Probably no 
other incumbent of that important 
office, the Presiding Bishopric, to 
which he eventually attained, has 
;been better qualified for it than 
Newel K. Whitney. But he could 
not see it, and he shrank from the 
responsibility. The Prophet ans- 
wered : "Go and ask the Lord about 
it." And Newel did ask the Lord, 
and he heard a voice from heaven 
say: "Thy strength is in me." 
That was enough. He accepted the 



48 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 

* 



office, and served in it faithfully to 
the end of his days — a period of 
eighteen years. 

When I heard this anecdote, it 
reminded me of the Prophet Jere- 
miah, to whom the word of the 
Lord came, saying in effect : "Be- 
fore I formed thee in the body I 
knew thee, and I sanctified thee 
and ordained thee a prophet unto 
the nations." But Jeremiah, over- 
whelmed by the call to such a re- 
sponsible station, exclaimed : "Ah, 
Lord God, behold I cannot speak ; 
for I am a child." But the Lord 
said : "Say not, I am a child, for 
thou shalt go to all that I shall send 
thee, and whatsoever I command 
thee, thou shalt speak. * * Be not 
dismayed at their faces * * for 
behold I have made thee this day a 
defensed city, and an iron pillar and 
brazen walls against the whole 
land, against the kings of Judah, 
against the princes thereof, against 
the priests thereof, and against the 
people of the land. And they shall 
fight against thee ; ' but they shall 
not prevail against thee ; for I am 
with thee saith the Lord, to deliver 
thee." (Jer. 1:4-7; 17-19.) 

God was with his servant, 
Joseph Smith, a man pf great gifts, 
a mighty soul, sent into the world 
to be a prophet, a seer and a revela- 
tor. But what could he have done 
if Go rl had not been with him? 
When Joseph Smith and Sidney 
Bisfdon saw that wonderful vision 
of the celestial, terrestrial, and 
Mestial °dories, they said concern- 
ing it: "Being in the Spirit, on the 
sixteenth day of February, in the 
year of our Lord, 1832, by the 
power of the Spirit our eyes were 
opened," etc. There is the key. It 
was because God was with them, 
that they were able to see the Son 
of God and converse with him "in 



the heavenly vision." They had 
eyes — spiritual eyes; they were 
seers. But what could they see 
until the Spirit of God came upon 
them and gave them the use of the 
seeric gift? The machinery was 
there, but the power had to be 
turned on. 

So it was with Brigham Young, 
with John Taylor, with Wilford 
Woodruff, with Lorenzo Snow, 
with Joseph F. Smith ; and so it is 
with Heber J. Grant, our beloved 
President of today. He has great 
gifts, a big heart, a kind soul, and 
because God is with him he will 
do a great and glorious work. But 
without God, neither he nor any 
other man could accomplish any- 
thing worth while. 

This is my testimony regarding 
the First Presidency of the Church. 
They are the right men in the right 
place — the men for the time and the 
hour; and it is for us to stand by 
them, to hold up their hands, to 
rally round them and follow them ; 
and God's work will triumph, his 
Kingdom will come in power and 
glory, and his holy will be done on 
earth even as it is done in heaven. 
Amen. 

The choir and ■ congregation 
sang one verse of: "The Spirit of 
God like a fire is burning." 

A number of notices were read 
among them a statement that the 
choir would hold a concert in the 
Tabernacle, Friday, June 6, 5 p. m., 
when they would present Mendel- 
sohn's oratorio, "St. Paul ;" the 
Sunday School Union meeting 
would be held this evening in the 
Tabernacle ; and a special Priest- 
hood meeting in the Assembly Hall, 
Wednesday, June 4, 10 a. m. 

The choir sang the anthem: 
"Praise."

SECOND OVERFLOW 
MEETING. 

A second overflow meeting was 
held in the Assembly Hall, at 2 
o'clock p. m., Sunday, June 1, 1919, 
Elder Joseph Fielding Smith, pre- 
siding. 

Music was furnished by the Lat- 
ter-day Saints University students 
choir, directed by B. Cecil Gates. 

The choir and congregation 
sang: "Now let us rejoice." 

The opening prayer was by El- 
der Harden Bennion. 

The choir sang: "Remember, O

ELDER HYRUM G. SMITH 

(Presiding Patriarch of the Church). 

As was announced this morning 
in our general conference, the pro- 
gram for this afternoon is to .re- 
member both in spirit and in word 
the life, mission and works of our 
late president, Joseph F. Smith, and 
I am very grateful for ^another 
privilege of raising my voice in tes- 
timony concerning his life and mis- 
sion. 

It has been said by a number of 
older men, that they knew the 
Prophet Joseph Smith, and that 
they have known all of the presi- 
dents in their succession since him. 
It seems to me as if I knew him, 
because 1 have seen and heard those 
who did see; hear, and know him, 
ancHp my faith is just as firm and 
just as well founded, perhaps, as if 
I had known him and seen him with 



my own eyes. I believe in his mis- 
sion, and know that he was a 
prophet of God. Neither did I see 
his successor, President Brigham 
Young, because his mission was fin- 
ished two years before mine began 
here upon the earth. So.like unto the 
Prophet Joseph in my life, the life 
of President Brigham Young is that 
of memory and history to me. But 
I have heard the voice of those who 
were in that meeting which was re- 
ferred to by President Grant where 
the mantle of the Prophet Joseph 
fell upon President Brigham 
Young, when some of the people 
were in doubt as to who was going 
to lead the Church, after the mar- 
tyrdom. 

So I feel that I have really par- 
taken of the gathering upon that 
occasion, and I testify here that I 
think that the lives of men and 
women have been spared to us, to 
me for instance, to hear their voices 
in this great testimony which estab- 
lished the fact in my mind, as it 
did in the minds of hundreds of 
Latter-day Saints, that it was Pres- 
ident Brigham Young who was to 
lead the Church instead of Sidney 
Rigdon or any other man. . I am 
grateful that «the lives of these men 
and women have been spared that I 
might hear their testimony, since I 
did not live in the time when it was 
possible for me to have attended 
that meeting or to get that testi- 
mony first hand. I have faith in 
the testimonies of these men and 
women whom I have mentioned. I 
mention particularly the life of 
Aunt Emmeline B. Wells. I think 
her life has been spared by the pow- 
er of the Lord, for at least one pur- 
pose — that the youth of Zion might 
hear her testimony, that she was in 
that meeting and heard 'the voice of 
the Prophet Joseph from the mouth 



50 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



of President Brigham Young. e T 
have also heard the testimony of 
Patriarch George Romney, whose 
life has been spared, I believe, that 
his testimony may go forth among 
ithe young people concerning that 
same fact, and circumstance. 

I do not remember President 
Taylor; although as a small boy, I 
may have seen him. but. during his 
presidency of the Church, his per- 
sonal mission did not come into my 
life, because I did not live in Salt 
Lake City, and so I did not get 
acquainted with him. But I do 
have a distinct remembrance of 
President Wilford Woodruff. I 
think my first memory of him was 
when the Salt Lake temple was ded- 
icated. 

I have also a very distinct mem- 
ory of President Lorenzo Snow. 
When I was a member of the 
Church school at Provo, he came 
to the school, and 1 remember tha«t 
a number of small children marched 
up to the stand and presented him 
with flowers ; and as they passed by 
he gave each one a blessing by plac- 
ing his hand upon their heads. That 
was a very impressive memory in 
my life. 

I also have a very distinct mem- 
ory of the life of my dear uncle, 
President Joseph F. Smith, and I 
learned to love him, although we 
were separated about three genera- 
tions. There are many people in 
the Church who, perhaps, due to 
their ' lack of acquaintance of the 
family history, have taken me to be 
a member of his family. But had I 
been an actual son of his, he could 
ndt have treated me better. His 
latest words to me were to the ef- 
fect that I was not a real member of 
his family, but that he felt towards 
me as though I were a member of 
his immediate family; also in ten- 



derness expressing his love for me. 
His kindness ftoward me was so 
manifest, I could not help but love 
him. I was always happy while in 
his presence, and I never had that 
feeling of timidity or desire to with- 
draw from him. There seemed to 
be power in his spirit that drew me 
toward him rather than repelled 
me from him. I love his memory, 
and look upon his testimony and his 
works as those of a prophet of the 
Lord, as those of one who was 
among the leading prophets and 
presidents of the Church in all the 
world. 

I have often contrasted the 
events of history, when he took rthe 
office of president and when he left 
it. Outsiders, as we speak of non- 
members, looked upon him, how 
they hated him. Many of them said 
violent words about him ; and they 
not only said words but they drew 
hideous pictures about him, cari- 
catured him, and maligned his name 
and family. 

Although I was not present upon 
either of the occasions to which I 
shall refer, I have heard that when 
Prest. Joseph F. Smith was taken as 
a witness before the United States 
Senate that people in the gallery, 
many of them influential persons 
and officers of the government with 
their friends, actually hissed at him 
when he was brought in before 
<them as a witness; but before the 
close of that great case, these very 
persons, sought an opportunity to 
pay respect to him. 

Upon another occasion, the gen- 
ealogists of Utah were gathered in 
a great meeting in California, where 
Kthere were many friends gathered, 
many influential men and women 
gathered in an outdoor mating. 
Many of them were wearing their 
hats, and when President Joseph F, 



ELDER RICHARD R. LYMAN 



51 



Smith arose and declared that he 
wished to speak to them as a serv- 
ant^of the Lord Jesus Christ, fthose 
men took off their hats and paid 
him due reverence, not as just an 
ordinary man, but as a servant of 
the Lord who was to speak to them 
in the name of Jesus Christ. And 
they gave reverence fto him, by un- 
covering their heads. 

Little by little these changes took 
place until, as you remember, the 
hour of his funeral, by the procla- 
mation of the Governor of this 
State, every house of business, 
every piece of machinery, almost, 
I'hat was run by the state was closed 
and stopped for one hour; and. not 
only the places of business through- 
out the state, but all men who knew 
him, whether they once hated him 
or not, once slighted the work that_ 
he did, or fthe cause which he repre- 
sented, gave reverence to him and 
his name, and the work that he rep- 
resented, the work of God. I am 
also told that in the distant and re- 
mote towns of this stette the stores 
were closed. All business was 
closed. Street cars here in this busy 
city stopped for one hour, no mat- 
ter where they were, at the given 
time. Other tokens of respecft also 
were shown to him. This was a 
wonderful contrast to show that the 
people of the world, not only our 
friends, but our very enemies, have 
given honor to this man "whom 
God hath chosen." 

So I love and bless his memory. 
I join with my fellows in praying 
God to bless his memory, and those 
who shall live after him, that his 
teachings may live in our hearts, 
that we may honor them, and 
through them honor God, in the 
name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 



ELDER RICHARD R. LYMAN 

During President Joseph F. Smith's 
administration all but three of the 
members have come into their pres- 
ent positions — Other great changes 
that have taken place — Persecution 
turned to admiration — The barren 
places into a veritable garden of 
roses — President Smith's rise from a 
lowly station to the highest among 
his people — His character and life. 

My feelings were greatly touch- 
ed, as no doubt yours were also, 
when, in the Tabernacle this morn- 
ing, President Heber J. Grant took 
the place as presiding officer, which 
for some seventeen years had been 
occupied by President Joseph F. 
Smith. 

Last Thursday at the regular 
weekly meeting of the First Presi- 
idency and the Council of the 
Twelve, President Grant explained 
that all but three of the members 
of the Council have come into their 
places during the administration of 
President Smith. "Therefore," he 
said, "it will be very fitting for all 
of us to speak briefly in honor of 
this wise and now immortal man 
and prophet, President Joseph F. 
Smith, at the memorial services 
which will be held for him as a por- 
tion of the general conference next 
Sunday." 

Not only are the members of the 
First Presidency and of the Coun- 
cil of the Twelve assembled here 
today to do honor to his memory, 
but the presidents of nearly all the 
stakes, and the bishops of nearly 
all the wards, and the counselors to 
all of these, are also present. Of 
these I say what a traveling sister 
recently said of the presidents of 
the stakes : "I think no finer band 
of men can be found in all the 
world." 



52 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



The heart of President Smith 
must be glad and gratified at this 
hour if he knows that all of these 
worthy officials are assembled, and 
so many other thousands of the 
members of the Church, that three 
great services are being held simul- 
taneously in order to accommodate 
the multitude that is here for the 
purpose of paying respect to his 
dear memory. 

During the administration of 
President Smith great changes 
have come. The intense prejudice 
that existed in the beginning has 
disappeared. The Patriarch, in his 
remarks has just referred to con- 
ditions that existed at the time of 
the Smoot investigation. Well do 
I remember those conditions. I was 
a graduate student at Cornell Uni- 
versity. The Ithaca papers printed 
glaring headlines drawing; atten- 
tion to the testimony and published 
grotesque cartoons of those who, 
as witnesses, were being examined. 
These were trying davs for me. 
They must have been much more 
trying for those of our neoole who 
were in Washington. The public 
jeered at the president. Thev sooke 
to him and of him disrespect full v. 
His keen sensibilities were deeoly 
cut when in derision they called him 
"Prophet Smith." But truth will 
prevail. Rie:ht is might. When 
right and riehteousncss really come 
to the attention, then are people 
convinced. 

It was but a few vears after this 
investigation that President Smith 
went again to the city of Wash- 
ington. Instead of being addressed 
as "Prophet Smith." he was greeted 
on every hand with "Mr. President, 
I am delighted to see you." The 
Vice-president of the United States 
said to him : "Mr. President, may 
I have the pleasure of your com- 



pany at the great foot-ball contest 
this afternoon?" 

Fairy tales hardly draw pictures 
more thrilling than that of the life 
of President Joseph F. Smith. 
When, as a boy at the age of nine, 
he dr.ove an ox team into Salt Lake 
Valley, there was here, I have 
heard him say, but one green spot. 
If I remember correctly, he said 
there- was in sight but one green 
tree and that tree grew on City 
Creek. This was then a prairie — 
a desert. During the seventy years 
since his coming, barrenness has 
been changed to beauty. This is to- 
day a veritable garden of roses. We 
are surrounded with every luxury 
and convenience of modern times. 

The story of the life of President 
Smith is not unlike the story of 
David, Kin? of Israel. The Lord 
said unto the Proohet Samuel : 
"How Ion? wilt thou mourn for 
Saul, seeing- I have rejected him 
from reignine over Israel? Fill 
th>ne horn with oil a"d pt>. I will 
send thee to Jesse, the Bethlehemite : 
for I hnve provided me a king 
among his .sons. 

"Samuel did that which the Lord 
spake, and came to Bethlehem." 

When Jesse brought before him 
one of his handsome sons, tall and 
erect, the Prophet Samuel said : 
"Surely the Lord's anointed is be- 
fore him." 

"But the Lord said unto Samuel, 
look not on his countenance or on 
the heieht of his stature ; because I 
have refused him ; for the Lord 
seeth not as man seeth ; for man 
looketh on the outward appear- 
ance, but the Lord looketh on the 
heart." And Jesse brought another 
son, and another, and another, rntil 
seven had passed by. 

Then Samuel said_ unto Jes-e : 
"The Lord hath not chosen these. 



ELDER RICHARD R. LYMAN 



53 



Are here all thy children?" Jesse 
said : "There remaineth yet the 
youngest and behold he keepeth the 
sheep." 

Who was he? The carpenter's 
son? Was he the widow's boy that 
drove the ox team across the prairie 
in 1848? Was it the little fellow 
who herded cows bare-footed in 
this great valley long years ago? 
"Yes," said Jesse, "There remain- 
eth yet the youngest and behold he 
keepeth the sheep." 

And Samuel said unto Jesse: 
"Send and fetch him: for we will 
not sit down till he come hither." 

When the shepherd boy with the 
ruddy, handsome countenance ap- 
peared, the Lord said: "Arise, 
anoint him, for this is he." 

As it was with the shepherd 
David, so was it. with the carpen- 
ter's son; and so was it with the 
widow's son who drove the ox team 
into the valley, in 1848. "The Lord 
seeth not as man seeth; for man 
looketh on the outward appearance, 
but the Lord looketh on the heart." 
All honor to the memory of Presi- 
dent Joseph F. Smith, the widow's 
son. Under his leadership and the 
blessings of God, we find ourselves 
today a united, happy and prosper- 
ous people. 

The sterling strength and nature 
of Joseph F. Smith would permit 
him to make no compromise with 
sin. On one occasion, he was ap- 
proached, by an attractive young 
woman, a member of the Church, 
who said : "My profession brings 
me on the stage where short sleeves 
and low necks are a positive neces- 
sity. Is it not possible in my case 
to have the regulations of the 
Church slightly modified ? Are you 
going to require me to live in the 
same strict conformity with the 



technicalities of the gospel in this 
respect as you do others?" 

Some might ask the president: 
"In my case, may I not take just a 
little tea?" Or another in poor 
health might say: "May I not be 
permitted to take just a little cof- 
fee?" Still another might ask: "In 
this one case, will you not permit 
me to take just a little liquor?" Still 
others : "Is it necessary for me in 
my condition to remember the Lord 
every night and morning in my 
family and secret prayers?" 

To all such questions as these, 
President Joseph F. Smith would 
reply, as he did to the charming lit- 
tle lady : "My dear little girl, if you 
do any of these things, you must do 
lb em on your own responsibility." 

One of the great lecturers speak- 
ing before the Bonneville Club, at 
the Hotel Utah recently, said : 
"After the names in your city direc- 
tory or telephone book you fre- 
quently find such words as doctor, 
merchant, dentist, lawyer, engineer, 
etc., etc. These words do not indi- 
cate the main business of those 
whose names they follow. They 
only indicate their sidelines. The 
main business of every man and the 
main business of every woman is 
the rearing of a family." 

There is no part of the excellent 
life and labor of President Joseph 
F. Smith that he did with more pro- 
• nounced success than he performed 
this, the main business of his life, 
the rearing of his family. History, 
ancient or modern, does not record 
a more perfect example of man's 
first and highest duty well done 
than that of President Joseph F. 
Smith in the rearing of his large 
and worthy and wonderful pos- 
terity. 

For this good man and for his 
good life and wise leadership our

hearts are full of gratitude. May 
we put forth successful efforts to 
follow hfs teachings and his worthy- 
example. Every feature of his life, 
is an inspiration.

ELDER STEPHEN L. RICHARDS 

Faith emphasized and made plain in 
the life of President Joseph F. Smith 
— His life and words forceful and 
powerful — An erecter of standards 
and respecter of law — Few could 
equal his record of service — As a 
father and husband, he had few, if 
any equals — He was a home-builder 
— As a preacher of righteousness, he 
held first place among us — His was 
the strength of being clean and he 
abhorejj impurity and evil habits — 
His main influence for good upon 
the thousands who heard and loved 
him. 

I can hope, at best, to make but 
little contribution to the splendid 
eulogies that have been paid to our 
late President. I do not hesitate, 
however, to respond with some little 
feeling of satisfaction as well as 
trepidation to the call which gives 
me the opportunity of acknowledg- 
ing, in some measure at least, my 
obligation to President Joseph F. 
Smith, a debt of gratitude to him 
that I feel I cannot express, and I 
can scarcely ever hope to repay. 

I believe that every man and 
every woman requires an ideal. 
President Smith was my ideal in 
so many respects that I have a very 
large obligation to him for the lead- 
ing of my life and for the inculca- 
tion of the principles which have 
controlled it. He was my ideal in 
nearly every respect. He so em- 
bodied in his life the great princi- 
ples which I hold dear that he gave 
them a significance and a meaning 
and a tangibility that they could 



have had in no other way. I be- 
lieve that he was the greatest liv- 
ing exponent of the gospel of the 
Lord Jesus Christ that we have 
known, at least in our day and gen- 
eration. So perfectly, indeed, did 
he incorporate into his life the 
great principles to which he dedi- 
cated himself and his effort, that 
those principles were vitalized and 
made plain and sacred in his living, 
to an extent seldom achieved in the 
life of any man. When I think of 
the great principle of faith, I im- 
mediately think of the manner in 
which that principle was made plain 
and tangible in the life of Presi- 
dent Joseph F. Smith. He was the 
very incarnation of faith. He made 
faith a plain, livable principle of the 
gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. 
That great principle which is at the 
foundation of all religious life ra- 
diated from his very person. When 
you heard him bear testimony of 
the truth and give expression to 
the faith that was in his soul, you 
never doubted, not for a moment, 
the truth of that which he felt and 
that which he spoke. It seemed so 
perfectly plain to him that he in 
turn could make it plain to others. 

When you think of the other 
great principles of the gospel — re- 
pentance, the Word of Wisdom, and 
prayer, and other fundamental 
truths, you cannot dis-associate 
those principles from the life and 
attributes of Joseph F. Smith. He 
taught them in the one great way 
that all great principles of truth 
must be taught, in order to be effec- 
tive in the lives of men, by living 
them. Great as were his words, 
potential as was the great message 
that he always had to bear' to the 
people, his words and his message 
were never so forceful or so pow- 
erful as was the sermon' of his life

and his works. Above all other 
men that I have ever known he ad- 
hered to the very letter of the law 
of the gospel. With him there was 
no deviation from truth. As has 
been well said, he could never com- 
promise with sin in the least de- 
gree, and yet he was possessed of 
that marvelous faculty of being 
kind and considerate and compas- 
sionate with the sinner, but uncom- 
promising and intolerant with and 
of the sin. He would never deviate 
from the strict path of righteous- 
ness. And yet to those who had 
sinned, he held out more of hope 
and mercy, of encouragement in 
repentance, more of kindness, more 
of sympathy and true love than 
most any other man I have ever 
known. 

President Smith possessed that 
rare combination of upholding all 
the laws and standards of the 
Church and of the gospel, and at 
the same time extending the hand 
of helpfulness to those who needed 
help. Such were his remarkable 
traits of character that he was in- 
deed a friend to every man, and a 
truer, a juster, a kinder man, and 
more considerate friend, has never 
graced this earth than our late 
President. His friendship was of 
that fine quality that always led his 
friends up, and never under any 
circumstances encouraged them to 
do that which was not in accord- 
ance with the truth and the law of 
the Church and the gospel. Every 
man who really knew him, loved 
him. Those who did not know him 
came \o love him as they became 
more intimate with his real motives, 
and as they understood better the 
high principles for which he con- 
stantly stood. I believe that Goa 
so mixed up the elements in him 
that he was able to stand all of the 



temptations, all of the distresses, 
all of the sorrows and joys of life 
in a manner that has no parallel 
among our generation. 

Bishop Nibley, I think it wa«, 
standing at his grave, said he was 
the greatest man in the world. I be- 
lieve that he was. I be- 
lieve that from every standpoint 
he came more nearly measuring up 
to the stature of a man made in the 
image of God than any other man 
on God's footstool. It means a 
great deal to us. I recognize the 
fact that in our admiration and love 
we are apt to be extravagant in our 
praise and in our tribute, but 1 
think that it is only the truth to say 
that there are no greater men than 
our late beloved President Joseph 
F. Smith. 

I care not from what angle you 
view his life. If you will consider 
his life and his public career, as a 
public teacher of the people, as a 
servant in the cause of humanity, 
there are but few who could equal 
the record of service that he has 
made. Indeed, so devotedly did he 
work for the welfare of the state, 
for the welfare and the uplift of his 
people that during the greater poi- 
tion.of his life he gave his whole 
effort to the good of the common 
cause. 

I think it was President Grant 
who said the other day that not un- 
til long after he had been made the 
President of the Church did he 
ever occupy any business positions 
that brought personal emolument 
to him. All that he had and all 
that he was he gave to the people. 
He believed in service. He believed 
in that devoted service which gives 
one's whole life to the people and so 
he gave his life. He was the great- 
est of all public servants in this, that 
he served the souls of men. He • 



56 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



sought to raise the standard of liv- 
ing. He sought to impress the 
glorious principles of the gospel of 
truth on the lives of men and wo- 
men, to raise their standards of life 
and to enable them to conform their 
lives with the principles of the gos- 
pel ; and all that he could do for 
this cause he did do. No man could 
do more. 

As a father and a husband, as 
Brother Lyman has just remarked, 
he had but few if any equals in the 
history of all time. I have had the 
opportunity of being somewhat inti- 
mate in his homes, and know some- 
thing of the love which he ha' 1 ior 
his wives and his children. I have 
seen the expression of that love !n 
his homes, and have seen the love 
that he gave reciprocated in tht 
hearts and the actions of those who 
loved him. Indeed, I never knew a 
man who had a stronger love tor 
his home than did the President, 
and I never knew a man whose fam- 
ily loved him more than did his 
wives and his children. I have seen 
him go about among his homes, and 
he had a large family as you know, 
when at the close of a day his pow- 
ers were well nigh exhausted, 
when he had worked from early 
morning until late at night, go from 
home to home to plant the loving 
kiss of a father upon his children 
and his wives in recognition of the 
great love that he bore them. And 
this love was the bond that bouna 
them to him and to each other ; ana 
I think it may well be said in trutn 
and with propriety that there are no 
finer families in all the land than 
the large, splendid family of Joseph 
F. Smith. 

He was a home builder. In this 
respect as in other respects he has 
set a glorious example to the world. 
He has taught that good homes are 



at the foundation of all that is best 
in life ; that the nation itself can 
never hope to accomplish and 
achieve its great destiny unless the 
homes of the people are right ; that 
the home is the foundation of so- 
ciety ; and he set the example by 
making a home from which gooa 
citizens came, from which Latter- 
day Saints came, where could be 
found always the spirit of the gos- 
pel, and wherein are taught the 
things of God, and wherein are 
oracticed deeds of righteousness. 
So that in his public life and in his 
private life he was the great exem- 
plar of the truth of the principles 
of the o"osrel of Jesus Christ. He 
vitalized those principles, by living 
them. He made it plain for men 
and for women, that they can live 
the principles of the gospel individ- 
ually. He taught them that the 
beauties and the glories of the king- 
dom of God are to be ha'l by those 
who will conform their lives to the 
commandments. 

As an advocate of truth, it has 
been well said President Joseph .F. 
Smith was well nigh without an 
equal. As a preacher of righteous- 
ness he held first place among us. 
His burning words have entered 
the hearts of those who have saf 
under his voice and have stimulated 
them to higher deeds and to better 
Ihes. Why, -I have heard his voice 
ring out under the inspiration' ol 
God, in those majestic tones of his, 
in such a manner as to fairly raise 
the audience from their seats. You 
could well imagine men and women 
rising to their feet as he expounded 
the glories of the kingdom and cry, 
"Glory to God" for the way in 
which he expounded the principles 
of the gospel of Jesus Christ. 

He was not a learned man in the 
ordinary acceptation of that term. 



ELDER STEPHEN L. RICHARDS

He had not attended schools and 
colleges and universities, but he 
was learned in the great school of 
experience. He was truly edu- 
cated. All the latent faculties that 
God had given to him had been 
•developed and had been augmented 
until they had reached the very 
full measure of their power, and 
that is real education. That is real 
training. He was truly cultured, 
truly refined, a gentleman of the 
hiehest type and order. All his 
thoughts and his s.oeech and his 
life were clean and wholesome and 
u pi if tine. 

I think perhaps one of the pre- 
dominant traits of his life was his 
absolute cleanliness. He was clean 

bpflv. he was clean in mind, and 
he was clean and pure in his soul. 
The strength of being clean was his. 

vielded obedience to the laws 
of the g-osnel which require men to 
^e clean and pure. He never took 

i"to his bpdv pnvthin " thflt would 

pollute it, anything that would dese- 
crate it. He was the most force- 
ful of all the teachers of the Worn 
of Wisdom, because he lived the 
law a)] his life to the verv lettd, 
and his family lived it. He taught 
it. He abhored things that were 
impure and obnoxious to the body. 
He believed that the tabernacles 
which Go r ' has given us in which 
to house these God-given spirits of 
ours were sacred . in the ' sight of 
God, and he would no more have 
desecrated his body than he would 
have desecrated the temple of the 
Most High. "Such was his faith, 
and such his belief in this divinely 
given body of ours. I remember 
how he abhored the filthy habits of 
drinking and of smoking, or any of 
the habits which did not conform 
to the laws of the gospel. I remem- 
ber how he inveighed against them, 



and yet he loved men and women. 
And while at times he may have 
seemed harsh in. the condemnation 
of^hese practices and in the con- 
demnation of those, too, who per- 
sisted in the practice of these things, 
he loved men and women with his 
whole soul. He would strive for 
them. He would pray for 
them. He would recall them from 
their sins and their troubles if he 
could. I know of no man who 
would have gone farther than he 
to have reclaimed one who had fal- 
len. Such were his remarkable 
characteristics that he seemed 
friend to everybody at all times. I 
know that throughout his whole lile 
he was pure and immaculate from 
sin, a"d iust as freely yielded obedi- 
ence to all the laws of the gospel, 
just so freely did God give to him 
""wer. Just so did God magnify 
hi"i and make him great and 
miehtv, giving him a power that 
has scarcelv been known among our 
own people as among any other peo- 
ple, to draw men to him and to im- 
press them with the greatness ot 
the principles and doctrines of the 
~ocn e ] which he so perfectly lived. 

I want to say, my brethren and 
sisters, that T am indebted to Presi- 
dent Toseph F. Smith for the best 
ideals in mv life. I am indebted 
to him in large measure for my 
"■equine love of the truth. I have 
taken the best course, that is, the 
best course that I have taken, in 
large measure because of the splen- 
did example that he set. Never did 
he meet me and shake my hand 
without thrilling me with his own 
goodness and with the desire to try 
to emulate, .in small measure at 
least, the splendid example that he 
set. Never have I seen his venera- 
ble face without being encouraged 
in the work of God. Never have

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



I heard him announce the great 
truths of the gospel without being 
built up in my most holy faith. I 
don't know how I* can hope to pay 
the debt that I owe to him, unless 
it be, perchance, to try to do the 
work that he loved so well and to 
which he gave his life and his all. 
I don't know how I can ever in any 
measure repay him for the influ- 
ence which he has had upon my life, 
unless it be by doing the things that 
he called me to do, and by attempt- 
ing to serve in my weak way in the 
same manner in which he served in 
his most efficient way. 

I loved him as a son loves a 
father. I was present at his home 
the day that he died, or at least the 
night before. I remember shaking 
hands with him, and saying what 
I felt must be my last goodbye to 
him. As I shook his hand he drew 
me to him, and he planted upon my 
lips a kiss that I can never forget. 
I shall try as long as the memory 
of that embrace remains with me to 
live true to the great principles 
which he so loved, ana while I can- 
not do one single thing to help him, 
while I cannot do one single thing 
to add to his ' greatness or to the 
love which you bore for him, all 
that I can do is to dedicate and con- 
secrate my life, my service, what- 
ever talent God has given me, it> 
the great cause which he loved and 
for which he gave his noble life. 

If he has helped you, my breth- 
ren and sisters, as he has helped me, 
will you not join with me in the 
very high resolve to dedicate our 
lives and our services to the gos- 
pel of Jesus Christ, to uphold the 
high" standards that he upheld, and 
to the very close of our days to love 
God as he loved God, to be parents 
such as was he, and to love human- 
ity with that same tender devotion 



and love that he exhibited toward 
all men? To this end, my brethren 
and sisters, may we devote our- 
selves, lending all our might, our 
strength and the best that is within 
us, I humbly pray God, in the name 
of Jesus Christ. Amen.

No chance in the call of President 
Joseph F. Smith — One of the real 
apostles of the Lord Jesus Christ — 
The living embodiment of the truth 
that schools and colleges 'do not 
make the scholar — A missionary 
from boyhood and a missionary to- 
day. 

"Now the Lord had shown unto 
me, Abraham, the intelligences that 
were organized before the world 
was,-and among all these there were 
many of the noble and great ones. 
And God saw these souls, that they 
were good ; and he stood in the 
midst of them, and he said, These I 
will make my rulers. For he stood 
among those that were spirits, and 
he saw that they were good ; and he 
said unto me, Abraham, thou art 
one of them, thou wast chosen be- 
fore thou wast born." 

If you will substitute the name of 
our modern prophet for the ancient 
patriarch, you will nave a concep- 
tion of my firm belief as to the pri- 
meval state and the ante-mortal ex- 
istence of President Joseph F. 
Smith. There was no chance in his 
call. The barefoot boy, the 15 year 
old missionary on the islands of the 
sea, the more experienced and ma- 
ture proclaimer of the gospel in this 
and in distant lands, each was the 
prophet in the making, the leader 
school, the ruler in preparation. • 

We do but honor ourselves in 
thus assembling to pay tribute to his 
memory. Do you think that our 
feeble words can alter his status? 



ELDER JAMES E. TALMAGE

Do you think that this memorial ser- 
vice is held for him? I pray you 
consider. He could withstand such 
inexcusable forgetfulness on our 
part as would have been manifest in 
letting the occasion pass unmarked ; 
but we cannot do it, for our own 
self-respect ; nor could we quell the 
desire in our heart, springing from 
the well of living water and gen- 
uine love for our dear departed 
brother and leader, to permit the 
time to pass without some expres- 
sion from us as to the lessons he 
has taught, fie was a man such 
as the prophets foresaw and whom 
they foretold. 

In the inspired writing of the 
Scripture of these days, days of 
fulness, days of relative finality, the 
days immediately preceding the 
coming of Christ the Lord, tell of 
the spirit of hatred that would be 
abroad. ' They tell of the confusion 
that would be rife ; thev tell of the 
blessings that God would give unto 
the world ; and chief among these 
was the blessing of real men. Don't 
you remember His promise. "Be- 
hold I will make a man more 
precious than fine gold, even a man 
than the golden wedge of Ophir." 
Such gift found a realization in 
the nerson and ministry of Presi- 
\ dent Joseph F. Smith. No man can 
ever take his place. Thece is a 
uniqueness about the real prophet, 
the prophet of God. He has no 
successor, and by the same rule he 
had no predecessor. True, other 
men may have filled the office that 
this one filled, as other men shall 
fill the place after he departs ; but 
there is a distinctiveness about each 
of God's leaders that makes his 
place sacred. And yet shall there 
be other crochets in Zion as there 
have been miehtv ones in the past ; 
but no one has filled the place of 



the other. Without the special min- 
istry of President Joseph F. Smith, 
the Church of Jesus Christ of Lat- 
ter-day Saints could not be, and 
therefore would not be, what- it is 
today. He was foreappointed and 
foreordained for the particular 
work of his epoch, of the work and 
ministry. 

I shall not repeat the many things 
in the way of personal experiences 
with President Joseph F. Smith 
that make me sure he was the great 
man we have had portrayed before 
us ; but I do bear witness to you 
that Joseph F. Smith was one of the 
real apostles of the Lord Jesus 
Christ. I have listened to his ring- 
ing words of testimony and warn- 
ing before the assemblies of thou- 
sands, and I have sat with him, on 
very rare occasions, alone ; and on 
occasions less rare, but still not com- 
mon, with my brethren and asso- 
ciates, I have heard him preach in 
conversation, and I have never seen 
his face so enlightened nor his 
frame so thrilled with power as 
when he was bearing testimony , of 
the Christ. He seemed to me to 
know Jesus Christ as a man knows 
his friend. 

President Joseph F. Smith has 
been referred to on many an -occa- 
sion as one of the last links con- 
necting the present generation with 
that of the early days of the 
Church. But though that speaks 
of the long ago when measured in 
terms of years, did you ever think 
of the marvellous fact that Presi- 
dent Joseph F. Smith was always 
fully abreast of the times ? He was 
never behind, but always up to date, 
and down to date, in everything 
that was good. There was no cling- 
ing to old fashioned methods when 
better means had been evolved and 
proved practical with him. Scores

of times before he passed away I 
said, as now I shall venture to say 
again, he was the living embodi- 
ment of the truth that schools and 
colleges do not make the scholar 
To me he was one of the best read 
men with whom I have had <to do 
and deal. Did you ever hear him 
use faulty language, poor English? 
He was no orator, and I am glad 
of it, for to him oratory and all 
associated with the name bore the 
tinge of bombast and verbal dis- 
play, and he did not know how to 
talk in painted color pictures ; burt 
he possessed that gift which is as 
far above oratory as prophecy is 
above necromancy, the gift of elo- 
quence. He did not speak to the 
ears, but right straight to the 
hearts of men. 

Well, where is he now? He was 
permitted shortly before his pass- 
ing to have a glimpse into the here- 
after, and to learn where he would 
soon be at work. He was a preacher 
of righteousness on earth, he is a 
preacher of righfteousness today. 
He was a missionary from his boy- 
hood up, and he is a missionary to- 
day amongst those who have not 
yet heard the gospel, though they 
have passed from mortality into the 
spirit world. I cannot conceive of 
him as otherwise than busily en- 
gaged in the work of 'the Master. 
And had any one tried, or should 
any one now try to distract his at- 
tention and lead him into other 
paths, he could answer without sac- 
' rilege in the very words of the Mas- 
ter: Wis<t ye not that I must be 
about my Father's business, who is 
in heaven. 

The Lord enable Us to be in a 
measure like unto him, fit to take 
his hand and deserving of a smile 
from his countenance when we shall 
meet him again, I pray, in the 



name of the Lord, Jesus Christ. 
Amen.

the spirit of this morning's meet- 
ing, the meetings this afternoon 
will be devoted in further tribute 
to the memory of our late de-

parted leader, President Joseph F. 
Smith. 

I take pleasure in introducing 
to you a man whom you all well 
know, Bishop Charles W. Nibley. 
Perhaps no man in the Church 
knew President Smith better, was 
more intimately acquainted with 
him, than was our worthy bishop, 
who will now address us. 

ELDER CHARLES W. NIBLEY 

(Presiding Bishop of the Church.) 

I am asked to perform what to 
me is a rather difficult task, at this 
memorial service for the late Presi- 
dent Joseph F. Smith. I knew him 
very intimately. Forty-two years 
ago, when I was a young man, he 
called me to go with him to Liver- 
pool, England, there to take charge 
under his direction, of the business 
affairs of the European mission. 
From that day until the day of 
his death, I knew him well. I 
know his history, I know his fam- 
ily, I have lived in his home — been, 
indeed, as a member ot his family ; 
and so I can speak of him as I 
know him. 

Joseph F. Smith was one man 
picked out of millions of men. There 
was none like him. In his particu- 
lar .sphere, in his life and his life's 
•work, I think that as an exemplar 
he has never been equalled. I 
know that is high praise, and I do 
not wish to make any comparisons 
with others, but to me he was the 
most God-like, the most God-fear- 
ing, and the least man-fearing of 
any man I ever knew in all my 
days. 

He had a perfect knowledge of 
the truth of this great Latter-day 
work. He had endured much for 
it, he had sacrificed much — losing 



his father when he was not yet six 
years of age, losing his mother 
when he was twelve or thirteen 
years of age, going alone, so to 
speak, in the world, with only 
friends who knew his father and 
mother to look after him. Presi- 
dent Young took him under his 
care, or at least had a watchful 
eye over him; and in early days, 
as you know, sent him on a mission 
to the Sandwich Isfands, when the 
boy was but fifteen years of age. 

I have heard him tell how, 
journeying down through the 
southern country to Los Angeles, 
they were followed by a band of 
hungry Indians — this little mis- 
sionary party, among whom were 
John T. Caine, who used to repre- 
sent us in Congress, William W. 
Cluff, and some fifteen others. 
They were down, on the desert, this 
side of Los Vegas, and- these In- 
dians became a little troublesome. 
Joseph F. Smith and one other of 
the party — I forget who, were a 
little slow in getting their horses 
saddled, and the others of the com- 
pany rode off or drove off, leav- 
ing these two behind. The Indians 
became more bold when the larger 
part of the company went on, and 
as President Smith was saddling 
his horse, pulling up the strap, he 
looked into the barrel of his own 
gun. An Indian had grabbed his 
gun from the saddle and pointed it 
at him. The boy, who was strong 
and an athlete, smiled merely; but 
quickly getting under his horse's 
neck, he grabbed that Indian, who 
pretended at first to play, and in 
the tussle, wrenched the rifle from 
his hands. 

I mention this to show the fear- 
lessness of the youth. I never 
knew as brave a man. No num- 
ber of men could daunt him or dis-

courage him or put him down. If 
he knew he was right he stood be- 
fore the whole world and sustained 
and manfully contended for the 
right as he understood it. 

On this mission to the Sandwich 
Island, he encountered severe 
hardships. I remember on our first 
trip over to the Islands, and I was 
over there on four trips with him, 
that sailing among the different 
small islands, he would point out 
to me such and such a place : 
"There is where I lived so long in 
a little straw hut" — which burned 
down or which was destroyed by 
flood. Here was another place 
where he had lain sick and where 
the good Hawaiian people had 
ministered to him. This experi- 
ence, and the other, he would tell 
as we journeyed along, all of 
which, if I had time to relate, are 
faith-promoting and inspiring, and 
would point out to you the manli- 
ness of the young boy — -for he 
was then, as I told you, fifteen or 
sixteen years of age. 

He remained there on the Islands 
until he was nineteen years of age, 
when he returned home at the call 
of President Brigham Young, at 
the time of the move south and 
when Johnston's army was march- 
ing here for the avowed purpose 
of disturbing the Latter-day 
Saints. 

On a later occasion, when we 
arrived at the harbor of Honolulu, 
we were met by the Royal Hawai- 
ian Band. This band was instructed 
to come up to the "Mormon" meet- 
ing house — a quite prominent 
place in the city of Honolulu, and 
play for the people in honor of 
President Smith and his company. 
In the midst of the proceedings, 
after we were gathered in the 
meeting house and President Smith 



was conversing in the native 
tongue with this one and the other 
one, and shaking hands with all, 
there was led into the room an old 
Hawaiian lady, tottering, blind — 
led because she could not see. The 
moment he saw her he turned from 
everyone else and rushed to this 
dear old native lady. She was cal- 
ling "Iosepa, Iosepa" — Joseph, 
Joseph, her Joseph. He rushed to 
her and gathered her in his arms, 
and with tears streaming down his 
cheeks, said : "My mamma, my 
mamma, my dear old mamma." 
And he turned to me, wiping his 
cheeks, and sai'rl. "Charlie, she 
tended me while I was sick, more 
than fifty years ago, and here she 
is now ; should I not bless her and 
love her?" 

From courage to tenderness— 
for the bravest are the tenderest 
always — what nobleness- and grand- 
eur of character may we not ex- 
pect between these two angles. 

In the maintaining and rearing 
of a large family you all know 
what manner of a man he was. A 
man is known by the work he per- 
forms, by the labor he does. Give 
him the opportunity and we will see 
what he can do with it. If he does 
his best, well and good. Joseph F. 
Smith always did his be-t. He was 
just in his family. He was the 
kindest man I ever knew, and the 
tenderest, most loving and compas- 
sionate to little children. I have 
seen him when one of his little bab- 
ies was sick, walk the floor at night 
for hours together with that babe 
in his arms, tenderly caring for it 
and nursing it — caring for it better, 
I think, than I ever saw any mother 
care for her child, so tender was 
he, so loving, so pitiful, so compas- 
sionate. 

He was a man, take him for a'l in

all. I do not know where yon will 
ever see his like again. You can 
imagine, from the association I 
was privileged to have with Presi- 
dent Joseph F. Smith, especially 
during the later years of his life — - 
and indeed for more than forty 
years of his life — what the loss of 
him means to me. I feel at times 
alone. 

As President Grant said this 
morning in the Tabernacle, no two 
preachers of righteousness like him 
and his son, Hyrum M., has this 
Church ever produced. I endorse 
that sentiment. 

He was a manly man, a man of 
God, a man whom it was an honor 
to know and a pleasure to be with, 
a man whose example has meant 
much to me — and indeed, had it not 
been for him, I know that I could 
not have accomplished what little I 
may have done in this world. In a 
way he was my guiding star. I did 
not worship him — I worship only 
God, and that I try to do faithfully 
— but he was more like unto God, 
the mo.st godlike man that I ever 
knew in all my life. 

Such is my testimony concerning 
Joseph F. Smith. I love his mem- 
ory. I revere his name.- There is 
not anything I would not do for 
him or his, that I possibly could do. 
And loving him and his, so likewise 
I try to love my brethren and sis- 
ters, with the same spirit that he 
love'1 the brethren and sisters of 
this Church, and the people of the 
world as well — for he was not nar- 
row. 

Some people have thought 
Joseph F. Smith was a narrow- 
minded man. His comprehension 
and vision were the broadest, most 
extended, most glorious, of any 
man's I have ever known. He 
could grasp and comprehend futur-. 



ity. He finew what was in store 
for those who served God and kept 
his commandments. He knew the 
principles of the gospel. They were 
so thoroughly imbued and indoc- 
trinated in him that they were a 
part of his very being. It was 
natural for him to be a Latter-day 
Saint, and he was willing to sacri- 
fice for the work, and he did sacri- 
fice. Without father, without 
mother, alone, he sacrificed as much 
as the Lord required of him. 

Let me beseech you, my breth- 
ren and sisters, that we get some 
of the spirit of sacrifice in our 
hearts, that we, too, may be will- 
ing, and may say before God : "I'll 
go where you want me to go, dear 
Lord ; I'll work where you want me 
to work; I'll try to be what you 
want me to be." 

If we have this in our hearts, 
we will grow in some humble way, 
at least, in small degree, to be like 
this the noblest of men whom I 
have ever known, Joseph F. Smith. 

ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD 

Although we have lost our be- 
loved leader, we rejoice that he has 
left with us an illustrious poster- 
ity. We feel grateful that the chil- 
dren of President Smith are follow- 
ing in his footsteps, and I take 
pleasure in introducing one of his 
worthy sons, Bishop David A. 
Smith, of the Presiding Bishopric, 
who will now address us. 

ELDER DAVID A. SMITH 

(Of the Presiding Bishopric.) 

My brethren and sisters. — When 
I look over this assembly and think 
of the thousands of Latter-day 
Saints who are meeting in the As- 
sembly Hall and in the Tabernacle, 



64 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



my heart ig filled with joy; yet I 
cannot approach this task at rib's 
time without a feeling of sadness. 
All my life, I have known Presi- 
dent Joseph F. Smith. As a little 
fellow, I only saw him accasionally, 
and knew him best through the let- 
ters he wrote to me, as it was his 
custom to write personal letters to 
his children when absent from 
home And during my early child- 
hood he was away from home on 
missions most of the time. Bui 
when at home, no father ever took 
more pleasure or greater delight in 
his children than he did. 

I remember when Bishop Nibley, 
as he has said, made it a custom to 
call at our home occasionally. He 
was almost as much a father to us 
as our own father, and we learned 
to call him Uncle Charlie. I did not 
know for many years that Charles 
W". Nibley was not my own uncle. 

For over eleven years it has been 
my privilege to be nearer, closer to 
President Joseph F. Smith, I be- 
lieve, than any other man. Morn- 
ing, noon, and night, I have been 
with him. Having been honored 
by him, having been trusted with 
many of his private affairs, being 
urged on by Bishop Nibley, who 
loved him and knew what work he 
was doing, I was finally given much 
of his private work to do. And 
when, today, in coming to this con- 
ference, I recall the fact that never 
before for over eleven years had 
he attended a general conference 
on this block that it was not my 
privilege to accompany him here 
and home again, you can, there- 
fore, imagine to a small degree at 
least, the reason for that feeling 
of sorrow which comes to me at this 
time, for I loved him and miss him 
greatly. 

It is not because he loved me 



more than he did other of his boys 
that I was with him perhaps more 
than they, for President Smith haa 
no favorites. It could not honestly 
be said of him that he loved one 
boy more than he loved another, o r 
that he loved one of his girls more 
than he loved another, or that he 
loved one of his wives more than 
he loved another. As Bishop Nib- 
ley has said, President Smith was 
a just man, and he loved his wive? 
and he loved his children, and tried 
to treat them as wives should be 
treated and as children should be 
treated — no favorites among them, 
and they loved him and tried to 
honor him. I was greatly honored, 
and more so than some of the 
others, because of tne position I 
had been blessed with, which gave 
to me a greater degree of freedom, 
which permitted -me to associate 
with him more and to assume part 
of his responsibilities, which would 
gladly have been assumed by any 
one of his children had any one of 
the others been placed in the same 
position and given the same oppor- 
tunity. • 

I rejoice, my brethren and sis- 
ters, today, in the fact that I had 
such a father. And O, I pray God 
that I shall prove worthy of such 
parentage. Think of the honor 
that has come to me : honored by 
you, my brethren and my sisters ; 
honored of God, having been per- 
mitted to come through this line- 
age which has been so blessed of 
him. O, I am grateful for the 
blessings I have received, the bless- 
ings that I do receive from day to 
day, and I want to live worthy of 
the confidence that has been placed 
in me by you and by this people. I 
want to serve the Lord that I will 
be entitled to his blessings. 

When I look over the congrega- 



ELDER DAVID A. SMITH

tions of the Saints in their confer- 
ences, when I am permitted to 
meet with you in your homes and in 
your meetinghouses. I rejoice in 
that privilege, because there I al- 
ways find the Spirit of the Lord. 
I feel it. * I come away filled with 
it; it is that same influence that 
has caused you to come here today 
and stand for two hours ; that which 
has caused .others to crowd into the 
buildings, and what for? To hear 
the word of God, for we are seek- 
ing knowledge and strength that 
we may better serve the Lord. We 
know that just so far as we have in 
our hearts a desire to learn of his 
will, we are blessed and strength- 
ened and are better able to carry 
on the work and the responsibility 
that rests upon us as Latter-day 
Saints, and I pray sincerely that 1 
may have an interest in your pray- 
ers, in your faith, the sustaining in- 
fluence of which will enable me to 
do that which is required of me, 
that I may better uphold and emu- 
late the noble example which has 
been set me by my beloved father. 

May God bless us all is my prayer, 
and I ask it in the name of Jesus. ■ 
Amen. 

ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD 

We have another long-time as- 
sociate of President Smith with us 
in Bishop John Wells, of the Pre- 
siding Bishopric of the Church, 
who will, now address us. 

ELDER JOHN WELLS 

(Of the Presiding Bishopric.) 

I hope I shall be able to make 
myself heard to this large circle of 
'my brethren and sisters who have 
gathered about this building this 
afternoon. 

I am thankful to the Lord foi 



the gospel of Jesus Christ and ioi 
all that it has .done for me. I ap- 
preciate sincerely my membership 
in the Church as a Latter-day 
Saint. Many honors and privil- 
eges have come to me through my 
associations with my brethren and 
sisters. I am thankful, I am grate- 
ful, to be associated with the good 
men who preside -in this Church. 
They are men after God's own 
heart ; men who are full of faith 
and integrity and who have set mt 
a splendid example; men who are 
willing to do everything within 
their power to serve God and to 
bring about his purposes on the 
earth. The Lord has establishea 
this great Latter-day work. It *3 
a marvelous work and a wonder, 
wherein the wisdom of the worldly 
wise shall perish and the under- 
standing of the prudent shall come 
l to naught. It is only upon this idea 
that we grasp or understand the 
magnitude of the work that the 
Lord has established in these lat- 
ter days, so that he may bring 
about the gathering of the House 
of Israel and the establishment of 
his kingdom upon the earth. 

It has been my pleasure ano 
privilege, as an officer and an em- 
ployee of the Church, to become 
personally acquainted with the late 
President Joseph F. Smith. I re- 
member him well, from the year 
1893, when I was an employee in 
the Presiding Bishop's Office. 1 
called upon him for counsel, many 
of the leading brethren being away, 
and some of the duties of the Pre- 
siding Bishop's Office had at that 
time devolved upon me.. I waited 
upon President Smith and asked his 
counsel and advice concerning what 
to me was a very intricate problem, 
and my first impression of Presv 
dent Smith was that he was sound 



66 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



in judgment, and had a wonderful 
comprehension of human nature. 
It was my first interview with him, 
and we sat side by side talking on 
the problem I presented to him. 
I had looked upon him previous to 
this as a great man because of his 
exalted position as one of the First 
Presidency, but when I had con- 
cluded that interview, I had a more 
profound impression of his great- 
ness than ever before. 

At one time I was coming across, 
the continent. I met President 
Smith and some of his family at 
Omaha. We traveled westward in 
the same car. I was sick with 
something akin to sea-sickness, 
caused through traveling several 
days on the train. I appreciated 
his kindly sympathy. He blessed 
me, and that blessing I will never 
forget, because it came from the 
Prophet of the Lord and his bless- 
ing gave me peace and rest for most 
of the night. That same night, as 
the train was moving across tilt, 
plains of Wyoming, President 
Smith stood at the back of the car 
taking a rest from a long, tedious 
clay's journey. Any of you who 
have traveled day after day in a 
railway train know what relief it is 
to stand up or move around for 
awhile. I tell you this incident to 
show you how President Smith 
was susceptible to the Still Small 
Voice. While standing at the back 
of the train he heard a voice tell- 
ing him to go into the car, and he 
did so. Later he was walking up 
and down the corridor and was told 
by the same Voice to sit down. Pie 
did so. A few moments later the 
engine ran off the track and tilted 
the train on an angle which scared 
us all. Had President Smith been 
in the back of the train or walking 
in the corridor he might have been 



very seriously injured, but the Lord 
had regard for him and he was 
prompted by a Voice which he un- 
derstood so well, and he acted ac- 
cordingly. President Smith has 
always been susceptible to the in- 
fluence of the Spirit of the Lord. 
He knew its promptings, and what 
they meant. As he heard the Still 
Small Voice directing him and in- 
spiring him, he knew . that Voice 
and knew it well. 

President Smith was a kind man, 
kind to employees as well as to his 
friends and family. He frequently 
gathered the employees of the 
Bishop's Office at the Beehive 
House and other places, and 
mingled with them in social gath- 
erings, showing that even with the 
dignity of his position and calling 
he was always the same unaffected 
and kindly-disposed man. 

I revere his memory. I revere 
him for many things. I will nevei 
forget as long as I live the blessing 
he gave to me when he ordained 
me a bishop. I never want to for- 
get those sweet, kindly words, trie 
admonition and counsel that he 
gave to me before I assumed my 
duties as a counselor to Bishop 
Charles W. Nibley. 

I feel today that if he were here 
and could tell us what he would likt 
us to do, he would say, brethren 
and sisters, roll on thi.s great work, 
be prepared to carry the message of 
the gospel to the nations of the 
earth who are now being liberated , 
sustain the presiding brethren of 
this Church, whom the Lord has 
sent to preside in the various quo- 
rums and departments, sustain them 
with all your might, mind and 
strength, and help them to bring 
about and accomplish the purposes 
that God has designed to accom- 
plish in these latter days. 



ELDER JOHN WELLS

I sincerely pray, my brethren and 
sisters, that the spirit of this great 
latter day work may be in our 
hearts, that we may pray for the 
spirit of it ; exercise our office and 
calling, that we may never be 
ashamed of the gospel of Jesus 
Christ, for it is the power of Goa 
unto salvation to those who receive 
it. 

May God add his blessings, I 
pray in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen.

ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD 

The choice of President Smith as 
leader of the Church a remarkable 
evidence of the truthfulness of the 
work — Testimony of his noble char- 
acter and work — The tremendous 
influence of two mothers contrasted 
■ — The mantle of President Smith 
has fallen upon President Grant. 

There is no task that I have been 
asked to perform which gives me 
greater pleasure and more real hap- 
piness than on this memorial day 
to speak of our late beloved proph- 
et-leader, President Joseph F. 
Smith, whom, like my brethren who 
have preceded me, I love with thai 
same love and affection I had for 
my own father — for he was a 
father to .me and to every man and 
woman who became acquainted 
with him who loved the Lord and 
sought to keep his commandments. 
I bear witness that President Smith 
was a lover of such men and wo- 
men. 

The .selection of President Smith 
to. preside over this Church, as in 
the case of his predecessors, is one 
of the remarkable evidences of the 
truthfulness of the work called 
"Mormonism," that God is in it, 



that his hand has been over this 
work and guiding the destinies of 
this Church, and he is indeed the 
source from which light and truth 
and knowledge have come to the 
men who- have directed the affairs 
of this Church. 

I recall many years ago being in 
the city of Nauvoo, attending a 
celebration of newspaper men of 
the state of Illinois, in that city. 
The representative of one of the 
leading newspapers of that stau 
was giving the history of the city 
of Nauvoo. He told of its growth 
until it became a city of twenty 
thousand people when Chicago was 
only a small village and St. Louis 
on the south was only a trading 
post. He told of the prejudice that 
inspired the hearts of those who 
drove the Latter-day Saints from 
Nauvoo, and how Nauvoo had gone 
down until it had but twelve hun- 
dred souls and not a railroad yet. 
He told of the vandalism that 
prompted the burning of the Nau- 
voo temple, and that even while 
the blackened walls of that temple 
stood, the steamboats stood half a 
day at the wharf to allow passen- 
gers to come and view its ruins. 
And then he told of the travels of 
the Latter-day Saints in their pil- 
grimage across the plains to these 
valleys of the mountains, how they 
had made the desert to blossom as 
the rose; and said, "Maybe God 
likes the 'Mormons' better than he 
does bigots and vandals, if not, why 
doesn't he give the inhabitants of 
Nauvoo better evidence that it was 
all right to drive the 'Mormons' 
out?" 

I felt as I listened to his uttei- 
ances, that any man who would fol- 
low this Church, and become 
acquainted with its leaders must be 
blind indeed if he cannot see that 



68 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



a power greater than man's has at- 
tended it and the men who have led 
and directed it. 

From the days of the Prophet 
Joseph Smith until this hour, I feel 
there are evidences of the wisdom 
of an allwise and overruling Provi- 
dence in the selection of the men 
who have stood at the head of this 
Church, and it is manifest in the 
result of their administrations. 
Where could we have found a man 
like unto the Prophet Joseph Smith, 
who could have done the work- that 
the Prophet did in receiving the 
revelations of God — naturally a 
spiritually minded man, a prophet 
selected from beforehand, even as 
in ancient days. 

It might also be said of each one 
of these men down to the present 
prophet of, the Lord, Heber J. 
Grant, ordained prophets before 
they came into the world; God 
knew them ; he selected them for 
their hour and for their time, took 
them through a schooling of experi- 
ence, of trial and hardship and 
preparation, each to be his mouth- 
piece to reveal the truths of the 
everlasting gospel, the organiza- 
tion of the Church, the doctrines of 
the Church, as in the case of the 
Prophet Joseph ; or his prophei- 
leader, Brigham Young, whom he 
had in schooling, as we heard this 
morning, and in training and prep- 
aration to accomplish the great pil- 
grimage of the Latter-day Saints 
into these valleys of the mountains ; 
and likewise the men whom Goq 
raised up thereafter, each in his 
turn the man for the hour, and 
the Lord was with him, and the 
Lord has been with our late Presi- 
dent Joseph F. Smith — we are all 
witnesses to that. 

I recall my early recollections of 
President Smith with a good deal 



of pleasure — because I admired 
him, he was to me my ideal, I tried 
in my life, as I became acquainted 
with him, to be as he was. I knew 
as a child, for the Lord revealed it 
unto me, that President Smith 
would some day preside over this 
Church ; and in connection with 
that I saw many things that Presi- 
dent Smith would do; and when, 
last October, he stood before the 
congregations of ,the Saints, feeble 
and weak as he was, my soul was 
filled with great sorrow, because I 
knew that all that the Lord had 
for President Smith to do had been 
done. That which I saw as a child 
was fulfilled, finished, completed. 
And yet there was a feeling of 
great regret that we should soon 
have to part with him and let him 
go on to the work which the Father 
has prepared him to do in that 
realm where he is now. 

It was my privilege, I presume, 
to deliver the last public address 
that President Smith ever listened 
to, being the last speaker of the 
last Conference of the Church. And 
I recall, as I had concluded, he 
grasped my hand and pressed it 
and gave me a blessing that I shall 
not forget, for my whole soul was 
thrilled with his blessing and with 
his love. / 

I bear witness that he was a man 
who loved the souls of the chil- 
dren of men in the world= — not only 
those who belong to the Church; 
for no man has done more, than 
he, looking toward the establish- 
ment of - the work of the Lord 
among the nations of the earth. He 
has builded more meeting houses 
in the mission field, and mission 
headquarters, than in the rest of 
the years of the Church put to- 
gether. His heart was in the preach- 
ing of the gospel, and ,so he lent 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD

himself to uphold and sustain those 
who were engaged in this work. 

His coming into the world was 
at a time when his own father and 
his own uncle the Prophet, were 
incarcerated in' a foul dungeon, 
with chains forged upon them by 
a blacksmith, condemned to be 
shot, confined in this condition for 
the gospel's sake, held as hostages 
for the Church, a ransom for the 
balance of the people that they 
would leave the state of Missouri ; 
the father, Hyrum, was separated 
from his beloved companion, the 
mother of Joseph F. Smith; and 
under these conditions, Joseph F. 
Smith was born into the world, 
without a father's love and protec- 
tion for the mother of the child; 
there was one occasion when the 
enemy ransacked, as they were ac- 
customed to do, the homes of the 
Latter-day Saints, and invaded the 
home of Marv Fielding Smith, the 
mother of President Joseph F. 
Smith ; and in their anxiety to fina 
treasure, tumbled bedclothes over 
and finally succeeded in almost ex- 
terminating the life of President 
Smith — for he was buried under 
bedclothing when rescued by his 
mother after the invader had left 
their home. The boy was so black 
that life was almost extinguished, 
but the hand of the Lord was over 
him; from that moment the Spirit 
of the Lord attended him in tlie 
midst of trials, in the midst of vicis- 
situdes, and has preserved his life 
marvelously to complete that which 
the Lord had in .store for him to 
do. 

And I thought of him as a child. 
How few boys would have shown 
the courage, the manhood, that he 
did, while scarcely eight years of 
age, driving a yoke of oxen part 
way across the plains, and then 



when a little over nine years 01 
age, in 1848, driving two yoke of 
oxen the entire distance from the 
Missouri river to these va'lleys of 
the mountains, taking a man's part. 
But as I have thought of ' it, I 
know what was in President 
Smith's heart. He did not take the 
credit unto himself. A very large 
part of that credit shall forever be- 
long to his illustrious mother, Mary 
Fielding Smith. He often said it, 
and I know if he were here today 
he would be delighted to have these 
words of praise spoken of that 
good woman who was his inspira- 
tion in his childhood. 

I have thought of it in connec-. 
tion with the sorrowful experiences 
that came into the life of the des- 
cendants of the Prophet Joseph 
Smith — you remember that the 
catastrophe that took away the 
Prophet Joseph Smith also endea 
the career of the Patriarch Hyrum 
Smith, the father of President 
Joseph F. Smith ; and the wives of 
these two men were shocked to be . 
thus bereaved of their support, 
their loving husbands, the fathers 
of their children ; and then the per- 
secutions did not end with the mar- 
tyrdom of Joseph and Hyrum 
Smith, but centered on the Church , 
and in those perilous times, seek- 
ing to find an asylum, a home for 
the Saints in the place appointed 
by the Lord, and unto which the 
Prophet Joseph said they would go, 
President Young started to lead the 
Latter-day Saints to these valleys 
of the mountains. I remember lis- 
tening to the testimonv of ■<>. 
daughter of Samuel H. Smith in 
the city of St. Louis, many years 
ago, to the effect that during those 
days President Young sent an in- 
vitation to Emma Smith, the wife 
of the Prophet Joseph, to furnish 



70 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



conveyance for herself and chil- 
dren, and provisions and means to 
take them to the mountains, but 
it was refused, and Emma would 
not come with the Latter-day 
Saints. But I never read in any 
of the histories where Mary Field- 
ing' Smith received such an invita- 
tion ; but rather on her own initia- 
tive this woman gathered up her 
children, made the trip .clown to 
St. Louis, purchased provisions and 
equipment, financing- herself, with 
the help of her brother and made 
the journey to these valleys of the 
mountains. Surely she had love 
and good fellowship and support 
of the brethren, but I contrast the 
action of these two women. I do 
not wish to say one disparaging 
word of Emma Smith, the wife of 
the Prophet, for she went through 
much affliction, and much did she 
do for the comfort of the Prophet 
and the building up of the work 
of God ; but the blow that fell up- 
on her in the death of her husband, 
and the weakness of the flesh ex- 
hibited in that hour, were more than 
she had the courage to endure, and 
so she faltered, she weakened, and 
fell by the wavside, and took her 
children off with her. 

I have thought of what a tre- 
mendous influence the example of 
these two mothers has had. On 
the one hand Emma has turned all 
the posterity of the Prophet 
through herself and the Prophet 
away from the Church — aliens to 
the truth that God has revealed 
and established ; while Mary Field- 
ing Smith turned at the very foun- 
tain of that stream the posterity of 
her illustrious husband, Hyrum 
Smith, into the channels of the 
Church, into the truth ; and here 
they stand a mighty host, increas- 



ing, and will continue to grow .as 
the generations come. 

When the President was taken 
away, in the imaginations of my 
own mind by the enlightenment of 
the Spirit of God that came to me, 
I saw President Joseph F. Smith 
received on the other side. Tongue 
cannot tell the joy that was in 
Hyrum Smith's heart when he re- 
ceived his beloved son, Joseph F. 
Smith. Joy beyond expression was 
in the heart of Hyrum Smith when 
his true, tried, noble, and God-fear- 
ing wife, the inspiration, the pro- 
tection of her son Joseph Fielding 
— came to him. 

I thought of it in contrast to the 
feelings of the Prophet when his 
son and his wife Emma came. His 
must have been a sorrowful greet- 
ing. 

All honor to Mary Fielding 
Smith, the mother of the boy 
Joseph F., who, in his tender years 
turned him right, led him into the 
paths of truth, started him on the 
way. And then all honor, and credit 
to the sterling character of that 
noble man of God who did follow 
the footsteps of his father and his 
mother and wavered not. 

He was not privileged to obtain 
an education like others, neverthe- 
less he was a student, and I do not 
think that a man ever preached the 
gospel of the Church of Jestu 
Christ of Latter-day Saints more 
eloquently, used better language, 
more perfect and choice and fin- 
ished, than President Joseph F. 
Smith. I remember, following an 
address he delivered in Portland 
at the dedication of our church 
several years ago, a prominent 
lawyer in Portland, himself an 
orator, said, "I have never heard a 
finer utterance from a man than 
President Smith delivered." 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD 



71 



"Why," said he, "you must be a 
lawyer, for you arranged your ar- 
gument — everything was done in 
such a logical way, most convinc- 
ing." He was an all-round edu- 
cated man. As a citizen in this 
city, he has left his mark, that will 
never be effaced. I am told that 
it was through his influence more 
than any other man's that Liberty 
Park belongs to this city. When 
he fought for that blessing to the 
people, he stood almost alone, but 
won out. 

There was a time, as President 
Grant iemarkedthis morning, when 
men doubted the financial ability of 
President Smith, schooled in pov- 
erty, knowing the burden of debt. 
Yet the Lord had prepared him to 
come into the Presidency of the 
Church during its most prosperous 
financial period, to take charge of 
the affairs when it would require 
men of great financial ability, look- 
ing at it from a human point of 
view, to succeed. But he had it — 
God-given financial ability came to 
the prophet; he had the inherent 
qualities and the willing spirit, lis- 
tened to the voice that prompted 
and directed him, so that he had to 
do with the finances of the Church 
during its most prosperous period, 
and handled, I presume, more funds 
of this Church than all the other 
presidents put together ; and the 
Lord at the same time blessed him, 
as has been remarked, to be the 
greatest preacher of righteousness 
of this dispensation. It does seem 
marvelous what the Lord has done. 
President Smith's wisdom in finan- 
cial affairs excelled all his compan- 
io"f. f^r h a was guided by the light 
of the Lord. 

Now, my brethren and sisters, I 
have no doubt but that President 
Smith is busy and active. How I 



want to live to go where he is ! I 
do not care whether the streets are 
paved with gold, whether there are 
diamonds and jasper in the walls. I 
do not care what kind of place it 
is. If I can go where President 
Smith has gone and be with him 
land men like him, it will be heaven 
to me, I want to be there. 

I realize that I cannot come there 
by wishing, but that I must follow 
the example of men like President 
Smith if I shall ever come to be 
associated with them ; and so his life 
is like an anchor sent out from that 
world to whichvhe has gone, to my 
soul, and I hope it shall be to all 
the Latter-day Saints, pulling us, 
beckoning us, calling us unto that 
realm to which he has gone, where 
he will be honored, as are those 
with whom he is associated. 

I want to say to you that this 
generation, who did not receive the 
Prophet Joseph Smith, who have 
not listened to the testimony of 
President Joseph F. Smith and the 
elders of this Church, shall yet hear 
them and honor their names and 
receive from them the message of 
the everlasting gospel in the spirit 
world, or they shall never be saved. 
God said in the beginning, that 
this generation should hear the mes- 
sage of this gospel through the men 
to whom he revealed himself. Men 
and women who die shall not see 
Peter, they shall not look upon the 
face of the Redeemer of the world, 
they shall not have . Paul to come 
and visit them ; but they shall have 
the elders of this Church, whom the 
Lord sent to them in the earth ; 
and they shall receive this gospel 
from none other, for the Lord will 
vindicate them, and he will have 
them honored. He will not dis- 
credit them. And when they go to 
the other side, we shall find stand- 



72 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



ing in places of honor; representing 
the Lord Jesus Christ, men like 
President Joseph F. Smith, who 
will be given greater authority and 
greater power than they ever had 
upon the earth. He is not shorn of 
anything because he is gone from 
this world. The place and position 
which belongs to him is one of 
greater presidency, greater influ- 
ence and power and authority than 
he has ever had in the earth ; for 
over there are countless billions of 
our Father's children who are re- 
ceiving this gospel and they shall 
come under the administration of 
the elders of the Church who have 
been faithful ; and presidency and 
power and authority shall belong 
to President Smith forever and 
ever, among the redeemed and the 
sanctified in the eternal world. 

,1 bear witness to- you that the 
mantle of the Prophet has fallen 
upon his successor, President He- 
ber J. Grant. I am a witness of 
this. I know that he is a prophet of 
the- living God, and the Lord has 
raised him up. The Lord has had 
him in schooling and in training, so 
that he will be a wise and prudent 
man, a true successor of President 
Joseph F. Smith ; and in the heart 
of President Grant is the spirit of 
humility and of faithfulness and of 
devotion to the Lord ; and the in- 
spiration of- the Lord rests upon 
him, that is my witness ; and the 
Lord will use him. He will not do 
just exactly what President Smith 
did — there was a day of material 
progress and of enlarging the 
boundaries of the Church, a time of 
material prosperity and growth for 
the Church and for the membership 
of the Church, all of which was 
right and splendid, and conducted 
successfully; but the time has come 
when the Church must also grow 



spiritually, and must return with 
greater- devotion to the standards 
of our fathers, to the true and 
livine God and the keening of the 
Word of Wisdom, in the pavment 
of our tithing, in savine our pray- 
ers, in seeking to discharge the 
great responsibility that rests uoon 
us to carry the gospel to the nations 
of the earth, and ceasing to excuse 
ourselves because we are financially 
involved or because we have been 
once — a nd sending our bovs in our 
stead. We must sro ourselves, even 
as President Smith did. He never 
stopped or hesitated or said that he 
would have to be excused because 
he was indebted, but went at each 
call: and we must get that soirit 
?eain, for the hour of preaching 
the gospel once again to the na- 
tions of the earth has come, where 
thousands will be needed to cry, 
after this dav of chastisement, re- 
pentance to the nations of the earth. 
And it shall not surprise me if the 
chief characteristic of President 
Grant's administration shall be the 
spiritual awakening- and growth and 
progress of the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-dav Saints. 

As we followed President Smith, 
let us follow our leader today. He 
is the spokesman of the Lord. The 
Lord has his program to work out ; 
and so far as I am concerned, and 
I hope It shall be true of every mem- 
ber of this Church, we shall be 
■willing to listen to the voice of the 
leader today. All honor to the lead- 
ers of the past. They filled their 
niche, their place, their station, 
completed their work. But the 
work of God is not finished in the 
earth. It has only partly com- 
pleted what God ordained it to 
do. And those of us who remain 
must seize the banner and carry this 
work off victorious, to glorify the 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD 



73 



names of those who have been iden- 
tified with this work in the days that 
are past, and to receive honor and 
place and position with them in the 
eternal world, and ^vindicate the 
word of our Father in his blessings 
and promises to those who would 
enter into sacred covenants to keep 
the commandments of the Lord. 

I rejoice to be identified with this 
work. In my soul I am thankful 
for a standing in this Church. I 
feel my weakness in appearing be- 
fore the Latter-day Saints m the 
responsibilities that have come to 
me. When President Grant in- 
formed me that it was the will of 
the Lord, and that the brethren 
had approved of that decision, that 
I should become a special witness 
for the Lord Jesus Christ, I was 
overwhelmed, because I did not feel 
that I was worthy of any such 
thing; and I answered him that if 
I believed that I could be worthy 
to be a special witness of the Lord 
Jesus Christ, an apostle, it would 
be the happiest hour of my life; 
for I look upon/ it as the highest 
honor that can come to a man on 
the earth ; but my standard of what 
kind of men they ought to be was 
so great, so far above what Lam, 
that I did not know if I could meas- 
ure up to that standard or not ; but 



if the Lord wanted me, as I had 
sung, and as I had tried to live, — 

I'll go where he wants me to go, ■ 
I'll say what he wants me to say, 
I'll be what h,e wants me to be; 

and if the Lord was willing and 
the brethren would be patient with 
me, then with all my heart, mind 
and soul, .1 would try to be the 
kind of man that the Lord wanted 
me to be, and fulfil this calling, not 
as a master, but as a servant of the 
people ; not that I am any better 
than thousands of my brethren, but 
just because the Lord sees some- 
thing in me that he can use at this 
time, and I am willing that he shall 
use it- to the glory of his name. 

God bless and sanctify this con- 
ference and this gathering, that we 
shall keep in our minds the noble 
example of our illustrious leader 
who is gone, that we may to the 
close of our lives be as true as he 
was, to the truth, and find, as I 
am sure we shall, salvation in the 
kingdom of God with him and with 
all the faithful who have gone be- 
fore, I ask in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 

The Glee Club sang: "Hail to 
the Prince of Peace." 

The closing prayer was offered 
by Elder Benjamin Goddard, of the 
Bureau of Information.

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

From the annual reports for the 
year 1918, we have compiled some 
information that I believe will be 
of interest to the Latter-day 
Saints : 

STATISTICS. 

During the year 1918, there were 
14,761 baptisms and 15,963 chil- 
dren were blessed. There were 
5,752 deaths, which is the largest 
number on record for any year. Of 
this number, 1,054 died of influenza 
and 862 died of pneumonia. 

MILITARY. 

Over 20,000 members of the 
Church were in the military service 
of the United States and its allies at 
the close of the year 1918. 'Of this 
number, 383 died in the service. We 
should have been allowed not less 
than twenty chaplains and we made 
application for permission to fur- 
nish our quota, but for some reason, 
unknown to us, we were only al- 
lowed to furnish three chaplains, 



two of whom saw active service at 
the front in France. 

PRIESTHOOD. 

There has been a better attend- 
ance of the priesthood at the ward 
weekly meetings but there are still 
9,078 persons who hold the priest- 
hood whom the Bishops report are 
willing to labor but have not been 
assigned to any duties in the stake 
or ward. 

TITHES. 

There has been a considerable' in- 
crease in the amount of tithes paid 
for the year 1918. The tithing has 
been well handled by the Bishops. 
V ery little loss has been incurred, 
except through the failure to find a 
market for the large potato crop of 
the year 1917. 

TEMPLES. 

There were 175,525 baptisms for 
the dead performed in the temples, 
and. there were 78,001 endowments 
for the living and the dead. The 
Hawaiian Temple is now practically 
completed at a cost of about $200,- 
000.00. The Cardston Temple is 
nearing completion and will cost, 
when finished, about $600,000.00. 

SACRAMENT MEETINGS. 

In consequence of the quarantine 
and conditions 'prevailing during 
the epidemic of influenza in the lat- 
ter part of the year 1918, the at- 
tendance at Sacrament meetings 
has 'fallen off and the visits of the 
ward teachers have not been as 
regular as in other years. 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT

FINANCES. 

The following are some of the 
expenditures paid out of the tithes 
and other Church funds during the 
year 1918: 

There has been ex- 
pended for assisting 
the worthy poor . .$ 279,244.30 

For missionary work, 
and jbuilding iof 
meeting houses in 
the missions, imis- 
sion houses and re- 
turn fare of Elders. 345,761.51 

For the maintenance / 
and operation of the 
Church school sys- 
tem, including the 
erection of new 
school buildings . . . 695,561.70 

For the maintenance 
and operaiton of the 
St. George, Logan, 
Manti and Salt 
Lake Temples .... 170,000.00 

For the construction 
and equipment of 
the Hawaiian and 
Cardston Temples. . 340,036.17 

For the erection of 
meeting houses 
(This 'does not in- 
clude donations for 
the same purpose by 
members of the re- 
spective wards) . . . 288,766.76 

For the maintenance 
of stakes and wards 
in all their various 
departments 526,002.91 

$2,645,373.35 

Attention has been called to the 
fact that the work which the Pio- 
neers did in planting trees and in 
beautifying homes, farms, ward 



meeting houses, schools and other 
buildings, is being sadly neglected 
in the' Latter-day Saint communi- 
ties. Our advice and counsel to the 
Latter-day Saints is to plant more 
trees, to get the best kinds adapted 
to each locality and grow itnem 
wherever they can be grown. 

In my remarks here yesterday I 
referred to the comments of a gen- 
tleman from St. Louis, who makes 
a specialty of parking and beautify- 
ing cities, and who stated that we 
are not living up to the very splen- 
did record made in this particular 
by the early pioneers. A gentleman 
remarked to Brother McMurrin, 
on one occasion, that our whole city 
is a park, and it would be indeed 
a park if we carried out the advice 
given in early days, by President 
Brigham Young and others, that 
we should plant trees in the vacant 
spaces in front of our homes. 

As stated yesterday, I had the 
privilege of attending the Demi- 
centennial Celebration ot the com- 
pletion of the Union and Central 
Pacific Railroads at Ogden, and re- 
gretted that a report was not taken 
and published of the speeches of 
four officials of the Southern Pacific 
Railroad. I have just received a 
letter from one of the speakers, Mr. 
J. M. Fulton, enclosing a short ex- 
tract from his address, on which I 
had personally complimented him. 
I desire to read this extract, in order 
that it may become part of our pro- 
ceedings : 

But we all do, and must, remem- 
ber that before either survey or con- 
struction of the Central or Union 
Pacific Railroads had commenced, a 
hardy, thrifty, industrious, God-lov- 
ing people had shown that the des- 
ert, from the Missouri river to Utah, 
could be conquered. They were the 
pioneers who bjazed the trail to 
where we now are, and it is they who 



76 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



have made of Utah what it is today, 
but in my judgment, they did not 
then, do not now, conceive of the 
great future that lies before them. 

We find in this Valley, a vast pro- 
duction of sugar-beets, grains, fruit, 
livestock, and everything that man 
needs, ,and the blessing is that there 
is a home market for all that is pro- 
duced. You have vast sugar fac- 
tories, flour mills, canning plants, and 
your splendid meat packing estab- 
lishment, all standing ready to take 
from the farmer for cash all that he 
produces. 

This cooperation will surely make 
of Utah a great and rich land. No- 
where else in the world do I know 
of such helpful cooperation between 
the producer and the manufacturer 
as shown in Utah, nor have I ever 
known a more hospitable people. It 
is the blood of those brave men, 
whom we all revere, who, for their 
love of God, dared the desert and 
sought a new land, who are now 
building and will soon make of Utah 
one of the greatest states of the 
Union. Even now, Utah manufac- 
tured commodities are finding a 
market in nearly every state, and in 
many foreign lands. 

And now, in conclusion, I, want to 
say to you that on this day you are 
driving a Spike of Gold into our 
hearts that will stay put, and we hope 
so worthy a people as you have a 
similar feeling for us. 

The chief engineer of the South- 
ern Pacific Railroad, Mr.Wm. Hood, 
delivered a magnificent speech upon 
that occasion, paying one of the fin- 
est tributes to the pioneers that I 
have ever heard." I regret exceed- 
ingly that the enterprise of our 
newspapers was such that we only 
had pictures of the procession, page 
after page, but nothing 1 of the very 
splendid remarks that were made. 

ELDER DAVID O. McKAY 

Home-building characteristics of the 
Latter-day Saints — One important 
duty of home-builders — The home 
threatened in the present world 
commotion — To save this sacred in- 
stitution devolves upon the Saints— 



A few fundamental principles to be 
kept in mind: Honor, obedience, 
mutual service, eternity of th.e mar- 
riage relation — These spell Home, 
and comprehend the spirit in which 
the principles of life and salvation 
should be taught to children— The 
home of President Joseph F. Smith 
an example. 

My brethren and sisters, I re- 
joice in having the privilege of unit- 
ing with you in this great spiritual 
feast. Yjesterday was Memorial 
day, and I pray that today may 
be equally rich in the outpouring of ' 
the Spirit of the Lord. In the most 
interesting remarks made just now 
by President Grant, reference was 
made to the home-beautifying 
characteristic of the Pioneers. That 
is just in keeping with the thought 
that is uppermost in my mind this 
morning. The Pioneers were home 
builders in the truest, most f unda- • 
mental sense. 

I would like to read that impor- 
tant passage from Section 68 of the 
Doctrine and Covenants, in which 
the Lord says plainly what one im- 
portant duty of home-builders 1 is : 
"Inasmuch as parents have children 
in Zion, or in any of her stakes 
which are organized, that teach 
them not to understand the doctrine 
of repentance, faith in Christ the 
Son of the Living God and of bap- 
tism and the gift of the Holy Ghost 
by the laying on of the hands when 
eight years old, the sin be upon the 
heads of the parents ; for this shall 
be a law unto the inhabitants of 
Zion, or in any of her stakes which 
are organized ; * * * and they 
shall also teach their children to 
pray and walk uprightly before the 
Lord." 

We are living in a most moment- 
ous age. We see on every hand 
manifestations of commotion. The 



ELDER DAVID 0. McKAY

world seemingly is stirred as it has 
never been stirred before. Politi- 
cal institutions are crumbling. Old 
forms and methods are fast giving 
way to new ones. Political organi- 
zations are being revolutionized, 
some for better and some for worse. 
Old fundamental principles of gov- 
ernment are tottering. Some have 
even been replaced by theories that 
are not tenable, others not practi- 
cable, and some that are infamous. 

In the midst of this world-com- 
motion the home, the fundamental 
institution of society, is ako threat- 
ened. In contrast to this funda- 
mental instruction given by the 
Lord I should like to read what I 
found, yesterday, written by a man 
who has taken a general survey of 
the condition of the world in regard 
to the home : 

"Many maintain that we are ready 
for a movement into community liv- 
ing. There are those who raise the 
question whether family life is a 
permanent form of social organization 
for which we may wisely contend. Pr 
is it but a phase from which the race 
is now emerging? Some men see 
signs that the ties of marriage will 
be but temporary, that children will 
be born, not into families, but into 
the life of the State, bearing only 
mothers' names and knowing no 
brothers and sisters, save in that 
brotherhood of the State." 

The author of that paragraph 
wrote those sentiments before the 
revolution in Russia, but you who 
have followed the anarchy that 
followed the overthrowing of the 
autocratic form of government in 
that land realize how literally some 
men have attempted to strike at 
the sacredness and the perpetuity of 
family life. 

Latter-day Saints, the responsi- 
bility of saving this sacred institu- 



tion devolves largely upon you, for 
you know that the family ties are 
eternal. They should be eternal. 
There is nothing temporary in the 
home of the Latter-day Saint. 
There is no element of transitori- 
ness in the family relationship of 
the Latter-day Saint home. That 
all such ties are eternal should be 
maintained. To the Latter-day 
Saint the home is truly the cell- 
unit of society ; and parentnood is 
next to Godhood. The relationship 
of the children to the parents should 
be one which would enable those 
children to carry out ideal citizen- 
ship as they become related to the 
State and to the larger forms of 
society. The secret of good citi- 
zenship lies in the home. The se- 
cret of instilling faith in God, faith 
in his Son, the Redeemer of the 
world, faith in the organizations of 
the Church, lies in the home. There 
it is .centered. C God has placed 
.upon you parents the responsibility 
of instilling these principles into 
the minds of children. Church 
schools, Sunday schools, Mutual 
Improvement associations. Primary 
and Religion classes are all helps in 
government, established here to as- 
sist in the upbuilding and guidance 
of the youth, but none of these — 
great and important factors as they 
are in the lives of our youth — can 
supplant the permanence and the 
influence of the parents in the 
home. 

There are a few fundamental 
principles which we should ever 
keep in mind. First, the eternity of 
the marriage relation. Oh, may 
our youth throughout the land 
realize that they have within their 
grasp the possibilities of that form 
of marriage which will contribute 
more Jto their happiness r in this 



78 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



world and their eternal union and 
happiness in the world to come than 
can be obtained anywhere else in 
the world. Let our young men and 
women look forward with pride, 
with eagerness, to the time when, 
in worthiness, they may go to the 
House of God and have their love 
sealed by the bonds of the eternal 
priesthood. No element that is tem- 
porary in such union as that ! Noth- 
ing that is passing with the years ; 
but binding for time and all eter- 
nity. Second, let us hold to that 
first word in the second part of the 
fundamental law of humanity, the 
ten commandments. Those first few 
commandments refer to our rela- 
tionship to God. The last few to 
our relationship to humanity. The 
second part begins with the word 
honor — "Honor thy father and thy 
mother." Let us cherish in our 
homes as we cherish the lives of 
our children themselves, that word 
honor with all the synonyms — re- 
spect, reverence, veneration ; hon- 
oring mother, honoring father, 
having them honor us as we honor 
and revere God our eternal Father. 
Let the element of honor, devotion, 
reverence permeate the home life. 
Thirdly, let us never lose sight of 
the principle of obedience. Obedi- 
ence is heaven's first law, and it is 
the law of the home. There can be 
no true happiness in the home with- 
out obedience — obedience obtained, 
not through physical force, but 
through the divine element of love. 
There is no home without love. You 
may have a palace and yet not have 
a home, and you may live in a log 
house with a dirt roof, and a dirt 
floor, and have there the most glo- 
rious home in all the world, if with- 
in those four log walls there per- 



meates the divine principle ot love, 
love that draws from husband to 
wife and from children to parents, 
that blessed obedience and compli- 
ance that makes life worth while. 

I believe firmly that parents fail 
to get obedience from their chil- 
dren during the first five years of 
childhood. I believe that during 
that most important period of child 
life the parents sow the .seeds of 
obedience or disobedience. Some of 
us fill that period of child life with 
too many don'ts, failing to make 
the child realize that a request from 
father, a request from mother 
should be complied with. Mother 
says : "Don't touch that," to the 
little child. The little child tod- 
dles along and touches it. What 
is the result? The seeds of dis- 
obedience are sown. You don't 
have to punish the little child. Lov- 
ingly, kindly, but firmly, teach the 
child that there are" rules in the 
house which should be obeyed. 
Mothers, fathers, treasure sacredly 
and sense keenly your responsibil- 
ity to the child during those first 
five plastic years of its life. With 
these home elements I desire to 
mention another, and that is mutual 
service, each working for the other. 
If some of these pernicious the- 
ories to which I referred shall pre- 
vail and take out from the home the 
relationship of parents to children 
and children to parents, and chil- 
dren to each other, they will de- 
prive humanity of one of the great- 
est means of teaching the true spirit 
of Christ — sacrifice for each other, 
salvation through service. O that 
home is most beautiful in which 
you find each striving to serve the 
other, and you find them, too, all 
through the Church. Here is a 



ELDER DAVID 0. McKAY

young woman whose father, 
through misfortune, lost his wealth. 
She is compelled to get a profes- 
sion, follow it for her livelihood and 
to assist the parents. The call 
comes for her brother, younger 
than she, to go on a mission. He 
hasn't much means, he hasn't any. 
The ward, through entertainments 
and service, pays his fare to his 
missionary field, and the sister for 
two years, shares her scanty means 
to keep him there preaching the 
gospel of Christ. He comes home 
in honor, having served his Lord 
and brought honest souls to a real- 
ization of the eternal principles of 
life. When he throws his arms 
around his sister in the home greet- 
ing, he says : "Sister, I owe you 
much, I owe you a lot of money, 
too." She answers: "'Not one 
cent. I have been delighted to con- 
tribute my mite in that great work." 
Mutual service in the home, the 
Christ spirit! Two testimonies 
strengthened through service and 
self sacrifice. I tell you we cannot 
afford to eliminate that element 
from home life. 

Just by way of impressing these 
principles upon your minds I will 
say, incidentally, that if I change 
the order slightly you will find that 
by combining the first letters they 
will spell home, and it seems to me 
they comprehend the spirit in which 
the principles of life and salvation 
should be taught to children. 
Honor, obedience, mutual service, 
eternity of the marriage relation. 
God help us as parents to send from 
our homes true Latter-day Saints, 
boys and girls who cio not hesitate 
to bear testimony of their member- 
ship in the Church, more than that, 
boys and girls who are eager to go 
out into the world and bear testi- 



mony to the world that the mar- 
riage relationship is an" eternal one, 
that the home is a permanent and 
eternal institution against which no 
theory that strikes at the purity and 
honor of womanhood, that deprives 
children of fatherhood, or the love 
of mother, can stand or in any way 
attack that institution. God help us 
fathers and mothers to build such 
homes. While we are beautifying 
th em without, keep within them the 
spirit of the gospel of Jesus Christ. 

In this respect, I know of no bet- 
ter example than the home of our 
late beloved President Joseph F. 
Smith. His sons, his daughters, 
his wives, are true to the gospel, 
true to the truth. Thev loved and 
honored President Smith, but 
through that they love and honor 
that which is even greater — the 
truth, the gospel. His closing words 
to his sons and daughters, I think, 
are a classic. On November 10, 
1918, he expressed his heart's 
truest sentiments to those boys and 
girls who stood around him saying, 
and mind you, these are almost his 
last words: "When I look around 
me and see my boys and my girls 
whom the Lord has given to me— 
and I realize I have succeeded, with 
his help, to make them tolerably 
comfortable and at least respecta- 
able in the world — I have reached 
the treasure of my life, the whole 
substance that makes life worth liv- 
ing." God sanctify those words to 
us that we, too, may obtain "the 
treasure of life — the whole sub- 
stance that makes life worth liv- 
ing." I pray in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



ELDER ANTHONY W. IVINS 

The surrender of Lord Cornwallis an 
event of great importance, bearing 
on today's civil and religious lib- 
erty — The past year the most event- 
ful in the history of both Govern- 
ment and Church — Our direct con- 
tact with the great world war — The 
stupendous accomplishment of our 
Nation in the war — The need of 
united effort in Church and Nation 
— Capital and Labor must be 
brought together in union of in- 
terest — We must have just laws and 
men of character to administer 
them — Fewer politicans and more 
unselfish statesmen — God give us 
men who will stand for the right 
and for law and order in both 
Church and Nation. 

"For the former things art. 
passed away, and he that sat uppL 
the throne said : Behold I make 
all things new." 

The proceedings of the confer- 
ence, my brethren and sisters, and 
my own reflections, as I have 
thought of the immediate past, 
and the probabilities' of the future, 
have prompted me to read this 
scripture from tb)e revelation to 
St. John, upon the Isle of Patmos, 
as a basis for the brief remarks 
which I expect to make this morn- 
ing. 

It is now 137 years since the 
Surrender of Lord Cornwatlis, 
and the British Army which he 
commanded, at Yorktown, which 
made possible the establishment of 
the confederacy of the states known 
as the United States of America. 
It was an event which meant more 
to the people of the world than 
men of the time dreamed. It is 
true that representatives of the 
three millions of people who con- 
stituted the original thirteen col- 
onies, hoped, and expected that 
the system which they founded 
would endure, that the right of 
self-government would descend 



to their children, that America 
would become and forever re- 
main a gathering place, an asylum, 
for the oppressed and down-trod- 
den of all nations, but that the 
seed sown at that time would 
within a period of 137 years re- 
sult in the breaking clown of king- 
craft, the crash of monarchies, and 
the establishment of free govern- 
ment throughout the civilized 
.world was neither hoped for nor 
expected. It was an event of 
great importance to the, world and 
particularly so to us who are mem- 
bers of the Church of Christ be- ■ 
cause it opened the way for the 
breaking down of religious prejud- 
ice and recognition of the doc- 
trine that just as man was entitled 
to enjoy life, liberty, and to pur- 
sue happiness in his own way, so 
long as he did not interfere with 
the rights of his neighbor, so was 
it his privilege to worship the 
Lor,d according to the dictates of 
conscience, let him worship who, 
where or what he may desire. 

Eio-hty-nine years ago the 
Church was organized, and since 
tha^ time it has been the custom of 
the members to meet together on 
the 6th day of April in general 
conference, as we are assembled 
here today, the present date being 
somewhat delayed because of cir- 
cumstances over which we had no 
control. The purpose of these 
meetings is to transact the busi- 
ness of the Church, review the 
past, and plan for the future, that 
we may determine by comparison 
the growth and development of the 
Church. The present is, of course, 
of greater importance to us than 
either the past or future, because 
it is our day,, but our lives are so 
closely associated with the past and 
the future is of so great impor-- 



ELDER ANTHONY W. IVINS

ance to us, that we cannot confine 
ourselves entirely to existing con- 
ditions. By the experiences of the 
past, if we are discreet, we learn 
wisdom. The paths trodden by 
those who have passed away are 
paths of safety, or danger, to us 
'as they have been to those who 
have walked in them before us. 
The pitfalls are marked, the shoals 
and reefs have been charted, and 
only a careless or headstrong 
mariner will fall into the pits, or 

- drive his vessel upon the rocks 
where others have been wrecked. 
Since the establishment of the 
the Church, both Church and Nation 
have experienced periods of trial 
which have shaken the very founda- 
tions upon which they rest. There 
have been times when the perpe- 
turity of the government has been 
threatened by war with foreign 
powers, and by fratricidal strife; 
but upon each occasion it has 
emerged stronger, more stead- 
fast than before. The same 
condition applies to the Church, it 
has been assailed by enemies from 
without and by schisms within, but 
notwithstanding these efforts to 
destroy it, it has with each suc- 
ceeding 1 year grown stronger, ex- 
tending its power and influence for 
good as the years have rolled by. 
We are now met together again, 
representatives of the Church from 
all parts of the world, where the 
gospel has been preached and 
branches of the Church organized, 
to review occurrences of the most 
eventful vear in our history, the 

, most eventful year in the history of 
the modern world, to consider the 
requirements of the Church and the 
Government of which we form a 
part and. plan for the future, in so, 
far as we are capable of doing with 
our finite wisdom and knowledge. 



I refer to both the government and 
the Church because to me that 
which is vital to one is of equal im- 
portance to the other. Without 
just laws by which society may be 
controlled and the rights of the 
people protected, and honest, con- 
scientious men to administer them, 
the Church cannot exist. It never 
has been able to exist without them ; 
and without the influence of the 
Church, which teaches honesty, 
morab>^ ^"votion to dutv, respect 
for the law and the patriotic sup- 
port of the men who enact and en- 
force, there cannot, in mv opinion, 
-"A just government. 

Dunne the past vear the Church 
has been brought into direct con- 
tact for the first time with a great 
world war. It is true that on other 
occasions comparatively small num- 
bers of its members have served in 
the armies of our country, but 
never before has the effect of war 
been so universally felt and the peo- 
ple put to a similar test. Believ- 
ing, as we do, in the divine doctrine 
of peace, as it was taught by the 
Redeemer of the world, abhorring 
the shedding of blood, believing in 
the universal fatherhood of God 
and brotherhood of man, war was 
abhorrent to us; but when our 
country called, when it became 
necessarv to take up arms in de- 
fense of the principles for which 
our government stands, we re- 
sponded as cheerfully and per- 
formed our part as bravely as did 
anv other citizens of the republic. 

During the past year, as has been 
stated, one of the most desolating 
scourges of sickness ever known 
has passed over the land. An un- 
precedented number of our Church 
members have been stricken, and 
many of our most useful and es- 
teemed brethren and sisters have 



82 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



passed away. During the past year 
the Church has lost, as you all 
know, its honored, esteemed and 
beloved president. For seventeen 
years President Smith had presided 
over the Church, had directed its 
policy and to a great extent shaped 
its destiny. We believed in the di- 
vinity of his prophetic calling, had 
confidence in his wisdom and judg- 
ment, felt that -his example and 
teachings were indispensable to the 
welfare of the Church, but the 
Lord saw fit to take him, and call 
another to stand in his place, a new 
man to direct the policy of the 
Church in this new era upon which 
we are entering, in this new world, 
for the world of 1919 is not the 
same world which existed a year 
ago. The government, like the 
Church, has passed through experi- 
ences, the like of which have never 
before been known. No nation has 
ever before, within the same period 
of time, mobilized from raw re- 
cruits, armed and equipped, trans- 
ported across the sea, furnished 
commissary for, trained and sent 
to the battle front such an army of 
fighting men as has the United 
States of America. Men may criti- 
cise that which has been 'done, raav 
tell you how it might have been 
better done, but the fact remains 
that the most stupendous undertak- 
ing which the world has even 
known has been successfully ac- 
complished. 

One year ago the question of the 
courage and devotion of the Ameri- 
can soldier, when he might reach 
the old world, was one of common 
discussion. Since the events winch 
occurred one vear ago vesterday 
and today, when American ma- 
rines and infantry, for the first 
time went into action at Chateau- 
Thierry, that question has been set 



at rest, for never before in the his- 
tory of the world have men shown 
greater courage, greater devotion, 
greater self-sacrifice than has the 
American soldier upon the battle 
fields of France. Men have criti- 
cised, and will continue to criticise, 
that splendid citizen-soldier who has 
commanded our armies abroad, will 
tell you that the success of our 
arms was not due to his intelligence 
or generalship, but it is a well- 
known fact that no American com- 
mander was ever before confronted 
bv conditions so difficult and well 
nigh insurmountable and that under 
his leadership the war was brought 
to a speedy and successful term- 
ination. Men have criticised, and 
1 suppose will continue to criticise 
and seek to belittle the man who has 
stood as the representative of the 
American people, and American 
ideals, through this critical and 
eventful period ; will question his 
judgment, his patriotism, and will 
not hesitate to grossly attack his 
character in their efforts to discredit 
his administration, but the fact re- 
mains, and will be so written in his- 
tory, that President Wilson has 
been confronted by the most diffi- 
cult, the most intricate and complex 
questions which have ever confront- 
ed a President of the United States. 
The Lord be praised that he has 
managed them as well as he has. 

You may ask : what has this to 
do with this conference and the 
welfare of the Church? I have 
called attention to the fact that we 
are entering upon a new era, are 
upon the threshold of a new world. 
Changes have come to the Church, 
and many other changes will come. 
I cannot perceive "ay careful per- 
sonal observation; that these 
changes have created a ripple of 
confusion or dissension in the 



ELDER ANTHONY W. WINS 



83 



Church. Without exception this 
splendid body of men who make up 
the presiding authorities of the 
Church, stand solidly behind the 
new Presidency, and if this condi- 
tion shall continue there can be no 
doubt regarding the success of this 
administration; but let me ask you 
this question : Suppose that we who 
are nearest to President Grant and 
his counselors, these presidents of 
stakes, were constantly seeking oc- 
casion to discredit that which they 
do, criticising their policy without 
offering a better, sowing the seeds 
of dissension among the people, 
suppose that* we, in order to ai. 
complish our own ambitious pur- 
poses, were sowing the seeds of 
distrust and dissension among the 
members of the Church, how long 
would it continue to exist? it 
would soon be converted into 
broken fragments without cohesion 
or power. Not one of us, ' I am 
sure, desires this condition; and if 
we adhere to our past and present 
•policy, each man and woman seek- 
ing first the establishment of the 
Kingdom of Heaven upon earth, 
and the Lord's righteousness, it 
will never come, but the Church 
will enter upon this new era with 
a strength and power of develop- 
ment such as it has never before 
known. What I say of the Church 
I apply to the Government. We 
need it. We must have it, and I 
can not conceive that we can be 
true to one and untrue to the other. 
I can not conceive that I have obli- 
gations of duty and service to my 
brethren and sisters in the Church 
which I do not owe to my fellow 
citizens in the State, and if I see 
danger ahead for my country, it 
is my duty to declare it as it is to 
ward off' danger from the Church, 
and I fancy that I see such danger 



for my country. The State, like 
the Church, is entering upon a new 
era, is upon the threshold of a new 
world. Without sacrificing funda- 
mentals, old policies and preju- 
dices must give way, selfishness, the 
curse of the modern world, whether 
it be personal, community or 
national, must give way to a 
broader, more liberal, more states- 
manlike policv, The selfishness of 
the poor, who look with greedy 
eyes upon the possessions of those 
who, by their industry and econ- 
omy, have accumulated plenty, and 
a desire to take it without the con- 
sent of the owner, or giving value 
received for it, the inordinate sel- 
fishness and greed of the rich, who 
grind down the poor, who shut 
their eyes and close their ears to 
the cry of the needy in order that 
they may add to their ill-gotten 
gains, are the two great elements 
of danger which I see for our gov- 
ernment. Governments have been 
wrecked by them since the begin- 
ning of time. Why should we close 
our eyes to the experiences of the 
past? Some means must be found 
by which those who toil, who pro- 
duce the wealth of the world, may 
more justly share in the fruits of 
their labors. \ By which those who 
have in abundance may be protected 
in the possession of that which is 
justly theirs. Unless a plan be 
found bv which capital and labor 
may be brought together on a basi> 
of riarhteousness, the time is not 
far distant when the condition 1 ; 
which prevail in the old world will 
be enacted in our own beloved 
country. One thing is indispens- 
able to the perpetuity of our sys- 
tem of government. 

It is not so much the enactment 
of just laws, however important 
th:.t may be, as it is the character 



84 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



of the men who administer them ; 

ir th" best of laws, if administered 
by selfish, dishonest men, amount 
to little nothing. What our 
country needs, is more unselfish 
statesmen and fewer professional 
politicians. Personally I can see 
little difference between the man 

1 who by sabbotage prevents the harv- 
esting of the crops of the West, 
where the people cry for bread, 
stops f kf "'heels of the factories in 
the East, while the people shiver 
with cold, and the member of Con- 
gress who, by sabbotage, under an- 
other name, obstructs legislation, 
stops the wheels of commerce, re- 
fuses appropriations designed to 
proyi.de for the industries of the 
Country, to feed its army, provide 
for its navy and- render assistance 
to a dying world which in an- 
guish looks on and cries for succor, 
and all to accomplish his own am- 
bitious purposes and satisfy his 
petty spite. It seems to me that 
never before were the words 01 
T. G. Holland more anplicable than 
they are today, when we are con- 
fronted by these universal world- 
wide conditions, which either mean 
the destruction of society or its 
protection. He long ago said : 
"God give us men. A time like this 
requires strong minds, great hearts, 
true faith and ready hands ; men 
whom the lust of office does not 
kill, men whom the spoils of office 
cannot buy; for while the rabble 

•with their thumb-worn creeds, their 
great pretentions and their little 
deeds, mingle in selfish strife, lo 
freedom weeps, wrong rules the 
land, and waiting justice sleeps." 

The Lord has spoken plainly to 
us who are of the Church upon this 
question, has told us that many are 
called but few are chosen. Why 
(are they not chosen? Because 



their hearts are set so much upon 
the things of this world, and -aspire 
to the honors of men, that they 
forget this one lesson : that the 
rights of the priesthood are insep- 
arably connected with the poweis 
of heaven, and that the powers of 
heaven cannot be controlled or ex- 
ercised, except upon principles of 
righteousness; that whenever we 
use it to accomplish our own am- 
ibitious purposes, to satisfy 'our 
own pride or exercise dominion by 
'compulsion over the souls of men, 
in any degree of unrighteousness, 
amen to the priesthood and author- 
ity of that man. 

I believe, my brethren and sisters 
that this doctrine applies to men 
who are engaged in the adminis- 
tration of civil affairs, as it does to 
those who are engaged in work for 
the Church ; for whether men be- 
lieve it or not, the powers of 
heaven do dominate this earth, and 
woe to the man who ignores it. 
He will reap that which he sows, 
as many people in the world today 
are reaping the harvest from the 
seed which they have sown. And 
so my appeal to you is to put away 
from us all, as far as we can, per- 
sonal selfishness and ambition, to 
desist from unjust criticism of the 
men in the Church, and in the 
State, who stand for that which is 
right for the maintenance of law 
and order, for the protection of tht 
rights of society, that we give patri- 
otic and unselfish service to both 
the Church and the State, service 
which is freely given; for a gift 
given or duty performed, if done 
grudgingly, counts us for little or 
nothing. May the Lord help us, 
my brethren and sisters, to look in- 
to this new world with enlarged 
vision, to comprehend our duties 
to it, and to each other, and faith-

We have been listening to truth, 
so we will ask the congregation to 
arise and join in singing John 
Jaques's inspired hymn — "O, Say, 
What is Truth :" 

O, say, what is truth? 'Tis the fairest 
gem 

That the riches of worlds can pro- 
duce; 

And priceless the value of truth will 
be when 

The> proud monarch's costliest dia-

Is counted* but dross and refuse. 

Yes, say, what is truth? 'Tis the 
brightest prize 
To which mortals or Gods > can 
aspire: 

Go search in the depths where it 

glittering lies, 
Or ascend in pursuit to the loftiest 

skies, 

'Tis an aim for the noblest de- 
sire. 

The sceptre may fall from the des- 
pot's grasp, 
When with winds of stern jus- 
tice he copes, 

But the pillar of truth will endure 
to the last, 

And its firm-rooted bulwarks out- 
stand the rude blast, 
And the wreck of the fell tyrant's 
hopes. 

Then, say, what is truth? 'Tis the 
last and the first, 
For the limits of time it steps o'er: 
Though the heavens depart, and the 

earth's fountains burst, 
Truth, the sum of existence, will 
weather the worst, 
Eternal, unchanged, evermore. 

J. Jaques. 

Following the singing of the 
hymn, President Grant said: 

Usually, in our conference pro- 
ceedings, the hymn is mentioned 



and the first line recorded, but I 
would request Brother Edward H. 
Anderson, our clerk, to see that in 
publishing the proceedings of this 
conference, this inspired hymn 
shall appear in full. 

Since our last meeting the va- 
cancy caused by the .death of our 
beloved President has been filled 
by my being taken from the Coun- 
cil of the Twelve, creating a va- 
cancy in that Council, and Brother 
Melvin J. Ballard has been sus- 
tained by you here, yesterday, to 
fill the vacancy in the Council of 
the Twelve. We will now ask 
Brother Ballard to occupy the bal- 
ance of the time in this meeting. 

ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD 

Scourges have a lesson and a mean- 
ing of great significance — Testi- 
monies of Nature — The wisdom of 
men cannot counteract the scourges 
of God — Through calamities and 
judgments the Lord often touches 
the hearts of men — Why the inno- 
cent and the good suffer affliction 
— The answer from the Lord who 
speaks through the suffering of the 
good, that all mav repent — Let us 
therefore resolve to serve God bet- 
ter than ever that we may escape 
the judgments or tomorrow — 
Danger in material prosperity — 
But God is at the helm. 

The circumstance which has 
postponed the -annual conference 
of the Church from April until 
June has already been commented 
upon. I feel, however, that it is a 
matter of sufficient importance to 
call your attention to it again, i 
believe that the events that have 
transpired have a lesson and a 
meaning of great significance to 
the Latter-day Saints and to . the 
world. I believe that it is pleasing 
to the Lord for us to contemplate 
these things that are occurring, ana

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



to learn the lessons which he in- 
tends we should and, therefore, mv 
mind and my thoughts have been 
''welling upon this matter for some 
time past. I believe that the Lord 
understood exactly what was to 
transpire. I read in the , first sec- 
tion of the book of Doctrine and 
Covenants, in the Lord's preface to 
this book, that he, the Lord, know- 
ing those things that would happen 
in the last days, the judgments 
that would come, war and pesti- 
lence, etc., spoke through his serv- 
ant, the Prophet Joseph Smith and 
addressed the whole world through 
this humble instrumentality, reveal- 
ing the fulness of the everlasting 
gospel, giving command that the 
elders of the Church should carr\ 
this message and warning, that this 
is the hour of God's judgment, and 
that the Lord had provided the 
means of escape through the resto- 
ration of the everlasting gospel, 
and that the elders of the Church 
were to carry this message to the 
islands of the sea and to the nations 
of the earth. I believe, as we re- 
view the efforts of our brethren — 
our fathers,/)ur grandfathers, who 
have endeavored to perform this 
duty, that they stand with their 
skirts clear of the blood, of this 
generation. By thousands and tens 
of thousands they have gone to the 
islands of the sea, to the lands of 
the earth, to countries where they 
were not wanted, where they were 
imprisoned, and from which they 
were exiled, and many of them 
have given up their lives there, 
through being; martyred or through 
disease. They have given their 
best. Nothing has deterred them. 
- None of the things of the earth 
that are attractive to men have 
swerved these brethren from the 



discharge of their duty; so that we 
have, I believe, a record that is 
clean and clear, and we have per- 
formed our duty towards the 
world. 

Among those judgments which 
the Lord said would come — after 
the testimony of his servants, cry- 
ing repentance to the nations of the 
earth, and offering the means of es- 
cape through the acceptance of his 
gospel — should be the testimonies 
of thunder, of lightning, of earth- 
quakes, of the sea heaving itself 
beyond its bounds, of plague, 01 
famine and of pestilence. I believe 
in my soul that the Lord is speak- 
ing to the nations of the earth, fol- 
lowing the testimony of his hum- 
ble servant. You will recall, in the 
forty-fifth section of the Doctrine 
and Covenants what the Lord said 
to his servant, the Prophet Joseph, 
concerning some of these judg- 
ments. I believe that in part at 
least we find a fulfilment of one of 
the calamities that the Lord said 
would come in consequence of the 
wickedness and the rebellion of the 
people against that message which 
the Lord . delivered for the salva- 
tion of the world. You will find 
it in the thirty-first verse. "There 
shall be men standing in that gen- 
eration" — the generation in which 
he was then speaking — "that shall 
not pass, until they shall see an 
overflowing scourge ; for a deso- 
lating sickness shall cover the land." 
We may have laughed at that. Men 
have, in the past, tried to relegate 
the judgments of God into the < 
realm of accident, things that have 
happened because of the ignorance 
of men. I recall, mvself. reading 
how that the great black plague 
r*"' 1 other plasties that have infesten 
the world have been attributed to 



ELDER MELV1N J. BALLARD

the ignorance of the people ; and 
writers, modern .scientists, have 
said, that such a thing never could 
happen again, because we know so 
much about the laws of sanitation, 
how to correct disease and control 
it ; and they have told us that such 
a scourge could not occur in this 
day. We stand at the zenith of our 
knowledge ; never- before have men 
known so much about bacteriology 
and sanitation; and yet coming 
from unknown quarters, and mak- 
ing its way — men do not know 
how — from city to city, from in- 
dividual to inividual, there 
has come upon the world this 
dread affliction that has af- 
fected us so that our general con- 
ference had to be postponed. I be- 
lieve in my soul that it is the Lord 
speaking, even as he has spokei. 
, before, when men undertook to 
build so they could preserve them- 
selves against calamities. When 
they built a tower to reach so high 
that the floods of the earth could 
not touch them, he was greater than 
all their towers. He stands above 
all man's . feeble efforts to protect 
himself from the calamities antr 
judgments that are going to come 
upon the children of men, if they 
do not repent. You recall how that 
after th<* building of what was 
termed the "non-sinkable ship," the 
great Titanic, it sailed away from 
the shores of England, with a boast 
on the lips the men and women 
who drank their toast to the won- 
derful achievements of men in 
building a non-sinkable ship. Little 
did they think that in a few houra 
that great ship would strike an ice- 
berg and go down to the depths of 
the sea. 

So, no man has been able to build 
so well, and no man has yet 
acquired knowledge and informa- 



tion so that he can secure himself 
against the hand of the Lord, if he 
desires to reach him and touch him ; 
for we stand helpless before him. 
Physicians have discussed the sub- 
ject of the influenza-pneumonia 
scourge, and have adjourned -their 
meetings unable to decide just 
what it is. They have called it the 
"unknown disease," or the "X dis- 
ease." Ordinary nurses have been 
more successful than skilled physi- 
cians in preserving the lives of 
many. The deaths that have oc- 
curred in the world are appalling. 
Recently w learned that in India 
alone there have been more than 
six million persons who have died 
with this affliction. When I have 
contrasted the results among the 
Latter-dav Saints, I believe that I 
am safe in saying that no commu- 
nity in the world has been touched 
so lightly as the Latter-day Saints. 
There are th'^e huixlrc' thousand 
people living in Portland, Oregon, 
and T remember that it was re- 
ported that two thousand persons 
perished there during the inflneiii'- 1 
epidemic. c ^ there were twir*» °<? 
many deaths from x that cause in 
Portland, last year, as there were 
in the entire Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-dav Saints, and its popu- 
lation is certainly greater than three 
hundred tbr-'icand. Yet Portland 
ha r1 a record, according to the sta 
tistics, lower than most of the cities 
in the United States. My heart 
was touched, because many times 
we had to administer the last rites 
for those who did not belong to 
the Church. The morgues were 
full, and there were not enough 
ministers to conduct the services. 
I remember being greatly affected 
when we put into one grave three 
beautiful children, from one fam- 
ily, and laying mothers into the 



88 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



graves, who were taken away from 
their children, who were greatly in 
need of their help. 

I recall one circumstance when 
at the cemetery three funerals were 
being conducted at the same time, 
and we were so close together that 
we had to wait our turn in giving 
the opportunity for each group of 
mourners, peacefully, to lay their 
dead into the ground. My heart 
was touched, I say, as I listened to 
.the wail of grief that came forth 
from each group of mourners as 
the last rites were said. I with- 
drew behind a little clump of trees 
and cried earnestly to my Father 
in Heaven to know why innocent 
children, should perish, why moth- 
ers should be taken away who were 
needed in their families — good, true 
Latter-day Saints, many of them. 
I received an answer which was 
satisfactory to my soul, and it was 
that this was the judgment of God, 
even as he had said that his judg- 
ments would be poured out upoi, 
the nations of the earth, if they did 
not repent ; that the Lord wa, h 
speaking to the children of men, be- 
<-?vz the day of the coming; of t\v 
Redeemer was nigh at hand, an 1 
men could not live in their wickea- 
ness and see him. They must re- 
pent or they , shall perish, and the 
Lord was trying to touch the hearts 
of the children of men through this 
judgment. 

But why the Latter-day Sain'.s 
— why should they be afflicted? 
They have received the message of 
the gospel, or their fathers, in for- 
eign lands, and have, tn a measure 
at least, accepted of the means of 
escape from these calamities. Then 
the words of one of those revela- 
iV> ".s came to my mind, which was 
fully .satisfactory to me. I refer 
to the ninety-seventh section of tht 



book of Doctrine and Covenants, 
with which perhaps you are all 
familiar. You will rind in the 
twenty-second verse what I am 
now reading: 

"For behold, ana lo, vengeance 
cometh speedily upon the ungodly — 
and who shall escape it?" 

"The Lord's scourge shall pass over 
by night and by day, and the report 
thereof shall vex all people; yet it 
shall not be stayed . until the Lord 
come." 

In that connection I want toi 
read you something from the fifth 
section of the book of Covenants, 
dealing with this . subject; for, lei 
us not say to ourselves that we 
are out of the woods, that the 
trouble is past, and' no more 
trouble will come. I would to the 
Lord that we had arrived at thai 
state, when this would be possible, 
but we are not there yet. You 
will find here in the nineteenth 
verse of the fifth section : 

"For a desolating scourge shall 
go forth among the inhabitants of 
the earth, and shall continue to be 
poured out, from time to time, if 
they repent not, until the earth 
is empty, and the inhabitants there- 
of are consumed away and utterly 
destroyed by the brightness of my 
coming." 

That is the word of the Lord. 
^ T ow I do not understand that the 
plague of influenza shall contin- 
ue until the Lord comes, but I do 
think that one form or another of 
chastisement shall follow, with its 
"seasons for repentance, for the 
preaching of the gospel, and cry- 
ing- to the nations of the earth: 
/'Will .you now listen unto the 
Lord," and. if they shall not listen, 
then another affliction will come, 
until men shall either repent, or 
they shall perish. For these are 



ELDER MELVIN !. BALLARD

the last days, the days preceding 
the coming of the Redeemer, and 
he will not come when the wicked 
stand and flourish. Reading again 
from the ninety-seventh section : 

\"For the indignation of the Lord is 
kindled against their abominations 
and all their wicked works." 

Now here is the answer for our- 
selves : '■' : H 

"Nevertheless, Zion shall escape, if. 
she observe to do all things whatso- 
ever I have commanded her. 

"But if she observe not to do what- 
soever I have commanded her, I will 
visit her according to all her works, 
with sore affliction, with pestilence, 
with plague, with sword, with ven- 
geance, with devouring fire." 

Mv brethren and sisters, why 
should we hope to escape, who 
have been baptized into this Church, 
yet ignore the commandments of 
the Lord? For there are among 
us those who do not keep the Word 
of Wisdom, some of us do not pay 
our tithing ; we do not sanctify our- 
selves by adding unto our faith, 
virtue ; to virtue, knowledge, to 
knowledge, temperance, and pa- 
tience, and godliness, and brotherly 
kindness. Why should we claim 
exemption — we who know the 
truth, we who have been warned, 
we who will testify that we believe 
God has spoken — why should we 
escape if we do not keep the com- 
mandments of the Lord? And T 
say this with a feeling in my heart 
of deep appreciation that the Lat- 
ter-day Saints are, notwithstanding 
all this, the best people in the world ; 
and I have received a witness to 
my soul that the innocent children 
and faithful Latter-day Saints were 
not taken because they were wicked, 
nor because the families that were 
touched needed to be chastised 
more than others, but that the Lord 
was speaking through those who 



have been taken — these one thous- 
and who have gone from us. . The 
Lord is speaking through them to 
the whole Church, crying repem- 
ance unto us, calling us to set our 
houses in order, to keep the com- 
mandments of the Lord. 

When I read that wonderful 
statement in the concluding verse 
of the revelation known as the 
Word of Wisdom, wherein the 
Lord promised that those who 
would seek to keep these command- 
ments, that he would make them 
immune, that the destroyer should 
not destroy them unnecessarily, be- 
fore their day and time. As I read 
•the statement that those who were 
guilty of the excessive use of to- 
bacco had fallen easy victims to the 
influenza, I thought that the Lord, 
in giving us the Word of Wisdom, 
was trying to make the Latter-day 
Saints 1 immune, so that they might 
stand in the midst of the plagues 
and judgments that are to come. 
We will not escape them ; we will 
be touched by them ; but I want to 
testify to you that when the Latter- 
day Saints turn to the Lord and 
keep his commandments, and serve 
him in all things that have been re- 
quired, these judgments shall not 
harm us ; and our loved ones shall 
not go from us until the day ap- 
pointed for them to go has come. 
But if we shall be touched, it is be- 
cause the Lord is preparing us to 
stand in our places to be a light 
among the nations of the earth, the 
salt, the very savor of the world ; 
and we cannot be that except we 
keep the commandments of the 
Lord. 

So in my own mind and soul, I 
have resolved that I am going to 
serve God better than I have ever 
done ; that I am going to learn this 
lesson, that I do not want any more

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



whippings ; that I want to be will- 
ing and amenable today, so that the 
judgments of tomorrow need not 
fall upon me. I know that many of 
our brethren and sisters who have 
perished were worthy to go ; and 
those who need repentance have 
stayed, that they may repent. I 
pray in my soul that the Lord will 
comfort and bless those who have 
been bereaved ; for he knew whom 
he could touch. Many who h.'.ve 
suffered the loss of their loved ones- 
have been able to endure it, because 
they had faith ; and had it touched 
other families, it might have 
wrecked them. The Lord knew 
who could stand this affliction, and 
so he has administered it, I be- 
lieve, for the wise purpose of call- 
ing us unto him, calling us back to 
the standards of our fathers. 

I glory in the achievements of 
the past. I glory in the material 
growth and .development of this 
Church. It shall not suffer under 
the administration of the man 
whom the Lord has called now to 
lead and direct the affairs of this 
Church ; for he is competent fully 
to take care of those matters. But 
I do feel, brethren and sisters, that 
there is dansrer that in the material 
growth of this Church we may lose 
sight of the other features that are 
more essential. I feel there is 
danger, in the midst of this material 
prosperity, that we may be dis- 
posed to build ourselves up finan- 
cially rather than to devote our- 
selves to the accomplishment of 
the great work that the Lord laid 
upon the shoulders of our fathers, 
namely, to convert the world and 
to save ourselves. The financial 
prosperity that has come to the 
Latter-day Saints is but a stepping- 
stone, if we only consider it prop- 
erly, to prepare us to fulfil the 



great obligations that rest upon us, 
and not to excuse ourselves from 
carrying the message of the gospel 
to a world whom the Lord is trash- 
ing, and whom he will thrash. Let 
us prepare our hearts to go when 
the time shall come, and make the 
kind of sacrifice our fathers have 
made, and do our part in spreading 
the truth among the nations of the 
earth. This is my earnest desire. 

I bear witness that this is the 
Lord's work ; that he is at the helm. 
The light is in the ship, and it will 
go steadily forward. I know, as I 
know that I live, that this is the 
work of our Father. I know that 
Jesus Christ lives, that he is the 
Redeemer and Savior of the world. 
I know it as well as I know that I 
look upon your faces today. When 
the day shall come that, like 
Thomas of old, I may thrust my 
hand into his side or feel the prints 
of the nails in his hands and feet; 
or like Mary, I may bathe his feet 
with my tears, I shall not know it 
any better than I know it today ; 
for I know that he lives, that he is 
the redeemer of the world and that 
he did speak to the' Prophet Joseph 
Smith. I know that this is the 
Lord's work; that he is in it, and 
it will rise triumphant and go for- 
ward. 

My heart rejoices in the privil- 
ege of being identified with this 
work. T feel thankful that I have 
the confidence and the love of my 
brethren, and oh, my heart rejoices 
that I do have their love and confi- 
dence. I felt very humble in my 
soul when President Grant in- 
formed me, as I stated yesterday, 
that the Lord had made it known 
to him that I should continue my 
labors in the ministry, and that I 
should be one of the special witnes- 
ses of the Lord Jesus, and I said: 



* 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD

"President Grant, if I thought I 
could be worthy to be pne of the 
special witnesses of the Lord, Jesus, 
it would be the happiest moment of 
my life ; for I esteem that the high- 
est honor that could come to man.'' 
But my ideal of the kind of men 
'they ought to be was so great, and 
I found myself not measuring up 
to that standard, which I have in 
my own mind. Yet, with the help 
of the Lord and the patience of 
my brethren, I will do as I have 
said : I will try to be what you want 
me to be — a servant of the people ; 
and with all the power and strength 
of my mind and soul I shall try 
to be faithful to this trust and to 
be a worthy representative of the 
Lord Jesus in the ■ earth. I feel 
small ; I feel little ; I feel insignifi- 
cant ; but knowing, as I have known 
through the thirteen years that 
I have spent in the missionary field, 
that the Lord will help the weak 
and make them strong, I depend 
upon him and your love, your fel- 
lowship and your support. I know 
this work will go forward. I know 
that the spirit of the prophet now 
rests upon the president of this 
Church ; that is my witness and 
testimony. The dogs may bark, 
but the grand, majestic Caravan, 
the Church of the living God, will 
move on triumphantly. God bless 
it forever and ever, and help us to 
keep loyal and true to it and put 
ourselves in the way so that we may 
receive the divine favor of our 
Fatherland escape the afflictions of 
the world. If we shall be faith- 
ful and true, I know that every 
promise and blessing that has been 
pronounced upon our heads will be 
realized and verified, which may 
God grant in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 



The choir ' and congregation 
sang: "For the strength of the 
hills," and the benediction was of- 
fered by Patriarch Frederick A. 
Mitchell. 



AFTERNOON SESSION. 

The conference was called to 
ord€r at 2 o'clock by President 
Heber J. Grant who presided. 

The choir and congregation 
sang the hymn : "Do what is 
right." 

Prayer was offered by Elder 
Lemuel H. Redd, Jr., president oi 
the San Juan stake. 

A quartette composed of 
Brothers Neilsen, Christensen, 
Plumeyer, and Holdaway sang : 
"Lead, kindly light." 

ELDER JOSEPH FIELDING 
SMITH 

Changes in life must come — Con- 
vinced of the divinity of the. mis- 
sion of Joseph Smith — The Solemn 
Assembly an inspiring sight — Order 
of the Church in choosing a Presi- 
dent — Testimony. 

My brethren and sisters, I have 
feelings of mingled sadness and 
joy in standing before you this 
afternoon. This conference, and 
the remarks that have been made by 
the various speakers, have brought 
to my memory many scenes of the 
past and I feel rather tender in my 
spirit. I realize perfectly that time 
is passing, that man's probation 
here, or, his days upon the earth, 
are limited, and when his work is 
finished, in the natural course of 
■things it is to be expected that he 
will be taken home. J accept the 
changes that come, rejoicing in the 



92 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



fact that the gospel which we have 
received is true. Changes of neces- 
sity must come, conditions vary, 
from day to day, and new scenes 
are bound to present themselves 
as time rolls on. 

All my life, from my earliest rec- 
ollection, I have accepted the mis- 
sion of the Prophet Joseph Smith, 
believed- in him, and accepted him 
as the servant of the Lord who 
was called and appointed to usher 
in this dispensation, known as the 
Dispensation of the Fulness of 
Times. Clothed with power from 
■on high, he was sent forth to de- 
clare the principles of the everlast- 
ing gospel to a perverse -world that 
they might, through repentance, 
come unto God and receive salva- 
tion in his kingdom. This great 
truth has, I say, always, from my 
earliest recollection, found an abid- 
ing place in my heart, and I have 
accepted every change that has 
come unto the Church until this 
time ; and now I find myself still 
in harmony with the work, with 
the sentiments of the Latter-day 
Saints, with my brethren who pre- 
side, because I am convinced in my 
heart that this is the work of God. 

It was an inspiring sight that we 
beheld yesterday forenoon in this 
building when the brethren hold- 
ing the priesthood in the various 
orders thereof were called upon to 
stand and express themselves by 
vote, either in favor of or against 
the presiding officers. I voted 
with full purpose of heart and with 
the determination, with the rest of 
you, to uphold and sustain the con- 
stituted authorities, to stand by 
them, because I realize that they 
hold the power and the priesthood 
which has descended from the day 
of the Prophet Joseph Smith, 



which the Lord has said will con- 
tinue upon the face of the earth 
until the end of time, and even then 
it shall not be taken away, for this 
priesthood is eternal. 

No man can preside in this 
Church in any capacity, without the 
consent of the people. The Lord 
has placed upon us the responsibil- 
ity of sustaining by vote those who 
are called, to various positions of 
responsibility. No man, should the 
people decide to the contrary, 
could preside over any body of Lat- 
ter-day Saints in this Church, and 
yet it is not the right of the peo- 
ple to nominate, to choose, for 
that is the right of the priesthood. 
The priesthood selects, under the 
inspiration of our Father in heaven, 
and then it is the duty of the Lat- 
ter-day Saints, as they are as- 
sembled in conference, or other 
capacity, by the uplifted hand, to 
sustain or to reject ; and I take it 
that no man has the right to raise 
his hand in opposition, or with con- 
trary vote, unless he has a reason 
for doing so that would be valid 
if presented before those who stand 
at the head. In other words, I have 
no right to raise my hand in op- 
position to a man who is appointed 
to any position in this Church, 
simply because I may not like him, 
or because of some personal disa- 
greement or feeling I may have, 
but only on the grounds that he is 
guilty of wrong doing, of trans- 
gression of the laws of the Church 
which would disqualify him for the 
position which he is called to hold. 
That is my understanding of it. 

I am glad to say that in raising 
my hand to sustain the authorities 
of the Church I can do that con- 
sistently and with pleasure, because 
I know that the men who are >

called to preside in the name of the 
Lord are qualified, and are chosen 
by divine revelation. There was a 
time in the history of the Church 
when doubts arose in the minds of 
many of the people at the time of 
the disorganization of the presi- 
dency of the Church. Such a thing 
as the disorganization of the First 
Presidency had never occurred be- 
fore, and many of the people were 
in doubt as to just what action 
should be taken. They wondered 
what the result would be. They 
were not acquainted, as perhaps 
they should have been, and as we 
are today, with the revelations 
which the Lord had given in regard 
to matters of that kind. There- 
fore, doubts arose in their minds. 
Men assumed authority and stood 
forth before the people demanding 
their attention and claiming the 
right of presidency. The matter, 
however, was properly .settled by 
the vote of the people, and Presi- 
dent Brigham Young, whose right 
it was, was sustained by the vote 
of the Latter-day Saints to stand 
at the head of the Church upon the 
earth. And yet it became necessary 
on that occasion, while President 
Young was speaking to the peo- 
ple, before the vote was taken, for 
the Lord to make it known by a 
manifestation that he was indeed 
the successor of the Prophet Joseph 
and that the mantle of his prede- 
cessor had fallen upon his shoul- 
ders. Such a thing as that is not 
required today because now we 
have learned the order of the 
Church ; we know what the revela- 
tions declare. We know just what 
will follow in case of the disor- 
ganization of any quorum of the 
priesthood, and the people are not 
in doubt. There is no reason now 



for u,s to be at cross purposes, to 
have a misunderstanding, to let 
doubts arise in our minds in re- 
igard to these matters, because 
everything is clear and everything 
will be followed in the order 
which the Lord has appointed. 
Now we move smoothly in the 
path of duty and accept the 
word of the Lord as it has been 
made known and as the under- 
standing has been impressed upon 
our minds, due very largely to the 
experience of the past. 

I am grateful and thankful for 
a testimony of the truth, notwith- 
standing the fact that the presence 
of this vast congregation in con- 
ference assembled and the remarks 
that have been made, bring to me 
'thoughts and reflections that touch 
iny heart, I have feelings of pleas- 
■ure and of joy beyond expression 
in the knowledge that I have that 
the Lord has established this work 
and that it will endure upon the 
face of the earth and shall not be 
destroyed, it shall not be given to 
another people. It is here perma- 
nently and shall remain until the 
Lord has finished his work among 
the children of men ; and then it 
will continue, for it is everlasting 
and shall never be destroyed. I 
know just as well as.it is possible 
for me, I believe, to know in this 
life, that Joseph Smith was a 
prophet of God. There is no doubt 
in my mind/ in the least that Brig- 
ham Young was called and ap- 
pointed to be his successor and that 
he presided over this people by the 
'will of God and was filled with the 
spirit of inspiration and prophecy. 
•So likewise it was with President 
John Taylor, President Wilford 
Woodruff, President Lorenzo 
Snow, and all others who have pre-

sided, and so it must be unto the 
end. The Lord will not permit any 
man to reach he presidency in this 
Church who is not prepared, who is 
not worthy, and whom he does not 
want. We may be assured of that. 
'And, therefore, I find myself, I say, 
in absolute harmony with you in the 
order of the priesthood, in the doc- 
trines of the Church, the revela- 
tions as they have been given unto 
us from the beginning, and I trust 
and pray that always I may have 
that spirit and be found faithfully 
laboring in the discharge of my 
duty as an officer and member in 
the Church in the salvation of 
souls, is my prayer in the name of 
Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER GERMAN E. ELLS- 
WORTH 

(Retiring President of the Northern 
States Mission.) 

I am deeply grateful, my breth- 
' ren and sisters, for the privilege of 
bearing my testimony to you con- 
cerning the work of the Latter-day 
Saints. It is my testimony that this 
work has been established by our 
Father in heaven, that he has se- 
lected men on the earth to fulfil cer- 
tain positions, and they have been 
acknowledged of him inasmuch as 
they have done their duty. I have 
now had the pleasure of filling two 
missions. I remember well when 
called to go upon my first mission, 
how I looked forward with great 
joy to my labors in that field. 

I remember from that field of 
labor I was shown in vision that I 
would not be home very long until 
called upon another mission, and 
despite, perhaps, my own efforts to- 
ward another line, that call came, 
and when one of the prophets of the 
Lord said to me that I was wanted 



as a missionary in the Northern 
-States mission, I told him I would 
go, and I can feel now the joy and 
happiness that filled my heart. Be- 
fore going upon that mission, in 
fast meeting, one of the good mem- 
bers of the ward manifested in 
tongues: "My servant German E. 
Ellsworth has been called by my 
authority, and acknowledged of me, 
as a missionary to the Northern 
States." That much was given to 
the congregation in the interpreta- 
tion, but there was a part of that 
manifestation that was never given 
to the congregation, that has always 
been a source of joy and happiness 
to me during the past sixteen years. 
It has been a great help to me in 
talking to young missionaries, who 
sometimes had the idea that they 
had been called just by some bishop, 
to go on a mission. I have without 
hesitation told them that every sin- 
gle one of us has been called by 
men, bishops, stake presidents, 
apostles and others in the Church, 
but our call had come finally from 
the president of the Church of Jesus 
Christ, who was God's mouthpiece 
in the earth, and that all who are 
called would be acknowledged by 
the Lord wherever they went, if 
they would go and do their duty. 

As I stand before you now there 
comes to my mind a dream of my 
boyhood, wherein I might have de- 
sired many things and planned 
many things, but I can remember 
that my prayers always ended : 
"Father, above all thy blessings, 
grant me the privilege of being a 
teacher of righteousness and a 
preacher of the gospel of Jesus 
Christ." That desire and prayer 
has largely been fulfilled, having 
had already eighteen years of pleas- 
ure and happiness in preaching and 
teaching the gospel in company 



ELDER GERMAN 

with hundreds of the best men and 
women of the earth. I remember 
one time standing in the dusty road 
of California alone, hungry and 
weary, having almost gone to the 
limit of my strength, when my eyes 
opened, and standing by my side 
was a messenger of our Father, 
and if the influence of his presence 
had not been strength enough for 
me to lean upon — I was close 
enough to have put my hand upon 
his shoulder. I have known other 
missionaries in the field who have 
been weary and discouraged who 
have likewise had their eyes opened 
to see the fulfilment of our Fath- 
er's promise that he will send his 
messengers before our face and 
lead us to the doors of those who 
are prepared to receive us. I bear 
witness, my brethren and sisters, 
that our Father has fulfilled this 
promise in my life and in the lives 
of the missionaries who have la- 
bored with me. There have been 
one or two special lines of mission- 
ary work that have been sources 
of great joy and happiness to me in 
my labors. 

Shortly after going to the North- 
ern States Mission I received an 
impression of the Lord concerning 
the Book of Mormon, of which I 
would like to bear testimony before 
the Latter-day Saints. It came to 
me as strong as if someone of my 
fellow missionaries had told it to 
me, that the Book of Mormon had 
been given of the Lord as a wit- 
ness to this generation and that if 
we would remember it, that we 
would come out from under the 
condemnation that, as we are told, 
rested upon Zion; and then I re- 
called reading in the Doctrine and 
Covenants in the 84th section, be- 
ginning with the 54th verse, where- 



E. ELLSWORTH 95 

in the Church and some of the 
early leaders of the Church, 
because of their unbelief in 
the Book of Mormon, I take 
it, were under condemnation 
and would needs remain so until 
they repented and remembered the 
new covenant, even the Book of 
Mormon. It was not long after 
that until, with the co-operation of 
two other missions, we published 
10,000 Books of Mormon in Chi- 
cago, followed the next year by 
12,000, and the following year by 
27,000. The interest had so grown 
that bids were secured from New 
York, Chicago, Philadelphia, Bos- 
ton, London and Japan for a 100,- 
000 edition, with Chicago the low- 
est bidder. This perhaps is the 
largest number of that sacred, rec- 
ord to be printed at one time. In 
all, 250,000 Books of Mormon were 
printed in Chicago before it was 
taken over by Zion's Printing & 
Publishing Co. We have distributed 
130,000 Books of Mormon in the 
Northern States mission, 90,000 of 
which have been sold, and it is my 
testimony that every man and 
woman who has taken to heart the 
distribution of the Book of Mor- 
mon, taken to heart the teaching 
of . the Book of Mormon, and the 
pointing out of the gems in that 
record to the people of the earth, 
have made a more wonderful 
growth than any other missionaries 
in the field. I can look back now 
over the mission and call to mind 
the young men who have taken hold 
of it with a vim and gone before 
the people, bearing witness of it, 
that the Lord was with and blessed 
them above all other missionaries. 

I remember while standing on 
the Hill Cumorah, of hearing these 
words, "Push the distribution of 
the record that was taken from this 



96 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



hill, for it will help bring the world 
to Christ;" and as the Bible has 
"Christianized," as we term it to- 
day, many nations, so also will the 
Book of Mormon bring the world 
another long step towards member- 
ship in the Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints. I went im- 
mediately to Palmyra and secured 
postcard pictures of the hill and 
sent one to each of my missionaries, 
writing on each one the words sug- 
gested to my mind and the mission- 
aries caught the real spirit of it and 
made that year one of the largest in 
Book of Mormon distribution we 
made in the Northern States. 

One other feature of missionary 
work in the Northern States from 
which we have drawn a great deal 
of joy and satisfaction has been the 
genealogical work among the 
Saints. Seventy per cent of the 
families in the mission have been 
induced to make and keep a family 
record, and many families have 
contributed in the last four years, 
through the Relief Society, under 
the direction of Sister Ellsworth, 
about ten thousand names for tem- 
ple ordinances. This work has 
brought a wonderful spirit of unity 
and good feeling one toward an- 
other, and has drawn the hearts of 
the Saints nearer towards the gos- 
pel than anything that has been 
done. 

I am happy to have had the 
privilege of associating, so closely, 
with the men whom God has hon- 
ored in the earth to be the leaders 
of his people. I can feel now the 
hand of President Smith upon my 
back and hear his words when I 
'was going away upon this mission. 
When I told him that I had desired 
from a boy to become a physician 
he said : "Never mind, my boy, you 



go on this mission, and we will 
make you a minister of righteous 
ness and a savior of the souls of 
men, instead of the body." And his 
"The Lord bless you, my boy," 
which was repeated last October, 
has been worth more to me than 
the treasures of the earth. 

I now bear witness to you, my 
brethren and sisters, that President 
Heber J. Grant is the prophet of 
the Lord ; for my Father in heaven 
bore witness to that fact in my soul ; 
so that my heart could easily fol- 
low my hand from President Smith 
to President Grant, as the man to 
stand at the head of the Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints, and all those who will fol- 
low the counsel of those who are 
called now to preside over them 
shall be acknowledged of the Lord 
in their labor. 

It has been a source of happiness 
beyond my language to describe 
to labor with 1500 young rnen and 
young women who have been ap- 
pointed to labor in that mission. 
Out of that number only three 
have stumbled in the path, and even 
they have been reclaimed to lives 
of honor and integrity in' the 
Church. We have had sorrow in 
the death and burial of five : two in 
the last year, from this dreadful 
malady, influenza, the other three 
over the remainder of our time 
there. 

I rejoice in my testimony of the 
gospel. I rejoice in the power and 
influence of my Father, that I have 
felt in times of need. I rejoice for 
the measure of success that has at- 
tended us in our labors, and for the 
privilege of laboring so closely in 
connection with the brethren who 
have been honored of God to pre- 
side over the Church of Jesus Christ

of Latter-day Saints. I know that 
God lives, I know that Jesus Christ 
is the Son of God, beyond all shad- 
ow of doubt. I have known that 
from my boyhood, and there ?s no 
witness in my soul so great as that 
Christ is the Son of God, and that 
this is his work. My testimony is 
that Joseph Smith was a prophet of 
God, called by our Father to be the 
instrument in his hands in establish- 
ing the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints. It is my testi- 
mony to you that the sweetest thing 
in all the world is to be a witness of 
the truth or an instrument in the 
hands of God in' bringing men and 
women to the light that has been re- 
stored to the earth for the salvation 
of the souls of men. God bless 
Zion. Help us, in this hour of dark- 
ness and distress to arise and mag- 
nify our callings, and be a light set 
upon a hill that all the world will 
rejoice in this dark hour. God bless 
those who preside over the Church. 
Give them power and influence, and 
may they feel our sustaining influ- 
ence and our uplifted hands sup- 
porting them, until the glory of God 
rests upon Zion, I pray, in the name 
of Jesus Christ. Amen. . 

ELDER WINSLOW F. SMITH 

(President of the Northern States 
Mission.) 

In listening to the testimonies 
that have been borne during this 
conference, I feel that I have been 
beneHted and I feel more than 
ever before the responsibility of the 
calling that has. come to me. I have 
never doubted the - divinity of "Mor- 
monism," so-called. I have never 
doubted the standing of the men 
called to preside. I have never 
hesitated to give unto them the 



greatest support that I have had, 
and I feel, in standing here today, 
to bear my testimony to you, my 
brethren and sisters and friends, 
that 1 do so with the support of 
these men that I have supported. 

Today in coming to this meeting 
I met a friend on the car who said : 
"How do you like to tear up home 
and go away?" I said: "I don't 
like it from the idea of tearing up 
home, but I do like it when it is 
in the line of my duty." I have 
always felt, my brethren and sis- 
ters, that the mission work of our 
Church is a source of its great 
strength. I have felt, ever since 
my experience in the mission field, 
fourteen years ago, that I was a 
better man for having gone and for 
having labored, and have said, time 
and time again, if no soul under 
heaven was benefited by my mis- 
sionary experience, I, myself, was 
benefited, for I had joy, comfort 
and happiness and I had brought 
unto me an appreciation of the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints that could have come 
to me in no other manner. 

I tell you, my brethren and sis- 
ters, that ours is essentially a mis- 
sionary Church; that unto us, a 
little handful of people, compared 
with the inhabitants of the earth, 
has been given the responsibility 
and the calling of preaching the 
gospel of Jesus Christ unto the 
whole world; and I tell you, my 
brethren and sisters, and I say it in 
earnestness and in candor, that the 
members here at home who are not 
doing their duty, who are not striv- 
ing to teach by precept, by example, 
to those with whom they come in 
contact, are not measuring up to 
the full measure of their calling, 
and they are not getting the joy out 
of life that they are entitled to.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



My work in life, since coming 
home from the mission field, has 
taken "me into many of the stakes 
of Zion, and I have always made it 
a rule to attend service wherever 
I have been, and have found in the 
services where I have gone that the 
Spirit, the same that I knew in the 
mission field, was to be found. I 
have felt when called upon to speak 
to the Saints that I have spoken 
with the same freedom and the 
same help that I enjoyed while in 
the mission field, and I say this 
now, and in all candor, that I have 
enjoyed' it. I have met many peo- 
ple not of our faith and have re- 
joiced that I had the knowledge to 
talk to them fairly intelligently on 
the principles which we believe in. 

I say, my brethren and sisters, 
there are too many of us inclined to 
stand back. I love to say with 
Paul: "I am not ashamed of the 
gospel of Christ ; for it is the power 
of God unto salvation to everyone 
that believeth." I feel this in my 
very being, I rejoice in it, and I 
take pleasure in every opportunity, 
regardless of who the person may 
be, of talking on the principles of 
the gospel, as I believe them. It 
brings me joy, and I see it gives 
them light, it opens their eyes, and 
I know of occasions where people 
have been turned toward us and 
our people through my weak effort. 
I don't mean by this, brethren and 
sisters,that every time we meet with 
a person accidentally we must im- 
mediately burden him with the 
principles of the gospel, but I do 
mean that every time the opportun- 
ity presents itself by some person 
putting "that little question that 
comes," that we should be ready, 
and not only ready, but willing to 
let that person know what "Mor- 



monism" is and where we stand in 
regard to the Church. 

If we will cultivate faith, if we 
will humiliate ourselves, if we will 
strive to do our duty, if we will 
study and prepare our minds, when 
that opportunity does come we will 
be ready, and our readiness and our 
'doing will surprise us and, as I 
'have said before, give us far 
greater joy than we have ever 
dreamed of. Only a month or two 
ago I stayed in a hotel in a neigh- 
boring state until one o'clock in the 
morning talking our religion with 
a man who had neyer heard it, and 
I tell you, brethren and sisters, it 
was a pleasure, it was a joy, when 
that man said to me: "I am 
mighty glad that the things that I 
had heard of your Church are not 
true. I like you, I like your way, 
and I am going down into your 
state when I get nearer to it some- 
time and see what you have really 
done there." Now, that is only one 
opportunity. We have them every 
day or two and the opportunity is 
here right in our own state. Those 
of our associates whom we meet 
would be glad and willing to learn 
if we would put the question up to 
them in such a manner that they 
could not resist it. As we are walk- 
ing along the street, one can say: 
"Why, there is that building, one of 
the oldest buildings in our town, 
that was built by so and so," and 
immediately the opportunity is 
there for a little explanation. 

Brethren and sisters, it is the 
greatest work in the world. There 
is absolutely no sacrifice that we 
can make that we should consider 
too great, in working in the vine- 
yard of the Lord. It is the great- 
est thing on earth, and right now, 
today, is our time, the opportunity

is ours, and' not only the opportu- 
nity but the responsibility is ours to 
preach the gospel of Jesus Christ 
to the nations of the earth. I thank 
the Lord that I have been called 
again to go into the mission field, 
and I pray that I may be worthy, 
that I may measure up to the 
standard, that I may go forth in 
humility and with prayerful heart, 
that I may study and learn, and that 
I may follow brother Ellsworth in 
the work and carry it on as well as 
he has done in the mission field. 

I support the brethren who have 
been called and whom we have sus- 
tained. I am back of them in their 
every act. I do not question them. 
I am confident that they are ser- 
vants of the living God, and the 
little help that I may give will be as 
nothing, but it is there, and it is 
theirs. I want to do my share, and I 
believe in doing this, that they will 
support -me, that they will help me; 
and, though I will be some distance 
from here, from the center stake, 
that their spirit and their prayers 
will be with me and help me. And, 
so, my brethren and sisters, I pray 
God to help us' to appreciate our 
calling and our responsibility. I 
pray that he may give us his. Spirit, 
that through it we may work and 
never tire, that our efforts shall 
never cease until the gospel of 
Jesus Christ shall be proclaimed to 
every man and woman and child on 
the earth ; and, brethren and sisters, 
if we will do our share God will 
bless us and make us happy. I ask 
it in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT. 

They say "Mormonism" dies out 
in the third and fourth generation. 
You have just been listening to one 
of the fifth generation. 



President Grant referring to the 
old saying that the third generation 
would apostatize from the Church 
remarked that the people had 
just been listening to the fifth 
generation — Winslow Smith. His 
line runs as follows : ( 1 ) Asahel 
Smith; (2) John Smith; (3) 
George A. Smith; (4) John Henry 
Smith; (5) Winslow F. Smith. 

The President then referred to 
the fact that the present Presiding 
Patriarch of the Church is the sixth 
generation. His line runs as fol- 
lows: (1) Asahel Smith; (2) 
Joseph Smith; (3) Hyrum 
Smith; (4) John Smith; (5) 
Hyrum F. Smith; (6) Hyrum G. 
Smith. 

ELDER GEORGE W. McCUNE 

(President of the Eastern States Mis- 
sion.) 

My dear brethren and sisters. 
It is indeed an honor to stand be- 
fore such a vast congregation of 
Latter-day Saints, and I earnestly 
desire your faith and prayers that 
the few words I utter in your pres- 
ence may be acceptable to the Lord. 
As our colored brother would say: 
I feel "powerful weak" in standing 
before you. I feel weak in myself, 
but I realize that my strength is in 
the Lord. I have not been called 
to this position of my own seeking, 
but, having been called by the ser- 
vants of the Lord, I have put my 
trust in God and feel determined to 
go forth and do the very best I 
can. I know that if I do this all 
will be well; for, as expressed by 
our beloved president yesterday 
morning, surely the Lord God will 
make no requirements at the hands 
of his se'rvants except he provide a 
way for the fulfilment or accomp- 
lishment of that thing ; and so, with 



100 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



the help of the Lord, I am going 
out to preach the gospel in the 
Eastern States mission. I feel that 
the paramount thing for us as Lat- 
ter-day Saints today is the preach- 
ing of the gospel to the nations of 
the earth ; and, as explained by el- 
der Ballard here this morning, the 
chastening hand of God has been 
outstretched in the world, the Lord 
has been speaking to us through 
these terrible afflictions of war, 
famine, pestilence and diseases, and 
surely the Lord will expect his ser- 
vants to be the^e crying repentance 
unto these people when they are 
humbled in their spirits, when they 
are ready to turn to him. The 
Lord will expect us to be there cry- 
ing repentance unto them, giving 
them the opportunity to go in at the 
gateway. I urge upon you to be 
ready to make the sacrifices that are 
necessary to take this great mes- 
sage to the nations of the earth. 

I was very much gratified the day 
before I left New York, when one 
of the elders who is to accompany 
elder Smith to Europe came to me 
and said that his brother, who has 
been a prosperous farmer in Wy- 
oming, sent word to me that he had 
leased his farm out and was com- 
ing to the Eastern States mission, 
bringing his wife and daughter and 
two sons, all of whom would be 
engaged in the missionary work. I 
honestly believe that this man is in- 
vesting his earnings, his profits, his 
time, and his talents, in the most 
judicious manner possible. It may 
be that his associates, in the town 
where he resides, will make more 
money within the next few years, 
but still I believe that this good 
brother has acted wisely and that 
his investment will bring him 
greater dividends, they will bring 
him greater returns from every 



standpoint, except that of mere 
money. I believe he will so estab- 
lish his family in the Church and 
kingdom of God that great bless- 
ings will come unto them for gen- 
erations to come, through this mis- 
sion he is taking. 

My brethren and sisters, I know 
that this is the work of the Lord 
that we are engaged in. God has 
revealed this unto me. The Spirit 
of the Lord has testified to every 
fibre of my being, and to my soul, 
that Joseph Smith is a prophet of 
God, and those who have succeeded 
him in the presidency of our 
Church are his rightful successors, 
that Heber J. Grant today is the 
mouthpiece of God on earth. He 
having called me to this position, I 
gladly respond, and though it 
seemed like a great sacrifice at first, 
I feel, as expressed by Elder Smith, 
to rejoice that the Lord has called 
me ; and now that the first step has 
been taken, and I have broken 
loose from the influence of the 
world and have partaken of the 
spirit and the joy of missionary 
work, I feel grateful to my father 
in heaven that I have been con- 
sidered worthy to take this mission. 
I am very glad indeed that I am 
going. I want to assure my 
brethren of the First Presidency 
and the Twelve, and all of the pre- 
siding brethren, that they have my.' 
hearty support, that they have my 
love and my friendship. The same 
is true of you, my brethren and sis- 
ters, and all mankind. Toward you 
I have nothing in my heart but love 
and good fellowship. I pray that 
God will bless you and that he will 
bless me and give me the spirit of 
my calling; that when your sons 
and your daughters shall come to 
the Eastern States mission, that I 
may have wisdom to give them in- 



ELDER GEORGE W. McCUNE

structions that will make them 
strong in the fight for truth and 
righteousness. Brethren and sis- 
ters, support me to this end, and I 
know that this thing will be ac- 
complished. 

May God add his blessings to all 
that has been said today, that our 
hearts may be made to rejoice, that 
the young and the old may be able 
to stand up and say, as one of old 
has said, "I know that my Re- 
deemer liveth, and that he shall 
stand at the latter day upon the 
earth : And though after my skin 
worms destroy this body, yet in my 
flesh shall I see. God." I pray that 
this may be our happy lot, that we 
may be firm in the fight for truth 
and righteousness, and I pray for 
these things in Jesus' name.. Amen. 

ELDER WALTER P. MONSON 

(Retiring President of the Eastern 
States Mission.) 

While walking down Broadway, 
one day, a newsboy ran into me. I 
asked him . if he could not see me, 
and he said: "I can see you with 
my naked eye." I am inclined to 
think that President Grant also can 
see me, though I get in the back 
end of the gallery. 

I assure you, my brethren and 
sisters, that this is a very pleasur- 
able opportunity, afforded, me this 
afternoon to mingle my humble 
testimony with the testimonies that 
have already been borne during 
this conference. I uphold and sus- 
tain the work of the Lord with all 
my heart. The Spirit of the Lord 
bears witness to my spirit that what 
was done in our forenoon meeting 
yesterday is of the Lord. I have 
always taken great pleasure in 
standing before the public com- 
mitting myself to my public utter- 
ances. Therein, I believe, lies 



much of the strength of the .Church 
in the developing of integrity of 
heart and character which stand's 
for right. I, too, have spent a num- 
ber of years in the ministry, years 
that have been the happiest of my 
life. In the year 1898, I was called, 
not by receiving a Box "B" letter, 
but called by President George Q. 
Cannon in a conference that was 
being held in Franklin, Idaho. I 
was set apart within a few minutes 
after the call, and was told that my 
place was in the Northwestern 
states. One month after the call I 
was pursuing my labors. After 
completing my mission there, to the 
satisfaction of those who presided 
over me, I returned to my home, 
entered into pursuits of life which 
I had chosen, and was allowed 'to 
remain home nine years, when the 
call came for me to go to England. 
I labored there upward of two 
years and found increasing joy 
with the increasing time spent in 
the service of the master. After 
completing that mission I was at 
home twenty-eight months, when 
the call came again to break up 
home and go to the Eastern States. 
My brethren and sisters, I can not 
tell you the humility which I felt, 
and the timidity with which I en- 
tered upon my labors. It seemed 
to me that if there was ever an at- 
tempt to fit a square peg in a round 
hole, the attempt was being made 
on that occasion. Yet, I have en- 
deavored to perform my labors to 
the best of my ability, and if I have 
made mistakes it should be 
accredited to the human weakness 
which we all have. In my last 
missionary labors I have felt even 
greater joy than I felt on my two 
preceding missions. I want to be 
one with the Latter-day Saints at 
home or abroad, wherever I am. I

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



rejoice in the testimony of the gos- 
pel which the Lord has instilled 
into my heart, and which I feel has 
influenced my life for good, that 
has awakened within me the con- 
sciousness of right and wrong. I 
have observed, in my past life, in 
fact, it was one of my earliest ob- 
servations, that when the Lord 
called any one to any position in his 
work him he. qualified. How many 
of us have seen bishops and stake 
presidents called in their young 
manhood and who, upon assuming 
their duties, have stood solidly and 
equal to the task that has been im- 
posed upon them. They have been 
able to counsel in righteousness 
those who, from a standpoint of 
years, are old enough to be their 
fathers and their grandfathers. 

I bespeak for Brother McCune 
in his appointment as mission pres- 
ident the support of the Saints and 
the missiona'ries of the Eastern 
states mission, which is now upon 
the verge, I believe, of a tremend- 
ous and beautiful growth. We have 
had nothing to do with the publica- 
tion of the literature of the missions 
of the United States, such as has 
been the experience of and as re- 
ported by President Ellsworth, but 
we have opened up a number of 
branches. We have worked dili- 
gently, though our reports may not 
show what other mission reports 
might show.' It must be under- 
stood that the intolerance of the 
United States seems to have been 
crowded into the northeastern 
part, and I do not know where it 
can go unless it sinks into the ocean 
after a few more years' efficient 
work there. We have met with a 
great deal of opposition. The Lord 
has sustained us. Our young men, 
many of them, say they have 
come to the mission field to gain a 



testimony — I can not believe this, 
my brethren and sisters, though 
that is the method of their express- 
ing themselves — I believe every son 
and daughter of the Lord who has 
been born under the covenant, with 
the promises of the covenant upon 
their heads, that they come into this 
world with nobility of spirit and' 
with a testimony which requires 
only development. That develop- 
ment can come by the service which 
we devote to the blessing of our 
fellow men and the establishing of 
the work of the Lord among our 
heavenly Father's children. My 
heart is filled with joy and glad- 
ness in knowing that I have kept 
close enough, at least, to the pre- 
scribed rule of the Church, to re- 
tain my testimony. I know that 
God lives, that he is a re- 
warder of them that diligently 
seek him. I know that his hand 
is over this people; even though 
trials may come which might 
seem difficult to surmount, . he will 
bear us off triumphant in the de- 
dree that we will place our 
whole-souled dependence upon him. 
I bear testimony that Jesus Christ 
is the savior of the world, the only 
begotten of the Father in the flesh ; 
that he died for mankind and that 
he has given unto us a plan of life 
and salvation, which plan is be- 
ing advocated in the world today 
by those whom the Lord calls as 
missionaries, as well as those who 
preside and preach at home. I also 
bear witness that the powers of the 
Holy Spirit have not been abridged 
or abrogated, that they are as man- 
ifest in the Church today ly the 
healing of the sick and the raising 
of those who are downcast in spirit, 
restoring their souls, leading them 
in the ways of peace and happi- 
ness, as it was ever its mission to do 



ELDER JOHN L. HERRICK

in any former generation. I bear 
witness to you and solemnly testify 
that if I know anything whatsoever 
in this world, I do positively know 
that Joseph Smith was a prophet 
of the true and the living God, 
raised up in our day and time for 
the ushering in of the dispensation 
of the fulness of times, when all 
dispensations of the past shall be 
brought in with their especial and 
peculiar blessings. I bear witness 
to you that those who have suc- 
ceeded the prophet Joseph Smith 
were also prophets, seers and reve- 
lators, upheld and sustained by the 
power of Almighty God. I bear 
witness to you today that Heber J. 
Grant, whom we have voted to sus- 
tain, as the leader of this Church, 
is the prophet, seer and revelator 
of the Church, and that the mantle 
of authority has fallen upon him, 
and, that he, too, is qualified in full 
measure to lead and direct the work 
of the Lord that is being performed 
by this people. This Church has 
its peculiar mission, two-fold as it 
is, in not only carrying the gospel 
to the ends of the earth to those 
who have not the gospel, but also 
in perfecting those who are mem- 
bers of the Church. Now may the 
peace of our heavenly Father rest 
upon all Israel, at home and 
abroad, that they may see more 
clearly the plans and purposes that 
he has wrought for the salvation 
of the human family. May we keep 
our covenants sacred and always 
live worthy of the approbation of 
our heavenly Father, that we 
may claim his blessings, is my 
humble prayer, and I ask it in the 
name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

ELDER JOHN L. HERRICK 

(Retiring President of the Western 
States Mission.) 

If it were possible, I feel more 
today the need of your faith than 
I did when I occupied this stand 
in a like capacity a little over ten 
years ago. In many ways we have 
realized the truth of the words of 
our Lord and Master in saying: 
"And every one that hath forsaken 
houses, or brethren, or sisters or 
father, or mother, or "wife, or chil- 
dren, or lands, for my name's sake, 
shall receive an hundredfold, and 
shall inherit everlasting life." What 
we failed to receive, I have faith 
that we will receive, anc" the bless- 
ings of the Lord will come to us in 
such measure as we deserve. Not 
in a material sense have we in- 
creased an hundredfold — for I have 
been connected with no business 
during that time, other than mis- 
sion work, but in divers ways, we 
have been the recipients of such 
blessings that it is beyond my power 
to describe. I entered upon the du- 
ties of a mission, under a blessing 
from President Anthon H. Lund, 
and I acknowledge to you today 
that I have received the blessings 
that he promised at that time. I 
acknowledge also to you that the 
blessings that were promised to my 
wife have been more than realized 
upon her head ; and next to tht 
inspiration that has come to me, 
through the ministration of Christ, 
the efforts of my wife have been one 
of the greatest sources of support 
and helpfulness. "Life will give 
us back whatever we put into it," 
said a prominent writer. "In many 
ways, it is like a bank. Put joy into 
the world and it will come back to 
you with compound interest; but 
you cannot check out either money 



104 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



or happiness unless you have made 
deposits. If you put in joy and 
love, unselfishness and a little laugh- 
ter and faith, they'll all come back 
some day." 

I need hardly go into details at 
this time, to tell you what we have 
accomplished in the Western States 
mission, and I think it is not looked 
for. Suffice it to say that we have 
increased the population nearly four 
times, and the receipts about ten 
times. In turning over the mission 
to our sucsessor, President John M. 
Knight, we' can only hope that he 
will find there a responsive chord in 
the hearts and the minds of the peo- 
ple. I believe he will find the going 
comparatively easy, although I am 
sure that from now on we may look 
for greater success in the mission 
fields, than ever before. I confi- 
dently look for it. I believe the 
time is at hand when men of under- 
standing and men of power and in- 
fluence will go forth in full purpose 
of heart, and in the authority of 
God will bring untold thousands to 
a knowledge of the truth. 

I acknowledge with deep grati- 
tude my connection with by breth- 
ren, the mission presidents. It has 
ever been a source of joy and of sat- 
isfaction to labor with them. They 
are -men of God and whether they 
remain in the field or go elsewhere, 
my prayer and my good wishes shall 
always be with them. 

I regard highly and am deeply 
grateful for the association that I 
ha' 1 with the late President Joseph 
F. Smith and his associates, his 
counselors, and T am no less grate- 
ful for even a brief association with 
those who have been chosen to suc- 
ceed him. This work will go on. 
The man who stands at the head 
of the Church today is the appointed 



of the Lord, and he will lead this 
Church with just as much wisdom 
as the first prophet in the last dis- 
pensation, according to its needs. 
These men who have been selected 
for the Council of the Twelve are 
all wonderful characters, and I feel 
it a compliment to the missions that 
one of their number has been chosen 
to be an apostle in this day. 

I bear you my witness to the 
knowledge that has come to me of 
the divinity of this work. It is 
truly the Lord's work. His servant, 
Joseph Smith, was divinely called, 
divinely inspired, and he was led in 
all his acts by the wisdom of the 
Almighty. My testimony has grown 
with the months and years of serv- 
ice, and I do not regret one mo- 
ment of tb" tivre that we have put 
in the service of the Church. 

If I may be permitted to say it; I 
want to refer to the overpowering 
thought that came to me in the last 
few months of our mission work, 
and I have not hesitated to speak 
of it among our people in the world ; 
and that is that we should stand as 
a bulwark in defense of this nation. 
We should stand bv him who is at 
the head of it at this critical pe- 
riod, just as we should support Our 
, leader who sits upon this stand 
today, and believe me I do not say 
it in any partisan spirit. I say it 
because I firmly believe that jn the 
culmination of this great world 
peaee conference; a League of Na- 
tions is to come and it will be a 
step forward in the interest of hu- 
manity — a step forward in the in- 
terest of religion. In It we can 
realize in a sense that we are ap- 
proaching the day that we have 
long dreamed of and hoped for, 
when there should be a universal 
peace. God hasten the day, and let 



ELDER JOHN M. KNIGHT

us realize the importance of this 
unique work. Let us resolve, if 
the time comes, that it needs our 
support, that we* should cast our 
vote and use- our influence in order 
that the world may be made better 
and safer to live in, better to live 
in than ever before. 

Grant, O Lord, blessings to this 
people, to thine appointed servants, 
and hasten the advancement of 
thy great work established in the 
world, I pray in the name of Jesus. 
Amen. 

ELDER JOHN M. KNIGHT 

(President of the Western States 
Mission.) 

The testimonies that have been 
borne during the sessions of this 
conference have impressed me as X 
have never been impressed before. 
I am grateful for the fellowship 
that I have with you, my brethren 
and sisters. 

As I witnessed the magnificent 
assembly on Sunday morning, and 
realized that assembled on that oc- 
casion was the best body of men 
that could be brought together un- 
der heaven, I thanked God for my 
fellowship and association with you. 
I was grateful in my heart for the 
testimony of the truth that has been 
borne in upon my life. I was grate- 
ful unto my Father for the belief 
that I had in the mission of his Son, 
the Redeemer of mankind, and 1 
thanked the Lord that the oppor- 
tunity had come again to me to go 
forth to the nations of the earth and 
bear witness of the restored gospel 
of the Lord Jesus Christ. 

It was my good fortune, in 1895, 
to be called upon a mission. I had 
desired, like the other brethren, 
from my early childhood to preach 



the gospel of repentance to the na- 
tions of the earth. My grandfather 
and many of my relatives had been 
active in the mission field. My 
grandfather had filled four missions 
abroad. I had listened to the testi- 
mony that he bore concerning the 
gospel, concerning the Prophet 
Joseph Smith, and the other men 
who were instruments in establish- 
ing this work in the earth. I be- 
lieved it, with all my heart, and it 
was my desire to proclaim that 
truth to the nations of the earth. I 
found joy unspeakable, when I first 
went into, the mission field, in testi- 
fying to the world that there was 
need of a new revelation from God, 
that there was need of a new 
prophet in this dispensation, and 
that Joseph Smith was that prophet. 
I never felt to apologize for the 
faith that I had in "Mormonism." 
It was a pleasure to testify that it 
came to the forefront without any 
apology whatsoever for its exist- 
ence. It was a pleasure to invite all 
men to make the fullest and freest 
investigation of all its principles, its 
doctrines, its precepts and com- 
mandments, and to declare unto 
them that if they would have faith 
in God and repent of their sins, 
they might know the truth, and the 
truth would make them free. 

I rejoice in the testimony of the 
gospel that has come into my life. 
I know that it is true. I know that 
Jesus is the Redeemer of the world, 
and that Joseph Smith was his 
prophet. I have faith and confi- 
dence in the presiding brethren of 
the Church. I uphold and sustain 
them with all my heart. I have not 
only rejoiced, my brethren and sis- 
ters, in laboring in the ministry 
abroad but I have had satisfaction 
in laboring at home. I have had 
just as much joy come into my life 



106 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



in giving service to the cause in the 
Stakes of Zion where I have lived, 
as I received in the mission field, 
and I have felt that we should give 
service to the Church. I have fully 
felt compensated for all the efforts 
and service I have ever given to 
the Church. What we call sacrifice 
to me was no sacrifice at all, be- 
cause I have been repaid for every 
effort that I have put forth. 

I shall go into the mission field 
in the humility of my neart, and en- 
deavor in my weak way to accomp- 
lish the mission that is laid upon me 
I testify to you, my brethren and 
sicters, that I have full faith in the 
gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ, and 
that it is my desire io preach the 
gospel of repentance to the people 
of this generation. May the bless- 
ings of heaven attend you in all of 
your undertakings, and may God's 
choicest blessings attend the presid- 
ing authorities of the Church ; may 
they have power and influence with 
the Latter-day Saints, and may we 
have a disposition to put into prac- 
tice in our daily lives the instruc- 
tions that we receive from them. 
God bless you, I pray, in the name 
of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER HEBER C. IVERSON 

(President of the Northwestern States 
Mission.) 

I share the feeling expressed by 
the worthy man whom I am suc- 
ceeding, in his splendid address to 
us this morning, when he said : 
"Standing in the presence of my 
new responsibility I feel truly weak, 
insignificant and almost helpless." 
Once before in my life have I felt 
almost, if not wholly, as I do to- 
day. That was when, twenty years 
ago, I was called to preside over 



the ward in which I was born and 
have lived all my life, called as a 
boy to preside over one of the larg- 
est wards in Salf Lake City, and 
three men who had formerly been 
my bishops. I sincerely trust that as 
the Lord was good to me in that 
ministry, and that those over whom 
I presided were patient and loving 
and kind, that he. will again be good 
to me and that those among whom 
I labor will bear with me in my 
weakness, with my many imperfec- 
tions, and that I may find in the 
ministry now before me the same 
joy that I had in the ministry that 
,1 have just completed. I am con- 
scious of the fact that I am follow- 
ing in the footsteps of a mighty man 
in Israel. He enjoyed, to a very 
marked degree, the love and the 
confidence of the people among 
whom he labored, and I do not won- 
der at this, for my association with 
him, during a few days, has en- 
deared him to me. They love him 
no more than I do ; my belief is that 
to the cause I have consecrated, m 
the same measure that he did, my 
humble ability and every sentiment 
of my being, and sincerely trust thai 
God will recognize that consecra- 
tion, and that he will give to me the 
ability and strength to do what is in 
my heart — my duty to rw fellow 
men, whom I love as God's chil- 
dren. 

I have been overwhelmed, my 
dear brethren and sisters, with the 
magnitude of the wortc and the pos- 
sibilities that lie before us. This is 
the hour, and we have the message 
for which the sorrow-stricken world 
is crying. Unfortunately it bears 
an unpopular label. If known by 
some other name, it might be more 
acceptable. An illustration of this 
fact was in evidence when a lady 



ELDER HEBER C. IVERSON 



107 



in Seattle, approached by one of our 
elders, in conversation, the articles 
appearing in the paper published 
there, written by Brother Talmage, 
were under discussion and she ex- 
pressed her admiration for tho.se 
splendid articles — which, by the 
way, I want to say to you, are do- 
ing an immense amount of good — 
and when told that they were writ- 
ten by a member of the "Mormon" 
Church she absolutely refused to 
believe it. For she could not think 
that any- such good could come out 
of "Mormondom." Like those of 
old, "can any good come out of 
Nazareth?" But conditions have 
very greatly changed. The senti- 
ment toward our people has 
changed since my last mission in 
the state of Tennessee, in connec- 
tion with my dear associate and 
friend, Elder George Albert Smith. 
When there, we found that objec- 
tions to our message, and ridicule, 
was the rule. Now we find such to 
be the exception, when our elders 
approach those to whom they desire 
to deliver the message, and I am 
thankful for the changed sentiment. 
I am thankful for my association 
with Elder George Albert Smith in 
the mission field in Tennessee, and 
I cannot forebear this opportunity 
of invoking the blessings of the 
Lord upon him, indicating my feel- 
ing for him. Since laboring in Ten- 
nessee together we have been very 
close friends. Now we separate — 
he to go to the East and I to the 
West, and I sincerely pray that God 
will bless him, strengthen him in 
body, renew him in spirit, and re- 
turn him to us to live many years, 
to continue his labors as a pillar and 
tower of strength in this 'work and 
an inspiration to all Israel, as he 
has been these many years, a most 
worthy son of a most noble sire — 



John Henry Smith. I know I voice 
your sentiments when I thus speak, 
though feebly. 

I am convinced, my brethren and 
sisters, from the articles that ap- 
pear from time to time, written by 
eminent thinkers, that as Elder Mc- 
Kay expressed it this morning, all 
institutions of human construction 
have been shaken from center to 
circumference, during the past few 
years, and the so-called Christian 
churches — for they belong to 'this 
class, being of human origin,formed 
by human wisdom — are not an ex- 
ception to the rule ; and as one has 
expressed it ; "Modern Christianity- 
has been tried in the trenches and 
found wanting, and the experiences 
of the past vear have proved the 
death of mystic Christianity." "Let 
us hope and pray that it may be 
the birth of an ethical, practical 
Christianity which men really be- 
lieve and live." It is for this reality 
the world is crying — not for a re- 
ligion founded upon a God that is 
immaterial, invisible, incomprehen- 
sible — no, but upon a God who is a 
reality, and with the message which 
the children of men need ; knowing 
that in the language of the poet, 

"Life is real, life is earnest, 
And the grave is not its goal. 

Dust thou art, to dust returnest, 
Was not spoken of the soul ;" 

And, as Carlyle has said : "Re- 
member that thy life is not an idle 
dream, it is a sacred reality, all thine 
own, and the only thing thou hast 
with which to face eternity." So, 
we believe in a real God, who is 
really our Father, as Paul has de- 
clared — "We have had fathers of 
the flesh which corrected us, and 
we gave them reverence" — they 
were real beings; there was noth- 



108 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



ing mystical about them — "should 
we not much rather be in subjec- 
tion to the Father of our spirits and 
live?" He is the Father of our 
spirits, and he is just as real a 
being as was the one whom we 
knew and called father in the flesh. 
That is our message to the world. 
We have been criticised because we 
are "too materialistic." If by that 
our critics mean consecrated to and 
devoted to the pursuit of wealth 
and material things, primarily, we 
say, Not guilty. We do believe in 
the reality of life, in the reality of 
God, whose Son was the Redeemer 
of the world,- was the Babe of Beth- 
lehem, was the carpenter of Naz- 
areth, was the crucified One, on 
Calvary's cross, and the body risen 
from the tomb of Joseph of Arima- 
thea — the disciples being told to be- 
hold the prints of the nails in his 
hands and feet, and the wounds of 
the spear in his side; "Handle me 
and see, for a spirit hath not flesh 



and bones, as ye see me have" — 
thus indicating realities in which 
we believe and which we know to 
be true; knowing that real beings, 
Peter, James and. John conferred 
upon Joseph Smith the Melchize- 
dek priesthood ; that John the Bap- 
tist, a real being, conferred upon 
him the Aaronic priesthood. We 
know that these things are true ; 
and this is our message to _ the 
world. God help us to bear it, ana 
may the Lord bless you, my bretn- 
ren and sisters. These -brethren 
know my sentiments toward them. 
Every sentiment of my soul, with 
all its love and affection, belongs to 
those who lead Israel. God help 
them and us, I pray, in the name of 
Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The choir and congregation sang 
the Doxology, and the closing 
prayer was offered by Elder Clar- 
'ence Gardner, president oif the 
Star Valley stake of Zion. 



THIRD DAY. 



• 

Conference continued in the 

Tabernacle on Tuesday, June 3, 
1919. President Heber J. Grant, 
presided and called the congrega- 
tion to order at 10 o'clock a. m. 

The choir and congregation sang 
"High on the mountain top." 

Prayer was offered by President 
Joseph R. Shepherd, of the Logan 
Temple. 

Mrs. Francisca Parkinson sang 
a solo: "My heart ever faithful." 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

I am sure that all "the presidents 
of our missions have had the per- 
fect love, confidence and respect, 
and the daily faith and prayers of 
all the Church leaders, as they have 
had mine, morning and night, for 
their success in the mission field, 
each and all of them. 

CONCERNING THE MISSION PRESI- 
DENTS 

I regret to learn that in some 
sections there is a feeling that there 
must be something wrong or re- 
leases would not be given to the 
men who have labored so long, so 
faithfully, with such energy and 
zeal and with the inspiration of the 
Lord in the mission field. I desire 
to correct any such impression on 
the part of any of the Latter-day 
Saints. 

Some years ago it was the unan- 
imous opinion of the Council of 
the Twelve that it would be fair to 
the men who had been many years 
in the mission field, to be released 
and to have the opportunity of re- 



turning to 4heir homes. The Coun- 
cil so unanimously recommended, 
but further action on the matter was 
deferred. Soon after the death ot 
President Smith the Twelve Apos- 
tles again recommended to the 
presidency the honorable release of 
some of the men who had spent long 
years in the mission field. It so 
happened that this recommenda- 
tion was made at a meeting where 
President Anthon H. Lund pre- 
sided, and it so happened that 
Brother Heber J. Grant and 
Brother Charles W. Penrose were 
members of the quorum when 
the original recommendation was 
made. So you can plainly see that 
it happened to be .strictly unanim- 
ous with the First Presidency and 
all of the Twelve that we should 
honorably release some of our mis- 
sion presidents. 

I want to say that they have lab- 
ored with untiring zeal and energy ; 
that they have ,gained not only the 
love, the confidence and respect of 
the* general authorities of the 
Church, but I am sure from my ex- 
perience in travejing in all of their 
missions that they have gained the 
love and confidence of the people 
with whom they have labored ; and 
because of that intense love, which 
has grown up in the hearts of the 
people for those who preside over 
them in the mission field, some of 
the Saints have been broken-hearted 
over the releases that have been 
made. I felt that it was only fair 
to say this. I want to say s that all 
of these brethren will always have 
a seat here and he counted as mi:5-

sion presidents. They have our love 
and our confidence. When I called 
for one of the brethren yesterday, 
he had to come from the gallery. 
He perhaps felt that, as his suc- 
cessor had been installed, this was 
not his place. But we expect those 
men always to come here. We ex- 
pect to look upon them as faithful, 
diligent mission presidents. When- 
ever an announcement is made, 
from this stand that there will be a 
.special priesthood meeting to which 
presidents of missions are invited, 
it will include all of those who 
have presided and who are 
now released. We want them to 
feel that they belong with the mis- 
sion presidents and are invited. I 
wanted to say this much. 

OUR CHAPLAINS IN THE ARMY 

As was read here yesterday in 
the statistical report, we were en- 
titled to twenty chaplains and we 
only have had three. Two of these 
chaplains — Calvin S. Smith and 
Herbert Maw saw active service on 
the firing line. I understand that 
Brother Smith was wounded three 
times, and has been decorated for 
bravery. He is a son of President 
Joseph F. Smith. 

In that wonderful charge of the 
marines, at Chateau-Thierry, which 
will go down in history, where six 
thousand, two hundred out of eight 
thousand men were killed or 
wounded, one of President Francis 
M. Lyman's sons, named after 
your humble servant, lost his life. 

I wish to say here that the gen- 
eral authorities- of the Church are 
very grateful to General Richard 
W. Young who volunteered, al- 
though beyond the age limit, to ac- 
cept the position of colonel in the 
army. He had a very excellent 
oversight and care of the boys from 



the state of Utah, and was .subse- 
quently advanced to the rank of 
brigadier general. Our hearts go 
out in gratitude to him for again 
offering his services to his country, 
as he .did in the # Spanish Ameri- 
can war, when he served in the 
Philippines. 

We are grateful to Brother B. 
H. Roberts, who also volunteered, 
notwithstanding he was beyond the 
age limit, and did splendid service 
in looking after our boys, as chap- 
lain. He gained their love and 
their confidence and had an excel- 
lent influence over them for good. 
I desire to say- this much with refer- 
ence to the patriotic service of these 
men. 

ELDER CHARLES A. CALLIS 

(President of the Southern State* 
Mission.) 

My brethren and sisters: I know 
that the mission presidents art. 
grateful to President Grant for 
hi.s complimentary expressions of 
love and confidence with reference 
to the retiring mission, presidents. 
From my heart — and I speak al- 
so for my companions — I can 
'truthfully say that we have the 
deepest and sincerest love and con- 
fidence for the President of the 
Church, because we know that he 
is affectionately disposed towards 
the missionaries, and to all the 
people of God, and to the children 
of men generally. 

God's truth is marching on m 
the world. Through his servants, 
our heavenly Father is opening 
many effectual doors for the 
preaching of the gospel. The arti- 
cles being published in many of 
the newspapers of the country — ■ 
which articles are contributed by 
Flder James E. Talmage, of the 
Council of the Twelve — are being 



ELDER CH4RLES A. CALLIS

widely read. They are being read 
by statesmen and business men 
who are not easily reached by the 
traveling elders. A short time ago 
a newspaper in the south published 
a sermon delivered in this build- 
ing, by Elder Orson F. Whitney. 
The sermon was received with 
great favor by the non-members 
of the Church. It created much 
interest in the gospel, and the 
state historical society of the state 
in which the newspaper is pub- 
lished, requested that I forward 
to them the standard works of the 
Church and such other information 
as would enlighten the people of 
the state generally upon the doc- 
trines of the Church.

"The swift messengers are treading 
Thy high courts where princes 
dwell, 

And thy glorious light is spreading, 
Zion prospers, all is well." 

The Apostle Paul said : "Though 
I speak with the tongues of men 
and of angels, and have not charity, 
I am become as sounding brass, or 
a tinkling cymbal." 

My brethren and sisters, the 
missionaries who go forth into the 
world are imbued with deep love 
for the children of men. This love 
mav be called the spirit of their 
mission, and when an elder chances 
by neglect to lose that spirit, he 
becomes indeed as sounding brass 
and a tinkling cymbal ; but thank 
God the cases where this misfor- 
tune occurs are few and far be- 
tween. 

The Psalmist David said: "It 
is good for me that I have been 
afflicted; that I might learn thy 
statutes. The law of thv mouth 
is better unto me than thousands 
of gold and silver." Why? Be : 



cause as David said: "The law of 
the Lord is perfect, converting the 
soul: the testimony of the Lord 
is sure, making wise the simple." 
The souls of these missionaries 
who go forth to preach the gospel 
are converted, and the souls of the 
Latter-day Saints are converted. 
They stand on a secure and firm 
foundation. 

Someone has said that we are 
sons, not pets ; that we are to be 
treated with kindness, but not 
spoiled. So, my brethren and sis- 
ters, the experiences through which 
the Lord permits us to pass, or 
those experiences through which 
he leads us, will ultimately ■> result 
in our good ; for, as the Apostle 
Paul said, "The Lord will make all 
things work together for good, to 
those who love him." The Latter- 
day Saints are a great people be- 
cause they believe, as the Savior 
said, "It is more blessed to give 
than to receive." It is not that 
which we receive which makes us 
great, but it is that which we give ; 
and the spirit of sacrifice mani- 
fested by the members of this 
Church, is the spirit that makes 
them great in' the sight of God, 
great in the sight of good men and 
good women, and a power — an 
evangelizing power of great good 
in all the world. 

The Apostle Paul was told by 
the Lord that he must go before 
Caesar, and he embarked on a ship 
to accomplish that perilous journey. 
Me counseled the captain of the 
ship to stay in a certain place that 
winter because, there was danger 
in leaving that place : but this man 
did not obey his counsel, and the 
way of the counsel-breaker is hard. 
A certain navigator was asked by 
a passenger on a ship if he knew 
where the rocks were, "No," said 



112 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



he, "But I know where they are 
not." That is the safe guide, — 
not to look for sin, not to look for 
those evils, but to tread the path of 
life, the path of counsel, where we 
know that these sins and evils are 
not. Well, they disobeyed Paul's 
counsel, but the Lord told him that 
his life and the life of the passen- 
gers of the ship would be saved. 
The .ship's crew became fearful for 
their safety and they were about 
to abandon the ship, and leave it 
with its precious cargo to its fate ; 
but Paul said to the centurian, 
speaking of the officers and the 
crew. "Except these abide in the 
ship, we cannot be saved." There 
is the lesson : except the apostles 
and prophets abide in the ship of 
Zion, we cannot be saved ; for God 
has placed these men in his Church 
for the edification of his people, for 
perfecting them in the doctrines of 
Jesus Christ, for bringing the peo- 
ple to the unity of the faith. These 
men have been endowed with pow- 
ers to perform sacred ordinances 
for the living and for the dead — 
which the Latter-day Saints regard 
as essential to their salvation^and 
without these men we cannot be 
saved in the fulness of salvation, 
in the enjoyment of the great boon . 
of eternal life. The Church is 
built upon the foundation of proph- 
ets and apostles, Jesus Christ, him- 
self, being the chief cornerstone. 

Once in a certain harbor a 
mighty tempest arose and the com- 
mander wanted to get his fleet out 
in the open sea, away from the 
rockv and barren shores so that he 
would not be destroyed. The temp- 
est knocked those ships about, and 
sailors were washed overboard. 
While the storm was raging with 
great furv, the commander at the 
most critical moment ordered the 



band to play the Star Spangled 
Banner. As the strains of that im- 
mortal national anthem went over 
the storm-tossed sea, the sailors 
took heart, they fought with re- 
doubled energy, they battled with 
the elements with renewed strength, 
and those sailors, drowning in the 
sea, with the last vestige of their 
strength, raised their hands cind 
voices in praise of the flag and the 
Star Spangled Banner, the music 
of which was comforting their 
souls. In this Church, where stand 
the First Presidency and the 
Twelve, there is solid ground. On 
ether grounds are sinking sands. 
There need be no doubt. These 
servants of God whom we love will 
always sound the true notes, they 
will always cause the music of the 
gospel to be sounded to the com- 
forting -and the salvation of the 
children of God. The poet's 
prayer, "God give us men," has 
been answered. He gave this nation 
men who went to a foreign shore 
and palsied the strong arm of 
autocracy. He has placed in this 
Church men of counsel, men of 
God, true shepherds of the people. 
God bless these men that they may 
ever remain in the ship of Zion, in 
the Church, to our comfort and 
salvation ; and may we sustain 
them, with loving and loyal hearts, 
is my prayer in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 

ELDER JOSEPH E. ROBINSON 

(Retiring President of the California 
Mission.) 

"Now I know that the Lord is 
greater than all g'Ods, for in the 
thing wherein they dealt proudly, 
he was above them." These are 
# the words of the Midianite High 
Priest, Jethro, to his son-in-law, 



ELDER JOSEPH E: ROBINSON 



113 



Moses, the. great law-giver of 
ancient Israel. Aaron's rod had' 
budded, evolved into a serpent, ana 
had devoured the sacred snake of 
the Egyptians, their symbol ot 
kingly power and priestcraft. The 
river Nile, which they worshiped 
as a cleanser of sin and a healer of 
diseases, had become a loathsome 
thing. Hathor and Isis, and the 
sacred beetle had been brought to 
naught by the thunder, the hail, and- 
the plague of lice and flies. The 
frog which was supposed to be a 
purifier of water and upon which 
no man could tread even inadver- 
tently and escape the penalty of 
■death — had befouled their bed- 
rooms, their kneading troughs, and 
had become a loathsome detestable 
plague. The great god Apis whom 
they worshiped in the temple at 
Memphis had doubtless died when 
the common cattle of the Egyptians 
died by pestilence. The great god 
Ra, who painted the flowers and 
ripened their harvests, had been 
darkened, and then Osiris himself, 
the god of life, was put to shame 
when the first-born among the 
Egyptians had been brought to 
death. When these things were re- 
lated by Moses to his father-in-law, 
he declared, as I have read to you : 
"Now I know that the Lord is 
greater than all gods." 
• I can say, after nineteen years in 
the mission field : "Now I know 
that God is greater than all gods." 
I have seen the sick healed, the par- 
aletic to leap with joy, the lame to 
walk, the eyes of the blind to see 
and the ears of the deaf have been 
opened, and angels have ministered 
to the sons of men. The prisoner 
has been visited and, when worthy, 
set free. The sick have been com- 
forted, the dead have been properly 
cared for. The froward and unto- 



ward of our youth, and their el- 
ders, too, who have left the body of 
the Church and have drifted Sut to 
the Coast to get away from them- 
selves, and people, have been felt 
after and constrained to follow 
again in the paths of virtue and 
truth, and God has wonderfully 
magnified the weak things of the 
'earth, his servants, the brethren 
and sisters engaged in the ministry. 

I welcome the respite tendered 
me by my release. I have interests 
at heart that need my direction 
more than the affairs of the mis- 
sion field. Therefore, I am glad to 
come home to my loved ones, to 
come home where the House of 
God is builded, that perhaps therein 
I may have the chance to labor for 
my sacred dead. I am glad to come 
here where I may sit under the 
droppings of the sanctuary and be 
chastened' in judgment and in- 
structed in words of life and salva- 
tion "by those men whom God hath 
chosen, and set at our head to di- 
rect the activities of his people and 
to shape the destiny of his Church. 

I am grateful and thankful for 
him who has been appointed to suc- 
ceed me in the mission field, a man 
whom I have loved so long, and 
unto whom God has given such a 
wondrous testimony that few ever 
stirred my soul as his testimony has 
moved it in times past. -I feel that 
he will be kind to my faults, and 
that he will magnify what virtues 
I may have possessed in my presi- 
dency. It is delightful, it is graci- 
ous, my brethren and sisters, to be 
freed of the great responsibility 
that rested upon me, and to be one 
with you again. When I went into 
the field — and I may be pardoned 
perhaps for speaking half person- 
ally for once, as I am not wont to 
do it — but when I went into the 



114 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



mission field there were less than 
six hundred souls, about four hun- 
dred whom we knew and who were 
of record. I have had the privilege 
of seeing the work of God grow 
until there are five thousand en- 
rolled ; and from a few meager pos- 
sessions, through the magnanimous 
generosity of the Trustee-in-Trust 
and the brethren at our head, and 
by the help of the faithful tithe 
payers among the mission Saints, 
and by donations that have come 
from goodly friends who have 
visited us, it has increased in prop- 
erties to more than the sum of one 
hundred thousand dollars value. 
Many beautiful buildings have been 
erected, in which the name of God 
is named, and ground has been re- 
claimed' for Zion, that the name of 
our Lord should be declared there- 
in and the Saints be dealt the bread 
of life. So whilst there cannot 
help but be some heart pangs at 
parting with loved ones and a 
man's life work, still there is rich 
compensation in their love and con- 
fidence in their expressions of good 
will and blessing, as there is a re- 
compense in the kindly words and 
deeds which have been shown to 
me and mine by those who preside 
over us. 

This is the Lord's work it does 
not depend on any one man. God 
is at the helm. He will direct our 
efforts^ He will take care of his 
own ; and although the sons of this 
generation, who know him not, may 
be wiser than the children of light, 
as the scriptures have said, God 
will magnify his people and their 
light shall shine; the Gentiles shall 
be brought to the gladness of its 
rising ; and the day will come when 
every knee shall bow and every 



tongue shall confess that Jesus is 
the Christ. 

I have not only matured my faith 
in God but in his children, mankind 
at large. I love my Father's chil- 
dren. I confide in them, I trust 
them, many of them who are aliens 
to our faith and creed, but I find 
that they are truly the children of 
God. I have seen them under such 
conditions that evidenced this fact, 
that when brought to some dread 
extremity they realize, just as well 
as did . Peter, when, some disciples 
left the Master, because of his say- 
ing of himself, that he was the 
bread of life, which had come down 
from heaven, and he turned to them 
and said: "Will ye also go away?" 
and Peter answered, "Lord, to 
whom shalh we go? thou hast the 
words of eternal life, and we be- 
lieve and are sure that thou art 
that Christ, the Son of the living 
God." When earthquake and fire 
laid waste our great city of the 
Coast I saw not only the saint, the 
priest, and the nun, but the wanton 
with her paramour, bend on their 
knees and ask God to deliver them 
from that dread thing which they 
felt hung over them, which no 
other hand could stay. There was 
no comfort in the dram shop; there 
was no power in riches, there was 
no succor by the hand of man ; and 
then for once, at least, they were 
all made to realize that God is over 
all and that aside from him there is 
no help and no salvation. He will 
speak by fire and earthquake, by 
pestilence and plague when neces- 
sary, and happy are they who, even 
when thus chastened, turn unto him 
and live. I admonish you, my breth- 
ren and sisters, to fight the good 
fight, to keep the faith, to finish the

course, that henceforth for you and 
all those who love God's appear- 
ing, there shall be a crown of right- 
eousness which he will bestow upon 
his faithful ones. I desire, above 
all else that I shall be found faith- 
ful and true with you; that my 
guerdon shall be the one of eternal 
life, in the presence of my Re- 
deemer, my King, my Lord, and my 
Savior, Jesus Christ, and I ask it in 
his name. Amen. 

ELDER JOSEPH W. McMURRIN 

(Of the Council of Seventy, and 
President of the California 

Mission.) « 

I have had some reminiscent 
thoughts passing through my mind 
while sitting in the congregation, 
my brethren and sisters, listening 
to the splendid words that have 
been spoken by the presiding 
authorities of the Church and by 
the mission presidents who have 
been called to address these confer- 
ence meetings. It seems to me but 
a very brief time since I said fare- 
well to a girl-wife and a little baby 
and went abroad as a boy mission- 
ary. Of course, quite a term of 
years has passed away since that 
time, but as I look back it seems a 
very brief period indeed. I was 
somewhat impressed today in 
thinking that, brief as the time ap- 
pears to me, so far as I know, I am 
the oldest man with one exception 
of all the mission presidents in the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints, and I am impressed 
with the thought that time is pass- 
ing very swiftly. President Joseph 
F. Smith ofttimes in speaking with 
reference to the mission presidents 
spoke of them as "boys." I don't 
know whether the present presi- 
dency of the Church looked upon 



me as a boy, like the other mission 
presidents, when they called me to 
the responsibility that has recently 
been placed upon my shoulders. I 
feel in some respects quite a boy, 
and in other ways not as boyish by 
any means as I was when I went 
upon my first mission. 

My heart is filled with gratitude 
today that my Father in heaven, in 
his wonderful kindness, gave me 
the privilege, in the days of my 
boyhood, to go abroad as a repre- 
sentative of the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints. The 
experiences gained in the mission 
field during my first mission, con- 
vinced me beyond any question of 
doubt that I was not upon the er- 
rand of man, but that in spite of my 
lack of experience, and lack of 
worthiness, I had actually been 
called of God to preach the gos- 
pel of his Son, and that I had been 
endowed with authority, even the 
authority of the holy priesthood, 
and actually had the right to legally 
call men to repentance, and to ad- 
minister unto them the precious or- 
dinances of the everlasting gospel. 
The experiences gained, away back 
at that period, filled my heart with 
a joy and gladness that passeth all 
Understanding, just as the Savior 
promised to those who would take 
up their cross and follow him. 

During the peroid from 1881 to 
1896, it was my blessed privilege to 
be called, upon three separate oc- 
casions, to go to the European mis- 
sion as an elder of the Church. I 
thank God today for those calls. In 
all of those missionary labors, I had 
many very happy experiences, and 
saw the hand of God in a marvel- 
ous manner upon many occasions. 
I have had a happy life, my breth- 
ren and sisters, because of the gos- 
pel of the Redeemer of the world. 



116 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



I have not accumulated very much 
of the good things of the world, 
but I am thankful to say I have 
always been quite comfortable. At 
times, of course, like many others, 
I could have wished for more of the 
things of the world, but in spite of 
this, I say again, I have had a most 
joyful and happy life, happy in the 
knowledge that I was a member of 
the Church of Jesus Christ of Lat- 
ter-day Saints, and that this Church 
is indeed the Church of the living 
God. This Church is not a church 
established by the wisdom of men, 
but a Church established by the 
revelation and commandment of 
God. The knowledge of this truth 
has been with me" during these 
years, and has filled me with very 
great joy. I expect to be happy in 
the labors that shall come to me in 
the California mission. 

I realize, as has been intimated 
by President Grant, that the hearts 
of the people of California have 
been wrenched by the release of 
President Robinson. He has been 
with the people of the California 
mission for the long period that has 
been named. He has been kind and 
attentive to the people, laboring 
early and late for their advantage 
and blessing, and their hearts have 
gone out to him. I haven't any 
doubt but what it will be quite a 
difficult matter for some of the peo- 
ple of the California mission to ac- 
cept the new president, but I sin- 
cerely hope that through the bless- 
ing of God, and by the companion- 
ship and direction of his Spirit, I 
also may be led to pursue such a 
course as shall be for the blessing 
of the people. I hope I may be able 
to keep in mind that I am sent to 
preach the gospel, and that I must 
call repentance among the people. 



Responsibility is upon me to bear 
record to those with whom I come 
in contact that Jesus Christ is the 
Son of the living God; and that 
•mankind, through his name; and 
through the ordinances and prin- 
ciples of his gospel, can regain the 
presence of God. My understand- 
ing is that I am under obligation 
to bear record to the human family, 
that there is but one gospel. God, 
himself, so declared at the opening 
of this great dispensation. He has 
so taught by the inspiration of the 
Holy Spirit, through the mouths of 
his apostles in the meridian of time, 
and all men who have received 
commissions to preach the gospel of 
the Lord Jesus Christ, from my 
point of understanding, are under 
obligation to bear record of the 
truth, and show to men the way 
of salvation, and invite and per- 
suade men to receive the principles 
of the everlasting gospel. 

I have a very great comfort in 
my heart today, my brethren and 
sisters, in the thought that I have 
the confidence and the blessing of 
these splendid men who are the 
leaders of Israel, to whom refer- 
ence has been made by President 
Callis, and many others during our 
conference. I hope that through 
their help, and through the help of 
the people generally, and through 
striving to keep my feet in the 
straight and narrow path, I may ac- 
complish some good in the preach- 
ing of the gospel. I thank God for 
the gospel. I thank God for the 
companionship of good men. How 
my heart has swelled, again and 
again, in the missionary field ; as 
I have looked into the faces of my 
missionary companions, I have 
praised the name of God most* fer- 
vently that in his providence I was 



ELDER NEPHI JENSEN 



117 



permitted to associate with the 
class of men who represent the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints, abroad in the world, as 
preachers of righteousness. They 
have all been good men, clean men, 
sweet men, men who in their counte- 
nances, and by their conduct, have 
attracted the attention of their fel- 
lows who were not of our faith, and 
they have been able to see that there 
indeed was something about the 
"Mormon" elders that was differ- 
ent from the general run of men. 
I thank God such men have been 
my companions, and that I have 
been greatly blessed in their asso- 
ciation. 

God be praised for the accom- 
plishment of the promises that have 
been made by holy prophets both 
ancient and modern in regard to 
the work of the latter times. It 
seems to me that any man who de- 
sires to know, can know that God 
has introduced this work, his hand 
has been over the leaders of this 
people, and he has sustained them 
up to the present hour. He has 
magnified them and he has fulfilled 
all that any reasonble being could 
expect of the promises made by 
holy prophets in relation to the 
work of latter times. I thank God 
that there is in my soul a disposition 
to uphold the authority of God. I 
love to honor that authority, and 
am thankful that at this moment I 
can say in all truth, before God, 
and this congregation, that my 
heart, my confidence, and my love 
go out to President Heber J. Grant 
today in just as full and complete 
measure as it went out to his great 
predecessor, President Joseph F. 
Smith. For I have in my soul an 
absolute assurance that God has 
brought President Grant to the 
presidency, and that the spirit and 



power of the great calling that has 
come to him will be upon him in 
just as full and rich measure as it 
has been upon those who have pre- 
ceded him; it could not be other- 
wise, because it is the work of God, 
and God hath wrought this thing. 
God's blessing, and power, and in- 
spiration, and wisdom, will be man- 
ifested today, just as it has been in 
the past, and so it will continue 
forever and ever. So hath God 
said, and he, the scriptures say, 
shall be true, and his word true, 
though all men may be liars. , God 
help us to love the truth, to mag- 
nify our callings, to keep the com- 
mandments of God, to preach the 
gospel, to win souls from the dark- 
ness that is in the world to the truth 
that has been revealed, I humbly 
pray in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT. 

It has been decided to open a 
new mission to be known as the 
"Canadian mission, being taken 
from part of the Eastern states and 
the Northern states missions. Elder 
Nephi Jensen- has been sustained by 
the presidency to preside over that 
mission. We will now hear from 
Elder Jensen. 

ELDER NEPHI JENSEN 

(President of the Canadian Mission.) 

I hope I shall be pardoned if I 
tell a semi-humorous story to take 
the strain off my mind. 

A certain man, charged with a 
crime, presented himself at the bar 
of justice, and the court asked him 
if he had a lawyer. He said, "No, 
your honor." The court then said, 
"You are entitled to counsel, and if 



118 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



you cannot afford to employ an at- 
torney, the court will appoint you 
one." The accused man said, "I 
don't think I shall need any lawyer, 
because I am going to tell the 
truth" (laughter). I think a great 
many of the men who have been 
my clients in the last ten years will 
have to tell the truth for a little 
while, or else employ other counsel. 

I am deeply grateful to my 
Heavenly Father for the confidence 
which the authorities of the Church 
have seen fit -to repose in me ; and I 
want to tell you, in the depths of 
humility, that I feel altogether in- 
adequate to the task that has been 
assigned me. Never in my life 
have I been so deeply humbled. I 
recall that a few days after Presi- 
dent Grant first spoke to me about 
this labor, a near relative of mine 
called me on the 'phone, and I 
asked her how she felt. "Well," 
she said, "I have got the grumbles." 
I told her : • "I have a burden on 
my shoulders now, so big, that it 
has crushed the grumbles all out of 
me. 

Today I feel like saying in my 
heart, as Elder Ballard has so fre- 
quently sung: 

"I'll go where you want me to go, 

dear Lord, 
I'll say what you want me to say, 
I'll do what you want me to do." 

I know that the gospel of Jesus 
Christ is the power of God unto 
salvation. I have not obtained this 
knowledge from books. And yet I 
have lived with books for a quarter 
of a century. I stand here today 
and say with all candor that if I 
had to choose between forgetting 
the witnesses of the truth which 
have come to my heart through the 
Spirit of God, and what I have 



learned from books, I should gladly 
choose to remember that God has 
told my heart that this is the work 
of God, and forget what I have 
read in all the books. 

I was deeply impressed with the 
thought expressed by President 
Callis this morning, concerning the 
fact that the elders who go out to 
preach the gospel of Jesus Christ 
have been converted. I am an ar- 
dent believer in the doctrine of the 
conversion of the soul. A short 
time ago, out of curiosity, I read 
Ernest Haeckel's Riddle of the Uni- 
verse, and I noted that in one of 
the closing chapters of that famous 
— I was about to say infamous — 
book the statement that one of the 
Greek philosophers, years before 
Christ ministered among the chil- 
dren of men, taught the Golden 
Rule. The skeptic, Ernest Haeckel, 
gave out the inference that this 
Greek philosopher was greater than 
Jesus Ghrist. I thought about it at 
the time, and have thought about it 
more since reading the book, and I 
have figured it out this way: The 
Greek philosopher, whom Ernest 
Haeckel mentioned, taught men 
how to think ; Jesus Christ taught 
men how to pray. Thoughts may 
bring to us information, but prayer 
can lift the human heart so close to 
God that its evil and carnal nature 
will be destroyed. What this world 
today needs is men who fight less 
and pray more. What this world 
needs is not so much a political rev- 
olution as a heart revolution, and I 
believe with all my heart that there 
is only one thing that can put the 
pieces of this distracted world to- 
gether, and that is the power of 
God. 

We need, in this world, what the 
Prophet Joseph Smith found in the 



PRESIDENT HEBER.J. GRANT 



119 



grove ninety-nine years ago. On 
that memorable day that flaxen- 
haired boy stood in the presence of 
God and his son Jesus Christ; and 
when his prayer was answered, he 
stood forth among men a veritable 
king. He knew what the kings of 
the earth did not know. He knew 
what the philosophers did not 
know. He knew what the scientists 
did not know. He knew God, 
whom to know is life eternal ! 

The faith that boy discovered 
that day is the only power that will 
heal this bruised world. The faith 
that he discovered that day is the 
power that will transform the hu- 
man heart. The faith that he dis- 
covered that day will take out of a 
human heart its hatred, and put 
into the human heart the love of 
God, the one thing which will en- 
noble the human race and bring 
lasting civilization among the chil- 
dren of men. 

My brothers and my sisters, I re- 
joice with all my heart in the 
knowledge I have that Joseph 
Smith was a prophet of God. 
Every time I think about the sub- 
ject I am reminded of a conversa- 
tion I had with one of the grand- 
est men who ever lived. I refer to 
the late Jesse N. Smith, who hap- 
pens to be my father-in-law. He 
was at my home a short time before 
he passed to the other side. One 
evening he became reminiscent. He 
talked about the things in this 
world that had made his heart glad. 
He spoke of Joseph Smith; and as 
he referred to that great man, 
tears came into his eyes. 

I said to him : "You become elo- 
quent when you talk of the Prophet 
Joseph Smith." With a grandeur 
in his soul that I shall never forget, 
he said: "Why shouldn't I? It is 
the darling theme of my heart." 



God grant that it may be the 
darling theme of my heart and your 
hearts. For our greatest heritage is 
the faith and the truth that has 
come down to us from that prophet 
of God. God help us to appreciate 
this heritage — "lest we forget, lest 
we forget." 

God help us to bear the burdens 
which have been placed upon our 
shoulders. God make our hearts 
humble that we may have commun- 
ion with his Spirit, in the name of. 
Jesus Christ. Amen. 

David Rees sang a tenor solo : 
"Hosannah." 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

I would like to endorse what was 
said here by Brother Jensen about 
his father-in-law. One of the 
grandest men I have ever known in 
my life was Jesse N. Smith. He 
has left one of the largest and most 
splendid families that I know of in 
any of the stakes of Zion. It is just 
such a family as that of President 
Joseph F. Smith. I have walked 
more miles and conversed more 
with Jesse N. Smith than with any 
other president of a stake of Zion. 
He was a regular encyclopedia of 
knowledge. He read Bancroft's 
History of the Native Races as the 
volumes came from the press the 
way I used to read the New York 
Weekly Ledger, when a boy. Jesse 
N. Smith I believe was the best 
read man of all the men with whom 
I have been acquainted; yet, thank 
the Lord, he felt, as Brother Jensen 
has expressed himself, that his 
reading was of no value to him in 
comparison to the testimony of the 
gospel of Jesus Christ. Really I 
could never quite understand, when 



120 



GENERAL CONFERENCE: 



I was a young man, and the junior 
apostle and used to travel hour 
after hour, walking through the 
sands of, Arizona with Jesse N. 
Smith, why in the world the Lord 
did not choose him for an apostle 
instead of me. He told me one 
thing that I endorsed and that was 
this: he said that from his reading 
and studying he believed that 
''America has produced two won- 
derfully great and grand statesmen, 
far above all others, and they both 
came from Illinois ; one was Abra- 
ham Lincoln, and the other was 
Daniel H. Wells. I remember hav- 
ing heard Brigham Young say that 
Heber C. Kimball was his prophet, 
and Daniel H. Wells was his states- 
man. 

ELDER E. WESLEY SMITH. 

(President of the Hawaiian Mission.) 

The .desire of my heart is that I 
may have an interest in your faith 
and prayers while occupying this 
position. When President Grant 
informed me that I had been chosen 
to preside over the Hawaiian mis- 
sion I was almost paralyzed; for. I 
know my weakness, but I have faith 
in God, and I have a testimony 
that this is the work of God. I 
have faith' and confidence in my 
brethren. I know that they have 
been called to these " positions 
through revelation from God, and 
my faith tells me that God will not 
call any man to a position in his 
service and not sustain and assist 
him, if the man will put himself in 
a position to receive assitance from 
the Lord. I love the Lord and I 
love the work of the Lord. I de- 
light in doing those things that may 
bring my fellow men, associates, 
and friends, to a knowledge of the 



gospel. It is my heart's purpose 
and desire to go into the mission 
field and accomplish all that is in 
my power to accomplish. 

In going out to that land, I go 
to a field of labor where I com- 
menced this life. During the time 
when this Church was persecuted, 
when the leaders were under great 
distress on account of polygamy, 
my father was- advised to depart 
from Zion together with my 
mother, and they went to the 
Hawaiian Islands. There they 
served in the work of the Lord 
with that people. They were there 
in distress, and it was well, under 
those circumstances, that I was sent 
to them. I appreciate the fact that 
I had been detained on the other 
side until that day when, during 
a time of grief and sorrow and dis- 
tress, I could come into the world 
and gladden my father's heart. It 
so happened that when I came into 
the world I had red hair. This was 
something new to the Hawaiian 
people. As you know, they are 
a dark race, and when they viewed 
the little red head upon the pillow, 
they called that baby Kananiolaie- 
kaweheweheolanihuli, which means 
that I was born in the home of 
Lanihuli at Laie on the island of 
Oahu ; and they called me Kawe- 
heweheolanihuli, which means the 
opening up or ushering in of the 
glory of Kananiolaie. 

My father was called as a mis- 
sionary to the. Hawaiian Islands 
when he was an orphan boy, fifteen 
years of age, with little brothers and 
sisters. He departed for thai 
journey in a company of nineteen 
others, riding his little pony from 
this valley as far as San Bernar- 
dino, California. There he labored 
in a mill, making shingles, sold his 
horse and obtained enough means 



ELDER E. WESLEY SMITH 



121 



to take him, with the other elders, 
as far as San Francisco. There 
they entered into an enterprise buy- 
ing a boat, thinking they could rig 
out the same and depart for their 
field of labor. After they had 
worked for some time, and spent 
their means in preparing this boat, 
it was condemned as unseaworthy. 
They lost their means, they lost 
their time, and again they had to 
set about earning means to go ovei 
to the mission field. 

I have heard father relate many 
times how he labored as a carpen- 
ter in San Francisco, building 
homes on the sand hills there, and 
finally purchased passage in the 
hold of an old sailing vessel. The 
elders took straw from the manger, 
bedding from the mules that were 
being conveved on the ship, and 
spread this forage upon the barrels 
and cargo, and that was their bed. 
When he arrived in the Hawaiian 
Islands, the natives there took 
kindly to him, and they adopted 
him. There was Napela, one of 
the great leaders among that na- 
tion. He called this boy to him 
and said : "Iosepa, my home is your 
home. This horse is your horse; 
use it." For four years he labored 
in that mission. He was humble 
and submissive. In one hundred 
days from the day he landed there, 
he commenced his mission work in 
earnest. He was able to converse 
in the Hawaiian tongue. Three 
months practically of this time was 
spent on a sick bed, suffering from 
break-bone fever. He learned to 
love that good people and they 
loved him. This love that was es- 
tablished in his heart, as a youth, 
continued to grow and develop un- 
til he was released from this life. 
It was his desire and ambition to 
live until he could .see the comple- 



tion of the temple there, and per- 
haps take part in its dedication, but 
it was not to be. Therefore, I feel 
honored in being called to that land, 
perhaps to represent him 

As the brethren have expressed 
themselves, I also feel to join in 
the sentiment of the song that 
Brother Ballard sings so well : "I'll 
go where you want me to go, dear 
Lord, I'll do what you want me 
to do, and I'D say what what you 
want me to say." 

I might tell you a little concern- 
ing the Hawaiian people, among 
whom I expect soon to labor. Then 
you may understand why it was 
that father loved them so much. 
We read in John 10:16, that the 
Savior was preaching to the Jews, 
soon after he had performed a 
miracle in opening the eyes of the 
blind. They ridiculed him, made 
light of his teachings, and would 
n,ot listen to them. He l/ikened 
them unto his sheep. He told them 
that his sheep knew his voice ; that 
he was the gate ; that he was their 
shepherd. And when he saw that 
they hardened their hearts against 
him, and would not listen, for they 
thought they were the only chosen 
people in the world, the Savior tokl 
the" 1 - 'A«d other sheep I have, 
which are not of this fold : them 
also I must bring, and they shall 
hear my voice ; and there shall be 
one fold, and one shepherd." Then 
he said : "Therefore doth my Father 
love me because I lay down my 
life, that I might take it up again." 
"No man taketh it from me, but I 
lay it down of myself. I have 
power to lay it down, and I have 
power to take it up again." When 
he told them: "This commandment 
I have received of my Father," 
they knew not what he meant. They 
had supposed that he meant the 



a 



122 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Gentiles when he said: "other 
sheep;" but he did not meant this. 
For after he had been crucified 
and risen and ascended to God on 
high,- he appeared to the othei 
sheep, whom he had mentioned — ■ 
the Nephites on this continent. He 
displayed unto them the wounds in 
his hands, the wound in his side, 
and revealed unto them what he 
had said to the people in Jerusa- 
lem. He repeated unto them the 
words, and said : "Ye are the sheep. 
When I said, other sheep I have 
which are not of this fold, thy 
brothers at Jerusalem knew not 
what I meant." 

The Savior went on to relate in- 
cidents to them after the organiza- 
tion of the Church, after choosing' 
his apostles in that land. Then he 
said : "Other sheep I have which 
are not of this fold ; they also should 
hear my voice." In the 38th reign 
of the Judges, during the time that 
Zebulon was the historian, it is re- 
corded there of a man named 
Hagoth, who was a curious and 
venturesome man, that he builded 
many boats, and these boats de- 
parted off into the mighty deep, and 
he said the people "heard not of 
them again." They supposed that 
they had been swallowed up in the 
deep. 

The Hawaiian people relate m 
their history a tradition that they 
came from Kaaina ka hiki, which 
means an eastern land, endeavor- 
ing evidently, as they did, to sail 
along the northern coast, having 
the ships embarked on the western 
coast of South America near the 
narrow neck of land, the isthmus 
of Panama. They were evidently 
carried by the trade winds and ship- 
wrecked, so that thev landed on the 
islard of Hawaii. There they lived 
and grew and developed into a. 



mighty people; but they dare not 
venture to go back again to their 
native land, for fear of destruction. 
In later years, however, they be- 
came more courageous ; the Spirit 
of the Lord was poured out upon 
them, and they endeavored to re- 
turn. But instead of finding them- 
selves back upon the promised land, 
they again sailed westward ana 
multiplied and populated the Pa- 
cific isles from Hawaii as far as 
New Zealand. The old tradition 
relates how the Savior appeared 
and ministered unto them ; how he 
taught them righteousness and 
noble principles ; how they saw the 
wounds in his hands and in his feet ; 
that when he departed from them, 
it was with a promise that he would 
return again to rule and reign in 
righteousness upon the earth, to be 
their King and their God. They 
look forward to the coming of tnt 
Son of God, earnestly praying for 
the time when he shall rale and 
reign. 

We learn that Captain Cook, in 
his travels, came upon that land. He 
found a noble people. Though they 
had departed from Christianity, still 
they believed in God ; they be- 
lieved in the great God, Lono, and 
they thought that he, with his boat 
had sailed to them. They thought 
Captain Cook was that great God. 
They worshiped him and looked 
on him as a God, but he was guilty 
of wickedness and his people had 
the plan that had been handeo 
down through tradition to them. 
His works were evil. He broke 
and desecrated their laws. When 
they saw that, they concluded that 
he was not the great God, Jesus, 
but that he was the being from the 
other world, the world of evil 
.smirks. Thev thought he was 
Satan. Finally, during a parade on 



ELDER E. WESLEY SMITH 



123 



the isle of Hawaii, on the west 
coast, Captain Cook was accident- 
ally injured, and as he uttered a 
shriek of pain, and they saw the. 
blood from his arm, they knew that 
he could be hurt, that he was not 
God, and so fell upon him and slew 
him. We are told that they cut 
his heart from his body and offered 
it as a sacrifice. 

Later on, the gospel message 
was taken to that people. They ac- 
cepted it because they knew it was 
true. The Lord had said : "M> 
sheep know mv voice, and when 
they hear my voice, they shall re- 
joice;" and when the Hawaiian 
people heard the voice of the true 
shepherd, sent there with the holy 
priesthood and the power of God, 
to preach unto them, they knew by 
that voire that it was the voice of 
the Shepherd, It sank into their 
hearts and .they believed. Today 
you can travel over the Pacific isles 
from Hawaii to New Zealand, and 
you will find that they are all Crk- 
tians, they all believe in God. O.tr 
work now is to convert them to the 
true form of Christianity, and make 
them Latter-day Saints, that they 
might have a fulness of the gospel ; 
that they might go on, learning 
day by dav the principles of the 
gospel, until they shall be exalted 
in the kingdom of heaven. 

I rejoice in, the fact that a 
temple has been erected there, and 
I trust that the Lord will bless and 
magnify the elders laboring in that 
field so that they may be inspired 
to teach the people, to trace their 
genealogy, that they may be able to 
find their lineage, because it will 
be a difficult matter to do. But 
this work can be accomplished in 
the house of the Lord, and many 
shall rejoice and rise up and call 
the name of the Lord blessed. 



I have a testimony that thi's is 
the work of the Lord, and I re- 
joice to be in his service. I have 
labored three years in the Hawai- 
ian Islands as a missionary. The 
past five years I have spent in the 
California mission, serving there 
under the direction of President 
Robinson. I love him ; he has been 
a power and a strength to me. He 
has encouraged and blessed me. He 
has been to me as a father. I have 
been in his home and have been as 
welcome as if I belonged there. He 
has treated me as well as if I was 
his own flesh and blood, and he has 
blessed me. During time of sick- 
ness and sorrow, he has always 
been at my side, and I know that 
the Lord will bless him and honor 
and respect him now that he has 
been released, for he has made a 
splendid record in that field. 

Yesterday, in listening to the re- 
marks of Brother McKay, when 
he upheld father's family as an ex- 
ample in the Church, I thought 1 
would like to add a little to what 
he said for the benefit of parents 
in Zion. Sometimes I think it is 
a good thing for children to give 
counsel, for T have had good teach- 
ings all my life. I have had a 
father and a mother who would not 
permit me to go out at night, un- 
less I would inform them where I 
was going and when I would re- 
turn. I was not permitted to come 
into my home at will, at any hour 
of the night, but I had to give an 
account of myself. When I re- 
paired to mv bed, it was always af- 
ter receiving- a kiss from my father 
or my mother, and being tucked in 
mv bed. "^hi* was a safeguard 
over me and a protection. But I 
dare sav there are many parents in 
Zion who fail to do this. Their 
children are a law unto themselves. 



124 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



They go here and there at will. 
They take automobiles, and go 
"joy" riding during half of the 
night, into the wee hours of the 
morning. They come in any time 
they desire, go to bed, and the par- 
ents never question them to ask 
where they have been, with whom 
they have been associating or what 
they have been doing. My father 
exercised a supervision over his 
children, and I think that is the 
reason why he attained the success 
that he did in rearing a family that 
respected him and loved him. It 
has been my privilege to associate 
with my father a great deal of my 
life. During the time I was in Cal- 
ifornia I stayed with him, and was 
by his side. Since I was married 
he requested that I remain at the 
home, and be by his side, where 1 
could assist him, and I have 
grown to love him not only 
because he was my father, but be- 
cause I know that he was a prophet 
of God. I know that he was in- 
spired of God, and I looked upon 
him as a prophet, and as my father. 
This is a little word of counsel 
from a boy who has had the 
experience of giving an accounting 
of himself. 

When this life's mission is 
completed, I expect to be able 
to meet my Father in heaven 
and there give an accounting of 
my labors in the flesh. I desire my 
Father in heaven to know where 
I am at night, and where I am in 
the daytime. I want him to know 
the company I choose. I want him 
to know my associates. I want him 
to watch me when I go to my sleep 
at night, and have his Holy Spirit to 
guide me that I may ever be found 
faithful, walking in the narrow 
path, seeking to know his will and 



praying for strength to do his 
wilt. 

May the Lord bless everyone of 
us in Zion that we may realize that 
the youth of Zion, our boys and 
girls who are growing up, will be- 
come the leaders of this Church, 
men and women upon whom the 
sponsibility will rest. Therefore, 
it is your duty to guide your chil- 
dren, to know where they are. Do 
not give them too much liberty. 
Make them give an . accounting ; 
kiss them when they go to bed at 
night. If your boy comes in to 
you with his mouth saturated with 
Honor or tobacco ,or with the stench 
of smoke upon his clothes, find out 
why, and cure the evil. This is my 
prayer in' the name of the Lord 
Jesus Christ. Amen, j

T will ask Brother Ballard to sing 
the song that we have heard about 
this morning: 

Brother Ballard then sang: "I'll

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANt! 

One of our great missions today 
is conducted on this block, by El- 
der Benjamin Goddard and his as- 
sistants in the Bureau of Informa- 
tion. We will now hear from 
Brother Goddard. 

! 

ELDER BEN J. GODDARD 

(Of the Bureau of Information.) 

My brethren and sisters, I trust 
the Lord will aid me in perform 
" ing this duty, which comes to me 
very unexpectedly. I rejoice in the 
spirit of this conference; my soul 
has- rejoiced within me in listening 
to the testimonies of my brethren, 
and performing other duties as- 
signed unto rre. 

In connection with our work up- 
on this block, I have pleasure in, 
stating that our missionaries — from 
forty to fiftv brethren and sisters — 
labor most diligently, day after day, 
in meeting the strangers within our 
gates. It is our privilege to wel- 
come them to Zion and to repre- 
■ p---- our faith, telling them that 
which the Latter-day Saints stand 
for, directing their attention to the 
organization of our Church, and 
speaking of that which was re- 
vealed unto the Prophet Joseph 
Smith ; describing also that won- 
derful vision in. the sacred grove, 
telling them of the authority po- 
sessed by our elders who are going 
to every nation, kindred, tongue 
and people. We bear testimony 
unto the strangers who know very 
little of "Mormonism" when they 
come within these gates, that God 
has indeed established his Church 



upon the earth, and however feeble 
our young elders may be who are 
bearing their testimonies they art 
laboring in the authority of the 
holy priesthood. We testify that 
the Baptist has come again, restor- 
ing the Aaronic priesthood. We 
testify and read unto the enquirers 
the revelation', Section 27 of the 
Doctrine and 'Covenants, showing 
the great work that God has in 
store for us, and that the authority 
of the Melchizedek priesthood has 
come unto us through the minis- 
trations of Peter, James and John.' 
When the strangers come here they 
listen most attentivelv to what we 
have to say. Our brethren and sis- 
ters occasionally have from thre<r 
hundred to four hundred in one 
group, who will listen, frequently, 
• « 'be testimonies that are borne, 
and will eagerly ask questions and 
desire to learn more. The spirit of 
the Latter-day work is on this 
block; we cannot stand under the 
shadow of the temple, which we 
have to do often every day, des- 
cribing the building, pointing to 
the figure upon the central tower, 
representing Moroni who brought 
unto us the fulness of the gospel, 
and through whose ministrations 
we are blest with the Book of Mor- 
mon, without feeling the spirit of 
that sacred house. The people are 
coming to the tops of the moun- 
tains, they are gazing on the House 
of, the Lord, established through 
the faith and the fidelity ' of the 
Latter-day Saints, and are eager to 
learn just what the work in the 
temple means. We tcien explain 
the great work that you brethren 
and sisters are engaged in — the mis-

something new to the great major- 
ity of people who come here, and 
they eargerly desire to learn more. 
Women call at times, clad in dark 
drapery, indicating their breave- 
ment through loved ones being 
taken away, and they are always 
interested in the subject of salva- 
tion for the dead, and desire to 
know just how they*may meet their 
loved ones again. 

I testify unto you that the work 
of the Lord is growing in the earth ; 
that a spirit of inquiry is amongst 
the people. They are anxious to 
know what "Mormonism" is. We 
are delighted to tell them what it 
means, and they go from our midst 
impressed with that which we have 
told them, and they are eager to 
meet our missionaries in other 
places. One lady missionary re- 
turning from the Northern States, 
last week, told me that in the city 
of Detroit on one street she had 
met nine families that had been rep- 
resented amongst the visitors on 
this block. They had received of 
our hospitality and were delightea 
to receive the missionaries and to 
learn more with regard to our 
faith. Thus we endeavor to break 
down prejudice, to remove bigotry, 
to impress upon the strangers with- 
in our gates that which "Mormon- 
is" stands for — fidelity to" God an 1 
to all his laws, sustaining the priest- 
hood which God has placed upon 
the earth. 

I rejoice in meeting you, my 
brethren and sisters, we shall be 
pleased to welcome and entertain 
you within the walls of the Bureau 
of Information. I pray that the 
Spirit of the Lord may continue to 
rest upon us ; that his work may 
continue to roll forth, until his pur- 
poses are fully established in the 
earth, and to that end with all my 



soul I sustain the man whom you 
have sustained in this conference 
as prophet, seer and revelator. Goq 
bless the brethren who stand at the 
head of this Chtfrch. May the 
Lord soften our hearts, make them 
open to receive the instructions 
given unto us, and may we have 
a desire in our hearts continually 
to fulfil every obligation placed up- 
on us, sustaining the priesthood 
and laboring for the good of Zion, 
I ask in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen.

ELDER SAMUEL O. BENNION 

(President of the Central States 
Mission.) 

In the mission field, I have often 
said to the missionaries that in. this 
Church things do not happen by 
chance but by appointment; and I 
add to that the statement that God 
rules and reigns ; that this is his 
work ;that he is at the helm and 
that his work, established here up- 
on the earth, is for the purpose of 
bringing back to him his children 
who are away from home, out on 
missions in the world. I feel that 
we are away from home in this 
earth; that we have been sent, at 
an appointed time, into the world 
to prove unto the Lord what we 
will do under certain conditions and 
circumstances. I appreciate more 
fully every day of my life the fact 
that I have been so favored of the 
Lord as to come into the world 
when his gospel is here and his 
holy priesthood is in force among 
the children of men ; when he has 
prophets and apostles and officers 
in the Church appointed by his di- 
vine command and under his direc- 
tion, so that there could be no mis- 
take, and that men who desire to 



ELDER SAMUEL 0. BENNION 



127 



serve him might know the truth. 

The Priesthood of the Son of 
God is sacred, and that man who 
holds it has been entrusted with a 
charge that he cannot treat lightly 
and enjoy the blessings and the tes- 
timony of this gospel. This is the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints, revealed from heaven 
in the Dispensation of the Fulness 
of Times in which we live. Men 
have received it by direct revela- 
tion; men have received a knowl- 
edge of it in the dreams of the 
night; men have been visited by 
angels until there can be no question 
as to the stand of this Church of our 
God here in the earth. 

A short time ago I received a 
letter from a young man, in one of 
the states in the mission over which 
I have had the privilege to pre- 
side for some time, asking me to 
send a missionary to baptize him. 
It was at a time when missionaries 
were very scarce. I think we had 
only four in that state. I wrote 
him a letter, stating : "We will send 
you the elders just as soon as they 
can go there.", I encouraged him 
in what he had said in his letter, 
telling him to continue to investi- 
gate, and in the own due time of 
the Lord the elders would baptize 
him. He was a stranger to me. I 
sent the letter to the president of 
that conference and I said to him: 
"When it is convenient for you to 
do so, either visit this gentleman or 
send one of the elders to baptize 
him." Shortly after that we had a 
conference in that state; I had for- 
gotten the incident entirely, but the 
'conference president had notified 
the young man that we were going 
to hold a conference and invited him 
to come to the city where we would 
hold our meetings. The young man 
attended our priesthood meeting, 



and his tears flowed freely. He 
enjoyed the Spirit of the Lord as 
the testimonies of the elders were 
given, until the last one had spoken, 
to a degree I presume that few men 
have had the privilege of witness- 
ing. He told me that he had prayed 
earnestly to know which church 
was right. He said: "I made it a 
matter of prayer for weeks, and I 
desired to know which church was 
right, and the name of the Church. 
I awoke one night with these words 
before me, in my mind — the Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints. I had never heard of the 
Church. I remembered having met 
some of the "Mormon" elders sever- 
al years before, when they left some 
of their literature with us. I hunted 
it up, and I found the name of the 
Central States mission upon it. That 
is why I wrote you that letter." 

I know, my brethren and sisters, 
as I stand here, that he spoke the 
truth ; that God had revealed unto 
him the truth. It was an answer to 
the prayers of a righteous man. He 
was away from home, out in the 
world, struggling for a living, in 
poverty, but he borrowed the means 
to come to conference. The Lord 
had revealed the truth unto him, and 
he was brave enough, notwithstand- 
ing the fact that his wife told him 
if he was baptized she would leave 
him — he was brave enough to stand 
for the right, to go down into the 
waters of baptism, and another wit- 
ness of God's power was given un- 
to the children of men in this dis- 
pensation. 

I have witnessed some remark- 
able manifestations of the Spirit 
and power of God in my calling as 
'a mission president. I want to say 
to the young men who happen to be 
in this conference that when you 
are sent to a mission or to a con- 



128 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



ference you must bear in mind that 
God rules and reigns and that he 
knows you ; that you did not go into 
the mission field by chance, but un- 
der the inspiration and power of 
God you were called by the men 
who 'stand at the head of the 
Church. Some months ago four 
young men came into the Central 
States mission. We had received 
but very few elders for months 
past, on account of the influenza, 
and a certain portion of our mis- 
sion was very much in need of el- 
ders, as we had only one or two in 
a great territory. I said to the 
secretary of the mission: "We will 
send these four men to such and 
such a place, away into the South, 
a thousand miles from Kansas 
City." He said : "I believe that is 
the place they ought to go. We 
need them there." But when I 
thought about it, I saw three of 
those boys sitting together and one 
apart, at one side. I could not get 
the vision of those boys out of my 
mind, and so I said to the secretary : 
"Elder Piatt, we will leave it until 
tomorrow. We can't send them 
out today anyway." In the morn- 
ing when I met again with the 
young men, I was going to say we 
would send them all to this certain 
place; but in my mind again three- 
of them sat together and one was 
by himself. I said to the three : "We 
will send you to Texas." To this 
young man I said : 'We will keep 
you here, and you may labor in 
Kansas City." I did not know why 
I had come to this decision. I bat- 
tled against it, because I wanted to 
send him away, but a month after 
that time, in a priesthood meeting, 
he bore his testirnpny and mentioned 
the fact that when he was a boy, 
ten years of age, he had been prom- 
ised by a patriarch, in his patriarch- 



al blessing, that he would grow up 
and fill a mission, and that he would, 
be sent to the state of Missouri. 
Then I found out why I was im- 
pressed to keep that young man in 
the state of Missouri. 

At another conference I attended 
shortly after that, an elder bore his • 
testimony in a priesthood meeting, 
in which he related the following 
incident : He was put trading one 
day, and as he approached the home 
of a certain lady, she said to him: 
"Come in, you are the man I saw 
in my dream." She was a Turkish 
woman ; her father was a Moham- 
medan. She had been in this coun- 
try perhaps ten or fifteen years. 
She related unto him how she had 
been praying earnestly for the 
truth and the Lord had shown her 
in the dreams of the night this 
elder; so that when he walked up 
to her door, stood on the steps with 
that book in his hand, she recog- 
nized him and said : "Come in, for I 
have seen you in a dream." 

I want to say to you again, breth- 
ren and sisters, men and women 
have had blessings pronounced up- 
on their heads before this world 
was, and they are being fulfilled 
here according to the faithfulness 
of those who have received them. I 
have lived in company with the 
best men and women upon this 
earth.' I have associated at home 
with the leaders of this Church 
since the days of my appointment 
in the ministry some years ago, and 
in the mission field I have associ- 
ated with boys and men and wom- 
en who have been appointed to 
preach the gospel, and who have 
lived lives that give such radiance 
and influence as testify that they 
are sent of God and that there can- 
not be anything better on this earth. 
The influence of missionaries is

heavenly. I want to say to you, 
my brethren and sisters, we are liv- 
ing in a precious time, and enjoy- 
ing blessings that the world at large 
will never know. Happy is the man 
or woman who receives a call to go 
into the ministry and who fulfils it 
honorably and honestly, and who 
works for the good of the children 
of men. Many times when I have 
held conferences all day with the 
people, having later to leave in a 
few hours, I have said to the elders : 
"We will go out into the park of 
this city, as the night is hot, and I 
will visit with you, brethren ; we 
will sit down upon the seats, draw 
them together, and I will spend my 
time with you until we have to sep- 
arate." I want to tell you here to- 
day that I have received undeniable 
manifestations of God's power. I 
■believe the angels of heaven have 
been with us; there is no influence, 
no spirit' more sweet than that man- 
ifested when those bo^s sit down 
and talk to you as they would talk 
to each other, ask questions and 
say : "We are glad to be here. We 
love you. We love the work of the 
Lord." 

I have said to those elders: 
"When you go into the field there 
is only one thing to do, and that is 
to work and pray. If you will pray 
in the morning and pray at night 
and keep at work, God will inspire 
you so that, although you, may be 
alone, you will be able to withstand 
the attacks of the adversary, with 
the power of a prophet, and with a 
power that has never been witnessed 
by you in all your life, and you will 
go home again clean and honorably 
released. It will be not only a 
pleasure to you, not only a gift of 
God unto you, but you will be a 
blessing to the people, to the boys 



and girls with whom you associate 
when you return." 

In my closing remarks I wish to 
say: If you fathers and mothers 
can extend the time of a missionary 
from twenty-four ■ months to thirty 
months, and give that boy six 
months more training in the field, 
you can not make a better invest- 
ment while you are here upon the 
earth. I pray the Lord to bless us 
in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER THEODORE TOBIASON 

(President of the Swedish Mission.) 

Beloved brethren and sisters, I 
am pleased to have this opportu- 
nity to stand before you and bear 
my testimony concerning the great 
work in which we are engaged. It 
is only a short time since I came 
back from Sweden, and I am pleas- 
ed with the opportunity of return- 
ing again, inasmuch as the servants 
of the Lord have seen fit to call me 
into the mission field. I trust that 
I shall be able to do some good 
while I am away, in bearing testi- 
mony to the restoration of the gos- 
pel of Christ, as we Latter-day 
Saints have received it. I am thank- 
ful for the gospel and for the 
Church of which you and I are 
members. I am thankful for the 
testimony which the Lord has im- 
planted in my soul, and I know this 
is the work of the Lord. I know 
these, my brethren, whom we have 
had the privilege of sustaining at 
this conference are servants of 
God, called by him to stand at the 
head to direct his work in this dis- 
pensation and at this time. I can 
especially bear testimony, my breth- 
ren and sisters, concerning our be- 
loved president. 



130 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



I wish to relate an incident of 
which I have spoken two or three 
times before ; but I want to bear you 
my testimony that God has' shown 
me that President Heber J. Grant 
is the right man in the right place. 
Some four weeks ago, in the tem- 
ple of our God, at a fast meeting, 
the President was speaking. I was 
sitting on my seat, looking very in- 
tently upon him, as I do upon all 
speakers, desiring to hear all they 
say. All of a sudden, President 
Grant had disappeared; I did not 
see him, but I saw our beloved pres- 
ident, Joseph F. Smith, who depart- 
ed this life a few months ago. I 
saw the mantle of the Prophet rest- 
ing upon our beloved brother, and 
I thought that this was another tes- 
timony unto me that he was the 
right man in the right place. I had 
never doubted but what this was 
the case — never in the world. I 
know the order of the Church too 
well for that; but God made mani- 
fest unto me that the mantle of the 
Prophet had fallen upon President 
Grant, and he was indeed his 
legal and lawful successor. Sev- 
eral of my brethren and sisters 
have come to me, after I had 
spoken of this matter and even 
today, saying that ' they saw the 
same thing. I knpw this is true. 
1 have heard some of the Saints tell, 
who were in Nauvoo at the time, 
or shortly after, the Prophet was 
martyred, how, when the Prophet 
Brigham Young was speaking, they 
saw the mantle of the Prophet Jo- 
seph Smith fall upon him, and they 
knew that he was the right man to 
stand at the head and lead Israel. 
I bear you my testimony, concern- 
ing our beloved president, . that that 
is the case now : the mantle of the 
prophet has fallen upon him. The 
spirit of the prophet is in his soul 



and in the souls of those of my 
brethren whom we have sustained 
here. I can sustain them with all 
my heart. 

Some people say: "Why, you 
folks are foolish to spend so much 
of your time in the missionary field. 
You are imposed upon by those who 
preside over you." I will say this, 
that when the prophet of God 
speaks, I obey. I would not think 
for a moment of making any ex- 
cuses or of trying to get out of any 
duty or work that may be placed 
upon me, when the Lord says so 
and so is the case ; we desire you to 
do so and so. 

I know that the gospel is true and 
that it is the power of God unto 
salvation for all those who will live 
in harmony with it. I know that 
in the gospel is the -only true free- 
dom that can be enjoyed here on 
the earth. The Savior said, when 
many were finding fault with 
him, when many tried to catch 
him in his words, that there were 
some who believed in him, and he 
said to them : "If ye continue in 
my word, then are ye my disci- 
ples indeed. And ye shall know 
the truth, and the truth shall make 
you free." There is nothing under 
the heavens, nothing on the earth 
or anywhere else, nothing but the 
truth that can make men and wo- 
men free. If they are made free in 
the truth and by the truth, they are 
free men indeed, and they are not 
slaves. It is because of this testi- 
mony that is within our souls that 
we know that God speaks through 
his servants, and we obey, not be- 
cause we are slaves ; no, but we are 
truly free men, and we know the 
voice of the Good Shepherd when 
we hear it, and strive to order our 
lives accordingly. 



ELDER REY L. PRATT 



131 



May the Lord bless us, and help 
us all to be true and faithful. Let 
us never find fault, my brethren 
and sisters, with those whom the 
Lord has appointed, but let us sus- 
tain them with all our souls. If we 
hear anyone finding fault, let us. 
take them to task and show them 
the way to go; and if we will sus- 
tain his chosen servants on earth, 
the Lord will sustain us ; he will 
honor us. The Lord delights to 
honor those who serve him in right- 
eousness and in truth unto the end. 
May this be our happy lot, I ask in 
the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER REY L. PRATT 

(President of the Mexican Mission.) 

. I sincerely trust, my brethren and 
sisters, that I may be able this af- 
ternoon to briefly express my feel- 
ings and bear unto you the testi- 
mony that abides in me concern- 
ing the truthfulness of the work in 
which we are engaged. To those 
of us who come from the mission 
field,' from our labors in the world, 
it is a special treat to meet at these 
conferences and to listen to the 
teachings of the brethren who pre- 
side over us in the priesthood. I 
have thought as I have listened to 
the inspired words that have fallen 
from the lips of the speakers 
throughout this conference, that the 
prayer uttered by J. G. Holland, 
and mentioned by Elder Ivins in his 
remarks, has truly been answered in 
the men who surround us and stand 
at the head of the Church today; 
and as for that matter, I do not re- 
member a time in my life when the 
same could not have been said of 
the authorities and the leaders of 
the Church. I was born in the 
Church ; I spent my boyhood days 



in Salt Lake City, and it has ever 
been a delight to me to sit and lis- 
ten to the teachings of the brethren 
of the apostles and the presidency 
of the Church, the first seven presi- 
dents of seventy, and those who 
minister among the people. I can- 
not remember the time when I did 
not know President Grant, and per- 
haps he never has known it, but 
from my boyhood days he has been 
an ideal of mine, a man that I have 
1ooke r1 vmn as one that I might 
follow with safety. I am thankful 
to the Lord to have been permitted 
in this conference to stand upon my 
feet and raise my hand and cove- 
nant with the Lord that I will sus- 
tain him as a prophet, a seer and a 
revelator unto the Church, and the 
President of the Church. I mean, 
brethren and sisters, that I will do 
that. I shall sustain him, and I 
shall sustain the brethren associated 
with him, and all the appointments 
that he makes. I am willing to 
recognize in him the mouthpiece of 
the Lord, and when I receive a call 
from him to go or to come, I shall 
consider it ?s coming directlv fro'-n 
the Lor*-'. I can answer that I will 
go where he wants me to go, and 
stav when he wants me to stay. 

I rejoice in the gospel; I know 
that it is true. My heart goes out 
today to the people who are not 
acauainted with these truths, to the 
people who are not acquainted with 
the gospel, to the great num- 
ber of our Father's children 
in the world who have not 
yet received a testimony of the 
truthfulness of the gospel, who are, 
in a measure, in darkness. My great 
r'esire is to continue to labor faith- 
r -- n " and humbly in the preaching 
of the gospel and to teach the people 
of the world the wav to live, teach 
them the truth bv which they might 



132 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



be made free and the path which 
they might follow to find a way 
back into the kingdom of our 
Father in heaven. It seems to me, 
brethren and sisters, as I have no- 
ticed conditions in the world, that 
there never was a more opportune 
time than the present for the 
preaching of the gospel. It seems 
there never was a time when it was 
more needed than it is today; ana, 
I do not know whether I have felt 
just right about it or not, but n 
seems to me that the time is near 
at hand when the Church will be 
called upon to do, even more than 
it has done in the past in the 
preaching of the gospel unto the 
people of the earth. I find, in parts 
of the United States where I have 
traveled, where missionary work 
has been done off and on ever since 
the Church was organized, that 
there are many people who have 
no knowledge of the gospel, who 
hive "ever had its principles ex- 
plained unto them. There is a 
lick of laborers in the vineyard; 
there '.s room for many, many more 
than those who are now engaged in 
the ministry. 

My particular work, brethren 
and sisters, has been to the Mexi- 
can people. I realize very well the 
odium and almost hatred under 
which the people of Mexico are 
laboring today, because of the con- 
ditions that exist in their country. 
But T want to tell you, brethren 
and sisters, that they are the Lord's 
children and the Lord loves them. 
Further than that, they are his cov- 
enant people. I wish to explain to 
■-.0-1 this afternoon that the Mexi- 
can people along with the Indians 
of Vorth America and the people 
of Central and South America are 
the Lamanites. They are the peo- 
ple- who are the descendants of 



Lehi, through his disobedient sons, 
Laman and Lemuel. But they have 
the promise of the Lord extended 
to them. I would like to read to 
you this afternoon to explain our 
relationship as a people to this 
branch of the Lord's covenant peo- 
ple; for I sometimes feel that we 
forget that the gospel is unto all 
the world. We forget, some of us, 
at least, that the Lord is able to 
raise up even those who are down- 
trodden and down-cast, and who 
labor under a curse, as these people 
do. I wish to call your attention 
this afteroon to our responsibilities 
before that neople. We realize our 
responsibilities, pretty well, I take 
it, with reference to the people of 
other nations ; but I find many peo- 
ple who say to me, in referring to 
the people among whom I have 
labored : "Would it not be a good 
thing for the Lord to wipe them 
off the earth and people their coun- 
try with somebody else?" It 
touches my heart. I love the peo- 
ple among whom the Lord has 
called me to labor, and I desire to 
continue to labor for their uplift 
and for their redemption. I take 
hope in the fact that the Lorcl has 
promised that they should be re- 
deemed from their fallen condition, 
and I feel a responsibility because 
he has also said that their redemp- 
tion should come at the hands of 
the Gentiles, people among whom 
the fulness of the gospel should be 
restored. Nephi, in explaining to 
his brethren a vision received by his 
father, said : 

"Behold, I say unto you, that the 
house of Israel was compared unto 
an olive-tree, by the Spirit of the 
Lord which was in our fathers; and 
behold are we not broken off from the 
house of Israel? and are we not a 
branch of the house of Israel? 

"And now, the, thing which our 



ELDER REY L. PRATT 



133 



father meaneth concerning the graft- 
ing in of the natural branches through 
the fulness of the Gentiles, is, that 
in the latter days, when our seed shall 
have dwindled in unbelief, yea, for the 
space of many years, and many gen- 
erations after the Messiah shall be 
manifested in body unto the children 
of men, then shall the fulness of the 
gospel of the Messiah come unto the 
Gentiles, and from the Gentiles unto 
the remnant of our seed: 

"And at that day shall the remnant 
of our seed know that they are of the 
house of Israel, and that they are the 
covenant people of the Lord; and 
then shall they know and come to the 
knowledge of their forefathers, and 
also to the knowledge of the gospel of 
their Redeemer which was ministered 
unto their fathers by him; wherefore 
they shall come to the knowledge of 
their Redeemer and the very points 
of his doctrine, that they may know 
how to come unto him and be saved. 

"And then at that day will they not 
rejoice and give praise unto their 
everlasting God, their rock and their 
salvation? Yea, at that day, will they 
not receive the strength and nourish- 
ment from the true vine? Yea, will 
they not come unto the true fold of 
God? 

"Behold, I say unto you, Yea; they 
shall be remembered again among 
the house of Israel; they shall be 
grafted in, being a natural branch of 
the olive tree, into the true olive tree; 

"And this is what our father mean- 
eth; and he meaneth that it will not 
come to pass until after they are scat- 
tered by the Gentiles; and he meaneth 
that it shall come by way of the Gen- 
tiles; that the Lord may shew his 
power unto the Gentiles, for the very 
cause that he shall be rejected of the 
Jews, or of the house of Israel." 

We see, then, by this, my breth- 
ren and sisters, that the mission of 
redeeming - that people is resting up- 
on our shoulders ; for I testify to 
you this afternoon that I know that 
the gospel of the Redeemer has 
been restored unto us, and that 
through the instrumentality of the 
Prophet Joseph Smith the Church 
of' God has been organized and ex- 



ists upon the earth. The gospel 
is here and with it the powers there- 
of. The power of the holy priest- 
hood exists in the Church today, 
the right to call men to repentance, 
the right, the commission of God 
to man to call men to repentance 
and administer in all of the ordin- 
ances necessary for the salvation 
of men. I testify to you further, 
that I know that an angel of the 
Lord delivered to this same 
Prophet the golden record written 
by prophets of an ancient day, 
from which this book was trans- 
lated, and I testify to you that I 
know that the Book of Mormon Is 
the word of God, it contains the 
gospel of the Redeemer, and it 
speaks of our duties towards the 
descendants of this people. Breth- 
ren and sisters, just one more word 
before I conclude: 

"And now, I would prophesy some- 
what more concerning the Jews and 
the Gentiles. For after the book of 
which I have spoken shall come forth, 
and be written unto the Gentiles, and 
sealed up again unto the Lord there 
shall be many which shall believe, the 
words which are written, and they 
shall carry them forth unto the rem- 
nant of our seed. 

"And then shall the remnant of our 
seed know concerning us, how that 
we came out from Jerusalem, and that 
they are descendants of the Jews. 

"And the gospel of Jesus Christ 
shall be declared among them; where- 
fore, they shall be restored unto the 
knowledge of their fathers, and also 
to the knowledge of Jesus Christ, 
which was had among their fathers." 

I sense the responsibility of this 
call, my brethren and sisters, and 
I trust that my ministry will bear 
out the testimony that I have giveri 
here today, that I do love them, 
and that I desire to serve them ; 
for I know that in serving them 
and endeavoring to bring them to 
a knowledge of the Lord I am

serving him and that I will get my 
reward. I am thankful to the Lord 
that young men are being called to- 
day to labor in the Mexican mis- 
sion and among the Indians 
throughout the Southwest of tht 
United States, over whom I, per- 
haps, shall have the honor of pre- 
siding. I would like to say to the 
young men of Israel, do not deem 
it a misfortune to be called to labor 
among that people; it is a grand, 
a glorious privilege, and not a cross, 
that has come to you. 

O, boys, try to get the spirit of it, 
to live up to the hymn that has been 
sung during this conference, and 
believe it when you say, "I'll go 
where you want me to go, clear 
Lord, I'll do what you want me 
to do, I'll say what you want me 
to say." 

O, you mothers, let your boys go 
out with the spirit of service m 
their hearts, not with a desire to 
acquire polish, to get an education, 
and to come home and shine as 
bright lights, but encourage them 
through your letters to them, to go 
out and to feel after those who are 
out there who are in darkness, those 
who are hungering and thirsting 
after righteousness, those who need 
the spiritual food that can be ad- 
ministered unto them by none 
others than the members of this 
Church who have the priesthood of 
Almighty God, and the right to 
minister and call men to repentance, 
to baptize for the remission of sin. 
I want to tell you that the man who 
goes out in the spirit of true service 
will come back greater than the man 
who goes out expecting and aim- 
ing to get polish. We are told in 
the book of Doctrine and Cove- 
nants that we should not go out to 
be taught. I think sometimes we 
should not go out to learn. We 



are told distinctly we should go out 
to teach. We are supposed to 
know, we are supposed to have a 
knowledge of the truth, and we are 
supposed to have a testimony ana 
be able to teach the world that by 
which it may be saved. 

I want to testify that I know that 
God lives, that Jesus is his Son, 
that he came in the meridian of 
time, that he is the Redeemer of tht 
world ; and I testify to you further 
that I know that Joseph Smith 
was a Prophet and that through 
him the gospel, which is the power 
of God unto salvation, is established 
again in the world. I testify to 
you that I know that the men who 
have succeeded the Prophet Joseph 
Smith, as seers and revelators and 
prophets unto this Church, are 
indeed prophets, seers and revela- 
ators. I testify further that I 
know that Heber J. Grant, who 
stands at the head of the Churcn 
today, is God's mouthpiece unto 
not only the Church, but the whole 
world, and whatever the Lord has 
to say to the world today, he will 
say through that instrumentality. 
May the Lord bless us and help us 
to thank him for a prophet, and to 
show our thankfulness by obedi- 
ence to the words that shall come 
to us from him, is my prayer in the 
name of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER CHARLES W. NIBLEY 

(Presiding Bishop of the Church.) 

I have very much enjoyed this 
conference and the spirit of it, and 
I know that the Saints will return 
from these gatherings with a feel- 
ing in their souls that the Lord is 
with his people, the Latter-day 
Saints, and he is still at the helm. 
I believe the Lord is pleased witn 



BISHOP CHARLES W. NIBLEY 



135 



his Church as a whole. I think that 
will be the opinion of the brethren 
and sisters who leave this confer- 
ence, who have been attending 
faithfully at these meetings. 

There has run through the ser- 
mons, the addresses, the remarks of 
the brethren who have spoken, this 
thread of thought that there will' 
soon be a great spiritual awakening 
in the world and a great missionary 
movement in the Church, which 
will go out from the Church and ac- 
complish more than has ever hith- 
erto been accomplished in its his- 
tory. I believe in that thought. I 
have felt that spirit and influence 
from the day that President Grant 
was made President of the Church. 
The world begins to see what wt 
hav€ to give. If I were asked to 
state what is the greatest need of 
the world today, I would answer in 
these words : "The knowledge ot 
God." There be lords many and 
gods many. Men have ideas of 
God and godliness in multitudi- 
nous forms ; but to know the only 
true and living God — that is the 
greatest need of all the world to- 
day. It is he whom we worship; 
it is he whom we serve. Within 
this Chur&h of Jesus Christ of Lat- 
ter-day Saints — and only within 
this Church — is the key of the 
knowledge of God. Herein is sal- 
vation for you and me, and salva- 
tion for all the world. In this 
book, the Doctrine and Covenants, 
are covenants and commandments, 
doctrines and principles, which 
form the only league that will ever 
enforce peace in all the world. 
Herein we are told of the doctrine 
of obedience, and we try to follow 
it. We are told of the doctrine of 
community and social life, and we 
try to live according to those pre- 
cepts. The government of the 



Church, the government of the peo- 
ple, the organization of the Church 
and of the priesthood quorums sup- 
plementing the work of the civil 
government, is far better and great- 
er in every way than anything that 
man has ever yet known. There is 
salvation in it all. No man of him- 
self can teach it. He must have the 
influence and the spirit of it, ana 
there goes with this work, with 
these quorums of the priesthood, 
with these organizations in the 
wards and branches and stakes and 
missions, a spirit, an influence and 
a power that are of God, that man 
cannot give, that man cannot take 
away, and of which the world does 
not know. Therein is the key, as 
we are told in this book of revela- 
tion — the key of knowledge of 
God whom to know is life eternal. 

Organized under this leag'ue, this 
covenant, you have the true organ- 
ization from the Lord which will 
bring peace. Oh what peace ! A 
peace that passeth understanding. 
It is good for my soul ; it is gooci 
for you and for all mankind. When 
this is established, we will have a 
society extending and growing 
where there will be no I. W. W. or 
labor troubles. Why? Because in 
this league and covenant, the doc- 
trine is laid down that the idler 
shall not eat the bread of the labor- 
er. Everyone shall work and labor 
according to his strength and his 
ability. Therein is salvation, and 
no salvation outside of that. 'We 
are told in this league and cov- 
enant how we shall conduct our- 
selves in our homes, as we heard 
from Elder McKay yesterday; 
what we shall eat, that is good 
for us, and what we shall drink 
or abstain from drinking. We 
are told that we shall retire 
early and rise early, and how we 



136 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



shall live, in order to prolong- our 
lives and be strong and healthful. 
The Lord tells of this in this cov- 
enant ; for, as the Lord says, it 
a man is faithful in receiving these 
priesthoods, and keeping the com- 
mandments of the Lord, his body 
shall be renewed; his strength 
will be renewed beyond his years, 
so that he shall live to be aged 
and strong like President Penrost? 
and President Lund and many 
others that we have in our com- 
munity. We are told how to 
regulate our family life, how to 
govern and control our children, 
and teach them how to pray. In 
all the affairs of life, in all the 
activities with which we have to 
do, we may turn to this book, and 
here find instruction. Here is 
guidance, here is direction, here 
is complete salvation, and no- 
where else than here. The author- 
ity of the Holy Priesthood of the 
Son of God is here. The Lord 
whom he has chosen, and as 
Brother Joseph Fielding Smith 
said yesterday, a truth that we 
ought to know and remember al- 
ways — that no man will ever 
come to the presidency, of this 
Church unless the Lord wants him 
to be there. Don't forget that. 

Now there is a great work to 
do. I ask myself : am I doing m> 
share? In the olden times I know 
our parents went through great 
trials and made great sacrifices. 
In the days of the early apostles of 
this Church they made great sacri- 
fices. Read of the time, in 1838 
and '39, when the Lord told the 
Twelve to go over the great water, 
to go to England and establish 
missions. The conditions in which 
they left their families and the con- 
ditions under which they went, and 
stayed and returned, were all very 



trying. The sacrifice that our 
fathers and mothers made in the 
building up of this country were 
very great. But are you making 
any particular sacrifice now? Am 
I making any particular sacrifice? 
I do not know that I am. We go 
out to the conferences and preach 
here and there, we talk to the 
Saints ; we are well cared for. We 
have good beds in which to sleep, 
and when we are hungry we are 
furnished the best that the land af- 
fords, for us to eat. I do not call 
that much of a sacrifice. 

Now, my brethren and sisters, 
let us ask ourselves the question, 
and members of this Church every- 
where, how much of a sacrifice am 
I making for the work of the Lord 
today? Are vou? Not very much, 
as a rule. There is a sister here 
and there, a widow woman per- 
haps, here and there, with her son 
out on a mission. She is working 
hard to .sustain that son, she is mak- 
ing some sacrifice — a thousand 
times more than I am. Such as 
she are making sacrifices, but with 
you and me, and the rest of us, it 
is different, for we are not sacrific- 
ing very much. It is time that we 
should get it into our hearts that 
we, too, can make some .sacrifice, 
we, too, can help to do something 
to build up .the kingdom of God. 
There is a world to save, and herein 
I repeat, is the plan of salvation, and 
the only plan, the only salvation for 
the world is here in this league and 
covenant, which shall take in all the 
nations, in time. "For it shall come 
to pass," says one' of old, "that 
every knee .shall bow and every 
tongue shall confess" — confess 
what? "Confess that Jesus is the 
Christ, to the glory of God the 
Father." O, I hear it said some- 
times : "We have warned the 



BISHOP CHARLES W. NIBLEY 



137 



' world." We have, have we? Why, 

since President W~~ out 

as a missionary, and since Presi- 
dent Penrose started as a mission- 
ary, don't you know there have been 
two generations of men and women 
who have risen and fallen since 
then? There is a new generation 
now, and freedom has come to rule 
the world instead of force. That 
is the principle that has been fought 
out in the Great War that is now 
happily closing — that freedom shall 
rule, and that the rule of force shah 
never again assert itself for any 
length of time in this world. The 
great German poet Goethe saw this 
clearly, for in his play, "Faust," I 
think it is, he states it in these 
words, as I recall the translation. 
"This ancient truth" — very ancient 
truth, remember, older than the 
world itself — 

"This ancient truth still holds its 
course: 

If you adopt the rule of force, 
And boldly seek your chosen goal, 
You risk your own, your all, your 
soul." 

So the rule of force, by which 
the German emperor sought to 
dominate the world, has been van- 
quished, whipped, destroyed ; ana 
freedom has come now to all the 
world. There are generations of 
men and women growing up who 
have never heard the sound of this 
gospel. Cannot you do something? 
Cannot I do something? Am I 
not willing to sacrifice something 
that they may hear" this message? 
They are the children of my Father, 
my God. They are my brothers 
and sisters. Just consider what out 
Father says he sacrificed for you 
and for me : "Gad so loved the 
world" — do you love the world? 
Your son has been sent out, not 
voluntarily perhaps, some may 



have volunteered, but generally 
they were conscripted, but they 
have g'one and they have offered 
their lives for their country. Wasn't 
it a sacrifice? It was, and a great 
one, even when they return with 
their lives ; but God so loved the 
world that he gave his Only Be- 
gotten Son that mankind might not 
perish but have everlasting life. 
That is the sacrifice he made ; that 
is the sacrifice his Son made. Are 
we willing, am I willing, are you 
and all of us willing to make any 
sacrifice further for this work, this 
great cause, this great missionary 
movement and effort that is upon 
the Church, or will be, whereby 
mankind may be saved and come to 
a knowledge of the Son of God? 
The key of that knowledge of God 
rests with you. Men may think 
they know him ; men may try to 
understand him ; but by and with 
the organizations of this Church 
and through the authority of the 
holy priesthood, the power of godli- 
ness is manifested to men in the 
flesh ; but without this priesthood 
— so says this league and covenant 
— "without this priesthood and tne 
ordinances of the gospel, the power 
of godliness is not made manifest 
to men in the flesh." You have that 
knowledge. Shall we not share it, 
shall we not do something and say 
something to spread this truth 
abroad? We sing and repeat the 
song, that we are willing to do ; but 
how much am I doing? Not much. 
Doing may be according to my 
years and* strength and ability, 
what I am called to do; but I am 
making no particular sacrifice, I 
don't count it so, for a moment. On 
the contrary, I have been greatly 
benefited because of my connection 
with the Church. The Church has 
helped me infinitely more than I 



138 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



will ever be able to help it. And 
I see presidents of stakes and lead- 
ers of the people in this Church 
everywhere who likewise have been 
benefited greatly because of the po- 
sitions they have been called to fill 
in this Church. Who among us 
has the Church not helped? Who 
among us all can say that the 
Church has not been a foster father 
and a blessing in every way. So 
the Church has made me. Cannot 
I do something for the Church? 
The Lord has made us, and not we 
ourselves. Cannot we do something 
for him ? We are not doing a great 
deal yet. The Lord help us to re- 



solve anew in our hearts that by 
and with the help of his Spirit wc 
will be willing to sacrifice if need 
be and show him that for mankind 
we will do something. We love 
his children because he loves them, 
even all the children of men. They 
are my brothers; they are your 
brothers ; they are his children. 
God help us to appreciate that great 
fact and to live by every word thai 
proceedeth forth from the mouth 
of God, through Jesus Christ our 
Lord. Amen.

"O Lord, Remember Me." 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT. 

I have in my hand a little book entitled Abraham Lincoln's Don'ts. I 
wish to read just two or three selections : 

SAYINGS FROM PRESIDENT LINCOLN. 

"I feel that I cannot succeed without the Divine blessing, and on the 
Almighty Being I place my reliance for support." 

"Two principles have stood face to face from the beginning of time and 
will ever continue to struggle. The one is the common right of humanity: 
the other is the divine right of kings." 

The common right of humanity has come very near achieving a com- 
plete and perfect triumph in the great war that is now closed. 

"Teach men that what they cannot take by an election they cannot take 
by war." 

"Take all the Bible upon reason that you can, and the balance on faith, 
and you will live and die a better man." 

"Never send a wrathful letter — burn it, and write another." 

WORK FOR A SUNDAY LAW AT THE NEXT LEGISLATURE. 

I wish that I could impress this sentiment which I am about to read, 
upon the heart of every Latter-day Saint who shall hear it : 

"Let reverence for the laws be breathed by every American mother to the 
lisping babe that prattles%n her lap; let it be taught in schools, in seminaries 
and colleges; let it be written in primers, spelling books and almanacs; let it be 
preached from the pulpit, proclaimed in legislative halls, and enforced in courts 
of justice. And, in short, let it become the political religion of the nafion; and 
let the old and the young, the rich and the poor, the grave and gay of all sexes 
and tongues and colors and conditions sacrifice unceasingly upon its altars." 

And remember that God Almighty has told us to reverence the Sab- 
bath day and to keep it holy. We have tried for years to get a Sunday 
law, but up to date, we have failed. The good representatives from the 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 



139 



outside counties have said : "If you want a Sunday law, you Salt Lake 
people enact it." We cannot get the men in the legislature to give it to us. 
We appeal to the good sisters who have the vote, to try and see that no 
one shall be sent to the legislature from this county or any other county, 
at its next session, who is not in favor of a Sunday law. (Applause.) 

MORE SELECTIONS FROM LINCOLN. 

"What's the matter with my two boys? Just what's the matter with the 
whole world. I've got three walnuts and each wants two." 

"The prudent, penniless beginner in the world labors for wages for a 
while, saves a surplus with which to buy land or tools for himself, then labors 
for himself another while, and at length hires another new beginner, to help 
him. This is the just and generous and prosperous system which opens the 
way to all, gives hope to all, and consequent energy and progress and improve- 
ment of condition to all." 

I wish to the Lord that this could be burned into the very heart of 
the I. W. W. 

ANONYMOUS LETTERS. 

I have received a lot of anonymous letters, since I became President of 
the Church, telling me a great many things that people would like me to an- 
nounce here, positions they would like me to take, etc., to all of which I 
shall pay no attention. Any person who wishes to write me a letter and 
give me pointers should not be afraid to sign his name. 

KIND WORDS FOR THE GERMANS. 

I did, however, receive one letter from a good sister who signed her 
name, asking me to say some kind words, if I could do so, regarding the 
German people. She said it was generally understood, among many of 
the German Latter-day Saints, that I had hatred in my heart for the Ger- 
man people. I suppose that came from the fact that a year ago last April 
I spoke of infamous German conceptions, and paid my respects to the 
Kaiser, with all the force and ability with which God has endowed me. I 
quoted from that same inspired poet, Goethe, to whom Brother Nibley has 
referred here today. I did not quote from Goethe's very wonderful play 
"Faust," but from a simple little poem of four verses which I will read 
again: 

"There are three lessons I would write, 

Three words as with a burning pen, 
In tracings of eternal light 

Upon the hearts of men. 

Have faith, though clouds environ round 

And gladness hides her face in scorn, 
Put off the darkness from thy brow; 

No night but hath its morn. 

Have hope, where'er thy bark is driven, 

The calm distorts the tempest's mirth. 
Know this, God rules the Hosts of Heaven, 

The inhabitants of earth." 



140 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



I said last year, that I hoped Kaiser William will live to have these 
words burned into" his very brain. I guess he has learned that lesson, by 
this time, over in Holland : "Know this, God rules the Hosts of Heaven, 
the inhabitants of earth." I hope he has learned that simple truth. But 
there was a time when he thought he had so much power that he was 
going to rule the earth. Goethe closes his poem with this supreme decla- 
ration of love — a declaration in keeping with the teachings of our Lord 
and Master, Jesus Christ. 



Every German who believes in these inspired teachings of Goethe has 
my love and confidence, but the Germans who believe in force, and who 
sustained the Kaiser, do not have my love and my support. My remarks 
were concluded in such a way that I am astonished any good German 
would imagine I had any ill will toward the German people. I will read 
what I said a year ago last April : 

"In my anxiety to get through with as many items as possible in twenty- 
five minutes I came near neglecting to say one thing which I desire to say:" 

Those of you who were here will remember that I sat down and after- 
wards asked permission, of President Smith, to add a few remarks, and 
this is what I said : 

"I have never traveled with a man who impressed me more as loving 
■God, and more determined to give to this work of our- Redeemer his life's 
labor, than did the late Karl G. Maeser. I believe that the men and women 
whom the gospel found in Germany, and who in all honor embraced it, are as 
loyal, as true, and as patriotic as any other people who have joined the Church 
of Christ. The night following my call for a mission to Japan I lay awake 
until after three o'clock in the morning, and in thinking of those who were 
aged, and whom I hoped and prayed might live until I returned, I thought 
of my own dear mother, of John R. Winder, of George Romney, of Karl G. 
Maeser, and of others whom- I loved with all my heart. I feel that the Ger- 
mans who have embraced the Truth and who have the love of God and the 
love of our Redeemer in their hearts are as willing to go forth to battle 
against wrong and error as the people of any other nation who have em- 
braced the gospel of Jesus Christ. 

"May the Lord help us who know the Truth to go on proclaiming it, 
and bringing people to a knowledge of the Redeemer, and teaching them to 
love their fellow men instead of robbing and killing them, is my prayer and 
desire, and I ask it in the name of Jesus. Amen." 

Now that is exactly how I felt a little over a year ago, and I have not 
changed my opinion. God bless tlje German Latter-day Saints. I love 
them. I love the honest, the world over. I expect a bountiful harvest of 
souls in Germany. I believe that there are millions of people in Germany 
who have never sustained, in their hearts, the course that was taken by the 
ruling classes ; but it would have been as much as their lives were worth 
for them to have dared to assert themselves in opposition to the men who 
were in power. I hope the time is near at hand when liberty will prevail, 
when there will be peace, as far as we can get.it — and efforts to that end 



"Have love — not love alone for one, 
But man as man thy brother call, 

And scatter as a circling sun 
Thy charities on all." 




PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 



141 



will be put forth by a League of Nations, and the people will strive to the 
best of their ability to bring about that condition. When that time comes, 
I expect a reign of liberty in Germany, and there will be a great harvest of 
souls in that land. 

FATHER AND SON— TRAINING CHILDREN. 

When Brother E. Wesley Smith was speaking here this morning about 
the necessity of parents being one with their children, giving them proper 
teachings and knowing where they are, holding up to us the example of 
his father, I thought of two splendid poems in a little book entitled A 
Heap o' Livin'. As they contain some excellent thoughts on father and 
son, I decided to read them to you today. 

ANSWERING HIM. 

"When shall I be a man?" he said, 
As' I was putting him to bed. 
"How many years will have to be 
Before Time makes a man of me? 
And will I be a man when I 
Am grown up big?" I heaved a sigh, 
Because it called for careful thought 
To give the answer that he sought. 

And so I sat him on my knee, 
And said to him: "A man you'll be 
When you have learned that honor brings 
More joy than all the crowns of kings; 
That it is better to be true 
To all who know and trust in you 
Than all the gold of earth to gain, 
If winning it shall leave a stain. 

"When you can fight for victory sweet, 
Yet bravely swallow down defeat, 
And cling to hope and keep the right, 
Nor use deceit instead of might; 
When you are kind and brave and clean, 
And fair to all and never mean; 
When there is good in all you plan, 
That day, my boy, you'll be a man. 

"Some of us learn this truth too late; 
That years alone can't make us great; 
That many who are three-score ten 
Have fallen short of being men, 
Because in selfishness they fought 
And toiled without refining thought; 
And whether wrong or whether right 
They lived but for their own delight. 

"When you have learned that you must hold 

Your honor dearer far than gold; 

That no ill-gotten wealth or fame 

Can pay you for your tarnished name; 

And when in all you say or do 

Of others you're considerate, too, . 

Content to do the best you can 

By such a creed, you'll be a man."

FATHER AND SON. 

Be more than his dad, 

Be a chum to the lad; 

Be a part of his life 

Every hour of the day; 

Find time to talk with him, 

Take time to walk with him, 

Share in his studies 

And share in his play; 

Take him to places, 

To ball games and races, 

Teach him the things 

That you want him to know; 

Don't live apart from him, 

Don't keep your heart from him, 

Be his best comrade, 

He's needing you so! 

Never neglect him, 

Though young, still respect him, 

Hear his opinions 

With patience and pride; 

Show him his error, 

But be not a terror, 

Grim-visaged and fearful, 

When he's at your side. 

Know what his thoughts are, 

Know what his sports are, 

Know all his playmates, 

It's easy to learn to; 

Be such a father 

That when troubles gather 

You'll be the first one 

For counsel, he'll turn to. / 

You can inspire him 

With courage and fire him 

Hot with ambition 

For deeds that are good; 

He'll not betray you 

Nor illy repay you 

If you have taught him 

The things that you should. 

Father and son 

Must in all things be one — 

Partners in trouble 

And comrades in joy. 

More than a dad 

Was the best pal you had; 

Be such a chum 

As you knew, to your boy.

MISCONSTRUCTION AND MISAPPLICATION OF PUBLIC UTTERANCES. 

Some years ago I preached a sermon in this Tabernacle. At the 
close of the service, on my way home, between here and the Eagle Gate, 
six or seven men complimented me for "spanking in public" Brother 
Abraham H. Cannon who had spoken just before I did. Two or three

days later some seven or eight men were in the President's office, and I 
was summoned before them and taken to task for "spanking" Brother 
Cannon. They were very angry. They were all Republicans, and all 
those who had complimented me were Democrats. Brother Abraham and 
I were there at this meeting, and I asked him if he knew that he was 
spanked. He said, no, he did not ; and I remarked, "If I spanked you in 
public, I must have done it in my sleep. I quite frequently sleep when 
other people are talking ; but, up to date, I have not learned to sleep while 
/ am talking. I am not aware of saying one single, solitary word that 
reflected on what you said." 

I requested that those two sermons be published in the Deseret News, 
one following the other; that neither Abraham nor I be permitted to read 
them before publication. When they were published I was to appear at 
the President's office and I would make any apology that was necessary 
for spanking Brother Abraham in public. Brother Cannon and I read 
them to ourselves and then read them aloud, and we could not find one 
single, solitary word wherein I had found any fault with what he had 
said, neither could the Presidency. So I did not have to apologize. Do 
you know, it is a very easy matter for us to misconstrue what people say, 
and make such an application that it may appear partisan or as if it- 
were intended for personal advantage, in some way, shape or manner. 

ENDORSEMENT OF THE SPEECHES OF THIS CONFERENCE. 

I believe, as I believe the gospel, that all the speakers in this confer- 
ence have spoken the honest sentiments of their hearts. I feel sure that 
the same may be said of those who spoke in the Assembly Hall and in the 
other overflow meetings, although I did not hear their remarks. I am 
confident all that has been said was intended for your good and my good, 
and for the advancement of God's kingdom here on earth. I endorse all 
that has been said here, by every speaker. I thank every man to whom 
I have listened, for the inspiration of the Spirit of the Lord that has come 
to him. I thank the Saints from the bottom of my heart for their vote of 
confidence. 

A PLEDGE AND DECLARATION. 

I can pledge to you the best that is in me to fulfil ,the high and holy 
calling that has come to me, to exercise in righteousness the power of the 
Priesthood of the living God, which centers in me, and to administer my 
office as the Trustee-in-Trust, holding your property, to expend it and use 
it to the very best of the ability with which God shall endow me. I expect 
to counsel with my counselors, with the Twelve Apostles and with the 
Presiding Bishopric of the Church — the men to whom the Lord refers in 
the revelation given to the Prophet Joseph Smith, naming the men who 
are to expend the funds of this Church ; although I realize and know that 
legally and technically. I have the right to handle your funds personally, 
because of your vote, just as my predecessors have had that right. Yet 
I know that in a multitude of counsel there is safety, and I expect to have 
that multitude of counsel. 

Again I pray God to bless all Israel, and to bless all men and all

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



women, the world over, who are honest in heart, who are prayerful, who 
are virtuous and who desire to do good. I pray God to have mercy on the 
sinners and to inspire them to repent. God bless you all, I ask it in the 
name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The choir and congregation sang : "Up, awake, ye defenders of 
Zion." 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

In announcing the hymn President Grant said: President Charles 
W. Penrose wrote this hymn at the time Johnston's army was coming to 
Utah to destroy the "Mormons." Apparently the army did not make a 
very good job 'of it, because we are here. This hymn, by President 
Penrose, was sung in many places in England, creating considerable enthu- 
siasm. In the London conference alone over $3,000 were raised to pay the 
return fares of elders who were in England; that they might return to 
Zion and be among those who were to be "destroyed." 



The benediction was pronounced 
by Elder Seymour B. Young, 
senior president of the Council of 
Seventy. 

Conference adjourned until 
October, 1919. 



Professor Anthony C. Lund 
conducted the singing in the Taber- 
nacle. Professor John J. McClel- 
lan played the accompaniments, 
interludes, etc., on the organ as- 



sisted by Edward P. Kimball, and 
Tracy Y. Cannon. 

The stenographic reports of the 
discourses were taken in the 
Tabernacle by Elder Franklin W. 
Otterstrom, assisted by Clyde Ras- 
mussen ; and in the Assembly Hall 
and at the Bureau of Information, 
by Elder Frederick E. Barker, and 
Fred G. Barker. k

Clerk of Conference.

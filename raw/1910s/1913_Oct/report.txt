O ye mountains high, where the clear

Arches over the vales of the free, 
Where the pure breezes blow and the 
clear streamlets flow, ' 
How I've longed to your bosom to 
flee. 

PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 

OPENING ADDRESS. 

The Gospel unchanged from beginning 
of creation — Much time wasted on 
trivial things — Users of tobacco and 
intoxicants scathingly reprimanded— 
God's words, "not good for man," 
should suffice — Vigorous protest 
against infamous fashions in dress — 
Glorious magnitude of Christ's mis- 
sion — Truths revealed in greater ful- 
ness to this generation. 

I sincerely hope that the true 
Spirit of our Lord may dwell boun- 
teously with us during this session

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



of our eighty-fourth semi-annual 
conference. I feel very grateful for 
the privilege I enjoy of being pres- 
ent with you this morning, in pos- 
session of a reasonable degree of 
health and vigor of body and mind. 
For every blessing bestowed upon 
me, for every privilege I enjoy, I 
feel deeply indebted to the Great 
Giver of every good and perfect 
gift. I hope that while I stand be- 
fore you, the Spirit of the Lord may 
prompt me to give expression to 
such thoughts as shall be suited to 
the occasion. I feel this morning as 
I have felt almost all my life, but 
I feel it stronger this morning, per- 
haps, than ever before, that there is 
nothing under the heavens of so 
much importance to me or to the 
children of men as the great plan of 
life and salvation, which was de- 
vised in the heavens in the begin- 
ning, and which has been handed 
down from period to period through 
the inspiration of holy men called 
of God until the day of the coming 
of the Son of man, for this Gospel 
and this plan of salvation was re- 
vealed to our first parents. The an- 
gel of God carried to them the plan 
of redemption, and of salvation 
from death and sin that has been 
revealed from time to time by divine 
authority to the children of men, 
and it has undergone no change. 
There was nothing in it, in the be- 
ginning, that was superfluous or un- 
necessary ; nothing in it that could 
be dispensed with ; it was a complete 
plan devised in the beginning by 
the wisdom of the Father and the 
holy ones for the redemption of the 
human race and for their salvation 
and exaltation in the presence of 
God. It was taught more fully, and 
exemplified more perfectly in the 
being, life and mission, instruction 
and doctrine, given by the Son of 



God, than ever before, unless there 
may be an exception in the days of 
Enoch; but through all the genera- 
tions of time, the same Gospel, the 
same plan of life and salvation, the 
same ordinances, burial with Christ, 
remembrance of the great sacrifice 
to be offered for the sins of the 
world and for man's redemption, 
has been handed down from time 
to time from the time of the crea- 
tion. This is not simply my opin- 
ion, I am but uttering the truths 
contained in the revelations of God 
to inspired men in the various ages 
in which he has spoken to the world. 
And in this dispensation, of the lat- 
ter days, this same Gospel, this same 
plan of life and salvation has been 
renewed, or revealed anew, unto 
men, and fully restored with all its 
gifts, powers and graces, rights and 
privileges, necessary for the prep- 
eration of mankind to live as God 
requires them to live in this world, 
and to prepare themselves for an 
inheritance of glory, exaltation, do- 
minion and power in the world to 
come. 

My earnest desire is, and has been 
from my youth up, and it is grow- 
ing stronger and stronger as the 
years accumulate to me, to bear my 
testimony, and to declare to men, 
as far as it lies in my power, that 
God has given to us the truth, His 
truth, for His word is truth; Jesus 
Himself so declared it. He said: 
"My word is truth," and wherever 
we can find the word of God, or 
reach out and comprehend His law 
which is His word, for His word 
is His law, and His law is the word 
of God to all men, — wherever we 
can find it, and can comprehend and 
embrace" it, we comprehend and em- 
brace the truth. The trouble seems 
to lie with mankind as to their abil- 
ity to grasp the truth, and as to the 



PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH.

■earnestness of their souls to ,desire 
the truth and to seek after it with 
all their hearts, that they may put 
the seeking of it before the seeking 
after those things which perish. 
Think of it, how many hours, how 
many days and months we spend, 
as the children of God, in the pur- 
suit of the temporalities of life, 
in devoting our thoughts to those 
things which pertain to the present 
temporal life or existence, not the 
spiritual existence, or that portion 
or particular part of the temporal 
existence which pertains to, and is a 
part of, the spiritual existence of 
man. Men and women talk, they 
use their tongues and their lips very 
much in conversation and in the ex- 
pressions of their views and 
thoughts which pertain only to 
worldly things, to trivial matters, of 
no value, to the groveling things, 
so to speak, of the world, and de- 
vote very few moments to useful 
and uplifting thought and very few 
words comparatively, are spoken by 
them which pertain to the eternal, 
everlasting growth, development 
and happiness of mankind. We 
think of the world, of the present, 
we think more about the farm, the 
bank, the merchandizing, about our 
flocks and our herds, more in regard 
to the temporalities of life, than we 
think about the principles of eternal 
turth that make for the salvation, 
happiness and well-being, tempor- 
ally and spiritually, of our souls. 

My feeling, my earnest desire 
for good, is stronger than ever. It 
grows with age. I see more 
clearly today than ever before, the 
end of my mission in the world, that 
my time is growing shorter. I re- 
flect upon the past, and often won- 
der how much of the valuable time 
the Lord has allotted to me in this 
"life, have I wasted in folly and use- 



less things ; and . how much of it 
have I employed in that which was 
essential to my salvation, to my 
growth and development in the 
knowledge of God and in the under- 
standing of His truth? I assure 
you that while it is true that, for the 
most part of my life, I have been 
engaged in chis ministry, in the 
work of the Lord, to the best of my 
understanding, and the ability that 
the Lord has given me, when I 
look back upon my life I can see 
much wasted time, many unim- 
proved moments, numerous things 
that I have engaged in that were 
comparatively, at least, unnecessary 
and hurtful rather than beneficial, 
and yet nothing that was seriously 
wrong. 

There are many things today in- 
dulged in by mankind, and by too 
many of those who have professed 
belief in the divine mission of The 
Christ and of His servant Joseph 
Smith, that are not only contrary 
to the word of the Lord, and in op- 
position to the Spirit of the Gospel 
of Jesus Christ, but are both in op- 
position to the Spirit of the Lord 
and in opposition to the life and 
health and purity of the souls of 
men. Some of these evils seem to 
be growing amongst us. Go where 
I will or where I do — and I am 
going from week to week and from 
month, to month, here and there, 
in the discharge of my duty— 1 
see evidences of great disrespect .to . 
the requirements of the Gospel of 
Jesus Christ, and I not only see it 
among the adult citizens of the 
kingdom, and members of the 
Church, but I see the bad effects 
of the example that these adult 
members of the Church are having 
upon the youth of Zion. 

It is neither my wish nor pur- 
pose to advertise the weaknesses 



4 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



and imperfections of those who 
should be Latter-day Saints, and 
whose lives should be absolutely 
above reproach ; it is not my wish 
nor desire to magnify the weakness- 
es and the imperfections of men ; but 
I see things, day after day, which I 
think should be corrected, as far as> 
it is possible for them to be cor- 
rected. Let me, without doing it in 
the spirit of accusation, without 
charging evil upon the people, speak 
of some of the things I see, to some 
extent. I thank the Lord that the 
evil is no more extensive than it is ; 
I am very grateful that it is con- 
fined within the limits to which it is 
confined. 

There is a revelation in the Doc- 
trine and Covenants of the Church, 
a simple statement of the will of the 
Lord; it is called the Word of Wis- 
dom. We haven't preached about 
it very much of late, it has been left 
to itself, so far as I have heard. We 
have been preaching faith, repent- 
ance, and baptism for the remission 
of sins ; we have been preaching the 
necessity of looking up the geneal- 
ogy of the people called Latter-day 
Saints, looking after their ances- 
tors, gathering the names of their 
progenitors and of their kindred, 
and the associates and friends of 
their kindred, in order that they 
might administer in the ordinances 
of the house of God in their be- 
half, according to the scriptures of 
■divine truth, that they may have 
the privilege of living according to 
God in the spirit and be judged 
according to men in the flesh. We 
have been preaching honor, upright- 
ness, virtue and devotion to right, 
but we have not specifically named 
this simple law of God given to us 
for the purity of our own lives, that 
we might be free from the contam- 
inations that the partaking of those 



things "which are not good for 
man" will entail upon us. I see 
those in our midst, I don't know 
that they are Latter-day Saints, I 
don't know that they are the chil- 
dren of Latter-day Saints, but I see 
in our midst those who indulge in 
the foolish, injurious, uncleanly 
practice, of smoking tobacco, smok- 
ing cigarettes, or cigars, or the old 
pipe, so strong and unsavory, that, 
they become noxious to the nostrils 
of men not addicted to the use of it. 
I see it apparently increasing 
amongst us. I see a young man 
with a cigar in his mouth — a habit 
that has become so common that: 
today you can't go into a hotel din- 
ing room, and sit down to partake 
of a meal, even in a first-class hotel, 
or in any hotel, dining room or res- 
taurant among the people of our 
times, without being nauseated 
while eating your meal with the vile 
perfume of tobacco. Many men 
have adopted the habit of using 
these things at their meals until it 
has become common. The fact 
seems to be that the man who does 
not do it is the exception. Now 
this does not apply to Latter-day 
Saints at all, and to those called 
"Mormons," only to a very limited 
extent, for I hold that Latter-day 
Saints have more regard for them- 
selves and have more respect tor 
the wishes of others, and especially 
more respect for womankind than 
to go into a dining room and there 
befoul the air to be breathed by the 
gentler sex by the nauseous use 
of tobacco, and by the fetid breath 
of those who are in the habit of 
using it. I would rather smell iodo- 
form than the breath of a man that 
smokes tobacco, and I think iodo- 
form is one of the worst things that 
I ever did smell. 

President George Q. Cannon-

often said to me and to others that 
he would rather be shut up with a 
skunk than be shut up in a smoking 
car with smokers. What right has 
a man to befoul with his nauseous 
breath the air that I breathe ? What 
right have I to make noxious the 
air that you breathe? I have no 
right to do it, and you have a right 
to protest against my doing it, and 
to show those who are in the habit 
of doing these things your con- 
tempt for their practices, if you 
have any respect for them. You 
should show at least your contempt 
for that which they do foolishly, 
for their practice is wrong, perni- 
cious and they are unmindful of the 
rights of others. I have thought 
seriously that a boy or man who 
has become addicted to the use of 
tobacco in any form, to the extent 
that he is unable to resist his ap- 
petite for it, or who has practiced 
it until he is unable to resist or 
overcome it, is a man who is so 
mentally weakened, so morally de- 
graded that he is not competent to 
perform, and would not be worthy 
to be entrusted with, any responsible 
duty. Why? because a man who has 
become so weak-minded and irreso- 
lute that he cannot overcome the 
temptation to do wrong or resist the 
power of an acquired, vicious ap- 
petite for poison, how can he be 
trusted? It is a weakness, a degra- 
dation that sinks far below the or- 
dinarv weaknesses of mankind, and 
therefore, the person who is so en- 
slaved to vitiated appetites for pois- 
onous, hurtful things that he can- 
not overcome them, being a slave 
to a pernicious habit, a degrading 
practice — that he cannot rise above 
it, how dare you trust him? How 
can you entrust to one whose mind 
has become so weakened, so vitiated 
and so degraded, that he is not his 



own master, but an irresolute slave 
to unholy passion, any trust that 
requires honor, strength of man- 
hood, determination, and will-power 
to resist evil and temptation to do 
wrong? You can't do it. You can't 
trust a man who has not the power 
of will to say "no" to temptation, 
to do evil or to that which entices 
to evil; he is only worthy of con- 
demnation, and you cannot safely 
trust him, and you ought not to 
trust him. 

The same can truly be said of the 
man who is in the habit of using in- 
toxicating liquors ; the same prin- 
ciple and argument apply perhaps 
more thoroughly to one who is 
given to drunkenness than to one 
who is only given to' the use of 
tobacco, and yet, in perhaps ninety- 
nine cases out of the hundred, the 
man who is in the habit of using 
tobacco will also be found using in- 
toxicating drinks, thus adding to his 
weakness, his instability, proof upon 
proof of his unworthiness to be en- 
trusted with anything of import- 
ance. Oh, my brethren and sis- 
ters, will you, if possible prevent to 
it, permit your sons to indulge in 
these infamous practices which the 
Lord says are not good for them ? 
Which He says are injurious to 
them. Tobacco was not intended 
for such use ; it 5s intended for 
bruises and sick cattle, but not for 
the stomach, not for the appetite 
of man, and we ought not to use it. 

Then you may go from these 
practices to lesser evils, perhaps, 
and yet not always very much less 
because some people have become 
so addicted to the use of cof- 
fee that they do not have the powfcr 
to resist its temptation. If it were 
set before them they could not say. 
"No thank you, I don't want it." 
But if they were asked, "Will you 



6 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



take coffee, or will you have tea?" 
they will say: "Well, yes, please." 
Why ? Because they are in the habit 
of it, and they can't say "No." I 
have noticed this in the society of 
so-called "good Latter-day Saints." 

Not long ago, in the line of duty, 
we visited more than one good 
family, and when we sat down to 
their generous tables they said: 
"Now, what will you have to 
drink?" 

"Why, I take water to drink." 

"Well, won't you have anything 
else to drink?" 

"No, I thank you, water is my 
beverage, I drink water." 

"Well, but the water is not very 
good, there has been rain and it is 
riley, will you have a little some- 
thing else to drink?" 

"No, water will do." 

"Well, we haven't got so far 
along that we can do on water, we 
still have to have our coffee." 

And so they drank their coffee, 
while we took water and enjoyed it; 
and while the water did not alto- 
gether agree with my taste. I be- 
lieve I stood it as well as some who 
drank their coffee. 

I hope my good brethren are here 
to hear me, for I would like them to 
know just how I feel and think 
about it. I would like to say it 
broadly enough so that everybody 
can hear it : the Lord says these 
things are not good, the law of God 
says they are not necessary, that 
they are harmful. The law of na- 
ture tells you they are not good 
because they are poisonous — mild 
poison perhaps, but poisonous. T re- 
member very distinctly, on one oc- 
casion, a good brother who took 
too much morphine as medicine. 
The doctor was sent for, he said, 
"have you some coffee?" "Yes." 
"Go and make some coffee, as 



strong as you can." And they be- 
gan to administer strong coffee to 
the man under the influence of mor- 
phine. What for? Why they say 
that "like cures like" and it took an- 
other kind of poison to counteract 
the poison that was in his system. 

I deplore the evidence that I see, 
wherever I see it, of disrespect or 
indifference to the things that the 
Lord has said are not good for 
man. I would that all Latter-day 
Saints especially, and that all man- 
kind in general, would be willing to 
learn what God has said is good for 
man, and then, having learned it, 
would be obedient to the word of the 
Lord and keep His law^I wish we 
could. It is my duty to teach this 
principle, to advocate this doctrine, 
to implore the brethren and sisters 
to obey the law of God, and thereby 
receive His blessing, and the fulfil- 
ment of the promise that He has 
made to the children of men, 
namely : 

"That all Saints who remember to 
keep and do these sayings, walking 
in obedience to the commandments, 
shall receive health in their navel, 
and marrow in their bones, and shall 
find wisdom and great treasures of 
knowledge, even hidden treasures; and 
shall run and not be weary, and shall 
walk and not faint: and I, the Lord, 
give unto them a promise, that the 
destroying angel shall pass by them, 
as the children of Israel, and not slay 
them." (Doc. and Cov. 89:18-21.) 

Another thing, how could an 
elder in the Church of Jesus Christ 
go where there are afflicted ones to 
anoint them with holy oil, to lay 
hands upon them and prav for them 
that "the prayer of faith might save 
the sick and the Lord raise them 
up," when he knows that he is con- 
taminated with the use of things 
that God has said are not good for 
him? When he knows that he is

not in harmony with the will of the 
Lord, nor with His law? It is the 
fervent prayer of a righteous man 
that availeth and is effectual, not 
the prayer of the impure and un- 
righteous ; he could not do it, as 
Christ did it, for He was without 
sin, and in harmony with God's pur- 
poses always. When He spoke it 
was as one pure as God Himself. 
Why should He not have power to 
give hearing to the deaf and sight 
to the blind? Why should He not 
have power to cleanse the leper and 
to jaise the dead? since there was 
no sin in Him and He was in per- 
fect harmony and unison with God, 
with the laws of life and health and 
godliness Why should He not 
have power? But you say, "He 
was the Son of God." So are you 
the sons of God, and the daughters 
of God. Why should we not emu- 
late the example and life of Him 
who was sinless, and in perfect ac- 
cord with His Father? He declared 
throughout His mission : "I came, 
not to do my own will, but the will 
of Him that sent me." Why should 
we not feel that way? We did not 
come here to do our own will, but. 
as He did. to do the will of Him 
that sent us here, that we might 
learn of His ways and walk in His 
paths and be indeed His children. 
We have been buried with Him in 
the waters of baptism and we have 
been born of the Spirit of God. 
Therefore, we should be able to see 
the truth, to discern between right 
and wrong, between good and evil, 
and between light and darkness ; it 
is our privilege to know and love 
that which is good as against that 
which is evil, by the gifts of the 
Spirit bestowed upon us. Then why 
should we not keep the command- 
ments of the Lord. If we do not, is 
it not because we think onlv once in 



a while of God and of godliness, 
and all the rest of the time we think 
of the world and of worldliness? 
We give our hopes, our time, our 
talent, our thoughts, our words, our 
actions, to the temporalities of life, 
and, once in a while, we think of 
God. We come before Him in that 
pitiful form of unworthiness to 
crave His blessings and His favors. 
Do you wonder that we are often 
denied that which we ask for, and 
fail to receive that which we desire ? 
It is because we do not ask aright. 
When we approach God in this way, 
we are not in a condition to ask 
aright, nor are we in a condition to 
receive that which we ask for, for 
God is not likely to bestow upon his 
children gifts and blessings of 
which they are not worthy, 

I do not want to be burdensome 
to this vast congregation by talking 
too long but I have another thought 
that weighs upon my mind, and this 
is not in relation to the men, but it 
is with respect to the women, and 
more particularly with regard to the 
manner in which they dress. Never, 
perhaps, at least within the period 
of my life — and I have lived in the 
world nearly seventy-five years — 
never, I say, within the period of 
my life and experience have I seen 
such obscene, uncleanly, impure, 
and suggestive fashions of women's 
dress as I see today. Some of them 
are abominable. I lift my voice 
against these audacious practices 
and these infamous fashions, and I 
pray that you who have daughters 
in Zion will save them, if you can, 
from following these obscene fash- 
ions, that if followed, will destroy- 
the last vestige of true womanly- 
modesty, and reduce them to the 
level of the courtesans on the streets; 
of Paris, from whence these debas- 
ing fashions come. They are the 



8 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



lowest and most degraded speci- 
mens of womankind, who have 
yielded their bodies to crime and 
their souls to death, if not to perdi- 
tion, and are devoid of modesty and 
the sense of shame. We cannot 
afford to let our women follow such 
as these or to adopt the cursed fash- 
ions they set. 

I need not dwell on this matter, 
but will say that while crossing the 
street the other day, I saw a woman 
dressed to the height of this ridic- 
ulous fashion, and she was trotting 
along with little, short steps, she 
couldn't go any other way, hurry- 
ing across the street to catch the 
car. She got hold of the rail of the 
car and tried to lift herself up, but 
her foot would not go up to the 
step. By this time there was a 
crowd of men looking on. All of a 
sudden she stooped clown, caught 
the bottom of her dress and raised 
it high enough to climb up. What 
an exhibition that was to the public 
eye! Would you like your daugh- 
ters to expose themselves in such 
a, manner? To do so they must of 
necessity part with their sense of 
womanly modesty, if not with all 
other womanly virtues. God have 
mercy on our girls, and help them 
to dress decently ! 

I suppose I shall incur the cen- 
sure and displeasure of many in 
saying these things, but I do not 
care what the world has to say, 
what men say, nor what women say, 
in relation to these things. In my 
sight the present day fashions are 
abominable, suggestive of evil, cal- 
culated to arouse base passion and 
lust, and to engender lasciviousness, 
in the hearts of those who follow 
the fashions, and of those who tol- 
erate them. Why? Because women 
are imitating the very customs of a 
class of women who have resorted 



to that means to aid them to sell 
their souls. It is infamous, and I 
hope the daughters of Zion will 
not descend to these pernicious 
ways, customs and fashions, for 
they are demoralizing and damna- 
ble in their effect. 

Now, the Lord bless you. I could 
say a good deal more, perhaps, if 
it were prudent or wise. I do not 
know but what I have said too 
much already, but I believe what I 
say. I am converted to the Gospel 
of Christ ; I believe in Jesus with all 
my soul. I cannot doubt the evi- 
dences of more than sixty years of 
my experience in the Church in 
preaching the Gospel. Everything 
has contributed to the confirmation 
of my faith in the divine mission of 
the prophet Joseph Smith, and in 
the glorious plan of life and salva- 
tion taught by the Son of God, both 
for the living and for the dead. I 
cannot disbelieve such things' as 
these, they appeal to my judgment ; 
they take my poor, helpless soul, 
my helpless mortal being, destined 
to pass through the grave, out of 
this mortal life, and above and be- 
yond it, and there is no other hope 
or assurance on earth, that I have 
ever found, for a future reward or 
happiness or the enjoyment of the 
fulness of the hopes and aspirations 
of my soul, except those which are 
held out to me in the Gospel of 
Jesus Christ, who came into the 
world with power to lay down His 
life and take it up again, the only 
Being sent from God to earth who 
possessed the power to lay down 
His life and take it up again. To 
no other soul under heaven has this 
power been given, and He demon- 
strated the resurrection from death 
to life by His own example, and has 
freely offered the same deliverance 
to all the . sons and daughters of God

that ever lived on earth or that will 
ever live from henceforth. 

Christ has opened up to the 
world, through faith and obedience, 
this hope of everlasting life and ex- 
altation in His glorious kingdom. 
Who else has taught such doctrines 
as this? Who else has exemplified 
this power and has done the deed? 
or given this object lesson before 
the world? Not one! Shall we 
deny it? Then look at the testi- 
mony of His disciples; they say 
they heard with their ears, they 
witnessed what they have declared 
to the world, and their testimony 
stands unimpeached to this day, 
and, in addition to this, we have the 
testimony of Joseph the Prophet. 
I say in addition to the testimony 
of Jesus Himself that He came 
from the Father, that He was his 
Father's Son, begotten of His 
Father, born of His mother Mary, 
thus partaking of the elements of 
eternal life and power over death, 
inheriting this power from His 
Father ; and possessing the power 
to lay down His life through the 
mortality inherited from His moth- 
er. He says, "No man taketh it from 
me. I have power to lay it down 
and I have power to take it up 
again." Joseph the Prophet comes 
to us in this dispensation and de- 
clares that the heavens were opened 
to him and to his associates, and he 
saw and heard, and he declares as 
the . last witness, who has seen and 
heard and knows, that Jesus is the 
Christ and the Redeemer of the 
world, even He who was born of 
Mary, crucified and rose again from 
the dead, and visited the inhabitants 
of this continent, as well as the in- 
habitants of the old continent as we 
call it, who also bear witness of 
Him. 

T believe in these things, I believe 



in Joseph Smith the Prophet, I be- 
lieve in the doctrine contained in the 
Book of Mormon, as T do that con- 
tained in the New Testament. I 
believe in the revelations that have 
come to the Prophet Joseph Smith ; 
and I say to my brethren that the 
book of Doctrine and Covenants 
contains some of the most glorious 
principles ever revealed to the 
world, some that have been revealed 
in greater fulness than they were 
ever revealed before to the world; 
and this, in fulfilment of the prom- 
ises of the ancient prophets that in 
the latter times, the Lord would re- 
veal things to the world that had 
been kept hid from the foundation 
thereof ; and the Lord has revealed 
them through the Prophet Joseph 
Smith. 

This great work for the redemp- 
tion of our dead, the uniting to- 
gether of the living and the dead, 
the sealing power that takes the liv- 
ing children and unites them in the 
bond of the new and everlasting 
covenant with their fathers and 
mothers who have gone before 
them ; the great principle that binds 
on earth and it is bound in heaven, 
that takes the woman, chosen by the 
man, and seals her to the husband 
of her choice with an everlasting, 
unbreakable covenant, or a covenant 
that can only be broken by sin or 
by the transgression of the laws of 
God ; a covenant that can never be 
broken by death, by time, or dis- 
tance, because God has confirmed it, 
it is sealed by His power for time 
and for all eternity ; the work of 
baptism and other saving ordin- 
ances for the dead ; the endowments, 
and all the ordinances that have 
been revealed to be performed in 
the sacred edifices called temples, 
which we are under commandment 
from God always to build unto His

holy name, — (Doc. and Cov. p. 434, 
verse 39) these things have been re- 
vealed to us in this dispensation in 
greater fulness and in greater plain- 
ness than ever before in the history 
of the world so far as we know. 

Thank God, for the truth ! May 
we abide in it. May the Lord help 
us to be humble, prayerful and hon- 
est with our own souls, as well as 
honest with our Father and God, 
and make us capable of resisting 
evil and of rejecting wickedness, 
capable of discerning the darkness 
and of turning away from it, that 
we may walk in the light as God is 
in the light, that we may have fel- 
lowship with Him, and that the 
blood of His son Jesus Christ may 
cleanse us from all sin, is my prayer 
in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

PKESIDENT ANTHON H. LUND. 

Blessing attending Conference gath- 
ings — Need for the restored Gospel 
to be preached to professing Chris- 
tians — Our missionaries travel, and 
preach, as approved of the Lord — 
Successful missionary labors among 
"pagan" nations, and elsewhere — 
Temporal and spiritual advancement 
of Saints at home. 

I hope that while I speak a few 
minute's I may be heard by this 
large congregation. I am indeed 
pleased to see the good attend- 
ance this rainy morning. It shows 
that the Latter-day Saints desire to 
come and hear the word of the 
Lord. We have heard it this 
morning from our president, and 
my advice to all is to try to remem- 
ber the precious advice he has 
given unto us. 

Tt is a blessing for the Saints to 
come together in these general con- 
ferences. We have the oppor- 
tunity of renewing old acquaint- 
ances and of being renewed and 



strengthened in the testimony of 
Jesus. The Lord, in commanding 
us to meet regularly in these gen- 
eral conferences and in our quar- 
terly conferences, had the object in 
view of uniting us and making us 
one people ; so that whether we live 
north or south, east or west, we 
may come together and partake of 
the same spirit. Israel of old were 
also commanded to go to a place 
chosen by the Lord, where His 
sanctuary should be built; and 
when Jerusalem became the temple 
city they went there annually to 
offer their sacrifices, and there they 
met people of every tribe of Israel. 
At home they lived in their own 
territories, each tribe by itself ; but 
on the annual occasions when they 
went to Jerusalem, they mixed and 
mingled with one another ; they be- 
came acquainted with one another's 
views, and thus kept the national 
feeling strong in their hearts. When 
Jeroboam rebelled against Reho- 
boam.the unwise son of Solomon, he 
saw the force of this custom among 
the people, and he forbade them to 
•go to Jerusalem, for he knew if they 
went there to worship at the sanc- 
tuary of the Lord and heard the 
truth spoken, and worshiped Him 
in the true manner that He had 
ordained, that their hearts would 
be turned from him who had 
rebelled against legitimate author- 
ity and was trying to lead the 
people astray. To keep the people 
from going to Jerusalem he built 
altars in Bethel and Dan, and 
raised golden calves there. He 
succeeded in making Israel sin, 
although there were mighty 
prophets raised up among that 
part of Israel, who tried to lead 
the people back to the worship of 
Jehovah ; but the people gradually 
sank in wickedness and idolatry.

and were carried away captive 
many years before the same fate 
befell their brethren of Judea. 
Now, I look upon this custom of 
ours, of coming together here in 
our conferences, as a potent means 
for the uniting of the people, mak- 
ing them as one, and strengthening 
their faith by partaking of the 
same spirit, hearing the same doc- 
trines preached, and being encour- 
aged to follow the advice given, 
and to make themselves Latter-day 
Saints indeed. 

We have a great work to per- 
form; the Lord has started this 
work, has revealed Himself in our 
day, and given us the Gospel in its 
purity, and we owe it to our fellow 
men to make known that which has 
been given unto us. To the credit 
of the Latter-day Saints I will say 
that our missionaries go out, year 
after year, willingly and with the 
full determination to perform 
this duty of informing men con- 
cerning what God has done. 

We have been reproached by 
ministers of other religions because 
our elders labor mostly among 
those who have faith in the Bible 
and in Christ. They say, "Why 
don't you labor among the Pagans?" 
We are not yet a very numeous 
people ; we have not the means to 
pay our missionaries as other mis- 
sionary societies have to pay theirs, 
even if it were the better way ; but 
we have found that the better way 
for our elders to labor out in the 
world is to go depending upon the 
Lord and not upon the dollar. 
When they do so, the power of the 
Lord is with them, and they have 
influence for good over men. 
Our elders have been sent mostly to 
the nations that believe in God and 
that Christ is the Redeemer, to 
show them the way that the Lord 



has ordained for the salvation of 
souls. We claim that the Christian 
world had gone astray, that they 
did not keep the principles of the 
Gospel in their original purity, that 
nearly all the men who held the 
apostolic authority formerly be- 
came martyrs and that gradually 
the power of the priesthood was 
taken away from men ; and now we 
bear this testimony that God has 
again restored the priesthood unto 
the earth. We believe that the 
books of the Bible were written by 
inspiration from ■ on high. We 
have conversed with those who say 
they believe in the Bible, and have 
shown them that the doctrines as 
taught by us are consistent with the 
doctrines contained in the Bible. 
When we have preached unto men, 
how often they have said : "Well, 
this is taken from your Bible, but 
that is not contained in ours." We 
have asked them to show us their 
Bible, and then we have proved to 
them that their Bible is the same 
that we believe in. 

I feel thankful that the Gospel as 
given unto us is consistent, all 
through, with the holy scriptures. 
I feel thankful that the Lord has 
kept His hand over His written 
word, that it has come down unto 
us even to this day, in the good 
shape that it has, and this notwith- 
standing its having passed through 
so man)' versions. 

Our elders, however, go not to 
the Christian nations alone, but you 
will find them also among the 
Pagans. Still we have not had as 
many to go there yet, as we will 
have, for this Gospel is unto all 
people. Men will be sent to all 
nations to preach the Gospel, and 
we believe that wherever Israel are 
found they will listen and accept 
the word of the Lord and be gath-

ered out. For I verily believe that the 
words of the prophet Joel will yet 
come to pass, that in Zion and Jeru- 
salem shall be means of escape. He 
saw the future ; he prophesied of it. 
I believe that the Jews, the Israel- 
ites, will be gathered back to their 
home in the Holy Land. There is at 
present a movement of this kind. 
When you compare the statistics of 
the population of Jerusalem now 
with that of a few years ago, you 
can see that the Jews, longing for 
their home land, are rapidly in- 
creasing their numbers in that city, 
and the spirit of gathering is work- 
ing upon them. There is another 
gathering, unto this land, which 
was also prophesied by ancient 
prophets that it would take place, 
and this movement is now in pro- 
gress. The Book of Mormon is 
clear upon it, when it tells us that 
people from all nations shall be 
gathered to this land. We have 
people from every part of the 
world and from a great many 
nations ; and they have come here, 
melting together into one body, be- 
coming members of the same 
church, and aspiring to become 
members of the kingdom of God 
when that shall be established in its 
fullness upon the earth. The 
world sends missionaries out 
among the Pagans. I think they 
do good in bringing the light as 
contained in the Bible unto some of 
those people ; but how few there 
are that receive it. I remember 
when I and some other elders were 
in Syria, and we would meet these 
missionaries in their carriages, rid- 
ing along the road, having nice 
places and servants, and when the 
people heard that we traveled as 
of old, without pay, at our own ex- 
pense, they wondered and said : 
"Well, you can't be missionaries;" 



for they had another idea of what 
missionaries were — men who had 
means to hire things done and so 
on. 

We are working to-day in Japan. 
We have a branch in Hindoostan — 
that is we have Saints there; and 
we have also Saints in Syria, 
among the Mohammedans. This 
work will spread rapidly. 

Our missionaries who are labor- 
ing in Europe, particularly in Eng- 
land and Scandinavia, have found 
considerable opposition, but this 
opposition has not hindered the 
progress of the work, for more 
people are baptized. In some cit- 
ies they will not rent us halls in 
which to hold our meetings, hence 
we have built chapels and meeting 
houses of our own, and though 
they have threatened that we 
should not be able to have them in 
peace, so far we have had them, and 
can invite the people to come and 
worship with us, or hear our elders 
speak. In one city in Norway 
they will not rent us a hall ; we 
have a good many Saints there, 
and many investigators ; our breth- 
ren have found a good hall, and 
we have told them to buy it, so 
that the people can have a place in 
which to worship. 

Our elders go out at their own ex- 
pense. They labor for the love they 
have for their fellow men, and this 
love is rewarded by their gathering 
souls into Christ. 

On the South Sea islands, 
among the Maoris and Samoans, 
we are trying to establish schools 
for the people, in which they can 
be taught not only the common 
branches of education but also the 
doctrines of the Gospel. Among 
the Maoris there has been estab- 
lished a high school, and the peo- 
ple feel to thank the Lord that such 



PRESIDENT ANTHON H. LUND. 



13 



an institution has been established 
among them ; and thus we will be 
able to keep hold of the young men 
and young women who, wanting 
to get a higher education, would 
otherwise have to go and get it 
among the outsiders. They are 
taught there not only the branches 
that we generally think belong to 
education, but also practical things 
such as manual labor, husbandry, 
agriculture, and all of those things 
that will benefit them and help 
them to be men among men. We 
feel thankful for the success this 
school already has had among the 
people there, and I know it will be 
a growing institution and one that 
will be productive of much good 
among that people ; for they seem 
to be a people earnest in their de- 
sire to serve the Lord. 

Looking upon the different mis- 
sions", we feel satisfied with the 
work that has been done during 
the past year. Our elders are 
working zealously for the spread 
of the truth, and we commend 
them for their good labors. We 
are pleased with the labors of 
the presidents of the different mis- 
sions. They are men of God, men 
who are able to inspire our young 
men who before leaving home have 
had very little opportunity of ming- 
ling with men. These experienced 
men who are presidents of missions 
know how to counsel them, how 
to help them, that they may get 
the right hold of the work and be 
able to explain the principles of 
the Gospel unto those with whom 
they come in contact. 

At home, in Zion here, we see 
growth and progress. Our people 
have been very diligent in building 
houses of worship. They are not 
satisfied with the old house or 
building that has served many 



years ; they want to show the Lord 
that His house should be one to in- 
spire admiration also, from an 
architectural side. Not that the 
word of God can not be delivered in 
the old log house just as well as in 
the fine edifices that have been 
erected of late, but when the people 
are able to build better, I think 
they show more reverence for their 
Heavenly Father by building bet- 
ter houses of worship to be dedi- 
cated to his name ; and I must com- 
mend the Saints for their diligence 
in this direction. The church has 
helped as much as possible. The 
Trustee-in-Trust is willing to use 
the means at his command to help 
the Saints in this work; but there 
are so many other calls upon the 
Trustee-in-trust, for the expenses 
in the missions, and the expenses 
of the Church, the poor, and the 
maintenance of the Church schools, 
that he is not able to grant all the 
help the people would like to have 
in this matter. I believe, however, 
that you who are helping your- 
selves and then calling on the Lord 
to help you, feel more satisfied 
than if you were to have all the 
money you needed for these pur- 
poses and do nothing yourselves. 
It is the workers that will succeed ; 
it is the laborer that will be re- 
warded. Our faith must show 
itself in works ; otherwise, it is a 
dead faith. 

Now, brethren and sisters, let us 
take hold; let us do what we can 
for the upbuilding of the kingdom 
of God ; let us listen to the counsel 
given us this morning and obey 
the commandments of the Lord ; 
and even if you say about the Word 
of Wisdom, that it was not given 
as a commandment but as a word 
of counsel, do not feel that that 
gives you any more liberty to go 



14 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



contrary to the advice given. It is 
a revelation from the Lord, and He 
in His goodness has given it unto 
us for our good, knowing as He 
does, what is best, both bodily and 
spiritually. Shall we then follow 
His counsel, and continue to do 
that, or take those things into our 
systems that He has said are injur- 
ious ? I hope that we will be strong 
in our determination to keep the 
Word of Wisdom and to do it not 
only to please our Heavenly Father, 
but because we know that what He 
says to us is for our own good. 
We will not lose any pleasure by it. 
There may be a little self-denial to 
those who have gotten into the 
habit of using things that are for- 
bidden, but even self-denial gives 
joy and pleasure. 

May the Lord bless His Saints ; 
may Zion grow ; may truth spread ; 
may the time hasten when the laws 
of God shall be known and obeyed ; 
I ask it in the name of Jesus. 
Amen. 

PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 

If I may be indulged just a mom- 
ent. The reason undoubtedly why 
the Word of Wisdom was given — 
as not by "commandment or re- 
straint" was that at that time, at 
least, if it had been given as a com- 
mandment it would have brought 
every man, addicted to the use of 
these noxious things, under condem- 
nation; so the Lord was merciful 
and gave them a chance to over- 
come, before He brought them un- 
der the law. Later on, it was an- 
nounced from this stand, by Presi- 
dent Brigham Young, that the 
Word of Wisdom was a revelation 
and a command of the Lord. I de- 
sired to mention that fact, because 
I do not want you to feel that we 



are under no restraint. We do not 
want to come under condemnation. 

The congregation sang the hymn : 

Redeemer of Israel, our only delight, 

On whom for a blessing we call, 
Our shadow by day, and our pillar by 
night, 

Our King, our Deliv'rer, our all! 

Benediction was pronounced by 
Elder Walter P. Monson. 

Conference adjourned until 2 p.m. 



AFTERNOON SESSION. 

Conference was resumed at 2 
p. m., President Joseph F. Smith 
presiding. 

The congregation sang the hymn : 

Guide us, O Thou great Jehovah, 
Lead us to the promised land, 

We are weak, but Thou art able — 
Hold us with Thy powerful hand. 

Prayer was offered by Elder An- 
drew Kimball. 

The congregation sang the hymn : 

The Spirit of God like a fire is burn- 
ing! 

The latter-day glory begins to come 
forth; 

The visions and blessings of old are 
returning, 
And angels are coming to visit the 
earth. 

PREST. CHARLES W. PENROSE.

I consider it a great privilege to

be permitted to be present on this 
grand occasion, to see so many Lat- 
ter-day Saints gathered in this tab- 
ernacle, in spite of the unfavorable 
weather that is not encouraging to 
people traveling or coming together 
in conference. To me it shows 
great interest on the part of the 
people, to assemble in such num- 
bers as we have seen them here to- 
day, particularly this morning, to 
listen to the voice of the Spirit, 
through the servants of God ; and I 
feel sure that all who came here 
this morning were well repaid. I 
was, for one; I enjoyed the spirit 
of the meeting and the instructions 
that were imparted, and I hope that 
all of us who were present, as was 
invoked in the beendiction when we 
dismissed, will carry with us, wher- 
ever we go, the influence that was 
felt this morning, and endeavor to 
carry out the instructions imparted, 
and to encourage others to do so : 
particularly people who were not 
able to be here. 

It is a very great privilege to 
dwell on the earth in this last dis- 
pensation. I believe with all my 
heart that this has been arranged by 
our heavenly Father. I believe in 
the doctrine of predestination — not 
that doctrine as it is taught in some 
of the so-called "Christian" sects, 
but I believe in the doctrine taught 
in the old scriptures as well as in 
the new, that before the founda- 
tions of the earth were laid, plans 
were prepared in regard to the peo- 
pling of the earth and the accom- 
plishment of the Divine purpose in 
sending the sons and daughters of 
God to dwell on the earth in the 
flesh. I believe in the doctrine 
taught by the Apostle Paul, on 
Mars Hill, "that God hath made of 
one blood all nations of men, for 
to dwell upon the face of the earth, 



and hath determined the times be- 
fore appointed and the bounds of 
their habitation." So that we did 
not come here by chance but by de- 
sign. But the Lord foresaw what 
would occur on the earth ; He un- 
derstood when our parents, "our 
first parents," as we call them, were 
placed in the Garden of Eden what 
they would do. But He was not 
personally instrumental in their dis- 
obedience, any more than He is in 
the obedience rendered to his divine 
commandments. He gave the com- 
mand and left our parents to act 
upon their own agency, to do as 
they desired, or as they willed. All 
was foreseen by our Heavenly 
Father, and knowing that death 
would be introduced in the world 
among its inhabitants, through the 
transgression of the first pair, He 
saw that there should be a means 
provided for redemption, and so 
Jesus — that is His earthly name, 
Jesus, our elder brother, called in 
the scriptures "the beginning of the 
creation of God," "the first-born of 
every creature," was chosen to be 
the Redeemer, to come on the earth 
at the time appointed and in the 
place appointed; and He came and 
performed the work allotted to Him. 
He did that of his own free will 
and choice. Sometimes, feeling the 
weakness of human nature inher- 
ited from his mother, he was in- 
clined to shrink from the terrible 
task imposed upon Him; but He 
came with one principle firmly es- 
tablished in his soul, which was 
the necessity of implicit obedience 
to the Divine Father; so He said: 
"I came not to do my own will but 
the will of Him that sent me." He 
performed the work allotted to Him, 
as the Father foresaw He would, 
but it was left to Him, to His own 
individuality, to His own choice to 



16 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



do or not to do that which He was 
commanded to perform. 

Now, I merely speak of that as a 
sample of what we believe, as the 
Apostle Paul taught, that this selec- 
tion has been in the mind of Deity, 
was in the mind of the Father be- 
fore the world was ; and so at dif- 
ferent periods in the history of the 
world, persons selected by the Al- 
mighty were sent upon the earth 
to tabernacle in flesh and perform 
missions that were necessary for 
them to undertake. I believe that 
in reference to the prophets who 
were raised up and to other mighty 
men in other positions in life — in 
civil office, in military affairs, in 
literary and poetic life. I believe 
that the poets and philosophers, and 
sages, as well as the military heroes, 
wise statesmen and grand leaders of 
the different centuries, were sent 
upon the earth at the right time, 
that they might be able to perform 
the works that were needful to be 
done, to carry out in the end the 
Divine purposes of our Heavenly 
Father. I believe that He has left 
the children of men to perform 
the missions allotted to them or to 
carry out their own inclinations and 
wishes and desires, to be obedient 
or disobedient, as they wish, and 
that in the end the result will be 
that the Father will overrule all 
that is done or left undone, that all 
things that occur in the history of 
the children of God will be over- 
ruled by our Eternal Father to ac- 
complish the great end and design 
and purpose which He had in view 
in sending us here. That, in a few 
words, is the salvation, the immor- 
tality and eternal life of man — man 
in the capacity of a spirit and a 
body united; man capable of enjoy- 
ing all things which the universe 
brings forth ; man able to obey the 



commandments of God, or to diso- 
bey them, so that we all might learn 
the virtue of obedience and the folly 
as well as the wickedness of diso- 
bedience, to learn the great lesson 
that obedience to eternal principles, 
eternal laws, brings happiness, 
power, advancement, development, 
preparation for higher and higher 
and higher stages of being, and 
that disobedience brings about the 
contrary. That is the great end in 
view. So I believe that in these 
latter days our Heavenly Father, 
in bringing about "the dispensation 
of the fullness of times," sent such 
spirits to the earth as would be 
capable of leading out and carrying 
on the great and mighty work, the 
greatest of all dispensations on this 
globe. 

I say, then, that we are privileged 
to be living on the earth in these 
latter days. I feel that way in my 
soul, and I am thankful to my 
Heavenly Father that I have had 
the opportunity of coming upon the 
earth at a time when the fullness 
of the everlasting gospel has been 
restored, and authority to preach it 
and to administer its ordinances 
and to prepare the way for the com- 
ing of the King of kings has been 
brought about, and that I have had 
the opportunity of coming here in 
this good time. I am thankful to 
God that in my youthful days I was 
able to see the beauty, to some ex- 
tent at least, of the gospel thus re- 
vealed, that my eyes were opened to 
see it, while all to whom I was re- 
lated were blind in their minds in 
regard to it. I believe that in the 
providence of God I have come on 
earth in the last days and that 
there was a work for me to do, arid 
I am glad I have been trying to do 
it to : the best of my ability, ever 
since I received the gospel, and

that today I am privileged to stand 
in fellowship with my brethren and 
sisters in the Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints, and still be 
able to do something towards fur- 
thering the purposes of our Heav- 
enly Father in this great dispensa- 
tion. So I am glad to be here to- 
day. I am glad to mingle with 
brethren and sisters who also have 
received the light, who have not re- 
jected the truth, but who received 
it eagerly, with honest hearts, and 
most of whom have endeavored to 
do their very best to build up the 
kingdom of God on the earth and 
to accomplish the purposes of our 
Heavenly Father, to be in union 
and harmony with Jesus Christ, our 
elder Brother, who, as He declared 
Himself to the Prophet Joseph, or 
through him to us, was "in the be- 
ginning with the Father and was 
the first-born." We are his breth- 
ren and sisters in the spirit, in our 
first estate, being born of our Eter- 
nal Father who begat us. We are 
the begotten of the Lord, in the 
spirit; but Jesus, the Christ, was 
the first begotten in the spirit and 
the only begotten of the Father in 
the flesh. 

I say it is a blessed privilege — 
to be in union and harmony with 
that great and mighty Being. If 
we only had the history of our 
Savior before the world was, be- 
fore He received the command of 
the Father to go down and take of 
the elements and organize them, if 
we knew how long He had existed 
in his organized spiritual state, and 
the works' that He had seen, that 
the Father had produced, we might 
be able to understand why He was 
actively engaged in the beginning 
of the earth, and why He was ap- 
pointed to do the work that He had 
to do, and why that "through Him 



and by Him and of Him the worlds 
were made" and that the revela- 
tions of the Father to us on this 
globe have all come by and through 
Him. But that history is shut out 
from our minds, whether we knew 
anything about it before we came 
here or not. I presume we knew 
a good deal, if we did not know it 
all ; but when we came here, like 
Him, in our humiliation, our judg- 
ment and knowledge of the past 
was taken away, or rather obscured 
by means of the flesh into which we 
entered. But He was a great and 
mighty Being ; He was the first- 
born, and when He was on the 
earth in the flesh, He said: "The 
Son doeth nothing but what the 
Father doeth, and He doeth noth- 
ing but what He seeth the Father 
do; for whatsoever the Father 
doeth, that the Son doeth, for the 
Father loveth the Son and showeth 
unto Him all things that He himself 
doeth; and He will show Him 
greater things than these, that ye 
may marvel." From that we learn 
from His own lips that before He 
came here He not only was the 
first-born, but the Father bestowed 
upon Him great knowledge and 
understanding, opened His eyes to 
see, and showed Him so that He 
comprehended the purposes and 
works of the Father, and patterned 
after them as far as He had the op- 
portunity. And He has promised 
that the time shall come when the 
works that He did shall be done by 
His disciples, those that believe in 
Him : "He that believeth in me, 
the works that I do shall he do also, 
and greater works than these shall 
he do, because I go to the Father." 

So, if we are in harmony with 
Him, my brethren and sisters, and 
are willing to receive the word of 
the Father, through His beloved 



18 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Son, who understands and compre- 
hends and knows and has been in- 
timate with the Father in all His 
great works and comprehends 
them, if we will be in harmony with 
Him we will find ample opporunity 
by and by to learn what He has 
learned, for it will be imparted un- 
to us. The same spirit, by which 
He was able to understand and do 
the works that He accomplished, is 
given to us, by measure, so to 
speak, and by and by, if we are pre- 
pared for it, we shall receive it in 
fullness and be clothed upon with 
the glory of God, with the light of 
the Lord, that proceeds from His 
presence, and all the endowments 
and powers and gifts that come by 
its full possession. That divine 
spirit of revelation will be ours to 
enjoy forever, and there will be no 
end to the increase of our intelli- 
gence and wisdom and knowledge 
and dominion and power and 
might, or to the increase of our 
posterity in worlds without end. 
Now, these things have become 
facts in my mind, and I presume 
they are the same in the minds of 
the majority of the brethren and 
sisters gathered here on this occa- 
sion, particularly the older mem- 
bers of the Church, who have had 
experience in it and have been in 
the ministry and have carried the 
Gospel to other parts of the world 
and have brought souls unto Christ. 
We should endeavor, as far as we 
have the power and opportunity, to 
impart these things to others, to 
teach them to our children, that 
they may grow up in the ways of 
the Lord, that they may live so that 
their eyes will be open to the true 
light, so that there will be no ob- 
struction between them and the 
Eternal Father of us all ; for though 
we are the fathers of their flesh, the 



real Father of their spirits, their 
organized, intelligent being, is our 
Father as well — our Father and 
our God and theirs also. 

Now, as the children of the Lord 
we meet here in conference, and 
it is a great privilege to be allowed 
to be here with a good degree of 
health and strength, with a desire in 
our souls to do right. I believe that 
is the spirit that fills the bosoms 
of this congregation, our brethren 
who have come from a distance, the 
Saints that have gathered in from 
the various stakes of Zion to wor- 
ship the Lord in the beauty of holi- 
ness. As Brother Lund told us, 
this morning, it was a great bless- 
ing and privilege to come up here 
as ancient Israel did to Jerusalem, 
once or twice a year at any rate, 
and receive instructions through 
the appointed channels. I was 
pleased to see the attention that 
was paid to the remarks made by 
our president this morning ; the 
congregation was interested. What 
we heard from him was plain and 
clear and satisfactory, and it was 
practical; and our religion is in all 
respects practical. Every truth that 
has been revealed, although it may 
be called psychological by some 
people, and may be viewed as be- 
yond the sphere of mortal life, yet 
it is all practical : there is something 
connected with it to do. When we 
learn a truth, whether it relates to 
the heavens or the earth, it be- 
comes our duty to make it a part 
of ourselves and to carry it out in 
our practical lives, to bring it down 
to our present conditions and cir- 
cumstances. To learn the mind and 
the will of God and then to do it, 
that is the duty of every Latter-day 
Saint ; and we are here on the earth 
in this great dispensation, not 
merely to receive the truth and re-

joke in its light, and in the splen- 
did feelings and communion that 
we have with the powers on high 
if we obey the commandments of 
the Lord, but to help to build up 
•God's government on this earth. 

The time is to come, so we read, 
when every knee will bow and ev- 
ery tongue confess that Jesus is 
the Lord, the Christ, to the glory of 
God the Father. What a splendid 
prospect to have in view ! What a 
grand goal to reach, to aid in bring- 
ing about the redemption of the hu- 
man family. Before that time can 
come, those that are wicked and 
corrupt and evil-minded, and who 
will not be obedient will have to 
reap the consequences of their own 
acts. I might repeat the words of 
the Apostle Paul : "Be not deceived ; 
God is not mocked; whatsoever a 
man soweth, that shall he also 
reap;" and (although forgiveness 
may some time come to the diso- 
bedient, first of all they will have 
to pay the penalty of their disobe- 
dience, that they may be brought 
fully to understand the necessity of 
implicit obedience to the right and 
the truth ; for everything that God 
reveals is right and true and bene- 
ficial. But the time is to come, 
away in the distant future, when 
the inhabitants of the earth, all who 
have dwelt upon it, with the ex- 
ception of a few who are unredeem- 
able, will be brought to bow the 
knee willingly; not by compulsion, 
not by coercion, not by constraint, 
but willingly bow the knee to King 
Immanuel and' worship God, the 
true God, the Father, in Christ's 
holy name, and be willing, perfect- 
ly willing, to render obedience to 
his commandments. Of course, the 
condition in which they will dwell 
will be consequent upon their do- 
ings when they were in the flesh. 



They cannot all be in the same 
class ; that is impossible. There is 
a difference in the degrees of intel- 
ligence. Every one of them has 
his own identity. Every son or 
daughter of God has a special iden- 
tity, and that will always be had. 
We will not all be of the same 
height or breadth, nor be exactly of 
the same outward appearance or of 
features, but every one will be him- 
self, and we will be cultivated and 
advanced and developed on our own 
lines. If sinners are only fit, after 
punishment, to enter into the Teles- 
tial world, there will be no end to 
the progress along telestial lines ; 
but those who thus come forth will 
be "bodies telestial and not bodies 
celestial," and there will be progress 
on every line and kind of being, for 
that is the order of the universe. 
Light and truth will come to us as 
fast as we are willing to receive it 
and obey it and put it into practice. 
That is what we should understand 
now ; and when we come to confer- 
ence we should come here prepared 
in our souls to receive good coun- 
sel, and then, when we go away, 
carry it out every day, right where 
we live, and to do that which is 
right, to avoid that which is wrong, 
to listen to the instructions of the 
man who stands at the head of the 
Church and his brethren in council 
who are called upon and authorized 
to give us advice. 

Now, the Apostle Paul, whom I 
have quoted from two or three 
times this afternoon, had something 
to say to the Saints in his day in 
regard to the progress they ought 
to have made ; he said : "Now, when 
for the time ye ought to be teachers 
it is needful that one teach you 
again which be the first principles 
of the oracles of God, and to give 
you milk when you ought to be old 



20 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



enough to have meat," or words to 
that effect. What did he mean "for 
the time ?" Why, for the time that 
they had been Saints, members of 
the Church. For the experience 
that they had had they ought by 
that time to have been in such ad- 
vancement that they could be teach- 
ers, but they had to be taught again 
which were the first principles of 
the oracles of God; and the apos- 
tle went on to describe which are 
the foundation principles of the 
Gospel: "Repentance from dead 
works, faith towards God, and the 
doctrine of baptisms and of laying 
on of hands, and of the resurrec- 
tion of the dead, and eternal judg- 
ment ;" and then he said they were 
to go on to perfection ; "and this 
will we do," said he, "if God per- 
mit." 

A few days ago, in the Histor- 
ian's Office* I came across some 
doctrines and principles, rules of 
order that were laid down by the 
President of the Church for the 
obedience of the people at the time 
when we, all of us old members, en- 
tered into what was called the 
United Order, by baptism. -Certain 
rules were given to us, and we 
agreed that we would abide by 
them. I thought it would be a very 
good thing to call the attention of 
the brethren and sisters to some of 
these rules, which I will do as 
briefly as I can, so as not to take up 
too much time; so that we may 
come back to some of these simple 
things that you and I covenanted 
to do, and see how they fit in with 
the instructions that were given to 
us this morning by President 
Smith : 

"First: We will not take tile name 
of Deity in vain, nor speak lightly of 
His character or of sacred things." 



Now, brethren and sisters, 
whether you were baptized at that 
time or not, that is a rule that you 
should observe ; that is one of the 
commandments of the Lord to us, 
to Latter-day Israel. And, by the 
way, we need not be tied up always 
to that which was told aforetime ; 
we are living in a day of revela- 
tion. As was explained by the 
brethren this morning, the book of 
Doctrine and Covenants contains 
revelations direct to us in our time, 
given from the Lord, just as much 
scripture as anything a thousand or * 
ten thousand years old, and one of 
these scriptures teaches us that we 
should not take the name of Deity 
in vain, nor speak lightly of His 
character or of sacred things. 
Sometimes we are in the habit of 
being jocular about things that are 
sacred. That is not right; we 
should hold them sacred and hold 
the name of Deity sacred. It al- 
ways gives me a jar when I hear 
the name of Deity taken lightly or 
in a profane way. Sometimes in 
some of our theatres, expletives are 
used in which profanity is made 
manifest. I dislike it very much, 
and Latter-day Saints ought never 
to descend to this custom that is 
had among certain classes of "Gen- 
tiles," as we sometimes call them, 
or as they call themselves. 

"Rule two: We will pray with our 
families morning and evening, and 
also attend to secret prayers." 

Are you carrying that out, breth- 
ren, you that made that promise 
and covenant? and you that did 
not, have been taught that this is 
part of your duty. The teachers 
are sent around, or priests rather, 
acting as teachers, to urge this upon 
the Saints. The priests are required 
"to visit the house of each member 



PRESIDENT CHARLES W. PENROSE. 



21 



and exhort them to pray, vocally 
and in secret, and attend to all fam- 
ily duties." Now, remember that 
this is incumbent upon you, if you 
want to carry out the command- 
ments of the Lord revealed through 
the Savior of men. 

"Rule three: We will observe and 
keep the Word of Wisdom, according 
to the spirit and meaning thereof." 

President Smith explained this 
morning what President Young 
had to say upon the spirit and 
meaning of the Word of Wisdom. 
Don't let us forget that, but carry 
out in our lives that which we have 
agreed to do. 

"Rule four: We will treat our fam- 
ilies with due kindness and affection, 
and set before them an example 
worthy of imitation. In our families 
and intercourse with all persons, we 
will refrain from being contentious 
or quarrelsome, and we will cease to 
speak evil of each other, and will cul- 
tivate a spirit of charity towards all. 
We consider it our duty to keep from 
acting selfishly or from covetous mo- 
tives, and will seek the interest of each 
other and the salvation of all man- 
kind." 

That is good doctrine, is it not? 
no matter where it came from ; and 
we should live according to this, 
abstain from contention and dispu- 
tations. Sometimes we have a lit- 
tle of that in our midst, and upon 
subjects that are not worth con- 
tending for, little points of doc- 
trine that do not affect our present 
and will not affect our future, 
brought up for discussion some- 
times in our theological classes, and 
in our quorum meetings, and they 
are not worth spending time on, 
and sometimes brethren write about 
these things up direct to the presi- 
dent of the Church, when all such 
questions that are sent up ought to 
be solved right where they are, in 



a local capacity, by the help of the 
bishop, or the president of the stake 
or some of the good brethren who 
are acquainted with these points, 
and they should not be sent up 
to bother and trouble the president 
when they are of no particular 
value or use or practicality. And 
when you do write, if you have to 
write, brethren and sisters — for we 
get letters from the sisters — don't 
take a poor, miserable lead pencil 
and rub it over the paper with char- 
acters that one cannot decipher 
without a magnifying" glass ; be 
kind enough to write with ink, if 
you write at all, and write so plain- 
ly that anybody might read it. Now, 
brethren and sisters, let us ob- 
serve this in our homes, in our fam- 
ilies. Our religion is practical. In 
the home, where we dwell, that is 
the place where we should be re- 
ligious. Be kind and affectionate 
one toward another, bear with each 
other's infirmities and weaknesses, 
and overlook the little flaws that 
you may see in each other's char- 
acter, and observe the good things. 
We are all fallible, all liable to be 
mistaken, all liable to act out the 
"Old Adam," as it is sometimes 
called, in us ; but we have to learn 
to be Saints of the Most High, fol- 
lowing in the footsteps of Jesus 
Christ, our Redeemer, that we may 
be one with Him, and by and by 
may dwell with Him in glory. 

"Rule five: We will observe per- 
sonal cleanliness and preserve our- 
selves in all chastity, by refraining 
from adultery, whoredom and lust. 
We will also discountenance and re- 
frain from all vulgar and obscene lan- 
guage or conduct." 

Brethren, have you kept that cov- 
enant? Don't you sometimes in- 
dulge in conversation, in language 
that does not comport with your 



22 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



position as Latter-day Saints, to say 
nothing of holding the priesthood 
of the living God? Don't forget 
this injunction, to abstain from vul- 
gar language, anything that is ob- 
scene and improper. If you in- 
dulge in these things it will bring 
with it a spirit that belongs to that 
kind of conversation, but if you 
want to preserve the spirit of pur- 
ity and chastity and virtue and holi- 
ness before the Lord, abstain from 
that kind of conversation. 

"Rule six: We will observe the 
Sabbath day to keep it holy, in accord- 
ance with the revelation." 

I am sorry to say that this is not 
fully carried out in Israel. I don't 
want to find fault, but I know that 
sometimes we are derelict in this 
matter. Observe the Sabbath day, 
according to the revelation. What 
do the revelations say on it? Read 
the fifty-ninth section of the Doc- 
trine and Covenants. The Lord says 
we are to go to the house of prayer 
on His holy day, that is, the first 
day of the week, that is the Lord's 
day. On that day we are to go to 
His holy house, and we are to offer 
up our sacraments and pay our de- 
votions to the Most High ; "and on 
this day thou shalt do none other 
thing, only let thy food be prepared 
with singleness of heart, that thy 
fasting may be perfect, or in other 
words that thy joy may be full." 
Don't let us forget the Sabbath day 
to keep it holy, and to teach that to 
our children, for so we are com- 
manded of the Lord besides what 
I have read here in these rules. 

"Rule seven: That which is com' 
mitted to our care we will not appro- 
priate to our own use." 

If that had been carried out by 
some of our friends they would 



have saved themselves a vast 
amount of trouble and disgrace. 
When anything is committed to out- 
care, we have no right to appropri- 
ate it to our own use, no right to 
borrow it, no right to invest it for 
our own benefit. If public officials, 
all of them, would follow that out, 
some of them would save them- 
selves from the penitentiary; all 
who misappropriate the property of 
another will eventually get into dis- 
grace, and they might save them- 
selves from that disgrace if they 
would observe that rule, which is 
proper for all people whether in 
public or in private life. Young 
men, in this congregation, if ever 
you come into positions where you 
are entrusted with funds belonging 
to the public, or to any corporation, 
or person other than yourself, re- 
member that you have no right to 
appropriate it to your own use; it 
belongs to the use for which it was 
designed in the beginning. 

"Rule eight: That which we borrow 
we will return according to promise, 
and that which we find we will not 
appropriate to our own use, but seek 
to return it to its proper owner." 

Don't forget that. If you find 
money in the street or in the car, 
that does not belong to you, you 
have no right to appropriate it to 
your own personal use ; and if you 
borrow money and agree to pay it 
on a certain day, pay it, or if you 
cannot, be sure to communicate 
with the lender that he may under- 
stand that you are not going to ig- 
nore him and your promise. Many 
do make such promises, sometimes 
put their hands to notes and pay 
little attention towards repaying 
that which they have borrowed, 
but if this rule were carried out 
which we agreed to follow, we 



PRESIDENT CHARLES W. PENROSE. 



23 



would save ourselves and other peo- 
ple a great deal of annoyance and 
sometimes great financial loss. 
When you borrow, return that 
which was lent to you. 

"Rule eleven : In our apparel and 
deportment, we will not pattern after 
nor encourage foolish and extrava- 
gant fashions, and will cease to import 
or buy from abroad any article which 
can reasonably be dispensed with, or 
which can be produced by combina- 
tion of home labor." 

We are trying to carry this out, 
to a small degree, but not to the 
extent that we ought to do. Patron- 
ize home manufactures, promote 
home manufactures, do all you can 
to produce right in the midst of 
Israel that which Israel needs, and 
you will be the better off for it fin- 
ancially, and you will feel the better 
for it spiritually. 

"Rule twelve: We will be simple in 
our dress and manner of living, using 
proper economy and prudence in the 
management of all entrusted to our 
care." 

There are some few other rules 
here that I will not take the time to 
read, because they are mixed up 
with some things we had to do in 
that Order I have referred to; but 
all I have read to you, it seems to 
me, are appropriate to be brought 
to the attention of the Latter-day 
Saints now. I would to the Lord 
that all our girls and women who 
indulge in these modern immodest 
fashions had heard the instructions 
from our president this morning. 
The trouble is that those kind of 
persons do not come to meeting as 
much as others, but we can carry 
these counsels with us and impart 
them to others, and mothers in 
Israel can vise their influence with 
their eirls to dress modestly and 
properly, and, as far as possible, 



from such material and labor as can 
be had at home. We do not need 
to send to Paris, to the demi- 
monde, to get a fashion. Indeed, 
the mothers in Israel, the sisters of 
the Relief Society, and the Mutual 
Improvement Associations should 
endeavor to have such fashions in 
dress as will be modest and proper 
and be for the purpose for which 
dress is made — not to display the 
form divine but in some respects to 
conceal it, and to have dress suited 
to the individual, not to be all run- 
ning in one style, as if you had to 
pattern after the fashions of the 
world. Years ago these instruc- 
tions were given by President Brig- 
ham Young and other leaders in 
Israel, and it would be a good thing 
if our Saints today could be 
brought to see the impropriety of 
the kind of dress that fashion calls 
for out here in the west. Respect- 
able ladies in the East and in Eu- 
rope do not pattern after them, be- 
cause they know whence they pro- 
ceed ; they come from that order of 
women that the President alluded 
to this morning, and it is a shame 
and a disgrace to our beautiful, 
modest, nice girls to be attired or 
half-atttired in such fashion. Breth- 
ren and sisters, let us do in kind- 
ness all that we were advised to do 
this morning and get our girls and 
our sisters to dress themselves mod- 
estly and properly. 

Now, you may say that all these 
are little things. Yes, they are ; 
but the world is made up of little 
things, and comfort and joy and 
salvation are made up of little 
things, things that are necessary, 
things that are expedient. Let us 
remember this, that we people in 
the latter days, sent down upon the 
earth to build up the kingdom of 
God in the dispensation of the full- 



24 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



ness of times, should take today 
what the Lord reveals, take today 
the counsel that is given, take the 
policies and projects and plans that 
are revealed today, whether they 
are in accordance with olden things 
or not. But we shall find, when we 
compare the spirit and teachings 
and real principles that are given to 
us in the latter day, that they are in 
accord with that which was re- 
vealed of old. Principles never 
change, through all the eternities, 
but policies do, and should, accord- 
ing to circumstances. 

I have occupied more time than 
I intended to and, perhaps, too 
much for this afternoon meeting. 
Excuse me if I have. God bless 
you, brethren and sisters. May His 
peace be with you. I thank God 
with all my soul that I am with you 
in the building up of this great lat- 
ter-day kingdom. There is nothing 
like it anywhere. There never was 
anything to be compared with it, 
for its magnitude, for the intelli- 
gence and light and truth revealed, 
for the purposes of God made 
known, and these are only the be- 
ginnings of good things. Light and 
truth will be made manifest, and 
principles of eternal life will come 
down from the skies to us, through 
the appointed channels, and Israel 
will grow and multiply and increase 
in numbers, in influence and in 
power, and by 'and by fulfill the 
ancient predictions and be the head 
and not the foot. I thank the Lord 
for the inventions and developments 
among us, for the disposition to 
grow and increase in all that is 
good, for the musical talent that we 
have, for the abilities manifest in 
various directions which I will not 
take time to enumerate ; all these 
things come from our kind, wise, 
Heavenly Father ; and unto him be 



all the glory, for ever and ever, 
through Jesus Christ. Amen.

(Of the First Council of Seventy.) 

TESTIMONIES IN BRONZE AND STONE. 

I was unavoidably detained from 
the first session of the conference 
and, therefore, missed what was un- 
doubtedly the valuable instructions 
given on that occasion. I rejoice, 
however, with my brethren, that I 
have the opportunity of being pres- 
ent this afternoon and partaking 
with you of the spirit that has evi- 
dently come into this conference ; 
and I am delighted, for one, to 
have my mind refreshed upon the 
duties and obligations that I owe, 
in common with you, to the Gospel 
of Jesus Christ. 

I rejoice in the great truths that 
President Penrose has presented to 
us this afternoon. I rejoice to be 
reminded that the truth remains, 
and that we find it, notwithstanding 
the lapse of years, the same as in 
former times. It certainly is re- 
freshing to have this thought in our 
minds, namely, that the truth is al- 
ways the same ; but that as the years 
go by, the volume of it enlarges, 
and the witnesses to it increase, and 
more and more the attractions about 
it multiply as the years go by. In 
this connection I would like to call 
your attention to the growth of in- 
terest that we find in coming up to 
the headquarters of the Church and 
visiting this Temple Block, where

we are increasing the number of 
testimonies in stone as well as in 
word ; multiplying in bronze as well 
as by verbal utterance, the me- 
morials of God's dealings with His 
people. 

I would like to read to you, as 
introductory to inviting your atten- 
tion to these things, a passage from 
the old scriptures relating to a cer- 
tain great incident in the history of 
ancient Israel. When Joshua was 
leading Israel from the east side of 
Jordan to the west side, the Lord 
apparently desired to magnify His 
name, both in Israel and among the 
peoples of that country ; and, there- 
fore, with power and an outstretch- 
ed arm He began the establishment 
of His people in the promised land. 
In crossing Jordan, at the flood tide 
—which occurs at the harvest time 
— he caused that when the priests 
took the Ark of the covenant, — 
which was the sign of God's visible 
presence in Israel, — when they car- 
ried it to the waters of Jordan, the 
waters were divided, and the priests 
stood in the bed of the river, the 
waters being held back by the power 
of God, while the hosts of Israel 
passed over dry shod. Joshua was 
commanded to direct twelve men in 
Israel, one from each tribe, to go 
to the place where the priests stood 
and carry from thence stones, which 
should be erected as a memorial 
altar unto the Lord, of the manifes- 
tation of His power on that occa- 
sion in behalf of His people. I now 
read what the scriptures say about 
that incident: 

"Then Joshua called the twelve men, 
whom he had prepared of the children 
of Israel, out of every tribe a man; 

"And Joshua said unto them; Pass 
over before the Ark of the Lord your 
God, into the midst of Jordan, and 
take you up, every man of you, a stone 
upon his shoulder, according unto the 



number of tribes of the children of 
Israel ; 

"That this may be a sign among 
you, that when your children ask their 
fathers in time to come, saying, What 
mean ye by these stones? 

"Then ye shall answer them, that 
the waters of Jordan were cut off be- 
fore the Ark of the covenant of the 
Lord; when it passed over Jordan, the 
waters of Jordan were cut off; and 
these stones shall be for a memorial 
unto the children of Israel for ever; 

=i: * * # $ 

"And those twelve stones which 
they took out of Jordan did Joshua 
pitch in Gilgal; 

"And he spake unto the children of 
Israel, saying, When your children 
shall ask their fathers in time to come, 
saying, What mean these stones? 

"Then ye shall let your children 
know, saying, Israel come over this 
Jordan on dry land; 

"For the Lord God dried up the 
waters of Jordan from before you, 
until ye pased over, as the Lord your 
God did to the Red sea which he dried 
up from before us, until we were gone 
over ; 

"That all the people of the earth 
might know the hand of the Lord, that 
it is mighty: that ye might fear the 
Lord your God for ever." (Joshua 
4:4-7, 20-24.) 

The Lord was anxious, appar- 
ently, that there should be a testi- 
mony in stone, an enduring monu- 
ment of the manifestation of His 
power in behalf of Israel. I think 
I catch a glimpse of the same spirit 
in the experiences of modern Israel. 
For many years, now, with a great 
joy, I have looked upon this mag- 
nificent Temple upon this block, as 
a collective testimony in stone, to 
God's presence and power and sal- 
vation, among the Latter-day Saints 
that is mightier, perhaps, than the 
verbal testimony of any man, be- 
cause it may be seen by so many, 
unmoved through many genera- 
tions, and has been established by 
the collective mites of a community. 
They have builded a monument of 



26 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



testimony in stone that God has 
given commandments to this gener- 
ation. I was struck not long since, 
when writing the history of the 
times in which the foundations of 
this Temple were laid. I know not 
how it will appeal to you, but it 
thrilled me and gave me great joy 
when I contemplated the circum- 
stances of the Latter-day Saints un- 
der which they laid that marvelous 
foundation, sixteen feet in depth and 
sixteen feet broad, of solid granite 
wall. At the time that immense 
foundation was laid — upwards of 
ninety-nine feet from north to 
south, through the towers ; over a 
hundred and eighty-six feet east 
and west, through the towers — the 
Saints knew that its walls — nine 
feet of solid granite in width, in the 
lower story, and tapering to six 
feet in the upper story — would 
reach a height of one hundred and 
seven feet ; with the east tower, two 
hundred and ten feet high ; 
and the west tower some six 
feet less in height. They knew 
that such, in the rough, were 
to be its dimensions. At the 
time, less than five thousand Latter- 
day Saints were in this city ; and 
less than twenty thousand Latter- 
day Saints in the territory of Utah ; 
yet they had the magnificent faith 
to lay the foundations of such a 
mighty testimony in stone as this 
has become. Its foundations were 
laid in the midst of the poverty of 
the people, and forty toilsome years 
were consumed in bringing it to 
the capstone and to completion ! Yet 
there it stands, a magnificent testi- 
mony of the Latter-day Saints to 
the world ; an altar erected that 
stands for the chastity of the indi- 
vidual, the purity of the home, the 
close linking of man in brotherhood 
with man, and in fatherhood with 



God; standing for the salvation 
both of the living and of the dead, 
a modern witness for God in stone, 
greater — far greater — than that 
erected under the direction of 
Joshua. I may not dwell upon all 
that it suggests; I can only name 
these few things, because I want to 
call your attention to some other 
monuments. 

Out here on this Temple- square, 
we have the bronze statue of 
Joseph Smith, the prophet of the 
great and new dispensation of 
the Gospel ; and the statue also 
of his faithful brother, Hyrum 
Smith, standing upon granite pedes- 
tals, properly inscribed, declaring" 
their mission and their achievements 
in the world, so far as those achieve- 
ments can be briefly stated, saying,, 
doubtless, in the inscriptions what 
the Prophet Joseph would like to 
say if he could meet face to face the 
tens and hundreds of thousands of 
people who read the burning words 
of truth which God gave him to 
speak to this generation. These ut- 
terances are recorded upon the 
bronze tablets, and the Prophet is 
thus voicing forth his message to 
the world, and though dead, yet 
speaketh, in this memorial of bronze 
and stone, that loving hands have 
erected upon this square. 

It gave me delight more than I 
can express to you here, the other 
day, to take two of my daughters, 
one of whom I expect soon to go to 
the east — into the world — and to 
view with them this beautiful Sea 
Gull Monument just completed and 
very recently fittingly dedicated to 
the purposes for which it was erect- 
ed. I pointed out to them how it 
told the story of God's deliverance 
of the Latter-day Saints in this val- 
ley in the year 1848. I rejoice with 
my whole heart, not onlv in "the

beauty of that great offering as a 
memorial to God for His goodness 
to our fathers, not only in its per- 
fections as a work of art, but I look 
beyond all that to the thing that it 
represents — our recognition of 
God's great goodness in delivering 
His people from threatened destruc- 
tion — a collective testimony of the 
people — to the goodness of God to 
our fathers. It will stand, I believe, 
through many generations, one 
of the most beautiful, or to me- 
morialize one of the most beau- 
tiful incidents in the many wonder- 
ful experiences of the Latter-day 
Saints. For indeed, Israel was so 
situated in the summer of 1848, that 
if God had not wrought out a de- 
liverance for them, then there was 
nothing but starvation for the peo- 
ple and reproach to the God of 
Israel who had brought them to this 
land. For this reason, the Lord felt 
Himself bound to work out the de- 
liverance which that combination of 
bronze and stone stands to me- 
morialize. 

The story is told eloquently, bet- 
ter than words will ever tell it, in the 
bronze tablets around the base of the 
monument. [The speaker in the re- 
vision of his remarks has amplified 
somewhat the description of the tab- 
lets for the sake of completeness.] 
The graceful Doric column of the 
monument, surmounting the base, is 
fifteen feet high, and is topped by 
a granite sphere, on which two 
Gulls are seen in the act of lighting 
upon it — a most graceful thing in 
itself, and Mr. Young, the sculptor, 
has caught the action of it true to 
life. 

On three sides of the high base in 
relief sculpture the Sea Gull story 
is told : The tablature on the east 
tells of the arrival and early move- 
ments of the Pioneers. In the left 



foreground of the rugged Wasatch 
mountains there is the man a-field 
with ox team plowing the stubborn 
soil, aided by the boy driver, fol- 
lowed by the sower. In the right 
foreground is the wagon home, 
women preparing the humble meal, 
while an Indian sits in idle but 
graceful pose looking upon all this 
strange activity that is to redeem his 
land from savagery and give it to 
civilization. 

The second tablature — ou the 
south — tells the story of the threat- 
ened devastation from the crickets' 
invasion. A point of mountain and 
a glimpse of the placid, distant lake 
is seen. The pioneer farmer's fight 
with the invading pest is ended — he 
has exhausted all his ingenuity in the 
fight, and his strength. He is beaten 
— you can see that in the hopeless 
sinking of his figure to earth, his 
bowed head and listless down-hang- 
ing hands from which the spade has 
fallen. Despair claims him — -and 
laughs. With the woman of this 
tablature it is different. She is hold- 
ing a child by the hand — through it 
she feels throbbing the call of the 
future — the life of a generation of 
men and women yet to be. Strange 
that to woman — man's complement 
— is given such superior strength in 
hours of severest trial. Where man's 
strength and courage and fighting 
ends, woman's hope and faith and 
trust seem to spring into newness of 
life. From her nature she seems able 
to do this inconsistent yet true thing 
— to hope against hope, and ask till 
she receives. I do not know in 
what school of psychology the 
sculptor studied his art. but he has 
certainly been true to the great 
psychological difference between 
man and woman. But to return to 
this woman of the second tablature 
— she. too. is toil worn, and there is 



28 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



something truly pathetic in her body 
weariness, but her head is raised. 
Raised to what until now has 
seemed the pitiless skies ; but now 
they are filled with the oncoming- 
flocks of Sea Gulls. Does she watch 
their coming with merely idle curi- 
osity or vague wonderment? Or 
does her soul in the strange Gull-cry 
hear God's answer to her call for 
help? God's answer to her they 
were, these Gulls, in any event, as 
the Gulls soon proved by devouring 
the destroyer. 

The third tablature commemor- 
ates the Pioneers' first harvest — 
worthily, too. In the background 
rises Ensign Peak. In the middle 
background the log house home 
stands finished ; in the foreground 
harvesting the golden grain is in 
progress, both men and women take 
joyous part. To the right a mother 
half kneeling holds to her full breast 
a babe, who "on the heart and from 
the heart" receives his nourishment, 
and about her knees two other chil- 
dren play in happy, childish oblivion 
of toil or care. O, happy scene, of 
life and joy, "where Plenty leaps to 
laughing life with her redundant 
horn." 

On the fourth tablature is the title 
of the monument. Fortunately it is 
simple, and not explanatory — the 
work' of the sculptor tells the story 
— tells it well and eloquently. Too 
much narration would have marred 
it — this is the inscription : 

SEA GULL MONUMENT 
ERECTED IN GRATEFUL REMEM- 
BRANCE OF 
THE MERCY OF GOD TO THE MORMON 
PIONEERS. 

Yes, let us own it. The salvation 
wrought out in that year of grace, 
1848, for the "Mormon" Pioneers, 



was Thy work, Helper of the help- 
less, and Supplementer of man's en- 
deavor ; giving him of Thy bounte- 
ous strength when his strength fails. 
How shall we honor Thee for Thy 
tender mercies to menward, but by 
acknowledgment of them, by hold- 
ing them in memory, and speaking 
of them to our children, and to our 
children's children, to the remotest 
generation ? 

Though from afar the Sea Gulls 
came and destroyed the destroyer, it 
was Thy voice, O Lord, that called 
them — they did but do Thy bidding 
— the deliverance was of Thee and 
by Thee. And though in these 
grouped symbols of the monument 
the beautiful agency of Thy mer- 
ciful act is chiefly present, still be- 
yond and above these to our con- 
sciousness the Eternal Cause of such 
events stands smiling. 

Long may these testimonies of 
stone and bronze, which our feeble 
hands have erected, stand on this 
sacred block as God's witnesses unto 
the inhabitants of the earth, that He 
has given a new dispensation of His 
truth to man, and confirmed it by a 
manifestation of His mercy and 
power in the deliverance of His peo- 
ple, I pray, in the name of Jesus. 
Amen. 

ELDER JOSEPH W. M'MTTREIN. 

(Of the First Council of Seventy.) 

It is a very delightful thing, my 
brethren and sisters, to sit and listen 
to the inspired words that have fal- 
len from the lips of the servants of 
the Lord, in the remarks that have 
thus far been made during our con- 
ference. It is altogether a differ- 
ent matter to stand up in the pres- 
ence of this great multitude of peo- 
ple to give instruction that will be 
for the advantage of those who have

gathered together for the worship 
of our Father in heaven. I feel, 
my brethren and sisters, necessity 
for the companionship and direction 
of the Holy Spirit, that the few 
words that I utter may be of some 
value to some of those who are 
gathered in this holy house this 
afternoon. 

I am very thankful that in the 
providence of the Almighty my lot 
has been cast with the people of the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints, grateful am I for "Mor- 
mon" parentage and for being 
reared under the influence of the 
Gospel of the Redeemer of men, as 
it has been revealed in this latter 
dispensation, through the great 
prophet, Joseph Smith. I rejoice 
in my soul, my brethren and sis- 
ters, that the power that was able 
to take my father and mother from 
a far off land and turn their faces 
and feet Zion-ward, is still at work 
among the children of men reveal- 
ing to them, and to the sons and 
daughters of those who planted the 
work of our God in days gone by 
the wonderful truth of the things 
of which we have been hear- 
ing. Thank God those children are 
not to be left without evidence and 
testimony of the truth of the story 
that has been related to them so 
(earnestly by faithful fathers and 
mothers many of whom have now 
fallen asleep. I have often mar- 
veled, at the testimonies of men, as 
they have borne record in my hear- 
ing to the truth of the work of God, 
and to the knowledge that had been 
given them concerning the purposes 
of our Father in heaven. In the 
days of my boyhood, I have won- 
dered how it was possible that such 
knowledge could be given to the 
sons of men. But I humbly and 
thankfully say, this afternoon, that 



I am today possessed with a joy 
passing all understanding because 
of the fact that in the providences 
and kindness of our Father in heav- 
en, the truth that was made mani- 
fest to my own parents afar off, and 
that brought them to this region 
of country, has also been revealed 
to me in the very same manner in 
which it was shown to my parents, 
and that is by the power of the Holy 
Spirit. Thank God we can look in- 
to the future with confidence and 
hope, believing that the same God 
who has inspired the fathers of the 
past, and who has given saving 
knowledge to the fathers and moth- 
ers of the present generation, will 
also be mindful of those who are 
to come in the future, and that the 
divine revelation that we have heard 
of from our brethren, will continue 
to flow from our Father in heaven 
to the sons and daughters of all fu- 
ture generations. It is the will of 
the Father that they shall also be 
made to know that there is a God in 
heaven, and that He has established 
the work in which we are now la- 
boring. He has decreed that His 
work shall gather strength and 
power, and that it shall attract the 
attention of many men. God has 
said it shall gather from every na- 
tion under heaven those who are to 
be saved and they shall be pricked, 
by the power of God and be led 
to the gathering place of the peo- 
ple of the Lord. 

Some of the things that we have 
heard, my brethren and sisters, may 
be classed among the deep things 
of the kingdom, they may seem to 
be very great and very wonderful, 
and yet there are other precious 
things that are easily understood 
and seem to be very simple. Let 
us be very thankful for the things 
that are simple. We should all 



30 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



praise God and be thankful for the 
testimony that has been borne in our 
hearing that the winning of salva- 
tion in the presence of the great 
creator is but a simple thing. That 
it is by the doing of little things that 
do not call for any very marvelous 
talent, that men and women will 
eventually work out their salvation 
and be approved by our Father in 
heaven. That gives me hope, it 
gives me courage to know that God 
will not make any requirement of 
me that I am not able to meet, if I 
will but hearken to' the counsels 
that are imparted from time to time, 
and endeavor to do as best I may 
the things that are allotted to me to 
do. I feel that every man and every 
woman who has named the name of 
the Redeemer, should take comfort 
in the thought that God makes no 
requirement of men, neither of com- 
munities, that they are not able to 
meet. God always provides a way 
for the carrying out of His com- 
mandments and for the accomplish- 
ment of all His purposes. 

I hope that as a people we will be 
mindful of the blessings of the 
Lord that rest upon us so bounti- 
fully. Wherever we go, in travel- 
ing about among the people, in the 
north, and in the south, in the east, 
and in the west, we see that the 
hand of God has been over the peo- 
ple ; that they are being blest and 
prospered ; that the people are reap- 
ing bounteous harvests ; so bounti- 
ful that they scarcely are able to 
take care of the things that have 
been given them by our Father in 
heaven and that are now being gar- 
nered from the harvest field. We 
ought not to be forgetful of the de- 
mands of the Lord in our pros- 
perity. We have had reference made 
in regard to the principle of tithing, 
to honoring the requirement of our 



Father in relation to this great law. 
I think we ought to be glad 
to honor God and to give to Him, 
whatever may be necessary in the 
observance of His law, that we may 
have continued claim upon His 
blessings. We should set such ex- 
amples before our offspring that 
they will always remember in the 
future of their lives, even after we 
ourselves may be called away from 
this sphere of action, that father 
and mother observed the command- 
ments of the Lord, that they were 
honest with Father in heaven. Such 
example will surely bear fruit in 
the lives of the children, and per- 
chance in a time to come, prick their 
hearts and bring them to repentance, 
if they should ever be indifferent, 
or if they ever incline to wayward- 
ness concerning the commandments 
of the Lord. Do you ever think 
of the feelings fathers and mothers 
must have, who do not observe the 
Word of Wisdom, who are not hon- 
est with the Lord in the payment 
of their tithing, when they discover 
that their children are growing up 
around them, and are going to 
places of worship, and to various 
organizations that have been estab- 
lished by the commandment and will 
of God for the education of the ris- 
ing generation, where they are 
properly taught the things of God. 
When they learn the necessity -of 
yielding obedience to the Word of 
Wisdom, and of putting away the 
things that are injurious to their 
wonderful physical organizations, 
they at the same time discover that 
they have lived in the homes of 
their parents, contrary to the coun- 
sel of the Lord. There must be 
strange feelings take possession of 
boys and girls under such condi- 
tions. Humiliation also must come 
to parents when they know the chil- 



ELDER JOSEPH W. McMURRIN. 



31 



dren have discovered that father 
and mother have not been true to 
the faith. I think every father and 
mother should be anxious to so live 
that when their sons and daughters 
go out from the home, when they 
come in contact with officers, and 
with elders of the Church who are 
preaching the Gospel of the Re- 
deemer of the world, they will al- 
ways have something bearing testi- 
mony within them : "That is what 
I have been taught by my father 
and by my mother; that example 
has always been set before me in 
my home. There is nothing strange 
or new in relation to these things. 
I have been acquainted with them 
all my life." I understand, my 
brethren and sisters, that we are not 
only to win salvation ourselves, by 
an observance of the little things, 
we are also by such example, to win 
men who are in darkness to the 
light as it is now manifest. The 
Word of Wisdom, the law of tith- 
ing, the honoring of the Sabbath 
clay, being honest with our fellow 
men, being good citizens, being in- 
dustrious, and sober, and upright, 
these little things, as they may be 
termed, can be complied with by all 
men, and their observance make up 
a perfect character, that sort of char- 
acter that is required by our Father 
in heaven, that men may be saved 
in His presence when they have fin- 
ished with the battle of life. 

I thank God for the thrill that 
comes into my being as I listen to 
the testimonies of the servants of 
the Lord, and that I have no feeling 
of opposition to the counsels and 
doctrines that have been given us 
by those who have a right to teach, 
but that I have the feeling in my 
heart that what we have been 
taught, is true. The counsels as 
imparted are for my benefit and for 



my advantage, and to assist me in 
winning the battle in which I am 
engaged. I am thankful for a 
knowledge of the truth of the work 
of God and for the splendid his- 
tory that has been made by the peo- 
ple of the Lord. The more one 
studies the history of the Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 
the more he discovers in it, that 
makes him feel this surely is not 
the work of men, but it must be the 
work of God. 

I plead with men to seek to mag- 
nify the authority of the holy priest- 
hood, in the preaching of the Gos- 
pel of the Lord Jesus Christ, preach- 
ing it at home as it is preached 
abroad. I regret, my brethren and 
sisters, that there is occasion to cry 
out to men who have been honored 
with divine authority, and who have 
been magnified in the eyes of men, 
in the preaching of the word of the 
Lord, to return to the path of duty, 
and live the principles here at home 
in the wards and stakes of Zion, 
that they have taught men abroad 
in the world to receive. We need to 
remember that the eyes not only of 
those who are not of us, but the 
eyes of those who may have been 
convinced by our own teaching and 
testimony abroad in the various mis- 
sions of the world, rest upon us 
here in Zion, and that we are re- 
sponsible for the discourse we are 
delivering day by day, by our con- 
duct and in choosing the path in 
which we walk, our example is ob- 
served by the people. I would like 
to invite and plead with mission- 
aries that they shall not only bear 
testimony when they come home to 
their people, of the hand of God that 
has been over them, and His bless- 
ing that has attended them, but 
that they will manifest, year in and 
year out, that their hearts are filled

with gratitude because of those 
blessings, and because God has re- 
vealed unto them the truth of His 
Gospel, and has honored them with 
the power and authority of His 
priesthood. 

There is room for every man to 
work in Zion. There is a cry in 
every ward, and with every presid- 
ing officer, for help that the youth 
may be cared for, that the organiz- 
ations of the Church may be looked 
after, that the principles of the Gos- 
pel may be brought constantly to 
the attention of the people. ^Ve 
who have received the authority of 
the priesthood and who have been 
so marvelously and abundantly blest 
by our Heavenly Father, should see 
to it that we are exercising the au- 
thority that has been conferred upon 
us, for the glorifying of the name 
of our Father in heaven and the 
salvation of the souls of men. 

I rejoice that I have standing in 
the Church. I bear record and testi- 
mony to the truth of the Gospel. 
I know it is the power of God. I 
know it has been revealed from the 
heavens. I know the Father and 
the Son have appeared upon this 
earth, in our own time, and that 
They taught Joseph Smith the way 
of salvation ; that They also sent 
holy angels conferring upon Him 
* the authority of the holy priesthood, 



and gave him commandment for the 
organization of the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints. I have 
learned this by the manifestations 
of the Spirit of the Lord to me as 
an individual, and I feel grateful 
for this testimony. I pray that it 
may remain with me, and that a 
similar testimony may remain also 
with you, my brethren and sisters. 
May our lives be fruitful in evidence 
that God has revealed to us the 
truth, and may our light and right 
living lead other men to an investi- 
gation of the message that has been 
committed to men in our own dis- 
pensation. God grant that the hearts 
of many may be touched, that they 
also may have their feet planted 
in the straight and narrow way that 
leads back into the presence of our 
Father and to the eternal salvation 
of the human family. God help us 
all to endure to the end, I humbly 
pray, through Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The congregation sang the hymn : 

We thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet 
To guide us in these latter days; 

We thank Thee for sending the gospel 
To lighten our minds with its rays. 

Benediction was pronounced by 
Elder Heber S. Allen. 

Conference adjourned until 10 
a. m-, Sunday, October 5th, 1913. 



SECOND DAY. 



In the Tabernacle, Sunday, Octo- 
ber 5th, 10 a. m. 

Conference was called to order 
by President Joseph F. Smith. 

President Smith announced that, 
.•for the benefit of the great number 
of people unable to obtain admis- 
sion to the Tabernacle, overflow 
meetings will be held in the adjoin- 
ing Assembly Hall this morning, 
and afternoon, and in front of the 
Bureau of Information at 2 p. m. 

The Tabernacle choir sang the 
hymn : 

Awake, ye Saints of God, awake! 

Call on the Lord in mighty prayer, 
That He will Zion's bondage break, 

And bring to naught the fowler's 
snare. 

Prayer was offered by Elder 
James Duckworth. 

The choir sang the hymn : 

Though deep'ning trials throng your 
way, 

Press on, press on, ye Saints of God! 
Ere long the resurrection day 

Will shed it's life and light abroad. 

PRESIDENT FRANCIS M. LYMAN. 

Extended comments on Paul's sayings 
about Bishops — Admonitions applicable 
to all the Priesthood — A field of labor 
for every man ordained — Reponsibility 
of every man and woman to minister 
to others — Marriage for time and eter- 
nity should be the rule. 

I trust my brethren and sisters, 
that the same good spirit enjoyed by 
the President in speaking to us yes- 
terday may be with us on this occa- 
sion. I do not remember ever en- 
joying a more profitable spiritual 
feast than was given to us in the 



first day of this conference. If I 
had been privileged to talk to you 
during the last year as I have been 
talking to a few of the stakes of 
Zion, I would not undertake to 
speak as I desire to just now; be- 
cause I have been speaking upon 
this subject during the last year in 
some stakes, but I feel that my 
chosen text may be profitably pre- 
sented to you, as I believe it has 
been where I have labored latterly. 
I believe that I shall not live long 
enough to talk to you upon this sub- 
ject in your homes, stakes or wards, 
and hence I desire to take this op- 
portunity, although our time is so 
brief and I shall have to treat the 
subject briefly. I am pleased, how- 
ever, with this privilege to be heard 
by this vast congregation, and I 
trust that you shall all hear what I 
say and consider it critically and 
carefully. 

Ministers of the day, I believe, 
quite generally refer to the scrip- 
tures that have been handed down 
to us from the Apostle Paul, and I 
desire to take a text of his this 
morning and paraphrase it and give 
it a little extension — in fact, con- 
siderable extension, so that it may 
meet the necessities of all Latter- 
day Saints. Paul seems to have 
given it application to one impor- 
tant class of officials, that is to the 
Bishops, but I believe if he were 
here, and should discover that I had 
made an extended application of his 
injunctions to bishops, he would be 
satisfied with the application that I 
give to his words. I will read the 
text and refer to parts of it as I 



34 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



read. In his first letter to Timothy 
the third chapter, the first verse of 
that chapter, there is a text that is 
very familiar to the bishops, for we 
rarely ever ordain bishops but what 
we read this text to them, but I be- 
lieve it has not been usual for us to 
give the application to others so 
seriously and directly. Paul says, 
"This is a true saying, if a man de- 
sire the office of a bishop, he de- 
sireth a good work." I desire to 
say that if any man desires any 
office in this Church he desireth a 
good work, and yet I believe that 
no man in this Church should seek 
after either the office of a bishop or 
any other office, but yet should be 
ready and prepared to receive any- 
official responsibility which the Lord 
has to bestow upon him. "A bishop," 
then Paul says, "must be blameless." 
I say that any official member of 
this Church, as well as a bishop, 
should be blameless. "A bishop 
should be the husband of one wife ;" 
he should be a married man. I say 
that any man who holds office in 
this Church should be a married 
man, as soon as it is proper and 
right for him to marry. A bishop 
should be "vigilant," and so should 
every other official in this Church. A 
bishop should be "sober," Paul says ; 
I say every other official in this 
Church should be sober. "A bishop 
should be of good behavior," is 
Paul's declaration ; mine is, that 
every other official in this Church, 
bearing divine authority should 
be of good behavior. A bishop 
should be "given to hospital- 
ity," and so should every other 
man. Paul says a bishop should be 
"apt to teach." I hold that every 
man in this Church, bearing divine 
authority, should be apt to teach. I 
do not know that he has made, in 
these declarations of his, anything 



superior, or of greater importance 
for the salvation of men, than the 
fact that every official should be apt 
to teach; for it is a very great ac- 
complishment, an accomplishment 
that many, very many men have not 
yet attained to. A bishop should 
"not be given to wine," nor should 
any other man. 

I do not believe that Paul intend- 
ed in his injunctions to the bishops 
that every other man should be al- 
lowed to do otherwise ; I don't think 
he intended that ; he would not in- 
tend it if he were here today, and 
would approve of the suggestions 
that I make to you. "Not a striker ;" 
I hold that every other man as well 
as the bishops should be a man of 
peace. "Not greedy of filthy lucre ;" 
nor should any other man be greedy 
of filthy lucre; but if any man is 
entitled to, and should enjoy, and 
possess the lucre of this world, I 
think that bishops should be well 
supplied, that they may be hospit- 
able and minister to the necessities 
of the poor. "But patient." Bishops 
should be patient, Paul says ; I hold 
that every other man in this Church 
should be just as patient as a bishop. 
"Not a brawler nor covetous ;" 
neither should other men be toler- 
ated in these conditions. A bishop 
should be "One that ruleth well his 
own house ;',' so should every other 
man who stands at the head of a 
family. "Having his children in sub- 
jection with all gravity;" so with all 
the rest of the brethren. "For if a 
man" — now Paul comes to the com- 
mon ground that I have taken, that 
not only the bishop — "know not how 
to rule his own house, how shall he 
take care of the church of God?" 
"Not a novice ;" he should be a man 
of experience and understanding, of 
skill and judgment; so with every 
other man. Moreover, and in addi- 



PRESIDENT FRANCIS M. LYMAN.

tion to these injunctions already re- 
ferred to "He must have a good re- 
port of them which are without." 
I hold it is just as important, and 
necessary, that every other man who 
has office or position, or responsi- 
bility in this Church, should have a 
good report of those that are with- 
out as well as the bishop of a ward. 

Now that is the measure of the 
text that I have selected this morn- 
ing. I discover that in our days of 
worship, various occasions of wor- 
ship and serving the Lord, and par- 
taking of the sacrament, and of the 
proper time for us to remember our 
prayers before the Lord, an impor- 
tant percentage of the Latter-day 
Saints have not yet reached that 
success that should attend upon all 
members of this Church. The Lord 
anticipated, no doubt, in the revela- 
tions given to us in latter times that 
men would be faulty in regard to re- 
membering Him. He is jealous, for 
our good and our salvation, that we 
should remember Him, and honor 
Him, and keep His commandments, 
and He has laid down the rule that 
has been, I fear, seriously over- 
looked by our brethren who preside 
in our wards, the fact that "if any 
man observeth not his prayers be- 
fore the Lord in the season thereof, 
let him be had in remembrance be- 
fore the judge of my people." I 
say, also, extending this scripture a 
little to harmonize with the exten- 
sion I gave to that from Paul, that 
not only the man who neglects his 
prayers, in the season thereof, 
should be had in remembrance be- 
fore the judge of the people, but 
those who are not attentive to par- 
taking of the sacrament on the Sab- 
bath day, those who do not come to 
' the house of the Lord on the Sab- 
bath day, those who do not suitably 
rest as they should upon that day, 



and keep that day sacred and holy, 
should be had in remembrance be- 
fore the judge of the people. That, 
I believe, is the word and will of 
the Lord. 

Now, I am delighted because this 
congregation is so large, so many 
thousands here today, for you will 
return to your homes, to your own 
wards and stakes, and to your fam- 
ilies, and we like you to take to them 
what you have heard here, and what 
you shall yet hear before this con- 
ference closes, for it is very impor- 
tant that the word and will of the 
Lord should be known, should be 
appreciated and observed by the 
Latter-day Saints. For that we live ; 
for that we labor ; for that we have 
been brought together from the 
world ; for that we have been in- 
structed, and for that we have been 
inspired by the Spirit of the Lord, 
that we may labor for the salvation 
of man. So that every man who 
bears the priesthood has a mission 
and ministry, and it was not de- 
signed, it has' never been designed 
of the Lord that men should receive 
responsible positions in His Church, 
and then disregard them, give no 
thought or attention to them; but 
they are required to listen to the 
counsels and commandments of the 
Lord and to observe them most per- 
fectly. 

Now I desire to give the applica- 
tion of these requirements, so defin- 
ite to the bishops of wards, also to 
all my brethren who bear the priest- 
hood, from the deacon who has a 
ministry, who is a teacher in his life 
and labors, and required to be by 
revelation, and the teacher in the 
lesser priesthood, and the priest; 
these young men, as a rule, that are 
brought into the school so early, it 
is intended that they should have 
primary training and teaching, so 



36 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



that when they are ordained to the 
Melchizedek priesthood they will be 
prepared for the foreign ministry, 
or the extensive ministry of the holy 
Melchizedek priesthood. They are 
expected to receive home training 
under the direction of their bishops ; 
and as we are very careful, you will 
notice in the theory of the Church, 
the practice of the Church, that 
whenever a president is wanted it is 
because there is a labor for him. 
When counselors are wanted in 
presidencies and in bishoprics, and 
in high councils, there is always a 
ministry for every man who is or- 
dained and blest. When a man is 
called to go out into the field, into 
the world, to preach the Gospel 
there, to preside or otherwise, he 
goes because there is a ministry for 
him to perform. We never ordain 
a bishop, we never ordain a patri- 
arch, we never ordain a man to any 
office in this priesthood, or give him 
a responsible position of presidency 
or superintendency but what there is 
a field of labor for him. No man is 
endowed with divine authority until 
there is something for him to do. 
Now we desire to draw attention of 
the bishops, and of presidents of 
stakes and quorums, and superinten- 
dents of associations and organiza- 
tions among the brethren, that 
whenever this ministry comes to 
them it is expected that they will 
commence their labor that day. It 
has been so with us who 'have more 
responsible positions. When the 
Lord has called us — and He has no 
more definitely, and positively, and 
properly called the president who 
presides over us in this Church, than 
He has called -the deacon; deacons 
are called of God, and the teachers 
and priests, as well as the presiding 
brethren ; and every elder, every 
seventy, every high-priest, and the 



brethren who preside over them, are 
responsible to employ, to instruct 
and lead those brethren in the ways 
of righteousness and truth. 

Now what I have said in regard 
to my brethren I desire now to give 
application to our sisters also, and 
all members of this Church ; .: for 
when a man is converted, if he be 
not called to bear divine authority 
of the priesthood, if he comes into 
this fold and is converted, it is his 
duty to convert his brother ; and 
that is just as true with the sisters 
as with the brethren. This minis- 
try can not be perfectly and prop- 
erly accomplished until the breth- 
ren and sisters devote themselves 
to the conversion of their neigh- 
bors — the husband to convert the 
wife ; the wife to convert the hus- 
band, the brother to help his broth- 
er, and the sister to help her sister, 
until every man and woman is em- 
plojyed and occupied, and is ac- 
complishing something in the minis- 
try, every day. 

If a bishop should be the husband 
of one wife and every other man 
should be a married man, I hold 
that every woman should be the 
wife of one husband, that not a 
woman in this Church should be 
without marriage in due time, just 
as men should pray in the season 
thereof, just as men should partake 
of the sacrament in the season there- 
of. Men and women should be mar- 
ried, suitably married, properly 
and eternally married, and so re- 
main. So that we desire to draw 
the attention of our sisters, as well 
as our brethren to the fact that they 
are expected, it is designed by the 
Lord, that they should be the edu- 
cators and trainers as well as the 
mothers of men. I was going to 
say, women are the better, finer and 
more desirable part of man, but men 



PRESIDENT FRANCIS M. LYMAN. 



37 



should be pure and clean in their 
lives, for their virtue is just as im- 
portant as that of women, and they 
are just as desirable and should 
lead the weaker sex. They should 
be the leaders, but in some instances 
wives are stronger in the faith, 
stronger in spirituality and in the 
gifts "and graces of the Lord than 
men, and much is required of them. 

I desire to direct the attention of 
presiding brethren — they are before 
me here ; I don't know when I will 
have an oportunity of seeing so 
many of them gathered together at 
one time. It is an important re- 
sponsibility resting upon these pre- 
siding men that they should look 
after the brethren and sisters who 
are at large, and who are not fre- 
quently gathered together, that do 
not gather, as they should do, to 
partake of the sacrament, and who 
are not attentive as they should be 
in regard to their prayers and obli- 
gations, family prayers and secret 
prayers and the like. I desire to 
impress upon every bishop, that it is 
his duty, that it is his business to 
know every man in his ward, every 
family, and have them under his 
direction, through the teachers that 
assist him. All men are teachers 
who bear the priesthood, even the 
office of a deacon is that of a 
teacher, that is his responsibility and 
labor as the Lord has laid it down ; 
when occasion requires deacons 
should assist the teachers. I inter- 
pret, that the occasion always re- 
quires that the deacon should help 
the teacher, that the teacher should 
help the priest, that the priest should 
help the elder, and occasion always 
requires that the elder should help 
the seventy, and the seventy the 
high priest, and so forth, from the 
junior to the senior we should help 
each other. Then I say that our 



sisters in their calling, and those 
who preside particularly, should see 
to it that they have in hand the work 
that belongs to them, that belongs 
to the Relief Society, to the Young 
Ladies' Association and the Primary 
Association, and those who have 
care of religion class labor. These 
women should have in hand the or- 
ganizations that are in their care 
and under their supervision, until 
there shall be an awakening among 
the Latter-day Saints to the outer 
edges, to those that are scattered 
and far away, and that are sickly 
also. They are to be visited, those 
that are sick physically; those that 
are sick spiritually need the physi- 
cian and should have attention. Our 
young people should be taken care 
of, they should be thoroughly in- 
structed ; every boy should be in- 
structed at the suitable age in his 
life ; every daughter should be suit- 
ably instructed by her mother, and 
thoroughly trained. Our young 
people who are contemplating mar- 
riage should be united for time and 
for eternity, as the rule. There 
are exceptions, and the exceptions 
are those who are not quite worthy, 
or are not prepared and not ready 
for marriage for eternity, who 
haven't made themselves worthy. 
I suppose there will always be the 
unworthy amongst us; but those 
that are worthy and prepared 
should be so suitably instructed that 
they would never think of marriage 
except for eternity, which embraces 
time, but not be satisfied with time 
marriages alone. 

O what splendid instructions we 
had yesterday from the President, 
and from the brethren who followed 
him during the day — a most glori- 
ous time. Now, as I give this ap- 
plication of these matters to our 
presiding brethren and to our pre- 



38 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



siding sisters, I desire to exhort 
them that they shall not be satisfied 
and content until they have all in 
their charge, in training, and in care 
and consideration, as carefully as 
have the brethren who imediately 
preside over us. Where we are 
laboring we always furnish employ- 
ment ; the presidency furnish em- 
ployment to the Twelve ; the 
Twelve and presidency are furnish- 
ing employment to those who pre- 
side over the stakes of Zion. We 
want the presidents of stakes to 
hold their bishops responsible, we 
want them to hold the presidents of 
the priesthood, the presidents of 
Seventies and of Elders responsible 
to know that the brethren in their 
care are properly trained and pre- 
pared, so when they are needed in 
the ministry, either to travel and 
preach the Gospel or to labor and 
minister at home, that they are in 
proper condition, I believe that we 
have not enjoined, quite so strongly 
as we should, this responsibility 
which rests upon those who preside. 

I have only a small company of 
men over which I preside, the 
Twelve, but we are in good fellow- 
ship and we give attention to each 
other we counsel together, fre- 
quently, and we know each other 
and know our lives. The life of 
every man should be known who 
bears divine authority in this 
Church. If there are some who 
have not received the priesthood, all 
such should have careful attention 
from brethren who labor among 
them, who do bear the priesthood, 
until every soul shall be thoroughly 
instructed. Bishops will be held re- 
sponsible, just as I feel that I am 
held responsible, and my brethren 
are held responsible to give atten- 
tion to the affairs of the Church 
and kingdom throughout the earth. 



Where there are missionaries 
needed, they go out from under our 
hands with our blessing, and with 
instruction, and we train them as 
well as we have opportunity to do. 
Our Council is not large ; we have 
one of our number in Europe, and 
one in congress, and there is al- 
ways one or two sick and afflicted. 
We have our troubles the same as 
other men ; so that there is just 
about a majority of the Twelve that 
are at liberty to take care of the 
kingdom, under the direction of the 
presidency. We are solicitous and 
anxious, and when we come to your 
stakes you know that we labor with 
you, we consider your conditions 
and circumstances and inquire after 
you. We have not been indifferent, 
you know we respond to your neces- 
sities and requirements, and if there 
is anything to be set in order and 
regulated we are always on hand to 
do it. We want you to do the same 
among the people where you are ; 
we want you to take care of your 
quorums and train them, and in- 
struct them, and prepare them so 
that whenever they are wanted in 
the ministry, young men or others, 
that they are ready for this im- 
portant labor. The welfare of this 
Church rests upon your shoulders 
as well as ours ; you must labor with 
us in detail, and give attention ; and 
the honor, the credit and glory will 
be just as great for you as for us. 
Your souls are just as precious as 
ours, and the souls of our brethren 
just as precious as ever souls have 
been in this world, and we want to 
take care of them and look after 
them. 

Very much depends upon our 
sisters ; we want their care, their 
help and their attention. We need 
their sympathy, their love and af- 
fection : and we want them to. assist 



PRESIDENT FRANCIS M. LYMAN.

and help us here, and we want to 
help them. We will not be satis- 
fied until Israel is trained, and they 
all come together to worship the 
Lord, until there is not room for 
them in our houses of worship, and 
meetings upon the earth outside 
will also be necessary. In the days 
of the Savior, among the Nephites, 
He commanded that they should be 
seated upon the earth in order to 
partake of the sacrament ; and when 
they were called together in great 
companies, too large for one apostle 
to stand up and speak to them, 
they were divided. We have to 
divide the people here today; and 
the time may come — how delighted 
I would be to see the time — when 
the Latter-day Saints will gather 
here in such numbers that not only 
this house and assembly hall will 
fail to accomodate them, but that the 
grounds all about here would be 
necessary for the apostles and others 
to administer among them. The 
sacrament of the Lord might be 
given to them, the emblems of the 
body and blood of our Lord, Jesus 
Christ, who has redeemed us, and 
by whom we are. The very earth 
upon which we live, which we oc- 
cupy here is His. In honor of Him, 
and in remembrance of His suffer- 
ings, and His body and blood, and 
the redemption that has been 
wrought out for us, we need to 
partake of the sacrament. 

I pray the Lord to bless us, my 
brethren and sisters. I thank the 
Lord that we are alive. I want to 
live for a long time, and I want you 
to live, but I think every man should 
do his duty so that he is always pre- 
pared to die — let death come when- 
ever it pleases. Whenever the time 
comes and our work is finished, 
thank God that we are prepared and 
have done our duty faithfully and 



well. I make this exhortation and 
counsel and instruction to Israel 
gathered here today. Take these 
things to your homes and administer 
to the people there that can not 
come, that never do come. The 
people that are here today are the 
people that are always here, every 
time. This same bod}' of the priest- 
hood, and the presiding brethren 
right here before me, are the ones 
that were here six months ago ; they 
will be here next April, also, and so 
on ; and the body of the house is 
filled with the very same people, as 
a rule, with a little variation. But 
the great majority of the people are 
at home, and must be at home ; they 
can not come here ; so we go to them 
and administer among them as best 
we can, as opportunity offers. We 
find that the time is short, our time 
for speaking and exhortation and 
counsel is quite short, and, of course, 
a few brethren like the presidency 
or the Twelve here can only ad- 
minister publicly. We can not ad- 
minister in the homes of the people ; 
the people are too numerous; and 
you must labor and perform the 
work in detail; for they can be 
reached by the bishops and their 
assistants — this splendid organiza- 
tion that has placed almost every 
man in the Church in a responsible 
position, so that every man bearing 
the priesthood has a ministry that 
should be magnified and honored 
every day of our lives. It is a 
reproach to a man to lie down at 
night if he can not look back over 
the clay and think of some good 
thing- accomplished, some young 
man instructed, some neighbor 
trained, helped and encouraged, and 
strengthened in his faith. Every 
man should do that, and when it is 
done the Saints of this Church will 
be instructed ; they will be exhorted ; 



40 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



they will be restrained and they will 
be encouraged, and every blessing 
that they require will be adminis- 
tered unto them. God bless you, my 
brethren and my sisters throughout 
Israel. That Israel may triumph 
and prosper gloriously in the earth, 
I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen.

ELDER CHARLES H. HART. 

(Of the First Council of Seventy.) 
After listening with you to the 
splendid talks of the brethren yes- 
terday and today, giving compre- 
hensive reviews of Gospel principles, 
I feel very much in need of the sus- 
taining power of the Lord to prop- 
erly direct your thoughts during the 
time that I may stand before you. 
As suggested by President Lyman, 
we have before us many of the same 
faces, brethren and sisters who meet 
here at these half yearly . confer- 
ences. We miss some of them, how- 
ever. 

For my part, I have not yet be- 
come accustomed to the absence 
from this upper stand of President 
Winder, President John Henry 
Smith, and Patriarch John Smith; 
and I miss, from these missionary 
seats, President Ben E. Rich, that 
valiant preacher of the Gospel who, 
I believe, would have passed through 
the hardships of an Apostle Paul if 
necessary to perform his duty as a 
preacher of righteousness. I miss 
also from the seats of the presidents 
of stakes, President George Os- 
mond, who served many years as a 
bishop, a faithful bishop, having the 
qualifications that the Apostle Paul 



would have a bishop to possess, who 
labored many years as an efficient 
counselor to President Budge of the 
Bear Lake stake, and who after- 
wards served as the President of the 
Star Valley stake. I make this ref- 
erence because none of the general 
authorities of the Church were priv- 
ileged to attend the funeral of this 
faithful worker in the Church, and 
testify of their appreciation of the 
noble work that he performed, such 
service as hundreds of these breth- 
ren whom I face this morning are 
now performing in the Church. 

We meet beneath the shelter of 
this dome twice a year, under vary- 
ing circumstances ; in April we meet 
about the seed-time, men hopeful as 
to what the result will be of their 
planting, hopeful, at the same time 
anxious. At this season of the year 
we might almost celebrate the har- 
vest-home. I contrasted, the other 
day, at those splendid exercises in 
dedication of the seagull monument, 
the meager life-saving harvest of 
1848, with the rich harvests of 1913, 
and thought of how the capacious 
elevators, and the large and well 
filled grain bins have taken the place 
of the partly filled meal sack of 
those early pioneer days. Well may 
we sing, as did our sister so beauti- 
fully a moment ago. of the labor of 
the great pioneer. As he looked out 
over this valley, with the vision of 
inspiration, it required no report of 
an agricultural college to determine 
whether or not this land would pro- 
duce crops to sustain the people ; he 
was prepared to realize that a new 
system of agriculture among the 
Anglo-Saxon race, namely, that by 
irrigation, could be successfully in- 
augurated here, and later he had a 
further vision of the possibilities of 
this land. McDonald, the agron- 
omist of the Transvaal for the Brit-

ish nation, in his book on dry farm- 
ing, properly gives President Brig- 
ham Young credit for foreseeing the 
day when our bench land, above the 
irrigation ditches, should be almost 
as valuable as our irrigated land. 
Little did the brethren — unless they 
had the same prophetic foresight as 
their leaders — realize the fortunes 
that were being divided to them 
when an acre of ground in this city, 
and a ten-acre or twenty-acre lot 
outlying a short distance, were par- 
celed out to them. They little 
dreamed that, within the life-time of 
many of those who then lived, that 
these possessions would be worth a 
small fortune. Our ideas of the 
richness and value of these mountain 
valleys increase year by year. High 
as our standard may be one year, we 
realize that the fertility of mountain 
and meadow, of the plain and of the 
bench land, is even more valuable 
than we supposed they were and 
contain greater possibilities for 
wealth producing. 

We are indeed a blest people, liv- 
ing under the protection of this 
great republic, the inauguration of 
which has been properly said to be 
the greatest single achievement of 
the eighteenth century. When we 
contrast our happy lot with that of 
our unfortunate brethren in Mexico, 
torn and bleeding Mexico, we can 
understand the great blessing it is 
to live under the protection of a 
great government which secures us 
"life, liberty and the pursuit of hap- 
piness" day and night, whether we 
realize that this protecting power is 
thus about us or not. We are for- 
tunate also in having abiding places 
in these splendid commonwealths in 
the Rocky Mountains, which also 
give us a large measure of security, 
and protection which conduces to 
prosperity and happiness. 



We are greatly privileged, also, in 
living at a time when divine truth 
has been restored, and when divine 
authority has been again committed 
to man. We are trying to accom- 
plish a work among the people, with 
this splendid organization that has 
been given unto us by inspiration in 
this age. We are trying to accom- 
plish an important mission among 
mankind. It is true our labors are 
not understood. Some of the world 
realize something of the potency, 
for either good or evil, of this great 
and perfect organization, and they 
speak of it as the "oncoming giant," 
and they think that it should be 
crushed, because they know not that 
its fruits are good ; but occasionally 
there are those who realize the im- 
portant mission that this Church is 
performing. The late poet of the 
Sierras, Joaquin Miller, realized 
this when he gave through the moth- 
ers of "Mormonism," that splendid 
tribute to "Mormonism." With 
your indulgence I will read a part 
of his words. His lines were sug- 
gested by the welcome that the 
mothers here gave to the President 
of the United States upon his visit 
to Salt Lake City, in appearing at 
his public reception with their babes 
in their arms : 

A ROUNDELAY OF SALT LAKE. 

Beneath our forty stars is she 
The purest woman, sweetest, best, 
Who loves her spouse most ardently 
And rocks the cradle, oftenest; 
Whose home is filled, whose heart is 
fed 

With halo of a baby's head. ' 

How pitiful that we must pay 
And pension man for killing man, 
While woman brings forth as she may, 
Unpaid, unpensioned, as she can; 
Gives life while man takes life away. 

Gives life, gives love because she must, 
How sad that we must pension, pay 



42 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Our tallest, bravest and our best 
For killing brave men, east or west, 
Until our race is in the dust, 
As Greece is in the dust today; 
A tomb of glory gone away. 

I say the mothers of strong men, 
Strong men and merry men and tall, 
Must build, must man the Spartan wall 
And keep it stoutly manned as when 
Greece won the world, nor wrecked at 
all. 

I say that she must man the wall. 
The wall of breasts, unshielded, bare, 
The wall to do, the wall to dare, 
The wall of man, or we must fall. 
I say that she, strong-limbed and fair 
Deserves the pay, the pension, care. 

Of all brave, heartfelt welcomes found 
Where flowers strew the fragrant 
ground 

And rainbow banners fret the air 
By city, hamlet, anywhere, 
In Midland, Southland, Northland, 
West', 

I reckon Utah's first and best. 

Not guns to greet the nation's chief, 
Not trumpets blaring to the sun, 
Not scars of glory and of grief, 
Not thrice told tales of battles fought, 
Not seas of flowers at his feet, 
Not bold to glitter and to greet, 
But Utah brought her babes, and 
brought 

Not one babe fretted or afraid. 
Not one that cried or wailed, not one. 
Oh, what to this the booming gun? 
Oh, what to this the loud parade? 
Proud troop to troop poured manifold 
In battle banners rampt with gold? 

Just babies, babies, healthful, fair 
From where the Wasatch lion leaps, 
From sunless snows, from desert deeps. 
Just babies, babies, everywhere; 
just babes in arms, at mother's breasts, 
And robust boys with girls at play, 
With pounding fists, too full to rest; 
As chubby, fat, as fair as they. 

Behold yon seas of alkali 
Of sand, of salt, of dried up seas, 
Then sheltered by these watered trees 
And humbly dare to question why 
These countless babes, these mothers, 
aye, 

The maid in love, the lad at play, 

All seem so gladsome, bright and gay? 



Who tented here, who brake the sod. 
Subdued the Artemisia's strength 
With patient Ruth at ready call? 
Who faced the red man at arm's length 
And she beside him first to fall, 
And while he prayed the living God 
Who gat such babes as never man 
Had looked upon since time began? 
And why? Because the loving sire 
Loved life and hated low desire; 
He loved his babes, he loved his kind 
By desert waste of mountain wind; 
He watched his happy babes at play 
The while he gloried, glad as they. 

This John the Baptist, naked, lean,' 
Lorn, crying in the wilderness, 
This half fanatic, Luther, Huss, 
Whom we once mocked in his distress, 
Stands better than the best of us; 
Stands nearer Jesus, God, because 
He loves his babes, obeys His laws — 
Because his hands, his feet are clean; 
Because he loves his hearth, his home, 
And patient heaps the honey comb. 

Behold yon million desert miles 
With scarce a plow, with scant a tree, 
Save where this desert garden smiles 
And robust babes leap merrily; 
Behold our boundless seas, as chare 
Of sails as yonder peaks are bare! 

Then give us babes, babes of our own, 
My meddling, congressmen and men 
Of cloth, with great brains in the chin; 
Glad babes like these to plow the seas. 
Strong babes like these to plow or 
spin, 

And let this Bedouin alone 
Yea, give us babes at home, where now 
Ye hide and house on every street 
Such things as 'twere a shame to 
meet — 

Glad babes to build and guide the 
prow, 

Possess the isles, protect and bear 
The star-built banner here or there! 
Till then, hands off, my Pharisee, 
And tend your own affairs, as they, 
Of Utah tend their own today, 
Lest from the mouths of babes ye be 
Condemned and damned eternally! 

This condition could not have 
been brought about if our mothers 
had thought more of aping the fash- 
ions imported from decadent France

than they thought of home-building 
and of child-bearing. 

It was a very timely rebuke that 
was given by our President yester- 
day and I thought is it possible that 
any complaint will be made, as was 
suggested, at his stand upon this im- 
portant subject? Yet J remember 
that all those who stand for impor- 
tant reforms in the world have to 
bear the criticism of the world. If 
a high official has the courage to 
omit the wine-cup from his banquet, 
setting a great precedent in favor of 
temperance, there will not be want- 
ing the thoughtless ones who will 
criticize him for this act of courage 
and of reform. So men may expect, 
when they set their faces like flint 
against the evils of the world, to 
have some criticism directed to- 
wards them. We are not ashamed 
of this work that we are seeking to 
perform, such work as indicated in 
the splendid review of the organiza- 
tion, and of the work and labors ex- 
pected of the brethren, just given 
us by President Lyman. We are 
seeking to develop men and women 
who will be an honor, not only to the 
Church, but to the nation ; strong 
men and women, strong in their in- 
tegrity, strong in their love of truth 
and of righteousness and of virtue. 

Mark Twain, the humorist and 
philosopher, realized the dangers 
that Were warned against yesterday 
when he said : 'When one thinks of 
the tremendous forces of the upper 
and the nether world which play for 
the mastery of the soul of a woman 
during the few years in which she 
passes from plastic girlhood to the 
ripe maturity of womanhood, we 
may well stand in awe before the 
momentous drama ! What capacities 
she has of purity, tenderness, good- 
ness ; what capacities of vileness, bit- 
terness, and evil. Nature must needs 



be lavish with the mother and crea- 
tor of men and center in her all the 
possibilities of life. And a few crit- 
ical years can decide whether her 
life is to be full of sweetness and 
light, whether she is to be the vestal 
of a holy temple, or whether she will 
be the fallen priestess of a dese- 
crated shrine." We would have all 
our young girls to garnish their 
thoughts and their lives with virtue, 
casting a glorious halo and light 
about them, just as the electric 
lamps from the beehive upon the 
Hotel Utah cast a soft, brilliant 
glory upon the Temple of our God. 
We would have our young people 
know that sin is the barbed wire that 
cuts and scars, and sometimes leaves 
the poison of its rust within the 
wound, to destroy the body and to 
contaminate the soul, and we would 
safeguard them from all these dan- 
gers and evils that threaten them. 

May the Lord bless us in this 
work of conserving the youth of 
Zion, and of training them up so 
that they shall .be men and women of 
whom the Church and our nation 
may be justly proud, I pray in the 
name of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER LEVI EDGAR YOUNG. 

(Of the First Council of Seventy.) 

I sincerly hope that our hearts 
will remain in tune with the Lord 
and His work during the sessions 
of this conference, for we have cer- 
tainly enjoyed the Spirit of God up 
to this moment. In standing be- 
fore you I want your faith and 
prayers that something may be said- 
on this occasion and at this moment 
that will help each and every one of 
us. 

I am proud of the majesty of this 
people. I am proud of their 



44 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



achievements. I am proud of the 
great expression that has been made 
during the last hundred years, of the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ in the hearts 
of men and women. Not long ago 
in taking a small crowd of strangers 
through this building and around 
these grounds, a man turned to me 
and said: "You seem to have a 
pride in the work of your people, 
and what they are doing today," and 
my answer was that if I haven't 
a pride then it is because my soul 
cannot rise to the majesty of their 
work. This people have done a 
great work, but we are just begin- 
ning and the glory of it all is, that 
in this beginning we are in the im- 
perfect stage, but going on to per- 
fection with the Gospel of Jesus 
Christ to direct us. One of the most 
glorious essays that I have read is a 
little book put out by a professor at 
Harvard College entitled, "The 
Glory of the Imperfect," wherein he 
goes to show that through our ig- 
norance of the laws of nature and 
the divine spark of man, because of 
the sin of the human race, we are 
living in imperfect days when it 
comes to life and action. We do not 
understand the great laws that gov- 
ern this earth and the universe. The 
glory of it all is for each person to 
work in life, to take hold of life, 
and though he sees the imperfec- 
tions of the children of the Great 
Creator, he stands as one loving life, 
and nature and working at the im- 
perfect to make it perfect, whereby 
he shall realize his divinity and be- 
come likened unto a God. This is, 
in substance Mormonism or the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ. There have 
been writers of late who have won- 
dered why the "Mormon" people 
were not lead to the Pacific Coast, 
either to California or to Oregon. 



There are many reasons why those 
countries would have been better 
places to build and yet there is a 
glory in knowing that after all the 
arid lands of the world have pro- 
duced the greatest civilizations both 
anciently and in modern times. A 
recent economic critic in the At- 
lantic Monthly declares that the peo- 
ple who plant settlements and main- 
tain small towns where all the peo- 
ple take part in civic and religious 
lives are placing the highest and 
best and broadest foundation for the 
development of modern civilization 
and culture. 

The settlements, that were devel- 
oped in this arid west in the early 
days are a lesson to the world in 
civic life, and here was planted the 
old Teutonic township form of gov- 
ernment, the finest type of democ- 
racy on the face of the globe; and 
according to Charles Gross of Har- 
vard University, the one place out- 
side of New England where there 
has been developed a civic life that 
is the equal of any other place in 
the world's history. I want to say 
here that in Utah was developed a 
democracy even greater than the 
democracy in New England, "be- 
cause in our town mettings, in our 
civic centers, not only were the men 
permitted to take part and to vote 
on the great questions of life, but 
the women were given that privilege 
as well, which is an announcement 
to the world that we absolutely be- 
lieve in equality and the right of the 
woman to take her part in the great 
civic life of humanity. Our history, 
my brethren and sisters, is not a 
chronological history ; it is a history 
of great expressions of the Gospel 
of Jesus Christ. It has expressed 
itself in great economic civic, intel- 
lectual, social and ethical institu- 



ELDER LEVI EDGAR YOUNG. 



45 



tions and these are what we should 
study and learn and love and abide 
by, just as the Book of Mormon 
itself becomes a book of majesty 
and repute, because of its descrip- 
tion and maintenance of the great 
Semitic institutions of ancient times. 
Over a hundred years ago when 
Benjamin Franklin was at the court 
of England he was asked by one of 
the parliamentarians why the Amer- 
ican people were giving to the world 
the great expression that all men are 
created equal and are endowed with 
rights and privileges that are sacred, 
the rights and privileges to live and 
to live before the law, both of God 
and of man. He answered it in a 
very eloquent manner when he said 
that "the reason why we announce 
that, as a people is because it is the 
new light that has come to a new 
land." In the 28th chapter of the 
Book of Alma we have there poss- 
ibly one of the greatest statements 
in all literature and history why the 
race has become unequal, why there 
is an inequality among men. The 
Prophet Alma says it is because men 
have sinned and iniquity has come 
because of the different degrees of 
sins. Equality will come when we 
abide by the laws of righteousness 
and truth. The Book of Mormon 
becomes then a great work for us 
to study for its institutional history. 
In the Book of Mosiah, again, we 
find some of the most splendid ex- 
amples in the history of the old 
Semitic townships, and Hebrew 
townships, which were pure democ- 
racies. We find in the book of Alma 
examples of economic thrift which 
a modern man at the university of 
Berlin has declared to be fundamen- 
tally the broadest conception of eco- 
nomic activity known to the world's 
history. We have then muCh, we 



have done much, we have accomp- 
lished much and we have served 
a notice upon the world that we 
stand above all for Christ and Him 
crucified; and if I were asked to- 
day what I should like to see more 
than anything else it would be to 
have Christ in our homes more and 
more and to know the Messiah, to 
understand Him, why He gave His 
blood for the redemption of the 
world. I wish that in every home 
in Zion the name of the Savior 
would be used sacredly every day, 
and that if you and I were asked 
who it is that we hold up as greater 
than anyone else our reply would be 
Jesus the Christ, whom we love, 
whom we worship and whom we 
obey. The world needs Christ more 
than ever. If ever in the past it has 
needed Him, very well and good ; 
but certainly Christ and Him cruci- 
fied is needed today more than ever. 

And I want to say here in passing 
another point, a reference to the 
early history of this state. Some 
have said that we are growing in 
knowledge and in power ; I grant 
that. It is true. In many ways 
we are growing in knowledge and in 
power, but when it comes to culture, 
when it comes to morality, when it 
comes to faith, sublime faith in God. 
the highest form of culture, we are 
far behind our fathers and mothers. 
There was a stamp of culture in the 
early days of this state that was 
magnificient, where women were 
really stylish in the true sense of 
the term, artistic, because they 
dressed in accordance with the 
cleanliness of their honest souls, 
where they never knew debt, where 
they worked and had faith, and 
their dress became in a sense an ex- 
pression of that work and faith. 
There was a culture in the dance

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



and in the theatre, and Mr. M. B. 
Leavitt, the historian of the Amer- 
ican Theatre, and the oldest man- 
ager today in America, says in his 
late book that of all people in the 
world who have held the theatre, 
the drama on a high plane and kept 
up the highest standard of dramatic 
appreciation, it is the "Mormon" 
people living in the Rocky Moun- 
tains. He obtained this idea from 
a study of the early ideals of this 
people toward literature and the 
drama, history and art. We have 
much to learn, but we have done a 
great work. It is for us to know it 
and keep it in mind, and I want to 
say that for one I appreciate the 
culture that has been in this state 
among our fathers and our moth- 
ers, the cleanliness and the purity 
of the lives of the Pioneers of this 
state; for they were a great people, 
and you women, you sisters, played 
your part gloriously in the develop- 
ment of this work. 

Mr. Claxton, the United States 
commissioner of education spoke 
here last July, and in his magnifi- 
cent address, he told the assemblage 
of teachers in this Tabernacle, that 
the poet Goethe in "Faust" gives us 
the ideal of education when he said 
every man should become a worker 
for the light and every child should 
be taught that his soul is divine be- 
fore his God, and it is for him to 
work out his salvation before his 
maker; and he quoted from "Faust"" 
those words where he ^ays "there 
are two forces contending for the 
control of my * soul — light and 
darkness." Then Faust says, "I 
shall, through the will that God 
gave me, overcome wrong, seek the 
light and find the giver of life." Mr. 
Claxton said that when we teach 
our children that this is the funda- 



mental of religion and education, 
then shall we have partly solved 
our problems. 

I wish to say in conclusion that 
this is the idea of the Gospel of 
Jesus Christ ; that is gloriously oui 
dream, our ideal, that every human 
being is a child of the living God, 
and when he is touched with the 
knowledge of his divinity he shall 
go on to perfection, salvation by 
obedience to the laws of God, and 
an understanding of the laws of 
nature. May the Lord help us to 
see these great truths, to under- 
stand them, to put them into life. 
There is a majesty to our history, 
there is a majesty to this people, 
and a pride. We have the right to 
lift up our eyes and be proud — not 
proud in pride, but proud in humil- 
ity, proud that God has given us a 
knowledge of the Gospel, proud 
that we are becoming ministers for 
the Most High in the Gospel of 
Jesus Christ, living with our heads 
up, with our eyes toward God, al- 
ways with the knowledge that we 
are the servants of the Lord Jesus 
Christ, to administer in His holy 
ordinances for the salvation of the 
human race. May the Lord help 
us to see these things and sense 
them keenly and put them into 
practice, and to have a pride in our 
people, in our history, and above 
all a pride in and a love for God, 
I ask it in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen.

OVERFLOW MEETING. 

An overflow session of the Con- 
ference was held in the Assembly 
Hall, adjoining the Tabernacle, at 
10 a. m., Sunday, October 5th, 1913. 
The services were presided over by 
Elder Rudger Clawson. 

The Forest Dale ward choir fur- 
nished the musical service. 

The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn : 

Redeemer of Israel, our only delight, 

On whom for a blessing we call, 
Our shadow by day, and our pillar by 
night, 

Our King, our Deliv'rer, our all! 

Prayer was offered by Elder Ed- 
ward H. Anderson. 

The choir sang the anthem, 
"Praise ye the Father." 

ELDER REY L. PRATT. 

(President of Mexican Mission.) 

I desire very greatly, my brethren 
and sisters, to have the Spirit of the 
Lord direct me in the few remarks 
that I shall make this morning, and 
I crave an interest in your faith and 
prayers in my behalf, that the Lord 
will assist me to say only those 
things that He desires I should say. 

I have had some experience in 
the missionary field, and I have 
learned the great lesson that a man 
must have the Spirit of the Lord to 
teach the people the things of the 
Lord, just as much as a man "must 
have the Spirit of God to under- 
stand the things of God." I re- 
member reading, in the Book of 
Mormon, the words that Nephi re- 
corded in regard to that occasion 
when his father told him to return to 
Jerusalem and to bring with him the 
brass plates upon which were en- 



graven the genealogy of his father 
Lehi, and of that branch of the 
family back to the first generation; 
and his father said that his elder 
brothers rebelled and murmured, 
and did not wish to go back. But 
Nephi said that he would do as he 
was commanded, for, said he, "I 
know that the Lord giveth no com- 
mandments unto the children of 
men, save he shall prepare a way 
for them that they may accomplish 
the thing which he commandeth 
them." And I, in that same faith, 
am standing before you this morn- 
ing. Provided I am humble, I be- 
lieve that the Lord will give me 
words to express my feelings in a 
manner that you can understand, 
and perhaps beneficially, because the 
Lord does not make mistakes, and 
when He calls upon His servants to 
perform any duty, and they do it 
in humility, He opens the way be- 
fore them that they may accomplish- 
that which He desires. 

As Brother Clawson has told you, 
I have labored in the Mexican mis- 
sion, and I have the spirit of that 
mission running through my veins 
to such an extent that it is almost 
impossible for me to talk to the peo- 
ple here, except I speak in regard 
to the Mexican mission. I trust that 
you will bear with me if I call your 
attention to something that is being 
done in that mission, among the 
seed of Lehi, those that we declare 
are Lamanites. We have been en- 
gaged in missionary work there for 
ten or twelve years, and the work is 
increasing and spreading in a mar- 
velous manner, in spite of the ad- 
verse conditions that exist in that 
country. We have on our record 
books something over 1600 names, 
of that number the great majority 
are true and faithful members of 
the Church. The Gospel of Jesus 



48 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Christ is doing for them just what it 
is doing for any other people who 
have accepted the Gospel of Christ, 
in the true spirit of it. Our work at 
the present time is such that, al- 
though the condition of the coun- 
try is such that it would seem al- 
most impossible to do missionary 
work there, we have never had a 
more successful year than the pres- 
ent. We have baptized already, this 
year, sixty-five souls, and they will 
compare favorably with any Saints 
that embrace the Gospel in any land. 
As I said before, the Gospel is do- 
ing for them just what it is doing 
for any other people that accept the 
Gospel, and live its principles. 

I wish to call your attention to 
conditions that exist at the present 
time in Mexico, and to the proph- 
ecies the Lord has made with ref- 
erence to that people, and to show 
you, if possible, wherein those 
prophecies are being fulfilled now. 
I call your attention to that part of 
the record which has not yet been 
fulfilled, and which is of definite 
importance to all who believe in 
the Book of Mormon. The Laman- 
ites are not only the Indians who 
live in the United States of Amer- 
ica, and in Canada, but the Laman- 
ite people extend from Alaska to 
Patagonia. They are the descend- 
ants of father Lehi, and his rebel- 
lious sons that turned away from 
the truth, and incurred the curse 
of God and became what they are, 
the native races that exist, as I 
said, from Patagonia on the south 
to Alaska on the north- They are 
all Lamanites, and the Lord proph- 
esied in regard to them, and told 
them what would be the consequen- 
ces of their sins, that this curse 
would come upon them. Nephi de- 
picts it very truthfully when he 
says he saw them divided up into 



many tribes and nations, and that 
they would war among one another. 
And he also saw that the Gentile 
nations would be brought in among 
them and would be given power 
over them, even to the extent of re- 
ducing them to a remnant, and he 
said that they would become a hiss 
and a by-word, and they would be 
trampled upon by the Gentile na- 
tions that came among them. That 
has verily been the case. Time is 
not sufficient, this morning, to go 
into a detailed description of all that 
has befallen the Lamanite races of 
America; it is sufficient to say that 
the Gentiles did go into Mexico, 
particularly, and did there crush the 
Lamanites, and have brought them 
down even to a remnant, fulfilling 
the prophecies the Lord made in re- 
gard to that people. From the time 
of the Spanish conquerers, who 
were Gentiles of the Latin race, 
who conquered Mexico, Central 
America, and Peru, and the rest of 
the native races that existed at that 
time, in South America, there are 
only one-tenth in existence in those 
countries at the present time. If 
you could read the history of the 
conquest of Mexico, of Guatemala, 
of Peru, and see the way that those 
people were reduced at the hands of 
the Gentiles, if you could read the 
history of the reign of the Gentile 
nations over them for more than 
four hundred years, and see where 
they have been exterminated, com- 
paratively speaking, you would say 
it was marvelous indeed, because 
one out of ten is a very small rem- 
nant. And they are the "drawers 
of water and hewers of wood" for 
the Gentiles who have come in 
among them. 

But, fortunately for them, they 
were part of the Lord's covenant 
people, and He said that, though 



ELDER REY L. PRATT.. 



49 



He would permit that they should 
be reduced to a remnant, He would 
not premit their utter destruction. 
He said to Nephi : "I will not per- 
mit that thy seed and the seed of 
thy brethren, shall be totally de- 
stroyed and wiped off from the earth 
by the Gentiles who should come 
among them." The Lord promised 
these people redemption. He said 
that He would reveal the fullness 
of the gospel unto the Gentiles, and 
would establish His Church in the 
land ; and from the Gentiles would 
come unto this people the book 
which would be the history of the 
hand-dealings of the Lord with 
their ancestors, back to the time of 
Father Lehi. As before stated, the 
Lord said that He would not permit 
the remnant of that people to be 
destroyed and wiped off the face of 
the earth. Inasmuch as one part 
of the prophecy has been fulfilled, 
it is perfectly logical, and it is my 
firm conviction, 'that the rest of 
that prophecy will be fulfilled, and 
for the reason I am stating. Al- 
though I have labored in Mexico 
for seven years, and three years of 
that time a bloody war has been in 
progress, and I have seen horrible 
things, I am content in the belief 
that that people are to be redeemed. 
I have seen the redemption of a 
great many of them through the 
teaching of the gospel. 

A great many people have noth- 
ing but horror for the Lamanites 
that live to the south of us. A 
great many say that nothing under 
the sun can redeem the Lamanites 
of Mexico, because they are a peo- 
ple too low to be lifted out of their 
present condition. But, their pres- 
ent condition has been brought 
about because of forces and cir- 
cumstances that have existed, pri- 
marily, because of the rebellious 



spirit of their fathers, of what the 
Lord has permitted to come upon 
them because of that rebellion. But 
I want to tell you that they are not 
too low to be redeemed- I have 
seen men that have been low, men 
that have been everything that was 
bad, have the Gospel spark kindled 
in their hearts and reform their evil 
ways, and I know them today to be 
clean of ' heart and pure of soul. 
The Gospel has done that for them, 
and it can do the same thing for any 
who will accept it. I wish I could 
convince the young men here, that it 
is not a bad thing to come into their 
lives to be asked nay, permitted to 
go to the Lamanite people, but to 
regard it as a privilege. It is a 
glorious privilege. Every young 
man I have known who has gone 
to that mission has come back bet- 
ter in his soul for having come in 
contact with the Lamanite people. . 

I want to life my voice in defense 
of that people, and in defense of the 
prophecies that God has made about 
them. I may not continue my la- 
bors forever among them, but I 
am willing to do so, and I wish to 
keep alive my interest in those peo- 
ple, for I believe in their redemp- 
tion equally with other people. I 
believe, as Peter said, God is no re- 
specter of persons, but that persons 
of whatever nation they may be 
that will accept Christ are accepted 
of our Father in heaven. That is 
part of the Gospel, and it is part of 
the power of God unto salvation, 
that is to bring to pass the universal 
brotherhood of man. We are not 
people that would exclude any 
others from the blessings of the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ. If we have 
the true spirit of the Gospel in our 
hearts, we will be willing to go, 
if necessary, to the ends of the earth 
to bring about the salvation of the

sons and daughters of our Father 
in heaven from the degraded con- 
dition into which they have fallen ; 
it is only possible to bring them 
to enjoy life eternal through the 
Gospel which we enjoy. 

We are the most blest people in 
the world. I have never seen a 
more blest people. I have traveled 
some throughout the United States, 
and other parts of America, and I 
have seen wealthy people, and peo- 
ple of various conditions ; but it is 
my belief that there is no people 
under the sun that are as much 
blest as are the Latter-day 
Saints. There is no people that en- 
joy the same privileges, consequent- 
ly there is no people that ought to 
be more tolerant than the Latter- 
day. Saints. We should have in our 
hearts the love that prompted Christ 
to give His life for all the world, 
that was manifested by our Father 
in heaven, in that He gave His only 
begotten Son that all who believe in 
Him. and accept His teachings, 
might be saved. It is impossible 
for us to gain the perfection that 
Christ commanded His disciples to 
attain to, when He said, "Be ye 
perfect even as my Father in heaven 
is perfect." except we have the same 
degree of love that Christ had when 
He gave His life for the world. 

The work of preaching the Gos- 
pel among the Lamanites is dear to 
me. It is progressing, and I am 
willing to continue my labors. I be- 
lieve that the Lord has required it 
at my hands, and He never requires 
of His servants anything except 
that He opens the way before them 
that they may accomplish that thing- 
T was in the capital of Mexico from 
the 9th to the 18th of February of 
this year, when we did not eat or 
sleep except to the tune of cannon 
or of muskets ; but the elders of the 



Lord were there together, and we 
were protected. There were hun- 
dreds fell, and I saw many of them 
burning in the streets of Mexico ; 
but I am willing to go back and face 
the same or worse conditions, if the 
Lord requires it at my hands, for 
the Lord could open the way for 
me to do good. 

I pray that the Lord will bless 
us, and help us to appreciate the 
blessings that we enjoy, and help 
us to have a loving and tolerant 
spirit and feeling for all mankind, 
which I pray in the name of Jesus. 
Amen.

My heart is full of joy, and 
thanksgiving to my Heavenly Fa- 
ther for the privilege I have in at- 
tending this conference. I trust, my 
brethren and sisters, that during the 
few minutes I stand before you I 
will be aided by the Spirit of the 
Lord, and that I will have your faith 
and prayers that what I say may 
be in accordance with the mind and 
will of God. 

In looking over this congregation, 
I see many generations represented, 
men and women who have kept the 
faith, and now have the opportunity 
of meeting loved ones and enjoy- 
ing many blessings, in some in- 
stances receiving the fulfillment of 
promises given unto them in the 
old world by the servants of the 
Lord, that inasmuch as they would 
accept the Gospel and gather to Zion 
they should be blessed, and that they 
would increase in knowledge and 
spiritual strength.

I am thankful this morning, and 
every day of my life, that I have 
been permitted to come here and 
dwell among Saints of God. I am 
thankful that my grand-parents ac- 
cepted the gospel, and that my fa- 
ther and mother brought me to the 
land of Zion ; that makes me to be- 
long to the third generation in the 
Church. I am also thankful that 
the fourth generation of my family 
line is doing something for the work 
of the Lord, that they are willing to 
go out and proclaim glad tidings of 
great joy to the inhabitants of the 
earth, and warn mankind of the 
judgments that will befall the 
wicked if they will not repent. This 
gives me joy and satisfaction, it 
brings peace to my soul. We have 
been told this morning, by Elder 
Pratt, that the Gospel brings peace 
and joy to the hearts of men and 
women ; it makes bad men good, and 
good men better if they do that 
which the Lord requires at their 
hands from time to time. If we will 
do this we will be blessed, and en- 
joy the Spirit of the Lord, and we 
will not fall by the wayside. 

I am thankful that we are living 
in an age when we have prophets 
of the Lord in our midst, living 
oracles of God. We should be a bet- 
ter people. Those who have been 
reared in these valleys of the moun- 
tains, born of godly parents, ought 
to be better men and women than 
the people of the world, for the 
reason that they have greater op- 
portunities and greater blessings. 
They have not been trained in the 
traditions of the world, as our fore- 
fathers were. Our parents were 
taught in their childhood, many ol 
them, to worship a God without 
body, parts or passions, and they 
grew up with this idea until the 
servants of the Lord proclaimed in 



their hearing, that God had again 
spoken from the heavens and re- 
vealed the Gospel to the earth, and 
that Joseph Smith was the one 
chosen to bring about His purposes. 
Although but a boy, Joseph hum- 
bled himself, and was in such a con- 
dition that he was filled with the 
Spirit of the Lord, and was per- 
mitted, in vision, to see the Father 
and the Son. There were some 
ideas that our fathers and mothers, 
in the world, had to get rid of, many 
traditions. Those that are born 
here have had the glorious oppor- 
tunity of learning the truth, from 
their infancy. Young men and wo- 
men bear testimony that this is the 
work of the Lord, that Jesus is the 
Christ, and they cannot tell you 
when they first received that testi- 
mony They were born with the 
testimony in their hearts. Then- 
fathers and mothers enjoyed the 
testimony of Jesus, they complied 
with the ordinances of the Gospel, 
paid their tithes and offerings to 
the Lord, and the boys and girls 
grow up with those principles im- 
planted in their hearts, and they pay 
their tithes and offerings and follow 
in the faith of their fathers. I tell 
you, fathers and mothers, there is 
nothing that can bring more joy and 
peace to the Latter-day Saints than 
to have their boys and girls receive 
a testimony of the Gospel, and obey 
its principles. 

I was very much pleased with the 
spirit of the morning session of our 
conference, yesterday; the key-note 
was given, and it appears to me that 
reform will result. It is right that 
something should be said to the Lat- 
ter-day Saints, and to the world, 
that the wayward might repent anci 
turn unto the Lord, and worship 
Him more fully in the future than 
they have in the past. We have been

taught the Gospel principles from 
our youth up, they have been' 
preached continuously to the inhabi- 
tants of Zion. We find ourselves 
somewhat in the same condition the 
members of the Church were in the 
days of the Prophet Joseph Smith, 
when the Lord saw fit to give a 
revelation concerning the young 
people, and said that inasmuch as 
parents have children in Zion, and 
teach them not the principles of the 
Gospel, condemnation would fall up- 
on their heads. The Lord was dis- 
pleased at that time, because many 
of the children were growing up in 
unbelief, their eyes were set upon 
the things of the world more than 
the things of God, and that warning 
was given. The same admonition 
applies unto the Latter-day Saints 
today as it did at that time. I have 
never lost anything, spiritually or 
temporally, by listening to the ser- 
vants of the Lord and following 
their instructions. I do not believe 
that there is a man or a woman with- 
in the sound of my voice that can 
truthfully say they have ever lost 
anything in this world's goods by 
laboring for the kingdom of God 
and the establishment of righteous- 
ness in the earth. 

I bear testimony that I know God 
lives, that He hears and answers the 
prayers of the Saints, those that 
draw near unto Him. I know that 
Joseph Smith was a prophet of 
God. I know that we have proph- 
ets, seers and revelators in our midst 
today, through whom we may re- 
ceive instructions from God for the 
guidance of this people. I have also 
found out that it pays to stay with 
the body of the Church ; that has 
been my experience, and I desire 
to remain with the Church always. 
I am thankful that I continue to 
have a name and standing in the 



Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints. 

May the Lord bless us, my breth- 
ren and sisters, that we may be en- 
titled to His Spirit day by day, that 
we may not turn to the right nor 
to the left, but keep the Spirit within 
us that will lead us unto eternal 
life. I ask this in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen.

The Lord everywhere present by 
His Spirit — Great importance of 
Book of Doctrine and Covenants — 
Tithing a Divine law to all man- 
kind — Tithing expended for Spirit- 
ual welfare of Church members — A 
test of faith, and a preserver from 
destruction. 

Brethren and sisters, is the Lord 
in yonder tabernacle at this mo- 
ment ? Yes, the Lord is there. Is 
the Lord in this building today and 
now? Yes, the Lord is here. Is 
He in the stakes of Zion ? Yes, God 
is in the stakes of Zion, and you 
cannot climb so high into the heav- 
ens but that you will find the Lord 
is there, and you cannot descend so 
deep into the earth but what you 
will find the Lord is there. He is 
everywhere upon the face of the 
earth, and above the earth, and in 
the earth, and under the earth, and 
more particularly is He with His 
people, by the power and influence 
of His divine Spirit. They have 
a special claim upon Him, that 
comes by reason of the Gospel and 
the sacred ordinances and covenants 
that they have entered into, and 
therefore I again affirm, very 
strongly, that the Lord is here, and 
that we are entitled to, and are re- 
ceiving His blessing.

I am holding in my hand, one of 
the most wonderful books of this or 
any other age. It is the Doctrine 
and Covenants. Now I do not say 
it is better than the Bible. I do not 
say it is better than the Book of 
Mormon or the Pearl of Great 
Price ; but I do say it is one of the 
most wonderful books ever pub- 
lished, remarkable in many respects 
above and beyond all other books. 
As stated by President Smith in the 
conference yesterday, the Book of 
Doctrine and Covenants contains 
things that will not be found in any 
other book. This book embodies 
the revelations which were given by 
the Lord to Joseph Smith, the 
prophet, and there is one thing 
about this book that we can ap- 
preciate and that we can rely upon, 
and that is that it contains the truth, 
that what it contains is the truth, and 
that there is no error, no false doc- 
trine in this record. It is the pure 
word of God by revelations to His 
prophet. It is a book that is to 
be appreciated, but it is a book 
which has not been read, I presume, 
by very many of the Latter-day 
Saints — hot read and studied as it 
should be. 

If you will bear with me a mo- 
ment, I am going to read a few 
words from one of the revelations 
in this book. It is a very remark- 
able revelation, but then it is not 
different to any of the others. This 
revelation was given to Joseph the 
Seer in the presence of six elders, 
in Fayette, Seneca County, New 
York, September, 1830. You know 
the prophet used to receive revela- 
tions, did upon many occasions, I 
presume, when he was by himself. 
But in this instance, there were six 
elders present, and that would be 
quite a testimony to the truth of the 
revelation, at least that there were 



six witnesses who knew and under- 
stood that the revelation was given 
to the Prophet Joseph Smith. I do 
not propose to read it all. There is 
too much substance and body to the 
whole revelation. It would not do 
to read it all. These words 
are to be studied ; they are to be 
reflected upon, and there is certainly 
sufficient in the text or in the words 
that I shall read to you to supply 
the text for a very powerful ser- 
mon if I was able to preach it. 1 
am not. I will read a few words in 
advance, which will lead up to what 
I wanted to say. The Lord said : 

"But remember that all my judgments 
are not given unto man : and as the 
words have gone forth out of my mouth, 
even so shall they be fulfilled, that the 
first shall be last and that the last shall 
be first in all things whatsoever I have 
created by the word of my power, which 
is the power of my spirit." 

Now there is a great text for a 
sermon in these words, brethren and 
sisters, and a very great sermon it 
would be if it was preached under 
the influence of the Spirit of the 
Lord. 

"For by the power of my Spirit cre- 
ated I them; yea, all things both spirit- 
ual and temporal; firstly spiritual, sec- 
ondly temporal, which is the beginning 
of my work; and again, firstly temporal, 
and secondly spiritual, which is the last 
of my work. Speaking_ unto you that 
you may naturally understand, but unto 
myself my works have no end, neither 
beginning; but it is given unto you that 
ye may understand, because ye have 
asked it of me and are agreed." 

Of course we get the impression 
from these words that God's work 
is everlasting, and with Him it is 
one eternal round. He vises the 
words "firstly" and lastly," in order 
that we by our finite minds may 
be able to understand ; but to Him 



54 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



there is no beginning of his works ; 
there is no end to them. It is a 
beautiful thought, isn't it? It gives 
you the idea at once of eternal life, 
something that continues and never 
ends. It is a tremendous thought, 
and quite beyond our comprehen- 
sion. There is no man in this room, 
there is no woman in this assembly, 
that can comprehend, can begin to 
grasp the idea of eternal life. We 
can feel it. We just feel it in our 
very bones. We feel that we are 
destined to live forever. We feel 
that, but we cannot explain it. But 
that is not what I am aiming at. 

"Wherefore, verily I say unto you that 
all things unto me are spiritual, and 
not at any time have I given unto you a 
law which was temporal; neither any 
man, nor the children of men; neither 
Adam, your father, whom I created. 
Behold, I gave unto him that he should 
be an agent unto himself; and I gave 
unto him commandments, but no temp- 
oral commandment gave I unto him, for 
my commandments are spiritual ; they are 
not natural nor temporal, neither carnal 
not sensual." 

Now mark these words ; they are 
very remarkable, very. It seems 
strange that the Lord should make 
use of this language, and that He 
should make the definite statement 
to His Church that not at any time 
had He ever given a temporal com- 
mandment. And I think you will 
agree with me, my brethren and sis- 
ters, when we come to sit down and 
reflect upon the subject and go into 
it, that so far as we know these 
words are verily true. 

I would like to give you an ex- 
ample or two to emphasize the state- 
ment which I have read in your 
hearing. It may seem almost con- 
tradictory, but it is not. I will take 
for an illustration the law of tithing. 
You know that the law of tithing is 
the great revenue law of the Church 



of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints ; that it is by and through this 
law that means are accumulated for 
the benefit and blessing of the 
Church. It is a very wonderful law. 
and I am wondering right now, as 
I speak, whether there is any one 
in this congregation who will say, 
"Yes, O yes, we have heard of that 
law before ; we have heard about 
tithing, and it is a dry subject." Is 
it a dry subject, brethren and sis- 
ters? Is it uninteresting? I tell 
you we will decide it is one of the 
grandest, most beautiful, and most 
practical laws that God ever gave 
to man, if we will reflect upon it 
and consider what it is. accomplish- 
ing. There was a time in the Church, 
not many years in the past, when 
this law was considerably neglected. 
As a result, the Church became 
weakened. There was a time, we 
all remember it, when the Church 
was brought face to face, as it were, 
with bankruptcy. It almost came 
to that. The financial credit of the 
Church was very low. It was in 
those days of money stringency, 
when the country was passing 
through a sort of a financial panic 
that the Church's credit, as I said, 
was low. The assets of the Church 
were very little in excess of the 
liabilities ; and whenever the assets 
of the Church or any institution, 
sink below the liabilities, then it is 
bankrupt. It must be so. But when 
the members of the Church were 
wakened up to the importance of 
this great law, prosperity returned 
again ; and to the extent, that the 
Latter-day Saints will observe this 
law and keep it, the Church will be 
blessed, and the people will be pros- 
pered, not only temporally but 
spiritually. 

There are a great many people 
in the world who find fault with the 



ELDER RUDGER CLA WSON. 



55 



Latter-day Saints, because of the 
law of tithing. They entertain all 
sorts of notions about it, and when 
they say that this law is intended to 
enrich the few at the expense of the 
many, they at once cast a reflec- 
tion upon the Lord, God. Did you 
ever realize that. Any man in the 
Church, or out of the Church, who 
takes that stand, and says that the 
intention and purpose of the law, 
is to enrich the few at the expense 
of the many, casts a stigma upon 
the law of heaven; because, let me 
tell you, the law of tithing did not 
originate with any man. Joseph 
Smith the Prophet was not respon- 
sible for it, nor any of his succes- 
sors. The present leader of the 
Church, is not in the least responsi- 
ble for it. It is a commandment of 
God which came by revelation, and 
is binding upon the Church and 
every member thereof. I was going 
to add "strange to say," but I will 
not do so, because it is not strange. 
—This law is just as binding upon 
the prophet of God, our president, 
as upon the least and last member 
in the Church ; and it is just as 
binding upon the Twelve Apostles 
as anybody else, also upon the 
Seven Presidents of Seventies and 
the Presiding Bishopric. Yes, there 
are the Presiding Bishopric, who 
are appointed to look after and ac- 
count for the tithing, and yet they 
must pay tithing themselves. They 
must be honest with the Lord, just 
as much so as those who pay tith- 
ing into their hands. They must of 
necessity put their hands into their 
pockets and pay tithing, in common 
with us all. And this re- 
quirement simply exemplifies the 
justice of God. The Lord is no re- 
specter of persons. What He re- 
quires of one of the least of His 
servants He requires of the greatest. 



A beautiful lesson is it not? Men 
are respecters of persons very often, 
in their families, in their lives and 
in many ways. God is not a respec- 
ter of persons. He is absolutely 
just in these matters, and He will 
not receive unnecessary excuses. He 
makes no allowance for neglect of 
duty, or for sin. Those who sin 
must repent and do better. 

Men in the world who find fault 
with this great law of revenue which 
has been given to the Church of 
Christ, run up against a stone wall, 
as it were, because they run up 
against the Bible. The Bible is 
full of it There is no law, no com- 
mandment ever given to the children 
of men that is emphasized, more 
strongly in the Bible than tithing. 
Why, there is Abraham, a tithe- 
payer; — Abraham, the friend of 
God and the Father of the Faithful, 
of whom the Lord said that in him, 
in his seed, and in his priesthood, 
all the families of the earth should 
be blessed. How great a man was 
he that the Lord designated him as 
His friend. It is a great thing to 
be the friend of God. Abraham 
was such, and yet the Lord required 
and demanded of him that he 
should pay tithes, and he did so. 
Specific instances are given. He 
paid tithes to the great High Priest 
Melchizedek, who was king of Sal- 
em, the prince of peace. Now Mel- 
chizedek must have been an import- 
ant character if Abraham was re- 
quired to go to him and pay tithes 
and offerings. And again, there 
was Jacob, whose name was after- 
wards changed to Israel. When we 
say that we are the children of 
Israel it simply means that we are 
the children of Jacob, nothing more. 
He was a great patriarch, and the 
promises of the Father were sealed 
upon his head. But, mark yolu >

brethren and sisters and take not- 
ice of what Jacob did. One of the 
first things he did, and one of the 
great things he did, was to make a 
solemn vow unto the Lord that if 
God would bless him and multiply 
him and bring him back to his fa- 
ther's house, and establish him in 
the land, he would pay a tenth of 
all to the Lord. And no doubt he 
kept this sacred vow, because Ja- 
cob was remarkably blessed, so that 
■everything he touched was blessed, 
and everything that the Lord gave 
him was multiplied, over and over 
again, wherever he went- If he 
went to work for a man, the man 
was blessed, and the man's family 
was blessed, and everything round 
about him was blessed. Jacob was 
multiplied to such an extent that 
he had to move out; he could not 
remain in any one place- His fa- 
ther in law was blessed, and Jacob 
was blessed, and his flocks and 
herds increased so rapidly that Ja- 
cob had to move away. And so 
it was in those days, that when the 
people paid their tithes and offer- 
ings, they were prospered. This 
law was taught to the children of 
Israel. Upon one occasion the Lord 
complained against the children of 
Israel, and asked them how it was 
that they had robbed Him. That 
was an awful charge to bring 
against a people, brought by the 
Lord against His own chosen people. 
The children of Israel were robbing 
Him. but they were perfectly as- 
tonished, and said ; "Wherein have 
we robbed thee?" And the Lord an- 
swered; "In your tithes and your 
offerings." Possibly some one 
might be disposed to say, "Well, 
I don't owe the Lord anything, be- 
cause I have worked for that which 
I possess. I have wrung it out of 
the soil by the sweat of my brow 



and by the strength of my body, 
with this brawny arm and horny 
hand. I have arisen in the morning 
at four o'clock, have worked all 
day into the night, and I have 
simply wrung my wealth from the 
soil, and it belongs to me, and I do 
not owe the Lord anything." Thou 
fool ! hast thou forgotten what the 
Apostle Paul said: "I planted, 
Apollos watered, and God gave the 
increase ; so that he that planted 
is nothing, neither is he that watered, 
but God who giveth the increase." 
That is the philosophy df it. What 
man is there who by planting a grain 
of corn into the earth can multiply 
that kernel of corn, and make twen- 
ty or thirty more grains of corn to 
grow? What man is there who, by 
planting a potato in the earth, can 
make it grow and multiply itself, so 
that where he put in one potato 
twenty to forty potatoes came out of 
the ground ? What man can do that ? 
Here comes a man, who says, "I 
can do it." How will you do it? 
"Why, I will put it in the earth and 
water it, and that is just what it 
will do." Well, can you do it? All 
you did was to plant it in the earth 
and water it ; you did not cause it 
to grow. God caused it to grow, 
and He multiplied it. And He will 
multiply you in that way. The Loi u 
has made you rich, and now when 
He comes to you and says, "Give 
Me what belongs to Me ; I have 
bestowed upon you all these good 
things, return to Me a portion, one- 
tenth ; give it back to me " Then 
the man says : "I want it, I will 
not give it back nor any part of it." 
Do you think that man will pros- 
per? One may say, yes, he is pros- 
pering, and getting lots of grain and 
potatoes ; he is building barns, and 
so on, and hie is widening out, and he 
is multiplying in his stock, and

property and all. Do you say he is 
blessed ? Go into his home, and you 
will find out what kind of a spirit is 
there. See if. there is a spirit of 
love, a spirit of knowledge, a spirit 
of faith? That is what you should 
look for and see if the man is blessed 
or not? Why, these very riches 
that he has obtained may be a curse 
to him, may canker his soul and des- 
stroy it. 

Now somebody will say: "Bro- 
ther Clawson, is it not a fact that 
the law of tithing is absolutely and 
purely and simply a temporal law?" 
I would answer and say that the 
law of tithng, it is true, has to do 
with temporal things ; but in a far 
deeper sense, the law of tithing is 
spiritual, and that is the thing I 
want to come to, to show that it is 
spiritual. Everything that we do con- 
nected with this law of tithing points 
to spiritual things. What is tithing 
for? It is for the building up of 
Zion. It is to build temples to God. 
You take material substances, the 
material things of the earth ; and 
out them into the form of a temple. 
Tt takes money to build a temple. 
Money comes from the earth, it be- 
longs to the earth. But what does 
that temple represent ; what does it 
amount to in and of itself? It is 
simply a building of wood and stone. 
That is all it is, nothing more. It 
is not the temple ; it is what the tem- 
ple represents to us that gives it im- 
portance and value. It is what we 
get in the temple, and we there ob- 
tain great and glorious spiritual 
blessings. That is the important 
thing. We get our washings and 
our annointings, and our sealings 
and do work for the living and the 
dead. That is spiritual, very spirit- 
ual. Beautiful ! We have built a 
number of temples. We are build- 
ing one in Canada now. I would 



not be surprised if you will yet see 
temples all over the land of Zion, 
all over America. Take the taber- 
nacle here. That is a material thing, 
isn't it? Very material. It is built 
of wood and stone. It is nothing 
but a house ; that is all. It is what 
the tabernacle represents to us ; it 
is what is being done in the taber- 
nacle. It is what is being done right 
now in the tabernacle that gives im- 
portance and value to it. In and of 
itself it amounts to but little ; many 
people come and look at it, and say 
it is a wonderful building. I do not 
care about that. Its size and ap- 
pearance is the least part of it. There 
is a wonderful organ in the taber- 
nacle. This is a small consideration. 
It is what is said there ; it is the 
valuable instructions that are given, 
counsels of the priesthood, admoni- 
tions, warnings, reproof, all in- 
tended to build up and strengthen 
the soul- That is spiritual, and it 
grows out of the law of tithing, 
because that great tabernacle was 
built from the tithes and the offer- 
ings of the people. And so we 
might go on. There is a vast amount 
of the funds that comes from the 
tithing that is used for our Church 
schools. This is a great movement 
in Zion. We do not know, we do 
not appreciate what the Church 
schools are doing. But I will tell 
you who will appreciate it. The fa- 
ther that has his sons going to the 
Church sdhools, the parents that 
have daughters going there ; and 
when they see that these children 
are imbibing Gospel principles, that 
faith is springing up in their hearts, 
that they are getting testimonies and 
being prepared to carry 6n the work 
of their fathers, they then begin to 
know what the Church schools mean 
to Zion. And let me tell you, breth- 
ren and sisters, in a wide sense, and 



58 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



in a very deep and important sense 
that is spiritual. I do not care any- 
thing about the great school build- 
ings any more than to appreciate 
them, and to know that we have 
them. But they are only stone and 
wood and so on, with a little or- 
namentation. It is what is taking 
place in them, it is what is coining 
to your children and my children, 
what is being done for them. You 
know what it means, brethren and 
sisters, if you send your children to 
gentile schools. Now I do not speak 
of them in a spirit of disrespect. I 
mean to send children to schools 
where they never hear, and where 
it is even against the law for them 
to hear, instruction concerning the 
Gospel, or concerning the Lord. 
They may get some moral teach- 
ings, but they do not get any relig- 
ious teaching, no theological instruc- 
tion. You know what that means. 
I tell you it is very disastrous to 
your children, very, and would be 
to mine- The great educators of 
the earth, the President of the 
Chicago University and others are 
crying out today, right now today, 
for some religious instruction in the 
schools of our country. That is 
what is lacking in our schools, they 
say ; we ought to have some relig- 
ious training, some religious instruc- 
tion. They are not getting it in those 
schools, but we are bringing it into 
our Church schools, and we are 
trying to bring it as near to the dis- 
trict schools as we can without get- 
ting into them, by the religion 
classes. Every now and then some 
bigot will rise up and make an aw- 
ful cry, and condemn the religion 
class movement, yet it is recognized, 
by those who are in positions to 
know, that if we do not get some re- 
ligious training in our universities 
and colleges, it means disaster to the 



nation. That is spiritual. The means 
that are expended in bringing our 
missionaries home from the mis- 
sions, and in maintaining mission- 
ary expenses, and so on — that is 
spiritual too. The great amounts that 
are expended in building meeting 
houses, and in building up the stakes 
of Zion, come out of the tithes, and 
these things constitute a marvel- 
ously spiritual work in the Church. 
But that is not all. 

Let me tell you something else 
connected with this law of tithing. 
I have just about time to tell it too, 
and that is all. This is what the 
Lord said. You can judge for your- 
selves whether it is spiritual or tem- 
poral. You will find it in the sixth 
paragraph in the law of tithing : 

"I say unto you if my people observe 
not this law to keep it holy, and by this 
law sanctify the land of Zion unto me, 
that my statutes and my judgments may 
be kept thereon, that it may be most 
holy, behold, verily I say unto you it shall 
not be a land of Zion unto you." 

Now, do you know what that 
means, brethren and sisters? That 
simply means that if this is not the 
land of Zion unto you, then this land 
is cursed, because either the land 
must be sanctified or it must be un- 
der curse, and the only way that 
we can sanctify it and really make 
it the land of Zion is to pay our 
tithes, and thus sanctify and make it 
holy. Is that spiritual, or temporal? 
If the land is under a curse, then 
we cannot build up Zion, and all our 
labors and all our doings will come 
to naught. So we must remove the 
curse from the land, and we can do 
it by the observance of this law. Will 
anybody tell me that the law of 
tithing can be ignored, can ; be 
treated with indifference ; I tell you, 
my brethren and sisters, it is 



ELDER RUDGER CLAWSON.

a most serious question- It is the 
test of every man's faith, and it is 
the test of every woman's faith who 
earns means and should be a tithe 
payer. That is, the test, if a man 
is an honest tithe payer, he will be 
pretty honest in everything else. I 
declare to you, if a man pays tith- 
ing, he will pray, he will go to his 
quorum meetings, he will go to his 
sacrament meetings, and he will do 
a great many other things. I do 
not know that you could apply a 
greater or a stronger test. 

I am going to make just one 
other allusion, just one' brief ref- 
erence to the law of tithing. It is 
important in a way, I think. Now 
listen to these words that occur in 
another revelation, which was given 
September 11, 1831: 

"Behold, now it is called today (until 
the coming of the Son of Man), and 
verily it is a day of sacrifice and a day 
of the tithing of my people, for he that 
is tithed shall not be burned at His 
coming." Very remarkable words ! 
"For after today cometh the burning. 
This is speaking after the manner of the 
Lord ;for verily I say, tomorrow all the 
proud and they that do wickedly shall 
be as stubble ,and I will burn them up. 
for I am the Lord of hosts, and I will 
not spare any that remain in Babylon." 

What does that mean? Does it 
mean that if a man will not pay his 
tithing, that the Lord is going to 
send a ball of fire down from heav- 
en and burn him up ? No ; the Lord 
does not do that way. The Lord 
works on natural principles. This 
is what it means, if I read correctly : 
a man who ignores the express 
command of the Lord, by failing to 
pay his tithing, it means that the 
Spirit of the Lord will withdraw 
from him ; it means that the power 
of the priesthood will withdraw 
from that man, if he continues in 



the spirit of neglect to do his duty. 
He will drift away into darkness, 
gradually but surely, until finally 
(mark you) he will lift up his eyes 
among the wicked. That is where 
he will finally land ; and then when 
the destruction comes and when the 
burning comes, he will be among 
the wicked, and will be destroyed; 
while those who observe the law 
will be found among the righteous, 
and they will be preserved. There 
is a God in heaven, and He has 
promised to shield and protect them. 
I tell you there is a day of burn- 
ing, a day of destruction coming 
upon the wicked. And where will 
we be ? Will we be with the wicked, 
or with the righteous? I hope 
among the righteous, and not among 
the wicked ; which is my prayer, in 
the name of Jesus. Amen- 

The choir sang the anthem, "God 
is Love," the solo parts were ren- 
dered by Sister Nellie Parr and 
Brother O. S. Squires. 

Benediction was pronounced by 
Elder Ferdinand F. Hintze. 



SECOND OVERFLOW 
MEETING. 

Another meeting of the Confer- 
ence was held in the Assembly Hall, 
at 2 p. m., at which Elder Joseph F. 
Smith, Jr., presided. 

The Forest Dale ward choir again 
furnished the musical exercises. 

The choir sang the hymn : 

Hark! ten thousand thousand voices 

Sing the song of jubilee! 
Earth, through all her tribes, rejoices — 

Broke her long captivity. 

Prayer was offered by Elder 
Joseph S- Wells.

ELDER SERGE P. BALLIF. 

(President of Cache Stake.) 

My beloved brothers and sisters, 
I can assure you that I am pleased 
to be in this conference. I recog- 
nize the hand of the Lord in calling 
together His people that they might 
be instructed in the words of life. 
I believe, from the bottom of my 
heart, when we assemble on occa- 
sions of this kind, that if we have a 
prayerful desire in our hearts to re- 
ceive the word of God, then those 
who may be called upon will ad- 
dress us under the inspiration of the 
Spirit of the Lord, and we will be 
indeed fed upon the bread of life. 

On leaving my home to come to 
this conference, I had a desire that 
the Lord would inspire His servants 
to speak on a subject that very 
much concerns the stake where I 
am living. I felt that I would like 
that we should receive some in- 
structions upon the Word of Wis- 
dom, a principle, commandment, 
and revelation of God that is not 
being observed to the fullest extent 
by the Latter-day Saints today. My 
heart was full of that desire when 
T entered the- Tabernacle yesterday 
morning, and I testify to you, my 
brethren and sisters, that my prayer 
was answered. The Lord directed 
the words of His servants in ac- 
cordance with my desires. I believe 
the same desire was in the hearts of 
the Latter-day Saints, and we all 
felt the inspiration of Almighty 
God. It was indeed a revelation 
and inspiration to us, to hear the 
prophet of the Lord make the state- 
ments that he did in our hearing in 
that meeting yesterday morning. 



My heart was filled with joy, and I 
hope that every Latter-day Saint 
will feel that those words were for 
them individually, as I felt that they 
were for our mutual benefit, renew- 
ing an important revelation from 
God. I believe that Joseph Smith 
was a Prophet of God, and that the 
Lord, through him, made known to 
His people, when he gave that reve- 
lation, the things that were neces- 
sary for their well-being here upon 
the earth. I want to demonstrate 
by my life that I believe Joseph 
Smith was a prophet, by rendering 
obedience 'to that command, by 
keeping it in my own home, by 
teaching it to my children, by living 
in accordance with the principles of 
the word of wisdom. 

Another thing that I strongly de- 
sired to hear discussed, was the 
question of reform in dress of our 
young people. This matter also has 
been preying upon my mind in re- 
gard to the people in Cache stake, 
and when the Prophet of the Lord 
made mention of that in our con- 
ference, I felt again that my pray- 
ers had been answered. I think that 
the prayers of every Latter-day 
Saint, of every father and mother 
were similarly answered. I believe 
that the Spirit of the Lord made 
manifest unto all of us that the 
Lord made known through His 
prophet the things that are needful 
to be corrected in our midst. 

I appreciate the teachings that 
we receive from time to time in 
these conferences. I trust that 
every Latter-day Saint fully under- 
stands the importance of coming to 
these conferences with the spirit of 
prayer, with a desire to be instruct- 
ed, and with a determination to 
carry out in our lives the instruc- 
tions that are given to us by the 
servants of the Lord on occasions 



ELDER SERGE F. BALLIF.

of this kind. In contemplating 
about the short history of our peo- 
ple, I thought of the time when the 
great Tabernacle on this block was 
used first for a conference, in Oc- 
tober, 1867, forty-six years ago. 
When I look at that building today, 
I know that the Lord inspired the 
men who designed and erected that 
great edifice. I have traveled in 
many parts of the world, including 
most of Europe, and I never have 
seen a building that will compare 
with that one, and I am confirmed 
in the belief that the inspiration of 
the Lord directed its construction. 

I was also thinking further of 
tilings that to me are of importance. 
On the 8th of October, in a confer- 
ence that was held in the Taberna- 
cle, the first conference, if my mem- 
ory serves me right, our present 
Prophet, Seer and Revelator was 
called to the apostleship. I feel to 
thank the Lord for his faithful life, 
for enabling him to magnify his 
great calling as an Apostle. He has 
certainly been an inspiration to this 
people. His words that we hear 
from time to time in these confer- 
ences should be taken by the Lat- 
ter-day Saints as being inspired by 
the Spirit of God. I often think of 
remarks that are made sometimes 
by our young people and by 
strangers ; they say, "Where are the 
great men today, men like Brigham 
Young, John Taylor, and other 
leaders?" I answer, we have great 
men in our midst today. They are 
equal to the occasion ; they are the 
men God has called and chosen to 
direct the affairs of His Church to- 
day, and I say they are indeed 
prophets, seers and revelators unto 
this people. 

I was much pleased the other day 
when a young man, whom I had 
never seen before, came into my 



office, and be said "I want to be 
baptized. I have been here for 
some time ; I have traveled among 
your people and have become con- 
verted through my observation, 
through listening to the teachings 
of your people, that you have the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ, and I desire 
to be baptized. An ideal and object 
of my life now is that I may go into 
that Temple on the hill when the 
proper time comes." This was an 
inspiration to me ; my heart was 
filled with joy, and I thought of the 
words of the Lord, that we will be 
known by our works. I was pleased 
to feel that the young man must 
have been associating with people 
in that stake of Zion who were liv- 
ing according to the principles of 
the Gospel in their daily lives. He 
had a laudable desire to go into the 
house of the Lord, and there receive 
a wife according to God's law, for 
time and for all eternity. There 
was an object lesson to all of our 
young people, to my daughters, to 
my sons. My greatest desire and 
prayer is that my boys and girls 
may be worthy to go into God's 
holy house, and there enter into 
sacred obligations and covenants 
with the Lord, and take unto them- 
selves wives and husbands that will 
be theirs throughout the endless 
ages of eternity. I believe in teach- 
ing our young men and young 
women the sanctity of these holy 
temples. I believe that they should 
be taught from their infancy to rev- 
erence those edifices, because of the 
sacred ordinances performed there- 
in. 

My brethren and sisters, I do not 
feel to occupy the time further. I 
pray that the blessings of the Lord 
may be with His people, that we 
may live in accordance with this 
grand Gospel that will redeem man-

kind through obedience to its prin- 
ciples. I am converted to the Gos- 
pel of the Lord Jesus Christ. I 
know, beyond question in my soul, 
that Joseph Smith was a prophet of 
God. I want to live to demonstrate 
in every act of my life that I know 
that he was a prophet. I revere 
and respect his name. I love the 
Gospel as it has been made known, 
and I trust that all Latter-day 
Saints may have a desire in their 
hearts to be true to the covenants 
that they have made with the Lord. 
May we live lives worthy of exam- 
ple, that our light may shine, so 
that the people of the world will 
see our good works, and glorify our 
Heavenly Father. God bless you, 
my brethren and sisters, is my 
prayer in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER ORVIL L. THOMPSON. 

(President of Millard Stake.) 

My brethren and sisters. I sense 
very keenly the responsibility that is 
upon an elder occupying this posi- 
tion, and I desire earnestly that the 
short time I stand before you that 
the Spirit of the Lord which has 
characterized the meetings of this 
conference shall also prompt in what 
I may be led to say. 

I have rejoiced in the spirit of the 
conference, and all that has been 
said and done has received my 
heartiest approval. The words of 
admonition and of rebuke, if they 
may be so termed, have appeared to 
me to come with the real spirit and 
inspiration of the Lord, and have 
applied to people over whom I pre- 
side in the Millard stake of Zion, 
and I believe they apply largely 
throughout the Church. The words 
of our leaders have been inspired of 
the Lord, they have been spoken by 



true shepherds of Israel, watchmen 
upon the towers of Zion, and it be- 
comes the duty of those who have 
heard, and those who shall hear or 
read the proceedings of this confer- 
ence, to reduce to practice in their 
lives the wise suggestions that have 
been made. I bear record, as Presi- 
dent Ballif has done, that my pray- 
ers have been answered, and things 
that have worried me, and to which 
I have given thought and attention, 
have been spoken in this conference 
and our duties made plain. I am 
disposed, as far as I may be given 
ability, to introduce and to spread 
this spirit and these teachings 
among the people where I labor, for 
I love the people over whom I pre- 
side. I am anxious for their wel- 
fare, temporal and spiritual. I de- 
sire earnestly their salvation and 
good works, and in connection with 
them I desire the salvation of the 
human family, the whole household 
of faith in particular. I feel that 
the remarks that have been made, 
the suggestions that have been given 
for our temporal and spiritual ben- 
efit are timely and proper. They 
appeal to us, and deserve our earn- 
est attention, and advocacy among 
all of our people when we shall re- 
turn to our homes. 

Our brethren have been im- 
pressed, even as was the Apostle 
Paul in some of his epistles to the 
ancient saints, with the necessity of 
calling the people to repentance. 
Since listening to the remarks of the 
President, in the opening session of 
the conference, I have compared his 
appeal to the people, and his instruc- 
tions, to some remarks made in an 
epistle written to the Corinthian 
Saints by the Apostle Paul. I shall 
read a few verses in the tenth chap- 
ter of the First Epistle of Paul to 
the Corinthians : 



ELDER ORVIL L. THOMPSON.

"Moreover, brethren, I would not 
that ye should be ignorant how that 
all our fathers were under the cloud, 
and all passed through the sea, and 
were all baptized unto Moses in the 
cloud and in the sea, and did all eat 
the same spiritual meat, and did all 
drink the same spiritual drink, for 
they drank of that spiritual rock that 
followed them, and that rock was 
Christ. But with many of them God 
was not well pleased, for they were 
overthrown in the wilderness. Now 
these things were our examples, to the 
intent we should not lust after evil 
things, . as they also lusted. Neither 
be ye idolaters, as were some of them. 
As it is written, the people sat down 
to eat and to drink, and rose up to 
play. Neither let us commit fornica- 
tion, As some of them committed, and 
fell in one day three and twenty thous- 
and. Neither let us tempt Christ, as 
some of them also tempted, and were 
destroyed of serpents. Neither mur- 
mur ye, as some of them also mur- 
mured, and were destroyed of the de- 
stroyer. Now all these things hap- 
pened unto them for ensamples; and 
they were written for our admonition, 
upon whom the ends of the world are 
come. Wherefore, let him that think- 
eth he standeth take heed lest he fall. 
There hath no temptation taken you 
but such as is common to man; but 
God is faithful, who will not suffer 
you to be tempted above that ye are 
able, but will with the temptation also 
make a way to escape, that ye may be 
able to bear it. Wherefore, my dearly 
beloved, flee from idolatry." 

These were the exhortations of 
the Apostle to the Corinthian Saints, 
and were given as an admonition to 
them. I rejoice in the fact that we 
have men with us today, servants 
of the Lord, His prophets, who see 
the necessities of the people, and 
give us words of admonition that 
we may escape the calamities that 
have come upon other generations 
and other people, when they have 
fallen into sin and failed to keep the 
commandments of God. Therefore 
I rejoice in the admonitions we have 
received in this conference, and I 



bear record of their truth, because 
the Spirit of the Lord has indicated 
to me that they are true. 

I was impressed with the remarks 
of President Smith, wherein he said 
that many of the blessings to which 
the Saints are entitled do not come 
to them ; many are deprived of these 
blessings for the reason that they 
are not in harmony with all of the 
principles of the gospel, and they 
are not living their lives as they 
should do. We should teach the 
Gospel by our examples as well as 
by our precepts. I believe that all 
who hold the priesthood, and who 
are acting in it and under its author- 
ity, realize the truth of the state- 
ments of the President. I testify, 
as did President Ballif, in regard to 
the inspiration that characterizes the 
life and the 'labors of the true Lat- 
ter-day Saint, that the cause is not 
failing, that inspiration has not 
ceased, but it is still powerful, and 
the blessings and the privileges of 
the Gospel are enjoyed by those who 
are living the lives of Latter-day 
Saints. The Spirit bears record to- 
day, as it did in ancient days, when 
the people of the Lord have been 
keeping His commandments, in re- 
gard to the truth of the work. Bless- 
ings and inspiration attends the 
ministrations of the servants of the 
Lord, and the hearts of the people 
are made to rejoice when they are 
keeping His commandments and are 
entitled to the blessings. 

Last week I was called into the 
home of a good faithful family, 
where their petitions ascend to the 
Lord in the season thereof, as rec- 
ommended by President Lyman this 
morning, where the Word of Wis- 
dom is kept by the father and moth- 
er and children. I was called to ad- 
minister to one who had met with 
a serious accident, and who was

lying at the point of death ; and 
while administering to the young 
lady who was thus sorely afflicted, 
I received inspiration of the Lord 
to promise her restoration to per- 
fect health and strength ; and, after 
the ministration was over, to com- 
fort the heart of the anxious mother, 
I assured her that the Lord had re- 
vealed to me that her daughter 
should be restored to perfect condi- 
tion. I bear testimony to this as 
evidence that the Spirit of inspira- 
tion and revelation is enjoyed by 
members of the Church who keep 
the commandments of the Lord. 
When we come into homes of the 
character I have described, we feel 
the influence, and have the power 
to call down upon the inmates of 
that home the blessings of the 
Almighty. 

These blessings may be enjoyed 
more fully by the Saints if they will 
walk uprightly and keep the com- 
mandments of the Lord. I rejoice 
in this fact, and that our leaders re- 
ceive inspiration of the Amighty 
from time to time as is necessary, 
and give wise counsel unto the peo- 
ple. I feel like taking home with 
me and give to the people for whose 
welfare I am more anxious than for 
any others, because they are most 
closely associated with me, this mes- 
sage, that if they desire to receive 
the blessings of the Almighty in 
their families, in the restoration of 
the sick, the prevention of disease, 
and the enjoyment of the Spirit of 
the Lord, they must live accord- 
ing to the laws upon which these 
blessings are predicated and prom- 
ised. 

As remarked by one of the speak- 
ers this morning, I am proud of the 
monuments that have been erected 
commemorating the great achieve- 
ments of the Pioneers in the settle- 



ment of these valleys, proud of the 
homes that they made, and were able 
to make possible for succeeding 
generations. I am proud of my 
connection with the Church, that I 
am permitted to work in the service 
of the Lord, that He has given me 
the inspiration of His Spirit to the 
extent that I have been able to see 
the folly of evil and eschew it to a 
degree, that I have a disposition to 
seek and to enjoy His favor and 
blessings. I call to mind this mo- 
ment the way in which we may do 
this, as set forth beautifully in an- 
other epistle of the Apostle Paul, 
written to the Ephesians, wherein 
he exhorts that people to be fully 
prepared against every evil that 
may be brought against them : 

"Finally, brethren, be strong in the 
Lord, and in the power of His might. 
Put on the whole armor of God, that 
ye may be able to stand against the 
wiles of the devil; for we wrestle not 
against flesh and blood, but against 
principalities, against powers, against 
the rulers of the darkness of this 
world, against spiritual wickedness in 
high places. Wherefore take unto you 
the whole armor of God, that ye may 
be able to withstand in the evil day, 
and having done all, to stand. Stand, 
therefore, having your loins girt about 
with truth, and having on the breast- 
plate of righteousness, and your feet 
shod with the preparation of the gos- 
pel of peace; above all, taking the 
shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be 
able to quench all the fiery darts of 
the wicked; and take the helmet of 
salvation, and the sword of the spirit, 
which is the word of God, praying 
always with all prayer and supplica- 
tion in the spirit, and watching there- 
unto with all perseverance and sup- 
plication for all saint's." 

This is the measure of safety that 
is offered in the Gospel of the Lord 
Jesus Christ. This is the armor with 
which we should be encased, and be- 
ing thus equipped we may go forth

fearlessly and boldly, without fear, 
shunning sin, death and destruction. 

My brethren and sisters, I bear 
testimony of the truthfulness of this 
work, that the Gospel is the power 
of God unto salvation, and that 
within it are all that my nature and 
disposition and character require, 
for in it I find a solace for every re- 
quirement of my soul. To it I look 
for the alleviation of every suffer- 
ing, and in it I find the most perfect 
satisfaction of the higher aspirations 
of life. 

May the Lord help us to live so 
that eventually we may merit and 
attain to eternal lives in His king- 
dom, I humbly pray in the name of 
Jesus. Amen. 

A quartette was rendered by male 
members of the choir. 

ELDER JOHN W. HAM. 

(President of Rigby Stake.) 

My brethren and sisters, I can 
assure you that I approach this duty 
this afternoon with fear and 
trembling; not that I am fearful 
of receiving any bodily harm from 
any who are here assembled, but 
I in my weakness feel that I am not 
competent to fill as I should this 
position that I have been called un- 
to. I can assure you that, while I 
occupy this position, I rely upon 
your faith and prayers, and the 
aid of the Spirit of the Lord, that 
I may be led to say something that 
will be beneficial to us all. 

We have assembled from differ- 
ent parts of the land to attend this 
conference; yea, we have gathered 
from the north, from the south, 
from the east and from the west, 
and have come up here to the head- 
quarters of the Church that we 



might receive and be edified by the 
Lord through His servants. I for 
one feel that I have already been 
well repaid for the journey that I 
have made, and the time I have 
spent, by the instructions received, 
and the good time that I have en- 
joyed thus far and I am satisfied 
that we will continue to enjoy the 
blessings of the Lord thoughout 
the balance of this conference. 

As has been stated by Apostle 
Joseph F. Smith, Jun., I hail from 
the land of the north, and I am 
pleased to state to you, my brethren 
and sisters, that the people in that 
section of the country are growing 
spiritually, and that they are a 
prosperous, happy, and contented 
people. The Lord is blessing us 
both temporally and spiritually, and 
we are growing wonderfully. The 
membership of the Church of 
Christ in the State of Idaho num- 
bers about 60,000 souls. I believe, 
if I am not mistaken, there are now 
thirteen stakes of Zion in Idaho, 
and we are still growing and in- 
creasing rapidly, and this we are 
thankful for. 

I think it is fitting that we should 
assemble in great numbers upon 
occasions of this kind, that we may 
exchange views, that we might 
understand thoroughly and more 
fully the conditions that prevail 
throughout this Church in various 
parts of the land. I am greatly 
interested in the progress of this 
work; I have labored in it a little 
all the days of my life. I thank 
the Lord that He has given me a 
testimony, that He has given me of 
His spirit to such an extent that my 
feet thus far have been kept safe 
in the Gospel path. I know that 
this Gospel is true, and I am satis- 
fied that if we will live its princi- 
ples we will gain for ourselves an 



66 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



exaltation in the kingdom of our 
Father. We find upon investi- 
gation that this great organization 
of ours has within it everything 
that is needful for the welfare, 
happiness, and advancement of 
mankind here upon the earth, and 
above all it has that saving power 
that will enable us to attain eternal 
life, if we are faithful unto the end. 

I remember a few years ago a 
gentleman came into the stake over 
which I preside, and he was repre- 
senting a fraternal organization, 
and he came to me and wanted to 
know the reason why Latter-day 
Saints were opposed to "fraternal- 
ism," as he represented it. I told 
him that we were not opposed to 
f raternalism ; that as Latter-day 
Saints we believe in it, we regard it 
as a glorious principle, and practice 
it in its entirety ; but, "so far as 
your organization is concerned," I 
said, "we feel that we have all the 
blessings, all the privileges within 
the organization of our Church that 
you have to offer, and more too; 
and, as a consequence, we advise 
our people against identifying 
themselves with your organization. 
This was astounding to him ; he 
could not understand how it was 
possible. I told him that we had 
within our Church organization, 
from the Primary Association to 
the Relief Society, that which pro- 
moted the welfare of all the people, 
both old and young, giving the 
young sufficient opportunities for 
social enjoyment, and that they 
could receive all the wholesome en- 
tertainment and blessings that they 
could receive in any organization 
that was created by men here upon 
the earth within their own church. 
I told him that our people believe in 
principles of true fraternalism. 
When I informed him concerning 



the Relief Society, and what they 
are doing, he was most astonished 
to learn that such conditions and 
organizations exist in the Church ot 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 
I went on further and told him that 
I considered our system the most 
perfect in the world today; that as 
Latter-day Saints we paid dues, 
even as members of his order paid 
their dues, that we paid tithing ac- 
cording to what we possessed ; the 
rich in accordance with their plenty, 
the poor in accordance to their abil- 
ity ; that the blessings and the priv- 
ileges of membership were enjoyed 
equally by all, rich and poor. I said 
there is no organization on the face 
of the earth today that has within 
it such a just principle as we have 
got in our Church, and that consid- 
ering these things in connection 
with a great many other things we 
enjoy, it makes my heart rejoice to 
know that I am a Latter-day Saint. 
It gives me pleasure to defend this 
Church,, and I have always taken 
pleasure in doing so. I have always 
made friends by taking this course, 
and so will every Latter-day Saint. 

I can say with the Apostle Paul, 
"I am not ashamed of the Gospel, 
for it is the power of God unto sal- 
vation to every one that will receive 
and obey the principles of the 
same." There is no reason why we 
should be ashamed. It should be a 
pleasure and satisfaction to stand 
up against unscrupulous men who 
endeavor to tear us down. The 
Lord will sustain us in doing this ; 
and I testify to you that it will help 
us in our business affairs if we will 
take a manly and consistent stand 
for this great work in which we 
are engaged ; I know that the Lord 
will bless us. My testimony to you 
is that the Lord lives, that He has 
revealed His mind and will unto 



ELDER MARK AUSTIN. 



67 



His prophets in this dispensation, 
and is doing it today. I have faith 
and confidence in those who preside 
•over this church, and I know that 
the Lord will give them His Spirit, 
that they will be able to guide and 
direct the affairs of this Church in 
a way that will be acceptable in His 
sight. I pray that this may always 
be our condition, in the name of 
Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER MARK AUSTIN. 

(President of Fremont Stake.) 

I have no desire, my brethren and 
sisters, to detract from your minds 
the theme of this conference that 
was made known to the Latter-day 
Saints in the opening address of our 
beloved President, the Lord's 
prophet unto Israel, and His 
mouth-piece unto all the children of 
men who dwell upon the face of the 
earth. This is my understanding — 
as it has been throughout all time, 
when the Lord has had a prophet 
upon the earth, He has revealed 
His mind and will concerning His 
people. His children everywhere, 
whether they belonged to the 
church or not. 

I think the subject of President 
Smith's remarks is one of the most 
important things, for the salvation 
of men while they live, that has 
been given to us. "How can we 
hope to have the Spirit of the Al- 
mighty abide in unholy taber- 
nacles?" Assuredly it will not, 
therefore we see the necessity of 
being admonished, having the sub- 
ject brought strongly to our atten- 
tion. When I came into the Taber- 
nacle I heard a brother, who evi- 
dently is somewhat weak, remark : 
"I am afraid those statements are 
too strong." Strong! Can truth 



be stated too strong? Can we have 
called to our attention too strongly 
the truth upon questions connected 
with which our very lives hang in 
the balance? The drinker, the 
smoker, and other weak men and 
women object to strong denuncia- 
tion of their weaknesses. All man- 
kind need to observe the Word of 
Wisdom, and if the world would 
adopt this fragment of the Gospel 
that has been given through the 
prophet Joseph, what a relief would 
follow, how much sorrow would be 
taken from homes, from mothers, 
from fathers, and children, because 
of those who foolishly indulge in 
harmful things. 

Just recently a gentleman who 
was carrying a great deal of re- 
sponsibility in a business way, has 
many things within his charge, said 
to me : "I read sometime ago the 
Word of Wisdom, and I have 
adopted it into my life, and it has 
made me strong." The splendid 
body that had been given to him by 
sturdy Scotch parents he had found 
was weakening by indulging in 
things forbidden by the Word of 
Wisdom. Said he, "When I had 
observed this Word of Wisdom for 
two years, I found I was stronger 
than ever before in my life, my 
brain is clearer, and I am able to 
accomplish much work." If men 
outside of this Church have obeyed 
this law, how much more should 
we as Latter-day Saints observe it ! 
I have noticed that most of the Lat- 
ter-day Saints who have observed 
this law are able to stand against 
the tempter in other ways, and are 
not liable to fall and be led away. 
Those who ignore the Word Wis- 
dom feel that it is only a small 
thing. It may appear small to 
them but it is really great, and is 
calculated to overcome the power 



68 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



of evil that tries to destroy the race. 

Now, the people of the world are 
beginning to discover these things, 
many of them, and how strange it 
is that some Latter-day Saints have 
not yet obeyed the principles of 
that important revelation ! Parents 
should be examples to their children 
in regard to these matters. The 
Prophet of God, as true Proph- 
ets always have, exhibited great 
boldness, and spoke plainly to the 
people. That is what we need, we 
do not want to be sustained in 
things that lead down to sorrow 
and destruction. 

I pray that the Lord will bless 
us and help us to understand our 
mission in the earth, that we may be 
able to be bold in the defense of 
truth and righteousness. President 
Hart has set us a good example in 
this respect. You remember read- 
ing in the newspapers that when he 
was sitting in the Senate at Boise, 
a gentleman had the audacity to 
attack his religion. He rose in his 
seat, and rebuked him, and notified 
the Senate that never would he 
stand for it. The result was that 
all the members of that senate re- 
spect him, and all our people love 
him for it. May God bless you. 
Amen. 

ELDER GEORGE H. BRIMHALL. 

(President of Brigham Young Uni- 
versity.) 

I am full of gratitude for the 
blessings that have come to me from 
my fathers and my mothers, both in 
heaven and on earth. I feel as I 
nearly always feel in the presence of 
an assembly of my brethren and sis- 
ters, that I need their faith and pray- 
ers ; and if I get these I shall not 



have any occasion to ask for your at- 
tention. You have not come here to 
hear me. You have come here to 
hear the word of the Lord, and if I 
have been called by authority to be 
the instrument, feeble and unworthy 
as I am, why, the Lord will' 'be. 
praised for anything that I may say,, 
and it will depend upon Him and 
you. 

During the remarks made at the 
opening of this conference, by Presi- 
dent Smith, I was led to reflect, and 
I felt very keenly that he was actu- 
ated by the spirit of boldness and 
courage that came from his calling,, 
reinforced by our Father. He did 
not ask what would increase his 
good favor among this people. He 
evidently had but one thought, and 
that thought was akin to that which 
inspired the Prophet Brigham when 
the question came up as to who was 
to lead the Church, and he remarked 
"I do not care who leads this 
Church, even though it were Ann 
Lee, but one thing I must know, and 
that is what God says about it." 
And President Smith has but one 
consideration, "What is the will of 
the Lord concerning this people," 
and He has given it to us — the wih 
of the Lord. There is a passage of 
scripture in one of the revelations, 
wherein the Lord says : 

"Inasmuch as My people build an 
house unto Me in the name of the Lord, 
and do not suffer any unclean thing to 
come unto it that it he not defiled. My 
glory shall rest upon it." 

Some evil person might have 
come into that house, some apos- 
tate, some enemy might have 
sneaked in. Our great Temple here 
has been invaded by evil persons- 
getting in there and taking pictures,. 



ELDER GEORGE H, BRIMHALL.

thievfcs as they were ; but it was not 
suffered. You did not consent to 
it; I did not consent to it; the au- 
thorities did not consent to it. Hence 
.it could not be said that we suffered 
or permitted these things. President 
Smith can not sanction anything in 
Zion that will pollute her. 

We sang here today, "Let the 
mountains shout for joy ;" and when 
that hymn was being sung I recalled 
a circumstance of last year when 
sixty-five eminent scientists were 
our guests. We were very desirous 
that they should know the truth 
concerning the character of our peo- 
ple, and we attempted to tell them 
the truth, when one of them said, 
"Don't talk, the mountains shout for 
you. See the canals at their base. 
The ground echoes the thoughts and 
character of your people. See the 
orchards, see the harvests, the fields ; 
look at your buildings ; they cry out 
what you are. ft all speaks for you, 
and it gives the lie to all that has 
been said about you as a bad peo- 
ple." I thought in my soul, verily 
the prophecy is being fulfilled which 
said that the mountains should melt 
away. I believe in the literal melt- 
ing away of the mountains of ice at 
the coming of the Ten Tribes from 
the North ; but I believe also it may 
have a figurative meaning— the 
mountains of prejudice melting 
away before this people. I believe 
what the young missionary said 
when the minister said to him, 
"Why, you have Moses and the 
Prophets : why not listen to them ?" 
He turned and said to him, "I would 
have you understand that Wilford 
Woodruff, in his place, is as great 
a prophet as Moses ever dared to 
be.'' I too believe that about Presi- 
dent Woodruff. I believed that 
when. I heard him say, during the 



time we were dedicating the Temple 
here, "From this date this people 
will begin to prevail among the na- 
tions of the earth." We, through 
the action of our fathers and our 
mothers had prevailed against the 
desert. We had prevailed against 
persecution. We had prevailed 
against the insidious inroads of vice, 
and we had produced a community 
of which God could say, through 
His Prophet, when that glorious 
house was finished, "They shall now 
prevail against the prejudices of the 
world." Have we done it? Think 
where we then stood politically. 
Think where we stood financially. 
Think where we stood educationally, 
at the time that prophecy was made ; 
and then think where we stand now. 
Why, we through our proselyting 
are now confronted with ministers 
congregating and crying out, "We 
are powerless. Some laws must be 
enacted against these 'Mormon' 
elders." Is that prevailing? The 
"Mormons" have been branded — 
the Latter-day Saints — as an igno- 
rant people. What is the condition 
today? Ask the college presidents 
of this and other nations about those 
of our number who are or have been 
away studying. Who would have 
said, who would have dared to say 
ten years ago, that one of the great- 
est universities in the United States 
would send to the Brigham Young 
University for one of its "Mormon" 
boy professors to come back to Chi- 
cago and occupy a professor's chair ? 
And when our boys go out, they ob- 
serve something that makes us think. 
One returned a few weeks ago. He 
said, "We are on the map educa- 
tionally." It was said of him : "You 
are from the Brigham Young Uni- 
versity?" "Yes." Of another it 
was said, "You are from the B. Y. 
College," and so on. 



70 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Brothers and sisters, we are pre- 
vailing. Why are we prevailing in 
Zion? We are prevailing because 
we have refused to suffer Zion to be 
defiled. Zion cannot be defiled, be- 
cause the Prophet of God will never 
consent, and there never has been, 
and there never will be, an official 
assent to the inroad of any iniquity 
among this people. As long as there 
is always an official phalanx stand- 
ing up and refusing official sanction 
to the admittance of any evil in this 
Church, then Zion, the organization 
that God has established, cannot be 
defiled. "Individuals may be de- 
filed," as Brother Maeser used to 
say. "The Lord has said that this 
kingdom shall never fail ; but he has 
never said that I shall never fail." 

There is Zion, the pure in heart. 
There is Zion, this continent. There 
is Zion, the organization of the 
Church of God. Zion is glorious. 
Zion is the bride of Christ. Zion is 
that which we should defend. She 
is a ship of eternal state, and I am 
so glad, so happy to be a part of that 
great thing called Zion. 

Our President yesterday took the 
proper stand in refusing to let Zion 
be defiled. Now what is my mis- 
sion? To go to my place, back to 
the Brigham Young University, and 
say to our force of teachers, we shall 
still refuse anything admittance into 
this school that will defile Zion. 
What is my duty next? To go to 
my own home, and do the same 
thing. To the bishops and the presi- 
dents of stakes I have nothing to 
say. They know they are the most 
responsible men in the Church under 
the general authorities. I know 
what is to be done. I know that if 
nothing had been done in this con- 
ference, but to listen to the word of 
the Lord yesterday, Israel would be 
well repaid. God bless you. Amen. 



EIDER JOSEPH F. SMITH, JB. 

Lives of faithful Church members con- 
sistent with Gospel — Professed Chris- 
tian ministers inconsistently repudiate 
Christ's mission — Inspiration manifest 
in our leaders — Saints should be 
united, and labor for welfare of others. 

I certainly would have been 
pleased if our brethren had felt dis- 
posed to occupy the remaining time. 
I have rejoiced in their testimonies, 
in what they have had to say by way 
of admonition and encouragement 
to the Latter-day Saints. I feel that 
we have had a most excellent time so 
far during this conference. The ad- 
monition, the advice, the instruction 
imparted, have been for our good 
individually and collectively, and I 
feel that it should sink deep into our 
souls. We should feel to rejoice in 
such teachings as we receive in this 
dispensation ; teachings that are up- 
lifting and will make us better not 
only as members of the Church but 
better as citizens in the community. 
There is nothing in the Gospel of 
Jesus Christ that is not uplifting. 
There never was and never will be 
advice given to the Latter-day 
Saints from their leaders that will 
not be for their good, for our lead- 
ers have but one desire, and that is 
the salvation of the people, both 
temporally and spiritually. 

We ought to rejoice in the Gospel 
of Jesus Christ, because it is • the 
truth revealed again. We are not 
walking in darkness. We are not 
led by blind leaders who have taken 
to themselves authority and prerog- 
atives which do not belong to them ; 
but we are led by and directed 
through the spirit of inspiration, and 
it behooves each one of us as mem- 
bers of the Church to heed the 
warning voice and follow the in- 
struction that is given at our confer- 



ELDER JOSEPH F. SMITH, JR.

ences. We are, notwithstanding our 
weaknesses, the best people in the 
world. I do not say that boastingly, 
for I believe that this truth is evi- 
dent to all who are willing to ob- 
serve for themselves. We are mor- 
ally clean, in every way equal, and 
in many ways superior to any other 
people. The reason is that we have 
received the truth, the Gospel of the 
Lord Jesus Christ. It is not to us 
a dead letter, something perhaps to 
be followed on the Sabbath day and 
forgotten on the six other days of 
the week : but our religion is an 
every-day religion. We are expect- 
ed to live in accordance with the 
principles of truth every day of our 
lives ; for these principles are just 
as true in the middle of the week as 
they are on the Sabbath day. I be- 
lieve, further, that the Latter-day- 
Saints are the only people who are 
consistent in their belief, and prac- 
tice. We accept Jesus as the Re- 
deemer of the world without qualifi- 
cation, and that is not done gener- 
ally in the world, among those who 
■profess to believe in Him and call 
themselves Christians. Even among 
many ministers who affix to their 
names the title of reverend, He is 
not accepted as the Redeemer of 
mankind. They are not consistent, 
because they do not teach and they 
do not practice the principles that 
have been set forth by the Savior, 
and which are recorded in the scrip- 
tures. Men stand up before the peo- 
ple in the congregations of the so- 
called Christian communities, and 
declare that they do not accept 
Christ as the Redeemer of the 
world. They teach the people that 
they do not believe in the resurrec- 
tion from the dead. They do not 
.even accept the eternal resurrection 
of the Christ. They do not believe 
that He came into the world to take 



upon Him the sins of the world and 
redeem us from out sins. They 
scoff at the idea that He had power 
to offer Himself a sacrifice for the 
sins of others. They deny the mira- 
cles that the Savior performed, and 
say they do not believe in them. 
They call themselves progressive, 
and declare that they have received 
greater light, greater understand- 
ing, greater development through 
their researches, through their study 
and their own wisdom, by which 
they have come to the conclusion 
that these things recorded in the 
scriptures are fables, and were writ- 
ten in a day when the people were 
inclined to believe and accept as 
miracles things which did not and 
could not occur. 

I am just simple enough in my 
belief to accept that which is record- 
ed in the scriptures. I believe it 
with all my heart. I know that 
Jesus is the Christ, that He did 
come into the world to redeem the 
world from sin, and that men 
through acceptance of the principles 
of the Gospel — those principles 
which were taught at the opening of 
our conference — will receive a re- 
ward and an exaltation in the king- 
dom of our God. I know that salva- 
tion does not come through any 
other name than that of Jesus Christ, 
and that any man who will not obey 
the principles of truth as Christ set 
them forth in His Gospel will not 
receive the remission of sins, and 
cannot enter into the kingdom which 
is prepared. for the righteous. 

I desire to read a little from one 
of the revelations given to the 
Prophet Joseph Smith: 

''Therefore, whosoever belongreth to 
my Church need not fear, for such 
shall inherit the kingdom of heaven. 
But, it is they who do not fear me, 
neither keep my commandments, but

build up churches unto themselves to 
get gain, yea, and all those that do 
wickedly and build up the kingdom of 
the devil; yea, verily, verily I say unto 
you, that it is they that I will disturb, 
and cause to tremble and shake to the 
center. Behold, I am Jesus Christ', the 
Son of God. I came unto my own, 
and my own received me not. I am 
the light which shineth in darkness, 
and the darkness comprehendeth it 
not. I am He who said, other sheep 
have I which are not of this fold, unto 
my disciples, and many there were 
of the house of Jacob. And I will 
show unto this people that I had other 
sheep, and that they were a branch 
of the house of Jacob. And I will 
bring to light their marvelous works, 
which they did in my name. Yea, and 
1 will also bring to light my Gospel 
which was ministered unto them, and, 
behold, they shall not deny that which 
you have received, but they shall build 
it up, and shall bring to light the true 
points of my doctrine, yea, and the 
only doctrine which is in me. And 
this I do that I may establish my 
Gospel, that there may not be so much 
contention; yea, Satan doth stir up the 
hearts of the people to contention con- 
cerning the points of my doctrine; and 
in these things they do err, for they 
do wrest the scriptures and do not 
understand them. Therefore, I will 
unfold unto them this great mystery. 
For, behold, I will gather them as a 
hen gathereth her chickens under her 
wings, if they will not harden their 
hearts. Yea, if they will come, they 
may, and partake of the waters of life 
freely. Behold, this is my doctrine: 
whosoever repenteth and cometh unto 
me, the same is my church. Whoso- 
ever declareth more or less than this, 
the same is not of me, but is against 
me; therefore he is not of my church. 
And now, behold, whosoever is of my 
church, and endureth of my church to 
the end, him will I establish upon my 
rock, and the gates of hell shall not 
prevail against him." 

Now, there are those who declare 
more or less than this. They will 
not repent of their sins. They will 
not accept Jesus as the Redeemer of 
the world. They will not believe 
that He spoke the truth when .He 



declared unto the people that He 
was the Son of God, and that He . 
came to fulfill the mission that was 
given to Him of His Father, to re- 
deem the world from sin. They re- 
ject these things. They will not be- 
lieve them ; hence they remain in 
the bondage of sin, and cannot be 
redeemed, because they will not re- 
ceive the principles by which salva- 
tion comes. There are many of this 
class that go around through the 
country, stirring up the hearts of the 
people against the truth, declaring 
that these things are not so, and that 
it is unnecessary for men to observe 
these principles, and ordinances that 
are declared in the scriptures to be 
essential to salvation. They are de- 
stroying the faith of the people 
wherever it is possible. But we 
should be strong in the faith; each 
one of us should be filled with a de- 
termination to serve the Lord and 
to keep His commandments, for we 
have received the light which 
shineth in darkness that comes from 
the Lord. We are not walking in 
darkness, but in the light of truth 
as it has been revealed. There is no 
occasion for the memhers of the 
Church to go astray, to disregard 
the principles of the Gospel, for 
they are so plain and have been set 
forth in such clearness, that none 
need stumble or be in doubt con- 
cerning them. It is necessary that 
we should keep them in mind con- 
stantly, living worthily before the 
Lord, that we may receive His 
blessings. 

Now, at this conference we have 
heard a great deal concerning the 
duties of the members of the 
Church, the responsibilities resting 
upon those who have been called to 
hold the priesthood and who hold 
positions of trust and of presidency ' 
among the people, whether it be in 



ELDER JOSEPH F. SMITH, JR. 



73 



the stakes, the wards, the quorums 
of the priesthood or other organi- 
zations. We have been instructed 
concerning our duties, how there is 
work enough for all of us to do. 
There need be no idlers among us. 
We have heard all of these things, 
and we should remember them and 
put them into practice, so far as our 
duties are concerned as members of 
the Church. The blessings of the 
Gospel will not come unto us if wc 
disregard our duties and break the 
commandments of the Lord, we will 
not be blessed if we refuse to listen 
to the priesthood and will not fol- 
low the instructions that are given 
to us from time to time. We have 
officers in the Church necessarily to 
take the lead and to instruct the 
people, and they are inspired men. 
The bishops, ■ the presidents of 
stakes, the- various officers who are 
called and appointed to take charge 
of the many departments in the 
great work of the Lord are men of 
inspiration, and they have the right 
to the Spirit of the Lord, and they 
receive inspiration for their guid- 
ance and for the guidance of the 
people over whom they preside. We 
should listen to them, and obey their 
instructions. When we pray we 
should ask the Lord to pour out His 
Spirit upon the leaders in the 
Church, whether they minister as 
bishops of the wards, presidents of 
stakes, or in the presidency of the 
Church. We should not pray merely 
with our lips : but in every act, in 
our conversation, in all that we un- 
dertake to do, we should try to 
carry out the expressions of our 
prayers, and be in harmony with the 
thoughts that we declare to the 
Lord in our daily supplications. 

The Lord will bless Zion. He 
will pour out His Spirit upon the 
people. He will prosper them if 



they will remember Him, if they 
will keep His commandments, if 
they will observe the covenants that 
they have made Him and not vio- 
late them ; if they will hold them- 
selves aloof from the world, and not 
be partakers of the sins of the 
world. I do not mean to say that 
we ought not to associate at any 
time with those not of our faith, for 
there are many good people who 
have not embraced the Gospel. We 
are not required to avoid them, for 
our mission in the world is with 
them, to convert them to the truth if 
we can. Rut we need not be par- 
takers of the sins of the world; we 
need not follow the- foolish fashions 
of the world. We need not corrupt 
ourselves because many in the world 
are corrupt. We have received bet- 
ter things. We are walking in the 
knowledge and the understanding 
of the Gospel of the Lord Jesus 
Christ, and are entitled to that in- 
spiration which will warn us of 
danger and guide us in the path of 
duty, and give -us power to resist 
and overcome evil. We have the 
right to call upon the Lord in prayer 
and in faith for help, for guidance, 
for the assistance of His Holv 
Spirit, and we will receive it. And 
I pray that we may be true to our 
covenants, true to each other; that 
we will cast out of our hearts all 
that is evil, that we will not speak 
evil one of another, or be given to 
backbiting or contention or strife, 
for the spirit of wickedness destroys 
faith and tends to divide and separ- 
ate instead of uniting and strength- 
ening the people. We must stand 
united as one — our purposes are the 
same, our aims are the same. We 
are laboring in the direction of eter- 
nal life and progression. There is 
no variance among the teachers in 
Israel concerning the principles of 



74

the Gospel. W e are united concern- 
ing these things. There is no di- 
vision among the authorities, and 
there need be no division among the 
people ; but unity, peace, brotherly 
love, kindness and fellowship one to 
another. These are the blessings 
that we are entitled to, if we will 
live in accordance with the Gospel, 
and the Lord will pour out other 
and greater blessings, even all that 
we are able to contain. I pray that 
we will keep the commandments of 
the Lord, be diligent in the dis- 
charge of our duties, and each one 
labor, not merely for his personal 
salvation but in the interests of the 
entire community and the salvation 
of the children of men. This is my 
prayer in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 

The choir sang the anthem, "Send 
out Thy light;" Sister Nellie Parr 
rendered the solo. 

Benediction was pronounced by 
Elder Stephen L. Chipman. 



OUTDOOR MEETING. 

A meeting was held in front of 
the Bureau of Information, at 2 
p. m. Elder George F. Richards 
presided, and the Liberty stake male 
chorus sang the musical selections. 

The hymn, "Nearer to Thee," 
was rendered by the male singers. 

Prayer was offered by Elder 
Israel Call. 

"The wondrous cross" was sung 
by the male choir. 

ELDER NEFHI L. MORRIS. 

(President of Salt Lake Stake.) 

The fact that we are forced to 
hold an open-air meeting is a source 
of gratification to me, and must be 



to you all when you consider that 
the spacious Tabernacle and As- 
sembly Hall are not commodious 
enough to hold the hosts of Israel 
who have assembled to hear the 
word of the Lord. It is indeed a 
glorious and marvelous change 
since the day when our enemies pre- 
dicted that the death of Joseph 
Smith would bring about the end 
of "Mormonism." Through the 
machinations of evil and designing 
men he became a martyr like many 
prophets before him, but it did not 
place the period to "Mormonism." 
Our enemies then foretold the end 
of our Church with the death of 
Brigham Young, but it does not ap- 
pear today as though the death of 
either of our first great leaders had 
brought the end of "Mormonism," 
or in any way hindered its growth. 
For indeed, "Mormonism" has not 
only increased steadily in member- 
ship, but has become a more and 
more important factor in the better- 
ment of mankind. I am thankful to 
be one who, by the kind providence 
of God has espoused that cause. 

I am reminded of a prediction 
made by the Prophet Joseph Smith, 
when he stood by the side of a little 
jail, which had at one time held 
him and some of his brethren as 
prisoners. He prophesied that the 
Saints would continue to suffer 
many persecutions, and that they 
would be driven west ; many of 
them should die because of the 
hardships and vicissitudes through 
which they should pass, and that 
they should build many cities and 
towns and become a mighty people 
in the midst of the Rocky Moun- 
tains. That was in the year 1842. 
Scarcely seventy-five years have 
elapsed, and we see a remarkable 
fulfillment of the prophecy. Do not 
these Rocky Mountain states, with 



ELDER NEPHI L. MORRIS. 



75 



their million of prosperous people, 
afford a complete fulfillment of that 
prophecy ? 

I do not know that we have any 
real enemies today. I have heard 
of a million women, (the W. C. T. 
U.), who wanted to do us some 
harm on different occasions, but I 
think their animosities have arisen 
out of their ignorance, because their 
minds have been pre j diced against 
the Latter-day Saints. I believe the 
world has grown more and more to 
an appreciation of the Latter-day 
Saints through the fruits of their 
social, industrial and religious ef- 
forts. 1 believe no man of modern 
civilization, not blinded by bigotry, 
would undertake to break down, or 
even limit the efficacy of "Mormon- 
ism" for human service. "Mor- 
monism" has brought into existence 
in this great western country one or 
two generations of men that com- 
pare most favorably with the man- 
hood of the country at large. "Mor- 
monism," by its practical views and 
activities, has given to our nation 
this splendid country, teeming with 
its wealth and treasure, and its in- 
finite possibilities. "Mormonism" 
has given to society, to the state, 
and the nation, thousands of splen- 
did, patriotic, intelligent and force- 
ful men and women that have been 
a distinct asset to the great national 
life. None but the bigot, the nar- 
row-minded would undertake to re- 
strain or crush an institution which 
can contribute so generously to the 
public welfare. 

What has been the dominating 
power, the element of strength in 
holding together this people? The 
Prophet Joseph Smith was once 
asked the question, how it was that 
he governed his people so well. His 
reply was, "I teach them correct 
principles and they govern them- 



selves." This has been fundamental 
with the Latter-day Saints. It has 
been stated by those who would de- 
tract from us, that " 'Mormonism' 
thrives best where ignorance 
abounds." There could be nothing 
farther from the truth than this 
statement, and I speak as one on the 
inside, one born and reared in 
"Mormonism" and more or less ac- 
tive in its various institutions. I 
have grown through years of ser- 
vice, small though it may be, to re- 
gard "Mormonism" as a gigantic 
institution of education. If you will 
take time and pains to study the or- 
ganizations of the "Mormon" peo- 
ple, I think you will agree with me 
in this idea, viz., that all the teach- 
ing and institutional work of the 
"Mormon" Church is educative in 
the broadest and highest sense. 

The great mission of the Church 
is to carry the message of truth to 
man, and teach him to live in con- 
formity to that truth for his present 
and eternal welfare. 

Aside from that great office of 
the Church, which it performs most 
splendidly, the organizations within 
the Church, which have been desig- 
nated "helps in government," con- 
tribute as auxiliary institutions to 
the great undertaking. The first 
auxiliary organization of the 
Church was established in the days 
of the Prophet and is known as the 
Woman's Relief Society. For over 
half a century it has ministered to 
the relief and comfort of the poor, 
the sick and the unfortunate. There 
is no more beautiful work in all the 
world than that done in the name of 
"sweet charity." 

The Relief Society sisters con- 
tribute systematically to the blessing 
of mankind wherever the Church 
is organized, without regard to race, 
creed or color. They hold regular 



76 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



meetings, with courses of study, 
choosing such subjects as will help 
them to become better wives and 
mothers, daughters and sisters, and 
more useful members of the com- 
munity. Anything which makes for 
the refinement and preservation of 
the woman, the mother, the wife, is 
certainly a source of strength and 
power and virtue. Surely this is a 
work no one will undertake to de- 
stroy. It is a work which repre- 
sents effort, expenditure of means 
and time and the betterment of all 
who participate in the work, as well 
as the benefit and blessings of those 
who are administered to. And be- 
hind it all is the element of educa- 
tion, the men and women thus en- 
gaged become more proficient in the 
service of their kind. 

Then we have the Sunday School, 
of which we may be justly proud, 
for I believe it surpasses all similar 
organizations in the world in point 
of efficiency and membership. One 
hundred fifty thousand children and 
men and women are enrolled in this 
splendid organization. They meet 
every Sunday morning, divide into 
their various grades and depart- 
ments with trained teachers in 
charge of each class, who instruct 
them in those . subjects which are 
best adapted for the physical, moral 
and spiritual welfare. 

It is primarily a system of educa- 
tion. "Where ignorance abounds, 
'Mormonism' thrives?" It is exact- 
ly the reverse. The main strength 
of "Mormonism" lies in the intelli- 
gence of its members, and every in- 
stitution in the Church aims at their 
education. Do you not know this to 
be true? Take the Young Men's 
Mutual Improvement Association, 
with from thirty to forty thousand 
members. They meet weekly to dis- 
cuss such subjects as will make 



them better citizens, better members 
of their Church, and better mem- 
bers of society. Are these the means 
which would be employed by an in- 
stitution that wished to keep its 
members in ignorance? Then there 
is the Young Ladies' Mutual Im- 
provement Association, numbering 
sixty-five thousand, where the ladies 
assemble at least once a week to 
study domestic arts, science, litera- 
ture, history, and everything that 
will tend to make of them a higher 
and more refined type of woman- 
hood. Then you have the Primary 
Association, where once a week, or 
oftener, young ladies of scholastic 
training meet in the meetinghouse 
or in the schoolhouse, where it is 
permitted, and there teach the little 
children the first principles of ser- 
vice to mankind, and reverence for 
God. And then comes the last of 
our institutions, known as the Re- 
ligion Class Work. 

The moral education of the youth 
is one of the most serious problems 
which is presented to the educators 
of our nation. The Bible has been 
tabooed for many years. I am not 
advocating religious training in pub- 
lic schools, but I do believe that 
there is not sufficient moral and re- 
ligious training among the youth of 
our land today. The Latter-day 
Saints believe that children should 
be taught reverence for God and 
have developed in their hearts faith 
in Him, and a comprehension of 
their obligation even as children to 
God. Therefore the "Mormon" 
people have established this Religion 
Class Work to promote faith and 
moral growth in connection with the 
education of the youth. Now then, 
under these circumstances, it occurs 
to me that this is one great gigantic 
institution of which we may all be 
proud. 



ELDER CHARLES A. ORME.

May the Lord preserve and pros- 
per this people to serve mankind and 
to promote His cause on the earth, 
is my prayer, in His name. Amen. 

ELDER CHARLES A. ORME. 

(President of Tooele Stake.) 

My brothers, sisters and friends, 
I have listened, with interest and 
rejoicing, to the discourse delivered 
by President Nephi L. Morris. I 
feel to congratulate our people on 
their achievements, on their success, 
and what they have accomplished 
and are accomplishing along an ed- 
ucational line, for the uplifting of 
the children of men, for the ad- 
vancement of the human race, for 
acquiring the high intellectual con- 
dition that our Father in Heaven 
desires His children should reach 
while they are here upon the earth, 
that we may become educated and 
qualified for the future existence it 
is destined that the children of our 
Father should attain unto. All 
throughout this conference, the 
splendid meetings and discourses 
that we have had on this Temple 
Block, the declarations of the faith 
that this people have in Israel's 
God, and the demonstration thereof 
in the works that they have pro- 
duced, show their desire to serve 
Him and to keep His command- 
ments. Think of what appeared to 
the children of men an insignificant 
organization in the beginning, with 
only six members, poorly equipped 
or qualified • to promulgate the 
truth, and destined to build up a 
marvelous missionary system in the 
future. Add to this system that 
which has been spoken of by Presi- 
dent Morris, it seems to me would 
be worthy of our consideration for 
a little while. 



In the beginning, with only six 
men to start out and face an oppos- 
ing world, nearly, all whom the 
elders came in contact with were 
opposed to that which they set 
forth. Even from the time when 
Joseph Smith the Prophet first de- 
clared the visitation of the Father 
and the Son, until the coming forth 
of the Book of Mormon, the sena 
ing forth of the first elders to preacn 
unto the people the words that had 
been given unto that youthful 
prophet, I say, to look at it from 
that beginning it would seem im- 
possible to accomplish what we have 
at the present time. Consider also 
that they had not sufficient means 
to publish to the world the record 
that had been committed into their 
hands by a holy angel, to present 
unto the world as a testimony and 
a witness that God had not confined 
His ministrations, or His prophets, 
to one hemisphere, but that it had 
been extended further. Since that 
time we have succeeded in sending 
out thousands of elders to the vari- 
ous nations of the earth, at a great 
expense, amounting to hundreds of 
thousands of dollars annually, for 
the promulgation of this Gospel. 
Many of our elders have been well 
equipped from an educational stand- 
point, and supplied with proper lit- 
erature, so that they could visit the 
homes of the rich and the learned 
in civilized nations, as well as the 
poor, and present unto them those 
glorious truths that had been re- 
vealed unto the Prophet Joseph, 
giving unto the world a new witness 
for God and for Jesus Christ. 

There had been errors creep into 
the churches that had been organ- 
ized by men, errors relating to the 
existence of God, His being and at- 
tributes. Men had no faith in the 
declaration made by Joseph Smith, 



78 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



that he had seen a vision, and that 
God had manifested Himself unto 
him, and that He was indeed a per- 
sonage like unto man, and that the 
Son was in His image and likeness, 
as the scriptures had told. But the 
minds of men had been darkened 
on this subject, and it seemed im- 
possible for them to believe his 
statement. He declared in very deed 
that he had seen God, and His Son 
Jesus Christ. The young man, fear- 
lessly desiring to discharge the duty 
that the Lord had placed upon him, 
declared that God was not, as had 
been proclaimed, without body, 
parts or passions, but that He pos- 
sesses a body, with limbs, head and 
all' parts and organs as a man has 
them. He testified that he knew 
this, for he had seen with his eyes, 
that he had heard Their voices, and 
that he had conversed with Jesus 
Christ who was crucified on Cal- 
vary, according to the testimony of 
the apostles whom He had chosen 
from among men. 

That Christ had arisen from the 
grave, and ascended bodily into 
heaven, is a fact which seems to 
have been lost sight of by the chil- 
dren of men. This young man de- 
clared that it was a fact. He was a 
witness of it for he had seen Jesus 
and the Father. He had heard 
Their voices, and this testimony had 
been given unto him, and it was his 
privilege and his duty, as a new wit- 
ness for God, to stand forth and de- 
clare unto the world, in this dis- 
pensation, those things that had 
been known in former dispensations, 
the saving powers and principles of 
the Gospel of Jesus Christ. It was 
that testimony, borne by humble 
elders, sent forth without worldly 
means, but rich in spirit and with a 
testimony that God lived, and that 
His work had been established upon 



the earth. That was what brought 
our parents and grandparents, and 
many of us, into this goodly land, 
where we are surrounded with fa- 
vorable conditions, with institutions 
for advancement and learning, that 
we have heard about this afternoon. 

I bear my testimony to the truth- 
fulness of this work, that the world 
calls "Mormonism ;" it is the big- 
gest proposition before the children 
of men today, both from a worldly 
standpoint and from a spiritual or 
religious standpoint. I make that 
statement partly on the grounds of 
the educational system that is in our 
midst, making us acquainted with 
the things of the world, with the 
science and arts of the day, the 
high accomplishments and achieve- 
ments along these lines. As for 
spiritual advancement, the greatest 
thing before the world, we believe 
in that also, and with all our hearts, 
for it deals not only with men in 
this life, for their betterment, both 
temporally and spiritually, but it 
reaches beyond the vail. We are 
informed that before this earth on 
which we live was framed, the 
spirits of men did in reality exist, 
that they were organized by the 
great Head, and He saw among 
them great and mighty spirits, 
choice men and women, as recorded 
in the Pearl of Great Price, chap- 
ter 3. Our Father in Heaven, rec- 
ognizing the intellectual greatness 
of many of those beings that had 
been organized in that spiritual 
stage of existence, remarked to 
those in the Council with Him, 
something like this : "See, here is 
space, let us go down and create an 
earth on which these spirits may 
dwell." From that we learn and 
understand that this earth was cre- 
ated and made habitable for man- 
kind, He said, "They who keep theii 



ELDER BENJAMIN GODDARD. 



79 



first estate shall be added upon ; and 
they who keep not their first estate, 
shall not have glory in the same 
kingdom with those who keep their 
first estate ; they who keep their sec- 
ond estate, shall have glory added 
upon their heads for ever and ever." 

My brothers and sisters, here is 
something for us to consider : intel- 
ligences in the beginning, before the 
organization of this earth, and this 
earth being brought into existence 
for their benefit, that they might 
become educated and qualified to be- 
come as their Father, God. The 
Savior of the world said that the 
children of men should become per- 
fect as their Heavenly Father is per- 
fect, and that they could reach that 
position by keeping the laws of God 
in these two estates. Latter-day 
Saints and all Israel should awaken 
to a realization of the condition that 
we are in here. We have obeyed 
the principles of faith and repent- 
ance, and yielded obedience to the 
doctrine of baptism in water by im- 
mersion for the remission of sins, 
and have had hands laid upon our 
heads for confirmation in the 
Church of Christ, and for the bap- 
tism of the Holy Ghost. W e should 
comprehend our true condition and 
exercise ourselves in the perform- 
ance of duty and responsibility be- 
fore our Father, for, in yielding 
obedience unto these doctrines, we 
made a covenant to serve Him for- 
ever, to keep His commandments, 
and observe all His laws. If we 
fail to do this, we shall fall short 
of the glory that has been promised 
to all the children of our Father 
who are obedient unto His com- 
mandments. 

I believe that it is easy for men 
to fall from grace, even after they 
have received the principles of the 
doctrine of Christ and become con- 



verted. I believe that they can be- 
come lukewarm, as did one of the 
Churches in olden times. The Apos- 
tle John, the Revelator, seeing their 
condition, declared that they were 
neither cold nor hot, and only wor- 
thy to be spued opt of his mouth. I 
believe, that even Latter-day Saints 
can become in that condition. We 
ought to be faithful in the payment 
of our tithes, in observing the word 
of wisdom, attending to our prayers 
and our sacrament meetings, and 
take advantage of the institution? 
of learning that have been orgamzeu 
for our benefit and education, and 
accept the revelations of our Father, 
that He has given unto the children 
of men. I pray God to strengthen 
our testimony and create within us 
a desire to serve Him unto the end, 
which I ask through Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 

The male chorus rendered a se- 
lection entitled "Just Beyond." 

ELDER BENJAMIN GODDARD. 

(President of Bureau of Information.) 

Brethren, sisters and friends, I 
have great pleasure in greeting you 
this afternoon, and trust that I 
shall enjoy the same spirit that has 
characterized the remarks of my 
brethren. If there be any strangers 
among you, from that which has 
already been said, they must be im- 
pressed with the comprehensive- 
ness of what is called "-Mormon- 
ism." Our last speaker dwelt 
briefly upon our belief in the pre- 
existence of spirits showing that 
our existence did not commence 
upon this earth, but that we were 
fore-ordained to come and dwell 
here for a season, to perform the 
mission which God had given unto 
us.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



President Morris, in his remarks 
dwelt upon the organization of the 
Church, and the auxiliary branches 
thereof, and endeavored to make 
clear to you the special work of our 
Relief Societies, our Young La- 
dies and Young Men's Mutual Im- 
provement Associations, our Pri- 
mary Associations, our Sunday 
Schools and Religion Classes, and 
the wide field of activity occupied 
by these auxiliary organizations of 
the Church, for the special benefit 
of the various members thereof. 
But the Church does not exist by 
virtue of these organizations. God 
has given unto us something more 
than auxiliary work. One of the 
brethren referred to the fact that 
the Prophet Joseph Smith received 
revelations from the Almighty. 
We declare that God the Fa- 
ther, and God the Son, appeared 
unto him in vision, and made clear 
unto him his great mission upon 
earth. In that connection he was 
assured that other messengers 
should come, who would confer up- 
on him greater powers and give 
other instructions. 

Upon this block, I have the honor 
of meeting from day to day many 
of the strangers who come among 
us. At least two hundred and fifty 
thousand visitors come to Utah each 
year many coming to this "City of 
the Saints" that they may learn 
something of our faith. I am im- 
pressed with the fact that one of the 
revelations, often referred to by our 
elders, has been fulfilled in greater 
detail than we sometimes declare, not 
only by the gathering of the Saints 
who have fulfilled to -the very let- 
ter these words, but by the coming 
of the strangers : "For it shall come 
to pass in the last days that the 
mountain of the Lord's House shall 
be exalted above the hills and all 



nations shall flow unto it, and many 
people shall go and say, Come ye, 
and let us go up to the mountain of 
the Lord, to the house of the God 
of Jacob, and He will teach us of 
His ways and we will walk in His 
paths." Although many may not 
so view it, yet they do come to learn 
something of the ways of the Al- 
mighty with regard to the work 
of this people in the Rocky Moun- 
tains. And we have pleasure in 
telling them the story that has been 
recited in your hearing, with regard 
to the commencement of this great 
work, and that subsequently another 
heavenly personage came unto the 
prophet Joseph Smith. 

We declare in all soberness that 
the revelation is true, that John the 
Baptist, who holds the keys of the 
Aaronic Priesthood, placed his 
hands upon the head of Joseph the 
Prophet and ordained him to that 
priesthood, giving him all the keys 
and authority pertaining thereto. 
And we go still further, to the 
astonishment of some who have 
never heard "Mormon" doctrines 
before. We declare that even then 
the Church was not fully organized, 
it was not organized as fully as God 
intended. They who were chosen 
by the Savior when He was en- 
gaged in His ministry upon the 
earth, they of whom He said : "Ye 
have not chosen Me, but I have 
chosen you and ordained you," even 
Peter, James and John, the resur- 
rected apostles of the Lord, Jesus 
Christ came unto that youthful 
prophet, placed their hands upon 
his head and gave unto him the au- 
thority of the Melchizedek Priest- 
hood. Now what does it mean? 
It means that the Church in the Lat- 
ter days has been organized as per- 
fectly as in former days, with 
prophets, pastors, teachers, deacons, 



ELDER BENJAMIN GODDARD. 



81 



evangelists, etc.' "for the perfecting 
of the Saints." And hence we say 
unto you, the Melchizedek Priest- 
hood has been bestowed upon the 
children of men, and there are men 
within the sound of my voice who 
hold that priesthood, High Priests, 
Seventies, Elders, who possess all 
the authority possessed by the mini- 
stry in the days of the Lord Jesus 
Christ. And there is also the Aaron- 
ic Priesthood, which we term 
sometimes the Lesser Priesthood, 
with its Priests, Teachers, and 
Deacons ministering for the salva- 
tion of men. 

Do you realize how much these 
truths have been impressed upon 
the hearts of our children ? Let me 
tell you one little circumstance that 
occured upon this block. Some- 
time ago, while glancing through 
the window, I perceived a little 
group of strangers on the steps of 
the Assembly Hall, the building op- 
posite to us. I wondered who was 
conversing with these strangers. It 
was of interest to me to find out, it 
being part of my work to observe 
that the teachings here are given by 
men and women who are authorized 
to do the work. I therefore joined 
the company. A stake conference 
was being held in the Assembly 
Hall, President Nephi L. Morris 
presiding over the meeting, but the 
group of strangers stood on the out- 
side. Mingling with them I per- 
ceived that they were being enter- 
tained by a boy, a little fellow, who 
was standing on the steps so that 
they could see and hear him. The 
strangers were asking questions : 
"Well, my boy, are you a 'Mor- 
mon'?" 

"Oh, yes sir." 

"Well, are you a minister?" 

"No, sir." 

"What are you?" 



"I am a deacon, sir." 

"What is a deacon?" 

"A deacon's office is the first in 
the Aaronic Priesthood, and I have 
to work as a deacon, and that is why 
I am at the door." 

"And what is the Aaronic Priest- 
hood?" was the question. The boy, 
not more than twelve or thirteen 
years of age, answered promptly : 

"Sir, the Aaronic Priesthood is 
the authority given by John the 
Baptist when he laid his hands upon 
the head of Joseph Smith, and it has 
come down and I have been or- 
dained a deacon, and X I hold the 
Aaronic Priesthood." 

Oh ! bless the soul of that boy. I 
don't know today who he was but 
I felt like hugging him, because of 
the testimony he was thus bearing ; 
for in the simplicity of his heart and 
by his youthful appearance he im- 
pressed those strangers so that, at 
least, they recognized the earnest- 
ness, frankness and sincerity of the 
Latter-day Saints. 

Our children understand these 
things. They are taught unto them 
and, hence, without hesitancy they 
declare that the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints is or- 
ganized, fully and completely, for 
the salvation of man in the latter 
days. When we talk to the people 
in this manner they acknowledge 
that it is a wonderful work, and as 
they gaze at the beautiful building, 
our Temple, — that monument in 
stone so eloquently spoken of yes- 
terday by Elder B. H. Roberts, they 
invariably ask "what is the building 
for?" We declare that it stands as 
a testimony of another principle 
pertaining to the Gospel of the Lord 
Jesus Christ. For we not only be- 
lieve, as President Orme has said 
"that from the eternities we were 
prepared for this probation and that 



82 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



through this probation we are to 
minister to the children of men, giv- 
ing the warning message pertaining 
to the coming of the Lord Jesus 
Christ," but we are to extend that 
mission beyond the vail. We never 
expect to be through with our work. 
We worked before we came here, 
we minister while we are living, and 
we shall minister after we are dead. 
. I remember a few friends stand- 
ing near the gates here, some years 
ago, when the President of the Min- 
isterial Association was entertaining 
them. Unobserved I joined them 
and listened a little while to the con- 
versation and then pleasantly asked, 
"My reverend friend, can I assist 
you a little?" He turned, aston- 
ished to see me, and remarked to 
his friends, "This man will tell you 
the other side of the story." "No," 
I answered, "I may not; there is 
only one side, the true side, and, in 
your ministerial garb, you surely 
would not give any other." As he 
turned away he said, "You may tell 
them what you believe in. Now be 
careful, (speaking to his compan- 
ions), or he will get you." "Now," 
I remarked, (calling him by name), 
"don't make your friends nervous, 
we shall get you by and by." "Oh ! 
no, you never will," he retorted and 
turned away angrily. "Now, my 
dear friend," I said, "be good na- 
tured. Don't forget our teachings. 
We not only preach here, but we 
shall preach to the spirits in prison, 
and follow men throughout all eter- 
nity, or until they repent of their 
sins and accept the Gospel of Christ ; 
that is our faith." The Master de- 
clared, "I. if I be lifted up, will draw 
all men unto me." Some years ago, 
Rev. Mr. Guthrie, a Scotch divine 
said, when quoting a familiar pas- 
sage of scripture referring to the 
Redeemer, "He is the propitiation 



for our sins and not for ours only 
but for the sins of the whole world." 
"The whole world. Some say that 
this is a dangerous doctrine, but it 
is God's doctrine." Just so far he 
was preaching "Mormonism," for 
(pointing to the Temple), that sa- 
cred Temple stands for the redemp- 
tion of the dead, for the ministry to 
"the spirits in prison," for the con- 
tinuation of this work beyond the 
grave. 

Let us so live, according to the 
will of God, that we may be worthy 
to minister to the living and for the 
dead, is my prayer in the name of 
Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER HUGH J. CANHON. 

(President of Liberty Stake.) 

My brethren and sisters, it seems 
to me that I was born with a testi- 
mony of "Mormonism." "Mormon- 
ism" has always appealed to me. In 
the early days of my life, this faith 
was naturally due to the teachings 
which I received from my parents. 
Later on, when I was called to go 
out into the world, of necessity I had 
to be able to give a reason for the 
hope that was within me. But never 
in my life have I doubted the divin- 
ity of this work. As has already 
been stated, the Church provides for 
every spiritual and temporal need of 
its members. 

Here in Utah we have a school 
system which is the equal of any 
system in the United States. That 
is in addition to all these auxiliary 
organizations which have been men- 
tioned, and the priesthood quorum 
work which we are doing. We have 
a system which appeals to the edu- 
cated men of the world, and they in- 
vestigate the Church and its teach- 
ings with great interest because of 



ELDER HUGH J. CANNON. 



83 



the time and attention which have 
been given to this subject. 

Brother Orme spoke about our 
belief in pre-existence. Brother 
Goddard spoke of that very briefly 
and also alluded to our belief in the 
hereafter. I desire to refer briefly 
to our present temporal condition. 
One of the greatest horticulturalist 
experts in the United States made 
the statement the other day in my 
hearing that "the horticultural ex- 
hibit at the Utah State Fair could 
not be equalled by any state in the 
United States." 1 heard the other 
day, at the dedication of this Sea- 
gull Monument, from one of the 
pioneers, that Jim Bridger had said 
when our people came here that 
there was frost every month of the 
year in this valley. In spite of that 
statement, and as we believe through 
the blessing of the Almighty upon 
this land, we are able to produce an 
exhibit, according to the testimony 
of this man, which cannot be 
equalled in the United States. There 
are certain sections outside of Utah, 
as you know, which pride them- 
selves upon their peaches ; certain 
sections which boast of their apples, 
etc. We can produce as good ap- 
ples as the best sections which spe- 
cialize on apples. We can produce 
as fine peaches, as fine prunes, as 
fine pears, as fine grapes, as can be 
produced in the sections which spe- 
cialize on these particular fruits. 
Why is it ? I give the Almighty the 
credit for it. He inspired his ser- 
vant to say, "This is the place." And 
He has blessed this land and has 
made it fruitful because His chil- 
dren that were driven from the civ- 
ilized communities were forced to 
come here and came with faith in 
Him, - and wholly dependent upon 
Him. He has blessed the land for 
their sake. 



Think what this people has done 
for years and years in its missionary 
movement alone. I figured, very 
roughly in my mind, while sitting 
here, that we are spending perhaps 
more than one million dollars a year 
to preach the Gospel in the world. 
That money is going out of this 
community, and I think that one 
million dollars would not nearly 
cover it, and especially if we put a 
reasonable price upon the time of 
the men who go abroad. It would 
take very nearly a million dollars, 
as I figured it, in cash to support 
our missionaries, and then there is 
their time which would be converted 
into means if they remained at 
home. Where can you find a com- 
munity in all the world that could 
stand year after year a drain of this 
kind? And still, what is the tem- 
poral condition of this people? I 
have not all the statistics in mind ; 
I did not expect to speak this after- 
noon, and have not had any oppor- 
tunity to get figures since I was 
asked to address you, but I believe 
that there is no community in all 
the world where the people are in 
as comfortable circumstances as 
they are in Utah. There is no com- 
munity in the world where there is 
as large a percentage of the people 
who own their homes, and whose 
homes are free from mortgages, in 
spite of the fact that we are sending 
out one million dollars annually for 
which we get no apparent returns. 
Judged from the standpoint of the 
world, not one cent of that vast sum 
spent in preaching the Gospel to the 
world ever returns to us in the shape 
of money. But the Lord has made 
up to this people for that which 
they do in this respect as well as 
in all others, and I find in it a testi- 
mony of the Gospel, just as I find a 
testimony of the Gospel in all these 



84 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



other things which have been al- 
luded to this afternoon. We have 
every reason to be proud of the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ, and I thank 
the Lord from the bottom of my 
heart that I was born in the Church, 
and that the Lord was kind enough 
to me to give me a testimony of this 
work. 

May our light so shine that the 
world will see our good works and 
glorify our Father in Heaven, is my 
prayer in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 

ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS. 

Free agency of man a Divine law — The 
latter-day Gospel, the old Gospel re- 
stored — The Priesthood also restored 
— "Mormonism" the greatest organiza- 
tion on earth. 

While there have been a great 
many people moving to and fro 
upon these grounds I have been 
pleased to note that there are hun-' 
dreds of people immediately in front 
of us who have scarcely moved out 
of their tracks during the time of 
this service. This is an evidence to 
me of the interest they have in this 
great work which we represent, and 
of which we have been speaking, 
and in the things which they have 
heard. We have a message to those 
who have not united themselves 
with the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints, a message of 
peace, of good will and of salvation, 
if they will but receive it. We 
would not if we could, force our 
views upon them and oblige .them 
to join with us in this work. One 
of Satan's objects from the begin- 
ning was to destroy the free agency 
of man. But the Son, who gave 
himself willingly as a ransom for 
the sins of the world, secured to us 
our free agency. This principle is 



represented most beautifully in one 
of our hymns which reads : 

"Know this that every soul is free, 
To choose his life and what he'll be ; 
For this eternal truth is given, 
That God will force no man to heaven ; 
He'll call, persuade, direct aright, 
And bless with wisdom, love and light ; 
In nameless ways be good and kind, 
But never force the human mind." 

As a witness for the Lord I tes- 
tify to you, my friends, that the 
things which have been spoken in 
your presence this afternoon are the 
things of God, the truth of God, 
whether you receive them or reject 
them. This is the Gospel of the 
Lord Jesus Christ, which is the 
power of God unto salvation, and a 
savor of life unto life or death unto 
death, according as it is received 
and obeyed, or as it is rejected and 
fought against. It is the Gospel 
which Enoch taught to his people 
and was made a savor of life unto 
them, because they received it with 
glad hearts, and it wrought perfec- 
tion in their lives, so that they ob- 
tained translation and salvation. It 
was a savor of death unto death 
unto the people in Noah's time, be- 
cause they rejected it and gratified 
without restraint their carnal de- 
sires to their destruction and con- 
demnation. This is the same Gos- 
pel that originated in the heavens 
before the world was. It is the 
same that was taught to our first 
parents, Adam and Eve. It is the 
same Gospel that was taught by our 
Savior and His Apostles of the 
Primitive Church. It is the Gospel 
which John the Revelator saw in 
vision, and declared as recorded in 
the 14th chapter, of Revelations : 

"And I saw another angel fly in the 
midst of heaven, having the everlasting 
Gospel to preach unto them that dwell 
upon the earth, and to every nation, and 
kindred, and tongue and people, saying: 



ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS, 



85 



with a loud voice, Fear God and give 
glory to Him; for the hour of His judg- 
ment is come; and worship Him that 
made heavens, and earth, and the sea 
and the fountains of waters." 

This Gospel has been restored to 
earth in this dispensation of the full- 
ness of times, when all things which 
have been spoken of by the mouths 
of all the holy prophets since the 
world began are to be restored in 
preparation for the great day of the 
coming of our Lord, when He is 
to take possession of His kingdom, 
and reign as King of Kings and 
Lord of Lords. It has come in the 
way that was predicted, having been 
delivered to the Prophet Joseph 
Smith by an angel ; and by the gift 
and power of God he translated the 
records of the Book of Mormon, 
which contains the Everlasting Gos- 
pel as it was taught to the ancient 
inhabitants of this continent by 
Christ our Savior, after He left His 
disciples at Jerusalem. He told 
them in going that He had other 
sheep which were not of that fold, 
that He had to visit. And He visi- 
ted the Nephite nations ; He organ- 
ized His Church, and told them 
that He had come in fulfillment of 
what He had told His disciples at 
Jerusalem. 

We have this Gospel, and there 
is just one Gospel recognized of 
God, that which He instituted in the 
heavens from the foundation of the 
world ; as Paul declared to the Gal- 
atians : "Though we or an angel 
from heaven preach any other 
Gospel unto you than that which we 
have preached unto you, let him be 
accursed ;" just the one Gospel 
which has in it the power of God 
unto salvation. In connection with 
this message of the Gospel, the Lord 
delivered to the Prophet Joseph 
Smith the keys of the Priesthood of 



Aaron, and also the keys of the 
Priesthood of the Son of God, with 
power and authority to build up 
His church and kingdom, here upon 
the earth, and authority to admi- 
ster the saving ordinances of the 
Gospel unto all who are prepared by- 
faith and repentance to receive it. 
This Gospel, in connection with the 
Church and Kingdom of God which 
has been established upon the earth 
in this dispensation, through the in- 
strumentality of the Prophet Joseph 
Smith, constitutes what is know as 
"Morrrionism" ; and it is the biggest 
thing in this world, the most im- 
portant thing with which mankind 
have to do. 

Reference has been made to the 
perfection of the organization of the 
Church ; study of the organization 
with its quorums of priesthood its 
auxiliaries and helps in government, 
and the character of the work each 
is doing, convinces one of the su- 
periorty of the organization and di- 
vinity of its origin. A few years 
ago at a Ministerial Convention 
being held in California a declara- 
tion was made by a member of that 
Association, that "The thing called 
'Mormonism' is the greatest organ- 
ization upon the earth, save possibly 
the German Army." And during 
the past summer, in a convention of 
Ministers in Portland, Oregon, one 
of those Ministers declared without 
any reservation, that "it is the great- 
est organization upon the earth." 
I bear testimony to the truth of his 
statement. 

It remains for us, my brethren 
and sisters, and friends, while here 
in mortality to receive the Gospel 
which is offered unto us gratui- 
tously, and make use of our time 
and talents is establishing ourselves 
in faith and devotion to the cause 
of God, that we may have His favor 



86 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



and His blessing in life, and that we 
may obtain, as a reward of our in- 
tegrity and faithfulness, eternal life 
in the world to come. God help us 
to these great blessings, I humbly 
pray in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 

"Thy way not mine, O Lord," 
was sung by the male choir. 

Benediction was pronounced by 
Elder Charles S. Martin. 



AFTERNOON SESSION. 

In the Tabernacle- 
Conference was resumed at 2 
p. m. 

President Joseph F. Smith called 
the meeting to order. 

The Tabernacle choir sang the 
hymn : 

Come, dearest Lord, descend and dwell, 
By faith and love, in every breast; 

Then shall we know, and taste, and feel 
The joys that cannot be expressed. 

Prayer was offered by Elder 
Franklin S. Bramwell. 
The choir sang the hymn : 

Prayer is the soul's sincere desire, 

Unuttered or expressed; 
The motion of a hidden fire 

That trembles in the breast. 

ELDER HEBER J. GRANT. 

Appreciation of words and music of 
hymns — Membership in Genealog- 
ical Society recommended — Ben E. 
Rich's successful life — Saints should 
be guided by authoritative counsel — ■ 
Gratifying recognition of worthiness 
of Latter-day Saints — Striking illus- 
trations of benefit of sustaining home 
manufactures — Spiritual power man- 
ifest in the Church today. 

"Prayer is the soul's sincere desire 

Unuttered or expressed, 
The motion of a hidden fire 

That trembles in the breast." 



That is the first verse of the hymn 
we have just listened to. The last 
verse is as follows : 

"Oh Thou by whom we come to God, 
The life, the truth, the way! 

The path of prayer, Thyself hast trod, 
Lord teach us how to pray." 

I pray earnestly and in humility 
that that same splendid spirit which 
has been manifested in all that has 
been said to us thus far in our con- 
ference may also be given to me. I 
ask earnestly an interest in the faith 
and prayers of this vast congrega- 
tion, to the end that I may be able 
to say something which may be en- 
couraging, and in its nature calcu- 
lated to benefit those who listen. I 
was not only particularly impressed 
with the beautiful sentiment in 
Montgomery's poem that we have 
just listened to but I was also im- 
pressed with the very splendid mu- 
sic. I had the same feeling this 
morning . while listening to the 
splendid poem by Sister Eliza R. 
Snow. 

"Though deepening trials throng your 
way 

Press on, press on, ye Saints of God! 
Ere long the resurrection day 
Will spread its life and light abroad." 

I was impressed also with the 
beautiful music of this hymn. Both 
of the melodies that we have lis- 
tened to having been composed by 
our fellow townsman Brother 
George Careless. I feel very grate- 
ful to the Lord, not only for the in- 
spiration that has come to the men 
and women who have written so 
many splendid things that we hear 
from time to time, but I am also 
grateful for the ability possessed by 
Brother Careless, B'rother Stephens 
and many others who furnish the 
splendid music for our hymns.

President Anthon H. Lund, Pres- 
ident Charles W. Penrose, three 
members of the council of twelve, 
and others, form a board of direc- 
tors of the Genealogical Society of 
Utah. We feel a deep interest in 
the work of this society. Classes 
have been organized where the peo- 
ple are receiving instruction in the 
work that is necessary to be done 
in 'our temples. Recently a genea- 
logical day was appointed for all the 
wards in the Church, where the 
subject should have been taken up, 
and we found, in many of the 
wards, that not one word was said 
upon this subject, thus showing a 
lack of interest and a great careless- 
ness on the part of those whose 
duty it was to arrange suitable ser- 
vices for the occasion. We heard 
here yesterday thrilling words with 
regard to the beautiful Gull monu- 
ment, in stone and in bronze, that 
has recently been unveiled. We 
heard regarding the wonderful tes- 
timony in stone of our Temple, but 
without the labors being performed 
within the Temple, it is like the 
body without the spirit. We have 
in very deed the Gospel of Jesus 
Christ, the power of God unto sal- 
vation. We find recorded in the 
Doctrine and Covenants that this is 
the Gospel, the glad tidings which 
the voice out of the heavens de- 
clared unto us, that He came into 
the world, even Jesus, to be cruci- 
fied for the sins of the world, and 
to save all the workmanship of the 
hands of God. One of the great 
works in this Gospel of salvation, 
devolving upon us as Saints, is to 
labor in the temples of God for the 
salvation of our dead. We feel that 
the Latter-day Saints, from one end 
of the Church to the other, should 
enroll themselves as members in the 
Genealogical Society, and that they 



should labor in the Temple as often 
as opportunity will present. 

I desire to read just a few words 
that I penned for the Improvement 
Era, fifteen years ago, and I read 
them in connection with the death 
of our beloved brother Ben E. Rich. 
Ben E. Rich, to my mind, lived a 
successful life. He died a million- 
aire in the wealth which is true 
wealth and which counts with God : 

"Not he who merely succeeds in 
making a fortune, and in so doing; 
blunts the natural affections of the 
heart, and chases therefrom the love 
of his fellows, can be said to be truly 
successful, but he who so lives that 
those who know him best shall love 
him most, and that God who knows 
not only his deeds but also the inmost 
sentiments of his heart shall love him; 
of such an one only, notwithstanding 
he may die in poverty, can it be said, 
indeed and of a truth, he should be 
crowned with the wreath of success." 

God loved Ben E. Rich. The 
prophet of God, and all of his asso- 
ciates in the Presidency, and the 
council of the twelve, and all of the 
general authorities loved Ben E. 
Rich. Those who came in intimate 
contact with him in the Southern 
States and in the Eastern States, 
men not of our faith, loved this 
man ; he gained their love, and those 
who knew him best loved him most, 
and God who knew the inmost 
promptings of his heart loved him. 
Therefore I say this man lived a 
successful life. I felt T would like 
to pay these few words of tribute 
to the memory of one who spent 
fully one-half of his mature years in 
proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus 
Christ. We find it recorded that if 
we labor all the days of our lives 
and bring save it be one soul unto a 
knowledge of the Gospel, how great 
shall be our joy with that soul in 
the kingdom of our Father, and if"

we bring many souls how much 
greater shall be our joy. Both by 
tongue and with his pen, this man 
has brought many, many souls to a 
knowledge of the Gospel of Jesus. 
Christ. God bless his memory. God 
bless his. family and help his chil- 
dren to walk in his footsteps, and to 
place the love of God and the Gos- 
pel of Jesus Christ first in their 
lives, is my earnest prayer in their 
behalf. 

I endorse with all my heart every- 
thing that I have heard during this 
conference. Pope says : 

"Vice is a monster of such frightful 
mien 

As to be hated, needs but to be seen; 
But seen too oft, familiar with her face, 
We first endure, then pity, then em- 
brace." 

Some among us are embracing, 
to the full extent, the vice of im- 
moral dress, and I lift my voice in 
absolute and perfect harmony with 
every word uttered here by Presi- 
dent Smith. We sing and have 
done so during this conference, "We 
thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet 
to guide us in these latter days ;" 
there are a great many who ought 
to put a postscript to that and say, 
"Provided he guides us to suit our 
own fancies and our own whims." 
The prophets of God, from Joseph 
Smith to the present day, have 
guided us and they have guided us 
aright, when we have listened to 
that guidance ; and the mistakes 
which have been made have been 
because of our failure to listen to 
the Prophet whose right it is to 
guide the people of God. I will give 
you one practical incident. Brigham 
Young stood in front of the home 
of the late Apostle, at that time 
bishop, Marriner W. Merrill, in 
Richmond, and he pointed over to 



the sandy country where Lewiston 
now stands and he said to Bishop 
Merrill: "Call some man to go 
over there and be a bishop, and or- 
ganize a ward there, and have the 
people locate there. That will be 
the most valuable part of this val- 
ley, agriculturally, the greatest 
grain producing part of the coun- 
try." Brother Merrill told me this, 
standing upon the spot where Brig- 
ham Young stood and he said, "I 
called Brother Lewis to go over 
there, and he was subsequently or- 
dained as a bishop, and set apart to 
preside at Lewiston. After he had 
been there one season and ploughed 
up the ground, a wind storm came 
and took all his fine soil and piled 
it up in a heap by the fence. He 
came back and said, 'Bishop Mer- 
rill, I would not give my little 
twenty-acre farm here at Richmond 
for the whole country over there 
and I want to come back.' " Brother 
Merrill said, "Well you will not 
come back with my consent. If 
you come back you will have to run 
away from the call that has been 
placed upon you. I will not release 
you ; the Prophet of God has said 
that is to be the granary of Cache 
V alley and you go back there ;" and 
Brother Lewis went back disheart- 
ened and discouraged. Brother 
Lewis, who afterwards became the 
president of the Benson stake of 
Zion, no doubt thanked Brother 
Merrill that he did not let him run 
away, seeing that during the last 
few years of his life, he harvested 
over ten thousand bushels of wheat 
a year. I know that the path of 
safety for the Latter-day Saints is 
to not only sing "We thank Thee 
O God for a Prophet, to guide us 
in these latter days," but to be ready 
and willing and anxious to be 
guided.

I was thrilled through and 
through with the magnificent refer- 
ence made to the Gull monument 
by Brother Roberts, and I was also 
thrilled with that magnificent poem 
which Brother Hart read. I thank 
God for my mother, and so does 
every true Latter-day Saint who 
has had a mother who has lived the 
life of- a Latter-day Saint, and has 
been true to the Gospel of Jesus 
Christ. I am thankful that healthy, 
vigorous, strong, sweet babies are 
the best crop of Utah, and I hope 
and pray earnestly that it will ever 
be so. I hope that the fashion 
which is a thousad times worse than 
are the fashions in dress, namely, 
that of drying up the fountains of 
life, will never become popular 
among the Latter-day Saints. That 
poem read by Brother Hart was a 
magnificent tribute to the mothers 
of the Latter-day Saints. I rejoice 
that honest men, as illustrated here, 
in the quotations made by Brother 
Levi Edgar Young, have to say 
good things, when they tell the 
truth, about the Latter-day Saints. 
I had a letter from a very dear 
friend of mine many years ago, 
written from London, and he was at 
the time general manager for the 
entire United Kingdom of a great 
corporation with hundreds of mil- 
lions of dollars of money; he wrote 
me as follows : 

"My Dear Heber : Your nice long 
letter of the tenth came duly to hand. 
Of course you know, aside from the 
long- and intimate personal friendship 
that we have had together, how much 
I have always been impressed with the 
genuineness and the sincerity of the 
men and women who hold your faith. 
Many times and oft I have said in 
conversation that the only people I 
ever knew who lived up to their pro- 
fessions were the 'Mormons' of Utah; 
and this is true. This it is that in- 
spires respect even where there is a 



total absence of a belief in the doc- 
trines. Y'our people carry their be- 
liefs into daily life and act as if they 
think there is something in them. I 
cannot see how, as a sensible person, 
I could do otherwise, for if tnere is 
anything" — and my friend drew a big 
black line under the word "anything" 
— "in a belief which involves an eter- 
nity of future existence, there is every- 
thing;" and my friend drew another 
large black line under "everything." 
"If there is anything in a belief which 
involves an eternity of future existence 
there is everything." 

Not only have you and I a faith 
which involves an eternity of future 
existence, but we have a knowledge 
of the divinity of the Gospel of 
Jesus Christ which we have es- 
poused, and it does involve an eter- 
nity of future existence, and we will 
have that existence in pleasure, in 
happiness, in joy, in association with 
all the good and the noble who have 
lived the Gospel of Jesus Christ, or 
we will be expelled from that com- 
pany, according as we shall keep the 
commandments of God. How I do 
pray that God will inspire His peo- 
ple with a determination to live their 
religion, so that this faith, involv- 
ing an eternity of future existence, 
shall also bring to them an eternity 
of exaltation and joy in the presence 
of our God and of our Savior. 

I received a letter from William 
George Jordan, the author of a 
number of books which we have 
published in serial form in the Im- 
provement Era, "Individuality of 
Self Control," "Little Problems of 
Married Life," and others. He is 
also the author of, "The Power of 
Truth," the English edition of 
which is "Great Truths." I sent him 
a number of tracts, a Book of Mor- 
mon and some pamphlets, and in ac- 
knowledging their receipt he 
thanked me for them and expressed 
the hope that some day he might

visit Utah and learn by personal 
contact regarding our , people. 
"From what I know of your peo- 
ple," he said, "your religion more 
than that of other creeds yields divi- 
dends of finer individual lives ; no 
faith is of any value unless it does 
yield dividends of better lives." I 
feel that compliments or praise of 
this kind, coming from those who 
are not of us, are precious, and 
should be appreciated by every Lat- 
ter-day Saint. I rejoice that men not 
of us discover that for honesty, for 
sobriety, for uprightness of life, for 
virtue, that no other people can 
make a better record than do the 
Latter-day Saints. I rejoice ex- 
ceedingly in the magnificent record 
which has been made by our boys 
who have gone to Harvard, and to 
the other universities from one end 
of the country to the other. For 
quality and quantity, and for up- 
right lives, the record which our 
boys have made is one that every 
Latter-day Saint should be proud of. 
I rejoice in this record for, because 
of it, we are becoming better known ; 
people are beginning to recognize 
what Mr. Jordan has said, namely, 
that this Gospel of Jesus Christ com- 
monly called by the world "Mor- 
monism" is in very deed yielding 
dividends of better individual lives. 

I was very much pleased indeed 
with the reference made here yester- 
day by Brother Penrose, with regard 
to supporting and upholding and sus- 
taining our local manufacturing in- 
stitutions. From the time that I was 
a boy sixteen years of ago, I never 
bought but one suit of clothes in 
Salt Lake City that the cloth did not 
come from the Provo Woolen Mills. 
I bought that suit to go to a ball in 
the Salt Lake Theatre. I had the 
honor of being a member of the 
Utah Legislature at the time that 



the members of the Legislature 
from Wyoming visited us, and we 
gave them a ball in the theatre. As 
my Provo suit happened to be of a 
light color, I did not want to be the 
only "white sheep," so to speak, and 
so I bought a black suit to har- 
monize with the others ; but the next 
day I gave it away to a poor rela- 
tive, so that when I stood up to 
preach I would not be wearing an 
imported suit of clothes and, pro- 
vided I wanted to talk home manu- 
facture, that the chips would not fly 
back in my own face. I never 
bought but that one suit until the 
factory closed down. I wear goods 
that are made in our own knitting 
factories, I stand up in Z. C. M. I. 
shoes ; they are good enough for me. 

Speaking of home-made shoes re- 
minds me of a little story. A num- 
ber of years ago, in the Assembly 
Hall, Bishop George L. Farrell an- 
nounced that one reason why he 
bought home-made goods was be- 
cause he loved Bishop Farrell ; he 
said, "If I buy home-made goods 
my money stays at home and it 
floats around and I get a chance to 
secure a little of it occasionally." 
You know they say, opportunity has 
a large lock of hair on its forehead 
and that it is bald behind, and that 
if you don't grasp the lock as it 
comes by, the hand will slip off ; 
and Brother Farrell believed in 
grasping opportunity. He said : "I 
have been coming down here to con- 
ferences from Cache Valley once or 
twice a year, for something over 
twenty years, and, every time I have 
gone to the depot, when I could 
possibly get a gold piece I put a 
mark on it ; knowing that the rail- 
road was owned by eastern capi- 
talists. I wanted to see if I would 
ever get any of that money back, 
but I never did. When I would 



ELDER HEBER J. GRANT. 



91 



buy home-made goods I would put 
a mark on that money, and time and 
time again, I got my home-made 
marked money back again. To give 
you a practical illustration, this 
identical trip, at the depot at Smith- 
field, I saw a man who had made 
some shoes for my children and I 
handed him five dollars in payment. 
He saw another man at the depot to 
whom he owed five dollars and he 
gave him the five ; and he saw an- 
other and he gave him the five ; and 
he saw another and he gave him the 
five, and when the fourth man got it 
he came up to me and said, 'Bishop 
Farrell, I owe you six dollars ; here 
is five on account,' and I put my 
home-made shoes back in my pock- 
et." (Laughter.) I am not vouch- 
ing for the exact language but I am 
vouching for the facts, because I 
heard the talk. So five dollars' 
worth of home-made shoes paid 
twenty-five dollars' worth of debts 
as quick as I have been able to tell 
it to you, or as it took Brother Far- 
rell to tell it. 

When I heard the Bishop's talk I 
was interested in a factory and I 
was trying to get a Salt Lake mer- 
chant to buy our goods and he said 
they were not as good as the im- 
ported. I told him he did not know 
good goods when he saw them ; that 
they were better than the imported ; 
but he did not believe it. "Well," 
I said, "look here. There is no 
doubt if you can make something 
you would buy the home-made 
goods." "Oh yes." You know of 
all our father's sons we love our- 
selves the best ; and this merchant 
was no exception. I said, "I will 
take orders on your store instead ot 
cash, and as you make probably 
twenty-five or thirty per cent profit, 
you can afford to buy our goods." 
Then he was loyal enough to do it. 



I gave to those working in the fac- 
tory ten per cent of their pay in 
orders and the balance in cash, and 
I asked them to tell me what they 
did with the orders and when they 
told me where the orders went I 
followed them all up. Those orders 
were out of our factory an average 
of six days, and they averaged pay- 
ing seven hundred per cent. In 
other words, every five dollar order 
went through seven hands in six 
days. They did one hundred per 
cent of work a day and worked 
enough in six days to rest on Sun- 
day. Now I once had the bumps 
on my head felt by Professor Fow- 
ler, and he said the biggest bump 
on my head was a practical bump, 
and I believe that that practical 
bump is fully satisfied with these 
two illustrations, that it is good 
business to buy home-made goods 
and thereby keep our money at 
home. 

A Montana divine in January, 
1910, said : 

"I maintain that the Christianity of 
the present is face to face with a la- 
mentable loss. The Christianity of to- 
day has acquired much, but in its get- 
ting it has lost its own soul; it has lost 
the Holy Ghost. No true man will 
dare to refute this argument; for go 
where you may in Christendom today 
you will find that our religion is void 
of the supernatural element which the 
Bible' claims it must have in order to 
exist." 

I differ with this divine in one 
particular: Go where you may in 
all the world except among the Lat- 
ter-day Saints. I maintain that in 
every land, in every clime, where 
ever the Gospel of Jesus Christ has 
gone, from Scandinavia on the 
north to South Africa on the south, 
to New Zealand, Australia and the 
islands of the Pacific, from Canada 
on the north to South America on 



92 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



the south, go where you will, where- 
ever the Gospel of Jesus Christ, re- 
vealed through the Prophet Joseph 
Smith has been proclaimed, and 
people have embraced it, the super- 
natural element, the power of God, 
and the Holy Ghost have always 
been manifested. "There are periods 
in the Christian era we look back 
upon with wonder and admiration. 
In those days men were convicted 
of sin and a judgment to come." 
All over the world, wherever this 
Gospel goes, men are convicted of 
sin and a judgment to come, and 
they repent of their sins and they 
go down into the waters of baptism, 
and they do receive a remission ot 
their sins and they do receive the 
Holy Ghost, that this man says 
Christendom is devoid of. "Then 
the more than human element was 
visible in our creed." As stated be- 
fore, the more than human element 
is visible in the creed of the Latter- 
day Saints wherever the Gospel is 
proclaimed. "Holy men had heav- 
enly .visions." Holy men and holy 
women have had heavenly visions, 
by the hundreds and by the thous- 
ands, yea by the tens of thousands 
since this Gospel was restored to the 
earth in our day. "Sickness was 
cured by spiritual power." I stand 
here today and in all humility be- 
fore God acknowledge that I am a 
living monument of the healing 
power of Almighty God ; and we 
heard the strong, able voice of 
Joseph W. McMurrin here yester- 
day, and he, too, is a living monu- 
ment of the healing power of God. 
We have them by the hundreds in 
the Church of Christ. "Holy men 
spoke with other tongues as the 
Spirit gave them utterance." Holy 
men and holy women have spoken 
with other tongues. I seldom hear 
a hymn written by Sister Eliza R. 



Snow sung in any of our meetings, 
or sing one myself, that I do not 
thank God for the gift of tongues to 
that noble woman. She gave to me 
a blessing when I was a child, pre- 
dicting incidents in my life, promis- 
ing me that I should grow to man- 
hood and become one of the leaders 
in the Church of Christ, Sister Zina 
D. Young giving the interpretation. 
I thank God that we have the gift 
of tongues. My wife, whose body 
lies in the tomb, gave to me a won- 
derful blessing by the gift of ton- 
gues, every word of which has been 
fulfilled. I know that God lives, I 
know that Jesus is the Christ, I 
know that Joseph Smith was a 
Prophet of God, I know that the 
gospel tree is alive, that it is grow- 
ing, that the fruits of the gospel 
growing upon the tree are good. I 
have reached out my hand, I have 
plucked the fruits of the Gospel, I 
have eaten of them and they are 
sweet, yea, above all that is sweet. 

May God help me and you and 
every soul who has a testimony of 
the Truth to live the Gospel of 
Christ so that our good deeds may 
encourage other men to seek for a 
testimony of the Truth, is my prayer 
and I ask it in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen.

The world recognizing worthiness of

This vast congregation is cer- 
tainly a testimony to the members 
of the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints that the work of 
God is growing. It is certainly an 
evidence to the world that the people 



ELDER REED SMOOT. 



93 



of the Church are loyal to its prin- 
ciples, believe in its destiny, and 
have unbounded confidence in the 
promises of God, our Father. I, 
with you, rejoice in the privilege of 
meeting in these general conferen- 
ces. I believe that we all have as- 
sembled here for the same purpose. 
We come to these conferences to 
receive instructions from the ser- 
vants of God. W e come here to re- 
new our obligations to Him, and to 
receive a portion of His Spirit to 
direct us in our future life. I don't 
know that I have ever attended a 
conference that I enjoyed more than 
this. I can't remember a time when 
my soul was in so perfect accord 
with all that has been said, as at this 
conference. I desire to bear testi- 
mony to what has been said by the 
brethren who have already spoken, 
calling attention to the mission of 
the Church, the magnitude of the 
work, of what the Church is ac- 
complishing in the world, of the di- 
vine mission of the Prophet Joseph, 
and the establishment of this work, 
never to be thrown down or given 
to another people. 

The present position of the 
Church has not been attained, with- 
out unselfish devotion to its pur- 
poses, without loyalty to the prin- 
ciples of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, 
without labor, yes labor without 
ceasing. I am proud to say that the 
world recognizes the fact that the 
"Mormon" people, as a people, are 
industrious, honest, peace-loving, 
God-fearing, even if they think we 
are mistaken as to the form of re- 
ligion, or our idea as to God. 

I remember when I was a boy the 
Juvenile Instructor came regularly 
to my father's home, and upon the 
front page of the cover there was 
always printed, at that time, this 
quotation, "There is no excellence 



without labor." There never was a 
truer saying; and I doubt whether 
there ever was a people on earth 
that has demonstrated the truth of 
this statement more than have the 
lives of the Latter-day Saints. 

Our president, yesterday, ex- 
pressed the thought that he had 
wasted, in different ways, a part of 
the time allowed him. I want to 
say to the brethren and sisters that 
I don't believe that there is a man 
living who labors harder and more 
hours each day than President Jos- 
eph F. Smith. If he is guilty none 
of us will escape. Labor does not 
always mean manual labor, ' and I 
say to the people of this Church that 
if they will labor as many hours 
and as diligently as the general au- 
thorities of this Church, there will 
be a great improvement in all the 
stakes of Zion, and greater pros- 
perity in all the homes of the Saints. 
I often hear men talk of being over- 
worked. Others are overworked 
and say nothing of it. This is some- 
times true of the men we least sus- 
pect. This comes forcibly to my 
mind every time I receive an issue 
of the "Americana," and read the 
history of this people written by 
Brother Roberts. I never read any 
one of the chapters unless I stop 
and think of the weeks, and months, 
of diligent investigation and work 
required in collecting all the facts 
and truths presented in such splen- 
did form. The time and effort he 
has given in writing the history will 
never be known by anyone but him- 
self. The history when complete 
will live as a monument to his in- 
dustry and to his intelligence. I 
think Brother Whitney and other 
members of the general authorities 
of the Church, who are called upon 
to do special work, are at times 
overworked, and all of them are do-

ing everything in their power to ad- 
vance the work of the Lord upon 
this earth. 

Waste of time, waste of food, 
waste of substance, of any kind, is 
displeasing in the sight of God. This 
has been preached in every stake of 
Zion. I remember, not many years 
ago, that I hardly ever attended a 
stake conference but what some of 
the brethren asked the people to im- 
prove their fences, their sidewalks, 
and their front yards, and I am 
pleased indeed to know that that 
counsel has been followed in many 
sections. At this conference I want 
to call attention to one yard that is 
just as important, and perhaps more 
so than the front yard, that is the 
back yard. I was in one of the 
little towns, in a county in the south- 
ern part of this state, not many days 
ago, and as usual I arose early, be- 
fore the family was up. I surveyed 
the back yard. (I believe I can tell 
more of the reasons for the pros- 
perity or non-success of a man by 
visiting his back yard than I can 
by meeting him upon the street, or 
judge from the appearance of his 
front yard.) The brother was com- 
plaining somewhat of hard times; 
thought that everything was costing 
too much money ; living was high, 
and yet I saw in his garbage can 
that morning enough food that 
could have been used, if properly 
prepared, to feed his family the fol- 
lowing day. A wicked waste, and 
such waste is an abomination in the 
sight of man and God. My brethren 
and sisters, let us learn a lesson 
against waste from the great in- 
dustrial institutions of this country. 
Take the steel industry. It wasn't 
many years ago when all their by- 
products were wasted, thrown away 
— actually an expense to the indus- 
try to remove them, but today they 



are used in a hundred different 
ways. We find made from them 
material for pavements ; we find the 
blast furnace gas running the 
powerful engine for moving their 
great machinery ; we find the by- 
products made into aniline dyes ; 
iron-ore waste pressed into brickets, 
and made into high class steel; in 
fact, everything is now used that a 
few years ago was thrown away and 
wasted. So with the packers of this 
country. There is nothing wasted 
by them. Every particle of a steer 
that is now slaughtered is utilized. 
The steer is converted into the nec- 
essaries of life, — from beef steak to 
buttons, and as one person aptly 
expressed it, there is not a particle 
of a beef wasted, with the exception 
of the air that the animal has 
breathed. I could go on, my brethren 
and sisters, and tell you of how every 
great industry of this country is 
utilizing every particle of material 
that they handle; but I haven't the 
time today to do so. 

The president of the Church 
warned us yesterday — and it was in- 
deed a timely warning, against 
breaking some of the admonitions 
and laws of the Church, and, in do- 
ing so, physically weakening the 
bodies that God has given us. I am 
in full accord with every word that 
he uttered. I believe in the word of 
Wisdom with all my heart. I be- 
lieve it is the law intended by God to 
keep our bodies healthy and strong, 
to transmit to our children, coming 
into this world, clean bodies ; and 
every child that is born has a right 
to expect of the father and the 
mother a clean, healthy body and 
mind. 

There are other things, it seems to 
me, that are sapping the life, at least 
the spiritual life, of the people of 
the world, and our communities are

affected, somewhat, with the same 
evil. I have reference to the maud- 
lin, half insane sympathy for the 
murderer, the unnatural, and the 
wicked, the desire for sensation- 
alism, the mad rush for pleasure, the 
desire to become one of the idle rich, 
or a determination to join the idle 
poor. What do I mean by maudlin, 
half-insane sympathy for the mur- 
derer, the unnatural, and the 
wicked ? I simply have to refer you 
to a case which has filled the mag- 
azines and the press not only in this 
country but all over the world, and, 
as far as I can estimate, if the space 
had been charged for by the daily 
papers of this country as they 
charge the business men for the 
space for advertising, it would 
amount to a hundred million dol- 
lars, or more. I have reference to 
the Thaw case. Who was Harry 
Thaw ? A man reared in the lap of 
luxury, a debauchee, a murderer 
escaping the gallows on the plea of 
insanity, a man reared in a home 
where all the luxuries of wealth 
were given him, but devoid of 
everything that makes man what 
God intended him to be. Wasn't 
it a spectacle to deplore to see the 
crowds following him from place 
to place, from jail to the auto, while 
he was in Canada ; ovation after 
ovation was given him ; women pre- 
sented him with flowers on every 
possible occasion, and young girls 
not out of their teens, stood at the 
jail begging "Harry" to come to the 
bars that they might see him. Oh 
God, have mercy on such deluded 
people. I remember one case here 
in Utah when a murderer, sentenced 
to die, was sent flowers by some of 
the women of our state. Thank the 
Lord there were but a few so fool- 
ish. I take it that such action can 
only be indulged in by a person hav- 



ing a diseased mind. There is surely 
something wrong with them. I do 
know that there isn't a spark of the 
Spirit of God in them. 

I was more than delighted with 
the reading of Joaquin Miller's 
poem today. I have read it many, 
many times. I hardly ever pass the 
old house he made his home while 
in Washington (it has been moved 
to Rock Creek Park lately, by the 
Government of the United States, 
from Sixteenth Street to a lovely 
part of the park) but what I go in- 
side. You cannot always tell what 
a man is by the house he lives in or 
by his dress. I knew Joaquin Mil- 
ler, having met him many times in 
Washington. I don't remember of 
seeing a man that was so careless in 
his dress, and yet God inspired him 
to present to the world, in poetry, 
some of the most beautiful thoughts 
and ideals that can appeal to the 
better part of man. As you enter 
the living room of the old log house, 
you see in the corner the old desk 
that he toiled at for so many years, 
the place where the inspiration of 
God came to him to record in poet- 
ry the history of our nation and 
people. I honor his name for his 
words of commendation and truth 
for the womanhood of the state I 
love so well. God bless his mem- 
ory. 

Before closing, my brethren and 
sisters, I want to leave with you to- 
day my testimony that God lives, 
my testimony that He will be with 
and assist any man or any woman 
who will rely upon and have faith 
in Him; also my testimony to the 
power of prayer; and of God's 
goodness to his people. I am not 
worried in the least that God will 
not carry out His part of the com- 
pact with His people, if we honor 
and obey Him and keep His com-

mandments. May God bless this 
people, may He bless every honest 
soul in the world ; may He bless the 
different governments in all the 
world, and particularly the men 
who make and administer the laws 
of the respective governments ; 
for we all desire that liberty shall 
abound upon the earth. I believe 
that God held in the hollow of His 
hand this continent for the planting 
of truth and liberty, and I believe 
that liberty will continue to spread 
until it covers the whole earth as 
the waters cover the mighty deep. 
So may it be, O Father, and hasten 
the day is my prayer in the name of 
Jesus. Amen. 

The choir sang the anthem, 
"Mighty Jehovah, accept our 
praises." the bass solo was rendered 
by James A. Crawford. 

ELDER ORSON F. WHITNEY. 

The thing of most worth — What God 
did for man, and what He requires 
in return — One Savior, with many 
assistants — A proper division of 
labor necessary. 

I am thankful that my heart is 
in tune with the spirit of this con- 
ference, and with all that has been 
said by the servants of . God under 
the influence of the Holy Spirit. 
The keynote to the conference was 
sounded by President Smith when, 
on yesterday morning, he uttered 
these words : "I feel, this morning, 
as I have felt almost all my life, 
and I feel it stronger this morning, 
perhaps, than ever before, that there 
is nothing under the heavens of so 
much importance to me or to the 
children of men, as the great plan 
of life and salvation." 

The moment these words fell 
from his lips, my mind flew to that 



incident in the life of our Savior 
where a young man came to Him 
and asked what good thing he 
should do to inherit eternal life. 
He was told to keep the command- 
ments, and they were enumerated. 
He answered, "All this have I done 
from my youth up." The Savior 
then said, "One thing thou lackest 
— go and sell all that thou hast, 
and give to the poor, and come fol- 
low me." In other words, Help me 
to save the world. 

I also recalled some revelations 
given through the prophet Joseph 
Smith, in which God revealed to 
certain men the secret thoughts of 
their hearts. One of these men was 
John Whitmer.one of the eight wit- 
nesses to the Book of Mormon. The 
Lord said to him, through Joseph 
the Seer, in the month of June, 
1829 : "I will tell you that which no 
man knoweth save me and thee 
alone ; for many times you have de- 
sired of me to know ■ that which 
wpuld be of the most worth unto 
you. Behold, blessed are you for 
this thing, and for speaking my 
word which I have given you,, ac- 
cording to my commandments ; 
and now, behold, I say unto you, 
that the thing which will be of the 
most worth to you will be to de- 
clare repentance unto this people, 
that you may bring souls to me, 
that you may rest with them in the 
kingdom of my Father." Peter 
Whitmer, Jr., another of the eight 
witnesses, was answered in like 
manner. 

In a subsequent revelation, given 
for the benefit of Oliver Cowdery 
and David Whitmer, we find these 
important passages, already re- 
ferred to in part by Brother Heber 
J. Grant : 

"Remember the worth of souls is 
great in the sight of God; 



ELDER ORSON F. WHITNEY. 



97 



"For, behold, the Lord your Re- 
deemer, suffered death in the flesh; 
wherefore He suffered the pain of all 
men, that all men might repent and 
come unto Him; 

"And He hath risen again from the 
dead, that He might bring all men 
unto him, on conditions of repent- 
ance; 

"And how great is his joy in the soul 
that repenteth. 

"Wherefore, you are called to cry 
repentance unto this people; 

"And if it so be that you should la- 
bor all your days in crying repentance 
unto this people, and bring save it be 
one soul unto me, how great shall be 
your joy with him in the kingdom of 
my Father. 

"And, now, if your joy will be great 
with one soul that you have brought 
unto me into the kingdom of my 
Father, how great will be your joy 
if you should bring many souls unto 
me." 

Can we wonder that the Presi- 
dent of the Church should be moved 
upon to remind us of these things ? 
The most profitable work that men 
or gods can engage in is the salva- 
tion of souls. Consequently there 
is nothing so important to me or to 
you or to any of the children of 
men, as that great plan of life and 
salvation, devised in the heavens 
and delivered to man upon the 
earth in a series of Gospel dispen- 
sations of which this is the last and 
the greatest. 

What is this plan? What does it 
contemplate? What is its nature 
and its purpose? Paul the apostle 
wrote : "I am not ashamed of the 
Gospel of Christ for it is the power 
of God unto salvation." He might 
have gone further had it been 
timely, and shown that the Gospel 
of Christ is also the power of 
God unto exaltation. Exaltation 
is salvation added upon; it is 
an extension of that idea or condi- 
tion, just as salvation is an exten- 
sion of redemption. A soul may be 



redeemed, that is, raised from the 
grave, and yet condemned at the 
final judgment, for evil deeds done 
in the body ; or a soul may be saved, 
and yet come short of the glory 
that constitutes exaltation. The 
threefold purpose of the gospel is 
to redeem and save and glorify the 
children of God. 

The word "gospel" comes from 
"godspell," an Anglo-Saxon term 
meaning God-story, or the story of 
God. It derives ijts significance 
from that great central idea of the 
Christian faith — the coming of God 
as the Son of God to redeem and 
save mankind. Abinadi, the Nephite 
prophet, declared, hundreds of 
years before the birth of the Sa- 
vior, that God Himself would come 
down among the children of men 
and redeem His people; "and be- 
cause He dwelleth in flesh He shall 
be called the Son of God." He is 
the author of our salvation. He 
paid our debt ; He took the world 
out of pawn, in which it had been 
placed by the transgression of our 
first parents, Adam and Eve. 

And yet, through that transgres- 
sion, and the consequent fall of 
man, God's purpose was accom- 
plished, in the coming of a race of 
spirits to take upon themselves 
bodies, thus becoming souls, capa- 
ble of endless increase and ever- 
lasting progression. "Adam fell 
that man might be, and man is that 
he might have joy." But there 
would be no joy, no progress — 
there would be no redemption, no 
salvation, no exaltation, had not 
Christ died, that man might live 
again. The action of our first par- 
ents brought death, eternal death, 
into the world — death of the body, 
death of the spirit, everlasting ban- 
ishment from God's presence ; and 
yet it had the great result of giving 



98 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



God's children the opportunities 
which this life affords for education 
and development. 

But in order that the plan might 
be operative, the transgression 
turned to good effect, God's pur- 
pose carried out, and man saved 
and glorified, there had to be a ran- 
som, a redemption ; the scales of 
eternal justice had to be repoised, 
and right's equilibrium restored. 
The life of a God was the price of 
the world's freedom, and that price 
was paid by him who is called 
Jesus the Nazarene, but who was 
and is no other than Jehovah, the 
God of Israel, who came unto His 
own, was rejected by them, was 
crucified at their instigation, and 
gave His life to redeem the world. 

Now, this is what the Savior did 
for us. Has He not earned the 
right to tell us what we shall do for 
Him? Did He not have the right 
to say to the young man, "Forsake 
all and follow me?" Did He not 
have the right to say to Joseph, and 
through him to John Whitmer, to 
Peter Whitmer. to Oliver Cowdery 
and David Whitmer, "That which 
will be of most worth to you is to 
bring souls unto me ?" If He could 
afford to descend from His glorious 
throne, make Himself an exile of 
eternity, walk in the dust of His 
own footstool, to bring these glad 
tidings of immortality and the res- 
urrection, to open up for us and for 
all men the opportunities for end- 
less progression, can we do less 
than to follow Him and do what- 
soever He requires at our hands? 

There is but one Savior ; there 
is only "one name given under 
heaven whereby men can be saved ;" 
but there may be innumerable as- 
sistants, innumerable subordinates, 
saviors in a lesser sense and de- 
gree. John the Revelator saw no 



less than one hundred and forty- 
four thousand of such saviors, 
standing on the Mount Zion, with 
the Father's name written in their 
foreheads ; and it was said of them, 
"These are they that follow the 
Lamb whithersoever He goeth." 

The Gospel of Christ represents 
what God did for man, that man 
could not do for himself ; and it also 
represents what He requires of 
man in return. There is nothing 
possible of achievement that God 
cannot do. but there ma) r be things 
that He has not time to do, and 
which may be done for Him. There 
are some things, however, that even 
God cannot do. I speak it with all 
reverence. For instance, He can- 
not make something out of nothing, 
though many pious Christians 
ascribe to Him that power — if such 
it can be called. There is another 
thing that God cannot do — He can- 
not be present in all places at the 
same time, in His own proper per- 
son. This is God's work, and it 
can only be done by the power of 
God ; but we cannot expect Him to 
be everywhere present, nor in two 
places at the same time, except by 
His authority, His spirit and His 
influence. This fact renders neces- 
sary a priesthood to represent Him, 
and a Church such as this to carry 
on His work — a Church which 
from top to bottom is one great 
machine for the salvation of souls. 

There is no one class among the 
Latter-day Saints upon whom this 
great work rests, to the exclusion 
of the others. Take to your hearts 
the wise counsel and instructions of 
President Francis M. Layman. 
How beautifully he met the occa- 
sion, and fitted his discourse to the 
needs of the time — just like a plas- 
ter to a wound. There is growing 
up among us, I fear, a sentiment 



ELDER ORSON F. WHITNEY. 



99 



that only certain men and women 
ought to be called upon to carry 
ori the work of the Lord, the work 
of saving souls. Some think that 
the First Presidency and the other 
general authorities, with the heads 
of the stakes and wards and mis- 
sions, are the men who ought to 
do God's work, while the rest go on 
making money, practicing politics, 
pursuing and accumulating material 
things. This is a heresy. The ob- 
ligation of saving souls rests upon 
every man and woman in this 
Church — if not with equal weight, 
at least proportionately, according 
to their strength, their time, their 
opportunities, their abilities ; and 
they cannot get out from under this 
responsibility on the plea that it 
belongs only to such and such per- 
sons. Did not the Lord say, 
through Joseph the Seer, at the be- 
ginning of this work, "Behold, it 
is a day of warning, and not of 
many words : Therefore, let every 
soul that is warned, warn its neigh- 
bor ? v 

I had a conversation, recently, 
with one of our brethren, while re- 
turning home from a journey, and 
during our talk he said, in sub- 
stance : "When the apostles visit 
the stakes, instead of going merely 
to the meeting house, to the home 
of the stake president, or wherever 
they are entertained, why don't they 
go out on the street corners, or into 
the shops, where the boys congre- 
gate that never attend meetings, 
that are never seen in the congre- 
gations of the Saints ? Why don't 
they go in the stores and sit on the 
counter with them, put their arms 
around them, and try to save them ? 
What weight it would have if an 
apostle should devote a portion of 
his time to work of this nature. As 
it is, you don't see all that goes on 



in any stake of Zion. It washes its 
face, puts on its fine apparel, and 
assumes its best behavior, to re- 
ceive the visitors at a conference ; 
and the officers of the stake are 
naturally anxious to give a good 
report of local conditions. The re- 
sult is that you do not get at all the 
facts. You are not fully informed 
of the conditions. Would it not be 
a good work for one or two of the 
Twelve to do — the extra work that 
I have suggested?" 

Yes, I had to admit that it would 
be a good work, an excellent work. 
But can anyone tell me why it 
would not be just as' good a work 
for a high priest, or a seventy, or 
an elder, in case an apostle could 
not be there ? Twelve men can't be 
everywhere. Why wait for the 
apostles to come, you that hold' the 
Melchizedek priesthood in the 
sixty-five stakes of Zion ? Why 
don't you save your own 'sons and 
daughters ? 

When the Apostle James wrote, 
"If any are sick among you" — -he 
did not say, send for the heads of 
the Church. He said, "Send for 
the elders of the Church." Now, 
there is an army of elders, and the 
work of administering to the sick 
might be distributed far more wide- 
ly, with better results than are now 
obtained. Men would exercise 
their priesthood who are not exer- 
cising it today, and a few would 
not be overloaded with work and 
broken down by doing more than 
their share. This magnificent 
Church organization was instituted 
for the salvation of souls ; and if 
every man in all the councils and 
quorums of the priesthood, and 
every woman in the auxiliary or- 
ganizations, were doing their share 
of the work, and some were not 
trying to do more than their share, 



100 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



we would not hear so much about 
"nervous prostration," we would 
not hear of broken-down men, dy- 
ing prematurely; but everything 
would work harmoniously and hap- 
pily. 

God never intended that His 
work should break men down. He 
intended that it should build them 
up. Let us all find out what God 
requires of us in this great plan of 
salvation, and then let each one do 



his or her part, and we will all be 
happier, we will all do better work, 
and God will be glorified through 
our administrations. Amen. 

The choir sang the anthem, "The 
Lord will comfort Zion." 

Benediction was pronounced by 
Elder Lemuel H. Redd. 

Conference adjourned until 10 
a. m., Monday, October 6th, 1913. 



THIRD DAY. 



Conference was resumed in the 
Tabernacle, at 10 a. m., Monday, 
October 6th; President Joseph F. 
Smith presiding- 

The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn : 

How firm a foundation, ye Saints of 
the Lord, 
Is laid for your faith in His excel- 
lent word! 
What more can He say than to you 
He hath said, 
You who unto Jesus for refuge have 
fled? 

Prayer was offered by Elder 
James Wotherspoon. 

The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn: 

O, say, what is Truth? 'Tis the fairest 
gem 

That the riches of worlds can pro- 
duce; 

And priceless the value of truth will 
be, when 

The proud monarch's costliest diadem 
Is counted but dross and refuse. 



ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH. 

Marvelous power of Faith manifest in 
modern as well as ancient times — 
Faith obtained by doing 1 God's will. 

This morning we have met to- 
gether in a continuation of the feast 
we have enjoyed during the last two 
days, and I hope that the prayer 
which has been offered may be real- 
ized, that our Heavenly Father will 
pour out His Spirit upon those who 
address us, that we may continue to 
be edified and our faith increased. 

Tn reading the scriptures, which I 



trust this great congregation is ac- 
customed to do, not occasionally but 
frequently, our faith is strengthened 
and our minds are directed towards 
the Throne of Grace. In the 11th 
chapter of Hebrews, we find re- 
corded : 

"Now faith is the substance of 
things hoped for, the evidence of 
things not seen. For by it the elders 
obtained a good report. Through faith 
we understand that the worlds were 
framed by the word of God, so that 
things which are seen were not made 
of things which do appear. 

"By faith Abel offered unto God a 
more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by 
which he obtained witness that he was 
righteous, God testifying of his gift's: 
and by it he being dead, yet speaketh." 

"By faith Enoch was translated that 
he should not see death; and was not 
found, because God had translated 
him: for before his translation he had 
this testimony, that he pleased God." 

"But without faith it is impossible 
to please him; for he that cometh to 
God must believe that He. is, and that 
He is a rewarder of them that dili- 
gently seek Him." 

"By faith Noah, being warned of 
God of things not seen as yet, 
moved with fear, prepared an ark" 
and was able to save himself and 
family from a watery grave. Abra- 
ham, by reason of his faith, was 
able to go into the mountains with 
his son Isaac, of whom it was said, 
"In Isaac shall thy seed be called," 
and would have offered him as a 
sacrifice, assured that God would 
raise him from the dead and fulfil 
His promise. But the Lord pro- 
vided another sacrifice, accepting 
his obedience and accounting it unto 



102 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



him for righteousness ; and verily 
in his seed have all the nations of 
the earth been blessed. By faith 
Moses led the children of Israel 
from bondage, passing through the 
Red sea as by dry land, which, the 
pursuing hosts of the Egyptians es- 
saying to do, were drowned. The 
multitude were fed with bread from 
heaven. When Moses smote the 
rock in Horeb, water gushed forth 
to slake their thirst; and, passing 
through the wilderness, they were 
led to the promised land. By faith 
the three Hebrew children, who 
were cast into the fiery furnace, had 
their lives spared; and the prophet 
Daniel was taken from the lion's 
den unharmed. 

It was by faith that all the mira- 
cles were wrought by the Redeemer 
of the world, and by those who were 
associated with Him. From the be- 
ginning of time until now it has 
been the faithful man who has had 
power with God. 

In this latter dispensation it was 
because of his implicit faith in God 
that the boy prophet went into the 
woods and knelt down and prayed, 
and received the first great heavenly 
manifestation that came to him, by 
which the personality of the God- 
head was again made known to 
mankind. It was by faith that he 
was able to go to the hill Cumorah 
and receive from the hands of the 
angel those sacred records that he 
later translated by the gift and 
power of God. It was by faith he 
led his people from Kirtland to the 
land of Missouri and back to Illi- 
nois, and though repeatedly plun- 
dered and driven from their homes, 
the faith that had been planted in 
their hearts remained with them, 
and they knew that God was mind- 
ful of them. It was by faith that 
the great city of Nauvoo was found- 



ed, under the direction of the 
Prophet Joseph Smith ; and by faith 
the glorious truths contained in the 
Doctrine and Covenants were re- 
ceived by him. 

It was by faith that Brigham 
Young lead the people into this 
western land; and, when he arrived 
upon the summit of the mountain 
and looked over the valley, God 
gave to him a witness that this was 
the place where Israel should be 
planted. It was by faith that the 
irrigation system was perfected, by 
which it was made possible to de- 
velop this great intermountain coun- 
try. It was by faith that the people 
laid the corner stone of this great 
Temple, in their weakness and in 
their poverty, believing that God 
would prepare the way and provide 
the means whereby the structure 
might be completed. It was by faith 
that the mercy of our Heavenly 
Father was extended to the people, 
when, in their distress, they saw 
their crops being consumed by the 
crickets, with no means of prevent- 
ing it, and, in the providence of 
God,- their prayers were answered, 
and they received a witness of it in 
the coming of the gulls to preserve 
their harvest and deliver them from 
starvation. 

It has been by faith that the elders 
of Israel have gone forth, leaving 
home and loved ones, and enduring 
the reproach of the world, to bear 
witness that God lives and that 
Jesus is the Christ, and that Joseph 
Smith was a prophet of the Lord. 
By faith your sick have been healed, 
your dead have been raised to life. 
Were the records available of the 
miracles wrought among this people 
during the past century, it would be 
a testimony of the power of God. 
through faith, unsurpassed in any 
age of the world. 



ELDER DAVID 0. McKAY.

It is this principle, my brethren 
and sisters, that points us heaven- 
ward, that gives us hope in the bat- 
tle of life. When we become con- 
fused, and find ourselves confronted 
by obstacles we, seemingly, cannot 
overcome, having faith in the Re- 
deemer of the world, we can go to 
Him and know that our prayers will 
be answered for our good. Only a 
few days ago, one of our sisters, vis- 
iting in the east, in a conversation 
, with an educated man, was told by 
him, "I cannot believe as you do but 
I wish that I could. It is beautiful." 
And so it is with many of our 
Father's children, who, observing 
the character of this work, watching 
the actions of the men and women 
who have embraced the .truth, they 
are filled with amazement at what 
has been accomplished, and the 
peace and happiness that follows the 
sincere believer, and wish that they 
too might have part in it ; and they 
could if they had faith. 

We know that faith is a gift of 
God ; it is the fruitage of righteous 
living. It does not come to us by 
our command, but is the result of 
doing the will of our Heavenly 
Father. If we lack faith let us ex- 
amine ourselves to see if we have 
been keeping His commandments, 
and repent without delay if we have 
not. It has been by faith that the 
men who have stood at the head of 
this work have been inspired, from 
time to time, to give the instructions 
that we have needed. It is by faith 
that we are edified on occasions like 
this, by those who minister in the 
name of the Lord, and the Com- 
forter quickens their understanding, 
bringing things past to their remem- 
brance and showing them things to 
come ; thus evidencing the spirit of 
revelation. 

May the Lord increase our faith, 



and may we live to be worthy of it. 
May we inspire faith in the hearts 
of our wives and children, by lives 
of righteousness and devotion at all 
times; and may every soul that 
comes in contact with us, whether 
they be of Israel or not, be able to 
recognize in us virtues worthy of 
children of God. May we prove 
ourselves deserving of our oppor- 
tunities in this dispensation, -and 
when the time comes to be gathered 
home may we receive the welcome 
plaudit, "Well done, thou good and 
faithful servant, thou hast been 
faithful over a few things, I will 
make thee ruler over many things, 
enter thou into the joy of thy Lord," 
is my prayer for you and all our 
Father's children, in the name of 
Jesus Christ. Amen. 



ELDER DAVID 0. M'KAY. 

Appreciation of Gospel truths increased 
by study— Treasures of Truth in Doc- 
trine and Covenants — Latter-day Israel 
should not "halt between two opin- 
ions," but choose to obey God — Spirit- 
ual and physical power obtained by 
obeying God's laws — "What is the use 
of hearing and not doing?" 

This conference has indeed been 
an inspiration to Israel. I pray 
that the same spirit that has guided 
the brethren who have addressed the 
different congregations may direct 
my thoughts and remarks during 
the next few minutes. My heart 
has been filled with thanksgiving as 
I have listened to the admonitions 
from the Presidency of the Church, 
the council of the twelve, and others 
who have adressed us. 

It seems to me that more specific 
instructions and admonitions have 
been given to the Saints this con- 
ference than ever before at any par-

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



ticular conference. My heart is in 
hearty atune with the suggestion of 
President Smith, that the Latter-day 
Saints think more about the Gospel 
and spiritual things, that they give 
more attention to these matters, de- 
vote more time to the real things in 
life, and less time to those things 
that will perish. It is also in hearty 
accord with the admonition to resist 
the various temptations in our midst. 
Thos'e two suggestions alone, if Lat- 
ter-day Saints would adopt them in 
their lives, would be sufficient to 
make this people a light upon a 
hill, a light that could not be hid. 
We refer to such teachings some- 
times as little things, but indeed they 
are the greatest in this life. If we 
were to pay more attention to such 
advice and devote more study to the 
modern revelations as contained in 
the Doctrine and Covenants, we 
would grow in appreciation of the 
magnitude of the great work that 
has been established in this dispen- 
sation. It is often said that the 
Church is the greatest thing in the 
world — it is — but the more we give 
attention to it, and realize how well 
adapted it is to our individual life, 
to our home life, to our social life ; 
when we study it from the stand- 
point of our environment from the 
standpoint of scientific discoveries, 
our hearts are made to rejoice for 
God's goodness unto us in giving 
us the privilege of knowing the Gos- 
pel of Jesus Christ. 

Nearly every passage in the Doc- 
trine and Covenants is replete with 
admonitions, full of inspiration and 
wonderful revelations to men. 
Sometimes those revelations are 
couched in but few words, but by 
careful study one sees how closely 
related they are to all truth. Take 
for example the wonderful revela- 
tion, simply expressed, in regard 



to government by the priesthood: 
"No power or influence can or ought 
to be maintained by the priesthood 
only by persuasion, long suffering, 
gentleness, meekness and with love 
unfeigned." Just think of that use 
of the word "unfeigned." Love 
pretended has no influence. Love 
unfeigned always has the power to 
reach the heart. To continue : "Re- 
proving at times by sharpness, and 
afterwards showing forth greater 
love towards him whom thou hast 
reproved lest he esteem thee to be 
his enemy." Why it is a wonderful 
admonition and lesson in regard to 
the government, not only in quor- 
ums of priesthood in the Church 
offices but in our home life and in all 
phases of association in society. 
Consider, again, the suggestion in 
regard to the worth of souls, "Re- 
member the worth of souls is 
great." Also the revelation in re- 
gard to the true riches, "Seek after 
the riches I shall give, wisdom" and 
so on, "and the riches of the world 
will be added also." Such things 
are the real things in the world. 
And so we might continue, reve- 
lation after revelation as given in 
the Doctrine and Covenants, if 
studied and paid attention to by the 
Latter-day Saints, will establish 
faith in their hearts and make them 
rejoice at this great and wonderful 
organization placed among men for 
their salvation. 

Not the least among these by anv 
means is that revelation on the word 
o^ wisdom. Now there are just 
one or two little paragraphs in it 
that refer to the use of strong 
drink : "If any man among you use 
strong drink, behold it is not good." 
Just a simple statement; it is un- 
qualified, but there it stands. "Wine 
and strong drink are not good." 
That revelation was given over 



ELDER DAVID 0. McKAY.

eighty years ago — the Word of God, 
not only to the people who are mem- 
bers of His Church but to the in- 
habitants of the world wherever 
that book has been published ; wher- 
ever it has been distributed by the 
elders of the Church the word of 
God has been sounded to the world. 
People have thus been told by rev- 
elation that it is not good to indulge 
in these intoxicating beverages ; but 
they have wavered, and some Lat- 
ter-day Saints have wavered. They 
have been very much as ancient 
Israel with the gods of Baal. You 
remember when Elijah came 
amongst them denouncing their 
worship of idols. He had been 
hidden for several months, and dur- 
ing the three and a half years fam- 
ing had kept away from the king. 
The famine became so sore that the 
people gathered near Mount Car- 
mel, a projecting peak near the 
Mediterranean Sea. Elijah, deter- 
mining to reveal himself told one 
of his friends to inform the king 
that he, Elijah, was there. The man 
hesitated to go. Elijah said, "This 
day I will show myself to him," 
and he did : and when the king saw 
him he said, "Art thou he that 
troubleth Israel?" and the prophet 
answered. "I have not troubled 
Israel, but thou and thy father's 
house in that ye have forsaken the 
commandments of the Lord, thou 
has followed Baalim." Then Eli- 
jah suggested, "Now therefore send, 
and gather to me all Israel unto 
Mount Carmel, and the prophets of 
Baal, four hundred and fifty and let 
us determine here today whether 
the god of Baal is the true god or 
whether the God of Israel is the 
true god." The people assembled 
in that picturesque place and Elijah 
adressed them : "How long halt ye 
betzvecn tit'o opinions f If the Lord 



be God, follow Him, but if Baal, 
then follow him. And the people 
answered not a word." It is sugges- 
tive. There the people were halt- 
ing: many of them knew in a way 
that Israel's God was omnipotent, 
that He it was who could save them, 
and yet the other gods offered pleas- 
ure, offered indulgence } and the 
people halted ; some trying to serve 
and yield obedience to both. "How 
long halt ye between two opin- 
ions?" said the prophet; "If the 
Lord be God follow Him, if Baal 
be god, follow him;" but don't try 
to mix in trying to serve one today 
and then falling back in obedience 
to the teachings of the other tomor- 
row. Well, you know the test that 
was decided upon ; you know the re- 
sult, and the death that came to the 
priests of Baal. 

While listening to the word of 
God as given in this conference by 
our President, who admonished Is- 
rael to refrain from indulgence in 
tobacco, and to refrain from indul- 
gence in strong drink, I thought 
that instruction has been given to 
us now for eighty years, and still 
we falter in obedience. How long, 
Israel, halt ye between two opin- 
ions ? The Lord has said that strong 
drink is not good. Eighty years 
ago that was declared. Only a few 
weeks ago, in this country, at a 
meeting of brewers, a man rose and 
said : "We don't want the people to 
drink more beer, but we want more 
people to drink beer." Which teach- 
ing will you heed? Which will the 
nation accept? Whose voice will the 
people heed? One declared in the 
voice of Omnipotence that beer, al- 
coholic beverages, are not good ; the 
other declared it is good, and he 
wants to develop the appetite of the 
people so more people will drink. 
"How long halt ye between two

opinions?" What does it mean to 
obey God's word ? to refrain from 
indulgence in narcotics, and alco- 
holic beverages ? It means stronger 
manhood ; it means brighter intel- 
lects ; it means stronger and more 
perfect physical organism ; it means 
better and truer husbands, more de- 
voted and affectionate fathers ; it 
means parenthood that will trans- 
mit to children clean habits, and 
power in the will to resist temp- 
tations of appetite and greater temp- 
tations of passion that may come 
to them ; it means happy Homes, 
contented wives, well dressed and 
better educated children ; it means a 
safe and sound citizenship which 
goes for the building of a safe and 
sound nation ; it means salvation for 
the individual in the kingdom of 
God. A little thing? On the other 
hand, what does indulgence mean? 
Weakened manhood, a weakened 
will, a physical organism that will 
transmit weakness to unborn gener- 
ations ; it means the cutting off of 
life by slow suicide ; it means the 
derangement of mental faculties ; it 
means the breaking up of homes, it 
means broken hearted wives, desti- 
tute children, a weakened society 
and an underminded Republic — that 
is what it means. Recent investi- 
gations by scientists confirm these 
statement. 

The American Society for the 
study of alcoholic beverages and 
narcotics, recently made a report al- 
so to this effect. You will find it in 
the Senate Document no. 48 issued 
May 17th, 1909. Their conclusions 
are these : that alcohol is not safe as 
a common beverage in any of its 
present commercial forms, or for or- 
dinary prescriptions ; that it is a 
thief of all the vitality of the tis- 
sues ; that its promises of strength 
are mocking lies ; its semblance of 



power is simply nerve center dis- 
turbances that end in ultimate weak- 
ness and destruction. That the 
whiskey problem is a greater prob- 
lem today in this country than the 
great white plague. The intemp- 
erance in the United States today 
costs this country over one billion, 
eight hundred and eighty-three mil- 
lion dollars; that today in this Re- 
public there are over three million 
drinkers who have been taught that 
alcohol is a mild stimulant and a 
pleasant tonic, and the worst of it 
is that nearly all these will say they 
can quit it, each says, "I can leave 
it alone." The demon is lying to 
them always, promising them some- 
thing which it cannot give. 

I believe, Latter-day Saints, that 
it is time for this people to stand 
up in earnest in the strength of true 
manhood and declare against these 
evils. Let us think about them now ; 
go from this conference deter- 
mined, so far as we are concerned, 
that we will live in accordance with 
the admonitions given. This means 
that in our individual life we will 
refrain from the use of these things 
— whiskey, tobacco, tea and coffee. 
As you know the Latter-day Saints 
are not alone in declaring against 
the use of these beverages. Men 
have proved by scientific research 
that the word of God as given to 
the prophet Joseph Smith eighty 
years ago is the word of life and 
salvation to man. Then as indi- 
viduals let us refrain. It grieved 
me yesterday, as I passed into a 
restaurant, to see some of our people 
indulging in some of those bever- 
ages, after having listened to the 
teachings of this conference. What 
is the use of hearing and not do- 
ing? Think! Be strong enough to 
introduce the principles into active 
life ; and after doing that, as indi-

viduals, see that it is cleared up in 
our homes, use your influence with 
your children ; and remember ex- 
ample in the home will go further 
in helping our children than our 
teaching. Parents, you cannot af- 
ford for the sake of your children, 
to use these things. You may want 
to, but I tell you you have no right 
to transmit such an appetite and a 
weakened will to those unborn chil- 
dren whom God may give you ■ you 
have no right to do it. Children are 
entitled to a kingly birth, whether 
they must live in a mud hovel or in 
a palace ; it makes no difference — a 
kingly birth, inherited strength, 
physical strength, moral strength, 
and a tendency towards spiritual 
uplift. 

Then after freeing our homes 
from forbidden things, let us clean 
up our towns, eliminate saloons 
from every city and county. I 
congratulate the Latter-day Saints 
that in nearly every town where 
members of the Church are in the 
majority, the saloons are closed. I 
trust that the time is not far distant 
when they will be eliminated from 
every town in our state, and from 
every city and state in our country. 
I believe with all my heart the sen- 
timents of David Starr Jordan, as 
expressed in that excellent little 
work, "The Strength of Being 
Clean," part of which is as follows : 

"So far as the drink of the drunk- 
ards is concerned, prohibition may 
not prohibit; but to clean up a town, 
to free it from corrosion, save men 
and boys, and girls too, from vice; 
and who shall say that moral sanita- 
ion is not as much the duty of the 
community as physical sanitation? 
The city of the future will not per- 
mit the existence of slums and dives 
and tippling houses; it will prohibit 
their existence for the same reason 
that it now prohibits pig-pens and 
dung heaps and cess-pools, for where 



all these things are — slums and cess- 
pools, saloons and pig-pens — there the 
people grow weak and die." 

, "Why halt ye, Israel, between two 
opinions? If God be God, follow 
Him ; if Bacchus, then follow him." 

God help us all to know the truth 
and to have strength to live it, is 
my prayer, and I ask it in the name 
of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

PKESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 

I think the natural inquiry that 
would arise in the minds of all 
present this morning after listening 
to the remarks which we have 
heard would be, can we as intel- 
ligent men and women, professing 
to be honest before God, resist the 
force, the justice and the righteous- 
ness of the appeals that are being 
made to us? Can we do it? I say 
we cannot and be Latter-day 
Saints.

ELDER ANTHONY W. IVINS. 

Past 83 years of Church's history 
proves its divine origin — Prophecies 
fulfilled concerning re-establishment 
of Church — Multitude of details con- 
firming fact that this is God's work 
— No other people fulfilling proph- 
ecies, nor possessing completeness 
of Christ's Gospel. 

"Think not that I am come to de- 
stroy the law, or the prophets: I am 
not come to destroy, but to fulfil. 

"For verily I say unto you, Till 
heaven and earth pass, one jot or one 
tittle shall in no wise pass from the 
law, till all be fulfilled." 

I have been thinking of these 
words of the Savior, my brethren 
and sisters, since the beginning of 
this conference, and applying them 
to the establishment and develop-

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



merit, of the Church. More than 
eighty-three years have elapsed 
since the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints was established. 
At its organization, on the 6th of 
April, 1830, there were but six per- 
sons present who were recognized 
as members of the Church, and who 
participated in the business which 
was transacted. Now, after the 
lapse of these years, hundreds of 
thousands of people profess mem- 
bership in the Church. Many thous- 
ands of those people are here in-this 
city, and are participating in the ex- 
ercises of this conference. At the 
time of its establishment, men who 
were not familiar with the forces 
which were at work in its develop- 
ment, and which had brought it into 
existence, unbelievers, might with a 
degree of consistency have thought, 
or said, that it was just another 
movement in which a new religious 
denomination was being established 
by a man who had discovered errors 
in existing religious organizations, 
or that it was the work of a simple 
enthusiast who believed that the 
Lord had called him to establish a 
new church, or that it was the de- 
liberate plan of an imposter who 
sought to take advantage of the 
wave of religious reform which was 
sweeping over the country, to the 
accomplishment of his own selfish 
ourposes. In either event it might 
have been thought, as was often 
said, that if left alone it, like many 
such movements which had preced- 
ed it. would come to naught. It is 
not unusual that, in their inception, 
the success of many great move- 
ments which have resulted in ines- 
timable benefit to mankind has been 
doubted. It is not at all unusual 
that movements which have been in- 
augurated with every prospect of 
success have proven to be failures. 



So it is only after experience has 
given evidence by which we may 
reach conclusions that we may in- 
telligently determine results. 

Men who have addressed us at 
this conference have borne strong 
testimony to the divinity of this 
work and to its ultimate triumph. 
That testimony, if unsupported by 
evidence, our faith, even devotion 
to that which we may believe, if we 
are professed Christians, must be 
supported by the word of the Lord. 
I am a believer in these words of 
the Savior which I have read, as I 
am in all of His words; and if He 
spoke the truth then we and the 
religious world must be in harmony 
with the law and the prophets, for 
if they are to be fulfilled not one 
jot or tittle is to pass. Then if we 
profess faith in Christ and claim, 
as we do, that He is the author of 
the establishment of the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 
we ought to be able to show that in 
its development as well as in its es- 
tablishment, it is in harmony with 
the law and with the prophets, for 
by this measure sometime all relig- 
ious denominations will have to be 
judged. 

Then I have thought as I have 
looked into the faces of these mag- 
nificent congregations of Latter-day 
Saints, which have assembled here, 
that if the words of the prophets 
are true, Christ Himself, being the 
greatest of them all, we know, we 
have this assurance, that at some- 
time subsequent to the period in 
which He ministered in the flesh. 
His gospel must come back to earth 
and be established again among 
men. He taught this to His disci- 
ples from the beginning, that He 
must leave them, that He must 
suffer for the sins of the world, but 
just as He testified of His glorious 



ELDER ANTHONY W. IVINS. 



109 



resurrection from the dead, so He 
told them that the time would come 
when His gospel would again be 
preached upon earth for the redemp- 
tion of his covenant people. Re- 
garded in a general sense, that 
would be a little indefinite, and so 
they asked Him what should be the 
sign of His coming and of the end 
of the world. He warned them that 
they be not deceived, that many 
should come in His name and de- 
ceive many, that false prophets 
would arise and false Christs would 
arise, and that if possible their 
sophistry would be such that it 
would deceive the very elect ; but, 
this He gave them as a guide, 
wherever the body is there will the 
eagles be gathered together, or in 
other words, wherever My gospel is 
preached, wherever the Church of 
Christ shall exist, there will the 
fruits of the Gospel be manifest 
among the people. That restora- 
tion was to be in the latter days. 
It was to be in a time when king- 
doms would be divided, one against 
the other; it was to be in a time 
when there would be religious con- 
fusion, when one would cry lo here 
and another lo there, a time when 
there would be war in the land and 
contention and earthquakes, and 
when the sea would heave itself be- 
yond its bounds, and the people of 
the world be in confusion. 

Now that is not all that was asso- 
ciated with this idea of the restora- 
tion of the Gospel. He told us just 
how it should come, not handed 
down continuously from the time of 
the apostles to be preached to the 
inhabitants of the earth, but to come 
through the ministry of an angel, 
which John saw in that glorious 
vision that was given him of the 
Savior, while upon the isle of 
Patmos, having the everlasting 



Gospel to preach to them that dwelt 
upon the earth, calling men to re- 
pentance with a loud voice, warn- 
ing them that the judgments of the 
Almighty were at hand. And that 
was not all, it was to be at a period 
of restitution, the restitution of all 
things spoken by the mouths of the 
holy prophets, these prophets to 
which I have referred, the priest- 
hood, the ordinances of the Church, 
the hearts of the fathers were to be 
turned to the children, and vigorous 
work for the dead established, in- 
augurated in the day of the estab- 
lishment of God's Church. It was 
to be a dispensation of gathering, 
not only restoration so far as the 
doctrines of the Gospel were con- 
cerned, but a time when scattered 
Israel should be gathered, for the 
prophets had said to them that 
though they be scattered to the ut- 
termost parts of heaven, yet the 
Father said "will I gather you from 
thence and bring you back to the 
lands of your inheritance, and will 
fulfil the promises that I have made 
to your fathers." So we may ex- 
pect not only a restoration of the 
Gospel but a restitution of the or- 
dinances of the Church and a gath- 
ering together of the Lord's people. 

And more than that, He made 
clear the condition under which that 
gathering should take place, that He 
would send out His messengers 
unto the world, and they should 
hunt them out from among the na- 
tions, they should bring one of a 
city and two of a family, and they 
would come out to some place that 
they called Zion with songs of ever- 
lasting praise. We are not left in 
doubt either so far as that place is 
concerned. It was to be in the 
mountains. Do you not remember 
that Isaiah said in the last days the 
mountain of the house of the Lord 



110 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



should be established, and that it 
should be established too in the tops 
of the mountains, and that all na- 
tions should flow unto it, that 
many people should come and say 
"Let us go up to the mountain of 
the Lord's house, to the house of the 
God of Jacob, that we may be 
taught His ways and learn to walk 
in His paths." It was not a fruitful 
land but a desert land, if the proph- 
ets are to be fulfilled ; for this same 
man told us that the wilderness 
should be made glad because of 
them at the time of this gathering 
together, and it shall rejoice abund- 
antly and blossom as the rose; that 
in the desert streams of water 
should break forth and pools in the 
desert places. 

Now, my brethren and sisters, I 
cannot take time to continue quota- 
tions of this character which indi- 
cate to me and which I love to study 
and to contemplate, and which have 
been, outlined by prophets of God 
which have lived before us, and re- 
fer to the dispensation in which we 
live. Read the scripture, study it, 
and you will find that I have only 
mentioned a few of that great mul- 
titude of details which must be 
brought harmoniously together 
wherever the work of the Lord is 
to be accomplished. Then I have 
looked back over these eighty-three 
years and asked myself the ques- 
tion, does the history and develop- 
ment of the Church fit in to these 
prophesies? Are they being ful- 
filled? Have they been? The tes- 
timony of the spirit comes to me 
that in every detail from the organi- 
zation of the Church until this year 
of grace, 1913, gradually but surely 
the Church of Christ has justified 
the declaration which we make to 
the world that it was divinely estab- 
lished and that it is established for 



the redemption of His covenant 
people. The Gospel came just as 
the Lord said that it should come. 
Joseph Smith did not assume, as 
other men had assumed, to estab- 
lish a new church, another sectarian 
Christian denomination until God 
had authorized him to do it. He un- 
derstood full well that he could not 
give that which he himself did not 
possess. Notwithstanding the fact 
that in that glorious vision the 
Father and Son had manifested 
to him, notwithstanding the fact 
that he had there been told that 
there was a great work for him to 
perform, notwithstanding the fact 
that Moroni had visited him and 
talked with him and instructed him, 
and entrusted to him the plates from 
which this Book of Mormon was 
translated, which he did, for those 
things are true and certain as any 
truth of heaven, but yet he made no 
effort, he took no steps looking to 
the establishment of a church, but 
as he read there he found, as he 
undoubtedly had observed before, 
that baptism was essential to the sal- 
vation of man. Christ had said that 
a man could not enter into the king- 
dom of heaven except he were bap- 
tized, born of water and of the 
Spirit, and as he translated from 
those plates he found that doctrine 
reiterated there, and in the humility 
of his soul, just as he had done be- 
fore, he went to the Lord. I have 
never thought that he anticipated 
that which was to occur. He be- 
lieved that his prayer would be 
heard and answered, but he himself 
and Oliver Cowdery who was with 
him, declared that the human mind 
cannot conceive the joy that entered 
into their souls when John the Bap- 
tist, descending in a cloud of light, 
came from heaven, laying his hands 
upon their heads, ordained them to

Ill 



the Aaronic Priesthood and con- 
ferred upon them the keys of that 
priesthood which holds the right of 
the preaching of the Gospel of re- 
pentance, baptism by immersion for 
the remission of sins. 

Then this gospel dispensation was 
opened ; then they had authority to 
confer upon others that which the 
Lord through His servant had con- 
ferred upon them, to preach the 
Gospel, to administer in the ordi- 
nances of the Church which belong 
to that lesser order of the priest- 
hood. Then came the restoration of 
the Melchizedek Preisthood; then 
came the keys of the turning of the 
hearts of the fathers to the children 
and the children to the fathers, and 
which authorizes the work which is 
being done in these temples of the 
Lord. Then came authority to go 
into all the world and preach the 
Gospel to every creature, and to 
gather up the outcasts of Israel, 
bring them here to the tops of these 
mountains that they might be taught 
the word of the Lord and learn to 
walk in His paths, this desert land 
which has been made to blossom, 
this desert land where pools of 
water now stand, streams have 
broken forth, where the voices of 
music and children are heard upon 
the streets, in a country which was' 
once a barren waste, this land which 
is full of gold and silver, just as the 
prophets said that the land of gath- 
ering should be. 

So, my brethren and sisters, I 
thank God that from the very begin- 
ning we have been in harmony with 
the law and with the prophets, that 
they are being fulfilled. I testify to 
you of it. I know that Joseph Smith 
was no imposter. I know that he 
assumed to do nothing except that 
which he was authorized to do of 
the Lord. I know that the men who 



have succeeded him have followed 
in his footsteps, every one of them, 
and that today in the Church its 
strength is greater and its influence 
for good is greater than it has ever 
been before in its history, and' that 
nothing under heaven except trans- 
gression by the people themselves 
can stay the progress and develop- 
ment of this work of the Lord, be- 
cause the law and the prophets are 
to be fulfilled as Christ declared, 
and if they are to be fulfilled you 
may look in all the world in vain 
to find a people who are fulfilling 
them away from the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 

My brethren and sisters, become 
familiar with the prophets, become 
familiar with the scripture, under- 
stand, so far as it is possible, and 
it is possible to understand because 
God will help us if we desire, the 
importance of this great work in 
which we are engaged, and that 
there are yet many of those sacred 
and precious promises and proph- 
cies in future. This is Christ's 
Church, it is entrusted to us, we are 
His shepherds, we are developing it, 
establishing it, gathering in His 
covenant and scattered people, to 
the end that He may come to the 
Church, which He will do, because 
that is another one of the proph- 
ecies, that He will come in the 
clouds of heaven to us to vindicate 
our work and bear witness to the 
world of the everlasting truths of 
the doctrines which we preach and 
the work which we have accom- 
plished. 

The Lord help us to keep the 
faith, that we may be prepared for 
His glorious kingdom and coming, 
when it shall be established in full- 
ness, in power and dominion upon 
the earth, I pray, through Jesus 
Christ. Amen.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



PATRIARCH HYRUM G. SMITH. 

I am very grateful, my brethren 
and sisters, for the privilege of be- 
ing present at this conference, to 
hear the word of the Lord, and the 
testimonies of His servants. I can 
bear testimony to the truthfulness 
of all that has been said. I rejoice 
in the testimony of the Gospel. I 
know that this is the work of the 
Lord, and that He has intrusted it 
unto us. It is our duty to deliver 
it unto the world. It has been given 
unto us freely, and freely we give 
it unto them; and as the different 
individuals all over the world accept 
the Gospel, — without regard to race, 
nationality, or creed — and live ac- 
cording to its teachings, they join 
with us in the love which is common 
to all faithful Latter-day Saints. 

During this conference we had 
the pleasure of listening to a prayer 
by one of our brothers of another 
race, offered in our language, and 
I rejoiced in his prayer. I rejoice 
with all my brethren and sisters who 
accept and faithfully live the Gos- 
pel, no matter where they come 
from. The Gospel is sweet to me, 
and to all who join in that common 
love for the truth, when it has been 
made plain unto them, and they 
have been blessed with courage and 
strength to obey its teachings. We 
rejoice together in the knowledge 
of the plan of redemption, for we 
are given the privilege to walk ac- 
cording to the teachings of our Sav- 
ior, and by obeying them we shall 
return unto Him and share in that 
eternal love of our Father which is 
in heaven. This is my testimony 
and I rejoice in it. 

I thank the Lord for the many 
privileges that have come to me in 
associating with the general author- 
ities of the Church, those whom the 



Lord has called to direct His work 
in the earth today. I rejoice in the 
teachings of the Gospel, and in the 
testimonies that have been borne in 
this conference, and in the instruc- 
tions we have received ; they are the 
word of the Lord to us. The many 
thousands gathered together in the 
different sessions of this conference 
have listened to these words, and 
they are words' that should be re- 
membered by all. It is our duty 
now, as Latter-day Saints, as chil- 
dren of our Father in heaven, to 
carry these teachings home and 
make use of them. We are weak — 
for we are earthly ; we need remind- 
ing; we are frail creatures, to a cer- 
tain extent, and are subject to weak- 
nesses both of mind and body. We 
are very dependent creatures and 
need constant reminding of our du- 
ties. That is one of the purposes 
of this great gathering, and of other 
gatherings at our homes in the 
wards and stakes of Zion. 

I pray that our Father in heaven 
will give us strength, even if we 
are weak and mortal, to carry to 
our homes the great teachings 
which we have been reminded of, 
and then live according to our du- 
ties as Latter-day Saints. 

You know, brethren and sisters, 
that we are not of the world. We 
have come out of the world, there- 
fore we are different from the 
world ; these worldly things that we 
are prone to adopt in our lives, we 
have been warned to leave alone ; 
and where they have taken posses- 
sion of us, and we look upon them 
as weaknesses, from a spiritual and 
progressive standpoint, they should 
be overcome. We should go forth 
in the strength which our Father 
has given us, that spiritual strength 
by which we live, and we will grow 
fly receiving and putting into prac-

tice the teachings of this conference, 
and those we receive from the Lord, 
through His servants, from time to 
time. Let us rise above our weak- 
nesses by commencing today to live 
better lives. It is a simple thing to 
commence, but it takes faith to en- 
dure to the end. There may be 
weaknesses in our lives which have 
grown upon us and become habits, 
so that it will be somewhat difficult 
for some of us to leave them off at 
once, or of our own strength, we 
must have the help of the Lord ; and 
it can be secured through humility 
in prayer and in obedience to the 
laws of His Gospel. 

I thank the Lord for the teachings 
of the Gospel, and do pray that His 
Spirit will give us strength to com- 
mence now to reform and live as 
Latter-day Saints, and not as if we 
were living in Babylon. We can 
overcome our tendencies toward 
disease, sin, and decay, by heeding 
the remindings and teachings given 
by President Smith in the first ses- 
sion of this conference. 

Now, with the power that has 
been given to me to bless, I desire 
to bless this congregation and all 
Israel, that we may see and study 
the conditions by which we are sur- 
rounded, and in the strength that 
has been given us have power to 
overcome them, become better, and 
conform more nearly to the teach- 
ings of our Master; that we may 
prepare this earth for His coming. 
This is my prayer, in the name of 
Jesus' Christ. Amen. 

ELDER JOSEPH E. EOBINSON. 

(President of California Mission.) 

With you, my brethren and sis- 
ters, I rejoice in the testimony of 
the brethren who have addressed us 
and in the fact that we are pointed 



back to first principles. It is a mat- 
ter that I had thought upon because 
of some recent experiences. I had 
recalled the testimony of Paul to 
the ancient Galatians, wherein he 
said he marveled because they had 
been called so soon to another gos- 
pel which, however, was not a gos- 
pel, for there is but one, which is 
the power of God unto salvation; 
and as He told Timothy, men have 
lulled themselves to sleep, having 
itching ears, and they have had 
teachers after their own lusts, who 
have pleased their fancies and have 
drawn them away from the truths 
of the everlasting Gospel. In the 
world, men are declaring today that 
there is no such thing as sin, only as 
a person may conceive it in his own 
mind; that all things are as they 
should be, and that evil is only to 
those who think evil. One of our 
greatest churches, one of late 
growth too, is largely responsible, 
I take it, for this mental atitude of 
the people abroad. I was astound- 
ed, while coming to this city, to 
find among five gentlemen, who are 
well read and widely traveled, thest 
very thoughts that I am expressing 
to you now, and that the pleasures 
of life were more desirable than the 
things which we look upon as of 
eternal worth, and that they were 
more punctilious in the observance 
of the so-called pleasures than they 
were in the obligations to uphold 
and defend the right and preserve 
the morals of the public, and to help 
maintain civic probity. So I take 
it as most timely, to the Latter-day 
Saints, that we should be admon- 
ished anew of the things for which 
our fathers came out of the old 
world and for which they planted us 
securely in the tops of the moun- 
tains, for which they denied their 
own appetites and made it possible 



114 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



for us to enjoy here, through their 
experiences, the blessings and the 
blessedness of the everlasting cove- 
nant. 

I rejoice today in noting the 
strength that has returned to Elder 
George Albert Smith, and I want 
to add just one testimony to the tes- 
timony of faith as expounded by 
him namely ; that it is through faith 
that his life has been spared and that 
you heard him speak in such good 
voice and form today. I think I 
know as well as any man, the trials 
which he has undergone, how hum- 
ble and patient he has been through 
it all, striving only to magnify his 
office and calling, and asking if he 
could not do so, that God would take 
him away from this earth that an- 
other might fill his place. The 
prayers of the Saints have prevailed, 
thank the Lord for that, and for his 
presence today. 

f miss, as I never believed I 
could, the presence of my fellow 
servant the late Elder Ben E. Rich ; 
I miss the earnest and warm grasp 
of his hand, his kindly expressions, 
bis spontaneous wit and humor and 
cheerfulness that would disarm an 
enemy, and his magnanimous gen- 
erosity that would make a friend of 
that same enemy. I have looked 
upon him as the ideal Seventy, al- 
most, of this people : I have regard- 
ed him as an ideal missionary, and 
in the rich heritage of his testimony, 
in word and deed and pen. I feel 
that incumbent upon me with my 
co-laborers is the obligation that we 
shall sustain and uphold the stand- 
ard of truth and of righteousness 
and the restored Gospel of the 
Christ as Ben E. Rich ever did in 
the world. 

I want to admonish you, my 
brethren and sisters, that we cannot 
neglect our duties and hope to 



escape punishment. As Paul said, 
how can we unto whom this great 
salvation has come hope to escape, 
if we neglect so great salvation ; and 
there is such a thing as believing 
in vain. For, in addressing the Cor- 
inthian saints, telling them of the 
Gospel in which they then stood and 
by which they will be saved, he said, 
"unless ye have believed in vain." 
It has made me sad to hear, — I was 
going to say the admonitions, and I 
may say the spirit of some of those 
admonitions, that prove to me that 
among us at home, those from 
whom we expect so much, whom 
we hold up to the world as the 
very ensamples of light and truth, 
of honor and sobriety, proves 
that we have neglected at home, and 
that we forget and are unmindful of 
the teachings of our brethren and of 
the obligations that are laid upon us 
and that we ourselves have assumed. 
You expect much of us, my brethren 
and sisters, who are in the mission- 
ary . field ; you expect that we shall 
walk the line of strict propriety, that 
no untoward thing shall be done by 
us who are missionaries, that shall 
bring disrepute upon you at home 
and upon the cause of the Master, 
but that we shall give our whole 
heart-power, and all the virtues that 
we are possessed of to maintain the 
excellency of your good repute. Can 
we not expect as much of you ? 
Have we not the right, when we 
turn our eyes Zionward. as we speak 
of these mountains and valleys, to 
think that here are the very elect 
of the earth, the salt of the earth, 
and that here there can and shall 
be no iniquity flourish? that there 
the standard of probity in all things 
shall be made unsullied? 

I want to tell you one little ex- 
perience on the coast last year, that 
I had when speaking of the evils in

the world. I was confronted with 
the fact that in Idaho and Utah 
alone, of all these United States, 
was book-making- for the races in- 
dulged in the open race courses ob- 
taining-. I am glad to know that that 
has been curtailed since the time I 
am speaking of. I want to tell you 
that not only the eyes of some of 
the philosophers of the world, the 
thoughtful men, — and students who 
are loking into the future for the 
conservation of the integrity of the 
American people and the people of 
the world, not only the eyes of these 
men are upon us but from the lowly 
walks of life we receive daily tes- 
timony that we are being watched 
' in all of our ways and all of our do- 
ings. A young elder bore testimony 
to me, three weeks ago, that fre- 
quently in San Francisco, recently, 
he had been asked by individuals : 
"Do you people intend to build 
here? Are you doing anything to- 
wards establishing yourselves in this 
city? We want to know." And his 
curiosity was aroused, and so to 
one man who seemed very earnest in 
the matter, he said : "Why do vou 
ask this question?" He replied : "Be- 
cause I want to tell you, young man, 
we are watching you. and if your 
people go out of here, some of us 
wil be close behind you." Thus in- 
dicating the fact that he felt in the 
actions of the "Mormon" people 
could be found an example that 
could be safely followed even in ma- 
terial things. 

Through the graciousness of the 
Trustee-in-trust, and some of our 
good friends who have assisted us, 
and the Saints in the mission field, 
we have been able to erect a most 
beautiful chapel in Los Angeles, 
with a home for the presiding au- 
thority of the mission, also mission 
home and office for our office force 



and elders. Commercially speak- 
ing, since this has been done, our 
stock has advanced a hundred per 
cent and more. People who before 
were indifferent towards us, when 
they see what we have done, have 
been led to interest themselves and 
to seek our society, to ask advice 
and counsel at our hands, and they 
want to know what we think of 
various conditions other than that 
which we call religious. This of- 
fers an opportunity for telling- 
something of the Gospel ; and it is 
good to know that the man who 
thinks, sees the hand of the Lord 
in our success in reclaiming the 
waste places of Zion and in build- 
ing up in the greater centers of the 
land an evidence of the fact that 
God is with this people ; that there 
is something virile and potent in 
the Gospel for by it and with the 
excellency of our institutions we re- 
alize many blessings — the longevity 
of the lives of our people, as re- 
corded by the statistics given, the 
peace that obtains in our homes, the 
binding power of the everlasting 
covenant, the keeping of the word of 
wisdom, — all an outgrowth and 
product of the Gospel of the Lord 
Jesus. Men used to look upon our 
success rather from a commercial 
standpoint, as communism and co- 
operation, but today they are begin- 
ning to see there is more than that 
in it ; and it is significant to me, 
when men will say that they read 
in it the essence of religion, and that 
if it be the result of "Mormonism," 
so-called, that they see the need of 
"Mormonism" in their own homes, 
in their own communities, and in 
their own churches. I bear witness 
unto you that God lives ; that Jesus 
is the Christ ; that Joseph Smith 
was a prophet ; that we have, as we 
sang, founded our faith on a sure 



116 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



foundation, not only of prophets, 
apostles, evangelists, and pastors, 
and deacons as we have them, to 
dispense the living word to us daily, 
but in that same testimony that 
came to Peter when he bore wit- 
ness to the Christ that He was the 
Son of God, and the Master said: 
"Man hath not revealed this unto 
thee but my Father which is in 
heavens, and upon this rock shall I 
build My Church, and the gates of 
hell shall not prevail against it." 
In this statement I read more than 
the fact that a knowledge was re- 
vealed to Peter, a philosophy, or an 
understanding that Jesus was the 
Christ, but the testimony itself, 
burned into his soul, that Jesus was 
the Son of God, that he knew that 
God lived; and this, we are told by 
the Master, is life eternal, and 
surely the gates of hell shall not 
prevail against the testimony of the 
Lord Jesus Christ. 

May the Lord keep us in His 
love for ever more, guide us to His 
praise, and wean us away from the 
vanities of the flesh and the world, 
I ask, in Jesus' name. Amen. 

The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn, "Love at home." 

Benediction was pronounced by 
Elder Joseph S- Geddes. 

Conference adjourned until 2 p.m. 



CLOSING SESSION. 

In the Tabernacle, at 2 p. m. 

President Joseph F. Smith called 
the meeting to order. 

The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn : 

For the strength of the hills we bless 
Thee, 

Our God, our fathers' God; 
Thou hast made Thy children mighty, 
By the touch of the mountain sod. 



Prayer was offered by Elder 
James W. Lesueur. 

The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn : 

God moves in a mysterious way, 
His wonders to perform; 

He plants His footsteps in the sea, 
And rides upon the storm. 



ELDER JAMES E. TALMAGE. 

Our bodies gifts from God— Spirit and. 
body combined constitute the soul of 
man — The fall of man consisted in a 
violation of what we now call the 
Word of Wisdom — The Fall not a 
breach of law of chastity — Adam and 
Eve were and are beings of exalted 
station — Knowledge of good and evil, 
how gained — Pre-existence and life 
beyond the grave — Modern theolo- 
gians preaching what was once exclus- 
ively "Mormon" doctrines. 

i 

I am very grateful for the op- 
portunity of adding my testimony 
to the many strong testimonies to- 
which we have listened during this 
conference. As I listened to the 
opening address, I heard echoing 
through the alcoves of my mind, 
what I have since heard in song and 
quotation: "We thank Thee, O 
God for a Prophet ;" and many 
times during the course of subse- 
quent addresses I have said in my 
heart, "I thank Thee, O God, for 
prophets in Israel, who are not 
afraid to speak out and tell the peo- 
ple the needs of the hour, and 
preach unto them the doctrines of 
the day, and call attention to the 
things of present moment and im- 
portance." I was heartily in accord 
with the instruction given in that 
first address as indeed I have been 
with all the instructions given, but 
I have in mind particularly that re- 
lating to the neglect which we oft'- 



ELDER JAMES E. TALMAGE. 



117 



times manifest in regard to spiritual 
things. We have been warned 
against giving too much attention 
to things of this world, to the ne- 
glect of the things that are of 
greater worth. On the other hand, 
we have heard much concerning 
practical duties, practical affairs, 
temporal religion if you please ; and 
we have been, by implication, 
warned against' devoting ourselves 
exclusively to that other worldli- 
ness which is quite as dangerous as 
extereme wordliness. 

We have been told, as many of 
us know, and knew before, that this 
life is a necessary part in the course 
of progression designed by our Fa- 
ther. We have been taught, again, 
to look upon these bodies of ours as 
gifts from God. We Latter-day 
Saints do not regard the body as 
something to be condemned, some- 
thing to be abhorred, and something 
to be subdued in the sense in which 
that expression is oft-times heard 
in the world. We regard as the 
sign of our royal birthright, that 
we have bodies upon the earth. We 
recognize the fact that those who 
kept not their first estate, in the 
primeval existence, were denied that 
inestimable blessing, the taking of 
mortal bodies. We believe that these 
bodies are to be well cared for, that 
they are to be looked upon as some- 
thing belonging to the Lord, and 
that each may be made, in very 
truth, the temple of the Holy Ghost, 
the place into which the Spirit of 
God shall enter and where He shall 
delight to dwell, if He shall find 
there cleanliness and order and pur- 
ity and uprightness of thought and 
conduct. 

It is peculiar to the theology of 
the Latter-day Saints that we re- 
gard the body as an essential part 
of the soul. Read your dictionaries, 



the lexicons, and encyclopedias, and 
you will find that nowhere, outside 
of the Church of Jesus Christ, is the 
solemn and eternal truth taught that 
the soul of man is the body and the 
spirit combined. It is quite the 
rule to regard the soul as that incor- 
poreal part of men, that immortal 
part which existed before the body 
was framed and which shall con- 
tinue to exist after that body has 
gone to decay; nevertheless, that is 
not the soul; that is only a part of 
the soul ; that is the spirit-man, the 
form in which every individual of 
us, and every individual human 
being, existed before called to take 
tabernacle in the flesh. It has been 
declared in the solemn word of 
revelation, that the spirit and the 
body constitute the soul of man; 
and, therefore, we should look upon 
this body as something that shall 
endure in the resurrected state, be- 
yond the grave, something to be 
kept pure and holy. Be not afraid 
of soiling its hands ; be not afraid of 
scars that may come to it if won in 
earnest effort, or in honest fight, but 
beware of scars that disfigure, that 
have come to you in places where 
you ought not have gone, that have 
befallen you in unworthy undertak- 
ings ; beware of the wounds' of bat- 
tles in which you have been fight- 
ing on the wrong side. 

I read that when our first parents 
were placed in the place provided 
for them, that at their creation, at 
the creation of the first man, his 
body was prepared ; then God, the 
God of life, breathed into him the 
breath of life, and then and not be- 
fore did man become a living soul. 
It was the advancement from the 
spirit state to the soul state that 
marked the great gift of God unto 
man, namely, life here upon the 
earth, an existence that shall' pre- 



118 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



pare us for the life that lies beyond 
the grave. The resurrection of the 
body, the resurrection from the 
dead, is the redemption of the soul ; 
and as Christ was the first to break 
the bonds of death and to take up 
His body, the body that had been 
slain, from which the spirit had 
temporarily departed, as by. Him 
and through Him came the resur- 
rection, by Him and through Him 
came the redemption of the soul, 
and hence He won for Himself the 
title that belongs to none other, on 
earth or in heaven, the Redeemer of 
mankind. 

We have heard much in regard 
to the dutes we owe to these bodies 
in keeping from them the things that 
are hurtful, the things that are de- 
grading, the things that poison the 
tissues, the things that break down 
the very organism that God has cre- 
ated. Time has not permitted those 
who have spoken before me to dwell 
at length, any more than it per- 
mits me to dwell at length on that 
important revelation of God unto 
man, of God unto Israel in these the 
last days, by which man may be 
wise — the Word of Wisdom. This, 
like other revelations that have come 
in the present dispensation, is not 
wholly hew. It is as old as the hu- 
man race. The principle of the 
Word of Wisdom was revealed unto 
Adam. All the essentials of the 
Word of Wisdom were made known 
unto him in his immortal state, be- 
fore he had taken into his body those 
things that made of it a thing of 
earth. He was warned against that 
very practice. He was not told to 
treat his body as something to be 
tortured. He was not told to look 
upon it as the fakirs of India have 
come to look upon it, or profess to 
look upon it, as a thing to be utterly 
contemned, but he was told that he 



must not take into that body cer- 
tain things which were there at 
hand. He was warned that, if he 
did, his body would lose the power 
which it then held of living for 
ever, and that he would become 
subject to death. It was pointed out 
to him, as it has been pointed out to 
you, that there are many good fruits 
to be plucked, to be eaten, to be en- 
joyed. We believe tn enjoying good 
food. We think that these good 
things are given us of God. We 
believe in getting all the enjoyment 
out of eating that we can ; and, 
therefore, we should avoid gluttony, 
and we should avoid extremes in all 
our habits of eating ; and as was told 
unto Adam, so is it told unto us, 
"Touch not these things; for in the 
day that thou cloest it thy life shall 
be shortened and thou shalt die." 

Here, let me say, that therein con- 
sisted the fall — the eating of things 
unfit, the taking into the body of the 
things that made of that body a 
thing of earth ; and I take this oc- 
casion to raise my voice against the 
false interpretation of scripture, 
which in some instances has been 
adopted by certain people, and is 
current in their minds, and is re- 
ferred to in a hushed and half-sec- 
ret way, that the fall of man con- 
sisted in some offense against the 
laws of chastity and of virtue. Such 
a doctrine is an abomination. What 
right have we to turn the scriptures 
from their proper sense and mean- 
ing? What right have we to de- 
clare that God meant not what He 
said? The fall was a natural pro- 
cess, resulting through the incorpor- 
ation into the bodies of our first 
parents of the things that came from 
food unfit, through the violation of 
the command of God regarding 
what thev should eat. Don't go 
around whispering that the fall con- 



ELDER JAMES E. TALMAGE. 



119 



sisted in the mother of the race los- 
ing her chastity and her virtue. It 
is not true ; the human race is not 
born of fornication. These bodies 
that are given unto us are given in 
the way that God has provided. Let 
it not be said that the patriarch of 
the race, who stood with the gods 
before he came here upon the earth, 
and his equally royal consort, were 
guilty of any such foul offense. The 
adoption of that belief has led many 
to excuse departures from the path 
of chastity and the path of virtue, 
by saying that it is the sin of the 
race, it is as old as Adam. It was 
not introduced by Adam. It was 
not committed by Eve. It was the 
introduction of the devil and came 
in order that he might sow the seeds 
of early death in the bodies of men 
and women, that the race should 
degenerate as it has degenerated 
whenever the laws of virtue and of 
chastity have been transgressed. 

Our first parents were pure and 
noble, and when we pass behind the 
veil we shall perhaps learn some- 
thing of their high estate, more than 
we know now. But be it known that 
they were pure ; they were noble. 
It is true that they disobeyed the 
law of God, in eating things they 
were told not to eat; but who 
amongst you can rise up and con- 
demn? I listened not long ago to 
a lesson conducted as a model les- 
son, in a Sunday School class ; it 
had to deal with the fall of man. The 
one who was appointed to pass cri- 
ticism thereon, expressed his hearty 
approval of the lesson as it had been 
rendered, and particularly compli- 
mented the teacher on having been 
able to conduct a lesson "on such a 
delicate subject as that, with a 
mixed class of young boys and 
voting girls, and not offend !" What 
is there delicate about the fall of 



man? The sexual element does not 
enter into the subject. The fall 
consisted in disobedience of the 
commands as to what things were 
fit for the body, and we have been 
falling in the same way ever since; 
and you have been warned about it 
by authoritative voices here in the 
several sessions of this conference. 
If you would live to the full meas- 
ure of your days, as God intended 
you to, then live according to the 
command of God in all these 
things. Ye may eat of the fruits 
of all these good trees ; you may 
partake to the full, within the limits 
of- wisdom and propriety, but of 
that tree of the knowledge of ter- 
rible evil you ought not to partake. 
Oh, if you do, you will get ex- 
perience that you otherwise would 
not get ; you will know more about 
evil, and by contrast can perhaps 
estimate, in a different way, the 
good ; but, nevertheless, you will 
find that you have purchased that 
knowledge at very great price. We 
are to be judged by what we know, 
as much and as well as by what 
we do not know. For, do you re- 
member, after they, our first par- 
ents, had undertaken to set up their 
own judgment above the judg- 
ment of the God who made them 
and who prepared the place for 
their abode, and who gave them 
commandment, they had knowledge 
that they did not possess before, 
and when next they were called by 
the voice of God, they hid them- 
selves ; for they had awakened to 
the fact that there was something 
vile about them, something un- 
seemingly, something unclean, and 
they hid themselves ; and mark you 
the words with which their guilt 
was brought home. When Adam 
declared that he had heard the voice 
of God calling him, and he had 



120 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



hidden himself because he had be- 
come aware of the fact that he was 
naked, the question was : "Who told 
thee that thou wast naked ?" Where 
did Adam and Eve get that knowl- 
edge? Not by keeping the com- 
mandments of God, but by viola- 
tion thereof. So I sometimes say 
when I find young men and young 
women showing by unguarded 
words or actions, that they know 
things they ought not to know, who 
told you that? Where have you 
been? What have you been doing? 
The time has not come for you to 
learn those things yet; and you 
never would have learned them at 
this stage of your advancement, and 
in this way, if you had not trans- 
gressed the laws of God. 

What has been said concerning 
our duties to our bodies in this life 
and the strict attention we should 
give to spiritual things, tells us of 
the life that is to come and of the 
relation between this life and that. 
We hear much nowadays as to the 
speculative ideas of men concern- 
ing the condition beyond the grave ; 
but the admission that there is an 
individual existence beyond the 
grave, is a declaration that there 
must have been an individual, in- 
telligent creation before we came 
here in the flesh. Life beyond the 
grave postulates a pre-existent state 
to which reference was made yes- 
terday. While the world admits 
the pre-existence of Christ and 
points to Him as one who before 
mortal birth shared with His Father 
in the honors of the godhead and in 
the powers of the Creator, they 
deny to the souls that are now upon 
the earth, and those that had lived 
as mortals, a pre-existent condition. 
I want to read to you one scripture 
bearing upon that subject and I read 
to you from the Book of Abraham, 



a scripture with which some of our 
people are better acquainted today 
than they were a year ago, because 
of the futile attempts that have been 
made to discredit it. By the fail- 
ures that have resulted in these at- 
tempts, the strength of the faith of 
our people has been increased. The 
great patriarch says : "Now, the 
Lord had shown unto me, Abraham, 
the intelligences that were organized 
before the world was, and among 
all these there were many of the 
noble and great ones ; and God saw 
these souls that they were good, and 
He stood in the midst of them and 
He said, 'These I will make my 
rulers ;' for He stood among those 
that were spirits, and He saw that 
they were good, and He said unto 
me, Abraham, 'Thou are one of 
them ; thou wast chosen before thou 
wast born.' " Read the rest of that 
scripture for yourselves. 

I am happy to see that the saving 
principles proclaimed by the proph- 
ets of this dispensation are spread- 
ing through the world, in spite of 
all attempts to the contrary. If the 
morning papers have correctly re- 
ported a lecture delivered in this city 
last night, there is in our midst a 
scholar from London who has pro- 
claimed not only that the scriptures 
prove that there is and must of ne- 
cessity be an intelligent individual 
existence beyond the grave, but that 
in that state there will be oppor- 
tunity for repentance and for pro- 
gression. Now, that is a "Mormon" 
doctrine which never had been 
broached in the modern religious 
world until the voice of the Prophet 
Joseph Smith was heard. Sectarian 
ministers now tell us that no longer 
are the scriptures to be twisted ; that 
by the figure which says, "Where 
the tree falleth there shall it be," we 
are not longer to understand that a

man who dies can never progress. 
Learned divines and theologians are 
lifting their voices today in declara- 
tion of the fact that God has pro- 
vided a means by which His sons 
and daughters may progress and ad- 
vance through the eternities that are 
to come. I read further that it was 
declared : That there is to be a res- 
urrection of the just as distinct from 
the resurrection of the unjust. An- 
other doctrine which in the way now 
presented was at one time peculiar 
to the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints. But, because 
there is hope of repentance beyond 
the veil, procrastinate not the day of 
your repentance ; for, as the Prophet 
Alma has pointed out, you may find 
that the gift of repentance will be 
withheld from you there for a long, 
long time on account of your un- 
worthiness. For repentance is a gift 
from God, and when man forfeits 
it he loses the power to repent ; he 
can't turn away from his sins with a 
contrite heart and with a desire to 
forsake them, once and for ever. O, 
Latter-day Saints, ye men and wom- 
en of Israel, listen unto the voices 
of those who speak to you under the 
inspiration of the power of God, and 
heed them; for by hearing we are 
condemned, if we follow not in the 
path that is pointed out to us as the 
path of our duty. 

You have heard but little in the 
way of new doctrine in this confer- 
ence, perchance, — all the more rea- 
son you should be diligent in not 
forgetting again, as we have forgot- 
ten from time to time the things 
that are most needed. We make the 
excuse — that is one of our weak- 
nesses, to make excuses — we make 
the excuse that our memories are 
at fault. Our memories are all right ; 
altogether too good to suit some of 
us. We would like to forget things 



that we cannot. Memory is the 
library of the mind, in which we find 
stored away the valuable as well as 
the worthless things that have come 
to us. Recollection is the librarian, 
and he is very often sluggish and 
sleepy, often neglectful of his duty ; 
he doesn't know where to put his 
hand on the book or the document 
we need, just when we need it. We 
have had our recollections aroused 
in this conference, and I pray that 
we may ever remember the things 
that are most needed, the things of 
greatest worth; and that you and I 
and all of us may progress with the 
work of God, for it shall progress 
no matter what man shall do or how 
he may attempt to hinder its ad- 
vancement. May the blessings of 
Israel's God be with Israel, in the 
name of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER EEY L. PRATT. 

(President of Mexican Mission.) 

I trust, my brethren and sisters, 
that I may have the Spirit of the 
Lord to assist me to bear my testi- 
mony to this vast congregation. I 
have been truly edified and built up 
in that which I have heard. I have 
been edified and built up in my faith 
and strengthened by hearing the 
testimonies of my brethren who 
have spoken during the conference, 
and my heart has been touched ; it 
has been hard for me to keep back 
the tears, at times, as I have felt 
the sweet influence of the Spirit of 
the Lord that has prevailed through- 
out the conference. As Brother Tal- 
mage has just said, the very thought 
and the fact that we have not heard 
any new doctrine, but the fact that 
our attention has been called back 
to these simple principles and truths 
that our fathers and grandfathers 
stood for, and died for, has touched 



122 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



a tender chord in my life. I know 
that the work we are engaged in is 
true. I know that Joseph Smith is 
a prophet of God. I know that the 
work that was brought forth by his 
instrumentality is the power of God 
unto salvation. 

I have been engaged in the mis- 
sionary work, and I have carried 
this testimony to hundreds and 
thousands of people that have never 
heard it before, even a people that 
is dark and benighted, a people that 
we call the Lamanites ; and I wish 
to bear my testimony that the Gos- 
pel is doing a great work among 
the Lamanites, and many of them 
are interested in the redemption 
that is to be brought to them 
through the Gospel we are preach- 
ing. We are having success in the 
Mexican mission, in spite of the fact 
that there is war and trouble in that 
land. There has never been a time 
in the history of the Mexican mis- 
sion, so far as I have been able to 
know, and at least during the seven 
years I have labored there, that the 
people have been more susceptible 
to the teachings of the Gospel than 
thev have during this time of strife 
and bloodshed there. We have been 
able to baptize fifty-six souls this 
year, and they are just as honest 
and faithful as any other Latter-day 
Saints who live in accordance with 
the teachings of the Gospel. I have 
full faith in the promises of the 
Lord unto that people ; and I desire, 
mv brethren and sisters, to lift my 
voice in defense of all the principles 
of the Gospel. I am thankful for 
the privilege I have had of going 
out into the world, and I desire to 
continue to do my duty and to labor 
wherever the Lord calls me to labor, 
as long as I am able. It is a mis- 
taken idea that a great many of us 
have, my brethren and sisters, and 



I have come in contact with it at 
times at home, that there are places 
of preference in the Lord's work. 
I learned a little piece of poetry, 
w hen I first went into the mission 
field, that has been a great help to 
me, I never have even discovered 
who was its author, but it reads like 
this: 

"Just where you stand in the conflict, 
that is your place ; 

Just where you think that you are use- 
less, hide not your face ; 

God placed you there for a purpose, 
whate'er it be ; 

Think He has chosen you for it ; work 
loyally." 

If the Lord has chosen me to go 
to the Lamanites, that is my place. 
If He chooses me next year to go 
to Siberia, I want to go there with 
the same faith and determination to 
carry the Gospel message to those 
that do not know it in that place. I 
trust that this is the faith all of us 
have, and I believe it is, my brethren 
and sisters, and I pray that the 
blessings of the Lord may continue 
to be with us forever, which I do in 
the name of Jesus. Amen. 

PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 

I know that a great many would 
be pleased to know that Brother 
Pratt is a grandson of the late 
Brother Parley P. Pratt, one of the 
Twelve. 

ELDER SAMUEL 0. BENNION. 

(President of Central States Mission.) 

I rejoice very much, my brethren 
and sisters, in having had the privi- 
lege of attending this conference, 
and listening to the many instruc- 
tions that we have received ; and I 
earnestly hope that, for one, I shall 
be able to profit by them. I have 



ELDER MELVIN 1. BALLARD. 



123 



learned in the short, experience I 
have had in the mission field, to a 
small extent at least, what it means 
to have the Spirit of the Lord with 
a man to keep him in the path ot 
duty ; and I have had it impressed 
more firmly in my mind, during this 
conference, that the only safe way 
lies in the path of duty, and that 
there is not and cannot be any real 
reason for men, from today at any 
rate, who have been in this confer- 
ence, going wrong knowingly. 

The Lord has revealed the duty of 
the Latter-day Saints, through His 
servants the prophets ; as Amos 
said, "Surely the Lord God will do 
nothing save He reveal it through 
His servants the prophets." The 
Lord, as recorded in section one of 
the Doctrine and Covenants, has 
given us to understand that whether 
He speaks Himself or whether by 
His servants, it is the same. We 
have a prophet at the head to guide 
and instruct, the one whom the 
Lord speaks through for the good 
of His people, for the better direc- 
tion of His Church in the earth ; 
and the Lord has revealed unto us 
again what it 'means to be observers 
of the word of wisdom, how a man 
can obtain strength and power and 
salvation through an observance of 
it, and what it means not to ob- 
serve it. 

T thank the Lord, my brethren 
and sisters, for good and wise men 
who stand at the head of this 
Church. As a member of the 
Church, I am very thankful for the 
many long years of life of our pre- 
siding brethren ; for the years of 
experience of President Smith, and 
of President Lyman, men who have 
written history, together with their 
associates here, which the world 
must acknowledge to be great and 
glorious. I pray for their success ; 



I pray for the lives of these men, 
the leaders of this Church. I, for 
one, wish them to know that I love 
them, and I believe that I can voice 
the opinion of every man and wom- 
an in this congregation when I say 
that we love the leaders of this 
Church, the general authorities from 
President Smith down. It has taken 
a long time to make them great men 
of God, they are not made in a day, 
it takes a lifetime ; and I hope, for 
one, that I shall be able to profit 
by what I hear. 

That Israel may be strengthened, 
that the Church may grow stronger, 
that men and women may be more 
valiant in the performance of their 
duties, 1 humbly pray, in the name 
of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD. 

(President Northwestern States Mis- 
sion.) 

Above all earthly things I esteem 
my standing in the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints. My 
heart rejoices in the joy and confi- 
dence which come through the se- 
curity this feeling gives me, while 
the wars and strife are on in the 
world of religion, and new develop- 
ments are taking place in the world 
of science, constantly disturbing 
other denominations,' we are un- 
moved. We stand solidly and 
squarely where we began, or where 
the Lord planted our feet, and there 
is no necessity for the revision of 
creed, for changing the doctrines 
that have been given to this Church 
from the beginning, notwithstand- 
ing, when these glorious truths were 
given, many of them were new and 
ran counter to the opinions and 
theories of men, both in religion and 
science. The glorious doctrine we 
have heard so much about at this 



124 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



conference, known as the Word of 
Wisdom, there were no scientists 
advocating such truths when it was 
given. The Prophet did not give 
argument and reason in this revela- 
tion but announced, as all prophets 
do, the word of the Lord, to stand 
for itself without argument, to be 
finally demonstrated as a truth. 1 
say the fact that we do not have to 
change our opinion with respect to 
these matters is a joy to me. One 
of the greatest testimonies to me is 
the fact that while this Church, 
founded as it was in a day of doubt, 
darkness and of superstition, still 
it took solid ground ; clear cut, posi- 
tive statements were made with re- 
spect to religion, the morals of life, 
the doctrines of God and of His 
Christ, with respect even to some 
of the sciences, notwithstanding a 
positive stand and position was 
taken by the Prophet Joseph Smith, 
we have not had to renounce any 
of these things. They stand as 
strong and firm today as the truth, 
vindicated by our experiences and 
by the wisdom that the Lord has 
given to men of learning and of 
knowledge. 

I have had the privilege, during 
the last summer, of attending some 
conventions, and conferences of 
some of the leading denominations, 
and what a difference as compared 
with the experiences we have had 
during the last day or two ! Con- 
tention over the dogmas of religion 
occupied a very large part of the 
time. I thought with joy in my 
heart* of the great wisdom the Lord 
had displayed in organizing this 
Church, with its ministry called 
from the body of the people — not 
hirelings, nor men working for 
filthy lucre's sake. The elders of 
this Church, who bear the word oi 
God to the world, are called from 



the ranks, from the lowly walks of 
life, fired with the power of God 
and imbued with His Holy Priest- 
hood, even as living fires among the 
people, warning them, stirring the 
hearts of men, and bringing hun- 
dreds and thousands to repentance. 
The world has laughed at the 
method of our preaching and the 
kind of preachers we had, but I lis- 
tened recently to splendid argu- 
ments, in one of the great denomi- 
nations of our own land, denounc- 
ing the hired ministry and pleading 
for a change in the calling of men to 
the ministry, patterned and fash- 
ioned after the method the Lord has 
established in this Church. They 
want lay-men, men whose hearts are 
in the work and who are not filled 
with selfishness and covetousness, to 
enter the ministry. Behold how well 
the Lord established His ministry 
and the method of preaching the 
Gospel. When the world laughed 
at and criticized the efforts of this 
Church to establish the financial 
method the Lord revealed, in the 
payment of our tithes and offerings, 
for the building and establishment 
of His Church, it created a good 
deal of amusement among religion- 
ists ; but this summer almost one- 
half of the time of one of the great 
conferences was occupied in a. plea 
to establish the financial system this 
Church has received at the hand of 
God. They are now copying and 
imitating that which the Lord re- 
vealed to us many years ago. What 
a joy it is, I repeat, to be possessed 
of these truths and to stand as an 
organization that does not have to 
shift, while others are only now 
changing and moving toward the 
standards the Lord has fixed and 
established in this Church. 

Brother Talmage referred to the 
changing opinion of men with ref- 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD.

erence to the continuity of life after 
death. I thought while he was 
speaking, and have thought since 
this question has been discussed re- 
cently in one of the largest scientific 
gatherings in the world, by able 
scientists, that "Mormonism" gives 
to the world the greatest and best 
evidences there are that life exists 
after death, and that men and wom- 
en are the same individuals, pos- 
sessed of the same knowledge, the 
same intelligences after death that 
they had here, and are even added 
unto. Certain evidences have been 
given to the world from so-called 
spiritualists, who pretend to reveal 
the fact that life exists after death. 
Much deception evidently has been 
practiced, for some of these sup- 
posed mediums have given to the 
world communications from great 
men who have once lived upon the 
earth, Daniel Webster is supposed 
to have spoken, George Washing- 
ton, Shakespeare and others ; but 
the feeble efforts that come from 
those supposed sources are such 
doggerel as to be far beneath, in 
character, the wisdom and knowl- 
edge displayed by these men while 
in life. One able paper said, if these 
are true communications from those 
individuals, then heaven must blight 
the intellect and dwarf the mind of 
man, and they become weaklings. 
Deception has been practiced when- 
ever one represents that he is a cer- 
tain character who once lived on the 
earth, when the information given 
is beneath and inferior to that which 
the same character displayed while 
he was here upon the earth, you 
may know that it is a deception. 

This Church is founded upon the 
truth that men possess the same 
identity after this life. Behold the 
glorious revelations given to the 
Prophet Joseph Smith by the Lord 



Jesus Christ Himself, as contained 
in the book of Doctrine and Cove- 
nants. I assert that it reveals that 
Jesus is possessed of the same in- 
telligence, the same knowledge, the 
same powers and understanding that 
He had while He dwelt on the earth. 
To make this claim is not to depre- 
ciate in one particular from the 
glory, knowledge and intelligence of 
the Lord Jesus, for the revelations 
contained in that book are the equal 
of anything that Jesus ever gave to 
man while upon the earth, and more 
comprehensive in some respects. 
This word of wisdom, the revela- 
tion of the Lord Jesus ; is there any- 
thing in the scriptures or anywhere 
else in the world on that subject 
that is better, more to the point, 
than this? Think of the revelation 
known among us as the Vision. 
Where is there anything more splen- 
did than that wonderful conception 
the Lord Jesus gave to the mind of 
the Prophet Joseph with reference 
to life here and hereafter, and man's 
place in it? Some of our ablest 
men have said, in commenting upon 
certain passages of the Doctrine and 
Covenants, that there is nothing in 
the English language superior to it. 
It is not doggerel; it is sense, the 
best of sense ; and it displays, I as- 
sert again, the fact that the Lord 
Jesus, who gave these revelations 
is the same intelligent, all-wise Son 
of God that He was when He lived 
upon the earth, and that Joseph 
Smith told the truth when he said he 
received this knowledge from the 
Lord Jesus. It could not have come 
from any one with less knowledge 
and understanding than that source 
from which he claimed he re- 
ceived it. 

The world has marveled and won- 
dered at the gathering of Israel in 
latter days from the nations of the 



126 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



earth and planting their feet in this 
goodly land, and it has all been 
done so successfully while others 
have failed. Here in this desert 
waste, the marvelous thing has been 
accomplished. Where did we get 
the key by which this was done? 
The Prophet Joseph Smith declared 
that Moses appeared to him in the 
Kirtland Temple, the great leader 
of ancient Israel, who held also the 
keys of the gathering of modern 
Israel, and he delivered those keys 
and the knowledge that comes with 
them, into the hands of the Prophet 
Joseph Smith. I can believe that 
Moses has presided over many of 
the movements of Israel in modern 
days as a great instrument in the 
hands of God, a presiding genius 
looking after the welfare of the 
gatherings of Israel, directing many 
of these movements ; and does it 
detract from Moses to say that we 
give him credit for delivering the 
keys of the gathering of modern 
Israel to the Prophet Joseph? Noth- 
ing since the time Moses was upon 
the earth and since Israel was gath- 
ered in his day excels, or comes up 
to the wonderful work that has been 
accomplished in the gathering of 
modern Israel ; so that I assert again 
that Moses lives and is possessed of 
the same intelligence, knowledge 
and power he had while he dwelt 
among men upon the earth, and 
even excelled his former work as 
manifested in this great gathering 
in modern days, and we have not 
seen the end of that work. 

When the Prophet Joseph de- 
clared that Elijah delivered to him 
the keys of the salvation of the liv- 
ing and the dead he asserted a won- 
derful truth. Was Elijah possessed 
of the same knowledge and intel- 
ligence he had while he dwelt upon 
the earth? It has been asserted by 



some that the Prophet Joseph Smith 
obtained from masonry some or 
most all of the ceremonies had by 
us in our temples. Recently I have 
had an opportunity to investigate 
most thoroughly the history and 
connection of the membership of the 
Church with masonry, when certain 
lodges were organized in the city of 
Nauvoo and other places ; and I 
satisfied myself, and without giving 
you the detailed evidence, I assert 
to you that the evidence given by 
masons themselves proves conclu- 
sively that Joseph Smith never 
knew the first thing of masonry un- 
til years after he had received the 
visit of Elijah, and had delivered 
to men the keys of the holy priest- 
hood, and the ceremonies and ordi- 
nances had by us in these sacred 
temples, and had given the endow- 
ments to men long before he knew 
the first thing pertaining to the or- 
dinances and the ceremonies of ma- 
sonry. What is masonry ? Why, a 
fragment of the old truth coming 
down perhaps from Solomon's tem- 
ple of ancient days, and but a frag- 
ment, as Christianity is but a frag- 
ment of the Gospel of the Lord 
Jesus Christ. ' It was only to be had 
and enjoyed by those who hold the 
holy priesthood. The prophet Elijah 
revealed these truths ; he possessed 
them anciently and he gave them in 
their perfectness, and simplicity and 
purity to the Prophet Joseph Smith. 

I rejoice, my brethren and sisters, 
to know we are possessed of such 
splendid evidences of the truth of 
the statements of the Prophet, and 
to know that we have with us, as 
the brethren have expressed it, liv- 
ing inspiration that directs Israel. 
In my heart I say, Amen, to all of 
the counsels that have been given 
at this conference. I bear testimony 
to you that the brethren and sisters 



ELDER CHARLES A. CALLIS.

of this Church who will repent of 
their sins and accept the counsels 
of this conference, obey the word of 
wisdom, become moderate, become 
temperate in their dress and in their 
manner of life, they and their chil- 
dren shall win the plaudits of the 
world even in excess of that which 
their fathers and grandfathers have 
received. We may not build any 
more bridges ; we may not subdue 
desert wastes but there is some- 
thing for us to do, and we must 
round up our shoulders and do it, 
or the Lord Almighty will cast out 
those who do not do it. We have 
listened to these counsels a long, 
long time. Now, shall we respond? 
Shall we repent of these evils, mas- 
ter ourselves, and live in harmony 
with the counsels of this conference ? 
If we do, great shall be our reward, 
eternal our glory, and the world 
will look to us as a pattern, an en- 
sample in these things that are 
greater in their achievement than 
anything in the past. Our fathers 
and mothers believed and received 
the word of wisdom, on the state- 
ment of the prophet that it was 
God's counsel. In addition to that 
we have scientific evidences, prov- 
ing the correctness of this counsel, 
greater is our condemnation, for we 
have the word of the. Lord and the 
scientific evidences that His word 
is true. We can satisfy our reason, 
and judgment on these things as 
well as our faith, hence the greater 
condemnation for our disobedience. 

God help us to put these things 
into practise, and not merely talk 
about it, but go home and do it. 
Fathers and mothers should set that 
example in their families ; put aside 
the forbidden things. Let our ex- 
ample and precept be consistent be- 
fore our children and joy shall be 
ours in this life and the life to come ; 



which may the Lord grant ; in the 
name of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER CHARLES A. CALLIS. 

(President of Southern States Mission.) 

Members of the Church in the 
Southern States Mission mourn 
over the death of President Ben E. 
Rich. Never was there a more 
dauntless soldier of the cross than 
he was. For a long, long time the 
mission field will be lonely without 
President Ben E. Rich. 

As I listened to the splendid in- 
structions during this conference, 
the words of the Apostle Paul came 
forcefully to my mind. In summing 
up his powerful and splendid de- 
fense of the Christian religion be- 
fore King Agrippa, he said :" Hav- 
ing therefore obtained help of God, 
I continue to this day, witnessing 
to both small and great and saying 
none other things than those which 
the prophets and Moses did slay 
should come." 

My brethren and sisters, if we 
stand upon the revelations of Jesus 
Christ as contained in the standard \ 
works of the Church, we stand on 
solid ground ; on other grounds are 
sinking sands. Joseph Smith 
preached and taught nothing but 
what the prophets of God predicted 
he would preach and teach. Mar- 
tin Luther, in standing before that 
hostile council, said in defense of 
his position: "Here I stand, I can 
do no other; may God help me." 
Joseph Smith saw the Father and 
the Son. Like Paul he was not 
disobedient unto the heavenly vision, 
for he said that God knew that he 
had seen this vision, and if he denied 
it he would come under condemna- 
tion of the Lord ; but praise be to 
God he did not deny the testimony, 
and he did preach the things which 



128 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



the prophets of God had foretold 
he would preach, and he did do the 
things which they foretold he would 
do. Our sectarian friends are great 
lovers of the prophecies, but they 
hate like the mischief the manner 
in which they are fulfilled. Look at 
this mighty stream of truth proceed- 
ing from this Church ! When Co- 
lumbus and his associates saw a 
mighty river issuing from the main- 
land, one of his men said, "That 
river drains an island." Columbus 
said: "It is a mistake. Such a 
majestic river comes from a con- 
tinent." So this great stream of 
truth does not proceed from a man, 
nor from an isolated sect or church, 
but it proceeds from the only true 
and living Church of Jesus Christ 
on the face of the earth. And this 
river is going to grow and spread 
until, like a sea of glory, it spreads 
from pole to pole. 

In Chattanooga, this summer, we 
have witnessed two reunions that 
have stirred my soul to its depths. 
Last May, the Confederate veterans 
met in their annual reunion, and I 
"saw those men to the number ot 
twelve thousand marching down the 
street, under the shadow of Look- 
out Mountain, within a stone's 
throw of the bloody battle-field of 
Chickamauga. When I saw those 
old veterans, some with empty coat- 
sleeves, being carried in wagons, the 
thought came to my soul, how can 
it be denied that Joseph Smith was 
a prophet of God ? They were brave 
men, those confederate veterans, 
splendid characters, men who 
bravely fought for what they sin- 
cerely believed to be a principle ; 
and as they marched down the line, 
being saluted by the cheers of thous- 
ands of admirers, I said again and 
again in my heart, Surely Joseph 
Smith was a prophet of God. 



Only a few days ago, the veterans 
of the Union army met in an annual 
reunion in -Chattanooga ; and as I 
watched those brave, splendid men 
marching down the street, some 
with empty coat-sleeves, many bear- 
ing the scars of battle, I said again 
in my heart, that Joseph Smith was 
a prophet of God and that his pro- 
phecies have been literally fulfilled. 
Not that the prophet desired that 
the bloodshed and carnage should 
come, but God foreknew it would 
come, and He warned this nation, 
through his prophet of the great 
Civil war. His prophet proposed a 
remedy, a solution of the great ques- 
tion that caused the war, and which 
would have avoided the awful 
bloodshed and misery ; but the solu- 
tion was rejected. President Brig- 
ham Young said that where a 
prophet's words are fulfilled they 
are more solid proof of his divine 
mission as a prophet than all the 
miracles he can work. Another 
great man, not of this Church, said 
that prophecies are permanent mir- 
acles. Go look at the National Ceme- 
tery in Chattanooga, and the ceme- 
teries in other cities, that are so well 
taken care of by the federal gov- 
ernment, and look at those veterans, 
wounded and maimed and battle- 
scarred, marching past — all these 
bear eloquent and powerful testi- 
mony to the fact that Joseph was 
indeed a prophet of God. Talk 
about miracles ! Talk about the day 
of miracles being past, so long as 
this war is a memory, so long as 
those granite monuments pierce the 
clouds, so long as' those mighty 
monuments which people from the 
South and the North have erected 
to commemorate the valor of their 
sons, and brothers, and fathers ! So 
long as these monuments stand, so 
long will there be a standing and

permanent miracle to testify to the 
people that the days of prophets 
and apostles have not gone to re- 
turn no more forever. 

Look at the communities in this 
great state and in the surrounding 
states. Did not the prophet pre- 
dict that the people should be driven 
from Illnois and become a great and 
mighty people in this western land? 
Has it not been fulfilled? Behold 
a miracle, not only on this Temple 
block but throughout Zion; and 
these miracles are increasing. O, 
brethren and sisters, confronted by 
these miracles, do you think we 
shall stand or "halt between two 
opinions ?" A thousand times no ! 
But we will stand with our lead- 
ers, and with them we will fight the 
good fight. We will finish our 
course ; we will keep the faith ; we 
■will, with God's help, win the crown 
of eternal life which God, who can- 
not lie, promised before the world 
began. Amen. 

ELDER JOHN I. HE&RICK. 

(President of Western States Mission.) 

My soul was made to rejoice 
upon the opening session of this 
conference, when our beloved 
prophet and president enunciated 
to this people a theme for our con- 
sideration which I believe to be a 
vital thing for, not only us in the 
valleys of the mountains, but for 
the people at large in the United 
States to consider. Solomon said : 
"Wine is a mocker ; strong drink is 
raging ; whosoever deceiveth him- 
self thereby is not wise." At this 
late hour it would be presuming in- 
deed for me to particularize re- 
garding the Word of Wisdom, and 
the conditions that grow out of a 
failure to observe it, but will sim- 
ply direct attention to a few figures 



that came under my observation, 
recently, in contemplating the sub- 
ject. It seems apparent, from care- 
fully compiled statistics, that the 
United States is vieing with other 
countries of the world to see which 
can consume the most liquor, and 
when I say other countries I refer 
more especially to France, Eng- 
land and Germany. In the year 
1911, there was consumed in the 
United States 17.79 gallons of in- 
toxicants for each man, woman and 
child. In 1912 that startling quan- 
tity had been increased by nearly 
five gallons for each man, woman 
and child, at a cost, as we heard 
this forenoon, from Elder McKay, 
of nearly two billion dollars. Be- 
sides that, there was consumed just 
about two billion gallons of beer, 
enough, I presume, if it were 
turned into a channel, to float a 
battleship ; and then, too, there was 
more than two hundred and fifty 
million dollars worth of coffee 
used. When we come to tobacco 
we have probably a more stupen- 
duous showing in figures, and may- 
be in evil results, than anything 
else, because of its almost general 
use throughout the country. Dur- 
ing the calendar year 1911 there 
was used in the manufacture of 
tobacco, snuff, cigars, and cigar- 
ettes, sixteen and one-half billion 
pounds. I do not know what the 
average cost of the tobacco would 
be per pound, but I should say, 
since it was made into expensive 
cigarettes and cigars, that perhaps 
fifty cents a pound would be fair. 
So putting these figures together I 
take it that each man, woman and 
child in the United States con- 
sumed ten dollars worth of alco- 
holic liquors, coffee, tea, and to- 
bacco each month of that year. 
Imagine, if you will, what abso- 



ISO 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



lutely unbelievable figures that 
would make if that money were 
saved. Ten dollars for a hundred 
million people would mean a bil- 
lion dollars a month saved to this 
country, or twelve billions annually, 
if we desisted from using intoxi- 
cants and tobacco, tea and coffee. 
There would soon be no national 
debt, or scarcely any other debts, 
could that vast sum be used for 
more legitimate and necessary 
things. 

Emerson, I believe, said that "a 
man ought to be strong enough to 
overcome anything that can come 
to him. He is the strong man 
who can say No, and he is the wise 
man who through all his life can 
keep his mind, his soul, and his 
body clean." 

Speaking for one of the missions 
of this country, I cannot but refer 
to the occasion which brought five 
or six thousand people together in 
this building two weeks ago, yes- 
terday, to pay tribute to the mem- 
ory of our beloved friend and asso- 
ciate, President Ben E. Rich, a man 
whom I believe to have been one 
of the great missionaries of our 
Church. "And every one who hath 
forsaken houses, or brothers, or sis- 
ters, or fathers, or mothers, or 
children, or lands, for my name's 
sake shall receive an hundred fold 
and shall inherit everlasting life." 
So said the Savior of the world, as 
recorded by Matthew ; and I think 
if there is any man who is entitled 
to eternal life, and to an hundred 
fold of blessing, it will be such 
men as Ben E. Rich, who have 
given the best part of their lives to 
this work, and those who die mar- 
tyrs, as he did, to the cause of 
Christ. 

Let us, my brethren and sisters, 
heed the admonition of the prophet, 



seer and revelator to Israel. His 
warning voice made it known to us 
at the beginning of this confer- 
ence that we should observe the 
Word of Wisdom ; that we should 
heed the whisperings of the Spirit, 
that we should keep our bodies 
clean and our minds holy. May we 
be able to do so under the inspira- 
tion of heaven, I ask in the name 
of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER GERMAN E. ELLSWORTH. 

(President of Northern States Mission.) 

I am pleased, my brethren and 
sisters, to have the privilege of 
bearing my testimony to the Lat- 
ter-day Saints who have assembled 
in this conference. I bear witness 
to you that we have heard the 
word of the Lord to Israel. It is 
fncumbent upon us, whether we 
have only heard, or whether we 
will go home and put it into prac- 
tice; the one who is a hearer only 
bringeth condemnation upon him- 
self. I rejoice my brethren and 
sisters, in the testimony of all our 
brethren who have addressed us 
this conference time, not only with 
what has been said, but with the 
spirit in which it has been said, for 
it has come from the Lord. I am 
happy, indeed, to have this opportu- 
nity of fulfilling a covenant once 
made with the Lord to bear wit- 
ness of His name and of His Son, 
and of the Gospel that has been re- 
stored for the salvation of the chil- 
dren of men. 

I am pleased to have the privL 
lege of representing the Northern 
States mission. I have spent . a good 
deal of time with our missionaries 
after they have come home, and 
have told them that there is just as 
much joy and satisfaction and even 
a greater opportunity here to win 



ELDER GERMAN E. ELLSWORTH.

souls for Christ if they will only 
keep the missionary spirit. If they 
will but keep the love that they had 
in their hearts for their fellow- 
men, while out in the field, and 
use it to bless their friends and 
neighbors at home, they would 
bring more souls to a knowledge of 
the truth, and feel more joy and 
peace than they did while in the 
mission field. 

I rejoiced, my brethren and sis- 
ters, in hearing the word of the 
Lord concerning our deportment 
before our fellow men. I believe 
that if we would live as the mis- 
sionaries live, after they have been 
in the field a short time, that we 
would indeed be a light to the 
world, a light set upon a hill. It 
has been said that the Lord, in the 
last days, would cut a stone from 
the mountains, which would roll 
forth and fill the whole earth. The 
world has recognized jhis stone 
and called it a giant that should 
be crushed. It would indeed be a 
giant example of righteousness if 
we fully kept the word of the Lord 
concerning the Word of Wisdom. 
If all would refrain from the use of 
tea, coffee, liquor and tobacco, in 
the spirit of the word of the Lord, 
the love of God would reign in 
our hearts, and we could go forth, 
under the calling of the holy priest- 
hood, and bear witness of the 
truth in such power that the world 
would stop and listen. 

I remember, on one occasion, be- 
ing in the dining car upon a rail- 
road train, on a hot, dusty day, 
from Canada to Minneapolis. I 
think every man and woman on the 
dining' car, with the exception of 
mvself, had a bottle of beer, and, 
while I had never been addicted to 
it in my life, I confess that it looked 
very cooling, but I did not order it. 



(You don't know that, but I do, 
and therein lies the testimony I re- 
ceived.) Before I had finished my 
meal, the four people sitting oppo- 
site to me, were talking about their 
visit to the Temple block. They 
began to discuss what a supersti- 
tious people we are, and how there 
was something mysterious connect- 
ed with the acoustic properties in 
this building. When I had finished 
my meal, I handed them my card, 
and said: "My friends, no matter 
how far you travel, you never know 
in whose presence you may be talk- 
ing. I am a 'Mormon' elder, and 
what you have been saying about 
the superstition of my people is not 
true." After we retired from the 
dining car I had the privilege of 
talking to them about an hour, cor- 
recting their false impressions. The 
thing "that has come to my mind, 
time and time again, has been: 
Had I indulged in a bottle of beer, 
knowing the instructions and teach- 
ings that I have had from my youth, 
would I have had the courage to 
defend my religion? Would I 
have had the courage to tell them 
who I was, and what people I 
represented in the world? It has 
been a testimony to me, my breth- 
ren and sisters, that God is present 
in us, and we are the greatest wit- 
nesses of. our sincerity by our con- 
duct before our fellow-men and be- 
fore God our Father. 

Joseph Smith said that man 
might just as well put out his puny 
arm and try to stop the mighty 
Mississippi river in its onward 
course to the sea, as to try to stop 
this work. That is true, my breth- 
ren and sisters; but it would pro- 
gress much faster if the third gen- 
eration, who have been born with- 
out a desire for tea, coffee, tobacco 
or liquor, would not cultivate the 



132 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



taste for those deleterious articles. 
If we would rise in the strength and 
purity of our birthright we could 
more effectively aid this work, and 
it would roll on more rapidly, and 
the light thereof would become 
brighter than it has ever been be- 
fore. The world will yet rise up 
and bless our names, and the names 
of our parents and grand-parents 
who, under the sound of the voice 
of the prophet of God, repented of 
their sins, lived a godly life, and 
gave us such a royal birth. 

In the face of the light that we 
have received, the instructions that 
have been given to us, and of the 
pleadings and warnings of the ser- 
vants of God for us to live right- 
eously, what condemnation will 
come upon us should we cultivate 
an appetite for tea, coffee, liquor 
and tobacco. Some of our fathers 
and mothers, and particularly our 
grandfathers and grandmothers, 
had these habits when the Gospel 
found them ; but hundreds of them 
forsook these things and lived a 
godly life, and by so doing have 
transmitted to us very little desire 
for the things the Lord said were 
not good for man. Light has come 
in to the world and condemnation 
will come upon those who reject the 
light. The word of wisdom is a 
revelation, and command to the 
third generation. If they heed it 
not and turn aside from the instruc- 
tions and pleadings of the presiding 
officers of" this Church they will lose 
their place and station, and the 
honest young men and women of 
the world, who hear the voice of 
God, through His servants, will 
come in and take their places. 

God bless Zion. God bless the 
rising generation, that we may 
build upon the foundations that 
have been so nobly laid by our par- 



ents, and that we may follow the 
instructions of .our God-inspired 
leaders, is my prayer, in the name 
of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER WALTER P. MONSON. 

(President of Eastern States Mission.) 

I can say, with my brethren who 
have preceded me, that I have re- 
joiced extremely in the spirit of this 
splendid conference, and the appro- 
priateness of the singing, which has 
been soul-inspiring hymns, with mu- 
sic by our own composers, in nearly 
every instance. I feel that it is good 
to be here. I have received spirit- 
ual food in listening to the remarks 
and testimonies that have been 
borne in our hearing this after- 
noon, as well as in the other sessions 
of this conference. 

The Latter-day Saints have not 
turned their eyes unto a setting sun 
of spiritual glory; they are calling 
upon the world to look upon the 
dawn of a new era, and spiritual 
light has again been shed forth upon 
the souls of men. They are calling 
upon all mankind to rejoice in' the 
advent of the dispensation of the 
fullness of times, when God will 
bring together all- the dispensations 
that have ever been upon the earth, 
with all of their attendant blessings, 
all will be included in this last dis- 
pensation. We have heard, from 
the brethren, of the restoration of 
the keys of the gathering of Israel, 
keys delivered by Elijah, the proh- 
et. All the keys and blessings that 
were enjoyed by the prophets and 
people of ancient days have come to 
us, and we are made partakers of 
those blessings. 

The Latter-day Saints do not 
have to look back into the days of 
Adam and of Abraham to find ex- 
amples of sacrifice. While we were 



ELDER WALTER P. MONSON. 



133 



listening to the remarks of Elder 
Roberts, the beautiful tribute paid 
by him, suggested by monuments, 
that commemorate the sacrifice and 
achievements of God's people, I 
thought we must not forget that in 
this great American desert, the 
wilds of the western land and moun- 
tains, God has raised up a people 
whose sturdiness is not equalled in 
the world; and they have excelled 
notwithstanding their impoverished 
condition. They have produced lit- 
erally, from elements that were 
rough and unhewn, an empire that 
stands for the glory of God in these 
the latter days. 

. . My brethren and sisters, I bear 
my testimony to you, before taking 
up my labors in the Eastern States 
Mission, that I know that God lives ; 
that I know that Jesus is the Christ, 
and that the doctrines you have 
heard expounded in this conference 
are doctrines that receive the divine 
approval of Jesus Christ our Lord, 
and God our Heavenly Father. I 
also bear testimony to the divine 
mission of Joseph Smith, the proph- 
et, who was instrumental in these 
the last days in restoring anew the 
Gospel light, which seems to stir 
the whole spiritual world from cen- 
ter to circumference. My heart is 
filled with gratitude and praise, and 
has been thrilled by the testimonies 
which have been borne. The Spirit 
of the Lord has caused me to see the 
glorious truths that have been por- 
trayed. I uphold and sustain the 
prophet, seer, and revelator, who 
spoke to us in the opening session 
of this conference. He manifested 
the power of inspiration and the in- 
fluence of the Spirit of the Lord ; 
for the topics touched upon are the 
most timelv that the Latter-day 
Saints could have presented before 
them. While I was in England, 



about three years ago, I had charge 
of what was known as Earl's Court 
Booth. I simply mention a little 
incident that occurred there to show 
how thinking people of the world 
are turning attention toward the 
Latter-day Saints, and occasionally 
show that they approve of their lives 
and actions in some respects. While 
I was handing out our literature and 
selling our books, at Earl's Court 
Booth, I met a learned man from 
the Oxford University, whom I was 
informed had set apart more church 
of England ministers than any other 
man who had held the same position 
in the history of the Oxford Uni- 
versity. I had the oportunity ot 
passing to him a six-penny booklet, 
that was written by Doctor James E. 
Talmage, "The Story of Mormon- 
ism." On the front was a triangular 
heading, with "The Story of Mor- 
monism" inscribed within the tri- 
angle. He came back, in two or 
three weeks, and I recognized him 
when he came to the booth, and 1 
asked him if he had read the little 
book that he bought when he was 
there before. He said, "Yes, I 
have ; but why do you call this work 
'Mormonism ?' " I replied "we are 
called 'Mormons' for the same 
reason that John is sometimes called 
Jack. People gave us a nick-name, 
and the more we protest the more 
they love to call us that name ; but 
we have no objections, inasmuch as 
'Mormonism' stands for 'more- 
good.' everything that is pure and 
holy in the lives, -of men." He said : 
"You did not catch my idea. ' If you 
would remove that name, 'Mormon- 
ism,' the whole world would be more 
ready to accept those glorious 
truths." He asked me if T was ac- 
quainted with Doctor Talmage, the 
writer. I told him that I was not 
intimately acquainted, but that 1 



134 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



knew him. He said : "When you 
go home I want you to bear to Doc- 
tor Talmage one suggestion with 
respect to his work." I told him 
that I would, and I have delivered 
it. He said ; "Instead of having 
this triangular affair on the front 
cover, and standing within the tri- 
angle, 'The Story of Mormonism, 
by James E. Talmage,' there should 
be a star or a crescent, more the 
shape of a horse-shoe, placed on 
the front cover, in two lines, and be- 
tween these two lines it should read, 
'These are they that have come up 
through great tribulation.' " I 
thought that, of all the beautiful 
delicate compliments that ever have 
been paid to the Latter-day Saint 
people, this by Rev. J. Barker Smith 
of the Oxford University was one 
of the finest. 

My brethren and sisters, I bear 
you my humble testimony that I 
know the work we are engaged in is 
the plan that has been established 
by our Heavenly Father for the 
redemption of human souls. May 
God bless us and help us to appreci- 
ate these blessings ; that we may 
live not by bread alone, .but by 
every word that proceedeth out of 
the mouth of God ; which is my 
prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 

A tenor solo, "O Lord rebuke 
me not in Thine anger," was sung 
by David E. Smith. 

BISHOP CHARLES W. NIBLEY. 

We have had a splendid confer- 
ence from start to finish, and now 
we are about at the close. It is not 
my intention to make any extended 
remarks, for there is not time. 
There is one matter, however, thai 
it is desired I should call to your at- 
tention. 



You are all acquainted with the 
unfortunate condition of our people 
who hav.e been expelled from Mex- 
ico, and who have had to leave their 
property and all they possess, ana 
flee for their lives. Quite a num- 
ber of them are still located near the 
borders of Mexico, at El Paso and 
other places, but there is a large 
number scattered in the settlements, 
wards and stakes of Utah, Idaho, 
Arizona and the outside stakes. 
Brethren and sisters, wherever you 
can help our afflicted brothers and 
sisters who are in need — and they 
are all in need of assistance — -to 
get work or secure employment, do 
all that you can in this direction, 
and where they are in actual need of 
sustenance, of food or clothing, it 
is our duty to help supply it. I know 
that in the abundance that you have, 
you will not withhold from these 
brethren and sisters, who are in this 
condition of want. 

We all hope that the time will 
soon come when conditions will be 
more settled in that land, and all 
who wish to return to their pos- 
sessions, or that which is left of 
them, can do so, but that time seems 
to be a considerable distance ahead, 
and no man can tell just when it will 
be. In the meantime, let us do our 
duty towards them. 

Let me add another word, also. 
The Lord is showering His bless- 
ings upon the Latter-day Saints in 
rich abundance. The earth is won- 
derfully productive this season, in 
all of our settlements, and all the 
products of the field, farm and range 
are bringing fairly good prices. In 
the midst of all these blessings none 
of us should forget the obligations 
that we are under to sustain the 
Church of God with the means, or 
part of it. that He puts into our pos- 
session. 



PRESIDENT CHARLES W. PENROSE. 



135 



I believe that this is the best peo- 
ple in all the world — I know they 
are, and yet we are surely not any 
better than we should be, or than 
we could be. There is room for 
improvement in the direction of 
paying our tithes and offerings, and 
sustaining the Church. The mission 
work abroad is now taking a great 
deal of the means of the Church. 
The improvements that you heard 
about during this conference, take 
considerable . money. The opera- 
tion of our temples, the building 
of meeting houses, and the general 
necessities of the Church, all re- 
quire means. I believe that our at- 
tendance at this conference will re- 
mind us of this obligation to the 
Lord and His Church, that we will 
come forth with our tithes and of- 
ferings and help to build up the 
great work of God which is being 
established in the earth, and which 
is doing so much, and will do still 
more, if we only do all that we 
should to promote its interests. 
Amen. 



PBEST. CHAKLES W. PENROSE. 

I am requested to present a mat- 
ter before you, very briefly, which is 
in your interest and particularly in 
the interest of the newspaper which 
is recognized as the organ of the 
Church, the Deseret News. I am 
not now intimately associated with 
the paper, but I take interest in its 
welfare and progress, and wish to 
recommend to the Latter-day Saints 
that they subscribe and pay for the 
Deseret A r ezvs ; those who can re- 
ceive it, should take the daily, and 
those who are in distant points, not 
connected with the railroads, take 
the semi-weekly. It is a good, re- 
liable, able newspaper, as well as 



being the organ of the Church. 
There are many obstacles in its way. 
A newspaper is not generally sup- 
ported financially by its subscrip- 
tion lists, but by its advertisements. 
There are classes of advertisements 
which cannot be admitted into the 
columns of the Deseret News, so 
that the paper is handicapped in that 
matter in a way that is not felt by 
other newspapers in this city. The 
Nezus does not admit advertisements 
that relate to the sale of liquor and 
tobacco and other things talked 
about in this conference which are 
forbidden to the real Latter-day 
Saints. There are many other ad- 
vertisements such as quack medi- 
cines, et cetera, which are not ad- 
mitted into the columns of the Des- 
eret News. And then there is the 
opposition of all supporters of the 
"underworld" and the lower ele- 
ments in this city and other cities 
of the State, because the Deseret 
News stands all the time in support 
of the Word of Wisdom and of all 
the counsels and instructions of a 
moral and practical kind given by 
the leaders of the Church. 

Now, I will not enlarge upon the 
matter, because the time is almost 
up for closing our last session of 
this conference, but I recommend 
to my brethren, the presidents of 
stakes and their counselors, and the 
bishops and their counselors, that 
they endeavor to do what they can 
to circulate that paper and to help in 
its support by every legitimate 
means ; and they will find that 
wherever that paper finds its way 
in the various parts of Zion a good 
influence is used and the work of 
the Lord is accelerated. The Lord 
has blessed that paper from the be- 
ginning ; may it continue to prosper 
and receive the support of His peo- 
ple. Amen.

CLOSING REMARKS. 

Gratitude expressed to all who assisted 
in Conference proceedings — Blessing 
invoked upon all engaged in the min- 
istry! and all seekers after truth. 



Just a moment or two more of pa- 
tience. I desire to express my grat- 
itude to my brethren and sisters 
who are present for the attention 
they have given to this conference, 
and to the meetings of this day. I 
want to thank my brethren who 
have spoken from the beginning to 
the end, for the most excellent spirit 
they have manifested, and for the 
most excellent words they have 
spoken. I desire to thank our choir 
for their presence here on the Sab- 
bath, and for the other members of 
the choir that have been able to at- 
tend during Saturday and today; 
and also to our beloved brother and 
fellow-worker, one worthy of honor 
and credit for his service to the 
Church, Brother Evan Stephens, for 
his music, for the poetry of his soul, 
and for those songs that have been 
written by him, which we often 
hear sung and which we sing our- 
selves with great satisfaction ; and 
to our beloved brother, John J. Mc- 
Clellan. and his assistants at the 
great organ; and all others of our 
brothers and sisters who have taken 
part in the exercises of our confer- 
ence. 

I think we have had one of the 
best conferences that we have held 
within my own recollection, and I 
can go back in my recollection to 
the early days, the days of Nauvoo 
at least. And the Lord bless you, 
my brethren of the holy priesthood, 
the presidents of stakes and their 
counselors, and high councils, the 
bishops and their counselors, and 
all taking part in the labor of the 
ministry whether in the regular 
quorums and councils of the priest- 
hood or in the auxiliary organiza- 
tions, we feel to express our grati- 
tude for your presence and your 
heartfelt interest in the work of the 
Lord. We beseech you to continue 



PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH.

to be faithful and more faithful 
than ever before. Let us all try to 
be a little better than we have been 
in the past, and let us try to treasure 
up the most excellent instructions 
that have been given to us during 
our conference. 

I know that the Lord is pleased 
with the proceedings of our confer- 
ence, and that His blessing has been 
with us, and His spirit has been 
made powerfully manifest in all 
that has been said and clone. The 
Lord bless the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints, and all 
honest, earnest seekers after the 
truth, everywhere, throughout the 
world. May the Lord bless those 
who, though ignorant of the revela- 
tions that the Lord has given to the 
world in these latter days, are still 
seeking to serve Him according to 
the light they possess, and the 
knowledge that they have. May 
God's blessing rest upon them, that 
they or their children after them 
may come to the knowledge of the 
truth at last and be exalted in the 
kingdom of God through the ordi- 
nances of the Gospel and obedience 
to all the requirements thereof. 

Sixty-six of our brethren have 
taken part vocally during our con- 



ference. I expect we will have 
quite as many take part during the 
next conference, who did not have 
the privilege of being heard at this 
conference. We have a list of you 
all and we expect to give all a 
chance as far as we can, and we 
would like you to come prepared. 

Announcement was made that the 
daily organ recitals would be dis- 
continued until further notice- 

The choir and congregation sang, 
"The Doxology." 

Benediction was pronounced by 
Elder Rudger Clawson. 

Conference adjourned for six 
months. 

Prof. Evan Stephens conducted 
the singing of the choir and congre- 
gation at the Conference meetings 
in the Tabernacle, and Prof. John 
J. McClellan played the accompani- 
ments, interludes, etc., on the great 
organ, assisted by Edward P. Kim- 
ball and Tracy Y. Cannon. 

The stenographic reports of the 
discourses were taken by Elders 
Franklin W. Otterstrom, Frederick 
E. Barker, Gladys Barker, and Clar- 
ence Cramer. 

Duncan M. McAllister, 

Clerk of Conference.

ranged according to subject in alphabetical order.

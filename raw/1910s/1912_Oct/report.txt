Eighty-Third Semi-Annual Conference 

of the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints 

FIRST DAY. 



The Eighty-third Semi-annual 
Conference of the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints con- 
vened in the Tabernacle, Salt Lake 
City, at 10 a. m., Friday, October 4, 
1912, President Joseph F. Smith 
presiding. 

AUTHORITIES PRESENT. 

There were present of the First 
Presidency, Joseph F. Smith, An- 
thon H. Lund, and Charles W. Pen- 
rose ; of the Council of the Twelve 
Apostles, Francis M Lyman, Heber 
J. Grant, Reed Smoot, Hyrum M. 
Smith, George Albert Smith, Orson 
F. Whitney, David O. McKay, An- 
thony W. Ivins, Joseph F. Smith, 
Jr., and James E. Talmage ; of the 
First Council of Seventy, Seymour 
B. Young, J. Golden Kimball, Rulon 
S. Wells, Joseph W. McMurrin and 
Charles H. Hart; (Brigham H. 
Roberts and Levi Edgar Young 
were in attendance at later ses- 
sions) ; of the presiding Bishopric, 
Charles W. Nibley, Orrin P. Miller, 
and David A. Smith. There were 
also a large number of Presidents 
of Stakes with their Counselors, 
Presidents of missions, Bishops of 
Wards, Patriarchs, and numerous 
other prominent men and women 



representing various quorums and 
organizations of the Church. 

President Joseph F. Smith called 
the assembly to order, and the con- 
ference services were commenced 
by the congregation singing the 
hymn : 

Come, come, ye saints, no toil nor la- 
bor fear, 
But with joy wend your way; 
Though hard to you this journey may 
appear, 
Grace shall be as your day. 
'Tis better far for us to strive, 
Our useless cares from us to drive, 
Do this and joy your hearts will 

swell — 
All is well! all is well! 

The opening prayer was offered 
by Elder Charles A. Callis. 

The congregation sang the hymn : 

Redeemer of Israel, our only delight, 
On whom for a blessing we call, 

Our shadow by day, and our pillar 
by night, 
Our King, our Deliv'rer, our all! 

PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 

OPENING ADDRESS. 

Constant nee'd for God's help. — Many

adversity. — Glorious mission of peace 
indicated for United States. — The Ten 
Commandments, and the Gospel, eter- 
nal. — Duty of Saints to sustain United 
States Constitution. 

I feel very dependent this morn- 
ing upon the presence of the Good 
Spirit. I do not feel either physic- 
ally or mentally able to perform the 
duties which are required of me 
without the assistance of the Spirit 
of the Lord. I do not know that 
any man is able to carry on the work 
of the Lord which may be required 
at his hand, independently of the 
Lord, or without the promptings 
and inspiration of the Spirit which 
comes from the Father of Light, 
with whom there is no variableness 
nor shadow of turning. I think it 
is the duty of all men, especially 
those connected with the Church of 
Jesus Christ, to live humbly before 
God, and to be prayerful and sub- 
missive to the law of the Lord. If 
we succeed in standing faithful be- 
fore Him, however strong we may 
feel within ourselves, or capable to 
bear the burdens and responsibilities 
that may rest upon us, the time will 
come, however much we may have 
been disinclined to acknowledge it 
before, when we will be compelled 
to acknowledge the hand of God in 
our success. We will not be able 
to accomplish it alone. 

I feel very grateful this morning 
for the privilege that I enjoy of be- 
ing present at this opening session 
of the eighty-third semi-annual con- 
ference of the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints, which 
comparatively only a few years ago 
was organized under the laws of the 
state of New York by six individ- 
uals, and but very few besides them 
had become acquainted with the 
new revelation and embraced it. 
And from that small beginning we 



look today out upon this manifesta- 
tion of the mercy and blessing of 
the Lord, and the work that was 
begun by those six fiist members of 
the Church, under the inspiration 
given to that boy whom the world 
holds in derision and in unbelief, to 
a very large extent, but whose mis- 
sion and the results of whose labors 
are becoming more widely and bet- 
ter known, and more clearly under- 
stood by the intelligent men and 
women of the world to whom this 
message has been sent. 

I am often impressed, while at- 
tempting to speak to the Latter-day 
Saints, with the impotency of man 
and his utter dependence upon the 
Lord in the accomplishment of that 
which has been done in the interest 
of the restored Gospel of Jesus 
Christ in the latter day. I look out 
over the world today and I compre- 
hend that there are tens and hun- 
dreds of thousands of the best men 
and women in the world, the most 
intelligent, thoughtful, independent 
of character, from almost all lands, 
who have come to a knowledge of 
the divinity of the mission of Joseph 
Smith, and acknowledged it, and 
man)' in their hearts, while openly 
they dare not come out against the 
prejudices of the world to acknowl- 
edge their conviction. And hun- 
dreds of thousands of men and 
women who are sufficiently inde- 
pendent in their character, and who 
are sufficiently intelligent as to give 
a reason for the hope that is within 
them, have come forth and have 
identified themselves, with all that 
they possess in the world, with the 
great latter-day work, the founda- 
tions of which were laid by God 
Almighty through the instrumen- 
tality of Joseph Smith, the Prophet. 
And today our country is beginning 
to see or to obtain a slight glimmer 



PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH.

of the true character of the work 
that Joseph Smith was instrumental 
in establishing upon the earth, and 
many of the great and good and in- 
telligent people of the world are be- 
ginning to acknowledge that there 
is some good that can "come out of 
Nazareth," so. to speak. 

I feel thankful for the prosperity 
that has attended the labors of the 
people of these intermountain val- 
leys during the present season, that 
the Lord has given us an abundant 
harvest, the season has been a fruit- 
ful one — so fruitful indeed that 
there is considerable waste of the 
rich products of the vines and of 
the trees, there being so much that 
many people seem to be unable to 
take care of the fruits of their 
orchards and their fields. I hope 
sincerely in the midst of this pros- 
perity, the people of the Church will 
not forget the Lord in the first 
fruits of all their increase that their 
barns may continue to be filled with 
plenty and, figuratively speaking, 
that their "presses may burst out 
with new wine." I hope that we 
will not forget the Lord in the day 
of prosperity, that we will not be 
unmindful of the gifts and blessings 
bestowed by the hand of the liberal 
and bounteous giver of every good 
and perfect gift, for while the earth 
is fruitful, while the elements are 
healthful and propitious and all 
things are favorable and contribute 
to our prosperity and happiness, 
we should always be mindful 
of the fact that it is in conse- 
quence of the overruling, mer- 
ciful providence of the Father of 
us all. It is essential that Latter- 
day Saints should.be willing to ac- 
knowledge cheerfully the hand of 
the Lord in all things. I realize 
that there are many things in which 
it is difficult for us to see or discern 



the hand of the Lord — when we are 
afflicted, when we are troubled, 
when we may be molested and dis- 
turbed in our pursuits, we may feel 
sometimes, — many of us do, — I pre- 
sume, that it is extremely hard to 
discern and to acknowledge the 
hand of the Lord in it. 

We have had some very sad ex- 
periences of late, — a large number 
of our colonists in Mexico have 
had serious cause for the exercise 
of faith, patience, forbearance, hope 
and charity this year; and many of 
them, I have no doubt, have found 
it difficult under circumstances 
which prevail around them to see 
how the hand of the Lord could 
ever be made manifest for their 
good. They have been robbed, plun- 
dered and driven from their homes, 
their rights have been denied them, 
their property taken away from 
them, the safety of their wives and 
daughters jeopardized and their 
lives threatened, and at last they 
found it necessary to abandon their 
homes and possessions, and come 
away from that land of riot and 
murder, brigandage and robbery in 
order that they might escape at least 
with their lives ; and quite a few 
have not been fortunate enough to 
get away with their lives, but have 
fallen by the hands of marauders 
and assassins. 

The Latter-day Saints who col- 
onized in Chihuahua went to Mex- 
ico not by chance. I have said it 
many times before, and I repeat it 
again. They went there with the 
consent and approval of the presid- 
ing authorities of the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 
under conditions that made it 
proper, advantageous and beneficial 
to them to go there. They have suf- 
fered a great deal at the hands of 
degraded, unprincipled men. Many

of the race unquestionably have 
good hearts and will manifest their 
goodness when under the influence 
of good men and of favorable sur- 
roundings, but too often only when 
it may appear to them to be to their 
interest to do so, but they are by 
no means an elevated race of peo- 
ple; and I think we have sufficient 
evidence to prove the fact that the 
Almighty, who is the Father of all 
men and who overrules the destinies 
of all the nations of tne earth, has 
for some time been ready to permit 
a scourge and perhaps devastation 
and ruin to come upon that people 
until the remnant of them shall be 
taught a lesson that may help to ele- 
vate them a little in the scale of 
human and national intelligence. 

Many of us, perhaps, have not 
worried much about the condition 
of our people in Mexico, but it has 
been a constant source of anxiety to 
me and to my brethren of the Presi- 
dency and the Twelve. We have 
felt deeply the troubles that have 
come upon our people there, and we 
have regretted exceedingly the ne- 
cessity they have seen to move away 
from their homes (many of which 
are equal to some of the best homes 
that we possess in this land) and 
from their lands, their fields, their 
orchards, their flocks and herds, to 
escape the indignities that were 
heaped upon them by brigands, ren- 
egades, marauders and plunderers. 
Some of our people and many 
others have stood ready to condemn 
the authorities of our nation for not 
interfering with the treatment they 
have received and that other Amer- 
ican citizens have received at the 
hands of the Mexican people. But 
I feel thankful a higher wisdom has 
dictated the course of the executive 
authorities of our nation, by which 
they have kept their hands clean 



from the shedding of blood, and our 
sons, our brothers and perhaps our 
fathers from being drawn into a 
protracted war with Mexico, which 
might last for years, and cost un- 
told blood and treasure, even if the 
whole power of the United States 
should be brought to bear to quell 
the disturbances there and to bring 
peace to the land. It is a moun- 
tainous country, and much of it a 
desert land, brigands and marauders 
might infest those mountains for 
years, in spite of all that armies 
could do to ferret them out, and 
while that condition should exist, 
neither life nor property of decent 
people would be safe in the land. I 
am glad that the authorities of our 
government have seen it wise to let 
them slay themselves, if they are de- 
termined to slay and destroy. I 
think it is fortunate that our people 
have escaped from the land with 
their families and we wish it to be 
understood that their mission there 
is, at least for the time being, at an 
end, and that they may feel them- 
selves at liberty, not only to abandon 
the country if they choose to do so, 
but to go elsewhere, where condi- 
tions will favor their endeavors to 
make new homes and establish 
themselves in a civilized land, where 
life is protected and where the pos- 
session of property is safe, and 
where they can dwell in peace and 
be happy. 

I cannot refrain from expressing 
my sincere gratitude to our national , 
authorities for the generous kind- 
ness they have shown to American 
citizens who have suffered so much 
on account of the deplorable condi- 
tions existing in Northern Mexico; 
by appropriating large sums of 
money for their relief. Every good 
citizen will hail with pleasure this 
act of kindness on the part of our 



PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH.

government. And none more so 
than the citizens of Utah and ad- 
joining states, where so many of the 
kindred and fellow citizens of the 
Mexican exiles reside. 

It is of course necessary for our 
people who have been driven away 
from there to secure every right 
that they possibly can for the re- 
covery of their properties which 
they may have been or may be de- 
prived of. Whether the time will 
come in the near or distant future 
that our people may go back to the 
land that they have bought and paid 
for, to the homes that they have 
built and beautified, to the fields 
that they have subdued and culti- 
vated, and to their orchards and 
rightful possessions,- — whether the 
time will come or not within the 
near future or even the distant fu- 
ture, I am not prepared to say. But 
I would guess that the time will 
come when that land will be over- 
spread by more intelligent people 
than inhabit it now, and when there 
will be a stable government estab- 
lished there, which will be able to 
guarantee the protection of the 
rights of the citizens of the land. I 
believe that time will come whether 
it may be attained by friendly inter- 
vention or otherwise. I believe that 
the government of the United States 
will eventually, if need be, take a 
hand in bringing to pass peace and 
reconciliation and good government 
in that land, not by means of war 
and bloodshed, but by more con- 
ciliatory measures, that of being a 
peacemaker and powerful advisor 
for good to that poor, degraded peo- 
ple. I do not anticipate peace to be 
restored there for years to come un- 
less peace can be brought to pass 
by the intervention of some friendly 
hand and greater wisdom than the 
people themselves possess. 



Now in relation to these matters 
I want to say that our hearts have 
been touched, our sympathies have 
been drawn out towards our people 
of Mexico. We have prayed for 
them, we have thought of them day 
and night, and now we feel to say 
to them that they are at liberty to 
make homes wherever they can find 
suitable locations among their own 
people and in their own nation, 
where they have or will have at 
least an assurance of protection and 
of civil liberty. Yet we would like 
them not to lose or to neglect any 
chance or opportunity to avail them- 
selves of all the rights that belong 
to them, to be realized hereafter 
when the time of proper adjustment 
and righteous judgment shall come 
to them. I could not advise our 
people to go back to Mexico under 
existing circumstances. Indeed, I 
would advise them not to go back, 
if I should give advice at all to 
them, but we wish our brethren to 
feel at liberty to do just what they 
feel in their hearts will be for their 
best good. It is the privilege of 
every individual in this Church to 
enjoy the spirit of revelation from 
God Almighty sufficient to guide 
him in the performance of his duty, 
and in the doing of that which will 
be overruled for his best good, and 
we hope that our brethren will con- 
tinue to live in possession of this 
spirit, by which they may be di- 
rected in the right path to do the 
right thing for themselves, then 
families and their interest, and no» 
be drawn into doing anything that 
would result in their injury, or the 
injury of their cause. 

Recurring again to the condition 
of our people of whom I have been 
speaking, it is hard for them to see 
why Providence will permit or has 
permitted conditions to arise that 



6 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



have placed them in the position 
that they are in. On somewhat 
parallel lines our people might go 
back in memory to Ohio and to 
Missouri and to Illinois, and recall 
incidents and conditions that existed 
in those early days by which our 
people were harassed, mobbed, per- 
secuted, hated and driven away 
from their possessions both in Ohio, 
Missouri and in Illinois. It was 
hard for our people in those times, 
and under the conditions that then 
existed, to see where God in His 
providence designed good for His 
people in permitting these condi- 
tions to exist. But who today will 
dispute the fact that, although we 
were compelled to leave Ohio, Mis- 
souri and Illinois against our will, 
our wishes, our interests temporally, 
as was supposed, — it was for our 
ultimate good? Which of us will 
now contend that the overruling 
providence which brought us to this 
place was a mistake ? None of us ! 
When we look back to it we see 
clearly, beyond any possible doubt, 
that the hand of God was in it. And 
while it was necessary for us to be 
moved from our footholds on the 
soil that our fathers had obtained 
from the government of the United 
States, and from old settlers, and 
while we were compelled to do it 
against our supposed interests — we 
now see it has resulted in the great- 
est blessing possible to us and the 
Church. 

What would we have done in 
Ohio? What room was there for 
growth and development for the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints in Caldwell County or 
in Jackson County or in Clay Coun- 
ty, Missouri? Where was the 
chance for this Church to spread 
abroad, grow and obtain a foothold 
in the earth, as we posess it today, 



in the state of Illinois ? A populous 
state, her lands occupied by older 
inhabitants who were uncongenial 
and unfriendly. They had no faith 
in our good intentions, nor in the 
divinity of our cause. They feared 
us because the Saints were progres- 
sive. The spirit of growth, devel- 
opment and of advancement charac- 
terized the life and labors and ex- 
istence of communities of Latter- 
day Saints, as it has with our peo- 
ple in Mexico. 

In Mexico within a few miles, 
at the most, of some of the most 
progressive and beautiful settle- 
ments and towns that can be found 
in our land, which have grown up 
in a few years by the industry and 
perseverance of the Latter-day 
Saints, are old Spanish towns that 
have existed for hundreds of years 
that would be unfit for civilized peo- 
ple to dwell in. And these con- 
trasts have been brought to the at- 
tention of those degraded people ; it 
has been pointed out to them : "See 
how these Americans prosper in 
your land ! See how they build 
mansions ! How they build colleges ! 
How they have improved ! How 
they have prospered ! And look at 
your little hovels that you and your 
fathers have lived in for ages ! We 
want to get rid of these Ameri- 
cans." 

That was the spirit of the exhor- 
tation given by one of their com- 
manding officers to the rebels, which 
inspired them to hatred and to plun- 
der. I will venture the prediction 
that if our good people from Mex- 
ico will only maintain the spirit of 
the Gospel, and will seek to see and 
observe, in the midst of the clouds 
that overshadow them today, and 
acknowledge the hand of God in 
that which has occurred, by and by. 
if not now, they will see it. They 



PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH,

will see that the Lord Almighty has 
delivered them perhaps from death, 
and perhaps from something that 
would be worse than death, if they 
had been permitted to remain. I 
do not know. Do not be discour- 
aged. You have friends here, and 
friends everywhere. You have 
proven your worth, your intelli- 
gence, that you are men and women 
of high standing among men. You 
have been patient and forbearing; 
and when you have had to suffer in- 
dignities, you have taken it patient- 
ly ; when you have been smitten you' 
have not smitten again ; when your 
brethren have been shot down in 
cold blood you have restrained your 
passion, you have withheld your 
wrath, and you have exercised your 
patience and have been willing to 
leave these things in the hands of 
God. 

Who could do this but men of the 
highest type in the world? Who 
could do it except he was inspired 
by the spirit of the meek and lowly 
Son of God, who said to the world : 
"If a man smite you on the one 
cheek, turn to him the other also," 
and "return good for evil" Exer- 
cise patience, forbearance, long- 
suffering, forgiveness, for they who 
would wrong you "know not what 
they do," any more than those who 
cried, "Crucify Him and let His 
blood be upon us and our children." 

These miserable people are moved 
by greed and jealousy, and the spirit 
of their leaders who are apparently 
steeped with hatred and envy to- 
ward a people that can prosper in a 
land that will doubtless lie dead and 
unimproved for centuries to come, 
as it has in the past, if no one goes 
there to improve it and to develop 
it other than the wretched people 
who inhabit it today. We are not 
here to shed blood. God has not re- 



quired of us to take up arms against 
mankind to defend ourselves by the 
bayonet or the cannon or the sword. 
He has given us a chance to get up 
like gentlemen and come away from 
the scene of strife, and hypocrisy to 
where we can find peace and free- 
dom. That is far better than to 
have the stain of blood upon our 
hands. We do not want their blood 
on our hands, nor do we want our 
blood shed by them. We are not 
obliged to stay among them, and I 
hope that wisdom and the spirit of 
"peace on earth good will to men" 
will pervade the councils of our na- 
tion; that by and by, perchance, an 
opportunity may open up by which 
intervention, not by arms, not by 
war, but by overtures of peace and 
good will to those people, that they 
may be brought to a realization of 
the dreadful conditions they are 
bringing upon themselves and upon 
their country. We do not want war. 
We do not want to see our nation 
go to war. We would like to see 
it the arbiter of peace for all na- 
tions. We would like to see the 
government of the United States 
true to the Constitution, an instru- 
ment inspired by the spirit of wis- 
dom from God. We want to see the 
benignity, the honor, the glory and 
the good name and the mighty influ- 
ence for peace of this nation ex- 
tended abroad, not only over Ha-, 
waii and the Philippines, but. over 
the islands of the sea east and west 
of us. We want to see the power, 
the influence for good, for elevat- 
ing mankind, and for the establish- 
ment of righteous principles spread 
out over these poor helpless peoples 
of the world, establishing peace, 
good will and intelligence among 
them, that they may grow to be 
equal, if possible, to the enlightened 
nations of the world.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



I always thought it was a mistake 
when one of our administrations 
turned down the overtures of 
Hawaii to be annexed to and be- 
come a part of the United States. 
And I admired the wisdom of an- 
other administration which admitted 
them to territorial rights and priv- 
ileges under the protection of our 
government. 

I think it is our duty to cultivate 
peace, and to ameliorate the condi- 
tion of the Filipinos, Hawaiians, 
Haytians and Cubans, and. else- 
where in the world. I believe the 
time will come when the arm of 
peace of this nation will be extended 
to the distracted little southern re- 
publics, where a rebellion arises 
almost every year against their con- 
stituted authorities. I hope to see 
the day when the counsels of peace 
and good will from this powerful 
nation will be so recognized by the 
people of this continent all the way 
to the south of us, and by the in- 
habitants of the islands that border 
upon our coasts, both east and west, 
that peace and good will and eleva- 
tion may be brought to pass and es- 
tablished among them through the 
instrumentality of an enlightened 
people. And I hope with all my 
soul that the members of the Church 
of Tesus Christ of Latter-day Saints 
will be loyal in their very hearts and 
souls, to the principles of the Con- 
stitution of our country. From 
them we have derived the liberty 
that we enjoy. They have been the 
means of guaranteeing to the for- 
eigner that has come within our 
gates, and to the native born, and 
to all the citizens of this country, 
the freedom and liberty that we pos- 
sess. We cannot go back upon such 
principles as these. We may go 
back upon those who fail to execute 
the law as they should. We may be 



dissatisfied with the decision of 
judges, and may desire to have 
them removed out of their places. 
But the law provides ways and 
means for all these things to be 
done under the Constitution of our 
country, and it is better for us to 
abide the evils that we have than to 
fly to greater evils that we know 
not what the results will be. All 
we have to do if an officer is not 
executing the duties of his office 
righteously is to impeach him or 
wait till his term of office is out, 
and then shelve him in the lawful 
way. The people have the power to 
leave him out and put a better man 
in his place, and that is strictly in 
accordance with the commandments 
of God contained in the book of 
Doctrine and Covenants. "Where- 
fore honest men, and wise men 
should be sought for diligently and 
good men and wise men ye should 
observe to uphold," in positions of 
honor and of trust, that they may 
execute righteousness and prove 
themselves worthy of the confidence 
and patronage of the people who 
elevate them to positions. 

I believe with all my sotil in the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ, and in the 
law of God, and I do not think any 
honest and intelligent man or wom- 
an could help but believe in the jus- 
tice, the righteousness and the 
purity of the laws tnat God wrote 
upon the tablets of stone. These 
principles that I propose to read to 
you are the foundation and basic 
principles of the Constitution of our 
country, and are eternal, enduring 
forevermore, and cannot be changed 
or ignored with impunity: 

"And God spake all these words, 
saying, I am the Lord thy God 
which hath brought thee out of the 
land of Egypt, out of the house of 



PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH.

bondage. Thou shalt have no other 
gods before me." 

That is what it means now, and 
what it meant to the Latter-day 
Saints and what the Latter-day 
Saints understood it to mean when 
they embraced the Gospel of Jesus 
Christ. 

"Thou shalt have no other gods 
before Me." He is the Father of 
our spirits, the Father of our Lord 
and Savior Jesus Christ, who is our 
God ; and we shall not have any 
other before Him. 

"Thou shalt not make unto thee 
any graven image or any likeness 
of anything that is in heaven above 
or that is in the earth beneath, or 
that is in the water under the earth." 

"Thou shalt not bow down thyself 
to them nor serve them, for I, the 
Lord thy God am a jealous God, 
visiting the inquity of the fathers 
upon the children unto the third 
and fourth generation of them that 
hate me, and showing mercy unto 
them that love me and keep my 
commandments." 

Infidels will say to you: "How 
unjust, how unmerciful, how un- 
Godlike it is to visit the iniquities 
of the parents upon the children to 
the third and fourth generations of 
them that hate God." How do you 
see it ? This way ; and it is strictly 
in accordance with God's law. The 
infidel will impart infidelity to his 
children if he can. The whore- 
monger will not raise a pure, right- 
eous posterity. He will impart 
seeds of disease and misery, if not 
of death and destruction, upon his 
offspring, which will continue upon 
his children and descend to his chil- 
dren's children to the third and 
fourth generation. It is perfectly 
natural that the children should in- 
herit from their fathers, and if they 
sow the seeds of corruption, crime 



and loathsome disease, their chil- 
dren will reap the fruits thereof.' 
Not in accordance with God's 
wishes for His wish is that men will 
not sin and therefore will not trans- 
mit the consequences of their sin to 
their children, but that they will 
keep His commandments, and be 
free from sin and from entailing 
the effects of sin upon their off- 
spring; but inasmuch as men will 
not hearken unto the Lord, but will 
become a law unto themselves, and 
will commit sin they will justly reap 
the consequences of their own in- 
iquity, and will naturally impart its 
fruits to their children to the third 
and fourth generation. The laws 
of nature are the laws of God, who 
is just; it is not God that inflicts 
these penalties, they are the effects 
of disobedience to His law. The 
results of men's own acts follow 
them. 

"Thou shalt not take the name of 
the Lord thy God in vain, for the 
Lord will not hold him guiltless 
that taketh His name in vain." 

This is an eternal principle; it is 
not one that we may obey today 
and disobey tomorrow, or that we 
may espouse today as a part of our 
faith, and abandon tomorrow with 
impunity. It is a principle that is 
inherent in the plan of life and sal- 
vation, for the regeneration of man- • 
kind. 

"Six days shalt thou labor and do 
all thy work, but the seventh day is 
the Sabbath of the Lord thy God, 
and in it thou shalt not do any 
work, thou nor thy son nor thy 
daughter nor thy man-servant, nor 
thy maid-servant, nor thy cattle," 
etc. 

That is : "Thou shalt honor the 
Sabath day and keep it holy." Do 
we do it? Is it necessary to do it? 
It is absolutely necessary to do so in 



10 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



order that we may be in harmony 
with God's law and commandments ; 
and whenever we transgress that 
law or that commandment we are 
guilty of transgressing the law of 
God. And what will be the result, 
if we continue? Our children will 
follow in our footsteps; they will 
dishonor the command of God to 
keep one day holy in seven; and 
will lose the spirit of obedience to 
the laws of God and His require- 
ments, just as the father will lose 
it if he continues to violate the com- 
mandments. 

"Honor thy father and thy moth- 
er, that thy days may be long in the 
land which the Lord thy God giveth 
thee." 

When will we ever outgrow that 
command? When can we set it 
aside? When shall we reach the 
time that we can dishonor our 
father and mother? Never! It is 
an eternal principle, and I am sorry 
to say— not sorry for the Japs and 
for the Chinese, these heathen na- 
tions, as we have been in the habit 
of calling them— I' am not sorry for 
them but for the comparison with 
them Those heathen nations set 
the civilized Christian world an ex- 
ample in the honor they bestow upon 
their parents, and yet this Christian 
people and nation and all the Chns- 
• tian nations of the earth, who have 
the word of the Lord, and the coun- 
sels of the Son of God for their 
guidance, are not leading out in 
setting an example of obedience, as 
they should, to this great command- 
ment of the Lord. "Honor thy 
father and thy mother that thy days 
may be long in the land which the 
Lord thy God giveth thee.' ^ 

Again, "Thou shalt not kill. 
That is a command of God. It is 
irrevocable unless He revokes it; 
you and I can't revoke it ; we must 



not transgress it ; it is binding upon 
us. We should not take away the 
life we cannot restore or give back. 
It is an eternal, unchangeable law. 

"Thou shalt not commit adultery." 
Just as unchangeable, just as eter- 
nal, for the adulterer hath no place 
in the kingdom of God, nor can he 
attain to an exaltation there. 

"Thou shalt not steal." 

"Thou shalt not bear false wit- 
ness against thy neighbor." 

"Thou shalt not covet thy neigh- 
bor's house, thou shalt not covet 
thy neighbor's wife, nor his man- 
servant, nor his maid-servant, nor 
his ox, nor anything that is thy 
neighbor's." 

"Thou shalt not covet." We may 
say we are thankful that the Lord 
has blessed our neighbor above that 
which He has blessed us. We may 
be thankful that the Lord has given 
to our neighbor greater wisdom and 
ability to honestly gather to him- 
self. But we should not covet it. 
We should not be envious, because 
we are commanded not to be. 

Now, these are the command- 
ments of God, the principles con- 
tained in these commandments of 
the great Eternal are the principles 
that underly the Constitution of our 
country and all just laws. Joseph 
Smith, the prophet, was inspired to 
affirm and ratify this truth-, and he 
further predicted that the time 
would come, when the Constitution 
of our country would hang as it 
were by a thread, and that the Lat- 
ter-day . Saints above all other peo- 
ple in the world would come to the 
rescue of that great and glorious 
palladium of our liberty. We can- 
not brook the thought of it being 
torn into shreds, or destroyed, or 
trampled under foot and ignored by 
men. We cannot tolerate the senti- 
ment, at one time expressed, by a 



PRESIDENT ANTHON H. LUND. 



11 



man, high in authority in the nation. 
He said: ''The Constitution be 
damned; the popular sentiment of 
the people is the constitution!" 
That is the sentiment of anarchism 
that has spread to a certain extent, 
and is spreading over ''the land of 
liberty and home of the brave." We 
do not tolerate it. Latter-day Saints 
cannot tolerate such a spirit as this. 
It is anarchy. It means destruc- 
tion. It is the spirit of mobocracy, 
and the Lord knows we have suf- 
fered enough from mobocracy, and 
we do not want any more of it. Our 
people from Mexico are suffering 
from the effects of that same spirit. 
We do not want any more of it, and 
we cannot afford to yield to that 
spirit or contribute to it in the least 
degree. We should stand with a 
front like flint against every spirit 
or species of contempt or disrespect 
for the Constitution of our country 
and the constitutional laws of our 
land. 

Faith in God is an irrevocable 
principle, just as much as "thou 
shalt not kill ;" "thou shalt not 
steal ;" "thou shalt not commit adul- 
tery." Repentance of sin is an 
eternal principle and is as essential 
in its place and is as much an in- 
tegrant part of the gospel of Jesus 
Christ as is: "Thou shalt not kill," 
or "Thou shalt have no other gods 
before Me." 

Baptism for the remission of sin 
by one having authority is an eter- 
nal principle, for God devised it, 
and commanded it, and Christ Him- 
self was not above obeying it; He 
had to obey it in order to fulfil the 
law of righteousness. 

And then the rites of the Priest- 
hood of the Church as the Lord has 
revealed them, and the principles 
that underlv the organization of the 
Church of Jesus Christ are irrevoca- 



ble, unchanging and unchangeable. 
We talk of the "Everlasting Gospel 
of Jesus Christ," which "is the 
power of God unto salvation," and 
these principles in and of themselves 
are eternal principles and will last 
while life or thought or being lasts 
or immortality endures. 

My brethren and sisters, let us 
obey the Gospel ; let us keep the 
commandments of God. Tf we will 
obey the Truth the Truth will make 
us free. How free? Free from 
sin, free from the results of trans- 
gressing the law, which is sin, for 
sin is transgression of the law of 
God; free from transmitting loath- 
some diseases ; free from every im- 
moral act, and the consequences 
therefor. Free from bloodshed, and 
from deceit and hypocrisy. It will 
make us honest, and devoted to that 
which is good, to that which we be- 
lieve and know to be right. 

I am for the Kingdom of God 
and His righteousness, and I am 
willing to leave all other things to 
the mercy and kindness of the 
Father to be supplied as He may 
feel disposed. God bless you is my 
prayer. Amen.

PRESIDENT ANTHON H. LUND. 

The Bible a book of inspired writings, 
though imperfectly translated — Mod- 
ern Scripture as important as the an- 
cient—Changes in national affairs 
should be carefully considered. 

I have listened with much interest 
to the able discourse that has been 



12 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



delivered by our President. I hope 
that every one in the house heard 
him, for I know, and the Latter-day 
Saints know, that he has given us 
correct principles and the word of 
the Lord. 

When he read the Ten Com- 
mandments I thought that here we 
have a law given several thousand 
years ago, which I do not think any 
one can improve, and which is to- 
day as important and necessary to 
be obeyed, and as fitting to all the 
conditions of man as when the 
Lord first wrote them on stone tab- 
lets with His own finger. He gave 
them to Moses, who has been called 
His first pen. It is true that we 
have very few writings from the 
ages before the time of Moses, and 
yet we have reason to believe there 
were books written even before the 
flood, for in the days of the Apos- 
tles, Jude quoted the prophecy of 
Enoch, from which we infer that 
the writings of Enoch were extant 
in his day, and I have no doubt that 
Abraham and Moses had access to 
the writings of Enoch. 

We believe in this book (the 
Bible) from which the President 
read the law of God. It is a collec- 
tion of sacred books written by men 
of God in different ages under the 
inspiration of the Holy Ghost. In 
studying the history of the people 
of God and reading these sacred 
books we find prophecies recorded 
in them which are shown by suc- 
ceeding writers to have been ful- 
filled. The Bible contains proph- 
ecies clear to the end of the New 
Testament, and history proves that 
some of those extending beyond 
the time of the Apostles have also 
come to pass. Evenrs foretold by 
the Son of God when He was upon 
the earth have taken place, even 
when it seemed very improbable 



that this could be the case. When 
He sat on the Mount of Olives and 
looked upon Jerusalem, and beheld 
the glittering roof of the magnifi- 
cent temple, the pride of the Jews, 
He was prompted to say that not 
one stone should be left upon an- 
other of that beautiful structure; a 
prophecy that must have sounded 
strange to those who listened to 
Him, because it was so solidly, so 
strongly built. Rocks of immense 
dimensions were laid in the found- 
ations, and placed in the walls ; but 
Jerusalem, refusing to listen to the 
word of God through His Son, 
suffered all that He predicted. Not 
a stone was left upon stone of the 
temple. The ground even was 
ploughed so that the Jews should 
not know the exact place where the 
temple had stood. These proph- 
ecies uttered by men at different 
times and having been fulfilled, 
prove the inspiration of those who 
uttered them, and prove that this 
book, the Bible, contains the word 
of God, and hence it should be read 
and studied and meditated upon 
now as it has been in ages past. 
The tendency to look upon it as 
having been written in ages of ig- 
norance, and therefore not adapted 
to our time, should not be enter- 
tained by us. The word of the 
Lord is there. 

It is true that we have made a 
modification in our articles of faith, 
saying that we believe the Bible to 
contain the word of God in so far 
as it is translated correctly. Some 
have thought that that would be an 
excuse for us to refuse certain parts 
and to accept others. Now, I will 
say for the Latter-day Saints that 
they believe in the Bible as strongly 
as those who claim that every word, 
and every point of punctuation, 
were placed there by inspiration. 



PRESIDENT ANTHON H. LUND.

The latter opinion cannot hold. 
We have very many versions of the 
scripture, and some statements in 
one version may be nearly opposite 
in meaning in another. If we had 
the original manscript of the Bible, 
we might say that we believe that 
the Bible contains, from lid to lid, 
the word of God ; but knowing that 
the book has come down to us 
through the course of many cen- 
turies, has been translated and re- 
translated, written and re-written, 
and knowing that no human work 
is perfect, we admit that errors 
have crept into it, though such er- 
rors may have been /Unintentional. 
For instance, in the Danish Bible 
and in the Douy version we are told 
that the world was framed by the 
word of God, that from invisible 
things visible things might be 
made — something that con- 
forms to the theory of certain 
philosophers of our age, while the 
Swedish and German versions say 
that by the word of God the world 
came forth out of nothing. In one 
Bible that remarkable passage of 
Paul, I Corinthians 15:29, reads: 
"Why are they then baptized for 
the dead," and in another : "Why are 
they then baptized over the dead." 
You can take the different trans- 
lations and you will find them vary- 
ing. If we then say that we believe 
the Bible to be the word of God as 
far as it is translated correctly, and 
that errors have crept into it, we 
are only expressing the same idea 
as some eminent theologians have 
done. When I was in England I 
read what Bishop Ellicot said on 
this matter. He stated that in the 
Epistle to the Galatians, which con- 
tains one hundred and forty-nine 
verses, he would like to make two 
hundred and fifty-two corrections, 
because he held they were incorrect, 



inexact and insufficient or obscure. 
Now, this was an eminent divine, 
Bishop of Gloucester, in England, 
who held this view. Going over the 
Book of Matthew another reverend 
gentleman says that he could point 
out seventy mistakes. I do not 
know whether these men could do 
this or not. I am not seeking for 
mistakes in the scriptures, but I 
want to show that we Latter-day 
Saints, in believing and upholding 
the articles of faith formulated by 
the Prophet Joseph in regard to the 
Bible, hold consistent views. But 
let me say to you that the Lord has 
kept His hand over this inspired 
volume so that it has come down to 
us in such a form and shape that it 
is still His word and a guide to us, 
and we would like our people to 
study it. , 

It is necessary to have the writ- 
ten word of the Lord. When Lehi 
left Jerusalem it appeared to him 
to be of the greatest importance to 
have the writings of the prophets 
and holy men who had written be- 
fore he left Jerusalem, and he sent 
his sons back to Jerusalem, to ob- 
tain some of these sacred writings. 
Through the bravery of Nephi they 
were obtained, and were taken with 
them on their journey to this land. 
In the Book of Mormon we have a 
corroborative proof of how correct- 
ly the Bible has come down to us. 
Nephi was very much delighted 
with the prophecies of Isaiah ; he 
read and copied several chapters 
of them on his small plates, and 
they have come down to us and are 
found in the Book of Mormon, and 
we find very little difference be- 
tween his copies and our present 
Bible making the Book of Mor- 
mon, as Brother Roberts expressed 
it in his "New Witness for God," 
a new witness for the truth of the 



14 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Bible. In its simple, plain language 
it gives unto us the word of God. 
Remember that it was translated 
in the years between 1827 and 1830, 
before the Church was organized, 
before there could have been any 
thought in the young man Joseph's 
mind concerning the greatness of 
the work that he was called upon to 
be an instrument in the hand of the 
Lord to introduce into the world, 
and still we find recorded in that 
book the statement that the time 
would come when the people of 
God should gather from all nations 
to this land. What a plain proph- 
ecy ! And we have seen it and 
other prophecies in that book ful- 
filled. Our elders have gone to the 
different nations and without even 
preaching the gathering, the spirit 
of gathering has come upon the 
people, and the words in the second 
book of Nephi have been verified 
and the gathering has taken place. 

We have the Book of Doctrine 
and Covenants containing the reve- 
lation's of the Lord in our day. 
We want our people also to study 
this work and make themselves fa- 
miliar with the word of the Lord 
contained in it. While in many sec- 
tions perhaps instructions given 
were local, yet in most cases these 
instructions are just as valuable to 
us and good for us to follow, as 
they were for those to whom they 
were given. Also in this book we 
can point to quite a number of 
prophecies that have already been 
fulfilled, especially the early revela- 
tions. The fulfilment of these is the 
more striking when we consider 
how little Joseph of himself could 
know of what would take place. 
The prophecies uttered in that book 
have come by inspiration, and those 
that have not been fulfilled will be 
fulfilled. 



In all ages when the Lord has 
established a dispensation. His word 
through His servants to the people 
has been the law to them, and when 
they rejected it they did so to their 
own hurt. When Noah preached to 
the antediluvians he could perhaps 
not point to scriptures to prove his 
teaching, but he had the word of 
God direct to himself, and he told 
the people of the calamity that 
awaited the nations except they re- 
pented. They chose not to repent 
and the judgment came upon them. 
And so we could bring up examples 
clear down through the ages. When 
we read the beautiful prophecies of 
Jeremiah we would think that the 
people who had him in their midst 
would have honored him, but be- 
cause he showed them the errors of 
their ways, told them the course 
their government ought to take to 
secure national safety, they cast him 
into prison. Had they listened to 
his words I don't think he would 
have written his book of Lamenta- 
tions, but they brought the foretold 
calamities upon themselves by re- 
fusing to obey and listen to the 
words of an inspired prophet in 
their midst. 

I want to say that there is a great 
restlessness among the people, both 
of this nation and others, and there 
is a desire for a change in govern- 
mental methods. Now, while there 
may be reforms needed and the peo- 
ple want such inaugurated, it is well 
to take time and reflect upon the 
measures that are proposed. Look 
at the history of France. How op- 
pressed the masses of the people 
were ! They wanted a change, but 
the change they effected was a leap 
in the dark. We know what misery 
it brought upon that nation. While, 
on the other hand, good, staid old 
England gradually brought about 



ELDER CHARLES H. HART. 



15 



the reforms that the people wanted, 
and they are progressing in that 
safe way. So I want to say that 
although there is so much restless- 
ness, and so many hope that a 
change will be for the better, it will 
be well for all people, and especially 
the Latter-day Saints, to well con- 
sider any measure that is proposed 
to them, and weigh it well before 
they adopt it, that they may be sure 
it will be a change for the better. 

May the Lord bless you all, I ask 
in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

The congregation sang the hymn : 

Guide us, O Thou great Jehovah, 
Lead us to the promised land, 

We are weak, but Thou art able — 
Hold us with Thy powerful hand.; 

Benediction was pronounced by 
Elder Ben E. Rich. 

Conference adjourned until 2 
p. m. 



AFTERNOON SESSION. 

Conference was resumed at 2 
p. m. 

President Joseph F. Smith called 
the meeting to order. 
The congregation sang the hymn : 

Now let us rejoice in the day of sal- 
vation ; 

No longer as strangers on earth 

need we roam; 
Good tidings are soundir- to us and 

each nation, 
And shortly the hour of redemption 

will come. 

Prayer was offered by Elder 
Joseph E. Robinson. 
The congregation sang the hymn : 

Praise to the man who communed 
with Jehovah! 
Jesus anointed that Prophet and 
Seer- 



Blessed to open the last dispensation; 
Kings shall extol him and nations 
revere. 

ELDER CHARLES H. HART. 

(Of the First Council of Seventy.) 

I feel very much, my brethren and 
sisters, the need of your sustaining 
faith and the blessings of the Lord, 
to the end that our time may be 
occupied profitably during the time 
that I may stand before you this 
afternoon. 

I thought, while President Smith 
was talking, of an expressive re- 
mark in the Doctrine and Cove- 
nants, a revelation given to the 
Prophet Joseph Smith : "Remem- 
ber, the worth of souls is great in 
the sight of God ;" and it occurred 
to me that this truth is interwoven 
with the very fabric of "Mormon- 
ism," that it is one of the corner 
stones of the Gospel, that it is a 
part of the very genius of so- 
called "Mormonism." For many 
years the thought was prevalent 
that man was created for the prin- 
cipal purpose of giving praise to 
His Maker, that the purpose of the 
Lord in the creation of man was 
that he might render praise unto His 
Maker. While that is a very pleas- 
ing and profitable occupation for 
mankind, yet we are given to under- 
stand in modern revelation, through 
the Prophet Joseph Smith, that 
praise and prayer are not the chief 
purposes in the creation of man. We 
are told, by the Lord : "Behold, this 
is my work and my glory, to bring 
to pass the immortality and eternal 
life of man." We learn in modern 
revelation of the dignity of the hu- 
man soul, of its immortality ; also 
that intelligence, an attribute of 
spirit, "was not created, neither in- 
deed can be," to use the language 



16 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



as recorded in the ninety-third sec- 
tion of the Doctrine and Covenants. 
We learn that we are the spiritual 
children of God the Eternal Father. 
Jesus makes this plain in His an- 
swer to Mary, who was first at the 
sepulchre, when He said, "Touch 
Me not for I have not yet ascended 
to My Father, but go to My breth- 
ren and say unto them, I ascend 
unto My Father and your Fafher, 
to My God and your God." He 
proclaims there, the Master does, 
the brotherhood of man and the 
fatherhood of God ; that we are the 
children, the 'spiritual children of 
our Heavenly Father, just as He 
was the spiritual Son of the Eternal 
Father. We are told in Psalms that 
He was the first-born of every 
creature, meaning, of course, the 
first-born spiritually, because it 
would not be true that He was the 
first-born in the flesh of all the 
children of our Father, or of all 
creatures. As He was the spiritual 
Son of the Eternal Father, so are 
we the spiritual children of the 
Eternal Father. We had a birth 
before coming to this earth-life. 
Element is now added to spirit, and 
we are told that "spirit and element 
inseparably connected receiveth a 
fulness of joy," and this is one of 
the purposes of our earth-life, that 
we might have joy. "Adam fell 
that man might be, and man is that 
he might have joy," and that he 
might eventually have immortality 
and eternal life. There was no lack 
of appreciation in the value of hu- 
man life or in the value of a human 
soul in that the Savior was per- 
mitted, as a part of the divine pro- 
gram, to lay down His life for the 
redemption of mankind. Some — 
not of our church and who have not 
partaken of the light of modern rev- 
elation — discuss the question of 



whether that divine sacrifice might 
have been dispensed with, and 
whether it might not have been so 
ordered by the Father that the earth 
life of the Son would not have to 
be sacrificed. But it was necessary 
to have the Son lay down His life 
for the redemption of mankind, to 
bring about a restoration from the 
fall that came through Adam. There 
is significance in the expression of 
the Savior, "And I, if I am lifted 
up from the earth will draw all men 
unto me." It was necessary, no 
doubt, that He should suffer just as 
intensely as He did suffer, that His 
agony should be such that He sweat 
great drops of blood. That was an 
unusual occurrence. There are only 
a few recorded instances in the an- 
nals of history of men so suffering 
that they actually sweat blood ; but 
there are a few such instances in 
addition to that of the Savior where 
that phenomenon has occurred — 
men actually sweating blood. Those 
who hold that it might have been 
possible, that it might have been 
just as well for some other program 
to have been carried out for the re- 
demption of mankind, fail to recog- 
nize the fact that God is a God of 
law and justice. They think be- 
cause the Father is all-powerful, 
having the element of omnipotence, 
that therefore at His will He could 
have dispensed with the necessity 
of an atonement ; but we must take 
into account the fact that the Lord 
is a Lord of justice, of order and of 
law, as well as a God of mercy, and 
that mercy can not rob justice. It 
is necessary to recognize the har- 
monies in the attributes of deity. It 
was by reason of these harmonies 
existing in the attributes of Deity 
that it became necessary for the 
atonement to be made. We realize, 
as I said a moment ago, how men 



ELDER CHARLES H. HART. 



were drawn to the Savior by reason 
of that sacrifice, just as the people 
have been drawn to the Prophet 
Joseph Smith, and to the testimony 
for which his blood was shed. It 
was through no lack of appreciation 
of the value of life that the Prophet 
Joseph laid down his life, but it 
was a necessary and an important 
event in the development and 
growth of this work that he should 
seal his testimony with his blood. 
He did it cheerfully, and drew men 
unto him and unto his testimony by 
that act. The reason for the intro- 
duction of the gospel in this dis- 
pensation was because of the love 
the Father has for His children, the 
fact that their souls are very prec- 
ious in His sight. The organiza- 
tion, teachings and doctrines of the 
Church, are to the end that these 
precious souls, these sparks of di- 
vinity, may be brought up aright 
and saved. 

The auxiliary organizations and 
the various efforts put forth through 
them recognize the great worth of 
souls. Our missionaries realize the 
truth of the revelation to the 
Prophet Joseph, that "if it so be that 
you should labor all your clays in 
crying repentence unto this people 
and bring save it be one soul unto 
Me, how great shall be your joy 
with Him in the kingdom of our 
Father." If such great joy come 
by bringing one person only unto 
Christ, how much greater will be 
the joy where many souls are 
brought unto Him. Recognizing 
the truth of that principle, we are 
spending each year in our foreign 
missionary work hundreds of thou- 
sands of dollars, — I believe it runs 
into the millions, counting the value 
of the time of these two thousand 
or more missionaries who are 
abroad proclaiming the truth. 



Our Church school system and 
our work in the temples, recognize 
the great worth of the human soul, 
the necessity for its growth, and its 
progress along right lines. When 
you consider what it has meant in 
the Church to convert but one single 
soul, when we consider the life's 
work of some of these single con- 
verts to the Church, and the great 
stream of posterity that is ever wid- 
ening as the years come and go, to 
be traced to one of those single con- 
verts, we realize then how very 
precious to mankind is a human 
soul, and how important it is for 
him to be taught the gospel — faith 
in the Lord Jesus Christ, repent- 
ance from evil, turning away from 
all sin and entering the Church by 
baptism and the laying on of hands 
by one who has authority, that his 
sins may be wiped out, and that he 
may become a member of God's 
Church. I feel, my brethren and 
sisters, that this work of salvation 
both at home and abroad is a work 
that is worthy of the best efforts of 
all of us. Our temple work, I 
might add, is based upon the same 
great truth that the soul is of great 
worth. Although the person has 
departed this life, this temple work 
recognizes the glorious truth that 
there will be a resurrection, a re- 
uniting of the spirit with the body, 
and an opportunity given for re- 
pentence hereafter. 

May the Lord bless us, my breth- 
ren and sisters, and enable use to be 
zealous in this work of saving souls ; 
may we realize the truth of the 
revelation to the Prophet that souls 
are of great worth in the sight of 
God, and that the thing which will 
be of most worth unto us will be to 
declare repentence unto this gener- 
ation that we may bring souls unto 
Christ that we may have rest with

them in the kingdom of our Father. 
I pray in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDEE JOSEPH W. M'MTJBRIN. 

(Of the First Council of Seventy.) 

My brethren and sisters': I sup- 
pose a g-ood many of the people 
who are in this congregation this 
afternoon are somewhat surprised 
that members of the First Council 
of Seventy have been called upon 
to occupy this position at so early a 
stage in the proceedings of this con- 
ference. I am satisfied the brethren 
of that Council were sitting in com- 
parative ease in their feelings — with 
no thought of being called to speak 
but expecting to hear from other 
brethren of the Presidency, and of 
the Council of the Apostles. Elders 
of the Church are never sure as to 
who will be called upon, and are 
supposed to be ready always to give 
a reason for the hope they have 
within them. I trust, my brethren 
and sisters, that I may be able, un- 
der the inspiration of the Spirit of 
the Lord, to speak such words as 
shall in a measure give a reason for 
the hope that I have, as a member of 
the Church of Jesus Christ of Lat- 
ter-day Saints. I certainly feel that 
it is a very great privilege and 
honor, as well as a great responsi- 
bility, to have the opportunity of 
bearing testimony concerning the 
things of God in a general confer- 
ence of the Church. There are 
thousands and tens of thousands of 
men who by the light of the Holy 
Spirit have been converted to the 
doctrines of the gospel. Such men 
have loved those doctrines with all 
their strength, and have devoted 
their time and means for the up- 
building of the kingdom of God, 
have never had an opportunity of 
this sort. 



It has been my privilege, during 
the months that have passed since 
our last general conference, to 
travel quite extensively in the vari- 
ous stakes of Zion. I have appre- 
ciated the opportunity of being in 
the companionship of the members 
of the Council of the Apostles and 
in the companionship of the mem- 
bers of the First Council of Seventy 
in these travels. I feel that I have 
been very greatly benefited by the 
counsels of my brethren, and by the 
example that they have constantly 
set before me. I have also been 
benefitted and blessed, in coming in 
contact with the people, and with 
the presiding brethren in the vari- 
ous stakes of Zion. My testimony 
is that there are a host of good and 
capable men occupying positions of 
responsibility in the Church of 
Christ. Whether one goes to the 
north or to the south, to the east or 
to the west, he finds men whose 
hearts are set upon the things of the 
kingdom of God, and who are bend- 
ing their energies, and giving the 
very best there is in them, for the 
blessing of the people, and for the 
accomplishment of the work that 
God has set His hand to perform in 
this latter dispensation. 

It is a very pleasing thing to 
know that the blessings of the Lord 
are resting in very rich abundance 
upon the people in a temporal way. 
Wherever I have been I have heard 
expressions of gratitude concerning 
the blessings that are coming to the 
people. They seem to be in a most 
prosperous condition. The earth 
has been blessed and is yielding of 
its strength in much abundance, for 
the sustenance of the people. The 
parched places, in a manner of 
speaking, have become in many lo- 
calities springs of living water. 
"The desert places have been made 



ELDER JOSEPH W. McMURRIN.

glad," and happy and comfortable 
homes have been established over a 
wide extent of country, in fulfill- 
ment of the promises that have been 
made by our Father in heaven. An- 
cient prophets and prophets, who 
have lived and spoken in our own 
times have declared that just such 
blessings would characterize the lat- 
ter days. We should all be very 
grateful that we are privileged to 
live in an age of inspiration, that 
under the providences and loving 
kindness of our Father in heaven, 
our hearts have been touched by 
the testimony of the Lord Jesus, 
and that we have been made, by the 
power and inspiration of God, to 
comprehend the truth, and to know 
that God our Father has indeed 
spoken, and that He has revealed 
as of old, that form of doctrine that 
is able to make us wise unto salva- 
tion. 

I hope, my brethren and sisters, 
that we are all anxious to recog- 
nize, and honor, and be guided by 
the inspiration of the Lord. The 
word and counsel of God will 
always be made manifest through 
the channels of the Holy Priest- 
hood, for this is God's way of 
working among the people. God 
has raised up a ministry by sending 
holy beings who in their time as 
noted men upon the earth had been 
clothed with His power and author- 
ity. These holy angels have by the 
commandment of God conferred 
that authority upon men in this dis- 
pensation, and once more the Lord 
reveals His mind and His will to 
His chosen servants the Prophets, 
as He has always done, when He 
has had a ministry among men. The 
responsibility rests upon this people 
to hold up the hands of the servants 
of the Lord. The responsibility 
rests upon the people also to so 



order their lives that they can be 
in the companionship of the Spirit 
of the Lord, that they may be able 
to recognize the voice of the Good 
Shepherd as it is made manifest 
through the authority that God has 
established, that they may not be 
led away by the voice of strangers, 
but may be able always to discern 
the truth and to give their hearts 
to the truth, and their time and abil- 
ity for the spreading of that truth 
among the children of men. 

We are under obligation, my 
brethren and sisters, to make man- 
kind acquainted with the marvelous 
things that have been revealed in 
this dispensation. One of the old 
apostles taught the people in his 
time that as a result of his calling 
necessity had been laid upon him, 
he did not feel that he had anything 
to glory in of himself as "a man, but 
that very serious obligations had 
come to him, and that he was under 
necessity of making known the 
things of God that had been com- 
municated to him. He declared 
that woe would be unto him if he 
did' not preach the gospel, and that 
same manner of obligation and ne- 
cessity has come to the people of 
the Latter-day Saints. It was so 
taught by our Father in heaven to 
the Prophet Joseph Smith in the 
beginning. The great responsibility 
that the people are under is the 
preaching of the word of the Lord 
as it had been revealed, the carry- 
ing of glad tidings of great joy to 
the inhabitants of the earth. We 
have not been given authority sim- 
ply that we may be honored of men, 
or that we may be exalted among 
men. We have been given author- 
ity that we may be made the ser- 
vants of men, that we may be ready 
and willing to forget self, and to 
give our time and whatever ability 



20 



GEA ERAL CONFERENCE. 



God may have endowed us with, 
for the benefit and blessing and sal- 
vation of our fellow beings. 

I represent, my brethren and sis- 
ters, one branch of the great organ- 
ization of the Church, the Seventies 
of the Church of Christ. T feel that 
it is a very great honor indeed to 
be a representative of this body of 
men, for they have been spoken of 
in the revelations of the Lord as 
the ministry of the Lord, men spe- 
cially called to be preachers of the 
gospel of Jesus Christ. T don't 
know how much time we give as 
Seventies to a contemplation of the 
responsibilities that pertain to our 
calling, as they are outlined, in the 
book of revelations, but if we will 
take that book and read the word of 
the Lord we will discover that God 
has said that our calling is different, 
in a sense", to the calling of other 
men who bear the authority of the 
Holy Priesthood. We are expected 
to be preachers of the gospel con- 
tinually ; there is no period of time 
when we can lay off this responsi- 
bility. There is no time when we 
can hold our peace, and when- we 
can refrain from delivering the tes- 
timony that has been communicated 
to us by the power of God. The 
Lord rather indicates in this revela- 
tion, the 124th Section of the book 
of Doctrine and Covenants, that 
other men may preach the gospel as 
they may have opportunity, but that 
this order of the Priesthood are ex- 
pected to be in readiness at all 
times, and to be in the exercise of 
the authority conferred upon them 
constantly. I don't suppose that we 
can imagine that the Seventy are 
to be constantly away from home, 
or that they are always to be absent 
from their families. It is a part of 
the gospel plan that men shall give 
attention to their families, and shall 



provide for them. The gospel 
teaches that he who will not pro- 
vide for his family is worse than an 
infidel, and has already denied the 
faith, so that we cannot come to the 
conclusion from the revelation that 
we are to be constantly away from 
home in foreign missionary service. 
It' would be much more reasonable 
to decide that in addition to our 
missionary work abroad there must 
also be a missionary work at home. 
When we retunp from the mission- 
ary field we are not to feel that we 
can lay off the harness of the Holy 
Priesthood, or the responsibility 
that pertains to our calling, and the 
magnifying of that calling, but we 
should continue at home, as we may 
have opportunity, the same line of 
work to which we have given our 
attention in the missionary field. 

We are very glad to say, as a 
council, that some' of the presiden- 
cies in the stakes of Zion have been 
impressed during recent months, 
possibly for a little more than a 
year, with the advisability of exer- 
cising this great body of men in the 
preaching of the gospel here at 
home. We are very glad that this 
feeling has come to some of the 
stake presidents, and that they are 
planning for the use of this body 
of men in the preaching of the word 
of the Lord here at home in the 
stakes of Zion. There is a very 
great need for the preaching of the 
gospel, the first principles of the 
gospel, those principles that are nec- 
essary to the salvation of the human 
family, right here in our own midst. 
We have large numbers of young 
people who, through their own neg- 
lect, in a measure, and then it may 
be possible that through the neglect 
of others who should teach them, 
they have not been made as fully 
acquainted with these important 



ELDER JOSEPH W. McMURRIN. 



21 



principles that are so necessary to 
the salvation of the human family 
as they ought to be. In my judg- 
ment there needs to be in the wards 
and stakes of Zion much more of 
the preaching of these doctrines 
than we have the privilege of lis- 
tening to as a general thing. We 
are glad that large numbers of Sev- 
enties in one of the Salt Lake City 
stakes, two hundred of them, were 
recently called upon to take up a 
missionary labor, to go among the 
people who were indifferent, and 
there was a large number of such 
people, two or three thousand in 
one stake, — to labor with them in 
their homes to see if they could not 
be aroused to the necessity of doing 
their duty, the necessity of attend- 
ing the meetings of the various 
wards, of- partaking of the sacra- 
ment of the Lord's Supper, the ne- 
cessity of contributing of their 
means, through their tithings, for 
the building up of the work of God, 
the necessity of having prayers in 
the family, the necessity of having 
children connected with the Sab- 
bath Schools and with other aux- 
iliary organizations of the Church. 
These Seventies were not only oc- 
cupied in the teaching of duty, and 
the teaching of principles of the 
gospel, to members of the Church 
who had grown somewhat indiffer- 
ent and lukewarm, but they were 
also called to preach to a large num- 
ber of people, three or four thou- 
sand souls, who were not members 
of the Church. I fear that we are 
not magnifying our responsibility 
as it ought to be magnified in re- 
gard to this matter. We go far off, 
and many men appear to be per- 
fectly willing to go abroad in the 
nations as representatives of the 
Church in the preaching of the gos- 
pel, but we seem to forget, to a 



great extent, the people who are 
right here — our neighbors who sur- 
round us on every hand, who are 
not of us, who are not interested in 
our faith, who do not come to our 
places of worship, and who conse- 
quently do not hear anything of the 
importance of the work planted by 
the Lord God of heaven through 
the revelation of His truth in these 
latter times. I believe these pre- 
siding men, stake presidents and 
bishops, should be very much con- 
cerned about these people who have 
come up from the nations, who have 
cast their lot with us, yet are not 
of us, and who do not have under- 
standing concerning our mission 
and the doctrines of the gospel that 
have been committed into our hands 
which we have been commanded to 
teach to all that live. Therefore I 
say I feel that it is a good work, 
indeed, to call upon these Seven- 
ties, because of the Lord indicating 
that they should be engaged in the 
ministry constantly, that they may 
be kept in the harness when at 
home just as they are kept in the 
harness when abroad. Seventies 
are not in the missions abroad as 
much as they ought to be. There is 
responsibility resting upon the pres- 
idents of quorums of Seventy to 
teach the members of their quorums 
that they should be anxious to mag- 
nify their office and calling, whether 
it be at home or abroad. They 
should be taught that it is not 
proper to seek for excuses when 
asked to do missionary service, but 
that men should feel, when they are 
desired for this service that they 
are sought after by the Lord of 
heaven. He it is who wants them 
to lift up their voices in the nations, 
and they should feel that it is a 
high honor indeed and a very great 
and blessed privilege to cry repent-

ance among the people, and bear 
testimony to the truth of the gospel 
of Jesus Christ. 

There is no greater truth in this 
world known to man than the truth 
that God has revealed. Tt is at 
the foundation of the peace ' and 
happiness and joy of all mankind in 
this life, and at the foundation of 
their eternal salvation and happi- 
ness in the life that is to come. 
Blessed is the man honored of God 
in holding authority to preach the 
word of the Lord. Blessed is the 
man who is clothed upon with the 
power of the Holy Ghost, and who 
has been made to know in his own 
soul that God has spoken, that He 
has revealed eternal principles that, 
if accepted, will lead men in the 
way of salvation. Men should be 
proud to engage in so wonderful a 
work, particularly when they have 
the promise of the living God that 
He will be their father and their 
friend, that He will ever be at hand 
to give them succor, and strength, 
and understanding, and power to 
accomplish the work allotted to 
them, if they will give their hearts 
to Him, if they will give their time 
and their attention to a study of the 
things that He has revealed. Men 
should be taught to honor and re- 
joice in this great responsibility. 
The Presidency of the Church 
should find in this army of men, 
when they seek after them, willing 
hearts, ready responses. Men 
should feel and say, "Yes, I am in 
the work of God ; I have given my- 
self to the accomplishment of the 
Lord's purposes ; here I am ; you 
can use me at home or abroad, 
wherever I am wanted, and I will 
be glad to do my part." That is 
our responsibility, and we recom- 
mend the Seventies of the Church 
of Christ to be in this manner of 



spirit, ready, willing, obedient, anx- 
ious to be laboring for the planting 
of the work of God. We suggest 
to presiding men that the Seventies 
cannot set themselves to work in 
the stakes of Zion in a regular mis- 
sionary effort, but the stake presi- 
dents can use these men, and of 
course other men as they see fit in 
the accomplishment of 'this labor, 
and there will be souls given for 
the hire of men who engage in the 
preaching of the gospel at home. 
Let us carry the word of God to 
those who are not of us here, just 
as cheerfully, just as earnestly, with 
just as much energy as we carry it 
abroad, and we will discover, per- 
chance, that our Father in heaven 
has been working upon the hearts 
of many people and has planted 
them in the Zion of God that they 
may hear the word of the Lord. 

God help us to love the truth, 
and to be true to it forever, is my 
prayer in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen.

trials throng your way," was sung

ELDEK RULON S. WELLS. 

(Of the First Council of Seventy.) 

My brethren and sisters, when 
President Smith was addressing the 
congregation in this Tabernacle,, 
this morning, I felt a keen interest 
in the very much afflicted people of 
Mexico, and I thought, what a 
blessed privilege it is to live under 
the stars and stripes in our own 
beloved country. When I heard and 
saw, as it was pointed out and 
painted before us, the awful pic- 
ture that prevails in that unfortu- 
nate country, I thought how happy 



ELDER RULON S. WELLS. 



23 



are we who live under a govern- 
ment, the fundamental law of which 
was an inspiration unto the found- 
ers of this great country. I won- 
der to what extent the people of our 
own country appreciate the splendid 
blessings that we enjoy. To what 
extent do they appreciate our lib- 
erties ? 

We read in the Scriptures that 
the whole world lieth in sin, and 
under the bondage of sin, so, as 
President Smith pointed out, the 
true freedom that men and women 
ought to seek is to be free from the 
bondage of sin. I believe that there 
are a great many people who have 
very erroneous ideas regarding lib- 
erty and what is meant by freedom. 
There are some, no doubt, who 
think it means the privilege of doing 
anything they please, a class of peo- 
ple who object to having any re- 
strictions placed upon them what- 
ever. A person cannot be free who 
does not restrain himself, who does 
not live under wholesome restric- 
tion. Only those are really free 
who have a control over them- 
selves, and who live in a com- 
munity where a wholesome re- 
straint is held upon the conduct 
of their fellow men. If a per- 
son felt, and acted accordingly, that 
he had the right to do whatever he 
pleases, no man's life would be se- 
cure, no one's property would be 
safe, and very few would have the 
privilege of pursuing happiness. I 
love the government of the United 
States for this fact, that it gives un- 
to its citizens the greatest measure 
of freedom consistent with the 
rights of their fellow men, and con- 
sistent with right living. 

Not very long ago I was visiting 
one of the stakes of Zion, and we 
heard of a number of our young 
men who were about to go out, or 



had just recently gone out on an ir- 
rigation project, to engage in build- 
ing a ditch. These boys had been 
brought up under the wholesome 
restrictions of the gospel, but they 
were not of the metal that our boys 
usually are, for these boys, when 
they went out into this camp life 
and came in contact with others 
who were not of our faith, and not 
under those wholesome restrictions, 
were influenced by their conduct. 
These men whom they found in the 
camp were engaging in the playing 
of cards, drinking beer, smoking 
cigarettes, profaning the name of 
the Lord, and divers other things of 
this character; and when our boys 
went out there they were invited: 
"Come, take a cigarette : have a 
glass of beer." At first they did 
not yield to it ; they had not been ac- 
customed to habits of that kind. But 
after a while these others began to 
taunt them and said. "Oh, take a 
cigarette. Don't be afraid. You 
are afraid to say that your souls are 
your own. Why don't you be free 
like me?" That was the spirit of 
the occasion, and, after a while, 
these boys — weaklings that thev 
were — yielded, and began to in- 
dulge in the same habits, because, 
forsooth, that a bully, with tobacco 
oozing out of his mouth, said, "Why 
don't you be free like me?" That 
was his conception of liberty— a 
veritable slave to appetite, and did 
not know it. He thought he was 
free, but he was under the bondage 
of sin, yielding to an unwholesome 
appetite. 

It has been pointed out, very 
truly, that the gospel, that the truth 
would make us free. The truth is 
the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. 
It has within it the power of God 
to save souls. It has the power to 
make us clean, to cleanse and purify 



24 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



our hearts, to rectify our habits, 
that we may not yield to those 
things that are harmful to the body ; 
and, if we acquire the power to re- 
sist the bodily appetites, we also ac- 
quire the power to resist the tempter 
in whatever form he may come. We 
should acquire the power to resist 
sin, because only those are free who 
obtain this power, and the gospel 
has been revealed from heaven that 
men and women might be liberated 
from sin. We live in a land of 
liberty, and how I do rejoice and 
glory in it. But with all our boasted 
freedom this nation, in common 
with other nations of the world, is 
under the bondage of sin, and we 
think that we are free, but we are 
not free until we shall overcome sin, 
until we shall yield obedience to the 
gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ, 
until the truth will break the shack- 
les of sin and make us free. That is 
the cry that goes out to the nations 
of the earth. Let them heed it and 
know this, that no man is free until 
he does overcome evil and yield obe- 
dience to the truth that has been 
revealed from heaven. I pray that 
the Lord will give unto us the power 
to overcome evil, that He will in- 
spire us with a desire to overcome 
our own wrong habits, and teach us 
that we may take an active part in 
spreading a knowledge of this 
wholesome truth in all the world. 

I endorse with all my soul the re- 
marks of my brethren who have 
preceded me, and hope that we may 
engage in the saving of human 
souls, that our voices may be heard 
in defense of the truth and in the 
proclamation of the fact that God 
has spoken from heaven and re- 
stored, in the day and age in which 
we live, His everlasting gospel, the 
only gospel that ever was pro- 
claimed among the children of men 



that had within it the power of God 
unto salvation. This gospel lays 
hold upon the lives of the children 
of men. It teaches them to do those 
things that will cleanse and purify 
them and liberate them from this 
terrible bondage. It should incline 
the hearts of the children of men 
unto God. It teaches first and fore- 
most faith in God. It teaches men 
and women to turn their hearts to 
Him, that they may derive wisdom 
and understanding and the inspira- 
tion of His Holy Spirit. It teaches 
men and women to put their trust in 
Him, and to acknowledge His hand 
in all things. "In nothing cloth man 
offend God, or against none is His 
wrath kindled, save those who con- 
fess not His hand in all things, and 
obey not His commandments," not 
only in our prosperity but in our 
adversity ; not only in our fortune 
but in our misfortune ; not only in 
life but also in death. What would 
we be if there was no such thing as 
sorrow in this world ? What would 
men and women be in character? 
They would be unsympathetic ; they 
would not love their fellow men ; 
they would not have those fine traits 
of character, those noble qualities of 
heart and of mind, were it not for 
the fact of the trials they have to 
endure, the adversity that they have 
to put up with, and the difficulties 
they have to encounter. We would 
not progress ; we would not be pro- 
gressive beings if it were so ; but 
thank the Lord that His hand is in 
all these things. Those things which 
sometimes seem to be our greatest 
sorrows will be sanctified for our 
good, and often have the purpose 
in the wisdom of the Almighty of 
bringing us nearer to Him. The 
one thing for us always to remem- 
ber is the Lord our God, and recog- 
nize His hand in all things, and if

we will do that every misfortune, 
every difficulty that may come to us, 
every adversity that overtakes us, 
will be a blessing though it be in 
disguise, for nothing of our experi- 
ences in mortal life will be in vain ; 
all will have its purpose and all will 
go to make up our character. 

After all, the success of this life is 
not measured at the end of it by 
what we have, but rather by what 
we are, and that is what we want 
to remember. This gospel teaches 
us to repent of sin <ind turn away 
from evil, to cleanse and purify our 
hearts. This gospel leads us to seek 
forgiveness of sin in the waters of 
baptism, that they may be washed 
away in the blood of the Lamb of 
God, that we may be approved of 
our Heavenly Father, and that we 
may be in a condition that His Holy 
Spirit may be conferred upon us 
through the laying on of the hands 
of His servants, duly appointed, 
duly authorized to act in His 
name. And this is the distinguish- 
ing feature of this gospel, that the 
ordinances thereof, that these per- 
formances are done by men who 
have been endowed with power 
from on high. This principle of 
faith is world-wide, is taught in 
every denomination that you can 
find throughout the land. Likewise 
is the principle of repentance; and 
although they may consider them 
in a different light from what we 
do, nevertheless in their general 
expression they believe in these 
principles. Many of them believe 
in baptism. They may not regard 
it as essential to salvation, but in a 
general way they will accept of that 
holy ordinance as being a part of 
their faivh. They, however, differ 
in this regard ; it is the distinguish- 
ing feature of "Mormonism" that 
all these sacred ordinances must be 



performed by men who have been 
endowed with power from on high. 
These men perform the ordinances, 
not in their own power, not by their 
own volition, not by their own ap- 
pointment, but because they have 
been called of God and endowed 
with His- divine authority. Were it 
not for this distinguishing feature 
"Mormonism" would be no better 
than all the other 'isms of the world, 
but because of this it stands out as 
the work of God in contradistinction 
to all the other faiths of the world. 
That is not saying that there are not 
millions of good people in all the 
world ; it is not saying that there 
may not be honest and. sincere souls 
in every denomination. It merely 
proclaims the truth that God has but 
one church upon the earth, and He 
has blessed and endowed that church 
with power from on high, and calls 
men to minister in His name, and 
that which they do by that divine 
appointment will be recognized of 
Him just the same as if He did it 
Himself. But when men call them- 
selves to such holy and sacred call- 
ings, and perform these ordinances 
in their own authority and by their 
own appointment, they will not be 
recognized by our Heavenly Father, 
but only that shall be recognized 
which God Himself shall institute 
among the children of men. 

We do not say these things boast- 
fully, but we merely bear witness to 
them because it is the truth revealed 
from heaven. ' It is true that Joseph 
Smith was a prophet sent of God, 
and that holy angels administered 
unto him ; that they have conferred 
upon him the right to act in the 
name of the Lord. He was the 
mouthpiece of God unto this gener- 
ation. Through him the gospel has 
been restored in all of its primitive 
purity. Through him the Church

of Christ has been established again 
among the children of men, and all 
men should know it, and our mes- 
sengers should go out to proclaim 
it to the nations of the earth, and let 
every man and every woman pro- 
claim it at home as well as abroad, 
whenever they are called to min- 
ister in the name of the Lord. 

May the Lord help us to be faith- 
ful to these callings, and bear in 
mind that this gospel has the power 
to liberate us from sin and to make 
us free. I pray that we may event- 
ually be saved in the kingdom of 
God, in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 

ELDER J. GOLDEN KIMBALL. 

(Of the First Council of Seventy.) 

I will begin by reading a few 
words from the Prophet Joseph 
Smith's sayings. He said : "I want 
the liberty of thinking and believ- 
ing as I please. It feels so good not 
to be trammeled." I don't know 
whether I am able to make myself 
clear. Not long ago 1 had one of 
my friends — he was a good friend, 
too, president of a stake — he said : 
"Brother Kimball, you don't make 
yourself clear." Well, I don't know 
of any man on earth that ever did, 
so all people could understand 
aright. The Savior seemed unable, 
sometimes, to get His children to 
understand just what He meant, al- 
though He was very clear in the 
doctrine which He. preached. I 
know I have some friends who do 
not believe in the way I get at it, 
but I am not trying to please all of 
them, because that is absolutely an 
impossibility, so I have given it up. 
My temperament is such that I can- 
not say anything inspiring, or bub- 
ble with enthusiasm, and be clear, 
happy, or joyous, if I have to wear 



a restraining collar and cater to 
popular sentiments. I would like 
my preaching to have color, thrill, 
feel homelike, and revive old mem- 
ories, and myself feel free as a colt 
in a pasture. Now, if I can't feel 
that way among the Latter-day 
Saints, where on earth can I go that 
I will feel free ? 

For the past month or so, I have 
been reading political platforms, 
and promises, and pledges enough 
to last the people of these United 
States for a thousand years, if they 
are carried out. (Laughter.) I 
don't believe in making many prom- 
ises or pledges, but when you do 
make them, and issue a platform, I 
say try and live up to it. I have a 
platform on which my feet are 
placed, and I hope they are planted 
on a rock foundation, so that when 
the storms come and trouble finds 
its way amongst us, that T can dis- 
cern the difference between truth 
and error, between light and dark- 
ness. This is my platform : My 
faith is that God is the Father of 
all, and Christ is the Redeemer and 
Helper of all. I believe in Christ's 
religion as He taught it ; and I dis- 
cover that F : z doctrines never 
change. I further believe that 
Joseph Smith is a Prophet of God, 
and that this is the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints, as re- 
vealed by the Savior and His au- 
thorized servants to the Prophet, 
Joseph Smith ; that the Priesthood 
of God is the Constitution of the 
Church, and the present living 
prophets, and those associated with 
them, are true disciples of Christ, 
devoted to the interests of the peo- 
ple. I hope, brethren, you believe 
that this is my platform. I hope my 
long pilgrimage in this Church has 
impressed you that I am honest, 
earnest, and fervent in my convic-

tions ; that I have implicit and per- 
fect confidence in God and in His 
Son Jesus Christ. God rises above 
men. We are like Him, but He is 
perfect and that is why 1 have faith 
in Him, knowing that I will be re- 
warded for all of my faithful labors, 
and for all of my mistakes I will 
have to be resposible. 

Brethren and sisters, I have been 
thinking for quite a while about cer- 
tain things, and I have been boiling 
it down, like my father used to boil 
down the sugar cane juice, until I 
have got it down to about what I 
want to say to you today. Jesus 
Christ found a certain class of peo- 
ple when He came on the earth, a 
class who were doing a great deal 
of mischief among the children of 
men. If I were to put up an appeal 
to the Lord for the present genera- 
tion, I would say, "Give us MEN, 
men like our fathers, and women 
like our mothers, men and women 
who had faith in God, whose re- 
ligion was love and sacrifice, and 
who were willing to lay clown 
everything for God." They were 
men who were clean ; who were 
pure ; who were courageous, and 
who were not afraid to do right 
when they knew it was right. Now, 
that is the kind of men we. want. 
That is the kind of men we hope 
that our children will be. But, 
there is another class of men, T call 
them Half-Way Men ; T pray God I 
may never be found among them. 
I would rather be dead than to be 
numbered among half-way men, 
persons who have plaster cast ex- 
pressions on their faces, and are 
without hearts, without souls, with- 
out love and bigness. They are the 
hypocritical class, such as were 
found among men when Jesus was 
on the earth. They have the gall 
and nerve to want everything on 
earth as a reward for their assumed 



generosity. They call it alms-giving 
or helping the poor ; some call it re- 
ligion, but that is a misnomer. That 
kind of people are a spineless class, 
self-righteous, intolerant, and the 
cause of endless mischief. They 
never fight in the open. "They are 
demagogues and place hunters. 
They are perched upon every ant- 
hill, croaking out their stump 
speeches for this or for that man 
to hold office. They never give it a 
thought whether such a man will do 
good for the people or not." They 
are parasites who fed and fatten 
upon the people. "They want us to 
beat in the brush while they bag the 
game." Some of this is not orig- 
inal, but it is mighty good. (Laugh- 
ter.) When it comes to self-sacri- 
fice, fighting for the truth, they are 
like the dying man who was asked 
by the minister, "Will you denounce 
the devil and all his workings?" 
The dying man looked up in a 
feeble and distressed way and said, 
"Please don't ask me to do that. I 
am going to a strange country, and 
I don't want to make any enemies." 
(Laughter.) "Rock-a-bye baby in 
the tree top" won't work out our 
problems. There is no use crying 
"All is well in Zion," because it is 
not true. The question is, who is 
for God and who is against Him? 
This puts me in mind of another 
story. In the midst of an election 
in Denver, a little girl sat in a 
church with her suffragette mother, 
listening to a minister who was 
preaching with much earnestness 
and emphatic gestures. When he 
had finished the little girl turned to 
her mother and asked: "Mother, 
was he for or against God?" 

Now, we want to know who you 
are for. When we speak to the 
present generation we ask : Are we 
to be molded by our environment 
and tainted with the money devil, 



28 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



besmirched with graft and commer- 
cialism, swallowed up body and soul 
with political questions? Are we to 
be vanquished like the red men, 
forced to the wall and crushed into 
bent-backed humility and dull-eyed 
apprehension, and accept such a 
fate with grim stoicism and cease 
to try to avert our impending 
doom ? 

The "Mormon" people are a val- 
uable heritage to the race. We have 
had physical vigor, which must be 
one of the foundations for the men- 
tal strength of any lasting race of 
people. Our lives have been ruled 
by high impulses. There is only a 
generation or two between us and 
our pioneer fathers and mothers. It 
is physically impossible for this type 
of man to be produced in any other 
way than developing the possibili- 
ties of this splendidly endowed 
earth. Buckskin men are not de- 
veloped indoors. We cannot evolve 
men like Washington, Boone, 
George Rogers, David Crockett, 
Joseph Smith the Prophet, Brigham 
Young, or the other pioneers, under 
the present environment and educa- 
tional system. "We run our chil- 
dren through a course of, education 
covering from eight to twelve 
years, then they are turned loose 
and called educated." 

Our children need to be taught 
the great problems of the day, the 
schools should be ringing with the 
hammer strokes of the world's work 
shops, the children will thus become 
trained citizens of the republic. Our 
citizens will hereafter be studying 
and battling as heroically for their 
civic and industrial liberties as their 
forefathers, the war patriots, bat- 
tled for war ideals. 

This generation has had too 
much ease, too much money, too 
much pleasure. They have lived 



upon milk and honey when they 
ought to have been fed on bread, 
cresses, and cold water, and slept in 
the mountains. I am sorry my 
children have not lived on the kind 
of food I was brought up on ; then 
they would have more backbone. 
We should adopt a policy to stiffen 
their backbones, if necessary, feed 
them on "raw meat, cayenne pepper 
and green cactus diet." This world 
was not made just to hold people 
imbued with selfishness and unhap- 
piness, with no ambition beyond 
eating, drinking and begetting. We 
ought to plan ahead, have some pur- 
pose, that is truly living. "Life 
means opportunity. Life means de- 
velopment. Life well spent means 
knowledge, growth, simplicity of 
life and complexity of thought." 

"The day of the Laodicians is 
past, because they are lukewarm 
and neither cold nor hot," said the 
voice that spoke on the Isle of Pat- 
mos, "I will spue thee out of my 
mouth." "There are whole men 
whose mere bodies are in shameful 
service," because of the character 
of their employment they do not 
have freedom ; they do not have 
liberty like the "Mormon" people 
do who as a rule, own, and work 
the soil, but are half-men, like the 
Laodicians, servile souls, and I 
sometimes feel they are an encum- 
brance to the earth. 

Now, my brethren and sisters, 
with the help of the Lord, let us en- 
deavor to uplift the present genera- 
tion, that they may have breathed 
into them the spirit of their fore- 
fathers, that they may have courage 
to resist evil,live a better and cleaner 
life, find out what is right and then 
stay with it. Unless this genera- 
tion will get the spirit of our fore- 
fathers, what can God do to pre- 
serve the Constitution? Unless the

children of this nation rise up and 
get away from the bondage and 
serfdom of luxury, of ease, of com- 
fort — you can't evolve true men 
with that kind of environment — it 
can't be done. That is the appeal I 
make to the present generation; I 
tell you, God can do nothing with a 
"half-way man." You never saw 
one of them in your life that gave 
evidence of a yellow streak in him 
that ever amounted to anything. I 
sent one of my sons to do a certain 
thing. He did not get what he went 
after, but he held up his colors and 
fought to a finish. There never has 
been a time in my life when I was 
so proud of my boy; he did not 
show the yellow streak. That is the 
way I feel towards the kingdom of 
God. I don't know of a man in all 
the world that I could sustain easier 
than he who has fought his way up 
these mountains and over the val- 
leys, through hardships, sufferings 
and privations, like the President of 
this Church has. If any man on 
this earth has a right to his posi- 
tion today, and has earned it, he is 
the man ; and there are others with 
him. I was conversing with a prom- 
inent stranger yesterday, and he 
told me he was prejudiced when he 
came here, and I said: "I wish 
you had known our leading men, I 



wish you had been acquainted with 
Brigham Young, and Heber C. 
Kimball, you would have liked 
them." He said, "Do you think 
so ?" I replied, "I know you would 
or else you are not a man like I 
am." (Laughter.) 

I pray God to bless you, my 
brethren and sisters. I may be near 
the finish of my labor, but let it 
come and let come weal or woe, 
life or death, if God will give me 
His Spirit, and I retain the courage 
of my convictions, I will be true to 
God and defend the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 
The Lord bless you. Amen. 

President Joseph F. Smith made 
announcements, including a notice 
that members of the Church attend- 
ing Conference, who need lodgings, 
or board, could receive entertain- 
ment by applying to the committee 
acting under direction of the Presi- 
dents of Salt Lake City Stakes. 

The congregation sang the hymn : 

God moves in a mysterious way, 

His wonders to perform; 
He plants His footsteps in the sea. 

And rides upon the storm. 

Benediction was pronounced by 
Elder Melvin J. Ballard. 

Conference adjourned until Sat- 
urday, Oct. 5th, at 10 a. m. 



SECOND DAY. 



In the Tabernacle, Saturday, Oc- 
tober 5th, 10 a. m. 

Conference was called to order 
by President Joseph F. Smith. 
The congregation sang the hymn : 

ye mountains high, where the clear 

blue sky- 
Arches over the vales of the free, 
Where the pure breezes blow and the 

clear streamlets flow, 
How I've longed to your bosom to 

flee. 

Prayer was offered by Elder 
John L. Herrick. 
The congregation sang the hymn : 

O, say what is truth? 'Tis the fairest 
gem, 

That the riches of worlds can pro- 
duce; 

And priceless the value of truth will 
be when 

The proud monarch's costliest dia- 
dem 

Is counted but dross and refuse. 

ELDER BRIGHAM H. ROBERTS. 

(Of the First Council of Seventy.) 

I wish I knew who it was that 
said, "In essentials let there be 
unity ; in non-essentials, liberty ; 
and in all things, charity." But if 

1 ever knew who said it I cannot 
now remember who it was, and I 
don't know that it matters, because 
the beauty and truth of the utter- 
ance is self-evident. It is one of 
those things which the world has 
accepted into its literature as being 
true and sensible, and it matters 
little who said it since it does not 
require other authority than the 
thing itself to commend it to men. 



Listening as I have at least in 
some of the meetings of this con- 
ference to the discourse of my 
brethren, I have felt to rejoice in 
a knowledge of the fact that so far 
as essentials, absolute and positive 
essentials, are concerned, the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints stands on very firm and 
solid ground. We do know the 
things that concern the salvation of 
men. We know of God : not only 
of the fact of His being, but the 
kind of being He is, because He is 
fully revealed in the person and 
character of the Lord Jesus Christ. 
Jesus Christ is God manifested in 
the flesh. He is the Son of God, 
and as He was and is, so too, is the 
Father. As He acted and taught so 
the Father would have acted and 
taught had He come among men. 
The Lord Jesus Christ is not only 
the express image of the Father's 
person, and the brightness of the 
Father's glory, as the scriptures 
declare, but also He is a com- 
plete revelation of God, of all 
that is divine. So that we know 
God through the revelation of Him- 
self in the person of Jesus Christ ; 
and that the Father and the Son 
and the spirit-personage known as 
the Holy Ghost, constitute the su- 
preme godhead for us men, to 
whom we owe allegiance : to whom 
we submit our judgment and our 
will, for this alone is true worship. 
We know these divine personages 
also through their chief functions. 
The Father primarily is Creator. 
The Son primarily is the Revelator 



ELDER B. H. ROBERTS.

of God, and the Redeemer of men ; 
and the Holy Spirit is God's wit- 
ness of the Father and of the Son, 
and of all truth, the whole volume 
of it ; the divine Witness for God to 
the souls of men. Whatever divis- 
ions and opposite opinions may ex- 
ist in the world concerning the God- 
head, the Latter-day Saints are so 
blessed that there is perfect and ab- 
solute unity with reference to this 
great central truth of the Christian 
religion. 

We are equally at one in relation 
to the great fact of human redemp- 
tion; we know that we are re- 
deemed from the consequences of 
Adam's transgression through the 
atonement of the Christ, without 
condition, so far as that mere fact 
is concerned, that is without condi- 
tion on our part ; for as in Adam 
all died, even so in the Christ will 
all be made alive. We are redeemed 
from the consequences of our indi- 
vidual sins and transgressions also 
by acceptance of the atonement of 
the Christ ; and by obedience to the 
laws and ordinances of the gospel ; 
and we know, from the revelations 
of God, without any doubt whatso- 
ever, what those laws and ordi- 
nances are. We know that we must 
signify our acceptance of the atone- 
ment of the Christ by submitting to 
and performing the symbols of the 
atonement in our baptism; symbol- 
izing therein the death and the res- 
urrection of the Christ ; and in con- 
firmation by the laying on of hands 
we receive the baptism of the Holy 
Spirit. Being brought by that or- 
dinance and a right disposition into 
complete fellowship with the Holy 
Ghost — to have Him for friend and 
guide and witness of the truth in 
our souls. 

In order to keep in memory the 
covenants and obligations that we 



make, we repeat these symbols of 
the atonement in partaking of the 
holy sacrament ; partaking of the 
broken bread in remembrance of 
the broken body of the Christ ; par- 
taking of the water or the wine in 
memory of the shed blood of the 
Christ, witnessing unto the Father 
that we will always remember Him, 
and keep His commandments that 
He has given us ; in order that we 
might have all this crowned with 
the realization of that beautiful and 
splendid promise, that we shall have 
His Spirit always to be with us. 

In all these matters there is abso- 
lute, and must continue to be abso- 
lute unity among the Saints. There 
can be no variation. There can be 
no alteration. .There can be no de- 
traction from nor addition to these 
things. They are essential. We 
know also that these ordinances of 
the gospel are to be performed, and 
can only be performed properly by 
those who have received divine 
commission from God, who hold 
divine authority. God has made 
of His Church a depository of His 
truth, and has commissioned that 
Church with a divine authority to 
teach, in the power and demonstra- 
tion of His Spirit, these essential 
truths to all the inhabitants of the 
earth, our mission extending to 
every nation and kindred and 
tongue and people under the whole 
heaven — a universal church with a 
universal mission. In these essen- 
tial things we are united. We know 
also that in addition to this com- 
mission received of God to teach 
the truth, it is the mission of the 
Church to perfect the lives of those 
who receive the truth she teaches ; 
and that through teaching, persua- 
tion, patience, and long suffering. 
Such, in brief, is the mission of the 
Church of Christ; and we are 



32 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



united with reference to all these 
things. And not only are we united 
in relation to these things — these 
essentials — but in relation to the 
moral law of the gospel, the ethics 
of the Church of Christ, and of the 
gospel of Jesus Christ. I think 
there exists no ground for division 
in relation to the law of righteous- 
ness. We know the law of right- 
eousness — I had almost said, per- 
fectly well ; at least there is no 
ground for serious division among 
us in respect of what is truth, and 
justice, and righteousness, and 
morality in all things, and in all 
relations. 

The Latter-day Saints are a blest 
people. There does exist — I was 
about to say there can exist, but I 
would rather say there does exist — 
perfect unity in relation to all these 
essentials; in regard to the faith 
we have received, in regard to 
the dispensation of the fulness of 
times which God has revealed in 
these days unto us. And so I re- 
joice in these blessings, and can 
look forward with perfect confi- 
dence that in all these great and 
essential things, touching the salva- 
tion of men, the Church of Christ 
will remain absolutely united. Be- 
lief in and acceptance of these 
things are essential to the unity and 
integrity and the very existence of 
the Church. 

Now, when you contemplate that 
other division, the non-essentials, 
here you have a field wherein 
liberty should exist ; wherein should 
exist tolerance : tolerance in our so- 
cial relations and activities, in our 
commercial affairs, and in indus- 
trial pursuits ; in the sphere of civil 
government. These things in which 
the judgment of men mav be exer- 
cised, and where it is merely a ques- 
tion, perhaps, of policy, or of ad- 



ministration. If only we can infuse 
into this sphere of the non-essen- 
tials, where one man's judgment 
may be as good as another's, if in 
that field we can only bring in the 
principle of charity, and of toler- 
ance and the recognition of the lib- 
erty of all men, it seems to me then 
we shall have good reason to be- 
lieve that in this sphere of non- 
essentials, we shall get along quite 
as happily as we may in the field 
where we are united in reference to 
absolute essentials. I believe that 
we are entitled to take an optim- 
istic view with reference to these 
matters that make up the sphere of 
non-essentials ; and especially in re- 
lation to the sphere of civil govern- 
ment. There is a passage in the 
Book of Mormon that to me has 
been very instructive, and also very 
encouraging. I think I will read to 
you this passage, since some of you 
may possibly have missed it. It 
occurs in the Book of Mosiah, 
where there is described a transi- 
tion from a monarchial form of 
government to a reign of judges, 
which in reality was a sort of re- 
public, or rule by the people. The 
value of this passage that I shall 
read is in that it expresses confi- 
dence in the ability of the people to 
rule, to govern themselves ; and this 
inspired man, Mosiah, calls upon 
them to exercise that duty, and to 
do it in the fear of God. In recom- 
mending the changes in the form 
of the Nephite government, he

been given you by our Fathers, which 
are correct, and which were given them

common that the voice of the people de-

is right; but it is common for the lesser

part of the people to desire that which 
is not right. Therefore this shall ye 
observe, and make it your law, to do 
your business by the voice of the people. 
And if the time comes that the voice of 
the people doth choose iniquity, then is 
the time that the judgments of God will 
come upon you, then is the time He will 
visit you with great 'destruction even as 
he hath hitherto visited this land. * * * 
And I command you to do these things 
in the fear of the Lord, and I command 
you to do these things, and that ye have 
no kings ; that if this people commit 
sins and iniquities they shall be an- 
swered upon their own heads, for be- 
hold I say unto you, the sins of many 
people have been caused by the iniqui- 
ties of their kings. Therefore their in- 
iquities are answered upon the heads of 
their kings. And now I desire that this 
iniquity should be no more in this land, 
especially among this my people ; but I 
desire that this land be a land of liberty, 
and every man may enjoy his rights and 
privileges alike, so long as the Lord sees 
fit that we may live and inherit the land, 
yea, even as long as any of our posterity 
remains upon the face of the land." 

To my mind Joseph Smith, in 
bringing forth that principle 
through the Book of Mormon — the 
principle of personal, moral, re- 
sponsibility to God for the govern- 
ment that obtains in free republics 
— has contributed one of the might- 
iest thoughts to the political life of 
the age in which he lived, that any 
man has brought forth in all the 
contributions that have been made 
to political thought in America. 
Patrick Henry's idea that men had 
an inherent right to rebel against 
insufferable tyranny is not equal to 
it. Jefferson's great doctrine of the 
Declaration of Independence, that 
all men are created equal, and that 
they are endowed with the inalien- 
able rights of life and liberty and 
the pursuit of happiness, is not 
greater than this Book .of Mormon 
doctrine. Webster's great contri- 
bution of "nationalism," viz., that 
this nation was an indestructible 



union of indestructible states, is not 
superior to it. And Lincoln's great 
thought, that the principle of the 
Declaration of Independence, that 
all men are of right free, must hold 
good as to the colored race as well 
as to the white race, does not sur- 
pass it. Because this great Book 
of Mormon thought is this: that 
while governments derive their just 
powers from the consent of the gov- 
erned, there goes with that the aw- 
ful, moral responsibility, direct to 
God, of every man and woman par- 
ticipating as sovereigns in a free 
government, for the kind of govern- 
ment that obtains in such country. 
The great doctrine of direct, moral 
responsibility to God of a free peo- 
ple is indeed a soul-inspiring utter- 
ance, but it is also an awe-inspiring 
condition, and on its face bears evi- 
dence of the divine source whence 
it comes. 

Tt was upon this principle of con- 
fidence in the ability of the people 
to govern themselves ttiat the Lord 
inspired those whom we call the 
"fathers of our republic," the foun- 
ders of the constitution — it was 
upon this great principle of belief 
in the ability in the people for self- 
government, that the corner stones 
of this republic were laid. Gov- 
ernments were announced in the 
Declaration of Independence to be 
the creatures of the people ; and in- 
deed it was further announced in 
the Declaration of Independence — • 
and you must remcmDer that the 
Declaration of Independence is 
the preface to the Constitution, the 
Constitution merely organized 
agencies for carrying out the prin- 
ciples of liberty announced in the 
document known as the Declaration 
of Independence — it is announced, 
I say, that if governments be- 
come destructive of the liberties

and rights of the people, it is 
the right of the people to alter 
or even abolish them, and institute 
new forms that shall, in their judg- 
ment, tend better to preserve their 
rights and their liberties. 

Upon this subject I desire to read 
to you one declaration of President 
Brigham Young, who had some 
reputation for constructive states- 
manship and intelligent grasp of 
things. In this document before me 
I might possibly read to you things 
which in our present status might 
be regarded as somewhat startling, 
but I do not desire to do that. I 
would rather not bring confusion, 
but peace ; and since I am a man of 
peace, and desire it with all my heart 
— that is, that peace which is con- 
sistent with human liberty, and the 
preservation of human rights. But 
dear as peace is to me, it is not so 
dear that I would purchase it at the 
sacrifice of human rights and hu- 
man liberty. But I read to you that 
which I am sure we will all be in 
accord with. "The general consti- 
tution of our country," said Brig- 
ham Young, "is good ; and a whole- 
some government could be founded 
upon it; for it was dictated by the 
invisible operations of the Al- 
mighty. God's purpose in raising 
up these men and inspiring them 
with daring sufficient to surmount 
every opposing power, was to pre- 
pare the way for the formation of 
a true republican government. They 
laid the foundation, but when others 
came to build upon it they reared a 
superstructure far short of their 
privileges, if they had walked up- 
rightly as they should have done. 
* * * * The signers of the 
Declaration of Independence and 
the framers of the Constitution 
were inspired from on high to do 
that work. But was that which was 



given to them perfect, not admitting 
of any addition whatever? No; 
for if men know anything they 
must kiiow that the Almighty never 
yet found a man in mortality that 
was capable at the first intimation, 
at the first impulse, to receive any- 
thing in a state of entire perfection. 
They laid the foundation, and it was 
for after generations to rear the 
superstructure upon it. It is a pro- 
gressive and gradual work." 

I think it is divine wisdom mani- 
fested in the Constitution of our 
country that provision is made for 
its amendment, from time to time, 
as experience and larger views and 
changing conditions may warrant. 
However, upon this subject of 
change in the Constitution, I believe 
that the conservative spirit should 
prevail ; that care, and very great 
concern ought to be exercised with 
reference to change in the funda- 
mental law of our government; but 
let us not think because we believe 
in the great truth that the Constitu- 
tion of our country was the product 
of divine inspiration, that new con- 
ditions and a constantly changing 
status would not warrant, .from 
time to time, changes in the funda- 
mental law of the land. 

Now, in relation to all these mat- 
ters, we are operating in the realm 
of the non-essentials, that is, the 
realm where human judgment may 
be exercised ; and where men may 
not be able to come to absolute 
unity of understanding in relation 
to matters, and in that event, let us 
remember that it is the realm where 
liberty and tolerance prevail, and it 
is proper that charity also should 
abound. 

I thank the Lord and the brethren 
for this opportunity of saying so 
much in relation to these questions 
that are occupying the attention of 



ELDER SEYMOUR B. YOUNG. 



35 



the people. I rejoice that in the 
great field of the things which are 
essential, that the Lord has spoken, 
and that there is ground for abso- 
lute unity existing among us; and 
I sincerely trust that for this other 
field, in the realm of non-essentials, 
there will be liberty, and tolerance ; 
and in both — in the exercise and 
administration of both essentials and 
in the realm of liberty — the great 
principle of charity — which is the 
pure love of God — may abound. 

In conclusion, my brethren and 
sisters, let me once more bear wit- 
ness to you of the truth of the great 
latter day work, and proclaim once 
more my love and devotion for it. I 
love the gospel of Jesus Christ. I be- 
lieve and accept it with all my heart. 
If it is possible for the conscious- 
ness of man to be awakened to a 
knowledge of the truth of a thing, 
then I know, as I know I live, that 
God lives ; that Jesus is the Christ ; 
that men can form a companion- 
ship with the Holy Ghost ; that for- 
giveness of sin is true ; that the 
resurrection from the dead is a true 
doctrine ; that the divinity of the 
'Church is beyond question ; that the 
power of the Holy Priesthood is 
divine : and that man may hope for 
immortality and eternal life in the 
realms of freedom under the law of 
God. I testify to you that my soul 
has a witness that all these things 
are true, in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 

PRESIDENT SEYMOUR B. TOTING 

(President of First Council of Seventy.) 

My brethren and sisters : Indeed 
I am deeplv appreciative of the 
honor that I have in this privilege 
of addressing you for a few min- 
utes this morning. I have listened 
with very much pleasure, and I 
hope some profit, to the remarks 



of my brethren, and especially the 
introductory remarks of our Presi- 
dent at the beginning of this con- 
ference. A spirit of universal char- 
ity, of forbearance and brotherly 
love, has been characteristic of the 
speakers on this stand, and I take 
it that no better theme could be in- 
troduced, and that no better thought 
could be inspired by any other line 
of doctrine that could be taught. 

For the past few days, before the 
beginning of this our semi-annual 
conference, I have had the pleas- 
ure of being associated with the In- 
ternational Irrigation Congress, 
meeting with men who seem to be 
deeply interested in the welfare of 
these great communities of our 
western country. The Irrigation 
Congress brought to this city some 
very choice men, representatives 
from about thirty states of the 
Union, also from Canada, from Old 
Mexico, from some of the southern 
republics, and from far distant 
Japan. These gentlemen were 
unanimous in expressing their 
views in regard to the great ben- 
efits already attained, and that will 
be consummated in the future, 
through irrigation of the arid west, 
and through the reclamation ser- 
vices in which our great govern- 
ment is taking so prominent a part 
for the benefit of settlers upon the 
arid lands of this once desert coun- 
try. All of those gentlemen that I 
heard express themselves were in 
one accord in stating their sincere 
regard, and appreciation, for the 
welcome extended to them by the 
people of our beautiful city, and 
especially commending the author- 
ities of the "Mormon" church for 
the splendid reception in this great 
building, on the first day and the 
first session of the congress. 

The National Irrigation Ode, 



36 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



composed by Prof. J. J. McClellan, 
and that was rendered here by the 
excellent band of singers and mu- 
sicians accompanying ; the splendid 
performance of the choir, under 
Professor Stephens, all were re- 
garded as efforts that were very 
fine indeed, arid received from the 
members of the congress, and from 
visitors generally, high encomiums, 
and praise unstinted. I heard one 
gentleman say, who was a repre- 
sentative from California, "When I 
listened to the organ recital that 
was tendered to us by Professor 
McClellan and heard that touching 
part in the Pilgrim's Song of Hope, 
the vox humana, so like to a human 
voice, it brought tears to my eyes," 
said he ; and many more testified to 
the pleasure they had. 

Sixty-five years ago, the first 
Anglo-Saxon people introduced ir- 
rigation here on this very spot. The 
"Mormon" pioneers, under Brig- 
ham Young, our great pioneer 
President, started the scheme of 
irrigation. It was necessary before 
a plow could be made to enter the 
soil that the water be turned on to 
the ground to permeate its hard, 
encrusted surface, that had been 
undisturbed for centuries. When 
the water was thus turned on to the 
parched, arid soil, then it was pos- 
sible for the plow-share to pene- 
trate and to turn the furrow, that 
the seeds might find covering as 
they were planted. I remember 
very well hearing President Wood- 
ruff say — for he was one among 
the very first to plant seeds in the 
ground on this soil — "Why. Brother 
Young, I could have cried, and so 
my brethren felt, because we were 
planting all that we had into an un- 
tried soil, and but for our perfect 
faith in God we would have felt no 
hope to ever see products from that 
seed." The selfish thought was 



that it should not be planted, in or- 
der that if the time should come, 
that life must be preserved, they 
might be compelled to eat those 
precious grains of corn, wheat, bar- 
ley, and vegetables to preserve life. 
But, their faith was greater than 
this ; it was broad ; in fact, unlim- 
ited, because the Prophet of God 
who led them, under the same in- 
spiration that had come to the mar- 
tyred Prophet Joseph Smith, was 
prompted to say, "This is the 
place," and, when he had said that, 
the brethren planted in faith and 
the harvest came. The second year, 
in '48, when the germinating seed 
was beginning to show green stalks 
of grain above the surface, then 
came the swarm of crickets to de- 
vastate and destroy wherever they 
had access to the growing crops. 
The green fields, after they had 
passed over, appeared as if a fire 
had consumed and left its black 
mark upon every spot of ground 
visited by these devouring hosts. 
The people fought them with brush, 
and by other methods tried to sweep 
them from the land, or stay them 
in their progress, but it was an im- 
possibility ; they could not be stayed 
by the hand of man. That was the 
appearance, that was the thought, 
and that was really the experience 
of the people. Saturday night, at 
midnight, they ceased their labors 
through sheer fatigue. Sunday 
morning they assembled, fasting 
and praying for deliverance, and 
as they came from their place of 
worship the heavens were darkened 
with flocks of wild birds, and some 
asked the question, "What are these 
coming now? Are these a new 
enemy to complete the entire de- 
struction of our labors?" But when 
the sea-gulls alighted upon the 
green fields of growing crops they 
certainly began destruction, not of

the crops of the suffering, praying 
people, but they began and con- 
tinued to devour the enemy, the 
black crickets from the mountains, 
until they had swept the land clean 
from this formidable foe ; then the 
Saints knew again that God lived, 
that He had not forsaken them. 

The Saints came out from Illi- 
nois, from their City Beautiful, 
Nauvoo. They were given an al- 
ternative to deny the faith of the 
gospel which they had obeyed, and 
for which they had suffered. They 
had seen their Prophet and Patri- 
arch martyred for the cause they so 
manfully maintained. All these dis- 
tressing things were constantly be- 
fore their faces, and when the de- 
mand was made upon them, by a 
committee sent by the mob hordes 
surrounding the city of Nauvoo, 
either to give up their faith and, as 
a celebrated congressman has said 
since, "Be like us, or leave the 
country, or forfeit your lives." But 
the men to whom this address was 
made, the people who heard this 
alternative, were of the kind of 
which martyrs are made, and they 
said, "We cannot relinquish our 
faith. We know it is of God, we 
will sacrifice our homes, leave the 
lands that we have purchased and 
beautified, and seek a home where 
less hatred and opposition may ex- 
ist." I believe that President Brig- 
ham Young felt as did our old 
friend Chief Washakie, when his 
braves gathered around and said to 
him, "All of our hunting grounds 
are gone; the white man has o'er- 
spread the land and we have no 
more a place for our abode, where 
will you lead us now?" The old 
chief replied, "If I can find a spot 
so barren, so sterile that not a blade 
of grass shall grow upon it, and 
where nothing lies beneath to ex- 



cite the cupidity of the white race, 
there would I place your feet, hop- 
ing that you might not be driven 
out." Possibly such a thought en- 
tered the heart of our pioneer Pres- 
ident, Brigham Young. I have 
heard more than one of that sturdy 
band of pioneers say, "I wept ; my 
heart was full of grief when I be- 
held the land, the appearance of 
which was so forbidding, the 
ground was so sterile." I heard that 
great pioneer, Wilford Woodruff, 
say that the little part that they did 
succeed in turning over before 
water was turned upon it, was just 
as dry as ashes fresh from the fur- 
nace. 

They did not leave the city of 
Nauvoo to get away from the Con- 
stitution of the United States. They 
brought the love of the Constitu- 
tion with them, and the record that 
you have heard quoted today, is 
proof, if any other proof were 
needed — and there is plenty of just 
such all through the history of the 
pioneers of this great country — that 
they loved the Constitution, and 
that they knew and had always 
taught and accepted it as. a divine 
truth, that the Constitution was in- 
spired of God. They did not leave 
Nauvoo to get away from the flag 
of our country. They brought Old 
Glory with them, and unfurled it 
to the breeze upon this' land, then 
Mexican territory, and by that act 
took possession of the land in the 
name of our common country. They 
did not leave the land of their na- 
tivity and the land of civilization 
because they were ashamed of their 
faith, of their religion, nor did they 
relinquish the hope that God had 
planted in their hearts. No, they 
fled to this western country to be 
free from persecution and blood- 
shed. When they arrived impres-

sive services were held; the second 
day after their feet had trodden 
this arid desert, they assembled to- 
gether, and their Prophet leader 
said to them, "We will dedicate 
this soil to Almighty God for the 
gathering of Israel, for the hope 
of a peaceful home for our people 
in all time to come." He said to 
Elder Orson Pratt, "Brother Pratt, 
offer our prayer to God, and dedi- 
cate this soil to Him for Israel's 
welfare, say to Him that from all 
that He giveth to us in the times 
to come, we will give to Him our 
tithes and offerings, of all the bless- 
ings of the soil, of the herds and 
flocks, of the orchards and gardens, 
and here we will build the temple 
of our God, for the salvation of the 
living and the dead." 

The members of the National 
Irrigation Congress went away 
from here imbued with a feeling 
of gratitude. They expressed their 
praise and admiration for this peo- 
ple, for the pioneers of this country, 
for the elegant reception that was 
tendered to them, and for the use 
of these great buildings in which 
they held the sessions of their con- 
gress. They have nothing in their 
hearts today, I believe — for T think 
they were honest in their expres- 
sions — but good will for you, my 
brethren and sisters, and especially 
for the Presidency of the Church. 

I pray God to bless you, and that 
He will endow our brethren who 
lead us in the future as they have 
been endowed in the past. T testify 
to you that "Mormonism" is true. 
It is the gospel of the Lord Jesus 
Christ, as testified by one of the 
mightiest prophets that ever lived, 
who sealed that testimony with his 
own blood. Obedience to this Gos- 
pel will bring to us salvation and 
eternal life. I pray God to bless 



you all forever, in the name of 
Jesus Christ. Amen. 

A duet, "The Crucifix," was ren- 
dered by Prof. Hugh Dougal and 
Miss Mary Haigh. 

ELDER LEVI EDGAR YOUNG. 

(Of the First Council of Seventy.) 

I have been interested in the 
words of my brethren in the meet- 
ing this morning. I only regret that 
I did not hear all the words of yes- 
terday. My academic duties at the 
Uuiversity of Utah prevented my 
being in attendance at the confer- 
ence in the forenoon. 

I rejoice in seeing the people. 
As we all have our favorite themes 
and thoughts to speak about, I have 
mine, and the impressive thought 
that I have this morning is this 
fact, that no better people ever 
lived nor lives today, than the Lat- 
ter-day Saints of the Church of 
Christ. I believe in you, and- 1 am 
always grateful when I can meet 
you, my brethren and sisters, feel 
your genial and hospitable spirits 
here in the center stake of Zion, or 
wherever you live in your homes 
throughout the State. I am proud 
of you, and I am proud to know 
that I am one of you. I believe in 
the goodness of your hearts, in your 
hospitality, in your charity, in your 
love for truth, wherever you live, 
and I only wish that we here in the 
center stake of Zion, may retain in 
our hearts the same honesty and 
sincerity of purpose, and truth- 
loving character that seems to be 
so characteristic of you people who 
come from the remote parts of these 
states in the west. The rural dis- 
tricts today have a people that are 
honest. God-fearing, lovers of the 
truth, and I hope that spirit can be 



ELDER LEVI EDGAR YOUNG. 



39 



retained in those comunities ; and I 
also pray that we will get more of it 
right here in the city where we live. 

It has been pointed out briefly 
that we have had a great history. I 
believe our people have always been 
tolerant, charitable, and above all, 
constant to the principles which they 
hold to be true, and which they 
know with all their hearts. I am 
glad for all the organizations of 
this Church, for they have made 
history by their acts as well as 
their thoughts. I believe that the 
one great organization that has im- 
pressed the world with its charity 
and its bigness of activity has been 
the Relief Society, from the begin- 
ning to the present day. It was my 
privilege but a few weeks ago to 
listen to a man who had not been 
to Salt Lake City since 1856, He 
asked the question — How the Mor- 
mon Church had grown ? He wanted 
to know whether or not we hold to 
be sacred and true principles that 
we held to be sacred and true in 
1856 when he came here on a visit 
on his way to California. I an- 
swered him as best I could, but one 
thing he said that impressed me, and 
I want to say it to the sisters of the 
Relief Society. He said that he 
landed here with some emigrants. 
They were penniless, they were 
hungry, they were without shoes 
and stockings; but he never forgot 
the time when some "Mormon" wo- 
men came into camp, gave them 
stockings, brought them bacon and 
flour, and fehey did it because, said 
they, "Our prophet leader tells us 
to, and not only he told it, but 
greater still, we have the Spirit of 
God that dictates to us, and it says 
that no one must starve or be in 
need where there is plenty, and 
where we have the chance to give, 
and to live and let live." This 



man said that these woman were 
members of a society organized 
for charitable purposes. It was 
the Relief Society of one of the 
wards of Salt Lake City, which 
as early as 1850 was doing chari- 
table acts and helping humanity in 
its need. I am grateful today for 
such an organization, and I am 
proud of it, for I think you have 
done great deeds, and manifested 
your faith in God by your acts. 

What we need today, my brethren 
and sisters, more than anything else, 
is honesty and integrity to the Gos- 
pel of Jesus Christ. We can't get 
too much faith in our hearts. Faith, 
after all, is the moving force in the 
history of the world, and is today, 
and always will be ; and I hold that 
faith in God, the Eternal Father, 
and in His Son Jesus Christ, must 
become the greatest moving force 
for humanity. It will be in the fu- 
ture, for I believe that the world is 
coming back, after all, to a belief in 
God the Eternal Father. In our 
schools, in all of our institutions of 
learning, there can't be too much 
of the teaching that God lives, and 
is the directive force and power be- 
hind the onward march of the hu- 
man race. 

Not long ago some prominent ed- 
ucators in the United States came 
together in a meeting, and the ques- 
tion was asked : "What can we do 
that will bring the children of our 
schools to a higher standard of 
thought and action?" The ques- 
tion was answered in many, many 
ways. One brother of this city was 
asked the question, and the answer 
was that there are many practical 
ways but he believed that if in every 
school room throughout the world 
there could be on the right in gold 
letters the Ten Commandments, and 
on the left the Preamble of the Con- 



40 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



stitution of the United States, and 
on the front the words, "I believe 
in God the Eternal Father, and in 
His Son Jesus Christ," he believed 
that the students and scholars of 
this country would receive an in- 
spiration and a power in their work 
that would lift the standard of 
American life and American schol- 
arship. So this is the thought I 
want to leave with you today. May 
I ask you to receive it and think 
about it. I know that we can get 
your support for it. 

There are today nineteen million 
students in the schools of the United 
States. This includes the university 
students, down to those of the kin- 
dergarten department ; nineteen 
million students whom we hold to 
be educated, whom we hope to see 
go out into life as real citizens, true 
citzens of this republic and believers 
in God. The question comes up 
whether or not we are performing 
our duties as we should perform 
them. Being in the academic world 
I see on every hand great blunders, 
great mistakes made in the name 
of education. You see them in your 
homes, you see these blunders in the 
schools, but I believe that the glory 
of this country and the glory of this 
state, just the same, is the public 
school system, which is destined to 
grow and grow until men and 
women are truly educated. But I 
say that the one thing that will lift 
us up educationally and morally to 
higher standards in a general way 
throughout all this land, will be to 
teach our children the majesty, the 
greatness, the divinity, and the 
power of the Ten .Commandments, 
and the beauty, the justice and the 
grandeur and the greatness of the 
Preamble of the Constitution of the 
United States, together with the be- 
lief in God, and Jesus Christ as the 



Redeemer of the world. These three 
things I think are needed in our 
American schools. They are needed 
by men, women and children. We 
have never yet learned to live up to 
the Ten Commandments, and polit- 
ically the Constitution of the United 
States is so far ahead of us that it 
will take ages to see its greatness 
and its power prevail. And so what 
has this to do with us, as followers 
of the Lord and the Redeemer of 
the world and the Christian faith? 
Only this, that as the great tenor 
and standard of morality are raised, 
our dreams are made higher, our 
ideals become greater ; and people 
can only become great as they have 
great ideals to which they work. 

My brethren and sisters,to me the 
glory of "Mormonism" lies in this 
fact, that there is never a thing sug- 
gested for the uplift of humanity 
but what we are behind it with all 
our souls, and with all of our works 
as well. We believe that the hu- 
man race will be redeemed if the 
human race will accept the law of 
the Gospel ; and obedience to law 
is liberty. Let us remember that 
obedience to political law, to relig- 
ious law, to social law, becomes our 
truest liberty after all, and when we 
learn to become liberty-loving we 
will be law-abiding, and when we 
are law-abiding we will be devel- 
oped individually and socially, and 
become lights unto the world as 
holders of the Priesthood of God. 
"Mormonism" is the greatest move- 
ment in the history of the race. It 
stands today for the greatest intel- 
lectual moral and social uplift and 
political uplift that the race has to- 
day. It stands for everything good, 
everything noble. It stands, how- 
ever, upon the principle of faith in 
God, the Eternal Father, and in His 
Son Jesus Christ ; and let us as

Latter-day Saints hold this sacredly 
in our hearts. Whatever we do, 
and think, there is always that truth 
within us that God is God, and that 
Jesus is the Christ, now and forever. 
We must, therefore, learn true char- 
ity, true love. We must learn to 
work and to pray, and not give up 
our simplicity of life. The other 
day I was asked what our institu- 
tions, human society, need more 
than anything else. My reply was 
that we need more of the faith, hon- 
esty, and sincerity of our fathers 
and mothers, more than we need 
anything else. We want to hark 
back to the honesty and the sim- 
plicity of what some call the com- 
mon people. We need to get rid 
of the love for gold and show, and 
come back with all our souls to the 
knowledge that this gospel is true, 
and that we must be true to it. Then 
our standard of living will be raised, 
we will be united. W e will act more 
as God wants us to act. We will 
live nearer to the Savior as He 
taught the race to live, and as He 
teaches us today. I hope we may 
be united in the faith, in the law, 
and in tke knowledge of what is 
right and true ; and I hope the 
day may come when in every school- 
room throughout this land, at least 
whenever we come into that school- 
room, there shall be placed in gold 
letters first, "I believe in God the 
Eternal Father and in His Son 
Jesus Christ," on the right the Ten 
Commandments, the greatest moral 
law of the human race ; and on the 
left the Preamble of the greatest 
document ever given to the world, 
for the government of nations, the 
Preamble of the Constitution of the 
United States. When we do this 
we will raise our standard of 
thought, our standard of living, and 
we will approach what the Prophet 



Joseph Smith once said we must do, 
the higher soul, the higher life that 
naturally lies within. 

That God may help us to see 
these things one and all, and to 
work for great truths and live 
humbly and to work with a hunger 
for truth and light, I ask it in the 
name of Jesus. Amen. 

PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 

Divine guidance needed in all human 
affairs. 

If my brethren and sisters will in- 
dulge me just a moment I have this 
to say with reference to the dis- 
courses we have heard this morn- 
ing: I believe in all that has been 
said, and I also believe a little 
farther than that which has been 
said. I would like just for a mo- 
ment to try to express briefly and, 
very likely, very imperfectly the 
thought that has occurred to me in 
relation to one point especially that 
has been referred to. 

I think that in the realms of lib- 
erty, and the exercise of human 
judgment, all men should exercise 
extreme caution, that they do not 
change or abolish those things 
which God has willed and has in- 
spired to be done. It has been in 
this realm of freedom, and the ex- 
ercise of human judgment, that most 
of the evils that have occurred in 
the world have been done — the mar- 
tyrdom of saints, the crucifixion of 
the Son of God Himself, and much 
of the apostasy and departure from 
the work of righteousness, and from 
the laws of God, have occurred in 
this realm of freedom and the ex- 
ercise of human judgment. God in 
His boundless wisdom and gracious 
mercy has provided means, and has 
shown the way to the children of 
men whereby, even in the realms of 



42 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



freedom and the exercise of their 
own judgment, they may individ- 
ually go unto God in faith and 
prayer, and find out what should 
guide and direct their human judg- 
ment and wisdom ; and I do not 
want the Latter-day Saints to for- 
get that this is their privilege. I 
would rather that they should seek 
God for a counselor and guide, than 
to follow the wild harangues of 
political leaders, or leaders of any 
other cult. I felt like I ought to 
say that much ; and I know that I 
am right. 

The congregation sang the hymn : 

There is beauty all around, 
When there's love at home. 

There is joy in every sound, 
When there's love at home, 

Peace and plenty there abide, 

Smiling sweet on every side. 

Time doth softly, sweetly flide, 
When there's love at home 

Benediction was pronounced by 
Elder Samuel O. Bennion. 

Conference adjourned until 2 
p. m. 



AFTERNOON SESSION. 

Conference was resumed at 2 
p. m., President Joseph F. Smith 
presiding. 
The congregation sang the hymn : 

We thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet 
To guide us in these latter days; 

We thank Thee for sending the gospel 
To lighten our minds with its rays. 

Prayer was offered by Elder Rey 
L. Pratt. 
The congregation sang the hymn : 

For the strength of the hills we bless 
Thee, 

Our God, our fathers' God; 
Thou hast made Thy children mighty, 
By the touch of the mountain sod. 



PRESIDENT FRANCIS M. LYMAN. 

The Holy Spirit a spiritual and temporal 
guide. — All can, and should be contin- 
uously doing good.— Splendid accom- 
plishments of "Mormons" in Mexico. — 
A plea for fraternal assistance to refu- 
gees from Mexico. 

I am very greatly pleased, my 
brethren and sisters, with this op- 
portunity of meeting with the Saints 
in conference, and trust that the 
same good spirit that has attended 
the brethren who have spoken to us 
may be enjoyed during this meeting. 

The work of the Lord is very re- 
markable among the peoples of the 
earth. It is attracting attention 
from every direction, and the doc- 
trines that we have embraced, which 
have been revealed through the 
Prophet Joseph, attract the consid- 
eration of many people throughout 
the earth. These doctrines are true, 
and it is the trutn that gives 
strength to this work. Their truth 
is discovered by many who have 
hardly the courage to embrace the 
principles, and to undertake to live 
them. Some people I have known 
feel that the truths we proclaim are 
too good to be true, and remark 
that they proffer too .much, and 
offer more than is reasonable for 
mortal men to anticipate and expect 
in this world, or the world to come. 
But, all who embrace the Gospel, 
with full purpose of heart, obtain a 
testimony of the truth of the doc- 
trines. They obtain a witness also 
from the Lord Himself, a witness 
of the Father and of the Son, and 
the record is borne in the hearts of 
the children of men by the inspira- 
tion of the Holy Ghost. That Spirit 
has the mission not only to bear 
record of the Father and the Son, 
and the truth and divinity of the 
doctrines that we have embraced,, 
but He will abide with us, not only 
in spiritual matters — matters per- 



PRESIDENT FRANCIS M. LYMAN. 43 



taming to the church — but in regard 
to all things, for the truth of all 
things, temporal and spiritual, 
is known by the Holy Ghost. 
Those who enter into covenant 
with the Lord, having hum- 
bled themselves before Him and 
repented of their sins, as a 
result of their faith, and have 
taken upon them the name of Jesus 
Christ, and have undertaken to 
serve Him to the end, having re- 
pented of all their sins, they receive 
that witness and testimony, and that 
Spirit abides with them always 
through their faithfulness. It gives 
them stability of character ; it gives 
them understanding and light that 
is not possessed otherwise, and that 
does not remain with Latter-day 
Saints unless they continue to be 
faithful and very humble, meek and 
lowly of heart. The Spirit of the 
Lord is easily offended, easily 
grieved, and it is quite an under- 
taking for men to so live that that 
Spirit can always be a fountain of 
inspiration, of revelation and light 
to them. It is a difficult thing for 
men to do good always, and I want 
to show you, my brethren and sis- 
ters, that the Lord expects us to 
do so. 

Now, I do not want to take too 
much time, I do not want to lay too 
broad a foundation, but I will read 
one , little text. I think I shall be 
satisfied with this one small text, if 
I can expound it to your under- 
standing, which I believe I can with 
the help of the Lord, and possibly 
bring to your understanding an im- 
provement that we may engage in 
for the future, possibly having lived 
something near it in the past, but 
may do so more perfectly in the 
future. The Lord says : 

"Verily I say men" — that is all 
men ; I desire to expound to you 



that word in this scripture, that 
men, all men, Latter-day Saints and 
everybody else — "should be anx- 
iously engaged in a good cause, and 
do many things of their own free 
will, and bring to pass much right- 
eousness, for the power is in them" 
— the power is in all men — "where- 
in they are agents unto themselves ; 
and inasmuch as men do good they 
shall in no wise lose their reward." 

Now, I desire to make this im- 
pression, my brethren and sisters, 
for men, the term, the word, in- 
cludes the sisters as well as the 
brethren — all mankind, men and 
women — should be anxiously en- 
gaged in a good cause, because they 
are agents unto themselves and are 
so empowered by the Lord, who is 
our Father, so that we should be 
thus occupied always. We should 
not be employed at any time, on any 
occasion, anywhere, doing anything 
that is not a good cause. Where we 
have done things that were not 
proper and right, and were not a 
good cause, we have departed from 
the obligation and undertaking that 
we entered into in the beginning, 
and our beginning was when we 
entered into covenant with the Lord. 
I am speaking now of our begin- 
ning with this latter-day work. This 
Church began on the 6th of April, 
1830, and you began when you en- 
tered into covenant with the Lord. 
Your end will be when you have 
laid off this mortal body, when your 
work has been finished and your 
undertaking with the Lord has been 
completed. We undertook at the 
beginning to serve the Lord to the 
end, to the end of our mortal mis- 
sion, our probation, hence I desire 
to make this impression upon all 
Latter-day Saints ; and if there 
should be some here who are not 
Latter-day Saints I would like to 



44 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



make the impression upon them also 
that they, too, should be anxiously 
engaged in a good cause, and bring 
to pass much righteousness. That 
is being done today in the world by 
very many people, for much right- 
eousness is accomplished by people 
who are not of our faith. A great 
deal of good is being done ; there is 
a great deal of virtue and morality, 
uprightness and humility, love of 
the Lord, love of the truth, love of 
righteousness, in the hearts of the 
children of men. So that my appeal 
is not to Latter-day Saints alone 
this afternoon, but to all men and 
all women. If any man or any 
woman does good in this world, 
they shall not lose their reward, 
whether they be Latter-day Saints 
or not. But, if they would have all 
the good, all that the Lord has to 
bestow upon them, it is necessary 
for them to have faith in Him, re- 
pent of their sins, humble them- 
selves before God and enter into 
covenant with Him, as the Latter- 
day Saints have done, and then en- 
dure in the faith to the end of their 
lives. It is possible in this world, 
I take it from the example and his- 
tory of our elder brother, Jesus, it 
is possible for men to do good; I 
believe it is quite possible for all 
men to do good, to work righteous- 
ness. I believe that it is quite possi- 
ble for all men to repent of their 
sins, through faith. The Lord is 
generous and willing to bestow 
upon all men the principle of faith, 
and by their repentance, turning 
from sin and working righteous- 
ness, it is quite possible for them 
to get into fellowship with the Lord. 
It is really possible for men to do 
what is right, and to be perfect as 
God Himself is perfect. 

In the range of thought, in look- 
ing over my own experience, and 



the opportunities about me in the 
field of activity in this world, I have 
wondered what on earth there is 
that a man cannot do that is right, 
and that ought to be done, so far as 
morality and purity and righteous- 
ness is concerned. There may be 
heights that men may not easily 
reach, there may be works that are 
difficult to accomplish, but so far as 
being perfect in our lives in the ser- 
vice of the Lord, .in serving our 
brethren, working for them and 
blessing them, and doing good to 
others as we would that others 
should do to us, is there anything 
that we cannot do ? Can we not be 
sober? Can we not be honest, moral 
and upright? Can we not work 
righteousness and deal justly? I can 
think of nothing of this sort but 
what is possible for us to do. I 
can't think of a wrong that I ever 
did in my life, nor a wrong that 
you have ever done, that I have 
known about, but what we could 
just as well, and better, have done 
what was right. It has always been 
so with me, I could have done bet- 
ter. It was always easier for me 
to do right than to do wrong. The 
things that have tried me, and have 
been difficult for me, are the wrongs 
I have done ; but where I have done 
right I have felt well paid, well re- 
warded, it has made me feel com- 
fortable and happy, it has made me 
free. I have always felt free and 
comfortable when I have done right, 
and always felt uncomfortable, un- 
happy and a slave when I have done 
wrong. Hence I have concluded 
not to do wrong any more. I am 
not going to wrong anybody ; and I 
don't want to wrong myself, but 
just do exactly what is right, and I 
want my brethren and sisters, the 
Latter-day Saints, so to do. 

The Lord has given us a perfect 



PRESIDENT FRANCIS M. LYMAN. 



45 



organization, commencing with the 
Aaronic Priesthood as it was re- 
vealed to us in this day, and divid- 
ing the labors that they have to per- 
form, from the deacon to the priest ; 
and in the Melchisedek Priesthood, 
from the office of the elder to the 
chiefest among us, those who have 
the greatest power and authority 
upon the earth. The Lord has so 
designed and arranged that all men 
embracing the gospel may receive 
divine authority from Him, and 
power that will aid tnem and help 
them far above what men can nat- 
urally do. The natural man is a 
very unsafe quantity, he must be 
assisted by the Lord. I don't know 
of anything that a man can do that 
will be quite pleasing and satisfac- 
tory, unless the Lord helps him, and 
then he can be perfectly safe. There 
are many things that men need to be 
enlightened upon, and the Spirit of 
the Lord occupies the whole field, 
and will enlighten our minds and 
enable us to see alike in all mat- 
ters, and make us one with the 
Father and the Son. That Spirit 
should dwell richly in our hearts ; 
when it does, and abides with us, 
it will draw us together, unite us, 
enlighten us, and strengthen -us in 
the performance of the duties that 
devolve upon us, our lives will then 
be successful, and we will be anx- 
iously occupied and engaged in 
works of righteousness. A man 
with the Spirit of the Lord is not 
offensive, he is not offensive in his 
home and family, or neighborhood, 
he is a pleasant and agreeable com- 
panion, as a father, as a brother, as 
a husband, and as a neighbor, if he 
enjoys the Spirit of the Lord. The 
Spirit of the Lord should be en- 
joyed by all men; and when men 
possess that Spirit their difficulties 
disappear ; they see the right. The 



Spirit of the Lord always prompts 
us to do our full duty, all that is 
required of us, and to be willing to 
make some little sacrifice in order 
to be at peace. It will enable us to 
endure wrong if it comes upon us, 
and submit so far as we need and 
have occasion to ; to endure but 
never do wrong, never to wrong 
any one else ; if needs be to suffer 
wrong and evil at the hand of 
others, but always do what is right 
ourselves. 

I want, at the closing of my re- 
marks, to draw attention to the con- 
ditions that have been spoken of 
here in this conference, first by the 
President, and then referred to by 
others. I want to state my views, 
briefly, in regard to our refugee 
brethren and sisters from Mexico. 
They are not a numerous people, 
possibly only four thousand. Of 
course four thousand people is quite 
a community, would be considered 
a large ward. If we have four 
thousand in a ward it is regarded 
as quite a little town ; but four 
thousand are not very many of the 
people that are garnered together 
of the Latter-day Saints — maybe 
half a million of us — the four thou- 
sand would be but few. We have 
lots of land and water, and any 
amount of climate. It happens just 
now that we are living in pretty 
fruitful times, and we are well fixed 
with good crops, grains and fruit 
crops, everything of the kind. I 
judge so when I see the fruit cover- 
ing the ground, and we cannot take 
proper care of it, to make good, 
profitable use of it. So I want to 
sound this note of advice to my 
brethren and sisters who are not 
refugees, who are at home and live 
in the United States, in Arizona, 
New Mexico, California, Nevada, 
Colorado, Utah, and Wyoming. It 



46 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



is our friends, and neighbors, our 
brothers and sisters that are down 
there, and who have been driven 
from the republic of Mexico. They 
have not been able to remain there. 
It seems they were not wanted 
there. I happened to be among the 
first of the brethren who went as 
missionaries into that country, to 
pioneer the country- I went with 
President Taylor, President Joseph 
F. Smith and others of the brethren ; 
quite a company of us went from 
here into Mexico in about 1885, as 
I remember. I went three times 
that year from Salt Lake City to 
the City of Mexico, and into the hot 
country beyond. I spent some time 
there with Erastus Snow, Brigham 
Young, Jr., John W. Taylor, Moses 
Thatcher, and others of the breth- 
ren. We visited the president of the 
republic, and we were made wel- 
come by him and by his ministers, 
and we learned to respect those 
leading men of that republic. They 
offered me soldiers when I went 
down to pioneer the country, for 
that was my purpose, on my second 
trip into Mexico. The Indian Chief 
Geronimo and his men were raiding 
that country, and raiding Arizona, 
and our soldiers were there as well 
as the Mexican soldiers, trying to 
capture the outlaw and his band. 
While we were there the Indians 
went down on the west of us, and 
on the south, and came out on the 
east of us, went almost round us, 
but we were out of sight ; they did 
not happen to see us when we were 
pioneering the country. We had 
a little company of soldiers offered 
ns, but Mexican soldiers do not go 
until tomorrow, the} never go till 
"manana," that is, they do not go 
today but tomorrow, and we went 
today, and the soldiers following us 
could not find us. They thought 



we would make tracks, and so we 
did, but a tremendous storm of rain 
came and obliterated the tracks, and 
they could not find us. We thus 
pioneered the country. 

I want to say that when we say 
hard things about the people of that 
country we only say it about those 
who are a hard people, a bad peo- 
ple, not about those who are good. 
They have not had in Mexico, so 
far as I have known, a secure and 
stable government. There has not 
been protection and safety in that 
country, and a man always had to 
have a gun across his lap, or hang- 
ing on his back, so that it could be 
seen that he was armed, in order to 
take care of himself. I was given to 
understand, in the City of Mexico, 
that it was not safe for a man to 
walk across that valley, from one 
town or village to another, unless 
he was armed; that he would likely 
be killed by some one to get his suit 
of clothes, or a pair of boots, or the 
dollar in his pocket, if he had it. 
There were that class of people ; but 
we were made welcome, they wan- 
ted us there. They wanted us be- 
cause our people were thrifty, and 
prosperous, because we would build 
good brick houses, and good school 
buildings, and establish merchandise 
business and so forth in the coun- 
try. Our people went there, and 
they built the finest villages, so far 
as I can judge and know, in Mexico, 
the finest considering the popula- 
tion occupying them, that can be 
found in the republic. I rather 
think that is correct, they really 
have built splendid houses, cities, 
and towns, and have conducted our 
district schools and high schools • 
there also. We have taken care of 
ourselves, and have set a good ex- 
ample, and the leading men of that 
nation were always proud of what 



PRESIDENT FRANCIS M. LYMAN. 



47 



the "Mormons" had done there. 
President Diaz, as long as he stayed 
there, and his ministers, always 
spoke well of the "Mormon" people, 
they could not say otherwise. But 
there was a man killed every little 
; while. It was dangerous, always 
more or less dangerous, and they 
could not be protected, they could 
not get justice, and the wicked 
could not be punished, as a rule they 
were not punished. 

Well, now our people have come 
away, they have been driven away 
because of the revolution in that 
country. It is a revolutionary coun- 
try and a revolutionary people, and 
there is no telling, of course, as we 
learned from the President here, 
when peace will be declared and a 
good government established. I 
don't know when it will come, but 
I do want us, brethren and sisters, 
to open our hearts and homes, and 
open the way for the Latter-day 
Saints to come back to their friends, 
to come to their neighbors and kin- 
dred, they will be no tax on the 
people of this country. Those four 
thousand people can stay right here 
with us, and it will hardly be known 
that there is anybody extra. We 
have plenty of room, and everything 
to make them comfortable. They 
are a people that will make their 
way and pay as they go, and earn 
their living and establish them- 
selves, and in a few years they will 
be just as wealthy as they were in 
Mexico, and they will be upon safe, 
solid ground, where they need not 
be afraid of anything on earth, no 
more than we are in Canada. I saw 
the contrast. I was down in Mexico 
in '85, and just a little later it fell to 
my lot to go to Canada to help the 
pioneers and give them counsel — 
Elder John W. Taylor and I. We 
went to the head of the Canadian 



government, and we were welcomed 
there. They wanted us, they were 
glad to have us come, and we have 
been building there just as we built 
in Mexico, and just as we have 
built in Utah, in Arizona, in Ne- 
vada, Colorado and Idaho. 

Everywhere the Latter - day 
Saints go they are doing work that 
speaks well for them, and is a credit 
to them. They are a stable element 
— not quite perfect yet, but they are 
devoted to good works, and the 
Spirit of .the Lord that dwells in 
them makes them worthy citizens 
of any country and government. 
The government of any state or 
county is stronger for the "Mor- 
mon" people that .locate therein, 
or in any city or nation, for it has 
been proven that they are a good 
element. The Spirit of the Lord 
has made them this, and that Spirit 
will make them even more worthy 
than what they are now if they will 
continue faithful. I advise that we 
should invite our friends home, ask 
them to come home and take some 
of our land and work with us. 
Many of them come unclothed al- 
most, and unfed. They have been 
robbed, and have nothing to bring 
with them, as a rule. There are 
some few that will be able to fight 
their own way and take care of 
themselves, but the others will be 
no burden upon us, we will be rich- 
er from taking care of them, help- 
ing them, for the Lord will com- 
pensate us for doing the good that 
we should be engaged in. He will 
reward us, for He says that we shall 
not lose our rewaid for any good 
thing that we do. We want to wel- 
come home our brethren and sisters 
who have suffered, we want them to 
come back again into the United 
States, if they so desire. If they 
prefer to stay and try their chances 



48 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



again in Mexico, of course we make 
no objection, and our blessing and 
love will go with them where they 
go, and with the people who will 
open their hearts and homes to re- 
ceive them and make them welcome. 

I wanted to say that much in re- 
gard to those people, for I was there 
in the country; I was with them 
when they were in their camps and 
tents. I was with them there and 
wrestled for their benefit with the 
government of the country. The 
Church has helped them attain what 
they could; that land was legally 
obtained for permanent settlement, 
and we have done our duty in the 
republic of Mexico. We have been 
preaching the gospel there also, and 
maintaining missions among them. 
We have been doing a good work 
for that republic, and we have not 
hurt them at all, but have done them 
a great deal of good; and that was 
the desire, I am sure, of the leading 
men of their nation. The Lord will 
bless those who have befriended our 
people and those who do befriend 
them hereafter. The Lord will bless 
us my brethren and sisters, in being 
anxiously engaged in this good 
cause. The Latter-day Saints who 
do not return to Mexico shall not 
feel that they are imposing on their 
kindred and friends, but that the 
latch string is out, or the door is 
open, and they are welcome to come 
and fare and share, with us until 
they can get on their feet,and it will 
not be a long time for them to do it. 
They are the right kind of element. 

I pray the Lord to bless you, my 
brethren and sisters. Let us re- 
member the injunction of this text 
and be constantly, anxiously and 
earnestly engaged in a good cause, 
and bring to pass much righteous- 
ness every day of our lives, and the 
Lord will bless and sustain us, and 



preserve and redeem us, and make 
us eminently successful among the 
children of men. God bless you, 
my brethren and sisters, and keep 
us faithful, and help us to endure 
in His service while we live in the 
flesh, I pray in the name of Jesus 
Christ, Amen. 

ELDER HEBER J. GRANT. 

Diligence in preaching the Gospel in- 
creases faith of the preachers. — Unison 
in proclaiming Gospel truths. — The 
true Latter-day Saint an exemplar of 
every virtue. — Cheerful giving of time 
and means to God's work. 

I am happy in having the oppor- 
tunity of again meeting with the 
Latter-day Saints in general con- 
ference. I have thoroughly enjoyed 
my labors during the past six 
months in traveling among the dif- 
ferent stakes of Zion, and in visit- 
ing two of the missions in the east. 
I rejoice in finding the Latter-day 
Saints, who are faithful and diligent 
in serving the Lord, growing in the 
light and knowledge of the gospel, 
growing in a love of the truth and 
in a determination to do all in their 
power for the spread of the gospel 
at home and abroad. I am very 
happy in contemplating the fact that 
the gospel of Jesus Christ brings 
peace, joy and happiness to every 
soul who embraces it, and who lives 
it. I rejoice in the fact that the 
more we do in the gospel of Jesus 
Christ, the more we love the truth, 
the stronger is our faith, the more 
perfect and absolute is our testi- 
mony regarding the divinity of this 
work. 

To me one of the greatest of all 
the great testimonies of the divinity 
of the work in which we are en- 
gaged is the fact that all those who 



ELDER HEBER J. GRANT.

go out to proclam it, and who live 
virtuous and upright lives, return to 
us with a burning testimony of this 
work, and bear witness to those at 
home that the most profitable and 
the happiest time of their lives has 
been while they have been proclaim- 
ing the truth. The Spirit of the 
Lord accompanies the elders. God 
blesses those who go forth to preach 
this gospel. If this gospel were not 
the truth, honest, prayerful, dili- 
gent, humble men would discover 
that fact, but I have yet to hear of 
one man in all the eighty odd years 
that this gospel has been preached, 
who has gone forth to proclaim it 
and who has been a diligent, faith- 
ful man, who has returned and an- 
nounced that he has discovered that 
they have the gospel of Christ in 
some other land or some other 
clime. But I have heard of thou- 
sands who have studied other gos- 
pels, tens of thousands ; I have 
known man}' who have been mem- 
bers of many different denomina- 
tions, who never found peace and 
joy and perfect contentment until 
they embraced the gospel of Jesus 
Christ. It is a very difficult thing 
to undertake to tell a lie and to 
maintain it. A writer in a book en- 
titled "The Power of Truth" says 
that lies are fearsome things, and 
that thev have to travel in bat- 
talions, that they are like a lot of 
drunken men, one holding up the 
other. But, he says, truth can stand 
alone, it needs no chaperone; and 
this is true. 

This gospel of Jesus Christ has 
been taught during the past eighty 
odd years, and all of those who have 
gone forth to proclaim it have 
taught the one and the same gospel. 
There has been no schism, there has 
been no disagreement. There has 
been nothing but an increase of 



faith and a love of the truth that 
has come to those who have gone 
forth in humility to spread this gos- 
pel of Jesus Christ. It is in very 
deed the power of God unto salva- 
tion, and the people know it, and 
the people love the truth. Wher- 
ever I go among them, whenever 
the Lord blesses me with liberty to 
preach this gospel to the people, I 
can see in their countenances that 
they rejoice in the witness of the 
Spirit ; that they drink in the words 
that are given to them; and after 
meetings, and people shake hands 
with you, you feel that there is a 
determination in their hearts to 
serve God and keep His command- 
ments. 

The Latter-day Saints do in very 
deed thank God for a prophet to 
guide them in these latter days. The 
Latter-day Saints do enjoy singing 
the song by Brother John Jaques, 
"O Say What Is Truth?" They re- 
joice in this gospel and all the 
teachings of it in the scriptures and 
in the inspired hymns that we have 
received. I rejoice in it beyond my 
power to tell. I enjoy mingling 
among the Latter-day Saints. I en- 
joy visiting the households of the 
Latter-day Saints and conversing 
with them, and I want to bear my 
testimony, in connection with that 
of the others whicli have been 
borne, that there are no better peo- 
ple in any land or in any clime. 
There are no more honest people 
than the Latter-day Saints. The 
business integrity of every true Lat- 
ter-day Saint is perfect. No man 
who is a Latter-day Saint but what 
is living a virtuous, upright, honest 
and a true life. No matter what 
may be said against an individual, 
it has no effect upon tnat individual 
if it is false, and no man can say 
that any man who lives up to the 



50 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



teachings of the gospel of Jesus 
Christ, but what that man is a good 
citizen, that he is a good man, that 
he desires the welfare of his fellow 
men, and that his example is above 
reproach. 

I believe that the Latter-day 
Saints are endeavoring to live up to 
the teachings of the Savior. I be- 
lieve that they follow more perfectly 
the admonitions of the Savior in 
His sermon upon the mount than 
any other people. I believe that 
there is a living, vital force among 
the people which cannot be found 
elsewhere. I not only believe this, 
but I know it. Where are there any 
other people who make the same 
sacrifices, that is, sacrifices in the 
eyes of the world? You and I can- 
not make any sacrifice for this gos- 
pel. Life eternal is the greatest of 
all of the gifts of God to man, there- 
fore there is no labor that can be 
required of us whereby we can gain 
this greatest of all God's blessings, 
that can be called a sacrifice. It is a 
privilege for us to learn the lessons 
that devolve upon us. I thank God 
for the privilege of paying tithing. 
I rejoice in having the opportunity 
of showing my gratitude to my 
Heavenly Father for His mercies to 
me. I thank the Lord for the op- 
portunity of contributing of the 
means that come to me for the erec- 
tion of meeting-houses, of school- 
houses, of temples, and for the op- 
portunity of going forth to proclaim 
this gospel. 

I have been suffering for several 
days with a slight cold, and I find 
that I am rasping my throat. I have 
pitched my voice a little bit too 
high, therefore I will close my re- 
marks, by praying God to bless you. 
T know that God lives. I know that 
Jesus is the Christ. I know that 
Joseph Smith is a prophet of the 



true and the living God, and that 
we have the truth ; and I know that 
Joseph F. Smith is the prophet of 
God, and that the inspiration of God 
guides him. May the Latter-day 
Saints be loyal and true, I ask it in 
the name of Jesus. Amen. .

ELDER EEED SM00T. 

Great influence of music in religious and 
secular affairs. — Remarkable effects of 
the hymn, "O, My Father." — Advice to 
shun all get-rich-quick propositions. — 
Smokers, drinkers, and immoral men 
unfit for responsible positions. 

In a revelation given through the 
Prophet. Joseph Smith in July, 1830, 
the Lord, in speaking to Joseph's 
wife, Emma, said : "For my soul 
delighteth in the song of the heart ; 
yea, the song of the righteous is a 
prayer unto me, and it shall be an- 
swered with a blessing upon their 
heads." 

I could not help but think of this 
part of the revelation in listening to 
the beautiful hymns that have been 
sung during this conference. I be- 
lieve that we can worship in song 
as acceptably to Him as in any 
other way. In reading the history 
of the world we find that music has 
been conspicuous, in all ages and 
among all nations. There are but 
few religious 'denominations that 
do not avail themselves of the sweet 
influence of music. It is not only a 
custom to worship God by singing 
His praises in song, but we find the 
power of music manifest in almost 
all the great affairs in life. It is 
made use of to encourage and in- 
spire men in battle. It is depended 
upon on occasions when there is 



ELDER REED SMOOT. 1 51 



necessity for inspiring in the hearts 
of men enthusiasm or loyalty. The 
history of nations is, in part, told 
in song. I know of no people on 
earth who have written into their 
songs the principles of the gospel 
they believe in more than have the 
Latter-day Saints. It is true there 
are many beautiful hymns written 
by men that all Christians love to 
sing, and we sing them in devotion 
to our Maker. We often sing the 
hymn composed by Charles Wesley 
entitled, "Jesus Lover of My Soul." 
It is said that Charles Wesley was 
inspired to write this greatest of his 
hymns by a bird, frightened by a 
thunder storm, flying into his room, 
preferring to risk its life indoors 
with him than outside where the 
elements were disturbed. As it sat 
quivering on his mantel, frightened 
nearly to death, Wesley was in- 
spired to write that hymn. Henry 
Ward Beecher, speaking at his 
father's funeral, referred to the 
hymn that had been composed by 
Charles Wesley, "Jesus Lover of 
My Soul," and made the statement 
that he would rather have been the 
author of that song than to have 
the wealth of the greatest million- 
aire, for in it was inspiration, in it 
was power. While wealth would 
perish and its possessor be forgot- 
ten, the memory of Wesley would 
live for ages to come, because the 
words of the song would be per- 
petuated. The opening hymn of 
this conference, 

"Come, come, ye Saints, no toil nor 

labor fear, 
But with joy wend your way. 
Though hard to you this journey may 

appear, 

Grace shall be as your day," 

is filled with inspiration. Brother 
William Clayton, the author of this 
song, was inspired to write it, at a 



time when the people were crossing 
the plains, careworn, disheartened 
and in need of encouragement. 
President Young realized their con- 
dition and knew that music would 
inspire them to renewed energy. He 
therefore asked William Clayton to 
write a hymn suitable to the con- 
ditions, and the result was the 
hymn, "Come, come, ye Saints." It 
was inspired by God, and it has 
been an inspiration to God's people 
ever since. 

I believe that Sister Snow, when 
she composed that immortalized 
song, "O my Father, Thou that 
dwellest in the high and glorious 
place," was inspired of God the 
Eternal Father. The idea that we 
had a Mother, as well as a Father, 
in Heaven was first taught in this 
dispensation by the Prophet Joseph 
Smith. Sister Snow was convinced 
that he was right in so teaching, 
and embodied that principle of the 
Gospel in the song. I believe that 
hymn, "O My Father," has been the 
means of causing thousands of the 
people of the world to investigate 
"Mormonism." When I heard our 
choir sing it in the Capital of this 
nation I noticed many a wet 'eye. 
It seemd to me that it had the effect 
of a testimony to the people pres- 
ent ; it certainly was listened to in 
song more intently than it would 
have been by word of mouth. 

The closing song of the first day's 
session of this conference, the hymn 
that President Woodruff loved so 
well, 

"God moves in a mysterious way, 

His wonders to perform, 
He plants his footsteps in the sea 

And rides upon the storm," 

will live forever. It is said that 
Cowper, the author, was inspired to 
write it after he had made up his 



52 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



mind that life was not worth living. 
The story is that he called a London 
cabby and asked him to drive to 
London Bridge, with the avowed 
purpose of throwing himself in the 
Thames river and ending his life. It 
is reported that the cabby, driving 
around the city, landed at last be- 
fore the door of the house where 
he took the poet from. Cowper got 
out of the cab and went to the room 
which he had left a short time be- 
fore for the purpose of ending his 
life. While contemplating the cir- 
cumstance, the inspiration came to 
him and he wrote the song, "God 
moves in a mysterious way." 

There is one thing known to the 
people of all countries, whether they 
approve of our religion or not, that 
is the remarkable musical ability of 
the "Mormon" people. People, in 
general, appreciate the songs our 
missionaries sing, and the spirit 
with which they are sung. I have 
met many men in my travels, and 
in conversation some have said, 
"Yes, I remember hearing your 
elders sing upon the street corners 
of England, or in America, or in 
some other place as the case might 
be. In some cases Elders had vis- 
ited a gentleman's home and had 
sung our gospel hymns. They 
pleased him, and impressed him 
with the thought that our songs 
carried with them the true spirit of 
the gospel of Jesus Christ. I am 
always proud, and it gives me joy 
to be able to testify to the world 
that the "Mormon" people as a 
whole are lovers of music, and that 
we have talented students in many 
of the musical academies of the 
world. 

In connection with the brethren, 
I have rejoiced exceedingly in the 
proceedings of this copference. 
There is one subject, my brethren 



and sisters, that I wish to call your 
attention to today. Perhaps some 
will think that it is out of place at 
a general conference, but I don't 
believe that it is. I speak of it now 
as this may be the only chance I will 
have. I notice in a report made by 
our government, through the post 
office department, that there was 
over $120,000,000 lost to the Amer- 
ican people last year, through 
frauds carried on through the mails, 
by persons and companies formed 
for the purpose of fleecing the peo- 
ple of the United States. I want to 
say that I was sorry to find that 
tens of thousands of dollars of this 
vast amount had been secured from 
the people of this state. I want to 
advise the people attending this con- 
ference, and all the people of Utah, 
that whenever circular letters come 
to you, from unknown companies, 
with a promise that you can be 
made rich quick, such letters and 
promises should be given the most 
thorough investigation, for nine 
hundred and ninety-nine times out 
of one thousand they are frauds. I 
have received letters from all parts 
of this state, from men whom I was 
dumbfounded to learn had been in- 
fluenced by unreasonable proposi- 
tions, and invested in them. I call 
to mind a real estate firm, whose 
land was supposed to be near the 
city of Washington, D. C, selling 
building lots with a promise of 
enormous profits, and upon investi- 
gation as to the location of its land, 
I found that it was many miles from 
Washington. One might just as 
well put his money in a sand hill in 
the desert as to buy the lands which 
were described in the firm's circu- 
lars. Many, no doubt, receive cir- 
culars from all over the United 
States asking you to subscribe for 
stock in companies whose future 



ELDER REED SMOOT. 



53 



success depends upon some patent, 
or supposed patent, that may be 
issued to some individual, which, if 
investigated, would probably be 
found worthless. 1 say to the good 
people of Utah that there are plenty 
of opportunities for good invest- 
ments in this state, and it is far 
better to invest in them than to send 
your hard earned money abroad, 
and virtually give it to a lot of 
crooks who are living on their wits, 
and robbing the people of the 
United States. 

I rejoice in the fact that there is 
a compensation in living the laws 
of God, not for the world to come 
only, but in this life, and the world 
will sooner or later acknowledge it. 
Business men are beginning to un- 
derstand it, especially men who re- 
quire the full strength and facul- 
ties of their employees. Responsible 
positions require not only physical, 
but intellectual strength, and many 
employers are demanding that 
neither be impaired by the use of 
liquor or tobacco. Managers in the 
American baseball league will not 
select a player who has acquired the 
habit of liquor drinking. Every 
player is closely examined as to his 
moral habits. I have heard it stated 
that Walter Johnson, the swiftest 
and best pitcher in the American 
League, can always be depended 
upon as he is free from all bad 
habits. The mountain air of Idaho 
gave him a splendid constitution, 
and it has not been destroyed by the 
use of liquor; he lives a clean life. 
The managers of the great railroads 
are not employing men who drink 
and smoke. They have learned 
through experience that the en- 
gineers, who have in their hands 
the lives of millions of people, can- 
not be trusted with that great re- 
sponsibility if they dull their intel- 



lect by the use of tobacco or liquor. 
This is going to be the rule not only 
with the great railroads, but with 
many of the great business concerns 
requiring men of ability in respon- 
sible positions. I could not help but 
think of similar cases when Brother 
Wells was speaking of the boy who 
could not refuse to drink with his 
companions, and did not have the 
moral strength to withstand tempta- 
tion. I never lost a thing in this 
world, not even the respect of a sin- 
gle person that I know of, by refus- 
ing to smoke or drink upon any 
occasion ; and I know that I have 
won the respect and confidence of 
thousands by refusing to do so, and 
by living up to what I profess. I 
don't care where tobacco or liquors 
are offered or served, whether it be 
at a dinner, or a gathering of any 
kind, they have been no temptation 
to me. The oftener you refuse the 
easier it is to do so. My Father in 
heaven has given me strength to do 
so. My mother taught me in my 
young days the evils that would fol- 
low any man who did not have the 
strength to resist temptation. When 
I was eighteen years of age I was 
manager of the Provo Co-operative 
Institution and I was thrown in the 
company of all classes of men. Dur- 
ing that time I visited nearly every 
state in the Union on business, and 
I testify to you that I never lost one 
thing by refusing to drink, smoke, 
or to follow those inclined to evil 
habits. On the contrary I won 
their respect, and I have heard them 
so testify. So I say again, we are 
compensated in this life for obeying 
the temporal laws of God. 

I want to add my testimony that 
this is the work of God, and I know 
that He doth live, and that Jesus 
is the Christ. I have confidence in 
the predictions of the prophets of 



54 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



God ; I know that this is His Church 
and that it will do all that He in- 
tends it to accomplish ; and that we 
may be successful, and be loyal to 
it as long as we live, I ask in the 
name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER HYRUM M. SMITH. 

Prevailing disposition to discredit the 
Bible. — "Private" interpretation of 
scripture denounced. — Principles of 
salvation plainly declared in scriptures. 
— Gift of the Holy Ghost most 'desir- 
able. — Saints enjoined to become 
familiar with ancient and modern 
scriptures. 

There appears at the head of 
each number of the Millenial Star, 
which is published weekly in Liver- 
pool, England, a quotation from 
scripture, or a wise saying of some 
man. I opened the "Star" of 
Thursday, September 19, 1912, a 
day or two ago, and read this par- 
ticular passage, and the remarks of 
some of the brethren in this confer- 
ence have directed my mind again 
to it. I would like to read it be- 
cause it is a striking sentiment and 
it is true. It is as follows : 

"We must come to the study of 
the Bible as pupils, not as judges, 
to find, not what ought to be said, 
but what God has said, as enquirers 
after divine truth, not as advocates 
seeking arguments. It is the stu- 
dent and not the book that needs 
to be spiritualized." 

It is accredited to Dr. Liddon. I 
don't know who this gentleman is, 
and I don't know whether or not in 
his article from which this excerpt 
was taken he attempts to direct peo- 
ple how to become spiritualized. 
This is not altogether a new idea. 
The form of words may be new in 
which the idea is clothed, but the 
idea itself has been advocated by 
the elders of the Church for up- 



wards of eighty years. Infidels have 
treated the Bible with the utmost 
contempt. They have read it only 
with the idea of condemning it. 
They have ridiculed it and have 
held in derision those who have pro- 
fessed to believe in it. Another 
class of men, calling themselves 
philosophers, or higher critics, have 
studied the scriptures very carefully, 
and have criticised them severely. 
They have discredited all in them 
that partakes of the supernatural or 
miraculous. They have raised 
grave questions concerning the au- 
thorship of the books of the Bible, 
and they contend among themselves 
over many of the things which are 
recorded in the Holy Writ. They 
argue over the question as to 
whether there was ever such a man 
as Job, or whether Mark wrote the 
gospel that bears his name, or 
whether Christ performed the mira- 
cles which are related of Him. This 
second class, I might say, have pret- 
ty thoroughly torn to fragments the 
holy scriptures. As a result of their 
work multitudes of men have come 
to doubt the divine nature of the 
Bible. Then there is still another 
class of men who are known as 
Christian ministers, who profess to 
believe the Bible to be the word of 
God entirely. They declare that it 
is the word of God, the whole word 
of God ; that God had spoken noth- 
ing before the beginning; nor since 
the close of that record and will 
speak never again. They profess 
belief in the book, with their lips, 
and then straightway deny it in 
their acts and their lives by refus- 
ing, or at least failing to follow the 
teachings of the Bible, notwith- 
standing the book itself declares, 
"Why call ye me Lord, Lord, and 
do not the things which I say ?" 
Now, these three classes of peo- 



ELDER HYRUM M. SMITH. 



55 



pie have pretty well succeeded, with 
their sophistries and their criticisms 
and their ridicule, in thoroughly 
sterilizing the whole Christian world 
as to spiritual life. Of course, no 
man can spiritualize the scriptures. 
Men subject the scriptures to a form 
or process which they term spirit- 
ualizing, but which is not spiritual- 
izing at all, but is merely placing 
their own interpretation upon them, 
in order to make the scriptures con- 
form to their own particular views, 
and this again, in the very face of 
the declaration of the book itself, 
"that no prophecy of the scripture 
is 'of any private interpretation. For 
the prophecy came not in old time 
by the will of man, but holy men of 
God spoke as they were moved by 
the Holy Ghost." And again, 
neither can the Bible spiritualize 
men. That is to say, the Bible has 
not the power to confer upon men 
the Holy Ghost, nor to give unto 
them that Spirit of God, which has 
been spoken of here in this confer- 
ence by President Lyman and 
others. The Bible truly, as has been 
explained by the Prophet Joseph 
Smith, is the word of God, so far as 
it is translated correctly. The Lat- 
ter-day Saints believe it to be such, 
and we are endeavoring to put into 
practice in our every-clay lives the 
principles and precepts that are 
made plain and clear in the holy 
scriptures, which things were in- 
dited by the Spirit of God, but 
which things must oe understood, 
and can only be understood by men 
who enjoy the Holy Spirit. Now, 
how shall men become spiritualized 
in very truth ? Well, the scriptures 
are plain on that matter. It is, 
first, by faith in God. We should 
believe in Him with all our heart, 
might, mind and strength, and, sec- 
ond, by repentance of our sins, a 



process of turning away from sin 
or being sorry for the evils we have 
done, calling upon the Lord to be 
merciful to us, and to accept us and 
acknowledge our repentance, and to 
help us to remain repentant to the 
extent that we shall no more return 
again to the works of evil. When 
we have thus repented and have 
purified our tabernacles and made 
them clean, that they may be indeed 
temples of the Lord our God, 
wherein may dwell the Holy Ghost, 
we are prepared for baptism in 
water by immersion for the remis- 
sion of our sins, that through that 
ordinance our sins may be washed 
away and we be forgiven, being 
buried with Christ in baptism, in 
the similitude of His death, and be- 
ing raised again cleansed and puri- 
fied, to walk in newness of life, in 
the likeness of the glorious resur- 
rection of the Son of God, then we 
are prepared to receive the Holy 
Ghost, the Spirit of truth, that takes 
of the things of God and reveals 
them unto the children of our 
Father in heaven. The Holy Ghost 
is received by the laying on of hands 
by one having authority, and then, 
and not until then, can the student 
of the scripture and the believer in 
God become truly spiritualized. 

When he has so received the gift 
of the Holy Ghost, or the Holy 
Ghost as a gift from God, he has 
received a comforter to his soul, a 
light to his path, a spirit that giveth 
understanding and knowledge, that 
brightens the mind, quickens the in- 
tellect and gives a proper compre- 
hension of the things of God that 
have been revealed through the 
prophets, and are written in the holy 
scriptures. A man with this spirit, 
reading the scriptures will under- 
stand them. He will not wrest them 
to his own condemnation. He will 



56 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



accept the declaration of the Holy 
Scriptures that the Lord Jesus 
Christ was born of a woman, liter- 
ally and naturally, like all other men 
have been born, and will not at- 
tempt, as some do, to spiritualize the 
birth of the Lord Jesus Christ. He 
will believe in the ministry of the 
Redeemer of men, will accept the 
history of His ministry, of His 
death, of His burial, and will be- 
lieve and understand, by the power 
and witness of the Holy Ghost, that 
Christ rose from the dead, that He 
again took up that very same body 
that was crucified and laid in the 
grave, and further, he will believe 
that as Christ rose from the dead so 
shall all men come forth in a resur- 
rection from the dead, taking up the 
body that died and was buried. And 
he will not attempt to spiritualize it 
or to interpret the word of God into 
meaning something else — that it is 
a spiritual resurrection and not the 
resurrection of a mortal body into 
an immortal body. As he reads the 
scriptures all things spoken by the 
prophets of old shall be understood 
by him, by virtue of his possessing 
the Spirit of truth, and they will be 
clear to his understanding; and, as 
the multitude read who are pos- 
sessed of this Spirit, having been 
spiritualized in this manner, they 
shall see and understand, believe 
and know alike, and there shall be 
no difference of opinion nor of un- 
derstanding upon these great fun- 
damental truths of the gospel of 
salvation. He, the spirit of truth, 
shall guide them into all truth, and 
shall abide with the faithful forever. 

My brethren and sisters, per- 
chance there are spme among us 
who have been spiritualized in this 
way, who have received the Holy 
Ghost, by which our minds may be 
enlightened and our knowledge in- 



creased, who have wandered away 
from daily companionship with the 
things that have been spoken and 
written by holy men of God, and 
which are found recorded in the 
Bible. If there are any who are not 
in close association and familiar 
with the word of the Lord as con- 
tained in the Bible, then I would 
invite all such to return again to 
that book, and to read it frequently, 
to be encouraged and comforted, 
enlightened and made wiser, more 
humble and true by daily converse 
with the inspired word of the Lord. 
] f there are any among us who 
rarely, if ever, take up the Book of 
Mormon, another book containing 
the words and prophecies of holy 
men who spoke and wrote as they 
were moved upon by the Holy 
Ghost, which has been revealed to 
us through the Prophet Joseph 
Smith in the latter days, and con- 
tains the history of the dealings of 
God with His children who dwelt 
upon this continent — then I would 
say, return again to the Book of 
Mormon and become familiar with 
it. Read it and be instructed, and 
allow the Spirit of God, even the 
Holy Ghost, to open the. eyes of 
your understanding, to make clear 
unto you the precious words of life 
which it contains. And as you read 
the Book of* Mormon and come to 
comprehend its great message, you 
will come to love it, love it most 
dearly, as a direct communication 
of God to man. 

If there are any of the Saints who 
neglect to read the Doctrine and 
Covenants — which contains the rev- 
elations of our Lord to His children 
in the dispensation of the fulness of 
times — I would advise them to take 
it up oftener and read it carefully 
and prayerfully, because it contains 
indeed the words of eternal life.

I might say the same of the Pearl 
of Great Price, which we might all 
read with great profit to ourselves. 
Now, I would advise you, my breth- 
ren, if in your communities there 
are members of the Church w,ho 
have long since ceased to be daily 
searchers of the scriptures, that you 
invite them to renew their acquaint- 
ance with the word of the Lord. If 
there are any among us who are not 
as faithful as they should be in at- 
tending to their meetings, where 
they may hear the word of God 
spoken, spoken too, by the prompt- 
ings arid inspiration of the Holy 
Ghost ; things which come fresh and 
new from the fountain of all truth, 
then I would say, labor among them 
and with them and invite them to 
come into the house of the Lord, 
where they may be comforted and 
instructed. Encourage them to re- 
pent and to commune with the Lord 
through the gift of the Spirit, and 
to associate more with the Saints 
who enjoy and possess that glorious 
Spirit. 

There is a cry that has gone 
forth from some of the leading 
statesmen of our land recently to 
those who crowd and congest the 
great cities of our country, it is 
"back to the farm," back to the soil, 
back to nature. It is good advice. 
It is wise counsel. And I would 
say, too, that if there are any of us 
who have wandered away from 
reading the scriptures and from ac- 
quaintance with the word of God, 
that we come back to the Bible, 
back to the Book of Mormon, back 
to the Doctrine and Covenants, and 
back to prayer ; back to our knees, 
if not to our mother's knee, at least 
to our own knees before the Lord, 
in the spirit of prayer and repent- 
ance, that we might possess and en- 



joy the companionship of the Holy 
Ghost. 

My brethren and sisters, I would 
say just this word farther, that the 
process of becoming despiritualized 
is just the reverse to that of becom- 
ing spiritualized, or of receiving the 
gift of the Holy Ghost as we re- 
ceive it through faith and repent- 
ance and baptism by immersion in 
water, and by the laying on of 
hands by one holding authority. Let 
us see to it that we do not lose the 
Spirit of God by lapsing into indif- 
ference, into neglect of duty, into 
failure to pray, into disobedience, 
and the breaking of the command- 
ments ; into the spirit of fault-find- 
ing and committing of sin. One 
step leads to another, until by and 
by the Spirit is grieved and will no 
longer strive with us. We can go 
to the extent, in our sinning and 
neglect, that the Spirit of God will 
altogether withdraw from us, and 
then when the light that is within 
us has become darkness, oh, how 
intense, indeed, is that darkness. 
Then we are left to the bufferings 
of Satan, to become like the waves 
of the sea, driven by the wind and 
tossed, to be carried about by every 
wind of doctrine, to be persuaded 
by all manner of men, never secure, 
never established in the truth, al- 
ways full of anxiety and doubt, not 
knowing whither we are being en- 
ticed. That is a terrible condition, 
it has been said that it had been 
better never to have been born, than 
to have received the Holy Ghost, 
and then deny Him. "For if after 
we have escaped the pollution of the 
world through the knowledge of the 
Lord Jesus Christ we are again en- 
tangled therein, and overcome, the 
latter end is worse than the begin- 
ning. For it had been better for us 



58 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



not to have known the way of right- 
eousness, than, after we have known 
it to turn from the holy command- 
ment delivered unto us." I would 
warn all the Latter-day Saints 
against getting into such a state 
through neglect of meetings, neg- 
lect of prayer, neglect to read the 
Bible, the Book of Mormon, and the 
scriptures of modern times, lest they 
lose the Spirit of the Lord and are 
left in a darkened state of mind. If 
there are any taking such a course 
let them repent and return ere it is 
too late, for when once a man has 
enjoyed this Spirit and the witness 
thereof — and the chief mission of 
the Spirit is to bear record and wit- 
ness that Jesus is the Christ, the 
Son of the living God, and to bring 
and reveal to man this knowledge, 
which is eternal life — I say that 
when a man has once enjoyed that 
Spirit and had that witness and then 
through sin and neglect, and wick- 
edness, has that Spirit withdrawn 
from him, so that he cannot repent, 
he is in a terrible condition, and it 
is practically impossible, either in 
this life or the life to come, for that 
man ever again to get possession of 
the Spirit of God and the witness of 
Jesus Christ. It is impossible, either 
in this life or the life to come, for 
a man who commits such a crime, 
to obtain forgiveness, for there is no 
forgiveness without true repentance. 



I bear testimony to you of the 
truth of these things. I rejoice in 
the truth, and I love it, as my 
brethren have declared they love it, 
and I trust that I shall have suffi- 
cient courage and sufficient of the 
Spirit of God and the light of truth 
always to guide me in that path 
which leadeth again into the pres- 
ence of God the Eternal Father. 
May that Spirit be kept alive and 
free within every one of us. May 
we keep our tabernacles pure and 
holy as temples of the Lord our 
God, that we all may be led back 
into the presence of the Father to 
enjoy for eternity the association 
of loved ones and of the Saints who 
have confessed, both in their lives 
and with their tongues, that Jesus 
is the Christ. And O may God 
grant that not one of us may be 
lost, I pray, in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 

A letter to President Joseph F. 
Smith, from the Presidency of Al- 
berta Stake, was read by Elder 
Heber J. Grant, in which it was 
stated that the Cardston choir had 
been honored with an invitation to 
sing at the Dry Farming Congress 
meetings in Lethbridge. 

Benediction was pronounced by 
Elder Junius Romuey. 

Conference adjourned until Sun- 
day, October 6th, at 10 a. m. 



THIRD DAY. 



Conference was resumed in the 
Tabernacle, at 10 a. m., Sunday, 
October 6th ; President Joseph F. 
Smith presiding. 

President Smith announced that, 
for the benefit of the great number 
of people unable to obtain admis- 
sion to the Tabernacle, overflow 
meetings will be held in the adjoin- 
ing Assembly Hall this morning, 
and afternoon, and in the vicinity of 
the Bureau of Information building 
at 2 p. m. 

The Tabernacle Choir sang the 
hymn : 

Sweet is the work, my God, my King, 
To praise Thy name, give thanks and 
sing, 

To show Thy love by morning light, 
And talk of all Thy truths at night. 

Prayer was offered by Elder 
David H. Cannon. 

The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn : 

Shall the youth of Zion falter. 
In defending truth and right? 

While the enemy assaileth, 

Shall we shrink, or shun the fight? 

No! True to the faith that our par- 
ents have cherished, 

True to the truth for which martyrs 
have perished, 

To God's command, soul, heart and 
hand, 

Faithful and true we will ever stand. 

PREST. CHARLES W. PENROSE. 

Present revelation a basic principle. 
— The Holy Spirit a Revelator. — All 
revealed truths are essential. — Ex- 
ercise of charity enjoined. 

We are all greatly pleased in hav- 



ing the privilege of attending this 
general conference of the Church to 
which we belong, and I have re- 
joiced in my soul, during the ser- 
vices that have been held, that I 
have been spared by the Lord once 
more to meet with the Latter-day 
Saints in general conference and 
receive the instructions that are im- 
parted, and partake of the good 
spirit which prevails. I feel that 
the Lord has been with us in our 
assemblies from the very beginning 
to the present time, and the instruc- 
tions that were given to us by our 
President in his opening remarks 
gave great joy and satisfaction to 
all who were present on the occa- 
sion. I congratulate those of the 
Saints who had the privilege of be- 
ing here at that time, and I sympa- 
thize and condole with those who 
were not able to be present and hear 
the instructions that were imparted. 
We shall all have the privilege, no 
doubt, of seeing them in print, but 
there is a very great difference in 
reading what has been said and 
hearing it, because the words that 
were spoken on that occasion were 
accompanied by the spirit and pow- 
er of the office and calling of the 
man who stands at the head of the 
Church, and through whom the 
Lord will impart to His people that 
which He has to give them by way 
of revelation and commandment as 
well as counsel. I thank the Lord 
for the organization of the Church 
in the latter days, that He revealed 
Himself accompanied by the pres- 
ence of His Son Jesus Christ our

Redeemer to open up the last dis- 
pensation, and that Joseph Smith, 
in his youth, while uncontaminated 
with the notions and opinions of the 
world, received the message that 
was to be imparted to the people 
later on in all the world, and I am 
very thankful that I live on the 
earth at a time when I can take 
part in the great work, that "mar- 
velous work and a wonder" fore- 
seen by ancient prophets, which 
has been ushered in and which is 
now in progress. 

In the revelations that the Lord 
has given to the Church from time 
to time since the beginning, we 
have the fundamental doctrines of 
the gospel of Jesus Christ made 
manifest. Every principle which 
forms the creed or set of principles 
held by this Church has come to us, 
not by the wisdom or the folly of 
men — but has been revealed direct 
from on high. This basic principle 
of the Church of Jesus Christ must 
always be kept in view and will re- 
main while the Church remains ; 
that is, the doctrine of present rev- 
elation. While the world has had 
to depend for centuries upon the 
communications from on high in 
the past, many of which have not 
been preserved and kept among 
men, and in addition to that have 
only had for their guide the opin- 
ions of men, the different notions 
and ideas prevailing among men, 
for their guide, this Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is 
in communion, in communication, 
with the powers on high, and the 
Lord has established His Church 
upon a firm foundation so that the 
people may not be led astray by 
error, by false doctrine, by the no- 
tions and opinions of men, whether 
they be good men or bad men ; but 
has so organized the Church that 



we can all look to the head of the 
Church for the word of the Lord by 
way of commandment, and so that 
in every department of the Church 
the people may receive instruction 
in conformity to that which the 
Lord reveals. From the organiza- 
tion of the little children up through 
the various societies and associa- 
tions that have been formed, and 
in all the quorums and organiza- 
tions of the holy priesthood, the 
word of the Lord may be received 
and form the guide for the people, 
the young and the old — of all ages 
and degrees — so that this Church 
is unique in this particular, that 
the communication opened up by 
the appearance of the Father and 
the Son to the boy Joseph Smith 
is- continued. 

God is made manifest sometimes 
by His own voice through the 
appointed channels ; sometimes 
through the ministration of angels 
authorized to speak for Him ; some- 
times by the voice of Jesus Christ, 
our Redeemer, through whom reve- 
lations contained in the Doctrine 
and Covenants have come to us, 
and always by the inspiration of 
the Holy Ghost, the witness for the 
Father and the Son, and it is the 
privilege of every member of the 
Church to receive and be inspired 
by that divine influence. The Holy 
Ghost, the Comforter that Christ 
spoke about, that "personage of 
spirit" is with the Church, and the 
influence that proceeds from him 
and from the Father and from the 
Son, which is one spirit, it is the 
privilege of every member of the 
Church to enjoy. It is the light of 
the Lord ; it is that which gives life 
and light to all things ; it has a 
diversity of operations but is the 
same Spirit, and it permeates the 
whole Church as, in some of its op- 



PRESIDENT CHARLES W. PENROSE. 



61 



erations it pervades the cosmos, the 
whole universe, for it "proceedeth 
from the presence of God the 
Father throughout the immensity of 
space." 

But in those operations which 
pertain especially to the Church of 
Christ it is manifest to those who 
have faith in God and in Jesus 
Christ, and who have repented of 
sin, and have become members of 
the Church through being baptized 
in water by one having authority 
for the remission of sins, and upon 
whom the hands of authorized ser- 
vants of God have been laid, that 
they may have the gift of the Holy 
Ghost. It is the abiding witness, 
the continual light, that which re- 
veals the things of God and makes 
them plain to the human mind, 
that which bears witness of the 
truth and which, when God speaks 
through His appointed oracles, 
when the head of the Church re- 
ceives any revelation or command- 
ment for the Church, bears witness 
in the souls of the Saints concern- 
ing it. Thus they may see and un- 
united together, "baptized by one 
not be in the darkness, and may be 
united together." baptized by one 
spirit into one body." No matter 
what they may have been before ; no 
matter what associations or churches 
or societies they may have previ- 
ously belonged to, no matter how 
much they may have wandered in. 
the darkness in devious ways — now 
having come into the strait and 
narrow way that leadeth unto eter- 
nal life, they are baptized by the one 
Spirit into one body and see eye to 
eye when they are enlightened by 
that Spirit. But it does not force 
itself upon the human mind ; it 
must be sought for ; the soul of man 
must be opened to receive its in- 
coming and to yield to its impres- 



sions. And when that one Spirit 
rests down upon the body of the 
Church they do indeed see eye to 
eye and when those who are ap- 
pointed speak by the power and 
gift of their calling in the Holy 
Ghost there is an echo to the words 
that are spoken in the hearts and 
souls of the people. 

This is how it is in the presence 
of the Father ; this is what we will 
find when we enter into a state of 
perfection. God speaks and the 
whole heavens respond. If anything 
discordant arises, means are at 
hand to remove it from the midst 
of the assembled hosts on high, so 
that harmony and union and con- 
cord and understanding and knowl- 
edge are enjoyed by the great body 
of the Saints and sons and daugh- 
ters of God. This is how it is, 
measurably, here on .earth when we 
are all rightly disposed, when we 
put away from ourselves our per- 
sonal desires, ambitions, appetites, 
failings and weaknesses, and hum- 
ble ourselves before the Lord and 
are willing to receive His word; 
when we imbibe and are governed 
by that Spirit which Jesus Christ, 
our Savior, had when He dwelt in 
the flesh and by which He was 
governed in all His life; that is, to 
make the will of the Father our 
will. "I come," He said, "not to 
do my own will but the will of Him 
that sent me," and He manifested 
this spirit and disposition during 
the whole of His earthly career, and 
even to the last moment when He 
gave up the ghost on the cross and 
finished the work that He had to 
do in the flesh, He still had that 
Spirit within Him, "Father, let not 
my will but Thy will be done." 
When we have that spirit, then, we 
are ready to receive the impres- 
sions that come from on high, and 



62 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



the eyes of our understanding are 
opened and our ears are unstopped, 
and we receive the word that comes 
through the proper channel and our 
hearts rejoice and our spirits are 
glad and we are ready and willing 
to do that which the Lord requires 
at our hands. 

I say that this is one of the fund- 
amental principles, of the Gospel of 
Jesus Christ. The Lord in a reve- 
lation which we will find in the 
88th section of the Doctrine and 
Covenants ( which, by the way, con- 
tains a great number of most glor- 
ious truths and admonitions and 
instructions), the Lord says that 
we are to "abide in the liberty by 
which we have been made free" in 
the Gospel ; and it is necessary from 
time to time that our minds are 
called back to the fundamentals of 
our Church. Not but what every- 
thing that the' Lord has revealed is 
(true, and truth abideth iforever, 
but there are basic principles un- 
derlying our faith that we should 
have our minds called attention to 
from time to time, and these are 
expounded to us in our confer- 
ences, in our sacramental meetings, 
in our organizations of the Holy 
Priesthood, through men who are 
appointed to teach and preach and 
expound and declare the mind and 
will of the Lord. And it is nec- 
essary that we understand these 
things so that we may not be led 
astray and go off into by and for- 
bidden paths. The great trouble 
in the early times, just after the 
Savior had departed and the apos- 
tles were put to death, was the 
straying off into side issues, into 
by and forbidden paths, by the 
members of the Church. When 
the lights that God had placed in 
the midst of the darkness of that 
generation were put out by the 



hands of wicked men, darkness 
came again and covered the earth 
and gross darkness came upon 
the people and they were led hither 
and thither because they com- 
menced to depart from the simple 
principles of the Gospel of Jesus 
Christ and were led astray by the 
vagaries and opinions of men. 

Now we have to be cautioned 
about this course, we Latter-day 
Saints, lest we also depart from the 
faith and give heed to seducing 
spirits and doctrines that are not in 
accordance with the mind and will 
of God. If we become established 
in the truth, if our fee^ are planted 
upon the rock, if we receive the im- 
pressions of that divine Spirit which 
is "the anointing that comes from 
above and teacheth all things" and 
is to be an abiding witness within 
us, there will be very little danger 
of our going astray. But when we 
imbibe opinions and notions that 
are introduced by speculative phi- 
losophy falsely called science, and 
our minds are turned to those 
things that are taught in many of 
the schools and colleges of the 
world under the name of science, 
we are apt to go astray and get 
away from the fundamentals to 
which I am making brief allusion 
this morning. So, my brethren and 
sisters, we should become fully es- 
tablished in those things that are 
fundamental to our faith. And 
' these are essential. Indeed I do 
not know anything that is really 
true and that is divine that is not 
essential. It is true, a division is 
made in the Christian world be- 
tween what are called "essentials" 
and "non-essentials." But the trou- 
ble is that there is no real unity 
among men in the Christian world 
as to what is essential and what is 
non-essential. Every principle that 



PRESIDENT CHARLES W. PENROSE. 63 



the Lord has revealed to us in the 
latter days is to be counted among 
the essentials, and as I have said, I 
do not know anything that the Lord 
has revealed, that God has made 
manifest to us, which is non-essen- 
tial. 

Now, there should be liberty, of 
course, in all these things ; liberty 
in regard to essentials as well as 
liberty in regard to what are called 
non-essentials. To what extent? 
To this extent : 

"Know this, that every soul is free 
To choose his life and what he'll be, 
For this eternal truth is given. 
That God will force no man to heaven. 

He'll call, persuade, direct aright, 
Lead him with wisdom, love and 
light, 

In nameless ways be good and kind, 
But never force the human mind." 

That freedom is given to all 
people. And yet, at the same 
time, while people are at liberty to 
choose the right or to refuse it, they 
must receive and bear the conse- 
quences of their own individual 
acts. The truth is presented to the 
world. "Go ye into all nations and 
preach the gospel to every creature ; 
he that believeth and is baptized 
shall be saved, but he that believ- 
eth not shall be damned." That is 
the Savior's edict, and it comes on 
natural principles. If a man hears 
the truth and will not receive it, if 
he rejects it, he must take the con- 
sequences, but he has the liberty 
to receive or reject. A man is not 
compelled to be baptized. He may 
choose to be baptized or to remain 
unbaptized, but if he remains un- 
baptized having faith and repent- 
ance he cannot receive the remis- 
sion of his sins and he cannot enter 
into the fold and family of Christ 
either on earth or in the heavens, 



for "except a man be born of water 
and of the spirit he cannot enter 
into the kingdom of God." That is 
one of the fundamental things 
taught by our Savior when in the 
flesh, and He has renewed it in the 
latter days in the revelations given 
through the Prophet Joseph Smith. 

Now we should be very careful 
when we hear the word of the 
Lord, to receive it and to obey it, 
and we should be very careful when 
men utter their own opinions and 
ideas, whether in regard to the prin- 
ciples of the Gospel or to anything 
that pertains to the welfare of the 
human family, about accepting it. 
And we should have our eyes open 
to the light and be willing to re- 
ceive good counsel and good ad- 
vice, and to hearken to the voice of 
the Lord through the appointed 
channel and seek to the Lord our 
God for light that we may know 
whether we are traveling in the 
straight path that leadeth to happi- 
ness and eternal life or are being led 
off into by and forbidden paths. In 
the Christian world the idea of "es- 
sentials and non-essentials" refers 
to religion. That saying which was 
quoted here so beautifully by 
Brother Roberts, emanating from a 
distinguished divine of the latter 
times : "Unity in essentials, liberty 
in non-essentials and charity in all 
things" is very attractive at first 
sight and first hearing. But the 
question arises, as I have intimated, 
as to what are essentials and what 
are non-essentials. The saying as 
uttered by that modern divine re- 
lated entirely to religious matters ; 
that in essentials we should be 
united, that in non-essentials, that 
is, pertaining to religious ideas, not 
particularly to civil government — 
it was not uttered in that connec- 
tion — but in non-essentials we 



64 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



should have liberty. Yes, certainly- 
liberty in both, I say ; liberty in es- 
sentials — that is, the liberty to re- 
ceive or reject when a principle or 
doctrine or idea is presented to us ; 
we have the liberty to receive it 
and we have the liberty to reject 
it, but we take the consequences 
of our own act because we are re- 
sponsible beings, intelligent beings, 
and there is a day appointed in 
which all people shall be judged for 
the deeds done in the body. And 
this will be because they are re- 
sponsible for their own acts and 
they can receive or reject, whether 
it be in essentials or in non-essen- 
tials. 

But in regard to what is called 
"civil government." Are there no 
essentials in that which is grouped 
under the head of civil govern- 
ment? Yes, I think so; I think 
that there are fundamentals in re- 
gard to civil government and par- 
ticularly in the kind of govern- 
ment under which we live. We live 
in a government "of the people and 
by the people and for the people." 
Yes, that is a splendid idea; it is 
true ; but it has to be understood 
in the spirit of it. We have a gov- 
ernment of the people because the 
people of the United States, 
through their representatives, made 
a Constitution which is the funda- 
mental, supreme law of the land, 
and there are definite principles 
contained in that sacred instru- 
ment. And we have the right to 
talk about it in our general con- 
ference, or in our other religious 
gatherings, because we have re- 
ceived the word of the Lord con- 
cerning it. In the 101st section of 
the Doctrine and Covenants we can 
read what the Lord has said con- 
cerning that instrument. He says 
that we are to befriend it and to 



stand by it because it was written 
and framed by wise men whom He 
raised up for that very purpose ; 
that is what the Lord says, in verse 
80. God gave to the framers of 
the Constitution of our country the 
wisdom which they exhibited in 
adopting and agreeing to certain 
fundamental principles which stand 
at the base* of that beautiful and 
glorious instrument. It is called 
the "palladium of our rights," for 
it secures rights not only to. an in- 
dividual but to the whole people. 
And the Lord says, in verse 77, 
that this is what it was framed for 
—that all people might be pre- 
served and protected in their rights 
and their privileges ; not merely an 
individual or a faction, but the 
whole people. 

Now, the framers of that instru- 
ment had before them the history 
of the progress of civil government 
for ages. They knew something 
about the failings of the past ; they 
knew something about the various 
kinds of governments that had been 
set up in the centuries that had 
passed away; they had learned the 
difference between that which is 
called popular government — the un- 
guided will of the people, the 
masses, and a representative gov- 
ernment carried on by persons 
chosen by the people. And, my 
dear brethren and sisters, if you will 
study the Constitution of our coun- 
try as we all ought to do, for we 
form a part of the government, we 
are part of the people, and we are 
endowed as a State in the Union — 
I say "we," I mean, of course, all 
the people of Utah — endowed by 
the power of the Constitution with 
all the rights and privileges that 
pertain to citizens of our country, 
we should become familiar with 
that instrument. I am glad to know 



PRESIDENT CHARLES W. PENROSE.

that the Mutual Improvement As- 
sociation has endeavored to intro- 
duce among the members of that 
body a manual relating to the gov- 
ernment of our country and its in- 
stitutions, so that our brethren may 
become acquainted with it. Now, 
you will find by studying that sa- 
cred instrument that it provides for 
what is generally called a repre- 
sentative form of government. The 
government is divided into three 
branches : the legislative, the execu- 
tive and the judicial ; the judiciary, 
and the President, and the Con- 
gress which is formed into two 
branches, one to make a balance or 
check upon the other. These insti- 
tutions set up and established in 
the Constitution of our country 
were the product of the knowledge 
and the wisdom of the men who 
sat in council who had had the op- 
portunity of reading about the ex- 
periences of the past, away back to 
the time of ancient Rome and 
Greece, and they saw the failures 
that had occurred when the popu- 
lace directly had power to regulate 
the affairs of the community. They 
saw what was needed to put a 
check upon the passions of the mul- 
titude ; they saw what was neces- 
sary to secure the rights and priv- 
ileges of all the people under the 
Constitution which they were fram- 
ing, and God gave them the wis- 
dom to select out of the experiences 
of the past the things that abide, 
that would remain, that were im- 
perishable in their nature because 
they were founded in truth, found- 
ed in the real spirit of liberty, 
founded in the essential spirit of 
freedom to secure to all people 
their rights and privileges so that 
none might intrude upon the other. 

Individual liberty would not do 
in the full extent of the term, for 



if every man was at liberty, as some 
have contended, to say what he 
chooses and in the way he chooses, 
how soon there would be chaos ! 
You go along the street here in 
Salt Lake City and tell every man 
what you think of him and say it in 
the way that you choose, what 
would be the consequence? Why, 
you would find yourself in the gut- 
ter if he is stronger than you phys- 
ically. Suppose people everywhere 
had the freedom to say just what 
they liked and in the way they 
liked and contended individually for 
that which they thought would be 
for the best interests of the com- 
munity, we would soon have no 
community, we would have chaos, 
and by and by there would be an- 
archy. You will find by reading 
closely the history of the past, that 
this extreme popular liberty has 
generally gone back again into 
tyranny and monarchism. But the 
representative form of government 
provided in the Constitution of the 
United States, if preserved among 
the people of this country, will 
maintain and continue that free- 
dom, that liberty and that power 
to the nation which the Lord de- 
signed this nation should have, if 
the people would follow in His 
ways and keep His command- 
ments. For it is the history of 
this country that when the major- 
ity of the people went into wicked- 
ness and corruption and turned 
away from the principles be- 
queathed to them by their fathers 
and rushed into self-government to 
the full extent, they perished, they 
were involved in war and destruc- 
tion came upon them. And now the 
Lord has declared that if we con- 
tinue in the truths which He has 
revealed, He will maintain this na- 
tion and make it great in the eyes 



66 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



of all the world, and for over a 
hundred years this has been going 
on under the form of government 
established by the "fathers, under 
that instrument called the Consti- 
tution of our country which the 
Lord inspired wise men to adopt. 

We have been told repeatedly — 
I have heard it ever since I came 
into the Church almost — that the 
time would come when that Con- 
stitution would be in danger, and 
it would be the privilege and the 
duty of the men of God in the 
Church of Christ to stand up for 
the Constitution and .help to main- 
tain it and preserve it from being 
trampled under foot. I call the at- 
tention of my brethren and sisters 
this morning to this declaration, 
and even if it had not been uttered 
in that form I believe with all my 
heart, because of the revelation 
that I have referred to, that the 
Lord designs that this people, of 
all people in this great land, shall 
be the defenders of the Constitu- 
tion of the United States and stand 
by that fundamental principle 
which runs through the whole in- 
strument, by which the people are 
rpresented by men of their own 
choice to make the laws, to execute 
them and to pass upon them — not 
to be passed upon by the multitude, 
but by the tribunal that the Lord 
helped to bring about by giving 
wisdom to our forefathers that they 
might establish the government on 
those foundations. I draw your 
attention to this because I believe, 
as President Smith declared in the 
opening speech in this conference, 
that "we are living in perilous 
times ;" that the time has come 
when our attention should be 
drawn to these things that we may 
know our duty and that we may 
perform it manfully. The Lord 



told the prophet Ezekiel that He 
made him a watchman on the tow- 
ers of Israel, and He laid the re- 
sponsibility upon him for telling 
the people what was right and call- 
ing them back from doing what 
was wrong, and He said if the 
watchman did his duty his skirts 
should be clear; but if he did not 
do his duty and trouble' and sor- 
row and destruction came, the re- 
sponsibility should be on his head, 
but if the watchman warned the 
people and they would not take the 
warning, then the consequences 
they would have to suffer and the 
responsibility would be theirs, and 
I thank God that we have a watch- 
man on the towers of Zion inspired 
of the Lord, filled with the Spirit 
of his predecessors in office, 
clothed upon with the right and 
the power and the authority to 
speak to us in the name of the 
Lord. 

Let us heed the warning voice ! 
do not be led astray into by and 
forbidden paths, but observe that 
splendid principle enunciated by the 
English divine whom I have briefly 
alluded to this morning, that we 
should have "charity in all things" 
— charity that covers a multitude 
of faults ; charity that "believeth 
all things, that hopeth all things ;" 
(that is, all things that are true 
and good) ; that is not puffed up, 
that does not seek its own, but 
seeks the welfare of others. And 
let me say here, in passing, that 
that is not true charity which is 
exhibited sometimes by some of us 
when we can do nothing but find 
fault; when we try to portray the 
weaknesses of our fellow men ; 
when we stand up in public and 
berate them and call them evil 
names; when we do not go to them 
as brothers and talk to them about 



PRESIDENT CHARLES W. PENROSE. 



67 



what we think is wrong in their 
ideas and notions, bur stand up be- 
fore the populace and call them 
vile names — no charity to my mind 
in that — but we should be charita- 
ble and exercise discretion and 
judgment in all that we do and be 
kind and forbearing and faithful. 
But it is the duty of those who 
stand to regulate, to preside, to di- 
rect, to be stern for the truth and 
to stand by it, and sometimes, as 
the Prophet Joseph said in one of 
the revelations given to him, that 
the power of the priesthood should 
be exercised in kindness, with love 
unfeigned, by persuasion, by teach- 
ing, by enlightenment, and yet 
sometimes to "rebuke with sharp- 
ness" where it was necessary, so 
that those who failed or were 
drawn aside might repent and re- 
turn unto the Lord. 

I regret in my soul that any of 
my brethren should go out before 
the people and lift up their voices 
apparently for the sole purpose of 
exposing the faults, and as they 
think sometimes, the iniquities, of 
men who are in office and in au- 
thority, their own brethren in the 
Church of Christ, instead of trying 
to explain to the individuals their 
faults. I do not believe that it is 
the right of men, and particularly 
if they themselves claim to have 
ecclesiastical authority and power 
in the ministry, to go out and be- 
rate others, and at the same time 
if the man who stands at the head 
utters his opinion, no matter how 
carefully and kindly, they want to 
rob him of that right. I contend 
and have contended all along 
through the years that have passed, 
by tongue and pen, that the rights 
of the authorities of this Church 
are at least equal to the rights of 
other citizens in these matters, and 



it is the right and privilege of the 
man who stands at the head to give 
forth his opinions arid his views. 
If at any time he tries to enforce his 
private opinions upon others by 
way of edicts against them, by ec- 
clesiastical force, by physical force, 
by any pains or penalties, that will 
be another thing ; but that hasn't 
occurred in our history so far as 
I know, and I will support my 
brethren with whom I am associ- 
ated in pointing out the truth as 
they see it, and exposing the wrong 
as they understand it, and in try- 
ing to convince and convert those 
who go astray to come into the 
right path, that good government 
may prevail; that is our privilege. 

The realm of civil government 
contains no doubt many things that 
are non-essential and in them we 
can be at difference, and so we can 
in regard to essentials, and I re- 
gard as essential to the welfare of 
this country the things contained 
in the Constitution of our land. Of 
course it may be amended, but 
amending the Constitution and 
ripping it up the back and tear- 
ing out its vitals are two very 
different things. We want to 
stand by the Constitution in its 
spirit and meaning and intent, and 
in the fundamental parts thereof. 
There have been amendments 
made, but if you will study them 
you will find that they are not in 
discord or at discord with the body 
of the document. The ten amend- 
ments first passed are enlargements 
of powers and rights in the direc- 
tion of the people and they are all 
right, every one of them, and in 
harmony with the instrument itself. 
There may be difference of opinion 
in regard to some others that have 
been passed, but they have been 
adopted and they are part of the 



68 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



fundamental law now and we must 
stand by them ; it is our duty to 
do so, but in every respect they are 
carrying out the powers legitimate- 
ly bestowed by the Constitution of 
our country. Now then let us be 
careful that we do not drift away 
from that Constitution and be led 
off into by and forbidden paths and 
bring chaos and finally anarchy and 
destruction upon this glorious na- 
tion. 

In the last chapter of the Old 
Testament we read about Elijah the 
prophet coming before the great 
and dreadful day of the Lord, and 
connected with that is the predic- 
tion or rather the commandment of 
God, "Remember ye the law that I 
gave unto you in Horeb, with the 
statutes and judgment." Turn back 
to the Old Testament in the book 
of Exodus, chapter 20, that was 
read in our first meeting, and you 
will find that which was given in 
Horeb, consisting of the ten com- 
mandments, and they are funda- 
mentals that abide and remain 
through all changes of time. The 
ordinances and regulations estab- 
lished by the lesser law of Moses 
were given to Israel because they 
would not receive the fulness of 
the Gospel ; when these were ful- 
filled in Christ the higher law came 
up again and the people had to 
stand by that; and connected with 
it and part of it is that fundamental 
law, or those fundamental princi- 
ples contained in the Ten Com- 
mandments. Let us remember 
them and at the same time let us 
stand fast as Paul said in that lib- 
erty in which Christ has made us 
free — free from the bondage of sin, 
free from the tyranny of vices, 
free from control by those appe- 
tities and passions which sway the 
multitude, and let us be chaste and 



pure and holy in our practice and 
in our spirit, and with charity in 
our hearts and that love toward 
God and mankind which is a part of 
true charity, let us carry on the 
work of God and preach to the na- 
tions of the earth that which we 
know to be essential to their salva- 
tion — salvation in time, salvation in 
eternity ! 

I thank the Lord for this glori- 
ous gospel and for the truths 
that He has revealed and for the 
knowledge that He has given me 
concerning them which has been 
with me from the beginning and 
remains until today. Glory and 
praise be unto His holy name for 
ever and ever, for the truth which 
He has revealed which shall abide 
forever and may God help us every 
one to be true to the covenants that 
we have made, and stand by the 
faith which He has revealed to us 
and aid in the preservation of the 
liberties of our glorious country, 
that we with the good and the true 
among men may rejoice in 'the 
blessings of civil and religious and 
political liberty. Amen.

"Once to every man and nation 

Comes the moment to decide, 
In the strife of truth with falsehood, 

For the good or evil side ; 
Some great cause — God's new Messiah, 

Offering each the bloom or blight, 
Parts the goats upon the left hand an'd 

The sheep upon the right, 
And the choice goes by forever 

'Twixt that darkness and that light." 

"We believe all that God has re- 
vealed, all that He does now reveal, 
and we believe that He will yet 
reveal many great and important 
things pertaining to the kingdom of 
God." The Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints stands com- 
mitted irrevocably to this position; 
the only safe position for a people 
to assume when they are dealing 
with that God who framed in the 
eternal heavens the Gospel of life 
and salvation, and decreed that it 
should be the means of man's prog- 
ress and glory in time and in eter- 
nity. The neglect of this important 
truth has brought upon the human 
race the most serious calamities 
that it has ever suffered. 

During a recent indisposition, 
which confined me to my home for 
several days, I perused, not for the 
first time, the life of the Apostle 
Paul, reading along with it the epis- 
tles of St. Paul and the Acts of the 
Apostles. I was struck more force- 
fully than ever with the general sim- 
ilarity between the experiences of 
.that great man, that mighty apostle 
"of Jesus Christ, and the experiences 
of another great man, another 
mighty apostle of our Lord, namely, 
the Prophet Joseph Smith. I could 
almost imagine myself reading the 
history of the modern prophet while 
poring over the biography of the 
ancient apostle. True there are 
great differences between them. 
Joseph Smith was never a persecu- 
tor of the Church of God, nor a 



persecutor of any man or men, and 
when he closed his career he was 
slain by an irresponsible mob, while 
Paul was the victim of a judicial 
murder, a legal' execution. Could 
Joseph have been slain legally, it 
would probably have been done in 
that way; but after he had been' 
tried and acquitted many times, his 
enemies came to this conclusion: 
"The law cannot reach him, but 
powder and ball shall." 

Paul describes some of his ex- 
periences in these words : 

"Of the Jews, five times received 
I forty stripes save one; 

"Thrice was I beaten with rods; 
once was I stoned ; thrice I suffered 
shipwreck ; a night and a day I have 
been in the deep ; 

"In journeyings often ; in perils 
of waters ; in perils of robbers ; in 
perils by mine own countrymen; in 
perils by the heathen; in perils in 
the city ; in perils in the wilderness ; 
in perils in the sea ; in perils among 
false brethren ; 

"In weariness and painfulness; in 
watchings often ; in hunger and 
thirst ; in fastings often ; in cold and 
nakedness ; 

"Besides those things that are 
without, that which cometh upon me 
daily, the care of all the churches ; 

"Who is weak, and I am not 
weak ; who is offended, and I burn 
not?"— II Corinthians 2:24-29. 

The mind wearies and the heart 
aches while reading of Paul's tribu- 
lations ; and the same is true as to 
the sufferings of the Prophet 
Joseph. 

What was it all about? What 
was the cause of all these troubles 
and trials? Why were these men 
persecuted and finally put to death ? 
Paul was condemned by the Em- 
peror Nero and beheaded at Rome 
in the year A. D. 66. Joseph, with 



70 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



his brother Hyrum, was shot to 
death at Carthage, Illinois, June 27, 
1844. Paul was accused of a capital 
crime ; he was one of a body of peo- 
ple who were accused of setting fire 
to the great city of Rome. It was 
a false charge, but under it he was 
condemned and executed. Joseph 
was also accused falsely — charged 
with riot and treason — thrust into 
prison to await trial, and while 
there murdered by a mob that broke 
into the jail. These are the surface 
reasons for the death of those noble 
men. 

But what was the real reason? 
Deep down, fundamentally, what 
was it that brought about the death 
of the Apostle Paul and . the death 
of the Prophet Joseph? The fun- 
damental reason was this : They 
were servants of God, and Satan 
wanted them out of the way. They 
stood as "lions in the path," and 
were building up God's kingdom in 
His own appointed way. Both 
these men had looked upon the face 
of Deity. Paul had been "caught up 
to the third heaven," Joseph to the 
"seventh heaven," and had there 
"heard things unlawful to be ut- 
tered." Each was a divinely com- 
. missioned preacher of the gospel at 
the opening of a new dispensation. 

What do we mean by a gospel 
dispensation ? We mean the open- 
ing of the heavens after a period 
of darkness and degeneracy, and 
the sending forth or dispensing of 
spiritual light for the salvation of 
mankind ; the sending forth also of 
divine authority, without which no 
man can be qualified to preach the 
gospel or administer its sacred or- 
dinances. And these men, each in 
his time, stood as a proclaimer and 
an authorized minister of the re- 
stored gospel. Yes, the restored 
gospel : Paul preached no new gos- 



pel. There is only one gospel, as 
he told the Galatians : "I marvel 
that ye are so soon removed from 
him who called you into the grace 
of Christ, unto another gospel. 
Which is not another, but there be 
some who would trouble you and 
pervert the gospel of Christ ; but 
though we or an angel from heaven 
preach any other gospel unto you 
than that which we have preached 
unto you, * * * * than that 
which ye have received, let him be 
accursed." 

The gospel that Paul preached 
was the gospel that Adam had 
preached; the gospel that Enoch 
had preached ; that Noah had 
preached; that Abraham had 
preached; and that Moses had 
preached ; for we are told in mod- 
ern revelation that Moses had the 
fulness of the Gospel, with the 
Melchisedek Priesthood, and that if 
Israel had been willing at that time, 
Moses would have sanctified them 
by the gospel, by the priesthood, and 
they as well as he would have been 
admitted into the presence of the 
Lord. But they would have none of 
it ; they were unworthy of it ; were 
not ready for it ; had not progressed 
to that degree that they could re- 
ceive the fulness of the gospel ; and 
so it was taken, with Moses and the 
Melchisedek priesthood, and Israel 
was left for fifteen hundred years 
under the rule of the Aaronic or 
lesser priesthood, with the Mosaic • 
law — the law of carnal command- 
ments. These continued, in a more 
or less degenerate state, until the 
coming of John the Baptist and the 
Lord Jesus Christ. 

What did Jesus ask of the Jews? 
Did he propose to destroy what they 
had that was true and good and 
wise and praiseworthy? No. 
"Think not I come to destroy, but

to fulfill." This had reference to 
such observances as sacrifice, cir- 
cumcision and the Passover; it did 
not affect the Ten Commandments, 
which are still in force, nor the 
Prophecies, many of which are yet 
to be fulfilled. He asked them to 
lay aside the obsolete, that which 
had fulfilled its purpose, and to ac- 
cept of something better, even the 
fulness of the Gospel, to prepare 
them for which the Law of Moses 
had been given — "a school master," 
as Paul puts it, "to bring us to 
Christ." This was what the new 
dispensation meant : Come up 
higher ! "You have heard it said 
aforetime, Thou shalt love thy 
neighbor, and hate thine enemy ; but 
I say unto you, love your enemies, 
pray for them that despitefully use 
you and persecute you." "Be ye 
perfect, even as your Father in 
Heaven is perfect ; for He makes 
His sun to rise on the evil and on 
the good, and sends His rain upon 
the just and upon the unjust." And 
they were "astonished at the 1 doc- 
trine ;" because for fifteen centuries 
they had been schooled under a 
lesser law, and were now required 
to take the higher law for their 
guidance : to stand upon a broader, 
grander platform, and practice the 
fulness of the religion of Jesus 
Christ. Only a few were willing to 
do this : "He came unto His own, 
and His own received Him not, but 
to such as did receive Him," both 
Jews and Gentiles, "gave He power 
to become the sons of God." And 
because the great mass of the Jew- 
ish race were unwilling to lay aside 
the obsolete law of Moses and ac- 
cept the living law of the Christ, 
they rejected their Messiah, whom 
they had been expecting for cen- 
turies, crucified the Son of God, and 
persecuted His followers. The real 



reason for the martyrdom of such 
men as Paul and Peter was this: 
The world, while willing to believe, 
in part, what God had revealed, was 
not willing to accept a new revela- 
tion, for which the former revela- 
tion was intended to prepare them. 

The same was true when Joseph 
the Prophet announced the open- 
ing of the last dispensation. What 
did he demand of the world? Did 
he ask them to throw away anything 
that was good, that was useful, that 
was still in force and had been since 
the days of Moses and Paul? No; 
God's servants have never required 
this of mankind. Joseph called upon 
Christendom, not to turn its back 
upon the Redeemer, not to lose its 
faith in Jesus Christ, not to throw 
away anything that ,was precious, 
that was designed to endure, not 
having accomplished its mission. 
Like his divine Master he came not 
to destroy but to fulfill ; he called 
upon men to receive something bet- 
ter than they already possessed — ■ 
even the restored Gospel, restored 
for the last time, in this the ' dis- 
pensation of the fulness of times, 
into which all other dispensations 
flow, as rivers into the ocean ; — the 
time of the second coming of the 
Son of God ; of the great Millen- 
nium of peace and good will — the 
morning of the glorious resurrec- 
tion, when the dead in Christ shall 
rise to meet the Lord, as. He comes 
with His Saints in the clouds of 
heaven to reign over His people. 

This is "Mormonism's" message 
to the world — it is not a message of 
war but of peace ; not a message of 
destruction but of conservation. It 
call': upon the Christian world and 
upon all men to abandon their life- 
less, worn-out creeds ; to throw 
away all that is false and worth- 
less — the doctrines of men and the 



72 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



ci< ctrines of devils, and come back 
into the light, into the path that 
God has marked out. That is all; 
and this is what brought about the 
death of Joseph Smith — not the 
abatement of the Nauvoo Exposi- 
tor, nor the calling out of the 
Legion to defend the city against 
mobs and despoilers. That is only 
the surface reason. The deep- 
rooted, fundamental reason is this : 
The world was unwilling, as ever, 
to give up its false traditions, to be- 
lieve all that God had revealed, that 
it might be prepared for what He 
will yet reveal before man can be 
made perfect and the kingdom of 
God firmly established. 
: The Christian world, however, is 
beginning to be conscious of its de- 
fects, is beginning to realize its 
need 'of new light and help from 
God. At the Autumnal Assembly 
of British Congregationalists, Oc- 
tober, 1910, one of the topics under 
discussion was : "Is the Church 
Losing Her Hold Upon Men?" The 
Reverend David Walters, of Leeds, 
expressed himself as follows: "I 
have heard it said over and over 
again ; when you preachers of re- 
ligion decide among yourselves 
what we ought to believe, we shall 
be ready to listen. It is not a mere 
excuse ; it is the expression of 
weariness with uncertainty. Differ- 
ent preachers not only contradict' 
one another, but very few of us, if 
any, preach with that accent of as- 
surance which carries conviction. 
We cannot make the people believe 
more, or more deeply and strongly, 
than, we do ourselves. We do not 
know where we are. Hesitation is 
never inspiring. I believe that we 
shall get out of this period of un- 
certainty, and that God will raise 
up in His own time, when condi- 
tions are favorable, another Paul, 



or Augustine, or Calvin, who will 
interpret for us our great gospel in 
terms that will be real and convinc- 
ing to the modern mind. It will be 
a newer theology than anything we 
have yet had ; and yet it will be 
recognized as the old. The hearts 
of men will leap in response to it 
and will say : This is true ; this is 
what we have been waiting for ; and 
we shall all preach it with a con- 
sciousness that we are in line with 
all the faithful preachers of the past, 
and yet that we preach in language 
that is understood by the present 
generation." The Bishop of Liver- 
pool, in a sermon delivered at the 
Holy Trinity Church, Southport, 
March 20, 1912, said that "the 
church at present seemed almost 
overmatched by the powers of dark- 
ness. Sometimes it seemed as if 
the darkness was gaining on the 
light. What was the cause of this 
strange paralysis that had befallen 
the church? He believed that the 
church needed to day a re-discovery 
of God; he believed that the church 
was weak today because God was 
so distant, so unreal, so dimly seen 
today. They saw the results of that 
dim vision of the distant God ; they 
saw on all sides unsettlement in the 
faith, slackness in the spiritual life, 
men losing their grip on those great 
and vital truths which made Chris- 
tendom what it was. 

The only serious fault that can be 
found with such utterances as these 
is the fact that they predict some- 
thing that has already come to pass. 
There has been "a re-discovery of 
God," and as the result, thousands, 
yea, tens, hundreds of thousands, 
are today worshiping the true and 
living God, who is no more like the 
dim and distant God of modern 
Christendom than heaven is like 
earth or substance like shadow.

The new "Paul" has come; the new 
Gospel, which is the old, restored by 
heavenly messengers, interpreted by 
living oracles, to the joy of many 
honest souls is being preached again 
in all the world as a witness before 
the end comes. 

And history is repeating itself : 
The Jews were expecting a Mes- 
siah, but when He came they cruci- 
fied Him, and still went on expect- 
ing him to come. The Christian 
world has put to death the prophets 
of God, sent as forerunners of the 
Messiah's second advent. What will 
be its attitude toward the One who 
sent them? Let us hope, for the 
honor of the human race, that when 
the glorified Christ has come, and is 
sitting upon His sovereign throne, 
with all nations before' Him, there 
will be no Latter-day Saint, no 
Christian, no Jew, no Gentile, who, 
after gazing upon His glorious 
countenance, after meeting Him 
face to face, will still be looking 
forth for the time of his coming. 

Profesor Evan Stephens' anthem, 
"Grant Us Peace," was sung by the 
choir, Sarah L. Wood and James 
Moncar rendering the solo parts. 

Benediction was pronounced by 
Elder Serge L. Baliff. 

Conference adjourned until 2 
o. m. 



OVERFLOW MEETING. 

An overflow session of the Con- 
ference was held in the Assembly 
Hall, adjoining the Tabernacle, at 
10 a. m., Sunday, Oct. 6th, 1912. 
The services were presided over by 
Elder Joseph F. Smith, Jr. 

The Seventeenth ward choir, un- 
der direction of James H. Neilson, 
rendered the musical exercises. 



The choir sang the hymn : 

A poor wayfaring man of grief 

Hath often crossed me on the way, 

Who sued so humbly for relief 
That I could never answer, Nay. 

Prayer was offered by Elder Fer- 
dinand F. Hintze. 

The choir sang the hymn : 

Oh, happy is the man who hears 
Instruction's warning voice! 

And who celestial wisdom makes 
His early, only choice. 

ELDER LEWIS ANDERSON. 

(President of South Sanpete Stake.) 

I am very grateful, my brethren 
and sisters, for the privilege of at- 
tending this conference, for the op- 
portunity of association with you, 
and for the privilege of hearing the 
splendid instructions that have been 
given unto us in the sessions of this 
conference. This morning, while I 
address you for a few moments, I 
greatly desire that I may have the 
Spirit of the Lord to suggest unto 
me something that may be of value 
to those that have assembled here, 
and that I may have your faith and 
prayers to this end. 

I am very grateful for . a testi- 
mony of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, 
and that He has revealed unto us in 
this dispensation the fulness of the 
everlasting gospel, with all its or- 
dinances and blessings. The Church 
has been greatly prospered and 
blessed, in that so great a multitude 
of people have been brought to- 
gether in these mountain vales, and 
for the prosperity of the work of 
the Lord, which bears testimony 
unto us that the Lord has answered 
the wishes of His servants, and the 
predictions of his Prophets have 
come to pass in these latter days.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



It is but a short time since the Lord 
spoke from the heavens unto his 
servant the Prophet Joseph, and re- 
vealed unto him the things that He 
was about to accomplish in the 
earth; and through him the gospel 
in its fulness, with all its gifts and 
blessings, has been bestowed upon 
thousands of the children of men in 
the earth. The predictions of His 
servants have been verified, which 
is a great testimony unto us ; part of 
that fulfillment we see here today in 
the great gatherings that are now 
in session in this conference. 

We have been partakers of the 
blessings of the gospel of Jesus 
Christ. We have yielded obedience 
to the first principles thereof, hav- 
ing faith in the Lord Jesus Christ 
and in God, the Eternal Father, 
having repented of our sins, show- 
ing that we desired to come near 
unto the Father; and we have re- 
ceived the ordinance of baptism for 
the remission of our sins, and the 
laying on of hands for the gift -of 
the Holy Ghost. We have also par- 
ticipated in all other blessings that 
have been given unto the Saints. I 
believe that there is a unanimous 
feeling among our people that these 
principles are essential unto salva- 
tion, that it needs be that we yield 
obedience to them in order to enter 
into the kingdom of our Father, 
that we might become members of 
the Church of Christ. We are 
united, I believe, in regard to all the 
principles and ordinances of the 
gospel that have been revealed. 
Naturally we feel that there is much 
that is required of us as Latter-day 
Saints, after receiving all these 
blessings, the living according to 
gospel laws, living up to these prin- 
ciples in our every day life. 

We covenant with God, our 
Heavenly Father, that we will do 



His will, that we will keep the com- 
mandments that He has given unto 
us, and by reason of yielding obe- 
dience to these requirements it is 
expected of us that our lives will 
conform to the principles revealed 
from heaven, not only outward 
ordinances, but in all the labors and 
duties that devolve upon us, and 
that are made known unto us from 
day to day by the servants of the 
Lord. Honorable lives ought to 
be led by 'us, absolute honesty with 
our fellow men, with all the world, 
that our light may thus shine forth 
to the inhabitants of the earth that 
they may really see our good works 
and glorify our Father. In these 
things, my brethren and sisters ; 
living every day acording to the 
gospel, speaks volumes and is more 
impressive than word can tell. Per- 
forming our duties, whether home 
or abroad, preaching the gospel, 
delivering the message we have re- 
ceived to those that do not know nor 
understand the things of the Lord, 
these duties rest upon us as Latter- 
day Saints. Also the building up 
of the Church of Christ at home— 
and how can this be done? It can 
be done by our good works, in 
remembering our tithes and our 
offerings unto the Lord, that we 
might be like unto Jacob of old, 
when he made ' a covenant with the 
Lord that, if He would pour out 
His blessings upon him, he would 
give unto Him that which belonged 
to Him, even one-tenth of all that 
the Lord should bless him with. We 
as Latter-day Saints should observe 
fully this command of the Lord, this 
revelation given unto us in these the 
latter days, that it be not a half- 
hearted deceiving of ourselves and 
the Lord, by reason of our unfaith- 
fulness in this particular. 

The duties of Latter-day Saints 



ELDER LEWIS ANDERSON. 



75 



include laboring for the betterment 
of mankind at home in our stakes 
of Zion, in the wards thereof, per- 
forming our duties as Latter-day 
Saints, servants and hand maidens 
of the Lord, that our lives may be 
clean, upright, and honorable before 
God and all men. To observe and 
keep holy the Sabbath day is en- 
joined upon us. I am sorry to say 
that there are those that profess to 
be Latter-day Saints who do not 
faithfully observe this command of 
the Lord, in gathering to the house 
of worship upon that day and hold- 
ing sacred that which the Lord has 
commanded us to do. I feel that, un- 
less we more strictly observe this 
duty, the Spirit of the Lord will 
in a great measure withdraw from 
us. When we fail to offer prayers 
unto our Father in Heaven, in the 
house of God and in our homes the 
Spirit of the Lord will be with- 
drawn, and a spirit of darkness 
come over us. 

I am persuaded that, unless we 
observe the commandments of the 
Lord, there is great danger of our 
losing His Spirit, and our minds 
consequently become darkened. We 
have found that, by reason of not 
observing these things in the time 
and season thereof, it leads to find- 
ing fault with those whom God has 
chosen to preside in the midst of 
His people, therefore we need to 
carefully observe all these com- 
mandments of the Lord. 

We also owe a great and import- 
ant duty unto our kindred dead. 
The gospel of Jesus Christ is being 
preached not' only to the living but 
also to the dead, and it is a sacred 
duty of Latter-day Saints that they 
also perform the ordiances that are 
required to redeem the dead. The 
Gospel of Jesus Christ is not nar- 
rowed up to the few people who 



have obeyed it in life, but it extends 
to all the human family, to all of 
God's children that will accept its 
conditions in the spirit world. In 
this dispensation and time the Lord 
has graciously permitted us to rear 
temples wherein the ordinances 
necessary to the salvation of the 
dead may be attended to. I some- 
times think that we do not fully 
appreciate all these blessings that 
we enjoy. 

I hope and pray that the spirit 
of the gospel of Christ may rest 
abundantly upon the Saints, that 
the spirit of temple work, may rest 
upon them, that they may diligently 
accomplish this work that is re- 
quired at their hands, because, as 
the Scripture says, we cannot be 
made perfect without our ancestors, 
neither can they be made perfect 
without us. Therefore, this is a 
great responsibility that is resting 
upon us as Latter-day Saints. I 
contemplate with great pleasure and 
satisfaction what the Lord has done 
to open the way for His people to 
obtain their genealogies in the var- 
ious lands of the earth, and in our 
glorious country, how that the Lord 
has moved upon the children of men 
to prepare the records of their kin- 
dred. It seems to me that this 
ought to be greatly appreciated by 
us. This spirit is manifest in all the 
nations of the earth, in every civil- 
ized land men are being moved up- 
on to accomplished this work. We 
know and understand the great im- 
portance of this thing. We ought 
to be thankful for it, and while the 
day lasts we ought to be workers, 
because the time will come when no 
man can work along this line. 
Therefore, while it is today, it is 
our duty as well as our privilege 
to accomplish what we can for the 
salvation of our kindred dead, be- 



76 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



cause we know that the Savior of 
the world laid the foundation of 
this work. We read of Him going 
to the spirit world, and preaching 
to the spirits that were in prison, 
those that were disobedient in times 
past, being given another oppor- 
tunity to receive the Gospel message 
that He delivered to the living, and 
afterward delivered to the dead 
likewise. We know the reasons for 
these things. We know that this 
should be, because the dead will be 
judged just the same as the living, 
and we are privileged to do this 
glorious work for them vicariously. 

I feel, my brethren and sisters, to 
ask the Lord to bless us to this 
end. May we do our full duty. 
May we uphold and sustain God's 
servants. I bear you my testimony 
that they are in the right place, and 
that they are inspired of Almighty 
God. I thank my Father in heaven 
for them, and may His blessing be 
upon us, is my prayer, in the name 
of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER JOSEPH E. ROBINSON. 

(President of California Mission.) 

My brethren and sisters, my 
soul has been enlarged for the love 
of my fellow men through the 
teachings of our leaders during this 
conference, and it has been added 
upon with. the living word of the 
Lord, and a desire to serve Him 
and keep His commandments. 

In the remarks of President 
Smith, at the beginning of our con- 
ference, he made it clear to us that 
no untoward thing had come except 
it was designed for our experience 
and our good, that even when our 
people were driven from Ohio, 
Missouri and Illinois, as well as 
those that made an exodus from 
Mexico, it is for some purpose, to 



serve the best good of the Saints at 
large. At first blush, we do not al- 
ways recognize the hand of God in 
His providences in vicissitudes that 
come upon us ; but when we look 
over the history of the nations, when 
we see the effect upon the lives of 
men in the generations that follow 
them, we can then determine more 
fully and more perfectly the influ- 
ence that men have had, and the 
good that has come to the nations 
because of having wrought out their 
destiny. Apropos of this, we 
might look at ancient Israel. It 
was for their salvation, the salvation 
of the family of Jacob, that they 
were cabled down into Egypt. 
Again, it was for their salvation 
that they were called out, for doubt- 
less in that land they would have 
become effeminate as the Egyptians 
have become effeminate. They 
would have followed after the flesh- 
pots of Egypt that they hungered 
and yearned after when they were 
in the wilderness. It is the history 
of all nations who have lived in such 
countries as Egypt, and particularly 
in the low hot lands of any of the 
countries of the earth, that in time 
they have become effeminate, have 
lost their powers of resistance. 
They have become followers of 
pleasure rather than followers of 
God. They have become listless 
and indolent in their habits, instead 
of active and full of work. And so 
the Lord, with an outstretched arm 
and a strong hand, brought them 
out of Egypt into the mountains 
and plains of Palestine, where they 
might be taught the way of truth 
and righteousness. Those who 
knew the way of the Egyptians were 
permitted to die, or were kept at 
least in the wilderness until they 
died, and only the new generation, 
those who were possessed of new 



ELDER JOSEPH E. ROBINSON. 



77 



ideals and new habits and traditions 
were permitted to go to the prom- 
ised land. 

From that people have come the 
most vigorous stock of all the world, 
a nation that has kept its race, its 
religion, its customs, through all 
time Though preyed upon by other 
nations, imprisoned and made 
slaves, a hiss and a by-word, scat- 
tered, driven and peeled, still for 
all that the Jew today is the Jew of 
David's time, and the Jew of the 
days of Jerusalem when it was the 
Holy City; and the doctrines which 
they were taught of sanitation, the 
doctrines in part of the gospel which 
would bring them as a schoolmaster 
to Christ, have kept them intact as 
a people until this day. The peoples 
who occupied the countries of 
Europe, who lived in the mountain 
sections have been the most indomi- 
table in courage and in perseverence, 
and in maintaining and upholding 
human liberties. They have become 
the pioneers and explorers of the 
world. Little Switzerland, for 500 
years surrounded by empires and 
kingdoms, preserved her indivdual- 
ity and autonomy as a republic. 
From the hills of Sweden and Nor- 
way, and the vine-clad hills of Ger- 
many, even the chalk hills of little, 
sea-girt, England came the hardy 
peoples who have pioneered and 
explored the earth, and who have 
kept, more or less, their integrity, 
and their individuality, and their 
characteristics through all time so 
far as history accounts for them. 

So in this land of America, most 
of our great leaders have come from 
the uplands of New Hampshire, the 
Green Mountains of Vermont and 
the hills of Virginia. So we may 
well sing, as we did yesterday- — 



"For the strength of the hills we bless 
thee, 

Our God, our Fathers' God. 
Thou hast made thy children mighty 
By the touch of the mountain sod." 

This is in fulfillment of scripture. 
This is the destiny of the Latter-day 
Saints or modern Isreal, that they 
should come to these mountains, 
that in them and by them and 
through them, in part, they might 
partake of that same sturdy nature 
as the nations who have occupied 
the uplands and mountain plains of 
the old world, and who have got 
away from the low lands. And so 
today, I can see, my - brethren and 
sisters, the providences of God, in 
our people being called out from the 
low lands of Missouri and of Ill- 
inois and brought to these moun- 
tains, and too it was in fulfillment 
of scriptures. From reading some 
of the remarks of our early brethren 
in the Church, it appears they did 
not think that they were going away 
from Ohio, and when they had come 
to Far West, they felt that there was 
the boundary line and that our peo- 
ple were destined to build up the 
center stake of Zion, and not come 
into these mountains, and it was 
with aching hearts, and with tear 
dimmed eyes, and with lagging feet 
that many of them made their way 
across the great wilderness of the 
west to this land. I can understand 
how one of our pioneer sisters felt 
when she looked over this valley, 
which was then a sea of shimmer- 
ing sage and salt — no place to rest 
the eye, no green to enliven the 
scene, but all a dead sage color, 
when she felt in her heart that she 
had been brought here to die, that 
she would rather have gone back 
and met mobocracy with all of its 
hate than to have sojourned here. 



78 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



But today we are made to rejoice, 
and the hills and the valleys sing 
because of us, and the fields pour 
forth of their fulness, and the des- 
erts have blossomed, and in the wil- 
derness spring's have broken forth. 
So Israel rejoices in the fact, and as 
one visitor said last week in our 
Congress here, "We rejoice in this 
incomparable city." Isaiah said 
"Beautiful for location is Mount 
Zion, situate upon the sides of the 
North. The joy of the whole earth 
is Zion." 

I want to read to you just a little 
from these scriptures to bear out my 
point that we came here not by acci- 
dent. Nor is it merely an incident 
in our history, but it was the design 
of the Almighty that here might 
His children find a place of refuge 
and rest. David anciently declared : 
"Get thee up into the high moun- 
tains, thou that bring glad tidings 
and that publisheth peace." And 
Isaiah tells us : "Come, my people, 
into thy chambers, and shut thy 
doors about thee. Hide thyself, as 
it were, for a little moment, until 
the indignation be overpassed ; for 
behold, the Lord cometh unto His 
people, to punish the inhabitants of 
the earth for their iniquity. The 
earth also shall disclose her blood, 
and shall no more cover her slain." 

If you will turn back to the early 
history of our Church, you will re- 
member that immediately in the 
wake of our expatriation from Illi- 
nois, there came the four years of 
fratricidal strife when father fought 
against son, brother against brother, 
that terminated "in the death and 
-misery" of a million souls, and no 
'end of property was destroyed. 
And it will be remembered that the 
contending bodies, those two great 
armies, came and made a camping 
ground and bivouac of the very 



country which our people inhab- 
ited, in Missouri and Illinois, espe- 
cially in Missouri, and if any one 
will read the history of Missouri, 
he will see there the dread penalties 
they paid for the persecutions 
heaped upon the Saints of God in 
the forties and the latter part of the 
thirties of the last century. We did 
not understand it then, but how 
would it have been had we remained 
in that land? Would we have lost 
our individuality as a people, be- 
tween the nether stone and the up- 
per stone, the millstones of war and 
strife, of hatred, of plundering and 
guerilla warfare, when whole dis- 
aricts were plundered and houses 
burned, the only witness seeming 
to be the chimneys pointing as with 
a solitary finger to God, and asking 
for vengeance upon those who had 
despoiled the hearthstones of those 
once happy homes? But we were 
gathered here, and shut in the cham- 
bers of the mountains, as God or- 
dained we should be, so many hun- 
dreds of years before, "till the in- 
dignation was overpassed," and the 
wicked and iniquitous of the earth 
had been made to suffer for their 
iniquity. 

Again, I want to say to you that 
we were to come here, for, Prophet 
as he was, David the King and 
sweet singer of Israel, foretold also 
the coming of Israel to this land, 
and sang in these words : 

"O give thanks unto the Lord, for he 
is good, and his mercy en'dureth forever. 
Let the redeemed of the Lord say so 
whom he hath redeemed from the hand 
of the enemy and gathered them out of 
the lands, from the east and from the 
west and from the north and from tha 
south." 

When Israel was brought out of 
Egypt they were not gathered from 
the east, nor out of the west, nor 



ELDER JOSEPH E.. ROBINSON. 



79 



from the north; but they came up 
out of the land of the south, and so 
this does not apply to ancient Israel, 
as our ministerial friends of the 
world would have us believe. "He 
gathered them from the lands of the 
west, the north and the south. They 
wandered in the wilderness in a 
solitary way," this Israel. "They 
found no cities to dwell in," and you 
remember ancient Israel found cities 
prepared for them. They over- 
turned Jericho, and they even came 
in and occupied the Holy City itself, 
the place where David dwelt, the 
place where Melchisedek doubtless 
had reigned as king, when Abraham 
paid tithes to him. But this Israel 
"wandered in a solitary way," where 
there was no place prepared for 
them. "They found no city to 
dwell in, hungering and thirsty, 
their soul fainted in them." They 
were not fed by manna from heaven. 
The bitter waters were not made 
sweet for latter-day Israel, but they 
hungered and thirsted in their jour- 
ney, and "they cried unto the Lord 
in their trouble, and he delivered 
them out of their distresses, and he 
led them forth by the right way, 
that they might go to a city of habi- 
tation." "O that men would praise 
the Lord, for his goodness and for 
his wonderful works to the children 
of men." Again, he says : 

"O that men would praise the Lord for 
His goodness ; let them exalt Him also 
in the congregation of the people and 
praise Him in the assembly of the elders. 
He turneth the wilderness into standing 
water and dry ground into water springs, 
and there he maketh the hungry to dwell, 
that they may prepare a city of habita- 
tion, and sow the field, and plant the 
vineyards which may yield the fruit of 
increase. He blesseth them also so that 
they are multiplied greatly, and suffereth 
not their cattle to decrease." 

I want to read just a little further 



from Isaiah, along this same line: 

"The wilderness and the solitary place 
shall be glad for them, and the desert 
shall rejoice and blossom as the rose. 
It shall blossom abundantly, and rejoice 
even with joy and dancing. The glory 
of Lebanon shall be given unto it, the 
excellency of Carmel and Sharon. They 
shall see the glory of the Lord and the 
excellency of our God." 

It was not to be Lebanon, nor was 
it to be Carmel or the plains of 
Sharon in Palestine that they should 
occupy, this latter-day Israel ; but 
their country should be made fruit- 
ful as Sharon, and as rich as her 
plain, and as rich in its strength and 
beauty as Lebanon with its forests, 
or as Carmel with her richness. 

"Strengthen the weak hands," said 
Isaiah, "and confirm the feeble knees. 
Say to them that are of fearful heart, 
Be strong, fear not. Behold, your God 
will come with vengeance, even God with 
a recompense. He will come and save 
you. Then the eyes of the blind shall 
be opened, and the ears of the deaf shall 
be unstopped. Then shall the lame man 
leap as an hart, and the tongue of the 
dumb man shall sing, for in the wilder- 
ness shall waters break out, and streams 
in the desert; and the barren ground 
shall become a pool; and an highway 
shall be there, and it shall be called the 
way of holiness. The unclean shall not 
pass over it, but it shall be for those, the 
wayfaring man, though a fool, shall not 
err therein. No lion shall be there, nor 
any ravenous beast. The redeemed of 
the Lord shall walk there, and the ran- 
somed of the Lord shall return and come 
to Zion with songs of everlasting joy 
upon their heads. They shall obtain joy 
and gladness, and sorrow and sighing 
shall flee away." 

Tsaiah goes on to tell of this lat- 
ter-day Israel, saying: 

"Thy watchman shall lift up the 
voice, and with a voice together 
shall they sing, for they shall see 
eye to eye when the Lord shall bring 
again Zion," proving in this state- 
ment that a Zion was to be brought 



80 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



again. It was not the old Zion he 
was speaking of, but a Zion that 
was to be brought again when the 
watchmen should see eye to eye — 
discourse with the same testimony, 
preach the same gospel, tell of the 
same providences of God and should 
be united in their faith. That was 
to be the condition "when the Lord 
should bring again Zion." "Sor- 
row and sadness were to flee away," 
and there was to be heard therein 
the song of praise with the psalter 
and with the harp, and even with 
the dance. There should be heard 
also the voice of singing and of 
melody. These things are charac- 
teristic of our people, and go to 
prove what I said in the beginning, 
in quoting the President in the 
opening address of conference, that 
it is not by accident but by design, 
in fulfillment of prophecy and in the 
providences of our God that these 
things have come to us, which, at 
first blush, we look upon as an un- 
toward ill; and if we can see His 
providences, should we not look 
upon it as an earnest for our future, 
and that we should not question the 
providence of God nor doubt His in- 
finite love, remembering that we are 
just "as close to Him as any child 
to the nursing place," as one of the 
poets has said, and that He loves 
us, and counts us, and cares for us 
as he cares for the least of all His 
creatures, for He is a compassion- 
ate Father and is not unmindful of 
the least of His creatures. 

I have had much to build up my 
faith in the providences of the Lord 
in meeting with our people upon the 
borderland of Mexico, having been 
commissioned to assist in bringing 
them out of that republic, and it 
might do you a little good if you 
knew some of the proofs that I re- 
ceived that made me so proud of 



my people, a people whose interests 
are my interests and with whom my 
children are identified. I met some 
of them at the station as they came 
in from Mexico. I looked down 
into the afrighted eyes of little chil- 
dren, and could see that, despite the 
fact that it was their first visit to a 
modern city of electric lights, auto- 
mobiles, street cars and all that is 
incident to the traffic and turmoil of 
a busy city, it did not wean them 
away from the fear, and the dread 
and the terror that was seen in their 
little eyes, as they lifted up their 
faces to greet friends who awaited 
them at the station. As I looked in 
the faces of the women I read the 
tale told by tears dried upon their 
cheeks as they drew their little ones 
to their breasts and hurried through 
the crowd, seeking shelter in this 
blessed land of liberty. I could tell 
just a little of the stress under 
which they labored ; and when men 
stalked by, heedless of all things 
about them, silent, gaunt, and red- 
eyed through w T atching, with lips 
split and blistered with the dust and 
winds of the mountains and plains 
— I could understand, I say, a little 
of the stress that had driven them 
out from that country. When I 
heard men, grown grey in the faith, 
men who have borne the burden in 
the heat of the day, men who have 
laid their all upon the altar of God, 
men who have spent thirty years 
and more in that land, for the sake 
of that people, and who love them 
as a man loves his firstborn, for that 
is the way that missionaries learn to 
love the people they labor among; 
and I heard men of that kind say 
that if they had not left that land 
there would have been bloodshed, I 
felt what they meant. It was not 
because they were afraid their lives 
would be taken, but they were

afraid they would kill some Mexi- 
can. That was the proposition, and 
to keep their hands clean and un- 
stained of blood they came out with 
their wives and children, and left all 
their possessions behind them. I 
sought the family of an elder in the 
mission field, and found his wife 
with her little ones, gathered to- 
gether in one house of sixteen 
rooms, with 115 souls and not a 
curtain at a window, nor a blind, 
not a chair to sit upon, not a rug, 
not one thing for comfort, the little 
ones lying upon the bare floor, with 
a few blankets that the mothers 
were able to gather hastily about 
them when they made their exodus ; 
and, when they greeted me, what do 
you think was the first thing they 
said to me — "Sing to us, Brother 
Robinson ; sing 'We will go wher.e 
you want us to go, dear Lord." I 
couldn't sing for tears. But it was 
to me a new testimony of the in- 
tegrity and the worth, the courage 
and devotion, the unbounded faith 
of the Latter-day Saints. Where 
else under the sun could you go and 
find a people who were driven and 
peeled as they were there, as some 
of you were when you were driven 
from Illinois, when you were scat- 
tered from Cottage Grove to Flor- 
ence or Winter Quarters, as you 
called it ? — when, in the brief season 
you stayed in Florence, you had dug 
600 graves, and yet you could say: 

"Come, come, ye Saints, no toil nor labor 
fear, 

But with joy wend your way. 
Though hard to you this journey may 
appear 

Grace shall be as your day." 

And then add, in your refrain as 
you made your way over the dreary 
plain, unmarked save try the graves 
of those who had preceded you — • 



"And should we die before our journey's 
through, 
Happy day, all is well ! 
We then are free from toil and sorrow, 
too, 

With the just we shall dwell." 

And I heard them sing this song 
in the camps at El Paso and on the 
plains of Hachita in New Mexico, 
and Douglas, Arizona. I heard some 
of them singing this same hymn, 
"I'll go where you want me to go, 
dear Lord," and "My Father knows 
how frail I am to meet my foes," 
and yet He gave them strength. 
These were the hymns they sang; 
these were the prayers they said, 
and this was the faith they exhib- 
ited. And does it not make one feel 
that his lot is cast with the best 
people of the earth, a God-fearing 
people, a people that trust God and 
question not His providences? It 
may be that modern Israel has been 
called out of Egypt for a purpose. 
For a purpose they went into Mex- 
ico. It may be now they are called 
out because the purpose for which 
our people went into Mexico was 
achieved. Now they have been 
given an opportunity, perchance, as 
ancient Israel was, to find better 
homes and to answer best the end 
of their creation and destiny, with 
an assurance and a success that may 
never have come to them in that 
land. 

I bear testimony to the truth of 
the Gospel. I bear testimony to the 
truthfulness of the testimony of our 
brethren who stand at the head of 
the Church. I bear testimony to the 
truth of God's word as revealed in 
ancient and in modern scriptures. 
My heart is made to exult in the 
fact that I am able to see in the 
promises that are vouchsafed to us, 
if we are but faithful and true, the 
glorious reward for which we seek.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



"Let us," my brethren and sisters, 
"keep the faith, finish the course, 
fight the good fight, and henceforth 
there is laid up for us a crown of 
righteousness, which God, the just 
judge, will give to all those that 
love Him and His appearance," 
which may it be our happy lot to 
realize, is my prayer, in the name of 
Jesus. Amen. 

The anthem, "Praise to God, im- 
mortal praise," was rendered by the 
choir, Jennie U. Davis and Jacob 
A. Van Dueren sang the duets. 

ELDEE BEN E. RICH. 

(President of Eastern States Mission.) 

I realize that the time is growing 
short, and there is another speaker 
to follow me, hence the necessity of 
being as brief as possible in the re- 
marks that I may make. 

In this congregation, I see a num- 
ber of young men who have labored 
under my direction as missionaries 
during the past fourteen and a half 
years, and I have received the con- 
sent of Brother Joseph F. Smith, 
Jr., who presides over this meeting, 
to call here to my side, if they are 
present in the congregation, Elders 
W. A. Casper and Ray Gardner. If 
those two young men are here I 
desire them to come forward at 
once, and stand by my side for a 
few moments. I want to introduce 
to you these two young men, and 
make a few remarks. (A young 
man came forward and stood beside 
the speaker.) This is Elder Ray 
Gardner ; I suppose that Elder Cas- 
per is in the Tabernacle. 

These two young men that I have 
named have been very faithful mis- 
sionaries, in the Eastern States Mis- 
sion. From time to time we trans- 
ferred them from one conference 



to another, and quite usually we 
allowed them to walk to their new 
fields of labor. A little over six 
months ago these two young men 
were transferred from the confer- 
ence in which they were then labor- 
ing, in West Virginia, and were 
instructed to travel to Salt Lake 
City without purse or scrip, and to 
report to me at this conference. Six 
months ago yesterday, they took 
their grips, and set their faces to- 
ward the setting sun, and traveled 
toward Zion. They reached here 
yesterday. They made the journey 
on foot. They have made their re- 
ports to the Eastern States mission, 
like other missionaries do, once a 
week. They have preached the gos- 
pel, and sought food and shelter 
while on their way, and during that 
•six months' traveling, without purse 
or scrip, ordering their literature 
from the mission headquarters, in 
New York City, they have slept out, 
or failed to receive entertainment 
only four nights. They have had 
occasion to spend less money in 
their travel homeward than they 
have done in any other portion of 
their missionary experience. Their 
missionary trail carried them to 
Kirtland, Ohio, to Nauvoo, and 
through other places where our 
fathers and mothers dwelt. They 
sought entertainment at the place 
where the .Prophet and Patriarch 
were murdered ; and in all of those 
places they met with a hearty wel- 
come. During these six months 
they have been energetic in preach- 
ing the gospel in the open air, and 
at the firesides of the people. They 
have been treated well. Of the 
thousands of missionaries that it has 
been my privilege to give an hon- 
orable release to, it is the first time 
that I have had the privilege of hon- 
orably releasing Elder's while here 



ELDER BEN E. RICH.

at a general conference. These 
young men are willing' to take their 
grips and go back again, and report 
once more in their former field of 
labor. I thought I would like you 
brethren and sisters to see a living 
evidence of the simple energy, the 
faithfulness, the enthusiasm that 
dwells, generally, in the heart of a 
missionary. The missionaries are 
willing, any of them, to do as these 
young men have done. Sometimes 
I have thought that if more of them 
were directed to travel homeward, 
as these two young men have done, 
it would help to scatter the seeds 
of the gospel, and create even more 
energy in the hearts of the young 
men of Zion, and thus more might 
be accomplished in spreading a 
knowledge of the gospel that has 
done so much for us. 

In listening to the words of 
President Robinson, I was remind- 
ed of the gospel sermons that were 
given in the missionary field, and 
that were common in the early days 
of this Church, when the Elders in 
the Church opened the scriptures 
and spoke of this great latter-day 
work as simply being the fulfillment 
of what God has declared through 
the mouths of His servants who 
have lived in different dispensations 
of this world's history. I was spe- 
cially interested from the fact that, 
in the missionary labors of Brother 
Robinson, I have learned to love 
him for his integrity, for the great 
work that he is accomplishing in 
the missionary field, and for the 
good that I myself have witnessed 
he has done among great and prom- 
inent men with whom he has la- 
bored. I have heard him preach 
when the Spirit of God has thrilled 
my system, and every fiber felt the 
testimony that God is with Elder 
Robinson when he bears witness to 



the work that God Almighty is do- 
ing in the day and age in which we 
live. 

It has been my privilege, recently, 
to have a remarkaDle experience, 
one that I have often dreamed might 
come to me, but it has always ap- 
peared to me to be among the im- 
possibilities. Within the last three 
months, I have had the privilege of 
visiting my old field of labor, where 
I labored in the midland counties of 
England as a boy missionary, places 
where I was mobbed. I have had 
the chance of holding open air 
meetings, and speaking to thous- 
ands, not only in open air meetings 
but in hall meetings. I have had 
the privilege, recently also, of speak- 
ing in the open air upon the soil 
from which my grandmother came. 
I have stood in Dublin, Ireland, 
with a minister forty feet away 
holding an anti-" Mormon" meeting, 
and felt to rejoice that the Spirit of 
God moved upon the parents of 
Nancy O'Neil, and brought them 
to this land, where she became ac- 
quainted with the principles of the 
gospel. One of the individuals at 
that meeting, filled with rage, shook 
his fist in my face and said I had no 
right there. I asked the crowd to 
show me the color of an Irishman's 
hair who would say that a grandson 
of Nancy O'Neil had no right to 
speak upon the old sod. One fellow 
yelled out, and said : "Let him 
alone, he has got a good Irish 
tongue in his head ;" and I made 
friends. I felt the spirit of my old 
missionary days as I spoke in the 
streets of Glasgow, Scotland, and 
in London, and as I continued my 
journey down through France, and 
met with the Saints of the Swiss 
and German Mission. I felt there, 
although they could not understand 
me, only by means of an interpreter, 



84 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



that the Spirit of God burned in the 
breasts of all nationalities when they 
are baptized into our faith, serving 
one Lord, receiving one baptism. 

It was my privilege to visit Rome, 
and as I stood in the ruins of the 
Coliseum, I remembered the history 
of the faithful former-day Saints 
who, refusing to deny the faith, 
stood there in the arena where the 
Romans opened the cages of the 
wild beasts that had purposely been 
starved for several days, and turned 
them loose upon those Christians 
who would not deny the faith. As 
I looked upon the ruins of that an- 
cient city, I could perceive that the 
wrath of God had been poured forth 
upon that nation who had caused 
His saints to suffer so much, and 
who had, under their laws, crucified 
the Redeemer of mankind. I won- 
dered if the blood of the proud 
Romans could be found now in the 
places where, so few centuries ago, 
it was said "To be a Roman is- 
greater than to be a king." You 
have to search today among the low- 
est of "dagos" to find the blood of 
the proud Roman. I felt in my 
heart that it is not a prosperous 
thing to disobey or to fight against 
God Almighty. I went farther south, 
and walked for hours through the 
streets of the City of Pompeii that, 
on account of wickedness, had been 
covered up by a terrible catastrophe, 
79 years after Christ. But two- 
thirds of it is yet excavated. When 
I looked at the beautiful streets, and 
saw the grooves that had been worn 
in the rocks by the wheels of the 
vehicles, and looked upon the beau- 
tiful pictures upon the walls, and 
noted the wonderful manner in 
which the colors had been pre- 
served, then again I thought, here 
is another city that has suffered the 
wrath of God. 



When I listened to the words of 
President Robinson, concerning the 
trials and tribulations that the 
mothers and children, and men have 
passed through in Mexico, and 
thought of the trials of our fathers 
and mothers in coming here, I won- 
dered in my soul if there was one 
person in this congregation that 
would not be willing to do anything, 
suffer anything, to perpetuate the 
faith of these great men and women, 
who were our fathers and mothers, 
and who brought us here to this 
goodly land. 

I pray God Almighty to bless 
you, in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

Edna Crowther, and the choir, 
sang the hymn : 

School thy feelings, O my brother, 
Train thy warm, impulsive soul: 

Do not its emotions smother, 
But let wisdom's voice control. 

ELDER ANDREW KIMBALL. 

(President of St. Joseph Stake.) 

As the closest neighbor of Old 
Mexico, the Latter-day Saint people 
and those not of our faith, in the 
St. Joseph Stake of Zion have had 
considerable to do with our refugee 
brethren and sisters from that un- 
fortunate country. Immediately 
upon receiving word from President 
Smith concerning the distress of 
our people, we invited the committee 
to send as many as they desired into 
our stake, and we would take care 
of them. Within a few hours, our 
Bishops, through trie acting teach- 
ers, ascertained that we could take 
care of a thousand of the people 
throughout the stake, if necessary, 
and they would be entertained in 
our homes. On the arrival of those 
unfortunate people- in our stake, 
they were immediately taken care of 



ELDER ANDREW KIMBALL.

and provided with the necessary 
comforts of life. Not satisfied with 
this, for we knew that it would cost 
a great deal to keep them, and pay 
for their transportation, we imme- 
diately telegraphed our Congress- 
men from Arizona, and urged that 
they should get an appropriation 
from the government to assist us. 
Accordingly, aided by the Utah Sen- 
ators, the Arizona Senators and 
Representatives succeeded in get- 
ting an appropriation of one hun- 
dred thousand dollars from the 
United States government to pay 
for the transportation of these good 
people to wherever they desired to 
go. A little later, we appealed to 
our Congressmen, and they secured 
the privilege of setting aside twenty 
thousand dollars of the one hundred 
thousand for the maintenance "of 
these people, and a little later they 
sent us some tents from the gov- 
ernment quarters at Hachita. An 
officer of the United States govern- 
ment is now visiting from house to 
house among these refugees, and 
serving them with the necessary 
comforts of life. 

We have thought much of how 
conditions have changed. Once, 
many years ago, a President of the 
U. S., when appealed to by our peo- 
ple, said to the Prophet Joseph 
Smith and his followers, "Your 
cause is just, but I can do nothing 
for you." Today the whole Con- 
gress of the United States has been 
warmed up in feelings of sympathy 
for the "Mormon" refugees from 
Mexico. Representative Howell 
has told me that it was no difficulty 
to get the appropritation, we could 
get almost anything we wanted for 
the benefit of that people. The Gov- 
ernor of Arizona wrote to me, and 
sent a nice liberal contribution, and 
said. "Mr. Kimball, we are ready 



to help you in any way. I guarantee 
to you the influence that I have as 
the Executive of this State for any- 
thing that you desire us to do. I 
will issue a proclamation if you de- 
sire it." I thanked him kindly, and 
said we would endeavor to take care 
of our own people. He renewed 
the same offer later. Many who are 
not Latter-day Saints offered assist- 
ance. We have done the work al- 
most entirely, with other than those 
means furnished by the government, 
in entertaining and looking after 
our people. Senator Ashworth 
wrote to me from Washington, and 
said, "Mr. Kimball, the example 
your people have shown is the 
strongest representation of magna- 
nimity, of generosity and of hospi- 
tality that I have ever seen, it is an 
example to our state and nation, and 
to the world." 

I have thought of a scripture 
statement ebneering the interview 
between Ruth and Naomi, on the 
occasion of Ruth's separation from 
her mother in law, when she said: 
"Entreat me not to leave thee or to 
return from following after thee, for 
whither thou goest I will go, and 
whither thou lodgest I will lodge ; 
thy people shall be my people, and 
thy God my God." The exempli- 
fication of this sentiment, this beau- 
tiful, sweet kindred spirit, is one of 
the strongest testimonies of the gos- 
pel of the Lord Jesus Christ, which 
inculcates the principles of brotherly 
love and kindness to each other. I 
wanted to call the attentation of this 
conference to this. President Smith 
and President Lyman have recom- 
mended that the refugees from 
Mexico shall now scatter among the 
various stakes of Zion. I recommend 
and hope the brethren and sisters 
throughout the various stakes of 
Zion will take this principle to heart, 



86 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



and let these people move into your 
stakes of Zion, while they yet have 
the means with which to move. It 
costs something to move from Mex- 
ico to the North, and now that they 
have the means that was appropri- 
ated for that purpose, we hope you 
will open your doors to them. We 
cannot take care of all these people 
in Arizona for a great length of 
time, and it is not wholesome for 
them to be idle. In our agricultural 
districts the harvest season is nearly 
over, and there will be nothing for 
them to do. Winter is approaching, 
and I beg of you, brethren and sis- 
ters throughout the Church, that 
you now open up your homes to 
those unfortunate refugees, and that 
you write about this to the President 
of that stake, or to me, as we have 
a great many under our supervision 
at this time. Let us send some of 
these afflicted families to you 
that they may be absorbed in the 
Church, and not want for the com- 
forts and necessaries of life. I men- 
tion this to you who are assembled 
here, not that we do not want to 
entertain them longer, but it is not 
proper for so many of them to be 
together without employment, they 
sympathize with each other, and 
look back to their deserted homes. 
It would make you sad to look upon 
the pictures we have seen in the last 
two or three months, in consequence 
of the terrible disaster that has come 
to them. 

One of those good brethren, who 
has spent 15 years of his life in 
endeavoring to proclaim the gospel 
and bring the Mexican people to a 
knowledge of the truth, who was 
well established in his home and 
could ill afford to leave it, was tell- 
ing me how two of those rebles 
came into his home, and with a 
revolver pointed at. his body, told 



him to open up his house and 
show them the treasures of his 
home. This good brother went with 
them through the eight rooms of 
his house, and they ransacked every- 
thing. They found a trunk, the key 
of which his wife had carried away, 
and they were about to murder him 
because he could not open that 
trunk, they then brought an ax 
and chopped it open, and took there- 
from the hard earned savings of 
this good family, $500.00. 

When the first train load of these 
people came into our stake, we took 
them down to the meeting house, 
and distributed them among the 
people. I took one family to my 
home, and they stayed there and ate 
at my table for several days, and 
then I procured a tent and fixed 
them comfortably in my house yard. 
I just mention this one circumstance 
which is only one out of hundreds. 
There was in the neighborhood of 
four thousand of these people, who 
were comfortably situated ; they had 
fine homes. We are almost ashamed 
to think that many of us in the 
United States, with the advantages 
that we have, are not surrounded 
with the comforts that these good 
people had in that foreign country, 
because of their industry and thrift. 
The family that came to my home 
had left 130 acres of well tilled and 
cultivated land ; the good wife was 
making cheese and realizing 25 
cents a pound for it. Her butter 
was bringing one dollar a pound in 
Mexican money, (50 cents in our 
money,) and they had their chick- 
ens and orchard and every comfort 
that they could enjoy. This family 
had grown up from childhood in the 
Southern States, and 17 years ago 
had gone from there to Mexico. 
I have seen that good, sweet woman 
go out in the garden, and weep bit-

terly. They had left a home that 
had been very sacred to them, made 
so by 17 years of hard work, and all 
the associations that home could 
give, and they possessed every com- 
fort that they could desire, and sud- 
denly, within a few moments, they 
picked up what they could throw in- 
to a trunk, and away they went, 
leaving everything else behind, a 
big drove of chickens, about 20 
splendid milch cows, a waving field 
of grain, their garden and every- 
thing.' They had to come to a con- 
dition of absolute dependence. In 
many instances those good people, 
in answer to our questions: "Why 
is it we don't see you in our meet- 
ings?" have said, "We haven't 
clothes fit to appear in the society 
of our brethren and sisters in That- 
cher." We appealed to our Relief 
Society, and they have made cloth- 
ing for them. The most of these 
people are still in El Paso, Texas, 
others in the field of President Rob- 
inson's mission, and in our country, 
the St. Joseph Stake of Zion, and in 
the Maracopa Stake of Zion. 

Now, brethren and sisters, these 
people ought, by all means, to re- 
move to the North. Many of them 
come from an altitude of 6500 feet, 
where they dressed in warm cloth- 
ing, as you do today, and they came 
down into our valley where it is 
very warm, and suffered there by 
reason of the heat. They ought, by 
all means, to be brought into the 
North. Do not be afraid of hurting 
them by inviting them to Canada, 
as suggested by Elder W oods in his 
letter yesterday. Do not be afraid 
of inviting them to Idaho, or any 
other locality, for they can accom- 
modate themselves to whatever cli- 
mate or condition they locate in. 
Open up your hearts and feelings, 
brethren and sisters, and let us ab- 



sorb the people of this disorganized 
Stake of Zion amongst us, that they 
shall have employment, and be made 
to feel that they are not dependent, 
and God will bless you for it. Re- 
member the splendid principle sug- 
gested in the conversation between 
Ruth and Naomi, "for thy people 
shall be my people, and your God 
my God." 

May the Lord bless us, my breth- 
ren and sisters, with the splendid 
feeling of fellowship and love that 
is exemplified in the discoures at 
this conference. May the influence 
thereof sink deep in our hearts, that 
we may be instruments in the hands 
of God in perpetuating the princi- 
ples of brotherly love and fellowship 
to all humanity, that the world may 
with us, glorify God for bringing 
to pass this great work and a won- 
der in the last days, and this I ask 
in the name of Jesus 'Christ. Amen. 

ELDER JOSEPH F. SMITH, JK. 

Prophecies fulfilled in Saints locating 
in the Rocky Mountain region. 

I trust that our brethren and 
sisters will bear with us for just a 
moment longer. 

I have been pleased with the tes- 
timonies of the brethren. I desire 
to add one quotation in connection 
with that which was given by 
Brother Robinson, concerning the 
gathering of the Latter-day Saints 
in these valleys of the Rocky 
Mountains. The Lord says : 

"Wherefore, be not deceived, but con- 
tinue in steadfastness, looking forth for 
the heavens to be shaken, and the earth 
to tremble and to reel to and fro as a 
drunken man. for the valleys to be 
exalted, and for the mountains to be 
made low, and for the rough places to 
become smooth ; and all this when the

angel shall sound his trump. But before 
the great day of the Lord shall come, 
Jacob shall flourish in the wilderness, 
and the Lamanites shall blossom as the 
rose . Zion shall flourish upon the hills 
and rejoice upon the mountains, and 
shall be assembled together unto the 
place which I have appointed." 

In my travels among the people, 
I have seen, in part at least, the ful- 
fillment of the words of the Lord. 
I have seen where the water has 
been increased, where the deserts 
have been made to blossom; pools 
of water have sprung forth, and 
barren places had become fruitful 
fields. This has been through the 
activity and industry of the Latter- 
day Saints and the blessings of the 
Lord which have attended them. I 
feel that we should honor the Lord, 
and sing praises unto him, be true 
and faithful to our covenants, honor 
the priesthood, love the Lord our 
God. and seek first the kingdom of 
God and His righteousness, giving 
him all the honor the praise and the 
glory for the blessings he has 
poured out upon us as Latter-day 
Saints ; for they are many, and will 
be continued, as we know, from day 
to day if we are faithful. The Lord 
will bless us abundantly, granting 
us all things we need, and in His 
own due time rightousness shall 
prevail upon the earth, truth spread 
among the people, wickedness shall 
not be found,and the righteous shall 
inherit the earth. May we go home 
from the Conference with renewed 
energy and determination to serve 
the Lord, which is my prayer, in the 
name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

Tames H. Neilson, and choir, 
sang the hymn : 

O Zion, when I think of thee, 
I long for pinions like the dove. 

And mourn to think that I should be 
So distant from the land I love. 



The music for all the pieces ren- 
dered during the service was com- 
posed by Prof. J. J. McClellan. 

Benediction was pronounced by 
Elder Rea Gardner. 



SECOND OVERFLOW 
MEETING. 

Another meeting of the Confer- 
ence was held in the Assembly Hall, 
at 2 p. m., at which Elder Anthony 
W. Ivins presided. The Seventeenth 
ward choir again furnished the mu- 
sical exercises. 

The choir sang the anthem, 
"Grant us peace, O Lord.*' This 
anthem, and the jther selections 
rendered during this service, were 
composed by Prof. Evan Stephens ; 
solo parts were sung by James H. 
Neilson, H. J. Christiansen, Amer 
i lansen, and Sisters Barnes and 
Smith. 

Prayer was offered by Elder 
James H. Martineau. 

A male quartet sang the hymn : 

Oh, give me back my Prophet dear, 
And Patriarch, O give them back, 

The Saints of latter-days to cheer, 
And lead them in the Gospel track! 

Elder Anthony W. Ivins pre- 
sented the names of the General 
Authorities of the Church ; each 
and all were duly sustained in the 
positions designated, by unanimous 
vote of the congregation. 

The choir sang the anthem, "Gos- 
pel restoration." 

ELDER DAVID H. CANNON. 

(President of St. Goerge Temple.) 

I am very much gratified with the 
opportunity afforded me of address- 
ing you for a few minutes this aft- 
ernoon, and I trust that while I shall

attempt this that I may have an in- 
terest in your faith, that such things 
as may be suggested to my mind 
may be of mutual benefit to us. The 
Gospel, with which we have become 
identified, is the power of God unto 
salvation to every man and woman 
who render themselves strictly obe- 
dient to its requirements ; and I 
want to bear my testimony to the 
truth of that gospel, as revealed in 
this day and age of the world in 
which we live. Joseph Smith was 
a Prophet of God, inspired to do 
that which he accomplished in his 
day, and this gospel as restored 
through the Prophet has come to 
the earth never more to be taken 
from it, or given to another people, 
but is destined to accomplish that 
which God has designed should be 
brought about for the redemption 
of His children. 

I remember the Prophet Joseph 
Smith very well, though but a small 
boy at the time of his martyrdom ; 
but I was impressed as a lad that 
he was a Prophet, a man superior 
to his fellows, and that God had 
raised him up to accomplish a great 
work. I have been acquainted with 
the other leaders of trie Church, 
President Young, President Taylor, ■ 
President Woodruff, President 
Snow, and President Smith. I bear 
testimony to their integrity to the 
truth and to the influence they have 
had upon the world, gathering many 
people from various nations where 
the gospel message greeted their 
ears, and caused them to come to 
these peaceful valleys, where they 
have the privilege of worshiping 
God according to the dictates of 
their conscience, and have not been 
made afraid. When these glad tid- 
ings reached the ears of our fathers 
in the lands of their nativity, they 
rendered obedience to the require- 



ments of the gospel. It did not re- 
quire a manifestation of any great 
mysterious power to convert them 
to the gospel, yet they faithfully ad- 
hered to the principles thereof, be- 
lieving that they were principles 
that God had revealed. No matter 
how dark the day, or how lowering 
the clouds seemed to be that hung 
over the people, and, discouraging 
the conditions ' by which they were 
surrounded, they were unfaltering 
in their fealty to God and the prin- 
ciples that they had espoused. 
Driven from their homes, they 
sought refuge in some other part 
of the country, not knowing where 
they were going. They were always 
cheerful, making camp fires, sitting 
by them, and singing the songs of 
Zion, apparently as happy as it was 
possible for people to be, though 
deprived of everything they had 
possessed on the earth. 

I was talking the other day with 
some of those people who have re- 
cently been driven from Mexico. 
They said "A person cannot realize 
the feeling that possessed us in be- 
ing forced from our homes, with 
nothing but what we stood up in, 
not having time to take our cloth- 
ing or anything but the few things 
that were necessary for our imme- 
diate use. Nobody could under- 
stand our feeling, unless they had 
passed through a' similar experi- 
ence." I can truly sympathize with 
them, because I remember the time 
when the people were driven from 
their homes' in Nauvoo, when the 
end apparently had come, every- 
thing seemed dark. They did not 
have friends that they could go to 
after being driven from their peace- 
ful homes in Illinois, but thev 
crossed the Mississippi river, and 
journeyed in the wilderness, not 
knowing where they were going:

but they were cheerful, and the 
Lord guided them, and brought 
them to these mountains. I 'remem- 
ber very well the distressing condi- 
tions of the people. I remember 
the power of the Lord being mani- 
fest in many instances in their de- 
liverance. I remember coming to 
Winter Quarters and remaining 
there, and that many of the people 
scattered from there into the sur- 
rounding regions to work and ob- 
tain outfits to enable them to come 
on to the valleys of the mountains ; 
and others went on to locate an 
abiding place for the people. 

I remember when we entered 
these mountains, the forbidding 
aspect, the dreary appearance of the 
country and the conditions by which 
we were surrounded. We come 
here today and see the contrast. 
This sight that we behold today, the 
people surrounded by the comforts 
and conveniences that the Lord has 
conferred upon them, and the peace 
and quiet that surround them, are 
sufficient to convince the most skep- 
tical of God's power having been 
manifest in behalf of the people. 
Settlements . have sprung up east 
and west, north and south, until the 
then Territory and now the State 
of Utah, is filled almost to its ca- 
pacity, and the people have had to 
find place in the adjacent states, 
and are becoming a mighty people 
in the midst of this nation, of which 
we form a part. If we continue 
faithful, obedient to the require- 
ments of the gospel, living in con- 
formity thereto, God will continue 
to manifest his power, and the peo- 
ple will prosper, and increase in a 
knowledge of the truth. 

I heard a man a short time ago 
predict the conditions which are 
coming upon our sons and daugh- 
ters. He said: "Mr. Cannon, in 



associating with your young people, 
I find that they are not taking to 
religion, they are drifting into in- 
fidelity, and they have not the con- 
fidence in the leaders of the Church 
that you older men have had." I 
replied, "It may appear to you that 
way, but I am satisfied that these 
young men and young women, who 
now appear inactive in regard to 
spiritual affairs, if conditions should 
require it, you would find them as 
strong and as willing to defend the 
principles of eternal truth as their 
fathers ever were. The faith of the 
gospel is in their hearts, but, in our 
ordinary moving about, there is 
nothing connected with the gospel 
that requires us to wear a long face 
or appear sanctimonious." We be- 
lieve that God is our Father, that 
His Son Jesus Christ is the Re- 
deemer of the world, and that 
through Him and by Him, and 
through obedience to the require- 
ments that He has made of us, we 
will gain eternal lives in His pres- 
ence. Every principle that is true, 
or that is calculated in its nature to 
raise mankind in the scale of human 
intelligence, is a part of the gospel, 
no matter where it comes from. 
When we approach the Lord in 
prayer, as has been done on this 
occasion, we go to him in faith, 
nothing doubting, because we know 
that He is our Father and will hear 
our petition. As we embrace the 
gospel, and conform strictly to it, 
God gives us a knowledge regard- 
ing its divinity, and we increase in 
faith until we have become thor- 
oughly imbued with the spirit of 
the work of the Lord, and it only 
requires the occasion to make us 
stand forth firmly and valiantly in 
its defense. 

I rejoice in this great work. I 
rejoice in it from the fact that it is '

applicable to every condition in 
which man may be found. The gos- 
pel requires the same degree of obe- 
dience from the man that is found 
in a palace as of the man who is 
found in a cottage. All men must 
render strict obedience to the re- 
quirements of the gospel. As the 
fruits of the spirit are manifest in 
man's life, he grows in intelligence, 
and in understanding of the things 
that pertain to God and godliness, 
and he becomes convinced and con- 
firmed so that nothing can turn him 
from the truth, or rob him of the 
testimony of the spirit that is with- 
in him. You know sometimes peo- 
ple feel that in order for them to 
become converted to the gospel, it 
is necessary for them to have some 
kind of a miraculous manifestation ; 
but the genuine Latter-day Saint 
will learn the truth by obedience, 
the conviction thus comes to them, 
and they realize that they are ac- 
cepted of God. 

Ask a man the question how he 
knows the gospel to be true. Ask 
him, "Did you ever see an angel?" 
"No." "Did you ever see any one 
raised from the dead? You speak 
of the resurrection of the dead ; 
have you ever seen anybody that 
was resurrected?" "No." "How 
do you know that this gospel is 
true? What demonstration have 
you had to satisfy you?" I never 
have had any miraculous manifes- 
tation, but I will tell you what I 
have had : I have endeavored to 
render myself obedient to the re- 
quirements of the gospel, and as I 
have done so the Spirit of God has 
testified to me of its divine authen- 
ticity. Any principle that has been 
revealed from the earliest times 
until the present, as I have tried to 
render myself obedient to its re- 
quirements, God has given me a tes- 



timony regarding it, and my heart 
and my soul have been satisfied. 
The hope that is firmly implanted 
in my heart becomes brighter and 
stronger as I proceed to render obe- 
dience to the requirements made by 
the gospel through the servants of 
God. 

When we receive the gospel, we 
are not satisfied to sit down and say 
in our hearts we have received it, 
and we are satisfied ; but we begin 
to desire to extend this knowledge 
that we have received to our fel- 
lows, and we begin to see what we 
can do to improve the condition of 
mankind. When the spirit of the 
work comes upon us we are not sat- 
isfied to look just alone to the in- 
terests of the living, and to bear 
testimony to them of the divine 
truths that we have received, but we 
also desire the eternal welfare of 
our progenitors, and we endeavor 
to see what can be done in their in- 
terest, to ameliorate their condition. 
At the time that the Lord com- 
manded His servants to go into all 
the world and preach the gospel to 
every creature, He said, "he that 
believeth and is baptized shall be 
saved, and he that believeth not 
shall be damned." So, we believe 
that those who did not render this 
obedience in their lifetime, and died 
without having the opportunity of 
obeying, that it is necessary for 
them to have the ordinance of bap- 
tism performed in their behalf, 
vicariously. As we become pos- 
sessed of the genealogical data that 
will enable us to do so, we go into 
the houses that the Lord has caused 
to be erected, and we seek to per- 
form the work that is necessary for 
the redemption of our kindred dead. 
The matter forces itself upon our 
understandings that we without 
our dead "can not be made per- 



92 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



feet," nor can our dead be made 
perfect without us, so we find that 
there is something good that we 
may do, every day that we live in 
the earth. 

A man said to me: "How is it 
that I have been identified with this 
Church so long and I have never 
been called upon to do anything?" 
"Well," I said, "the only reason 
that I can give is that you were 
never there when there was some- 
thing to do." A person that is 
always ready and willing can easily 
find plenty to do, every day. No 
man is justified in sitting down and 
idling away his time, simply be- 
cause he is not asked to go and do 
something. He can engage in no 
grander work than in the interest of 
his dead. He can go to the temple 
and be baptized for them ; then he 
can receive other blessings on their 
behalf. He can place in the hands 
of his dead kindred keys, and 
power, and authority by which they 
may have the privilege of entering 
into celestial glory, and enjoying 
that which the Lord has to bestow 
upon the faithful. He can impart 
to them authority and power with- 
out which they never can pass to 
their exaltation. 

There are plenty of people drift- 
ing about the country, and the 
streets, that the man who bears the 
holy Priesthood has ample oppor- 
tunity to bear his testimony to, who 
have not yet found the path to eter- 
nal life. Thus we have no surplus 
time, of spare time, and there is no 
occasion for any one to say that he 
has not been asked to do anything, 
or to ask the question, "How is it 
that I have never been asked to do 
anything?" The servants of the 
Lord should not have to ask people 
to do their duty, the people should 
be ready and willing. 



It is my desire to bear , my testi- 
mony to the people. I know, as I 
know that God lives, that this is the 
work of God. I know that the work 
that is done in our temples for the 
redemption of the dead is essential ; 
and I know, furthermore, that those 
who go to the temple and do the 
work as far as they have genealog- 
ical data that will enable them to do 
it, the Lord will open the way for 
them to receive further information. 
The greater the amount of work 
they do the greater their desires 
will be to do it, and more informa- 
tion will be placed in their hands 
to enable them to continue the great 
work for the redemption of the 
dead. 

May God bless us, pour out His 
holy Spirit upon us, and enable us 
to be diligent in carrying out and 
assisting to accomplish His pur- 
poses in the earth, through Jesus 
Christ, our Lord. Amen. 

ELDER CHARLES A. CALLIS. 

(President of Southern States Mission.) 

Many times when we are preach- 
ing in the mission fields, well mean- 
ing and good people say : "Why do 
you 'Mormons' give a place to 
Joseph Smith as one of the Proph- 
ets of God 5 " And we answer, we 
do not do that; God gave Joseph 
Smith his place, and he is just as 
indispensable as an instrument in 
the hands of God to execute the 
purposes of the Almighty as Adam, 
Moses, Abraham, Isaiah, Jeremiah, 
Ezekiel, Peter or Paul. You know, 
the very first words that the Angel 
Moroni said to Joseph Smith were 
these, "God has a work for you to 
do ;" and in that work we are asso- 
ciated with the Prophet Joseph 
Smith, and with him, as the Apostle • 
Paul declares, we are "fellow work-

ers with the Lord." What a glori- 
ous comfort, what a splendid priv- 
ilege! A historian declared that 
"unless something new is born in 
America with power to save, that 
America will differ but little from 
the other parts of Christendom." 
That something new has been born ; 
the gospel, which is new to this dis- 
pensation, but which is the ancient 
everlasting gospel, hath been re- 
stored, and it is the "power of God 
unto salvation" to every man and 
woman. 

A great preacher was asked the 
other day these questions : "Do you 
believe' that God is a personal be- 
ing? Do you believe that Jesus is 
the Christ ?" And the great 
preacher declared that if he should 
answer "yes" to these questions that 
his answer might be taken in a 
dozen different ways. Has it come 
to that, that the people have been 
spoiled by vain philosophy, that a 
preacher cannot answer in the 
words of Peter, "Thou art the 
Christ, the son of the living God" ? 
Joseph Smith received that glorious 
vision, in which were shown to him 
the Father and the Son, whom to 
know is life eternal, the greatest 
gift that God can give to man. And 
it was his work, the work of that 
prophet, to declare the great truth 
to the world, that men were made 
in the image of God, and they are 
His children. This same preacher 
declared that the belief that "there 
is no hope beyond the grave" is a 
mistake, that he believed in it, that 
there is hope beyond the grave. 
Since when did this people that sit 
in darkness see a great light? Why, 
since in that stand in Kirtland, the 
Prophet Elijah, in fulfillment of 
prophecy, appeared to Joseph Smith 
and conferred upon him the Priest- 
hood and the power to administer 



ordinances to save the souls of those 
who have separated from the body 
and gone into the world beyond. 
This meant, you know, that there 
is hope beyond the grave ; but that 
is as far as that minister can go. 
Where is the power to put this be- 
lief into practice? 

Items of truth there are in every 
creed, but Joseph Smith came with 
the bow that shot the apple to its 
core. He came with the power, 
with the Priesthood, with the means. 
God had made and designed in the 
heavens, by which the dead could be 
saved, and through which they with 
us can be made perfect in the king- 
dom of our Father. And so God re- 
vealed to his prophets that, in the 
temples of God, sacred ordinances 
could be performed which would 
save our dead, and in which holy 
places we could be united to our 
loved ones for time and all eternity. 
This is the distinction, apparent to 
me, of the divinity of the mission 
of the Prophet Joseph Smith. He 
came not only to tell the truth, to 
announce God's word, but he came 
with the power, with the authority 
to put it into effect, and to give 
inspiration to all the commandments 
of God. 

One of the happiest moments I 
ever spent in my life, one of the 
greatest privileges I ever had, was 
to sit in that big Tabernacle and 
hear the Prophet of God announce 
that it was deemed advisable to 
build another temple. I say when 
he announced that, and asked for 
the vote of the Priesthood of the 
Church to sustain him and the 
Church authorities in that under- 
taking, and in that splendid work, 
I say it was one of the happiest mo- 
ments of my life to raise my hand 
to sustain the Prophet and his 
brethren in the accomplishment of 



94 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



that splendid work. Let the world 
say what it may of Joseph Smith, 
he was a Prophet of God. 

"He gazed on the past, the present too, 
And opened the heavenly worlds to 
view." 

He came as God's ambassador. 
He did this work well, and in that 
work God grant that you and I may 
ever be with him, and with our 
leaders be blessed thereby. I ask it 
in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

The choir sang the anthem, "Ho- 
sannah !" 

ELDER GERMAN E. ELLSWORTH. 

(President of Northern States Mission.) 

In contrasting the sermons that I 
have heard during this conference 
with the spirit of the world, I am 
strongly reminded of the statement 
in the scriptures wherein it says 
that it shall be in the days of the 
coming of the Son of Man as it was 
in the days of Noah, that the peo- 
ple shall be indifferent, not know- 
ing the way of life,- not certain of 
anything, and not particularly in- 
terested. Noah was unable, after 
120 years' teaching, to induce more 
than his own family to go into the 
ark. In this day it seems to be the 
same. The members of sectarian 
churches of the world do not know 
they are right, neither do they 
know that they are not right. The 
people belonging to each church 
are willing to go on in their way, 
generally speaking, and willing to 
let all other churches do the same. 
The Baptists, Methodists, Congre- 
gationalists and all others concede 
that ministers of all the so-called 
Christian churches have the right 
to make their living by preaching. 
In doing this they feel that they 



are doing some good, and, in a gen- 
eral way, the Christian world cer- 
tainly has been benefited, for we 
know that all Christians are ele- 
vated much above those who have 
not accepted Christianity. The 
Christian sects have not accepted 
all the truth, but they have accepted 
a great deal of it, and we know that 
those who have accepted a part 
have been made better and elevated 
to a higher standard. 

In my short experience, I can re- 
member when sectarian ministers 
preached the awful doctrine of 
damnation of infants, and that if 
people did not accept Christ in this 
life they were lost forever, and 
many other similar doctrines. But, 
today they have grown more liberal 
as they call it, and more broad- 
minded, even willing to leave the 
hereafter to the Lord, while they 
now preach that men should repent 
and live a holy life, and walk the 
straight and narrow path. I be- 
lieve that the Christian world has 
done a great work for the uplifting 
of the human family. They have 
fought the restored gospel, and 
been unwilling to accept it as a 
whole, but they are now accepting 
it little by little, and it is marvel- 
ous how much of the revealed gos- 
pel of the Lord Jesus Christ the 
Christian world now believes, com- 
pared to a few years ago. I have 
been told, in the last year, by a num- 
ber of ministers, that they believe 
in the restoration of the gospel ; 
that is, since the days of Luther, 
Calvin, Knox and other great re- 
ligious reformers, there has been a 
restoration of the light of the prim- 
itve gospel of Jesus Christ, not a 
restoration of it as taught by the 
Latter-day Saints, but a restoration 
of it little by little, or as fast as 
they are prepared for the same. 



ELDER GERMAN E. ELLSWORTH.

I rejoice in the knowledge my 
brethren and sisters, that they are 
beginning to believe in the restor- 
ation. I rejoice to see them ac- 
cepting principles which were re- 
vealed by the Lord of heaven to the 
Prophet Joseph Smith. I have re- 
joiced in the spirit of the testimo- 
nies that have been borne by the 
speakers during this conference, in 
their positiveness, and in their as- 
surance that they know what the 
Church and people are doing, and 
where they are going. People of 
the world are growing tired of hav- 
ing leaders that are not certain of 
their path. Therein is the beauty 
of the gospel of the Lord Jesus 
Christ, for in it is revealed to us 
the true character of our Father 
and His earth-born Son. We are 
not in doubt as to who they are, 
what they look like, the purpose of 
Christ's mission in the world, and 
their supervision over the human 
family. This restored gospel has 
heen leavening the whole lump, and 
the world is being prepared to ac- 
cept it, not in part, as at present, 
but as it was revealed from heaven, 
as to doctrine as well as to author- 
ity and organization. 

Last spring I heard two sermons 
on the resurrection which were al- 
most a counterpart of the teaching 
on this subject found in the Book 
of Mormon. When I think that, in 
the United States, in the last eight 
years, the seven missions have dis- 
tributed nearly 200,000 copies of 
the Book of Mormon, it is no won- 
der that the truths in the book are 
spreading among the people. The 
simplicity and beauty of its teach- 
ings, like the revelation of the 
Father and the Son, are affecting 
the world. People are beginning 
to believe in the restoration of the 
gospel. They are beginning to be- 



lieve that the God of heaven is 
our Father, and that He loves His 
children. Still they are lukewarm, 
they are not positive in the way 
that they are going. They are too 
easy in their religion. They are 
like some that we have among us 
— they are Christians, but are not 
doing much at their religion. And 
so in the Christian world, there are 
millions that are not doing much at 
it. In fact, the men folks of the 
world, in a very large measure, 
have withdrawn themselves from 
churches and are taking part in 
lodges, because the lodges give 
them something to do, if it is no 
more than to sit in a special chair, 
carry banners, march in line, and in 
turn be the head of the organiza- 
tion for a little time. But the wom- 
en still attend the churches, and are 
doing the greater part of the fam- 
ily religion. In the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints, at 
home, we find some men that are 
not taking very much part. As 
Brother David H. Cannon said, 
they have never been called upon, 
because they have never been in the 
way of work. If there are any at 
home that feel sorry they have not 
been called, I wish to state that I 
hope they will be called upon to 
come into my mission field. We are 
at least fifty short in our field of 
the number we have had, and one 
hundred short of what we would 
like to have. There is plenty of 
work for them to do. If they 
will come out and do it, trusting in 
the Lord, the Spirit and power of 
God will come upon them, and 
they will be able to come home, as 
thousands have done, saying it is 
the happiest time of their lives, and 
the sweetest work they have ever 
performed. A testimony will grow 
in their hearts that the revelations 



96 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



of God through the Prophet Joseph 
Smith are true. The heavens will 
open to them, and they will rejoice 
in bearing testimony of the truth 
upon the public streets and in pub- 
lic and private meetings. I have 
heard hundreds of them bear that 
testimony, and none who heard 
them doubted what they said. 
There is joy in the. service of the 
Lord. The world has grown hike 
warm because of the nature of the 
doctrines taught to them, and the 
uncertainty of the self-appointed 
leaders. There has been no pos- 
itiveness in their preachers, no cer- 
tainty in their declarations, no 
knowledge concerning the true 
character of God ; and, as was said 
in the Tabernacle this morning, 
how can they impart more than 
they have received ? On the other 
hand, the positive testimony of the 
elders is sweet to the hearts of the 
honest people of the earth, for they 
bear witness that God lives, that 
Jesus is the Christ, that He has re- 
stored the gospel to the earth, the 
gospel of faith, repentance and 
baptism. All men and women who 
will repent and be baptized for the 
remission of their sins shall know 
of the doctrine, and know that it is 
of God. That kind of preaching stirs 
the hearts of those who love God 
and would like to know the way to 
go. Hundreds of them are touched 
in their hearts, and some day they 
will bear witness of it by being bap- 
tized in water for the remission of 
their sins. 

The world has not yet, by their 
.own wisdom, found the way, neith- 
er have they found any one who 
can tell them the way. I wonder 
sometimes that there should be any 
Latter-day Saints not doing any- 
thing at the religion that has been 
given to us in this day. The gold 



and silver of the world is nothing 
compared to the great gift that God 
our Father has given to us. We 
are not destined by our own efforts 
and tact, nor by our own intelli- 
gence to win the wealth of the 
world, but we have been promised 
the riches of the world, after we 
have sought and found the king- 
dom of God. The Lord gave the 
elders of this Church positive in- 
structions that we should not seek 
the riches of this world, but seek 
to bring to pass the righteousness 
of God, and to bring about the sal- 
vation of the souls of men, and if 
we do that, and continue faithful 
all our days, we shall be saved in 
the kingdom of God, which is the 
greatest of all the gifts of our 
Father. 

Two of our elders in the Min- 
nesota conference, about three 
weeks ago, were accosted by a 
lady at her door, who said: "flow 
is it you come to my door? Why, 
I entertained two of your elders a 
year ago. Won't any of my neigh- 
bors keep you?" They were two 
young men who had not been there 
very long, and one of them, who 
was the spokesman, said: "My 
good woman, we were turned away 
about ten times in this neighbor- 
hood after holding street meetings, 
so we knelt down and asked the 
Lord if there was an honest heart 
in this neighborhood or within our 
reach that He would lead us to 
such. We arose and have come 
straight to your door." She was 
so touched, because the Lord had 
led those two elders to her door, 
that she took them in ; that state- 
ment of a common practice of the 
elders was sufficient to interest her 
in the restored gospel. 

The work of the Lord is certain- 
ly increasing in the earth, and the

Spirit of our Father is taking hold 
of the hearts of the people. I doubt 
not it will be but a short time till 
thousands of people will go futher 
than to manifest only belief. To 
their belief they will add the works 
of repentance, baptism and the lay- 
ing on of hands. They will under- 
stand that the Lord of heaven has 
indeed established His Church, and 
given men authority to bear wit- 
ness in His name, and to officiate in 
the ordinances of the gospel of the 
Lord Jesus. Even today some are 
inquiring: "Who ordained our 
minister?' "So-and-So." "And 
who ordained him?" And going 
further back they discover that no 
one ordained the first minister of 
their church, and so they find there 
is a broken link in the history of 
their authority. They wonder why 
and how it is that the authority 
has not continued down since the 
days of Christ upon the earth ; and, 
if there has been a partial restora- 
tion of the gospel, has there been 
also a restoration of authority? 

My brethren and sisters, we 
should not only sing in our Sab- 
bath services, but in our souls, we 
ought to rejoice that we are made 
partakers of the glorious gospel, 
this gift and power by which we 
can be saved in the kingdom of 
our Father, and that will bring 
eternal life to each one of us, if we 
continue faithful to the end. The 
early elders of the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints were 
given a commandment to seek after 
righteousness and to bring- to pass 
the glory of God. So also are the 
elders of today under the same ad- 
monition from our Father, to seek 
first the kingdom of God, and the 
promise is that, afterward, the 
riches of heaven will be given un- 
to us, that is, in the end, if faith- 



ful, we will be given the greatest 
of all blessings that can be be- 
stowed upon the human family, the 
gift of salvation. It is worth our 
most earnest effort, my brethren 
and sisters, and no Latter-day 
Saint who has received the testi- 
mony of the gospel ought to be 
lukewarm in that testimony. To be 
a "Mormon" and not doing much 
at it, is beyond my comprehension, 
T can not understand such inactiv- 
ity on the part of any young man 
or woman in whose heart burns the 
testimony of Jesus. 

Let us go forth among our 
neighbors clothed upon with the 
armor of truth, depending upon 
the Spirit of God, and teach them 
the gospel. I think there will be 
as much joy in a convert at home 
as one abroad. If you convert a 
man at home, you are able to live 
together in the pure love of a mis- 
sionary and a convert. You have 
heard the elders say it was the 
saddest day of their lives to leave 
the mission field, not that they did 
not wish to come home to their 
loved ones, but, under the influence 
of the Spirit of God, they have seen 
men and women yield to their 
teachings. They have gathered 
around them friends and converts 
that are very near to them, be- 
cause they have taken part in their 
salvation ; they have taken part in 
bringing light and truth into their 
lives, and learned to love them 
dearly. If we could bring light and 
truth to the hundreds of people 
who have gathered to the valleys of 
the mountains, to acquire gold and 
silver we would give them some- 
thing greater than they came for, 
and in doing so feel the joy of a 
missionary with no parting sor- 
rows, as they would always be near 
us. I am firmly convinced that the 



98

same effort, together with the same 
love and consideration, given at 
home as in the mission field would 
convert many. For such a work 
they would love us, and we would 
love them, and with them we would 
rejoice in the work of God when 
we finish our labors upon the earth. 
May it not be in Zion like it was 
in the days of Noah. 

Let us not be lukewarm. Let us 
go forth in the spirit and power of 
the Lord, and the spirit of the 
counsel given us by the Prophets 
and apostles of the latter days, and 
work for the salvation of our fel- 
low men. May God bless us and 
raise us up as ensigns to the world, 
that the honest among men shall 
see the light and come to Zion, is 
my prayer in the name of Jesus. 
Amen. 

ELDER SAMUEL 0. BENNION. 

(President of Central States Mission.) 

I realize that our time is pretty 
well spent, so I shall be brief in my 
remarks. 

One thought expressed by 
Brother David H. Cannon has im- 
pressed me very much. There will 
not be many years pass until such 
men as Brother Cannon will not be 
upon this earth among us. He has 
lived about seventy-five years, and 
as a boy he knew the Prophet 
Joseph Smith. Such a testimony 
as this will not be given many more 
years by persons who knew Joseph 
Smith, for it will not be long until 
all those brethren and sisters who 
are among us now shall no longer 
be with us, and we shall have to 
take the words of men who have 
listened to them. I never saw the 
Prophet Joseph Smith, but I be- 
lieve, my brethren and sisters, with 
all my heart, in fact I know, that 



there was a Prophet by the name 
of Joseph Smith who lived in this 
day and dispensation, and I know 
that the same testimony that I have, 
which was given to me by the Holy 
Spirit, I might say was inherited 
by me, undoubtedly will be obtained 
by millions in this world. I believe 
that same testimony shall be de- 
clared to every nation in all the 
world, until all shall have a chance 
to receive or reject the testimony 
of Jesus. 

The Savior said that the gospel 
should be preached unto every 
creature under heaven. I believe 
that He meant just exactly what He 
said, and that men or women, 
whether in the flesh or out of the 
flesh, in this world or out of it, be- 
fore they shall be judged and called 
to give an account of the deeds done 
in the body, that this gospel, the 
law of liberty, the principles which 
govern and control men upon the 
earth or anywhere, shall be made 
manifest unto them. The Lord shall 
never pass judgment upon a man 
until he shall be given an oppor- 
tunity to fully understand the gos- 
pel of the Redeemer of the world, 
and unto this end the gospel shall 
be proclaimed unto men that they 
may become partakers of its bless- 
ings. Men may be led to investi- 
gate the gospel, through the influ- 
ence of an elder traveling in their 
midst ; or by some other agency. 
Individuals may hear a "Mormon" 
Elder preach, and receive some of 
the literature that we are delivering 
from day to day, by the thousands 
of pages. Every man and woman 
may not have the opportunity to 
hear, in the flesh, the testimony of 
men, but they have the privilege of 
reading the gospel of the Redeemer 
of the world. I believe that this 
message will be carried to the sons 



ELDER ANTHONY W. IVINS. 



99 



and daughters of men in many 
ways ; they shall be warned through 
their neighbors, and when one is 
warned he shall in turn warn his 
neighbor, Joseph Smith received 
divine light, divine principles of 
truth and of justice, and these shall 
enter into the hearts of men and the 
truth shall make them free. Men 
who preach perverse doctrine shall 
be driven from the pulpit, and stand 
on common grounds with others ; 
they shall have to abide the truth, 
confess that Jesus is the Christ, and 
that Joseph Smith is a prophet of 
the living Lord. The work called 
"Mormonism" is true, and these 
principles of truth, revealed just as 
we- have them today, shall make 
free all men and women who obey 
them, and shall release captives 
from the captivity of death. Men 
shall come to an understanding that 
the work of God, the Eternal 
Father, is everlasting, and that it 
shall never cease until every son and 
daughter of His shall have the priv- 
ilege of saying, "Yes, I will serve 
Thee," or "I will not serve Thee." 
All men and women have free 
agency, and the power of intelli- 
gence, and they may know for 
themselves what they are doing. 
The Lord shall never take "snap 
judgment" upon His, sons and 
daughters, for He loves them. The 
testimony that Joseph Smith is a 
true Prophet, that the work called 
"Mormonism" is true, shall con- 
tinue to go into the world until the 
sons and daughters of men shall 
yield obedience, or shall say, "We 
do not desire to obey." 

I pray God to bless the Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints, the people who come to con- 
ference and those that do not, that 
you may be able to send your sons 
and daughters into the mission field, 



not only for the testimony that they 
shall bear but for the good that it 
shall do them. That this work may 
grow, and that this people residing 
in the valleys of the mountains, who 
have been led here by the hand of 
the living God, shall be the power 
which shall take into the world the 
leaven which shall "leaven the whole 
lump," and bring joy, happiness and 
eternal life unto the sons and 
daughters of God who are yet in 
darkness, I humbly pray, in the 
name of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER ANTHONY W, IVINS. 

Signs of present times foretold by the 
Savior. — Endless progression result of 
obedience to Eternal laws. — -Funda- 
mental doctrines of United States 
Government divine and everlasting. 

The time has come, my brethren 
and sisters, when we are to adjourn 
this conference for another six 
months, to go to our homes and as- 
sume the responsibilities which 
devolve upon us in magnifying our 
calling in the Church, and perform- 
ing the duties that devolve upon us 
as citizens of this Republic. I can 
think of no word of admonition or 
counsel that I could more profitably 
call your attention to before we dis- 
miss than the words of the Savior 
which He spoke to His disciples 
just before His crucifixion. He was 
talking to them of the latter days. 
He was talking to them of us, who 
are assembled here this afternoon. 
He was talking of the time when 
He should come in the clouds of 
heaven to reign in power and do- 
minion on the earth. And when 
they asked Him to give them a sign 
by which they might know that this 
period was near, He warned them, 
among other things, that those 
times would be perilous, that it 



100 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



would be a period when there would 
be wars and rumors of wars, when 
there would be confusion ; but more 
than that, when many men would 
come in His name and would de- 
ceive many, when some would cry, 
Lo here, and others Lo there, false 
prophets would arise, and . false 
Christs, and their works would be 
so convincing that they would de- 
ceive, if possible, the very elect. He 
warned the people to stand fast to 
the doctrines which He had taught. 
And in emphasizing this, the Apos- 
tle Paul in his Epistle to the Ephe- 
sians warned them to be "not like 
children, moved hither and thither 
by every wind of doctrine" that 
blew, but to stand fast in the doc- 
trines which had been taught to 
them. 

That doctrine, briefly stated, was 
faith in God, our Eternal Father. 
It was that Jesus Christ of whom 
they bore witness, was the Son of 
God; that he was God manifest in 
the flesh, that He was the Redeemer 
of the world, and had been crucified 
for the sins of the world ; that He 
had been raised from the dead, be- 
ing "the first fruits of the resurrec- 
tion," and that in time, to come He 
should reign in power and dominion 
over this earth, and His kingdom 
become supreme. Christ Himself 
declared, and His disciples taught, 
that this gospel of the kingdom 
must of necessity first "be preached 
as a witness" unto the inhabitants 
of the earth before that time should 
come. 

Now, my brethren and sisters, I 
do not need to enter into any argu- 
ment to convince you that we are 
living in these very times. Go out 
on to the corners of these streets 
tonight, or if you were there last 
night, you would have heard doc- 
trines of every shade and color, 



plans of redemption that probably 
would appeal to some, which prom- 
ise great blessing to human kind. 
It is a day of confusion, a day of 
religious unbelief. It is a day when 
demagogues seek to lead you into 
strange paths in civil and political 
economy. All I have to say to you 
is that we believe in progression, 
we are a progressive people, and we 
believe that there will never be an 
end to it, that we shall continue, 
and must continue, in this life and 
in the life to come, to go forward, 
for water that stands still of neces- 
sity becomes stagnant ; but as we 
progress this one fact we must rec- 
ognize, that there is no progression 
from these fundamental principles 
of truth upon which this Church is 
builded. The "Law of Carnal Com- 
mandments" was completed, was 
done away with in the coming of 
Christ. It was no longer necessary 
to slay the male lamb without blem- 
ish and offer up living things as a 
sacrifice to God in similitude of the 
Only Begotten of the Father. But 
in doing away with that ordinance 
there was no change to that com- 
mandment of God which had been 
given to His children in the very 
beginning, that they should not lie, 
that they should not steal, that they 
should not commit adultery. These 
truths are eternal. These doctrines 
of morality last forever. They will 
always be in the Church. That doc- 
trine which seeks to lead us away 
from it beware of, for God will 
have us do just as He did at that 
time. Jesus is the Redeemer of the 
world just as He was at that time. 
He is God made manifest in the 
flesh. He has opened this gospel 
dispensation. Joseph Smith, through 
His instrumentality, established this 
work. Authority came to the earth, 
through the message of John the 



ELDER ANTHONY W. WINS. 



101 



Baptist and the disciples of Jesus 
Christ, to administer in the ordi- 
nances of the gospel. Those are 
the fundamentals ; those are the es- 
sentials. Those are the truths upon 
which this Church is builded, and 
we never can progress away from 
them, because they will stand for- 
ever, just as they were in the be- 
ginning. I am wedded to them. 
My conscience is a captive to them. 
I know them to be true. I know 
them to be essential to the welfare 
of this congregation of Latter-day 
Saints. So I admonish you that 
you hold fast to them, let come 
what may. 

Just as I believe in these doc- 
trines, so in my heart and soul I 
believe in the fundamental doctrines 
of civil government, which were 
given to . us by the fathers of our 
country that before God men are 
created equal, that governments 
are instituted among men for their 
protection and happiness, and that 
all just governments must derive 
their powers from the consent of 
the governed. The government 
belongs to us ; it is ours. Now 
there may be differences of opinion 
as to the best methods of adminis- 
tering it. We may not always ad- 
here just to the policy of the fath- 
ers, because, as conditions change 
different policies are necessary. But 
these fundamental doctrines to 
which I refer are just as true to us, 
they are just as true as are the fun- 
damental doctrines of the gospel, 
because they are eternal, and there 
can be no government except they 
are based upon these principles. If 
you will remember that, keep it in 
mind, and live close to those divine 
doctrines of civil government, the 
Latter-day Saints will be the men 



and women that God wants us 
to be. 

I am reminded of the words of 
J. G. Holland, who spoke them a 
long time ago, but it seems to me 
there never was a time when they 
were more applicable: 

"God give us men. A time like this re- 
quires great minds, 

Strong hearts, true faith, and ready 
hands ; 

Men whom the lust of office does not 
kill; 

Men whom the spoils of- office cannot 
buy; 

Men who are honest, men who will not 
lie; 

Men who can stand before a demagogue, 
And damn his flattering treachery 

without winking; 
Tall men, sun-crowned, who live above 

the fog; 

In public duty and in private thinking, 
For while the rabble, with their thumb- 
worn creeds, 
Their large pretensions and their little 

deeds 

Mingle in selfish strife, lo ! Freedom 
weeps, 

Wrong rules the land, and waiting 
Justice sleeps." 

If we will adhere to these prin- 
ciples, my brethren and sisters, to 
which I have referred, every man 
and woman in the Church will be 
that kind of man and woman. That 
is what the gospel has done for us, 
that is what every one needs, and 
must have, that shall ever be re- 
deemed and saved from the perils 
which are impending — that kind of 
men and women. 

The Lord help us to be faithful, 
keep us in the truth, lead us back, 
eventually, into His presence, I pray 
through Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The choir sang the anthem, 
"Overthrow of Gog and Magog." 

Benediction was pronounced by 
Elder George C. Lambert.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



OUTDOOR MEETING. 

Thousands of people gathered on 
the Temple grounds, unable to ob- 
tain admission to the Tabernacle or 
Assembly Hall, and an outdoor 
meeting was held for their benefit, 
at 2 p. m., near the Bureau of In- 
formation building. The services 
were presided over by Elder Ben- 
jamin Goddard. Music was fur- 
nished by Prof. Wm. C. Clive's or- 
chestra. 

The congregation sang the hymn : 

Praise to the man who communed 
with Jehovah! 
Jesus anointed that Prophet and 
Seer — 

Blessed to open the last dispensation; 
Kings shall extol him and nations 
revere. 

Prayer was offered by Elder 
Joseph L. Stott. 
The congregation sang the hymn : 

Come, listen to a Prophet's voice, 
And hear the word of God. 

And in the way of truth rejoice, 
And sing for joy aloud. 

ELDER BENJAMIN GODDARD. 

(Supt. Bureau of Information.) 

Brethren and Sisters, we are very 
gratified and pleased to welcome 
such a large number to our open-air 
meeting, and we trust that you will 
give the same attention and ob- 
serve the same order that is ex- 
pected to prevail in the Tabernacle. 

We regret very much that our 
buildings are not large enough, but 
I venture to say that when the Tab- 
ernacle was built, those who 
planned it did not realize that the 
time would come when it would not 
accommodate the people. Today, 
however, we need several such Tab- 
ernacles at conference time as the 
one that is now crowded to its ut- 



most capacity. I surmise that in 
the Tabernacle now, standing and 
seated, there must be nearly 11,000 
people. Our Assembly Hall is filled 
to overflowing, and still the people 
are coming. 

It must be an impressive sight, 
it must be a matter for rejoicing 
among the Latter-day Saints that 
this condition prevails, and that 
each conference indicates the in- 
creased growth and development 
of the work of God. I believe that 
you all feel to rejoice over this fact. 
I do not know of anything that has 
given me more pleasure at this con- 
ference than to observe the evident 
growth of the Church. The decision 
at the General Priesthood Meeting, 
in response to the pleas of the peo- 
ple, that a Temple to the Most High 
God should be built in Canada, in- 
dicates how the people are craving 
for blessings, for the true path of 
life and salvation, and I trust that 
this spirit will continue to increase. 

Our Church members have been 
recognized as builders from the be- 
ginning. No sooner had the Church 
been organized than the men and 
women of the Church commenced 
to build upon that sure foundation. 
In Kirtland the Saints were build- 
ers. They endeavored to establish 
themselves there where a Holy 
Temple was built, and they helped 
to bring together the honest in 
heart, though few in number at that 
time, but they were willing to 
gather and help build up the Church 
of God. , Subsequently the Saints 
went to Independence, Mo., and 
from thence to Nauvoo where, in a 
beautiful location on the Missis- 
sippi, they built up a new city. 

When driven from Nauvoo by 
mob violence, they crossed the 
plains and the Rockies, and no 
sooner had they arrived in these 



ELDER ME LI/ IN J. BALLARD. 



103 



valleys than they commenced to 
work. They plowed* the barren 
land, they planted seed, they built 
their houses, and commenced to 
erect school houses and churches 
throughout the land. And now our 
magnificent Temples here and in 
the north and south, indicate to all 
people that the Latter-day Saints 
are builders. They are workers, 
the Saints are glad to be thus en- 
gaged. 

There are those who come among 
us sometimes whose delight it is to 
attempt to tear down. You find 
them on the street corners, at times 
they come upon this block, they en- 
ter our Tabernacle and their sole 
purpose in life appears to be to de- 
stroy or ridicule the Word of God. 
Call them what you please, they are 
not worthy of the name "Joseph," 
for Joseph was the Founder of the 
Church and a true prophet of the 
Lord. 

The Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints may be judged 
by its fruits, and by their works 
may the people be judged. We 
hope to continue in this work until 
the admiration of the world is called 
forth by the earnest labors of the 
people. 

We welcome you again to this 
meeting. I have the honor to an- 
nounce that brethren have been 
called to whom you will be pleased 
to listen. Elder Melvin J. Ballard, 
President of the North Western 
States Mission ; Elder John L. Her- 
rick, formerly of Ogden, an ener- 
getic worker and President of the 
Western States Mission ; the Presi- 
dent of Pioneer Stake, in this city, 
who has always been a valiant, true 
member of the Church, William 
McLachlan ; also the ex-President 
of the Scandinavian Mission, and 
Assistant Historian, Andrew Jen- 



son. I know you will be glad to 
hear them all and I bespeak for 
them your faith, your prayers, and 
your best attention. 

ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD. 

(President Northwestern States 
Mission.) 

My heart rejoices in the growth 
of the work of the Lord. I am 
always happy to see the souls of the 
children of men brought within the 
fold of Christ, through the waters 
of baptism. I am happy to be able 
to tell you that the work of the Lord 
is growing in the missions of the 
Church. The increase in baptisms 
has been steadily advancing from 
year to year. While I am always 
glad to see the Church growing in 
numbers, I am more interested in 
seeing it grow in faith and in good 
works. I am not satisfied with the 
standard that I have attained, for I 
yet lack that perfection which the 
Gospel teaches. As each one of us 
shall consider our own life, and ex- 
amine ourselves, I am sure that we 
all shall find room for improve- 
ment. 

I desire to read to you from the 
revelation of the Lord" some verses 
on a familiar subject, which has 
been brought to the attention of 
mankind from the beginning of 
time. Reference is found to this 
subject in various of the books of 
the Old and New Testament. I 
read from the revelation to the 
Prophet Joseph, because it seems to 
me more explicit and forcible than 
the words we find recorded in the 
Bible. I read to you. therefore, 
from the nineteenth section of the 
Doctrine and Covenants, beginning 
with the fourth verse : 

"And surely every man must repent 



101

or suffer, for I, God, am endless; 
wherefore I revoke not the judgments 
which I shall pass, but woes shall go 
forth, weeping, wailing, and gnashing 
of teeth, yea, to those who are found 
on my left hand; nevertheless it is 
not written that there shall be no end 
to this torment, but it is written end- 
less torment. Again, it is written 
eternal damnation; wherefore it is 
more express than other scriptures, 
that it might work upon the hearts of 
the children of men, altogether for 
my name's glory; wherefore I will 
explain unto you this mystery, for it 
is mete unto you to know even as 
mine apostles. I speak unto you that 
are chosen in this thing, even as one, 
that you may enter into my rest; for, 
behold the mystery of Godliness, how 
great is it? for, behold, I am endless, 
and the punishment which is given 
from my hand is endless punishment, 
for endless is my name; wherefore — 
eternal punishment is God's punish- 
ment. Endless punishment is God's 
punishment. Wherefore I comand you 
to repent, and keep the command- 
ments which you have received by the 
hand of my servant Joseph Smith, 
fun., in my name; and it is by my al 
mighty power that you have received 
them; therefore I command you to 
repent— repent, lest I smite you bv 
the rod of my mouth, and by mv 
wrath, and by my anger, and your 
sufferings be sore — how sore you 
know not! how exquisite you know 
not! yea, how hard to bear you know 
not! for behold I, God, have suffered 
these things for all, that they might 
not suffer if they would repent, but if 
they would not repent, thev must suf- 
fer even as I, which suffering caused 
myself, even God, the greatest of all, 
to tremble because of pain, and to 
bleed at every pore, and to suffer both 
body and spirit; and would that I 
might not drink the bitter cup and 
shrink— nevertheless, glory be to the 
Father, and I partook and _ finished 
my preparations unto the children of 
men- wherefore I command you again 
to repent, lest I humble you with my 
almighty power, and that you confess 
your sins, lest you suffer these punish- 
ments of which I have spoken, of 
which in the smallest, yea, even in the 
least degree, you have tasted at the 
time I withdrew my Spirit. And I 
command you, that you preach nought 
but repentance, and show not these 



things unto the world until it is wis- 
dom in me." 

I presume that nearly all of those 
whom I am now addressing have 
gone into the waters of baptism, 
following repentance ; for we were 
taught that it is essential and nec- 
essary that we should repent of our 
sins in order that baptism may be 
effectual in washing away the trans- 
gressions of the past. I fear that 
some of us members of the Church 
have failed to realize the necessity 
of retaining with us the spirit of 
repentance after we have entered 
the waters of baptism. That man 
or woman who ceases to repent, 
when repentance is necessary, 
ceases to grow, or progress. The 
advancements that have been made 
in science, in the arts, in the medical 
profession, or in the laboratory, all 
have been wrought by reason of 
men leaving the old things which 
were proven wrong, and instead 
thereof adopting new methods, new 
truths taking the place of old errors, 
and the things that are needed to 
make life's work a success adopted. 
Every man and woman has to 
progress in like manner. A young 
man came to the Savior and asked 
what good thing he might do to 
gain salvation ; he was told of many 
things, not one only, that he must 
do, and then after he had accom- 
plished these, that he should follow 
the Master — not that he should 
walk near the Sea of Galilee, or 
over the mountains, following in the 
footsteps of the Master, but that in 
his life he should follow the ex- 
ample, and thus walk in the foot- 
steps of the Master. 

The Latter-day Saints have 
learned that those who will be saved 
must be faithful to the end, must be 
possessed of the spirit of repent-

ance. There is a thought in the 
minds of many of us that, once hav- 
ing repented of our sins, prior to 
entering the waters of baptism, we 
had then completed our repentance, 
and we have felt, Well, we have at- 
tended to that business, and we are 
now prepared to go on to perfec- 
tion. We have been looking at the 
big mistakes we have made in our 
lives, and are not altogether con- 
scious of the seriousness and im- 
portance of watching the little 
things. 

I stood by a great vessel not long 
ago, one that had crossed the sea 
again and again, a vessel that had 
been a target of shot and shell of 
the enemy, and was proof against 
the assaults that had been directed 
against it, yet it is now helpless, 
condemned, and not fit to go to the 
sea, because the innumerable barna- 
cles, little, insignificant insects, had 
eaten into the hull of the vessel and 
rendered it unseaworthy, it could 
no longer withstand the storms of 
the ocean, much less shot and shell. 
You have seen the mighty oak 
standing against the hurricane's 
blast, withstanding fierce winds and 
storms, but after the insidious work 
of a small insect that bores into the 
tree, and leaves it perforated with 
holes so small that they cannot be 
detected by the natural eye, it be- 
comes weakened and liable to fall 
with a light wind. So we have seen 
in the lives of men and women, who 
are unconscious of the little vital 
things that are eating and sapping 
the foundation of their individual 
lives, which may ultimately so 
weaken them that, when the tests 
are made, they fail. 

The conception which the Lord 
has given to the Latter-day Saints 
with reference to their earthly 
bodies is one that should cause us 



to honor, respect, and revere the 
body as a sacred instrument trusted 
into our hands for the purpose of 
making it submissive to the law of 
the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. 
We are told in the revelations that, 
before we came into this mortal 
life, we existed irj a spiritual world, 
and that the intelligence that dwells 
in each of us inhabited a spiritual 
body. How many ages we had that 
experience we know not, but it was 
long enough, evidently, for our in- 
telligence to attain control over that 
spiritual body, and we yielded to 
the law that was supreme in the 
spirit world ; that law was the Gos- 
pel of the Lord Jesus Christ. We 
are told that we are upon this earth 
because we did accept the Master, 
and agreed to stand by the decision 
rendered in His favor, when He was 
selected to be the Lamb to be slain 
for the redemption of mankind. We 
are here because we obeyed law 
there, and we have been sent into 
the world to see if we shall keep 
this, our second, estate. We knew 
and understood, before we came 
here, that it was only possible to ob- 
tain that progress which we sought 
for by obedience to law. We 
agreed, when we left the spirit 
world, to obey that law which we 
then acepted, the Gospel of the Lord 
Jesus Christ. That law is eternal. 
Numberless intelligences have been 
saved and exalted to kingdoms of 
glory before our clay and time, 
through obedience to that law. 
When we look out on the starry 
heavens at night, we see innumera- 
ble suns that, are centers of solar 
systems like unto ours, some un- 
doubtedly older than ours, greater, 
' mightier. Our sun is superior to 
the earth we inhabit, greater in di- 
mensions and power, but it, too, is 
under the influence of another 



106

mighty one that rolls above it; on 
and on they rise until men are lost 
in the contemplation. We have 
learned that upon those planets our 
Father's children dwell in all stages 
of perfection and advancement. 
There are those who are infinitely 
beyond us in eternal progress, who 
have reached their present degree 
of perfection by obedience to ever- 
lasting and irrevocable law. God 
Himself can not change that law, 
no more than He could obliterate 
the consequence of Adam's fall. He 
could not be God and violate a law 
which is eternal, and by obedience 
to which He became God. We came 
into the world and received this 
mortal tabernacle for the purpose 
of perfecting it, making ourselves 
subservient to the law by which we 
may be raised to perfection and be 
worthy of the companionship of our 
heavenly Father. 

There is in every human heart the 
consciousness of two forces work- 
ing. Every act that a man or 
woman undertakes to do is usually 
influenced by two suggestions, the 
one to do good, and the other to do 
evil. The spirit of truth will influ- 
ence us to yield obedience to the 
gospel law. The flesh is of the 
earth, and the earth is not yet re- 
deemed, it is under the bondage of 
the curse, and the flesh has to be 
mastered. The earth itself has to 
undergo the process of redemption, 
it has to obey the law, as the prophet 
said it would, and it will eventually 
become a celestial earth, the home 
of celestial beings. We are to mas- 
ter and control our fleshy bodies, we 
must make them submit to the Good 
Spirit which asserts what is right,' 
and detects what is wrong; that 
Spirit does not speak audibly to the 
physical ears, but is the "still, small 



voice" that speaks to the spirit of 
man. 

There is a warfare, a conflict be- 
tween good and evil in every human 
soul. How sad and pitiful' it is to 
see some of our Father's children 
yielding to the temptations that are 
set before them, the boy to taking 
the cigarette, drinking the forbid- 
den glass, debauching himself, and 
then declaring that he is free ! How 
pitiful it is to look upon those who 
might have been saved and exalted, 
wallowing in the gutter, so to speak, 
and almost lost to redemption! 
There are those who- feel that they 
cannot be free unless they take the 
liberty to participate m wrong and 
sin. I remember some of my own 
experiences, the temptation of the 
boys who wanted me to smoke, to 
drink liquor, get on a horse and 
raise a great disturbance, and be- 
cause I would not do it, being influ- 
enced by the counsel of my parents, 
they said, "He is tied to his mother's 
apron strings and daren't do it." 
That was pretty hard for a boy that 
wanted to be free, and wanted to let 
others know he was free. I thank 
God I did not take the course they 
followed to obtain freedom ! I re- 
member two of those boys, who 
drank and smoked, deserted school, 
went from petty to grand larceny, 
and were caught finally and brought 
to the county jail. In the conscious- 
ness of the terrible condition in 
which they were, with a possibility 
of years of solitary confinement be- 
fore them, deprived of the liquor 
and tobacco to which they had been 
addicted, they said, We cannot live 
and endure this punishment. One 
of them committed suicide, and the 
other went insane. 

In the State penitentiary of Idaho 
a few years ago, a young man who 
had committed a theft, in one of our 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD.

northern cities, said he could not 
stand fifteen years of prison and be 
denied the stimulants he desired and 
so he sought to escape. He walked 
back and forward behind the gate 
of the jail, waiting for a chance to 
break for liberty. The moment 
came, and he ran past the armed 
guards, but was shot down, with 
one limb almost torn from his body. 
Some time afterward he climbed 
upon the unfinished wall of the 
building, forty feet above the 
ground, and leaped in the hope of 
ending it all in death, but, as it hap- 
pened, he was only slightly injured. 
He was discouraged to such an ex- 
tent that, the last I knew of him, 
he was in the insane asylum. 

There are men who cannot en- 
dure the afflictions that come to 
them, and they seek to drown their 
sorrows in the glass, or morphine, 
or in death itself. Is that freedom ? 
What a pitiful thing to see a man 
made in the image of God, with the 
possibilities of rising to all that our 
Father is, allow the appetite of the 
flesh to overcome the spirit, master 
it, drag it down, and saturate it 
with everything that is contempti- 
ble, mean and low. I read of some 
morphine fiends confined in jail in 
this city, who desired the drug so 
intensely that they begged to be 
killed if they could not be given the 
drug. One of the officers said, 
"Stand over against that wall and 
I'll shoot you." And they said, 
"Shoot." The officer said, "I did 
not think you meant it." "We do," 
they said, "and would rather die this 
minute, for we must have it." Such 
is the terribly enslaved condition 
caused by yielding to the passions 
and appetites of the flesh until they 
are not servants but masters. 

The body that has been given to 
us was for the purpose of allowing 



the spirit to exalt itself to a nobler 
condition. The lightning that is 
seen flashing from cloud to cloud, 
from mountain top to mountain top, 
is an electrical force that may tear 
down buildings, set fire to prop- 
erty, and destroy life. Con- 
duct electricity through the dy- 
namo wire, and motor, and be- 
hold its wonderful, results work- 
ing for the service of man, accom- 
plishing something under the con- 
trol of a physical instrument, it thus 
becomes a power for good. So with 
steam, if allowed to evaporate free- 
ly it does little good, but restrain it 
in the boiler, send it through the 
engine, and under its power you 
may travel across the continent or 
sail from shore to shore. And so, 
too, with this highest, most potent 
of all spiritual forces, the intelli- 
gence that is in man ; enshrine it in 
a spiritual body, that it may have 
the experiences of spiritual life ; and 
then give it a physical body, that it 
may enter into and obtain the joy 
and experiences of physical life, and 
you have enlarged its powers im- 
measureably. Read this wonderful 
statement in the ninety-third sec- 
tion of the Doctrine and Covenants : 

"Every man is spirit, saith the 
Lord. The elements are eternal, and 
spirit and element, inseparably con- 
nected, receiveth a fulness of joy; and 
when separated, man cannot receive a 
fullness of joy. The elements are the 
tabernacle of God; yea, man is the 
tabernacle of God, even temples; and 
whatsoever temple is defiled, God 
shall destroy that temple." 

So we discover that it is essential 
and necessary, according to the law 
of the Lord, that the spirit shall be 
united with the flesh, for the pur- 
pose of redeeming that flesh and 
making it a fit companion for the 
spirit. I say the warfare goes on, 
and the end of that warfare will be 



108 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



when the man or woman says to the 
flesh, "You cannot violate the law of 
God, you cannot give loose rein to 
passion, you cannot have carnal ap- 
petite gratified, for it is against the 
law of life and of happiness ; thus 
far you can go but you cannot go 
any further." The man who suc- 
cessfully carries on the warfare dur- 
ing his earth life, notwithstanding 
he is constantly being tempted by 
the flesh, when he takes his body 
up, in the resurrection from the 
dead, the warfare will cease, the 
flesh will yield absolutely to the 
spirit, and there will be no more 
conflict nor struggle. But woe to 
that man who lays his body down 
with passion unconquered, with ap- 
petite and desire running rampant, 
and with a temper unrestrained in 
such vicious streaks that he almost 
becomes a candidate for the insane 
asylum! Woe to him, for he shall 
not receive his body in the resurrec- 
tion from the dead freed from such 
evil things. No, he shall have to 
overcome the evils he has acquired 
in this earth life, and he may find, 
too, that it will be harder to over- 
come in the next life than here, for 
everything there, hate, love, desire, 
all are intensified. Life here is in 
the clay state, we sometimes com- 
plain because it is so slow, it does 
not respond quickly, it seems plod- 
ding, the body does not acquire 
habits quickly. No man is a good, 
clean, virtuous man today and an 
immoral, depraved, wicked man to- 
morrow. These changes do not 
come rapidly; we should be thank- 
ful that we acquire them slowly, 
because thereby they may be ar- 
rested before they have developed 
to our serious injury. The body is 
as clay in the hands of the potter ; 
when the clay is moulded, given its 
shape, and allowed to stand, it be- 



comes hardened, then, O, how dif- 
ficult it is to remodel it, to recast it. 
So, if we mould and create evil 
habits, it will be exceedingly diffi- 
cult to reconstruct our characters 
after we have left this mortal life. 
After we have gone out of the flesh, 
and come to an understanding of 
the folly we have committed, we 
shall long for a chance to get back 
into that body, that we might bring 
it into subjection. 

While it is possible that men may 
repent and overcome in the life that 
is to come, this is the better time, 
this is the hour. We may not, in 
our future experiences, find oppor- 
tunity to repent, and make the flesh 
yield to the gospel as readily as in 
this present life. That man who 
has not conquered his temper, who 
flies in a rage at his wife or chil- 
dren, must master himself ; he can- 
not come into the presence of God 
in such a condition as that. That 
man or woman who has not over- 
come the sin of avariciousness, and 
do not respond in this life to God's 
law of tithing, cannot be trusted 
with the greater riches of eternal 
life. That man who covets the 
wealth of the world, and steals that 
which does not belong to him, must 
repent, master himself, and make 
restitution, for no man that is dis- 
honest can come into the Kingdom 
of God. That man who has not 
controlled his passions, and mas- 
tered himself, until he has full sway 
and power even over the thoughts 
of his mind, will not be allowed to 
associate with those that are pure 
and holy. That man who thinks 
he can escape the torments and 
afflictions of life by drinking intox- 
icating liquors, eating morphine, or 
committing suicide, is sadly mis- 
taken, he will have a terrible awak- 
ening. As Job said, "If I go to the

depths of hell, Lord, thou art 
there." We will have to look upon 
ourselves just as we are, and 
fashion ourselves as we desire to be. 
There is only one way by which any 
man or woman can get away from 
those things that afflict their lives, 
because of their transgressions, and 
that is every day to fill their life 
with acts of goodness, master self, 
and yield complete obedience to the 
laws of the Gospel. Remorse will 
then be blotted out, it will be dis- 
placed by the flowers that will blos- 
som in the mind and heart by rea- 
son of the mastery that has been 
accomplished. /The Lord has said, 
"Blessed is he that overcometh, for 
unto him shall all things be given, 
and I shall be his God and he shall 
be my son." 

The gratification of the desires 
of the flesh is devoid of sweetness 
and joy, it gives only transitory 
pleasure, and leaves a lasting sting. 
The man or woman who masters 
self, who overcome evil, shall ob- 
tain their reward in the celestial 
kingdom of God, and receive glory 
and exaltation, while they who neg- 
lect the opportunities of this life 
may have to wait ten thousand or a 
million years trying to overcome the 
sad effects of their neglect. Brothers 
and sisters, we all have weaknesses 
that we must overcome. While I 
say this, I believe with all my heart 
that I am speaking to the best peo- 
ple on earth. I believe there are no 
people in the world who have mas- 
tered and overcome mortal weak- 
nesses quite so well as we have. 
But, T want to see that mastery 
more complete. I want to see the 
children of those who have for- 
saken the sins of the world, who 
have left off the use of tea, tobacco, 
coffee and liquor, take advantage of 
the example of the fathers and 



mothers, thus each generation shall 
become more perfect, until we shall 
attain unto that which God has de- 
signed we should. 

God help us not only to be the 
best, but a perfect people, accepta- 
ble in the sight of God, that the day 
when the Son of God comes, to 
dwell among men on the earth, shall 
find us and our posterity living in 
complete accordance with the Gos- 
pel of the Lord Jesus Christ. Then 
shall we see His face and dwell in 
His presence. God grant that this 
may be our happy lot, I ask in Jesus' 
name. Amen.

(President of Pioneer Stake.) 

My brethren and sisters, I am 
here this afternoon in obedience to 
call, not with a desire to talk, for I 
feel incompetent and unable to do 
so. I want to tell you, after an 
experience of between fifty and 
sixty years in the Church, I enjoy a 
confidence and satisfaction in rela- 
tion to the truth of this work that 
gives me a great deal of joy. Each 
year adds to my confidence in the 
truth of this work. The knowledge 
of it gradually grows upon the 
mind through obedience to God's 
law, and in obedience to the coun- 
sels and instructions of His servants 
that preside over us. f am glad to 
have the confidence of our people, 
my brethren and sisters, with whom 
I labor and associate from day to 
day, and from year to year. Ninety- 
two years ago our Savior, accom- 
panied by His Father, came to 
earth, in compliance with the earn- 
est prayer of Joseph Smith, then a 
boy of fourteen and a half years of 
age, in the Springtime of the year

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



1820. A true knowledge of God 
was not on the earth, and had been 
absent for generations in the past, 
but on that occasion, the commence- 
ment of 'this great and glorious 
work in which we are engaged was 
inaugurated, although the Church 
was not organized until ten years 
later. This was the commencement 
of a great and glorious work, that 
could not be established without a 
perfect knowledge of the true char- 
acter of God, the Eternal Father, 
and of the Redeemer who made 
atonement for the children of men. 
Joseph Smith on that occasion asked 
the question, which one of all the 
religious sects was right. It had 
never dawned on his mind that they 
were all wrong. I will read from 
the Pearl of Great Price just one 
section in relation to the purpose 
for which he went to ask the Lord : 

"My object in going to inquire of the 
Lord, was to know which of all the sects 
was right, that I might know which to 
join. No sooner, therefore, did I get 
possession of myself, so as to be able to 
speak, than I aske'd the personages who 
stood above me in the light, which of all 
the sects was right (for at this time it 
had never entered into my heart that all 
were wrong), and which I should join. 
I was answered that I must join none 
of them, for they were all wrong, and the 
personage who addressed me said That 
all their creeds were an abomination in 
his sight ; that those professors were 
all corrupt, They draw near to me with 
their lips, but their hearts are far from 
me ; they teach for doctrine the com- 
mandments of men, having a form of 
godliness, but thy deny the power there- 
of." 

Is it intolerant, is it uncharitable 
to declare to the people of the world 
the word of God, as it was given 
to the Prophet Joseph Smith in 
1820? I say no, but the opinion of 
the world is very different. When 
we go into a Christian community 
and tell them the experience of Jos- 



eph Smith in going into the woods 
to pray, and the announcement that 
the Son of God made to him when 
he asked the question which he 
should join, I know that you, my 
brethren and sisters, feel like I do, 
that it is not intolerence, that it is 
not uncharitable to tell the people 
the truth as it has been given to us 
in the day in which we live. 

I believe in being obedient to the 
word of the Lord. I believe in giv- 
ing heed to the man who stands at 
the head of this Church today, who, 
if he sees danger ahead and fails to 
warn the people of it, comes under 
condemnation. But, when he warns 
the people, and gives them time to 
change their course, and turn away 
from the evil that is approaching, 
then if the people do not give heed 
to his word, they are under con- 
demnation, and his skirts are clear. 
Some of the people of the world, 
many of our outside friends, say 
"You have no mind of your own ; 
you are willing to be led by some- 
body else." Well, I want any man 
who thinks so to try me and see if 
he can lead me. I know what is 
good for me. I have the right to 
judge. I have my agency, and I in- 
tend to exercise it. I have found it 
profitable all through my life to 
give heed to that man who stands 
at the head, and, so far as God will 
give me help in the furture, I want 
to be found true to God, true to 
His work and to all the interests 
thereof, and to His people, men, 
women and _ children. 

I know that in "Mormonism" 
there is life eternal for every man 
and woman that will embrace it, 
and conform to it in their daily 
lives. Even boys and girls who 
have been properly taught in the 
homes, at the age of eight, when 
they are baptized into the Church of 



ELDER ANDREW JENSON. 



Ill 



Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 
are entitled to a testimony and 
knowledge of the truth of this work, 
just as much as I was at the age of 
18 or 19 years, because they are 
innocent, pure and clean before 
God, far better than the great ma- 
jority of men and women that enter 
into the Church through repentance 
and baptism. I contend that if the 
boys and girls are properly taught 
in the home they can have a knowl- 
edge of the truth of this work be- 
fore their baptism ; I have known 
boys less than eight years of age 
who have testified that they knew 
that this was the work of God. 

Brethren and sisters, let us try 
and reflect the truth in our lives, 
and live it in the home, that our sons 
and daughters may get the benefit 
of our example and teaching in their 
youth, and grow up full of faith, 
virtue, energy and power to serve 
the Lord and keep His command- 
ments, and our Father will be de- 
lighted with our work. 

May God bless the people of the 
Latter-day Saints. I love men and 
women that are true. I respect 
them with all my soul, because of 
their integrity and devotion to this 
great and glorious truth that our 
Father in heaven has revealed. May 
His blessing and peace be upon the 
Latter-day Saints in all their dwell- 
ing places, in all their settlements 
and abiding places, that they may be 
true to God, our heavenly Father 
and His Son Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER ANDREW JENSON. 

(Late President of Scandinavian Mis- 
sion.) 

I have been away from this beau- 
tiful land for over three years and 
a half, and during that time I have 
sojourned in Europe, mostly in the 
Scandinavian countries. I have 



also, during my absence, visited 
Germany a number of times, made 
one visit to France, Holland and 
Belgium, and have gone as far 
north as Iceland, near the Arctic 
circle. In returning home, I had 
occasion to go over the Trans- 
Siberian railway, and I imagine that 
I and my traveling companion were 
the first Mormon Elders who ever 
traveled home from Europe that 
way. On my return trip I had the 
privilege of seeing Siberia, visiting 
part of China, passing through 
Japan and visiting also, for the 
second time in my life, the beau- 
tiful Hawaiian Islands. 

During my absence abroad I have 
tried my best to be diligent and 
faithful. I have endeavored to 
labor with those talents and that 
physical and mental strength which 
God has given me for the advance- 
ment of the work of the Lord, and, 
in doing so, together with my breth- 
ren, who have stood faithful by my 
side, we have seen good fruits of 
our labors in those northern coun- 
tries, and it gives me great satisfac- 
tion to say that during the three and 
a half years that I labored there we 
added about thirteen hundred per- 
sons to the Church by baptism. 
During the same length of time we 
distributed about two and a half 
millions of books and tracts. 

To show what diligence can do, 
by the assistance of God, (who will 
always sustain those who will do 
His will and keep His command- 
ments,) I may add that I traveled 
nearly one hundred thousand miles 
while on my late mission, and I 
delivered something like eleven hun- 
dred sermons or public addresses, 
including nearly one hundred illus- 
trated lectures. We had consider- 
ible opposition in both Denmark and 
Norway, though there is religious

liberty in the northern countries. 
Next to America and England, we 
think that in Scandinavia we have 
the most liberal insitutions and the 
greatest individual freedom ; and 
when I say Scandinavia in this con- 
nection, I speak of Denmark, Swe- 
den and Norway. The mission that 
I presided over, however, does not 
include Sweden at the present time, 
but only Denmark and Norway; 
hence, when I speak of the additions 
to the Church, as I have done, it 
means only Denmark and Norway. 
Sweden is not included. 

The opposition that we met with 
in those lands was mostly on the 
ground of our bearing testimony of 
new revelation. In our preaching 
we can not refrain from speaking 
plainly about the revelation of God, 
given in these the last days to the 
Proohet Joseph Smith. The people 
in Scandinavia are like the people 
in nearly all other parts of the so 
called Christian world : they will 
believe in old revelations, though 
they do not make effort to live 
according to them, but they will 
almost invariably reject new reve- 
lation. The moment we tell them 
that God has spoken in our day, 
thev will harden their hearts and 
exclaim : "Sav anything but that ; 
preach about Christ and Him cruci- 
fied, but don't mention Joseph 
Smith ; don't mention the Book of 
Mormon ; don't mention the fact 
thpt angels have visited the earth 
in this day, for we will not believe 
it." On that ground we have met 
most bitter opposition, and we have 
had to contend hard against many 
odds in order to make headway, and 
in trying to break down superstition 
and to counteract the many accusa- 
tions and lies that have been circu- 
lated against us in these lands of the 
North. We have ever been subject 



to such opposition from the begin- 
ing, and up to the present time. 

My brethren, and sisters and 
friends, I have a word to say on this 
occasion in regard to revelation. I 
have traveled and preached some- 
what extensively in my life time, 
and if there is one thing that I like 
to speak about especially, it is the 
necessity of revelation. Here we 
stand under the great canopy of 
heaven, and in looking up toward 
the blue sky, we feel as though 
heaven was near above, that God is 
above and that He looks down upon 
us, and He is truly our God and 
our Father. He loves His children. 
It was said by the Prophet Isaiah, 
"Though a woman may forget her 
suckling child, yet God will not for- 
get His people," addressing Him- 
self to Zion, the chosen people in 
olden times, as well as in our own 
day. Now I am a strong believer 
in revelation from God. I feel that 
I cannot prosper or be safe without 
it. There is nothing in the world, 
in the shape of religion, that I can 
cleave to execpt that which comes 
from God. 

A few years ago I traveled con- 
siderably in the southeastern part of 
Utah and also through parts of New 
Mexico and Arizona. I passed 
through the canyons and defiles 
along the San Juan river and other 
mountain streams. I saw, high 
up on the cliffs, the remnants of the 
old cliff dwellers, and I saw many 
peculiar inscriptions on the walls. 
The question naturally arose, "Who 
made those figures on the walls? 
Who were the people that lived 
there in days gone by ?" The voices 
of those who once inhabited those 
regions are no more to be heard 
among the children of men ; but 
there is a God in heaven who has 
revealed something in regard to 



ELDER ANDREW JENSON.

those people, and that is contained 
in the Book of Mormon. But the 
Book of Mormon does not do full 
justice to the history of those peo- 
ple. It does not tell all about them 
that we would like to know, hence, 
we want more revelation concern- 
ing them. 

I went down on the Tongan 
islands, some years ago, and in go- 
ing through those islands, I dis- 
covered that the natives there knew 
something about the Law of Moses. 
In fact they kept the Law of Moses 
in their way ; and the question nat- 
urally arose in my mind : How did 
those people learn anything about 
the Law given on Mount Sinai. The 
learned men of the world do not 
know anything about it, and there 
is no man upon the earth that can 
tell by the aid of mere human learn- 
ing. The Rev. William West, who 
wrote a book entitled, "Twenty 
Years in Polynesia," could not solve 
the problem. He was at a loss to 
understand, and he says, "We must 
have some more intelligence before 
we can believe that these people are 
of Israelitish origin." But new rev- 
elation states in part who the Ton- 
gans are, and again, the Book of 
Mormon help us out; yet we want 
more revelation before we can fully 
understand who the Tongans, the 
Maoris, and kindred peoples are. 
We have an idea or a theory con- 
cerning them, and it is no doubt a 
correct one, to the effect, that they 
came from the land of America. 
But the. full history of those people 
can only become known by new 
revelation. 

Years ago I visited the Great 
Pyramid of Egypt, that grand stone 
structure standing so bold and beau- 
tiful in the Valley of the Nile, and 
as I stood upon that great struc- 
ture, looked clown upon the site of 



the ancient city of Memphis, and 
took in the view up and down the 
Nile valley, these thoughts came to 
me. "Who built these great pyr- 
amids? Who were the first people 
in this land?" The Pearl of Great 
Price tells us a little in regard to 
this matter, but not enough. We 
want more revelation before we can 
know who built the Great Pyramid 
of Egypt. Learned men may write 
books like the "Miracle in Stone," 
but it is not sufficient ; God shall in 
His own due time open the heavens 
and tell us more about it. At pres- 
ent we are at sea, figuratively 
speaking. 

I sojourned for a short time in 
Jerusalem in 1896. I also went up 
on the Mount of Olives, journeyed 
up and down the River Jordan and 
the Dead Sea, visited the Sea of 
Galilee, and saw many of those 
places that are mentioned in the his- 
tory of generations gone by. But 
what do we know about these places 
and the scenes enacted there? Very 
little. New revelation however can 
clear up the mystery, and to some 
extent it has done so ; but we look 
for more revelation to come. 

I traveled further and came over 
to Italy. I went to Rome, that 
"Eternal City," where I visited the 
greatest church building in the 
whole world — the magnificent St. 
Peters. I saw many people wor- 
shiping in there, but their mode of 
worship did not please me. I 
thought I beheld more fanaticism 
there than real worship, and I be- 
lieve that the people of Rome, the 
Roman Catholics, sincere as some 
of them may be, do not know how 
to worship God, nor how to pray 
to Jesus Christ in that great church 
in a way that is acceptable to our 
Heavenly Father. What do the 
people need? They want revela-

tion. One word from God would 
be worth more to mankind than all 
the bishops and popes of Rome have 
said for the last sixteen hundred 
years. 

In passing through Siberia and 
Russia I noticed an unusual num- 
ber of fine churches and chapels, 
and while the Saints in Utah de- 
serve a great deal of praise for 
erecting four beautiful temples, a 
number of large tabernacles, and 
about seven hundred beautiful 
meeting houses or churches — and 
we certainly have done well in 
erecting so many houses of wor- 
ship, and they are an honor to us — 
yet in passing through Russia, I 
found in the great cities of St._ 
Petersburgh, and Moscow, thous- 
ands of fine church buildings erect- 
ed for the worship of the Greek 
Catholics. In the city of Moscow 
alone there are nearly one thousand 
churches, including cathedrals, 
chapels, monasteries and smaller 
houses of worship ; most of them 
are beautiful structures, with gilded 
spires and costly ornamentation, 
both inside and outside. Yet what 
are the people of Russia ? What do 
they know about true worship? 
They only know what their priests 
have told them for many genera- 
tions, and that which the Czar of 
Russia compels them to believe, or 
at least accept openly. One word 
from God, or a few sections such 
as those that have been read to us 
this afternoon, would be worth 
more than all the Patriarchs of 
Constantinople and all the Czars of 
Russia have said from the begin- 
ning down to the present time. We 
want revelation, the only thing that 
can make the people wise unto sal- 
vation, and tell them about the true 
worship of God. 

I visited the Parliament of Re- 



ligions in Chicago, when the Tab- 
ernacle Choir first went there in 
1893, and I saw and listened day 
after day to the learned theologians 
of the world. There was gathered 
on that occasion the cream of the 
whole earth, because that Parlia- 
ment of Religions had invited, so to 
speak, all the learned men of the 
world to participate in its delibera- 
tions ; every denomination, save the 
denomination known as the Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints, was given access to that 
Parliament of Religions, and I 
think I can safely say that all who 
attended the meetings of that Par- 
liament listened with the greatest 
interest to the reading of the many 
well prepared documents that were 
presented ; but what were my feel- 
ings when I sat in the midst of that 
august body of learned men. "O ! 
I thought, if God would only open 
the heavens and speak to those peo- 
ple five minutes, He would tell them 
more truths during those five min- 
utes, and convey more intelligence 
leading toward the right worship of 
God, than all those learned men did 
in the three weeks' meetings held 
day after day at that great Chicago 
gathering. 

These are. still my convictions, 
my brethren and sisters. I believe 
in revelation from on high. I firmly 
believe that in the acceptance of old 
and new revelations lies the only 
safety for us, the children of God; 
and I believe that God, our heav- 
enly Father, is kind enough, and 
good enough, and loves us enough 
to answer our prayers and petitions, 
if we only seek Him in faith and 
sincerity. The Son of God said, "He 
that will do the will of my Father 
shall know whether the doctrine is 
of God, or whether I speak of my- 
self." I want to bear this testimony 



ELDER ANDREW JENSON. 



115 



to you, that in my travels abroad, 
and also in my associations with 
my brethren and sisters here at 
home, and particularly in associat- 
ing with my brethren of the Priest- 
hood, I have always been able to 
receive revelations from God. 

It has been said in this conference 
that every member of the Church is 
entitled to revelation. I want to 
testify to you, that I have repeated- 
ly sought God in the woods and 
hills of Scandinavia, in the wilds of 
Asia and Africa, upon the high seas, 
and in many places when I have 
been far away from my brethren 
who were entitled to give me ad- 
vice ; and I have always received 
sufficient revelation in answer to my 
prayers to lead, guide and direct me 
in my movements, and I have never 
been led astray when I have sought 
God in the proper way. This is my 
testimony. Even in the midst of 
political revolutions I have always 
known where I stood. I have never 
had to take counsel direct from my 
brethren on political matters. There 
is a God in heaven who reveals His 
secrets to His servants the Proph- 
ets, and we are all Prophets in a 
certain sense, if we are under the 
influence of the Holy Ghost, so far 
as that is concerned ; the most hum- 
ble man or woman in the Church 
can get down upon his or her knees 
in prayer, and the heavens will be 
opened in such a way that we will 
understand the will of God. Our 
prayers will ascend to God, and, if 
we are sincere and honest in our 
supplication, we will receive an an- 
swer through the still small voice 
which will guide our footsteps 
through life, and which will cause 
us to do the right thing at the right 
time, and to take such steps as we 
shall not subsequently have occa- 
sion to regret. 



I pray God, our heavenly Father, 
to bless the Household of Faith, 
both at home and abroad. We have 
over in the Scandinavian countries 
about four thousand Latter-day 
Saints. I again speak of Denmark 
and Norway. Including Sweden we 
would have between six and seven 
thousand members of the Church. 
They are, as a rule, a good and de- 
vout people. We find already tens 
of thousands of the sons and daugh- 
ters of the North in this land, right 
here in these mountain valleys ; and 
though there was a time when some 
of us scarcely knew whether we 
should rejoice or weep because we 
were of Scandinavian origin, I 
thank God that that time is past, 
and all that Brother McLachlan 
(who is a Scotchman) can say is 
that he is an improved Scandina- 
vian. (Laughter.) We have nearly 
all come from the northern coun- 
tries, directlv or indirectly ; and 
when the God of heaven, among 
the manv revelations that He in His 
mercy shall give unto us in the fu- 
ture, will reveal our genealogy, we 
will find some good reason why the 
'Scandinavian, the American, the 
English and the German peoples 
amalgamate so beautifully, with 
scarcelv any effort at all. We are 
all of Israel, and the history of our 
Church, so far, proves that when 
we preach the gospel to the differ- 
ent nations, kindreds, tongues and 
people, those people who are of 
Israel, or highlv pregnated with 
the blood of Israel, embrace the 
gospel more willingly than those 
who are not. In fact, the preach- 
ing of the gospel in our day has 
been done, principally, up to the 
present, for the purpose of gather- 
iner Israel from the North, from the 
Islands of the Sea, and from all 
countries whence the chosen seed

has been driven; for God remem- 
bers His promise to the Prophets 
of old : "He that scattered Israel 
shall gather them again." 

In conclusion I want to bring 
you a greeting of love and good 
will from your brethren and sisters 
in Denmark, Sweden and Norway, 
and I will here say that there are 
many good, honorable people in 
those countries. We have some 
noble and faithful sons of Utah 
over there now, and many who have 
labored there as missionaries in the 
past, putting forth their effort early 
and late to preach the gospel of the 
Lord Jesus Christ to their country- 
men, or in the lands where their 
parents first saw the light of day. 

May God bless you. May we ' 
always be the recipients of revela- 
tion to lead and guide us in all 
things, pertaining to our spiritual 
and temporal welfare, and may we 
always listen to the voice of the 
true Shepherd, and ultimately be 
saved in the Kingdom of God, is 
my prayer in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen.

Prof. W. C. Clive. 

ELDER JOHN L. HEREICK. 

(President of Western States Mission.) 

I will detain you but a very few 
minutes endeavoring to elucidate 
one thought, and I trust to have 
your assistance, your prayers, while 
I speak to you. This idea : The re- 
ligions of the world, all Christian 
denominations, if they are not open- 
ly opposing "Mormonism," they 
are secretly doing so. 

"For God so loved the world that He 
gave His only begotten Son, that who- 
soever believeth in Him might not per- 
ish but have everlasting life. For God 



sent not His Son into the world to con- 
demn the world, but that the world 
through him might be saved. He that 
believeth in Him is not condemned, but 
he that believeth not is condemned al- 
ready, because he hath not believed in 
the name of the Only Begotten Son of 
the Father. And this is the condemna- 
tion, that light is come into the werl'd, 
and men loved darkness rather than 
light, because their deeds were evil. For 
every one that doeth evil hateth the 
light, neither cometh to the light lest 
his deeds should be reproved. But he 
that doeth truth cometh to the light that 
his deeds may be made manifest that 
they are wrought in God." 

In the light of conditions as they 
exist today, it seems to me that 
these words of the Savior are per- 
tinent to us and our conditions. I 
saw, a few days ago, a dispatch 
purporting to come from the Rev. 
Charles B. Mitchell, pastor of St. 
James Methodist Episcopal church ; 
and this is what the minister said : 
"O God, send us another Bob In- 
gersoll to arouse the people. They 
sit in the pews with dull, dead in- 
difference that breaks our hearts. It 
would be better if they threw bricks 
at us as they did at Wesley. But 
they don't even talk back. This is 
an age of doubt. We ministers need 
more than an apostolic succession. 
This scoffing, indifferent, and God- 
less age. The pendulum I believe 
will soon begin to swing back." 
Quite an admission, my friends, it 
seems to me, when a minister of a 
great church will admit that they 
need something more than apostolic 
succession in order to get to the 
people of the world the principles 
of Tesus Christ. 

You cannot appreciate it at home 
what it means to preach religion to 
those that do not want it, for they 
reallv do not want it. You cannot 
appreciate what it costs to bring 
^onl^ into the Church of God. But 
T will undertake to say that in mon-

etary cost each one that joins our 
Church through baptism, in the 
world, costs at least $1,000 to 
$1,500 in missionary work. Some 
of them are worth it, and much 
more, and others are not worth the 
breath that we spend to preach a 
fifteen-minute sermon to them. But 
we have to put up with all. We 
have to give our testimony to the 
world. We have to say to them 
that there is a living, guiding faith 
that will lead men to eternal life, 
give them a salvation in this world, 
if they will but obey it. 

I say to you, my friends, it is not 
only the Protestant churches today 
that oppose "Mormonism," but the 
great Mother Church, which has 
heretofore apparently kept her 
hands off, is now joining hands 
with Protestants, trying to come, 
some of them, to. one common plat- 
form on which they all can stand. 
Stand against what? let me ask you. 
It is, stand against the Church of 
God ; that is what. You will find 
that the Church of Jesus Christ 
won't be asked to join with them 
when they get their platform fixed 
up. You say, "Well, what can you 
do?" We can do nothing, but con-* 
tinue to preach the principles of 
faith in God, in His Son Jesus 
Christ, and in the ordinances that 
He taught while He was in the 
earth. This thing, however, we may 
bear in mind, my brethren and sis- 
ters : "Blessed are ye when men 
shall revile you and shall persecute 
you and shall say all manner of evil 
against you falsely for my sake. 
Rejoice and be exceeding glad, for 
great shall be your reward in heav- 
en, for so persecuted they the 
prophets who were before you." 

May God's blessing be with you, 
nv brethren and sisters, and with 
all Israel. I testify to you that 



God's work is in the earth, and that 
He is seeking to redeem mankind 
through His gospel which He has 
established by divine revelation. 
And this light, this revelation, this 
living faith that is in the world to- 
day will redeem mankind, if they 
will listen unto its teachings and 
the voice of the servants of God. 
Amen. 

The congregation sang the hymn : 

Do what is right; the day-dawn is 
breaking, 

Hailing a future of freedom and 
light; 

Angels above us are silent notes tak- 
ings 

Of every action; do what is right! 

Benediction was pronounced by 
Elder Heber J. Romney. 



CLOSING SESSION. 

In the Tabernacle, at 2 p. m. 

President Joseph F. Smith called 
the meeting to order. 

Fred Graham, and the Taber- 
nacle choir, sang the hymn : 

O Zion, when I think of thee, 
I long for pinions like the dove, 

And mourn to think that I should be 
So distant from the land I love. 

Prayer was offered by Elder C. 
E. Middleton. 

A duet and chorus, "Christ Is 
Risen," was rendered by Rose 
Smithen, Carl Samuelson and the 
choir.

"Get the Spirit of God, and Keep It."— 
Testimony of the truth of latter-day 
revelations. 

I rejoice with you, my brethren 
and sisters, this afternoon, in the 



118 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



privilege that we enjoy of meeting 
in this sacred building, in confer- 
ence assembled to receive the word 
of the Lord. I endorse, most heart- 
ily, the truths that have been taught 
from this pulpit during this con- 
ference, and I take to myself the 
admonition of our beloved president 
with reference to the conditions 
that maintain in our beloved coun- 
try at the present time. I desire 
to repeat his admonition to us, that 
our Father is the source of inspira- 
tion in all things, both spiritual and 
temporal. We may petition the 
throne of grace in faith and our 
prayer will not be unanswered. 

In the language of a great 
prophet of Israel I would say to the 
Latter-day Saints, "Get the Spirit of 
God in your hearts and keep It; it 
will guide us into all truth ; it will 
be a panacea for all our ills ; it will 
enable us to look forward to the 
coming- of the risen Redeemer con- 
fident that He shall come again in 
the clouds of heaven." Possessing 
that Snirit, our ambition will not be 
a selfish one. but with charity in our 
hearts for all mankind, love for all 
our Father's children, we will min- 
gle with them dav by dav, and the 
influence we radiate will be one of 
love and kindness that will have its 
influence for good upon every child 
of our Father with whom we come 
in contact. 

Mav the Lord add His blessing; 
nipv His peace be upon all Israel. 
T desire to add my testimony to 
*"ho?p already borne. I know that 
the Book of Mormon contains the 
«-ord of God. and that it supple- 
ments the other sacred scrintures of 
T°wish Israel. I know that the 
"Hnetrine and Covenants is the word 
"f the Lord to us in this day; and I 
Wiow that the S"ne Power that 
gave the instructions contained in 



those volumes still is supreme. He 
will continue to feed us the bread of 
life as we need it from time to time, 
if we will but live in accordance 
with the teachings we have already 
received. God grant that we may 
evidence our faith and devotion to 
the cause with which we are iden- 
tified, by lives of purity and right- 
eousness, doing good to all men, is 
my prayer in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 

PATRIARCH HYRUM G. SMITH. 

Young people admonished to shun ex- 
isting evils. 

In the presence of this vast con- 
gregation, and in the presence of 
men much older than I, both in ex- 
perience and in years, I certainly 
feel my weakness in standing be- 
fore you, my brethren and sisters, 
and I pray that the Spirit of the 
Lord will continue to be with us. 

I have enjoyed this conference 
above all others that I have ever 
attended. This to me is the first 
privilege of standing before so 
great a number of people. Without 
'the Spirit and blessings of our 
Father in heaven, I feel that I will 
be unable to magnify the calling 
and position that has come to me. 
I desire an interest in your faith 
and prayers continually. 

I know that this is the work of 
the Lord, and that we are His 
chosen people in these the last clays. 
Where much is given much is ex- 
pected ; and I do earnestly pray that 
both young and old will take to 
heart the instructions that have 
been given by our prophet, and by 
those who have followed him, in 
teaching and warning us concerning 
these trying times, and in regard 
to our lives as Latter-day Saints. I

do hope, and pray, that the young 
people especially will take the ad- 
vice of those who are older, and not 
go into by and forbidden paths, and 
partake of the evils that exist in our 
midst, by following bad examples 
set before us by those who are not 
of us. Let us look to our leaders, 
those who hold the Holy Priest- 
hood, and take their advice, and, 
in the spirit of humility and prayer, 
I feel sure that if we take this ad- 
monition we shall not go astray 
spiritually, but be raised up by the 
power of the Lord and made equal 
to the responsibilities as they come 
to us from our fathers. 

Again I say, that in the presence 
of this vast congregation and those 
of experience in the work, I feel my 
weakness, but I testify that the 
Spirit of the Lord has been with us 
and we have been blessed. I pray 
that His spirit will go with us, and 
help us to put into practice the 
teachings given at this conference, 
and that when we go away we shall 
not say, "What a splendid confer- 
ence we have had," and then in a 
few days forget it. May the teach- 
ings given burn within our hearts 
that we may be given courage, and 
strength of mind and body, to serve 
the Lord and keep His command- 
ments, that we may be His children 
in very deed, and be worthy of the 
blessings He has in store for us, is 
my prayer in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 



PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 

I would like to say for the infor- 
mation perhaps of a great many of 
the Latter-day Saints who are pres- 
ent here today, that the last speaker 
is the great-grandson of the Patri- 
arch Hyrum Smith, and who now 



holds the position of Presiding 
Patriarch in the Church. 

ELDER DAVID 0. JTKAT. 

Strength of the Church is individual 
testimony. — Obedience the key to 
knowledge of truth. — Benefit of 
Church to individuals. — Church mem- 
bers advised to restrain contention. 

I pray , for the inspiration of the 
Lord, that I may speak those things 
that will be in harmony with His 
will — that is the prayer of my heart 
this afternoon. 

"Be it known unto you all and to 
all the people of Israel that by the 
name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth 
whom ye crucified, whom God raised 
from the dead, even by Him doth this 
man stand here before you whole. 
This is the stone which was set at 
naught of you builders which has be- 
come the head of the corner; neither 
is there salvation in any other, for 
there is none other name under 
heaven given among men whereby we 
must be saved." 

So spake Peter, the chief apos- 
tle when he was arraigned before 
the judges for having healed the 
impotent man. He bore a strong 
testimony to those people who but 
a short time before had partici- 
pated, directly or indirectly, in the 
crucifixion of the Savior. They 
warned Peter and John not to 
preach Jesus Christ and Him cru- 
cified, but when they perceived the 
boldness of Peter and John, and 
saw the impotent man standing be- 
fore them whole, they counseled 
among themselves what to do. 
Then they returned and cautioned 
the apostles not to preach Jesus 
Christ to the people. At that point 
Peter and John, under the inspira- 
tion of the Holy Spirit, answered, 
"Whether it is right in the sight of 
God to harken unto you more than 



120

unto God judge ye, for we cannot 
but speak the things which we have 
seen and heard." On several dif- 
ferent occasions the prophet Joseph 
Smith was asked by non-members, 
curious visitors to Nauvoo and 
other cities in the early history of 
this Church, what was the secret of 
the strength that seemed to be 
manifest in the Church in the early 
days. On one occasion, to be spe- 
cific, he was asked how he gov- 
erned this people and his answer 
was, "I teach them correct princi- 
ples, and they govern themselves." 
People today wonder wherein lies 
the secret of the growth, stability 
and vitality of the Church of 
Christ. Those who are prejudiced 
when they come in our midst are 
convinced that there is something 
within the Church that those not 
of us do. not comprehend. Recent- 
ly a young lady from the East spent 
a few weeks amongst us, visiting 
friends. Evidently her mind was 
previously filled with prejudice 
against the people of Utah, partic- 
ularly against the Church. But she 
went around with some of her 
friends who were actively engaged 
in Religion Class work, some who 
were actively engaged in primary 
and others in Sunday School. One 
day when they returned from some 
of this regular work, she made this 
remark: "Well, there must be 
something in this Church or so 
many intelligent men and women 
would not be so actively engaged 
in it. Why, I almost feel that I 
want to enter in the work myself." 
You, no doubt, have met people 
who, seeing perhaps some such 
demonstration as this of the 
strength of Israel, wonder how it 
is that this Church manifests such 
vitality and growth. The secret is 
this, that every true Latter-day 



Saint possesses individually the as- 
surance that this is the work of 
God, the same power that gave Pe- 
ter and John strength to stand be- 
fore their accusers and declare 
openly and boldly in the Sanhedrin 
that "Jesus whom ye crucified is 
the power by which this man was 
made whole," that His name is the 
only name given among men by 
which they can be saved. 

The secret lies in the testimony 
possessed by each individual who is 
faithful in the membership of the 
Church of Christ, that the gospel 
consists of correct principles. It 
is that same testimony that was 
given to Peter, which he expressed 
when Christ* asked His disciples 
"whom do men say that I am?" 
"Some say thou art this prophet, 
some say thou art that; some say 
thou art Elias." "But whom do ye 
say that I am?" And Peter an- 
swered, "Thou art the Christ the 
Son of the living God." "Blessed 
art thou, Simon Barjona; flesh and 
blood hath not revealed this unto 
you, but my Father which is in 
heaven ; I say unto thee that thou 
art Peter, and upon this rock will 
I build my Church, and the gates 
of hell shall not prevail against it." 
This testimony has been revealed 
to every sincere man and woman 
who has conformed to the princi- 
ples of the gospel of Jesus Christ, 
obeyed the ordinances and become 
entitled to and have received the 
Spirit of God, the Holy Ghost, to 
guide them. Every individual 
stands independent in his sphere in 
that testimony, just as these thou- 
sands of incandescent lamps which . 
have made Salt Lake City during 
the last week so brilliant at night, 
each one of which stands and 
shines in its own sphere, yet the 
light in it is produced by the same 



ELDER DAVID 0. McKAY.

power, the same energy, from 
which all the other lights receive 
their energy. So each individual 
in the Church stands independent- 
ly in his sphere, independently in 
the knowledge that God lives, that 
the Savior is the Redeemer of the 
world and that the gospel of Jesus 
Christ has been restored through 
the Prophet Joseph Smith. Now 
it is given unto some, says the 
Lord in the Doctrine and Cove- 
nants, to know by the Holy Ghost 
that Jesus is the Son of God and 
that He was crucified for the sins 
of the world. It is to these I refer 
who stand firm upon the rock of 
revelation in the testimony that 
they bear to the world. But the 
Lord says further there are others 
to whom it is given to believe upon 
the testimony of others' words, that 
they may also receive salvation if 
they continue faithful. To all these 
however, there comes the testimony 
also of daily experience. The Lat- 
ter-day Saints throughout the 
world find confirmation of their 
testimony in every performance of 
duty. They know that the gospel 
teaches them to be better individ- 
uals; that obedience to the princi- 
ples of the gospel makes them 
stronger men, and truer women. 
Every day such knowledge comes 
to them, and they cannot gainsay 
it ; they know that obedience to 
the gospel of Jesus Christ makes 
them better and truer husbands, 
true and honored wives, obedient 
children. They know that obedi- 
ence to the principles of the gospel 
makes them in every respect ideal 
home-builders ; the ideal is there, 
they sense it in their minds, they 
cannot gainsay it, they know it, 
and they know that transgression 
of these principles will have the 
opposite effect upon their individ- 



ual lives and upon their home lives. 
They know that obedience to the 
gospel fosters true brotherhood 
and fellowship among mankind; 
they know that they are better cit- 
izens by virtue of obedience unto 
the laws and ordinances. So, as 
they go through their daily acts, 
and apply religion in their vocation, 
the truth of the Gospel becomes 
exemplified in their lives. Thus, 
with the testimony of the Spirit, the 
testimony of reason, and the testi- 
mony of daily experience, the Lat- 
ter-day Saints throughout the 
world must stand impregnable. 

I was strongly impressed the 
other day in reading a book writ- 
ten by a man who is looking for a 
church that will eventually domi- 
nate the world. This is the church 
he describes, and I want to read it, 
having in mind the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints: 

"The church that can say to the 
unchurched, Our way is best because 
it works best, our people are efficient, 
prosperous and happy because we are 
a body who aid one another in the 
productive life; we waste none of our 
substance in vice, luxury or ostenta- 
tion; we do not dissipate our energy 
in brawling, gambling or unwhole- 
some habits; we conserve our re- 
sources of body and mind and de- 
vote them to the upbuilding of the 
kingdom of God, which is not a 
mystical, but a real kingdom; it is a 
body of people dominated by ideals 
of productivity, which is mutual ser- 
vice. We do not strive for the things 
that satisfy but for the moment and 
then leave a bad taste; we strive for 
the things which build us up and en- 
able us and our children to become 
strong: to flourish and to conquer. 
We strive to make ourselves worthy 
to receive the world by fitting our- 
selves to use the world more produc- 
tively than others. We believe that 
obedience to God means obedience 
to the laws of nature, which are but 
the uniform manifestations of His 
will, and we try by painstaking study 



122 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



to acquire the most complete and ex- 
act knowledge of that will, in order 
that we may conform ourselves to it. 
We believe that reverence for God is 
respect for these laws; that meek- 
ness is teachableness and willingness 
to learn by observation and experi- 
ence; by practicing this kind of meek- 
ness or teachableness we believe that 
we shall inherit the earth, whereas, 
the unmeek, the unteachable, who are 
dominated by pride of tradition shall 
not. We offer you hard work, frugal 
fare, severe discipline, but a share in 
the conquest of the world for the re- 
ligion of the productive life. Such a 
church is founded upon the rock of 
economic efficiency and the gates of 
hell shall not prevail against it." 

My testimony and yours is that 
this church of Christ can offer to 
the unchurched all the good things 
which this author is looking for, 
and more ; because God has re- 
vealed more in the government and 
conduct of His church. 

Now brethren and sisters, the 
testimony of the gospel is an an- 
chor to the soul in the midst of 
confusion and strife. Cannot we 
afford, then, possessing that testi- 
mony, to manifest to the world an- 
other attribute of the Church of 
Christ, which is love? Knowledge 
of God and His laws, means sta- 
bility, means contentment, means 
peace, and with that a heart full of 
love reaching out to our fellow 
man offering the same blessings, 
the same privileges. Love will be- 
get tolerance and kindness. Now 
I bespeak that during the next 
month or so, when our little towns 
and cities, and states will be more 
or less stirred up by political con- 
tention, that we remember to have 
charity and love for one another. 
Oh, let us not deal in personalities 
and tear down a brother's reputa- 
tion and hurt his feelings. We are 
striving to establish the kingdom 
of God ; let us hold to that fact as 



the anchor of our soul and then 
breathe forth charity and love to 
those who may not see just as we 
do. I mean that while we are urg- 
ing our particular political belief, 
that we avoid dealing in personal- 
ities ; we cannot afford to hurt a 
brother's feelings and wound him. 
I believe, with a western poet, that 
it isn't worth while : 

"Ts it worth while that we jostle a 
brother, 

Bearing his load on the rough road 
of life? 

Is it worth while that we jeer at each 
other — 

In blackness of heart, that we war 

to the knife? 
God pity us all in our pitiful strife. 

"God pity us all as we jostle each 
other; 

God pardon us all for the triumph 
we feel 

When a fellow goes down 'neath his 

load on the heather 
Pierced to the heart: Words are 

keener than steel, 
And mightier far for woe than for 

weal. 

****** 
"Is it worth while that we battle to 
humble 

Some poor fellow down into the 
dust? 

God pity us all! Time too soon will 
tumble 

All of us together, like leaves in the 
gust, 

Humbled, indeed, down into the dust." 

Then, in conclusion, let us stand 
with our hearts centered and our 
minds firmly fixed upon this eter- 
nal truth — that the gospel of Jesus 
Christ is among men for the re- 
demption and salvation of the hu- 
man family. Let us go forth in 
the spirit of that, dealing with our 
fellows in the spirit of love and 
kindness. Let us work in our coun- 
cils, in our quorums, guided by 
that same spirit, for the Church in 
the midst of political strife and so-

cial unrest will stand, to use Gold- 
smith's words, 

"As some tall peak that lifts its awful 
form, 

Swells from the vale and midway 

leaves the storm, 
Though round its base the rolling 

clouds are spread, 
Eternal sunshine settles on its head." 

God grant that we remain true 
to this Church ; that we may ever be 
found defending the men whom 
God has called to guide us and re- 
alize that harmony with them 
means that we are in harmony with 
God for He sustains them. Amen. 

The hymn, "O, give me back my 
Prophet dear," was sung by James 
Moncar, Hyrum J. Christiansen, 
Howard Anderson and Walter 
Lamoreaux. 

ELDER JOSEPH F. SMITH, JR. 

John Taylor's hymn a loving tribute to 
the martyrs. — The Church continu- 
ously guided by a Prophet. — Counsels 
of inspired men should be heeded. 

I have been deeply impressed and 
edified during the sessions of this 
conference in listening to the re- 
marks of the brethren, and I rejoice 
with you, my brethren and sisters, 
in the counsel and instructions that 
have been imparted unto us by 
those who stand at the head, who 
are possessed of the Spirit of the 
Lord, and whose right it is to teach 
Israel. I have also been impressed 
this afternoon by the singing of this 
hymn, sacred to me, composed by 
President Taylor, who dearly loved 
the Prophet Joseph Smith. I never 
read this hymn or hear it sung 
without being touched in my soul 
and I shall take the liberty this 
afternoon, in my weak arid imper- 
fect way, to read it. for I realize 



that in the singing we do not always 
get the full comprehension of the 
words, which may not be impressed 
upon our souls, especially in a large 
gathering such as this, as we would 
like to have them : 

O, give me back my Prophet dear, 

And Patriarch, O give them back, 
The Saints of Latter-days to cheer, 

And lead them in the Gospel track ! 
But, O, they're gone from my embrace, 

From earthly scenes their spirits fled, 
Two of the best of Adam's race, 

Now lie entombed among the dea'd. 

Ye men of wisdom, tell me why — 
No guilt, no crime in them were 
found — 

Their blood doth now so loudly cry, 
From prison walls and Carthage 
ground : 

Your tongues are mute, but pray attend, 
The secret I will now relate, 

Why those whom God to earth did lend, 
Have met the suffering martyrs' fate. 

It is because they strove to gain, 

Beyond the grave a heaven of bliss, 
Because they made the gospel plain 

And led the Saints to righteousness; 
It is because God called them forth, 

And led them by His own right hand, 
Christ's coming to proclaim on earth, 

And gather Israel to their lan'd. 

It is because the priests of Baal 

Were desperate their craft to save, 
And when they saw it doomed to fail, 

They sent the Prophets to their grave. 
Like scenes the ancient Prophets saw, 

Like these the ancient Prophets fell, 
And, till the resurrection dawn, 

Prophet and Patriarch, farewell. 

My heart is always touched when 
I hear this beautiful hymn, or when 
I read it. I understand the spirit 
that rested upon President Taylor 
when he wrote it ; but I rejoice, my 
brethren and sisters, in this fact — 
although the prophet who stands at 
the head of the dispensation of the 
fullness of times, and the patriarch 
who stood with him have been taken 
from us, the Lord has not left us

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



helpless. There has never been a 
time since the restoration of the 
Gospel when we have not had a 
prophet, some one to lead us, to 
direct us, to teach us the command- 
ments of God that we might walk 
in the straight and narrow path. We 
are not without leaders; and the 
time shall never come when the 
Lord will not find some one that 
He can trust ; in whom He has con- 
fidence, and who will be qualified to 
stand to represent Him among the 
people. This is my testimony and 
I rejoice in its truth. I do not feel 
that because the Prophet was taken 
and the Patriarch ; because Pres- 
ident Young was taken, or Pres- 
ident Taylor and other leaders were 
taken, that the time has come when 
we have not an inspired leader to 
teach us the truth. The time will 
never come when we will not be 
able to put confidence and exercise 
faith in the teachings and in the 
instruction of those who lead us. I 
am satisfied of this for I know the 
promises of the Lord are sure. I 
know that these things are true ; the 
Lord has not forsaken His people, 
and will be with them even to the 
end. Therefore it behooves us, as 
Latter-day Saints, to put our trust 
in the presiding authorities of the 
Church, in the Priesthood of God; 
and accept of their teachings. 

No man ever went astray by fol- 
lowing the counsel of the author- 
ities of the Church. No man who 
ever followed the teachings or took 
advice or counsel from the one who 
stands as the representative of the 
Lord ever went astray; but men 
who have refused to accept counsel 
have gone astray and into . forbid-, 
den paths, and in some instances 
have even denied the faith. Others 
who went astray because they failed 
to understand and to heed the coun- 



sels that were given unto them for 
their eternal good, have humbled 
themselves and come back to the 
Church acknowledging their error. 
In connection with this I desire to 
read just a word or two from the 
revelation, known as the preface 
that the Lord gave to His book of 
commandments : 

"Wherefore the voice of the Lord is 
unto the ends of the earth, that all that 
will hear may hear : Prepare ye, prepare 
ye for that which is to come, for the 
Lord is nigh ; and the anger of the Lord 
is kindled, and His sword is bathed in 
heaven, and it shall fall upon the inhabi- 
tants of the earth ; and the arm of the 
Lord shall be revealed ; and the 'day 
cometh that they who will not hear the 
voice of the Lord, neither the voice of 
His servants, neither give heed to the 
words of the prophets and apostles, 
shall be cut off from among the people ; 
For they have strayed from mine ordi- 
nances, and have broken mine everlast- 
ing covenant ; they seek not the Lord 
to establish His righteousness, but every 
man walketh in his own way, and after 
the image of his own Go'd, whose image 
is in the likeness of the world, , and 
whose substance is that of an idol, 
which waxeth old and shall perish in 
Babylon, even Babylon the great, which 
shall fall." 

Therefore, we must put our faith 
in those whom the Lord hath called, 
if we want to have a standing be- 
fore the Lord, and none of us de- 
sire, if we have the proper spirit, 
to be cut off from among the peo- 
ple. But this punishment will be- 
fall those who do not prove faithful 
and will not pay that heed or give 
that attention to the counsel of those 
who are called and appointed and 
inspired of the Lord to teach and 
direct us in all things. 

We should be first and foremost, 
as it has already been expressed, 
for the kingdom of God and His 
righteousness. Let us be true and 
faithful always, with a desire to

keep the commandments of the 
Lord and honor Him and remember 
the covenants we have made with 
Him. This is my prayer in behalf 
of all Israel in the name of the 
Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER JAMES E. TALMAGE. 

Modern revelation essential.— The latest 
news eagerly awaited. — The Bible not 
the only book of scripture. — Irrational 
to believe that God has not spoken to 
man since the Bible record closed. — 
The Church is truly progressive and 
up to date. — True and false progres- 
sivism. — This nation a nation of prom- 
ise. — This land a land of liberty. — 
True liberty and its spurious imita- 
tions. — Many counterfeits and adulter- 
ations on the market today. — Satan a 
clever imitator. — True liberty distin- 
guished from license. — The right to 
seek advice. — False liberty is selfish- 
ness. — The present is built upon the 
foundation of the past. — The Consti- 
tution of our nation an inspired docu- 
ment. — The coming of the Christ near 
at hand. 

In common with many thousands 
present, I too have rejoiced in the 
words to which we have listened 
during this conference, and more 
than in the words have I found joy 
in the spirit that has been mani- 
fest in the utterances of the speak- 
ers and in the receptive condition 
of the hearers. We cannot be ob- 
livious to the fact that there has 
been manifest amongst this vast 
assembly this afternoon and in the 
assemblies that have marked the 
preceding sessions of this confer- 
ence, a spirit of unanimity and har- 
mony that testifies to the presence 
of the Spirit of God. I have never 
had any fear that discord would be 
preferred by the Latter-day Saints 
to harmony, and I know that the 
people are standing as a whole true 
to the faith, true to their covenants, 
true to their duty and obligations as 



Latter-day Saints, — that is to say, 
holy ones of the latter days. I am 
glad to have been present, to have 
heard the latest word, to be in- 
formed as to the most recent news 
in this great kingdom of the Lord, 
for it is characteristic of the spirit 
of this work and of this people that 
we are not content with the news of 
the past but are ever listening for 
the ' latest and the newest news if 
you please. 

Doubtless you were impressed as 
was I by the manner in which the 
article of faith relating to continu- 
ous revelation was read to you or 
quoted to you this morning. That 
is one of the fundamentals, one of 
the essential features of the Church 
of Christ, that we believe not only 
in what God has revealed, but in 
that which He does now reveal ; and 
moreover we are living in confident 
assurance that He will yet reveal 
many great and important things 
pertaining to the kingdom of God. 
These bound volumes of scripture 
are necessary and essential to us, — 
the Bible, the Book of . Mormon, 
and more modern records, — abso- 
lutely essential for our instruction 
and guidance, but we want in addi- 
tion something later and more 
nearly adapted to the times. This 
book known as the Holy Bible pro- 
fessedly ends as a historical record 
about one hundred years after the 
birth of Christ, and there be some 
who say that God hath not spoken 
since that time, that for nearly 
nineteen hundred years He has never 
uttered a word by way of direct 
instruction unto His people. I can- 
not believe it ; I cannot accept any 
such creed, nor have I room in my 
heart for any such belief, for in 
every other field of human thought 
we are ever on the alert for the new. 
Not content with bound books we 



126 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



look eagerly for the issues of 
monthly magazines, weekly journals, 
and moreover we would not know 
how to get along without our daily 
papers, each one telling in part 
what God hath wrought since the 
last issue left the press : Nor are 
we content with such, for here day 
after day I see great crowds about 
the bulletin boards too eager to rest 
contented until the next issue, too 
eager to know what has been done 
— aye, what God hath done in for- 
warding His plans and purposes 
among men during the last few 
hours. And yet in spite of that, as 
the prevailing spirit of the times, I 
say there be some who say that God 
hath not spoken concerning the 
affairs of the kingdom since about 
one hundred years after the birth 
of His Son. He has spoken much 
in the realm of science and discov- 
ery ; He has made known many 
great truths through His servants, 
the inventors, but He has not 
spoken concerning the way in which 
His people should walk to find their 
way back into His presence. I say 
again, it is unfitting, it is unsuited, 
such a belief as that, to the spirit of 
the times, to the modern day in 
which we live, and I rejoice in be- 
longing to a church that is in a 
measure up, to date, and down to 
date, that gives me news of the 
present and that gives me the Word 
of God concerning the affairs of 
my life and the duties that lie im- 
mediately before me. I rejoice in 
the progressivisrn of this Church 
and more particularly in the fact 
that its orogressivism is of the right 
kind. It is not that so-called pro- 
gressivisrn that seeks to belittle or 
destrov the achievements of the 
past ; it is not a progressivisrn that 
seeks to tear down, that says our 
fathers were wrong and we know 



more than they did ; that they laid a 
foundation which in its way was 
good but not sufficient for> us to 
build upon. We have no such spirit 
of progression as that, for that is 
destruction. The spirit of advance- 
ment and progressivisrn in the 
Church of Christ is that which 
marks the progression from the 
seed to the blade and from the 
blade to the ripened ear. It is a 
constructive progressivisrn ; the 
past is added to, and every new 
revelation doth but make the reve- 
lations of the past plainer and re- 
veal their sanctity and their sacred 
origin the better. I ask you, have 
you yet discovered in this volume 
of modern scripture, the Doctrine 
and Covenants, one utterance that 
is in any manner opposed to the 
spirit of the scriptures of the past? 
It will be time to raise objection to 
modern revelation when w'e find 
that such revelation is in opposition 
.to the spirit of the Word of God 
of past times ; but when the'modern 
utterances are plainly but later 
works of the same author, why 
need we complain? I rejoice, too, 
in the measure of liberty which is 
assured to us as members of this 
Church and I have been greatly 
edified and pleased in listening to 
what has been said respecting lib- 
erty and freedom. I believe that . 
we should give thanks unto God for 
our privileges of citizenship in this 
great nation, for mark you, this is a 
nation that shall stand for liberty, 
for it hath been so predicted. It 
has been prophesied and the proph- 
ecy has been proclaimed through 
the modern prophet, Joseph Smith, 
that centuries ago — aye, dating back 
five hundred years or more before 
the meridian of time, — it was de- 
clared that this land should in the 
latter days be a land of liberty and 



ELDER JAMES E. TALMAGE.

no king should rule here. I take it 
that means no king by name or by 
pretension ; no one shall exercise 
imperial powers among the citizens 
of this great nation, until Christ, 
the King, shall come to rule and 
reign. But as I listened to my 
brethren expressing their joy and 
gratitude at this full measure of 
liberty which we seem to enjoy, I 
asked myself if we are always sure 
that we do not accept the imitation 
for the real. You know this is a 
day of imitations, a day of adultera- 
tion and counterfeits, a day when 
shoddy is palmed off for all-wool 
cloth, and gilded brass passes too 
often current for genuine gold ; aye, 
a clay when glass paste does duty 
as diamonds of the first water. Of 
all the imitators, of all the counter- 
feiters, Satan is the chief, for he 
has had the greatest experience and 
the longest training and he is a 
skillful salesman ; he not only knows 
how to manufacture his spurious 
goods, but how to put them upon 
the market. And it is wonderfully 
attractive — the way in which he does 
up those little packages in bright- 
colored paper, tied with tinsel string 
to attract ; and we are very apt 
to pay the price asked before we 
open the package. And do you 
know of all the counterfeits and of 
all the imitations that the devil has 
put forth on sale, I know of none 
that is more dangerous than his 
spurious brands of liberty and free- 
dom, such as are being offered on 
every hand. Some of them are 
so rank as to be a stench in the 
nostrils of a normal man. How 
shall we distinguish between the 
genuine and the imitation, you may 
ask? Is it necessary that we get 
expert advice and call in a profes- 
sional chemist to make the analysis? 
Oh. there are simple tests by which 



you can determine. You can al- 
ways tell after consumption whether 
it was the genuine or not, for the 
imitation leaves a wretchedly bad 
taste in the mouth, but that test 
may not be as serviceable as one 
that may be applied before taking. 
Well, you will find that true liberty 
always works both ways, it never 
works one way alone, but is of uni- 
versal application. For example, I 
hear some men say that they claim 
the right to speak out and say 
just what they like. They make 
that claim that they have the right 
to speak out and say just what they 
like to say. I grant you that is true 
if you will let it apply the other way 
as well. I have the right to be 
safeguarded against utterances 
which are offensive to hear. If a 
man says that he under the guise of 
his rights as a free citizen may 
swear and use vile and obscene lan- 
guage, and may profane the name 
of God, I say to you that is not lib- 
erty, that is a license that is illegal. 
I hear some men say that they are 
free citizens and they are not going 
to be told what to do. I grant them 
that right, but by the same token 
T claim the right to seek advice if 
T want it and to go to whomsoever 
I choose for the advice and counsel 
which I desire. Now the men who 
say that they don't want to be told, 
usually find fault with their brothers 
who are willing to be told, usually 
criticise them because they are will- 
ing to be advised and guided. I 
claim the right to give advice to my 
brother if I do it in a manner to 
cause him no offense. I claim the 
right, if I so choose, to publish my 
views in magazine or newspaper or 
book if I can make arrangements 
with the publishers, I have that 
perfect right as long as I say noth- 
ing in my publication inimical to

the rights of men nor contrary to 
law and order, ana you have the 
right to read my writings or not 
just as you choose. I cannot force 
them upon you, but if there be some 
who do choose to read them and 
who are willing to be influenced and 
guided by them, what business is 
that of others who refuse so to do? 
I believe that we are too apt to 
apply these so-called rules of liberty 
and of freedom in a one-sided way. 
There are men who say that they 
have the right to smoke tobacco' if 
they want to, and in this State if 
they be of age they have that right 
legally and I know they exercise it 
(laughter), but I long to see the 
day when I shall have some rights 
too in that matter, and when I shall 
not be forced to breathe the foul 
emanations that come from smok- 
ers' mouths. 1 hope to see the day 
when women will no longer be 
offended as they board or leave 
street cars or as they pass along 
the streets, by having clouds of to- 
bacco smoke blown into their faces. 
I believe we shall improve in the 
matter of liberty and come to see 
that there are rights that others 
have as well as rights that we claim 
for ourselves. The spirit of the 
Gospel safeguards the right of no 
man to the injury of another, but 
provides for the liberties of all ; and 
I hope that I will never become so 
lifted up in egotism that I shall feel 
that I am the people and that I 
know it all. I hope that I shall 
ever be led to seek for those to 
whom I feel I can look with con- 
fidence for advice, for counsel, for 
guidance, and if I choose to follow 
the counsel and advice of those in 
whom I have respect, T claim that 
I have the right so to do as a citizen 
and a free man. 

I trust that the spirit of charity 



will manifest itself in our souls and 
that we will be willing to allow unto 
others those privileges and rights 
that we ask for ourselves ; that we 
may in very truth be worthy of the 
measure of liberty which belongs to 
the Church of Jesus Christ, for if 
it be what it professes to be, the 
repository of truth, there must be 
in it the elements of true liberty and 
not that false freedom of the spuri- 
ous kind which is being put forth in 
an unceasing stream from the 
devil's factories. We have to scru- 
tinize very carefully the goods that 
are offered in the markets today 
lest we be deceived. I rejoice in 
the fact that this people stand for 
the Constitution of the nation and 
I call to mind that the declaration 
of the people to that effect was 
made in a very early day and was 
reiterated at a very critical time. It 
was just when the Overland Tele- 
graph wire from the east was ap- 
proaching the end of the wire that 
was coming from the west, for you 
know it was within the boundaries 
of this state that those two ends 
were joined and the nerve of steel 
that connected the east with the 
west was made complete. It was 
just at that time that the great un- 
pleasantness was at its height be- 
tween the North and the South, 
when brother was rising against 
brother, and it was rumored that 
Utah had seceded from the Union, 
or, as represented by some, Utah 
was to become a separate and in- 
dependent government, the seat of 
a separate power, and that in addi- 
tion to a North and a South, which 
had already been declared, there 
was to be a West also. You know 
the first message that was sent 
through that metallic nerve, went 
from the West to Washington, from 
Brigham Young to the President of

129 



the United States and this was the 
purport of the message, "Utah has 
not seceded but is firm for the Con- 
stitution and laws of our country." 
That declaration has never been 
changed ; it is as true in its applica- 
tion today as it was when it was 
flashed as the initial message across 
the overland telegraph wire. We 
stand for the Constitution and do 
not believe in any false notions of 
advancement and enlightenment 
and progressivism such as seeks to 
undermine that foundation of our 
liberties, for as a document we 
know that it was inspired and we 
believe that the men who framed it 
were raised up, as truly as was ever 
prophet raised up in Israel in an- 
cient or modern times, to frame that 
instrument and thereby provide for 
the fulfilment of prophetic utter- 
ances regarding the freedom and 
the liberty that should prevail in 
this choice land. I am pleased to 
add my testimony to the many to 
which you have listened. The tes- 
timony which I bear to you is one 
of knowledge and assurance beyond 
doubt, that God has spoken in this, 
the dispensation of the fulness of 
times, and does speak today as of 
old through His servants, the 
prophets ; that in very truth Christ 
the Redeemer of mankind lives and 
that His coming is near at hand. 
The cry is given today as in the wil- 
derness of old, "The kingdom of 
heaven is at hand, therefore re- 
pent." May the spirit of earnest- 
ness, devotion, integrity, freedom, 
liberty ever prevail among the Lat- 
ter-day Saints, and throughout the 
length and breadth of the land oc- 
cupied by this great nation, the na- 
tion of promise, I ask in the name 
of Jesus Christ. Amen.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



I desire to thank the good breth- 
ren and sisters who have attended 
this conference, and if the time 
would permit, without interfering 
too much with your desire to return 
to your homes, I would like to make 
a simple suggestion or two to our 
Relief Societies, to our Young 
Women's Mutual Improvement As- 
sociations, Primary Associations, 
and our Sunday School, and Re- 
ligion Class teachers, the presidents 
of stakes and their counselors, and 
the high counselors throughout 
Zion, and the bishops and coun- 
selors, and ward teachers through- 
out the Church, that they set their 
faces like flint against every spirit 
of apostasy, every kind of evil, in- 
temperance, the violation of the 
Sabbath day ; and hold in reverence 
that which is sacred in the eyes of 
the Lord, and should be held sacred 
by all Latter-day Saints ; to hold 
sacred also all and every divine and 
human right ; to do unto all men as 
we would that they should do unto 
us, and set an example, as members 
of the Church that will be worthy 
of emulation by all men and women 
in the world. I want to say to our 
Relief Societies, our Young Ladies' 
Mutual Improvement Associations 
and' our Primary Associations that 
I desire and sincerely hope they will 
set their faces like flint against 
every immoral thing, including the 
prevailing habit of card-playing, of 
unbecoming fashions in dressing, of 
indecent exposure of the human 
form divine to the lecherous gaze of 
men ; that they clothe themselves in 
decency, both in public and in pri- 
vate, and that they keep sacred 
those things which have been con- 
ferred upon them in holy places. I 
ask this, and I would suggest to our 
Relief Societies, Young Ladies' 
Improvement Associations, and Pri- 



mary Associations, that when you 
find members of your boards in- 
dulging in things which are not 
right, call them to order, admonish 
them ; be gentle and kind, of course, 
and forbearing and patient ; but un- 
less they will conform to the rules 
of these associations to give out a 
moral and wholesome influence to 
the young people of Israel, let them 
be dropped and others who will be 
more exemplary chosen and put in 
their places. I expect that my sis- 
ters will listen to this counsel, for 
it is not mine; it is the counsel of 
the spirit and letter of the word of 
God as we have it in the divine 
records ; it is God's will, and those 
who are entrusted with these im- 
porant duties in the Church should 
be vigilant in guarding the welfare, 
the happiness, and good name and 
character of the daughters of Zion. 
I want presidents of stakes and their 
counselors to so live their religion 
that they can say, consistently, to 
the people of their stakes, "Come 
and follow me." I desire that the 
bishops in all the wards will set an 
example before their people that 
they will feel proud to emulate ; and 
that when a man having authority 
in the Church stands up to teach his 
people that the people will know, 
"He practises what he preaches ; 
and, therefore, his example and pre- 
cepts are in force." We would like 
this: and we hope that vou will 
honor the Sabbath day and keep it 
holv, that vou will reverence the 
authority of the Priesthood, and 
magnify it by good works ; that you 
will observe the covenants you have 
entered into in sacred places and 
keep them inviolate ; that you will 
be Latter-day Saints in verv deed : 
that you mav be indeed the light of 
the world, that is not and cannot 
be hidden under a bushel, nor in

some dark corner, and the salt of 
the earth. We are coming out in 
full sight of the world. The eye of 
God, and the eye of man, is upon 
this people. We cannot hide our- 
selves from them. It behooves us 
to speak right, to think right, to do 
right, and to work righteousness in 
every capacity in which we are 
called to act, in private and in pub- 
lic, that it may be said of us, "They 
are worthy of their standing and 
name, as members of the Church 
of Jesus Christ bf Latter-day 
Saints, the highest honor that can 
be given to man. 

We regret exceedingly that our 
beloved brother, George F. Rich- 
ards, is prostrate on a bed of sick- 
ness, and has not, therefore, been 
able to attend this conference. We 
invoke the faith and prayers of the 
Saints in his behalf, that he may 
speedily recover and resume his 
duties as an apostle of Jesus Christ. 

I will try not to take any more of 
your time than I can not help. I 
would like to mention the names, 
here, of some of our missionaries 
who have fallen in the mission field 
within the last six months, or since 
January 1, 1912 : 

Elder Mons P. Larson, of Spring 
City, died in the New Zealand mis- 
sion, April 26, 1912, of typhoid 
fever ; 

John Leonard Hill, of Mapleton, 
Utah, killed by a train, at Dickson, 
West Virginia, January 8, 1912; 

Nephi Robert Olsen, of Lovell, 
Wyoming, died in the Swedish mis- 
sion, February 13, 1912; 

George O. Blake, of the twenty- 
second ward, this city, died at Ham- 
burg, Germany, April 18, 1912, of 
typhoid fever ; 

Joseph W. Maynes, of Waterloo 
ward, this city, died in the British 



mission, June 16, 1912, of heart 
failure ; 

Thomas J. Cove, of Thatcher, 
Arizona, drowned in Buchannan, 
Georgia, Southern States Mission, 
July 4th, this year ; 

Royal P. Oldham, of Paradise, 
Utah, drowned, at Charleston, West 
Virginia, October 2d, this month. 

I am sorry to say it, but if these 
two boys, recently drowned, had 
kept away from those rivers, where 
they had no special duty, or calling, 
they would not have been drowned 
as they were. I would like it to be 
understood by the presidents of 
missions, and by the elders, that are 
out in the world, that it is not a 
good thing, neither is it at all wise 
for our elders to go out on excur- 
sions, on dangerous lakes, or 
streams, or bodies of water, just 
for fun. They had better keep away. 
The Lord will protect them in the 
discharge of their duty ; and if they 
are more careful of their health, 
there will not be so many of them 
become a prey to disease. We know 
of some of the incidents that were 
the cause of the death of some of 
our brethren who have passed away 
in the mission field. They lacked 
caution. They did not exercise the 
best wisdom and judgment. They 
went too far for their strength, and 
were not as careful of themselves 
as they ought to have been. I do 
not speak this to blame these breth- 
ren. I have not the least doubt but 
they have done according to the 
best wisdom they possessed ; but 
there is such a thing as overdoing. 
A man may fast and pray till he 
kills himself; and there isn't any 
necessity for it ; nor wisdom in it. I 
say to my brethren, when they are 
fasting, and praying for the sick, 
and for those that need faith and 



134 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



prayer, do not go beyond what is 
wise and prudent in fasting and 
prayer. The Lord can hear a sim- 
ple prayer, offered in faith, in half 
a dozen words, and he will recog- 
nize fasting that may not continue 
more than twenty-four hours, just 
as readily and as effectually as He 
will answer a prayer of a thousand 
words and fasting for a month. 
Now, remember it. I have in mind 
elders now on missions, anxious to 
excel their associates, each wants 
to get the most "red marks" of 
credit, and so he will exert himself 
beyond his strength ; and it is un- 
wise to do it. The Lord will accept 
that which is enough, with a good 
deal more pleasure and satisfaction 
than that which is too much and un- 
necessary. It is good to be earnest, 
good to be diligent, to persevere, 
and to be faithful all the time, but 
we may go to extremes in these 
things ; when we do not need to. 
The Word of Wisdom dictates that 
when we become weary we should 
stop and rest. When we are threat- 
ened with exhaustion, through over- 
exertion, wisdom would caution us 
to wait, to stop ; not to take a stim- 
ulant to urge us on to greater ex- 
tremes, go where we can retire and 
rest and recuperate according to the 
laws of nature. That is the best 
way to do. 

Now. I do not blame my dear 
brethren who have met with death 
abroad ; yet, I wish that they could 
and would escape it. 

( Notice respecting German meet- 
ing read by the President, after 
which he spoke as follows : ) 

I sincerely hope and pray that my 
German brethren and sisters' will 
maintain the spirit of the Gospel of 
Jesus Christ, in humility, and faith, 
that it will help them to keep in 
good standing before the Lord, 



despite the efforts of some of their 
brethren to mislead them from the 
truth. 

I thank God for our conference, 
for the good words that have been 
spoken, and for the honor that has 
been shown the cause of truth and 
the presiding authorities of the 
Church, on the part of the people 
who have attended ; the good spirit 
that has pervaded our meetings, the 
joy that we have felt in looking 
upon your faces, and the pleasure 
that I trust you have also felt in 
being present during the confer- 
ence. God bless this people and all 
the good of the earth, and overrule 
all the acts of men to praise Him 
and to ultimately bring to pass glo- 
rious results and His righteous will, 
is my prayer, in the name of Jesus. 
Amen. 

An anthem, "The nations bow to 
Satan's thrall," words by John 
Nicholson and music by Joseph J. 
Daynes, was sung by Mrs. Delia 
Daynes Hills and the choir. 

Benediction was pronounced by 
Presiding Bishop Charles W. 
Nibley. 

Conference adjourned for six 
months. 

Prof. Evan Stephens conducted 
the singing of the choir and congre- 
gation at the Conference meetings 
in the Tabernacle, and Prof. John 
J. McClellan played the accompani- 
ments, interludes, etc., on the great 
organ, assisted by Edward P. Kim- 
ball and Tracy Y. Cannon. 

The stenographic reports of the 
discourses were taken by Elders 
Franklin W. Otterstrom, Frederick 
E. Barker, and Fred G. Barker.

PREFACE. 



T N compliance with a widely expressed wish, we herewith publish the pro- 
ceedings of the late Conference in pamphlet form. It is believed that in 
this shape the excellent and inspiring instructions imparted during the Con- 
ference will be made much more available for general reference and distri- 
bution, and will be appreciated by those who desire to preserve the ser- 
vices of the Jubilee Conference. 



TWO DAYS' MEETINGS 

IN THE 

SALT LAKE ASSEMBLY HALL. 



IN accordance with previous announcements, meetings were held in the 
Assembly Hall on Sunday and Monday, April 4th and 5th, preparatory to 
the General Conference to be convened in the Large Tabernacle. At an early 
hour the Saints began to assemble, and by 10 o'clock a. m., the time for open- 
ing the services, the new and elegant building was filled, and soon after was 
crowded in every part. 

The congregation was called to order by President John Taylor, and 
after singing by the Tabernacle choir, prayer was offered by Elder Moses 
Thatcher. 

PRESIDENT JOHN TAYLOE. 

I am happy to have the privilege of meeting with the Saints in this new 
hall. It is not quite finished, but yet it is so far comfortable that we can have 
an opportunity of meeting and conferring together. When the building is fully 
completed — the organ and everything in its proper place — we shall then have 
it dedicated, as is our custom, to the Lord our God, for the purpose of meet- 
ing here and attending to whatever may be required. 

As the 6th of April falls on next Tuesday, we thought it better to have a 
two days' meeting before hand, that we might have an opportmnity of listening 
to the principles that will be presented by our brethren, the Twelve and others, 
and we are in hopes that on the 6th day of April we shall be able to meet in 
the large Tabernacle, which will accommodate all who may desire to attend. 

And while we are assembled together in the capacity 01 a Conference, it 
is proper that our hearts and feelings and affections should be turned to God, 
that we may reflect upon his kindness, his mercy and salvation extended to us 
as a people; that we may also reflect upon our weaknesses, our infirmities, 
our follies and our foibles, and be enabled to lay them aside, feeling that we 
are the Saints of God, with responsibilities to attend to; and that it is our 
duty and our delight to listen to and be governed by those great principles 
which God has revealed for the salvation of the human family.

TWO days' meetings. 



On the 6th day of April the church will have been organized fifty years, 
and we might with very good propriety call it a year of jubilee, or rather the 
close of the year of jubilee. And while we are assembled together, either in 
our meeting prior to the Conference or afterwards in the Conference, it be- 
comes us, when we reflect upon the kindness and mercy which God has vouch- 
safed to us during the last fifty years, to renew our covenants before him, and 
feel in our hearts that we are his people and that he is our God. His mercy 
and salvation will still be extended to us, if we will only obey his laws, keep 
his commandments, and pursue that course that is proper and acceptable in 
his sight. 

I do not wish to make many remarks this morning. I thought I would just 
rise and introduce some of those principles that naturally tend to bring our 
minds to reflection. 

On the fiftieth year, in former times, among the ancients, they had what 
was termed a year of jubilee. Slaves were liberated. People who were in 
debt were forgiven their indebtedness— that is, the poor, the needy and the dis- 
tressed. And we are reflecting upon some things pertaining to that matter, 
which will be presented in due form ; and we wish to start, as it were, and feel 
to determine in our hearts that the Lord is our God, the Lord is our Judge, the 
Lord is our Law-giver, and he shall rule over us ; and we will try and be his 
people and observe his laws. And I would ask my brethren and sisters to give 
us an interest in their faith and prayers, that we shall be enabled to advance 
such principles as will be calculated to enlighten, to quicken, to refresh and to 
strengthen us, that we may pursue in after years, with more vigor and deter- 
mination, that path which God has revealed unto us. Amen. 

ELDER WILFOKD WOODRUFF. 

President, brethren and sisters: God bless you, (Amen), and may the 
peace of God abide with you, and the Spirit of God within these walls, 
and may it rest upon the Apostles, Elders and Saints while we assemble 
together to worship God. I feel in my heart to praise the Lord for his mer- 
cies and blessings over the Apostles and Elders and Saints and church and 
kingdom of God to the present hour. I see before me here the symbols of 
the history of this church and kingdom, and some of us have been pre- 
served by the hand of God to pass through its travels, its progress and its 
history almost from the beginning until the present day; and while I listened 
to the remarks of Brother Taylor, I reflected in my own mind upon the day 
and age and time of our history. Fifty years have passed and gone, or 
nearly so, since the organization of this church and kingdom on the earth. 
Whatever the feelings of the world may be with regard to the Latter-day 
Saints, with regard to their lives, their history, their organization, their per- 
secutions, and their drivings until the present day, whether they believe or 
disbelieve, it matters not to the purposes of God, who stands at the head, 
even our Heavenly Father. This is the church and kingdom of God; it is 
the church of Christ; it is the organization of the kingdom of God, that has 
been spoken of by all the prophets since the world began; it is the Zion of 
God that Isaiah and Jeremiah and many of the other prophets saw by vision 
and revelation in their day and generation. In my own mind I cannot conceive

of any fifty years since the creation of this world, in its history before the 
heavens, before the Gods, before the angels, and before the world, of more 
importance or consequence than the last fifty years through which we have 
passed ; and if the vail could only be lifted from our eyes, so that we could see 
and comprehend our destiny, our position, our responsibilities, and what is 
required at our hands by the God of Israel, we should all of us feel the impor- 
tance of improving our time, magnifying our calling, striving to live by every 
word that proceedeth forth from the mouth of God. 

I hold in my hand our testament. The testator is dead, has been dead for 
a great many years. He sealed his testimony with his blood. That testament 
is in force, has been in force upon all the world from the day of his death ; and 
not only from that day, but from the time these revelations were given to the 
inhabitants of the earth. That testament contains a volume of the most im- 
portant revelations God ever gave to man. Fifty years ago, or nearly so, when 
He gave some of these revelations, the Lord said to Joseph Smith, " If you 
believe my words you will go and prune my vineyard while the day lasts; If 
you believe these revelations I have given you, you will take hold and build up 
this kingdom." When I reflect that it is fifty years since these revelations 
were given, I ask myself the question — What condition are we in to-day as a 
people, as Latter-day Saints? What is our condition, our position to-day 
before the Lord? What is the condition of the world? What is the condition 
of Great Babylon? What is the condition of the Saints, the Elders of Israel, 
and the Lord's anointed, and the people whom he has chosen and called upon 
and raised up to take hold and build up Zion, build up the kingdom, sanctify 
themselves before God and prepare themselves for the coming of the Son of 
man? I have sometimes feared in my own mind concerning ourselves, that we 
are not living as near to the Lord as we ought to do ; we do not always com- 
prehend the responsibilities which we are under to God our Heavenly Father. 
When I reflect, my brethren and sisters, that the Lord has ordained the estab- 
lishment of Zion, upon the responsibility that rests upon us in warning the gen- 
eration in which we live that they may be left without excuse in fulfilment of 
the revelations contained in this volume (the Book of Mormon) — when I reflect 
that we are called as the servants of the Lord to perform this work, I feel 
within my own mind as the Lord has said now nearly fifty years ago, that if we 
believe the words of the Lord we will labor while it is called to-day. The 
Lord looks to nobody else, he expects nothing from anybody else, as far as the 
fulfilling of the revelations in the Bible, Book of Mormon, Doctrine and Cove- 
nants are concerned ; he looks to no other nation, kindred, tongue, or people 
henceforth to go and perform this work, but the Saints of the living God. If 
the Lord has any friends on the earth they are the Saints of God, and if the 
Saints of God have any friends anywhere, they consist of the God of Israel 
and the heavenly hosts, and the spirits of just men made perfect. 

In my view, we as Latter-day Saints are approaching a change. We are 
approaching important events. It cannot be otherwise in the face of the reve- 
lations of God, in the Bible, in the Testament, in the Doctrine and Covenants, 
than that a change is about to take place in the world. The Lord has said that 
he would make the work short in the latter days, that he would cut it short in 
righteousness. Fifty years is a good while to pass away in the dispensation

and generation in which we live, and it has taken from the earth during this 
time a great many, I will say all of the founders of this church and kingdom. 
It has taken into the spirit world many of the Apostles, many of the Elders, 
many thousands of the Latter-day Saints, and sometimes when I look around 
and contemplate on the past, I at times feel lonesome. I look back to the 
days of Joseph Smith, Hyrum Smith, and to the' patriarchs, prophets and 
apostles that lived in that day, and I find that a great share of them are in the 
spirit world. There are but very few left now who were alive at the organiza- 
tion of this church upon the earth. I believe that Brother Orson Pratt is the 
only man who dwells in the flesh, who is in the church, who was organized in 
the first Quorum of the Twelve. Brother Taylor and myself remain of those 
who were organized in the second organization. But Brother Taylor and my- 
self and Brother Pratt and a good many others will not tarry a great while 
here. We shall pass on to the other side of the vail, and join those who have 
gone before, as will many who are in this congregation. This is not our home, 
but we will dwell in the flesh until we pass through a change. We are apt 
sometimes in our reflections to marvel and wonder why the Lord has taken 
away so many men who have been called as Apostles and prophets and Elders 
of the Zion of God into the spirit world. The Lord has had his motive in 
these things. I see (pointing to the paintings on the ceiling) Joseph Smith 
with Moroni, and here, with Peter, James and John, receiving the priest- 
hood. How long did he (Joseph) tarry here in the flesh? Only fourteen 
years after he organized this church and kingdom, the church and kingdom 
of God, the church of Jesus Christ. We felt as though we could not live, 
could not exist, without Joseph. We felt a good deal as the Apostles did 
when Jesus told his disciples that if he did not go away the Comforter would 
not come. They did not comprehend him; they did not understand that 
Jesus Christ was to be crucified, notwithstanding that he told them that if he 
did not go away the Comforter would not come. Joseph Smith remained 
with us longer than the Savior did. He remained only about three and a 
half years after he was thirty years of age, an age which the Jewish law re- 
quired a man to attain before officiating in the priesthood. Joseph Smith 
remained with us about fourteen years. He remained until he had received all 
the keys of the kingdom of God which were necessary for the establishment 
of this church and kingdom, and which were necessary for those men who fol- 
lowed him to have those keys upon their shoulders, that they might continue to 
build upon the foundation that had been laid; but as soon as. Joseph received 
the keys of the Aaronic and Melchizedek priesthood, as soon as he received 
the keys from Moses for the gathering together of the House of Israel in the 
latter days, and from Elijah to seal the hearts of the fathers to the children and 
children to the fathers— when Joseph received all these keys, and had power 
to seal them upon the heads of other men, the Lord called him away. Why 
did he call him into the spirit world? Because he held the keys of this dis- 
pensation, not only before he came to this world and while he was in the flesh, 
but he would hold them throughout the endless ages of eternity. He held the 
keys of past generations— of the millions of people who dwelt on the earth in 
the fifty generations that had passed and gone who had not the law of the gos- 
pel, who never saw a prophet, never saw an Apostle, never heard the voice of

any man who was inspired of God and had power to teach them the gospel of 
Christ, and to organize the church of Christ on earth. He went to unlock the 
prison doors to these people, as far as they would receive his testimony, and 
the Saints of God who dwell in the flesh will build temples unto the name of 
the Lord, and enter these temples and perform certain ordinances for the 
redemption of the dead. This was the work of Joseph the prophet in the 
spirit world. Now, I believe in my own mind that every Elder of Israel who 
has gone into the spirit world, who has been faithful in the flesh, has as much 
to do on the other side of the vail as we have to do here, and if anything more 
so. This is my view with regard to tHfe labors of the Elders of Israel. The 
Lord hath need of some on the other side of the vail. He preserves some to 
labor here, and he takes home whom he will according to the counsels of his 
own will; this is his manner of dealing. Those of our brethren who have 
passed away have got through the labors of the flesh ; we are left here to labor 
a little while on the earth. Then I would like to ask my brethren and sisters 
this morning in view of these things, if these things are true, if this is the 
church of Christ, if this is the Zion of God — which the Lord Almighty foreor- 
dained before the world was should be established in the latter days, and had 
a class of men and women whom he had reserved in the spirit world, whose 
lives were hid with Christ in God and knew it not, to come forth and stand in 
the flesh and take hold of this kingdom and build it up, and war with the 
world, the flesh and the devil — then, if this be true, what manner of men and 
women ought we to be? I feel in my reflections, in my thoughts and in my 
meditations, that we, as Elders of Israel, should have nothing else to do in 
this world while we dwell in the flesh but to build up this kingdom, and when 
we are building up this kingdom we are building up ourselves; when we are 
faithful to God we are magnifying our calling. 

The eyes of the heavenly hosts are over us; the eyes of God himself and 
his Son Jesus Christ; the eyes of all the prophets and Apostles who have 
dwelt in the flesh; they are watching our works. I have spent more time 
lately with those who are in the spirit world, in my night seasons, than in all 
the rest of my life together. On one occasion I thought in my dream that 
Presidents Young, Kimball, George A. Smi-th, and many others, attended one 
of our Conferences. When Brother Young was asked to preach he said: " No, 
I have done my preaching, I have done my instructions in the flesh; I have 
come to hear you talk, I have come to look at you, I have come to watch over 
you, I wish to see what this people are doing." This has been the answer 
and these are thoughts I believe in. I believe we are not shut out from God, 
we are not shut out from our brethren, though the vail is between us. They 
understand our works, our condition, our position, and I feel a desire myself, 
what little time I have to spend in the flesh, to make my time useful. I wish 
to do what I can for the building up of the kingdom of God. I wish to do 
what I can to bring to pass righteousness, and I feel that we should all be in 
this position; we should all labor to occupy our time, our talents, and our at- 
tention as far as we possibly can to build up the kingdom of God. 

I wish to say to the Latter-day Saints. Sometimes people apostatize; we 
speak of people getting into the dark. It does not make any difference who 
sells whiskey, nor who drinks it; it makes no difference who blasphemes the

name of God, or apostatizes from the church and kingdom of God, as far as 
the establishment of the kingdom of God is concerned ; the Lord has got val- 
iant men and women in his kingdom who will be true and faithful to the Lord 
and his work. If half of this church were to fall away, it would not destroy 
the purposes of the Lord. With regard to ourselves that is another thing. 
Many men who have received the gospel, and have had the Holy Ghost con- 
ferred upon them, have fallen away, but in doing so they condemn themselves, 
they destroy themselves, they miss and lose all the hopes they ever had of 
eternal life and the blessings of God in the celestial kingdom. Men may fall, 
but the kingdom of God never, never. The Lord has a good many men and 
women in this church and kingdom that cannot afford to surrender any princi- 
ple that the God of Israel has commanded us to obey, no principle that the 
Lord has commanded us to receive, no principle that is embodied in the gospel 
of Jesus Christ. Why? Because we know and understand very well that our 
destiny, our position, and our-blessings are all in his hands. We also know 
that the destinies of all the armies of the nations of the earth under the whole 
heavens are in the hands of God. The Lord guides these things; he will 
guide them. We are approaching an important day and time. We are ap- 
proaching a period when there must be a change in Babylon, a change in our 
nation, and a change in Zion. Judgments are going to begin at the house 
of God. They will go forth, and will not be taken from the earth until all has 
been fulfilled. 

My brethren and sisters, I wished to say this much this morning. I 
desired to exhort you, and I exhort myself. Let us watch and be sober. Let 
us keep the commandments of God. Let us labor for the Holy Spirit, for 
without this no man can serve God. What condition is the world in? To-day 
the world is a great way from the Lord, and they are getting a great way fur- 
ther off year by year, and just so far as they get from the Lord in this world, 
just so far off will they be in the world to come. Bear this in mind. 

I do think that as Elders in Israel we have no reason to be discouraged. 
God is with us. God is with this people. He is watching over our interests. 
He guides and directs our destiny, and you may look back and scan the history 
of this church and kingdom from the days of its organization, and you will 
find it has never gone backward, it has gone forward all the way through, year 
by year, no matter the difficulties thrown in our way. We have had persecu- 
tion and oppression ; we were driven from one place to another for many years, 
until we were driven into these Rocky Mountains, to the land given to Jacob 
and his posterity, the land preserved for the gathering of the Saints in the lat- 
ter days. When I look at this assembly and contemplate the work of this 
people in these valleys and in the surrounding Territories; when I perceive 
how this desert is occupied, how the Latter-day Saints are progressing, how 
they are cultivating the earth, building temples, halls, tabernacles, school- 
houses, towns and villages, I marvel at the work of the Lord. This is the 
work of the Almighty, and when our enemies look for the stoppage of this 
work, for the stoppage of the progress of the Latter-day Saints, they will be 
disappointed, because these things are in the hands of the Lord, and no power 
can hinder their progress. 

I rejoice in having the privilege of meeting with an assemblv of the Saints

if 



of God in Salt Lake City, and especially in such a good building as this. It 
is a credit to the Latter-day Saints. It is an ornament to this Temple Block, 
and an honor to those who have helped lo build it. We must continue these 
things. We must go forward, not backward. We have this fine temple 
which we are building at the present time, and there are others being 
erected in other parts of the Territory, that the Latter-day Saints may enter 
these temples of our God and attend to the ordinances for the redemption 
of the living and the dead. I bear testimony to you, my brethren and sis- 
ters, the whole spirit world is watching your labor and your works, and as I 
said in the beginning, if the vail was taken from off our eyes, we would see 
the responsibility of our acts, and what would be the result of these things? 
We would labor diligently and do all we could for the rearing of these temples 
for the redemption of our dead ; we would sanctify ourselves and keep the 
Word of Wisdom, and unite ourselves together according to the law of God. 
There are many things we do as Latter-day Saints that we should abstain 
from; we should see the importance of our laboring in the flesh to build up the 
Zion of God. 

I have spent the last year of my life on a mission. I have been traveling 
with our southern brethren ; spent some time in the temple ; been through 
Arizona, where the brethren and sisters are living in the United Order. I will 
say that I have been pleased with my visit to the southern country. In many 
of our settlements the people are endeavoring to keep the commandments of 
God, uniting together according to the order of the kingdom of God; and I 
will say here that from my experience among them I am pleased with the re- 
sult, I am pleased with the fruits manifested by the people, and you know we 
judge a tree by the fruit it bears. I made my home in Sunset when I was 
not traveling. The people there are living in the United Order, as also in 
Brigham City and St. Joseph, and while I was in those settlements I never 
heard an oath, I never saw a quarrel, I never saw any man or boy smoke a 
cigarette, or use an ounce of tobacco, or drink whiskey, or drink a cup of 
coffee or tea, except what I drank myself. The idea of drinking coffee where 
nobody else was drinking it was a very poor example, I thought, for an Apos- 
tle; I therefore took, instead of coffee, water and milk, and have felt a great 
deal better. The promise is that those who keep the Word of Wisdom " shall 
run and not be weary, shall walk and not faint," and I can say I have enjoyed 
much better health than before. Another thing I wish to mention. Among 
this people, if you go to the herd-grounds, to the shepherds, those who herd 
the sheep and cattle, you never see any man with a pack of cards. Every 
man prays morning and night at least, and you will always find a book of Doc- 
trine and Covenants, Spencer's Letters, Voice of Warning, or other good 
books. I speak of these things because they are manifestations of good fruit. 
God has blessed the people ; they are living together in peace and unity, and 
there are many others who are bleesed of the Lord in that land who are not 
altogether carrying out these principles. But I do think the Lord requires of 
us to unite together. I think it is our duty to co-operate together and help 
bring about temperance, holiness and righteousness. 

I spent a good deal of my time last season in visiting our Lamanite breth- 
ren, the American Indians, and I will here remark that while in Apache

TWO days' meetings. 



County I learned it was reported that the Mormons were accused of having 
supplied arms to the Utes who have been at war with the whites, and that we 
urged them on to fight. A greater libel than this was never pepetrated. The 
Latter-day Saints have done more to bring the American Indians to peace 
than all the efforts of the United States put together. Until the Elders of Is- 
rael went among the Indians no man's life was safe, no matter who he was ; 
but since we have been amongst them they are the friends of the white man ; 
they are peaceable ; many of them have turned their hearts to the cultivation 
of the earth, and to-day many tribes of them will not steal the cattle and the 
horses of the white men. We have become acquainted with many of the 
tribes in that part of the country. We have had many opportunities of becom- 
ing acquainted with both the Navajoes and Apaches, who have been wander- 
ing, warlike tribes, and no white man's life or scalp was safe with them until 
the "Mormon" Elders went among them and taught them the gospel and peace 
and the benefits of cultivating the earth. Now any white man can- go among 
them in safety, if he will behave himself, attend to his own business, and not 
interfere with the families of the Indians. This will apply to the Navajoes 
and Apaches, with the exception of a remnant of Apaches who are not under 
the control of Petrone and Pedro, the war and peace chiefs. This remnant, 
under Vutone, is still on the war path. The Navajoes return to the whites 
any strayed or stolen horses or cattle. The Navajoes visit the " Mormon " 
settlements in peace, where they are fed and treated kindly, taught to cultivate 
the earth, and instructed in the principles of peace and to prevent war. 

We have visited the Oribas, Moquis, Zunis, Lagoonis, and Islatas. All live 
in villages, the houses of which are made of stone, laid in mortar, and are 
from one to four stories high, with fiat roofs. They and their forefathers have 
occupied these villages for generations. They are all peaceable Indians, and 
all wish to avoid war. The Oribas and Moquis occupy seven villages, built 
upon the top of solid, barren rocks, from 500 to 1 500 feet nearly perpendicular, 
with no soil upon the rocks. The last three villages we visited stand upon a 
barren rock, one mile long, 100 yards wide at the top, and about 1500 feet high. 
The three villages stand upon the south end of the rock, from 200 to 300 yards 
apart, and number about 1500 people. Were it not for a sink in the rock of 
about 200 feet, with a steep serpentine trail and stone steps, no mortal being 
could reach those villages, only in a balloon. The natives have no tradition 
who built the villages, but they have been occupied for centuries, and were lo- 
cated in their romantic situation evidently for the purpose of protection from 
the Navajoes, the traditional enemies of the Moquis, and also from other ene- 
mies, who would rob them of their horses, asses, sheep and goats whenever 
an opportunity presented itself, until the " Mormons " made peace between 
the contending parties, and now they are on friendly terms. The Moquis have 
a thousand or more acres of corn, beans, melons, squashes, and peach or- 
chards planted in the sand on the earth below them, where they raise good 
corn, from pure white to jet black, without irrigation. The black corn is the 
best. Every pound of water, wood and corn, and everything they subsist upon, 
has to be carried up the steep trail and stone steps some 1500 feet, on the backs 
of men, women and asses, as it is too steep for mules and horses. There is a 
projection on the east side of the mountain, 100 feet from the top, about 100

yards in length and twelve feet wide. By a trail in the side of the mountain 
the projection is reached, and every night it is filled with thousands of sheep 
and goats, which are kept in by a frail stone wall about two feet high. Should 
an animal jump over, it would not touch ground for about 1200 feet, which 
would abridge its usefulness for either wool or mutton. 

The names of these three villages are — first, Hano; second, Cheehomova; 
third, Walpe. The last named stands on the south end of the rock, and 
has about 1000 people. Their workshops stand flush with the outer edge 
of the precipice. Their dwellings stand from ten to twenty feet back from the 
edge, with nothing to keep men, women or children from falling off, either by 
day or night. Five Navajoes were thrust off this precipice, several years ago, 
in a quarrel, and never struck ground for about 1500 feet. One Moquis chief 
and several children have fallen off at the same place, and the only wonder is 
that half of the people of the village have not been killed in the same way. 
In my visit to these villages I was accompanied by Elders Lot Smith and Ira 
Hatch. 

The villages eastward are built upon slightly elevated pieces of ground, 
and are much better off than the Moquis. The Zunis, Lagoonis and Islatas, all 
have large cultivated fields. The Islatas are the most advanced in civilization 
and industry of any natives I ever visited. The village numbers 3000 inhabit- 
ants, and is located on the Rio del Norte, twelve miles below Albuquerque. 
When I visited the village the people thereof had large fields of corn, kept 
clear of weeds and well irrigated. They had also large apple, pear and peach 
orchards, besides twenty-one grape vineyards, with about 1000 vines in each, 
kept clean and loaded with fine fruit. Their houses were clean and neat and 
some of their floors were carpeted. Theii blood has been kept pure, they be- 
ing unmixed with other tribes, or with the Mexicans or any white men. The 
old patriarch, John King, the leading spirit of the place, said it was seldom a 
case of seduction or adultery had occurred among his people; and he said that 
death had always been the penalty for the crime. 

I saw one peculiar practice in Islata that I never saw in any civilized city. 
No man, woman, or child was permitted to sweep any dust or dirt from the 
floor to the sidewalk or into the street under penalty of a fine. All sweep- 
ings had to be gathered into baskets, or on blankets, at the threshold, and 
emptied upon one of the mounds located in different parts of the city. 

We occupied a house facing the public square. The largest mound in the 
city was near that location, and measured 140 yards in circumference and forty 
feet high, all gathered from sweepings of floors, probably for generations, as 
it did not appear that any had been carted away. 

It is expected that the railway will cross at Islata, there being the only 
rocky bed and shores for many miles up and down that river. 

The Islatas have their own laws, rules, regulations, courts, police, etc. 
They are a wealthy people, and stand at the he'ad of many of the surrounding 
villages. They have traditions among them concerning their past and future 
history, which they are looking for the fulfilment of. Their record gives a 
history of their final restoration to civilization, industry, prosperity and the 
gospel of Christ, and their deliverance from oppression and war. This must 
be the future destiny of a remnant of them, or the promises of their forefa-

thers must fall unfulfilled. Elders Ammon M. Tenney and Christopher- 
sen accompanied me on my visit to these villages. Brother Tenney, three 
years previous, had visited the inhabitants of these villages, and had formed 
an acquaintance with them and assisted in baptizing one hundred and fifteen 
of the Zunis. 

I feel to thank the Lord that I have lived to see this day and time ; that I 
have lived to see the Fiftieth Anniversary of the history of the church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints ; and brethren and sisters, whatever little time we 
have to spend let us spend it in laying aside iniquity, let us labor to build up 
the kingdom of God. Our position after death will depend upon the little 
time that we spend here in the flesh, and when I consider — when I can get 
enough of the Spirit of the Lord to guide my mind to comprehend the bless- 
ings of life and salvation — when I consider the great difference between being 
in the kingdom of God and out of it — I think it will pay any man or woman 
to keep the commandments of God. Blessed is that people whose God is the 
Lord. The Latter-day Saints profess to make our Heavenly Father their God. 

I do not wish to detain my brethren and sisters any longer this morning. I 
rejoice again to see you, and again to walk the streets of Salt Lake City. And 
I hope while we are together in this Conference the Spirit of God may be with 
us, that our hearts may be enlightened, our minds opened to comprehend our 
duties, and that we will be inspired to teach the Saints of God in the path of 
righteousness and truth, which is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 

ELDEE MOSES THATCHES. 

I have been very much edified with the remarks to which we have listened. 
I feel that we are a blessed people in being privileged to meet and worship God 
under so favorable circumstances ; and while listening to the remarks of my 
brethren it has been very apparent to my mind that God's kingdom is increas- 
ing, that the stakes of Zion are being extended and her cords lengthened. We 
are engaged in the work of God, our Heavenly Father. We are, as a people, 
in the enjoyment of privileges that are very great; indeed, we live in that day 
and age of the world to which the prophets anciently looked with joy and re- 
joicing. God's kingdom is being built up, never again to be thrown down nor 
given to another people. Whatever may be the reflections of the people of 
the world in regard to the Latter-day Saints, there is one fact that is apparent 
to them, and that is that we are growing, that we are increasing in numbers, 
that while our mission is " peace on earth and good will to men," the powers 
of God are being made manifest, and the principles of the Gospel are being 
preached to every nation, kindred, tongue and people. 

We have been seeking for years to extend this knowledge to the Lamanites, 
to the remnants of the House of Israel, to the fruit of the loins of Jacob 
through Joseph, but until recently it has been apparent to us that their hearts 
have not been opened to receive the testimony which is contained in the Book 
of Mormon. 

_ 1 have listened with much pleasure to the remarks of Elder Woodruff 
which we have heard this morning, in regard to the experience he has had in 
laboring among the people of Arizona and New Mexico, and it might be of

some interest to the Latter-day Saints to have a short sketch of my experience 
during the time I have been absent. I have visited the capital of the Republic 
of Mexico for the purpose of preaching the gospel to the people there. We 
were courteously received, kindly treated, had -the Spirit of God to be with 
us and the Lord to be our Friend; and notwithstanding the reports that have 
been circulated through the medium of the press, we feel that a good work, a 
great work, will be accomplished in the Republic of Mexico. More than one" 
half of the entire population are of the pure Indian stock, numbering, I be- 
lieve, a little in excess of five millions. They are different in many respects 
from the Indians who roam in these mountain regions, having at no time in 
their history, so far as we can trace it, been so steeped in ignorance, slothful- 
ness and destitution as have been the Indians in this country. At the time 
they were subjugated by the Spaniards under Cortez, commencing in the year 
1520, they were to some extent an enlightened race of people. They had a 
fair knowledge of the arts and sciences, and were particularly well versed in 
architecture; while their notation of time was quite equal to that of any nation 
then living. Their traditional history, as well as their written history, is very 
interesting, and had it not been for the disposition — doubtless through igno- 
rance — of the Catholic priests who followed up the conquest, we might have 
had knowledge that would now be valuable to the world. But as Cortez bore 
down heavily upon the thirty millions of people who then lived in what was 
called Mexico proper, so the priests who followed his camp bore heavily upon 
their works of art, and particularly in the destruction of their libraries, which 
were burned in great heaps, while the poor Indians gathered round, and, 
gazing upon the destruction of their treasures, wept like children. But there 
has been enough preserved to bring forth remarkable historical evidence in 
confirmation of the truths contained in the Book of Mormon. 

There are many interesting things connected with these historical works 
that I might mention if I had time to do so, but at present I will simply say 
that their history clearly portrays that they had a full knowledge of the crea- 
tion of the earth, of the garden of Eden, the deluge, the ark, the tower of 
Babel, the confusion of tongues, and their construction of eight boats in which 
to cross the great waters. They also had a knowledge of the birth, ministry 
and crucifixion of the Savior, and a person answering the description of the 
Son of Man was well known in their midst. He taught them the arts of peace, 
and all those higher elements of learning which the Aztecs were found in pos- 
session of at the time of the conquest. We find that preceding the conquest 
they were highly educated, highly instructed in the arts and in some of the 
sciences, and their forefathers had what was called a sacred book. An aged In- 
dian, when asked in reference to this sacred book by one of the early Catholic 
priests, replied that it contained to some extent the knowledge that they, the 
priests, sought to teach them; and when asked where that book was, the Indian 
replied that they had a tradition which had come down from generation to 
generation that it was buried in the earth. But I do not wish to take up time 
this morning upon these points, but desire to speak of the Indians as we find 
them now. They are the laborers of Mexico. Where there are railroads con- 
structed, they construct them. Where there are cities built, they build them. 
They are an industrious class of people, many of them being skillful artisans

and mechanics. They are docile, slow to resent an injury, but will remember 
an act of injustice for a long time. They are true to their promises, quite dif- 
ferent in this respect from many who claim a higher civilization. If you can 
secure their word and their friendship they will be true to you. It is very 
remarkable to notice in the general cast of their features the resemblance to 
the Jewish race, even more striking than we find it here among our Indians; 
and when crossed with the white or Spanish race, you would almost in every 
instance take them to be Jews. Thus, when I first arrived in the city of 
Mexico I observed to a gentleman, "You have a great many Jews here." 
" No," said he, " they are not Jews, they are Mexicans." They are a very 
polite people. The common Indian laborer on the street is as polite as almost 
any one you meet in this country. As to the educated class — such as con- 
gressmen, judges, and members of the Cabinet, you invariably find them well 
informed. Most of them have traveled extensively, and many of them speak 
German, French and English, as well as Spanish. The educated portion of 
the Mexicans are not ignorant with reference to the history of the Latter-day 
Saints. They have traced them up from the day of the organization of the 
church. They are familiar with our wanderings, our drivings, and our perse- 
cutions. They are also familiar with the indomitable courage which has been 
exhibited by the Latter-day Saints in redeeming this barren waste, and as a 
prominent Mexican gentleman expressed himself to me — " Why," said he, 
" you Mormon people have a poor country, and yet you seem to prosper, while 
we have a very rich country, but as a whole a very poor people." This I have 
no doubt is mainly attributable to the nature of the climate. For it has been 
observed that where God has done much for man, man does very little for 
himself. I believe this is the case to some extent in Mexico. The climate at 
the capital does not, it is said, vary more than io° the year round. Thus they 
have there what you might call perpetual spring. The result is that the people 
lack enterprise, and therefore it would be a delight to the leading men of 
Mexico if a population composed of the Anglo-Saxon race could be induced 
to locate themselves in that country, in order to develop its latent resources, 
because the undeveloped resources of Mexico are very great. The mines are 
not only numerous, but are rich. The land is also very productive, and is 
capable of growing anything you can name that can be produced in any other 
part of the world. We have no climate here to be compared with that of the 
Gulf Coasts of Mexico. I was down there on the 14th of December; the 
heat was certainly not comfortable; indeed, it was so intense that we felt we 
must at once change our clothing and assume lighter garments. But, on leav- 
ing the city of Vera Cruz about eleven o'clock in the evening, and in passing 
up to the tablelands, we found that in a few hours we required heavy over- 
coats in order to keep us comfortable. The valley of Mexico proper is 740c 
feet above the level of the sea. Thus you can see the altitude is much greater 
than ours. 

Referring to our missionary experience there, I will say, when the article 
appeared in the New York Sun stating that we had gone to Mexico to arrange 
with the Mexican Government officials for the purchase of land for the colo- 
nization of our people, of course it brought to us a great many inquiries, and 
while we had before desired that we might become acquainted with leading

men and government officials, we had not up to that date had the privilege of 
doing so. But after the publication of this article, Which was copied into the 
leading journals of the City of Mexico, we then had numerous callers, many 
having valuable tracts of land to sell, in which, as Colonel Sellers would say, 
"there's millions in it." Indeed, one man was anxious that we might secure 
twenty million acres ; another, that we might secure an entire State ; and they 
exhibited a good deal of anxiety that we might colonize in the Republic. But 
I told them we had no such mission, and that indeed if we had come to buy 
we had not yet seen sufficient of the country or people ; adding that our mis- 
sion was to preach, and to publish the word of the Lord to the people. Through 
the politeness of some of these gentlemen, we» became acquainted with many 
influential officials and men of eminence, whose courtesy and kindness we 
shall not soon forget. 

We found on inquiry that the Mexican Constitution was much the same 
as our own; in some respects a little more liberal. It guarantees freedom of 
the press, of speech, and full religious toleration. It recognizes churches as 
no portion of the governmental power; while all are free to preach in their 
houses of worship, they are not free to perform religious ceremonies in the 
open streets, highways, or market places. The act prohibiting any manifesta- 
tion of religious worship on the public highways and'streets was caused to be 
passed by the late President, Juarez — who was a pure-blooded Indian, there 
being not a drop of white blood in his veins. He was a great statesman and a 
thorough soldier. His name will pass down into history as being a great 
benefactor of his race and people. He was a liberal-minded man, whose 
heart beat for the highest human liberty. Being a foe to tyranny in every 
form, he traced the sufferings of Mexico very clearly, and comprehended that 
they were mainly traceable to the influence which the clergy exercised over the 
minds of the people. From this thraldom he labored with all his might to free 
his race, and sought to place them upon the solid basis of civil and religious 
liberty. Now the churches are entirely free to perform their ordinances within 
the walls of their buildings; but there was a time when, if a Catholic priest 
should happen to be moving along the street in his robes, the people were re- 
quired to bow down. It was the oppression and not the rights of religious 
powers that Juarez sought to crush, and he succeeded. The second Judge of 
the Supreme Court of the Republic, who was for a number of years the lead- 
ing man in the House of Representatives, predicted about ten years ago that 
the clergy in that land must be tolerant, and follow in the future, better than 
they had done in the past, the examples of the lowly Nazarene, or they would 
have to march out of Mexico by thousands. That prediction — although it 
may not have been looked upon as such at the time — was noticed by some 
eminent writers, and has been literally fulfilled. The clergy have, as I have 
been informed, had to leave in great numbers. Nunneries have been abolished, 
and churches have been sold by hundreds, so that in the space of a few years 
$200,000,000 have been confiscated in this way. God has moved in the midst 
of the nation, and I believe a great work will be performed among the rem- 
nants of the House of Israel in that land. The power of God in the mani- 
festation of their faith is greater perhaps than you will find among some of 

the Anglo-Saxon race. It is true, they have been under bondage for nearly

400 years. They may see the power of God made manifest to-day, in the 
healing of their infirmities, and to-morrow forget the blessings of the Lord. 
But in that respect wherein are they different from the children of Israel? Did 
they not witness the power of God in the separation of the waters of the Red 
Sea, and in various other ways? Did they not hear the voice of the Lord, 
and yet longed for the leeks and onions, and threatened to do evil to their 
leader, Moses? 

In this regard the Mexican people are much the same. They have 
ideas, ways and manners, peculiar to themselves. They are in their ex- 
pressions very kind, and wherever we met influential men — men connected 
with the Government of Mexico — we met with uniform kindness. Our recep- 
tion was warm and genuine, and we felt to bless such people. We believe 
that the Lord will yet open up the way by which thousands and hundreds of 
thousands will receive a knowledge of the truth. We have baptized some 
twenty in that land, and have a little branch already formed, and the manifes- 
tations of the power of God among them are not wanting. The second mem- 
ber baptized into the branch is an Indian. It is very clear that he is of the 
House of Israel. After he was ordained to the office of an Elder, he began 
to read, to some extent, our works. He was very much interested in the Book 
of Mormon, so far as it Ls published in the Spanish language, and he has full 
faith in the ordinances of the Gospel. One day a woman was found in the 
street suffering under the influence of an evil spirit, being sadly deranged. 
The police were seeking to allay her feelings and quiet her, while a great 
crowd was attracted by the occurrence. The Indian happened to be. there at 
the time, and, perceiving what was the matter, made his way through the 
crowd to the woman, and in the name of Jesus rebuked the evil spirit, where- 
upon she was quieted, and, to the astonishment of the people, walked away 
without uttering another word. 

Before closing my remarks it might be somewhat interesting to the con- 
gregation to learn the cause which led to sending the Elders to the city of 
Mexico. I will tell you briefly how it occurred. There is a Dr. Rhodacanaty, 
who is, I believe, a Greek on the side of his father and a Mexican on the side 
of his mother. He had been engaged in a socialistic work, having for its ob- 
ject the benefitting of the poorer classes — seeking to organize a system, in some 
respects like our co-operative system here, for the intelligent direction of 
labor, and, having used his influence in this direction for a short time, he be- 
came perplexed, and his mind seemed to close down, so that he could not see 
how to make further progress. He therefore felt to pray to the Lord to give 
him wisdom to proceed. During the night he dreamed that a person came and 
presented to him a book, pressing it emphatically upon his forehead. On the 
following day, while teaching his class in the college, wherein he was Greek 
Professor, a little boy entered and asked him to buy a book. " No," said he 
to the boy, " I do not want your book." " But," says the boy, " you do want 
this book, and it is only a riel" (twelve and a half cents). He told the boy 
again that he did not want the book, but the boy still insisted that he did, and 
finally he took it. When he came to read the book, it proved to be that part 
of the Book cf Mormon which has been translated into the Spanish language. 
From this time he received light daily, and finally communicated with Presi- 



TWO days' meetings. 



dent Taylor, and the result was that the Elders were sent and the mission was- 
opened in Mexico. 

I will relate another circumstance to show you how the wisdom of tfsse- 
Lord is greater than that of man. We became acquainted with Professes- 
Sherwin, an American from the State of Iowa, who was also teaching in tEre- 
Presbyterian College, and who frequently visited us at our rooms. When wit 
had prepared the "Voice of Warning" in manuscript for publication he de- 
sired that the Presbyterians should have a chance to bid for the printing of ft_ 
Elder Stewart told him that they would not print the work. " Why," said Iie„ 
"they surely will not carry prejudice into business matters." " Well," repIfeS 
Brother S., "to please you we will give them a chance to bid on the work, IraS. 
I am satisfied that they will absolutely refuse to publish anything about c Mor— 
monism.' " He went to the printing establishment and offered the work. T&e- 
young men who had charge of the printing office readily assented to bid upoe 
the work, and asked until the next evening, in order that they might bid intel- 
ligently. In the meantime they submitted the matter to the head of the Pres- 
byterian and other churches, (for there they work together — Presbyterians, 
Baptists and Methodists), and when the matter was submitted to the Bishop, 
he scouted the very idea, and said we had not money enough to hire them t© 
print our works. The young men were astonished, and desired to see us ice 
reference to such prejudice. They came and we' talked with them,. saying that 
it was because of the ignorance of the world in reference to us and the princi- 
ples we advocated, that caused much of the prejudice which existed in the min«£s. 
of many who neither knew us nor the object of our mission. We pointed oust 
to them different texts of Scripture, and read from the Bible for some lengtfe 
of time. After we had talked with them an hour or two they desired us tc* 
pray with them, to which we readily assented. Closing the door of our roons,. 
we gave these two young men a chance to pray; and they did so, asking tike- 
Lord, if they had been deceived all the days of their lite, to manifest it andt 
to impart to them a testimony as to whether we spoke by the power of the- 
Holy Ghost or by the wisdom of man, and that they might know by revelations 
for themselves that Jesus was the Christ. We endorsed their prayer, andE 
prayed the Almighty most earnestly that they might have eyes to see, ears tcs> 
hear, and hearts to understand the truth which we sought to impart. The last 
we heard of these two young men was that they were preaching "Mormonism,' r 
and were in a fair way to convert themselves if not others. 

As another instance of the hatred shown towards the " Mormons," I might 
mention that there was a young friend who crossed the Gulf of Mexico witia 
us, being in company with the nephew of the American Minister, Mr. Foster^ 
and who remained in Mexico with us several weeks. This young friend of 
ours met a Methodist Minister one day in the streets of Mexico, and happened? 
to mention that there were " Mormon " missionaries in the city. c " Oh, yes." safd 1 , 
the devout Minister, "and I would to God that the American Government 
would drive all the "Mormons" into the bottom of the sea." I simply mention 
these matters to show how ungenerous and uncharitable are the feelings of 
many religious denominations, or the members thereof, towards us as a people. 
They may never have known a " Mormon," they may never have met one ; the>- 
certainly have received no unkindness at the hands of our people, and they 



20 



TWO days' meetings. 



have never placed themselves in a position to receive the courtesies of the 
people. I believe that as a general thing where men, influential, intelligent 
and honest men, have visited Salt Lake City, or other parts of the Territory, 
they have almost invariably spoken kindly of the "Mormon" people. I of course 
except a certain class, namely, those who make it their mission to persecute, 
hate and despise us— such men of course exhibit bitterness ; deprive them of 
that and there would be little left of them. But the best thing we can do is to 
pass them by. In doing so I do not know that we can say in their case what 
the Lord said to the Jews, "Father, forgive them, they know not what they 
do." I fear many of them too well know what they do ; but they have their 
mission, let them fill it. As an individual, I do not feel that we can afford to 
bestow much time or attention to what such may do or say. I learned one 
thing during my early boyhood, and that is that I cannot hate man and at the 
same time love God ; therefore I pay little attention to what those evil dis- 
posed persons may do. They are in the hands of the Almighty, who will meet 
to them a just punishment. Let us pity rather than despise them. 

This I know, God will establish his Kingdom and carry it off victorious ; 
he will redeem his»people and make Zion to shine. But when I think of the 
benighted condition which the nations are in, it fills my heart with sorrow. I 
feel to thank God that he has placed in our hearts these compassionate feel- 
ings. To us he has been compassionate, and filled us with tender mercy. 
Therefore it becomes our duty as Elders to go to the ends of the earth to 
preach the Gospel. To the Lamanites? Yes; to every part of the habitable 
globe, to say to every people that we know that Jesus is the Christ, and he 
only can say this truthfully who has the spirit of prophecy upon him, because 
as it is written, "the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy." Let us 
then make it the mission of our lives to preach the Gospel to the nations of 
the earth, to extend to them this knowledge which has made us so happy, and 
which has made us the people that we are. 

There will be a great work accomplished in Mexico. I feel that the La- 
manites in that land will receive the Gospel by thousands. God will give 
them the power to heal the sick, unstop the eyes of the blind, and to open the 
ears of those that are deaf. He will manifest himself unto them as he did to 
their forefathers, the children of Israel. They have been downtrodden for 
more than three hundred years. They filled the cup of their iniquity, and 
thirty millions of them were killed off in about forty years. He permitted 
this to come upon them because of their iniquity and the sin of their fathers 
in slaying the prophets. The Spanish nation was once a great nation, but God 
has humbled them. In the work of death that nation filled a fearful mission 
among the Indians of Mexico and Peru, since when they have been treading 
the downward track. To-day what is Spain? A fallen, broken, Catholic- 
ridden nation that cannot understand the whisperings of the Spirit of God. 
But the remnant of Israel will come forth and manifest that they have faith in 
their forefathers, who knew Jesus, and when their children hear his voice a 
stranger they will not follow. 

May God bless the mission in Mexico, and the poor Indians whom our 
own great nation has .seemed determined to exterminate, but who will yet 
arise and prove to the world their worth. May God bless them to this end.

We have no mission save that of peace. We do not go to teach them the 
art of war, although many of them are soldiers. You can frequently see the 
streets of Mexico crowded with well drilled Indian regiments, but our mission 
to them or others is not war, it is peace and good will to all. And may the 
Lord give us power to extend this to them, is my prayer, in the name of Jesus. 
Amen.

ELDER OESON PBATT. 

It is many months since I attempted, except on one occasion, to address a 
public congregation. On account of ill health and other circumstances, I have 
refrained from public speaking, except at the former meeting held in this house 
last winter. I do not know whether I shall be able to raise my voice to that 
loudness that the congregation will be able to understand; I will, however, do 
the best that I can. I pray my Father in heaven to pour out his Spirit upon 
me, that what I may say — whether it be a few words or many — may be indited 
by the gift and inspiration of the Holy Ghost, without which all our preaching 
is in vain. 

I certainly, for one, was very much instructed in our forenoon meeting, 
especially in regard to the remarks of the first speaker on the fiftieth anniver- 
sary since the organization of this church ; and I was also very much instructed 
in the remarks made by the following speaker. 

It is a great delight to me, as an individual, to look forth upon the large 
congregations of the Latter-day Saints who are assembled from time to time 
in these mountains, in the capacity of a General Conference. In all these 
assemblies and conferences I remember the early rise of this church; I re- 
member when we were a small people, when we could assemble ourselves in a 
very small room, and that in General Conference. I remember the first Con- 
ference that I attended, on the 2d day of January, 1831, consisting perhaps of 
some seventy or eighty members in all, assembled in the house of Father 
Whitmer, whose sons were chosen to be especial witnesses in relation to this 
great latter-day work. I remember our trials, our difficulties, our gathering, 
our persecutions, our afflictions, more or less, from that day until the present 
time. Then I was but a boy nineteen years of age ; now I am over sixty-eight, 
and in a few months more fifty years will have passed over my head since I 
was first baptized into this church. How thankful I ought to be that I am still

living. How thankful I ought to be that I am still numbered with this people. 
How thankful. I ought to be that I have the opportunity and privilege of ad- 
ministering in your public congregations, preaching the words of eternal life, 
lifting up my voice in humble testimony concerning the great work which the 
Lord our God has been doing during the last fifty years. 

Among the ancient Jewish nation in the land of Palestine there was a 
law ordained in relation to the fiftieth year. Every fiftieth year was to be a 
peculiar year in the midst of that nation. There were many special times set 
apart by the Almighty, as times that were symbolical in their nature ; times 
laving reference to the future, among which was the cultivation of the earth 
for six years, and on the seventh year the land was made to rest. The tribes 
<©f Israel cultivated the soil, but they were required on the seventh year to let 
the whole land rest. I presume that the Lord had in view several things to be 
-symibolized by these six years of labor and the resting on the seventh. This 
a© doubt had a reference to the creation of the heavens and the earth, so that 
ike Israelites might keep in remembrance the great work which was accom- 
plished by the Lord our God in the beginning — the formation or organization 
of the temporal heavens over our heads, and also of the earth upon which we 
^stand. By resting on the seventh year from all their labors, they symbolized 
tfeat which existed, or took place, when the seventh period or time came round 
in the creation. In six days, we are informed, this great work of creation was 
performed, at least so far as the spiritual portion thereof was concerned. On 
•the seventh day, we are informed by new revelation, as well as instructed in 
part by old revelation, that the Lord rested. He did not commence resting, as 
ssome have supposed, on the sixth day evening, neither at midnight, nor early 
-®n the seventh day, because there was a certain work to be performed on the 
seventh day, which the Lord delayed until that time. On the seventh day the 
Lord formed the garden of Eden, planted the trees of that garden, laid out the 
work, beautified it, and also placed man in the garden, having formed his fleshly 
Sabernacle, which was also the work of the morning of the seventh day, and 
"fee has informed us that on the morning of that day there was no flesh upon 
the earth except the man whom he had formed and placed in the garden. Yet 
all the children of men were created the day previous, or the period previous, 
called the sixth day, so that they all existed ; but the Lord says " in heaven 
created I them." They were not created here upon the earth, but they were 
• created in heaven ; but on the seventh day man was placed here upon the 
earth, having a tabernacle of flesh and bones. So says the new translation, 
or that portion thereof contained in this book, called the " Pearl of Great 
Price." I have oftentimes thought, when reading these revelations, that they 
typified something ; or that the Lord would not fully accomplish his work in 
six thousand years preparatory to the day of rest, but intended, on his part, to 
do something on the morning of the seventh thousand years, just as he did in 
Hie beginning. Was the spirit of man placed on the earth in a body of flesh 
and bones on the morning of the seventh day of the creation? He was. 
What was that typical of? Typical of the resurrection, when the righteous 
wall again have fleshly tabernacles, formed, as in the beginning, out of the 
-.dmst of the earth ; when they will come forth from the grave with immortal 
'foodies. These bodies will be flesh and bones, like unto the bodies of the first

pair that were formed on the morning of the seventh day. Was the first man 
immortal? He was. Will those who shall be resurrected, or formed from the 
dust of the grave, in the morning of the seventh thousand years, also be im- 
mortal? They will; the one being typical of the other. Was there any curse 
upon the earth when the first man was permitted to occupy it with a body of 
flesh and bones? There was not. There was no death; indeed, man was 
"the first flesh upon the earth, the first man also." There were no beasts on 
the earth, no fowls to fly in the firmament of heaven, no fish to swim in the 
sea. But you may ask, how is this? Do we not read that on the fifth day God 
created great whales, fish of all kinds that could swim in the sea, &c? Yes. 
How was it, then, that there was no flesh on the earth, neither in the sea, on 
the seventh day till man was placed there? All that we need in reconciling 
the two chapters is to understand the two creations. Everything was created 
first spiritual. The fish that swim in the waters were first made spiritual. The 
fowls that fly in the open firmament of the heavens, that were created also on 
the fifth day, were made spiritual. Their spirits existed and were formed; 
but God saw proper that on the seventh day the first flesh that should be on 
the earth should be man. Afterwards, out of the ground the Lord God made 
the beasts of the field and every creeping thing, and cattle, and every beast 
after his kind; that is, in the beginning, the first pairs were formed and placed 
upon this new creation, not before, but after man was placed here. Is this 
typical of anything? Yes; typical of the resurrection of beasts as well as of 
man, according to the revelations contained here in the Book of Doctrine and 
Covenants. Everything to which the Lord has granted life will be brought 
forth in its time and in its season, be resurrected, receive its body, and the 
spirits of beasts, and the spirits of fowls, and the spirits of fish and all ani- 
mated beings will receive their bodies in the resurrection, and be made im- 
mortal, as they were on the morning of the seventh day; the one being typical 
of the other. This is one thing, no doubt, that the Lord intended to symbol- 
ize, in order to keep in remembrance before the minds of the children of Is- 
rael concerning that first great work of his, "firstly spiritual, and secondly 
temporal, which was the beginning of his work." 

Another thing intended to be typified by this seventh year, wherein the 
land was commanded to rest, was to show forth the future, to show forth the 
last of his work, which will be "firstly temporal and secondly spiritual," being 
the last of his work pertaining to this creation. But unto himself there is no 
beginning nor end of his works, neither to his words. Two great and impor- 
tant things were, therefore, symbolized by these ordinances which the children 
of Israel were required to observe throughout their generations, namely, the 
great future of this creation, commencing with the great temporal work in the 
morning of the seventh thousand years, wherein everything will be restored to 
its proper condition, as it was in the animal creation, with the fowls and fish 
and beasts, and man on the morning of the seventh day of creation. 

Prior to this time, or during this period of time, wherein this second tem- 
poral work will commence, there will be a literal sounding of seven trumpets, 
as recorded in the book of Doctrine and Covenants, page 278, electrotype edi- 
tion, which you can read at your leisure. I will give you the words of the 
revelation, so that you can read it when you go home. It is called the "Key

to the revelations given to St. John on Patmos." Joseph, inquiring of the 
Lord about the sounding of the seven trumpets, is informed that the sounding 
would take place, not directly near the close of the six thousand years, or 
rather not during the period of the six thousand years, but after the seventh 
thousand years should commence. He says that the sounding of the seven 
trumpets typifies this: "That as God made the world in six days, and on the 
seventh day he finished his work, and sanctified it, and also formed man out of 
the dust of the earth; even so, in the beginning of the seventh thousand years 
will the Lord God sanctify the earth and complete the salvation of man, and 
judge all things, and shall redeem all things* except that which he has not put 
into his power, when he shall have sealed all things, unto the end of all things; 
and the sounding of the trumpets of the seven angels are the preparing and 
finishing of his work, in the beginning of the seventh thousand years; the 
preparing of the way before the time of his coming." Thus we see, that as 
man in the beginning "was formed out of the dust of the earth" "on the 
seventh day," in his immortal state, so he shall be brought forth in the resur- 
rection from the dust of the grave, on the morning of the seventh thousand 
years, by the sounding of these trumpets, to inherit certain blessings, even as 
it was promised in the beginning. 

We perceive, therefore, from the revelations of God, that the Lord insti- 
tuted these ordinances and laws for the children of Israel for a double purpose, 
not only to commemorate the past, but to keep in the vivid remembrance of 
the children of Israel the great future, which they were never to lose .sight of. 

Moreover, they were not only required, in the days of ancient Israel, to let 
their lands remain uncultivated in the seventh year, and to rest, but the Lord 
also, in order to doubly fix this idea upon their minds, established what is 
termed a year of Jubilee. After seven times seven years had passed away — 
that is, forty-nine years — then came the fiftieth year, which seemed to be 
above all the rest, so far as the observance thereof was concerned, and so far 
as certain duties were required at their hands. It was to be a year of rest, a 
year of jubilee — a year wherein all real estate that had been sold during the 
past fifty years was to return again to the original owners. They could not 
sell their lands as we sell ours; that was not permitted; no man could sell his 
land in that time for fifty-one, fifty-two, nor one hundred years, nor to the 
people and their heirs forever. No such thing existed in those days as now 
exist in this and among other nations ; their lands could only be sold for fifty 
years ; then came the year of redemption, wherein all lands that were sold 
were to return to their original owners, or to the tribe, or their descendants, as 
the case might be ; it matters not who bought it or paid for it, that was always 
understood in the deed of sale. It was the custom in those ancient times to 
purchase individuals for a certain term of years, in consequence of debts, &c, 
that they may have contracted; they would buy the people, not exactly as hired 
servants, but they were compelled, according to the laws of the nation, to re- 
main in servitude for a certain period of time ; but that period never extended 
beyond the year of Jubilee. When that notable year came, all those hand- 
maidens and servants that may have been sold in consequence of the debts 
that they had contracted, were to go free ; all had the promise of liberty. It 
was a year of general release from bondage. There are a great many other 



TWO days' meetings.

privileges that might be named, set forth in the revelations of God, that existed 
in the year of Jubilee. Whether such a year will again be established by reve- 
lation, I do not certainly know; whether the Lord will command his servants to 
commemorate past events by the establishment of such a custom, in a time to 
come, is not fully revealed. It is revealed, however, in part, so that we may 
draw some conclusions from what has been revealed in ancient times. Moses 
says, by the word of the Lord, that when that people, Israel, should corrupt 
themselves before the heavens, and should do after the manner of the abomi- 
nations of the heathen nations round about — should forget the Lord their God, 
should bow down to the idols of the heathen nations, and turn away from the 
Lord, that he would send certain curses upon them, and among those curses 
they were to be scattered to the uttermost parts of the earth, &c, as mentioned 
in the 28th chapter of Deuteronomy. A long list of plagues is given that 
should follow them among all the nations whither they should be driven. After 
they had experienced all these things, Moses says: "When thou shalt return 
unto the Lord thy God, and shall obey his voice, according to all that I com- 
mand thee this day, thou and thy children, with all thy heart and with all thy 
soul; that then the Lord thy God will turn thy captivity, and have compassion 
upon thee, and will return and gather thee from all the nations, whither the 
Lord thy God hath scattered thee. If any of thine be driven out unto the ut- 
most parts of heaven, from thence will the Lord thy God gather thee, and 
from thence will he fetch thee: And the Lord thy God will bring thee unto the 
land which thy fathers possessed, and thou shalt possess it, and he will do 
thee good and multiply thee above thy fathers." Now, notice the conditions 
of this gathering: "And shall obey his voice according to all that I com- 
mand thee this day." What were they commanded in that day? Among other 
things they were commanded to keep the year of Jubilee; to keep a great many 
other ordinances, such as the seventh year to let their land rest; also to keep 
certan feasts, such as the feast of tabernacles and the passover; and many 
other things, all of which were commanded in that day, and in that age, by the 
mouth of the servant of God, even Moses ; when they should remember all 
these things, even every commandment, not neglecting one, then the Lord 
their God, should permit them to enjoy all the blessings of the promised land. 
I draw the conclusion, from this saying, that there will be a time when Israel 
shall return to their own lands, and that they will again keep the year of jubi- 
lee; I draw the conclusion that they will also offer up, as it is written in the 
Scriptures, offerings to the Lord; that they will keep all the commandments 
given unto them through the servant of God, even Moses. How long these 
institutions, given to Moses, will be observed; how long they will be com- 
pelled or required to give heed to that which he commanded them, through 
Moses, I do not know. The time may come, when they prove to the Lord 
that they can keep those commandments and do his will — the time may come 
when some of these ordinances may be done away. 

But because such events may happen among Israel in their great future, is 
no evidence that we, as Latter-day Saints, should institute any of these things 
among ourselves, unless we are directed by divine revelation from the heav- 
ens. I do not know that we are under any obligations to keep any of the ordi- 
nances, rites, and ceremonies, that were given in the days of Moses, unless 



26 



TWO DAYS' MEETINGS 



we receive direct revelation for ourselves in relation to these matters. If the 
Lord should, at some future period of the history of this Curch, see proper to 
give us a commandment to keep every fiftieth year sacred unto him, in order 
to commemorate certain events that took place in the past, I think that this 
people will be ready and willing to obey such a commandment. 

Among Israel, in ancient days, they had the law of plurality of marriage. 
Did we adopt that in this Church from these old, ancient commandments? No, 
we did not. Did that give us any authority in the least? No; the laws 
given to Moses have no bearing upon us, unless God should renew his com- 
mandments and laws to us as a people; for we profess, like Israel of old, to 
be under the direction and guidance of new revelation. Like the Church of 
God in all former ages, we receive no new ordinances, neither old ordinances, 
only by new revelation. Did we presume to baptize with water on the author- 
ity of old revelation? No. Did we presume to lay hands upon the people to 
confirm upon them the Holy Ghost, by the authority of ancient revelation? 
No. Did we presume to establish the Church of Jesus Christ, or organize it, 
about fifty years ago, because they established one eighteen hundred years 
ago and upwards? No. Did we presume to officiate in any order of the 
priesthood by virtue of any ancient revelation given to the ancient Saints? 
No. We did not undertake to do any of these things by virtue of former reve- 
lation; but all we have done in this Church has been done by direct commu- 
nication and revelation from heaven ; all the ordinances that we administer 
have been directed by new revelation; all the priesthood that this people hold 
this day was given by new revelation ; all the various duties of the priesthood 
to be performed by us in our day were given by new revelation; and we would 
not dare presume to enter into this or that form of marriage, pertaining to 
plural matrimony, by any former revelation; it has been by new revelation 
that these things have been done. 

We say that this is the kingdom of God, established on the earth. We 
say that it was organized by divine revelation. We say that the authority was 
sent down from heaven and conferred upon the heads of mortal man in our 
generation. We have seen these things in the former days of this Church, or 
at least in the first rise of the Church. The Lord our God was pleased to 
confer the authority that is symbolized by these pictures here in this hall. We 
have no authority given by any other people, any other nation, any other sect, 
any other denomination; we do not consider their pretensions to divine au- 
thority worth the ashes of a rye straw — we mean the whole of their authority 
put together. Hence the Lord has given all these things by his own power. 
Now, if this be the kingdom of God, as we testify, organized and set up by his 
own divine will, the authority restored by his own power, the ordinances re- 
newed by divine revelation, what then should we expect in the future ? Should 
we expect to lay down these principles in the future, and say they are no 
longer required? No. In all our future doings, in all our future journeyings, 
in all our future administrations among the inhabitants of the earth, from this 
time henceforth and forever, the Lord our God is our Lawgiver, the Lord our 
God is our King, the Lord our God is our Revelator, the Lord our God will 
direct in all these things. 

The year of jubilee ! These are words that sound very pleasantly to my 



TWO DAYS' meetings. 



27 



ears. I am looking forward to the Great Jubilee that is now near at hand, and 
when I hear the words spoken from this stand, when I read these ordinances 
that were instituted among ancient Israel, and when my thoughts reach out to 
the great future, to the time when there will be a jubilee indeed, my heart re- 
joices before the Lord. A jubilee for all the Saints of God, wherein they will 
be subject to no power, save it be the. power of God and the power that he 
has ordained; wherein there will be no earthly governments to triumph over 
the Saints of that kingdom; wherein there will be but one government upon 
the face of the whole earth, and the dominion and the greatness of that do- 
minion and that kingdom will extend forth under the whole heavens. It will 
be a time of jubilee — a time wherein the inhabitants of the earth will rejoice, a 
time wherein the inhabitants of heaven will rejoice, a time when the inhabi- 
tants of heaven will join with the inhabitants of the earth in one great, grand, 
general assembly, although we will afterwards be permitted to spread forth in 
our generations over the face of the earth, to perform various duties required 
at our hands ; but yet, in the commencement of that gcand period it will be a 
general assembly of the Church of the First-born — of the living and the dead 
who have died in Christ. Jesus will be our King; he will be our Lawgiver ; 
he will reign over us. The resurrected Saints will be with us. We will hear 
the words of their mouths. They will also be kings and priests; they will 
administer among their households of the generations that shall be in mortal 
flesh; they will be called the priests of God, and will administer in power and 
great glory during the happy period of the Millennium. 

A year of Jubilee ! No sorrow, no sighing, no bondage among the people 
of God, but all will be free, full of joy, full of blessings ; and this jubilee will 
last for one thousand years. Amen. 

EI.DEB CHARLES C. RICH. 

I feel very thankful to enjoy the privilege of meeting .with my brethren 
and sisters in this hall, and of listening to the instructions we have received to-day. 
I often feel that we are a highly favored people in being permitted to gather 
together from the different nations of the earth unto these valleys for the pur- 
pose of being instructed by the spirit and power of God in relation to the 
kingdom of God, and the building up of that kingdom on the earth. We are 
thus a highly favored people, and so far as I am concerned I only feel very 
desirous that we should appreciate the blessings we enjoy, realizing that they 
come from our Heavenly Father, realizing that we are in a position to receive 
such instruction as we need from day to day in order to comprehend his will 
concerning us, and be willing to perform the labor that is required of us. This 
should be our study by day and by night, in order that we may comprehend 
the duties and responsibilities that rest upon us as Saints, that we may perform 
them in the flesh in a manner that will be acceptable to God our Heavenly 
Father. We learn from the revelations that we have received, that the labors 
pertaining to the flesh should be performed whilst in the flesh. We are re- 
quired to perform labors for our friends that have gone before, labors that they 
cannot perform for themselves, and should we pass away without doing this 
work we should fail in our duty. It would be well, therefore, for us to reflect 
upon these principles — that is, upon the principle of performing the labors per- 



28 



TWO days' meetings. 



taining to us in the flesh while we are in the flesh. For this purpose we aie 
laboring to build temples to enable us to perform the works we should per- 
form. I sometimes think, however, that we are a little careless in relation to 
this matter. Having been favored as we have been as Saints of the Most High 
God, being directed what to do and how to do it, let us be found faithful in the 
discharge of the duties that are incumbent upon us. 

There are no people on the earth that I know anything about who have 
been so highly favored as we kave been. We have had the word of the Lord 
from the beginning of this Church until the present time in relation to what 
we should do to build up the kingdom of God on the earth. We have had his 
servants that have said to us "verily, thus saith the Lord," do this thing, and 
that thing in our temporal as well as spiritual affairs that we might perform our 
duties in a manner acceptable to the Lord our God. 

In observing the principles of the everlasting gospel, we find that we are 
removed from difficulties that other people have to encounter. We find the 
gospel has a remedy for all our evils. We may have difficulties to encounter, 
but we have the opportunities of overcoming them. We have the privilege of 
doing right all the time and not doing wrong. Our words can be for good; 
our labors can be for good; and our energies can be used for the establish- 
ment of righteousness on the earth. This is our privilege, and I trust we are 
living with an eye single to the glory of God and the building up of his king- 
dom on the earth, for all other kingdoms, as we have been told, will pass 
away, but his kingdom will remain forever. We must labor in that direction. 
We must seek his Holy Spirit to assist us, for -without it we can accomplish 
but very little. 

The Elders are sent all over the earth, or over a great portion of the earth, 
for the purpose of warning the inhabitants of the earth of the judgments to 
come, and of proclaiming the everlasting gospel that they may have an oppor- 
tunity of embracing it, and be gathered out with his people. This is a privi- 
lege that is offered far and wide to the inhabitants of the earth inasmuch as 
they will receive it; but we have found that the great majority are not dis- 
posed to receive the benefits and blessings of the gospel; only a few out of 
the many are willing to hearken to the counsels offered unto them. We are 
among the few that have listened to and obeyed the principles of the gospel, 
and we are privileged to meet together on this occasion, and other occasions, 
for the purpose of being instructed in relation to the duties resting upon us. 
We find we do not learn everything at once. We receive something to-day, 
and probably something else tomorrow, and so on from time to time, and thus 
our knowledge increases in relation to the things of God. This is a great 
blessing to us ; and we should embrace every opportunity of overcoming our 
faults, our follies, and our imperfections, realizing that they do us no good. 
They are an injury to us, and as fast as we can overcome them so fast are we 
blessed. 

I have thought sometimes that we are more anxious to know some things 
in relation to the future than we are things pertaining to the present life. I 
feel that it is a very important matter to comprehend the duties of this life, 
what we should do, and what we should not do. For instance, if the Lord de- 
sires a temple built, it is very desirable that we should know how to build it; 



TWO days' meetings.

if the Lord desires that we should go on a mission it is very desirable that we 
should go on that mission. These are things that we want to understand, and 
when we understand them we want to be engaged in that labor, and thus be 
engaged in that work the Lord requires us to perform. We have already 
learned that the Lord wants us to build temples for the purpose of redeeming 
our dead. We are engaged in that labor, and I trust we will accomplish the 
work required at our hands as speedily as possible. I will say, however, that 
I find a good spirit — and a willing spirit — to engage in this work, and the Lord 
has blessed those who have labored on these temples. He has poured out his 
blessings upon them ; they have received an abundance to sustain them, and 
have got means as fast in laboring to build these temples as they did when 
engaged in other work. The Lord has verily fulfilled his promises in relation 
to this matter. 

We cannot carry with us behind the vail gold and silver, houses and lands, 
or any earthly substances ; but the principles of eternal life — if we practice 
them in our lives — we will carry them with us. "Straight is the gate and nar- 
row is the way that leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it," is a saying 
of the Savior, and it is for us to reflect upon it. We should never tire in 
doing good. I once met a man who had reached the years of seventy. He 
thought he was free, he thought he had labored enough. Now, I do not 
feel so. I do not think we should feel so, if we live to be a thousand 
years old. I think we should feel to exert ourselves to accomplish all that 
the Lord requires of us both in time and eternity. 

Brother Pratt has been laboring in this Church almost fifty years. I have 
been in the Church a long time myself. What do I find in relation to myself? 
I find that with all my labors, and all the exertions that I have used, I 
come short of having done all that I would like to have done. The longer 
we live the more we learn. Then let us make good use of our time. 
Let us perform all the earthly labors we can, and leave nothing undone, so that 
when we pass away we shall feel satisfied with our labors in this probation, 
and receive the welcome "well done, thou good and faithful servant; thou hast 
been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things ; enter 
thou into the joy of thy Lord." Now, the Lord has offered this freely to all, 
not to one, two, or twenty, but to all. 

Well, I/eel very thankful that my life has been spared to behold the present 
day. I am very thankful that I was willing to receive, in the early rise of this 
Church, the everlasting gospel. I am very thankful that I am able to-day to 
bear testimony that I know it is true, and I know that if we hearken to the 
precepts of the gospel, and live up to them, we will receive an inheritance in 
the celestial kingdom of our God. Let us, then, be found faithful to the duties 
devolving upon us. Let us live with an eye single to the glory of God, to the 
building up of his kingdom, and to accomplishing the work he has designed 
we should accomplish. 

That the Lord may bless us, and bless his Saints everywhere, is my prayer 
in the name of Jesus. Amen.

PRESIDENT JOHN TAYLOR. 

I have been very much interested — as no doubt you all have— in listening 
to the principles that have been unfolded to us this day, in this house. I was 
going to say I almost wish the house was a little larger; but, then, upon re- 
flection, it is right enough ; it was not intended to be as large as the tabernacle. 
The large tabernacle is a place for the assembling of the people in General 
Conference, and on public occasions, and it has.become a question whether we 
had better go into the other building or continue in this to-morrow. However, 
the weather is a little cold and inclement at present, and perhaps by the 
sixth of April it may be a little warmer and more comfortable. If not, we shall 
have to do the best we can. As I stated, this building is not intended for a 
General Conference, but for holding meetings in the winter time when the 
weather is cold, and as a Stake house to hold Priesthood and quarterly Con- 
ferences in, where all may be warm and comfortable ; and so far as that is 
concerned, it seems to me that the house will accomplish all that is required 
in this respect. And then for our Conference meetings we have the large tab- 
ernacle, which will hold, I suppose, three or four times more people than this 
will. I am sorry that there should be a necessity for any to turn away; but we 
cannot always help these things, and it is better for those that are here to be 
comfortable, than for all to be uncomfortable, cold and unpleasant. 

In regard to the work in which we are engaged, we all feel to a certain 
extent interested therein, and there are many points that it will be necessary 
for us to reflect upon. One is, that it is "not every one that saith unto me, 
Lord, Lord, that shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the 
will of my Father which is in heaven." And it is for us to square our lives 
according to the principles laid down for all of us ; for all of the officers ; for 
the Twelve and their Counselors; for the Presidents of Stakes and their 
Counselors; for High Priests, for Seventies, Elders, Priests, Teachers and 
Deacons ; and for every man to magnify his calling with singleness of heart 
before God, and to feel that God demands of us righteousness, truth and in- 
tegrity in our hearts ; that we cleave unto him, observe his laws and keep his 
commandments; and if we do this, then the blessings of which we have heard 
are ours; if we do not we shall not possess them. 

I do not wish to talk long, as the time has expired. I thought I would make 
a very few remarks. There are other things to attend to ; but for the present 
I will desist.

Prayer by Elder Charles C. Rich. 

ELDER BEIGHAM YOUNG. 

We have been highly edified during our meetings in this hall, and I am 
thankful for the privilege of meeting with the Saints in this beautiful building. 
It is certainly a great improvement upon those brush boweries that we once 
occupied, and even upon the old tabernacle that formerly stood in this corner 
of the block. If we are improving as Latter-day Saints in spiritual things, and 
in union in temporal matters, as we are improving in wealth, in architectural 
taste, and in all of those amenities that make life agreeable in a temporal point 
of view, no doubt it is well with us. I presume that we are advancing in the 
knowledge of God, and that we are preparing ourselves for a future life and 
exaltation in the kingdom of God. But when we examine ourselves closely, 
it is evident we are not making the progress in the knowledge of the things of 
the kingdom of God that we should make, as the representatives of the 
Almighty in this whole earth. Of all the millions of people that inhabit this 
globe the Latter-day Saints alone, so far as I know, represent the kingdom of 
God upon the earth, represent the great latter-day work — the restoration of 
all things — and are in possession of those ordinances which reach into eternity 
and which are of so vital importance to the future existence of all mankind. 
Do we truly realize the importance of the position we occupy? We have had 
revelation; we are receiving revelation constantly. God has placed us in a 
position that we may communicate with the heavens, that we may receive in- 
spiration of the Holy Ghost and be actuated thereby in all the labors of this 
life. But in our daily avocations we fail frequently to enjoy the free flow of 
that Spirit that comes from above ; our humanity too often steps in between, 
and when this is our condition we become more or less subject to other influ- 
ences whose work is to deceive and lead astray. There is a principle of reve- 
lation which all Saints are required to understand and observe. It is not our 
province to have angels of God visit us, as they certainly did the Prophet 
Joseph Smith, when he laid out the broad foundation of the kingdom of God 
upon the earth. In his case their visits were actually necessary; for nothing 
short of direct communication with the heavens could have enabled him to do 
the work he did; in ours it is different. The foundation is already laid accord- 
ing to divine approval and the work of building fairly on its way; revelations 
communicating the will of the Lord have been given for our profit and general 
guidance, and it remains with us to carry ft on to completion. But there is a 
principle of revelation in the heart of every Latter-day Saint which, if cher- 
ished and encouraged, is calculated to lead us safe in all the minor affairs 
of life ; and we should live, and it is our privilege to so live, as to be operated 
upon by the influences of the Spirit of God through all our labors until the 
whisperings of that Spirit shall be constantly with us. Man is in a fallen con- 
dition; we realize this every day. He looks hither and thither; he casts his

TWO days' meetings. 



eyes to the right and to left, and desires this thing and the other thing, and 
wishes and hopes to obtain them; and thus follows after those earthly posses- 
sions, paying heedless regard to more weighty things of the kingdom. Now, 
the principle of revelation should be in the breast of every Latter-day Saint; 
it should be there and continue to grow and increase and expand in the hearts 
of the people until they are thoroughly imbued with that Spirit. It will not 
come in a day nor perhaps in a year, nor in a series of years ; it will take years 
and years of faithfulness on the part of the Latter-day Saints before their 
minds can be wholly and fully absorbed by the spirit of revelation, so that 
every thought and every act will be prompted by the influence of the Spirit of 
God. It is our duty to encourage that Spirit until it absorbs the whole being, 
until all our thoughts and actions shall spring from that pure source which 
comes from above. 

Now, that our acts do not comport with this teaching at all times, I am 
aware ; but it is expected of us to grow unto these things ; and in order to grow 
unto them, it is necessary for us to take a course to nourish and cherish this 
Spirit in our every day associations and conversations, that nothing may ob- 
struct the free flow of the Holy Spirit unto us. 

We listen to many things that are pleasing to the ear, but which are not 
profitable to the mind. This should not be. The things of the world should 
have no place in the hearts of the Latter-day Saints. If I place myself in a 
condition to receive the things which are outside of this Church and kingdom ; 
if I associate with people who have denied the faith and who acknowledge 
not God, who will not bow in obedience to the principles of the everlasting 
Gospel, and who are, say, spiritualists and infidels — if I associate with such 
men, I must to a greater or less degree partake of their influence. 

Our associations have a great deal to do with either the encouraging or 
discouraging within us the principle of revelation. For instance, I hear 
of people calling themselves Latter-day Saints who make a practice of taking 
their wives and children to beer saloons, and while in such places they get so 
happy that they shout out the songs of Zion, and seem to enjoy themselves to 
a great degree. Does anybody know of circumstances of this kind? Yes; 
we cannot deny it. Who are these people ? Are they Latter-day Saints? I 
should not think so, indeed ; although to hear them sing one might be led to 
believe them the best of people, for they select the choicest ot hymns, and 
they shout them out before men who make a living by selling intoxicating 
liquors. To my mind it is casting pearls before swine. Perhaps you may 
think that is a little strong; but that is the view I take of it. I am aware that 
all the people do not do this ; I am aware, in fact, that they are very few, com- 
paratively speaking. I am not censuring those people who do not do this 
thing, but there are some people who call themselves Latter-day Saints whose 
conduct in this respect is censurable. To associate with the drunkard is not 
the way to encourage the principle of revelation. Every Latter-day Saint is 
bound to encourage this principle if he desires to attain the blessings that ac- 
crue from the everlasting gospel. But there is but one way, one road, and the 
end thereof is life everlasting. 

Now, what shall we do, Latter-day Saints? We are aware of the fact 
that society is sadly mixed up in this city; and that every engine and power of

darkness having a tendency to win away the hearts of our sons and daughters, 
and to allure the weak-minded is at work endeavorjing to lead them down to 
destruction. These local affairs should engage our attention until these evils 
are rooted out from our midst. And let the line be drawn between those that 
live their religion and those that do not. The very best way to show them up 
in their true colors is for us to live our religion and let people see by our works 
that we are for God and his kingdom. 

My prayer is — and I presume it is the prayer of all Latter-day Saints — 
that God will inspire our hearts to do right, to walk in his paths, and help us 
to overcome evil with good. Let us have charity. I believe in charity, I 
would like to have more of it; but I do not consider it is charity for me and 
mine to indulge in the society of those that are apostates, that are wicked in 
their hearts, and will deny the covenants which they have made before their 
Father and God; I do not think itis charity for me to throw pearls before swine. 
I believe in charity, and at the same time I believe in entire cxclusiveness, so far 
as mixing up my interest and striking hands with the unbelievers is concerned. 

That God may help us to cultivate and develop within us the spirit of 
revelation, until every thought shall be inspired from on high, is my prayer, in 
the name of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER JOSEPH F. SMITH. 

While listening to Brother Young, my mind reverted to one or two pass- 
ages in the early revelations given to the Church, which would seem, from the 
testimony we have had from him, to be somewhat applicable at the present 
time as well as at the time the revelations were given, and I thought I would 
refer to, and perhaps read a few of these passages, so that we can reflect upon 
them ourselves. [The speaker then read from the first to the tenth verse of 
the revelation given to Joseph Smith June 22, 1834, page 377 of the new edi- 
tion of Doctrine and Covenants; also from a revelation given De'cember 16, 
1833, first to the nineteenth verse, same book, page 349.] 

I realize that I am speaking to people that have joined the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and as members of that Church, profess 
faith in the Gospel as it has been revealed in this dispensation. It would 
seem, sometimes, almost superfluous to keep preaching upon these plain and 
simple principles, which all ought to understand and be anxious to carry out. 
Nevertheless we find it necessary, and therefore we continue to preach, ex- 
pound, exhort and to plead with the people, our brethren and sisters in the 
covenant of the Gospel, to keep the commandments of God which they have 
covenanted to keep. The Lord keeps pleading with us ; he has to forbear 
with us, to extend mercy, kindness and forgiveness day after day. For we are 
very forgetful, careless, indifferent and thoughtless of our duties. It is only 
when the Spirit of the Lord is upon us that we can really sense the responsi- 
bilities that we are under to God and to each other. When we are engaged in 
the daily avocations of life our minds are occupied with other things; we are 
thinking how to make means, or get wealth, how to provide for our necessities 
and to make our families comfortable. These thoughts take possession of our 
minds and exclude reflections upon the commandments of God which we have 
covenanted to keep, and which, by keeping, we would avoid all the errors, 



34

evils and follies that have been referred to by Elder Young, to which so many 
of us are liable, notwithstanding we are professedly Latter-day Saints. It 
was said by our Savior, to those who professed to be his disciples, "Except 
your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the Scribes and Phari- 
sees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven." Now, when I 
see a Latter-day Saint, or, rather, a person who professes to be a Latter-day 
Saint, guilty of drunkenness, of profanity, of dishonesty, or cheating his 
neighbor, or of bearing false witness against his brother, I say in my heart 
that that man is two-fold more a child of hell than as though he had never been 
baptized; for "to him thatknoweth how to do good and doeth it not, to him it 
is sin," saith the Apostle James. And verily it is true in relation to those who 
profess to be Latter-day Saints, who should know to do good, for they have 
covenanted to do that which is right and forsake that which is evil. That 
covenant has been made with God, and is recorded in the archives of heaven 
as well as upon the earth. If we take a course to violate our covenants, we 
declare our unworthiness before him with whom those covenants are made, 
who understands the nature of the covenants and of the obligations we are 
under, and must regard us as transgressors, far more worthy of chastisement 
than those who have never entei'ed into covenant with the Lord to keep 
his laws. Is not this correct, sound, just and reasonable doctrine? Is not 
this the way in which we would judge ourselves and regard one another? Do 
we not look upon our neighbor, who has made a promise to us and has wilfully 
and intentionally broken that promise, as untrustworthy, as untrue to his word, 
and unworthy of our confidence and esteem? Certainly. Then how much 
more will God, who is perfect, who sees clearly the end from the beginning, 
look upon us with disfavor, who have received the Holy Ghost by the laying 
on of hands, and therefore the means of knowing the way of life, if we turn 
away from the truth and disregard our vows and covenants with God and each 
other. Are, we not, under the circumstances, worthy of condemnation and 
chastisement? If the wicked, who will not repent of their sins, and who 
therefore know not God nor keep his commandments, will be destroyed for 
their wickedness, how much more worthy of destruction will they be who. 
having once repented of their sins and learned the way of life, have turned 
from their righteousness again to their evil practices and ways? 

It is said here, in the language that I have read, "Zion cannot be built up 
unless it is by the principles of the law of the celestial kingdom, otherwise I 
cannot receive her unto myself." In other words, those who profess to be 
Latter-day Saints must become acquainted with the laws of the celestial king- 
dom, must abide by them, must comply with the requirements of heaven and 
hearken to the word of the Lord, in order that Zion may be built up accepta- 
bly, and that we may partake of the benefits and blessings of this labor. For 
it is a labor which devolves upon those who have been called out from the 
midst of the world in this dispensation. We have been called, and so far as 
we will be faithful we are chosen to do this work. But notwithstanding we 
have been called, if we do not prove faithful we will be rejected. I do not 
speak this in reference to the whole Church, but in reference to individual 
members of the Church : for it is my implicit faith and belief that this work 
will never cease, that it will never be given to another people, and that the

purposes and designs of God will be accomplished, for he has decreed it. In 
one sense we are not doing this work, for it is not the work of man, neither 
individually nor collectively, nor of any single quorum of the priesthood, nor 
of all the quorums combined, except God is with them. In other words, it is 
God Almighty who will accomplish this work, and he will use such instru- 
ments as he can find for its accomplishment, and those instruments will be 
honored and blessed of the Lord, and will share in the rewards, exaltation and 
glory of Zion. Yet the honor, glory and power must be ascribed unto the 
Father, Son and Holy Spirit, now and forever, for it is God's work and not 
the work of man. We often hear it said that if such and such a man should 
lead the Church that he would lead it to destruction. I will say, in the name 
of the Lord, that if any man were to lead the Church of Jesus Christ he would 
lead it to destruction ; that is, if the Church would follow. But I will say, on 
the other hand, that if God Almighty chooses a man to lead the Church, God 
will speak through that man. It will not be the man that will lead the Church, 
but it will be God that will do it through that instrumentality, and we will give 
the honor to God; we will not arrogate the credit or the honor to ourselves. 

But we cannot build up Zion except upon the principles of righteousness. 
Men must forsake their wickedness, their lusts, covetousness, greed, and love 
of the pleasures of the world, and bring themselves under the laws of God, or 
they never will partake of the blessings and glory of Zion. And that is not 
all. It is said in the book of Doctrine and Covenants, that we must be willing 
to make a sacrifice of everything that we possess in the world for the King- 
dom of God's sake, and the man or woman that presumes to lay claim to the 
gift of eternal life, who is unwilling to make this sacrifice, will be offering an 
insult to the dignity of the Creator. (See Sixth Lecture on Faith.) It is writ- 
ten that we must love the Lord with all our hearts, and our neighbor as we love 
ourselves. When we reach this point, we shall not be liable to the accusation 
of loving the world more than we love God. It will then be easy to make any 
sacrifice for the sake of truth, though it be the sacrifice of life itself; that is, 
this present life. Jesus said: "Fear not them which kill the body, but are not 
able to kill the soul; but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and 
body in hell." Rather fear God than man. Rather fear to offend the Al- 
mighty than to offend mankind. Rather fear to trangress the laws of God 
than those of men. 

There are some few, so called, very good Latter-day Saints, who have 
formed the acquaintance of those who are not members of the Church, and 
because of these associations they are led into saloons to drink with them, not 
daring to refuse for fear of offending their friends ! I say a man who is so 
weak as to do that is not fit to be an Elder in the Church of Jesus Christ, nor 
to be fellowshipped, or held as in good standing in the ward in which he lives. 
Why? Because his example is bad. He shows weakness and unworthiness 
before the Lord and mankind. He has not the strength of character to refuse 
to join his friend in doing an evil, for fear of offending that friend. The same 
principle would lead him, and, by his example, others perhaps, to gambling, 
stealing, profanity, whoredom, or anything else in the catalogue of crime. I 
love a man who dares refuse to do wrong, no matter where he is nor what the 
wrong even to drinking hot drinks, or neglecting the " Word of Wisdom." 



36 



TWO days' meetings. 



Many of our good people have become so weak that, according to the "Word 
of Wisdom," they are not worthy to be called Saints, for it is "adapted to the 
capacity of the weak and the weakest of all Saints who are or can be called 
Saints." But says one, " If I am offered a cup of tea or a cup coffee I cannot 
refuse it." Then, according to the word of the Lord, you are too weak to be a 
Latter-day Saint. 

It has been said that Brother Joseph F. Smith is "radical." Perhaps so, 
for when I give my word I expect to fulfil it; I always have felt so, and always 
have endeavored to keep my word whenever I have given it. Those to whom 
my word is given have a right to expect and demand its fulfilment, or a justifi- 
able reason for failing to do so. And if ever I fail to fulfil my word, I hope 
to be able to give a sufficient reason for it. I do not presume that I am better 
than the Lord, I do not think that man can be better than God; I therefore 
suppose that when God has given his word that he will fulfil it; I suppose 
that when he makes a requirement of men he expects them to comply there- 
with, and doubly so when they have agreed to comply, and if they fail, I am 
simple enough to believe with all my heart that God Almighty will demand 
satisfaction. Does any one call me radical for that? If so, then I confess 
that I am radical. When I read the laws of God in this good book (the Bible), 
that the liar, the hypocrite, the sorcerer, and the adulterer, cannot enter the 
kingdom of heaven, I understand that that is what is meant. I can give it no 
other construction or meaning, therefore I believe that liars, adulterers, drunk- 
ards, sorcerers, &c, &c, will not get into the kingdom of heaven, without 
they repent and make restitution for the wrongs they have done ; God has 
opened the way of escape for those that will hearken to and avail themselves 
of" the privileges of the Gospel. " Who is there," says the Lord, " that hath 
understanding, that I have not called to repentance." There is not one that 
God has not called to repentance, which means the forsaking of sin, a depar- 
ture from evil to do righteousness and walk in the way of life and salvation. I 
understand that unless we do this we will be weighed in the balance and found 
wanting. Can you take any other view of these matters? How can a man 
excuse himself for drunkenness, when he knows that it is injurious to himself, 
to his family and others, and is forbidden by the law of God, and is a violation 
of the most sacred covenants he can make? How can a man excuse himself 
under these circumstances? What reason will he be able to give before God? 
How can he escape the damnation that awaits the wicked? It is written that 
" not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom 
of heaven." No; but those who keep the commandments of God, who walk 
righteously before him; they shall say "Lord, Lord," and the Lord will 
hearken unto them. 

The cry of the angel was, "Come out of her (Babylon), my people, that 
ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues." The 
doom of Babylon is sealed. The judgments of God will be poured out upon 
her; they are at the door; the wicked will perish; Babylon will fall, for God 
has decreed it. They have rejected the prophets, and have shed the blood of 
the Saints and of those who brought life and salvation unto them. They have 
cast out the Church of Christ from their midst and have called it evil ; they 
have blackened the character of those that have taken leading parts in the 



TWO days' meetings.

Church and Kingdom of God. Therefore, the cup of her iniquity is about 
full, and the cry is, " Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of 
her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues." Now what will it avail us 
to come out of Babylon, if we bring Babylon with us, or continue her prac- 
tices in Zion? It does not look to me as though it would be much benefit. I 
read, in the sixth chapter of the second epistle of Paul to the Corinthians, 
something that is applicable to some of us in our present condition. Paul 
says: u Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers ; for what fellow- 
ship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? And what communion hath 
light with darkness? And what concord hath Christ with Belial? Or what 
part hath he that believeth with an infidel? And what agreement hath the 
Temple of God with idols ? For ye are the Temple of the living God ; as God 
hath said, I will dwell in them and walk in them, and I will be their God, and 
they shall be my people. Wherefore, come out from among them, and be ye 
separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing, and I will receive 
you, and will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters, 
saith the Lord Almighty." Do you want any stronger language than that? Do 
you want any stricter command? for it is the word of God to us, although it is 
recorded here in the Second Epistle of Paul to the Corinthians, and written 
eighteen hundred years ago, or more, to the ancient Saints. It applies equally 
to us. The Bible contains the law of God to this people. The Lord says: 
"Thou shalt take the things which thou hast received, which have been given 
unto thee in my Scriptures for a law, to be my law to govern my Church, and 
he that doeth according to these things shall be saved, and he that doeth them 
not shall be damned, if he continues." Thus you see the Bible is in force, 
and this is the word of the Lord to the people, " Come out from among them, 
and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing." Do not 
assimilate to their ways, but forsake them, and in the name of reason and hu- 
manity, for the sake of the kingdom and for your own sakes, do not let it be 
necessary for an Elder of Israel to repeat on the stand what has been stated 
this day in your hearing by Elder Brigham Young. Let it not be necessary to 
proclaim these evils among the Latter-day Saints at a Conference of the peo- 
ple; let it be possible when we come together for the Elders who speak to tes- 
tify of the good works of the people, of their increasing faith in God, of the 
power of God manifest in their midst, and to exhort the people to continued 
faithfuluess and progress in the right path, until Zion shall be redeemed, the 
world subdued, and evil put under foot. Zion must be built up on the princi- 
ples of righteousness, truth, and obedience to the laws of God; not an ignor- 
ant nor a "blind obedience " or submission to the requirements of heaven or 
the dictates of the priesthood, but an intelligent submission to the laws of God; 
for the Lord has said that he " requireth the heart and a willing mind, and the 
willing and the obedient shall eat the good of the land of Zion in these last 
days ; and the rebellious shall be cut off out of the land of Zion, and shall be 
sent away, and shall not inherit the land." 

May the Lord bless us as a people, and help us to be united, to be more 
faithful and upright, to live our religion, so that our righteousness may exceed 
that of the Scribes and Pharisees of this dispensation, and to keep aloof from 
the wicked and ungodly, is my earnest prayer, in the name of Jesus. Amen.

COUJNTSELOB DANIEL H. WELLS. 

I have ever felt loth to bring before a public congregation the misdeeds 
of a few, lest a credulous public be led to suppose that evil is more prevalent 
among us than it really is; and for this reason, perhaps, if for no other, I 
feel ashamed that such things as have been referred to should exist. I have 
felt rather that people should turn away from evil and cleave to the Lord, and 
maintain that better character before him, before one another and before the 
world. It would seem as though it were necessary to bring up such matters, 
on the principle, perhaps, that a wound in order to be healed should be prob- 
ed. But it would seem, too, that such things that have been referred to to-day, 
if they do exist in the church, that while they should not pass unrebuked, 
there is certainly a more proper time and place to deal with them than before 
a public congregation. 

We are gathering out from the midst of the people of the earth to be 
taught in the ways of the Lord, and to walk more perfectly in his paths, that 
we may learn righteousness, and come to a knowledge of the the mind and the 
will of our Father who is in heaven. God has decreed that he will redeem the 
earth from sin and wickedness, and establish his own rule and dominion there- 
on. And it is necessary in order to build up the kingdon of God on the earth 
that the Lord should have a people prepared with whom he can work, and who 
will be submissive and ready to do his will. We pray to our Father, saying, 
"Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth, as it is done in heaven." 
Now, how can this come to pass until the Lord has a people who shall be wil- 
ling to do his will, and who shall be desirous to walk in the path that he marks 
out for them. Do we realize how very far we are from the Lord's ways; how 
we have been instructed in the ways of the world through the traditions and 
false teachings of generations that are passed, and which we have inherited. 
We had been taught the precepts of men instead of the commandments of 
God. Now, however, it is plain that the Lord is endeavoring to work a refor- 
mation in the midst of his children; and for this purpose he has made known 
his laws again, laws which are calculated to redeem the people from the 
thraldom of sin and iniquity so prevalent in the world; and he has made them 
applicable to this generation, hence they are in force upon the human family. 
He has brought them home to our senses, and it is with delight that we behold 
them in contrast with the erroneous teachings we have received from men who 
have professed to be the teachers of religion, who have professed to be the 
servants of God, who have professed to stand in holy places and to lead the 
people in the way of life and salvation — I say, they have proposed to do all 
these things, whereas they have neither the authority nor the knowledge to do 
so, because they have not been called of the Lord for that purpose, nor have 
they the revealed will of heaven to direct them. They have sought to teach 
their own will ; they themselves are blind, and they lead the blind, and they 
must sooner or later fall into the pit together. Our minds, however, have 
been touched with the Spirit of the living God, made manifest unto us. And 
this is what inspired us to come out from the midst of the world to these val- 
leys of the mountains, where the Lord has appointed to build a Zion unto his 
holy name, where he has condescended to establish his authority, and also to 
build temples in which to attend to the ordinances of his house. We have

been gathered from the midst of the nations with this object in view, under the 
inspiration of the Almighty, to do his will and to bring to pass his purposes 
and establish his purposes upon the earth. Is not this what has actuated us 
and brought us together to these valleys? If there was any other motive or 
design I do not know what it was. There are places more desirable to men 
than these sterile valleys; there are places where the land is richer and where 
better seasons prevail, and where more profitable results can be obtained in 
many respects ; for this is not so very desirable a country, in fact a great portion 
of it is very undesirable and unprofitable to man for settlements. But it is not 
for the sake of wealth that we have come here ; it is to be taught in the ways 
of the Lord, and to walk in his paths ; it is to keep his commandments, to do 
his will that it. may be done on earth as it is done in heaven. 

Reference has been made this afternoon to the words, "Come out of her, 
my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins and that he receive not of her 
plagues." Now, we have gathered bodily, but if we have brought with us the 
evils that are so prevalent in the world, have we gathered in the spirit as the 
people of God should gather? No. We might just as well have stayed in the 
world, and it would have been better indeed to have done so, than to drag the 
evils of the world into the midst of Zion. Any people who will corrupt their 
ways before the Lord are bound for destruction, according to the words of 
the Lord through the prophets. The principles of truth and virtue, and of 
temperance and honesty are the foundation of exaltation, and just as certain 
as people will practise them they will be exalted; and just as sure as they 
indulge in iniquity, it will lead them down to death and destruction, and that, 
too, upon natural principles. There is the way of life, and there is the way of 
death set before us, and it is for us to choose the course we will take; it is 
through obedience to the principles of life we shall obtain an exaltation in the 
celestial kingdom and upon no other. If a person ever inherits a celestial 
glory can he inherit it upon any other principle than that of obeying the laws 
of that kingdom? No; because all kingdoms have laws, and a person can only 
attain to the glory and benefit of that kingdom, the laws of which he observes 
to keep. This is the way I read and understand the revelations of the Lord. 

Now, would it not be better to endeavor to find out the will of God out- 
Heavenly Father concerning ourselves, and live so as to enjoy the light of his 
spirit to guide us in the duties of life ? I think it certainly would. The best 
investment a man can make is to give his all into the kingdom of God, to hold 
himself on the altar ready for the Master's use, to place his ability, his time 
and means at his command to further the purposes of his Father in Heaven, 
and thus accomplish his design and purpose in bringing him into this state of 
existence. It is no haphazard matter that we have been born in this day and 
generation, a day in which God has revealed his mind and will to the children 
of men. He has withheld these spirits to come forth when he should again 
reveal the laws, that peradventure there might be those upon the earth who 
would receive his laws and assist to bring to pass his purposes and designs, 
because it is through the instrumentality of his children that he will bring 
forth his kingdom and prepare the way for the coming of the Lord Jesus 
Christ to rule. For he will rule, even from the rivers to the ends of the earth, 
For the earth is the Lord's and the fulness thereof; it belongs to him; it is his

right to rule, dictate, and lead forth ; and it is only a question of time when 
he will do so. 

I teel well in this work. I cannot express the gratitude that I feel to the 
Lord that he has made manifest unto us his law, his will, the principles of the 
holy gospel, and that he has brought them home to our understanding. We 
have the privilege of learning to know God, whom to know, the Apostle says, 
is life eternal. Now, if to know him is life eternal, we cannot attain to eternal 
life without a knowledge of him. And how can we become acquainted with 
God unless he reveals himself? He has, however, revealed himself to man in 
this our day. We have partially become acquainted with him; we know who 
he is, and who we are, and we know his purpose and design in bringing us 
into this state of existence. It is for us to learn the will and design of God 
our Father concerning us as his children in this probation, that we may fulfil 
the full measure thereof, and be worthy to return into his presence from 
whence we have come. No second or third rate glory will satisfy the Saints 
of God. Nothing short of a full and complete salvation in the celestial king- 
dom of God, can answer their desires and aspirations. But how do we expect 
to attain to that glory ? As I have already observed, there is no other way 
save that of keeping a celestial law. This is plainly set forth here in the Book 
of Doctrine and Covenants, it having been revealed to the servant of the 
Lord in the day and age in which we live. We do not go back to the myste- 
rious ages in order to attain this knowledge. God has revealed it to us in this 
our day; and although we do believe in the Bibie, Book of Mormon, and 
Doctrine and Covenants, nevertheless we have also the living oracles here 
day by day to teach us in the ways of truth and righteousness. Can we govern 
and control ourselves? We can partly, but I can conceive that in a great 
many instances we could do much better. Many of us, no doubt, are doing as 
well as we can, and yet we are not doing as well as we know how. We, 
perhaps, know a great many things which may be utterly impossible for us to 
bring into actual practice owing to surrounding circumstances ; but yet many 
are doing the best they can, and we should all the time try to do as well as we 
know how. Our struggle should be to progress in the knowledge of God and 
the things pertaining to eternal life, that our course may be onward and up- 
ward until we "all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the 
Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fullness 
of Christ." It is true we are imperfect; the traditions of our fathers are upon 
us, and I know of and could point out a great many things that are erroneous 
which our fathers in their ignorance taught and practised. But there is one 
thing that people who live in this day will have to account for, and that is, 
their presuming to administer in sacred places the precepts of men instead of 
the ordinances which pertain to the house of God, thereby leading people away 
from the truth. 

We live in a peculiar age of the world. We live in a day when the God 
of heaven is establishing his kingdom to bring to pass his purposes, prepara- 
tory to the millennial reign. We live in a day when we are building temples 
in which a work may be performed for those who have died in ignorance of 
the gospel, that they may also be saved. The gospel plan reaches out to and 
includes all the children of men; it is ample to save all who will bow and live

in obedience to its teachings. If a person has not had an opportunity of re- 
ceiving the gospel in this world, he will have an opportunity of doing so in the 
next, in the place of departed spirits. And the labor of the Elders of Israel 
who die and pass into the Spirit world, clothed upon with the authority of the 
holy priesthood — is to preach to them the principles of the holy gospel, that 
they may live according to God in the spirit and be judged according to men 
in the flesh. But there are ordinances which have to be performed for them 
on the earth. It is for this purpose we are building temples. 

Well, I pray God to help us to live our religion, because in it there is life 
and salvation — I was going to say, in this world, as well as in the world to 
come. And so there is. The principles of the gospel are calculated in their 
nature to elevate mankind in the scale of human existence, and are fraught 
with salvation to men in this time as well as in the time to come. I pray God 
to bless all those who seek to work righteousness in all the earth, and espe- 
ially to remember the household of faith, I pray that he may preserve us from 
stepping into bye and forbidden paths ; that we may be instruments in his 
hands in bringing to pass his purposes and in upholding the principles of 
truth, because there are but few who are disposed to do this. The great 
tendency of the age is to wickedness and corruption, and there are but few 
comparatively who will receive the truth. Let us sustain these principles like 
an unbroken phalanx, standing shoulder to shoulder, that the enemy may not 
make an inroad in our midst. In union there is strength. If therefore we can 
carry out these things unitedly, we will be able to exert a greater power not 
only in the world but before the Lord. 

May God bless us to this end is my prayer in the name of Jesus. Amen.

PRESIDENT JOSEPH YOUNG. 

He recollected the day when the Church consisted of a mere handful of 
people scattered over two or three States of the Union. In traveling to visit 
them an Elder was greeted with the sound, " There goes a Mormon!" Now, 
from Idaho to Arizona, through hundreds of miles> the settlements of the 
Saints extend and the people greet an Elder with joy and friendship. It was 
the work of the Lord and caused astonishment. He was the Author of it, and 
his hand was over all, guiding the destiny of the greatest, and caring even for 
the sparrow. By his Spirit we were guided, and it was to carry the tidings of

his work that we traveled or sent our brethren to the ends of the earth. The 
speaker described the condition of the world in regard to religion, referring to 
the ignorance and fallacies that prevailed. He portrayed the Spirit of Christ 
and its effects upon the human heart, and expressed his full confidence in the 
Lord and the triumph of this work. Exhorted both young and old to plant 
within their hearts a reservoir of truth, and to live so as to know that God 
lives, and that they were accepted of him. Whenever Christian sects had en- 
joyed a portion of the spirit of truth, and rejected this Gospel when it came to 
them, they had lost the measure of the spirit previously bestowed. Those 
who had accepted this work received the power of God and a testimony of the 
truth and lost the fear of death. He bore testimony that the time was near 
when God would shake the earth and all things would tremble, and none but 
the righteous could stand. He wanted to know that his brethren and sisters 
were taking a course that was pleasing in the sight of God, staying themselves 
on the promises of God, training their children — the hope of Israel — in the 
fear of the Lord, so that when the terrible things predicted by the Savior and 
the prophets take place before their eyes, they may be on the watch tower and 
prepared for every emergency. 

ELDER A. O. SMOOT 

Expressed his pleasure at the instructions that had been imparted during 
these meetings. Referring to the sharp reproofs administered in the forenoon 
to some of the Latter-day "Mormons," it occurred to him that there were 
others at fault besides the drinkers and swearers. He asked himself where 
were the priests and teachers when these evils were taking place. If the 
teachers were aware of these things, had they discharged their duty towards 
the transgressors ? If they had done this, and failing to work a reformation, 
had they reported those cases to the Bishops? If so, they had done well, and 
the fault would lay with the Bishop, unless he attended to these evil doers. He 
would ask, why not apply the remedy? Let the erring brother who would not 
reform go in peace and no longer be held in fellowship to spread the evil ex- 
ample. He thought perhaps some of the officers slept upon their rights and 
duties, and neglected the injunctions of the revelations concerning these mat- 
ters. If we allowed these evils to exist, their influence would be demoraliz- 
ing. All are subject to weaknesses, but when we are once overcome thereby, 
it should prove a warning, and we should take care not to be ever again over- 
taken in a similar way. In the course of forty years' experience he had seen 
men holding official position in the priesthood committing the evils spoken of, 
and their faults had been let slip. Why were these cases not alluded to ? Why 
was not the inside of the platter cleaned? There was a fault somewhere; he 
would leave others to say where it was. God had commenced to establish his 
kingdom on the earth, and had so organized his priesthood that these irregu- 
larities could be checked and wickedness purged out. The speaker bore testi- 
mony that this was the kingnom that Daniel saw] in spite of their imperfec- 
tions, this was the people whom the Lord cherished ; this was the priesthood 
that would regulate all things according to the heavenly pattern; and many 
before him in the congregation were destined to be priests and kings unto the 
Most High God. He had nought but blessings in his heart for the faithful,

and he besought the Lord to preserve them from the evils that predominate in 
the world, enable them to magnify their calling, that Israel might triumph and 
the enemy be placed beneath their feet. 

ELDER JOHN" VAN COTT 

Referred to the prophesies concerning the redemption of the remnants of 
Jacob, and rejoiced to hear of the work which was being accomplished among 
them. While Elder Orson Pratt was speaking, he remembered that he (the 
speaker), when a boy of sixteen, had the privilege of witnessing the baptism 
of Elder Pratt, and was the only member of the Church now living who wit- 
nessed it. It was forty-nine years ago last September. It was some years" 
after that he himself was baptized, but at that time he received a witness of 
the truth, and it never left him wherever he went. If it were not for that tes- 
timony he would not be here this day. It was a similar witness that had in- 
duced the Saints from every part of the earth to gather to these mountains. 
It was time that we should become united and prepared for those important 
events predicted which were near at hand. We should refrain from evil, ob- 
tain the power to discern the signs of the times and of the coming of the Son 
of Man, cultivate the spirit of meekness, forbearance and long suffering, and 
seek to God for wisdom that we might be prepared for the great change that is 
to come on the earth.

The joy that from thy presence springs." 

ELDER ORSON" PRATT. 

O God, the Eternal Father of Heaven and of earth, we thy children, thy 
sons and daughters, have assembled ourselves together on this the 6th day of 
April — the day appointed and set apart for the General Conference of thy 
Saints from year to year — we have assembled in this large and commodious 
Tabernacle, for the purpose of commemorating this day, and of hearing the 
words that may be spoken from this stand, and also of giving in our votes and 
our voices unitedly in relation to all business matters that pertain to the 
Church of God here on the earth that may be transacted on this occasion. 

We thank thee, Holy Father, that we have been permitted to receive the 
tulness of the everlasting Gospel revealed anew in this great last dispensation 
of the fulness of times. We thank thee that thou hast organized thy Church 
and established the kingdom that was spoken of by Daniel the prophet, and 
other holy men that lived in ancient times, in fulfilment of their words, and 



FIFTIETH ANNUAL CONFERENCE. 



45 



that it has been organized to stand forever, never more to be destroyed or 
given into the hands of other people. 

And we thank thee, Holy Father, that in the midst of all the persecutions 
and difficulties we have encountered during the fifty years now being brought 
to a close, that thou hast sustained us, that thou hast not utterly cast us off, 
that thou hast not suffered us to become victims to our enemies and to those 
that have persecuted us ; but that thou hast sustained thy Saints, and brought 
them into these mountain valleys, and planted them in the midst of the fast- 
nesses of these everlasting hills, and spread them forth upon the right and 
upon the left, until we have become a great and a numerous people. 

We thank thee for the great gathering which thou hast commanded and 
inaugurated in this dispensation — the gathering of thine elect, the gathering of 
the Saints of the Most High — that we have been permitted to come from all 
the various nations wherever the Gospel has been preached and churches 
raised up, and establish ourselves in these mountain vales. 

We thank thee, O Lord, for all thy peculiar care and thy great mercies 
that have been extended to this people. Notwithstanding our many imper- 
fections, our many follies and sins, thine eyes have been upon us for good. 
Thou hast raised us up; thou hast strengthened our hands; thou hast encour- 
aged us in our work; thou hast visited us by the manifestations of thy Spirit; 
thou hast given revelations from time to time to strengthen thy servants and 
encourage thy Saints. And we thank thee for all these blessings in the name 
of thy beloved Son. And as the fiftieth year since the organization of thy 
Church is now about drawing to a close, we pray that thy peculiar blessings 
may continue to rest upon thy people, and that we may be able to esteem the 
past year since our General Conference as a year of jubilee to the Latter-day 
Saints. And we pray that as the close of this year of jubilee will come to an 
end this day, notwithstanding the close thereof, that we may, in all our future 
years, humble ourselves before the Lord our God and keep thy command- 
ments blameless, and walk in all thy ordinances and the institutions of thy 
kingdom, and serve the Lord our God, and be united more perfectly according 
to the law which thou hast given concerning the union of thy people. 

Bless, we humbly pray, thy servant Brother Taylor. Thou hast raised 
him up by thy power, and placed him in a high and important position in thy 
Church, to preside, in connection with his brethren, the Apostles, over the 
affairs of this great latter-day Kingdom. We pray that thou wilt inspire him 
with great and important knowledge and information for the welfare and hap- 
piness and benefit of the Saints over whom he presides. Bless him abun- 
dantly with the spirit of revelation ; bless him with the visions of eternity; 
bless him with knowledge that comes down from heaven ; bless him with the 
discernment of thy spirit; bless him in all things, and qualify him for the im- 
portant and high position in this thy Church and thy Kngdom, in this thine 
earth. 

Bless his brethren, the Apostles ; fill them with the Holy Ghost, inspire 
their hearts . from on high, and give unto them the spirit of counsel and wis- 
dom, that they may impart unto these thy people that which shall benefit them 
and build them up in their most holy faith, Bless all the Presidents of the 
Stakes of Zion and their Counselors, and also the Bishops, and also the vari-

ous wards in every Stake. Bless them with inspiration, with the knowledge 
of God, with an understanding of their several duties and callings ; and may 
thy servants, from the highest to the least, in all the various councils of the 
priesthood, be inspired from on high, and thus be able to carry out the great 
purposes which thou hast intended concerning the everlasting priesthood again 
sent down from heaven and conferred upon man. 

We pray, O Lord, that the work of the gathering of thy Saints may con- 
tinue, that thine Israel may be gathered from all nations and peoples under the 
whole heavens, to dwell in these mountain valleys, and become a great people, 
that the borders of Zion may be stretched out, and the cords of Zion be 
strengthened, and thy people be prepared with one heart and one mind for 
that great redemption which thou hast promised to them in the latter days. 

Let thy blessing, O Lord, be upon this congregation, upon every man, 
every woman, every child and every person that attends whose heart is desir- 
ous of serving the Lord his God. May the spirit of inspiration rest upon 
them all. May the Spirit of the Most High impart peace and consolation to 
all who may be sick and afflicted, that are not permitted to meet with us this 
day — may they find favor in the sight of God, may thine angels be sent forth 
to minister unto them, that they may be comforted, raised up and healed, and 
that the destroyer may be rebuked from the midst of this people in every set- 
tlement. 

O Lord, we ask in the name of Jesus Christ, that during the convention of 
our Conference from day to day until the close thereof, that the Lord our God 
may be in the midst of this people, that thine angels may be round about us, 
that the heavenly hosts may rejoice over us, that the vision of our minds may 
be opened to contemplate the things of God; and and that all who speak may 
speak by the inspiration of thy Spirit, and all be edified together. We ask 
thee, O Lord, to let thy blessing be upon all the missionaries that are sent 
forth into the nations of the earth, that they may go in power, go in strength, 
filled with the Spirit and power of God, filled with courage and holy boldness 
to carry forth among the children of men the glorious Gospel of the Son of 
Man, revealed in these latter days for the benefit of the human family. 

Hear us, O Lord, in these our supplications. Be with us in our delibera- 
tions. Assist us in this Conference, and smile upon us from thy holy habita- 
tion. And when we have fully accomplished the work which thou hast given 
us to do in this probation, may we be prepared to go into thy kingdom, behold 
thy face, and receive that welcome plaudit, " Come, ye blessed of my Father, 
and inherit the kingdom prepared for you from before the foundation of the 
world." These, together with all other blessings which we should pray for, 
we seek for at this time, not in our own name, but in the name of the Lord 
Jesus Christ. Amen. 

Choir sang: 

" When earth in bondage long had lain, 

And darkness o'er the nations reigned. " 
President John Taylor announced that important business would be 
transacted to-morrow, in which the Salt Lake, Utah, Davis and Weber Stakes, 
were particularly interested, and he wished the presidents of these Stakes and 
as many others as possible, to be present.

ELDER FRANKLIN D. RICHARDS. 

It is very pleasing to find that we have so peaceful and favorable an op- 
portunity, in every general respect, of meeting together on this the fiftieth an- 
niversary of the organization of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints upon the earth in this the last dispensation. Let us endeavor to calm 
our minds, call in the wandering thoughts and exercise our faith, that we may 
receive an abundant measure of the Holy Spirit to rest upon us; for if we 
seek it I am sure the Lord will be greatly pleased to bestow it upon us during 
this Conference. When we contemplate, in the light of history, what fifty 
years have done towards bringing forward the work of the Lord in the earth, 
and of disseminating a knowledge of the principles of the Gospel which he 
has revealed, .and observe the results that these labors and efforts have ac- 
complished toward building up the Kingdom of God, we have reason, if we 
can only sense it, to feel that he has done great things for his people, whereof 
we ought to be very glad. Indeed, to contemplate it in its various bearings, 
and the relationship which this work sustains to the whole human family and 
to the spirits departed, it is indeed so wonderful that we might exclaim, like 
one of old, "What hath God wrought! " 

As this is our jubilee year, let us, as Israel did in ancient times, look back 
and recount our doings, review our condition and surroundings. On every 
fiftieth year they redeemed their brethren that were in bondage, the homestead 
that had been pledged for the necessaries of life; and they reviewed their 
business transactions of previous years, that they might place everything right 
between themselves and before the Lord. Even the strangers that were 
among them were remembered, for, saith the Lord, " Thou shalt neither vex a 
stranger, nor oppress him: for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt." Let 
us seek for the spirit of jubilee as designed of God, and as shall be best, most 
happily and profitably entertained by man. For, indeed, if fifty years have 
brought to pass the creation and existence of a Territory with over a hundred 
thousand of our people in it, what shall the next fifty years produce by the 
blessing of the Most High upon the exertions yet to be made, if we shall but 
abide in his favor, and thus inherit his multiplied blessings ! We are not apt 
to realize the achievements of the past, when we but consider the period of a 
day, a week, or even a year. If we watch the hands on a clock we scarcely 
discern that they move; but if we look once in an hour, we note the lapse of 
time and observe the events that have occurred during that hour. So let us 
contemplate upon the dial of time a few of the events that have transpired 
with us as a community, and recount with thanksgiving and praise some of 
those things which God has done for the deliverancs of his people. 

History informs us that when the Church in Missouri was in straitened 
circumstances, being sorely distressed, and the enemies of God's people 
camped round about ; at the time appointed for the onset, the Lord sent thun- 
ders, lightnings, rain, hail and tempests, with such a destructive flood, that 
the mob found enough to do to save their own lives and attend to the safety of 
their families; several of them did perish. This was in the vicinity of Fishing 
River in 1834. 

It will be remembered by those who knew the Prophet Joseph, that he was 
worried as a lamb is worried by the wolves ; that he scarcely knew rest or

peace because of the wicked, who sought him continually for their prey. The 
Lord raised up a man who was a judge in the land, whose name was Stephen 
A. Douglas. He favored this people in that he gave to them even and fair- 
handed justice in his court, so that they might enjoy, in some small degree, 
the rights, privileges, liberties and powers guaranteed to them by the Constitu- 
tion and laws of their country. This fair and honorable administration of 
justice in behalf of the Prophet and some of his friends, won for him the re- 
spect of the Saints and the favor of the Lord, insomuch that Joseph told him, 
if he would continue to protect the rights of this people, he should go on to 
greatness and power and attain to his utmost ambition in righteousness before 
the Lord. He became a Senator in Congress, and finally a candidate for the 
Presidency; and with the goal of his hopes fairly in view, like the dog in the 
fable, who, while crossing the stream with a piece of meat in his mouth, saw 
the shadow of it in the water, and grasping at it, dropped the substance, so 
did he; in the political crusades against us he declared himself in favor of 
putting the knife into the loathsome ulcer of " Mormonism," and cutting it out 
of the side of the body politic. And what became of him? He went to the 
Convention in Carolina, and there his party split and he failed to get the nomi- 
nation. Under this disappointment his light grew dim, and a short period of 
Senatorial labor ended his mortal career. Whereas, if he had persevered in 
maintaining the right, he might have gone on to the fulfilment of Joseph's 
prophesy, reaching the acme of his ambition, and made for himself in that 
position a name that would have graced and honored the pages of history for 
all time to come. 

Let us look a little farther, and see what God has done for us in some 
other instances. About the time when we were considered no longer fit to 
have place among mankind in the States, when the people around had deter- 
mined that we must go hence, and when we had laid our course for the moun- 
tains, who should rise up and, acting in the interest of Government, impose 
upon us a most extraordinary and destructive measure, seeking to encompass 
our destruction in the wilderness, but the celebrted Senator, Thomas H. Ben- 
toh, who had acquired the cognomen of " Old Bullion." This was accom- 
plished by a requisition on our President, Brigham Young, demanding that 
five hundred of our young men should be called out of our camps to go to war 
to help to make the conquest of Mexico. Did we refuse compliance? Not at 
all ; but, on the contrary, in the midst of the most adverse, destitute and trying 
circumstances, it was submitted to; and the full complement of our young 
men went forth and did honor to the arms of the nation, and God blessed them 
and preserved them, that not one of them fell by the hands of a deadly foe. 
But what became of the Senator who, in the wickedness of his heart, did this? 
I will not say that God took him away because of his injustice to us, but he 
was soon after afflicted with a cancer in his inner parts, which caused his 
death. 

You remember what was called the Buchanan War— the speculators' war ? 
or war on the Treasury— when a detail of picked troops, comprising the flower 
of the United States army, came out to fight the "Mormons." But the 
Prophet told them to stop at Fort Bridger, and they stopped there until their 
ardor cooled, being blockaded in the snow, and having to consume some of

their mules for food, while we herded their cattle for them. Nor did they 
move the following season until the President of the United States sent out 
his commissioners to negotiate with President Young, when they were allowed 
to pass quietly through our city and go to Camp Floyd. Do we forget these 
things? Or do we remember that the forest of polished bayonets which glis- 
tened in the sunlight, looking terrible indeed, became as harmless as the trees 
that grow, and afterwards, when they broke camp, helped to furnish us with 
steel and iron and other articles which we then greatly needed. These are 
some of the Lord's doings. We should not and cannot overlook nor forget them. 

Who does not remember the deadly strife that ensued in the United States, 
when father and son went to war against each other, when the armies of the 
North and South met each other in mortal combat? Through this terrible or- 
deal we were here in these mountains safe and secure ; we did not have to 
take part in the terrible conflict, nor to bleed upon the battlefield. Has not the 
Lord been very kind to us, even while he has permitted the wicked to afflict 
and chastise us? There are other things I wish to call your attention to, 
which loom up before me. 

Alter we came here and had, by the wisdom and counsel of God, estab- 
lished ourselves — not by roaming the hills hunting for minerals and will-o'- 
the-wisps, but by making homes, gardens and orchards, beautifying and tilling 
the land, and by making families comfortable and our homes desirable, officers 
were sent here by the Government to rule over us; and they, in the evil spirit 
of their hearts, began to persecute and afflict us. You remember that a gov- 
ernor was sent here by the name of Shaeffer, and that the great distinguishing 
act of his official career was the issuing of a proclamation forbidding this peo- 
ple to bear arms and commanding them to refrain from making any military 
display in their celebration of the Fourth of July, and that, too, when the Con- 
stitution of our country distinctly says that "the right of the people to keep and 
bear arms shall not be infringed," and we, in an Indian country! But what 
became of this unrighteous man? He had hardly seen the order carried 
into execution, when his bones were carried away to be buried with those of 
his kindred somewhere in the States. 

Who does not remember Judge McKean, who came here with power from 
Government and with the authority of the Methodist Church, as a missionary 
jurist, to oppress and humble us before the nation and before the world? Who 
of us can forget the morning when he ignominiously dragged President Young 
to his Court over a stable, to answer certain illegal indictments and false 
charges? During about a year and a half of official career, this man, by per- 
verting and misapplying the laws, and by utterly disregarding the well estab- 
lished principles of jurisprudence, procured convictions of some of our citi- 
zens through illegal juries. But a single case carried up to the Supreme 
Court at Washington reversed his decisions, invalidated the greater part of his 
official acts, and made President Young a free man, after having been confined 
a prisoner in his own house for several months. Where is this judicial lumi- 
nary now? "This day thy soul shall be required of thee," was written upon 
the wall of his habitation, and he has gone to his account; but his words to 
President Young are still fresh in our minds—" While the case at bar is called 
'The People versus Brigham Young,' its other and real title is, 'Federal Au-

FIFTIETH ANNUAL CONFERENCE. 



thority versus Polygamic Theocracy." Also his tantalization of Thomas 
Hawkins, when he had him by maladministration in his power: " I am sorry 
for you, very sorry; you may not think so now, but I shall try to make you 
think so by the mercy which I shall show you " — which mercy consisted of a 
sentence of five hundred dollars fine and three years imprisonment. 

When we look back upon these things, which give us, however, but a faint 
glimmer of the wisdom of God in delivering and preserving his people; with- 
out arrogating anything to ourselves, we may truly say, " God has glorified 
himself and exalted his people." Have we not reason for thankfulness, and 
can we help feeling that he has acknowledged, at least, in the dispensations 
of his providence to us, that this is his work and that we are the children of 
his covenant? We are to-day in the hands of God, our Father, whose mer- 
cies are abundant, and whose blessings are multiplied upon us. Let us then 
take into consideration the goodness of our God, his preservation of us in 
hours of trial and danger, and in every circumstance and condition of life ; for 
we have individually as well as collectively the greatest reason to praise his 
holy name for the grace we have received at his hands, in sustaining us and 
helping us to thus far overcome. The Lord is having a people which is a tried 
people. Let us rejoice that we are in the crucible and counted worthy to be 
tried. But, my brethren, let us rise up in holy boldness against, and put away 
far from us, the accursed things which the wicked have brought among us, 
and which to-day are fostered and encouraged by them in our midst; even as 
drunkenness, whoredom, stealing, and kindred vices, that are fast becoming 
popular among many of our youth, whose hearts are sought thereby to be 
drawn away from the Lord by corruption and wickedness. It is time the Elders 
of Israel were putting on the sword of the Spirit, to do battle against these things. 

The Lord has said that Zion shall be redeemed by judgment, but her con- 
verts by righteousness. He has strictly enjoined upon us that we shall not go 
to war with our enemies. "Judgment is mine," saith the Lord, "and I will 
repay." Then we have not time nor occasion to go to war, nor to study the 
means of destruction and death; on the contrary, we are called upon, and it is 
our pleasing duty, to study and develop the elements of life — the spirit of faith 
in the everlasting Gospel. What better can we do, in this our year of jubilee, 
in token of our gratitude to God for the abundance of his favors bestowed 
upon us, than to do good to each other, and to make glad the hearts of the 
poor in Israel? The authorities of the Church are thinking of doing some- 
thing by way of aiding such as are needy. The officers of the Perpetual Emi- 
grating Fund Company calcucate to relieve in part the worthy poor, who are 
owing for their emigration ; and as President Taylor suggested in public on 
Sunday, let us all do something to aid the poor and make the hearts of the 
Saints rejoice, and see that no one is allowed to suffer. This same charitable 
feeling should extend through all our Co-operative Institutions; our rich 
brethren merchants who have got debts owing to them by the worthy poor, 
who are struggling with adversity in the world for a subsistence, let them get 
out their accounts and send them receipted, either in full or in part, to their 
debtors, as the case may be, with a note of forgiveness, telling them to lift up 
their heads and rejoice, and the Lord will bless them for it. Let the rich men 
in our Territory, who have been blessed to accumulate means, and who hold

notes drawing interest against their poor brethren, look over their papers, and 
where they find a note given by their poor but worthy brother, who has per- 
haps mortgaged his home and is in danger of being sold out, let them forgive 
the debt, and thus our rich brethren may help fulfil the prophecy that the poor 
shall rejoice in the Holy One of Israel. There are those who have borrowed 
money, and whose homes stand pledged for the payment thereof, who have in- 
curred debt through misfortune, or hard times, or perhaps through sickness, 
and who deserve relief — I would say to all the brethren who may be the cred- 
itors of such persons, go to and make yourselves their benefactors, and estab- 
lish the principle in the hearts of God's people — "Make to yourselves friends 
with the mammon of unrighteousness, riiat, when ye fail, they may receive 
you into'everlasting habitations." For your riches may take the wings of the 
morning, when you least expect it, and fly away; or they may burn up and you 
be left destitute. 

And if the people of the Territory everywhere, who have means, and who 
have poor relations or friends in the old country— for there are families scat- 
tered throughout those lands who perhaps never have a chance to attend a 
meeting of the Saints — would wake up and send for a ship-load or two of 
them, not those who are able to bring themselves, but the poor, whose hearts 
beat low and whose hopes have become forlorn, and who despair of ever get- 
ting out on their own account. This too would be a fitting and proper thing to 
do on this rare occasion, and one that would bring blessing and joy to all con- 
cerned; and thus the glad tidings of our jubilee would reach to those afar off, 
and they would be made to know that there is a people on the earth who re- 
member their God, their covenants and their poor afflicted brethren. 

There is a great deal that might be said on this subject, but I will leave it 
to be said by my brethren who are yet to speak. I perhaps ought to say that 
the object of granting relief to those indebted to the P. E. Fund Company, is 
not to benefit those who are able to pay, but those who are poor, unfortunate 
or suffering, having no prospect of being able to pay, that such of our brethren 
may be stimulated to fresh courage and to go on in the progress of the Gospel 
of life and salvation. # 

Will not efforts like these awaken a sense of duty in those who are in 
need of and receive our mercy, and thus make all hearts glad? And will not 
our Father in Heaven and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the angels, and the 
spirits of the just awaiting us, will they not all join with us in thanksgiving 
and praise to Jehovah for even the little good we are trying to do on the earth? 

That the Lord may pour out the spirit of jubilee upon us, and help us to 
continue with gratifying results the labors of the cause of truth on the earth, 
is my earnest prayer and desire, in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

Elder L. John Nuttall read the statistical report of the various Stakes. 
President Taylor said, as the house was rather cold the meeting would 
not be prolonged. 

The choir sang the anthem, 

"Who is like unto thee, O Lord." 

Adjourned till 2 p.m. 

Dismissed with prayer by Elder Lorenzo Snow.

Choir sang, 

"From Greenland's icy mountains, 
From India's coral strand." 

Prayer by Elder Albert Carrington. 
Choir sang, 

' ' Ye Gentile nations cease your strife 
And listen to the words of life," 

Elder L. John Nuttall read the financial report of the Trustee in Trust, 
containing a detailed statement of the receipts and disbursements during the 
year 1879. 

President Taylor stated that vouchers were on hand for all the accounts 
read, and thought that the Auditing Committee should examine them. 

Elder Lorenzo Snow moved that we accept the report, and that it be re- 
ferred, with the accompanying documents, to the Auditing Committee. The 
motion was seconded and carried unanimously. 

The financial report of the Logan Temple was then read, also of the 
Manti Temple. 

An exhibit of the receipts and expenditures of the Perpetual Emigration 
Fund for the past six months, was presented. 

ELDEE EBASTUS SNOW. 

I am somewhat weary from journeying, hut I will try, if the congregation 
will be as quiet as possible, to make myself heard the short time I may speak. 

I congratulate myself, my brethren and the people generally on this au- 
picious occasion — the end of our fiftieth year in our organized capacity, as the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints; and on the general outlook, the 
prosperity that is attending our efforts, the general peace that prevails through- 
out our land, the goodly degree of unanimity and fellowship and' brotherly love 
existing among the people as shown in the general good feeling that is mani- 
fest in all the quarterly conferences and Stakes of Zion, as well as in the inter- 
est shown by the people at large on this occasion. The financial reports which 
we have heard, coupled with the general reports of school superintendents 
and other public functionaries to the Legislative Assembly during the last 
winter, tend to show the general advancement and progress of the people in 
all that is calculated to elevate and exalt a nation. The great number of meet- 
inghouses and schoolhouses, and pupils in attendance in our district schools, 
and also in the more advanced schools of the Territory, are very gratifying ; 
and the general health of the people at large, and all sources of gratitude and 
thanksgiving, calling forth our devotion to our Father, the Creator. 

The discourse this morning by Elder F. D. Richards foreshadows what 
was anciently figured by the year of jubilee, and as understood and practised 
by ancient Israel, namely, the severing of the bonds with which the people 
were bound — the breaking of the yoke from off their necks, and setting the 
captive free, an*d the proclaiming of liberty throughout the land unto all the

inhabitants thereof. The general recommendation to exercise mercy and for- 
giveness of sins, and release the poor of indebtedness, extending relief to the 
needy, and making the hearts of all the people glad; it is to be hoped that in 
this good work of liberality, of kindness, of charity, of love — love unto God 
and unto all his children may make itself manifest more abundantly among all 
Israel than it has in times past — notwithstanding the Latter-day Saints have 
been proverbial for their self-abnegation, for their devotion to each others 
interest, for their brotherly kindness and charity, for their ministering unto the 
poor, and gathering their poor brethren, and uniting and co-operating together 
and in promoting each others general interest and welfare — we hope to see a 
renewal of our efforts in this direction ; and that from this time we may date 
more rapid progress, renewed efforts, more earnest devotion to the sacred 
principles of our holy religion, to this spirit of oneness and unity which we 
look for and pray for, and which has been prophesied of by all the holy proph- 
ets, that is necessary to prepare a people for the coming of the Son of Man to 
reign in the midst of his people. And we might offer a few words by way of 
reminder and exhortation unto those that have been delinquent in their duty 
in times past, and in their efforts to live up to their privileges and to exemplify 
the principles of the Gospel in their lives and conduct. When will they have 
a better time than the present, and what period of the history of the Church 
of Christ so suitable as the present — the commencement of the second half 
century of our' existence — as the period to date their reformation of life and 
the allaying of all that lethargy and apathy which has prevailed? 

Touching our P. E. Fund indebtedness, the books of the company show 
a vast amount due from those who have been emigrated during the last thirty 
years in which we have been laboring to gather the poor from distant lands 
and countries. I am informed by those better acquainted with this matter 
than I am, that the amount of indebtedness amounts to sixteen hundred thou- 
sand dollars. With all this vast amount due from the people all over the land, 
we find their operation during the last six months limited to about ten thou- 
sand dollars; when in reality the operations of this company in the gathering 
of the poor ought and might, if all did their duty, reach a hundred thousand 
dollars every year, extending reTief to many thousands of those who are pray- 
ing for deliverance in the downtrodden countries of Europe and elsewhere 
where the poor have the Gospel preached unto them. For as it was in the 
days of the Savior, so it is now — the poor have the Gospel preached unto 
them. This fact Jesus announced to the disciples of John who were sent by 
John while he was in prison, to the Savior to inquire about the rumors which 
he had heard of him. The Savior was preaching and baptizing, performing 
miracles, etc., and as John was in prison he could hear nothing but general 
rumor, and therefore he sent his disciples to seek this Jesus of Nazareth, who 
was making such a stir in the land, and to ascertain who he was and what his 
message to the people was. And in answer to their inquiry — "Art thou he 
that should come, or do we look for another?" Jesus answered and said unto 
them, " Go and show John again those things which ye do hear and see: the 
blind receive their sight, etc., and the poor have the Gospel preached unto 
them." By this John was to know who he was and what his message was. 
The same answer is before the world to-day in the message of the Latter-day 



54 



FIFTI15TH ANNUAL CONFERENCE. 



Saints and their labors throughout the earth, wherever this Gospel has been 
sent and preached by the Elders of this Church. The sick have been healed 
by the prayer of faith and the laying on of hands, and devils have been cast 
out, and the poor have the Gospel preached unto them, and many of the poor 
have been gathered. And very many of these have shown themselves worthy 
— they have paid their indebtedness as fast as they could ; others have been 
w illing and desirous of doing so, but adverse circumstances have prevented 
them; while another class have been ungrateful, and have not sufficiently re- 
alized the rock from whence they were hewn, nor the pit from which they were 
digged, allowing years to pass without an effort, or even a righteous desire, to 
pay this just debt, thereby preventing the means thus due to go on its errand 
of mercy to bring other poor. 

Now, it is contemplated that this year of jubilee shall be made a year of 
release and comfort to those who are indebted to the Fund, who have striven 
to do their duty and discharged it as far as able to do so, but whose circum- 
stances have been adverse, preventing them from doing as their hearts listed. 
It is proposed that such be set free ; and while we feel it is a privilege the Lord 
has given us of speaking comforting words to such, and of loosing the bands 
from their feet and set them free, we feel, on the other hand, it to be equally 
our duty to remind those who have been negligent, that if they also would en- 
joy the riches of Christ and the forgiveness of their sins, they must bestir 
themselves and come up to every duty, and cease from all hard speeches and 
from worldly-mindedness and pride, and from a desire to get rich before they 
are just, and to accumulate wealth before they have signified their gratitude for 
past favors. 

We might also refer to the reports of tithing, but from the observations of 
the Bishops and others, perhaps I might be permitted to repeat their observa- 
tions, founded on the experince of years, in receiving and disbursing the tithes 
of the people, and the general accounts from the various wards and stakes and 
settlements throughout the land; and in repeating their observations I might 
add my own testimony and experience and observation, formed by the experi- 
ence of many years in ministering among the people, examining reports and 
accounts, and receipts and disbursements, and lists of those who do tithe 
themselves and those who do not; and the general expression of the presiding 
Bishop and his Counselors and men of observation and experience ; bears out 
a declaration once made by President Young in his lifetime, in effect, that 
there was not more than halt an honest tithing paid in the midst of Israel; 
and that if an honest tithing ware paid by the people generally, we should 
have an abundance to build our temples, our meel^ighouses, to provide for the 
poor and relieve the needy, to gather the Saints, and accomplish what may be 
necessary for the benefit of all the people, without calling on them for extra 
donations. But from the Logan and Manti Temple reports we learn that about 
$170,000 has been expended upon these temples within the last year; while 
about twenty-eight to thirty thousand of this sum has been appropriated out of 
the tithing, the balance being the free-will offering of the people. We have 
no report of what has been done in the way of donations in this temple district, 
but the presumption is that while $140,000 of the tithing has been expended 
upon the Salt Laki Temple, that perhaps an equal sum has been donated; but

of this we are not informed, and not being myself in a position to be able to 
speak of it, of course I will leave it to my brethren residing here in this temple 
district to speak on this matter, as it might be gratifying to the people of the 
Salt Lake Temple district to be represented in our General Conference, and 
that it might also be known what they are doing in the way of free-will offer- 
ings in the building of this temple, as well as their brethren in other temple 
districts. But I repeat what President Young said, and which I believe to be 
true, that if an honest tithing were paid by all the people, according to their 
professions, these extra offerings and donations would be unnecessary. You 
perceive from the financial reports that the aggregated sum of the tithes and 
offerings seem somewhat large, yet considering the various sources of dis- 
bursement, as well as the character of the property received — being all kinds 
of produce and labor, and comparatively but little money — that the disburse- 
ments in the various directions have been sufficient to exceed and consume 
the income together with the offerings. And with some it would seem as 
though they w,ere not making progress as fast as the people could desire or 
wish ; but if we are not in our public improvements moving as fast as the peo- 
ple could wish, you will perceive it is not the fault of the Bishops and others 
who have the direction of these financial affairs. Nor does there appear to be 
a wastefulness or unreasonable expenditure in the receiving and disbursing, as 
-a rule; though there may be in isolated cases, which do not come, perhaps, 
sufficiently manifest to be noticed in order to be corrected; but as fast as any 
thing of the kind does appear it receives proper attention. And the people 
have reason to feel a measure of satisfaction and congratulation in the great 
amount of good that is being accomplished from these small revenues gath- 
ered from this vast people in all parts of the land, and extending as we are 
new settlements on the east and north and south and southeast, and in various 
directions, occupying new regions of country and bringing into use fertile fields, 
preparing homes for the Saints, and thus fulfilling the words of the Prophet 
Isaiah — "Enlarge the place of thy tent, and let them stretch forth the curtains 
of thine habitations; spare not, lengthen thy cords and strengthen thy stakes; 
for thou shalt break forth on the right hand and on the left; and thy seed shall 
inherit the Gentiles, and make the desolate cities to be inhabited." That our 
nation should be somewhat jealous of us is not to be wondered at from the 
very nature and character of our institutions and thrift of our people. The 
same jealousy manifested itself in Missouri in early days, when the Saints were 
broken up and driven from that place because of their thrift, their provoking 
industry, the extent of their mechanism, the skill of their artisans, and the 
thrift that was manifested in turning the desert into a fruitful field, making a 
great contrast in northwest Missouri between the settlements of the Latter- 
day Saints and other regions of Missouri at those early times. Not that the 
Latter-day Saints in these mountains by anything they or their institutions are 
doing are menacing the general interests of the country, only they are provok- 
ing many people upon this American Continent who seem rather inclined to 
dwindle and live in voluptuousness and ease, and spend their vast incomes in 
gratifying the pride of life and lusts of the flesh, ostentation and show; while 
the Latter-day Saints seek more enduring wealth — and fill the land with an en- 
terprising population ; and are content to provide the common necessaries of 



56

life— essential elements to the growth and development of a people— and the 
training and education of their spirits. By our statistical reports we find that 
nearly one-third of the population are under eight years of age ; while another 
third are between eight and twenty years— children who have been born and 
grown up in these mountains, and are being educated in our common schools. 
While the reports of our Sabbath Schools show in the neighborhood of 
40,000 children belonging to our people who are enrolled in the Sabbath 
Schools — more than twice the number of all the other Territories combined, 
with some of the minor States thrown into the bargain. 

Our nation is inclined to find fault with us because of our marriage rela- 
tions — not that they have reason to believe that the people of Utah are not 
virtuous — not that licentiousness or looseness of morals prevail, or that there 
is a disregard of sexual purity — not that wives and mothers are not honored 
as they deserve to be — not that children are not beloved and cared for and 
trained and educated; but that there is a disposition under the teachings and 
sanction of our holy religion to amplify the doctrine (which was also sanctioned 
by the fathers and practised in ancient Israel, and nowhere disallowed in the 
Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ) that every healthful, virtuous woman desir- 
ing to fulfil the law of God, ought to have the opportunity of becoming an 
honored wife and mother, and to partake of those conjugal blessings and en- 
joyments that are interwoven with our nature and our being, and thus fill the 
object and purposes of our creation. We believe that where this opportunity 
is not afforded, where the institutions of the State, or the tenets of religion, or 
the morals of the sterner sex forbid or interfere with this privilege, there is 
something wrong. It is a state of Society that is unnatural, and ought not to 
exist; that a remedy ought to be sought for and found. Some ancient nations 
recognized the correctness of this principle and attempted to compel the male 
population to marry, while some of the ancient Gentile nations, under the 
leadership of Rome, sought to establish monogamy; they also sought to 
remedy the evils to which I have referred, by compelling the males to marry. 
If they could enforce such a law, I should think it imperative upon any State 
that forbids polygamy. A large-souled man who cherishes a proper respect 
for his mother and sister, and for every other man's mother and sister, and is 
disposed to marry and deal justly with more than one woman, he ought to have 
the privilege so lo do; but if the State forbids him so to do, then the State 
ought to compel delinquent bachelors to wake up and do their duty. Presi- 
dent Young in his lifetime often made this banter to the United States ; if you 
will not remove your narrow-contracted laws, be consistent, and compel the 
bachelors to do their duty, and compel every man to confine himself to his own 
wife and let other men's wives and daughters alone, then we will wait and see 
the result, and shall be satisfied if the women shall have no longer cause to 
complain. But while the tens of thousands of the daughters of Eve are left 
in our large mercantile towns and elsewhere to fall a prey to the brutish lusts 
of wicked men, and afterwards to be cast off to die, rotten with disease, in 
gutters and in dens and hovels, and in this state to be swept away from earth 
—we say while tens of thousands of the fair daughters of Eve are thus victim- 
ized and made to suffer from this unnatural state of things in modern Christen- 
dom, it seems to us the sheerest hypocrisy for the solons of our nation— backed

by the clergy of the land — to decry the honorable marriage of the Latter-day 
Saints, with the example before them of 40,000 children attending our Sabbath 
Schools — which I repeat is more than those of all the other Territories of the 
United States and half a dozen of the minor States thrown in. 

There is an ancient doctrine which God established in ancient Israel and 
commanded, namely, that the adulterer should be put to death. We ask our- 
selves the question, if it became necessary for God to command by Moses that 
Israel should not suffer the adulterer to live, but that whosoever should be 
caught in the act should first be tried before the elders, and if found guilty the 
elders should declare their sentence and bring them to the gates of the city 
and call upon all the people to pick up stones and join in his execution, that 
by all throwing at the same time no one would have it to say that "Your stone 
killed him," or that no relative could charge his death to any one person, nei- 
ther could the ignominy be fastened upon an executioner, as it is in our day, 
but the whole people signifying their contempt for the transgressor, joined in 
administering the penalty until he died the death of the dog. But the natural 
sequence of the law is — liberty for honorable men of the earth to absorb the 
surplus female element in honorable marriage, though it should be under the 
plural system practised by the patriarchs and prophets of old. And while this 
privilege was extended — so long as there was a surplus of female element to 
be absorbed — the man who tampered with his neighbor's wife or daughter suf- 
fered death. Brother Woodruff related in my hearing a short time since, an 
account of his visit among the village Indians of New Mexico, on the Rio 
Grande, and of a conversation between him and the governor of one of the 
chief villages, numbering some 3,000 souls, who were partially civilized main- 
taining schools and also maintaining purity in their social relations. The gov- 
ernor assured him that they had for many generations kept themselves free 
from mixing with the Castilian blood, and that the death penalty was scrupu- 
lously enforced upon the man guilty of adultery among them. He said the 
railroad was approaching their town, that the whites were crawling upon them, 
and it would be but a short time before they would be overrun with them; and 
that though they boasted of far greater intelligence, greater wealth, and were 
a powerful people, they were given to many crimes, to drunkenness and whore- 
dom, and, he* said, they feared the result of their approach and their "civiliza- 
tion" in their midst; for, he said, if any of them were to take liberties with 
our women, and our men should execute the penalty of the law of our fathers, 
which has been in force among us for centuries, and put to death the guilty 
adventurer, what would be the result, said the old gray-haired patriarch of the 
village? I suppose, said he, they would send their troops upon us and slay us- 
Such are the reflections and such are the rebukes of the chieftain, who is 
called a savage, upon the civilization of the age. 

As a people, we are exceedingly anxious to acquit ourselves as good citizens 
in every department of life, with honor and credit before our nation and the 
world. We look forward to the time when the great tree that has sprung up 
and spread abroad, over-shadowing the land in this rocky mountain region, 
this great people the Latter-day Saints, when their influence will be felt in all 
the land. We are striving, in our weak way, to conduct ourselves and the ris- 
ing generation under our care for the great work in the earth. The bigotry 



58 



FIFTIETH ANNUAL CONFERENCE. 



and the superstition, and the self-righteousness that to-day reign in the breasts 
of the ignorant, will, by and by, begin to break and give way as the Latter-day 
Saints become better known, or when the time comes spoken of by the anci- 
ent prophet, when Zion shall break forth on the right and the left, and she 
shall possess the gates of her enemies. How will that be done? We are 
doing it by purchase — as we appproach the gates of our enemies we buy them 
out, buy out their ranches, their little settlements and towers, and in this way 
will that prophecy be accomplished. And as we spread abroad, the cry will 
be, "Give us room, that we may dwell;" and it is in this sense that we are an 
aggressive people — net aggressive by war, not aggressive by abridging the 
rights of our fellows, but in the sense that we are growing — in the same sense 
as the potato is aggressive when planted in a fruitful field. And this reminds 
me of a remark made by the late Dr. Willard Richards, when, in 1847, we 
came to the top of the Big Mountain and began to descend through the quak- 
en-asps in the black soil, says he, "Brethren, methinks I hear the Irish potato 
crying out, lie over, give me room." Such, indeed, are the Latter-day Saints; 
the cry will be, "Lie over, give me room." We are extending and spreading 
abroad, and we continue to gather our brethren and sisters from distant nations 
and provide for them homes and means of employment; and we are marrying 
and multiplying and endeavoring to encourage the fulfillment of the command- 
ment given to our first parents— multiply and replenish the earth. And when 
I look back to New England — the cradle of American liberty— and see the ma- 
jority of the New England families dwindling — for go where you will among the 
wealth}', the banker, the merchant, the wealthy farmer or the well-to-do me- 
chanic in the more well-to-do portions of the New England States, if you find 
any children at ( all, as a rule it is not more than a son and daughter, or an only 
son or only daughter — two or three children at the most in the majority of 
cases, and they, generally sickly and short-lived. During my last visit to that 
country I often spoke of it and referred to it among my kindred and acquain- 
tances, of whom I have many, that being the land of my nativity, and there- 
fore I may be permitted to speak of the land and home that gave me birth, 
and refer to what I regard its degeneracy. In referring to this state of affairs 
the answer of my old aunt who ranks herself among the aristocracy of the 
land, "Oh," said she, "it has become unpopular to have large families." And 
in looking over the newspapers of New England and those of other Eastern 
States, I was not a little shocked to see the advertisements of abortionist doc- 
tors, male and female, unblushingly put forth before high heaven and in the 
face of civilized humanity — pardon the expression, shall I say non-civilized 
humanity? I should offend the pride of the world; but if the Gods and the 
angels were to speak, they would blush at the term "civilization." And these 
papers containing such advertisements, are scattered throughout the land 
broadcast, read by families, and before the gaze of every woman and every girl, 
as well as every profligate of the land ; and these point out the ways and means 
developed by "Christianity" to prevent the fulfilment of the first great command 
of God to our first parents. The way to destroy the foetus in the womb, to 
produce premature birth and abortion, and lastly, when this fails to secretly 
smother the offspring or cast them into sewers— anything to be relieved from 
being burdened, burdc7ied—Qo& save the mark !— burdened with the offspring,

the spirit that came from heaven, as if it were a burden. What false education 
is this? What false religion is this that has poisoned the human heart, that 
has turned their brain, that has turned all common sense out of the Christian 
world into beastly lust, and that patronizes and sustains these vampires of so- 
ciety, and makes them palatial residences on Broadway and on the Fifth Ave- 
nue of New York? The price of blood. 

These iniquities cry unto heaven, and God will visit them in his own due 
time with judgment upon those who uphold them, and those States that defend 
and protect this wickedness, and at the same time cry out against the institu- 
tions of the Latter-day Saints, and say, crucify! crucify and imprison them, and 
put them to death if necessary. Will the Lord not lend an ear? Will he not 
take congnizance of such doings? And will he not judge between his people 
in the mountains and their accusers and those who rail against them and who 
at the same time are connected either directly or indirectly with the many 
sinks of iniquity that flourish on this so-called Christian land? Shall the Lat- 
ter-day Saints assimilate themselves with these abominations? Shall they too 
give themselves up to whoredoms and lust? Shall they encourage infanticide, 
foeticide and all their kindred evils? Shall we forbid honorable marriage and 
leave the surplus female element a prey to libertines and reap the consequen- 
ces, in the foul and loathsome diseases that taint society and ruin future gener- 
ations? No, God forbid! the heart of every Latter-day Saint, man and woman 
in the land says no. We will pray for our people; we will pray for our na- 
tion, we will pray God to soften their hearts and stay their hand and hold their 
arm, and not permit them to execute their narrow contracted laws which they 
have framed in the days of their bigotry and ignorance, under the traditions of 
their father, and in violation of the great principles on which American liberty 
is founded. We know full well that the old Puritan States of New Eng- 
land and the other commonwealths of America — grew up under the monogamic 
system, and that their hearts have not become sufficiently enlarged to compre- 
hend the final result of this tree of liberty which they planted in the land, they 
consequently retained in their new colonies and the States formed out of them, 
the old Roman system of monogamy that made laws against bigamy. But the 
bigamy which their laws contemplated and which the laws of England contem- 
plated, after which they patterned, was not the plural marriage of the Latter- 
day Saints, regulated as it is under the sanction of religion, its duties and ob- 
ligations, and religiously observed by the people. But their laws against big- 
amy were based upon the principle of fraud, fraud practised by a man or 
woman, who, believing in monogamy, enter into that relationship and then se- 
cretly violate the sacred covenants entered into with each other, and unbe- 
known to each other, contract a marriage with another and clandestinely carry 
it on. The crime in this instance was not in the religious doctrine of plural 
marriage, but in the fraudulent manner in which it is contracted and carried on 
and the violation of their covenants and the law of the land. But the Consti- 
tution of the L'nited States is a broad instrument, framed to suit the growth of 
the country and the expansion of liberal ideas in the land, containing no pro- 
vision looking to the establishing of monogamy as an institution of the com 7 
mon country; there are no provisions in the Constitution requiring or empow- 
ering Congress to enforce such order of society; on the contrary, the princi-

pies of social, civil and religious liberty are engrafted upon it and made insti- 
tutions of our country by that charter of our liberties — I say all these pro- 
visions are so ample in their character that they will admit and protect the 
Mohammedan, the Jew, the patriarch Abraham himself if he were here with 
his wives and concubines, and Jacob and Joseph, and all the ancient patriarchs 
as well as the Khedive, if he were to come here with his wives and people, 
and form colonies in our midst. The true spirit of that glorious Constitution 
of our country as understood by us, is illustrated in the hymn which we so fre- 
quently hear sung, composed by Elder Parley P. Pratt on the occasion of the 
first celebration of the entry of the pioneers into this valley, held on the 24th 
of July, 1848. The first great feast was celebrated, called the harvest feast, 
commemorating the first anniversary of the arrival of the pioneers in this land 
and the following is part of the hymn sung on that occasion : 

"Come, ye Christian sects and pagans, 

Indian, Moslem. Greek and Jew, 
Worshipers of God or Dagon, 

Freedom's banner waves for you." 

These are the sentiments of the Latter-day Saints as to the nature of the 
liberty our fathers fought for, and which we desire to maintain in the land, 
namely, freedom for all people of every land and clime. Nor does it require 
them to leave behind their wives and children and adopt the narrow-contracted, 
bigoted laws of monogamy. It was a New England bigot, Mr. Morrill, of 
Vermont — my native State, disgraced on account of it — who introduced that 
bill known as the anti-polygamy bill of 1862, which was adopted by the solons 
of our nation, under the last priestly influence and sectarian bigotry of the 
land, of which the noble Mr. Lincoln was ashamed. And when the bill was 
enrolled and sent to him, knowing the pressure under which it had passed ; 
and with a war upon his hands, he lacked the moral courage to express his real 
sentiments of disapproval of the bill, but quietly pocketed it, refusing to sign 
it, but allowed it to become law by limitation. If there was any one act in the 
life of Mr. Lincoln in which he will be found faulty and for which he will be 
found wanting when he shall be weighed in the balance, it was for declining 
to express his honest sentiments to the Congress of the United States in dis- 
approval of that bill. And if there is anything in which Presidents and Sen- 
ators, Congressmen and judges will be found wanting before the heavens 
when weighed in the balance, it will be in their future endorsements of that 
bill and their efforts.to enforce it. 

May God have mercy on them and spare them the consequences; and 
may grace abound in Israel, that we may abide in the truth and honor God our 
Father, and at last be found worthy of an exaltation in his kingdom, is my 
prayer, in the name of Jesus. Amen.

ELDER LEVI W. HANCOCK 

Said he was seventy-seven years old to-day, and nearly fifty years ago he 
was baptized after receiving the testimony of the Prophet Joseph, who received 
the word of the Lord and was slain by the professed followers of Him who 
died for his fellow man. He was familiarly acquainted with the Prophet, 
lived with him for three years, worked under his direction; and he was one of 
the most pleasing spirits he had ever been associated with. He then bore 
testimony that this gospel was true; the Book of Mormon was true; the 
Twelve were true; he heard Joseph say that this work could not be built up 
without Twelve Apostles and the Seventies followingin their wake. Their de- 
cisions, if made in righteousness and unity, were as valid as the decision of 
the first presidency in the days of the Prophet, as was declared in the Doctrine 
and Covenants, and if there were no divisions among them their voice would 
be the voice of the Lord, and all Israel should say amen to it. He exhorted 
all the Saints to works of righteousness, and invoked the blessings of God 
upon them. 

PRESIDENT JOHN" TAYLOR. 

As I stated on the opening of the Conference, there were some things of 
considerable importance that we wished to lay before the Saints, and especially 
before the authorities of the Church to-day. We have had in operation for 
quite a length of time, what is known as the " Perpetual Emigration Fund 
Company," and a great many of you that are present have contributed to that 
Fund. And as it is a jubilee year to you — although I suppose the forty-ninth 
year would be the proper jubilee — it is really the fiftieth anniversary of the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. It occurred to me that we ought 
to do something, as they did in former times, to relieve those that are oppressed 
with debt, to assist those that are needy, to break the yoke off those that may 
feel themselves crowded upon, and to make it a time of general rejoicing. 
And as it is a matter in which you are all interested, it is thought proper to lay 
the matter before you, because we have contemplated to release one-half of 
the indebtedness of those who are indebted to the P. E. Fund Company. 
That is one subject. 

There is a variety of other things, which I mentioned to my brethren of the 



62 



FIFTIETH ANNUAL CONFERENCE. 



Twelve, and they all join in the. feeling with a hearty co-operation, all being 
desirous of seeing something of this kind done which will tend to produce 
happiness, joy and comfort, and a feeling of relief among many of our breth- 
ren. 

We wish the brethren who have contributed to this fund, and all the offi- 
cers of this Church, to have a voice in it, because it is our act; and we want 
to make it the act of the whole people, that all may have a voice, which we 
consider they ought to have in all these leading prominent actions wherein 
they are concerned. 

The proposition is to release one-half of the people's indebtedness to the 
Perpetual Emigration Fund Company. I may say, I have also spoken to 
Brother Carrington on this matter, who is the president of this company, and 
learn that it meets his views. I would further state that to the best of my 
knowledge nobody has hitherto been oppressed or crowded on account of this 
indebtedness at all; they have been called upon and requested to meet their 
engagements, which is certainly just; because others were interested in these 
matters besides ourselves, who had a right to expect a return of means appro- 
priated, that they also might be relieved, and partake of the benefits of this 
fund, which was properly named perpetual; that is, many of the poor for 
which the means were subscribed formerly, under the direction of President 
Young, who was the originator of the Perpetual Emigrating Fund Company. 

I have some figures which I will read to you; they will show what has not 
been returned again by those who have been benefited by it. The amount of 
the original indebtedness is $704,000. The interest, extending along for many 
years at 10 per cent, per annum, is some $900,006", which interest, in many in- 
stances, has had to be paid by us. The whole of the amount is $1,604,000. 
That is the amount of the whole indebtedness, principal and interest. 

Now, we propose to forgive those who are poor and that are struggling with 
difficulties in life, who.have not been able to meet their engagements in this mat- 
ter; not half the amount that they are due, but the whole ; and to those who are 
forgiven the debt it will be blotted out ; not partly, but entirely ; and the remainder 
will be left to those to pay who are able to and have not done it. And we shall 
expect that those who have not met their engagements to meet them ;that is, 
when half has been forgiven to the poor. For in former times they did not 
release the rich, it was the poor. The rich can always take care of themselves 
— that is, so far as this world is concerned, I do not know how it will be about 
the next. [Laughter.] I wish it distinctly understood that it is one-half of the 
whole amount, which we wish to relieve the poor from. It will be a little start 
on the year of jubilee. This is one item. All of you who are in favor of this 
release signify it by holding up your right hand. [The congregation voted 
unanimously in favor of the motion.] I will state that, as to the manner in 
which this will be done; it will be provided for hereafter; and a circular will 
be issued by the Twelve to the authorities, instructing them how to act in re- 
lation to this matter. 

There is another thing we want to do at the same time ; that is, there is a 
large amount of indebtedness on tithing account. You heard something about 
that yesterday; it was then averred that all the indebtedness was not reported ; 
that is, if we had it all down it would be a great deal more than is here stated. 



FIFTIETH ANNUAL CONFERENCE. 



63 



We as a people believe in paying our tithes and offerings to the Lord — and 
when I get through I want Brother Hardy to get up and talk on tithing; he is 
quite a hand to talk on this subject. We believe it is proper for us to pay 
one-tenth of our increase, or one-tenth of our time, as the case may be, to the 
Lord regularly. And a great many men do this, and do it very promptly;. but 
a great many more do not do it, only a very little — about that much sometimes 
[measuring the end of the finger. Laughter.] I think it will be a tight 
squeeze for some of them to dig through. I am not talking about this because 
I care anything about it personally; but because of the interest of those who 
ought to do it, but do not. There are a great many who have neglected the 
payment of these things partly through carelessness, partly through poverty 
and a variety of circumstances, and it begins to feel oppressive to them. Now, 
we want to break off this yoke too, that is, off those who are worthy; the 
others we do not care much about — that is unless they turn about and reform 
and take another course, live their religion and act as Latter-day Saints. But 
we wish that there shall be a release of the poor and those who are unable to 
meet it. The amount that is behind, according to the bishops' records — which 
many of the people owing it signify their willingness to pay but are not able 
to — is $151,798. We propose releasing half of the amount to the deserving 
poor, and that will be #75,899. This of course will have to be managed by 
the proper authorities, the same as the others ; that is, first on the recommenda- 
tion of the bishop of the ward, approved by the president of the stake ; and 
then to receive the sanction of the Presiding Bishop. The P. E. Fund mat- 
ter will be subject to the recommendation of the bishops, the sanction of the 
presidents of stakes and also the President of the P. E. F. Company, sanc- 
tioned by the Council of the Twelve; so that those that are really worthy may 
be released, and those that are not, ought to pay it. And then, we who have 
got a little behind in our tithing, will try and pay it up and thus keep the 
record right between us and the Lord; and then we may look for blessings 
from his hands. 

I will call a vote on this subject that I have mentioned. All who are in 
favor of releasing the obligations amounting to $75,899, on tithing, signify it 
by holding up the right hand. [Unanimous vote in favor.] All right, we 
knew that would be the feeling of the brethren. 

Another thing. We have had a great scarcity of water the last year, and 
consequently short crops. It is proposed that inasmuch as there may be suf- 
fering more or less in some places — we hope, however, that our brethren will 
not allow our poor unfortunate brethren to suffer, I have not heard of any- 
thing of the kind ; but still a little help will not do any harm. And where 
people have been in straitened circumstances through the loss of crops and 
of stock— and some people have lost, perhaps, their last cow, and some have 
I lost many of their stock, and yet have a good many left; but there has been 
quite a general loss. Now, we propose to raise 1000 head of cows— not old 
cows that do not give any milk; nor any one-teated cows, but good milk cows, 
and have them distributed among those that may be destitute in the different 
stakes, under the direction of the authorities thereof. And the Church will 
put in 300 of this 1000. I spoke to Brother Sheets and told him that we did 
not want any one-teated cows. The balance of this number, namely, 700, we 



64 



FIFTIETH ANNUAL CONFERENCE. 



would like the Stakes to make up. We have been informed by the presidents 
that this can be easily done. It would have been quite hard a while ago, be- 
fore we lost so many of our animals; but now it seems we can do it quite easy. 
[Laughter.] It is much better to give them to the poor than to have them 
die, and they have not all died yet, so we may as well begin to dispose of them. 

I want to call upon the presidents of stakes and the bishops to know if 
you are prepared to furnish the balance — you that are in favor of doing it, sig- 
nify by holding up the right hand. [The presidents and bishops voted unani- 
mously in the affirmative.] To the congregation— all you Saints who approve 
of this motion, signify it by holding up the right hand. [The vote was unani- 
mous in the affirmative.] 

Now, we are going to come to our sisters. Some people think that the sisters 
cannot do anything; I will show you what they can do. President Young re- 
organized the Relief Society — it having been organized by the Prophet Joseph 
Smith in Nauvoo— and inasmuch as the brethren had been careless and slow to 
heed the counsel of President Young in relation to storing away wheat, he 
requested the sisters to do it, and some of we "lords of creation" thought it 
was a very little thing for our sisters to be engaged in. But we find now they are 
of some use, and that the "ladies of creation" can do something as well as the 
"lords." I spoke to Sister Eliza R. Snow, who is the president of the Relief 
Society, and asked what her feelings would be, and that of her sisters, in rela- 
tion to the distribution of their wheat, for those who are in need of seed, 
letting the people have it as a loan, for which the bishops should become re- 
sponsible and see that it is returned after harvest. She replied that it would 
meet her entire approbation. The sisters have not had the opportunity to 
meet yet to get an expression of their minds in relation to it; but I will 
guarantee that they will do what they are requested to do, for they have 
already been doing something in that line, as I understand it. Is not that so 
Brother Hunter ? [Bishop Hunter: "Yes, sir."] Now, we want to show you, 
what the sisters can do. I will guarantee that they will do it, and that we will 
have a report from them before we get through. They have 34,761 bushels of 
wheat. Who of you men can raise that much ? Where's your wheat ? [Laughter.] 
Now, those 34,761 bushels of wheat will be of considerable importance judi- 
ciously managed, and loaned out to some of our poor brethi'en. It will furnish 
seed wheat, and after harvest they can return it again. We do not want any 
more harsh talk about the woman question after this. [A voice: "May they 
vote now?"] O yes, they may vote now if they choose to; everybody is will- 
ing that they should vote now. [Laughter.] That is, they are willing the 
sisters shall vote on the wheat question. [Renewed laughter.] We may as 
well call a vote on this question now, our sisters are present whom we will ask 
to vote. All you sisters who are in favor of carrying out this request, hold up 
your right hand. [A forest of hands went up.] There they go, you see. 
[Laughter.] I think that is the most hearty vote yet. I knew they would do 
it. [A voice: "Is it to be loaned without interest?"] Somebody asks if it is 
to be loaned without interest. Why, of course it is ; we do not want any non- 
sense of that kind; it is the time of jubilee. 

There is another thing. We have got through with many public matters, 
I will say something else. It is no more harm for private people to forgive 



FIFTIETH ANNUAL CONFERENCE. 



65 



one another than for public ones. If you find people owing you who are dis- 
tressed, if you will go to work and try to relieve them as much as you can, 
under the circumstances, God will relieve you when you get into difficulties. 
I will tell you that in the name of the Lord. Let us act on a kind, generous, 
brotherly principle, doing good one to another and carrying out the principles 
of the everlasting gospel in our lives. 

We talk sometimes about the United Order. There is a little of that 
spirit manifested in our operations to-day, is there not? Operating together 
for the welfare of all ; that is what we ought to do; that is what the gospel 
teaches us. 

I speak of these things for your reflection, and they are matters we will 
leave in your own bosom. And I would like to see Z. C. M. I. and our 
bankers, merchants and other creditors scratch off a few names of their 
debtors; and I think they feel disposed to do it; I have spoken to some of the 
directors of Z. C. M. I., and find that they feel about as we do. We expect to 
hear a report from them before long. While God is blessing us, let us bless 
one another; although we are not suffering, neither do we intend to suffer; 
God will not let us if we will not let one another suffer. We will go along as 
if we had no drouth or dead cattle, or any other stop, and everything will be 
prosperous. There is now every prospect of a good harvest; the grain is not 
all in yet, but we have snow in the mountains, and things look quite prosper- 
ous. And if we take good care of one another, God will take care of us ; and 
he will deliver us and stretch out his hand in our behalf, and we will be his 
people, and he shall be our God ; and we will treat one another as we wish to 
be treated by one another, and then we are prepared to receive blessings from 
his hands. Amen. 

BISHOP L. W. HARDY. 

The principle of tithing I heartily believe in, for the reason that the Lord 
instituted it himself, and, therefore, it is not a new thing on the earth. It is 
an old doctrine. Even Abraham paid his tithes to Melchisedec when he met 
him, because he held the higher priesthood of God. We have had many les- 
sons on this subject, so many that it is almost useless to talk about it now. 
The time was, since we came to the valleys of the mountains, when the Saints 
had nothing to pay tithing in but labor, hence they devoted every tenth day to 
beautifying and building up this city and other cities. Every tenth day the 
Bishops called upon those that lived in their wards to go to work on the pub- 
lic works and streets, and the call was generally very promptly responded to. 
Thus when the tithing came to be made up at the end of the year, the tithing 
paid in this way amounted to about $48.00 each man. As time wore on, how- 
ever, the people became more numerous, and as they had so much to do for 
themselves, they began to pay a tenth of what they raised, whatever ihat 
might be — say butter, cheese, eggs, or anything else they might have about 
their farms, and this amounted to a large sum when it was all brought in. 
Now, we find, in looking over the schedules for 1879, men that we know are 
doing a pretty good business — we find that they have paid from $3 to $5, 
whereas it ought to be from $300 to $500. It is a mockery to attempt to pay 
tithing to the Lord in this way. Had we the honest tithing of this people 



66 



FIFTIETH ANNUAL CONFERENCE. 



to-day, we would not require to ask for any donations to the temple ; we would 
have sufficient to maintain the poor and pay the salaries of the different officers 
of the Church, and in addition to this, we would have so much that we would 
scarcely have room to contain it. This is a principle that the Lord demands 
of this people, and there is a blessing attached to it, for the Lord has promised 
that inasmuch as we will pay our tithes he will open the windows of heaven 
and pour out a blessing that there will not be room enough to receive it.

Statistical Report of the Deseret Sunday School Union, for the year ending 

December 31 st, 1879: 

No. of Stakes from which reports have been received, 21 ; No. of Sunday- 
Schools reported, 256; No. of officers and teachers, 4,998; Average attend- 
ance of officers and teachers, 3,405; No. of pupils, 30,768; Average attend- 
ance of pupils, 21,922; Total number of officers, teachers and pupils, 35,759; 
No. of Theological Classes, 133; No. of Bible and Testament Classes, 991; 
No. of Book of Mormon Classes, 361 ; No. of Doctrine and Covenant Classes, 
159; No. of Juvenile Instructor Classes, 203; No. of Jaques' Catechism 
Classes, 187; No. of Miscellaneous Classes, 1,316; Total number of Classes, 
3,350; No. of Books in Sunday School Libraries, 17,908; Amount of funds 
on hand, end of previous year, $962.84; Amount of funds collected in 1879, 
$5,742.75; Amount of funds disbursed in 1879, $5>S I 3-93'> Amount of funds 
in treasury, end of year, $1,198.26; No. of Schools not reported, and there- 
fore not included in the above figures, 19. 

The above report shows an increase of about 2,000 children more than 
were reported for the last year; and also a proportionate increase in the num- 
ber of classes and the average attendance of both teachers and scholars, num- 
ber of books in libraries, etc. The rapid growth and prosperous condition of 
the Sunday School cause generally, throughout the different Stakes of Zion, is 
very gratifying and gives us abundant cause for thankfulness to God our Hea- 
venly Father for his blessings on his faithful servants and handmaidens en- 
gaged in this good and great work.

PRESIDENT JOHN TAYLOE. 

I do not know whether we fully understand what is meant by holding up 
our hands to testify that we will sustain these missionaries. I will tell you how 
I understand it. In the first place we select the very best men we can find, 
and we do not want anybody to go but those who have the spirit of their mis- 
sion upon them, and who feel a desire to magnify their calling and priesthood. 
And when they go, we wish them to go as honorable men, and we also want 
their wives to be treated as honorable women while their husbands are gone, 
and inasmuch as they or their families need assistance or looking after — al- 
though it is not all who do — we expect the Presidents of Stakes and the 
Bishops will attend to such matters; that the wives of our missionaries may 
not feel as though they were outcasts; but as honorable women, the wives of 
honorable men, and more so than those who are not doing their duty. We 
want the missionaries' wives and children made comfortable and taken 
care of. The sisters have voted to let us have some of their wheat for the re- 
lief of the poor. Then on the other hand, let us do something for them. It 
does not matter how much we pray for them, for this is in accordance with our 
covenants or voting. Some people would rather pray for them than relieve 



63 



FIFTIETH ANNUAL CONFERENCE. 



them. Prayers are all well enough ; but a little flour, a little pork, a little beef, 
sugar, store goods, and temporal comforts are a great deal better than all our 
prayers without this material assistance. Let us look after their welfare as we 
do after our own families, while their husbands are making a sacrifice in 
leaving their families and homes, and God will bless us. "Every one," says 
the Lord, "that hath forsaken houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mo- 
ther, or wife, or children, or lands, for my name's sake, shall receive an hun- 
dred fold, and shall inherit everlasting life." Let us make the words of the 
Lord true. Amen.

ELDER ALBERT CARRINGTON. 

At any time at your pleasure, by turning to the Second Book of Nephi, 
nth chapter, 15th paragraph, in the last sentence of that paragraph, you can 
read these words: "But the laborer in Zion shall labor for Zion; for if they 
labor for money they shall perish." I presume all of you have read, or have 
heard read, the decree of Jehovah ; but have we fully realized that inasmuch 
as we, his covenant people, are not always careful to observe his requirements 
with due strictness, but unduly labor for that which perisheth, and spend too 
much of our time, means and influence for that which only pertains to this 
time, we also run great risk of disappointment? If we do not realize this, I 
really think it behooves us to comprehend that our father in the heavens has 
decreed that we shall labor for Zion — for the upbuilding and establishment of 
his kingdom upon this the earth of our Father in heaven. Some of us were 
aware of this plain declaration nearly fifty years ago, but have we diligently 
striven, to the utmost of our powers, to carry out that requirement? Have we 
observed it with all care and singleness of purpose, in connection with many 
other like texts ? 

Our Father has also taught us, through his revealed will, that inasmuch as 
the inhabitants of this land of Zion will seek unto him and learn to do his will, 
they shall prosper spiritually and temporally — in their persons, in their habita- 
tions, in their families, and in all that pertains to them: but inasmuch as they 
will not do his will, they shall be cut off from his presence. Are there any 
exceptions to that decree and that wise purpose of our Father? Will he for 
our sakes, when he has not for the sake of our forefathers, change his unal- 
terable purpose and his fixed times and decrees? I think not. Is it not then 
obligatory upon us to diligently comply with all these plain requirements, and 
to more faithfully bring ourselves in accord with other requirements like unto 
them, wherein we are required to love one another, to do unto others as we

would they should do unto us, to love the Lord our God with all our might) 
mind and strength, and our neighbor as ourselves? Are we careful on these 
points? Or do we flatter ourselves that these plain, righteous requirements 
will be changed to suit our views, our convenience, our carelessness, our in- 
difference, and at times our niggardly, selfish, covetous" feelings ? 

As I do not deem it proper to occupy much time, to the exclusion of others, I 
will confine, my remarks more purticularly to a matter that I have been much 
interested in from the day of a vote in the Temple in Nauvoo — the gathering 
of the Lord's poor. In 1849 President Young initiated the Perpetual Emigrat- 
ing Fund Company, and in 1850, if I correctly remember, that Company was 
organized on a plan to be perpetual so long as it may be needed by the poor 
of scattered Israel. From that date it has aided thousands upon thousands 
from the bondage of oppression and poverty in far off lands to peaceful and 
properous homes in these valleys of the mountains, and above all to the bless- 
ings of the ordinances of the Gospel. Has not that been one of the greatest 
blessings and privileges to all who have thus been relieved? 

When I reflect upon these facts, and bear in mind that much care has been 
taken for a right application of the funds, even all possible care, so far as I 
know, and then turn to the treatment that so many have meted, not only to the 
Fund, but also to their brethren and sisters yet ungathered, many of whom are 
in more adverse circumstances than were some who have been aided, at times 
I should almost become discouraged. But I know of no such feeling as dis- 
couragement in the operations of the Fund, for it will accomplish its work as 
the Lord may will, however much individuals may fail in complying, when 
able, with their agreements. But how those who have been and are able to 
repay are so slack, careless and indifferent in regard to their obligations so 
thankfully undertaken, I am at a loss to comprehend. Should they not, for 
their own sakes and the sakes of the ungathered poor, be more diligent in 
repaying ? 

. So far as I am aware, there has not been the least oppression exercised in 
trying to collect indebtedness to the P. E. Fund. Do we now wish to crowd, 
or oppress, or infringe upon the comfor - of any one indebted to the Fund ? No ; 
but we are very anxious that the Fund shall be able this season to aid many 
from the adverse circumstances in which they are. Many have no expectation 
of deliverance except under the blessings of the Lord through this Fund. 
And can we help them unless those pay who are indebted? Some may say, 
"Solicit donations," and may wonder why donations to the P. E. Fund have 
not been solicited for some time past. 

In 1869 the P. E. Fund expended some $60,000 to $70,000 for the emigra- 
tion of the poor. The next season it was hoped that, having used so large a 
sum to aid those who had but ltttle, and frequently no means, the Fund would 
be able to assist those who had the nearest enough for their emigration. This 
would have been a stimulus for all to save as much as possible, and would 
have gathered a much larger number with a like disbursement. But from that 
day to this, with our utmost striving, we have not been able to get beyond the 
suffering poor, for that clas's increase beyond our means. This I have regret- 
ted. This regret may arise from a lack of understanding on my part, for our 
Fath er in heaven orders all things wisely, and his hand is in all these matters.

He rules and controls, not only in the armies of heaven, but in the midst of 
the affairs of the children of men, disposing the results of their acts according 
to his own good will and pleasure. Realizing this, I have not felt to worry, 
but I have felt somewhat grieved that we have not been able to more effectu- 
ally encourage those who are doing so much for their own deliverance. In 
the meantime, the poor, the worthy, faithful, deserving poor, have been accu- 
mulating, in spite of all the Fund can do. We endeavor, all in our power, to 
collect the means due the Fund, and then to expend the payments and dona- 
tions in the best manner possible. 

It may be asked, " Have you not aided some who have not proved faithful 
Latter-day Saints since they arrived here?" Yes; and how can you foretell 
who will apostatize, unless you have direct revelation in each case ? We have 
all been anxious, and have taken all possible care, not to aid any who would 
not prove worthy. But have we not been mistaken in some instances, after 
exercising all the care in our power? Yes ; some whom we thought to be good, 
faithful Latter-day Saints, and who, so far as we could learn, were so there, 
and had been all the while, have, since their arrival here, made shipwreck of 
their faith; and at the same time have not had enough manhood, or principle, 
to pay back the means advanced to help them out of bondage to a land of liberty. 
Can we help that? Not that I am aware of; and it seems impossible for us to 
do so, try we ever so hard, from the fact that this kingdom is likened to a net 
which is to gather fish of every kind. If we could keep out the garfish, catfish, 
suckers, and every other kind of coarse fish, it would not be the Gospel net. 
Aside from this, I think there are some who, if they had remained in their na- 
tive lands, would never have apostatized; but gather them here and they apos- 
tatize ! That also seems to be in the economy of this great latter-day work, so 
I have not felt to critically question the wisdom or good judgment of those 
who have recommended this, that, or the other one for assistance, even when 
those assisted have apostatized. 

President Taylor, the Trustee-in-Trust, has presented to our votes the 
question of releasing a large amount of back tithing indebtedness, due from 
those who are aged and infirm, and others who have no prospect for paying. 
The Bishops, upon due examination, will recommend for relief, stating a few 
chief reasons therefor; then the Presidents of Stakes will examine the recom- 
mends made by the Bishops, and add such comments as they may please, and 
forward the lists to the P. E. F. Office in this city, where they can be carefully 
considered and then submitted to President Taylor, under whose direction the 
Fund operates. I rejoice that the worthy poor, struggling with adversity, are 
to be so kindly treated, and are to be left free and untrammeled, when they 
cannot possibly free themselves in any other way. I know of no just way of 
becoming clear of a fair indebtedness, except by payment or forgiveness. 

That reminds me of another class of Fund debtors. When I speak to 
them they say: "Oh, yes, we are abundantly able to pay, but you cannot col- 
lect the debt by law, because it is outlawed." I am well aware that I cannot 
compel you by law to pay that indebtedness, neither would I had I it in my 
power; that is not the way the Fund does its business. All its business is 
conducted on the broad principle of fairness and liberality, wronging.no one, 
benefitting every one as far as possible. But consider, inasmuch as you are 



72 



FIFTIETH ANNUAL CONFERENCE. 



able to pay the indebtedness which you incurred in being delivered from bond- 
age and placed where you can provide yourselves with the necessaries and 
comforts of life, whether you are even worldly wise in being unwilling to repay 
that amount and thus prevent others enjoying the privileges you once esteemed 
so highly. And what has been said to the Saints abroad when they have im- 
portuned and plead, and promised to repay soon after arriving here— they know 
how they plead, they know how they promised— many professing to be willing 
to bind themselves for a lifetime if they could only be gathered to these moun- 
tains. What has been said to them? You do not understand what you are 
talking about. You may not find things altogether as you anticipate. You 
may meet with disappointment and misfortune. We will help you, we will 
send you through as comfortably and as cheaply as we can ; and when you ar- 
rive there and find employment, just pay your tithing faithfully and promptly, 
provide yourselves with shelter, comfortable clothing, food and fuel, all of 
which things you will need; then, please, when you have done all this, begin 
to pay your indebtedness to the Fund ; pay one dollar, two dollars, ten dollars, 
as you are able, without depriving yourselves of the necessaries of life, and in 
that way you will all the while keep the spirit of the work which you now 
measurably enjoy, and it will grow and increase, because you will be comply- 
ing with the requirements of the Gospel. And others in like, or worse, cir- 
cumstances can be helped through your paying the obligations you are so 
strongly pleading to be allowed, and so energetically promising you will pay 
as fast as possible. Ought not these fair requirements to be complied with by 
those who have been aided, as soon and as far as may be in their power, 
through their faithfulness? 

After all indebtedness to the Fund has been remitted, that ought to be, 
there will still be a large sum due. Will we be able to collect all of that? I 
am afraid not; for some Fund debtors who had property have apostatized, 
and others have accumulated property since they apostatized, without sufficient 
manhood to repay the means that enabled them to be here. They worship the 
world, have apostatized and gone with the world. I pity them, because they 
are traveling on a road of exceeding darkness; and they cannot see things as 
they are, or they would pay their Fund indebtedness. 

As to interest on sums advanced, has any one been crowded in the least 
in regard to payment of interest? Not to my knowledge. Have some paid 
their indebtedness with interest, without grumbling, and preferring so to do? 
Yes. Who are they? Those who rejoice in the light, life and intelligence of 
a goodly measure of the Holy Spirit, which is beyond all comparison as to 
value. Others, when making payment, have said: "With regard to the inter- 
est, I do not like that." Has not the interest been put at the lowest rate? 
Could you borrow a like amount from any one, during all these years, for less ? 
You cannot borrow money in small amounts to-day for so low an interest, and 
scarcely large amounts at so low a rate, except with the very best security. 
The Fund has never asked more than ten per cent., and it was placed at that 
rate under the instruction of President Young. How long it will so remain I 
do not know. Some will say, " I am willing to pay a little interest." Very 
well, how much are you willing to pay, and feel well about it? "I am willing 
to pay five per cent." Very well; Bro. Anderson, cast the interest at five per 



FIFTIETH ANNUAL CONFERENCE. 



73 



cent, and give up the note, though the other five per cent, belongs to the Fund 
by his own gladly undertaken agreement. Another says: "I am willing to 
pay the principal, but I will not pay any interest." That is not very polite* 
though it certainly is plain. Pay us the principal and you can have your note. 
And lately some have gone so far as to ask us to forego a portion of the prin- 
cipal, which we have not felt at liberty to do; but now all such persons can 
apply to their Bishops, and they will report. Can any one discern any crowd- 
ing or oppression in these cases? Now, in all kindness, in all sincerity, I ear- 
nestly solicit the debtors to the Fund, for their own sakes, for the sake of the 
work they profess to uphold^and sustain, and for the sake of the ungathered poor 
in their poverty and bondage, to wake up and help this season, so far as they 
maybe able, that more of the Lord's poor may also rejoice in their deliverance. 

As to the application of the funds in assisting, it has been the custom, as 
a general practice, to use the very best information to be had as to the disposal 
of any given amount. On that plan, last season and the season before, most 
of the means were directed from the P. E. Fund office. This season they have 
the best information at the office in Liverpool, or can obtain it, with regard to 
the condition and circumstances of the Saints, for which reason all the means 
we receive, except small amounts loaned to those who have nearly enough, 
and to be returned in time for this year's emigration, are forwarded to Liver- 
pool, to be distributed as the authorities there may deem best. But with all 
our efforts since the close of last season, after paying off an indebtedness in- 
curred in helping a number of Saints from the East who had been mobbed, we 
had only ^112, or $543, to send to Liverpool for the April company. That 
would not emigrate one large destitute family; it is a mere drop in the bucket. 
But it was all we had; and we were obliged to instruct that the amount must 
not be exceeded, because we have no right to fall back upon the Trustee, and 
ask him to pay indebtedness incurred by the operations of the Fund. ■'Will 
we be able to forward any money for the May company? Only a very small 
amount, so far as I know, though this rests with those who are due the Fund. 

Some may wish to know why the making of donations has not been urged 
more than it has. In 1869 there were so many assisted that it interfered with 
other arrangements, not known at the time ; and before there were means for 
overcoming that difficulty, the financial crash of I873 occurred. When I spoke 
to President Young about donations, he said: "Wait a while; the people are 
poor just now. Try and collect the indebtedness, as far as you can " And 
since then, among other reasons, I have not felt to solicit donations, because 
it is well known that there is a very large sum due to the Fund, so large that, 
if we could only receive one-half of it, we could gather all that any one would 
say ought to be gathered, and then have much money left to go on with; and 
were I to solicit aid under such circumstances, I am of the opinion that I might 
be advised to collect what is due to the Fund. And what could I say? I have 
yet to learn what I would be able to say. 

I deem the gathering of scattered Israel to be a part of the work that be- 
longs to us as Latter-day Saints, in building up the Church and Kingdom of 
our God upon the earth. I think it is part of our labor, the same as building 
temples, sustaining the poor, sending missionaries abroad and sustaining their 
families when necessary, and all that tends to spread the principles of truth 



74 



FIFTIETH ANNUAL CONFERENCE. 



and righteousness the wide world over. But do I wish to give the gathering 
of the poor an undue share of the means, of the labor, and of the time that 
pertains to this great latter-day work? I do not know that I do. But I feel 
anxious for the debtors to the Fund to so far honor our God and themselves as 
to free themselves from this indebtedness as speedily as they may be able, and 
thus free the scattered poor from bondage, and bring them here to enjoy the 
blessings we enjoy; and I can not see how we are going to entirely escape a 
measure of the condemnation made known in the paragraph I have quoted, 
except we are a little more diligent in attending to these matters. And I trust 
you will not blame us when we entreat those who are able to pay their indebt- 
edness to the Fund as soon as possible. 
God bless you. Amen. 

PRESIDENT JOHN" TAYLOR. 

In relation to the subject that I referred to this morning pertaining to the 
Co-op, I am informed that they are very busy with their affairs and have not 
had time to make any specific statement pertaining to this matter ; but they 
feel disposed to unite with us in relieving the necessitous and worthy, as far 
as they would be justified in the premises, and in accordance with correct 
principles, to do their part. I would here remark that the same kind of feel- 
ing would be very commendable on the part of other store-keepers, bankers, 
or any one of us to relieve each other. 

I would make a statement in relation to the Co-op. I have had reports 
from the north, that some parties who ought to know better, had said that the 
Co-op. was no longer a Church institution, and that it was managed, directed 
and controlled by a few monopolists, and that we were asking the people to 
sustain them in their operations, which I consider very infamous talk, and 
especially coming from men who profess to be men of honor. The Church, I 
will here say, holds an interest in that establishment to the amount of $360,000, 
and then there are 580 stockholders, who are Latter-day Saints, in it, besides 
the interest which the Church holds. And when men make such statements I 
consider it infamous and contrary to correct principles ; and I should recom- 
mend their bishops and the authorities of the Church where they live to bring 
them up for slander and treat them accordingly. That enterprise was started 
as is properly implied by the initials of its name. What is it? "Zion's Co- 
operative Mercantile Institution." They had for sometime difficulties to cope 
with; perhaps things might not have been managed as well as they could 
have been. There may have been errors in judgment. For sometime they 
did not pay dividends; but latterly they have paid what might be considered a 
fair dividend, and the Institution never was in a better condition than it is to- 
day. I speak of this that you who are stockholders in that institution may 
not be imposed upon by speculators who would seek by false representations 
to get from you your stock at less figures than it is really worth, I think it 
is our duty, as Latter-day Saints, to sustain that institution; and then, on the 
other hand, I think it is the duty of that institution to sustain the Saints, and 
let us get closer together in our relationship, and act honorably and uprightly 
in everything we engage in, then we can secure the blessing of the Almighty. 
I thought I would say so much in relation to this matter. 



FIFTIETH ANNUAL CONFERENCE. 



75 



In regard to the work we are engaged in, it is one of very great impor- 
tance; it is one on which God and angels, apostles, prophets, patriarchs and 
men of God who have lived in the different ages of the world, have felt in- 
terested about; and do to-day. And about these little matters of dollars and 
cents we do not care so much about them or ought not to ; although we have 
to attend to all these matters — matters temporal, matters spiritual, things per- 
taining to time and things pertaining to eternity. It is expected of us that we 
act wisely, prudently and understandingly in all of our doings. And in speak- 
ing of the Perpetual Emigrating Fund Company's operations, we expect that 
all decent men will meet their obligations, and those who are not of that class 
will not. We will forgive the poor and let them go, and the others may go if 
they want to. But we will not release them from their indebtedness if they 
are able to pay it. Is not that just? I think it is. We will relieve the poor 
and needy; but as to those people who have called upon you — and you have 
sent out your teams and have loaded those teams with provisions of all kinds, 
and you have either gone yourselves or sent your sons to drive them, to help 
them in, if those men do not feel like acting just and right, let them be con- 
sidered among the unjust who have used your means which was appropriated 
by you to relieve the necessitous and have not had the honesty to return it, 
but as to the poor, the needy and distressed, we will come to their relief and 
help them, the same as we are obliged to go to God our Heavenly Father and 
ask him to help us, for we are all dependent upon the mercy of God, we live 
in him, we move in him, and to him- we are indebted for our existence as well 
as for every blessing that we enjoy pertaining to time or eternity. He has re- 
vealed unto us the fullness of the blessings of the gospel of peace, he has taken 
our feet from the mire and clay and has planted us upon the rock of eternal 
truth, he has imparted unto us the light, intelligence and revelation of heaven, 
he has made us to sit together in heavenly places in Jesus Christ, he has 
taught us how to save ourselves and our families, how to save our progenitors 
and how to save our posterity. And we have this labor to perform. And if 
we have gone forth and assisted our brethren we have only done our duty, 
and what was there so much after all? Not much, we have simply performed 
a duty — a duty we owed to God and our brethren. If we had not had the 
means we could not have given it, and having given it, we will continue to do 
the best we can and we will keep on doing, helping all, comforting all, reliev- 
ing all, teaching all and seeking to promote the well being of the human fam- 
ily and to carry out the designs of God in the best manner that we can. 

One duty we owe to the world is to preach to them the gospel, and for 
that the priesthood is organized in part. The Elders are sent forth from time 
to time — many that are around me on my right and left and also before me 
have gone forth "weeping, bearing precious seed," they have gone in the 
midst of persecution and affliction, to an unthankful world, to proclaim to the 
people the glad tidings of salvation, and they have "returned again rejoicing 
bringing their sheaves with them." And we are still doing the same, the 
Lord has laid it upon us and it must be done. And when we send out mission- 
aries — I was told that some did not hear what I said this morning upon this 
subject, I will try to make you all hear now — when we send out missionaries 
we want you to see that their families are provided for in their absence, if they 



7 6 



FIFTIETH ANNUAL CONFERENCE. 



have not the means to do it themselves, stand by them and treat them kindly 
and provide them with the necessaries of life that they require, that they may 
be comfortable and made happy and be one with us, and while our brethren 
are engaged laboring abroad, notable to provide for their families, let us pro- 
vide for them. And we call upon the presidents of Stakes, and upon the bis- 
hops and upon the people where they reside to see that these things are at- 
tended too, that the families of our missionary brethren are made comfortable 
and happy. Our brethren under these circumstances can feel contented and 
can go forth with satisfaction and joy. "Why," they will say, "we are going 
forth in the name of the Lord trusting in the God of Israel, and while we are 
gone we have left our families among our friends who will take care of them, 
and all is well and all will be well." When you do that they will bless you 
and you will be blessed in time and in eternity. It is a great privilege to be 
able to do good. Did you ever think of it? Jesus said, "Make to yourselves 
friends of the mammon of unrighteousness, that when ye fail they may receive 
you into everlasting habitations." Then let us feel after the welfare of our 
brethren, and we will not dwell much upon one another's weaknesses, for God 
knows that all of us have enough of them, at least, I feel I have, and I think 
my brethren feel that they have, and I do not think that many of you are very 
much better than we are. But I tell you what we desire to do and to see car- 
ried out. We wish correct principles to be carried out, and while we are 
sending the gospel to the nations afar off, we want to see the pure principles 
of the gospel lived up to at home. We do not want to be influenced by th*e 
corruptions that float upon us here. While we respect proper authority and 
pay proper deference to all honorable men in all positions in our country, we 
do not want to copy after the devices of this corrupt generation, we want 
them to keep them to themselves if they admire them. We neither want 
drunkenness nor whoredom nor infanticide nor foeticide nor any of the cor- 
ruptions that abound throughout the world, or of this nation, of which every 
honorable man ought to and does feel ashamed. We want to train up our 
youth in the fear of God, and hence we have our Young Men's and Young 
Ladies' Mutual Improvement Associations, which are doing a great deal ot 
good throughout the land in teaching and being taught correct principles. 
It is our youth that are growing up that we shall have to look to, by and by, 
to bear off this kingdom, and we wish the fathers and mothers to set their 
children a good and proper example, to be patterns of purity, of honesty, 
truth, integrity and uprightness, that they may be able to meet and look 
every man in the face with a clear conscience and open countenance, and not 
be obliged to dodge around corners for fear of some one seeing them and 
finding them out. There are no people under the heavens that make greater 
pretensions than we, there are no people under the heavens that have been 
more favored of God than we have been. We feel inclined sometimes to 
murmur and complain about the nation to which we belong. It is true they 
have not treated us very generously or very kindly in many respects, but the 
Lord seems to take care of us, and we do not suffer much do we? We en- 
joy more liberty to-day than millions of the inhabitants of the world do. And 
I do not know of any nation under the heavens where we would be better 
protected than we are here, thanks to many honorable men and thanks to the 



FIFTIETH ANNUAL CONFERENCE. 



77 



God of Israel who has delivered us and who has told us that he would 
watch over us and take care of us and provide for us, which he has done, 
and I feel grateful to him. For this, however, we are not under any obli- 
gations to our enemies, but no matter, if they can stand it we can. When 
I see men violating the sacred principles of liberty and trampling under 
foot the institutions of our nation, I feel to realize that they are the enemies 
of mankind and of the nation. I do not care what position they occupy. God 
will hold them to an account, as breakers of their own covenants. We will 
try, however, to maintain our own, and treat everybody right, and pray for all 
honorable men, and let the devil take care of the balance. (Laughter). This 
is how I feel in relation to these matters. We want among ourselves to learn 
strictly the principles of honesty, to have and maintain honest dealing one 
with another and be true to our word, and to let our word be our bond. And 
never mind so much about litigation. I do not know that I ever sued a man 
in my life, and I do not think that I ever shall. I am not fond enough of law, 
or money either, to do it. And God will help us and protect us in our rights, 
if we will only do right. And then we Latter-day Saints, we elders of Israel 
and we sisters of Israel, we ought to be ladies and gentlemen, we ought to 
treat one another with courtesy and kindness, and true politeness. Lord 
Chesterfield and others have written long treatises on politeness. I will tell 
you, in a few words, what it is to be polite: try to make everybody as com- 
fortable and happy as you can, in all your words and in all your acts, and 
then you will be polite. Study the feelings of those with whom you are asso- 
ciated and those with whom you come in contact. And when a man meets an 
elder, why, says he, that is an honorable man, that man is anointed of the 
Lord, I will respect him, I expect to be associated with him in time and in 
eternity, and shall I degrade myself by speaking harshly or acting harshly 
towards him? No, but we will treat one another with kindness and courtesy. 
And we will treat our sisters in the same way, and act the part of gentlemen 
towards them, and protect them in all their rights and in all their privi- 
leges, and never be afraid that they are going to run away with some of our 
rights. When I hear people talk that way I think they are a little in doubt 
of themselves. Why, we expect our sisters — our wives — to be with us rwt 
only in time, but in eternity; and let us treat them accordingly, with kindness, 
with affection, with love and with esteem. And then let the sisters turn round 
and treat their husbands and brothers and fathers in the same way; and let us 
all cultivate those principles that are calculated to promote one another's hap- 
piness and peace, that it may reign in our own bosoms, and dwell in our habi- 
tations, and prevail throughout the land, that the peace of God and the bless- 
ing of God may rest upon us. And while we feel a disposition to do right and 
to keep the commandments of God, God will bless us and sustain us in all of 
our operations ; and every plot and every contrivance devised against us will 
fall to the ground, for God will be our deliverer and our protector. Let us train 
up our children in the fear of God too, and watch over their morals, and espe- 
cially the morals of our daughters, and see that they do not get led astray in 
the paths of iniquity; but watch over them and pray with them and for them; 
and pray for one another, and sustain one another, and help one another, and 
bless one another, and God will bless us.

FIFTIETH ANNUAL CONFERENCE. 



We are sending out persons to go and extend the borders of Zion, to make 
new settlements. I was very much pleased to hear some remarks made by 
Brother Woodruff in relation to these things, and the acts and doings of the 
brethren in Arizona, a*id of some of the new settlements south and southeast. 
There is a number of "those settlements referred to by Brother Woodruff, the 
members of which we advised when they went, to come as near to the United 
Order as they could — that is, to be united. Brother Woodruff says that in 
those new settlements he did not see a man drunk, he did not hear a man 
swear, neither did he see any person use tea or coffee. In this respect they 
are setting an example that it would be well for us to follow. And, then, do 
not pursue that licentious course exhibited around us here. It is this d — d 
infernal "civilization" that has introduced these infamies into our midst. Let 
us purge ourselves from them, and not mix Up with their ungodly doings. Ex- 
cuse me for the remarks, but they are true before God ; they are both damned 
and infernal, for those who practice them will be damned, and they are infer- 
nal, because they proceed from the infernal regions. I do not care who sus- 
tains them, whether governors, judges, priests, or whatever they may be ; they 
are of their father, the devil, who sustains those things and maintains them. 
Those crimes are not original with us ; they are brought here to try to cor- 
rupt and enslave and debase and pollute us. Keep yourselves pure from 
these corruptions, and walk worthily of the high vocation whereunto you 
are called. 

I heard the other day from one of our speakers that there were Elders, High 
Priests and Seventies who got drunk. What are the Bishops doing? What 
are the Presidents of .Stakes doing? Why do you not bring them up and cut 
them off from the Church — any such Elder, any such High Priest, or any 
such Seventy, or any of the Saints who may be found guilty of such thing? 
For they are hypocrites, and want dealing with and severing from the Church. 
Furthermore, I have heard of some Bishops who have been seeking to cover 
up the iniquities of men ; I tell them, in the name of God, they will have to 
bear them themselves, and meet that judgment; and I tell you that any man 
who tampers with iniquity, he will have to bear that iniquity, and if any of you 
want to partake of the sins of men, or uphold them, you will have to bear them. 
Do you hear it, you Bishops and you Presidents? God will require it at 
your hands. You are not placed in position to tamper with the principles of 
righteousness, nor to cover up the infamies and corruptions of men. Now, do 
not say you did not know anything about it; I have given you fair warning, 
and I clear my skirts of your blood; and their infamies will cleave to you un- 
less you attend to it. 

God expects us to do right; he has giveu unto us the priesthood for that 
purpose, and he requires us to magnify it and honor it and carry it out. And 
it is the place of those men, and the place of the teachers to see that there is 
no iniquity in the Church; and if they do not do their duty, it then becomes 
the duty of the Bishops to see to it; and if the Bishops do not see to it, it is 
the place of the Presidents of Stakes to see to it; and if they do not see to it, 
and it comes to our ears, it will then become our duty to see to it, and also to 
see to them who do not magnify their calling. God will not be mocked. 
"Whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap; if he sows to the flesh,

he shall of the flesh reap corruption; if he sows to the spirit, he shall of the 
spirit reap life everlasting." 

We are gathered here to serve God ; we are gathered here to be taught in 
the ways of the Lord; we are gathered here to build up temples, and then to 
administer in them; we are gathered here to send the Gospel to the nations of 
the earth, and to fulfil those various requirements v/hich God has placed upon 
us to attend to; and if we are faithful in all our duties, God will bless us. 

I find that the time has expired. Shall we continue the Conference an- 
other day? All who desire to do so say aye. (The vast congregation re- 
sponded " aye.") 

Choir sang the anthem, 

"Sing to the Lord a joyful strain." 

Adjourned till Thursday, at 10 a.m. 

Dismissed with prayer by Elder Brigham Young.

In work so pleasant, so divine." 

Prayer by Elder Orson Pratt.

"Joy to the world — the Lord will come, 
And earth receive her king." 

ELDER LORENZO SNOW. 

We, as Latter-day Saints, profess to believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, in 
the restoration of the fulness of the everlasting Gospel, in the restoration of 
the Holy Priesthood, with its privileges and powers, and in the restoration of 
the authority to administer to the sick, and to receive, through the medium of 
this Gospel which we have espoused, supernatural gifts and blessings, the 
Holy Spirit, which communicates a knowledge of things past, of things 
present and of things to come. And when we received this Gospel, we cove- 
nanted before God that we would be led, that we would be governed, and 
would follow the suggestions of the Holy Spirit, that we would follow the 
suggestions of the principle that gives life, that gives knowledge, that gives 
understanding of the things of God, that communicates the mind of God ; and 
that we would labor for the accomplishment of the purposes of God in the 
salvation of the human family, adopting as a motto of life, " The Kingdom of 
God, or nothing." How far we have kept these covenants during the past 
fifty years, and followed the dictates of the Holy Spirit, we ourselves must be

FIFTIETH ANNUAL CONFERENCE. 



the judges. So far as we have done this, so far have the blessings of the Al- 
mighty descended upon us, and our minds have been enlightened, our under- 
standings enlarged, and we have moved forward in the path of holiness, in the 
path of perfection, and which enables us this day to stand in the knowledge 
and power of God, and in the intelligence of heaven, just in proportion as we 
have observed the spirit of those covenants which we made at the waters of 
baptism; and just so far as we have failed in our faithfulness, in our adherence 
to our engagements, just so far have we been losers in this enterprise in which 
we have engaged to obtain eternal life, to obtain wisdom and knowledge and 
divine intelligence sufficiently to stem the tide of evils and temptations that 
surround us. And just so far as we have followed the suggestions of this 
divine spirit, have we experienced peace and joy to our souls, we have dis- 
comfitted the enemy, we have laid up unto ourselves treasures that moth and 
rust cannot destroy, so far have we forwarded ourselves in the path of the 
celestial kingdom; just so far have we secured ourselves the^blessings and 
privileges that pertain to the celestial law. When these things were opened 
up to our view — the principles of the Gospel and the glory of the celestial 
worlds — it was then our privilege to enjoy its blessings to a certain extent, just 
as though we had been translated into the celestial worlds ; it was our privi- 
lege to enjoy a certain amount of the blessings that pertain to those laws. 
And just so far as we have conformed to these laws that pertain to our tem- 
poral salvation, just so far as we have obeyed the instructions given to us in 
regard to our temporal union, just so far we stand in prosperity before God 
and before the world; just so far as we have been induced to open our hearts 
to display the principles of philanthropy in the exercise of our religion, just 
so far do we stand this day approved of the Almighty God; just so far have 
we secured the implements or the means to defend ourselves against the ap- 
proaching evils; just so far in all our settlements, cities, towns or villages, as 
we have observed these laws that pertain to our temporal obligations, just so 
far has prosperity attended our exertions, and just so far as the spirit of union 
prevailed in our midst, and we have advanced ourselves in these principles. 
And just so far as we have ignored these things, just so far do we stand weak 
to-day before God and before the world. 

A sufficiency of information has been placed before us in the revelations 
of former days, in the revelations to us at the present time to guide us in all 
of our affairs, both spiritual and temporal, to guide us even to the celestial 
kingdom to receive of the fulness of the Father. If, after the expiration of 
fifty years, we as a community do not stand in that high relationship to God 
that we could wish, the fault is not in the Lord, it is not for the lack of infor- 
mation placed before us, but that lack is in ourselves; it arises from our ignor- 
ance or neglect, or from a desire, peradventure, to serve the spirit of the world 
instead of the Spirit of God. 

It is true, when we look upon the temporal position that thousands and 
tens of thousands occupied at the time we received this Gospel, and when we 
take into consideration the spiritual fetters by which we were bound, and the 
ignorance that attended us in our spiritual affairs at that time, we certainly 
may feel very thankful to the Lord for the progress we have made when com- 
paring our present position with that we sustained when we received the Gos- 



FIFTIETH ANNUAL CONFERENCE. 



81 



pel; there must arise in our hearts the deepest gratitude to the Almighty for 
so far redeeming us spiritually and temporally as we find ourselves this day. 
For the progress we have made we are indebted to the blessings of God at- 
tending our diligence and faithfulness. And we should renew our covenants 
before God and the holy angels, that we will, God being our helper, serve him 
more faithfully during the ensuing year than we have in the past, that our 
public and private life, our actions and the spirit and influence we wield may 
be in keeping with the motto, "The Kingdom of God or nothing." I trust, 
my brethren, that we may devote ourselves entirely to the service of our God 
in the establishing of his Zion on the earth, zealously laboring in the interest 
of truth and righteousness on the earth, until it shall become a joy to us to be 
so engaged, that it may become second nature to us to serve God and keep his 
commandments, and to observe the celestial law, and that we may so enjoy the 
Holy Spirit in our hearts that we may overcome the world and establish the 
celestial law in our minds and establish it in our practice ; that we may so un- 
derstand ourselves and our privileges that we may in this life secure a consid- 
erable portion of the blessings that pertain to the celestial law, and which are 
to be enjoyed in the celestial glory. That so far as God gives us power in the 
earth, so far as he gives us possessions, houses and lands, flocks and herds, 
that these possessions shall become sanctified by our doings and actions and 
the manner in which we exercise o'urselves in relation to them, that they may 
become sanctified, and that we may show ourselves worthy of the priesthood 
we possess, in establishing God's work, in establishing his laws and every- 
thing that pertains to the celestial glory, just so far as God gives us this 
power, that we may show to the heavens that we are worthy of this Gospel 
and this confidence that God has placed in us, in restoring to us the fulness of 
the holy priesthood. 

And now I will close my remarks by bearing my testimony to the knowl- 
edge of God that I have received in relation to this work. It is true. I re- 
ceived a knowledge of the truth of this work by a physical administration of 
the blessings of God. And when receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost I 
knew I was immersed in a divine principle that filled my whole system with 
inexpressible joy ; and from that day to the present has blessing crowned my 
labors. And when baptizing people and .administering the ordinances of this 
holy priesthood, God has confirmed those administrations by imparting the 
Holy Ghost, giving a knowledge to the individuals to whom I administered, 
convincing them that the authority was delegated from heaven. And every 
Elder who has gone forth to preach this everlasting Gospel, and acted in the 
spirit of his calling, can bear the same testimony, that through their adminis- 
trations in these holy ordinances the glory and power of God has been made 
manifest in a convincing manner upon the heads of those to whom they have 
administered. This is our testimony; this was the testimony fifty years ago 
of a certain individual who stood forth and claimed that God had authorized 
him to baptize people for the remission of sins, and lay hands upon them for 
the reception of the Holy Ghost, which should impart unto them a knowledge 
from the eternal worlds that he had this authority. This person was Joseph 
Smith ; and he conferred this authority, which was given unto him by holy 
angels, upon others who were sent forth to bear testimony to the world that 



82 



FIFTIETH ANNUAL CONFERENCE. 



those who would receive those holy ordinances, should receive the testimony 
from the Almighty that they were thus authorized to so administer. And this 
is our testimony; and this is my testimony before this people and before the 
world. 

And may God bless us ; may he pour out his Spirit upon the Latter-day 
Saints. And may we be faithful in all of our labors, having the motto indelibly 
stamped upon our hearts, "The Kingdom of God or nothing." Amen. 

ELDER WILFORD WOODRUFF. 

"A little one shall become a thousand, and a small one a strong nation: I 
the Lord will hasten it in his time." This is the word of the Lord through 
the Prophet Isaiah. Fifty years has made this little one not only a thousand, 
but more than one hundred thousand, and I do not think it will take half of 
fifty years more to make a strong nation: and if it were not for offending the 
ears of the Christian world, I would quote a word or two from the Prophet 
Daniel, where he says : "Thou sawest till that a stone was cut out of the moun- 
tains without hands, which smote the image upon his feet, that were of iron and 
clay, and break them to pieces. * * And the stone that smote the image 
became a great mountain and filled the whole earth. * * * And it shall 
break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand forever." 
I know it becomes offensive sometimes to the Christian world to quote the 
Bible, therefore I think I will not quote much more of it. But I wish to say 
this is the destiny "of the kingdom of God which is planted here in the moun- 
tains of Israel. But I will take the liberty of asking a question ; I would ask 
it of the Gentile world; I would ask it of the whole Christian world if I had 
a chance and an opportunity, and that is this: If this is the work of the Lord, 
and if the God of Israel has set up a kingdom, undertaken to establish a Church 
and a Zion, I wish to ask — can the inhabitants of the earth help it? Can they 
hinder it? Can they stay the hand of the Lord? I wish the world to reflect 
upon these things. Or will the unbelief of the world make the truth of God 
without effect? Judge ye. Joseph Smith, while in Liberty Jail, while in 
chains and imprisoned, prayed to the Lord — you will find it in the latter part 
of the book of Doctrine and Covenants, page 383 — he prayed to the Lord and 
the Lord answered his prayer. He. told him a great many things, among the 
rest that all things should be revealed in the days of the dispensation of the 
fulness of times, according to that which was ordained in the midst of the 
Council of the Eternal God of all other Gods, before the world was — all these 
things should be revealed in the latter days. Now, says the Lord, "How long 
can rolling waters remain impure? What power shall stay the heavens? As 
well might man stretch forth his puny arm to stop the Missouri River in its 
decreed course, or to turn it up stream, as to hinder the Almighty from pour- • 
ing down knowledge from heaven upon the heads of the Latter-day Saints." 
The powers of earth cannot stay the progress of his Church and kingdom, for 
God has decreed it. And I wish again to say a word or two that is upon my 
mind with regard to my present condition. I have read the Bible, the Book 
of Mormon, and the Doctrine and Covenants a good many times, and they 
have brought me to a condition that I love to trace these revelations like the 
pyramidal histories that have written to the world thatjcomes to an end pretty

soon. And I am about in the same position as the farmer that sees his har- 
vest ripe for the sickle. What must he do? He must go to work and cut it, 
or else it will go back into the ground; and that is the way I view the world 
to-day. It is fifty years since these revelations of God were revealed to 
man. Is not the world ripe? Is not the whole earth covered with whore- 
dom, murder, blasphemy and abominations of every kind, until it rises up in 
the face of high heaven and before the Lord? What will be the result? The 
crop must be reaped ; the harvest is at the door, it is ripe. The Lord said 
fifty years ago to Orson Pratt and others, " The field is ready for the har- 
vest. Now, thrust in your sickle and reap, and any man who will may thrust 
in his sickle and reap." If we are not approaching a change, if the judgments 
of God are not to be poured out upon Babylon, and if there is not a change 
awaiting Zion, then I am at a loss concerning the fulfilment of the revelations 
of God ; I have got about as far as I can go unless these changes are at the 
door. The coming of the Son of Man is near. The signs of heaven and 
earth have indicated this for many years; that is about where I am to-day; as 
an Elder of Israel, as an Apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ, I can see no road 
before me unless I am looking for the judgment of God to be poured out upon 
the wicked, and the judgments will begin at the House of God, and it will go 
forth from them to the world. 

Now, a few words with regard to what Brother Taylor said. In the first 
place, these Apostles here are in the same position that Ezekiel was. The 
Lord said unto him, "Son of man, I have made thee a watchman unto the 
House of Israel; therefore, hear the word of my mouth and give them warn- 
ing from me. When I say unto the wicked, thou shalt surely die ; and thou 
gavest them not warning, nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked 
way to save his life; the same wicked man shall die in his iniqity, but his 
blood will I require at thine hand. Yet if thou warn the wicked, and he turn 
not from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; 
but thou hast delivered thy soul." So I say with regard to the Apostles here, 
as well as the Seventies and High Priests and Elders and Priests — they are 
set here in these latter days upon the walls of Mount Zion as watchmen. I 
tell you we are under a mighty responsibility to God, and I tell you we cannot 
afford, as Apostles, as Seventies, as Elders, and as High Priests, to sit still 
and know that sin reigns in our midst, and not rebuke it; we can not do it, and 
be justified before the Lord. Another thing, if we as Apostles, bearing the 
holy priesthood, use that priesthood for any other purpose under heaven but 
to build up the Kingdom of God, if we do our power will fall like lightning 
from heaven. A good many men have undertaken this — men high in the 
priesthood, even the Apostleship— to build themselves up upon the authority 
of the priesthood. And where have they gone ? You may say amen to their 
power and authority. They have lost their Bishopric and Apostleship. Let 
us reflect on these things. I say the same to myself. I say the same to the 
Apostles, Seventies and High Priests. You cannot u&e the priesthood for any 
other purpose under heaven but to build up the kingdom and do the will of 
God ; and when you attempt to do otherwise your power will be taken from you. 

I wanted to say so much, and now I desire to say another thing. It is our 
jubilee year. I want to give an exhortation. I have heard things during this 



84 



FIFTIETH ANNUAL CONFERENCE. 



Conference that have had an effect upon my mind. I want to say to old and 
young who have been in the habit of doing anything that is not pleasing in the 
sight of God, it is time for us^to lay aside these things. It is time for us to 
lay aside our whiskey, our tobacco, our drunkenness, and everything that lies 
in our path to hinder us in our duty, or we shall be under condemnation. High 
Priests, and Elders, and Apostles, or any other man, cannot bear this priest- 
hood on the earth and revel and drink with the drunken. You cannot do it, it 
is too late in the day; if you do, your power will fall from you. I felt yester- 
day, while Brother Taylor was rebuking these things, to say, Amen. I know 
that Brother Taylor, as leader of this Church and Kingdom, can no more sit 
and hold his peace while these things are going on in Israel, than he can live 
without breathing. It is time for us te repent and turn away from all our 
evils. The responsibility of carrying forward this Kingdom is upon the shoul- 
ders of the Latter-day Saints. 

Now I will say a few words more, and then I will close. I have often 
been asked the question, what condition should a man be in in order to receive 
a recommend to go through the Temple of the Lord? I will tell my feel- 
ings in regard to this matter, and if they are not correct, President Taylor 
and others of the Twelve can correct me. I believe it is too late in the 
day to send men to the Temple who make a daily use of whiskey, or other 
strong drinks, tobacco, &c, and there perform the ordinances for their dead; 
it is not acceptable in the sight of the Lord God of Israel. If we are going 
to be saved, let us build up the Kingdom of God, let us be reasonable and live 
according to what we preach; let us live our religion. I do not believe that a 
man is fit to go into the temples of the Lord to administer these ordinances 
for the living and the dead, who will make a practice of drinking strong drinks. 
What do you drink? Whiskey? No; you drink strychnine; you drink tobacco 
and a great deal of abysinthe, "blue ruin" and death; you drink anything 
under heaven but pure liquor. It can scarcely be said to exist in the land. 
The "stuff that is sold deprives you of your agency, and gives the devil power 
over you; it does so with anybody who makes a practice of using this liquor 
and other intoxicants. No one who uses them is fit to administer in the ordi- 
nances of the House of the Lord. My own faith is that no one is fit to ad- 
minister the sacrament, baptize the children of men, or administer in the 
House of God, unless he in a measure keeps the Word of Wisdom. The 
Spirit of God will not dwell in unholy temples. 

If we are going to build up the Kingdom of God, it is time we commenced 
to keep the commandments of God and live by every word that proceedeth 
from his mouth. Our responsibility is great. It is the Kingdom of God, it is 
no more nor less. It is the Church of Christ; it is the Zion of God that 
every prophet who has ever lived since the world began has seen in vision and 
declared our future history. The revelations of God in the Bible, Book of 
Mormon and Doctrine and Covenants are being fulfilled. We are fulfilling 
them. And while we are here let us be faithful to God, the Great Elohim, the 
God of the Jews as well as the Gentiles. He looks to us and to nobody else. 
He looks to the Latter-day Saints. Why? Because nobody else has received 
the fulness of the everlasting Gospel; nobody else has taken hold to build up 
this kingdom. My faith and feeling about this matter is that we were appointed 



FIFTIETH ANNUAL CONFERENCE. 



before the world was, as much as the ancient apostles were, to come forth in 
the flesh and take hold of this Kingdom, and we have it to do, or be damned. 
That is our position to-day. The eyes of the heavenly hosts are over us ; 
the eyes of God himself and his son Jesus Christ and all those apostles 
and prophets who have sealed their testimony with their blood are watch- 
ing this people. They visit you, they observe your works, for they know very 
well that your destiny is to build up this Kingdom, to build up Zion, sanctify 
it, sanctify the earth and prepare the world for the coming of the Son of Man. 
The judgments of God are at the door of the wicked ; they cannot hinder 
them. The Lord will hold all men and all nations to an account for the deeds 
done in the body, and as Isaiah says in speaking of Zion, "The nation and 
kingdom that will not serve thee shall perish ; yea, those nations shall be 
utterly wasted." These are tremendous sayings. There are hundreds of 
the revelations of God, all of which are going to be fulfilled upon the heads of 
the inhabitants of the earth in the generation in which we are living. Be pre- 
pared, therefore, for that which is to come. There is a change at your door. 
There is a change at the door of this generation. The Lord is watching over 
you, and he will sustain his work. 

May God bless you. May he bless the Apostles, and clothe them with 
his power and with the revelations of Jesus Christ, for I will say as Brother 
Snow has said — I know this is the Kingdom of God. I know that Joseph 
Smith was a prophet of God, and he sealed his testimony with his blood. 
That testimony is in force upon all the world, and it will cost this generation 
just as much to shed the blood of the Lord's anointed to-day as it has cost the 
Jews for shedding the blood of Jesus Christ eighteen hundred years ago. The 
Jews have been scattered, they have been under the bondage of the Gentiles 
for all these years, and they have until recently been denied all political rights. 1 
But the Lord is about to restore them. This is the Kingdom of God. It is 
the Gospel of Jesus Christ. The heavenly hosts are preparing themselves to 
help the fulfilment of the revelations that are recorded in these records. 

The Lord raised up President Young to lead this Church, which he led 
for a generatfon. He has now passed behind the vail, where he labors with 
other Apostles who have furnished their testimony on the earth. The Lord 
has raised up President Taylor. The spirit of wisdom is with him. The 
Lord is blessing him and blessing his brethren. The Lord will stand by us 
and sustain us if we keep his commandments. 

I pray God to bless you and to bless Zion, that we may have power to 
bring these principles home to our hearts, to comprehend in a measure the re- 
sponsibilities resting upon us, for I will say there never was a generation since 
the creation in which the responsibility of the Apostles and Elders was greater 
than that in which we live. 

I am thankful that I have lived to see this day. I have sometimes said I 
have felt lonesome. I look around me and find Joseph and Hyrum and a 
great share of the Twelve have been taken away. They are now in the spirit 
world. We soon shall go there too — myself, Brother Taylor, Brother Pratt and 
many of us are getting grey-headed — we shall soon pass to the other side of 
the vail; but let us do our duty while we are here, and all the rest, old and 
young, that we may inherit eternal life through Jesus Christ. Amen,

FIFTIETH ANNUAL CONFERENCE. 



ELDEB OHSON PRATT. 

I do feel with all my heart to thank the Lord our God for the blessings 
conferred upon this people. Our year of Jubilee, if we may so term it, is past. 
We entered upon it the sixth day of April, 1879 — ^ ast Tuesday was the end of 
it. We are now living in the fifty-first year of the organization of this King- 
dom. At the close, or near the close of this first half century, the Lord has 
been very kind and merciful in behalf of the poor; he has put it into the hearts 
of his servants to administer liberally and bountifully for their good. It is to 
be hoped that the fiftieth year will not close up those great and good acts, on 
the part of the Church, as well as on the part of individuals in the Stakes of 
Zion, for and in behalf of the poor: but that the good work may continue, and 
that all the poor and the needy may be supplied, so far as circumstances will 
permit, with the necessaries of life. So much upon that subject. 

In regard to the future, it has been a duty devolving upon me, in connec- 
tion with hundreds of others, to declare not only the Gospel, but to portray 
before the people future events. There are great things in the future, and we 
are sometimes apt to forget them. We have been looking, for some time past, 
for the Lord to accomplish and fulfill the times of the Gentiles; or the times 
allotted to them, during which the testimonies of his servants should go forth 
among them ; or in other words, the times of the warning of the Gentile na- 
tions, the gathering out of their midst, a few here and there, of the believing 
Gentiles, away from the corruptions of Great Babylon, preparatory to the de- 
structions that are to be poured out without measure upon the Gentile nations. 
These things have been sounded so long in the ears of the Latter-day Saints, 
that I have sometimes thought they have become like a pleasing song, or like a 
dream, and that they scarcely realize that these great events are at hand, even 
at the doors. But if we can depend upon the word of the Lord, if we can de- 
pend upon the predictions recorded in the Scriptures of truth — if we can de- 
pend upon modern revelation which God has given — there is a time of tribula- 
tion, of sorrow, of great judgment, of great wrath and indignation, to come 
upon the nations of the earth, such as has not been since the foundation of 
the world. And these things are not far off, but are near at hand, and who, in 
that day, that has any sympathy in their hearts, any feelings of humanity, but 
will mourn and sorrow over the calamities that will fall upon the nations. I 
know that these things are true. I have known these things ever since the 
autumn of 1830; and I know that God will fulfil his word, and that the day is 
almost at our doors, when God will pour out his indignation, without measure, 
upon the nations of the earth; and they will be swallowed up with judgments 
and calamities of all kinds and descriptions. 

I have sometimes reflected upon a new witness that the Lord seems to 
have brought to light, by the opening of the Great Pyramid of Egypt. There 
are many things revealed by the opening of that Pyramid, nearly 3000 years 
after it was built, that are great and marvellous, so far as I can understand 
them. There seems to be a prophetic spirit running through the construction 
of all that vast superstructure, pointing forward to the very end. Among the 
great events clearly portrayed by that Pyramid, was the organization of this 
Church on the sixth of April, 1830. This is expressed in the construction of the 
" Great Step," in the Grand Gallery of that Pyramid. Time was measured

in that ascending gallery by sacred cubit inches. The measurement from the 
birth of Christ to the upper edge of the " Step," which terminates the ascend- 
ing passage, was exactly 1829 cubit inches, and the fraction of another inch; 
that is, a little over the twenty-sixth hundredth part of an inch. Allowing one 
year to a cubit inch, it gives the sixth of April, 1830, as the exact time, corres- 
ponding to the upper edge of the " Grand Step." At this point the Gallery 
ceases to ascend, and the passage becomes horizontal. This points out the 
very period of time when the Church was organized, and the very day and 
month and year. Sixty-one cubit inches are measured off, from that point in a 
horizontal direction, until you come to the great impending wall r the end of 
the Gallery. What that means, I do not pretend to know. It may mean the 
closing up of the times of the Gentiles. Sixty-one years from the organiza- 
tion of the Church brings us, according to pyramidal testimony, to the end of 
something. Whether these pyramidal symbols are divine or not, there is one 
thing that I do know is true, namely, that the generation in which the fulness 
of the Gospel — the Book of Mormon — was brought forth, is the generation 
that will close up the times of the Gentiles. That I know, if I do not know 
much about the Pyramid. I know the former by revelation. I know that the 
days of the Gentiles are but very few ; the end of the dispensation to them is 
now drawing very near to a close. God has revealed this work. His arm was 
made bare in the restoration of this Church. His arm was made bare in send- 
ing his angels from heaven to restore the everlasting priesthood and authority 
to the children of men. His power was made manifest in the organization of 
the Kingdom that must stand forever. These things are not a matter of opin- 
ion with me. I know them to be true. God revealed them to me in my youth. 
I have known them from that day to this. And the work of God will prosper, 
will prevail, will accomplish that whereunto it is sent, until every nation under 
heaven shall receive sufficient warning, and then will come the terrible, the 
dreadful downfall of Great Babylon. Awake, therefore, O ye inhabitants of 
Zion! Awake to the importance of your duties! Awake to the duties of the 
everlasting priesthood which has been conferred upon you by the servants of 
the living God. Seek after God with all your hearts, with all your souls, and 
with all your might, mind and strength, that you may be prepared for the 
events that are in the future, not only to be preserved when the great desola- 
tions of Babylon shall take place, but also to be partakers in all the blessings 
ordained to be bestowed upon Zion in the latter days. Awake for the redemp- 
tion of Zion is very near, when this people shall possess again their inheri- 
tances upon the promised land; when this people shall erect unto the Lord a 
house and build up that city called Zion, wherein the glory of our God shall 
be made manifest upon all the inhabitants that are counted worthy to dwell in 
the midst thereof. 

May God bless this Conference and the Latter-day Saints everywhere — 
upon the mountains, in the valleys, and throughout the Territories where they 
dwell; that the Spirit of the living God may be with us, with our wives, with 
our children, and with all who desire to serve the living God ; that the destroyer 
may be rebuked from our midst, and that we may rise up as the children of 
Zion, and do the work which the Lord our God requires at our hands. Amen.

FIFTIETH ANNUAL CONFERENCE. 



ELDER CHARLES C. RICH. 

I am thankful for the opportunity of making a few remarks before the close 
of the Conference. The Lord has certainly poured out upon us a goodly de- 
gree of his Holy Spirit, and we have received instructions which, if observed 
and carried out in our lives, will be of everlasting benefit and salvation to us 
as Saints of the Most High God. 

There are certain things that we are in duty bound at all times, to bear in 
mind and never lose sight of, and one of those things is, the requirement of the 
Lord that his Saints should become one. This lesson has been taught to us 
from the very beginning until now, and in it is involved the strength of this 
people. It is a lesson that should first be taught and acted upon in the family 
of every Latter-day Saint; and whenever difficulties arise between neighbors, 
families, or settlements, the first step to be taken by all the parties concerned 
should be to amicably settle the same, and from that time seek to do better, to 
be more respectful to another's feelings, and to really become united as Saints 
of the Most High in the bonds and the covenants of peace. Therefore, my 
beloved brethren and sisters, let us take this matter in hand and see to it; see 
to it that we labor, every man in his individual capacity, to become united, and 
this, too, by laying aside our faults, our follies and our imperfections; and as 
far as possible seek to build up the Kingdom of God on the principles revealed 
unto us from heaven. For most assuredly he will not accept of us or our 
labors on any other terms than those which he himself has dictated. 

And, again, among other things of importance required of us, as a com- 
munity, and which is the work of to-day, is the building of temples in which 
to receive certain blessings essential to our salvation and exaltation in his ce- 
lestial kingdom. He has ordained from before the foundation of our world, 
and has revealed this fact to us in our day, that his people can only receive 
from him certain blessings in certain places — having a special reference to 
those sacred buildings we call temples ; and for this reason are we required to 
perform this work. We have been reminded that the time of the end draws 
near, so near, indeed, that there is no time to spare : and this labor is required 
of us and will have to be performed in a proper time. The Lord said to this 
people at an early day, that if the Saints did not perform a certain work by a 
certain time — referring to to the building of the Nauvoo Temple— that they 
should be rejected, and also their dead. Inasmuch as we were not rejected, 
and now have time and opportunity, let us use the time and improve the oppor- 
tunity to the best advantage and of our ability to perform the work which he 
requires of us, and labor while it is called to-day. I feel that we are a blessed 
people, that the Lord has poured out upon us choice blessings in rich abun- 
dance, and inasmuch as we prove ourselves worthy to receive them on the terms 
which he has proposed, we will find that our Heavenly Father is abundantly 
willing and able to bestow, for surely there is no good thing that will then be 
withheld from us. But I have sometimes thought, judging from the actions of 
some, that they expect to realize the much desired blessing of the future on 
their own terms, as it suits them; it would seem that this was the case with 
some of our brethren, who seemingly want to do nothing unless it suits their 
individual feelings, overlooking partially, if not entirely, the great fact, that 
we have enlisted to do nothing but the will of our Father as it is and shall be

. made known to us through the proper authority. Nor does it matter to us, as 
his faithful servants, what that will may be, whether to build temples or any- 
thing else, we should engage with our whole heart in, the work required of us. 

The results of the labors of this people for half a century are before the 
world, which, although wrought in much weakness, and ofttimes in poverty 
and distress, have been, under the blessing of a merciful,. a just and allwise 
God, crowned with success; and on this, the occasion of our jubilee year just 
closed, I, in common with my brethren, raise my heart and voice in praise to 
him who lives and rules in the heavens above, and in testimony to this being 
his work, even the work to be developed in the latter days, so often spoken of 
in holy writ. And I repeat what has been said that the judgments are nigh, 
even at the door, and this work is going to be fulfilled. Let us open our eyes 
and ears, that we may see and hear as the wise virgins, that we may rightly 
comprehend the nature of the work to be performed, not in some other genera- 
tion, but in the generation in which we live. 

I bear my testimony to the the truth of what we have heard in relation to 
the judgments of God that are to come upon the earth, as well as in relation to 
the truthfulness of this latter-day work. This testimony was given to me 
many years ago, having embraced the Gospel as early as the year 1832, when 
the Lord opened' the vision of my mind and manifested to me that it was of 
him, and that it was the commencement of that work which should eventually 
"fill the whole earth." I know this to be true to-day, and have known it and 
testified, whenever opportunity afforded, to its truthfulness ever since that 
early day: and I bear testimony of it this day before you, my brethren and 
sisters, and to all the world, that this is verily the work of God, and that he 
will fulfil the words that have been spoken to us his Saints concerning all 
things coming on the earth. And to the Latter-day Saints I would say, inas- 
much as we treasure up in good and honest hearts the principles and words of 
life which God has revealed, and live in * consonance with them, we have 
nothing to fear; on the contrary, the faithful will rejoice, not in the downfall 
of the disobedient and wicked, but in the realization of the promised blessings 
in which they will rejoice, both in time and eternity. 

Then, my beloved brethren and sisters, let us awaken to the warnings we 
hear from tune to time, and especially cherish the Spirit, and ponder over and 
improve upon the instructions of this Conference, for they are true and faith- 
ful, and to this you, as well as I, can testify. And when we go to our homes 
let us carry with us and impart the spirit of this Conference to our brethren 
and sisters of the several Stakes who have not been present, that they also 
may take warning and square their lives according to the principles of the 
everlasting Gospel, laying aside everything that is wrong, and doing that 
which is right in all things pertaining to our religion, as Saints of the Most 
High God. And that we may pursue that course which will guarantee unto 
us all the blessings of the new and everlasting Covenant, is my prayer, in the 
name of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER ERASTUS SNOW. 

St. Paul once said, "If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of 
all men most miserable." He said this to the ancient Saints in reference to

the spirit of hatred and persecution raging in the world against the Apostles 
and their followers. I have sometimes thought, when we hear and read of the 
vituperation and lies abroad in the earth concerning this people, when we see 
how they are misrepresented and slandered, it would seem as if the flood gates 
of hell were opened to swallow them up, and we might at times almost despair 
were it not for the assurance that we feel that God is with us, that the Lord of 
Hosts is our God, and he has led us until the present time, and we are en- 
couraged to continue our efforts and labors with the feeling and assurance that 
he has not departed from us, that he has not cast us off, notwithstanding our 
follies and the many evils in our midst, and notwithstanding that the servants 
of God are called upon to speak by way of reproof and ofttimes to rebuke 
with sharpness. God has spoken by one of the ancient prophets in this wise: 
" Faithful are the wounds of a friend; but the kisses of an enemy are deceit- 
ful." The word of the Lord, though it be sharp like a two-edged sword, has 
salvation in it. It is the power of God unto salvation to all them that believe, 
and by the sharpness of the word of God are we brought to comprehend our- 
selves, to see ourselves as God sees us, and to purge evil from our midst. 
And it becomes us to lay to heart the word spoken, and it should begin with 
the Apostles, Presidents of Stakes, Bishops, the Presidents of Quorums, and 
heads of families and run through all the organizations of society, and the 
spirit of repentance, of reformation and of purification should flow in our 
midst, flow through the people in all our organizations until every man, 
woman and child shall feel that the Spirit of God rests upon them; we should 
put away evil, and endeavor to overcome the world, to withstand the influences 
of the hosts of hell, to resist the example of evil minded persons, to resist 
temptations of pride and vanity, and cease to be hypocritical; in other words, 
to be honest before God and one another, for his eye is upon us. Our ways 
are openly known unto him. I,t becomes not his people to seek to hide their 
ways from the Lord. Hypocrites*do this. Many of the Gentile Christians do 
this, as did many of the ancient Jewish Pharisees, for which they were re- 
buked with severity by the teachings of the Savior. None of us need think 
that we shall be benefitted by covering up our uncleanness and expect that we 
shall be sanctified by the outer ordinances of the temple of our God, when 
the inner man is corrupt. There is power in all the ordinances of God's 
house to all those whose hearts are clean, who accept the ordinances of God 
in faith and with purity of purpose. The Gospel of Christ is a savor of life 
unto life to all those that receive it in honest hearts, while it is a savor of death 
unto death to all those that reject and handle the truth in unrighteousness. So 
with all the ordinances pertaining to the priesthood. They bring condemna- 
tion to the hypocrite and evil doer, while they bring sanctification to those 
who are clean in spirit. And the priesthood which we have received with the 
keys and ordinances thereof can only be received and handled in connection 
with the powers of heaven, and on principles of truth and righteousness. The 
Lord has restored all the keys of this priesthood unto Israel in the last days 
through his servant Joseph by the hands of the ancients who held the priest- 
hood before him, who bore the keys of the kingdom when they were upon the 
earth in ancient times; the Apostles Peter, James and John, and John the 
Baptist, from whom he received the priesthood pertaining to the gospel of re-

pentance and baptism for the remission of sins and the promise that this 
priesthood should not again be taken from the earth until the sons of Levi 
should be purified and all that was promised Israel should be fulfilled; and 
however much individuals may fall away from Zion and forfeit their blessings, 
however much men may apostatize from the truth, and iniquity abound, and 
the love of many wax cold, yet the Lord will work in the midst of his people, 
turning and overturning, rebuking and cleansing, until he has performed all 
he has promised. And when the times of the Gentiles shall be fulfilled, the 
power of God will be made manifest in the redemption of the House of Israel. 
As it is written, "And so all Israel shall be saved. There shall come out of 
Zion the Deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob." Knowing 
this, the Apostle Paul says to the Romans, who were Gentiles, "Be not high- 
minded, but fear: For if God spared not the natural branches, take heed lest 
he also spare not thee. Behold, therefore, the goodness and severity of God; 
on them which fell severity ; but toward thee, goodness, if thou continue in 
his goodness: otherwise thou also shalt be cut off." This is the work which 
God has commenced on the earth, to fulfil the promises made to Abraham 
concerning his seed, and the promises made to Joseph concerning his seed, 
the degenerate sons of America, among whom God is working in his own 
marvelous and wonderful manner, preparing their hearts for the changes that 
await them in accordance with his promises, when the cup of iniquity shall be 
filled up in the midst of the Gentiles, and his jndgment shall be poured out 
upon them to break them in pieces as a potter's vessel is broken. 

We are witnesses of these things and know the things whereof we speak, 
and we rejoice in the manifestation of the spirit bearing witness of these things 
among the people of God, and though there are many who are negligent in 
duty, dark in their understanding, covetous in their hearts, worldly minded 
and cling to this world and are more or less beset therewith, yet the Lord is 
working in the midst of his people; for poor, frail, feeble, faulty, sinful as we 
are, taken as a whole, we are the best the Lord has been able to find, and 
►therefore he is not disposed to cast us off, but to reprove, admonish and in- 
struct, that he may make us what he has called us to be in deed and in truth, 
saints of the last days. 

May God help us to keep our covenants, cleanse ourselves from sin, our 
hearts from all hypocrisy, our persons, our habitations, our towns and our 
cities; and may our municipal officers as well as our ecclesiastical officers 
have wisdom, strength, power, nerve, and energy to stem the current of crime, 
to check the progress of drunkenness, whoredom, profanity, and all manner of 
abomination, and execute judgment and justice in the land with firmness, 
vigor, and strength ; and may God bless every officer of the law who magni- 
fies his calling with soberness, diligence, and honesty, and every Apostle, 
President, Bishop, Elder, Priest, Teacher and Deacon who labors to put away 
evil from himself, his household and the community, and every mother in 
Israel who teaches her children righteousness and faith, and every organiza- 
tion for the improvement of the rising generation. May grace and peace be 
multiplied upon them through our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, Amen.

FIFTIETH ANNUAL CONFERENCE. 



ELDER FRANKLIN D. RICHARDS."! 

Forty-two years next June I had become convinced of the truth of the 
principles of the Gospel that had been taught to me, at the age of seventeen 
years; having received the word from the testimony of our aged veteran Joseph 
Young, sen., president of the Seventies, in my native State, Massachusetts. 
I found the principles of the Gospel very harmonious to my feelings, although 
very much opposed to the views of my friends and neighbors. It offered to 
me the ancient blessings restored, if I would but receive them. I considered 
the matter carefully and prayerfully, and ascertained that there was but one 
way of finding out positively whether the Gospel was true or not, or whether 
what was taught to me as the gospel was indeed such; and that the whole sub- 
ject was made to turn upon the saying of the Savior, "If any man will do His 
(the Father's) will he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God or 
whether I speak of myself." And finding that there was only one way to 
come to a demonstration of the matter fairly and honestly, I concluded that if 
those gifts and blessings were restored to the human family, which were an- 
ciently given God's people to enjoy, I wanted to obtain them even at the risk 
of expatriation from my family, my friends and associates upon rendering a 
penitent obedience to the ordinance of baptism for the remission of my sins. 
The Lord answered my prayers, blessed me with an outpouring of the Holy 
Spirit, and gave me a certain revelation therewith, which made me to know 
that he took cognizance of me personally, and that this was none other than 
the great work of God. From that time I have never seen the moment that I 
doubted or felt uncertain or fearful concerning the progress of the work, or 
the ultimate triumph of its outcome. I have not only received such testimony, 
but also many of the various manifestations of the Spirit recorded in the Bible 
and promised in the revelations which mankind have a right, through obedi- 
ence and faithfulness in this mortal life, to enjoy. 

The gifts of prophecy, of tongues and the interpretation of tongues, of 
healing and being healed, and a great variety that we will not take time to 
enumerate, even to the casting out of devils. These gifts and blessings, signs 
and mercies, have been bestowed upon not only myself, but upon my brethren 
of the Council, the faithful Elders, and the Saints generally. It is no strange 
thing among us that any one enjoys these blessings, ail of them having been 
promised unto those who believe and obey the Gospel message. It is only to 
be wondered at that more of us do not get nearer to God and realize more of 
them than we do; it is the only or greatest regret that I have to-day that any 
unfaithfulness on my part in the performance of my duties should hinder me 
from participating more fully in the enjoyment of God's favors, and advancing 
more rapidly in the knowledge of himself and of his ways. 

A man in this Church, who is an Elder in Israel, must have a degree of 
heroism if he is determined to be a servant of God, he must know what it is 
to be able to stand up in the spirit and power of his calling under all circum- 
stances. God requires him to live and serve him with all his heart, with all 
his mind, might and strength ; and to give himself wholly unto the work to 
which he has been called, and to have no other business, on hand except those 
things which are subservient to the interests of his Church and Kingdom. I 
want to say to the brethren, that we as Elders in Israel have come not only to 



FIFTIETH ANNUAL CONFERENCE.

prophecy but to revelation; I testify to you that while you are sustaining the 
Twelve Apostles as such — as the presiding quorum, and as prophets, seers 
and revelators in the Church of Christ, that your faith and prayers are not in 
vain, that God is answering them, that he is fulfilling them in your brethren of 
that quorum, and you will see from time to time more abundantly the fruits, 
blessings and powers resulting therefrom in a greatly increased degree. 
Therefore, continue your union, your faith, and prayers, and God will multiply 
his blessings still more abundantly upon us all. There is more union among 
the brethren of the Council, there is more love and fellowship existing among 
them, they are increasing in those graces and qualities which made the bonds 
of brotherhood strong and powerful to resist successfully the encroaching 
powers of darkness, and to become strong in the name of our God — to ac- 
complish all the work required at our hands. Those graces we see most 
abundantly shining forth in the ministration and counsel of President John 
Taylor who is our leader. 

I want to say, for the benefit of strangers present, that this work in which 
we are engaged, is the Dispensation of the Fulness of Times, in which God 
has promised to gather together in one all things in Christ, be they things of 
heaven or things of earth, or, he might have said all persons and things, for 
that is the fact. All Christendom has become permeated with the belief that 
the second advent of the Savior is approaching and not very far off, so, also, 
the spirit of gathering has commenced, and if you will have your eyes open 
and watch the signs of the times, you will see that the spirit of the gathering 
is becoming more and more widespread, and is reaching Israel in all their 
abidings; they are becoming interested in and waked up to the importance of 
their gathering together. It is not only an item of news that the Israelites 
have got hold of the land of Canaan, but it is a commencement of the work 
that will gather the house of Judah and restore their land to fruitfulness — a 
land which will become glorious ; and the House of the Lord which is to be 
built there is to be far more glorious than the former one. • 

Not only that, but the heavenly tocsin is sounding to the Ten Tribes, and 
they are preparing themselves to come forth and make manifest the power of 
God and be established with his people upon the land of Zion promised. 
And if any of you doubt it, enquire among the Indians of our land and you 
will find that they are having dreams and visions from above, and are beginning 
to enquire after the word of God, and to wonder whether they are cast off and 
forsaken, and to be crowded quite into the sea, or whether the promises made 
to their race by their ancient prophets and patriarchs shall be fulfilled as re- 
corded in the Book of Mormon. 

The Lord has commenced his work and it has taken a firm footing in the 
earth, and he has assured us that he will carry it on; and although we are 
frowned upon by forty millions of people who tell us that we cannot live and 
exercise ourselves in all the ordinances and institutions of Christ's Church in 
this land; let me tell you there are a hundred times forty millions in yonder 
heavens who are watching over and urging us to perform the heavenly re- 
quirements made to us from on high. Which do you think we shall give heed 
to? One of ancient times, when he thought that appearances were rather 
threatening, began to manifest considerable concern. And the prophet 



94 



FIFTIETH ANNUAL CONFERENCE. 



Elisha, seeing the timidity of the young man, prayed unto the Lord to open 
his eyes. Whereupon, we are told, that he saw the mountain on which he 
stood was filled with horses and chariots of fire encircling the prophet round 
about, demonstrating to his entire satisfaction the words of his master which 
were uttered just previously, namely, that "they that be with us are more than 
they that be with them," the forty millions to the contrary notwithstanding. 
Hence then, whom shall we obey? My brethren and sisters, let us obey and 
serve the Most High God, hearken to his counsels and keep the command- 
ments which he has given unto us, even every word that proceeds from his 
mouth, including the "word of wisdom" which he in his goodness has made 
known to us, for anything that is worthy for him to give unto us is worthy for 
us to keep in the most sacred manner. 

Now let me say to the poor — for this conference has been fraught with 
blessing unto them — you who shall be forgiven your back indebtedness upon 
tithing, commence anew to tithe yourselves ; be men of God, take hold of that 
duty and henceforth live determined to honor it with other requirements in the 
Church. The Savior anciently said, in speaking to the Jews, "If ye were the 
children of Abraham, you would do the works of Abraham." One of the 
most prominent features of father Abraham's life was to leave his native land, 
and go to a land which he knew not of, but which the Lord should show him. 
And having done this, there was a time when he was met by the minister of 
God, Melchisedek, when he was on his return from a triumphant victory over 
certain kings, on which occasion Melchisedek congratulated him on his suc- 
cess, when he, as if to reciprocate this minister's kindness, "gave him tithes 
of all," which law of tithing, if you please, he handed down to his generations 
after him. Let us regard it in like manner, for it is a standing law unto us up- 
on this land. And if we do not live it and carry it out, with all other require- 
ments, this, we are told, shall not be a land of Zion unto us. 

And unto the brethren who shall be released from their P. E. Fund in- 
debtedness, I would say, lift up your hearts and be glad, take fresh courage 
when you are released from that obligation, and endeavor to make yourselves 
more useful. Strengthen yourselves in the the name of the Lord; let the 
weak say, I am strong; and let all the people know that the Lord Most High 
is our God, and let us give ourselves wholly to his service. 

Let the poor rejoice in the kindness and liberality of God and their 
brethren to them. Let the rich be glad that God has given unto them the 
means whereby they can bestow blessings upon the poor. 

God requires in his mercy that they who have an abundance shall impart 
with a kindly regard for the destitute, or his blessing will not rest upon them 
and their substance. 

My brethren and sisters, by the authority of the apostlcship God has be- 
stowed upon me, I feel to bless you in all your interests, your wives and 
children and all that pertain to you, your fields, your orchards and gardens, 
your flocks and herds; hoping and praying that we may become more 
abundantly devoted to him, and that he may accept of us and lead us forth 
from faith to faith, and from grace to grace until the little stone rolls down 
from the mountains and fills the whole earth.

May God preserve us in the faith as he has hitherto done, and help us to 
do his biddings so long as we dwell in the flesh, through Christ our Lord. 
Amen. 

ELDER JOSEPH F. SMITH. 

I can bear testimony to the discourses we have had this morning. And I 
can also bear testimony to the great latter-day work in which we are engaged, 
for I know it to be the workot God. 

In regard to the remarks of Brother Pratt, respecting the judgments of 
God that are about to be poured out upon the nations, if the people will take 
the trouble to read the predictions of the prophets concerning them, especially 
those referred to by the angel Moroni, when conversing with the Prophet 
Joseph Smith, at the opening up of this dispensation, I think they will be thor- 
oughly satisfied and convinced, if they have any faith at all, that these coming 
judgments are not matters of mere speculation or supposition, nor of tradition 
handed down from remote ages, but that they are matters of fact, or will be 
ere long, when God shall consummate his designs against the wicked and un- 
godly of the world. For not only have prophets and inspired men declared these 
things, but they have been declared by the voice of the Lord, and by holy mes- 
sengers sent from the presence of God, as well in modern as in ancient times. 

The Angel Moroni, who visited Joseph Smith on the 21st of September, 
1823, quoted the Scriptures concerning these judgments, and declared that the 
predictions of the prophets had not yet been fulfilled, but that they would be 
in this dispensation, and that the beginning was now at hand, even at the 
door. Among these quotations I would like to call your attention to Malachi, 
second chapter: "Behold, I send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way 
before me," etc. "Bui who may abide the day of his coming? And who shall 
stand when he appeareth ? For he is like a refiner's fire, and like fullers' soap, 
and he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver," &c. " And I will come 
near to you to judgment, and I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers, 
and against the adulterers, and against false swearers, and against those that 
oppress the hireling in his wages, the widow, and the fatherless, and that 
turn aside the stranger from the right, and fear not me, saith the Lord of Hosts.'' 

And again, Malachi, 4th chapter — all of which was quoted by Moroni — 
" For behold, the day cometh that shall burn as an oven, and all the proud, 
yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be as stubble, and the day that cometh 
shall burn them up, saith the Lord of Hosts, that it shall leave them neither 
root nor branch." Again, Moroni quoted the nth chapter of Isaiah, in which 
are these words on this subject: "But wiih righteousness shall he judge the 
poor, and reprove with equity for the meek of the earth; and he shall smite 
the earth with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips shall he 
slay the wicked." Again, Acts, 3d chapter, 22d and 23d verses— quoted by 
Moroni just as they read in the New Testament — " A prophet shall the Lord 
your God raise up unto you. * * Him shall ye hear in all things whatso- 
ever he shall say unto you, and it shall come to pass that every soul which 
will not hear that prophet shall be destroyed from among the people." Now 
this is strong language, and to the point. Moroni declared that this prophet 
was Christ at his second coming; that this scripture was not fulfilled, but was 



9 6 



FIFTIETH ANNUAL CONFERENCE. 



about to be fulfilled in the literal coming of the Son of Man to reign upon the 
earth and to execute judgment upon the world. Moroni also quoted Joel, 2d 
chapter, 28th to the 32d verses, declaring that this scripture was also shortly 
to be fulfilled: "And I will show wonders in the heavens and in the earth, 
blood, and fire, and pillars of smoke, &c. And it shall come to pass that who- 
soever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be delivered, for in Mount 
Zion and in Jerusalem shall be deliverance, as the Lord hath said, and in the 
remnant whom the Lord shall call." 

Now, it seems to me that none of the interest or importance of this vital 
subject are lost in the fact that we are not left to the traditions of the fathers 
nor to the written word solely, nor to any uncertain means for the verification 
of these predictions, but rather our interest should be awakened from the fact 
that an angel from heaven, an actual messenger from the presence of God, 
has -re-iterated these very predictions to man on the earth in this generation. 

Some of these passages of scripture quoted by the angel were presumed 
to have been fulfilled in the days of the ancient apostles. Thus the world was 
in ignorance respecting them. All uncertainty upon this subject is now, how- 
ever, dispelled, and the truth is made plain to all. For Moroni declared to 
Joseph Smith that these scriptures had not been fulfilled, but that the set time 
had come when they would be fulfilled, every whit, and the coming of Christ, 
the execution of the judgements, and the ushering in of the final reign of 
peace therein referred to, should be consummated in this dispensation. The 
power of the wicked nations of the earth will be broken. Thrones shall tot- 
ter, and kingdoms fall, while Zion shall arise and shine, and put on her beau- 
tiful garments, and be clothed with power, wisdom, majesty and dominion upon 
the earth. Babylon must fall to rise no more. As a servant of the Lord I 
have received a testimony in relation to these things, and in connection with 
my brethren I am thankful to have the privilege of bearing that testimony, 
which I do in all solemnity before God and man, and am willing and ready to 
meet the consequences, If I continue faithful, at the bar of final judgment. 
And I further testify, that unless the Latter-day Saints will live their religion, 
keep their covenants with God and their brethren, honor the priesthood which 
they bear, and try faithfully to bring themselves into subjection to the laws of 
God, they will be the first to fall beneath the judgments of the Almighty, for 
his judgments will begin at his own house.' Therefore, those who have made 
a covenant with the Lord by baptism, and have broken that covenant, who 
profess to be saints and are not, but are sinners, and covenant-breakers, and 
partakers of the sins of Babylon, most assuredly will " receive of her 
plagues," for it is written that the righteous will barely escape. This is my 
testimony in relation to these matters. We rely upon the word of the Lord 
in these things, and not upon the word of man, for not only has angels, but 
God Almighty has spoken from the heavens in this our own age of the world, 
and we know his word is true. 

That we as a people may be prepared not only for the judgments, but for 
the glory and coming of our Lord, that we may escape the calamities to be 
poured out upon the wicked, and receive the welcome plaudit of the faithful 
servant, and be counted worthy to stand in the presence of the Lord in his 
glorious kingdom, is my prayer, in the name of Jesus. Amen.

ELDER ALBERT CARRINGTON". 

In several places in the Book of Mormon you have read, or can read, that 
our Faither in the heavens, in revealing his will concerning the inhabitants of 
North and South America, made known that inasmuch as they would keep 
His commandments they should prosper; but inasmuch as they did not keep 
his commandments, they should be cut off from his presence. Do we flatter 
ourselves that we are naturally better than our brethren and sisters, of the 
numerous family of Adam, who lived in the days of the Jaredites, or in the 
days of the Nephites ? They were wealthy and powerful nations, and when 
they worked righteousness, observing the will of our kind, wise Father in the 
heavens, they prospered exceedingly; but as they transgressed the require- 
ments designated for their welfare, they dwindled to destruction. 

We, as Latter-day Saints, are under the same requirements as have been 
all previous occupants of this continent, to whom the everlasting Gospel has 
been preached, to seek unto, love and serve the Lord our God, if we would be 
kindly regarded by Him. Do we natter ourselves that we will be so regarded 
in any other course? If so, we are unwisely deceiving ourselves. 

I rejoice in the great blessings we have enjoyed during this Conference. 
I rejoice in the strength, power and truthfulness of the testimonies we have 
been blessed with. I rejoice in observing the increase of that spirit of union 
that we must attain to, to be indeed Saints of the Most High God. And I feel 
to add my testimony to the testimonies of my brethren, that this great latter- 
day work is verily the work of the true and living God, and He will carry it on 
to victory over all the opposition of the powers of earth and evil. This every 
faithful Latter-day Saint knows, whatever the world may think or imagine to 
the contrary; however much they may oppose in their blindness, through way- 
wardness, stupidity and ignorance in the midst of their fancied intelligence 
and power. The Lord our God is infinitely more powerful than the numbers 
and powers of earth and darkness combined, and we have only to be careful 
to be His Saints, and all will be well with us. We know this, and I would 
that our brethren and sisters of the world would wisely realize these facts. 

When I look forward to the near future, that has been so much spoken of 
in this our day, and so plainly prophesied of from the beginning, and contem- 
plate the terrible calamities that are to befall those who reject the Gospel and 
oppose the work of God, do I feel in the least to exult over their downfall? I 
feel that it will be a day of sorrow and mourning; that it will be painful even 
to hear the report of the going forth of the wise and just judgments of our 
Father upon the heads of the wicked— those of our fellow-beings who have 
preferred to do evil. 

I take great pleasure in being able to add my testimony to the testimonies 
of my brethren to the fact, which all the world cannot truthfully gainsay, that 
Joseph Smith was and is a true prophet of the true and living God ; that he 
died, as he had lived, honoring and glorifying our Father in Heaven; that he 
laid the foundation of this great work, in which we are engaged, broad and 
deep, according to the mind and will of God, and consummated every require- 
ment which devolved upon him. 

That we may be and continue faithful, and be saved with a complete sal- 
vation in the Celestial Kingdom of our God, I pray in the name of Jesus. Amen-

FIFTIETH ANNUAL CONFERENCE. 



ELDEE MOSES THATCHER. 

Would it not be well, my brethren and sisters, to reflect, after the close 
of this Conference, in reference to our individual acts during our past exper- 
ience in the Church? Would it not be well to ask ourselves the question 
whether we shall be prepared in the future to receive that measure which we 
have meted out to others ; whether we shall be satisfied with that judgment 
with which we have judged others; whether we have followed the whisperings 
of the Spirit of God; whether we have been humble, prayerful, faithful and 
true? It would be well for us, I think, to reflect upon these points, and 
wherein we are satisfied we have not lived up to our privileges, let us as far as 
possible make amends and start again, rejoicing before the Almighty. 

I am pleased to be able to add my humble testimony to those to which you 
have listened this morning. I know that this is the Churah of Christ. I 
know that we have Prophets, Seers and Revelators. I know that every bless- 
ing which the Lord Jesus Christ has promised is within the reach of this peo- 
ple, if they will live so that they can claim them. I can bear my testimony 
that Joseph Smith was a prophet of God; that he with his natural eyes saw 
the face of angels; that he heard the voice of God; that he heard the voice of 
the Lord Jesus Christ; and that he received the Aaronic and Meldhisedec 
priesthood. I can bear my testimony that he sealed his testimony with his 
blood, and that therefore it is in force upon the whole world. His brother 
Hyrum died by his side, and the blood of our venerated and respected Presi- 
dent, who presides to-day over the quorum of the Twelve Apostles, was 
mingled with their blood, and stands also as a testimony before this nation and 
before this people. I know that he is led to-day by the revelations of the 
Lord Jesus Christ, and I can bear my testimony that when you raise your 
hands to sustain him as a Prophet, Seer and Revelator, that God hears and 
answers your prayers. There is this spirit of revelation in the midst of the 
people. I know it in every fibre of my nature, Iknow it in every sense of my 
being, and I thank God that He has given me this testimony. I know also in 
reference to the judgments that are to be poured out upon the earth. Enough 
has been revealed to make me feel sorrowful and frequently like shedding bit- 
ter tears. I have no feeling of enmity against our government. I have no 
feeling of bitterness against a living human being, wicked though many may 
be, because their sorrows will be more than they can bear, and the judgments 
of the Almighty, when they come to be poured out, will touch the hearts Of 
the Latter-day Saints and cause them to retire to their closets and secret 
places and weep because of the desolation and ruin that will be brought upon 
this and other nations. I can also bear my testimony that the preaching of 
righteousness is accomplishing a great work among the remnants of Israel, 
and that the poor Indians, who have been despised and hated through the ig- 
norance, bigotry, and folly of the wicked, will yet arise and stand forth in their 
manhood; the Lord Jesus Christ will bring them out of their bondage and ful- 
fil all the words of the prophets concerning them, that are recorded in the 
Book of Mormon. 

May God bless the Latter-day Saints. May we march on to perfection, to 
liberty, and to the power of God unto salvation, is my earnest prayer, in the 
name of Jesus. Amen. 



FIFTIETH ANNUAL CONFERENCE. gg 

PRESIDENT JOHN TAYLOR. 

little^ W W k6 H P ° n ^ l0ng6r ' ° r Sha11 We 1 uit? 1 think we have a 

little time. We adjourned the first day of our meeting because it was rather 
cold and now it is not quite so cold, and we will stayt little longer. I have 
felt a desire to hear the testimony of my brethren of the Twelve, and that of 
our Counselor who is here. All of the Twelve are present except one he i 
at his post, attending to the interests of Zion. And we will pray for hi m that 

tliis p^l'e 6 h SUStain PreSerVG hIm ' - d 

There are a few things I want to speak upon, and I realize that while I 
and my brethren are speaking, we are not only speaking to this congregation, 
but to others-to the Saints throughout this and adjoining Territories - to the 

m nf T\l { Unit£d StateS t0 thG W ° rld ^ because our teSny will 
go forth to them. J 

There are many things which I wish to draw the attention of the brethren 
to, that they may not lose sight of them. One is Co-operation. We have a 
number of Co-operative institutions; we have one here, which may properly 
be denominated the parent institution ; we have also many others, and we wish 
to sustain them, and to do it not nominally, but really in our hearts, and with 
honesty of purpose; and do everything we do on that principle, without hy- 
pocrisy of any kind, in truthfulness before God, and operating together for the 
welfare of Israel. But Co-operation is not a system only for importing goods 
and selling them; we want to co-operate in home manufactures. We have 
done considerable of that, and we desire to do more of it. The Co-operative 
Store here has, I presume, as much as two hundred men at work in all— about 
140 to 150 making shoes, and about 50 or 60 making certain kinds of clothing; 
and we want to see these things increased, until we can make all our ovv'n 
clothing right here at home ; and instead of having to employ tailors abroad 
to make it tor us, we want, as quickly as practicable— and I think it is practica- 
ble now— to make it ourselves. I mean the clothing which is imported here; 
and then, instead of employing comparatively only a few men, use all of our 
own labor; let our factories be run on double time and use our own wool at 
home, instead of exporting it, and thus increase the means of employment and 
be self-sustaining. And then if we could get some of the best machinery for 
the manufacture of hats, that would be another commendable enterprise, be- 
cause we use a large number. I see there are a great many heads here,' and 
there are a great many more in the Territory, all needing hats— and if we should 
supply them ourselves it would be much better than to take the other course. 

Then there are some that are trying to engage in the United Order, up 
and down in different parts, especially far off in the South. They have our 
blessing and our prayers. I say God bless them in all their attempts to ap- 
proach that order which is instituted of God. We have not got at it yet, by 
and by we will come to it; but in the meantime we will approach it as near as 
we can. God is pleased with the action of this people in their liberality 
towards the poor. Now be liberal one towards another, and help and relieve 
one another, and God will relieve and bless you. 

Speaking again of Co-operation we have what are called Boards of Trade, 
and it is expected that they will operate and co-operate with our central insti- 



IOO 



FIFTIETH ANNUAL CONFERENCE. 



tution. A meeting of that kind will be held this afternoon, therefore I do not 
wish at this time to say much upon that subject. 

There is a subject I wish to speak a little upon to High Councils, to Bish- 
eps, to Bishops' Counselors and to the Presidents of Stakes particularly; but 
as we shall hold a priesthood meeting, what I am about to refer to can be more 
fully talked of then; but I will allude to it briefly here. Reference was made 
by one of the speakers to a revelation contained in the Doctrine and Cove- 
nants, in which we are given to understand that the priesthood is given unto 
us, not for our own aggrandizement, nor to advance our own interests, but to 
build up the Church and Kingdom of God upon the earth, acting upon the 
principles of justice, equity and righteousness, as you are yourselves willing 
to be judged — and will be judged, before the Great I AM, when the time comes 
that we shall have to give an account of our stewardship. We want no favor- 
itism shown to any man, or to any woman, or to any set of men, but in the ad- 
ministration of justice to do it as in the sight of God, with integrity of heart 
and uprightness; anything different from this cannot receive the approbation 
of God. And furthermore, this priesthood is not conferred upon men to ex- 
ercise any degree of unrighteousness or tyranny, or to in any way oppress or 
injure anybody; but if any man use his priesthood to subserve any such pur- 
pose, God will take hold of him, as the Priesthood above him will take hold 
of him, and he will be removed out of his place except he repent. 

Another thing. 'The Lord has given unto us our various Courts — Bishops' 
Courts, High Councils, etc., and it is expected that the Saints will adjust any 
matters of difficulty or dispute that may arise among them, before those courts, 
and that they do not go to law before the ungodly; and if any do so, I will 
promise them, in the name of the Lord God of Israel, that they will be de- 
stroyed by the ungodly. Hear it, you Elders of Israel, and you Saints of lat- 
ter days! Let us seek in the first place among ourselves to execute judgment 
in righteousness, and then let every man and every woman submit to them. 
That is God's law, and any man that acts contrary to this law cannot go into 
the temples of the Lord to receive the ordinances of God's house. For if we 
cannot submit to the law of God on the one hand, we cannot receive the bless- 
ings through his ordinances, on the other hand. Is that right? [The con- 
gregation answered, Yes.] 

Again. I have been very much interested in our Sabbath School opera- 
tions, and should have been pleased to have been present at the general meet- 
ing of the Sunday School Union, last evening, but having so much labor on 
hand, I thought it better to rest. But I am interested in the cause of our Sun- 
day Schools, and so are my brethren of the Twelve. God has given unto us 
the most precious of gifts— children, and has placed us over them as the 
fathers and mothers of lives. They are eternal beings, and it should be our 
constant care to train them up in the fear of God. And we want the Bishops 
and the Presidents to sustain them, which I believe they do, and all good 
brethren and all good sisters should take an interest in the welfare of the ris- 
ing generation, and do all they can to train the children in the fear of God. 
And God will bless you in your labors and desires, and the youth of Zion will 
rise up and call you blessed. And let no man or woman shirk the responsi- 
bility of teaching the children when it is put upon him or her. 



FIFTIETH ANNUAL CONFERENCE. 



IOI 



And then, our Young Men's and Young Women's Mutual Improvement 
Associations are very good institutions, and the Lord is blessing them, and he 
will continue to bless them; and we desire to see them encouraged in their 
operations throughout the land, that the principles of righteousness, truth and 
purity may be promulgated and sustained ; and that vice, evil, corruption, and 
infamy may be frowned upon, and the right honored and maintained; and 
that our youth may grow up as plants of renown and become mighty men 
and women in Israel, filled with the gift of the Holy Ghost and the power 
of God. 

Again, in regard to the Relief Societies. They are doing a great deal of 
good, and I say, God bless the sisters, and let all the congregation say Amen. 
[The vast congregation said, Amen.] Sisters, continue your labors of love, 
and continue to propagate good, virtuous and holy principles; teach your 
daughters, and also your sons, principles of holiness and purity; and seek out 
the poor and distressed and minister to them, and God will bless you in your 
labors. We thank you, and I thank you in behalf of the Twelve, and in be- 
half of the people, for the liberal vote you gave us yesterday in regard to sup- 
plying the poor and the necessitous with the grain that you have stored — 
something which we, who profess to be so much more intelligent, have not 
been able to do. God bless you; continue your good works and adhere to the 
principles of right and truth, and God will bless you, and he will bless your 
sons and daughters, and your names will be honored in Israel, and you will be 
honored by God and the holy angels. 

Again, in regard to the building of temples, we are engaged in doing a 
good work. Our Salt Lake Temple is progressing very nicely, and we expect 
it will go forward as usual, only a little more so, next season. I would say in 
regard to this temple — there were some remarks made about no reports having 
been made. This is true; the people here have been careless and indifferent, 
at the same time a large amount of means has been used on it, and why the 
report has been omitted, I do not know. And the building known as the Salt 
Lake Assembly Hall has been erected within a short time, at a cost, I suppose, 
of not less than $100,000; besides attending to other things. I have no com- 
plaint to make, only we will try and do a little better; and when you are called 
upon to furnish quarry hands, be a little more prompt about it, and do not be 
backward ; and when you are called upon to furnish men to assist us here, do 
not be backward about it. And we will try and improve, one and all, upon our 
past labors in relation to these things. In Logan and Manti we have two tem- 
ples under construction, and when finished they will be a credit to the people. 
We are trying at least to carry out the word and will of God in this direction, 
and he is helping us to do it. We will build our temples and administer in 
them, and stand forth as the priests of the Most High God, administering sal- 
vation to the living and for the dead. And then, we will continue to send 
forth, as we are doing, our missionaries to the nations of the earth. Although 
they do not, very frequently, receive us very kindly, but no matter; they did 
not receive Jesus, nor the prophets in ancient times, very kindly. The laws 
of God, nor the servants of God, never were received very kindly upon the 
earth, except for about two hundred years upon this continent; but the time is 
coming when the Saints of the Most High God will take the kingdom and 



102 



FIFTU.TH ANNUAL CONFERENCE. 



possess it, and reign for ever and ever; and he whose right it is will come 
and take the possession. 

I will speak a little in regard to our government. We complain a good 
deal about the way we have been treated. Well, we have been treated very 
scurvily, it is true — everybody will admit that — but we must consider the cir- 
cumstances : they are not of our faith, they do not believe as we do, they have 
their ideas, and theories, and notions, and so have other nations as well as 
this. Well, what shall we do? We will do the very best we can. Do you 
think you could improve your condition in any other nation or under any other 
government, or receive any better treatment than you do in this? I tell you 
no, you could not. We here, at least, have the form and — I was going to say, 
the guarantee of liberty; that is, the promise of the guarantee. We have the 
form, but it is like a religion without the power. What shall we do ? Consign 
everybody to damnation and destruction? No. Who are they? They are 
God's children. Would he like to see them reform? He would; and he has 
told us to try to do it. If we had children that had gone astray, would we not 
like to see them reform? Yes, we would, and if our children do anything 
wrong we tell them of it, and we try to reform them. We will therefore con- 
tinue to go to this nation as we have done, as saviors, with the message of life 
and salvation, and we will pray for the honest, the upright and virtuous, and 
those who love righteousness, and those who are willing to accord to men 
equal rights, and a great many who are not; and we will do them all the good 
we can. We will sustain the government in its administration, and be true to 
it, and maintain this position right along. And when division, strife, trouble 
and contention arise, we will try to still the troubled waters, and act in all 
honesty as true friends to the government; and when war shall exist among 
them, and there is no one found to sustain the remnants of liberty that may be 
left, the Elders of Israel will rally round the standard of freedom and proclaim 
liberty to all the world. These things will assuredly take place, and when they 
do our motto will be as it now is, "Peace on earth and good will to men." 
These are our sentiments and feelings in relation to these matters. But while 
we feel liberal, generous and kind to all men of all nations, classes and creeds, 
we have no fellowship with unrighteousness ; we do not believe in the actions 
of many men, nor in their corruptions and evils ; we want to purge ourselves 
from them and stand forth aloof as servants of God in the midst of a crooked 
and perverse generation, and try in all fidelity, in the interests of our common 
humanity, to bear off the government of God triumphantly. 

I would also say a little about the P. E. Fund. While we have relieved a 
great many, to the amount of $800,000, of their indebtedness, which is right 
before God and all honorable men; there are a great many poor Saints 
among the nations yet. And we want those who are not forgiven — for we 
shall not forgive those that are able to pay and do not do it — to come forward 
and meet their obligations. And then, if there are those that are desirous of 
assisting any in this direction, who have it in their hearts to do so, and to im- 
part a blessing to their friends in foreign lands, let them come forward and 
present their means to Brother Carrington, who is President of the Perpetual 
Emigration Fund Company, and he will see that the means are properly ap- 
plied. We do not want to close up this avenue of relief to the scattered poor, 



FIFTIETH ANNUAL CONFERENCE. 



I03 



but we wil} continue our efforts to gather Israel. And further; we will con- 
tinue to build temples, and to administer in them, and we will also continue to 
preach the Gospel, until the word of the Lord be fulfilled pertaining to this 
and other nations, and then he will say, Turn to the Jews, go to the House of 
Israel, the cup of the Gentiles is full. This time has not come yet. 

Now, in regard to these matters, God is our God in whom we put our 
trust; we have nothing ourselves to boast of. Have we wealth ? Who gave 
it to us? The Lord. Have we property? Who put us in possession of it? 
The Lord. Our horses, cattle and sheep, our flocks, herds and possessions, 
are his gifts. The gold and the silver and the precious things of earth, and 
also the cattle upon a thousand hills, are his, and we are his, and in his 
hands, and all nations are in his hands, and he will do with us and with them 
as seemeth him good. And as a kind, wise Father, he will watch over their 
interests ; and when the time of judgment comes, it will not be withheld. We 
ought always to remember that our strength is in God; we have nothing to 
boast of ourselves, we have no intelligence that God has not given unto us; 
we have nothing in life, or property, but what has been given unto us of the 
Lord. Everything we possess pertaining to time and eternity has been im- 
parted to us by him. Let us then act as Saints of God in all humility, with- 
out rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation. I say God 
bless you, and God bless my brethren of the Twelve, and God bless my bieth- 
ren of the Seventies, and God bless my brethren of the High Priesthood, and 
God bless the Presidents of Stakes and their Counselors, and God bless the 
Bishops and their Counselors, and the Elders, Priests, Teachers and Deacons, 
our missionaries laboring in foreign lands, and all the Holy Priesthood, and 
God bless all the Saints. And let us all seek to do our duty and honor and 
magnify our calling. Fear God and keep His commandments, and the peace 
and blessing of God will abide with us from this time henceforth and forever. 
And I now testify, as my brethren have done, that this is the work of God 
that has been revealed by the Almighty, and I know it. And God will sustain 
Israel, and no power can injure us if we will do what is right; and this king- 
dom will roll on, and the purposes of God will progress, and Zion will arise 
and shine, and the glory of God will rest upon her. And we will continue to 
grow and increase until the kingdoms of this world shall become the kingdoms 
of our God and his Christ, and he will reign for ever and ever. Amen.

CIRCULAR FROM THE TWELVE JIPOSTLES. 



Salt Lake City, U. T., April 16th, 1880. 

To the Presidents of Stakes and Bishops of the several Wards: 

Dear Brethren: — During the annual Conference begun in this city on the 
6th inst.j the Trustee in Trust, with the unanimous approval of the Apostles 
and Counselors, deemed it a fitting opportunity on the fiftieth anniversary of 
the organization of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and at 
the close of the Year of Jubilee, to propose remitting some $800,000, or one- 
half of the indebtedness to the Perpetual Emigrating Fund Company, by the 
worthy poor who are struggling with adversity, unable to pay, and with but 
little prospect of ever being able. This very liberal proposition was cordially 
sustained by the unanimous vote of the vast congregation, composed of 
authorities and members from all regions of our settlements. 

That these remissions may be applied in the wisest manner possible, the 
Bishops of the several wards are hereby respectfully requested to at once 
proceed to learn who of those indebted to the P. E. Fund Company they may 
deem entitled to the benefit of the aforenamed remissions, and write down 
names, ages, year of immigration and post office address, with a few of the 
principal reasons why they recommend a remission, and forward all such 
recommends to their several Presidents of Stakes. 

The Presidents of Stakes are also respectfully requested to at once care- 
fully examine the aforesaid recommends from the Bishops ; endorse thereon 
their approval or disapproval, with or without remarks, as the may please, and 
forward to the President or clerk of the P. E. F. Co., Box B, this city, for con- 
sideration and final action by the proper authorities here, and their action 
thereon will be made known to the parties concerned through their bishop as 
speedily as may be. 

In case a bishop shall deem it more proper to recommend remitting only 
a part of an indebtedness, he will recommend accordingly, as aforenamed, 
specifying the amount. 

DELINQUENT TITHING REMITTED. 

At the general Jubilee Conference, April, 1880, President John Taylor 



FIFTIETH ANNUAL CONFERENCE. 



107 



proposed, and the Conference voted that the deserving poor have their delin- 
quent tithing remitted throughout the whole Church, to the amount of one-half 
the total of all the delinquencies; under such regulations as shall be approved 
by the Stake Presidents and the Apostles. The Presidents of Stakes and 
Bishop's agents are therefore respectfully requested to ascertain from the 
books in the several wards under their jurisdiction the amount of all such de- 
linquencies, and, at an earlyday, a list of names and the wards whei'e found, 
with the amounts recommended for remittal, which should include all delin- 
quencies of persons, generally well disposed, but who, by reason of losses, 
affliction, helpless families or missionary labors, have been unable to pay, and 
such amounts of other delinquents as may be deemed right and proper, in ac- 
cordance with the spirit of the Conference. Should the total amounts so 
recommended for remission amount to less or more than one-half the total de- 
linquency of your Stakes respectively, it will be adjusted and equalized as far 
as practicable, and as shall be deemed to be just by the Presiding Bishop, 
with the approval of the Apostles. The several agents should consult with 
bishops, and make up lists to be submitted to the Stake Presidency, which, 
after such modifications as they deem advisable, should be signed by them and 
the Bishop's agents for the Stake, and forwarded to the Presiding Bishop of 
the Church. 

We need not remind you that neither favoritism nor prejudice should in- 
fluence anyone in these matters, but only an earnest desire to make the yoke 
easy and the burden light. 

DONATION OF COWS AND SHEEP. 

On the suggestion of President John Taylor and his brethren of the 
Council of Apostles, by common consent, as expressed by the unanimous vote 
of the Saints in Conference assembled, on April 7, 1880, one thousand good 
young milch cows and five thousand head of healthy sheep were appropriated 
for the relief of the deserving poor Saints in Zion. Three hundred of the 
former and two thousand of the latter were subscribed by the Church, and the 
remainder as a donation by the several Stakes, as expressed by the vote of 
the Presidencies of the Stakes and Bishops of the wards, who were present at 
the meeting. 

In order that a proper apportionment may be determined, the Presidents 
of the several Stakes are requested to ascertain and report to the Trustee in 
Trust as speedily as possible the number of cows and sheep that will be re- 
quired to relieve the worthy poor in their Stakes. 

A prompt report, giving the names and residences in full of such as the 
Bishops recommend, and whom you can endorse as being worthy and needy, 
will enable us to determine at once, and inform you of how many head of each 
it will be necessary for you to furnish. In securing subscriptions, it would be 
well as far as possible to make, at at the same time, distributions as you may 
think proper. 

Being aware of the object of this charitable measure, you will, we feel 
assured, perceive the importance of being thorough, prompt and energetic in 
its accomplishment.

FIFTIETH ANNUAL CONFERENCE. 



THE LOANING OF RELIEF SOCIETY WHEAT. 

To the President of the Central Grain Committee, and Presidents of the 
various Branches of the Relief Society in Salt Lake City and through- 
out the Stakes of Zion, having in charge stored Wheat: 

In accordance with a unanimous vote of the sisters present at our late 
general Conference, we recommend that you loan to your respective bishops 
so much wheat as they may consider requisite to meet the necessities of the 
deserving poor. 

We also recommend that the bishops receipt to you and take receipts from 
those to whom they distribute, that the wheat loaned maybe faithfully returned 
when circumstances shall permit. 

We realize that our sisters have performed a highly commendable and 
praiseworthy labor in storing wheat for future emergencies, and we trust that, 
inasmuch as the wheat is loaned without interest, the bishops, in carrying out 
the above measures, will see that they receive a full equivalent for their loans, 
taking into consideration the losses in changing, as well as the difference be- 
tween old and new wheat as to quality and quantity. The shrinkage is sup- 
posed to be about ten per cent. The bishops should be responsible for the 
return of the wheat, hence they should loan on good security and to such per- 
sons as will return the same according to agreement. It should be loaned 
mainly for seed. The Tithing Office will in no case be responsible for the 
return of the whole or any part thereof. 

THE FORGIVENESS OF DEBTS TO THE WORTHY POOR IN ZION. 

At our recent Annual Conference, the Church, by common consent, re- 
mitted one-half of the people's entire indebtedness to the Perpetual Emigrating 
Fund Company, and one-half the amount due on back tithing account, aggre- 
gating about $875,900. This^amount to apply to the cancellation of the obli- 
gations of the worthy poor on their emigration and tithing accounts, thus free- 
ing them from a burden which they have been unable to honorably cast off. 
To all such, in this regard, we offer a jubilee. The power of God moving the 
hearts of the Saints still further, caused them to appropriate, for the relief of 
the deserving poor of Zion, one thousand head of cows and five thousand 
head of sheep. In addition to this, the Relief Societies, with a liberal gen- 
erosity, offer to loan to the needy some thirty-four thousand bushels of wheat 
until after harvest, without interest. 

With these worthy examples, as the fruits of the gospel before us, we wish 
to extend to all our brethren and sisters the privilege of aiding in this good 
work of compassion and love. We respectfully remind those who have the 
riches of this world more abundantly bestowed upon them, that they have a 
fitting opportunity of remembering the Lord's poor. If you hold their notes 
and they are unable to pay, forgive the interest and the principle, or so much 
thereof as you might desire them to forgive were their and your circumstances 
reversed, thus doing unto others as you would that others should do unto you. 
For upon this hang the law and the prophets. If you have mortgages upon 
the homes of your brethren and sisters who are poor, worthy and honest, and 
who desire to pay you but cannot, free them in whole or in part. Extend to

them a jubilee, if you can consistently. You will have their faith, prayers and 
confidence, which may be worth more than money. We invite Zion's Co-op- 
erative Mercantile Institution as the parent; all other co-operative institutions 
as the children and our brethren who are engaged in profitable railroad, banking, 
mercantile, manufacturing or other remunerative enterprises, to extend a help- 
ing hand. Free the worthy debt-bound brother if you can. Let there be no 
rich among us from whose tables fall only crumbs to feed a wounded Lazarus. 
Rather let us each and all do our part honorably, justly, charitably and well. 
The Church of Christ has given us a worthy example, let us follow it, so that 
God may forgive our debts as we forgive our debtors. By so doing, you will, 
as Jesus says, "Make unto yourselves friends with the mammon of unrighteous- 
ness, that when ye fail, they may receive you into everlasting habitations." 

That all these matters may be carried promptly to a successful issue, we 
advise the Presidencies of the several Stakes and the Bishop's agents, to pro- 
ceed at once to visit all the wards therein, holding meetings in order to ar- 
range all these matters while making their visits. By this means they will 
more readily accomplish what is herein required, and have their minds relieved 
of the responsibilities relating thereto. Those needing wheat for seed must 
of course have it soon in order that it may be available for that purpose this 
season; while those needing cows and sheep will appreciate promptness in 
their delivery. 

John Taylor, 
In behalf of the Council of Apostles. 



TO ALL PRESIDENTS AND BISHOPS. 

In addition to items contained in our Circular, we call attention to persons 
removed from your wards leaving unsettled tithing accounts. All balances 
against them should be promptly forwarded to the bishops where they now 
reside, if known, and if their present residence be unknown to you, send it to 
the Presiding Bishop, so that such old accounts may be considered and in- 
cluded in the recommendations of bishops for cancellation. An entry should 
be made in your books showing the transfer of such old accounts, that they 
may not be longer reported among your delinquencies. 

In behalf of the Apostles. 

John Taylor, 

President. 



HO FIFTIETH ANNUAL CONFERENCE. 

THE YEAR OF JUBILEE. 



{April 

God of our Fathers, we, this day 

Our voices raise in sacred song, 
And in it our glad homage pay — • 

This tribute doth to thee belong! 
Thine hand has been our staff and stay, 
Thy power has lit our darkest day, 
And Israel, blind, this day can see 
The first glad Year of Jubilee ! 

In all the past, Ihy people, thou 

Hast led with more than Father's care, 
And every trial, then or now, 

From foes within or foes elsewhere 
Hath testimony brought, as rain 
Upon the parched and desert plain 
Gives life and gladness, fresh and free, 
A sure perennial jubilee! 

What more could'st thou for us have done? 

What blessing hast thou e'er denied? 
In eastern lands thou wert our sun, 

As on Ohio's praries wide; 
And when Missouri's hate was keen, 
When from Far West we fled unseen 
We hailed afar the yet to be — 
This blessed Year of Jubilee! 

When by the Mississippi's stream, 

The Temple lifted high in air, 
Beauteous as any poet's dream, 

"City of Joseph," wondrous fair; 
Thou did'st thy people succor then 
When martyred prophets fell, as when 
From death thy thousands had to flee 
To wait this Year of Jubilee! 

Thy people's enemies have met 

The fate which prophets did portray, 

Their sun in darkness quickly set 
And with it all their jocund day; 

Nq more to them thy Saints shall bow, 

No more receive their ready blow. 

This is our triumph, surely we 

Enjoy our Year of Jubilee! 



6, 1880.) 

Here, 'mid the mountains peace hath dwelt; 

"Rest for the weary" hath been found; 
Here many a bursting heart hath felt 

Far from the hated war cry's sound, 
As 'twere a heaven already won 
'Neath the unclouded western sun. 
These had no need to wait for Thee, 
In peace they had their Jubilee! 

Oh swelling hearts! A cup run o'er, 
With mercies, blessings, is your lot; 

And there's "a fulness" yet in store, 
In heaven the Saints are unforgot. 

Promise and prophecy entwined, 

In sacred record is enshrined, 

These every hour fulfilled to thee, 

O Israel, is a Jubilee! 

Can Zion's children tell, to-day, 
The half of what they now enjoy? 

Or can a soul by words portray 
What fifty years more will employ 

Of inspiration's force and flame? 

Or how far lost a foes great name? 

Or what the world will surely see 

Before next Year of Jubilee? 

The Saints will live, the Kingdom grow, 
Zion unveiled will "rise and shine!" 

Nations and tongues will homage pay 
To Truth, of origin divine. 

And God will bring to nought each plan 

Of false, corrupt, and wicked man. 

Who would not wish to live and see 

The next glad Year of Jubilee? 

"Thy kingdom come, thy will be done," 
Done, on the earth as 'tis above. 

Faith that 'tis nearer with each sun, 
Inspired work is a life of love. 

Triumph is certain, victory sure; 

Blessed are all who will endure. 

Time and eternity shall be 

To them unending Jubilee!

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



First D*y 



FIRST DAY 
MORNING MEETING 

The opening session of the Conference convened Friday morn- 
ing, April 5, at 10 o'clock. 

President J. Reuben Clark, Jr., First Counselor in the First 
Presidency, who presided, announced that the music for this ses- 
sion of the Conference would be furnished by the Brigham Young 
University Chorus, under the joint direction of Dr. Franklin W. 
Madsen and Dr. Florence Jepperson Madsen, with Dr. Frank W. 
Asper at the organ. 

The opening song was by the congregation and Chorus, "Now 
Let Us Rejoice in the Day of Salvation." 

Elder George T. Hyde, President of the Portneuf Stake, offered 
the invocation. 

The Brigham Young University Chorus sang "Send Forth Thy 
Spirit" (Schuetky). 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

The following telegram from President Grant was read by President 
J. Reuben Clark, Jr. : 

Los Angeles, California 
April 5, 1940 

Presidents J. Reuben Clark, Jr. and David O. McKay, 
Salt Lake City, Utah, 

To the Saints in Conference assembled : I sincerely regret that I am 
not present with you at this opening meeting of our Conference. I know 
of the spiritual uplift that will come to you. Through the years I have 
always counted it a great blessing to participate with my brethren and 
sisters in General Conference. 

ACTIVITIES IN CALIFORNIA FOLLOWED BY SICKNESS 

I left home on the 26th of January and attended the dedication of 
the Mormon Battalion Monument at San Diego, and was one of the 
speakers, experiencing much liberty in my talk. I enjoyed the meetings. 
They were a great tribute to the achievement of our people. I was pleased 
with the talk of Brother Andrew Jenson. I then attended the conference 
of Inglewood Stake. In the morning I did not feel' well enough to speak, 
but spoke in the afternoon for about forty minutes with perfect liberty. 
That night I was feeling poorly and the next morning was removed to 
the hospital for medical attention and treatment. The treatment there 
was successful. I was very glad I had Brother McKay call on me in the 
hospital and give me a blessing, and I am grateful beyond expression 
for the faith and prayers of the Saints. I know of a certainty that your 
prayers have been heard and answered in my behalf. 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 



3 



I am very grateful that I now can be around working at times, but 
mostly resting, exercising, and taking care of myself, to the end that I may 
realize a full recovery. 

About the middle of March I moved from the hospital to the home 
of my grandnephew, Del Grant, where I have been comfortably located, 
and have been improving in my health every day making really astonish- 
ing advancement, according to the doctors. I had hoped at least to speak 
to the Conference by radio, but the doctors feel it unwise to subject myself 
to that great strain. They feel too that it would be better to regain my 
strength before making an attempt to return home. Therefore I shall 
remain here for a few weeks more. The doctors feel it a matter of wisdom 
for me to stay here another few weeks, even though there would be little 
danger if I were to return home now. 

BLESSING AND COMMENDATION 

I send my love and blessings to all the Saints, and pray that you may 
have a time of rejoicing during Conference. I have been made happy by 
the new Stakes that have been formed of late, and the reorganization of 
our General Boards. I earnestly pray for the success of the new 
officers in the Stakes and on the several Boards. Truly Zion is growing. 

AN APPEAL TO THE YOUNG 

I sympathize with our young people because of the temptations that 
beset them. I urge them, as I always have, to live the Gospel of Jesus 
Christ fully. In that way they will have health and happiness, and will 
meet with success in this life and will have an eternity of joy in store for 
them in the life to come. I bless them with courage to meet the problems 
that lie ahead. 

A TESTIMONY 

It is a joy to me to bear again my testimony of my absolute knowledge 
of the divinity of the work in which we are engaged, and of the divinity 
of the Savior, and of the divine work of the Prophet Joseph Smith. 

AN EXPRESSION OF SYMPATHY 

I was grieved to hear of the passing of Elder Harold G. Reynolds 
who has been in charge of the transportation in our missionary system. 
He was a true Latter-day Saint. May our Heavenly Father bless and 
sustain his wife and children. 

PRAYER AND BLESSING 

I most earnestly pray for all the General and local officers, both in 
the Priesthood and the Auxiliary organizations, and for the advancement 
of the work of God, and I send my love and blessings to the Saints at 
home and abroad. Amen. 

(Signed) HEBER J. GRANT. 



4 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Friday, April 5 First Dag 

PRESIDENT J. REUBEN CLARK, JR. 

My brethren and sisters : We are all thrilled with this message from 
President Grant. I saw him personally, as did Brother McKay. He is 
recovering; he is well on his way to full recovery. I know that every 
true Latter-day Saint in Zion is praying for his speedy and complete 
restoration to health and strength. We should like to send him now 
the greetings of this great Conference, and assure him that he has our 
faith and prayers for his early recovery.

12 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Friday, April 5 First Day 

REPORT OF THE CHURCH AUDITING COMMITTEE 

Elder Harold H. Bennett read the Report of the Church Auditing 
Committee as follows : 

The First Presidency of the Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 
47 East South Temple Street, 
Salt Lake City, Utah. 
Dear Brethren: 

We have examined the financial report of the Church for the 
year 1939. The records are accurately kept, and the accounting is 
modern and adequate. 

The Church budget is in balance, and the Church is entirely 
free of debt. 

Yours respectfully, 
(Signed) 

Orval W. Adams 
Albert E. Bowen 
George S. Spencer 
H. H. Bennett 
Auditing Commitee. 

PRESIDENT J. REUBEN CLARK, JR. 

First Counselor in the First Presidency 

My brethren and sisters : I humbly pray that the time that I may 
stand before you may be filled with words that may be of help, counsel, 
and encouragement. 

SIGNIFICANT FEATURES OF ANNUAL REPORT 

There are two or three things that perhaps might be specially men- 
tioned in connection with our annual report. 

During the year 1939 we spent $50,000 more for missionary work 
than we spent in 1938. Part of that was undoubtedly due to the trans- 
portation back to the United States of the missionaries who were in Eur- 
ope, of which I shall say more a little later. 

While our records cannot be regarded as accurate, nevertheless it 
does appear that during the year 1939, from January 1st to December 
31st, we took off from the Welfare system some 1,800 people. It further- 
more appears that we had 2,500 fewer unemployed on December 31st, 
1939, than on the same date in 1938. 

As you will have noticed from the reports, there have been three 
new Stakes organized, nineteen new wards, and forty-five new Branches. 

The birth rate has increased six-tenths of one per cent ; the death rate 
has decreased three-tenths of one per cent; the marriage rate remains 
the same. 

While, as indicated by the report, the Church as a whole has not yet 



PRESIDENT J. REUBEN CLARK, JR 



13 



reached the goal of one dollar per person for Fast offerings, nevertheless 
we made in 1939 a decided advance in the number of Fast-offering-payers 
as well as in the amount paid. There were 66,631 more payers of Fast 
offerings in 1939 than in 1938. Moreover, the voluntary Fast offerings 
increased in 1939 by $95,513.00. Our commodity offerings decreased, 
however by $27,333.00. The estimated value of clothing, bedding, canned 
fruits, vegetables, fuel and labor increased over 1938 by $36,125.00. 

As Brother Bennett has told you, we have balanced our budget. The 
following will give you some idea of the larger items and the percentage 
of expenditure to which the tithing is devoted: 

The Ward and Stake expenses are 16.6%, of the whole budget; the 
Church Schools 16.2% ; Missionary work 15.3% ; Church buildings 
erected, 20.7% ; Welfare, 9.6% ; and the General Authorities and the 
maintenance of the General offices of the Church, 6.3%. 

When we urge tithing, brothers and sisters, it is obviously not for 
selfish reasons ; it is that we may serve our Church needs better. Without 
tithing we should be extremely helpless in the things which we regard as 
and which the Lord has declared to be vital. 

CHURCH INCOME DEPENDENT UPON FAITH AND PROSPERITY 

We have felt that it was important that the Church should live within 
its income, not only for itself as a Church, but for an example to the com- 
munity, the state, the nation, and to the individual members themselves. 

Such a course of the Church involves problems which are not inci- 
dent to civil administration, which is primarily dependent upon taxes 
that can be accurately forecast, except for income and other like special 
taxes which are in the nature of extra or surplus revenues. Therefore 
there are in governmental activities few occasions when an unbalanced 
budget — that is, when more is spent than is taken in — is not created by 
some deliberate act. 

With the Church the matter is wholly different. Over the last four 
years approximately 87%of the total Church income has been the tithing. 
This being a purely voluntary contribution, its amount cannot be accurate- 
ly forecast. Its volume depends wholly upon the faithfulness of the 
people. Thus, where the governmental agencies have relative certainty 
in income, the Church has uncertainty. 

Furthermore, governmental agencies, knowing their fixed income, 
can plan their expenditures with certainty, they can so fix their expendi- 
tures as to fall within their income. The Church, not knowing its income, 
cannot so definitely fix its outgo as certainly to come within its revenue. 
Its only guide on these matters is to be spelled out from the experiences 
of the past. 

Again, while income taxes and analogous governmental taxes — 
state, county, and municipal — depend upon the prosperity of the people, 
yet the great bulk of the taxes levied by such governmental agencies 
are on real and personal properties under terms which are fixed by the 
taxing power and rarely vary with the prosperity of the people. These 
taxes are paid whether your business or farms pay or do not pay. 



14 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Friday, April 5 First Day 

On the other hand, the Church income depends wholly upon the 
prosperity of the people. If crops are short, if prices are low, if business 
is poor, the Church revenues suffer proportionately, for it is the annual 
income that is tithed. 

So not only your faithfulness is involved, but granting you full 
faithfulness, there is still the uncertainty of weather, crops, business, and 
other elements that no one can forecast. 

TITHING A TRUST FUND 

These things are pointed out so that no one can be under the delu- 
sion that the Church has a pile of gold to which it may go for any amount 
of money that it wishes. The only money the Church has is what has been 
saved out of the tithing you have given it in the past and the tithing you 
are now giving it, and approximately 87% of the total annual income, 
as I have already stated, comes from you from year to year. 

We, the Authorities of the Church must therefore be extremely care- 
ful as to our commitments, else we shall find ourselves, as we have occa- 
sionally in the past, spending more than our income. 

When you Bishops and Presidents of Stakes, and Mission Presidents, 
and Temple Presidents, and Auxiliary Officers and School-men, and 
Welfare agencies, and people in distress, come to the Presiding Bishop- 
ric and meet a "No" and then come to the Presidency and get a louder 
"No," please do not believe that we are unfeeling or unsympathetic, or 
harsh, or cruel, or lack understanding or appreciation, or love for our 
brethren. We are merely trying to administer the Lord's money, not our 
money, not your money, as wisely and justly as the Lord gives us wis- 
dom to exercise. We are not infallible in our judgment, and we err, 
but our constant prayer is that the Lord will guide us in our decisions, 
and we are trying so to live that our minds will be open to His inspiration. 

CHURCH FREE FROM DEBT 

Perhaps I may say here that the Church itself, (I am not now speak- 
ing of Wards and Stakes) does not owe a dollar in the world to any per- 
son or to any institution. All its property is free from encumbrance of 
any sort; its credit was never higher. There are idle and silly rumors 
running about to the contrary, but, brothers and sisters, I am stating to 
you the sober facts. 

The First Presidency will do all in their power to keep the Church in 
this condition. 

So much for our Church finances, which, while far from being the 
most important element in the Church, are nevertheless a very important 
factor in our organization if we are to carry forth the work we have be- 
gun and which the Lord has revealed He expects us to do. Indeed, we 
cannot do this work without your contributions. The work is, in the full 
sense, in your hands. 

The First Presidency would like to urge every member of the Church 
to follow the example set by the Church and to live within his income. 

Anyone who lives beyond his income is inviting disaster. Borrowed 



PRESIDENT J. REUBEN CLARK, JR 15 



money is not income. Borrowing on capital account, within your reason- 
able capacity to pay, may be sound, depending upon circumstances. But 
borrowing to live on is unsound, whether it be an outright loan or install- 
ment buying. We urge the members to be frugal, thrifty, industrious, 
temperate, saving, and to live righteously. 

THE WELFARE PROGRAM 

Now, a few words about the Welfare work. The great wisdom of 
our leaders, past and present, up to the beginning of the World depres- 
sion, is nowhere better shown than in their continued policy of having the 
Church live within its income and of putting a little aside each year for a 
rainy day. If they had not done this, but instead had used up year by 
year all the tithing you paid in, we would have entered this depression 
with no assets but our current income, with no reserves, with a diminished 
revenue, and with no course open to us but drastically to reduce our regu- 
lar vital activities in order to extend help to the needy. But as it was, we 
were able to increase the Church proportion in our building program, 
so as to help the needy unemployed. We were able for a couple of years 
to spend more than our revenue so as to carry on our Welfare work, and 
yet to leave ourselves completely solvent and with unimpaired credit 
against a day of greater need. This was done without borrowing a dollar. 

I say to you again, the Church does not owe a dollar to any person, 
firm or institution in the world beyond the regular current monthly bills, 
which are settled at the end of each month ; it has no mortgage on any 
of its property. 

The report already read shows the amount expended on Welfare 
work by the Church during the last calendar year. But thousands of dol- 
lars of produce has been raised and distributed of which we have no ac- 
curate account. 

In addition, there has been the neighbor to neighbor help — a very 
considerable sum — and Priesthood quorum and other activities of which 
we have no accurate record. 

May I pause here and say that I hope that every member attending 
Conference will take occasion to go down to the Bishop's Storehouse and 
visit that wonderful exhibit. Do this between meetings, and before meet- 
ings, and after meetings. You will get a thrill there such as you have 
rarely experienced, where each Stake's work is portrayed by an exhibi- 
tion of the actual products which they have produced. Do not fail, bro- 
thers and sisters, and particularly you who are engaged in Welfare work, 
to visit and inspect that wonderful exhibition. I told the brethren this 
morning that this work continuing to grow, one of these days they would 
be forced to attempt to secure the State Fair buildings down near the 
river, to give their exhibit in. 

Furthermore, the reports which you have heard read from time to 
time in this Conference regarding Welfare expenditures, cover only what 
has been actually given out to the people. No account has heretofore been 
taken of the physical assets — fixed assets, real estate, personal property — 
which have been devoted to the Welfare work, — part of the funds coming 



16 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Friday, April 5 First Day 

from you brethren and sisters out in the regions, part of it coming from 
the general funds of the Church. But during the four years in which the 
Welfare program has been functioning, we have accumulated approxi- 
mately a half million dollars of physical assets, buildings, and equipment, 
and these are all employed in the Welfare work. 

WHEAT TO BE STORED 

We are now building, as you know, a large grain elevator which will 
store approximately 300,000 bushels of grain. We did have in storage 
approximately 190,000 bushels of wheat, which we are now replacing. 
In that connection I would like to read you just a part of a letter dated 
August 26th, 1918, signed by the First Presidency under Joseph F. 
Smith, by the Presiding Bishopric under C. W. Nibley, and by the Relief 
Society under Emmeline B. Wells, concerning the re-investing of the 
Relief Society Wheat Fund. 

After calling attention to the sale of the wheat to the Government at 
that time, the letter closes with these two paragraphs : 

The money received for the wheat the government has taken must 
be kept in the banks and draw interest. In no case should it be loaned out 
or used for any purposes whatsoever other than the purchase of wheat, 
as it is a sacred trust fund which can be used only for the purpose for 
which it is donated. 

When the time comes to again invest this money in the purchase of 
wheat you will be advised of it by the Presiding Bishopric and the Gen- 
eral Board of Relief Society. 

We are, my brethren and sisters, in accordance with that determina- 
tion which was then made, re-investing the wheat money back into wheat, 
and we aim to keep it re-invested in that way as a part of the Church 
Welfare Plan. This move has the whole-hearted and complete approval 
of the Relief Society sisters to whom as a matter of fact the fund belongs. 

WORK YET TO BE DONE 

I shall not take time to tell you of the various activities of the Wel- 
fare Program, but I would like to say that I am firmly convinced that we 
are now sufficiently organized and have now enough experience, so that 
if we shall bend our whole energies to it we shall be able to feed, clothe, 
and house ourselves. I think there is no doubt of that. 

Two other things we still have left to do. One, we must bend our 
energies towards finding work for those people to do who need assistance. 
I shall touch on that again in just a moment. Next, if we find labor for 
them to do we shall then be well on our way towards rehabilitating them 
in their spiritual and civic lives. This is the second and in a sense, the 
most important work we have to do. 

Lastly, I wish to urge upon you Welfare workers, you Presidents of 
Stakes, you Bishops, Presidents of Branches, local Relief Societies and 
all other agencies, that you do not wait to be told from headquarters about 
every detail of what you should do. You know the local problem better 
than we do. Meet the problem which arises in your various places in ac- 



PRESIDENT J. REUBEN CLARK, JR

cordance with its needs. Regimentation is a threatening blight upon all 
Church activities. 

ECONOMY IN ERECTION OF BUILDINGS 

One of the greatest problems of the Church is providing the neces- 
sary buildings for carrying on our numerous and exacting activities. 

We have a tendency I think to make our buildings just a little bit too 
elaborate and too ornate. 

There is an ever-present necessity, which comes with increasing fre- 
quency, to subdivide Wards and Stakes. Not unusually the new Ward 
or new Stake wants a little better home than the one they are giving up. 
This is like a young man marrying and expecting the new home for him- 
self and bride to be better than the one that each of them left. This is 
fine provided the new groom can make the grade by himself ; otherwise 
not. 

Where the old Ward home is elaborate and ample, arrangements 
should be made for joint occupancy by the parent Ward and the new 
Ward. We are trying this out in several places and find it a workable and 
suitable plan, provided the people practice the Christian virtues of un- 
selfishness, patience, charity, give and take — particularly give. 

Our constantly increasing needs, increasing by greater proportion 
than our revenues, make this sort of arrangement year by year more im- 
portant and necessary. 

Amusement halls should be made to serve as large units as possible. 
While in sparsely settled communities, Ward amusement halls may be 
frequently desirable, in more thickly settled areas effort should be made 
to have for the young people larger association than a Ward provides. 

Speaking of a new Ward and a new meeting house for it, I should 
like publicly to commend the example just set by the Tremonton First 
and Second Wards in erecting a building for the new Ward. Other 
Wards of the Church have followed a similar plan. The old Ward — Tre- 
monton First — said to the new Ward : "We will pay half of the cost to 
the Ward of its new meeting house, and the new Ward can pay the other 
half." Accordingly, the old Ward raised $12,000 to help build the new 
home for their old friends and associates, and the Bishop of the old Ward 
and his people report feeling better about this effort than about anything 
else the Ward has ever done. I commend this example to all dividing 
Wards. 

BEAUTIFI CATION PLAN APPROVED 

I would like to approve of the plan that lies close to Bishop Ashton's 
heart, that of beautifying our towns, our meeting houses, our homes. 
There is much to be done ; but just paint by itself is a wonderful beauti- 
fier. There is an old ranch saying that "Fat is a pretty color." Paint 
is fat for barns, fences, and homes. 

I have already spoken of the problem of supplying labor to those who 
need assistance. Bishops, get the Welfare man some paint. Let him 
paint his own house ; fix up his own fence ; plant some trees in his own 



18 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Friday , April 5 First Day 

yard, or some grass ; clean up his yard. If you will do this, half your 
work of human repair is done, and the hardest half, too. 

Paint your meeting houses, your town hall, repair your sidewalks, 
keep your park or public grounds looking neat, keep up your fences. 

AUXILIARY ORGANIZATIONS TO HELP THE HOMES 

The call of these troubled times comes most insistently to the ears of 
the officers of the Auxiliary associations. They are reconsidering their 
whole field with a view to see what may be done by them to meet the needs 
of the times. They are undertaking more clearly to define their fields of 
activity, to cut out duplications, and overlapping — to eliminate the in- 
creasing waste in effort, time, and funds. 

One of their chief concerns will be the easing of the burdens on the 
Bishops and Presidents of Stakes, a relieving of the people from as much 
financial burden as possible, a cutting down of general excess activities, 
and helping the home to assume its normal functions in shaping the lives 
of the young. For when all is said and done that can be said or done, 
if the home is not sound, the bulk of the youth will fall into forbidden 
paths. The problem here is not primarily the children, but the parents 
who have been encouraged — unwittingly encouraged, if we be charitable 
— to turn over the training of the youth to the schools, the Auxiliaries, and 
other instrumentalities. This plan will never succeed. Fathers and 
mothers must know that they are responsible for the existence of their 
children, and having assumed that responsibility, they cannot in the eyes 
of God shirk, or shift, or ignore the responsibility of rightly training 
them, except they shall bring themselves under condemnation. 

One of the principal, if not the main, purpose of the Auxiliaries 
must be to help the parents to help their children, and this can be effec- 
tively worked out through the home. 

CHURCH EDUCATION 

We are trying the experiment in education of studying the Gospel by 
a semi-scientific method. We are floundering a bit, not yet have we got 
our true bearings. So far as I know, no other Church is attempting to 
do just what we are trying. In some churches members are told not to 
trouble themselves about doctrines, but to do what their leaders tell them. 
The Latter-day Saints are required by divine command to learn all they 
can about the Gospel. 

Critics — higher and lower — are applying scientific methods to the 
study of Religion, with somewhat disastrous results to many sectarian 
dogmas. But we are applying the system to the Gospel plan of life and 
salvation as revealed in the latter days. We could surely not survive this 
experiment except we had the truth. 

But we are going forward, and generally speaking the faith of our 
young people is increasing. Wherever this is not true, it is largely the 
fault of the instruction given. Earnest effort is being made to make sure 
that sectarianism does not become a part of our educational instruction, 



PRESIDENT J. REUBEN CLARK, JR 



19 



and that the Gospel truths are taught in their simplicity. Those in charge 
of our educational system are strenuously striving to this end. 

We could not justify spending the tithing of the poor, the widow's 
mite,- — and the great bulk of our tithing is of this sort, — for any other 
kind of Church doctrine education, than that which taught the Gospel and 
its restoration in its greatest simplicity, unmixed with any man-made 
views. 

WITHDRAWAL OF EUROPEAN MISSIONARIES 

I would like to say just a few words about the withdrawal of the 
missionaries from Europe. On August 24, 1939, it becoming increasingly 
apparent that our missionaries were not welcome either in the belligerent 
. or neutral countries of western Europe, the European Mission Presidents 
were requested to send to America all missionaries, except a very few who 
would remain temporarily to man the various Mission headquarters. 

We were blessed in having in Europe at the time Elder Joseph Field- 
ing Smith and Sister Smith to counsel with the various Mission Presi- 
dents and take general direction of the situation. There were in our Mis- 
sions at the time, including the wives and children of the Presidents, 697 
persons, of whom 61 1 were young men and 63 young women missionaries, 
the other 23 were Mission Presidents, their wives and children. 

The first missionary group from Europe landed in New York Sep- 
tember 7, and the last group, accompanied by Elder Joseph Fielding 
Smith, and Sister Smith, landed on November 6th, 1939. 

These returning missionaries were received by President Frank 
Evans and Sister Evans at the Eastern States Mission headquarters in 
New York. The missionaries returned in 23 ships, each of which had to 
be met and the missionaries transported to their temporary quarters. The 
heavy baggage handled exceeded 1,500 pieces; there were more than 
10,000 letters and other mailed parcels. Each of these 674 missionaries 
had to be housed and cared for. Many landed without funds, and funds 
had to be advanced to them — some 146 small loans were made, all repaid 
except one small item. The money received from parents had to be dis- 
tributed, there were telegrams and cablegrams to handle, and office sup- 
plies to furnish and numerous other acts of helpfulness. 

Furthermore, as the bulk of these missionaries had not filled a full 
term mission they had to be reassigned upon arrival to new fields of labor. 
President John H. Taylor of the First Council of Seventy was sent to 
New York to direct this work. Of the 674 missionaries, 414 Elders and 
32 lady missionaries were reassigned, the rest were released. 

President and Sister Evans had charge also of getting these 446 re- 
assigned missionaries off to their new fields of labor, and the 228 released 
off to their homes. 

The total cost of this service by President Evans, in handling all 
these missionaries and Mission Presidents and families — a total of 697 
persons — was only $2,271.47, or $3.26 per person, for landing, housing, 
feeding, and transportation from ships to headquarters and from head- 
quarters to train. 



20 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Friday. April 5 First Day 

President Taylor assisted President Evans in all of this work. This 
is truly a great work. The whole group was moved from the disturbed 
areas in Europe to the United States, and thence either to their new fields 
of labor or to their homes, without one accident or one case of sickness 
other than one chronic illness. The entire group Was evacuated from 
Europe in three months, at a time when tens of thousands of Americans 
were besieging the ticket offices of the great steamship companies for 
passage, and the Elders had no reservations. Every time a group was 
ready to embark there was available the necessary space, even though ef- 
forts to reserve space a few hours before had failed. 

The European Mission Presidents were directed to place their Mis- 
sions in the hands of the local brethren. When this was done they were 
also directed to return home. The first left on December 1, 1939, and 
the last landed in New York on March 4, 1940. 

During the European tour of President Grant three years ago the 
Saints were time and time again urged to appreciate and assume their full 
responsibilities as Church members and bearers of the Priesthood. They 
were urged to cease placing so much reliance upon the Elders. The pres- 
ent situation gives point to that counsel. 

Truly the blessings of the Lord attended this great enterprise. 

RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE PRIESTHOOD 

For our purposes today we may say that the Priesthood is the au- 
thority of God bestowed upon men to represent Him in certain relation- 
ships between and among men and between men and God. This is an 
awesome responsibility. It imposes certain obligations upon the Priest- 
hood bearers as between themselves, and also as between them and the 
members at large, and between them and Deity. 

Quorum membership is something more than a name. The Lord has 
made it abundantly clear by repeated commandments that upon the 
Priesthood in its organized form, and not merely upon individuals bear- 
ing it, rests the responsibility of instructing, encouraging, and admon- 
ishing the people. The Lord has designated specifically the duties of the 
Priesthood in this regard, grade by grade. He has given no authority 
to the Priesthood to relieve itself of this responsibility, of instructing, 
encouraging, and admonishing, by delegating to someone else this duty, 
individually or by class. The Lord will therefore hold the Priesthood 
as such responsible for a due and proper instruction of Church member- 
ship in the way of life and salvation. 

The Priesthood must not either forget or shirk this great responsi- 
bility. The Church may provide aids and helps through Auxiliary organi- 
ations, schools, and otherwise for the doing of this work, but the Church 
cannot and does not seek or aim to relieve the Priesthood from the obli- 
gations of this divine command, nor to authorize it to shirk it or dodge it. 
You bearers of the Priesthood, bend your backs, and take on this God- 
placed burden. The Almighty expects, indeed commands this. Your 
failure to do so will bring woe to the people, and condemnation upon 
yourselves. 



PRESIDENT J. REUBEN CLARK, JR 21 



WORLD CONDITIONS 

We may return to our Heavenly Father our devout thanks that His 
spirit of peace yet broods over this land, and that war has not to this 
point cursed us with its woes and miseries. 

I should like to incorporate by reference all that I said last October 
about the war, its causes and its iniquities. 

THE WOMEN OF THE CHURCH 

I should like to say a word to the women of the Church, the "first 
aid" to the Priesthood in their trials and tribulations. I marvel that our 
wives are willing to live with us, with all of our grumblings, failings, and 
shortcomings. 

From the beginning the women of the Christian church have shown 
their surpassing faith and devotion. Only one Apostle stood near the 
Cross while the Christ was crucified, but Mary, the mother, was there, 
and Mary Magdalene, and Mary, the mother of James and Joses, and the 
mother of Zebedee's children, and the women that followed Him from 
Galilee. It was Mary Magdalene who was first at the tomb when the Sab- 
bath had ended, and to her Christ vouchsafed the first view to mortals 
of His resurrected body. 

From that time until now woman has comforted and nursed the 
Church. She has borne more than half the burdens, she has made more 
than half the sacrifices, she has suffered the most of the heartaches and 
sorrows. 

In the modern Church hers has been the abiding, unquestioning 
faith, the pure knowledge, that has enheartened the Priesthood and kept 
it going forward against all odds. Her loving trust, her loyal devotion were 
the faithful anchor that held when storms were fiercest. 

For all this we are more grateful than we can say. We humbly ask 
the Lord to help you sisters in the future as in the past. We Priesthood 
need your courage, your steadfastness, your faith, your knowledge, your 
testimony, to cheer us on, to keep us in the way. 

Sisters of the Church, the chastity of the youth of the Church is 
largely in your hands. You must enthrone virtue in its sovereign place ; 
you must bring back modesty, must let the beauty of chaste blushes still 
adorn your cheeks. 

Mothers in Israel, teach your sons to honor and revere, to protect 
to the last, pure womanhood ; teach your daughters that their most price- 
less jewel is a clean, undefiled body ; teach both sons and daughters that 
chastity is worth more than life itself. These are the duties which the 
Priesthood looks to you primarily to carry to, and to maintain in, that 
cradle of all virtues, — the righteous home. We Priesthood shall help as 
best our natures permit, but the burden for that task is now and always 
has been, in the greatest part, yours. Unless you shall do this, the whole 
world will sink into a welter of sin and corruption. May God help you 
in your task ! 



22 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Friday, April 5 First Dag 

TO THE YOUTH OF CHURCH 

May I say again to the youth of the Church, and first to you daugh- 
ters : That man or youth who demands without marriage as the price of his 
favor or love the enjoyment of your body, has in fact nothing but sorrow 
and degradation to give you in return ; and next, to you sons : That 
woman who offers to you her body outside wedlock, invites you to a feast 
that brings disease and corruption that will pollute you until death. And 
any man or woman who demands as the price of his favor or friendship 
a surrender of any of your righteous standards of living, is offering to you 
nothing worth buying. What it brings to you is false as Evil itself. 

I say all this in soberness, and in such solemnity as I command, know- 
ing as I know that I live that I speak the truth. 

THE ORGANIZATIONS COMMENDED 

I want to thank all of the organizations of the Church for their 
great help in carrying on the work of the Church. Perhaps I ought not 
to say help, perhaps I ought to say for carrying the work on, for we breth- 
ren here at the top would be powerless if it were not for the sterling faith- 
fulness of you brethren and sisters. I know that the great bulk are trying 
to live righteously and to do right, and I know that the Lord will bless 
them in their efforts. 

LOYALTY BRINGS BLESSINGS 

The Lord is pleased with your loyalty to those in authority, in Ward, 
Stake, and Church. The work cannot go on growing without this loyalty, 
and this loyalty is not to be thought of as loyalty to the individuals, but 
as loyalty to the work, to the office, to the authority which the individual 
represents. It is loyalty to the Priesthood of Almighty God. The indi- 
vidual himself is submerged in the divine authority he possesses. David 
sought forgiveness for raising his hand against the Lord's anointed, even 
though the anointed one sought David's life. This is the true principle 
of loyalty applied in almost the last extremity. 

From Cain until now, failure to follow God's authority has brought 
only condemnation. Aaron, Miriam, Korah and his followers, the whole 
camp of Israel suffered when they complained or rebelled against Moses. 
Likewise through the whole human history of God's dealings with men. 

From the earliest days of this Church, malcontents, apostates, "sore- 
heads," have railed out with slander, falsehood, derision, against those 
whom God called to lead the people. They so treated the Prophet, and 
Brother Brigham, and to a lesser degree, every President who has fol- 
lowed. But the Lord has always prospered the Church as it followed their 
leadership. The detractors have gone down to the oblivion they deserved. 
So it will always be. The Prophet of the Lord has stood above and be- 
yond the carpings of those unrighteous critics. He has always lived, as 
our leader lives today, in the kindly light of the Lord's approval, the re- 
cipient of the Lord's choicest blessings, manifested openly to those who 
will but look. 



ELDER SYLVESTER Q. CANNON 



23 



May the Lord continue His Spirit to be with us at all times. May 
He be with us during the remainder of this Conference ; particularly may 
He bless and restore President Grant to complete health and strength, 
I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

An Anthem, "My Soul is Athirst for God," (Dr. Florence Jep- 
person Madsen), was sung by the Brigham Young University 
Chorus. Soloist : Edward Sandgren. 

ELDER SYLVESTER Q. CANNON 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

I am very grateful, my brethren and sisters, for the opportunity 
I have to be present with you this morning. The statesmanlike ex- 
pression of the growth of the Church, of the progress of every activity 
of the Church, and the faith of the people, as expressed by President 
Clark and those who have spoken, has impressed me and affected me very 
greatly. I appreciate the fact that this work is progressing effectively 
and under the influence of the Holy Spirit the Lord is blessing His people 
and enabling them to accomplish the work which is before them. 

I regret with you very greatly the fact that President Grant is 
unable to be present with us this morning ; yet I rejoice in great measure 
that his health is improving ; that he is on the road to recovery ; and that 
the blessings of God are with him. 

I rejoice in the mission of peace which is manifest among the Latter- 
day Saints and among many other people, and in all that has been said re- 
garding this important quality and characteristic. I was impressed with 
the testimony and prayer of Brother George T. Hyde, imploring the Lord 
for peace and the way to overcome conditions which prevail throughout 
the world today, particularly in the Eastern Hemisphere. 

WARS AND RUMORS OF WAR 

The ways of God are the ways of peace. Yet, in spite of His efforts 
to promote peace on earth, it is still a fact that among many millions of 
people, particularly in the Eastern Hemisphere, wars and rumors of war 
are largely prevalent. Threats of war are heard almost constantly in 
the other half of the world. In this western continent the larger part 
of the peoples are in the enjoyment of peace. We are grateful for the 
fact that, for a period at least, the Western Hemisphere has not, to a 
large extent, in any way been embroiled in all the turmoil, which will lead 
we know not where. 

There are those, who, both here at home, and particularly abroad, 
would like to see this great nation become involved in these struggles 
abroad. So far, fortunately, the majority of the people of the United 
States, and, to a very considerable extent, the people of other western 
nations, have been able to keep their heads and their common sense, and 
to follow the wise and ancient counsels of the Father of our country, to

beware of entangling alliances with the foreign nations of the old world, 
and not to ally ourselves for war with any of these countries. 

The Latter-day Saints believe firmly in peace. We consider that 
wars are largely foolish and unnecessary, and that the present warring 
conditions are entirely without justification or necessity. With the pres- 
ent measure of intelligence among men, if those engaged in strife, 
were free from selfishness, greed and ambition, peace would prevail. The 
Prince of Peace came on earth in His mortal life nearly two thousand 
years ago, but due to the hatred and prejudices among men He was un- 
able to carry out His peaceful desires fully and, as He himself stated, 
He "came not to send peace on earth, but a sword." (Matt. 10:34) Dur- 
ing the twenty centuries that have elapsed since His coming, there have 
been wars and rumors of wars prevailing largely. As His mortal min- 
istry was about to be finished, He said to his disciples : 

These things I have spoken unto you that in me ye might have peace. 
In the world ye shall have tribulation. 

QUOTATION FROM BRITISH THINKER 

Recently, I noticed an article in the Contemporary Review written 
by a prominent British ecclesiast regarding the present war conditions, 
and discussing the question of universal peace. The statement is en- 
titled, "Ruling and Overruling." I quote a few brief extracts there- 
from as follows: 

The war raises again the grave problem of the relationship of God to 
the world, and of His activities in the affairs of men. Many are asking 
— Why did not God intervene to prevent this dread calamity, to spare 
mankind this tremendous ordeal? Is God inactive in His universe, and 
His very existence problematic? If not, what is the method in which 
His sovereignty is expressed, and what is the end it seeks to achieve? 
Surely, peace in its essential meaning demands catholicity, the common- 
wealth of mankind, and the community of a truly human fellowship. Is 
the structure of human society at present sufficiently strong and righteous 
to rear and sustain this weighty and glorious edifice? Obviously, it is 
not. Should not the war, therefore, be regarded as, in part, the Divine 
judgment upon us? If so, mercy is at its heart." 

FREE AGENCY GIVEN TO MEN 

As indicated by the writer of this article, many people raise the 
question as to why God did not intervene to prevent the great calamity 
that has come upon the earth and to spare mankind this tremendous or- 
deal. In my judgment the questions asked and the issues raised do not 
agree with the fundamental principles under which the Almighty op- 
erates, and by which He accomplishes His purposes. Men and women, 
who inhabit this earth, inherently enjoy the right of free agency, or the 
right of choice, in their actions. Though God does earnestly desire and 
strive for the acceptance of His purposes by mankind, He will not exert 
compulsory means to bring to pass His designs. As the Lord declared 
to Cain when the latter was angered with his brother Abel : 



ELDER SYLVESTER Q. CANNON 



25 



If thou doest well, thou shalt be accepted. And if thou doest not 
well, sin lieth at the door, and Satan desireth to have thee. (Writings 
of Moses.) 

Though many men under the influence of justice and righteousness 
are led toward peace and good will, those who are influenced by selfish- 
ness and personal ambition will act contrary thereto. The Prophet Nephi 
declares : 

Wherefore, men are free according to the flesh; and all things are 
given them which are expedient unto man. And they are free to choose 
liberty and eternal life, through the great mediation of all men, or to 
choose captivity and death, according to the captivity and power of the 
devil ; for he seeketh that all men might be miserable like unto himself. 
(II Nephi 2:27.) 

Every individual has the right of choice. And just as everyone has 
the right of free agency, so everyone will be held accountable for his or 
her choices. For all have the intelligence, and must render an account- 
ing of their actions. This is clearly portrayed in the Pearl of Great 
Price, writings of Moses, Chapter 4, Verses 1 to 4, as follows : 

That Satan, whom thou hast commanded in the name of mine Only 
Begotten, is the same which was from the beginning, and he came before 
me, saying — Behold, here am I, send me, I will be thy son, and I will 
redeem all mankind, that one soul shall not be lost, and surely I will do 
it; wherefore give me thine honor. 

But, behold, my Beloved Son, which was my Beloved, and Chosen 
from the beginning, said unto me — Father, thy will be done, and the glory 
be thine forever. 

Wherefore, because that Satan rebelled against me, and sought to de- 
stroy the agency of man, which I, the Lord God, had given him, and also, 
that I should give unto him mine own power ; by the power of mine Only 
Begotten, I caused that he should be cast down; 

And he became Satan, yea, even the devil, the father of all lies, to 
deceive and to blind men, and to lead them captive at his will, even as 
many as would not hearken unto my voice. 

These statements make clear the fact that, because of the domination 
of men, in bringing about war, the Lord did not intervene, even though 
He has steadfastly sought to win mankind to peace and union and right- 
eousness. As already stated, due to the agency of mankind to make their 
choices as to their ways of life, they will necessarily have to render an 
accounting of their acts in this life. As was revealed to the Apostle John, 
(Rev. 20:12) regarding the accountability of all mankind for their acts: 

And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the 
books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of 
life; and the dead were judged out of those things which were written 
in the books, according to their works. 

JOY COMES THROUGH SERVING GOD 

The relationship of God to the world, and His interest in the affairs 
of men, is greatly misunderstood by many of the people of the various 
nations. They conclude, apparently, that He is actuated by arbitrary 



26 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Friday, April 5 First Day 

or dictatorial attitudes, instead of being the embodiment of justice and 
righteousness, love and mercy, particularly toward those who seek to 
know and strive to do His will. He is love. He desires greatly the pro- 
gress and happiness of mankind. He realizes that the greatest peace and 
joy come to men who seek to harmonize their wishes with His will: 
"Men are that they might have joy," and joy comes to those who under- 
take to keep His commandments. But, if mankind choose to follow the 
influence of the adversary, to be guided by domineering or dictatorial 
leaders, with the accompanying destructive results, they must take the 
unfortunate consequences. 

THE SOVEREIGNTY OF GOD 

The question — "Is God inactive in His universe, and His very ex- 
istence problematic ? If not, what is the method in which His sovereign- 
ty is expressed, and what is the end it seeks to achieve?" — indicates a lack 
of faith in and understanding of the great personages who constitute the 
matchless governing and supreme power over all things, by whom all 
things were created, whether visible or invisible, whether in heaven, on 
earth, in the earth, under the earth or throughout the immensity of space. 
The work and the glory of God is to bring to pass the immortality and 
eternal life of man. Respecting the method in which His sovereignty 
is expressed and the end it seeks to achieve, the Lord has revealed the 
following: 

Hearken, O ye people, and open your hearts and give ear from afar ; 
and listen, you that call yourselves the people of the Lord, and hear the 
word of the Lord and His will concerning you. 

Yea, verily, I say, hear the word of Him, whose anger is kindled 
against the wicked and rebellious, 

Who willeth to take even them whom He will take, and preserveth 
in life them whom He will preserve ; 

Who buildeth up at His own will and pleasure ; and destroyeth when 
He pleases ; and is able to cast the soul down to hell. 

Behold, I, the Lord, utter my voice, and it shall be obeyed. 

Wherefore, verily I say, let the wicked take heed, and let the rebel- 
lious fear and tremble; let the unbelieving hold their lips, for the day 
of wrath shall come upon them as a whirlwind, and all flesh shall know 
that I am God. 

The sovereignty of God, as expressed herein, is in perfect accord 
with all that God has revealed in the Scriptures on this subject. 

In the revelations of the Apostle John (Rev. 4:11) the Elders, rep- 
resenting the Church declare : 

Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honor and power: 
for thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure they are and were 
created. 

God's sovereignty is absolute, but the exaltation and happiness of His 
children are His glory. His absolutism is that of a loving Father who 
knows of no greater happiness than the promotion of the welfare of His 
family. How sovereignty in God can be exercised upon free agents 
may be difficult to explain, but the yielding of obedience fully does not

interfere with free agency. There is no inconsistency in the doctrine 
of God's sovereignty and men's freedom. 

THE GOSPEL BRINGS PEACE 

Peace on earth depends upon the harmonizing of men's hearts and 
the cultivation of good will, justice and righteousness. It involves the 
overcoming of selfishness, unfairness and mistrust among mankind. There 
have been many failures throughout the world in the endeavors to main- 
tain peace. Yet the effort toward the increase of good will and kindliness 
is so much worthwhile and is of such great moment to the welfare of the 
human race that it justifies continuous effort in every direction. It is 
especially incumbent on the Latter-day Saints, who are disciples of the 
Prince of Peace, and are seeking to live in harmony with His established 
Gospel, which is the way to peace. The Lord has revealed again in these 
latter days the charge to His followers to — '"Renounce war, and proclaim, 
peace". To endeavor in every proper way, through example and influence, 
to promote peace everywhere, that the way may be prepared so that 
"nations shall not lift up the sword against nations" but be prepared for 
the coming of the reign of the Lord, that peace and good will toward men 
shall prevail everywhere. This, we are confident, will eventually occur. 

I pray our Heavenly Father that His blessings may attend all of us 
in all of our actions, that we may endeavor constantly to live the Gospel 
of the Lord Jesus Christ, for that is the way to peace and prosperity, 
and I ask it in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER HUGH B. BROWN 

Former President of the British Mission 

Sometimes it is better to go "over the top" without notice, than to 
sit in awful expectation of the zero hour. Humbly I pray for guidance 
and help. 

I bring to you, my brothers and sisters, greetings from the Saints of 
the British Mission. They are attempting to carry on under very trying 
circumstances. Men and women have assumed responsibilities of leader- 
ship, and in all the branches and districts an effort is being made to main- 
tain the organizations of the Church and to carry on under the light of 
the Gospel of Jesus Christ. 

The spirit of the British Saints is admirable indeed. The attitude 
of the British people commands respect and admiration. They are 
taking a stand in defense of democracy, are fighting a war which was not 
of their choosing but which I am sure they will prosecute until the agres- 
sor nations change their policy and decide to live at peace with their 
neighbors and respect the rights of individuals, of groups, of races and 
nationalities. 

We who remained a few months after the war was declared have 
some little appreciation of the seriousness of the situation as it affects 
our people there. While we are assembled here in a great Conference 
of the Church, in a peaceful land, surrounded with comparative plenty, 



28 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Friday. April 5 First Day 

enjoying the comforts and in many instances luxuries of life, let us not 
be unmindful of the conditions that obtain in those European countries 
which are at war. May we remember them, not only in our prayers to 
our Heavenly Father, but I suggest that those of us who are acquainted, 
as many of us are through our sons and daughters who have labored 
there, with members of the Church in those countries, that we write 
them occasionally, encouraging them to carry on. 

Your sons and daughters who have been laboring there have given a 
good account of themselves. We who were laboring with them found real 
joy and satisfaction in attempting to help them to get a vision of the great 
missionary work of the Church. The spirit of the Missions of the Church 
is the spirit of selfless service. I am sure that the reason so many of 
your sons and daughters, upon returning home, declare that the time 
spent in the mission field was the most enjoyable of their lives, is that 
■ they have found, while there, that there is more joy in giving than in get- 
ting. 

Sometimes, when they first arrive, they wonder just what they are 
going to get out of their mission, and as long as they are thus disturbed 
they are not very effective. Very soon after arriving, however, most of 
them begin to look around them for ways whereby they may serve their 
fellow men, and when they are impressed by this spirit they begin to un- 
fold and to develop, under the light of the spirit of the Gospel of Christ, 
and they become effective. 

It is regrettable that in some instances, upon returning home, they 
find difficulty in making the adjustment that is necessary where they find 
it incumbent upon them to spend part, at least, of their time in establish- 
ing themselves economically. I trust that as time goes on we may find 
ways and means of meeting this situation. 

I trust that the Lord will help us to serve Him and keep His com- 
mandments, and show our love for Him by our willingness to serve our 
fellow men at home, when so much of our time is necessarily given to 
so-called worldly matters. I hope the time may come when the spirit 
of the Mission may dominate the Wards and the Stakes at home, even 
more than it does today. I trust that we may catch the vision of the work 
which was undertaken and so effectively completed by the Master Him- 
self ; that we may come to see in others the good that is there to be found : 
that we may emulate His example, and put out of our hearts envy and 
contention and jealousy and strife ; that we may become sympathetic, 
one with another ; that we may realize that real religion is service ; that 
we must convert conviction into action. 

I trust that we, as members of the Church of Christ, may be able so 
to live the Gospel that others, seeing our works, may be attracted to it 
and receive of the blessings which are in store for those who will observe 
it. 

I read this morning, before leaving home, a work which I should 
like to read to you, indicative of the thinking of some of the leaders in 
other lands today. 



ELDER HUGH B. BROWN

Religion, in the past, has always spent a large proportion of its force 
on doings that were apart from the real business of life, on sacrificing, 
on endless prayers, on traveling to Mecca, Jerusalem or Rome, on kissing 
sacred stones, bathing in sacred rivers, climbing sacred stairs, and a thou- 
sand things that had at best only an indirect bearing on the practical 
social relations between men and their fellows. 

I thought of this paragraph as President Clark was giving us his 
masterful address, and as I listened to the reports that were read here. 
I think there is no group in the world which is giving so unselfishly for 
the uplift of the human family as is the Qiurch of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints. There is less show and pomp and ceremony, but it seems 
to me that we are attempting to harness the great spiritual power of the 
Church to the problems of human suffering and human need. For these 
things humbly I thank God. 

I should like to bear witness to you, my brethren and sisters, upon 
returning again from the mission field, that God has blessed me with a 
testimony of the truth. I thank Him humbly for that, as it is the prized 
possession of my life. I bear witness that the Prophet Joseph Smith had 
a vision, that he saw and talked with God. I know this from the very core 
of my heart, and I thank Him for that knowledge. 

I bear witness that they who have succeeded him were likewise so 
inspired and led; that President Heber J. Grant is a prophet of God. 
It was my privilege to travel with him some two years ago in Europe. 
I wish you could have been present in Heidelburg when, as we were 
passing through the station, where we could not stop, a group of faithful 
German Latter-day Saints, standing on the platform, as he put his head 
out of the car window, sang in a language we could not understand, but 
with a spirit that I have seldom witnessed, "We Thank Thee, O God, for 
a Prophet." Today I echo that sentiment, and say to you that through- 
out the world faithful Latter-day Saints esteem him and his associates 
as such. 

I bear witness to the truth, and bring to you from those nations this 
message : Carry on, regardless of the difficulties that may confront you. 
God made of one blood all nations of men, and there is no room in the 
heart of a Latter-day Saint for hate. 

Let us then, remember them today in those countries, and let us plead 
with God our Father to bring speedily the end to war. May we, as we 
enjoy the peaceful surroundings of our great land, be not unmindful 
of the fact that they are our brothers and sisters, and that He is inter- 
ested in them. Let us love one another. Let us emulate His example, for 
He exposed each individual to the X-ray of His penetrating vision, and 
revealed to him his hidden possibilities, not his defects. Let us keep 
that in mind as we think of these warring nations, and expel from 
our hearts anything of hate, and in love serve our fellow men. I pray 
God that He will help us so to do, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 



The Brigham Young University Chorus sang an anthem, "Grant 
Us Peace, O Lord," (Evan Stephens).

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



First Day 



PRESIDENT J. REUBEN CLARK, JR. 

First Counselor in the First Presidency 

My brethren and sisters, I would like to urge all of you to drive 
carefully. Let us see if it be not possible to go through one General 
Conference without an automobile accident. 



Elder Albert Choules, President of the Teton Stake, offered the 
closing prayer. 

Conference adjourned until 2 p. m. 

FIRST DAY 
AFTERNOON MEETING 

Conference reconvened at 2 o'clock p. m., Friday, April 5. 

The music for this session of the Conference was furnished by 
the Brigham Young University Chorus, Dr. Franklin W. Madsen 
and Dr. Florence Jepperson Madsen, directors, Dr. Frank W. Asper 
at the organ. 

President J. Reuben Clark, Jr., who presided, announced that 
the Congregation and Chorus would sing, as the opening number, 
"High on the Mountain Top" (Beesley). 

After the singing of the opening song, the invocation was of- 
fered by Elder J. Berkeley Larsen, President of the Shelley Stake. 

An anthem, "Fierce Raged the Tempest" (T. F. H. Candlyn), 
was sung by the Brigham Young University Chorus. 

ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

I believe, my brethren and sisters, you who were present at this 
morning's session of Conference felt as I felt, that it was a wonder- 
ful session. The Spirit of the Lord was with us. It seems to me 
there never was so much reported in evidence of faithfulness on the 
part of the Latter-day Saints, at any one session of a General Con- 
ference as at this particular session referred to, and so much instruc- 
tion of a definite, wide-spread character. I cheerfully bear testimony 
to the things which we heard this morning. I was led to feel grateful 
for my membership in this Church, to be identified with the Latter- 
day Saints who are so faithful in living their religion, and in carry- 
ing on the work of the Lord. 

AN APPEAL TO THE INDIFFERENT 

I cannot help however but realize that while there is evidence 
of faithfulness in the Church, on the part of the membership there- 



ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS 



31 



of, that there is a great deal of lukewarmness. A great many mem- 
bers of our Church do not seem to appreciate the Gospel as fully 
as we would like that they should. In our preaching and teaching, 
naturally, while we commend the faithful Saints for their faithful- 
ness and accomplishments, we try to appeal to those who are not 
doing their share in carrying on this great latter-day work, with the 
hope that they may be made to realize their opportunities, and to take 
advantage of them, realizing that we are here upon the earth to 
work out our salvation according to the Gospel of Jesus Christ, which 
has been restored to earth anew in these last days. 

As a people I believe we are pretty well taught, so well taught, 
and our knowledge is so thorough, that if we would live up to the 
Gospel teachings and live as we know we ought to live, there would 
be little question as to our receiving a salvation. We have need of 
being impressed, therefore, with the necessity of doing the things 
that we know we ought to do, and also in refraining from doing the 
things which we know we ought not to do. 

THE SAVIOR'S MISSION 

We read in the scriptures how in the councils of heaven there 
was a rebellion, and Christ our Lord and Savior, the first-born of 
the Father in the spirit, came forth with a declaration of principles, 
brief but comprehensive : "Father, thy will be done, and the glory 
be thine forever." On the other hand, Lucifer sought to take away 
from our Father in heaven His honor and His glory, and from man 
the agency that he there exercised. That the matters under consider- 
ation pertained to this earth life is apparent. When the Savior 
came upon the earth He made the declaration repeatedly that He 
came because the Father sent Him ; that He came to do the will of 
the Father. 

After His death, His resurrection and ascension to heaven, He 
visited the remnants of the Nephites on this American continent. 
In preaching to them, as recorded in the twenty-seventh chapter of 
Third Nephi, He made the declaration that He came here to the 
earth to do the will of the Father, and then asked those present: 
"What manner of men ought ye to be ?' He answered it for Himself : 
"Verily I say unto you, even as I am." My interpretation is that as 
the Savior came to earth to do the will of His Father, so we came 
to earth to do His will, and all of the commandments that the Lord 
has given are but an expression of His will concerning us. 

THE WORD OF WISDOM 

We are told in the scriptures that we should live by every word 
that proceedeth forth from the mouth of God. We are spending 
a lot of time and effort in trying to persuade the members of the 
Church, particularly our young people, to refrain from the use of 
tobacco and intoxicating drinks. The Lord says expressly that it is 



32 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Friday, April 5 First Dag 

His will that we do refrain from the use of those things. Are we 
quite consistent, brethren and sisters of the Church, when we 
use those things which the Lord has expressed, by revelation as 
His will that we do not use? 

TITHES AND OFFERINGS 

The Lord has given to us a plan, a financial plan, by which, if 
the Latter-day Saints were all to observe it, I am sure there would 
be an abundance of means in the hands of those in authority, by 
which, if there were any needy among us, their needs would be 
amply supplied — the law of the tithe and of the offerings. They 
are not a new doctrine and responsibility. We read in the Old 
Testament, in the Book of Malachi, how that the Lord charged 
ancient Israel with robbing Him in their tithes and their offerings. 
We have the responsibility here to give our Fast offerings, an equi- 
valent of what we would save by abstaining from food two meals on 
the Fast Day, one day each month. That I regard as the minimum that 
we can give and be justified before the Lord. Anything less than 
that, would certainly not be justified, but there is an opportunity 
to give all that we feel able to give, and according to the generosity 
of our hearts. Brethren and sisters, there are some that I know 
who give many times more than what they save by Fasting, but a 
great many others give no Fast offerings, and the results are there 
is not enough in the hands of the Bishops to take care of those who 
are in need. 

If all the Bishops had carried out the instructions, and the 
people had complied with those instructions, I repeat what I have 
said before, there would have been funds in the hands of the Author- 
ities of this Church that would have taken good care of the people 
who were in need. Not only that, they would have had a surplus 
that would have taken care of those in need in times of financial 
distress such as the people have been going through for the last 
few years. 

The finance plan, the tithe — if the tithing had been paid by all 
the members of this Church since that law was given, we would 
have had means in the Church, by which we could build the taber- 
nacles and meeting houses and gymnasiums and play centers of 
the Wards and Stakes in Zion without calling upon the people. The 
willing horse has to carry the load in this case, because so many 
of us have not done our duty. 

This morning we heard of wonderful accomplishments from 
the use of the tithing in the Church. I felt and feel now, brethren 
and sisters, that where I have paid a full tithing, I have assisted in 
all these splendid works for which tithing is used in the Church. 
I don't see how those who are not paying any tithing can claim 
any credit for what has been done and accomplished in the Church 
by the use of the tithing. 



ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS

CHOSEN ONES 

We read in the Book of Abraham, in the Pearl of Great Price, 
how that Abraham was shown the intelligences that were before 
the world was. He was told that among them were many of the 
Lord's noble and great ones, whom He had chosen to be His rulers, 
and that he, Abraham, was one of them. Joseph Smith was one of 
them, and those who succeeded him in presiding over this Church 
and directing its affairs no doubt were among the noble ones. 

And there stood one among them that was like unto God, and He 
said unto those who were with Him : We will go down, for there is 
space there, and we will take of these materials, and we will make an 
earth whereon these may dwell ; 

And we will prove them herewith, to see if they will do all things 
whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them. 

In other words, to see whether they would keep all His com- 
mandments. 

A HIGHER LAW INTRODUCED 

Brethren and sisters, we are being weighed in the balance, and 
some of us, I fear, will be found wanting in respect to the tithes and 
the offerings. 

In ancient Israel, because of a lack of faith, Moses and the 
Higher Priesthood were taken from them, and they were given the 
law of the carnal commandments, but they were given the law of 
the tithe. This law of carnal commandments was as a schoolmaster, 
to bring them up to a standard where they could receive the higher 
law of the Gospel. When the Savior came He said He did not come 
to destroy, but to fulfil the law, and He introduced the higher law 
of the Gospel, the spirit of which was to return good for evil. If a 
man smite you on one cheek, turn the other. Love your enemies. 
Bless them that curse you. Do good to them that hate you, and pray 
for those who despitefully use you and persecute you. 

This is the spirit of the Christ, the higher law of the Gospel, and 
if this spirit were enjoyed by the Latter-day Saints, there would be 
no difficulty about their keeping the commandments of the Lord 
with respect to the tithes and the offerings, and the Word of Wis- 
dom, and every other requirement. 

THE MEANING OF A HYMN 

We are commanded to love the Lord our God with all our heart, 
soul and mind, and our neighbor as ourself. If we were loving the 
Lord with all our hearts, there is no requirement He could make of 
us that we would not gladly and willingly comply with. We sing 
that beautiful song: 

We thank Thee O God for a Prophet, 
To guide us in these latter days; 



34 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Friday. April 5 Pint Day 

We thank Thee for sending the Gospel, 
To lighten our minds with its rays. 
We thank Thee for every blessing 
Bestowed by Thy bounteous hand. 
We feel it a pleasure to serve Thee, 
And love to obey Thy commands. 

I wonder how many of us think of that sentiment when we 
are singing it, and we sing it frequently. Are we thankful for a 
prophet to guide us in these latter days? If so, we will follow his 
lead, will we not? If we were following the lead of the President 
of this Church as a prophet of God to us, and to the world, there 
would be no trouble about our keeping the Word of Wisdom, about 
our paying our tithing, and meeting the other obligations that rest 
upon us as members of the Church. 

Do we really feel it a pleasure to serve the Lord in His appoint- 
ed way, which means, of course, sacrifice and self-denial? Do we 
love to obey His commands, to keep His commandments? Brethren 
and sisters, are we wholly consistent? Do we think of these things 
seriously? They are the weightier matters, things that pertain to 
eternity. If we obtain an exaltation, for which we are candidates, 
it will be not for believing in these principles : It will be for living 
them, as the Lord designed that we should. 

JOY IN DOING RIGHT 

We are told in the Book of Mormon that "Adam fell that men 
might be, and men are that they might have joy". It is my testi- 
mony to you, brethren and sisters, so far as my experience goes, 
that when I have met my religious obligations, the payment of my 
tithes honestly, and my offerings generously, keeping the Word of 
Wisdom, answering the calls that come upon me in the Church, 
my conscience is clear, and I have real joy. I want to tell you, 
brethren and sisters, that we rob ourselves of much of the joy we 
might have in this life, through a guilty conscience, a consciousness 
that our course of life is not approved of the Lord. 

May the Lord bless you, brethren and sisters, and reward those 
abundantly who are making such sacrifices for the accomplishment 
of the Lord's purposes, looking to the saving of the souls of His 
children, the living and the dead. And may He help those of us 
who are indifferent to our own interests and the interests and wel- 
fare of the work of the Lord, that our faith may be renewed and 
revived, and that we may prove our faith by devotion to the work 
of the Lord, I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.

ELDER JOHN A. WIDTSOE 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

My dear brethren and sisters: I rejoice in being again in at- 
tendance at one of our great General Conferences. They are refresh- 
ing periods to all of us who believe in the Gospel of the Lord Jesus 
Christ. 

A TRIBUTE TO PRESIDENT GRANT 

We regret that President Grant is not here. But we all rejoice 
to know that he is improving in health. I want to say that President 
Grant is not only the President of the Church, and our leader in that 
sense, but that the prophetic mantle of this day rests upon him. He 
is a prophet of God, and we shall do well to follow his example, listen 
to his teachings, and be worthy of his blessings. During the years 
that I have been permitted to labor among the General Authorities 
of the Church I have had the privilege on many occasions to witness 
the prophetic power that accompanies President Grant, and I bear 
testimony today, solemnly and soberly, that he is a prophet of the 
living God. 

A STANDARD TO THE WORLD 

In thinking about this Conference my mind has wandered rather 
far and wide. Probably the thought that has come to me most often 
has been as to the place and purpose of the Church in this war-torn 
world, this world of strife and unhappiness. What is our mission 
to the world ? I have turned to the scriptures to get the answer, and 
have found the answer, both in ancient and modern scriptures. It 
is that the Church of Christ at all times must be as a standard to 
the nations, a standard to which all nations, all people, all men may 
turn as they seek safety, peace, and happiness. 

It is our great mission, brethren and sisters, to be a standard 
to all the world, and we say without hesitation that those who obey 
and comply with that standard will find that which men most desire 
in life. It is a bold declaration, tremendously bold, that a small peo- 
ple in the valleys of these mountains, misunderstood, often harassed 
by persecution, may become the standard by which all mankind may 
be led to peace and happiness ; but so it is. I am not saying it. It is 
the word of the Lord, both in ancient and modern days. If this stand- 
ard would be accepted by the world the things we pray and hope for 
would soon come. 

INDIVIDUAL RESPONSIBILITY 

Let me say that the Church of itself cannot be this standard. 
Since the Church is made up of individuals, it becomes an individ- 
ual responsibility to make the Church a standard for the nations. 
I must be a standard in my life. I must so conduct myself that I 
may be a standard worthy of being followed by those who seek the 
greater joy in life. 



36 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Friday, April 5 first Day 

The question as to individual responsibility for the welfare of 
the Church was asked in the early days by members of the Church. 
Several of the men who labored with the Prophet Joseph Smith 
came to him in those early days and said: "What shall we do?" 
They might have said: "What shall we do to be saved?" The 
Lord in every instance gave an answer. We have a series of short 
revelations in the Doctrine and Covenants, which are the answers 
to that question. I find in every one a significant statement, worded 
almost identically in all of these revelations, to Hyrum Smith, David 
Whitmer, Oliver Cowdery, and others of less fame in the Church: 
"Keep my commandments, and seek to bring forth and establish the 
cause of Zion." That is our business, the business of the Latter-day 
Saints. 

From one point of view, it is selfish enough, perhaps, to keep the 
commandments that I may be blessed, but it is something even 
greater to keep the commandments that Zion may be established. As 
the foundation of His great cause the Lord gave the law of sacrifice. 
Unless we give of ourselves we cannot build Zion, or anything else 
worthy of the great cause that the Lord has given us. The law of 
sacrifice, from the day of Adam to the present day, in one form or 
another, is the basic principle of life among the communities of 
Saints. 

So we need, in this Church and Kingdom, for our own and the 
world's welfare a group of men and women in their individual lives 
who shall be as a light to the nations, and really standards for the 
world to follow. Such a people must be different from the world 
as it now is. There is no opportunity for Latter-day Saints to say 
we shall be as the world is, unless the world has the same aim that we 
have. We are here to build Zion to Almighty God, for the blessing 
of all the world. In that aim we are unique and different from all 
other peoples. We must respect that obligation, and not be afraid 
of it. We cannot walk as other men, or talk as other men, or do as 
other men, for we have a different destiny, obligation, and responsi- 
bility placed upon us, and we must fit ourselves for that great destiny 
and obligation. 

JESUS' PRAYER FOR HIS DISCIPLES 

I remember the wonderful prayer offered by the Savior in Geth- 
semane just before His crucifixion, when He talked to His Father — 
perhaps the most sublime prayer known to us — in which He said : 
"I pray not that thou shouldst take them" — He spake of His dis- 
ciples — "out of the world, but that thou shouldst keep them from 
evil. They are not of the world." 

Just now, perhaps, as never before, we need to remember that 
this Church and Kingdom, and the members thereof are not to be 
out of the world, but they must not be of the world. There is a 
vast difference between those two conditions — the difference be- 
tween light and darkness. We are a peculiar people and ever shall be 
and ever must be a peculiar people. 



ELDER JOHN A. WIDTSOE 



37 



Let us remember the obligation that rests upon the Latter-day 
Saints to build Zion. It is not so difficult to carry out, for the Lord 
is our helper, and He will be with us and assist us and instruct us and 
make us able to do the work that lies before us, if only we have a 
sincere desire to be the Lord's helpers. 

Let us remember one of the best known statements in our Lat- 
ter-day scripture — the Book of Mormon — in which Nephi's faith is 
evidenced by this statement : "For I know that the Lord giveth no 
commandments unto the children of men, save he shall prepare a 
way for them that they may accomplish the thing which He com- 
mandeth them." 

We must be unique, separate in ideals from most of the world. 
We have the greatest mission in all the world. But let us not be 
afraid. The Lord has called us to His Kingdom and His service. 
He will make it possible for us to do the work He would like us to do. 

THE COMMANDMENTS OF THE LORD HAVE SPIRITUAL MEANING 

That brings me to the final thought that has been moving 
through my mind the last few days, that all these things, all the com- 
mandments, all the wonderful statistics that were read this forenoon, 
which made us grateful, all the achievements of the Church, have 
great spiritual significance. We of the Kingdom of God cannot walk 
merely on earth ; we must walk in heaven as we walk on earth. 

The Lord has told us so in modern revelation, in another well- 
known and much-loved message to the Prophet Joseph Smith : 

Wherefore, verily I say unto you that all things unto me are 
spiritual, and not at any time have I given unto you a law which was 
temporal; neither any man, nor the children of men; neither Adam, 
your father, whom I created. 

At no time has God given His children a commandment which 
does not have a spiritual significance. Often I fear we fail in our 
obedience, because we look upon God's commandments with tem- 
poral eyes, and fail to understand their spiritual meaning. Let me 
call your attention to three or four commandments which have a 
deep spiritual meaning. 

THE WORD OF WISDOM HELPS IN SELF-MASTERY 

The Word of Wisdom is one of the best known of all the laws 
given to His people in these latter days. It was given in the year 
1833, and has been preached by every President and leader of the 
Church. Every father and mother should be preaching and teach- 
ing the Word of Wisdom — a protection to the body against ill health. 
The observance of the Word of Wisdom does give us sound bodies, 
lengthens out our lives here on earth, gives us clear minds, wisdom 
and understanding; but it has even a greater meaning than that, a 
spiritual meaning. For if I am able to observe the Word of Wisdom, 
refrain from the things forbidden in the Word of Wisdom, do the 



38 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Friday. April 5 Pttst Day 

things there advised, I thereby become master of my appetites. I 
can look my appetites, as it were, in the face, and say : "Get thee be- 
hind me." I am master, not subject to an appetite. The cigarette 
is not my master, I am the master. This glass of liquor is not my 
master, I am the master. Can the Lord build Zion, can He establish 
the cause of Zion, can He make us a standard for all the nations to 
follow unless we are masters of ourselves? If we are but slaves to 
an appetite, what can the Lord do with us? Great as He is the work 
shall fail. 

TITHING IN A SPIRITUAL SENSE 

Take another law that has been talked about several times here 
today, the law of tithing. It has built meeting houses, sent me)n 
and women on missions, maintained our Temples,, and the many 
activities that President Clark reported in his stirring address this 
morning. The spiritual value of tithing is that if I obey the law of 
tithing sincerely I separate myself from the love of earthly things, 
and become strong enough to love the things of heaven better than 
the things of earth. No man can rise very high who lives by earthly 
things alone. The things of earth drag us down unless spiritually 
made alive. I must look upon things of the earth merely as helps 
in my temporal life, no more than that. 

I believe that until mankind is able to divorce itself from its 
love of earthly things we shall not be able to build God's kingdom 
or be a standard for the nations to follow. 

Another principle spoken of here today — missionary work — has 
a distinct spiritual equivalent. In it lies a spiritual principle. I cre- 
ate and develop within myself, when I give of my time and means 
and talents to the preaching of the Gospel a love for my fellow men, 
brotherly love. God is love. Without love we can do nothing in the 
building of His Kingdom. 

WORK FOR THE DEAD DEVELOPS SPIRITUALITY 

And fourth and last — although many might be dealt with in this 
fashion — -is the work that will be celebrated here tonight in the Tab- 
ernacle. One hundred years ago the first baptisms for the dead were 
performed. Since then we have done a tremendous amount of work 
for the dead. We have built Temples and spent time and money in 
gathering genealogies. We spend days and days in the Temples 
serving the dead. The spiritual principle back of that activity is 
the development of a more perfect love, a more complete unselfish- 
ness. It is well enough to preach to those who are living. They may 
become my friends and neighbors, my helpers, I may see the fruits of 
my labors, but it is quite different to spend my strength and time 
and money for those long since dead, who are to me only names. 
By giving myself in the spirit of true helpfulness to those that have 
gone before me, I develop within myself, within my heart and soul, 
an abounding love very near to that of God Himself. Then the sel- 



ELDER RULON S. WELLS 



39 



fishness of the world fades away, and upon the conquest of selfish- 
ness hinges all human welfare. 

ZION TO BE BUILT BY OVERCOMING SELFISHNESS 

I want to call the attention of the Latter-day Saints to the fact 
that there are always two sides to Gospel principles, the one per- 
taining to this earth for our guide and help here, and the other deal- 
ing with the eternal spiritual realities, the eternal principles of the 
Gospel by which men touch the unseen world. What a standard 
to all the world we would be if we all were masters of ourselves, 
of our appetites, if we could set aside earthly joys for spiritual wel- 
fare ! If we really loved our fellowmen, if we were really impelled 
by unselfishness in all that we do, then we would be a standard to the 
nations, the power of the Lord would be ours, and Zion would be 
built through our efforts. 

God bless us in all that we do in behalf of this great work. I 
bear testimony to the truth of the restored Gospel of the Lord Jesus 
Christ, its prophetic power and service, from Joseph Smith to our 
present leader, and I do it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, 
Amen. 

ELDER RULON S. WELLS 

Of the First Council of the Seventy 

All the days of my life — and they are now many — I have been 
brought up under the influence of the Church of Jesus Christ of Lat- 
ter-day Saints. My heart is full of gratitude that I have a member- 
ship in this Church. I remember from my very youth many of the 
testimonies that have come to me by reason of that membership. 
Many, many times has the Lord manifested unto me the truth of 
His everlasting Gospel as it has been restored to the earth through 
the instrumentality of Joseph Smith, the Prophet, in the day and 
age in which we live. 

A TESTIMONY AT AN EARLY AGE 

It was only, very likely, a few days or weeks after my baptism, 
which occurred shortly after I was eight years of age, that I re- 
ceived a testimony. I did not then know definitely just what it was ; 
I hardly appreciated what it meant, but the Lord manifested to me 
the truth of this work in my boyhood. I recollect very well a re- 
markable incident which occurred as I was coming home from 
school one day (the school being located across the street eastward 
from the present location of the West High School, in the building 
then known as the Union Academy, under the tutorship of Doctor 
Doremus), returning by my usual route up North Temple Street, 
then known as Jordan Street, on the south bank of City Creek, which 
was a winding, deep canyon stream going down Jordan Street until 



40 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Friday. April 5 First Day 

it entered into the Jordan River. City Creek was bounded on either 
side by wild rose bushes and willows. As I was wandering home 
after school I came to a place immediately north of where the 
Temple now stands — ("The Temple not built, but scattered 'round 
in native rock upon the ground"). As I went down close to the 
edge of the creek and then arose to a higher elvation it seemed to 
me that I was almost lifted to heaven. I felt the power of the Spirit 
of the Lord upon me. I did not then know what it was, but I was 
made happy and full of joy and gladness, even to overflowing. A 
boy, a lad of nine years of age, to receive such a deep impression 
that to this day it has remained with me, vivid in my memory, even 
to the smallest details ! 

I learned to recognize what this feeling was when in later years 
I traveled as a missionary and the Spirit of the Lord came to me 
and manifested its power by giving me words of utterance in setting 
forth the principles of eternal life. And, I said to myself, "that is 
just exactly the same feeling that I had as a boy when I stood upon 
the bank of City Creek north of where the Temple now stands. The 
Lord poured out His Spirit upon me and I felt it in every fiber of my 
being. And now here as I am called abroad to proclaim this ever- 
lasting Gospel, comes this same testimony, and I know that it came 
from God." 

A PRAYER IN THE CANYON 

That is only one of the many testimonies that I have had. I 
do not mind now telling one or two, for I have had many of them in 
the course of my experiences, but they have been for me. When I 
went upon my first mission I was blessed by President Brigham 
Young. He laid his hands upon my head on the twenty-second day 
of October, 1875, and blessed me and ordained me a Seventy and 
set me apart for my first mission, which was in Switzerland and 
Germany. I went upon my mission, but prior to my departure I had 
been working at my father's saw-mills in Big Cottonwood Canyon. 
I hardly knew that Conference was in session in October, 1875. One 
day a strange feeling came over me as I stood upon the top of a large 
pile of lumber, filling orders that had come from Salt Lake City to 
my father's lumber mill. And an impulse came to me to "get down 
from this pile of lumber and go up to the office" which was a lumber 
shanty serving the three-fold purpose of my bedroom, store and 
office, where I kept the accounts of the men that were employed 
around the mill. I also had the task of measuring the logs as they 
came to the mill, and the lumber as it came from the mill. These 
loggers indulged in a great deal of profanity and when we remon- 
strated with them they claimed the oxen understood no other lan- 
guage. I mention this so you will understand the environment in 
which I then found myself. Without knowing why I followed that 
impulse, I descended from the tall pile of lumber and went into the 
office, and as soon as I did so I closed the door, and approaching the 



ELDER RULON S. WELLS 



41 



middle of the room (there was nothing to lean upon at all) I fell 
down upon my knees and prayed unto God that He would send me 
where He wanted me to go. I did not know why I said that; I was 
not aware of the Conference then being held, nor had I any intima- 
tion whatever of receiving a missionary call, but at that very time 
(I do not know that it was the identical minute, but it is quite 
possible the Conference was in session, and my name was being 
called with many others to go upon a mission.) the Lord com- 
pelled me to get upon my knees and ask for this blessed privilege 
of being the bearer of glad tidings in the days of my young manhood, 
to go out into the world. What was this manifestation? Surely 
it must have been that same Spirit that took possession of me in 
my boyhood days. 

The following day my mother rode on horseback up to the saw- 
mill to let me know that I had been called upon my mission. 

Let me here say that at this time I was occasionally associated 
with people entertaining non-Mormon views, some of them being 
infidels and atheists, but in every discussion I found myself defend- 
ing the existence of God. I may have been somewhat neglectful of 
my duties, although I was always more or less of a religious turn of 
mind, and had been reading some books that probably were not 
as wholesome as they might have been — Ingersoll and other infidels 
— and my mind had become a little bit disturbed. 

A REMARKABLE DREAM 

While on my way to my mission field, crossing the ocean on 
the Steamship Dakota, I went down into the salon of the ship one 
day, and lay upon one of the cushioned benches surrounding the 
eating tables, where I fell asleep. While asleep the Lord appeared 
to me in a dream and I saw Him standing before me ; and by His side 
was William W. Taylor, one of the other missionaries, a son of 
President John Taylor, a boy like myself going upon his first mis- 
sion. He stood by the side of the Savior, and the Savior extended 
His hand to me and grasping my hand, holding it tight, looked at me 
in the face and said: "Will you ever doubt again?" Brother 
Taylor, who stood beside Him said : "I believe that is enough for 
him." With that, the Lord let go of my hand and I awoke. 

That is only another instance of how the Lord has been training 
and preparing me for my life's ministry, and I know that this is His 
work. I could recite many other experiences that I have had in my 
long life, many wonderful testimonies given to me. I have not 
published them ; I have not given them out in public meetings ; I do 
not remember ever having done so before. I hope that I may be 
pardoned if I ask of you now, my brothers and sisters, to accept 
of this testimony one hundred percent, for I know that this is the 
work of the Lord and that He has commissioned His servants to 
carry the Gospel to the nations of the earth, for it is to be preached 
as a witness unto all nations before the end shall come.

Friday, April 5 First Pay 

ADMIRATION FOR LEADERS 

I bear testimony that this is the work of the Lord and I uphold 
and sustain this work and the men who have been chosen to stand 
at the head. How I have admired their administration, and how I 
do admire President Grant and his counselors and our file leaders 
who are now leading the affairs of this Church ! How I do admire the 
wonderful work that is being carried on by these men of God ! I 
do more than admire them ; I love them with a love unfeigned, and 
I know that they are true servants of God. May the Lord help us 
all and bless us according to our needs, I pray in the name of Jesus 
Christ, Amen. 

Supplement to Elder Rulon S. Wells' Sermon 

AN ASSURANCE OF THE LORD'S APPROVAL 

I have in mind another very extremely interesting experience 
which preceded my call to the First Council of the Seventy. I told 
a personal friend of mine who was commenting on my Conference 
address of this experience, and she remarked that I should have 
included it also in my talk, so I am taking the liberty now of relating 
it although it was not delivered in my Conference Talk ! 

April 6th, 1892, the capstone of the Temple ( SaltLake) was 
laid, and during the year that followed a campaign to secure suf- 
ficient money to finish the Temple was inaugurated and carried to 
a successful conclusion, and, as well known, the Temple was dedi- 
cated April 6, 1893, just forty years after the laying of the corner 
stone in 1853. Like many others I took part in this campaign and 
assisted in making the collection from members of our Ward, I being 
one of the workers in the 18th Ward. Also like others I had a strong 
desire to put myself in a proper condition for entering the Temple at 
the time of its dedication. I wanted to receive another manifesta- 
tion of the Lord's approval of me, and I prayed to Him earnestly 
that I might receive the assurance that I was approved of Him. I 
did not ask that I might see an angel or hear a voice from heaven, I 
only wanted to know that I had His approval of me as a member 
of His Church, worthy of attending the dedication of the Temple. I 
knew nothing of the vacancy existing in the First Council of the 
Seventy until I was notified in a note received from Brother George 
Reynolds, who was then private secretary of the First Presidency, 
who notified me that I had been selected to fill the vacancy occa- 
sioned by the death of Jacob Gates as one of the First Seven Presi- 
dents of Seventies. This notification was received on April 5, 1893, 
and my name was presented at the Conference held that day, and I 
was set apart the same day. On April 6 1 sat with my brethren of 
the First Seven Presidents of Seventies on the stand and while 
sitting there I commented to myself: "Well, I have heard no voice, 
and I have seen no angel, but here I am, and I feel I have been ac- 
cepted and approved of God.' 1 ' 

The Brigham Young University Chorus sang an athem, "Open 
Our Eyes" (W. C. Macfarlane). 



ELDER JOSEPH F. MERRILL

ELDER JOSEPH F. MERRILL 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

To say that these are troublous times characterized by strenu- 
ous struggles for goods, position and power is to say something trite. 
It is equally trite to say these times are also characterized by re- 
ligious indifference and doubts, moral delinquencies and a worship 
of mammon. So no one questions the need of reforms or of helpful 
admonition relative to many things. 

We who are gathered here are deeply concerned, of course, with 
the faith and practices of our people. Partaking of the spirit of the 
times there is more or less questioning among us relative to these 
things. Conditions are different and are continually changing. 
Should not some of our practices likewise change is a question fre- 
quently asked. In view of all this some even of our devout members 
ask for advice touching matters of our faith and practice. 

COMMANDMENTS REGARDING THE SABBATH 

A question in the minds of many, particularly of our young 
people, asks what is a proper observance of the Sabbath day — what 
may we do and may not do on Sunday? And in view of what they 
see this is a reasonable question to ask. They are familiar with the 
injunctions given to ancient Israel : 

Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy. 
Six days shalt thou labor, and do all thy work ; 

But the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God; in it thou 
shalt not do any work, thou nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, 
nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy 
gates. (Exodus 20:8-11.) 

This quotation is made of course from the Ten Commandments. 
But concerning the Sabbath we may further read that the Lord spoke 
to Moses, commanding him thus : 

Speak thou also unto the children of Israel, saying, verily my Sab- 
baths ye shall keep : for it is a sign between me and you throughout your 
generations; that ye may know that I am the Lord that doth sanctify 
you. 

Ye shall keep the Sabbath therefore ; for it is holy. * * * 
Wherefore the children of Israel shall keep the Sabbath, to observe 
the Sabbath throughout their generations, for a perpetual covenant. It 
is a sign between me and the children of Israel forever. (Exodus 
31:13-17.) 

A violation of this law of the Sabbath by ancient Israel was a 
matter so serious that the Lord commanded the offender should be 
put to death. 

In the course of Israelitish history we read that successive 
prophets rebuked the people for neglect or profanation of the Sab- 
bath. Nehemiah ascribed the affliction of the nation to the for- 
feiture of divine protection through Sabbath violation (Neh. 13: 



44 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Friday, April 5 First Day 

15-22). Through Ezekiel the Lord reaffirmed the significance of 
the Sabbath as a mark of His covenant with Israel, and sternly up- 
braided those who observed not the day. (Ezek. 20:12-24) 

Yes, our moderns say, ancient Israel was taught that the Sab- 
bath day was holy and its profanation was a very serious offense. 
But conditions then were vastly different from those of today. We 
agree. 

TEACHINGS OF MODERN SCRIPTURES 

But for guidance in matters of faith and practice, Latter-day 
Saints are not wholly dependent upon the Bible and ancient proph- 
ets. Fortunately we have modern scriptures and modern prophets 
— invaluable possessions. The Lord has spoken in this dispensation 
as well as in dispensations of biblical times. 

What do these scriptures and prophets teach in our day relative 
to Sabbath observance and other religious duties? Let us see. 

As early as August, 1831, only sixteen months after the Church 
was organized, the Lord gave a very beautiful revelation through the 
Prophet Joseph Smith, reaffirming the biblical code of a religious 
life acceptable to Him. 

I quote from Section 59 of the Doctrine and Covenants : 

5. Wherefore, I give unto them a commandment, saying thus : Thou 
shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, with all thy might, mind, 
and strength ; and in the name of Jesus Christ thou shalt serve Him. 

6. Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. Thou shalt not steal ; 
neither commit adultery, nor kill, nor do anything like unto it. 

7. Thou shalt thank the Lord thy God in all things. 

8. Thou shalt offer a sacrifice unto the Lord thy God in righteous- 
ness, even that of a broken heart and a contrite spirit. 

9. And that thou may est more fully keep thyself unspotted, from the 
world, thou shalt go to the house of prayer and offer up thy sacraments 
upon my holy day ; 

10. For verily this is a day appointed unto you to rest from your 
labors, and to pay thy devotions unto the Most High ; 

11. Nevertheless thy vows shall be offered up in righteousness on all 
days and at all times ; 

12. But remember that on this, the Lord's day, thou shalt offer thine 
oblations and thy sacraments unto the Most High, confessing thy sins 
unto thy brethren, and before the Lord. 

13. And on this day thou shalt do none other thing, only let thy food 
be prepared with singleness of heart that thy fasting may be perfect, or, 
in other words, that thy joy may be full. 

14. Verily, this is fasting and prayer, or in other words, rejoicing 
and prayer. 

15. And inasmuch as ye do these things with thanksgiving, with 
cheerful hearts and countenances, not with much laughter, for this is sin, 
but with a glad heart and a cheerful countenance — 

16. Verily I say, that inasmuch as ye do this, the fulness of the earth 
is yours, the beasts of the field and the fowls of the air, and that which 
climbeth upon the trees and walketh upon the earth ; 

17. Yea, and the herb, and the good things which come of the earth, 
whether for food or for raiment, or for houses, or for barns, or for or- 
chards, or for gardens, or for vineyards; 

18. Yea, all things which come of the earth, in the season thereof, 



ELDER JOSEPH F. MERRILL 



45 



are made for the benefit and use of man, both to please the eye and to 
gladden the heart; 

19. Yea, for food and for raiment, for taste and for smell, to 
strengthen the body and to enliven the soul. 

20. And it pleaseth God that He hath given all these things unto 
man; for unto this end were they made to be used, with judgment, not 
to excess, neither by extortion. 

21. And in nothing doth man offend God, or against none is His 
wrath kindled, save those who confess not His hand in all things, and 
obey not His commandments. 

22. Behold, this is according to the law and the prophets ; where- 
fore, trouble me no more concerning this matter. 

23. But learn that he who doeth the works of righteousness shall 
receive his reward, even peace in this world, and eternal life in the 
world to come. 

24. I, the Lord, have spoken it, and the Spirit beareth record. 
Amen. (Doctrine and Covenants 59:5-24.) 

PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITHES ADVICE 

But the critic who wants a free Sunday may say this revelation 
was given a hundred years ago when conditions were also vastly 
different from those today. In reply I call attention to the fact that 
the Church has today a divinely inspired leadership as it had then. 
What do these leaders say? Let me quote some of the words of 
President Joseph F. Smith as found in "Gospel Doctrine," as 
follows : 

The Sabbath is a day of rest and worship designated and set apart 
by special commandment of the Lord to the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints, and we should honor and keep it holy. We should 
also teach our children this principle. 

True, Sunday is a day of rest, a change from the ordinary occupa- 
tions of the week, but it is more than that. It is a day of worship, a 
day in which the spiritual life of man may be enriched. A day of indolence, 
a day of physical recuperation is too often a very different thing from 
the God-ordained day of rest. Physical exhaustion and indolence are 
incompatible with a spirit of worship. A proper observance of the duties 
and devotions of the Sabbath day will, by its change and its spiritual 
life, give the best rest that men can enjoy on the Sabbath day. 

What shall we do on the Sabbath day? * * * Honor the Sabbath day 
and keep it holy, just as the Lord has commanded us to do. Go to the 
house of prayer. Listen to instructions. Bear testimony to the truth. * * * 
When we go home, get the family together. Let us sing a few songs, 
read a chapter or two from the Bible, Book of Mormon, or Doctrine and 
Covenants, and discuss principles pertaining to advancement in divine 
knowledge. * * * 

It is imperatively necessary at all times, and especially so when our 
associations do not afford us the moral and spiritual support which we 
require for our advancement, that we go to the house of the Lord to 
worship and mingle with the Saints, that their moral and spiritual 
influence may help to correct our false impressions and restore us to that 
life which the duties and obligations of our conscience and true religion 
impose upon us." 

The reason for this required course upon the Sabbath day is plainly 
stated in the revelations. It is that one may more fully keep himself 
unspotted from the world ; and to this end, also, the Saints are required to 
go to the house of prayer and offer up their sacraments on the Sabbath day. 

Now, what is the promise to the Saints who observe the Sabbath?

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



First Day 



He then iread from the revelation given in Section 59 of the 
Doctrine and Covenants the words of the Lord that I have already 
recited and proceeded to remark : 

All these blessings are promised to those who keep the commandments, 
among which is the important one, to observe properly the Sabbath day. 
The Lord is not pleased with people who know these things and do them not. 

He went on to say : 

Men are not resting from their labors when they plow, and plant 
and haul and dig. They are not resting when they linger around the 
home all day on Sunday, doing odd jobs that they have been too busy to 
do on other days. 

Men are not showing zeal and ardor in their religious faith and duty 
when they bustle off early Sunday morning in automobiles to the canyons, 
the resorts or places of amusement with their wives and children. Not 
in seeking pleasure and recreation do they offer their time and atten- 
tion in the worship of the Lord; nor can they thus rejoice in the spirit 
of forgiveness and worship that comes with partaking of the holy sac- 
rament. 

People are not keeping holy the Sabbath day, when they spend the day 
loafing around the village ice cream stand or restaurant, playing games 
or in riding, fishing, shooting, or engaged in physical sports, excursions 
and outings. Such is not the course that will keep them unspotted from the 
world, but rather one that will deprive them of the rich promises of the 
Lord, giving them sorrow instead of joy, and unrest and anxiety instead of 
the peace that ccmes with works of righteousness. 

I shall end my reading from President Smith with these words : 

Let us play and take recreation to our hearts' content during other 
days, but on the Sabbath let us rest, worship, go to the house of prayer, 
partake of the sacrament, eat our food with singleness of heart, and pay 
our devotions to God, that the fulness of the earth may be ours, and that 
we may have peace in this world and eternal life in the world to come. 
(Gospel Doctrine pages 304-309.) 



And now I give you a statement of the views of President 
Grant's administration relative to Sabbath observance. A few years 
ago the First Presidency published an editorial on this topic in the 
Deseret News. It was entitled "Sunday and The Home" and is 
as follows : 

The Lord's day is a holy day — not a holiday. It has been set apart 
as a day of rest and worship. A sacred Sabbath begets reverence for 
God. It is not pleasing in His sight that the day be given over to pleas- 
ure seeking in places of amusement or elsewhere. 

Sunday Schools and meetings have been so arranged as to meet the 
convenience of the people and leave a considerable portion of the Sabbath 
day without Church appointments. We earnestly appeal to the people 
to keep their meeting appointments faithfully and to utilize that portion, of 
Sunday not appointed for meetings in promoting family association in the 
home, with the purpose of stimulating and establishing greater home 
fealty, a closer companionship among parents and children, and more 
intimate relations among all kindred. 



THE FIRST PRESIDENCY'S APPEAL 



ELDER JOSEPH F. MERRILL 



47 



We believe that it is unnecessary for families to go beyond their 
own homes or those of their kindred for the relaxation and association 
which are proper for the Sabbath day, and we therefore discourage 
more traveling than is necessary for this purpose and attendance upon 
appointed meetings. 

Let all unnecessary labor be suspended and let no encouragement be 
given by the attendance of members of the Church at places of amuse- 
ment and recreation on the Sabbath day. If Sunday is spent in our meet- 
ings and in our homes great blessings will come to our families and 
communities. 

HEBER J. GRANT, 
ANTHONY W. IVINS, 
CHARLES W. NIBLEY, 
September 1, 1928. First Presidency. 

SABBATH OBSERVANCE A BLESSING 

Thus, if we please the Lord, among other things we must do is 
to keep holy the Sabbath day. And the way to do this has not es- 
sentially changed from the days of Moses and ancient Israel down 
through the ages to the present moment. 

But sad as it is to see, the modern Christian world has almost 
forgotten the sanctity of the Sabbath. With the vast majority the 
day has ceased to be holy. Instead it is a holiday, a day of amuse- 
ments and pleasure-seeking, of all kinds of activities foreign to 
worship and holiness. 

I speak of these things because some of our own people are 
becoming worldly minded with respect to the Sabbath. This is 
certainly displeasing to the Lord who will certainly withhold bless- 
ings otherwise obtainable. 

We read in the Doctrine and Covenants these words : 

"There is a law, irrevocably decreed in heaven before the founda- 
tions of this world, upon which all blessings are predicated. And when 
we obtain any blessing from God, it is by obedience to that law upon 
which it is predicated." (Doc. and Cov. 130:20-21.) 

This is a law of the universe, governing things material, as all 
scientists know. Through the Prophet Joseph Smith we learn that 
it also applies to things spiritual. 

The blessings divinely promised for keeping holy the Lord's 
Sabbath are invaluable, as the scriptures indicate. Hence let no 
Latter-day Saint sacrifice these blessings by going fishing, deer hunt- 
ing, golfing, amusement seeking, joy riding, to sports, movies and 
games, or engaging in other Sabbath-breaking activities. 

Brethren and sisters, let us show our confidence in the Lord and 
in the divinity of this Church by abstaining from participation in 
the sinful practices of Babylon, so common on every hand. In any 
case, as surely as the night follows the day we shall finally reap 
as we have sown. The Lord help us to sow wisely and well I pray 
in the name of Christ our Lord, Amen.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Fitst Day 



ELDER THOMAS E. McKAY 

Former President of the Swiss Mission 

Brothers and sisters, I sense keenly the responsibility resting 
upon me at this time. I confess I am a little frightened because of 
that responsibility. I pray humbly that I may be directed by the 
Spirit of God in what I say. I remember just before my farewell 
party, when I was leaving for my first mission, I was very much 
worried as to what I should say, and I thought — "how thankful and 
happy I will be after this mission is over, so that I will not be so 
frightened and worry so much when I am called upon to speak.' 1 ' 
That was forty years ago, I am now returning from my third mission, 
and I confess I am just as frightened, and I have worried as much, 
or more, I believe, than I did then. 

I remember also a few lines of poetry that were written on the 
fly-leaf of a little book that was given to me at that time, a book of 
views of beautiful Ogden Canyon ; I appreciated them so much that 
I memorized them. I appreciate them even more today, after spend- 
ing about nine years in the mission field in Europe, than I did then. 
They are as follows : 

There is a land of every land the pride, beloved of Heaven 

o'er all the earth beside. 
There is a spot of earth supremely blest, 

A dearer, sweeter spot than all the rest. 

Where is that land, that spot of earth to find? 

Art thou a man, a patriot? Look around 
And O thou shalt find, where'er thy footsteps roam, 

That land, thy country, and that spot thy home. 

I am more grateful today than ever before for my country and 
for my home. I appreciate and love them more. I love and appreci- 
ate my wife and children, my parentage, my brothers and sisters and 
friends, more than ever before. We are glad to be home again. Of 
course, we have enjoyed our mission. We have enjoyed our asso- 
ciation with your sons, the finest missionaries in the world. We 
wish to thank you parents for sending such sons into the mission 
field. It has been a great inspiration to us to associate with such 
choice young men. Some of them are sons of missionaries with 
whom we labored when presiding over the Swiss-German Mission 
before. 

And by the way, tomorrow, Saturday, the 6th of April, will bp 
just twenty-eight years since I reported my return from presiding 
over the Swiss and German Mission ; at that time, as I recall, Presi- 
dent Joseph F. Smith presided. The music was furnished by the 
Brigham Young University choir, conducted by Professor Lund. 
Apostle Hyrum Smith was the first speaker. Many changes have 
taken place since that time. A number of changes have taken place 
since we left a little over thirty months ago. We miss some very 
dear faces here on the stand. 



ELDER THOMAS E. McKAY 



49 



It has been a wonderful experience, brothers and sisters, to be 
in the mission field for the third time. The Lord said, through «the 
Savior : 

If ye do the work ye shall know. My doctrine is not mine, but 
His that sent me. If any man will do his will, he shall know of the 
doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself. 

I have seen the fulfilment of that promise. People that I met 
on my first mission, forty years ago, have sons now in the mission 
field, or they have been. Babies that I blessed on that first mission 
are now leaders, one of them presiding over the West German Mis- 
sion. Many of the parents, who were Sunday School children at 
that time, have had sons in the mission field. All of the missionaries 
in the Swiss Mission, except two, have been born since that mission 
twenty-eight years ago. The large majority of these missionaries 
are sons of either parents or grandparents born in Switzerland, and 
I want to tell you parents that they are a credit to you and a credit 
to the Church, and their strong testimonies, as well as those of their 
parents, are a practical demonstration of the promise, "if ye will do 
the work, ye shall know." 

The Swiss and German Mission twenty-eight years ago com- 
prised all of Germany, Austria, Hungary, Switzerland and France. 
Today there are five Missions in these countries. They are doing 
well. Of course, they are handicapped because of the evacuation of 
all our missionaries and Mission presidents, but I am pleased to 
report that the local people are carrying on. Quite a number of 
those people who are now in charge of the work have been born in 
the Church; they understand the Gospel and are well qualified to 
carry on ; they have faith ; they are not discouraged because, as they 
say, they have the Gospel. 

Some of our Branches have had to be closed, but in the main 
they are all functioning. Two Branches which we have had to close 
— very fine Branches too, one of which I think had the best record 
in tithe-paying in the Church — were located in Strassbourg and 
Muehlhausen, France. These cities were evacuated when war was 
declared. The people, our members among them, had to leave over 
night, with only a bundle of clothing to take with them. For weeks 
we didn't know just where they were. Finally we were able to get 
some letters through, and they were located. As soon as arrange- 
ments could be made with the French and Swiss authorities for per- 
mission to cross the border, one of our brethren was sent to visit 
them, taking a considerable sum of money with him to help make 
them as comfortable as possible. 

We had learned, just for an example, that thirty-five thousand 
people were being taken care of in a city of thirty thousand popula- 
tion. You can imagine what that would mean, with the limited 
accommodations. Some members, we learned, - were sleeping in 
bath-rooms ; others sleeping in the halls. So we sent considerable 
money with this good brother, a local brother, to buy bed springs, 



50 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Friday, April 5 First Day 

bedding, curtains, and other things. By sending- some telegrams, 
and telephoning, he succeeded in getting most of them together. 
They held a testimony meeting. 

When this brother came back he said : "President McKay, you 
sent me there to give them spiritual uplift and to encourage them, but I 
received much more help spiritually from them than I was able to 
give them." Those people, although they didn't know whether they 
would ever see an Elder again, an authority of the Church, had put 
away their tithing as usual. They had received work — some of them 
— and they had been blessed. This local brother brought back nearly 
as much money as we had sent to help them. They said : "You 
express our thankfulness to President McKay for the help that he 
has sent us, and tell him that we are all right, and are not discour- 
aged, because we have the Gospel." That is the faith of those peo- 
ple over there, brothers and sisters. They are keeping the command- 
ments of the Lord and are doing the will of the Father. 

It is difficult to keep all the Branches organized. We get them 
organized, then our brethren are taken into the army. About six 
hundred of our brethren are in the army in Germany. Seven of them 
have lost their lives — not in battle, however. They are praying that 
they will not have to fight. They are peace-loving, those members. 
They have no hate in their hearts, but a love for all mankind, the 
love of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. We have committees appointed, 
so that as soon as a vacancy occurs, another man is called to take 
his place. We have called sisters on missions, to take charge of the 
office work, and they are getting along very nicely. They are keep- 
ing busy and are trying to do the will of the Father. 

They know, as I know, that God lives; that He is our Father; 
that we are all His children; that He loves us, and because He loves 
us He has given us the Gospel. Every commandment He has given 
is for our progress and happiness in this life, as well as our life here- 
after. Our members know this as I know it, and they are keeping 
the commandments. They keep the Word of Wisdom, are paying 
their tithing, their Fast offerings, and they are being blessed for it. 

I was delighted to hear this morning in the report — I don't know 
whether you noticed it or not, but I did — that the Swiss Mission 
is leading in Fast offerings, per capita ; that is, outside of the smaller 
Missions. 

They know, too, as I know, that Jesus is the Christ, that He is 
our head, that this is the Church of Jesus Christ. They know, too, 
as I know, that Joseph Smith was and is a prophet, and that his suc- 
cessors are prophets of the Lord, including our beloved President 
Heber J. Grant. Oh, how we do love and appreciate President Grant. 
It is remarkable ; it is a miracle what he has accomplished in estab- 
lishing just this one point I will mention — better public relations be- 
tween the Church and the rest of the world. 

We have had occasion to visi* our Consuls and Consul Generals, 
representing the United States, qviite often we made it a point to call 



ELDER WALLACE F. TORONTO 



51 



on them and get acquainted as soon as we entered a city. I remem- 
ber calling on the Consul General in Zurich : I gave him my card, 
the Temple card. He looked at it and said : "It is a beautiful card.'" 
I said : "You may keep it, if you wish to." He said : "Thank you, 
but I have something I prize a great deal more than this Temple 
card." He reached in his desk and brought out a book presented 
to him by President Grant, autographed by President Grant. That 
was one of his prizes, and he took a great deal of pride in showing it 
to me. 

God bless President Grant. The people there love him. We 
all love him. He is our leader, chosen of the Lord. God bless these 
brethren on the stand. President Clark also is known by many of 
these representatives of our Government. They have been in very 
deed friends to us during our rather exciting and worrying expe- 
riences because of war conditions. They have arranged for us to 
telephone, when it was impossible for private people to telephone. 
We appreciate them. I wish to express our appreciation here pub- 
licly for what they have done. 

Brethren and sisters, I am grateful, more grateful than I can ex- 
press, for the testimony I have that this is the Church of God. May 
He help us always to do His will, and thereby retain this testimony 
that we have, I humbly pray in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, 
Amen. 

ELDER WALLACE F. TORONTO 

Former President of the C zecho-Slovakian Mission 

Brethren and sisters : You cannot know the thrill which goes 
through my being today in beholding again, for the first time in five 
years, this glorious sight, a Conference of the members of the Church. 
I pray for the inspiration of the Lord in that which I might say 
today, for I feel that my responsibility is great, and I am keenly 
aware that those things should be emphasized which will be of profit 
and benefit to this congregation. 

I bring you the greetings, brethren and sisters, of a small band of 
people, Czecho-Slovaks, who know that the Gospel of Jesus Christ 
is indeed the most priceless possession which they have ever had. 
They are living in a war-torn country which has been ravaged, 
robbed and plundered. They are existing under the most adverse of 
conditions, but none-the-less they live the Gospel to such an extent 
as would put many of us to shame. Perhaps we need adversity, in 
order to fully appreciate the commandments and the blessings com- 
ing from the Gospel which we have. 

I want to say a word, too, about the splendid missionaries which 
you have sent us during the past three and a half years. We have 
had the finest men upon the face of the earth, to carry these glad 
tidings to thousands upon thousands of people residing in that nation. 
The work has not been easy. Programs have been projected and 



52 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Friday, April 5 First Day 

plans have been brought into being, only to meet with disappoint- 
ment because of incidents and situations beyond the power of men 
to control. 

These Elders have evacuated twice. They have come back more 
determined than ever to see that the Gospel should not perish in 
Czecho-Slovakia. They have done a mighty work. I bear testimony 
to you today, brothers and sisters, that these young men whom you 
have sent out into the field abroad, have been willing to go the limit 
in bringing- the Gospel of peace, joy and happiness to a war-torn 
Europe. My heart goes out in praise and gratitude to my Heavenly 
Father for the opportunities which these young men have had, as 
well as for the opportunities which they, through their work, have 
been able to afford those much less fortunate than you and I. 

Members of the Church in Central Europe have learned to know 
the deep meaning of the Gospel. They have learned to know 
that its core and essence is to be found in the admonition of Jesus : 
"Love thy neighbor even as thyself." 

A short time after almost two million German troops had 
marched across the borders of Czecho-Slovakia — during that time of 
tension and terror, which inevitably resulted — a young German of- 
ficer, a fine, straight, clean-looking fellow, walked through the door 
of our meeting hall in Prague. We thought : Certainly, this is the 
end for us. The Secret Police have probably sent some one here 
to close the Mission. Coming up he said : "My name is Brother R. 
(for obvious reasons it is felt unwise to give his name.) I am an 
officer in the German Army. As soon as I had completed my official 
duties here in Prague, the first thing I set out to do was to find this 
Branch of the Church in Czecho-Slovakia." With your permission, 
I would like to say just a word to this congregation. I replied: 
"Certainly, Brother R., we shall be happy to hear from you." 

He stood up, and in a language which most of the pepple of 
Czecho-Slovakia detested, German, he had this to say to the members 
of the Church and to the friends who were present : 

Brothers and sisters, I come here not on an appointment of my 
own choosing. I come here as a servant of my government. I know 
we have brought you considerable distress and dismay. We have 
caused already much suffering. Nevertheless, you and I have some- 
thing in common, something which oversteps the boundaries of race, 
language, and color. You and I have the Gospel of Jesus Christ. 
Despite the fact that I speak German and you Czech, yet because of 
the Gospel we still speak in common terms. The time is coming when 
we shall know this better than ever before. 

I wish I had time to tell you all he said. Tears streamed down 
the faces of those Czecho-Slovakian people. As he walked down 
the aisle they stood up and put their arms around him and wept upon 
his shoulder. Every available Sunday — he believed in keeping the 
Sabbath — he was at the Branch hall, doing his best to make the Gos- 
pel of Jesus Christ a living thing among a subjugated people. 

That is what the Gospel of Jesus Christ does for a man. When 



ELDER WALLACE F. TORONTO 



53 



it touches him it changes him, and he knows, as President Hugh 
B. Brown has already said, that all mankind come of common blood, 
and that we are brothers and sisters in the Gospel of Jesus Christ, 
all having but one Father. These are momentous things, brothers 
and sisters. They are truths which cannot be equalled any place 
in the world, outside the plan of the Gospel. 

We regretted having to leave our members in Czecho-Slovakia. 
Had we been able to leave them in the hands of a successor, we 
should have felt good about coming home, but conditions would not 
permit that. Nevertheless it is my testimony to you that some 
thirty thousand members of the. Church who have been left in Eu- 
rope, who are now carrying on for themselves — despite the fact that 
they must suffer, and perhaps have want of the necessities of life — 
are being protected by the hand of the Lord. 

If I may have just a moment or two I should like to relate a 
story, one of several within our experience, which to me is an evi- 
dence of the truthfulness of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, and of the 
protecting power and goodness of God. 

A young Ukrainian, Tarnawskyj by name, who had been study- 
ing for the ministry in the Greek Catholic Church, was on his way 
from Warsaw, Poland, to New York City, there to attend a graduate 
school for the ministry of that church. He came by the way of the 
city of Prague. As he was going down the street he saw the sign, 
"Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 1 " He noticed that we 
were holding a meeting at that time. He thought to himself : "I 
have learned of those people in my studies. I am curious. I think 
I will go in and see what they have to say." 

He entered, dressed in his black robe and white collar, and sat 
in the back. He was a young man about twenty-eight or thirty 
years of age. Two of our missionaries stood up and explained some 
of the principles of the Gospel. They bore their testimonies. Since 
he spoke Ukrainian, which is kindred to Czech, he understood them. 
After the meeting he came up and asked : "When do you hold the 
rest of your services?" We enumerated the meetings of the week 
and he came to all of them, even including the Relief Society. In 
a few weeks he made this request : "Brother Toronto, I would like 
to be baptized into this Church." 

"Now, Brother Tarnawskyj, you know you can't make your 
living in this Church. Our missionaries sustain themselves, either 
from their own sayings or through the sustenance which their folks 
send them." 

"Oh, Brother Toronto," he replied, "I know all about that. Your 
missionaries have been teaching me the Gospel.'" Continuing, he 
said : "I have found the most priceless thing in all the world. I want 
the Gospel of Jesus Christ. I have been seeking it for years in the 
universities and the divinity schools of many lands, and I have never 
found anything that can equal this." 

I said : "All right. As soon as we instruct you a little more fully 



54 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Friday, April 5 First Day 

in the .Gospel we shall be happy to have you as a member of the 
Church." He was subsequently baptized. Upon accepting baptism 
a great characteristic of truth took hold of him, that of wanting to tell 
somebody else about it. Of course, those he thought of first were 
his loved ones back in Poland. He wrote them a long letter, in which 
he declared : "I have found the greatest thing in life. I want to tell 
you something of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, that you, too, might 
enjoy the blessings which flow from it." 

I met him a few days later. He wore a long face and was very 
dejected. "What on earth has happened to you, Brother Tarnawsyj ?" 
"I just received a letter from my folks in Poland. They tell me here : 
'Dear Son and Brother: If you do not immediately renounce this 
thing you call Mormonism we shall cease to send you one penny 
of support, which you know is your only means of livelihood; and 
furthermore, we shall disown you as a son and a brother !' " 

"What is your answer, Brother Tarnawskyj ? You are at the 
cross-roads. You have a grave decision to make." 

"Oh, Brother Toronto, you know what my answer is : 'Dear 
loved ones, I cannot renounce the thing I hold dearest in life, the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ. I pray God that you, too, at some future 
time, through my efforts or the efforts of others, might also come into 
this Church.' " 

From that day until this, so far as I know, he has not received 
one penny or one word from his people. He found himself in Czecho- 
slovakia, a foreigner, unable to secure employment. 

During these troublesome times the subtle political forces in 
Central Europe had operated to break down the Czecho-Slovakian 
Republic, so that Slovakia gained its freedom, as well as the little 
province of Ruthenia or Sub-Carpathian Russia, far to the east, 
hardly larger than the County of Salt Lake. Brother Tarnawskyj 
finally proposed : "Brother Toronto, many of my countrymen are 
out there in Ruthenia, a large group of Ukrainians among whom I 
could work. Since I am an educated man, I think I could get a posi- 
tion as an Inspector in the Ministry of Education. Can you help 
me get there? I want to become a self-sustaining citizen." "All 
right. We will help you get to Ruthenia, if you think you can suc- 
ceed." 

Upon his arrival in this new autonomous state, he filed his appli- 
cation for a position in the ministry. It went through the various 
hands and much red tape through which such things have to pass, 
and finally reached the Minister himself. Up to this point all went 
well. When it reached the Minister there was great delay. Finally 
our brother wrote me a letter and said : "Brother Toronto, I don't 
know what the trouble down here is. I am qualified for the position, 
and I have pulled every string I know. And I have prayed. The 
Lord God knows I am hungry. He knows I need a place to rest 
my head. I have tried to live the Gospel since I joined the Church. 
From the earnings on little jobs I have secured here and there I 



ELDER WALLACE F. TORONTO 



55 



have set aside my tithing, and as soo-.i as the mails go through I will 
send it on to you. Why, oh why does the Lord persecute me like 
this?'"' But in conclusion he added: (I wish I had the letter here to 
read to you :) "Perhaps it is all for the best." 

A card came a few days later : "I am going to take a job out in 
the little town of Perecyn as a humble school teacher, where I can 
make enough to at least buy me a few crusts of bread.'" 

He was employed there for three days, when that tiny state of 
Central Europe, Sub-Carpathian Russia, was drenched in blood by 
the Hungarian hordes which swept over it. Men, women and chil- 
dren by the hundreds were left dying in the streets. He and nine 
of his Ukrainian companions were routed out of bed at five o'clock 
one morning and thrown into prison. After twenty-four hours of 
intense suffering they were called before a military court consisting 
of one man in the uniform of a Hungarian officer. He had the sole 
right to say, "You live," or "You die." The ten men came before 
him. They were asked two questions : "How long have you been 
in this country?" and "What is your religious affiliation?" 

Our brother led the others. To the first question he replied that 
he had been there so and so many weeks. "What is your religious 
affiliation?" 

"I am a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints. Sometimes they call us 'Mormons.' " 

"Mormons ? Mormons ? I have heard of you folks. I have read 
of you in the newspapers of Budapest. I hear your people have done 
some good in this world." A tense moment of hesitation and then, 
"You go free." 

His nine companions came up after him. They were asked the 
identical questions. Being no more guilty than he himself, they were 
nevertheless condemned to death, and shot down in cold blood before 
the sun went down that day. 

This brother finally got out of the country, and wrote me another 
letter. "Brother Toronto," he said, "I know the Lord does move 
in a mysterious way His wonders to perform. The Gospel is the 
most priceless thing I have in the world. I know the Lord has pre- 
served my life, that I may be a beacon light to my fellow men. He 
has not only preserved my life, in the way I have described to you, 
but He has also protected me, for had I received the position of In- 
spector in the Ministry of Education I today would have been sit- 
ting in the concentration camps of Hungary, subjected to some of 
the most terrible torture known to humankind. I owe all I have to 
the Gospel of Jesus Christ." 

Our faithful members will be protected, brothers and sisters. 
Were this the only incident I might be skeptical in thinking that it 
was perhaps a chance occurrence. But we have seen many cases 
of providential care and protection. Some of the Jewish members of 
our Church, despite the anti-Semitic programs, have been preserved,

and we have seen it. The Gospel of Jesus Christ means everything 
to them." Does it mean everything to you? 

Go home tonight. Get down on your knees. Thank the Lord 
your God that you live in a "land choice above all others," in this 
land of freedom and happiness. And thank the Lord again that you 
have been privileged to accept the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Cove- 
nant anew that you will keep the commandments of the Lord as 
never before. 

I know that God lives and it has been a testimony to me to live 
among these people who placed their trust in Him. I know that 
Joseph Smith is a prophet of the Lord, even as they know it. I 
give you this testimony in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

PRESIDENT J. REUBEN CLARK, JR. 

First Counselor in the First Presidency 

I should like to thank the Brigham Young University Chorus for 
the wonderful music they have given us today. I think it may be 
truthfully said that there is no college in the United States, of any 
size, that has better music than the Brigham Young University. 



The Brigham Young University Chorus sang, as the closing 
number, "Oft in Danger, Oft in Woe, Onward Christian, Onward 
Go," (Harry R. Shelly). 

Elder Horace Raymond Pond, President of the Benson Stake, 
offered the benediction. 

Conference adjourned until 10 o'clock Saturday morning, 
April 6th. 

SECOND DAY 
MORNING MEETING 

The third session of the Conference was held Saturday morn- 
ing, April 6, at 10 o'clock, with President J. Reuben Clark, Jr. 
presiding. 

The music for this meeting was furnished by the Ricks College 
Choir, under the direction of John M. Anderson, Alexander Schrein- 
er was at the organ. 

President Clark announced that the congregation and the Ricks 
College Choir would sing, as the opening selection, "Glory to God 
on High." 

After the singing of this hymn, Elder Charles S. Hansen, President 
of the Gunnison Stake, offered the opening prayer. 

The Ricks College Choir sang an anthem, "God So Loved The 
World," (Stainer).

PRESIDENT RUDGER CLAWSON 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

My brethren and sisters, I am wonderfully impressed by the at- 
tendance at the Conference this morning. The house is filled. Every 
seat, so far as I can see, is taken. We had a splendid day yesterday. 
There was only one regret, and that was that President Grant could 
not be with us. He has wisely decided to rest a few weeks in Cali- 
fornia since coming out of the hospital. We are all very happy in- 
deed, I am sure, that we have President McKay with us and 
President Clark to direct the proceedings of this great Conference. 

The meeting of the Church Welfare plan held this morning in 
the Assembly Hall was indeed most thrilling. The spirit of that 
work is taking hold of the Latter-day Saints. That it will be suc- 
cessful I think no one could be in doubt. 

And now the Conference is in progress again. I want to com- 
mend these wonderful singers, the choir from Idaho, and the work 
that they are doing. 

AN INSPIRING HYMN 

I feel prompted this morning, brethren and sisters, to read a 
few lines of one of our sacred hymns taken from the Deseret Sunday 
School Union Song Book. The title of this song is "Count Your 
Blessings." This is a very opportune time to count our blessings, 
but of course we cannot mention all of them in a short sermon; 
that would be impossible, but we might read the hymn and point to 
several important blessings : 

When upon life's billows you are tempest tossed, 
When you are discouraged thinking all is lost, 
Count your many blessings, name them one by one, 
And it will surprise you what the Lord hath done. 

Are you ever burdened with a load of care? 
Does the cross seem heavy you are called to bear? 
Count your many blessings ev'ry doubt will fly, 
And you will be singing as the days go by. 

When you look at others with their lands and gold, 
Think that Christ has promised you His wealth untold, 
Count your many blessings, money cannot buy, 
Your reward in heaven, nor your home on high. 

So, amid the conflict, whether great or small, 
Do not be discouraged, God is over all; 
Count your many blessings, angels will attend, 
Help and comfort give you to your journey's end. 

A wonderfully appropriate song. It is uplifting in spirit ; it is 
well that we should take time now and then to ponder seriously 
upon our blessings. 

WORKS OF THE ANCIENT PROPHETS 

Truly, in the time of the Prophets of old it was a day of inspira- 



58 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Saturday. April '6 Second Day 

tion, revelation and miracles. In the days of Abraham, Isaac and 
Jacob, and of Moses, Isaiah, Ezekiel, Elijah and Elisha, the prophets, 
surely that was a day of miracles. Wonderful works were performed 
in those early ages. If I mistake not, Amos, the Prophet, spoke of 
this matter and said that the Lord doeth nothing save He first reveal 
it to His servants the prophets. Marvelous things happened in those 
ancient times. The prophets wrote and spoke as they were moved 
upon by the Holy Ghost. And he who speaks by the power of the 
Holy Ghost is a revelator. 

As in ancient times so it was in the Meridian of Time when the 
Son of God was upon the earth. It was a day of inspiration, revela- 
tion and miracles, a day when there were Apostles and Prophets 
upon the earth, High Priests, Seventies and Elders and the lesser 
Priesthood. Great things were accomplished and the work of God 
prospered. 

BLESSINGS OF THE LATTER DAYS 

And so now in our day it is much the same. After eighteen hun- 
dred years the silence was broken and the voice of inspiration, revela- 
tion and miracles was heard upon the earth and the Spirit of the 
Lord rests down upon the people. The initial step taken in the 
organization of the great work of the latter days was the visitation 
of God the Father and Jesus Christ, His Son, to* the boy Joseph 
Smith, which was the most memorable event, most remarkable in 
some respects, of anything that has ever transpired upon this earth. 
The Father and the Son condescended to manifest themselves in 
person to Joseph Smith. One said, pointing to the other, "This is 
my Beloved Son, hear Him." The Son spoke in answer to the boy's 
prayer to know which of all the churches he should join. He was 
told to join none of them for they were lacking in divine authority. 
Prophets appeared and angels from heaven were sent down after 
that first great vision. They gave to man divine authority. 

One of these visitors from the other world was John the Baptist 
who had lived upon the earth in the time of the Savior. He was now 
a mighty angel, a messenger from on high, and he came for an 
express purpose. It was not to satisfy the curiosity of Joseph Smith, 
the young man, for he had now grown to be a young man, but he 
came on an important mission under the direction of Peter, James, 
and John, and conferred upon Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery 
the Aaronic Priesthood, or the lesser Priesthood, as it is sometimes 
called — the Priesthood of Priests, Teachers, and Deacons. 

And then, later on, Peter, James, and John came down from 
heaven. They appeared as mighty angels, no doubt, but they had 
their mission and that was to confer further authority upon these, 
the servants of the Lord, and Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery were 
ordained Apostles of the Lord Jesus Christ. Thus was divine 
authority restored to the earth in these latter days, and those who 
were exercising authority that was not from heaven were under 



PRESIDENT RUDGER CLAW SON 



59 



condemnation of the Lord, and especially when they knew that they 
were without divine authority. 

And so, brethren and sisters, I testify that this matter of divine 
authority is of tremendous importance, and that the success of this 
work so far has been accomplished under divine authority and 
could not have been realized in any other way. It is one of the 
foundation principles of the Gospel. 

THE WORK IN THE TEMPLES 

And that was not all. Let me call your attention to another su- 
perior blessing, a blessing that is always to be found among the 
people of God, the true worshippers of the meek and lowly Nazarene, 
and that is the blessing of the Temple of the Lord. Wherever the 
people of God are found, there you will find also a Temple, or House 
of the Lord, where He can come and dispense blessings to His 
people, blessings that cannot be measured in value by money, but 
are the free gift of God. The blessings of the Temple are so great 
that we can hardly comprehend their importance and value. People 
are free to donate when they go to the Temple for these blessings — 
the blessings of the endowment, the sealing blessings at the altar. 
Husband and wife may be sealed together for time and all eternity. 
I am sure that none of us can comprehend the extent and power and 
importance of these blessings that are dispensed from the Temple. 
The rich are entitled to them, if they are worthy ; the poor can have 
them also if they are worthy. Certainly we should count our bless- 
ings. We should remember that every blessing we receive is from 
the Lord. 

MISSIONARY SERVICE 

Let me mention briefly the missionary work. I want to say to 
you, brethren and sisters, that there is nothing like it in all the 
world. The missionaries of the Christian churches, so-called, are 
sent to preach the gospel to the heathens. Our special duty at the 
present time is not to carry the Gospel to the heathens but to preach 
the Gospel and offer its blessings to those who are considered civil- 
ized far above the heathens. It is a wonderful movement wherein 
the young men of Zion may be called into service and is a part of 
the blessings of the Latter-day Saints. They are set apart under 
divine authority to preach this Gospel, to baptize and give the Holy 
Ghost. Young women are also sent out as missionaries to preach 
the Gospel. 

And so, I think I may safely say that this is a day of inspiration, 
of revelation and miracles. If all the miracles that have been and 
are being performed by this people were written into a book it would 
be a very, very large volume. Many who were sick have been healed, 
and many have been delivered from accidents and trouble and anx- 
iety through our missionary cause. 



60 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Saturday. April 6 Second Day 

That is about as far as I am entitled to go this morning in men- 
tioning these important matters — the blessings of revelation, of in- 
spiration, of divine authority, Temple work and Missionary work. 
There is just about enough there to take our whole attention 
throughout life, and yet there are many other desirable and im- 
portant blessings in the hands of the Lord which He will give to His 
faithful people. The Lord is willing to pour out these blessings 
upon the people just as fast as the people make themselves worthy 
to receive them. 

THE SEALED PORTION OF THE BOOK OF MORMON 

I am wondering if you will permit me to say this closing word. 
I am wondering about the sealed portion of the record appertaining 
to the Book of Mormon. When will it come to the people of the 
Church ? I am of the opinion that if we were perfectly prepared and 
followed carefully the revelations and instructions we have already 
received in the Church possibly that sealed portion could be brought 
to the people through faith and good works. 

My brethren and sisters, I pray God in heaven to bless you 
and help you and help us all to serve Him in righteousness. I hum- 
bly ask this in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER ANTOINE R. IVINS 

Of the First Council of the Seventy 

It is a very great inspiration, my brethren and sisters, to stand 
in this position and look into the faces of so many wonderful people, 
but it gives one a great sense of responsibility to stand in an im- 
portant position of leadership at the head of this wonderful group 
of people. It is indeed a responsible position. 

A DESIRE TO BE HELPFUL 

I pray constantly as I look around upon you and as I minister 
with the Seventies of the Church and the Church at large, that God 
will inspire every word that I utter and everything that I do. My 
one desire is that in all these things I might please Him and help 
you. And if He will inspire me, with your aid, on this occasion 
to say just one little thing that may be helpful to you I shall be 
infinitely happy. One wonders what that may be, and it is very 
difficult at times to make a choice among the many things that might 
be said. 

I am happy for the membership I have in the Church and for the 
fact that God has made it possible for me to help in this great work. 
When I was a young man I wondered how I would respond if I were 
asked to fill a mission, if I were asked to do this, or that, or the other 
responsible thing in the Church, and I still wonder whether I am 



ELDER ANTOINE R. IV INS 



61 



going to be able to render the type of service that I should to the 
end of my years, and only pray that I may. 

THE WORD OF THE LORD 

In the Doctrine and Covenants we are told in four or five sec- 
tions, "the will of the Lord" as expressed through the Prophet 
Joseph Smith to certain of the men who were interested in this work 
in its inception in our dispensation. Several members wanted to 
know what they might do to their best advantage in this work, and 
the Lord spoke to each of them, "the thing which will be of the 
most worth unto you will be to declare repentance unto this people." 

I would that I knew how to do that in a way that it might ap- 
peal to those who needed it most. The great difficulty is that as we 
stand before you we realize that we are talking to faithful people, 
and the message that we would deliver perhaps never reaches the 
ears that we would like it to strike. That makes it necessary for each 
one of you to constitute yourself a missionary to carry to your 
friends the message of this Conference. 

We have men all around us who could well repent of their 
actions. Repentance is a thing that all of us need. I am no more 
immune than anybody else from the need of repentance, and I have 
that constantly confronting me in my consciousness, but to get that 
message over to the people we must depend upon you because we 
cannot make personal contact with all, and so we speak to the faithful 
members of the Church. 

THE GOSPEL FOR BOTH RICH AND POOR 

The Gospel of Jesus Christ is universal in its scope. There is 
no man or woman that it cannot benefit and bless, if only that man 
and woman will yield obedience to it. Christ gave His Twelve Apos- 
tles a charge to preach the Gospel to every creature, with the promise 
that those who would respond would be saved. We have been doing 
that all these generations ; that is, we have been preaching the Gospel 
to the people. Many of them have never heard it, however. The 
other day, in my hearing, a returned missionary made a remark 
which ran something like this : Since the institution of the Welfare 
work we have had to change our methods. The question was asked, 
in what respect? 

"Well," he said, "we are going to a better type of people now 
than we ever did before in our Missions. We find that the Welfare 
work makes such an appeal to a certain class of people that our ranks 
would be flooded with those who desire to be benefitted by that 
factor rather than any other if we would let them in. That field 
being closed to us we have had to preach to people of a little better 
standing, who are not quite so poor." 

Now Christ, when John the Baptist sent to ask Him if He was 
really the Christ, said : "Take back to John the message that the 



62 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Saturday, April 6 Second Dag 

blind see, the lame walk, the sick are healed, and the Gospel is 
preached to the poor." I wonder if in that day it was only the rich 
and the elite that felt like they were members of the Church of God, 
and that the preaching of the Gospel to the poor was a novelty in the 
time of Christ. It may be that that was what brought forth that 
remark. However, in our age we have become accustomed to the 
fact that the rank and file of our converts are likely to come out of 
the ranks of the poor. 

This missionary was talking to one of the Twelve, who said: "If 
they had followed those tactics in my day I would never have come 
into the Church, for I have known what it means to be hungry." 

We must teach the poor always the Gospel of Jesus Christ, and 
in all the missionary fields in which it has been my experience to 
travel that has been customary. But I often wonder if there is not 
a field among the upper class people to which we might devote our 
attention with profit. I believe that in all the time I have been con- 
nected with the Mexican people there has never been a conscious 
effort to take the Gospel to what might be there called the better 
class of people. When the Gospel was taken to people in Hawaii 
it was so popular among them that the very rulers of that country 
accepted it. There is there little distinction between rich and poor, 
all mingling freely together, but there were kings and queens among 
them. It has been my pleasure to see a man who had been a cham- 
berlain to the king act at the door as a Deacon in the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints and become one of the Elders in the 
Church. 

So I wonder if there is not a field that we might look into 
am^ng that class of people. 

The misuse of riches is the only curse that comes from the 
possession of ample means, and there must be many fine people 
among the rich, many of them are our neighbors, but we pay little 
attention to them. They are all around us. 

OUR RESPONSIBILITY TOWARDS OUR NEIGHBORS 

One day I said to a friend of mine, speaking of a neighbor who 
had lived across the hall from my wife and me for quite a while, 
expressing sympathy for him in the passing of his wife, "That friend 
of ours is a fine man and his wife was a fine woman." 

He said : "Yes, I would like to see somebody make an effort 
to get him into the Church, but you know I am so close to him that 
I dare not try." 

I wonder if that might not be the best opportunity. My wife 
and I lived across the hall from them, and one day the woman became 
rather ill, more ill than usual, she was always afflicted, and to our 
great surprise we learned that she had asked to be prayed for in the 
Temple. That was faith ; though she was not a member of the Church 
and though her husband was not, she had faith that there might be 
virtue in a prayer for her uttered in our Temple. 



ELDER ANTOINE R. IVINS 



63 



There are many people like that, without any doubt, all around 
us, and the Gospel is for them, and if we do not take the message to 
them I wonder whose fault it will be if they do not accept it. It 
is a universal Gospel that we have, and it is a universal responsibility 
that rests upon our shoulders to teach the Truth. We have heard 
during this Conference how it appeals to different nationalities, all 
the way from Czecho-Slovakia through Europe and into our country, 
and if we cared to, Brother Hardy and some of the others and I 
could tell you how it goes on down in Polynesia, clear down to the 
Antipodes. It makes of us all a common people, and if we could so 
introduce it to these nations as to make its adoption general and its 
principles apply in the lives of men, these struggles that we are con- 
fronted with now in actuality would not exist. 

CHRISTIAN PRINCIPLES NOT APPLIED IN THE WORLD 

It was once my privilege to read an interview given by a promi- 
nent Jewish rabbi in Great Britain. He was asked what his reac- 
tion to Christianity was ? He said it had been the greatest difficulty 
that the Jews had had to meet, and that it had been a failure in 
the world, that the principles of Christ had never been adopted and 
applied. 

I wonder if there ever has been an honest effort on the part of 
so-called Christian nations to apply the principles of the Christ. 
Did you ever hear of a peace treaty being offered to a vanquished 
people that had as its main purpose the rehabilitation of the van- 
quished ? I think in all struggles that we have entered into the prin- 
ciples of the Christ have not been dominant, though some of these 
conflicts have been carried forth in the name of Christ. But greed 
and avarice and many such motives were back of them. If the time 
ever comes that the principles of Christianity can be applied to the 
lives of men peace will be brought about upon the earth. 

My wish would be that though we are a small people in the 
world we might eventually exercise such an influence as to spread 
this leaven, the Gospel of Jesus Christ, throughout the whole world 
to such an extent that peace may some day prevail. We have faith 
in that thing. We have faith that perhaps through the instrumen- 
tality of this government of which we are a part we may be able to 
reach those ends, and I pray that we may sense our responsibility 
to the nations, and above all to the Church, that we may realize 
the significance of the charge which Christ has given to us to preach 
the Gospel to every creature so that he and she may be left without 
excuse, and not only be left without excuse, but be given the won- 
derful opportunities of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, I ask in His name, 
Amen. 



64 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Saturday, April 6 Second Day 

ELDER JOSEPH E, EVANS 

Former President of the French Mission 

My brethren and sisters : What is now the French Mission was 
one of the earliest fields for missionary work in the Church. So 
much of commendation could be said of that Mission that it is dif- 
ficult to know what to say in the few minutes allotted. At the end 
of last October when we came away from France, Elder Gaston 
Chappuis, of Salt Lake City, was left in charge of the French Mission. 
He had come to Paris on his second mission about two days before 
war was declared. He is a native of Switzerland, a second-genera- 
tion member. And so is his wife, who was born in Belgium. They 
are well trained and qualified to do their work. Together they are 
publishing the Mission's monthly magazine, translating and mailing 
out lessons to the Branches in Belgium, French Switzerland and 
France, and generally endeavoring to encourage the members in 
their faith and to stimulate activity and keep the Mission organiza- 
tion intact. 

Notwithstanding the inroads of war and these times of trial and 
trouble, our members are holding fast to that better life to which 
they have dedicated themselves. In spite of popular misconceptions 
concerning Mormonism, our members have the moral support of 
multitudes of friends. Although their problems are extremely dif- 
ficult they are never insoluble, because in an effort to harmonize 
their lives with God's teachings, they gain a renewed sense of values 
and are blessed with wisdom and great courage. Their experiences 
in the Church have taught them to think clearly and for themselves. 
Nothing else has ever offered them the same opportunity for intel- 
lectual enrichment and spiritual happiness. Fortunately they are 
living in countries where up to now their churches have not been 
destroyed and where the word of God is not forbidden. That is 
true in Belgium, Switzerland and France. 

A week ago I received a heart-warming letter from the Presi- 
dent of the Belgian District, who is a native of Liege, Belgium. 
Twenty-five years ago — during the first world war — -his father shep- 
herded our Church members and with God's protecting care brought 
them through the severe trials of that conflict. Today this son is 
following in his father's footsteps, while three of his brothers, all 
active members of the Church, are in the Belgian army. He is an 
intelligent, wide-awake leader. On three occasions he has been 
decorated by the King of Belgium. His work is outstanding, as the 
work of so many of our members over there is. In his letter he says 
that meetings are being held in all Branches in Belgium, and that a 
District Conference is being planned for May. Even though income 
has shrunk and living costs have mounted, the members of one of the 
Branches in this District are slowly accumulating a fund to be used 
for the purchase of a site for a meeting house. And so, amid the 
hideous discords of war and at a time when they are tortured in spirit, 



ELDER JOSEPH E. EVANS

these people are giving their time and energies to maintaining the 
work of the Church, which is no mean achievement. Their faith and 
devotion have proved an inspiration to me. The influence of our 
Church throughout the French Mission is impossible to calculate. 
Everywhere it exerts a powerful force for building better men, for 
regenerating mankind. Its strict adherence to the high standards 
set by the Savior makes its stupendous progress no accident. 

For more than a century the Church has made an earnest effort 
to spread the Gospel in Europe, but never, I believe, with more de- 
termined zeal than within the past few years. At least that is so in 
Belgium, France and Switzerland, although the apparent results 
achieved may not compare too favorably with those of other Euro- 
pean Missions. I am reminded of the nine tons of ore necessary to 
produce one gram of radium. But when produced that one gram 
of radium is worth $25,000! The analogy is not perfect, but it does 
appear to me that it takes a great deal of work and effort to "ex- 
tract, 1 " as it were, one precious soul from the world. The results are 
perhaps at this moment obscured by the impact of war. What has 
gone on over there during the past two years is without parallel in 
history, and it is occasion for marvel that we have accomplished as 
much as we have under such great handicaps. 

Our missionaries have given good account of the stewardship 
intrusted to them, despite expressions of intense disappointment and 
a feeling that their efforts culminated in frustration because of the 
war. I am sure that before God their work has not come amiss. To 
their everlasting credit it should be said that during the never-to-be- 
forgotten complex happenings of last September and October they 
were strong and of good courage. President Toronto of the Czech 
Mission spoke of his missionaries as being the best young men to 
walk the earth. I ate and slept with mine, walked and talked with 
them, shared their successes and disappointments, and at the risk of 
making a comparison I should like to say they were even better than 
President Toronto's missionaries. 

In Belgium, France and Switzerland, comparative freedom has 
been vouchsafed to our missionaries to promulgate the principles 
of the Gospel. Effort has been made to correlate their work with 
conditions as we found them, with emphasis on the importance of 
learning to speak the French language correctly and fluently. I 
feel certain that such preparation presages greater success. Every- 
where we have found a friendly spirit of inquiry. Never have we 
felt that our obligation to the honest investigator was discharged 
simply by leaving Mormon literature with him. We have sought to 
persuade him to employ critical reasoning and serious thought to 
the Gospel, for in it we are confident he will find the only true 
answer to his problems and aspirations, as well as those inner 
satisfactions that are deeper and more enduring than anything else 
in life, and equally as well also, opportunities for furthering well- 
being and happiness. , r 




GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Second Day 



Missionaries to Europe obtain an international interest and 
point of view, particularly in the cultural affairs of life. They acquire 
a broad range of facts on which to formulate and base sound judg- 
ments. Mormon missionaries generally, in my opinion, influence 
the spiritual life of the world, because their efforts are instrumental 
in opening up to the communities in which they proselyte, new and 
fresh opportunities for serving God, for crystallizing hopes into ac- 
tion, for working out salvation. 

Sister Evans and I have strong testimonies of the truth of the 
Gospel, testimonies which come from God. We shall never forget 
the golden memories of the French Mission, which become, as time 
passes, more and more pleasant, uplifting and inspirational. With 
all our hearts we want to respond to every call that may be made 
of us and if and when conditions warrant to return to complete our 
missions. 

May the Lord bless and prosper this work throughout the world 
is my prayer, and I ask it humbly in the name of His Son Jesus 
Christ, Amen. 

An athem, "O Savior of the World, 1 " (Goss), was sung by the 
Ricks College Choir. 



I want to talk to you today about the abundant life. The expression 
belongs to the sayings of Jesus. I quote him. 



I am the door : by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall 
go in and out, and find pasture. 

The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I 
am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abun- 
dantly. (John 10:9-10.) 



That fine phrase, coined and employed by the Master, has in recent 
times been so violently wrenched from the noble setting in which He 
put it and has been made to assume a signfkance so widely variant from 
the one He gave it that, having regard to its original sense, one now 
shrinks from using it at all. 

Without, I believe, the customary acknowledgement of its origin, 
it has been dragged down from its high spiritual plane to the ordinary 
level of every day materialism. More often than not now-a-days "the 
abundant life" is made the synonym for a full stomach, or a modernized 
home, or coveted apparel, or a new model automobile. And these mere 
things are held up to view as if they constituted the goal of ultimate de- 
sire, which, is symtomatic of present day measures of value.

THE SAVIOR'S WORDS 



THE MEANING CHANGED 



ELDER ABERT E. BOW EN

A HIGHER INTERPRETATION 

But it is abundantly clear that that is not at all what was in the mind 
of Jesus when He used the expression. It follows immediately upon 
His declaration that it was by Him that man shall be saved. Salvation 
meant to Him something far different than the mere physical comfort 
or even preservation of the mortal body, or the gratification of the physi- 
cal senses, or the invention of new excitements to relieve us of our arti- 
ficially created boredoms. 

He was always concerned with eternal spiritual values, never with 
mere things, as His utterances so fully show. When He talked about life 
He always embraced within His meaning something far transcending the 
satisfying powers of mere things. 

PARABLE OF THE RICH MAN 

Let us take an example : 

i 

And He said unto them, Take heed, and beware of covetousness : for 
a man's life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he pos- 
sesseth. 

And He spake a parable unto them, saying, The ground of a certain 
rich man brought forth plentifully: 

And he thought within himself, saying, What shall I do, because I 
have no room where to bestow my fruits? 

And he said, This will I do: I will put down my barns, and build 
greater ; and there will I bestow all my fruits and my goods. 

And I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast much goods laid up for many 
years ; take thine ease, eat, drink, and be merry. 

But God said unto him, Thou fool, this night thy soul shall be re- 
quired of thee; then whose shall those things be, which thou hast pro- 
vided ? 

So is he that layeth up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward 

God. 

And He said unto His disciples, Therefore, I say unto you, Take no 
thought for your life, what ye shall eat; neither for the body, what ye 
shall put on. 

The life is more than meat, and the body is more than raiment. 
(Luke 12:15-23.) 

There you have it crystal clear. "A man's life consisteth not in the 
abundance of the things which he possesseth." And "The life is more than 
meat and the body is more than raiment." 

CARE OF THE BODY ESSENTIAL 

Now I would not have you suppose that I am trying to say to you 
that your physical needs may be ignored or even neglected. The body 
is the physical instrumentality through which we work in this physical 
world. It requires physical food and material shelter to perpetuate it in 
being. Its perpetuation is essential to the accomplishment of the purposes 
of this earth life. 

Within limits the meeting of the requirements of the physical body 
is essential to the successful spiritual and mental progress of mortal man. 
This we have always recognized. But when we with the single purpose of 



68 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Saturday. April 6 Second Day 

amassing to ourselves a multiplication of things with which to augment 
our individual power, selfishly try to gather to ourselves alone, to 
the exclusion of our fellow men, then we are losing our sense of propor- 
tion and are exalting the incidentals of life over the essence of life itself. 

Perhaps between the material and the spiritual, properly coordinated, 
there is no sharp line of separation, but the material must always be ser- 
vant of the spiritual, its proper sovereign. 

PRESIDENT YOUNG'S PRACTICAL TEACHING 

President Brigham Young gave us some sound teaching in this re- 
spect. Said he : 

Our preaching to you from Sabbath to Sabbath, sending the Gospel 
to the nations, gathering the people, opening farms, making needed 'im- 
provements, and building cities, all pertain to salvation. The Gospel is 
designed to gather a people that will be of one heart and of one mind. 
Let every individual in this city feel the same interest for the public good 
as he does for his own, and you will at once see this community still more 
prosperous, and still more rapidly increasing in wealth, influence, and 
power. But where each one seeks to benefit himself or herself alone, and 
does not cherish a feeling for the prosperity and benefit of the whole, that 
people will be disorderly, unhappy, and poverty-stricken, and distress, 
animosity and strife will reign. 

Efforts to accumulate property in the correct channel are far from 
being an injury to any community, on the contrary they are highly bene- 
ficial, provided individuals, with all that they have, always hold themselves 
in readiness to advance the interests of the Kingdom of God on the earth. 
Let every man and woman be industrious, prudent, and economical in 
their acts and feelings, and while gathering to themselves, let each one 
strive to identify his or her interests with the interests of this commun- 
ity with those of their neighbor and neighborhood, let them seek their 
happiness and welfare in that of all, and we will be blessed and pros- 
pered. (Journal of Discourses, Vol. 3, page 330.) 

ULTIMATE PURPOSE OF LIFE 

Mortality is not the ultimate destiny of man. The things essential 
to mortal life are in life and of life, but they are not life itself ; they are 
mere incidentals. Life itself has some other purpose than feeding and 
clothing and sheltering the body. It is the realization of that purpose 
that Jesus was concerned about. Therein is to be found the abundant 
life. 

To the inquiring rich young man He said, "If thou wilt enter into 
life, keep the commandments." (Matt. 19:17) 

This seems to say that moving, animated, sentient human beings, 
howsoever well fed or clothed or sheltered, or entertained or amused 
have not even seen life, or tasted of it, or entered into it, unless they have 
brought themselves into a rational understanding of its ultimate purpose. 
Enlarging upon His terse answer to the young man Jesus said: 

Thou shalt do no murder. Thou shalt not commit adultery. Thou 
shalt not steal. Thou shalt not bear false witness. 

Honor thy father and thy mother: and thou shalt love thy neigh- 
bor as thyself. 



ELDER ALBERT E. BOW EN 



69 



You will notice that here again the woof of the life that He has in 
mind consists in those soul qualities which when woven into the warp 
of a man lift him high above the level of gross materialism into the rare- 
fied atmosphere of the spirit. 

Jesus was concerned about preparing men to live the spiritual law 
and to fit them for life in His kingdom where that law shall reign. There 
is the abode of those who attain the fulness of the abundant life. To 
that end the burden of His teaching was that men should keep the com- 
mandments. He spent much of His time training disciples to carry on 
the teaching after He himself should be gone. He told them to go out 
and teach all men everywhere. That was the commission. The promise 
was that they who believed should be saved. There is no promise to any 
other. 

ACCEPTANCE OF GOSPEL TEACHINGS NECESSARY 

It is true that certain things were to be done by those who believed. 
But He knew that belief must precede the doing of them. He knew, too, 
that they would surely follow from sincere belief, hence the preeminent 
importance of belief. It is the crying need of the world today. If men 
would but believe and translate their belief into living practices, how 
different a place to live in this earth would be. 

The commandments emanated from Jesus himself. Before it could 
be expected that men would accept them, they must accept Him. Thus 
He became the central figure about which all the teachings revolved. 

To the multitude who crowded about Him the day after He had fed 
them He said : 

Ye seek me, not because ye saw the miracles, but because ye did eat 
of the loaves and were filled. 

Labor not for the meat which perisheth, but for that meat which 
endureth to everlasting life, which the Son of Man shall give unto you. 

They reminded Him that their fathers in the desert were fed by 
manna from heaven and demanded of Him that He shew them His works 
that they might believe. He in turn reminded them that their fathers who 
had eaten manna in the wilderness, w.re all dead. Then He said : 

Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me hath ever- 
lasting life. 

I am that bread of life. 

***** 

This is the bread which cometh down from heaven, that a man may 
eat thereof and not die. 

***** 

From that time — says the record pathetically — many of His disciples 
went back, and walked no more with Him. 

If you will search the record you will find that at no time did He 
make any promise of ease, or comfort, or freedom from distress or from 
sorrow or suffering, or of exemption from privation or want or sacrifice. 
None of these was an element in the abundant life. All of them He 
endured Himself. 



70 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Saturday. April 6 Second Day 



THE TEMPTER OVERCOME 

Preparatory to entering upon His ministry He went into the desert 
alone. When He was weakened from long vigils and fasting the tempter 
bade Him, in proof of His Sonship, to command that the stones be turned 
into bread, that His hunger might be appeased. Resisting this He was 
shown from the top of a high mountain all the kingdoms of the world 
which, with all the glory of them, were offered Him if He would but 
bow in worship to the Tempter. Rising to heights befitting the majesty 
of the Son of God He issued the stern command, "Get thee hence 
Satan : for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and Him 
only shalt thou serve." At the same time He promulgated that other 
profound truth. "Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word 
that proceedeth out of the mouth of God." He could have fed His hun- 
ger, and accepted the dominion of the kingdoms of the world, and their 
glory, and escaped Golgotha. His refusal led straight to that dolorous 
hill and the apparent end of it all. But Golgotha, not bread or dominion 
or glory, was the way of the abundant life. It brought Him swiftly 
to the dawn of that triumphant morning at the end of the Sabbath on 
the first day of the week when Mary Magdalene and the other Mary 
came to the sepulchre and were greeted by the angel who, seated on the 
stone at the door said : 

Fear not ye; for I know that ye seek Jesus which was crucified. 

He is not here; for He is risen, as He said. Come see the place 
where the Lord lay. 

And go quickly and tell His disciples that He is risen from the dead ; 
and behold, He goeth before you into Galilee ; there ye shall see Him. 

Thus came the great crowning achievement of His life. 

You will have observed that I am making no argument for the 
authenticity of the words of Jesus nor of the records which preserve 
them. I accept them, which is what all believing Christians must do. 
Very persuasive arguments could be and have been made, but neither 
the limits of time nor the nature of the occasion admit of them here. 
We accept Jesus as the Son of God, the Author of our being and our 
ultimate Savior. 

ETERNAL LIFE THE GREATEST PRIZE 

To that faith we cling because it concerns life itself which is man's 
most cherished possession — the thing which he prizes above all else. 
Howsoever many things a man may have gathered about him, he nor- 
mally would give all of them when life is threatened if by the exchange 
he could procure an extension of it. Life he soon comes to sense is 
all there is of him. Without that he is but a lump of clay, and all these 
other things without meaning and useless. In very truth the projection 
of it beyond the grave, the assuring it there of endless duration — eternal 
life — is the greatest gift of God to man. 

The alternative is oblivion. The sinking with death into nothing- 
ness — the end. Extinction. The irremediable severance of all the fond 



PRESIDENT J. REUBEN CLARK, JR. 



71 



associations of a life time. The abrupt cutting off and non-revivable 
termination, so far as concerns the individual, of all the fine intelligence 
and acquisitions of knowledge born of a lifetime of industry, toil and 
struggle and yearning and soul-striving. The smothering in the black 
darkness of unending night of all the hopes and aspirations which have 
guided man in his struggle upward to higher planes. The withering up 
by the blight of death of the qualities of kindliness, gentleness, forbear- 
ance, mercy, tenderness and love which have grown and flowered in him 
through his practice of those virtues in association with his fellows. 

No one, I suspect, likes to contemplate for himself so uninviting 
and uninspiring and wasteful an exit from life. Rather do we turn to 
the bright hope held out to us in the promise of Jesus : 

There is no man that hath left house, or parents, or brethren, or wife, 
or children for the Kingdom of God's sake, who shall not receive mani- 
fold more in this present time, and in the world to come life everlasting. 

In the way to that goal lies the abundant life. I pray God we may 
all attain it, in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

PRESIDENT J. REUBEN CLARK, JR. 

First Counselor in the First Presidency 

Last night I reported to President Grant by telephone the 
first day of the Conference. He was delighted, of course, to know 
that we had had such a wonderful time together, and was keenly 
desirous that we should continue to enjoy the blessings of the Lord. 

EXPLANATION OF MANNER OF VOTING 

We shall now present for your sustaining vote the General 
Authorities, and certain Church-wide groups of officers, of the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 

For the benefit of the strangers who may be meeting here with 
us or listening on the air, a few words of explanation may be given. 

To speak in terms of political science, this assembly here today, 
this Annual Conference, of the Priesthood and membership of the 
Church will, for the purpose of sustaining the Authorities of the 
Church, act as a constituent assembly. Every General Authority 
of the Church, as well as other Church officers, comes before such 
an assembly twice each year. 

Again speaking in terms of political science, in the Church the 
nominating power rests in a group, the General Authorities, but the 
sustaining or electing power rests in the body of the Church, which 
under no circumstances nominates officers, the function of the 
Church body being solely to sustain or to elect. In fact, as will be 
seen, the General Authority or other officer is proposed to the 
body of the Church for their sustaining vote. 

The sole function of this constitutent assembly today, is, as 




GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Second Day 



already stated, to accept or reject the General Authority or other 
officers proposed to them. This assembly may not propose others 
to be voted upon. 

Futhermore, the actual procedure for voting is normally by 
the uplifted hand of those present. No electioneering, no speech- 
making, no stating of objections, no proposing of candidates, no 
vocal demonstration of any kind is in order. Anyone seeking to do 
any of these things would not only be out of order as a matter of 
procedure, but would be likewise breaking the peace of the State by 
interrupting and disturbing a public assembly, would be subject to 
arrest as a disturber of the peace, and if necessary, would have to be 
so dealt with as a matter of public order. This assembly might be 
called the "voting booth 1 " of the Church. This will be clear to all 
our listeners. 

It is obvious that only members of the Church are entitled to 
vote, and an excommunicant is not a member. 

Anyone not desiring to sustain anyone proposed may not only 
indicate his dissent here but he may, if he wishes, present his objec- 
tions to the proper authority of the Church, and will be given an ap- 
propriate hearing. This is the rule and order of the Church. 



The result of this system is that there has never been any politics 
in the Church. Church-men do not seek Church office. The best 
evidence that a man is unfit for Church office is the fact that he 
wants it. 

The principle behind the system is set forth in the fifth of the 
Articles of Faith, — the equivalent of the creed of other churches. 
It reads — 

We believe that a man must be called of God, by prophecy, and 
by the laying on of hands, by those who are in authority to preach 
the Gospel and administer in the ordinances thereof. 

REVELATIONS REGARDING THE PRESIDENT OF THE CHURCH 

That the matter may be better understood, it should be said 
that the President of the Church is "the Presiding High Priest over 
the High Priesthood of the Church." 

The revealed rule on this is as follows : 

Then comes the High Priesthood which is the greatest of all. 

Wherefore, it must needs be that one be appointed of the High 
Priesthood to preside over the Priesthood, and he shall be called Presi- 
dent of the High Priesthood of the Church ; 

Or in other words, the Presiding High Priest over the High Priest- 
hood of the Church. (Doctrine and Covenants 107:64-66.) 



The President of the Church ... is appointed by revelation and ac- 
knowledged in his administration by the voice of the Church. (Doctrine 
and Covenants 102:9.) 



CHURCH OFFICES NOT SOUGHT 



Again : 



PRESIDENT J. REUBEN CLARK, JR. 73 

As to the duties and functions of the President of the Church, 
the revealed rule provides : 

And again, the duty of the President of the office of the High Priest- 
hood is to preside over the whole Church, and to be like unto Moses — 

Behold, here is wisdom; yea, to be ,a seer, a revelator, a translator, 
and a prophet, having a 'l the gifts of God which he bestows upon the 
head of the Church. (Doctrine and Covenants 107:91,92.) 

DUTIES OF THE FIRST PRESIDENCY 

To the First Presidency in the Prophet Joseph's time, the Lord 
said : 

And now, verily I say unto you, I give unto you a commandment 
that you continue in the ministry and presidency. * * * 

And set in order the churches, and study and learn, and become 
acquainted with all good books, and with languages, tongues, and people. 

And this shall be your business and mission in all your lives, to 
preside in council, and set in order all the affairs of this Church and 
Kingdom. (Doctrine and Covenants 90:12, IS. 16.) 

Other pertinent revealed rules regarding the presiding author- 
ity of the Church are : 

Of the Melchizedek Priesthood, three Presiding High Priests, chosen 
by the body, appointed and ordained to that office, and upheld by the con- 
fidence, faith, and prayer of the Church, form a quorum of the Presidency 
of the Church. * * * 

The Twelve are a Traveling Presiding High Council, to officiate 
in the name of the Lord, under the direction of the Presidency of the 
Church, agreeable to the institution of heaven; to build up the Church, 
and regulate all the affairs of the same in all nations, first unto the Gen- 
tiles and secondly unto the Jews. * * * 

The Presidency of the High Priesthood, after the order of Melchize- 
dek, have a right to officiate in all the offices in the Church. (Doctrine 
and Covenants 107 :22, 33, 39.) " 

Speaking to the Presidency in 1832 the Lord said : 

Unto whom I have given the keys of the Kingdom, which belong 
always unto the Presidency of the High Priesthood. (Doctrine and 
Covenants 81 :2.) 

RESPONSIBILITY IN VOTING 

With this view of the rights, powers, and duties of the President 
of the High Priesthood of the Church, and also of the First Presi- 
dency, it is clear that the sustaining vote by the people is not, and 
is not to be regarded as, a mere matter of form, but on the contrary 
a matter of the last gravity. Every person is entitled to indicate 
whether or not he or she can sustain the officer proposed. While 
all the Church members vote and sustain the officer, yet the sustain- 
ing Priesthood power comes from the Priesthood itself. Your voting 
will result in the Church body's acknowledging the administration 



74 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Saturday. April 6 Second Day 

of the man appointed by revelation as the Presiding High Priest over 
the High Priesthood of the Church. 

You here today will by your vote also sustain those who, in 
the due order of the Church, labor with and under the President's 
authorized direction. 

It is therefore the high and solemn duty of the Priesthood of 
the Church to gather to this constitutent assembly, this Conference 
of the Church, and to cast their sustaining vote for him who is ap- 
pointed the Presiding High Priest, the President of the Church, and 
for those under him whose names shall be presented. Those who 
come here thus to declare their acknowledging and sustaining, as the 
President of the High Priesthood and as the Presiding High Priest 
over the High Priesthood of the Church, him whom God has called 
to this office, deserve the blessing they will thereby receive. They 
are to be commended for their attendance here today. It is to be 
hoped they will attend all future assemblies of this sort.

At the suggestion of President Clark, the congregation arose 
and sang the hymn, "We Thank Thee, O God for a Prophet." 



ELDER M. DOUGLAS WOOD 

Former President of the West German Mission 

I am filled with appreciation this morning to be with you again 
in this wonderful Conference session. In my heart there is a prayer 
of gratitude to my Father in heaven ; first, for the privilege of mem- 
bership in this wonderful Church ; next, a prayer for our homes here 
in this wonderful land, a land that our Father in heaven Himself has 
told us is choice above all others ; and third, there is in my heart a 
prayer for those thirty thousand members of the Church in Europe 
who, at this time, without the missionaries and in their greatest 
trials, — need our faith and prayers. I feel grateful for the privilege 
of laboring among those fine German Saints whom we all learned 
to love. It was also a privilege to be able to associate with those 
noble missionaries in the West German Mission. I am sure that 
these Elders will never forget their many experiences in that coun- 
try, and also in getting out of it. When times are hard you find that 
you are not very strong yourself and you learn to rely almost entirely 
upon the Lord to guide you. 

If the German Missions had to be closed, if the world had to 
be the scene of so much trouble and care, I feel that it was indeed 
a privilege to be chosen to be there at that time, and to try to lighten 
the burdens of the Saints. Because the time is short I shall confine 
my talk to relating a few missionary experiences during the evacua- 
tion of the country prior to the Polish war. 

On Friday, the 25th of August, my wife and I were traveling in 
the company of Elder Joseph Fielding Smith and Sister Smith in 
Northern Germany, after coming into the country from Denmark. 
Friday morning we received a telegram from the First Presidency, 
which was relayed from our office in Frankfurt to Hanover, telling 
us that we should immediately evacuate Germany. We were told 
to take our missionaries and go either to Holland or to Denmark. 
We were then six hours from our Mission headquarters. 

I said to Brother Smith : "My wife and I should be in Frank- 



*See remarks by President J. Reuben Clark, Jr., page 82. 



78 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Saturday. April 6 Second Day 

furt. There are so many things to do. Things are beginning to 
happen so fast, you see here iu Hanover the women are already driv- 
ing the street cars, and I have never seen so much real excitement. 
I am afraid we must work fast, and we should be in Frankfurt." 

I went to the hotel clerk and told him to get me reservations on 
the plane to fly to Frankfurt. He looked at me and said : "Those 
reservations, I am sure, have been gone for some time. Frankfurt 
is on the main European line and all reservations on that line are 
reserved two weeks ahead. Now with this Polish trouble I am sure 
that you could not buy a ticket for any consideration." 

I said : "Call them up anyway. Call the airport. We must 
have two reservations." 

He scratched his head after he called and said, "There are two 
left." 

I said : "That is all that we need, and thank you so much." 

In an hour and twenty minutes we were in Frankfurt. We flew 
with the last airplane over that line of passenger service. The plane 
was taken off at Frankfurt and sent to the Polish front. As we flew 
over that beautiful country we could not help but admire the beauty 
of the scenery of the country below and we reflected what a won- 
derful thing the plane was when it carried people so rapidly, and 
what a shame to destroy property and life with it. At home we 
immediately sent telegrams to all our Elders telling them to pack 
their trunks and take them with them that night into Holland. We 
had called the Dutch consul for permission to enter Holland again 
and had received it. We decided on Holland as it was closer to most 
of our missionaries. We had 85 missionaries scattered from the 
Danish border on the north to Vienna on the south, which is quite 
a big territory. Things were getting exciting. The German people 
couldn't say much, but the feeling of unrest and impending trouble 
was everywhere present. 

We had never imagined the excitement would be like it was. 
There was none of it present the previous year when we went out of 
the country. Everything was tightening up all over. We had 
always felt that it would not be such a job to evacuate the country, 
especially after the "fire drill" of a year ago. We figured that we 
could always use the public utilities, but everybody else figured the 
same thing at this time. It took a little time to get the telegrams off 
to our Elders. We had also informed them to telegraph the office, or 
telephone, as they left, so that we could check on all of them. 

Friday afternoon and evening we sat in the office receiving no 
telegrams or telephone calls at all. We wondered if the missionaries 
had received our messages. We tried to telephone to a few of them 
in order to check up on the telegrams, but were unable to get anyone 
on the telephone. Everyone else had the same idea, and the tele- 
phone wires were clogged. We tried to send more telegrams and were 
told that temporarily all the chances for sending telegrams any- 
where were closed. 



ELDER M. DOUGLAS WOOD

Early that morning, (Saturday), one of the Elders called us by 
telephone from the Dutch border. He said : "President Wood, we 
have been here on the Dutch border for six hours and the Dutch will 
not let us in. We haven't a dime between us. What shall we do ?" 
A person cannot leave Germany with any money because there is 
controlled currency there. The Dutch had given us permission to 
enter, but things had happened so fast that the consul in Frankfurt 
did not know of the new arrangements until we told him. The Dutch 
remembered the last war and the lack of food in their country, and 
they were determined to have no foreigners there at all. 

I said, "Brother, if you will have faith, I will see that we get 
some money to you immediately." 

We telegraphed money to those Elders, and within five minutes 
after we had done so the operator called us and said : "We will not 
be able to take any more money by telegraph; however, I think I 
can get this last through." 

About that time a radio announcement was made by the gov- 
ernment, that after Sunday night at midnight, August 27th, the Ger- 
man government would not guarantee anyone his destination on the 
German railways. I shall never forget our feelings at that time. 
We had no telegraph nor telephone facilities, and railways were not 
available to us. We were not able to contact our missionaries, and 
we knew that most of them would be heading toward Holland. We 
knew they would arrive there without enough money to buy tickets 
to Denmark, and we knew that time was against us, with the rail- 
roads all being used for troop transportation. If ever we knew that 
we could do nothing of ourselves we were sure of it then. One of the 
girls took out our Mission history and read how the missionaries 
during the last war got out of the country. One of the Elders was 
not able to get out during the war and a few of our missionaries had 
to crawl on their hands and knees and make their way out behind 
the Russian lines. We knew these things and we knew the intense 
feeling of the parents at home. We knew that each one of you was 
relying upon us to see that your son was safe. Conditions were so 
unsettled there. We had seen the treatment of the Jews and we felt 
that we must do all in our power to see that those missionaries were 
safe. We also knew that we would be helped. Every mother and 
father in America was praying for their missionary sons, and we 
knew that the Lord would help us if we did all we could. 

About that time a big football player came into our office, a 
fine Idaho boy, who weighed over 200 pounds. 

I said : "Brother, did you ever carry a message to Garcia?" 

He said : "No, I didn't, but I'm willing to try." 

I said: "Elder, we have 31 missionaries lost somewhere be- 
tween here and the Dutch border. It will be your mission to find 
them and see that they get out." 

He set out for the Dutch border with 500 marks and tickets for 
Denmark and for London. We had heard that a few might be able 



80 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Saturdag. April 6 Second Dag 

to get into Holland if they had tickets for London. That was soon 
changed. After four hours on the train he arrived at Cologne, which 
is about half way to the Dutch border. We had told him to follow his 
impressions entirely as we had no idea what towns these 31 Elders 
would be in. Cologne was not his destination, but he felt impressed 
to get off the train there. It is a very large station, and was then 
filled with thousands of people. The call to arms had been given that 
day, and there were thousands of people going to the Polish border. 
There were many, many students returning to England, and many 
people returning from vacations before the train service stopped. 
There were so many people in the station that to find anyone there 
would have been next to impossible. This Elder stepped into this 
station and whistled our missionary whistle — "Do What is Right, Let 
the Consequence Follow." 

Down in one corner of that station was an Elder with an old 
couple who were also on a mission from America. They heard 
that call, and made their way safely to the train and were able to get 
into Holland with tickets for London. These three were stranded 
there. They couldn't call the office, as no more calls on telephones 
were accepted, and they had had nothing to eat all day. 

At another border station going into Holland this Elder arrived, 
after picking up missionaries along the way. As he rode along on 
the train he felt impressed at other stations to get out and whistle 
our call. At some stations he felt no impression at all, so he did not 
get out. At the border he found eight missionaries who had been 
locked in the station house all night. They were indeed glad to 
see the missionary from the office with tickets for Denmark, and 
money. A border officer stepped up and asked him how much 
money he had. He told him 500 marks. 

He said to the Elder : "Give me that money/' 

The missionary answered : "I will over my dead body. I was 
sent here to relieve these missionaries, and I will not give up the 
money." Just at that time a man in the other corner of the station 
was arrested for being a spy. Now a spy on a border is really some- 
thing important at war-time, and he attracted everybody's attention. 
The moment the officer turned, the Elders stooped down and made 
their way out of the station and out to the train. By this time the 
trains had stopped running regularly. These missionaries got on 
to unscheduled trains, traveled for fifteen or twenty minutes, and 
then they would get out at the next station. There they would stand 
until they felt impressed to get on another train. They had to trans- 
fer seventeen times on a route that regularly requires no more than 
two or three transfers before reaching Denmark. 

At another station three of our Elders were walking along the 
street. They were fortunate enough not to be locked up. A man 
came up to them and stated that he had seen them before, saying that 
he knew that they were Mormon missionaries. He said that he had 
been called to the Polish front and had 50 marks which he knew he

would not need and asked if they could use this money. They were 
without a penny, so they took it. This amount paid their way back 
to the little town where they had come from the day before. 

One of the Elders had received his allowance from home the 
day before. All the other Elders had used their surplus money to 
buy photographic equipment which could be taken out of the coun- 
try. This young man went to town but felt so bad about everything 
he just couldn't spend that money, so he put it into a drawer and 
said for his landlady to give it to the poor Saints if he did not come 
back. He did come back, however. The train had a ten-minute wait, 
and he ran up to the dwelling, got that money, and it was just enough, 
within a few pennies for food, to pay their way to Copenhagen, Den- 
mark. 

We arrived in Denmark early Monday morning with 21 mission- 
aries in our group. That morning we received a telegram from Presi- 
dent Murdock saying 14 of our group had arrived in The Hague. We 
now had only 17 to worry about. About two o'clock that afternoon 
we received a telegram from the football player saying seventeen of 
them were arriving that night at 7 :30. 

My dear brothers and sisters, these things I have told you today 
are true stories of our experiences in getting out of the country. 
They are testimonies that I am sure will remain with these mission- 
aries all their lives. Almost every one of our Elders could tell you a 
real faith-stirring story about his leaving Germany. We all arrived 
in Denmark with our hearts filled with gratitude and humility. One 
of our Elders was asked if he was a bit anxious about going home 
on a freighter and being led out of Denmark by a German pilot 
through the mines. 

He said: "That is child's play after the things we have been 
through in getting out of Germany. I don't think after all the trou- 
ble the Lord went to there that He is going to let us down in the 
middle of the ocean." 

I am grateful for this opportunity to bear you my testimony. I 
know that this is the true Church of God, that Jesus is the Christ, and 
that today Heber J. Grant is a prophet of our Father in heaven. I 
am happy to have had this opportunity of working in Germany 
among the German people. I am happy to have had the privilege 
of being there during those hard times. The Lord stood at our side 
and never once did we want or were we unable to meet the situa- 
tions at hand with His help. 

We were called to go to Sweden and assist in closing the Mis- 
sion there. I shall never forget the sights there. We have preached 
the Gospel in Europe for over 100 years, and this is the first time 
that all the missionaries have left. We thought that after our ex- 
periences in Germany we did not have any more tears left, our 
hearts were so sorrowful that we thought there was no more room 
for grief. One does not have to understand a language to under- 
stand those things. Those poor Swedish Saints! About 150 of them

gathered at the station to say "goodbye" to their missionaries. 
The wonderful trained chorus developed under the direction of 
Brother and Sister Larsen sang to the Saints there. They placed 
garlands of flowers on each missionary's neck and as the train pulled 
out, the Saints sang back to them, "God be with You Till we Meet 
Again." I just cannot tell you how we all felt. 

Those Saints will carry on in Europe. I ask you to please re- 
member them in your prayers at this time. Without missionaries 
and in their time of greatest trouble, they need our faith and love. 
May we be generous in our judgments and tolerant toward all God's 
children, here in safety, in luxury, in our homes in the Land of the 
Free, is my humble prayer, and I ask it in Jesus' name, Amen. 



The Ricks College Choir sang an anthem, "And the Glory of the 
Lord," (Handel). 

Elder Walter A. Jensen, President of the Lost River Stake, 
offered the closing prayer. 

Conference adjourned until 2 o'clock p. m. 



SECOND DAY 
AFTERNOON MEETING 

Saturday afternoon, April 6. 

As the time approached for commencing this session of the 
Conference, a great body of people had assembled to worship the 
Lord, every seat and available space in the great Tabernacle audi- 
torium and galleries being occupied. 

President J. Reuben Clark, Jr., called the meeting to order 
promptly at 2 o'clock, and announced that the Ricks College Choir, 
John M. Anderson, director, would furnish the music for this meet- 
ing. Alexander Schreiner was at the organ. 

The congregation and the Ricks College Choir sang the hymn, 
"The Spirit of God Like a Fire is Burning." 

Elder Arthur V. Watkins, President of the Sharon Stake, of- 
fered the opening prayer. 

The Ricks College Choir sang "Send Out Thy Light," (Gou- 
nod). ' 

PRESIDENT J. REUBEN CLARK, JR. 

First Counselor in the First Presidency - 

When I announced the voting this morning on the First Presi- 
dency I announced one dissenting vote. I am now informed that that 
dissenting vote was cast by an excommunicant who had no right to 
vote, and therefore the voting was unanimous. 



ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH

ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

I trust that I may enjoy the inspiration of the Almighty in what I 
may say this afternoon. My soul has been stirred during the meetings 
of this Conference. I have rejoiced at the remarks of my brethren, the 
sweet singing and the tones of the great organ. 

In no other place in the world can you witness a sight such as we see 
on this Temple Block today. The weather has been delightful, the new 
vegetation is coming on, the flowers are in bloom and we have a rare 
garden of youth at the back of us in this choir loft. 

I feel as I look into the faces of the men who have been forced to 
return from our foreign missions (due to the unwisdom of some of 
our Father's children in those lands) that I am glad they are at home. 
We have done a great deal of missionary work in Europe during the past 
one hundred years. I do not know whether the Lord has now decided 
to have us do more of our missionary work in other places where people 
have not yet had an opportunity to hear the Gospel. We have had thou- 
sands of missionaries in Europe and many people have had opportunity 
to hear the truth, as they have in the United States of America. Our 
Heavenly Father has said that He will not be mocked, and there will come 
a time when disaster will overtake the unrepentant sinner. 

BELIEF IN A GOD OF MIRACLES NECESSARY 

Some time ago I had a man ask me if the Latter-day Saints believed 
in Jesus Christ. I probably would have been shocked, but that was not 
the first time I have had that question asked. Even with the radio and 
our modern means of transportation, there are thousands of our Father's 
children in the world who do not know what we believe. They do not 
know that we worship the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the same 
Heavenly Father who preserved the Children of Israel in their flight from 
Egypt when Pharaoh's hosts were drowned in the sea. They do not 
know that we pray to the same God that was worshipped by Israel while 
they were traveling from Egypt to the promised land. He was a God of 
miracles. Feeding the Children of Israel with manna was a simple opera- 
tion for Him to perform. In His own way He has supplied food for 
His children always. He provided food for the Latter-day Saints when 
they came to this then wilderness and has fed us ever since, many times 
miraculously. 

We believe in the God who counseled the people, through Moses, and 
led them to their destination. Upon one occasion when Moses announced 
a policy some of the prominent men of the camp refused to conform to 
his advice and rebelled. They said : "We hold the Priesthood just the 
same as you do." They seemed not to realize that it was the Lord's advice 
they were ignoring and not Moses ! But the result was that while they 
were still defiant the earth opened and they were swallowed up in its 
depths. 



84 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Saturday, April 6 . Second Dag 

Another group of the same camp criticized Moses for what had 
occurred and a plague broke out among them and thousands of them died 
before it was stayed by the power of the Lord. 

We believe in that God who not only teaches us what we should do. 
but permits destruction to come upon us when we violate His laws. 

I am thinking as I stand here of the experience of the three Hebrew 
Children who passed through the fiery furnace and lived. That was a 
miracle wrought by the Lord in that day, as was the preservation of 
Daniel when he was cast into the den of hungry lions. 

You remember also the experience of those who came to America 
from the tower of Babel at the time of the confusion of tongues. Some 
of them pleaded with the Lord that they might retain their own language 
and they brought it with them to this country under the direction of this 
same Heavenly Father ; and later they, because of their failure to do what 
they should, lost their identity upon the land and were destroyed. 

The same Heavenly Father directed Lehi to bring his people to this 
country and marvelously preserved them, giving them an instrument called 
the Liahona whereby they could tell which direction they were going, and 
it worked only when they kept the commandments of God. That is the way 
the inspiration of the Almighty works with you ; it is when you keep His 
commandments and not otherwise. If we are worthy of it He never fails 
to give it to us. 

THE LOVE OF GOD THE SAME IN ALL AGES 

Think of the things that have happened in the world during past 
centuries. Loving all His children our Lord has tried to have His truth 
so disseminated that His children would accept it and, remarkable as it 
may seem, those who believed in the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob 
and obeyed Him have become the foremost nations of the world. 

In the Meridian of Time His only Begotten Son in the flesh was 
born. He turned water into wine and performed other miracles. He was 
cruelly slain, but was resurrected, and demonstrated that he still had a 
body of flesh and bones. He partook of fish and honeycomb with His 
disciples and visited them repeatedly as a resurrected being. He gave 
His life, making it possible for all mankind to be raised from the dead. 

America has been greatly blessed. I wonder if we appreciate how 
much the Lord has favored us. Our Heavenly Father told the Jaredites 
who came here from the Tower of Babel, and later told Lehi and his 
people that this was a land choice above all other lands, and if they kept 
His commandments they should prosper upon the land. Jesus of Nazareth 
came to visit the Western Hemisphere after His resurrection from the 
dead. He taught the people many truths and His teachings were so effec- 
tive that for two hundred years they who dwelt upon this land were a 
righteous people. 

And again, even in our day, the Savior of the world and His Father 
appeared to the youth Joseph Smith in their immortal glorified bodies 
and renewed to the world the knowledge of a personal God. 



ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH

We accept what the Bible teaches with reference to God the Father 
and Jesus Christ, His Son, and what the Book of Mormon teaches with 
reference to the same Godhead. We believe that in our own time they 
have again appeared, so that all doubts as to their existence has been re- 
moved. We believe that the Father and the Son came after they had 
prepared the way for the organization of the Church of Jesus Christ here 
in America. 

Just think of the coming of the Pilgrim fathers to this land, and 
how the Lord preserved them and made it possible for them to extend 
their power when the United States was born. Think of how He blessed 
and raised up the very men who prepared the Constitution of the United 
States. 

All down through the ages this same kind Father has been working 
with His children and in this, the fulness of times, Jesus Christ our Lord 
came and directed the organization of this Church and said that it should 
be called the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 

The Church was organized in 1830 and began to grow rapidly. But 
the adversary sought to impede its progress by falsehood, mobbing, mur- 
dering, and driving its members repeatedly. Finally the Church built the 
City of Nauvoo, the largest then in the State of Illinois. The organization 
was completed ; the Temple was built ; Joseph the Prophet had finished his 
work and been martyred. The time had come for the people to cross the 
Plains and establish themselves in the Rocky Mountains. It was the Lord's 
way. They had finished their work back there. They were driven again, 
this time far from so-called civilization. Our Heavenly Father preserved 
them. They were fed quails even as Israel was fed manna. They were 
led by the same God that led Israel and began the civilized settlement of 
this western land under His guidance. 

When they came into the valley and planted crops, crickets swarmed 
down to devour them. Starvation threatened the faithful outcasts, but 
the God of Israel intervened and sent the seagulls to destroy the crickets 
and the harvest was saved. The people had been preserved by a miracle. 

The waters in these valleys have been increased unto the people as the 
necessities required to mature crops, and the community has acknowledged 
God as the source of the gift. 

Missionaries have been sent to the four corners of the earth by this 
Church and they have proclaimed the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Many have 
not had training in the great universities of the world. Their education 
has been largely limited to the practical experiences of life, but they have 
had what is more potent in inspiring the human family, the companion- 
ship of the Holy Ghost. 

THE ADVERSARY OPPOSES THE LEADERS OF GOD'S WORK 

All down through the centuries that are past there have been those 
who have opposed the leaders appointed by the Lord. They defied Moses 
and were destroyed. They crucified Jesus of Nazareth, and disappeared 
from the world, while His name illumines the pages of all history. They 
cried out against Joseph Smith, the Prophet, and sought his death and 



86 GENERAL CONFERENCE

succeeded in destroying his mortal life, but his name will go ringing down 
through the ages as a man who tried to keep the commandments of God 
and teach His Truth, while the names of his murderers are held in derision 
or have been blotted out as God said they would. 

President Young had many annoyances and distresses come to him. 
The greatest pioneer leader the United States has seen was hated by 
misguided people because he led the Church when Joseph was martyred. 
Not only did he have the wisdom of man, but the inspiration of the Al- 
mighty. There were those who sought his life and would have taken it 
if they had had opportunity. He was charged with evil and there were 
those who persisted in following him and annoying him, and why? 
Because he was a servant of the Lord and all of the Presidents of this 
Church have been criticized by those who abused and hated them. The 
adversary of all righteousness is not satisfied to let the man who stands 
at the head of a great dispensation go unscathed. He works with men, 
not men who have unusual intelligence, but ordinary men, exceedingly 
ordinary men in most cases, and he puts evil into their hearts and into 
their minds. 

Think of the way they abused President Joseph F. Smith. Our daily 
newspapers here at one time were full of scurrilous articles, falsehoods. 
He was charged with things that were absolutely untrue. Why ? Because 
he was the representative of God upon the earth. 

THE LORD'S WAYS ARE DIFFERENT FROM MAN'S 

And so it has been down to our day. There are among us today some 
misguided men. I have no anger in my heart for them. I pity them be- 
cause they do not know better. They are finding fault with the leadership 
of the Church, particularly the President of the Church. And I stand 
here to say that no President that we have had has been more loyal to the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ than President Heber J. Grant. No President 
that we have had has been more willing to give his all that the Truth 
might be known among the nations of the earth, and yet there are those 
who are influenced by the adversary of all righteousness, who would be- 
little him and destroy his influence. I say unto you that his name will 
continue to be held in honor as a servant of the living God, while those 
who traduce him and misrepresent him will disappear from the earth, 
and the Lord has said their sins will be visited upon their children unless 
they repent. 

Today when I saw by uplifted hands of this great congregation the 
unanimous vote sustaining the President of the Church I was thrilled. 
You will see nothing like it in the world ; no other organization functions 
as this does. Why ? Because this is the Lord's Church. It is carried on 
in the Lord's way ; it is different from the work of man. It is not our 
Church — it is the Church of Jesus Christ. 

How beautiful it is to sit here in this great house, apart from the 
distresses that afflict mankind, and wait upon Him who is our Heavenly 
Father, the Father of our spirits. We come into His presence in this 
house that has been sanctified by the devotion of some of the greatest 



ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH 87 



men and women who have ever lived, who have stood in this stand and 
proclaimed the Truth. The Church continues to grow and strengthen. 
The adversary will deceive some of those who are members of the Church. 
He has done it from the beginning. They have so far misinterpreted what 
our Heavenly Father desires that they array themselves not against His 
servants only but against the Lord Himself and thus impede the progress 
of His work, for which they will suffer the penalty. 

SAFETY IN KEEPING GOD'S COMMANDMENTS 

Today we have heard reports from the mission fields of the earth, 
mission fields that have been closed, because many of the people who live 
in those lands have refused to keep the commandments of God, and the 
adversary has put into their hearts to do the thing that has brought war 
into the world. Our own nation may not be free. The only hope for 
continued peace and prosperity in America, will be if our people retain 
their senses. When I say our people I mean American men and women 
who live upon this land that God said should only be recognized as His 
favored land when people kept His commandments. God the Eternal 
Father is our King; He is our Law-giver. President Grant is but the 
humble instrument in His hands, but he is the instrument, humble though 
he may be, with power to tell us what to do, and it is well for those who 
desire a place in the Celestial Kingdom to follow his leadership of the 
Church. I want to say that just as long as our Heavenly Father has sus- 
tained the Presidents of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints 
since its organization, those who have followed their leadership have been 
blessed and those who have apostatized and transgressed the law have 
lost their opportunity and their privilege and in many cases it passed away 
never to return. 

GRATITUDE FOR BLESSINGS 

I stand here within a few hundred yards of where I was born. I have 
seen the towers of the Temple rise. I was here when this building was 
decorated with festoons of paper flowers by the people. I was here when 
the organ was completed. I have lived here in this city to see it grow 
from a village to one of the most notable cities in the world. And I want 
to say that every man and every woman who has lived here and has kept 
the commandments of God has had an assurance that this is our Father's 
work which bears the name of His Beloved Son. 

And so today ought I not to be grateful, as I look at these fine young 
people and think of the opportunities that have come to them in our north- 
ern State, Idaho, and elsewhere, and realize that there are thousands of 
others who are being similarly trained and blessed? My heart is filled 
with gratitude to God that I was born in this age, that my loved ones 
have had opportunity to partake of these blessings that come only from 
the Father of us all, and they will be eternal if we will be faithful. 

I pray that the Spirit of the Lord may be in your hearts and in your 
homes. Attend to your prayers. Pray to Him who is the Author of your 
being. Do not be misled by the sophistries of men and the foolishness 



88 GENERAL CONFERENCE

of those that imagine things that are vain, but know this, that it is 
your privilege, it is within your power to know not only today and to- 
morrow, but every day, that God is God, and that Jesus is the Christ, 
that Joseph was a prophet, and that the leader of this Church is the repre- 
sentative of God upon the earth. You will know that only when you are 
keeping the commandments of our Heavenly Father. 

Now let us unite together always, as we have, in prayer and thanks- 
giving here today. Let us appreciate the blessings of our lives and set 
our own homes in order so that they will be sanctuaries to our own boys 
and girls and those who come there as strangers. Let the light of peace 
and love abound with us, that every soul we contact will be richer because 
of us. That is our privilege. 

God grant that we may continue to worship the God of Abraham, 
Isaac, and Jacob in honor through His beloved Son Jesus Christ, to the 
end that we may gain exaltation in the Celestial Kingdom when our life's 
labors are completed, I humbly pray in the name of His beloved Son 
Jesus Christ, Amen. 

ELDER CHARLES A. CALLIS 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

On Wednesday, of this week, President Heber J. Grant gra- 
ciously permitted me the privilege of visiting him for a few moments. 
Our'beloyed President is rapidly mending in health. He loves his 
people. 

A SPECIAL APPOINTMENT 

A little over a month ago I was honored by the First Presidency 
and the Council of the Twelve with an appointment to visit the Oahu 
Stake and the Hawaiian Mission and the Japanese Mission in Ha- 
waii. It was one of the finest missionary journeys I have ever had. 
The Islands are noted for their surpassing beauty and every island 
is covered with creation and life. 

The Conference was blessed by the Lord. There was a very 
large attendance. The Presiding Bishop of the Church, LeGrand 
Richards, made a notable contribution to the success of that im- 
portant gathering. President Ralph E. Woolley and his talented 
wife, Romania, are doing a splendid work in that distant outpost 
of the Church, and the Mission Presidents with their faithful wives 
are laboring with zeal to advance the work of God. It rejoiced my 
heart to see your sons and daughters in that Mission preaching the 
restored Gospel in the spirit of piety and with unwavering faith in 
God. They love the people — the Hawaiians, Japanese, Chinese, 
Portugese, Samoans and Filipinos. The missionaries love these peo- 
ple with the love of Christ and verily that love is mutual. 

EARLY MISSIONARY WORK IN HAWAII 



In one of our great hymns there is a line like this : "Mingling

with Gods he can plan for his brethren." That refers, as you well 
know, to the Prophet Joseph Smith. I believe with all my heart that 
Joseph Smith interceded with the Powers on high for the Gospel to 
be sent to the people of those Islands, and God sent forth His light. 
George Q. Cannon, Joseph F. Smith, Lorenzo Snow — these men 
were sent forth by the Lord and upon the lips of these soldiers of 
the Cross the word of God was mighty. There were other stalwarts 
sent forth and they did a remarkable work. 

We see but half the causes of our deeds, 
Seeking them wholly in the outer life 

And heedless of the encircling spirit world 

Which, though unseen, is felt, and sows in us 

All germs of pure and world-wide purpose. 

THE POWER OF JESUS CHRIST 

God turned His countenance towards that people and, as their 
fathers were worthy to receive the Gospel of Christ, so these humble 
and Christ-like children of God were deemed worthy of having 
preached to them the restored Gospel. As I looked upon those 
people and preached to them, people of different nationalities, the 
thought came to me, some men appeal to certain people, other men 
to other people, but the Lord Jesus Christ appeals to all men. His 
voice is the authoritative voice that is sounding in the hearts of 
men and women today. In the pre-existent state when the sons 
of God shouted for joy it is my firm belief that Jesus Christ was the 
only one who was willing to pay the price for the redemption of the 
children of God. Blessed be His holy name forever. 

A VISIT TO THE ISLAND OF M0LOKAI 

Before I left the Islands I felt a strong urge to visit those strick- 
en people — the lepers — on the Island of Molokai. The only way to 
reach that place then was by airplane. I had never been in one of 
these machines but my wife, who accompanied me, urged me to try 
the plane. I did, and I believe God took the fear out of my heart. As 
we were passing over the Pacific from one island to another, the 
pilot pointed downward and there in the blue depths of the Pacific 
was a school of whales disporting themselves. When we arrived 
on the island a delegation of those afflicted people was there to wel- 
come us with songs. The officer said to me as I approached them 
"Go no closer." President Cox and his wife were with us." 

We met with those afflicted people — afflicted only in body — in 
our meeting house. Irrespective of creed they came to the services. 
I spoke to them about the resurrection and of the love God had for 
them, and in the course of my address I quoted the immortal words 
of Jesus, which should ring in the hearts of every man and woman 
in the world : "Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least 
of these, my brethren, ye have done it unto me." 

At the close of my remarks a brother, who was presiding over 
the meeting, the Justice of the Peace, himself a leper, arose and made 



90 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Saturday, April 6 Second Day 

a response which for eloquence I have never heard surpassed. It 
was the eloquence that comes from the heart, not from the lips. 
He said, "Apostle Callis, we could not go to Honolulu to attend that 
big Conference, but you have come to us and you have fed us ; you 
have come to the least of your brethren, and inasmuch as you have 
done it unto us, you have done it unto the Lord Jesus Christ." And 
he continued, "We are happy. We cannot greet you with a hand- 
shake. Some of us have received the Gospel since we were on this 
island, and the joy and the comfort we receive from the Gospel has 
more than compensated us for our affliction, our infirmities. God 
will bless you, Brother Callis, for coming to the least of these your 
brethren." He closed the meeting while my tears were fast falling, 
and then to think though I loved this people, I had to pass through 
them while they withdrew to one side ; could not touch them, could 
not shake hands with them. Oh, brethren and sisters, how blessed 
we are ! It seems to me that God in Heaven is preparing a house for 
His afflicted children, a resurrected body, the glories of which have 
not entered into their minds to conceive. 

TESTIMONY OF GOd's GOODNESS 

I humbly testify that this work is of God ; that Christ is appeal- 
ing unto all nations, and ere long they will receive His teachings 
for He is the Holy One of Israel. He is the Savior of the world. 
This Gospel is the power of God unto salvation. Joseph Smith, min- 
gling with Gods, is planning for his brethren, for this people. God 
bless him forever. 

I testify that President Grant is an Apostle of the Lord Jesus 
Christ. He is God's choice for President of this Church, and he is 
a Prophet, Seer, and Revelator, loved by his people, honored by the 
Lord, and one whose love cannot be shaken for his people and for 
his God. I so testify in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

ELDER SAMUEL O. BENNION 

Of the First Council of the Seventy 

This is an inspiring sight. I believe I have never been more 
filled with thankfulness unto the Lord for the strength of Zion than 
at the present time. I recognize here in this building the leaders of 
the Church in all parts of the country, men and women who have 
gathered together to get more information concerning their work 
to take back to the different Stakes of Zion and the world, and it is 
a glorious sight. I endorse the expression by some who have pre- 
ceded me relative to the fine and inspirational words of welcome that 
came to us from President Heber J. Grant. I marvel at the strength 
and power of the man. I know that if God were not with him, he 
could not have stood the many responsibilities that have been his, 
and I believe with all my heart that the faith and prayers and devo- 
tion of the Latter-day Saints have kept him from being destroyed, 
and that the Lord has preserved his life.

AN INSPIRED LEADERSHIP 

I marvel at the leadership of the Church. I am thankful that 
President McKay is alive and so well after such an illness, an illness 
which seemed to have power to strike him down but failed. I am 
sure that all who listened to President Clark yesterday were thrilled 
with the power of his message, that they could not help but say in 
their hearts "There is the voice of God," the leadership that the Lord 
inspired him to take in this Conference, covering so well the things 
that need to be expressed and understood by the Latter-day Saints. 

It is always an inspiration for me, brothers and sisters, to attend 
these Conferences and hear the testimonies of the leaders of the 
Church as they bear witness to the truth of the restored Gospel. 

When they speak as they do during these Conferences, they do 
so as men having authority, for they are divinely empowered to de- 
clare this restored message of latter days. They are God's represen- 
tatives, bearing witness in modern times, as His ancient prophets did 
in their day. 

WITNESSES FOR CHRIST 

The Lord has declared that in the mouths of witnesses shall all 
things be established. This has been a rule of the Gospel in all 
ages. It was so in the days of Moses and Aaron, it was so in the days 
of the Master, and it is equally so today. 

In the Meridian of Time the Apostles of the Lord became eye 
witnesses to the works of the Master. They accompanied Him 
throughout His ministry, saw His acts of kindness, and heard Him 
teach the multitudes which followed Him. Some of His disciples 
were with Him at the time of His transfiguration, and in His final 
suffering. They saw Him betrayed by Judas, and later crucified. 
They were witnesses of His burial in the tomb of Joseph of Arima- 
thea, and finally they were eye witnesses of His resurrection. They 
saw Him after He came forth from the tomb, and heard His voice. 
Some felt Him, so that they knew He was not merely a spirit. They 
saw Him eat, and at last beheld Him ascend to His Father in heaven. 
They were in every sense of the word, witnesses of the Lord. By 
their experience they could testify to the world concerning Him. 

When the time came for the appointment of one to succeed 
Judas, who betrayed the Lord, Peter stood up in the midst of the dis- 
ciples and said : 

Wherefore of these men which have companied with us all the time 
that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us * * * must one be ordained 
to be a witness with us of His resurrection. 

And when they had drawn lots, the lot fell upon Matthias, "and 
he was numbered with the eleven Apostles." 

I would have you note here that when Matthias was called to 
the Apostleship he was called to be a living witness of the resurrec- 
tion of the Lord Jesus Christ. This was definitely the mission the 



92 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Saturday. April 6 Second Day 

Lord had in mind for His ancient Apostles, for He said to them at 
one time : "Ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and 
in all Judea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the 
earth." 

As Peter bore his testimony at one time concerning the risen 
Lord, he declared that Jesus would come again to the earth at the 
time of the restitution of all things which God hath spoken by the 
mouths of all His holy prophets since the world began. 

MODERN WITNESSES 

We are now living in the time of the restitution of all things. 
The Gospel has been restored to the earth, together with the power 
by which its ordinances are to be administered. If all things were 
to be restored, then this principle of witnesses must likewise be re- 
stored, so that in our day men may receive the testimony of eye- 
witnesses of the Lord and His work. 

We declare that this principle has been restored, and that in 
modern times mortal men have become eye witnesses of the Lord 
and His work, and that through having seen and talked with Him 
these men were able to give testimony similar to that borne by Peter 
and Paul in ancient times. 

As Moses of old talked with God face to face, as the ancient 
Apostles saw and talked with the Lord after His resurrection, so 
did Joseph Smith, the modern prophet and some of his most intimate 
associates see the Lord, becoming eye-witnesses of Him and His 
work. 

Concerning one of these experiences which occurred in the Kirt- 
land Temple, Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery wrote the following : 

We saw the Lord standing upon the breastwork of the pulpit, before 
us ; and under His feet was a paved work of pure gold, in color like 
amber. His eyes were as a flame of fire; the hair of His head was white 
like the pure snow; His countenance shone above the brightness of the 
sun; and His voice was as the sound of the rushing, of great waters, even 
the voice of Jehovah, saying: 

I am the first and the last ; I am He who liveth, I am He who was 
slain; I am your advocate with the Father. 

Concerning another such experience, we have the following tes- 
timony : 

We, Joseph Smith, Junior, and Sidney Rigdon, being in the Spirit on 
the sixteenth day of February in the year of our Lord one thousand eight 
hundred and thirty-two — by the power of the Spirit our eyes were opened 
and our understandings were enlightened, so as to see and understand 
the things of God — even those things which were from the beginning 
before the world was, which were ordained of the Father through His 
Only Begotten Son, who was in the bosom of the Father, even from the 
beginning ; of whom we bear record, and the record which we bear is the 
fulness of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, who is the Son, whom we saw and 
with whom we conversed in the heavenly vision. 

Through other experiences also, the leaders of our Church 



ELDER SAMUEL 0. BENNION 93 



became witnesses of the Lord, divinely empowered to testify to all 
the world of the restoration of the Gospel, of the fact that God lives, 
and that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, for they saw Him and 
talked with Him as did the ancient Apostles. 

But these are not the only instances in which men became 
witnesses of the work of the Lord. 

MORE THAN ONE WITNESS NECESSARY 

As it is declared, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses so 
shall all things be established, so witnesses were chosen for other 
phases of the work of God in these last days. 

It is a striking thing that at no time were any of the keys of the 
Priesthood restored in our time when only one man was present. 
Always there were two. Oliver Cowdery and Joseph Smith were 
together when John the Baptist restored the Aaronic Priesthood. 
Likewise they were together when the Melchizedek Priesthood was 
restored. When the keys of the gathering of Israel, of the dispensa- 
tion of the Gospel in the days of Abraham, and the keys held by 
Elijah were brought again to the earth, these two men were together 
to receive them, so that in compliance with this law of witnesses, 
there would be more than one voice to declare the truth to the 
world, and so that being two, one would corroborate the other and 
thus establish the truth of what they said. 

Since the coming forth of the Book of Mormon was to form 
such a prominent part of the restoration plan, and since it carried 
in and of itself such an important message to the world, the Lord 
saw fit to provide it with the testimony of witnesses. 

Its origin was not to be declared solely upon the word of the 
Prophet Joseph Smith. Eleven other men were chosen to be wit- 
nesses of that book. Each one saw the plates with his own eyes, 
and signed a testimony to that effect. 

Three of these witnesses were shown the plates by an angel 
who appeared to them and displayed the engraved writings before 
them as a voice from heaven declared the record was true, and that 
the translation thereof was correct. 

DAVID WHITMER'S TESTIMONY 

For years I resided in the middle west where also lived men and 
women who knew David Whitmer, one of the Three Witnesses to 
the Book of Mormon. I have talked with some of these people 
concerning him and his testimony, and although they were not 
members of the Church, they united in saying that David Whitmer 
remained faithful to his testimony to the very end. 

At one time it was reported that he had denied this testimony, 
but when he heard of it, he published a new declaration concerning 
the Book of Mormon. In this new pronouncement, he affirmed 
positively the truth of his original testimony, saying that he had 
seen the angel, that he had seen the original plates from which the 



94 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Saturday, April 6 Second Dag 

Book of Mormon was translated, and that his testimony as published 
in the Book of Mormon was true. At this time he was not a member 
of the Church, having been excommunicated previously. 

OLIVER COWDERY AND MARTIN HARRIS 

Oliver Cowdery and Martin Harris, the others who signed the 
testimony of the Three Witnesses, likewise remained true and faith- 
ful to their testimony concerning this book. They always affirmed, 
wherever they were, that they had signed their names as the Book 
of Mormon bears evidence. Oliver Cowdery died in Richmond, 
Missouri, while he was visiting with his brother-in-law, David 
Whitmer, for David Whitmer married his sister. He, Oliver, had 
joined the Church again in Omaha, or Florence, where the Saints 
were gathering, and took a last trip down to see his sister. There 
he sickened and died and did not come West. But Martin Harris 
came West, and affiliated with the main body of the Church. 

TESTIMONY COMES THROUGH THE POWER OF THE HOLY GHOST 

As the early leaders of the Church were witnesses of the re- 
stored Gospel, so we today witness that we too know of the truth 
of these things. Latter-day Saints throughout the world also testify 
that they know the restored Gospel of Christ is true. By the power 
of the Holy Ghost, the Lord has borne witness to their spirits that 
Mormonism is divine, and by the same power do we here today 
reaffirm our own faith in this work. 

We say to all men who wish to know whether these things are 
true to ask of God who giveth to all men liberally, and, in the 
language of the Prophet Moroni, if we shall ask in faith, nothing 
doubting, believing in the Lord, He shall manifest the truth of it by 
the power of the Holy Ghost, and this is the way that all men may 
know the Gospel of Jesus Christ; that is, by the testimony of this 
great witness, the power of the Holy Ghost. 

I give to the children of men in this audience and to all who may 
be listening, men with whom I may associate and men whom I 
do not know, who are listening in, I bear my testimony that this 
is the work of God and the same evidence that comes to me will 
' come to you, it will come to all men who will make an investigation 
and will humble themselves before God. The true greatness of His 
power shall be made manifest and all who do it and keep the com- 
mandments of God shall, in the language of the great Nephite 
Prophet, be saved in the everlasting Kingdom of the Lamb of God. 
Amen.

ELDER JOSEPH FIELDING SMITH 95 



ELDER JOSEPH FIELDING SMITH 

Of the Council of the Tzvelve Apostles 

I have greatly rejoiced in the testimonies given at this Confer- 
ence. With my brethren I regret very much the absence of President 
Grant, and pray earnestly for his speedy return in full health and 
vigor. I have been extremely happy because of the nature of the re- 
marks that have been made by those who have spoken. I feel very 
humble, and pray that the Spirit of the Lord will lead me this after- 
noon in the remarks that I may make, for I have only one desire and 
that is to say the things the Lord would have me say. 

I am going to read from the 59th section of the Doctrine and 
Covenants : 

Wherefore I give unto them [meaning the members of the Church] 
a commandment, saying thus : Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all 
thy heart, with all thy might, mind, and strength; and in the name of 
Jesus Christ thou shalt serve Him. 

Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. Thou shalt not steal; neither 
commit adultery, nor kill, nor do anything like unto it. 

Thou shalt thank the Lord thy God in all things. 

COVENANTS TO BE KEPT 

Every person baptized into this Church has made a covenant 
with the Lord to keep His commandments, and in this command- 
ment, reiterated in the dispensation in which we live, we are told that 
we are to serve the Lord with all the heart and all the mind, and with 
all the strength that we have, and that too in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Everything that we do should be done in the name of Jesus 
Christ. 

In the waters of baptism we covenanted that we would keep 
these commandments ; that we would serve the Lord ; that we would 
keep this first and greatest of all the commandments, and love the 
Lord our God ; that we would keep the next great commandment, 
we would love our neighbor as ourselves; and with all the might 
that we have, with all the strength, with all our hearts we would 
prove to Him that we would "live by every word that proceedeth 
forth from the mouth of God f that we would be obedient and hum- 
ble, diligent in his service, willing to obey, to hearken to the counsels 
of those who preside over us and do all things with an eye single to 
the glory of God. 

We should not forget these things, for this commandment is 
binding upon us as members of the Church. 

Now may I read you another commandment : 

But ye (again having reference to the members of the Church) are 
commanded in all things to ask of God, who giveth liberally; and that 
which the Spirit testifies unto you even so I would that ye should do in all 
holiness of heart, walking uprightly before me, considering the end of 
your salvation, doing all things with prayer and thanksgiving, that ye may 



96 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Saturday, April 6 Second Day 

not be seduced by evil spirits, or doctrines of devils, or the command- 
ments of men; for some are of men, and others of devils. 

Wherefore, beware lest ye are deceived; and that ye may not be 
deceived seek ye earnestly the best gifts, always remembering for what 
they are given. 

Now, my good brethren and sisters, if we are humble, if we are 
diligent in the service of the Lord, if we seek to serve Him with an 
eye single to the glory of our Father in heaven, keeping in mind that 
He has asked for that service with a full heart, with all our might, 
with all our mind, and with all our strength, we will not go astray, 
we will not be seduced by evil spirits nor by the spirits of men, but 
we will be led and directed by the Spirit of God. 



GUIDANCE COMES THROUGH THE HOLY GHOST 

Every member of the Church has had hands laid upon his head 
for the gift of the Holy Ghost. He has a right to receive the revela- 
tions that are expedient and necessary for his guidance individually ; 
not for the Church, but for himself. He has a right through his 
obedience, through his humility, to receive light and truth as it 
shall be revealed through the Spirit of Truth, and he who will 
hearken to that Spirit and seek for the gift of the Spirit in humility 
and faith shall not be deceived. 

Now there are some of our people who are being deceived. 
Why? Because they lack knowledge, because they lack understand- 
ing, and because they are not in tune with the Holy Spirit, which 
they have a right to receive through their faithfulness and obedience. 

PRESIDENT LORENZO SNOw's COUNSEL REGARDING TITHING 

I would like briefly to call attention to a few things that have 
been mentioned here, and some that have not. I would like to say a 
word or two about tithing. It has been mentioned, and I am very 
grateful to know that it has. I want to read to you a few words that 
were uttered by President Lorenzo Snow when he was pleading 
with the people to be honest with the Lord. Now we are not faithful 
Latter-day Saints if we are dishonest with the Lord, we are not 
serving Him with all our hearts, with all our might, with all our 
strength if we are dishonest in the payment of our tithes and our 
offerings, and we shall stand before the Lord condemned and not 
entitled to the guidance of His Holy Spirit, and likely will be de- 
ceived by these spirits that lie in wait to deceive, if we are guilty of 
failing to keep this great commandment or any other of the com- 
mandments that the Lord has given us. 

These are the words of President Snow to the Church : 

Teach the children to pay tithing so that it may be properly observed. 
If we observe this law, no matter what our enemies may do the Lord will 
preserve us. Because we are His sons and daughters He loves us, and He 
has forgiven our forgetfulness of this holy law in the past, but He will not 
forgive you and me any longer, should we continue in this dilatory way of 



ELDER JOSEPH FIELDING SMITH 



97 



paying tithing. We shall be scattered just as the people in Jackson County 
were. This is true as the Lord is true. The Lord has blessed us wonder- 
fully and preserved us in the land and yet we haveref used to pay our honest 
debt unto Him. A great many people have not paid one cent of tithing, and 
yet they have gone into the temples of the Lord. 

Then speaking to the officers of the Stakes and Wards he said : 

How do you feel when you give a recommend to a person to come into 
our Temples who pays no tithing, who only pays half a tithing? How will 
you feel after this ? You will feel that you are taking a sacred responsibility 
in doing that which God does not approve. He has said that the man who 
fails to pay his tithing shall have no place among the people of God. Yet 
here are these Temples erected by the sacrifice of the poor, and to give 
recommends to parties who pay little or no tithing, how can you feel to 
take this responsibility? I could not. Part of a tithing is not tithing at 
all in the eyes of the law that the Lord has revealed. 

PRESIDENT BRIGHAM YOUNG'S ADVICE TO BISHOPS 

I have another statement here from President Brigham Young, 
given to the Bishops of the Church : 

These men and women whom you recommend must be individuals who 
pay their tithing from year to year ; that is, those who are recommended 
to go to the Temple should pray and not speak against the Authorities of 
the Church, against the Kingdom of God, nor steal, nor lie, nor interfere 
with their neighbors' things, nor their neighbors' wives or husbands, but 
attend strictly to meetings, and prayer meetings, and those who pay due 
respect to their presiding officers and Bishops, and those who do not swear. 

People who are guilty of these offenses, according to President 
Young, should not be recommended to go to the Temple to receive 
the ordinances of the House of the Lord. 

FAST DAY REQUIREMENTS 

Let me say a word or two now in regard to Fasting and Fast 
offerings. This morning in the meeting that was held — the Welfare 
meeting we had portrayed before us the gradual rise of the percent- 
age of Fast offerings paid by the Church. Now, my good brethren 
and sisters, the amount that has been paid up to this present year is 
not by any means the amount that we ought to pay. We have not kept 
this commandment, for Fasting and prayer in faith and the payment 
of offerings are commandments of the Lord. We have been called 
upon to Fast. I do not know when we have heard a discourse on 
Fasting; not very often, am I am sure that we are not observing 
this law of Fasting as members of the Church as we ought to do. 
We have made it easy for the people, that is, easy to break this com- 
mandment because we have moved the Fast service up so high on the 
Fast Day that we can get all through and home again by one o'clock, 
or 12:30. That is a good time to eat, isn't it? And yet according 
to the commandment that the Lord has given to us through His 
servants we should abstain from food and water for one day, count- 
ing twenty-four hours, or from sunset to sunset. Now if you want to 



98 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Saturday, April 6 Second Day 



Fast from twelve o'clock noon until twelve o'clock noon I suppose it 
would be just as well if that is what you wish to do, but many of us 
are not observing the Fast Day now. 

I want to say to you, my good brethren, we cannot have that 
guidance of the Holy Spirit as we ought to have it if we do not Fast 
as the Lord has required it of us ; not extensive Fasts, but the Fast 
which has been set apart which we should do in wisdom. Now 
the Lord says we should do all things in wisdom, but we are not 
Fasting, hence we are not paying our Fast offerings ; we are not pray- 
ing I fear, as we should. I wonder if we are praying in our secret 
closets. I wonder if we are teaching our families to pray ; if the 
spirit of prayer is among us as it ought to be. 

I commend to your reading, and I shall not take time to do it, 
the words of an ancient prophet, found in the 34th chapter of Alma in 
the Book of Mormon. Amulek says that we should cry unto the 
Lord over our flocks, over our herds, over our goods, in our fields, 
and in our secret chambers, that we should do nothing but that we 
present the matter before the Lord and ask for His guidance and His 
blessing. We should go on our knees a little more and then we will 
have more faith. We need to be more humble in the service of the 
Lord. We need to spend less time in the criticism of those who pre- 
side. 

JOSEPH SMITH'S TEACHINGS REGARDING PERFECTION 

I am going to read to you a statement from the Prophet Joseph 
Smith that I think is important. I have a number of statements here 
that I should like to read, but I shall not take the time to do so, but 
this is worthy of our consideration : 

We consider that God has created man with a mind capable of in- 
struction, and a faculty which may be enlarged in proportion to the 
heed and diligence given to the light communicated from heaven to the 
intellect; and that the nearer man approaches perfection, the clearer are 
his views, and the greater his enjoyments, till he has overcome the evils 
of his life and lost every desire for sin; and like the ancients, arrives at 
that point of faith where he is wrapped up in the power and glory of his 
Maker and is caught up to dwell with Him. But we consider that this is 
a station to which no man ever arrived in a moment ; he must have been 
instructed in the government and laws of that Kingdom by proper 
degrees, until his mind is capable in some measure of comprehending the 
propriety, justice, equality, and consistency of the same. 

If God should speak from heaven, He would command you not to 
steal, not to commit adultery, not to covet, nor deceive, but be faithful 
over a few things. As far as we degenerate from God, we descend to 
the devil and lose knowledge, and without knowledge we cannot be saved, 
and while our hearts are filled with evil, and we are studying evil, there 
is no room in our hearts for good, or studying good. Is not God good? 
Then you be good; if He is faithful, then you be faithful. Add to your 
faith virtue, to virtue knowledge, and seek for every good thing. 

FAITHFULNESS A PROTECTION AGAINST EVIL 



The nearer we approach God, the better we endeavor to keep 
His commandments, the more we will search to know His will as it 



ELDER LEVI EDGAR YOUNG 



99 



has been revealed, the less likely it will be for us to be led astray by 
every wind of doctrine, by these false spirits that lie in wait to 
deceive, and by the spirits of men, as the Lord has stated in the rev- 
elations which I have read to you. We will be protected, and we will 
have the power to understand, to segregate truth from error, we 
will walk in the light and we will not be deceived. Now the man 
who is dilatory, the man who is unfaithful, the man who is not will- 
ing to keep the commandments of the Lord in all things lays himself 
open to deception because the Spirit of the Lord is not with him to 
lead and direct him and to show him the way of truth and righteous- 
ness, and therefore some error comes along and he absorbs it be- 
cause he cannot understand and realize the difference between truth 
and error. I want to tell you there is much error in this world that 
is passed off as truth, and it behooves every man of us to seek God, 
and, as stated by the prophet, draw near unto Him, and the nearer 
we draw unto Him, and the more we seek to do His will the more 
light we shall receive and the less shall be the danger of our decep- 
tion. And so I pray in the nariie of Jesus Christ our Lord, Amen. 

ELDER LEVI EDGAR YOUNG 

of the First Council of the Seventy and President 
of the New England Mission 

New England is one of the distinct geographical sections of the 
United States, and is the most thickly populated part of our coun- 
try. All the sectarian groups of America are naturally found among 
the people, who are as a rule very religious. They cherish the mem- 
ory of the Pilgrim fathers, who have left us a great example of 
mighty courage, for they never thought of themselves as making 
history. Of the one hundred and one passengers on the Mayflower, 
over half of them died the first winter. They gave us our Mayflower 
Compact, a document that has influenced the form of our government 
more than any other with the exception of the Magna Charta. 

EDUCATION IN NEW ENGLAND 

The New England people sponsored education from the first, 
and today, metropolitan Boston boasts of twenty-seven colleges and 
universities. It is a section that has the oldest colleges of the 
United States — Harvard, Yale, Brown, Dartmouth, and many other 
famous universities. To these higher institutions of learning, stu- 
dents come from all over the world, and many of our own Utah 
boys and girls are studying in them. We feel that New England 
is a fruitful field for the Gospel because its people naturally have a 
high regard for culture and the principles of Christianity. 

FAITH NECESSARY TO THE HIGHER LIFE 

In this Conference, our brethren have emphasized the subject 



100 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Saturday, April 6 Second Day 

of faith in God and the Lord Jesus Christ. Faith is one of the prin- 
cipal characteristics of a soul, seeking the higher things of life. It 
is that something whch tells us that God lives. George Santayana, 
who was at one time professor of Spanish and Spanish literature at 
Harvard College, has expressed the beauty of faith in his poem 
called "Columbus." It reads. 

O world, thou choosest not the better part! 

It is not wisdom to be only wise, 

And on the inward vision close the eyes; 

But it is wisdom to believe the heart. 

Columbus found a world and had no chart, 

Save one that faith deciphered in the skies. 

To trust the soul's invincible surmise 

Was all his science and his only art. 

Our knowledge is a torch of smoky pine 

That lights the pathway but one step ahead 

Across a void of mystery and dread. 

Bid, then, "the tender light of faith to shine 

By which alone the mortal heart is led 

Unto the thinking of the thought divine. 

If we will direct our thoughts to the last days of Jesus Christ 
on earth, we will have our faith strengthened in such a manner that 
will give our souls a joy divine. On the night He was taken to meet 
His death, He said to His Disciples : 

THE MESSAGE OF JESUS 

"Because I live ye shall also live." The Easter Day was the 
vindication of what He knew. "It must needs be," He said, "that 
the Son of man should suffer and be put to death and rise again. Be- 
cause I live, ye shall also live." We may be sure that this word of 
the Savior is one of the eternal truths of God. And then He left 
us another word : "I am not of this world," and the people said : 
"This man speaks with authority and not as the scribes." There 
are in these words something transcendent in meaning and some- 
thing more beautiful than this world today can understand. There is 
a sureness to them ; there is a something that goes deep into our 
hearts that all the education of the world cannot efface. To all Chris- 
tian people and to all Pagan nations, Jesus also utters other words to- 
day with more power than ever : "Fear not ; I am the first and the last, 
but am alive forevermore." Ringing down through all the centuries, 
this eternal message of Him who died for us gives us the renewed 
faith and hope as nothing else can do. You and I are citizens of the 
aeons of time that have created our present day. Will we forget 
them in our onward march in the conquest of material things? 

MODERN ACCOMPLISHMENTS 

The ends of the earth are brought to us at our breakfast tables. 
Wonders and powers have been put into our hands before which 
the men and women of the days of Jesus would have trembled with 



ELDER LEVI EDGAR YOUNG

fear. Yet ye are not living peaceably with ourselves nor with our 
neighbors, nor with nations. We live on sensation rather than on 
divine truth. Civilization has strewn the paths of progress with the 
spoils of science and the fruits of invention. Distance has been con- 
quered, bodily diseases are within our power to cure, humanity is 
crowned with the diadem of intellectual progress and material suc- 
cess, but parallel with all this growth, our hearts are swollen with 
pride, and we are not living buoyantly and serenely. I remember 
the healing word of a great physician who said one day to his in- 
valid child: "My child, the hand that sent you to earth will give 
you strength forever more." This is what Jesus meant by His other 
words when He said: "Father, into thy hands I commend my 
spirit." 

THE STRUGGLE BETWEEN THE SPIRITUAL AND MATERIAL 

The laws of the spiritual world and the laws of the material 
world are God's laws and are eternal. Spiritual laws are suffering 
at the hands of men. This is why darkness prevails and the dawn 
of the new day is delayed. We citizens of this great nation of the 
United States, have a mighty duty which we are forgetting. A duty 
that can only be carried out as we come into the knowledge of the 
Gospel of the Kingdom, which by His gracious and merciful word 
has again been given to man. The word must be carried to the ends 
of the earth, that it may be established in the hearts of men. We 
have three great visions of truth : First, the word of God given to 
Moses at Sinai : "I am the Lord thy God." Secondly, the voice of 
America proclaiming the liberty and equality of man; and third, the 
mightiest voice of all : "Because I live, ye shall also live." These 
are the messages that will save the world. 

Our duties are fraught with portentious responsibilities. This 
present life must be made richer by the men of nations, states, and 
churches. All peoples will have to enter into more unselfish relations 
with the peoples of the earth ; with the men and women with whom 
they live and serve. They will have to enter into richer relations 
with God, that the reign of righteousness, good-will, and brotherhood 
will declare once and for all "that never again shall they lift up the 
sword against nations, neither shall they learn war any more." 

CHRISTIANITY MUST BE VITAL TO MEET PROBLEMS 

The Church of which we are members has a divine message for 
the world, for it was founded by revelation and declares that God has 
spoken again. It declares that religion must affiliate itself with all 
the pursuits of mankind. The Holy Bible is resplendent with legis- 
lation in reference to land and wealth, and the Jewish Talmud de- 
velops in some detail the rights and privileges of all men who work, 
and all men should work. A living religion must grapple with living 
issues. While it is true that today, the social and economic problems 
are far more complicated than ever before in history, measures must 



102 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Saturday, April 6 Second Dag 

be designed by all Christian peoples to deal with our complex prob- 
lems. If Christianity is to recapture the vitality of creative religion, 
it must seek to follow in the footsteps of the path-finders of old. 
The Latter-day Saint Church is demonstrating- its concern with 
social problems and that is why we have our Priesthood and Auxil- 
iary organizations. Organized religion with us is playing a mighty 
part in bringing about social and economic reform. We shall not 
solve the problems for ages to come, but we may take courage from 
the words of an ancient sage, who declared : "Not thine to complete 
the work, neither art thou free to lay it down." 

RELIGION AND EDUCATION 

One of the largest factors for the proper teaching of the higher 
spiritual values of life should be our public schools and colleges. For 
our youth should participate in the religious life of the communities 
where they live. Religion should be the most constructive part of 
our culture, for that culture wherein religious idealism prevails, is a 
culture that loves beauty, truth, and goodness. The great souls who 
in 1776 won for us our independence and the right to have religious 
freedom were men and women who wanted to exercise that right. 
It is religion we want, but not secularism. The inhibitions written 
in our State laws are not against religious teaching, but against sec- 
tarian teaching. Religion and education cannot be separated. The 
minute education assumes an attitude that religion is for a special 
class of thinkers, then our schools miss that quality in human life 
that make for the happiness of mankind. We who advocate religious 
training, however, have missed the larger issue at times. We should 
not require credit for religious subjects, for we should think of 
something higher than marks. We should require something more 
fundamental and that is the truth that the school's responsibility 
should be to lay a foundation of religious principles, and this can 
only be done by the teachers consecrating their lives to the highest 
religious ideals of the Holy Bible. The consciences of teachers must 
be quickened and inspired with faith and courage to lift their voices 
against wrong and infidelity. This does not mean that teachers 
should adopt or accept any one rule of life or agree on any one con- 
cept of religious thoughts. "There is, however, within every soul 
a divine light, a divine impulse for good and truth, and when this 
light is developed, then life reaches its highest vision and man his 
greatest happiness," said the philosopher, Swedenborg. It is this 
light that must be made to glow in the souls of our children, for it is 
the light of God and immortality. Dr. James Conant, the President 
of Harvard College, has recently written in his report to the Board 
of Overseers, "Our Puritan ancestors thought of education and the- 
ology as inseparably connected. It is hard for us to recapture their 
point of view." 

It is religion that man needs, for when all the ideals of culture 
find their inspiration and nourishment in the divine ideals of Jesus

Christ, and take their place in the great living purpose of the world's 
Savior ; when thought and art and literature and knowledge and life 
are brought into subjection, to the obedience of Christ, then man- 
kind shall have attained the true victory, and will say : "Thou hast 
conquered, O Galilean." 

a writer's prayer 

May we turn in solemn worship and adoration of Him who died 
that we might live. May the Easter spirit of a few days ago remain 
with us to lead us to greater heights; may we keep in mind the 
lovely words of John Drinkwater who wrote just before he died : 

MY PRAYER 

We know the paths wherein our feet should press, 
Across our hearts are written Thy decrees 
Yet now, O Lord, be merciful to bless 
with more than these. 

Grant us the will to fashion as we feel, 
Grant us the strength to labor as we know, 
Grant us the purpose, ribbed and edged with steel, 
to strike the blow. 

Knowledge we ask not — knowledge Thou has lent, 
But Lord, the will — there lies our bitter need. 
Give us to build above the deep intent 
the deed, the deed. 

* * * 

God help us to walk through this world, now opened to us as 
through a Kingdom, with uplifted hearts and larger faith to the life 
more glorious, I ask in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

ELDER FRANKLIN J. MURDOCK 

Former President of the Netherlands Mission 

I rejoice with you, brethren and sisters, in being here in attend- 
ance at this great Conference of our Church. I have found comfort 
in these words : 

If we work upon marble it will perish; 
If we work upon brass, time will efface it ; 
If we rear temples they will crumble into dust ; 
But if we work upon immortal souls, 

If we imbue them with principles, with a just fear of the Creator, 

a love of fellow men, 
We engrave on those tablets something which will brighten all eternity. 

This seems to me to be the ideal of our great missionary system, 
and for the past two and a half years it has been my privilege and 
pleasure to work as a missionary in Holland. It is a beautiful little 
country, just one-seventh the size of the State of Utah, and has a 
population sixteen times that which we have here. We have ap- 



104 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Saturday, April 6 Second Day 

proximately three thousand members of the Church in Holland. 
All of our Branches are officered by capable, local people. Our Aux- 
iliary boards are organized, and the work of our Heavenly Father 
is making good progress there. 

Lesson material was prepared for a year in advance. They are 
preparing now for their Spring Conferences, and from a letter which 
I received last week, I learn that during the month of March they 
baptized ten new converts into the Church. Their Fast offerings and 
tithes are showing a slight increase. I have no fear that the Gospel 
and the members of the Church will go forward together in the land 
of dikes and windmills. 

I shall never forget the words of President McKay as he set us 
apart for our Mission. He said : "President Murdock, your first 
concern is your missionaries." And how true that was ! 

I want to take this opportunity, my brethren and sisters, to 
thank you personally for the boys and girls you sent to the Dutch 
Mission. They are even better than the other Missions which we 
have heard from. (Laughter). To see those young men come from 
all walks of life, the farm, the mine, the factory, the banks, and the 
schools, inexperienced, not knowing one word of that foreign tongue ; 
to see them come into the Mission office for the first time, assign 
them, get acquainted with them, and after a short period of time, 
a month perhaps, go and attend a testimony meeting with them ; to 
sleep with them and pray with them, and Fast with them, and to 
see the development which they receive under the guidance of our 
Heavenly Father, was a marvel to me. It gave me a testimony of 
the truth and divinity of this work. Young men do not go seven 
thousand miles away from their loved ones ; they do not put up with 
every kind of sacrifice that is necessary to perform missionary labor ; 
they do not meet with all kinds of hardships, unless it is in God's 
work. 

I think the remarkable thing about our missionary system is 
that all of these boys and girls, coming together from all over the 
Church, meet together and learn to know and love one another and 
work as a great unit, preaching the Gospel. These young men travel 
all day and come to their journey's end at night and then climb into 
bed with a boy that they have never met before in their lives, and 
wake up in the morning and call each other brother, and are willing 
to endure all kinds of hardships. These things give me an assurance 
that this is God's work and not man's. 

I shall never forget one experience. One of our young men was 
taken to the hospital. It was necessary to operate upon him for 
appendicitis, and as the great surgeon was scrubbing his hands, 
making all preparations for the operation, he called me to one side 
and said: "President Murdock, what is there about these young 
men? I have never before in my life seen such clean blood, such 
clean flesh as you have here in this young man." And then, in a few 



PRESIDENT J. REUBEN CLARK, JR. 



105 



minutes, my brethren and sisters, it was my rare privilege to present 
the principles of the Gospel to this great and famous surgeon. 

The last days of the closing of the Mission he came to my office 
and said : "There is something divine about Mormonism, and I am 
ready to investigate it because you have something that I have not 
found in any other group of people in all the world." 

To keep the young men and young women in our Church clean 
is the greatest work that we can be engaged in. That is the way we 
can brighten all eternity. 

I want to bear witness to the great and wonderful work that 
was done by our beloved President Grant in his visit with us ; to the 
great leadership of President and Sister Richard R. Lyman ; and in 
the crisis which overtook us last fall, in the guiding hands of Apostle 
and Sister Joseph Fielding Smith. To have these leaders in our 
Mission was a great stimulation to the work. I shall never forget 
the closing scenes of our missionary life. As our boat was sailing 
away, those humble people gathered on the shore and sang in 
unison : 

We thank Thee for sending the Gospel 
To lighten our minds with its rays. 

And with tear-stained faces as they left the shore and our boat 
went down the harbor, I could hear the strains of 

Come, come, ye Saints, 
No toil nor labor fear, 
But with joy wend your way. 

That great and brave people, the Dutch people, are a wonderful 
people, and they will carry on ; I have no doubt of that. 

Coming back home, I realize more than ever before the value 
of this great land and the Gospel which we have accepted, and as 
my closing thought let me leave this with you : 

To appreciate our heritage, 
The will and power to make our destiny, 
To seek, to choose, to cherish, and to work, 
The right to worship how and where we please, 

God gave that. 
Let us not shirk the task, the joy 
Of carrying on this creed 
To those whose strength 
Must serve tomorrow's need. 

That we may always be missionaries wherever we are, I 
humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

PRESIDENT J. REUBEN CLARK, JR. 

First Counselor in the First Presidency 

We wish to thank this wonderful choir from Ricks College. 
Their singing is beautiful, and behind it is a spirit and a spirituality 
which I find nowhere else than among our people in their songs. 
May God bless them in their labors. 



106 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Sunday, April 7 Third Day 

The Ricks College Choir sang the "Hallelujah" anthem from 
the "Messiah," (Handel). 

Elder Claudius Bowman, President of the Juarez Stake, of- 
fered the closing prayer. 

Conference adjourned until Sunday morning, April 7, at 10 
o'clock. 

THIRD DAY 
MORNING MEETING 

The fifth session of the Conference was held in the Tabernacle 
Sunday morning, April 7 at 10 o'clock. 

Almost an hour in advance of the time to begin this meeting, 
the great Tabernacle was crowded to capacity with people who had 
assembled from the various Stakes and Missions of the Church. 
The large Assembly Hall immediately south of the Tabernacle was 
also fully occupied with people, and thousands in addition assembled 
on the Tabernacle grounds. Those who had come together in the 
Assembly Hall, and also those on the Tabernacle grounds, listened 
to the Conference proceedings, by means of amplifiers that had 
been installed, as they were broadcast from the Tabernacle. 

The music for this session of the Conference was furnished by 
the Tabernacle Choir, J. Spencer Cornwall, Director. Dr. Frank 
W. Asper was at the organ console. 

PRESIDENT J. REUBEN CLARK, JR. 

First Counselor in the First Presidency 

My brethren and sisters : It becomes increasingly apparent that 
we need larger quarters for our General Conferences. An hour be- 
fore the time of commencement this building was filled to capacity. 
I am sure there is the traditional ten thousand people here this morn- 
ing. I hope that all will remain as quiet as possible so that everyone 
may hear. 

President Grant is "listening in" this morning. 



The congregation and the Tabernacle Choir sang the hymn, 
"Praise to the Man who Communed with Jehovah." 

Elder S. Taylor Farnsworth, President of the Beaver Stake, 
offered the opening prayer. 



ELDER JOSEPH L. WIRTHLIN

ELDER JOSEPH L. WIRTHLIN 

Second Counselor in the Presiding Bishopric 

I sincerely trust, my brethren and sisters, that the Lord will 
bless me with a generous portion of His Holy Spirit during the 
moment or two I stand before you this morning. 

I would that every member of this great congregation could 
have had the opportunity of attending the General Welfare meeting 
held yesterday morning and had visualized in picture, graph, and 
statistics the splendid achievements of this great movement and its 
possibilities for the future. 

CHURCH WELFARE PROGRAM OF A PERMANENT NATURE 

Some of us are inclined to believe that the Church Welfare 
program is of a temporary nature, but I do not hesitate in declaring 
that the future will hold a greater need for it than there has been in 
the past. In analyzing conditions in our great nation today, it is 
obvious that the matter of relief and unemployment is a local prob- 
lem and sooner or later the Federal Government will turn it back to 
states, counties, cities, communities, and churches for solution. 

The situation is clear. The Federal Government has before it 
two issues : first, as to whether or not it is able to carry the relief 
burden, or is the Federal income adequate to cover the huge expendi- 
tures of the past, present, and future. The present condition of the 
National Treasury indicates that disbursements are far in excess of 
receipts, which brings back to mind the truth expressed by President 
Clark, wherein he declared that no individual, nor private enterprise, 
nor even government can long exist on a sound financial basis when 
disbursements are greater than receipts. This local problem of relief 
which has and is being expanded into tremendous proportions by 
government agencies will come back to local units of government 
where it rightly belongs, or the nation faces bankruptcy. 

Secondly, the Federal Government in turning the problem of 
relief back to states, counties, cities, communities, and churches 
should set in motion through these local units preparation for the 
caring of those in distress. Where preparation is being made to 
meet this problem, there will be but little difficulty. But where no 
preparation has been made, suffering, difficulties, and bloodshed are 
not remote possibilities. 

STOREHOUSES TO BE BUILT 

The Welfare Program is not the child of any individual's brain, 
but comes to us from our Heavenly Father. Your attention is direct- 
ed to a revelation given to the Prophet Joseph Smith in the year 
1832, as recorded in the 78th section of the Doctrine and Covenants, 
verse 3 : 

For verily I say unto you, the time has come and is now at hand ; 
and behold, and lo, it must needs be that there be an organization of 



108 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Sunday, April 7 Third Day 

my people, in regulating and establishing the affairs of the storehouse 
for the poor of my people, both in this place and in the land of Zion. 

In this revelation there are indicated to us two important points, 
probably three. First, these storehouses are to be regulated and 
established by an organization of the Lord's people. Secondly, a 
storehouse was to be set up in "this" place. What place? The place 
where the Saints were residing in 1832 — in and about Kirtland, Ohio. 
Third, the Lord said to the Prophet Joseph, "and in the land of 
Zion." 

In the wisdom of the Lord and through the power of inspiration, 
the Presidency of the Church some four years ago instituted this 
plan in greater measure than before. As a result, there have been 
established in the land of Zion storehouses under the direction and 
regulation of an organization of the Lord's people. These store- 
houses are found in Canada, the Northwest, California, and in every 
Stake of the Church. This impresses us with the fact that this is 
not a new plan, but rather the first one revealed to us through the 
instrumentality of the Prophet Joseph Smith. This is one of the 
Lord's ways of taking care of his people in distress. 



PRAISE FOR WELFARE WORKERS 

As one phase of this organization there has recently been organ- 
ized in the Church the General Welfare Committee, who under 
mandate of the First Presidency have been and are establishing the 
Church Welfare Program of the Church. The efforts of this group 
of men are of the highest order. This Committee is composed of 
men from the various walks and vocations of life ; some of them are 
professional men, others business men, others educators. For the 
past four years they have given most generously of their time and 
talents in the attempt to establish in every Ward, Stake, and Region 
of the Church the Lord's way of caring for His distressed people. 

It is literally a day of preparation, and the members of the 
General Welfare Committee are exerting every effort to emphasize 
the necessity of being fully prepared in Priesthood quorums, Wards, 
Stakes, and Regions in order that this plan shall operate most effici- 
ently in solving the problems of relief and unemployment. 

Another great organization stands out in bold relief in connec- 
tion with this movement, namely the Relief Society organization, 
which has contributed willingly, freely, and generously of its time 
and resources to the program. If it had not been for the Relief So- 
ciety organization, in some Stakes the Welfare program would have 
made but little progress. 

INDIVIDUAL RESPONSIBILITY 

This plan anticipates not only that men and women shall be 
rehabilitated in their temporal affairs, but that there shall be a reju- 
venation and rehabilitation in their attitude towards God, towards 
their Government, and towards work. 



ELDER JOSEPH L. WIRTHLIN 



109 



The past experiences of a great many charitable institutions and 
organizations prove, where assistance has been given without plac- 
ing any requirements or obligation upon the recipients, it has brought 
about a condition of demoralization, disrespect for government, and 
the attitude that the world owes man a living without any mental 
or physical exertion on his part. In such instances, when relief 
is taken away, such individuals are not able through desire or train- 
ing to take care of themselves. The Church Welfare Program solves 
the problem of demoralization by placing on every individual the 
responsibility of contributing of his time and talents on some worth- 
while project that there may be instilled in his mind and heart the 
thought that what he has received is his, by right of having earned it. 
The Lord has placed this obligation on all. He said, "Thou shalt not 
be idle, for he that is idle shall not eat the bread nor wear the gar- 
ments of the laborer." This is the essence and battle-cry of this great 
program of rehabilitation and preparation against the day of need, 
which will surely come. 

On the other hand, those of us who are not particularly affected 
by the conditions of the times temporally have a most definite 
responsibility in that we should be susceptible to the lessons of this 
great program : First, the lesson of thrift, wherein through the prac- 
tice of conservative and careful principles, we shall safeguard our 
private resources against days of future need and depression. 

THE FAST OFFERING PLAN 

The matter of financing this great program rests squarely upon 
the shoulders of members of the Church. The means and ways of 
such financing come from divine sources, for the Lord has indicated 
His desires relative to taking care of those who are in need. The 
Lord's method of financing the Church Welfare Program is the 
Fast Offering Plan, which has already been mentioned by Elder 
George F. Richards and Elder Joseph Fielding Smith of the Council 
of the Twelve. This is a plan pregnant with enriching blessings for 
those who observe it, the most equitable and orderly system ever 
given to man whereby individuals contribute according to their 
resources : To abstain from two meals on the first Sunday of each 
month, the equivalent in cash or commodities to be presented to the 
Bishop in order that there might be provisions in the storehouse of 
the Lord for any who might be hungry or cold. This plan provides 
a blessing for the donor. It is a physical sacrifice for the receiving 
of a spiritual blessing. It places the body under subjection to the will 
of the Lord, establishes closer relationship between man and the 
Holy Ghost, which assures a high degree of spirituality, a blessing 
so much needed in the world today. It creates a prayerful attitude 
and provides an opportunity, as Paul declared, for the practice of 
pure and undefiled religion, in visiting the fatherless and the widows, 
and keeping themselves unspotted from the sins of the world. By far 
the greatest spiritual blessing derived from the observance of this 
plan is the gift of testimony. No greater privilege is offered to the 



110 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Sunday, April 7 Third Day 

membership of this Church than the one afforded the first Sunday of 
each month to contribute of our resources to those who are in dis- 
tress, to pray and fast, and to bear testimony of the goodness of the 
Lord unto us. 

The spirit of testimony is the power of the Holy Ghost. Any 
individual who rises to his feet and declares that he knows that God 
lives, that Jesus is the Christ, and that Joseph Smith is a Prophet, 
does so under the power and influence of the Holy Ghost. Brigham 
Young declared that no man could testify that Jesus was the Christ 
only by and through the power of the Holy Ghost. 

The temporal side of the Fast offering plan is so practical, equit- 
able, and just that it places no undue burden on any individual be 
he rich or poor. It is interesting to note that the Fast offering per 
capita for the Church in 1925 was 22 cents. In 1939 it reached the all high 
of 82 cents. Remarkable progress has been made. But an analysis of the 
observance of the Fast offering plan proves we have hardly scratched 
the great field of possibilities in the Fast offering plan. 

Considering the Fast offering per capita of 1938 based on ab- 
staining from 24 meals a year gives us a meal cost of 3j^ cents. It 
is obvious that no meal can be served for 3^2 cents which contains a 
balanced and adequate diet. The United States army meal cost for 
this area averages from 13 cents to 17 cents per meal. The quartermaster 
department of the United States army is a careful buyer. It buys the 
best. It buys as closely as it can, and yet meal costs average from 
13 cents to 17 cents. 

One of the largest hospitals in Salt Lake City serves fifteen 
hundred meals daily, or forty-five thousand per month at an average 
cost of 20 cents per meal. It is safe to assume that the average family meal 
should cost at least 15 cents. This cost does not pertain to the Church as 
a whole, as there are families where meal costs run from 30 cents to 40 
cents. But for the sake of comparison, we may use a meal cost of 15 cents. 
If we abstained from two meals monthly at the rate of 15 cents per meal, 
this would make a per capita of 30 cents per month, or $3.60 per year, 
approximately four and one-half times as much as was contributed 
in 1939. Supposing the entire membership of the Church were to 
fully observe the Fast offering plan as revealed to us by the Lord, 
abstaining from two meals per month, there would be available 
annually a Fast offering sum of $2,880,000. On the other hand, may 
we assume that only 500,000 members of the Church observe the 
Fast offering plan, based on the cost of 15 cents per meal, two meals each 
month or, a per capita of $3.60 per year, this would provide an annual 
fund of $1,800,000. With this amount available in the Wards, Stakes, 
and Regions of the Church, the Welfare Program would go forward 
by leaps and bounds. In addition thereto, many more new work 
projects would be inaugurated. It would be possible to assist in the 
establishment of industries which would utilize the dormant re-^ 
sources of this state and bring into gainful employment hundreds, 
of our brothers and sisters, 



ELDER JOSEPH L. WIRTHLIN 



111 



Aside from all of the possibilities of providing adequate relief and 
employment for our people, the finest opportunity provided for the 
Church is that of leadership in a world floundering and gradually 
burying itself in the sea of distress, poor leadership, and destruction. 

LOVE FOR GOD SHOWN BY SERVICE 

We declare a love for God with all our hearts, minds, and souls. 
We know definitely that in our hearts a love for neighbors should 
exist, but love of God is only genuine, heartfelt, and real when 
actual service is rendered to our Father's children, our neighbors. 
The Apostle John declared : "He that loveth not, knoweth not God, 
for God is love. If a man saith he loves me and hateth his brother, 
he. is a liar, for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, 
how can he love God whom he hath not seen?" 

God's revealed plan for the caring of the unfortunate neither 
bankrupts nations, states, communities, churches nor individuals, but 
builds them up in faith and service to mankind. Love for God and 
love for neighbor will hasten the day when the King of kings shall 
rule and all men shall be equal. 

In the 78th Section of the Doctrine and Covenants, the Lord 
again declares to us through the Prophet Joseph Smith : 

That you may be equal in the bonds of heavenly things, yea, and 
earthly things also, for the obtaining of heavenly things. 

For if ye are not equal in earthly things ye cannot be equal in 
obtaining heavenly things ; 

For if ye will that I give unto you a place in the celestial world, 
you must prepare yourselves by doing the things which I have com- 
manded you and required of you. 

True it is that the Lord has required baptism of us, work for the 
dead and all other ordinances and principles of the Gospel of Jesus 
Christ; but He requires above all else that we shall love Him and 
love His children, our neighbors, by rendering a service which will 
provide temporal and spiritual rehabilitation. 

THE WORDS OF THE SAVIOR 

May God bless and so strengthen us that when the day of ac 
counting comes, each one of us may stand before a resurrected 
Savior to give an account of our stewardship ; and may He say unto 
us, "For I was an hungered and ye gave me meat ; I was thirsty and 
ye gave me drink; I was a stranger, and ye took me in; naked and 
ye clothed me ; I was sick and ye visited me ; I was in prison, and ye 
came unto me. Then shall the righteous answer him saying, 'Lord 
when saw we Thee an hungered and took Thee in, or naked and 
clothed Thee; or when saw we Thee sick or in prison and came 
unto Thee?' And then shall the King answer and say unto them, 
'Verily, I say unto you, inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of 
the least of these, my .brethren, ye have done it unto me.' " 

May the Lord bles"s us, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.

Cornwall. Organ accompaniments and Organ solo presentations 
were played by Frank W. Asper. The spoken word was by Richard L. 
Evans. 



PRESIDENT J. REUBEN CLARK, JR. 

First Counselor in ihe First Presidency 

President Grant is "listening in" this morning, and we wish to 
assure him that this comes to him with the loyalty, trust, faith, 
confidence, and love of the whole Church. 



The Choir and congregation sang the hymn, "We Thank Thee, 
O God, for a Prophet." 

PRESIDENT DAVID O. McKAY 

Second Counselor in the First Presidency 
My brethren and sisters : 

APPRECIATION FOR BLESSINGS 

There are few, if any persons in this congregation who are more truly 
appreciative than I of the privilege of attending this Conference. Until 
just recently it was doubtful whether I should be able to do so. This morn- 
ing I stand before you practically a well man. I thank you, my brethren 
and sisters, and many friends, for your thoughtful solicitations, your 
faith and prayers. 

I am deeply grateful this morning for President Grant's remarkable 
improvement in health, I was with him when he went from the California 



PRESIDENT DAVID 0. McKAY 



113 



Mission Home to the St. Vincent's Hospital February 5, and thereafter 
for ten days or more visited him almost daily. I met in council with him 
and President Oark March 23 and noted how greatly he had improved. 
Truly, the Lord has answered the prayers offered in his behalf. He is 
a great and inspired leader ; and most earnestly we pray for the prolonga- 
tion of his life, and his enjoyment of health and happiness. 

I have been made happy by the messages given by the General Au- 
thorities and the Mission Presidents. 

With you I rejoiced in the excellent singing of choral groups of 
young people from the Brigham Young University and the Ricks College. 
I am thankful that we have these Church schools. I know their power 
for good. 

The service rendered each week by the officers and members of the 
Tabernacle Choir is to the Church and the nation what the glorious sun- 
shine this morning is to the world — it gives joy and peace to a million 
hearts. 

INCREASE OF ACTIVITY IN THE CHURCH 

It is a source of true satisfaction to note the evidences of increased 
activity throughout the Church — in Priesthood quorums ; in Auxiliary 
associations ; in the Church Welfare Plan ; in missionary work at home 
and in the field ; in better Ward teaching ; in Temple work ; in the large 
number of young people who are participating in Church duties, and who 
thereby are becoming anchored in the Truth, for it is an evidence of the 
truth of this work that the more service you render the happier you are. 
"If ye do, ye shall know" is axiomatic as it pertains to the Gospel. 

Brethren and sisters, God bless every one of you for your integrity 
and devotion to the work of the Lord ! It is an honor and a continual joy 
to be associated with you in the Church of Jesus Christ. 

In my message to you this morning I wish to acknowledge God's 
kindness and mercy to His children everywhere, and to express my abid- 
ing faith in the ultimate triumph of the Gospel, and of the final victory 
of Right over Wrong. 

EVILS OF WAR 

Believing this, I am not blind to the fact that in the attitude of man- 
kind generally, Truth seems to be "Forever on the scaffold, Wrong for- 
ever on the throne.'" 

The world is truly in turmoil, and there are those who fear modern 
civilization is dangerously near destruction. The fact is that since history 
began strife, wickedness, and war have existed among human beings, 
who it seems are too selfish and ambitious to learn what is best for them. 
As indicative of the slow progress of the world in regard especially to 
the evil of war listen to these extracts taken from accounts of conquests 
in widely separated eras : 

Shrieks and wailing, and every other species of outcry that comes 
from grief, terror, and despair arose from within (the palace) ; and such 
spectators as had the heart to look continuously upon the spectacle, could 




GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Third Day 



see wretched men running to and fro, and virgins clinging to altars for 
protection, and frantic mothers vainly endeavoring to find hiding places 
for themselves and their helpless children. 

That is quoted from a description of the destruction of a city 1200 
years before the Christian Era. 
Now listen to this : 

Bodies are not pleasant sights under any circumstances. When they 
are of young women, torn to pieces by bombs, sometimes without heads 
or arms or legs, they are horrible to behold. This was sheer horror. 

Conquered men in the ruined city were executed. Men and women 
were driven to the public squares to watch the executions. 

That is taken from accounts of eye-witnesses of the bombing of a city 
in September in the year of our Lord 1939! 

Manifestly, there has not been much cessation of man's "inhumanity 
to man" in 3,000 years ! Notwithstanding this, I believe that Right and 
Truth will eventually triumph. 



Today as we behold nations grasping at one another's throats, the 
strong crushing the weak, we are prone to think that righteousness among 
nations is waning. In our own country, we know that the struggle is still 
rife between capital and labor ; that enemies to our democratic institu- 
tions are becoming more blatant ; we see political demagogues more seem- 
ingly successful, drunkenness and immorality still flauntingly defiant ; and 
we wonder whether mankind is growing better or worse, in private life 
unemployment, disappointments, adversity, sickness, and sorrow make us 
discouraged and sometimes despondent. 

Still I am confident that Truth will yet prevail, and in that confidence 
say with the Psalmist : 

Be of good courage, and He shall strengthen your heart, all ye that 
hope in the Lord. 

We may take courage in what I believe is a fact, that in the hearts of 
more millions of honest men and women than ever before in the history 
of the world, war is abhorrent. War has lost its false glamour and boasted 
glory. Such an attitude at least keeps alive our hope for the dawning of 
that day when men "shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their 
spears into pruninghooks. Nation shall not lift up sword against nation, 
neither shall they learn war any more." (Isaiah 2:4) 



How utterly foolish men are to quarrel, fight, and cause misery, 
destruction, and death when the gifts of a divine and loving Father are 
all around us for the asking — are already in our possession if we would 
but recognize them. Christ's invitation is still extended to all peoples : 



COURAGE NEEDED AMIDST CONFLICT 



PEACE THROUGH JESUS CHRIST 



Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give 
you rest. 



PRESIDENT DAVID 0. McKAY 



115 



Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly 
in heart; and ye shall find lest unlo your souls. 

For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light. (Matthew 11 :28, 30.) 

I am as sure as that I am speaking to you that the peace and happiness 
of mankind lie in the acceptance of Jesus Christ as Redeemer and Savior. 
As Peter declared 1900 years ago, so I testify to the world today that 
there is "none other name under heaven given among men whereby we 
must be saved." 

The principles of the Gospel are the surest, safest guide to mortal 
man. Christ is the light to humanity. In that light man sees his way 
clearly. When it is rejected, the soul of man stumbles in darkness. No 
person, no group, no nation can achieve true success without following 
Him who said : 

I am the light of the world ; he that f olloweth me shall not walk in 
darkness, but shall have the light of life. (John 8:12.) 

It is a sad thing when individuals and nations extinguish that light — 
when Christ and His Gospel are supplanted by the law of the jungle and 
the strength of the sword. The chief tragedy in the world at the present 
time is its disbelief in God's goodness, and its lack of faith in the teach- 
ings and doctrines of the Gospel. 

To all who believe in a living, personal God and His divine Truth, 
life can be so delightful and beautiful. 

THE BLESSING OF LIFE 

As a matter of fact, it's glorious just to be alive. Joy, even ecstasy, 
can be experienced in the consciousness of existence. There is supreme 
satisfaction in sensing one's individual entity, and in realizing that that 
entity is part of God's great creative plan. There are none so poor, none 
so rich, sick or maimed who may not be conscious of this relationship. 

I know that for not a few of us the true joy of living is overcast by 
trials, failures, worries, and perplexities incident to making a living and 
attempting to achieve success. Tear-bedimmed eyes are often blind to 
the beauties that surround us. Life sometimes seems a parched and bar- 
ren desert, when, as a matter of fact, there is comfort even happiness 
within our grasp if we could or would but reach for it. 

It is possible for us to learn with Stanton that— 

This world o' God's is brighter than 

We ever dream or know ; 
Its burdens' growin' lighter — 

An' it's love that makes 'em so ! 
An' I'm thankful that I'm livin' 

Where love's blessedness I see, 
'Neath a Heaven that's forgivin' 

Where the bells ring 'Home' to me ! 

The Lord has given us life, and eternal life is His greatest gift to 

nian. 



116 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Sunday. April 7 Third Day 



THE BLESSINGS OF FELLOWSHIP 

Among life's sweetest blessings is fellowship with men and women 
whose ideals and aspirations are high and noble. Next to a sense of a 
kinship with God comes the helpfulness, encouragement, and inspiration 
of friends. Friendship is a sacred possession. As air, water and sunshine 
to flowers, trees, and verdure, so smiles, sympathy and love of friends 
to the daily life of man. "To live, laugh, love one's friends, and be loved 
by them is to bask in the sunshine of life." One of the principal reasons 
which the Lord had for establishing His Church is to give all persons high 
and low, rich and poor, strong and feeble an opportunity to associate 
with their fellowmen in an atmosphere of uplifting, religious fellowship. 
This may be found in Priesthood quorums, Auxiliaries, Sacrament 
meetings. He who neglects these opportunities, who fails to take advan- 
tage of them, to that extent starves his own soul. Who among you who 
were numbered among the more than 9,000 in attendance at the General 
Priesthood meeting last night did not thrill in the realization of your being 
one in that great brotherhood of Christ. To what spiritual heights true 
fellowship may lift us may be glimpsed by John the Beloved's ecstatic 
remark: "I know that I have passed from death unto life, because I 
love the brethren." 

FREE AGENCY A GIFT FROM GOD 

But the gift which I desire more particularly to call to your attention 
this morning is a principle of the Gospel too seldom emphasized, but 
which is a blessing co-existent with man's creation. I refer to the funda- 
mental principle of the Gospel, Free Agency. References in the Scrip- 
tures show that this principle is (1) essential to man's salvation; and, 
(2) may become a measuring rod by which the actions of men, of organi- 
zations, of nations may be judged. 

Therefore, cheer up your hearts, and remember that ye are free to 
act for yourselves — to choose the way of everlasting death or the way of 
eternal life. (II Nephi 10:23.) 

For the earth is full, and there is enough and to spare; yea, I pre- 
pared all things, and have given unto the children of men to be agents 
unto themselves. (Doctrine and Covenants 104:17.) 

Behold, here is the agency of man, and here is the condemnation of 
man; because that which was from the beginning is plainly manifest unto 
them, and they receive not the light. (Doctrine and Covenants 93:31.) 

Therefore it is not right that any man should be in bondage one to 
another. And for this purpose have I established the Constitution of this 
land, by the hands of wise men whom I raised up unto this very purpose, 
and redeemed the land by the shedding of blood. (Doctrine and Covenants 
101 :79, 80.) 

Again : 

My independence is sacred to me— it is a portion of that same Deity 
that rules in the Heavens. There is not a being upon the face of the 
earth who is made in the image of God, who stands erect and is organ- 
ized as God is, that should be deprived of the free exercise of his agency 
so far as he does not infringe upon others' rights, save by good advice 
and a good example. (Brigham Young.) 



PRESIDENT DAVID 0. McKAY

It is true that faith is an essential principle in all progress, not spirit- 
ual progress only, but to all progress. But next to faith as an essential 
to man's advancement is Free Agency. 

The history of the world with all its contention and strife is largely 
an account of man's effort to free himself from bondage and usurpation, 
or to protect himself in the freedom he possessed. 

DANGERS SEEN IN CERTAIN TYPES OF GOVERNMENT 

In the light of the principle of Free Agency, it is not difficult to dis- 
tinguish between the right and the wrong system of government. It is 
not difficult to tell when an organization transcends its bounds, and be- 
comes despotic. How the people's rights may be curtailed by legislation 
here in the United States is emphasized in a timely editorial printed in the 
March 15th issue of the Los Angeles Times under the caption "The 
March of Absolutism." 

"Absolutism in politics," it says: 

May be defined as "a system of government in which public power is 
vested in some person or persons, unchecked and uncontrolled by any 
law, institution, constitutional device or coordinate body." The American 
system, on the other hand, insists on the separation of powers, legislative, 
executive, and judicial, and the freedom of the individual. It demands and 
maintains the supremacy of the law. This means that what is done 
officially must conform to law, exactly as much as what is done un- 
officially by private individuals. 

The administrative commission is a radical departure from the 
American system. It measurably and sometimes wholly consolidates the 
three separate powers of government and clothes its metabers with un- 
controlled power to hear, to adjudicate, and to punish. In other words, 
it makes us subject to "some person or persons" who are free to act without 
the restraint of any law, guided solely by their own discretion. No one 
who has had any experience with an administrative commission will 
challenge this. 

What else do we find in the totalitarian governments of Europe? 
There, it is simply the placing of this power in the hands of one man, a 
Hitler or a Stalin, the area of whose government is practically unlimited. 
The limitation of the area within which a given commission operates does 
not change the power ; it is, within the designated limits, despotic, that is, 
absolute. Recent Federal labor practice forbids the employer's resort to 
the courts until a commission has determined the matter, and the dis- 
position of the authorities is to be chary of any review by the courts. 
Under some circumstances the employer is even denied access to the 
board; he must stand aside, his business tied up, until one of the con- 
tending labor organizations invokes the board's action. 

In the courts, like all other litigants, employer and employee are 
treated as equals. If either has infringed the rights of the other, the 
wronged is entitled to reparation, to be placed as near as may be in the 
position he had before the injury. The administrative commission is a 
departure from this in both principle and practice. It attempts the ap- 
praisal of what it calls social values, exalts the claims and values of labor 
above business and sets the interests of the labor organization above the 
interests of the individual workingman. It is a complete abandonment 
of the Anglo-American legal tradition. 



118 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Sunday, April 7 Third Dag 

FREEDOM A GLORIOUS PRIVILEGE 

To live in a land in which each individual has the right to life and 
liberty is a glorious privilege. 

If any man in this country prefers a government ruled by a dictator, 
he should go where the dictator rules ; but here in the United States of 
America the people believe in a government as Abraham Lincoln declared, 
"of the people, by the people, and for the people." 

It is well ever to keep in mind the fact that the State exists for the in- 
dividual ; not the individual for the State. Jesus sought to perfect society 
by perfecting the individual, and only by the exercising of Free Agency 
can the individual even approach perfection. 

Man's Free Agency is an eternal principle of progress, and any form 
of government that curtails or inhibits its free exercise is wrong — Satan's 
plan in the beginning was one of coercion, and it was rejected, because 
he sought to destroy the agency of man which God had given him. 

When a man uses this God-given right to encroach upon the rights 
of another, he commits a wrong. Liberty becomes license, and the man 
a transgressor. It is the function of the State to curtail the violator, and 
to protect the violated. 

A WARNING TO LATTER-DAY SAINTS 

Latter-day Saints should avoid affiliation with any committee, any 
group, any union that would, through coercion or force, deprive a person 
of the free exercise of his or her freedom of choice. It is understood, 
of course, that any person is free to join a union, when to do so favors 
his best interests ; but no one should be compelled to join, or be deprived 
of any right as a citizen, including the right to honest labor, if he chooses 
not to become a member of a union or specially organized group. 

FAITH IN GOD BRINGS PEACE 

Yes, we are living in turbulent times, the most distressing phase of 
which is the rejection of Christ by the leaders and dictators of some Euro- 
pean nations. But if you have faith in God you must believe as David 
Starr Jordan has aptly said, "in the final inevitable triumph of Truth," 
and I bear witness to the world in all sincerity that the Gospel of Jesus 
Christ as restored to the Prophet Joseph Smith is true and embraces all 
Truth. Paraphrasing the author just quoted, keep the principles of the 
Gospel as your guide, your companion, your ally and inspiration, and you 
will tingle with the consciousness of your kinship with the Infinite, and 
all petty trials, sorrows, and sufferings of life will fade away as temporary 
harmless visions seen in a dream. 

My God give us courage to choose the right, ability to appreciate 
the good things of life, and power faithfully to serve Him and our fellow- 
men, I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen. 



ELDER REED SMOOT 



119 



ELDER REED SMOOT 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

I have been wondering whether I have ever attended a Confer- 
ence when the influence of the Spirit of God has been made so mani- 
fest as at this gathering. 

THE POWER OF THE PRIESTHOOD 

This is a wonderful Church, and as the years go by that truth 
will be known better in all parts of this world. At the wonderful 
Priesthood meeting held in this building, with nearly every seat 
filled, I thought to myself, what a marvelous power! With thaft: 
power directed by our Heavenly Father Himself, this Church will not 
only grow in numbers, but will grow in influence among the people 
of the world. 

CHARITY A CHRISTIAN VIRTUE 

Charity- — we believe in that grand principle, and not only 
believe in it but manifest our belief in action in the many ways pro- 
vided for by the Gospel. Charity has been a great problem that 
every dispensation has had to meet in some way. God has pro- 
vided the way, and this people, the members of the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints, are living closer to that law, I am quite 
sure, than any other people in the world. Charity of the proper 
kind and spirit is an essential virtue in all Christian living. 

QUOTATIONS FROM SCRIPTURE 

In Corinthians, chapter thirteen, I find these words : 

Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have 
not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal. 

And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all 
mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I 
could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing. * * * 

And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest 
of these is charity. 

Let all our things be done with charity. 

Charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not; charity 
vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up. 

Doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily 
provoked, thinketh no evil. 

Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth; 

Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth 
all things. 

I find in the third chapter of Colossians it says : 

Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man 
have a quarrel against any; even as Christ forgave you, so also do ye. 

And above all these things put on charity, which is the bond of 
perfectness. 



120 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Sunday, April 7 Third Day 

And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to the which also 
ye are called in one body; and be ye thankful. 

Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching 
and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual 
songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord. 

And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the 
Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him. 

The psalm of David asks : 

Lord, who shall abide in thy tabernacle? Who shall dwell in 
thy holy hill?" 

The answer was : 

He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness, and speak- 
eth the truth in his heart. 

He that backbiteth not with his tongue, nor doeth evil to his 
neighbor, nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbor. 

Lack of charity might be blamed for much that is wrong in the 
world today, for if all the people were tolerant of the faults and weak- 
nesses of others, and would approach them with charity and love in 
their hearts, it would be much easier to solve the problems con- 
fronting this old world of ours today, and which are threatening our 
civilization. 

THE GOSPEL A CURE FOR ILLS OF WORLD 

The only solution to these perplexing questions is to be found 
in the teachings of the Master. He gave to the world a philosophy 
of life that will bring to the world the peace and happiness for which 
humanity has been seeking through all the ages. His was a Gospel 
of peace, love and charity, and we must turn to His teachings. He 
was the Prince of Peace, and the nations which persist in ignoring 
His counsel and His warnings are following the path that leads to 
destruction and decay. The last is a quotation. 

John, in the fourth chapter of his first epistle, says: 

Let us love one another; for love is of God; and every one that 
loveth is born of God, and knoweth God. * * * 

If God so loved us, we ought also to love one another. * * * 

If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar; for 
he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love 
God whom he hath not seen? 

And this commandment have we from Him, that he who loveth 
God love his brother also. 

AARON AND MIRIAM REBUKED 

When Moses married the Ethopian woman, as related in Num- 
bers, twelfth chapter, Miriam and Aaron complained of it and said : 

Hath the Lord indeed spoken only by Moses? Hath he not spoken 
also by us? And the Lord heard it. * * * 

And the Lord spake suddenly unto Moses, and unto Aaron, and 
unto Miriam: Come out ye three unto the tabernacle of the congre- 
gation. And they three came out. 

And the Lord came down in the pillar of the cloud, and stood in 



ELDER REED SMOOT 



121 



the door of the tabernacle, and called Aaron and Miriam; and they 
both came forth. 

And he said : Hear now my words : If there be a prophet among 
you, I the Lord will make myself known unto him in a vision, and 
will speak unto him in a dream. 

My servant Moses is not so, who is faithful in all mine house. 

With him will I speak mouth to mouth, even apparently, and not in 
dark speeches; and the similitude of the Lord shall he behold; where- 
fore then were ye not afraid to speak against my servant Moses? 

And the anger of the Lord was kindled against them; and he 
departed. 

And the cloud departed from off the tabernacle; and behold, 
Miriam became leprous, white as snow, and Aaron looked upon 
Miriam and, behold, she was leprous. 

SAYINGS OF THE SAVIOR 

In Matthew., seventh chapter, we read : 
Judge not, that ye be not judged. 

For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged; and with 
what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again. 

And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, 
but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye? 

Or how wilt thou say to thy brother, let me pull out the mote 
out of thine eye; and, behold, a beam is in thine own eye? 

Thou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thine own eye; 
and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother's 
eye. 

God is love, and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God. 
Herein is our love made perfect, .... because as He is, so are we in 
this world. 

LOVE WILL FINALLY TRIUMPH 

We should love and speak the truth, but only in love and kind- 
ness. Truth should ever extend the hand of love. 

Who seeks for heaven alone, to save his soul, 
May keep the path, but will not reach the goal; 
While he who walks in love may wander far, 
Yet God will bring him where the blessed are. 

We should seek to obtain that love, that charity which the 
words of the Apostle Paul declared to be so important. Only 
by so doing can the ills of the world be cured. As Paul makes the 
assertion that "Charity beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth 
all things, endureth all things," he gives us to know that this heaven- 
ly attitude, charity or brotherly love, will triumph and continue, 
where most other things fail or cease. He assures us, in substance, 
that where charity rules, pride hangeth not. 

May God's blessings ever be with us. May we recognize our 
duties not only as citizens of this country, but as members of the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 

May God bless you all. May He bless all undertakings begun 
by the Authorities of this Church in carrying on His work, I humbly 
ask at this time, in the name of the Master, Jesus Christ, Amen. 



122 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Sunday, April 7 Third Day 

BISHOP MARVIN O. ASHTON 

Second Counselor in the Presiding Bishopric 

I do not know how well you know it, but it takes a really strong 
constitution to stand what some of us have stood, expecting it, but 
not knowing how soon it would come. I have learned this much 
in my experience in the Church — I learned it only a couple of hours 
ago — that the Spirit of the Lord does not stay in a meeting too long, 
especially around twelve o'clock. I would not attempt by any means 
to do this job all alone. 

A TRIBUTE TO PRESIDENT MCKAY 

I am thankful from the bottom of my heart, as are you, to hear 
the testimony again of President McKay. I went on a mission to the 
same land as did he. I know how the people in that Mission loved 
him and I know the people of this Church love him in the same de- 
gree as do the Scotch people. May the Lord lengthen his days that 
he may be an inspiration to all of us for years to come. 

SUSTAINING OUR LEADERS 

May the Lord bless all of our leaders. May we have the good 
sense always to pray for them and, better than pray for them, let us 
sustain them in the way we should ; I ask these blessings in the name 
of Jesus Christ, Amen. 



The Choir sang an anthem, "Hosanna," (Jones), after which 
the benediction was pronounced by Elder Henry A. Gardner, Presi- 
dent of the Palmyra Stake. 

Conference adjourned until 2 o'clock p. m. 

THIRD DAY 
AFTERNOON MEETING 

The concluding session of the Conference was held Sunday 
afternoon, October 3, at 2 o'clock. 

As was the condition at the morning session, the great Taber- 
nacle was filled to capacity, and again thousands of people congre- 
gated in the Assembly Hall immediately south of the Tabernacle, 
and on the Tabernacle grounds, to listen to the services as they were 
broadcast from the Tabernacle. 

The Tabernacle Choir furnished the music for this session 
of the Conference, J. Spencer Cornwall, Director. Alexander Schrein- 
er was at the organ console.

PRESIDENT J. REUBEN CLARK, JR. 

First Counselor in the First Presidency 

My brethren and sisters, we come now to the opening of the 
closing session of the Conference. The building is again crowded to 
capacity with thousands on the outside who can not get in. 

The Choir sang an anothem, "Lift Up Your Heads, O ye Gates" 
(Handel). 

Elder Byron O. Colton, President of the Roosevelt Stake, of- 
fered the opening prayer. 

The Choir sang "All Hail the Power of Jesus' Name" (Wil- 
liams). 

ELDER STEPHEN L RICHARDS 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

I should like to say a word in support of the beautification plan 
sponsored both by our Church and the Centennial Commission. I 
can scarcely think of anything more appropriate as a tribute to the 
Pioneers and their heroic struggle. They loved this land. It was 
at once their refuge, their home and their destiny. They called it 
Zion because that word most nearly characterized the Utopia of 
safety, peace, progress and achievement which they sought to estab- 
lish. And a real Zion it was to the thousands of sincere and ardent 
men and women who gathered here from many nations to find ex- 
pression for the loftiest ideals and noblest purposes ever to be found 
in the human soul. 

This country was beautiful when the Pioneers first came. It 
was virgin territory. The hills, the streams, the forests and the 
plains were lovely, just as nature always is until marred by the hand 
of man. It has taken nearly a century to demonstrate the natural 
beauty of the country which the Pioneers chose. It may be that 
they themselves did not realize that it was possessed of so many 
marvelous scenic attractions which have come in for appreciation in 
recent years. It is doubtful that the variety, the grandeur and the 
novelty of our natural scenery can be duplicated within equal space 
anywhere in the entire world. 

DESCRIPTION OF NEARBY BEAUTY SPOTS 

I wish you would take a short trip with me. I am a lover of 
nature and the great outdoors, and I have taken this trip many times. 
I might escort you on many other beautiful excursions in our inter- 
mountain empire. I choose this one merely as a sample. We usually 
begin by going to Fish Lake, then on to Bryce and the Grand Can- 
yon, back to Cedar Breaks and down to Zion. The regard that I 
have for these places has grown with the years until they have be- 
come dear and sacred. I must tell you what they mean to me. 



124 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Sunday, April 7 Third Day 

I love Fish Lake for her tranquility. She nestles in the pines 
and quaking aspens, cool, calm and inviting. When I row a boat 
over her placid waters, crystal-clear, revealing the schools of trout 
so sophisticated as to be unafraid and untempted, a peace and con- 
tentment come over me. I feel reconciled with life. The bfoken 
harmonies are mended. My soul is calmed. 

I am passionately fond of Bryce. She is a cameo of nature — 
not big, but big enough to have dignity. One looks down on her, 
but it is literally and not figuratively, for she commands esteem as 
well as love. I have seen her at sunrise, at sunset, and in the moon- 
light; and as the light and shadows play on her jeweled spires, her 
cathedrals, her organ, her dainty nymphs and graces, the ethereal 
world seems very near, the imagination runs riot with the senses, and 
the soul of man is transported into a realm of exquisite beauty and 
loveliness. 

IMPRESSION MADE ON FRIENDS 

When I first saw her I could not rest until I had taken two 
parties of relatives and friends in quick succession to enjoy with us 
the spell of her supernal beauty. I once included with my guests two 
dear friends, lovers of art and nature, whom, were I to mention their 
names, you would know. I could scarcely await the opportunity of 
seeing them enjoy their first vision of the canyon. They approached 
the rim expectantly but of course not knowing, as no one who has 
not seen can ever know, what awaited them. I thought there would 
be exclamations of delight and wonder. There were not. They 
just looked and as they looked, tears flowed down their cheeks like 
drops of rain. I'm not ashamed to say my eyes filled too. There 
were no words, only feeling — feeling too deep for expression. 

GRAND CANYON, CEDAR BREAKS AND ZION PARK 

The Grand Canyon is so stupendous, so collossal and overwhelm- 
ing as to defy description. Into its awful caverns could all the works 
of man be dumped and lost. The mighty gorge is the demonstra- 
tion of nature's power in changing the face of earth. How puny and 
insignificant it makes the strength of man appear! Humility and 
meekness are the burden of the message that rises from the silver 
ribbon of the river in its depths, up through the mists, to the reverent 
pilgrims who gather at this wonder of the world. 

Cedar Breaks is a masterpiece in oil, a wonderful perspective 
extending far out on the hearth of the setting sun. The brilliant 
hues of her color scheme leave little to be desired in a work of art. 
I enjoy the approach through the wild meadows and the pines. She 
is usually seen in passing but she is of more than passing worth. 

After all of these I come to Zion. Zion the lofty, the majestic 
where you look up instead of down. In its major concept it is not 
a poem, although there are a thousand poems in its sequestered 
nooks, its lovely trees, shrubs and wild flowers, its lacy vines and 



ELDER STEPHEN L RICHARDS

clinging mosses, its mists, its mirror pool, its delicate and gorgeous 
colors and its myriad charms. Rather it is a sermon — inspiring), 
exalting, lifting man from the baser things in life to the nobler. 

Like all worthy things it is well guarded. The Watchman and 
the Sentinel stand in the gateway and the Three Patriarchs solemn- 
ly scrutinize all who enter. When within, however, the friendly 
Twin Brothers and gracious Lady Mountain beckon on with hospi- 
tality and good cheer. The pilgrim is at home in the leafy valley. 
He may pursue his quest without hindrance or disturbance, except 
perhaps for the commotion of his thoughts and his feelings as he pon- 
ders this marvel of God's handiwork. 

AN AWE-INSPIRING SYMBOL 

I have looked diligently to find some one thing — some symbol 
that would epitomize the meaning of it all. I think that I found it 
many years ago. It is not El Gubernador, — the Great White Throne, 
that rears its lofty crested peak high into the blue of heaven, as many 
might suppose it to be. It is not Cable Mountain, nor the Ledge 
of the Weeping Rock, nor even Angel's Landing, significant as that 
may be. It is not the Temple of Sinawava, much as I love to wor- 
ship in that peerless cathedral whose floor is the verdant valley with 
river running through, whose walls are chiseled mile-high by the 
Master Sculptor and whose arch is the blue of the firmament. 

It is a mountain slightly more modest perhaps than some of 
these. I wish it might have had the name I wanted it to have — it is 
called Red Arch Mountain. There is an arch, it is true, and it is 
red. But they who named it could not have seen what made the 
arch or they would have proclaimed it Sinai, the Mountain of the 
Lord, for out of the face of this imposing cliff, a tablet of stone of vast 
proportions has been taken, perfectly hewn. In my fancy I have al- 
ways seen that massive tablet inscribed by the finger of God, broken 
loose by the fierce lightning and resounding thunder and cast to the 
mighty Moses and by that Prophet proclaimed in sonorous and 
piercing voice down through all the ages of man. When I stand in 
awe before this portentous symbol wrought without hands in the 
everlasting hills I seem to hear as in their primeval freshness the 
great commandments of Jehovah : 

Thou shalt have no other Gods before me. 

Thou shalt not steal. 

Thou shalt not commit adultery. 

Thou shalt not kill. 

Thou shalt not covet. 

Thou shalt not bear false witness. 

Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain. 
Honor thy father and thy mother, that it may go well with thee in 
the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee. 

IMPROVEMENTS NOTED 

What a strange paradox it seems that civilization should be 



126 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Sunday, April 7 Third Day 

unbeautiful. To the lover of nature, every landscape, even the 
desert and waste places, has charm and attraction until man digs 
a hole, builds a shack, erects a telegraph pole or a smokestack. But 
civilization need not and should not be ugly. Man's construction 
can beautify rather than deface nature if there is the will, the energy 
and the art to make it so. 

Even commercial and industrial structures and appliances can 
be made good looking. It is noticeable that railroad stations, once 
grimy and unsightly affairs, are now frequently embellished with bits 
of lawn, shrubs, flowers, trees and sometimes with pleasing archi- 
tecture in elaborate settings. Factories, power houses and other 
plants, once bare and forbidding, are now covered with vines set 
in pleasant landscapes, with adequate exposure to light, air and sun- 
shine. These transformations in the commercial world give warrant 
to the hope that some day we shall have beauty in business and that 
it will be a disgrace for any enterprise to be conducted in ugly sur- 
roundings. 

The chief consideration and the problems, however, in this beau- 
tification program probably lie with homes, churches, schools and 
other public properties. In the interest of competition business in- 
stitutions may be pretty well relied upon to go forward with artistic 
improvements, but what can be relied upon to move the home own- 
ers, the church goers and the school patrons to do their part in this 
worthy endeavor? 

COOPERATION NECESSARY 

I believe that nothing but a wholesome, individual and commu- 
nity pride will accomplish the task. To stimulate that pride it is 
necessary to understand and appreciate the real values involved. 
I wish I could say something to enhance that understanding and ap- 
preciation. 

I revert to the first item which I mentioned, — we live in a re- 
markably beautiful country. Our scenery is now being exploited. 
It is true that in the main this is done for commercial reasons but 
nevertheless all the people are beneficiaries of the wide advertising 
and the increased tourist travel which such exploitation brings. 
From a purely monetary standpoint, it is the poorest kind of busi- 
ness to spoil the landscape that we are trying so hard to sell. Every 
dirty,' unkept, unpainted, and shabby home ; every unsightly out- 
building; every old corral and fallen fence; every scraggly dead 
tree ; every barren and forbidding school house and church and court- 
house with broken windows, curled shingles and other evidences of 
neglect ; every littered and weedy vacant lot, street and highway is a 
definite liability against the credit asset of this productive tourist 
traffic we are striving so hard to get. Chambers of Commerce, civic 
clubs and other agencies engaged in its promotion need, more than 
anything else, cooperation in the items I have mentioned. I wish I 
could pledge that support for every home and community in this 



ELDER STEPHEN L RICHARDS 



127 



state and also for every home and community in which our people 
dwell. 

Now this is the business side of the question. I want to present 
another aspect of equal if not superior importance. Some of you may 
remember an old play which was popular on the boards many years 
ago. It was called "Ingomar, the Barbarian." There was a scene 
in this play between the barbarian and Parthenia, the fair maiden 
whom he had come to love. The girl is picking flowers and Ingomar, 
wondering at her interest in them, asks her, "What is their use?" 
Rather startled at such a question, the maiden answers, "Why, 
they're beautiful ! That's their use." 

LOVE OF BEAUTY INNATE 

I think perhaps this gives a good idea of the esthetic and pure 
love of the beautiful. I believe that all people are by nature endowed 
with something of this love in their hearts, and it needs but cultiva- 
tion and encouragement to develop into one of the loveliest aspects 
of living. Almost all are sensitive to color, to form and symmetry, 
so that good architecture and good landscaping with trees, flowers, 
shrubs and lawns have a very appreciable effect, even though some- 
times unconsciously, upon all persons. 

The love of home is one of the great virtues of the race and un- 
doubtedly the beauty of home has done much to stimulate that love. 
Fortunately it is not necessary to be rich or learned to have a love of 
beauty. Very humble folk often have true artistic appreciation. I 
once knew an old lady who spent many hours scrubbing a long board 
walk leading from her house to some outbuildings. I asked her why 
she did it. "Oh, I don't know," she said, "but it seems to me the out- 
side should be as clean as the inside." It's very fortunate that it 
doesn't take much money to indulge esthetic tastes, particularly in 
the care of a home. Cleanliness and neatness are the chief require- 
ments and personal energy, ambition and pride can supply these. The 
humblest cottage can be a lovely place, a haven of refuge and a con- 
stant delight if it is but kept neat and tidy and clean. 

I think of all implements that make for homely beauty there is 
none that compares with the broom and the rake. Well swept floors 
and porches and well raked yards never yet failed to bring their thrill 
of satisfaction and pride. 

Next in importance to a neat yard is a green and colorful one. 
Any house, great or small, attains its real attraction and beauty in a 
setting which nature, with a little human effort, provides. What a 
pity it is not to take advantage of this kindly provision of nature 
when it costs so little and means so much. I'm grateful that out in 
our country relatively few families, and especially the children, are 
required to live in apartments and tenement houses without sur- 
rounding grounds. As I have driven through the streets of New York 
and the bigger cities and seen the little tots struggling to make their 
piay dreams come true, out on the hard, unyielding pavement, with- 



9 



128 GENERAL CONFERENCE

out a spear of green or a flower or a tree, I have felt that I would 
like to pick up every child and bring it to a cottage where it could 
dig its fingers and toes into mother earth, not encrusted with an 
impenetrable shell. 

AN APPEAL FOR BEAUTIFUL HOME SURROUNDINGS 

What a marvelous boon is mother earth ! How abundantly she 
yields of her hidden chemicals and nutriments to make the verdure 
and the vegetation that gladdens and supports the race. My brothers 
and sisters, — countrymen of these mountain valleys, I fear we 
scarcely appreciate the inestimable privilege that we have to live 
on the soil. Oh, for just a little labor and not much money to make 
the soil that we have taken from nature's domain and enclosed around 
our houses, beautiful and attractive ! 

I have said this much about esthetic considerations in the hope 
of encouraging our home people to make the most of their opportuni- 
ties. If every man and woman who lives in a home would embellish 
it to the best of his ability I should feel little concerned about public 
buildings and property. There would be such pride engendered by 
these home-loving people that they would not permit the meeting 
house and the school house to suffer in comparison with their homes. 

Here a little cooperation will bring the desired results. The 
contribution of a few hours of labor with perhaps a little cash will 
landscape the meeting house and transform it from a bleak and bar- 
ren structure into a beautiful and inviting edifice nestled among trees, 
shrubs and lawns. The same may be said of the school house except 
that the school authorities are chiefly responsible and their responsi- 
bility for an ill-kept, forbidding and ugly school house is not so much 
to the town or community whose civic pride is hurt, as to the chil- 
dren, the boys and girls, who all through their lives will carry the 
impressions of ugliness which their surroundings inflict upon them. 

The converse of what I have said is also true, namely, that beau- 
tifully landscaped and attractive churches, schools and other public 
buildings will do much to stimulate better care of homes and all pri- 
vate property. In fact, nothing can be done to stir and encourage 
the esthetic sense in any aspect of our surroundings and our living 
without promoting generally a more beautiful world. 

DUTY OF MAN TO BEAUTIFY THE EARTH 

I will turn your attention to another aspect of this subject with 
which I will conclude. I am sure that beauty is intimately associ- 
ated with pure religion. I believe that our Father in Heaven is a 
God of order and of beauty. I doubt if any rational being ever 
entertained a concept of God, that is, as a personal Being, except in 
surroundings of beauty and exquisite loveliness. We so envisage 
heaven. 

We as a church believe and so declare that in the end the earth 
will be renewed and receive its paradisiacal glory. When this is 



ELDER STEPHEN L RICHARDS 



129 



done it will be beautiful and glorious beyond finite conception. This 
being our doctrine, do you think it becoming in God's children to 
deface the earth while we sojourn here ? Being the stewards and cus- 
todians of the resources which are committed to us, have we not an 
obligation to use them, preserve them and return them in the best 
possible condition of which our circumstances will permit? I think 
upon reflection you will say that we have such an obligation and 
that it is very definitely our'task to make God's footstool as beauti- 
ful as we may. For "the earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof," 
and the righteous "and their generations shall inherit the earth from 
generation to generation forever and forever." 

What a delightful abode for men this good earth could be if men 
would but make it so ! If neighbors all had flower gardens and gos- 
sip centered around daffodils, lilacs and petunias, there would be far 
more kindliness and sympathy in the world. Even the thorns of 
roses do not irritate men's souls. 

You will find that the unfortunate young men who today fill our 
prisons and other houses of detention do not come from pretty cot- 
tages with vines growing over the door, carefully trained by patient, 
tender mothers and you will find that the proud and haughty and 
arrogant of the world are not the true product of the soil. It is no 
misstatement that "the meek shall inherit the earth," for it is only 
they who truly acknowledge and worship the Master Giver. 

Need I say more to persuade us that every consideration,— bus- 
iness, esthetic and religious, — constrains our people to take the lead 
in this worthy cause of beautifying the land ? I understand that ex- 
pert advice will be made available in the laying out of grounds, in 
planting and in other features calculated to reach the objectives 
of the program. With this aid our efforts will be successful if only 
our interest and our energy are sufficient. 

A GREAT LEADER MENTIONED 

What if our great and wise pioneer leader, Brigham Young, 
should return on the hundredth anniversary of his entrance into this 
the Salt Lake Valley? How it would please him and thrill his noble 
soul to find the cities, the towns and villages which he planned so 
well and strove so diligently and courageously to found, all in the 
bloom of midsummer, with farms and fields laden with maturing 
crops, with pastures and hills dotted with flocks and herds, with fac- 
tories, business blocks, public buildings, schools and churches re- 
flecting a vast development in enterprise, culture and religion which 
he so earnestly advocated; and then too, most thrilling of all, if he 
could find thousands of contented homes, nestled in the shade of 
myriads of trees, growing out of lawns, shrubs and fragrant flowers, 
all neat and clean, the habitation of an honest, thrifty, God-loving, 
joyous people, and all this in the desert valleys which he first saw, 
now transformed and beautified by the enterprise and the idealism 



130 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Sunday. April 7 Third Day 

of the generations that followed him ! Surely the cup of his gratitude 
would be running over. 

Why may it not be so ? What more worthy and fitting tribute 
could we offer to those patient, devoted men and women whose cour- 
age, whose intelligence and whose labor have bequeathed to us the 
priceless heritage we now enjoy? 

God grant that our love, our gratitude and our veneration may 
find tangible expression in beauty — beauty of life and surroundings, 
I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

MESSAGE FROM PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

President Clark: We are pleased and I am sure we shall be en- 
heartened by a message which has just come from President Heber 
J. Grant, which I shall read : 

Los Angeles, April 7, 1940 

Presidents J. Reuben Clark, Jr., and David O. McKay, 
Care Mormon Conference, Salt Lake Tabernacle, 
Salt Lake City, Utah. 

I cannot adequately express the joy that came from listening in on 
this morning's session of Conference. It came through wonderfully clear 
and was a spiritual feast in which many friends here joined. I was es- 
pecially pleased that President McKay was able to speak with such ease. 
I am looking forward with great anticipation to this afternoon's session 
in which I shall join with you in spirit. I am feeling fine today and 
improving some every day. Please convey again to the Saints my love 
and blessings. 

HEBER J. GRANT. 



BISHOP LEGRAND RICHARDS 

Presiding Bishop of the Church 

More than anything else this day, my brethren and sisters, I 
feel grateful to the Lord for membership in this great Church. It 
has been a wonderful privilege to associate with President Grant, 
President Clark, and President McKay in the weekly meetings that 
we have been privileged to hold with them as members of the Pre- 
siding Bishopric. To me they are indeed prophets of God. I love 
and respect the members of the Quorum of the Twelve likewise, 
and the Seven Presidents of Seventy. I am grateful to the Lord 
for my Counselors because they are truly men of God. I am grateful 
for all you who are here representing the great body of the Church, 
these General Boards, the Mission Presidents, Stake Presidents, 
and their associates, the Bishops, these Patriarchs, and all who are 
putting forth their energies for the upbuilding of the Kingdom of 
God in the earth.

THE PRESENT NEED FOR TEACHING THE WORD OF WISDOM 

I was very much impressed with the charge given to the Priest- 
hood by President Clark in the opening session of this Conference, 
and I thought of the words of Dr. Widtsoe when speaking of the 
Word of Wisdom. He said there are some in the Church who feel 
that we have said enough about it. I have been in private conversa- 
tion, and Sunday School classes where the thought has been ex- 
pressed that they wished President Grant would cease harping on 
the Word of Wisdom. In my heart I have felt to say, "Thank God for 
the leader that he is who has the courage to speak out and present 
to the people the things which God has revealed !" I am sure if we 
appreciated the Word of Wisdom and its meaning to the Church as 
much as Satan appreciates what it means when we can be persuaded 
to disregard the same, we would appreciate it more than we do to- 
day. I am grateful to my parents who taught me to observe and 
keep the Word of Wisdom. 

I am sure that as far as our young people are concerned, the 
members of our Church, a disregard for the Word of Wisdom is the 
first step that Satan would have them take in his great effort to 
destroy their souls. At the time there was war in heaven and Satan 
and his hosts were cast out, a cry went up in heaven saying, "Woe 
to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea! for the Devil is come 
down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath 
but a short time." 

In our Temples we are told of the use Satan would make of the 
riches of the world to try to destroy the souls of men. Last night in 
our Priesthood assembly Brother Merrill told us that some thirty 
million dollars are expended each year in the United States alone 
in advertising tobacco and liquor in an effort to induce our young 
people to break the Word of Wisdom. 

MANIFESTATION TO A PATRIARCH 

One of the most interesting things that has occurred to me dur- 
ing this Conference was a visit at the Presiding Bishop's Office of 
one of my former associates in the Church who was recently ap- 
pointed a Patriarch and set apart and ordained by Dr. Widtsoe. He 
told me of how he felt his inability to meet that wonderful calling 
until he was blessed by Brother Widtsoe, and then he told of the joy 
he had had in giving blessings to the young people in the Church 
and of,the manifestations that had come to him. Among other things 
he said that while he was blessing one young man he saw an evil 
spirit standing by his side, and the impression came to him that 
the evil spirit was listening to what was being said so that he would 
know what his mission in life was, that he might try to destroy that 
mission. It reminded me of a picture I saw in Brussels many years 
ago, when I was on my first mission, of a man who shot his head off, 
and by his side stood two angels, one of light and one of darkness, 



132 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Sunday, April 7 ' Third Day 

and as he committed the deed the angel of darkness laughed with a 
laugh of triumph and the angel of light turned his head and wept. 

EFFECTS OF BREAKING WORD OF WISDOM FAR-REACHING 

I am sure, my brethren and sisters, the Evil One is doing all 
he can to try to destroy the lives of our boys and girls. He did it 
with the Prophet Joseph. You will remember the Prophet's own 
testimony of how he was first overcome by the power of darkness, 
when he went into the woods to pray. He is seeking to destroy us 
because we have been given the Light, and I want to say to you that 
when we disregard the Word of Wisdom, we not only suffer a bio- 
logical ill effect upon our bodies by using things that are not good 
for the body, but it changes our mental attitude toward the things 
of God. If you brethren and sisters question this, I would ask you 
to inquire in your own homes or the homes of your associates. I 
think you will find that when boys and girls commence using tobacco 
or liquor they cease to pray, and in most cases they cease to attend 
Sunday School, the Mutual Improvement organization, and other 
Auxiliaries of this Church. I think an examination of the rolls would 
indicate that this is true in almost every case. And that is not all. 
The Lord has indicated to us that these bodies are tabernacles of 
the Holy Ghost and that the Holy Ghost will not dwell in an unholy 
tabernacle. Paul tells us that these bodies are not our own but God 
has purchased them with a price and he that defileth the body, him 
shall God destroy. So, when we commence to do the things we 
should not do, and thus we quit praying, the Lord withdraws His 
Spirit and we are turned over to the buffetings of Satan. It is first 
a cigaret ; then it is a glass of beer ; then it is a drinking party ; and 
that leads to immorality ; and some of us know from our experience 
in the Church something of what this means. I wish that in all the 
cities of this great country all the Latter-day Saints were keeping 
the Word of Wisdom. I want to tell you that the light and influ- 
ence that would go forth therefrom would touch the hearts and the 
lives of men and women who reside in our midst who are not mem- 
bers of the Church, and they would be led to do likewise. As the 
Master said, "Let your light so shine before men, that they may see 
your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven." 

From a statement made by Dr. George Thomason, M. D., F. A. 
C. S., regarding the effects of tobacco, I read : 

Our hearts are saddened and our eyes filled with tears at the sight 
of the mangled and crippled human wrecks left as an aftermath of 
war; but these do not compare in horror with the innumerable multi- 
tudes of hereditary defectives left in the wake of the vast army of 
cigarets. Is it fair to make the man or woman of tomorrow — our pos- 
terity — pay the fiddler for our pleasures today? 

In the Ten Commandments, 4he Lord has said that He will 
visit the iniquities of the fathers upon the children unto the third 
and fourth generation of them that hate Him, but show mercy unto 



BISHOP LE GRAND RICHARDS 



133 



thousands of them who love Him and keep His commandments. 
Keeping the Word of Wisdom will free us and our posterity from 
these calamities. 

LIQUOR AND ITS TRAIN OF EVILS 

Regarding the use of liquor, I should like to quote from the 
words of Evangeline Booth of the Salvation Army : 

Drink has drained more blood, hung more crepe, sold more 
homes, plunged more people into bankruptcy, armed more villains, 
slain more children, snapped more wedding rings, defiled more inno- 
cence, blinded more eyes, twisted more limbs, dethroned more reason, 
wrecked more manhood, dishonored more womanhood, broken more 
hearts, blasted more lives, driven more to suicide, and dug more graves 
than any other poisoned scourge that ever swept its death-dealing 
waves across the world. 

If we never used tobacco and liquor, we would never have any 
of these things to contend with. It seems to me that the Word of 
Wisdom might be regarded as an insurance policy ; if we keep the 
Word of Wisdom, Satan does not get to first base with us because 
we are not made subject to his temptations. 

OUTSTANDING EXAMPLE OF AN ACTRESS 

I should like to take the liberty of reading a quotation that 
appeared in the "Hollywood Citizen," under date of February 15, 
1940, showing what the life of a Mormon boy or girl can do and of 
the notoriety it brings when they stand up for the things they have 
been taught in their Church : 

Wonders never cease and today we met in the center of Holly- 
wood a movie actress, and a beautiful one, too, who never has tasted 
a cocktail nor smoked a cigaret. 

Her name is Laraine Day, and lips that touch liquor shall never 
touch hers, and if there is any other movie star with a record like that, 
we'll put it in our pipe and smoke it. 

We're not trying to spoof Miss Day, either. She is a member of 
the Church of the Latter-day Saints, she's engaged to a missionary, 
and we have the greatest of respect for her. Only we're a little sur- 
prised that a girl of her temperament and background is in the movies. 

"But it isn't at all surprising," she insisted, "Mormons don't drink 
or smoke, but they have no objections to the theater, or to motion 
pictures. In fact, I got my first stage experience in Church plays, 
and here in Hollywood I'm in charge of a Little Theater group spon- 
sored by the Church." 

Miss Day, who is hazel-eyed, barely 20, and one of the brightest 
of M-G-M's younger stars, likes night clubs, where she drinks either 
soda pop or milk. 

"Keeping away from liquor is no problem for me," she said, 
"except in the movies. A few weeks ago I was in a picture where 
we were supposed to be at dinner, eating trifle. This is a British 
dessert, which consists of macaroons and whipped cream. So the 
studio sent to a caterer's and got a whole barrel of trifle. It was 
flavored with rum. I just tasted the whipped cream on top and didn't 
eat a bit of it! 



134 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Sunday, April 7 Third Day 

We suggested that a tablespoon of rum in a pudding was no more 
intoxicating than a spoon of vanilla extract, but Miss Day said she 
wasn't interested in that. It was the principle of the thing. 

Currently she is playing the leading feminine role in "And One 
Was Beautiful," opposite Robert Cummings, and if ever there was a 
living example of the fact that a girl needn't be wild to succeed in 
Hollywood, she is it. 

Then the article goes on to tell more about her, how she earns 
a good salary; how 5 she pays her tithing to the Church; how she 
converted her young boy friend, and he is now filling a mission for 
the Church. 

If, like Miss Day, we would never touch tobacco or liquor, be- 
cause of the "principle of the thing," we would never have to quit, 
and we would bring great honor to the Church. And, as I say, the 
principle is like an insurance policy, a protection against the snares 
of the Evil One and the consequences that follow the disregard 
thereof. 

IMMORALITY A MODERN CURSE 

In addition to the injury to the body because of the use of to- 
bacco and liquor as I have stated, is the injury that comes from 
immorality. Those of us who have read and know something of 
the conditions in the world today know that this is a plague that is 
reaching into our very communities, that we should not be unmind- 
ful of, but we ought to surround our girls and our boys with all 
the influence and power possible to enable them to shun this evil. 

I was delighted with the plainness with which President Clark 
spoke on this subject. In one of our meetings with the First Presi- 
dency, President Grant told of a letter he had received from a young 
woman who had been untrue morally and how she wrote and said to 
the President, "Why don't you publish a warning in the 'Era' and 
the newspapers and tell it in the organizations so that young people 
will know what it is when they have lost their virtue ?" 

I hope that the fathers and mothers in Israel are training their 
boys and girls today as my father and mother trained me when they 
told me that immorality was the greatest sin a man could commit 
next to the shedding of innocent blood, and that they would rather 
lay me away in the grave innocent and clean than to know I had lost 
my virtue or had robbed a woman of hers. I think, my brothers and 
sisters, that we need to do a little more of that kind of preaching to- 
day. It seems to me that one of the evidences that there is a God is 
the great scourge and curse that He places upon men and women 
who are immoral in their lives. A few years ago we read in a Salt 
Lake newspaper that a young man had committed suicide, and the 
paper said, "because he was despondent," but his father told me that 
the reason he committed suicide was because his body was wasting 
away as the result of immoral living. I might not have understood 
what he meant had it not been for an experience I had in Chicago 
when I was on my way to my first mission as a boy. We saw there

photographs of men's and women's bodies literally being eaten away 
by the effects of venereal disease. It made such an impression upon 
my mind at that time that I could not help but think it almost as bad 
as leprosy. I read a report in one of the Railroad stations in one of 
our large cities rfot long ago that indicated that 780,000 young 
men reach their majority in the United States each year, and 
of that number 450,000, according to statistics of the Bureau of Vital 
Statistics of the United States of America, suffer from venereal dis- 
ease. And that, in this great land we call a Christian nation. When 
we know such conditions exist, my brothers and sisters, we realize 
more the need of teaching our young people. I feel to thank God for 
these teachings. In my position as a presiding officer in this Church, 
I have had men come to me in transgression. I have seen them shed 
bitter tears, and I thank God for the principle of forgiveness of sin. 
I have wished it were even possible, not only to forgive the sin but 
to blot out the memory of the sin, and then I think as they grow in 
experience, even if they repent and they become useful in the Church, 
of the scars that are still there, when they know there are women 
who know they have been unclean. 

The Lord said to Ezekiel of old that He had placed him as a 
watchman on the towers of Israel and when He gave a commandment 
unto him and he failed to carry it to the people, then their blood 
would be required at his hands, but if he delivered the message, he 
would be free. I think it is up to the Elders in Israel and the officers 
of this Church, as President Clark has said, to let the people know 
so that we might keep ourselves free from responsibility for their 
sins, and help them to remain unspotted from the sins of the world. 
"Blessed are the pure in heart," Jesus said, "for they shall see God." 
God help us to be that, and our children likewise, I pray in the name 
of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

The Ladies' Voices of the Tabernacle Choir sang "O Divine 
Redeemer" (Gounod-Cain). 

ELDER RICHARD R. LYMAN 

Of the Council of the Tzvelve Apostles 

The purpose of my remarks this afternoon is to appeal to the people 
to come to the support of the Church Welfare Plan. 

DIRECTION OF WELFARE PLAN BY LEADERS 

Our leader, the President of the Church, has directed its' organiza- 
tion and operation. And he has appealed to the people to come to the 
support of this undertaking in much the same way as did Paul the 
Apostle when, in speaking to the Elders of the Church, he said, "Ye 
ought to support the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord 
Jesus, how He said, It is more blessed to give than to receive." (Acts 
20:35.) And President Grant has made his appeal with much the same 



136 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Sunday, April 7 Third Day 

earnestness and feeling as did Paul when he added, "Therefore watch, 
and remember, that by the space of three years I ceased not to warn 
every one night and day with tears." (Acts 20:31.) 

And while the aims of this Church Welfare Plan are many, on 
this occasion I am going to mention but two. The first of these is pro- 
viding employment and teaching the untrained and inefficient how to 
work, and the second is eliminating the suffering and the handicaps that 
are due to poverty. 

THE IM'PORTANCE OF EFFICIENCY 

After projects have been created and employment has been secured, 
hardly anything is more important than teaching people how to work 
and then teaching them the importance of performing assigned tasks 
with reasonable speed and efficiency. There are mothers who say that 
because they themselves had a hard time they are going to see to it that 
their daughters have an easy time. And there are fathers who say be- 
cause they themselves had a hard time in the days of their youth, they 
are going to do their utmost to see to it that their sons have an easy time. 

Strong men and strong women, those who work efficiently, those 
whose services are always in demand, are not brought up having an easy 
time. Work is the only thing in the world worth while that wins. The 
world seems to be seeking always the services of those who work with 
a high degree of speed and a high degree of efficiency. Such individuals 
are rarely unemployed. It has been wisely said that he who can write 
a better book or preach a better sermon, or even make a better mouse 
trap than his neighbor, though he build his house in the woods, the world 
will make a beaten pathway to his door. 

And since it is the ability and the willingness of people to work, 
and the speed and the efficiency with which they toil, which creates a 
demand for their services, one of the outstanding purposes of the Church 
Welfare Plan after providing employment is to teach people to work. 
At the same time it should be borne in mind that there are two periods 
in life which ought to be free from the necessity of earning a living. One 
of these is childhood. No child ought to be compelled to work for his 
daily bread. And the other period is old age. No one who is old, espec- 
ially when in poor health, ought to be compelled to work for his living. 

THRIFT URGED 

And if these two periods in life are to be free from the necessity 
of earning a living, it will be necessary for those who labor to lay some- 
thing by during the laboring years of their lives in order to provide for 
the necessities of childhood and the necessities of age. This can be done 
only when and if frugal ways, frugal habits and industry are the charac- 
teristics of those who toil. These desirable conditions can be brought 
about only if workers during the earning period of their lives spend less 
than they make. 



ELDER RICHARD R. LYMAN

PROJECTS TO BE PLANNED 

It is the aim of the Church so to train the people that they will have 
the character and the honor, the desire and the willingness, to give a full 
day of honest, efficient service for a full day's pay. The able-bodied are 
expected to work for their daily bread. Projects of many different kinds 
and descriptions are to be organized in every Stake and Ward and Mission 
and Branch of the Church with the hope and with the expectation that 
those who are able to work will be given an opportunity, on these projects, 
to provide themselves, by honest effort, with the necessities of life. 

HUMAN BEINGS NOT ALL ALIKE 

And in all this the natural weaknesses and imperfections of mankind 
must be taken into account. There are. those in the human family whose 
mental make-up is such that for them to learn to lace up their own shoes 
is a real accomplishment. In fact the mentalities, capacities and abilities 
of human beings are so varied that one wise man has said : The human 
family may be divided into three groups with a rather high degree of ac- 
curacy. Fifteen per cent of the "human family will work whether they 
are watched or not. Thirty-five per cent of the human family will work 
if well watched, and fifty per cent of the human family will not work 
watched or otherwise." I leave it to you to decide for yourselves whether 
or not this conclusion is correct. 

A GOOD REPORT FROM ONE STAKE 

The second aim of the Church Welfare Plan, as I have already 
stated, is the elimination of the suffering and the handicaps which are 
due to poverty. In a Stake Welfare meeting held recently the Ward 
Presidents of the Relief Societies of the Stake were called upon for 
reports. And all stated that in their respective Wards every family had 
been visited and every home had been carefully investigated. The visi- 
tors found that all the families were comfortably housed, no child was, 
nor were any of the unemployable aged, required to work for a living. 
There was no child bare-footed. There was no child that was hungry. 
All the children were well clothed. All of the aged and all of the children 
were reported as being well cared for and it was stated further that the 
children all had ample opportunity to attend school. Thus, in that par- 
ticular Stake, the aim had been reached of eliminating the suffering and 
the handicaps which are due to poverty. 

A STORY REVIEWED 

The main purpose of these remarks is to appeal to you to come to 
the support of this Church Welfare Plan. I repeat the words of the 
Master Himself, "It is more blessed to give than to receive," and the 
words of Paul, "Ye ought to support the weak." I can think of no better 
illustration of what I mean than the impressive lesson taught in Van 
Dyke's grippingly interesting religious story entitled, "The Mansion." I 



138 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Sunday. April 7 Third Day 

shall give this story briefly in almost the exact language of my close and 
beloved friend, that master of English literature, the late Dr. Henry 
Van Dyke. 

John Wightman, a wealthy business man and banker, dreamed that 
he was sitting on a stone, not far from a broad pathway, in a strange land. 
The travelers in little groups or larger ones were all clothed in white. 
It was like some old picture. Now and then one of the travelers would 
smile, and beckon John Wightman a friendly greeting, so that he felt as 
if they would like to have him join them. 

This was a vastly different world from that in which the palatial 
mansion of John Wightman on a great avenue of a great city, a modern 
metropolis, had been built. All of this looked strange to him and yet most' 
real — as real as anything he had ever seen. 

He had a faint premonition of what all this must be, but, wishing to 
be sure, he walked toward one of the passing groups of people. One of 
them turned to meet him and put out his hand. It was an old man under 
whose white beard and brows John Wightman saw the face of the village 
doctor who had cared for him when he was but a poor boy in the country. 

"Welcome," said the old man, "Will you come with us ?" 

"Where are you going?" 

"To see the heavenly city, to see our mansions there ! Come join us. 
It will do you good. You also must have a mansion in this heavenly city 
waiting for you — a fine one too. Are you not looking forward to seeing 
it?" 

"Yes," replied John Wightman, "Yes, it must be so. But I had not 
expected to see it so soon. I will go with you and we will talk on the way." 

The doctor had little to tell of his plain, hard life in the country. It 
had been uneventfully spent for others. His story and that of the country 
village where he lived was a very simple one. A much richer story was 
that of John Wightman's adventures, and triumphs, full of contacts with 
the great events and the great personages of his time. But in that wide, 
heavenly moorland, in that free air of perfect peace, John Wightman did 
not care to speak much about his experiences. 

All the people in these groups seemed to be people who, during their 
lifetime upon the earth, had been folks of comparatively little considera- 
tion. But John Wightman was glad that they would all find fit dwelling 
places prepared for them ; but he thought also, with a certain pride and 
pleasure, of the great surprise that some of them would feel when they 
saw his appointed mansion. If they were so sure, each one, of finding a 
mansion there, could not he be far more sure? For his life had surely 
been more fruitful than theirs. He had been a leader, a founder, owner 
and manager of many new and important enterprises. 

Now. before these travelers, stood the heavenly city. It was white 
and wonderful. Its walls were so low a child could see over them. The 
gate of this city was not like a gate at all. It was not barred with iron or 
wood ; it was only a single pearl which marked the place where the wall 
ended and the entrance lay open. 



ELDER RICHARD R, LYMAN

A person standing there said, "Come in, you are at your journey's 
end and your mansions are ready for you." 

They passed from street to street among fair and spacious dwellings 
adorned with an infinitely varied beauty of divine simplicity. The man- 
sions differed in size, in shape, in charm; each seemed to have its own 
personal look of loveliness. As the company came one by one to the man- 
sions prepared for them, and their guide beckoned to the happy ones to 
enter into and take possession, there was, on the part of all of them, a 
soft murmur of joy. These new and immortal dwellings were lovelier 
and nobler than all the earthly dreams they had had of them. One after 
another the travelers were led to their own mansions and went in gladly ; 
and from within, through the open doors, came sweet voices of welcome 
and low laughter and happy song. 

At last there was no one left with the guide but the two old friends, 
the village doctor and John Wightman. They were standing in front of 
one of the largest and fairest of the heavenly mansions whose garden 
glowed softly with radiant flowers. The guide, laying his hand upon 
the doctor's shoulder said, "This is for you. Go in. There is no more sick- 
ness here, no more death, no sorrow, no pain ! The old enemies are all 
conquered, and all the good that you have done for others, all the help 
that you have given, all the comfort that you have brought, all the strength 
and love that you have bestowed upon the suffering, are here, and we have 
built all of them into this mansion for you." 

The good man's face lighted with a still joy. He clasped his old 
friend's hand and whispered, "How wonderful all of this is ! Go on, you 
will come to your own mansion next no doubt. It will not be far away. 
We shall see each other again soon, very soon." 

And so the village doctor went through the garden and into the music 
within. The keeper of the gate then turned to John Wightman with level, 
quiet, searching eyes and asked gravely, "Where do you wish me to lead 
you now ?" 

"To my own mansion," answered the man with half-concealed ex- 
citement. "Is there not one here for me? I am John Wightman. I 
wish very much to see my mansion. I believe that you have one for me. 
Will you take me to it ?" 

The keeper of the gate drew a little book from the breast of his robe 
and turned over the pages. 

"Certainly," he said, with a curious look at the man, "Your name is 
here ; and you shall see your mansion if you will follow me." 

It seemed as if they must have walked miles and miles through the 
vast city before they came into a kind of suburb where there were many 
small cottages. Finally they reached an open field, barren and lonely 
looking. In the center of the field was a tiny hut, hardly big enough for 
a shepherd's shelter. It looked as if it had been built of discarded things, 
scraps and fragments of other buildings. These, however, had been put 
together with great care by someone who had taken great pains to make 
the most of cast-off material. There was something pitiful and shameful 
about the hut. 



140 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Sunday, April 7 Third Day 

"This," said the keeper of the gate, standing still and speaking with 
a low, distinct voice, "This, John Wightman, is yours." 

An almost intolerable shock of grief, wonder and indignation choked 
the man for a moment so that he could not say a word. Then finally he 
turned his face away from the poor little hut and .began to remonstrate 
eagerly with his companion. 

"Surely, sir," he stammered, "You must be in error about this. There 
is something wrong — some other John Wightman — confusion of names 
— the book must be incorrect." 

"There is no mistake," said the keeper of the gate very calmly ; "Here 
is your name, the record of your title and of your possessions in this 
place." 

"But how could such a house be prepared for me?" cried the man, 
with a resentful tremor in his voice. "Is this a suitable mansion for one 
so well-known and so successful in life upon the earth? Why is it so 
pitifully small and mean? Why have you not built it large and fair like 
the others ?" 

"That is all the material you sent to us." 

"What!" 

"We have used all the material that you sent us," repeated the keeper 
of the gate. 

"I acknowledge," added the man, "that I considered my own inter- 
ests too much. But surely not altogether." 

Dimly, through the trouble of his mind, John Wightman began to 
see the seriousness of his situation. 

"What is it that counts here ?" he asked. 

"Only that counts here," said the keeper of the gate, "which is truly 
given. Only those things are given consideration in this place which are 
done solely for the love of doing good, only those plans are given con- 
sideration in which the welfare of others is the master thought. Only 
those labors count here in which the sacrifice is greater than the antici- 
pated reward. Only those gifts are given consideration in which the giver 
forgets himself!" 

THE WORDS OF THE SAVIOR 

And I will conclude this, my appeal, to you, to come to the support 
of the Church Welfare Plan with the following familiar words from the 
25th chapter of Matthew: (verses 31-40) 

When the Son of Man shall come in His glory, and all the holy 
angels with Him, then shall He sit upon the throne of His glory ; 

And before Him shall be gathered all nations; and He shall sep- 
arate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from 
the goats ; 

And He shall set the sheep on His right hand, but the goats on the 

left. 

Then shall the King say unto them on His right hand, Come, ye 
blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the 
foundation of the world; 

For I was an hungered, and ye gave me meat; I wqs thirsty, and 
ye gave me drink ; I was a stranger, and ye took me in ; 



ELDER JOHN H. TAYLOR 



141 



Naked, and ye clothed me; I was sick, and ye visited me; I was in 
prison, and ye came unto me. 

Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee 
an hungered, and fed thee? or thirsty, and gave thee drink? 

When saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in ? or naked, and clothed 
thee? 

Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee? 

And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto 
you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my 
brethren, ye have done it unto me." 

Again, in the language of Paul the Apostle, let us "Remember the 
words of the Lord Jesus how He said, It is more blessed to give than to 
receive." (Acts 20:35) And may we all be found among those worthy, 
unselfish and righteous ones who feed the hungry and clothe the naked, 
I humbly pray. 

ELDER JOHN H. TAYLOR 

Of the First Council of the Seventy 

As a people we have been thoroughly traditionated in the 
thought that it is a duty as well as a privilege for all of our men, 
as conditions will permit, to go out and preach the Gospel of Jesus 
Christ. Tradition is a wholesome thing provided it has had its 
beginning in high ideals, courage, the thought that we are the 
servants of the Lord, and that these high ideals have been carried 
unchanged from the past down to the present. 

ASSIGNING MISSIONARIES TO NEW FIELDS 

One of the ideals of the missionary is that he is willing to go 
wherever the Lord requires him to do. Last night in our Priesthood 
Meeting we sang the song "I'll Go Where You Want Me to Go, Dear 
Lord." Perhaps we never have had the same opportunity of wit- 
nessing a demonstration of this attitude with as large a number as 
we had recently when, on account of the war, missionaries were re- 
turned from Europe to America. Through the kindness of the First 
Presidency I was assigned to go to New York to work with Presi- 
dent Frank Evans of the Eastern States Mission in receiving the 
missionaries as they arrived. Hotel accommodations and transporta- 
tion were arranged for them and mission assignments were made 
for those who were to finish their missions in the United States and 
Canada. It has been indicated by President Clark the amount of 
work that was accomplished in handling the missionaries. May I 
say in addition that the short stay of the missionaries in New York 
was made more enjoyable because of the splendid hospitality and 
kindness of President and Sister Evans and the missionaries in the 
office. 

When the missionaries were to be reassigned we expected to 
use the same methods that were used when they left home, that is, 
we thought that we would be able to interview missionaries and find 



142 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Snnday. April 7 Third Day 

out in detail concerning their attitude and their desires. After the 
first group or so, it became evident that because of the short time 
they were in New York, this would be impossible. We therefore 
took the attitude that most of the missionaries coming from Europe 
were experienced, well trained and full of faith and therefore would 
be willing to go wherever they might be assigned for the best inter- 
ests of the work of the Lord. 

I am quite sure that all of the missionaries, just as we would 
have felt ourselves, had some thought or desire as to where they 
would like to labor while in the American Missions. Most mission- 
aries, at the time of their call, have had the experience of making 
mental adjustments. At home we send out missionary calls all over 
the Church only knowing in a small way the disappointment that 
sometimes comes to the missionary and the parents when they find 
that he has been assigned to a mission field different from the one 
most desired. But with good courage and faith in the work, they 
do not ask for a change. 

I might say that we were helped in selecting new mission fields 
for the missionaries by the kindly instructions of the brethren at 
home and also by the suggestions of the Mission Presidents under 
whom they had labored. However, these suggestions were only 
few in number. The assignment of the great majority was left to me. 

A meeting was held with each group. The missionaries, as they 
came into these meetings had, I am quite certain, a desire or wish 
that they might be sent to certain mission fields. We came to each 
meeting with a sincere prayer in our hearts that the Lord would 
guide us in making the most suitable assignments. When names 
were read out and the mission fields were designated, it was astonish- 
ing with what good spirit they were accepted. The cases were few 
and far between when information was brought to our attention that 
a missionary thought he should have been sent to some other field. I 
can not remember of any missionary saying that he would not go 
to the field assigned to him. 

To me it was one of the finest expressions of faith in the work of 
the Lord to see them accept these appointments, even though they 
might not have been as agreeable to them as some other mission 
field. And so, these wonderful boys and girls, holding on to the 
high missionary ideals of the Church, went into the different Ameri- 
can fields and made the adjustment no matter what it was. 

COURAGE AND FAITH OF MISSIONARIES 

Not only had each missionary the experience of being transfer- 
red from one field to another but he also had the sad experience 
of having to say goodby to those faithful Saints in the foreign 
fields. I am speaking of those men and women in Europe who have 
shown much true devotion to the work of the Lord. The mission- 
aries had also come in contact with the splendid Presidents and 
their wives in the foreign fields. They had learned to love these 



ELDER RUFUS K. HARDY 



143 



men and women, had become sincerely devoted to them because 
of their humility and ability as leaders. Now they were to come 
into another field and make new contacts, to work under different 
circumstances and conditions, and this took considerable faith and 
courage on the part of all these missionaries. 

The reports that have come to us from the American fields 
have been most favorable. You parents can certainly be very proud 
of these boys and girls of yours who were in Europe, because of 
their attitude, their love of the work, their devotion to the Cause, 
and their determination to make good in any field or under any 
condition. 

If future missionaries, parents, and those in leadership could 
constantly keep before them this example of holding true to high 
missionary ideals, I am sure that we should find an increase in hap- 
piness, spirituality and usefulness on the part of missionaries as 
they give service to our Heavenly Father. 

May this be a part of our missionary life, a part of our true 
tradition that has been carried forward so splendidly all these years, 
and may we not be found wanting as we are called into the field, 
I pray in Jesus' name, Amen. 

ELDER RUFUS K. HARDY 

of the First Council of the Seventy 

My beloved brothers and sisters, I am sure that I feel, as do you 
on this occasion, gratitude and joy and thanksgiving in our hearts 
for the presence here of President McKay. 

THE INFLUENCE OF THE CONFERENCE FELT AFAR OFF 

Somehow or other I feel that perhaps I am not mistaken in the 
thought that President Grant has been here with us. You know this 
world and its influences move on, and some marvelous things are 
coming constantly. Even today we have had a message from him, 
and his spirit and influence have been with us. When we gather to- 
gether such a great concourse of people, such a marvelous gathering 
of the Priesthood as was here last night, that power, that influence, 
that strength and might which emanate from each individual spirit 
are felt by other individuals, and I feel confident President Grant "will 
have received this spirit and this influence, together with love, hope, 
faith, and strength from us. Therefore, he has been blessed and we 
have been blessed in receiving from him his blessedness, his tender- 
ness, love, and felicitations. 

I thank God for His peaceful, sweet influence which has per- 
meated this Conference and that all of us have been filled with the 
testimony of Jesus Christ, and the knowledge that God is our Father.- 

STAKE MISSIONARY WORK 

As I come to these Conferences lately I have only one thing on 




GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Third Dag 



my mind that I should like above everything else to mention, and 
that is the work which is being done by the two thousand mission- 
aries in your midst in the Stakes of Zion. I thank you sincerely for 
your help and I would like you to know that during the year 1939, 
two thousand two hundred and twenty souls have been added to this 
Church through the missionary labors of those in the Stakes of 
Zion of this Church, and that four thousand souls have been gathered 
into the fold who had become somewhat indifferent and inactive. 
Those six thousand people engaging in activity in this Church — 
and they are about half the size of this audience — will add mighty 
strength and tremendous force to the work of God going on here on 
the earth today. 

' I sincerely trust that the early days of this missionary work, 
recently inaugurated, are over, and that our fine and splendid Bishops 
— God bless them for the help they have given — won't give us Tom, 
Dick, or Harry, whom they never have been able to get to do any- 
thing, and so they suggest them to the President of the Stake because 
if he can do anything with them in the missionary field the Bishops 
would like to see it done. 



God, our Heavenly Father, chose to give to you and to me the 
choicest soul He had — His Only Begotten- — to lead the great mis- 
sionary work of the earth and be the pattern for us to follow. These 
men and women, our stake missionaries, are meeting up and down 
the highways and the byways of our own cities and towns the 
finer people, the better class, those who need and seek instruction, 
and we need that better type of missionary; not only one who is 
trained, but one who is willing and desires to go forth and do that 
which God would have him do. I am sure that our work will be 
made much plainer and much more happiness will result if we are 
given that kind of missionary. 



I want to read to you something that I have copied, and then 

close : 
• 

No power or influence can or ought to be maintained by virtue of 
the Priesthood, only by persuasion, by long-suffering, by gentleness and 
meekness, and by love unfeigned ; * * * 

Let thy bowels also be full of charity towards all men, and to the 
household of faith, and let virtue garnish thy thoughts unceasingly; 
then shall thy confidence wax strong in the presence of God; and the 
doctrine of the Priesthood shall distil upon thy soul as the dews from 
heaven. 

I am sure that we have received great blessings, great joys, and 
great happiness in this Conference, and I know that when we thank 
God for what we possess and what we are, we can do it with a better 
understanding and a fuller meaning, so that God Himself will know

that we do those things which we have been taught and trained to 
do, which have been revealed by Him. May He give to us grace, 
peace, courage, and above everything else a desire to do that which 
is right, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

ELDER RICHARD L. EVANS 

Of the First Council of the Seventy 

I have been thrilled since the opening of this Conference with 
each of the statements of my brethren, as I am sure you have been, 
beginning with the greeting from President Grant, continuing with 
the broad, enlightening view of the past year, and the deep and 
solemn admonitions for the year to come by President Clark, and 
continuing down through the remainder of the speakers. 

I was thrilled this morning to have with us President McKay 
and to hear his remarks, as I know all of you were. 

RECORDS MADE BY LEADING BRETHREN 

When I came to my present calling in the Church I thought per- 
haps I should make something of a reputation in some field or an- 
other, and I looked around to see what records might be available 
that could be acquired. I saw that some of my brethren had acquired, 
justifiably, a reputation for being authorities in the field of doctrine 
— some were trained in the professions — some in law, some in the 
sciences ; and I concluded that about the only record that was left 
for me to strive for was that of brevity of expression, but I antici- 
pated no such cooperation from the presiding officer in helping me 
to achieve this record as I have had here today. (Laughter.) 

SPEECHES THAT WERE NOT DELIVERED 

I think it was just about a year ago at this hour that a similar 
situation had arisen, and Dr. Widtsoe was called upon to speak. He 
advised us that he had a prepared talk in his pocket, but there was 
no time to deliver it and he would probably deliver it at the next Con- 
ference. I think he did not deliver it at the next Conference, how- 
ever, and my curiosity, fully equal to that of a woman on this partic- 
ular subject, got the better of me, and-I have asked him several times 
since what that talk was about. He has merely smiled, and I do not 
know yet. 

I think my retaliation at this time will be of like character. I 
have a talk in my pocket. It was to have been a very good one. 
(Laughter.) It is still a very good one, but it is not for the ears of 
this congregation. I am not above borrowing time from my brethren 
here on the stand, but there is no one left to borrow it from except 
the congregation, and I refuse to do that. 

A TESTIMONY AS TO TITHING 

. I should like to say one thing more. I was happy to hear the 



146 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Sunday. April 7 Third Dag 

remarks yesterday of Brother Joseph Fielding Smith concerning the 
subject of tithing, and the brief but forceful message given in the 
Priesthood meeting last night on the same subject by President 
Clark. I do not know what a full tithing means to you, but I know 
what it means to me by the teachings of my great and good mother 
whose presence I so sorely miss at this time. It has meant to me all 
the days of my life a tenth of every dollar that ever passed through 
my hands, whether by gift or as a reward for labor. I am grateful 
for that example and that teaching. 

I have thought at times that I would like to put the Lord in my 
debt, but have found that it is impossible to do so, and I commend to 
all of you who have not experienced the surpassing joy of attempting 
to do so that you. do it. No one with whom you have any business 
in this world or out of it will repay you so surely or so generously. 
That is my testimony ; it has proved to be so in my own life, and I 
know it will in the life of every Latter-day Saint who will take this 
principle of the Gospel and live it and reap from it all the material 
and spiritual rewards that come therefrom. 

I wish to leave you my testimony this day, that I know that God 
lives as well as I know any of the material facts of life, or anything 
that I can reach out and touch with my hand ; that Jesus is the 
Christ, and that Joseph Smith was a prophet of God, as have been 
all his successors, including our present leader, President Heber J. 
Grant, whom I pray God will increase in health and strength and re- 
turn to us, and I speak it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, Amen. 

ELDER MARK B. GARFF 

Former President of the Danish Mission 

"Blessed is he who endureth to the end." 

I bring the good greetings and the love of the Danish people who 
belong to the Church, to President Grant, President Clark, President 
McKay, the Council of the Twelve, the Seven Presidents of Seventy, 
the Presiding Bishopric and the Presiding Patriarch of the Church. 
That is my first obligation to this group. 

My second obligation is that I shall extend the love of the 
Danish people to the congregation of the Church. That was their 
wish and their desire before I left that land. 

I express my appreciation to Elder Richard R. Lyman, Elder 
Joseph Fielding Smith, and Elder Sylvester Q. Cannon for their 
visits to the Danish Mission, for the inspiration that they brought. 
I am most grateful and thankful for the opportunity I have had of 
giving service, that I was an instrument in the hands of the Lord 
in helping to evacuate the missionaries from Europe under the juris- 
diction and leadership of Elder Joseph Fielding Smith. I learned to 
love him and I appreciate him. Even though we were eight thou- 
sand miles from the First Presidency of the Church of Jesus Christ, 
yet I am sure that the same inspiration dominated all of us, and your 



ELDER MARK B. GARFF 



147 



sons and your daughters returned to the land of Zion, "a choice 
land above all other lands," because of the inspiration that our 
Heavenly Father granted unto His servants. 

There is one thought that I would like to leave with you, and 
that thought is this : Why are you here today ? Why are you not in 
war-torn Europe? Why aren't bombs falling on you? This is the 
only place in the world today — the United States — where there is 
any religious security, it is the only place where there is any guar- 
antee of religious security, and why are you here ? Why have you 
been so blessed? Because the Lord God talked to Joseph Smith and 
gave him commandments concerning the peoples of the earth; that 
he should go, and that he should send others to preach the Gospel to 
the nations of the earth. Some humble missionary left Salt Lake 
City, or left some other city, and went into far-away Denmark, into 
far-away Norway, and into far-away Germany, and other nations and 
sought out our parents, our grandparents, our great grandparents, 
and because the Lord sent those men we are enjoying the blessings 
of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. We are not Americans, a great part 
of us, because of any choice of our own, but because missionaries 
went to that land and brought us here. We owe that to the Gospel 
of Jesus Christ ; we owe it to the Church. 

If for no other reason I paid my tithing I would pay it because 
some humble missionary brought my grandparents to this country. 
I have an opportunity for religious freedom ; I have an opportunity 
for economic security ; I have an opportunity to hear the voice of 
the prophet of the living God, and oh how grateful I am that I have 
a testimony of the Gospel of Jesus Christ ! How grateful I am that 
some missionary sought out my grandparents ! How blessed am I 
that I have had the opportunity of rendering service in the Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints! I say this to you in all sin- 
cerity. The greatest thing that you and I can do is to give more 
richly than we have received. 

I bear witness to you as a servant of God that He lives, and that 
His coming is near at hand. I bear witness to you that the door is 
opening, for He said a hundred years ago that His coming was near 
at hand, even at our very door, and the Lord will show unto the na- 
tions, and unto you, and unto all mankind that that which the proph- 
ets have said is true. 

As recorded in the first section of the Doctrine and Covenants, 
the Lord said the time would come that they who would not hear the 
voice of His servants, the voice of the prophets, and the voice of the 
Apostles, would be cut off from among the people, and that has 
happened. 

God grant that we may appreciate the fact that we are Ameri- 
cans. Do not sell your birthright for a mess of pottage. Do not 
barter your freedom away. Do not trade your Constitution for all 
the things and all the thoughts that are propounded by men, for they 
would steal from you your freedom, and the Gospel, and your soul 
for the almighty dollar. God lives. This is the Gospel of Jesus 



148 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Sunday, April 7 Third Day 

Christ, and I bear you my testimony in the name of Jesus Christ, 
Amen. 

PRESIDENT J. REUBEN CLARK, JR. 

First Counselor in the First Presidency 

I feel that I owe an apology to the other brethren because our 
trouble here runs back to the beginning; I talked too much the first 
day. So Brother Jacobs of the Palestine-Syrian Mission, Brother 
A. Richard Peterson of the Norwegian Mission, and later, Brother 
John A. Israelson of the Norwegian Mission, we shall hear from 
you next time. 

I might say just a word myself. I wish sincerely to thank the 
brethren and sisters for the prayers which they have offered up in 
my behalf. Only the Lord Himself knows how much I needed help. 
This has been my first experience, I hope it is my last. I am grateful 
for the Spirit of the Lord that has been with us. I am grateful for 
the blessings that have come from the testimonies of the brethren 
who have spoken, and grateful that we have been able to let Presi- 
dent Grant hear this great Conference. 

I also leave my testimony with you of the truth of this great 
work in which we are engaged. I ask God to bless us always, in the 
name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

I wish to thank the choir for the music rendered at this Confer- 
ence, beautiful and inspirational it has been as always. 

An anthem, "Worthy is the Lamb, and 'Amen,'" (Handel), 
was sung by the Choir. 

Elder Heber J. Burgon, President of the East Jordan Stake, 
offered the benediction. 

Conference adjourned sine die. 



The musical exercises at the Friday sessions were furnished by 
the Brigham Young University Chorus, under the joint direction 
of Dr. Franklin W. Madsen and Dr. Florence Jepperson Madsen ; at 
the Saturday sessions, by the Ricks College Choir, John M. Ander- 
son, Director; and at the Sunday services by the Tabernacle Choir, 
J. Spencer Cornwall, Director. 

The congregational singing was directed by J. Spencer Corn- 
wall and Richard P. Condie. 

Accompaniments and interludes on the great organ were played 
by Alexander Schreiner and Frank W. Asper. Organ accompani- 
ments and solo presentations for the Tabernacle Choir and Organ 
Broadcast Sunday morning were played by Frank W. Asper. 



Stenographic notes of the Conference were taken by Frank W. 
Otterstrom and Joseph Anderson. 

Joseph Anderson 

Clerk of the Conference.

Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith 



Taken from his sermons and writings as they are found in the Documentary 
History and other publications of the Church and written or published in 
the days oi the Prophet's ministry 

Selected and arranged by the Historian, Joseph Fielding Smith, and his 
Assistants in the Historian's Office of the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints. 

Many of these discourses and writings appear in the Documentary 
History of the Church, but others have not been included in these volumes, 
but are scattered through the early publications of the Church. It has 
been difficult even for the student to obtain these because the old publica- 
tions are not accessible for general use.

song." 

So writes the author, George D. Pyper, in this fascinating story of an 
essential feature in the lives of a culture loving people. 

Well illustrated throughout, this work will take a high place in literary 
circes, and will win a permanent spot in the hearts of all lovers of great 
and good music.

LIFE OF JOSEPH F. SMITH 

Sixth President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints 
By JOSEPH FIELDING SMITH 

From the day of his birth until the day of his passing — four score 
years — there was scarcely a day that was not filled with intense and in- 
teresting activity. He commenced life in the midst of tribulation and 
dark persecution, and through the greater part of his life he was called 
upon to face the spirit of hate and wickedness, to a degree almost beyond 
human endurance. 

This volume dedicated to a man among men with the faith of the 
prophets of old. Its worth in your library is incomprehensible and its pres- 
ence, when read, will give words of wisdom and words of courage.

The hour has come to open the One Hundred and Eleventh Annual 
Conference of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Presi- 
dent Heber J. Grant is present and presiding; he has asked President 
Clark to conduct the meeting. 

We are grateful to greet this great audience that promises to crowd

ference will be broadcast over KFXD at Nampa; KSEI at Pocatello ;

Elder Joseph Anderson, Clerk of the Conference, offered the invo- 
cation. 

The Choir sang "O Come, Let Us Worship" — Mendelssohn. 

PRESIDENT J. REUBEN CLARK, JR. 

First Counselor in the First Presidency 

We are more grateful than we can say that President Grant is here 
with us, as already announced, and he will now address us. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

It is a source of great satisfaction to me to meet with the Latter- 
day Saints in this Conference. 

I am grateful for the many blessings we enjoy as a people. I know 
the Lord is mindful of us and will be to an even greater extent if we but 
serve Him. 

ADMONITION TO THE SOLDIER BOYS 

It grieves me deeply that it is necessary for thousands of our boys 
to go into the army. I hope and pray that they will go out with the 
missionary spirit, maintain their ideals and come back to us as sweet and 
clean as when they went away. I trust that it will be possible to keep 
them out of this terrible war. You parents and loved ones keep as close 
to them as you possibly can. 

OFFICERS AND TEACHERS MUST SET EXAMPLE 

I have made this statement to the leadership of this Church at 
times previous, but I feel to repeat it again at this time. 

"I ask every man and woman occupying a place of responsibility 
whose duty it is to teach the Gospel of Jesus Christ to live it and keep 
the commandments of God, so that their example will teach it ; and if 
they cannot live it, we will go on loving them, we will go on putting our 
arms around them, we will go' on praying for them that they may become 
strong enough to live it. But unless they are able to live it we ask them 
to please step aside so that those who are living it can teach it. No man 
can teach the Gospel of Jesus Christ under the inspiration of the Living 
God and with power from on high unless he is living it. He can go on 
as a member and we will pray for him, no matter how many years it 
may require, and we will never put a block in his way, because the 
Gospel is one of love and forgiveness, but we want true men and women 
as our officers in the Priesthood and in the Relief Society." 

And a man has no right to be a member of a Stake Presidency, a 
member of a High Council, a member of a Bishopric, or of any General 
Board, who cannot stand up and say that he knows the Gospel is true 
and is keeping the commandments of the Lord to His people. 



4 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Friday, April 4 First Day 

RESPONSIBILITY IN THE CHURCH BRINGS HUMILITY 

At this time I feel that I could say nothing to you that would bet- 
ter portray my testimony and my love of God than to give in substance 
what I said to the English Saints nearly four years ago. 

"It has never ceased to be a wonder to me that I do represent the 
Lord here upon the earth. My association from childhood with the re- 
markable and wonderful men that have preceded me has made it almost 
overwhelming to think of being in the same class with them. 

"The last words uttered by President Joseph F. Smith were to the 
effect, when he shook hands with me — he died that night — 'The Lord 
bless you, my boy, the Lord bless you ; you have got a great responsibility. 
Always remember this is the Lord's work and not man's. The Lord is 
greater than any man. He knows whom he wants to lead His Church, 
and never makes any mistake. The Lord bless you.' 

"I have felt my own lack of ability. In fact when I was called as 
one of the Apostles I arose to my feet to say it was beyond anything I 
was worthy of, and as I was rising the thought came to me, 'You know 
as you know that you live that John Taylor is a prophet of God, and 
to decline this office when he had received a revelation is equivalent to 
repudiating the Prophet.' I said, T will accept the office and do my 
best.' I remember that it was with difficulty that I took my seat with- 
out fainting. 

EARLY EXPERIENCE AS AN APOSTLE 

"There are two spirits striving with us always, one telling us to 
continue our labor for good, and one telling us that with the faults and 
failings of our nature we are unworthy. I can truthfully say that from 
October, 1882, until February, 1883, that spirit followed me day and 
night telling me that I was unworthy to be an Apostle of the Church, 
and that I ought to resign. When I would testify of my knowledge that 
Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the Living God, the Redeemer of man- 
kind, it seemed as though a voice would say to me : 'You lie ! You lie ! 
You have never seen Him.' 

"While on the Navajo Indian reservation with Brigham Young, 
Jr., and a number of others, six or eight, on horseback, and several others 
in 'white tops' — riding along with Lot Smith at the rear of that proces- 
sion, suddenly the road veered to the left almost straight, but there was 
a well beaten path leading ahead. I said : 'Stop, Lot, stop. Where does 
this trail lead? There are plenty of foot marks and plenty of horses' 
hoof marks here.' He said, 'It leads to an immense gulley just a short 
distance ahead, that it is impossible to cross with a wagon. We have 
made a regular "Muleshoe" of miles here to get on the other side of the 
gulley.' 

"I had visited the day before the spot where a Navajo Indian had 
asked George A. Smith, Jr., to let him look at his pistol. George A. 
handed it to him, and the Navajo shot him. 

"I said, 'Lot, is there any danger from Indians ?' 

" 'None at all.' 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT

" 'I want to be all alone. Go ahead and follow the crowd.' I first 
asked him if I allowed the animal I was riding to walk if I would reach 
the road on the other side of the gulley before the horsemen and the 
wagons, and he said, 'Yes.' 

"As I was riding along to meet them on the other side I seemed to 
see, and I seemed to hear, what to me is one of the most real things in 
all my life, I seemed to see a Council in Heaven. I seemed to hear the 
words that were spoken. I listened to the discussion with a great deal 
of interest. The First Presidency and the Council of the Twelve Apostles 
had not been able to agree on two men to fill the vacancies in the Quorum 
of the Twelve. There had been a vacancy of one for two years, and a 
vacancy of two for one year, and the Conference had adjourned with- 
out the vacancies being filled. In this Council the Savior was present, 
my father was there, and the Prophet Joseph Smith was there. They 
discussed the question that a mistake had been made in not filling those 
two vacancies and that in all probability it would be another six months 
before the Quorum would be completed, and they discussed as to whom 
they wanted to occupy those positions, and decided that the way to 
remedy the mistake that had been made in not filling these vacancies was 
to send a revelation. It was given to me that the Prophet Joseph Smith 
and my father mentioned me and requested that I be called to that posi- 
tion. I sat there and wept for joy. It was given to me that I had done 
nothing to entitle me to that exalted position, except that I had lived a 
clean, sweet life. It was given to me that because of my father having 
practically sacrificed his life in what was known as the great Reforma- 
tion, so to speak, of the people in early days, having been practically a 
martyr, that the Prophet Joseph and my father desired me to have that 
position, and it was because of their faithful labors that I was called, 
and not because of anything I had done of myself or any great thing 
that I had accomplished. It was also given to me that that was all these 
men, the Prophet and my father, could do for me; from that day it de- 
pended upon me and upon me alone as to whether I made a success of 
my life or a failure. 

RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE GOOD 

There is a law, irrevocably decreed in Heaven before the founda- 
tions of this world, upon which all blessings are predicated, and when 
we obtain any blessing from God, it is by obedience to that law upon 
which it is predicated. 

"It was given to me, as I say, that it now depended upon me. 

"No man could have been more unhappy than I was from October 
1882, until February, 1883, but from that day I have never been bother- 
ed, night or day, with the idea that I was not worthy to stand as an 
Apostle, and I have not been worried since the last words uttered by 
Joseph F. Smith to me: "The Lord bless you, my boy, the Lord bless 
you ; you have got a great responsibility. Always remember this is the 
Lord's work and not man's. The Lord is greater than any man. He 
knows whom He wants to lead His Church, and never makes any mis.- 
take. The Lord bless you.' 



6 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Friday. April 4 First Day 

"I have been happy during the twenty-two years that it has fallen 
my lot to stand at the head of this Church. I have felt the inspiration of 
the Living God directing me in my labors. From the day that I chose a 
comparative stranger to be one of the Apostles, instead of my lifelong 
and dearest living friend, I have known as I know that I live, that I am 
entitled to the light and the inspiration and the guidance of God in di- 
recting His work here upon this earth ; and I know, as I know that I live, 
that it is God's work, and that Jesus Christ is the Son of the Living God, 
the Redeemer of the world and that He came to this earth with a divine 
mission to die upon the cross as the Redeemer of mankind, atoning for 
the sins of the world. 

JOY IN PREACHING THE GOSPEL 

" 'As in Adam all die, so in Christ shall all be made alive.' I have 
had real, genuine joy; I have had joy in lifting my voice in England, 
Ireland, Scotland and Wales, Belgium, Holland, Switzerland, Germany, 
France, Italy, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, and Czechoslovakia, in the 
Hawaiian Islands and far-off Japan, in Canada on the north and Mexico 
on the south, in nearly every State of the Union, proclaiming my absolute 
knowledge that God lives, that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the Living 
God, the Redeemer of the world, and that I know that Joseph Smith 
was a prophet of the true and the Living God, and that the men who 
have succeeded him in presiding over this Church are the men God 
desired to stand in that position. 

"I do not make this statement because of any desire to magnify 
myself — I love the Gospel of Jesus Christ as I love nothing else in this 
world. I am here today for the reason that I desire to leave here my 
testimony as an old man — because a man who is in his 85th year is an 
old man. ( 

WORK OF FORMER PRESIDENTS OF CHURCH 

"John Taylor came to the presidency of this Church succeeding 
Brigham Young, when he was 72 years of age. Wilford Woodruff 
came to the presidency of this Church after he was eighty-odd years of 
age, and he lived to be more than ninety. Lorenzo Snow came to the 
presidency of this Church when he was 85 years of age, and served it 
in a most miraculous and wonderful way for three years. Joseph F. ' 
Smith came to the presidency of this Church when he was two years 
beyond the time of retirement, namely, 62 years of age, and he served 
for exactly eighteen years, and I have served for twenty-two years. It 
is only fair to you to say that I never for one minute believed that he 
was going to die, until the night he passed away and when he took hold 
of my hand, and told me what I have quoted to you. I felt in my heart 
and I had prayed for it ; I had fasted for it ; I had asked for it ; that he 
should live to celebrate the one hundredth anniversary of the birth of 
this Church, seeing that his beloved father, the Patriarch, Hyrum Smith, 
had been murdered for the Cause ; and I believed that he would so live, 
.until I received that message, which was the last message he spoke to 
anybody. 



FINANCIAL STATEMENT

"May God bless me and you and every soul that has a knowledge of 
the divinity of this work, to so live it that our lives will proclaim it to all 
those with whom we come in contact, is my humble prayer, and I ask it 
in all humility in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, our Redeemer and 
Savior. Amen." 

PRESIDENT J. REUBEN CLARK, JR. 

First Counselor in the First Presidency 

President Grant : We are deeply grateful and profoundly touched 
by your message. We need you, and love you, and we admire your

year times 2,080, average number of missionaries,

might have earned if at home of 1,872,000.00 

Total estimated contribution of missionaries and their 

families for preaching the gospel $2,700,182.65 

You will be interested in the following brief report from President 
Thomas E. McKay, President of the European Mission, regarding the 
Missions in Europe : 



REPORT OF CONDITIONS IN THE EUROPEAN MISSIONS 

It is more than a year now since the 699 American missionaries 
laboring in the twelve missions classified as European were released 
to come home or were transferred to missions in America. At the 
time of the evacuation, capable local brethren were placed in charge, 
and they are carrying on the work quite successfully. Because of 
mobilization and war, nearly all of our brethren of military age have 
been called to the front, and the work is having to be taken care of 
by the elderly brethren and the sisters. 

However, our Sacrament meetings, Sunday Schools, and Relief 
Societies, and Mutuals to a limited extent, are being held. Because of a 
shortage of fuel, and blackouts, most of these meetings must be held in 
the day time, and are combined, or one is held immediately following 
the other. 

In spite of these handicaps, progress is being made. The district 
and annual conferences are being held. Limited missionary work is 
being done, especially in the British Mission where the brethren hold- 
ing the Melchizedek Priesthood are excused from army service. Bap- 
tisms are reported from all the missions. Tithing and Fast Offerings 
are being paid, collections of food and clothing are made quite regu- 
larly, and the less fortunate of the members are being well cared for. 

The following paragraph, taken from the Norwegian Mission 
Report, is typical of reports from a number of the missions: 

"Many of the Saints have lost all they own — home, property, 
work. All they have left is the clothes they wear. Many have taken 
part in the fights, but their lives are spared. These hardest afflicted 
of the Saints have not lost their faith. They have seen that even if 
they have lost everything else, God has saved their lives." 

Because of the extremely heavy bombings recently in the British 
Isles the First Presidency were very much relieved, and we are sure 
you will be, to learn in a letter received today, dated London, March 
IS, stating among other encouraging news the following: 

"The conditions of the British Mission are about the same. All 
the branches are functioning and we have had no casualties or damage 
within the last two months." 

A previous letter had reported damage to the leased property at 
295 Edge Lane, Liverpool, where the Millennial Star was published 
and the bookstore located. These activities are now carried on at 
our headquarters at 149 Nightingale Lane, London. 

Except in Paris, France, the headquarters of all the missions,

including the Czechoslovakian and Palestine-Syrian Missions, are 
being maintained as usual, and very encouraging reports are being 
received from all the Acting Mission Presidents. They all say: "Don't 
worry about us, we are all right — we have the Gospel."

16 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Friday, April i First Day 

REPORT OF THE CHURCH AUDITING COMMITTEE 

Elder Orval W. Adams, at the request of President Clark, read the 
following report : 

President Heber J. Grant and Counselors, 
Dear Brethren: 

We have examined the Financial report of the Church for the 
year 1940. The records are complete, accurate and intelligible; the 
accounting system is adequate and modern; the budget is in balance, 
and the Church is free from debt. 

Sincerely yours, 

Orval W. Adams 
Albert E. Bowen 
H. H. Bennett 
George S. Spencer 

Church Auditing Committee. 

PRESIDENT J. REUBEN CLARK, JR. 

First Counselor in the First Presidency 

My brethren and sisters, while I stand before you I trust that the 
Lord will lead me to say something that will be helpful, uplifting, and 
encouraging. 

You have heard the report read by President McKay, and there 
are certain things I should like to refer to briefly in that connection. 

First, let me say that we miss Elder Reed Smoot this morning, a 
man of valiant, able, and conspicuous service to his nation, and a man 
who I think has been the greatest single missionary of our time. 

You have already heard regarding the Saints in Europe. I may 
say that since our last Conference we have evacuated the missionaries 
from the Pacific Isles, Australia, and New Zealand, and have returned 
them, some to Hawaii, and the rest to the mainland. This evacuation was 
carried out speedily as was the one from Europe, and without any ac- 
cident or untoward incident. 

BUDGET IN BALANCE 

As Brother Orval Adams has told you, the budget is in balance. We 
have lived within our income ; the Church is not in debt. As I have 
said on a previous occasion we hope and intend, so far as we are able, to 
keep it this way; first, because we believe that is the way the Church 
should be run ; secondly, because we believe we should set the example in 
handling your trust funds, you members of the Church; thirdly, be- 
cause, for what it may be worth, we would like to set an example that 
might be followed by our own governmental agencies. 

During the last year we spent more for stake and ward purposes ; 
education, temples, and relief assistance, than we spent in 1939. We 
spent less for missionary work, due probably entirely to the withdrawal 
from foreign fields, and we spent less in hospitals, largely due to the 
fact that the hospitals are becoming better business institutions, and are 
maintaining themselves. 



PRESIDENT J. REUBEN CLARK, JR. 



17 



As might be expected, and as ought to be, in view of the employment 
which is now being furnished and has been for some months, there were 
18,294 fewer persons receiving relief from the Church in 1940 than in 
1939. This load should lessen, but I should like to urge all presidents 
of stakes, bishops and counselors, the auxiliaries, and the Welfare' or- 
ganizations to remember that the major part of the employment which 
we now have available is for war purposes and war industries, and when 
this war is over those industries will cease ; those employed in them will 
be thrown out of work; it will take considerable time for readjustment, 
and the need for your Welfare program as planned will be greatly in- 
tensified. 

URGES CARE IN SPENDING 

We are trying as best we can to spend your funds, which you have 
given to the Lord, wisely; we are trying to make no commitments that 
we cannot meet in the matter of buildings and other activities so num- 
erous in which the Church is engaged. We are trying not unduly to ex- 
pand our activities. We are being very careful and ask you brethren, 
(and we rejoice beyond expression to have so many bishops and presi- 
dents of stakes here at this Conference, perhaps the greatest number that 
has ever assembled at any individual Conference of the Church) we are 
asking you brethren, in making up your building program, to remember 
that you are on a rising market ; that you cannot tell just what your 
materials are going to cost ; therefore we urge you to be careful in the 
making of your estimates. 

In the spending of tithing funds, we are trying to spend them for 
the welfare of communities rather than for the welfare of particular 
individuals. The Church is not a banking institution, and while, through 
our Welfare organization, we are helping individuals, that is done upon 
the recommendation of the quorum to which the individual belongs, and 
with their guarantee. If we were to undertake to lend to everybody 
who needs help there would be no money left for the regular activities 
of the Church. 

We are trying to practice economy, and particularly in our buying, 
because, I repeat, we are spending funds marked with the highest kind 
of a trust, and so we urge you brethren, you bishops, you presidents of 
stakes, in your buying, to get the most that you can for your money. 
These funds are not given to you to spend to help some particular per- 
son in whom you have a special interest, however worthy that person 
may be, unless he can give you the service for his funds. 

We are trying not to build magnificent cathedrals, but serviceable 
meeting houses, and would like you brethren and sisters to have that in 
mind when you are planning for the expenditure of funds. 

GRATITUDE EXPRESSED FOR GENEROSITY OF SAINTS 

Our Fast Offerings, to which Brother McKay alluded, have in- 
creased, in the average, (there is only a slight increase over 1939) — the 
average this year was 83 cents, as he stated, and 82.2 in 1939. 



18 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Friday, April i First Day 

Twenty-eight stakes in 1939 paid more than a dollar; 45 in 1940. 
But we missed some of the excellent records that were made by stakes in 
1939, and the maximum of 1940 was not so great for a stake as it was in 
1939. 

We have begun and are pushing to completion the Idaho Falls 
Temple. We have erected a memorial building to Joseph Smith on the 
Brigham Young University campus. We have been adding Welfare 
storehouses, and in addition we have been carrying on the regular build- 
ing of the Church. 

I would like to thank the people on behalf of the General Authorities 
for their generosity, their loyalty, their service in carrying on the tem- 
poral affairs of the Church as well as the spiritual affairs. The Lord 
has in this Church combined the spiritual and the temporal very closely 
and we therefore have both as a part of our mission, and, I repeat, the 
First Presidency and the General Authorities of the Church are grateful 
beyond expression for your services of the past. 

PERILS OF TIMES 

Now, I have not time to touch on more of those matters, although 
there are several others that deserve mention, but I want to read some- 
thing to you to conclude my remarks. 

The perils of these times justify some comment. May I be pardon- 
ed if I repeat now some things I have said on other occasions. 

In September, 1923, eighteen years ago, at a religious service in this 
Tabernacle, I mentioned certain trends I then saw. They were : a spirit 
of revolution that threatened the very foundations of government every- 
where, indeed the destruction of the existing bodies politic of the world ; 
the unrestricted immigration of aliens who were foreign and in tradi- 
tion hostile to our systems of government ; the enhancement of the power 
of the Federal Executive ; the breaking down of the mutual independence 
of the three branches of government, — executive, judicial, and legislative ; 
the disappearance of local self government and the assumption of control 
by the Federal Government of the very details of our lives; the curtail- 
ment of our constitutional guarantees under the Bill of Rights ; the build- 
ing of class in our nation and of class conflict and hatred ; the spread of 
Bolshevism, we call it Communism now, working for the overthrow of 
our government, the doing away with religion, even the overturning of 
our family relationships. 

During the eighteen years passed since then, I have on all opportuni- 
ties repeated these observations. 

I will leave you to make up your own minds how far these trends 
have become realities. 

NO MAN SEES END 

No thinking person doubts that our people, our nation, and the 
world are now passing through one of the great crises of the world's 
history. We are in the midst of a world-wide revolution, which is wholly 
alien to our free institutions and is foreign in birth, concept, and directing 



PRESIDENT J. REUBEN CLARK, JR. 



19 



head. No man, of his own power, sees the end. But the end the revolu- 
tionists seek is fairly clear; it is the overturning of the whole existing 
order, political, financial, economic, social, religious, the complete destruc- 
tion of our Constitution and the government established under it, and then 
the setting up of some sort of despotism that shall destroy, in all these 
fields, the free agency which the Lord gave to man. The revolutionists 
plan that this is to be largely done during the war, under the plea of war 
necessity; it is to be continued after the war under the excuse — if we 
are not then too cowed to require an excuse — that this new political order 
is necessary that we may rehabilitate the world. They count that then, 
after a little time, the revolution will be secure. There seems no doubt 
that this is their conscious, deliberate, planned end. We have gone a 
long way already down this road. 

OUR DUTY TO SUSTAIN THE CONSTITUTION 

Knowing as we do that God set up this Constitution of ours and that 
He has declared it "should be maintained for the rights and protection 
of all flesh, according to just and holy principles," (D. & C. 101 :77) it 
is the duty of every member of the Church to protect and defend the 
Constitution against any and all attack. In this country our lawful poli- 
tical allegiance runs not to any man, not to any party, not to any "ism," 
but to the Constitution of the United States and to the free institutions 
set up under it. There can be no tampering with the "just and holy 
principles" of the Constitution. No true Latter-day Saint can or will do 
other than reverence the Constitution ; each will do all in his power to 
save it from pollution or destruction. 

FORMER PREDICTIONS REPEATED 

For the past several Conferences, I have spoken about world condi- 
tions. In the April Conference of 1937, I said : 

.... there is strongest reason for believing that some of the most 
skilled, astute, and shrewd diplomats, politicians, and statesmen of all 
Europe are now planning to have the people of the United States 
finance the next European war either before the war begins or during 
its progress. 

I continued: 

Furthermore, certain of these same diplomats, politicians, and 
statesmen are planning to entice the United States into an offensive 
and defensive military alliance in order that we shall participate in that 
next world war by sending our young men to the battlefields of Europe. 
The argument they now plan to use to bring this about is that in this 
way only can the peace of the world be preserved. While this is a 
most profound fallacy, it will unfortunately find a sympathetic ear 
among many of the people of this country who do not fully understand 
international relations. It will require the wisest statesmanship on 
our part to prevent the United States from becoming again the victim 
of a world military catastrophe. 

I need make no comment about these statements.

Friday, April 4 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



First Day 



TO BE PEACEMAKERS THE DESTINY OF AMERICA 

This war began as a war for empire. This is an unrighteous cause. 
A war to enlarge and maintain empire of conquest is no better. This 
war continues for these two objects. All other issues urged in this con- 
test are merely ancillary to the getting or keeping of empire. America 
has no place as a belligerent in such a conflict. We do have a place in 
the world by Divine design and destiny as the makers of a lasting peace, 
but we must come to this task not as joint conquerors but with clean 
hands and a contrite spirit, bearing in our hands the olive branch of peace, 
spiritual hope, and righteousness. 

We have heard that our help in the conflict was always to be short 
of war ; but we have for many months been in fact actual participants in 
the war. 

We have also been told our sons would not be sent abroad to fight, 
but American vessels on both of our coasts are reported now actually 
making ready for use as troop transports. 

It does look as if only Divine intervention of some kind can keep 
our sons on our own soil, fighting for our own cause, in defense of our 
own freedom and liberties. 

We all have the deepest sympathy for the woe and misery which 
afflict the innocent peoples of Europe. We join them in sorrowing for 
lost loved ones. We pray to the Lord to mitigate their suffering and 
assuage their grief. But we need not be so much concerned about poli- 
tical Europe. This war is merely the outbreaking of old political hatreds 
that have festered in Europe for a thousand years. They have never 
been fully wiped out before ; they will not after this war is over. Our 
great concern is that this endemic yet virulent infection shall not spread 
to America and leave us with an incurable malady. 

I have before urged and I now urge that we put hate away from 
us, because it is the hates from the last war that have made this one. 
Hate and righteousness cannot dwell in the same heart. Hate cankers 
the soul and destroys spirituality. Hate has no place in the hearts of the 
followers of Jesus. 

A CHOICE LAND 

With infinite patience, infinite mercy, infinite love, the Lord has tried 
to lead His children of this earth along the paths He has made for us, 
that we today might not become ripened in iniquity and subject to chas- 
tisement as were His children in the olden times. We who live on this 
hemisphere have a special blessing and a prescribed decree. This is 
the blessing : 

Behold, this is a choice land, and whatsoever nation shall possess 
it shall be free from bondage, and from captivity, and from all other 
nations under heaven, if they will but serve the God of the land, who 
is Jesus Christ. (Ether 2:12.) 

This is the decree : 

Wherefore he that doth possess it shall serve God or shall be swept 



PRESIDENT J. REUBEN CLARK, JR. 



21 



off; for it is the everlasting decree of God. And it is not until the 
fulness of iniquity among the children of the land, that they are swept 
off. (Ether 2:10.) 

May the Lord help us so to live that we enjoy the blessings and es- 
cape the decree. 

Too many of us of this land have not hearkened to the voice of the 
Lord, nor observed His laws and commandments. The offenses of the 
peoples of the earth have been great ; the eternal law seems to be that 
there must be an equal atonement. 

Jesus said to His disciples : 

"Woe unto the world because of offenses! for it must needs be 
that offenses come; but woe to that man by whom the offense cometh! 
(Matt. 18:7.) 

THE LORD'S PLANS WILL TRIUMPH 

But in all the afflictions we now have or that loom up ahead, it is 
my faith that the Lord is at the helm, for this is a major event in the 
history of man. It is my faith that nothing has happened and nothing 
will happen that is contrary to His plan or that is against His will. In 
the final event, God does not permit any trifling with His decrees. How- 
ever far afield men may wander, Righteousness and Truth finally triumph. 
Of these things I have the same knowledge that I have that I live. 

Of all peoples, we are, with this knowledge, the most blessed in the 
earth. Because, however dark may seem the days, we shall face our 
trials with the sure knowledge that God lives ; we know that He can hear 
and answer our prayers according to His wisdom ; we understand that 
we have an existence hereafter where we and our loved ones shall be 
forever safe from the ills of the flesh ; we know that we shall have eternal 
happiness if we live and die righteously; we know that the Lord will 
bless and protect wherever he may be, every man who lives the principles 
of the Gospel and who does his duty. 

PRAYER FOR PEACE 

We believe in peace. We are the devoted followers of the Prince of 
Peace. We abhor war, save in the actual defense of our homes, our fam- 
ilies, our liberties. For we remember that when Peter struck off with 
his sword the ear of Malchus, the servant of the High Priest, the Lord 
said: "All they that take the sword shall perish with the sword." (Matt. 
26:52) The Lord made no exceptions to His law. History has made 
none. 

We pray for peace. We pray that the Lord will keep the youth of 
America out of the European conflict. We ask Him to bring peace into 
the hearts of men. 

With all my heart I join in the anxiety and pray the prayer of Presi- 
dent Grant. God bless our boys and the boys of all America ! God bless 
the youth of the world, ignorant of the why of all this and innocent of 
any blame therefor. 

May the Lord bless us and increase our testimonies of the truth of 



22 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Friday. April 4 First Day 

His Gospel, for the day cometh when this shall be our greatest solace, 
and comfort, the sheet anchor which shall keep us from spiritual despair. 
God bless us, preserve us, increase our testimonies, help us to live the 
Gospel, I ask in the name of Jesus, Amen. 

PRESIDENT RUDGER CLAWSON 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

This is a very wonderful gathering. It looks very much like a Priest- 
hood meeting, but it is a general meeting of the members of the Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, a very important gathering. 

I was deeply impressed with the remarks made by President Grant. 
I am sure we are all very happy to have him with us, to take the lead 
and point out the way. The Lord bless him and heal him ! 

A VERY SATISFACTORY REPORT 

The statement read this morning by President McKay was and is 
perhaps the most elaborate and comprehensive statement ever made to 
the Church, both financially and socially, from this stand. The budget 
is balanced and the Church is out of debt. What excellent good news 
that is ! How we ought to rejoice and glorify the Lord for the prosperity 
and the faith and good works of the Latter-day Saints ! We feel relieved, 
we feel strengthened and encouraged when we can have such reports as 
those that were also commented upon by President Clark, and his further 
remarks this morning were indeed impressive and encouraging to the 
Latter-day Saints. It is hoped they will have a good effect throughout 
our country. 

GOSPEL PREACHED BY WORD AND EXAMPLE 

Brethren and sisters, the Lord has said in a revelation to Joseph 
Smith the Prophet — said it in more than one place in the scriptures — that 
salvation is the greatest gift of God to man, and that salvation comes by 
the preaching of the Gospel. The miracles and blessings that follow 
the preaching do not come before but come after the preaching to con- 
firm the faith of the Latter-day Saints and all who will receive the word 
of God. God does not give signs and miracles to make us believe, but 
rather to strengthen and help those who receive the message. 

I call your attention to an incident connected with the crucifixion of 
the Savior. It was his great mission to come to the earth, under the di- 
rection of His Father in Heaven, that His precious blood might be shed 
for the redemption of mankind. After His crucifixion, and just prior to 
His returning to Heaven, He delivered an important charge to His 
disciples in these words : 

Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature. 
He that beli'eveth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth 
not shall be damned. 



So I take it that that responsibility is upon those who are called to 



PRESIDENT RUDGER CLAWSON 



23 



preach the Gospel. There is nothing greater than to preach the word of 
God, to acknowlege His hand, to walk uprightly before Him, to be 
humble and faithful, and not only by word of mouth but also to preach 
the Gospel by example. We are making history individually and col- 
lectively, and so it is highly essential that our lives and example should 
conform with our preaching, and then it will be effective. 

MESSAGE PREACHED AT HOME AND ABROAD 

A good work is now being accomplished. We are calling young men 
and young women and some that are older into the mission field. They 
are soldiers of the cross. They go not to kill and destroy as in war, but 
to save and build up, and if we are all faithful and true to the Cause 
and exemplify our words by our lives the effect will be tremendous, 
and the effect as it is is very fine. The influence of the testimonies and 
exhortations that go out from this Conference unto the world at large 
will have a most salutary effect I am sure. 

Notable people and tourists traveling over the country, stopping at 
Salt Lake City are usually headed the first thing for the Temple Block ; 
they have heard about this wonderful Tabernacle which is like a testimony 
of the truth, where holy men have stood and taught the people. These 
visitors have been influenced and they marvel and wonder about it. Some 
of them investigate the Gospel ; they have reflected about this matter of 
tithing ; they have approved of it and they would like to know just how 
it is done. Of course we have to say that we regret that we cannot tell 
them just how to do it in their churches ; we know how to do it in our 
Church because it is a law of God given to us. Every individual who 
earns means in the Mormon Church is under the responsibility of ob- 
serving the law of tithing. It is not binding upon these other churches 
because they do not have the authority and the spirit to do it. The unity 
of this great congregation here — what it would mean if we were all per- 
fectly united, sitting under the voice of revelation, the voice of the 
Priesthood and the power of God — it is a wonderful thing ! We are a 
blessed people and have much to be thankful for. 

BEARS TESTIMONY 

I feel that it is a great privilege, brethren and sisters, to stand be- 
fore you and to bear my testimony and to say to you I know absolutely, 
without mental reservation, that this is the Church of Jesus Christ, the 
Son of God, and He is with us and His power and influence will uphold 
us, and we will have an instructive and wonderful time before the Con- 
ference closes. 

Peace be unto you, my brethren and sisters ; the Lord prosper you 
in every righteous undertaking, in every movement for the benefit and 
blessing of the people, I ask in the worthy name of the Lord Jesus 
Christ. Amen.

We are blessed again this afternoon with the presence of President 
Heber J. Grant, who is presiding, and he has asked President Clark to 
conduct the meeting. 

There are present on the stand this afternoon President Grant and 
his two Counselors; the eleven Apostles; all of the First Seven Presi- 
dents of Seventies ; and all the Presiding Bishopric. 

The congregation and the Brigham Young University Chorus and 
members of the Provo Duo Stake Choir sang the hymn, "How Firm a

Elder Charles S. Clark, President of the Cassia Stake, offered the 
opening prayer. 

The Choir sang "Glory to God in the Highest" — Pergolesi. 

ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

I wish all you fine people in the body of the house could see this 
audience from the stand. It is a wonderful sight, every seat filled and 
people standing, both in the doorways and in the gallery. 

I trust that I may be blessed of the Lord today, that I may express to 
you the feelings of my heart with reference to the work with which we 
are identified. After the wonderful session we had this morning I feel 
that it would be just too bad if I should try to talk myself and express 
my own personal feelings, unless the Lord helps me. 

THE COMMANDMENTS OF THE LORD GIVEN FOR OUR GOOD 

As I travel around among the people I am sometimes astonished to 
find that some appear to feel that they are doing the Lord a favor 



ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH 



25 



by belonging to His Church. They seem to have an idea that when they 
keep the commandments of the Lord, that they are doing something to 
please somebody else. 

I doubt that the people of the world realize that the reason they are 
in the predicament they are in today is because they have neglected to 
follow the advice of our Heavenly Father. The uncertainty, the distress, 
the anguish that is prevalent in so many parts of the world is traceable 
directly to violating His commandments. The Lord, when He gave to us 
the Ten Commandments, gave us advice for our good. It was not for 
His benefit, except that He is always happy when we do right. But I am 
thinking now of the commandments that came down from Sinai : "Thou 
shalt honor the Lord thy God, and Him only shalt thou serve." That was 
not to please Him. The advice that He gave in that regard, and else- 
where, has been for our good and for our benefit. 

■ When He commanded us that we should honor the Sabbath Day to 
keep it holy, He only gave us the information that would help us to 
enjoy our lives. That is all. 

"Thou shalt not steal." When that commandment was given it was 
intended that if people in this world would be honest, that they would 
derive the benefit. Only this morning our beloved President quoted a 
portion from the Doctrine and Covenants, referring to the laws that 
govern us : 

There is a law, irrevocably decreed in heaven from before the 
foundation of this earth, upon which every blessing is predicated. 

So the Lord, in His kindness, seeing the attitude of His children, 
and knowing that they would need guidance, gave to us the Ten Com- 
mandments, and other commandments that have been given from time 
to time, to help us to find happiness. You observe people running to and 
fro in the world, seeking happiness but not finding it. If they would only 
pause long enough to accept the Lord's advice happiness would follow, 
but they will find it in no other way. 

BLESSINGS FOLLOW THE KEEPING OF THE COMMANDMENTS 

It is strange that any member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Lat- 
ter-day Saints should have to be urged to say his prayers, and yet 
there are some people who do not pray in secret or have their family 
prayers. Yet unless we pray we lose the protection that prayer offers. 
(D. &C. Sec. 20:32-34.) 

The Lord has given us the privilege of contributing one-tenth of our 
interest, for His Church, for the development of His work in the world. 
Those who pay their tithing receive their blessing. If we do not desire the 
blessing, we may withhold our contribution. The Lord promises His 
blessing if we honor His law and not otherwise. 

Everything that He has asked us to do is for our good, not for 
somebody else's benefit particularly, though, of course, it benefits others 
when we set a good example. With this great body of Priesthood and 
the membership of the Church assembled here, what an influence we ought 
to have, if we are keeping the commandments of the Lord. 



26 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Friday, April $ First Day 

The President referred to the fact, this morning, that there were 
offices in the Church, and that men who hold those offices ought not to 
expect to hold them unless they magnify them. Why? Because they 
receive no benefit from it, only as they keep the commandments of the 
Lord and magnify their callings. It is of no particular advantage to be 
a High Priest or a Seventy or an Elder in this Church, just to hold that 
office. But if we live up to the teachings of the Lord, if we do what He 
asks us to do, then we have promise of a blessing. The Lord, all the 
years from the beginning of time, has been ready to bless His children 
whenever they will permit Him to do it. 

There are some who do things they ought not to do, and yet they hope 
for a blessing. We sing: "God Bless America." What a wonderful 
hymn that is ! How beautifully it is sung in large congregations ! But 
God cannot bless America if the people who live in America refuse to 
keep His commandments. We must earn the blessing if we would 
receive it. 

We are commanded by the Lord to teach our children what they 
should do, that they should have faith, that they should repent, and that 
they should be baptized when eight years of age ; and He says that if we 
fail in our responsibility, the sin be upon our heads. What does that mean ? 
It means, to me, that if our children fall away because of our neglect and 
because of our carelessness, there will come a time when we realize that 
we did not prepare them for the blessings the Lord wanted to give them, 
and the result is that they have failed to receive the blessings and the 
sorrow will be upon our own heads. 

I am grateful that I belong to a church that does not compel obedience. 
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints does not coerce. The 
Gospel of Jesus Christ is a gospel of love, intelligence, a wonderful guide 
for our lives. That is what it is for. It is for everybody. Yet we find 
people who resist the very thing that would make them happy. They will 
not live the Gospel but seek happiness only in the pleasures of life that 
will not endure. 

I think this great organization that we belong to ought to be able to 
set such an example that people in our neighborhoods, not members of 
the Church, seeing our good works, would be constrained to glorify the 
name of our Heavenly Father. That is the way I feel with regard to that. 
All that we need to do is to set an example, be good men and good women, 
and they will observe it. Then perhaps they will afford us the oppor- 
tunity to teach them the things that they do not know. 

Every blessing that we desire must be earned by obeying the law 
upon which that blessing is conditioned. Now, we understand that, 
brethren and sisters. How unwise we are if we fail, if we ourselves 
decline to do the thing that will earn us a blessing, when we know that 
we cannot obtain it in any other way except to earn it. That is the dif- 
ference in the attitude of those who understand the Gospel of Jesus 
Christ and the people of the world. I have had people tell me : "Oh, it 
doesn't make so much difference what you do. After a while everybody 
will be saved in the Kingdom of God." It used to be quite customary 
when I was in the mission field in early days, to hear that. That is what 



ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH 



27 



the devil is telling the world. That is the way the Adversary teaches. If 
he can just keep them doing wrong all the time, and neglecting that which 
is right, he has them just where he wants them to be, and he has us where 
he wants us, when we fail to do right. 

THE PRIESTHOOD TO BE HONORED 

To be ordained to the Priesthood may not prove a blessing. We 
should not at any time feel that it will be a blessing to us, unless we honor 
it, unless we magnify it, and have in our hearts the desire that the Lord 
intended we should have, when He bestowed that gift upon us, and we 
should always desire to do good. 

What a wonderful group we have enrolled in this organization! 
Lovers of all that is good and beautiful, marvelous choirs that come from 
different parts of the Church to sing for us here ; to supplement the de- 
light that the Tabernacle Choir and Organ give to us ; this lovely build- 
ing in which to meet, not another like it in the world. We have every 
blessing that the world has anywhere, plus the Gospel of Jesus Christ. 
Of course, the world does not understand it if we say it that way, but we 
ought to understand it. Everything that I can find that is good in any- 
church in all the world, is a part of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. No 
other church can say that. 

This is the Lord's Church. I sometimes hear people speak of it 
as "our church." This is the Lord's Church. Our Heavenly Father 
ordained that it should come at this particular period of the world's 
history, and He directed that it receive the name of His beloved Son. 
Fortunate are we if while we are members of it we live up to the op- 
portunities that it offers, lest we fall into transgression and lose our faith 
and forfeit the blessing that the Lord desired us to possess. 

ADVICE TO SEEK FOR IMPROVEMENT 

Now, brethren, let us do better than we have ever done before. Let 
us renew our determination to be real Latter-day Saints, and not just 
make-believe. I do not think I ought to be talking just like that to this 
group, because I feel that perhaps the cream of the Church, very much 
of it, is in this building; but I do not know anybody who can not do a 
little better than he has been doing, if he makes up his mind. 

I think that with the distress everywhere, with the prediction that the 
Lord made in the first Section of the Doctrine and Covenants, that 
"peace should be taken from the earth," we must feel that that time has 
come. Surely we ought to take stock of ourselves, and our homes should 
be the abiding place of prayer and gratitude and thanksgiving. Husbands 
should be kind to their wives, and wives considerate of their husbands. 
Parents should hold the love of their children by their righteous living. 
Our homes would then not only be the abiding place of prayer and thanks- 
giving, but would be the place where our Father could bestow His 
choicest blessings, because of our worthiness. 

I pray that the peace that cometh from our Heavenly Father may 
abide in our hearts and in our homes, that we who have been honored by 



28 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Friday, April i First Day 

fellowship in the Church of His Beloved Son may appreciate that honor 
every day, and so live when the race is run that we shall have earned an 
inheritance in the Celestial Kingdom. We must not surrender to tempta- 
tion, but should meet our problems in the spirit of love and kindness 
toward all men, ever serving God and keeping His commandments. And 
we are always serving Him when we are blessing our kind ; do not forget 
that. 

FAITH SHOWN BY GOOD WORKS 

We cannot expect to earn blessings without earnest effort. We 
will be required to make what appears to some to be sacrifices. I sup- 
pose people think when they pay their tithing that they are making a 
sacrifice, but they are not ; they are making a real investment that will 
return an eternal dividend. Our Heavenly Father gives us all that we 
have. He places all in our hands, authorizing us to retain for our own 
use nine-tenths of it, and then He asks that we put His tenth where He 
directs, where He knows it will accomplish the most good in developing 
His Church. 

When we heard the reports this morning of this great Church, the 
financial report impressed me much. To know that a great organization 
like this, with its multitudes of people, functioning in so many ways, in 
the midst of the world's turmoil and distress is in such a condition that 
one of the Presidency of the Church could stand here and truthfully 
say to us this Church is out of debt. With the nations and most of the 
people in debt, yet the Church has been so managed that it is out of debt. 
Let us think about it. Let us sustain the Church. Let us follow the 
advice of the leadership of the Church. Let us so live that the Lord 
can bless us as He blesses the Church. 

The Lord gave one commandment to the people, in which He said 
this was the only church in all the world that He is well pleased with, 
and He emphasized that by saying, or inferring at least, that that did not 
mean individually. That meant the Church as a whole. But how won- 
derful it would be if He could say of us that He is pleased with all of us 
as individuals. 

God grant that we may so live and let our light so shine that others, 
seeing our good works, will be constrained to glorify His name. Let 
there be in our hearts love and compassion and consideration and charity 
for every soul that we come in contact with. Then we can consistently 
kneel down in our own homes and invoke the favor of the Lord upon 
those that we love, and upon all those with whom we associate, and when 
life's labor is complete may we find that we have listened to the whisper- 
ing of that still, small voice that always guides us in the path of righteous- 
ness, and know that it has meant for us the opening of the door to the 
Celestial kingdom, for ourselves and those we love, to go forward 
throughout the ages, not unhappy eternally, but happy eternally, I 
humbly pray, in the name of Jesus Christ, our Lord. Amen.

ELDER ANTOINE R. IVINS 

Of the First Council of the Seventy 

My beloved brethren and sisters, it is with a sense of extreme re- 
sponsibility that I stand before you here this afternoon, realizing that 
to take your time is a responsible thing. I pray that you may all give 
me an interest in your faith and prayers, that the short time I stand 
before you I may enjoy a portion of the Spirit of God, our Heavenly 
Father. 

LOVE EXPRESSED FOR LEADERS 

I am extremely grateful this afternoon for the privilege I had this 
morning of listening to the testimony of my beloved uncle, the President 
of the Church. I hope he knows how deeply we all love him. I want 
to tell him that the Lord cannot extend his years too long to please us, 
who are so near to him. I believe that I echo the sentiments of this vast 
congregation when I say that. 

I am thankful, likewise, that the Lord has seen fit to spare to us, 
in the First Council of the Seventy, our very beloved Senior President, 
Brother Wells. There is nobody whom we love more than we do these 
men, and we would put with them Brother Clawson, who stands at the 
head of the Council of the Twelve. We associate with them very closely. 
We know their integrity and their devotion to the work of the Lord, 
and we would have naught but peace and joy, happiness and success to 
crown their future years. 

JOY IN MINISTERING AMONG THE LATTER-DAY SAINTS 

As we move about among the people we strive to serve you to the 
very best of our ability, realizing that we are your servants as well as 
the servants of God, our Heavenly Father. We make very many fine 
friends. I see many of them in the audience today, and I want to thank 
them for the kindly ministry that they have given unto us as we move 
about. 

In these visits it has been my privilege to talk with a great many 
of the officers of the Church, and to study the conditions that prevail 
throughout the Church, and I believe that we have the finest people on 
the earth, the finest because they have the purest belief in God, our 
Heavenly Father, a God to whom we can actually call for blessings, who 
will recognize that call, and minister unto us according to our wants. 

We would like, if we could, to find ways and means of helping each 
other to live nearer and closer to God our Heavenly Father, to observe 
better the principles of the Gospel, which we know to be the principles 
of life and salvation, life here in the earth, which will give us the very 
fullest possible growth and development, and a life hereafter, with our 
Heavenly Father. We struggle and we strive, with this aim and purpose. 
Sometimes we feel that we do not have a very great measure of success. 
But then frequently we find that we do sow seeds that grow and flourish 
and produce happiness and joy in the hearts of the people. That, it 



30 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Friday, April 4 First Day 

seems to me, is our major purpose — to help you to help each other to 
greater joy and happiness and success. 

MELCHIZEDEK PRIESTHOOD COMPARISONS 

One thing I have noticed, as I move about among the people, that 
I think maybe it would be worthwhile to call to your attention. You 
know we minister in the Priesthood especially, and we check the activities 
of the Priesthood throughout the Church. For more than a year I have 
been comparing the number of men holding the Melchizedek Priesthood, 
in the different Stakes which I have visited, with the number of families 
in the Stakes. It startled me almost past belief, the other day, to find in 
one Stake that I visited that there were possibly only 43 out of 100 fam- 
ilies with a representative in the Melchizedek Priesthood. 

Now, if we had an ideal condition prevailing, the only families not 
represented in the Melchizedek Priesthood would be the families of 
widows, because all of the men who are married would marry in the 
Temple, and all the young women who would marry would marry men 
who would marry in the Temple. But that does not seem to prevail. 

When there are as many, or as few as 43 out of 100 represented in 
the Melchizedek Priesthood, there seems to be a condition that we might 
well pay attention to. It runs all the way from 43 to above 95. I visited 
one Stake where that comparison was as high as 95. That seems to me 
to be almost an ideal condition. Now, somewhere in between there will 
be a happy medium. That is what we ought to seek, at least the happy 
medium. Let us strive to increase that proportion, by teaching our 
young people the advisability of marrying within the Church. Then let 
us strive to increase it further by teaching our young people the advan- 
tage of working in the quorums of the Priesthood, so that when the time 
comes that they care to marry, they can be married in the Temple, 
having been made Elders in the Church. 

It seems to me that those things merit our consideration. Just why 
it is that that proportion is so low in some places, I do not know that I can 
say, but I believe it is because of the environment in which the young 
people live in those Stakes, that most of their associations are outside of 
the Church, and consequently many of them are marrying outside of 
the Church. Now, it so happens that occasionally a marriage of this 
kind is rectified because the non-member party to the marriage eventually 
comes into the Church through conversion. It seems to me, however, 
that it would be infinitely better for that conversion to be realized be- 
forehand. Isn't it a serious consideration? 

THE TEACHING OF MARRIAGE IN THE TEMPLE MOST DESIRABLE 

We have those two fields of labor, then, for our Stake missionaries, 
for instance, and especially for our fathers and mothers, to teach their 
young people that it is a highly desirable thing to marry within the 
Church, to marry people whose sympathies are like yours, whose faith 
is like yours, who understand you, and whom you can understand. And 
then to teach these young men their duties, so that this group, which we 



ELDER ANTOINE R. IVINS 



31 



call the Adult Aaronic Priesthood group, will shrink to the vanishing 
point. It would be a wonderful thing if we could accomplish that one 
thing within the Church. If we could do it, even to reduce it just a 
little, within the next year, think what a wonderful project that would 
be within our Stakes and within our families. 

There is nothing we could do, perhaps, that would help our young 
people to a better realization of their possibilities, than to so teach them 
that they would marry in the Temple. There is nothing that I have ever 
been more grateful for than that privilege, the privilege of being sealed 
to my wife for not only this life but for an eternity which is to come. 
The very sanctity and sacredness of that thing is one of the greatest sup- 
ports that we could have in life. It is one of the very finest objectives that 
we could have in dealing with our young people. Now, to impress upon 
them the sanctity of it and the desirability of it, we have to teach them 
some other things. 

RESPONSIBILITY OF LEADERS TOWARDS THE YOUNG 

There are far too many of us who fail to teach our young people 
the law of chastity. Nothing in a man's life, or that of a woman, can 
give the satisfaction and the joy that comes from the realization that 
your life has been a chaste and upright life. These young people are placed 
in our trust, and we have a responsibility towards them. If we can in- 
crease their happiness, their joy and their safety, by teaching them these 
things, it is a sacred duty on our part to do it. Let us never let a son or 
daughter of ours, who may be found in sin, be able to say to us that either 
for lack of teaching or by example we are responsible for his or her 
downfall. 

I hope that we may be able to so instill in their hearts a love for 
these things that such practices as repeatedly come to our notice, where 
men fail in this respect, will likewise diminish to the vanishing point. I 
would that every man and woman in the Church were able to bow their 
heads before God, their Heavenly Father, and swear that they are chaste 
and upright. 

I compliment you fathers and mothers on the great numbers of 
your boys and girls who can look us, their Presiding Authorities, in the 
eye, and swear that they are clean, before they go on their missions. I 
do not know any place in the world where you could find as high a per- 
centage of men and women that can do so. But as near perfect as that 
may be, we might increase it. We might make that better, with just a 
little more care given to our young people. I pray that God will give us 
the strength and the courage and the frankness to meet them on com- 
mon ground, and teach them the way of life. God bless you. Amen. 




GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Fust Day 



ELDER SAMUEL O. BENNION 



Of the First Council of the Seventy 



I sincerely trust, my brethren and sisters, that I may enjoy the 
Spirit of the Lord this afternoon, for no one can hold this position and 
address an audience without that Spirit which will bear testimony to all 
of us that this is His work. 



In the day and age in which we live the many complicated situa- 
tions which arise bring us more than ever face to face with the fact that 
we are all individually responsible for our acts. I believe that I have 
an individual responsibility as well as an opportunity to do what the 
Lord would have me do, and that I have also the duty to encourage others 
to do likewise. They in turn have the same privilege. 

I do not believe as many do that the grave is the great common 
leveler, but rather that as we live and journey through this life, so shall 
we begin on the other side ; that we shall begin where we left off here ; 
that we cannot change the life that we have established; that it will 
take time for men and women to change their methods of living. I believe 
in the Prophet Alma's words, that this life is the time for men and women 
to prepare to meet God : 

Yea, behold, the day of this life is the day for men to perform 
their labors. 

Alma continues : 

Ye cannot say contrary to this, for that same spirit which doth 
possess your body at the time of death, at the time that ye go out of 
this life, that same spirit shall possess your body in the life to come. 

It is a mistake for men and women to believe, as many are taught 
in the world, that when we pass away we will go immediately into the 
presence of the Lord, there to remain. It is not so written, but it is writ- 
ten that we shall go into that spirit world, and that the life that we have 
lived, the knowledge that we have acquired, will be with us there, and 
shall be with us and for us in that life where we shall go. 



We came into this world and took upon ourselves these bodies of 
flesh and bones willingly. We came here, away from home, to perform 
a work, and to test our strength. The Lord sent us on this mission. I 
have always felt that this experience in mortality is more or less a mis- 
sionary experience. He governs and controls the destinies of the human 
family, according to their faith in Him and according to their work, and 
that training they received, and that obedience which they yielded in 
that eternal world from whence we all came, had much to do with the 
shaping of their destiny here. 

I do not place credence in the thought that things come by chance 



RESPONSIBILITY FOR OPPORTUNITIES 



EARTHLY LIFE A MISSION 



ELDER SAMUEL O. BEN N I ON 



33 



or by luck. I doubt very much if there is any such thing. I think the 
Lord's plan is an orderly one, which He made before the foundation of 
this earth was laid. I believe with all my heart in the testimony of the 
great prophets, that we were in that world, and that we shouted for joy 
at the time when the Son of Man was selected to go into the world and 
preach the Gospel of peace among the children of men, that men who 
would might have a chance to prove themselves while they were in 
mortality. 

I repeat that I am strong for individuality. I believe in it in business 
and in government. I believe in it in my Church relationships. I am fully 
converted to Alma's statement that this is the time for men to prepare 
to meet God, and that that same spirit which possesses our bodies when we 
go out of this world, that same spirit and experience and training, will go 
with us into the world to come. It will be there as an asset unto us. If 
we have not kept the commandments of God and made good use of our 
time, then we have failed that much, and we have to that extent retarded 
His plan, for after all that plan is based upon the faith and works mani- 
fested by the sons and daughters of God. 

THE KEYS OF AUTHORITY RESTORED 

The Lord has established in your day and mine the Gospel of Jesus 
Christ. He gave it to the Prophet Joseph Smith, who was divinely ap- 
pointed to become the great Prophet of this dispensation of the fulness 
of times. It was through him the Gospel was to be taught in all the 
world. The Lord brought into the world the authority that He gave 
to Joseph the Prophet, and He established it through those men who ap- 
peared unto the Prophet and gave the keys to him. This is the authority 
to act in the name of God. This is the Holy Priesthood, and to know this 
and to live in accordance with it is life eternal for the children of men. 

There are thousands and millions of good men and fine women in 
this world. They can only be reached by those who know the truth. A 
man who does not have a testimony of this Gospel cannot bear it to others. 
He cannot establish faith in the heart of another man or woman unless 
he possesses that faith himself. He must have a knowledge that God 
lives, that Jesus is the Christ, that this divine plan called Mormonism, 
was instituted by our Father in Heaven, and that it is the work of God. 
He must feel this and know it. Then he can have influence with the chil- 
dren of men, and by the power of his example, which often precedes 
precept, he can establish faith in the hearts of the children of men. 

This is the mission of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints. If men procrastinate, if they continue to be wicked, they cannot 
hope to inherit these blessings. Let me read what Alma further says 
about this : 

For behold, if ye have procrastinated the day of your repentance 
even until death, behold, ye have become subjected to the spirit of the 
devil, and he doth seal you his; therefore, the Spirit of the Lord hath 
withdrawn from you, and hath no place in you, and the devil hath all 
power over you; and this is the final state of the wicked. 



34 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Friday, April 4 First Day 

EVIL HABITS LEAD MEN ASTRAY 

My brethren and sisters, let us look well to the habits we form. If 
they are evil habits, and if we do not repent of them and put them from 
us, they become a great part of us and it is not easy to shake them off or 
to forget them. It is not easy for men and women to get away from the 
vices of sin. The drinking of alcohol, for example, leads them into ter- 
rible conditions, often into destruction. That same principle will apply 
to every habit or form of sin that a man or a woman may acquire here 
in mortality. That is the thing I think that our great prophet Alma 
had in mind. 

ADVICE GIVEN BY THE PROPHET ALMA 

Alma offers some very encouraging advice in these words : 

Counsel with the Lord in all thy doings, and He will direct thee 
for good; yea, when ye liest down at night lie down unto the Lord, 
that he may watch over you in your sleep; and when thou risest in the 
morning let thy heart be full of thanks unto God; and if ye do these 
things, ye shall be lifted up at the last day. 

That is the promise that He offers to men and women who will fol- 
low the Lord and counsel with Him, who will attend to prayer, who will 
attend to their offerings, who will walk uprightly, as carefully as men 
and women may in mortality. And he said : "Ye shall be lifted up at the 
last day." 

A GREAT PROMISE 

As I read these words my mind was drawn, and has been drawn 
many times to a passage of scripture in the Doctrine and Covenants, in 
the y3rd section, the first verse. I heard President Joseph F. Smith read 
it once when I was in Conference, and I believed it was directed to me. 
I read it to you : 

Verily, thus saith the Lord: It shall come to pass that every soul 
who forsaketh his sins and cometh unto me, and calleth on my name, 
and obeyeth my voice, and keepeth my commandments, shall see my 
face and know that I am. 

I want to say to you, my brethren and sisters and friends, that is one 
of the greatest promises the Lord could offer. It is a wonderful thing for 
us to know that, and to know that it will absolutely come to pass. It fills 
us with joy to know that the Lord Jesus Christ is the Savior of the 
world, and that He is our Father's Son ; that He established faith among 
the children of men and raised up a righteous heritage here in the earth, 
to establish His Cause in the great world in which we live, and that if 
we are worthy we may one day look upon His face. 

THE VALUE OF TRUTH 

It is a glorious thing to know the Truth. It is a glorious thing to 
live it. It is a fine thing to meet men, regardless of where we may travel, 
and to let them know and feel in their hearts that we believe in the Gospel

plan and that we teach it and live it. By it we may bring souls unto 
Christ. 

I have lived in the shadow of the prophets for many years. I have 
heard their testimonies. It is a marvelous thing to hear the testimony of 
President Grant. I talked to a person who heard his voice this morning 
over the radio. He said it was inspiring and that he was deeply touched 
when, in his humility, the President manifested emotion. The testimony 
of Jesus was there. What more could men and women ask for or hope 
for than to know these things ? "For this is life eternal," said the Savior 
in His day, "to know thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom 
thou has sent." 

Brethren and sisters, we are living in a day of great trouble and dis- 
tress, but we have the power to use our free agency, stand for the things 
we know are right, and to establish faith among the children of men. 
Let us not be fearful of saying "No" when we ought to say it. Let us 
stand for the truth and uphold the hands of the prophet of the living 
God and those who are associated with him, for this is the work of God. 
The Lord bless you. Amen.

ELDER JOSEPH FIELDING SMITH 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

This is a most wonderful sight, and this is a most important posi- 
tion which I occupy. In looking into your faces I feel very much my 
weakness and dependence upon the Spirit of the Lord, and I trust that 
I may have your faith and prayers in what I may say. 

There are a great many principles that concern us very deeply, the 
principles of the Gospel. We have assembled here for the purpose of 
being instructed, guided and built up in the faith. It is impossible for one 
individual, in the limited time, to attempt to cover many of these prin- 
ciples of eternal truth. I have been delighted in all that we have heard. 
We have heard much already of the greatest importance, which I humbly 
hope we will put into practice, if we have not already been practicing 
these principles of righteousness which have been mentioned here this 
afternoon. 

I am inclined, at this particular moment, to continue something 
along the line of the remarks that were made by Brother Ivins, for I 
believe that he touched upon one of the most important things that con- 
cern the Latter-day Saints — marriage. 

KEEPING THE COMMANDMENTS IMPORTANT 

We have a great many people in the Church who would not think for 
a moment of stealing. They would not lie. They would never think 
of purposely injuring a neighbor, and they might be considered, of course, 
to be good citizens, because in all their acts they show the spirit of honesty 
and integrity so far as their dealings with their fellow men are concern- 



36 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Friday, April 4 First Day 

ed. But they do not feel that they have violated any principle of justice 
or right, when they violate some of the most important commandments 
that the Lord has given us. 

MARRIAGE FOR TIME NOT APPROVED 

Frequently I receive an invitation to attend a wedding. I look in the 
newspaper and I see the picture of a beautiful young lady, and the an- 
nouncement made that she is going to be married, and perhaps, she being 
a member of the Church, she is going to marry also a member of the 
Church, but that the ceremony is going to be performed at the home of 
the bride, or at some other place selected by them, outside of the Temple 
of the Lord. 

While the invitation that comes to me no doubt is sent in the spirit 
of kindness, I always feel that I would rather not receive it, because I 
do not want to lend to a wedding of that kind even my presence, because 
I consider marriage, as the Lord has given it to the Church, one of the 
most vital and one of the most sacred principles that has ever been reveal- 
ed. And when we violate that covenant, or refuse to enter into that 
covenant, we are transgressors of the law. 

We read in the scriptures that sin is the transgression of the law. 
Now, these people who marry by what we call civil ceremony, in other 
words, who are married by the Justice of the Peace, or by an Elder of 
the Church, the Bishop or the President of the Stake, outside of the 
Temple of the Lord, can only be married for time. That is all. The 
Lord has commanded us, as it is recorded in the revelations, that mar- 
riage among members of the Church should be performed in His Holy 
House, and not for time only, but for time and all eternity. Therefore, 
those who are satisfied to receive a ceremony for time only, uniting them 
for this life, and are content with that, are ignorant of this fundamental 
principle of the Gospel and its consequences, or they are in rebellion 

against the commandments of the Lord. 
t 

RESPONSIBILITY OF PARENTS 

Now, what I want to say is intended very largely for the parents of 
the young people. I think the parents, perhaps, are more to be blamed, 
because, in many instances, very many instances, they have not taught 
their children the sacredness of the marriage covenant. I want to read 
to you one or two things that are written in the revelations. I hope that 
my words will carry to those who contemplate entering into this sacred 
ordinance, and if they have intended to have the ceremony performed in 
some other way, rather than that which the Lord has indicated, that they 
will take heed and repent, that they may receive the blessings. 

COVENANTS NOT OF GOD END WITH LIFE 

I am the Lord thy God; and I give unto you this commandment — 
that no man shall come unto the Father but by me or by my word, 
which is my law, saith the Lord. 

And everything that is in the world, whether it be ordained of 



ELDER JOSEPH FIELDING SMITH 



37 



men, by thrones, or principalities, or powers, or things of name, what- 
soever they may be, that are not by me or by my word, saith the 
Lord, shall be thrown down, and shall not remain after men are dead, 
neither in nor after the resurrection, saith the Lord your God. 

For whatsoever things remain are by me; and whatsoever things 
are not by me shall be shaken and destroyed. 

I have read to you a fundamental truth, a self-evident truth. Any 
one, it seems to me, who believes in a Supreme Being, must acknowledge 
the fact that any covenant or obligation, bond, vow or performance, that 
is not in accord with the law which has been decreed by the Supreme 
Being, must of necessity come to an end. I can see no grounds for argu- 
ment in regard to that. That is a fundamental truth. 

The Lord continues in this revelation and says : 

Therefore, if a man marry him a wife in the world, and he 
marry her not by me nor by my word, and he covenant with her so 
long as he is in the world and she with him, their covenant and mar- 
riage are not of force when they are dead, and when they are out of 
the world; therefore they are not bound by any law when they are 
out of the world. 

While the Church, as well as the world, would recognize that marriage 
while they are in the world, yet the fact remains that when they are dead 
the marriage comes to an end. 

Therefore when they are out of the world they neither marry nor 
are given in marriage; but are appointed angels in heaven; which 
angels are ministering servants, to minister for those who are worthy 
of a far more, and an exceeding and an eternal weight of glory. 

I take it that this has reference to those who have been just and 
honest and have been willing to keep other covenants and commandments 
the Lord has given them. They are members of the Church, but have not 
been willing to enter into this great and crowning covenant, if you please, 
which would exalt them to be the sons and daughters of God. And 
therefore, as I read further : 

For these angels did not abide my law; therefore, they cannot be 
enlarged, but remain separately and singly, without exaltation, in their 
saved condition, to all eternity; and from henceforth are not gods, but 
are angels of God forever and ever. 

Forever and ever ! Think of it ! It fills my heart with sadness when 
I see in the paper the name of a daughter or a son of members of this 
Church, and discover that she or he is going to have a ceremony and be 
married outside of the Temple of the Lord, because I realize what it 
means, that they are cutting themselves off from exaltation in the King- 
dom of God. 

Now, again, the Lord continues, in this revelation, to say that if 
they are married by His word, then they shall pass on to the exaltation, 
and that exaltation is a fulness and a continuation of the seeds forever. 
In other words, the family organization is intact throughout all eternity, 
and there shall be eternal increase, — and that is the crowning glory, if 
you please, in the Kingdom of God. 




GENERAL CONFERENCE 



First Day 



Again : 



Verily, verily, I say unto you, except ye abide my law ye cannot 
attain to this glory. 

For strait is the gate, and narrow the way that leadeth unto the 
exaltation and continuation of the lives, and few there be that find it, 
because ye receive me not in the world, neither do ye know me. 

But if ye receive me in the world, then shall ye know me, and 
shall receive your exaltation; that where I am ye shall be also. 

This is eternal lives — to know the only wise and true God, and 
Jesus Christ, whom He hath sent. I am He. Receive ye, therefore, 
my law. 



What do you get of that? This fact, that the marriage for eternity 
grants unto us the privilege of eternal lives. It does not have reference 
to our existence hereafter, for every man will live eternally ; it is the con- 
tinuation of the seeds forever, which constitutes eternal lives. 

Broad is the gate, and wide the way that leadeth to the deaths; 
and many there are that go in thereat, because they receive me not, 
neither do they abide in my law. 

What is meant by the expression "to the deaths" ? It means to be 
stopped, to be shut off, to be denied the privilege of eternal increase. That 
is the deaths, and a great majority of mankind will go on into the eternity, 
to partake of the deaths, which means a stoppage, cutting off from these 
great blessings, which shall be bestowed upon those who are willing to 
keep the commandments of the Lord. 

May the Lord bless the Latter-day Saints. May parents teach their 
children, that they may understand this thing, that they might walk in 
the light of the truth, and that this evil that exists among us may come 
to an end, and that the fathers and mothers may rejoice when their 
children are married by some one who can seal them for time and for 
all eternity. 



President Joseph F. Smith has said — I have heard him say it to the 
members of his family and elsewhere — that he would rather take his 
children to the grave, one by one, and lay them away, knowing that they 
would come forth worthy to receive the fulness of the kingdom of God, 
than to have them marry outside of the temple of the Lord, and deny 
themselves these privileges. 

Of course, a person who marries outside of the temple may repent, 
and can come to the temple and have the ceremony performed by one 
having authority; but how much better it is, as we have already heard, 
to do the thing right at first. So I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ, 
our Lord, Amen.

PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITHES WORDS 



ELDER JOHN II. TAYLOR

ELDER JOHN H. TAYLOR 

Of the First Council of the Seventy 

I am very happy, my brethren and sisters, to have the opportunity 
of speaking to you this afternoon. Along with the other brethren, I have 
been very much interested in the remarks, counsel and instructions that 
have come to us. I trust my Heavenly Father will bless me, that I may 
be helpful in my remarks, so that our faith and testimony may be 
increased. 

DREAMS AND VISIONS 

In reading in the Book of Mormon my attention was attracted to 
the statement of Lehi, wherein he gives an account of his vision of the 
iron rod. I was attracted first because, in the words of Lehi, he said : "I 
have dreamed a dream ; in other words, I have seen a vision." It occurred 
to me that the dreams that one has, if they are at all worth while to the 
individual, or to the Church, they must be associated with that other 
word "vision." When one has dreams, and they are of value, they must 
be associated with vision from God, the Eternal Father. 

We do have people in our day, who are dreaming dreams, and they, 
in some instances, feel that they are very vital, and that they belong in 
some way to the revelations of the Lord. As a general rule, such dreams 
have to do with personal desires for things, — perhaps things they should 
not have. They may be caused by worry or nervousness or an unbalanced 
ration. 

I had an uncle, who was a bachelor, and a lady came to him and 
said she had had a dream that she should marry him. My uncle said, 
"That is all right, but will you wait, please, until I have had the same 
dream ?" 

There are people who, in order to have the things that they want, 
assume that they are dreaming, and that these dreams are coming from 
God. It is only a way of disregarding the word of the Lord, and doing 
the things that they want to do, whether they be right or whether they 
be contrary to the word of the Lord. 

THE TREE OF LIFE 

In this dream of Lehi's he said that he saw the tree of life and that 
it was the most precious thing above all other things, because "it sheddeth 
itself abroad in the hearts of all the children of men." An angel who 
was standing by Nephi as he was receiving the interpretation of his 
father's dream said, "Yea, and the most joyous to the soul." 

The love of God, in the explanation that we have in the scriptures, 
is the tree of life. The love of God is more precious than anything else, 
and we can readily judge how much we love God by the way we keep 
His commandments. We may say we love God, but if we haven't the 
strength, the faith or the courage to make sacrifices for the truth, then 
surely we are not loving God as we should love Him.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



First Day 



THE IRON ROD AND THE GREAT BUILDING SEEN BY LEHI 

The other thing that attracted my attention was the rod of iron which 
ran along the bank of a river and led to the tree of life. In the inter- 
pretation to Nephi he was made to understand that this rod of iron was 
the word of God, the Eternal Father, and that many men and women, 
hosts of them, started on their way to reach the tree of life, that they 
might partake of this fruit, which was precious above all other fruits. 
As they came and partook of this fruit, some of them, in looking around, 
saw a building that seemed to be standing, as it were, in the air. There 
was a multitude of people in this building, and they were mocking those 
who had come to eat of the fruit of the tree of life. Many of these people 
who came and had eaten of the tree of life, because of the attitude of 
the people who were in this spacious building, felt ashamed of the 
thing that they were doing, and wandered away and were lost. 

RIDICULE OFTEN THE CAUSE OF TURNING FROM THE RIGHT 

So the thought has occurred to me that often we partake of the fruit 
of the tree of life, or we become acquainted with the love of God, and 
His mercies, and then we are made ashamed by the attitude of other 
people. I dare say that the majority of our young people who begin to 
smoke or to drink, do so because in some way other people have made 
them ashamed of the word of the Lord, as if it were something lacking 
in value and need not be held to. Because of the mockery and because of 
the words of ridicule, our young people turn away and commence to do 
things that other people do. Then it becomes a habit, which makes it 
that much harder to find their way back again to the road that will 
lead them to the tree of life. 

We have people who fail to go into the house of the Lord because 
they have been made ashamed of its ordinances and ceremonies and of 
its requirements in the matter of dress. The argument is used that it is 
all absurd, that it is foolish and of no importance; therefore boys and 
girls and other people are made ashamed of the things that we have in 
the holy house of God, because they lack understanding and courage and 
because they have not loved God enough. They would rather have the 
things that seemingly are comfortable and easy for them, and which 
require no sacrifice. Thus they turn away from the love of God and the 
path of righteousness. 

Awhile ago I came in contact with a man, a young fellow who, 
attending one of our places of learning, was told that patriarchal blessings 
were on the same plane as fortune telling and crystal gazing, that there 
was no truth back of them that would be helpful to anyone. So that 
young man's faith in one of the precious privileges of the Church was 
shattered. 

May the Lord bless us and be helpful to us. May we seek after the 
tree of life. May we get hold of the iron rod and as we go through the 
destructive mists of darkness, may we hold tight to this rod and not be 
lost in the wilderness, and so be able to reach the tree of life, and love 
God as we should love Him. I humbly pray for these things. Amen. 



ELDER CHARLES A. CALLIS 



41 



ELDER CHARLES A. CALLIS 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

The Apostle Peter said : "Jesus went about doing good." In these 
five words is the epitome of a divine life, spent in the service of humanity. 

As I listened to the report which was read this morning, particularly 
that part of it which referred to the Church Welfare work, I said in my 
heart, "this great movement is applied religion." 

MIGHTY WORKS PERFORMED BY JESUS 

It is wonderful to contemplate the care and compassion that Jesus 
bestowed upon the unfortunate. He healed the sick, made the blind to 
see and the deaf to hear. He fed the hungry multitudes, "lest they faint." 
When He raised the little maid to life He commanded the astonished 
parents "that something should be given her to eat." 

When He performed those mighty works in His own country the 
people were astounded and said: "Is not this the carpenter?" They 
could not comprehend that Jesus was Deity embodied in human form. 

I haven't heard anyone explain the full significance of the profound 
truth that God Almighty trained His Only Begotten Son in a carpenter 
shop. The Savior was no weakling. He was a muscular workman ; He 
stood and moved in the pride and strength of manhood when He drove 
the money changers from the Temple. He was also considerate and 
kind. 

THE YOKE OF CHRIST 

He said : 

Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will 
give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn of me: for I am 
meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For 
my yoke is easy, and my burden is light. 

Jesus in the carpenter shop doubtless made yokes for oxen. But the 
yokes He made left no sore spots. They made the burden light. The 
man who bears the yoke of Christ has no sore spots on him. In his heart 
and life there is real liberty and joy. Yes, Jesus was a carpenter and 
that Carpenter today is the Captain of the world's only hope. 

PRACTICAL ADVICE TO YOUNG MEN 

Our young men in Zion should learn handicraft trades ; there are 
too many of them seeking white-collar jobs. If they want to "stand be- 
fore kings" they should become skilful farmers, craftsmen, mechanics, 
and be diligent in their work. 

Mr. Babson said : 

W. J. Cameron, of the Ford Motor Company, told me the other 
day that the number of students preparing to be mechanics is only 
about one-seventh the number now employed as mechanics; while the 
number now studying for the professions is about thirteen times those 
engaged in the professions. 



42 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Friday. April 4 First Day 

This does not look good. We should not cease to teach our young 
men that the mechanic as well as the farmer is necessary for the pro- 
gress of the community. The world is in need of mechanics, builders, 
plumbers, carpenters, bricklayers. I felt disappointed in reading in a 
newspaper, a few days ago, the following statement : 

The Ogden Air Depot at Hill Field will need 2,500 to 3,500 
machinists and mechanics by the end of this year, it had been reported 
today by Major R. J. Minty, personnel officer. 

He explained that the army hopes to fill at least the lower grade 
skilled jobs with Utah men, but is certain that many of the more 
skilled workers must come from outside the state. 

I urge the young men to learn trades ; to be craftsmen. Then they 
will be qualified to earn a comfortable living. The middle partition of 
the incompatibility between labor and culture should be pulled down. 
There should be no such partition. Labor is honorable. Let us pursue 
the splendid policy that will bring temporal independence to our young 
men and that will produce for us more builders, for our people are natur- 
ally builders. A new world is being built. Builders and mechanics are 
in demand. Every effort should be put forth to make our young men 
employable. 

Boys and girls stay in the country, on the farms ; do not desert them, 
for the land is your heritage. When the bulk of the population shifts to 
the cities there is danger to the nation. For the real bulwark, and the 
strength of the nation is in the country. President Grant remarked to 
me the other day that cities would perish if they were not continually 
nourished with the good, pure blood that comes from the country. 

I know of four ranches in this State. The men who founded them 
were English, German, Swedish and Danish. They were solid men in 
the community and earned the bold independence that comes from labor. 
They made themselves well-to-do. But where are their descendants. 
Most of them wanted white-collar jobs. I have seen them punching 
time-clocks. They are living from hand to mouth. Strangers, not mem- 
bers of the Church, contented and prosperous, own and live on those 
ranches. 

"Sweet are the uses of adversity." I believe in this too often over- 
looked truth. Blessings ought not to be wasted : neither should troubles. 
Oh, if we had had the foresight to have prepared for the defense of this 
country when we were in the midst of the depression ! Men could then 
have been trained as mechanics. They could have been employed in erect- 
ing our defenses. Instead of spending the billions of dollars in ways that 
probably have not brought the greatest good, work could have been pro- 
vided for millions of workers who would have been glad to work. There 
might not have been any war in Europe if this had been done. 

THE LORD'S ADVICE TO RICH AND POOR 

The Lord gives some advice to the laboring men, and also to the 
rich men. This is the Carpenter speaking, the Carpenter who was exalted 
to a throne to sit down on the right hand of God. He it was who was 
rich and became poor for our sakes. Listen to His divine admonition : 



ELDER CHARLES A. CALLIS 



43 



Woe unto you rich men, that will not give your substance to the 
poor, for your riches will canker your souls; and this shall be your 
lamentation in the day of visitation, and of judgment, and of indigna- 
tion: The harvest is past, the summer is ended, and my soul is not 
saved ! 

I admire the great captains of industry. They have founded mag- 
nificent industries. They should be hailed as saviors of labor in the in- 
dustrial world. But they should not honor and love mammon more than 
they love their humble brethren who are working for them. 

Now, to the laboring men : 

Woe unto you poor men, whose hearts are not broken, whose 
spirits are not contrite, and whose bellies are not satisfied, and whose 
hands are not stayed from laying hold upon other men's goods, whose 
eyes are full of greediness, and who will not labor with your own hands. 

No excuse there for sit-down strikes. No encouragement for strikes 
which are inspired by a spirit of violence. Labor cannot do without 
capital. God wants both to go together peaceably. Do not blame and 
envy men because they are rich ; do not condemn or look down upon men 
because they are poor. 

The capitalists, the industrialists engaged in the manufacturing in- 
dustry and the working men should put aside the agitators and the profes- 
sional trouble-makers and meet around the conference table with their 
hearts permeated with the Spirit of Christ. 

Then in that state of mind, misunderstandings, questions and dis- 
putes would be settled in reason and justice. Results would spring from 
such conferences which would make an end of useless and costly strikes. 
They would make for practices, conciliation, satisfactory adjustments 
and happiness that flow from the spirit of the Savior. Thus these out- 
breaks of violence, the strikes which disfigure and disrupt our industrial 
life would cease. I pray that the Spirit of the Lord Jesus will rest upon 
and abide with employer and employed alike. 

GRATITUDE EXPRESSED FOR LEADERS 

We thank God for President Grant. As he was talking this morn- 
ing the words of the Apostle Paul came to my mind. He said : "Never- 
theless, I live ; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me." We see the influence 
of the spirit of the Savior in the life of our beloved President. That is 
the reason why he is a blessing to his people. 

May I add just one more word. With all my heart I endorse the 
statesmanlike address delivered by President Clark in this Conference. 
Every word of it I accept. It is a warning to this nation, a word of light 
uttered by a prophet-statesman. 

I bear testimony to the truth of the Gospel in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



First Day 



ELDER FRANK EVANS 

Former President of the Eastern States Mission 

I do not know at this moment what I shall say. I have been in this 
congregation since the opening of the morning meeting, very much im- 
pressed and stimulated by the discourses of the brethren, but not expect- 
ing to be called upon myself. 

It is a singular privilege to occupy this pulpit. When one reflects 
upon the history of it, and looks back over the years, when he examines 
the discourses that have been delivered here, he finds the high points in 
all the activities of our lives, from the standpoint of religion, of social 
science or educational principles ; in fact, in all that is of importance to 
us. The finest doctrines known to men have gone out from this pulpit. 
It is not surprising, therefore, that those who are to speak approach it in 
a spirit of diffidence, certainly of humility, of deep concern, and of pro- 
found respect. 

Going back to the records of 1869 and 70, and to the General Con- 
ference of April, 1872, 1 re-read oftentimes the doctrines proclaimed here 
by President Brigham Young. He urged the people to come together 
in unity and counsel in all their undertakings. He taught the doctrine of 
cooperation as we see it today, and even upon a broader scale, and yet it 
was probably from this pulpit alone that that doctrine was then being 
taught. He defined clearly the benefits of cooperation and the advan- 
tages that it would bring to all the people. Since that time, every State in 
the Union has declared in favor of the principles which he then advocated. 

Today we see also the most advanced step, I believe, that has been 
taken in the direction of cooperation, in our Church Welfare Program. 
I trust that no man and no woman who, having the opportunity to engage 
in this work, will fail to do so. Let not your sons and daughters grow 
up to a realization of what is now being done in the line of social justice, 
welfare and service, to discover that you have not taken part in it. The 
day will come when men will stand here and relate with justifiable pride, 
what wilL have been accomplished in the present undertaking and the 
people will view it with universal approval and with a sense of deep 
satisfaction. 

At the April Conference of 1880, President John Taylor delivered 
a discourse here which for fundamental righteousness cannot be excelled 
by any address that I have ever read. It was the Year of Jubilee. He 
advocated that " we do like the Ancients, and take off the yoke from those 
who are in debt and unable to pay, and release them from their bondage, 
and cause a feeling of joy and liberty to abound among the poor." The 
granaries were opened, and the thirty-five thousand bushels of grain that 
had been gathered by the women of the Relief Society were released for 
the benefit of the poor. 

In that sermon, President Taylor said : 

When the Lord is blessing us, let us bless one another. He will 
not let us suffer if we take care not to let one another suffer.

It will be recalled that at that time one-half of the sums due to the 
Perpetual Emigration Fund, amounting to more than $800,000, was turn- 
ed over for the benefit of the poor — that is, these obligations were for- 
given those who were unable to pay. That was, in reality, a year of 
jubilation. 

However, the discourses of that day were not, of course, broadcast 
as they are today. They reached the ears of ten thousand gathered in 
this great auditorium and were preserved in written or printed form, but 
where one thousand were reached then, hundreds of thousands may hear 
what is being said now. The discourses of this morning, for example, 
were heard throughout the West and I believe it can be said that they 
take rank with the noblest utterances that have ever come from this 
pulpit. 

Another thing that has been constantly taught here is the doctrine 
of thrift ; not a thrift that is mean or low or selfish, but a thrift that calls 
for intelligent saving, for judicious spending, and for wise giving; a 
thrift that makes one able to be generous. President Grant has con- 
stantly emphasized this doctrine and in connection with it the principle of 
self-discipline, self-control, and avoidance of those things which are in- 
jurious to the physical being. While in years gone by these things have 
not been taken so seriously, today from every college, every medical in- 
stitution, from all those trained in medical science, from the councils of 
people generally come an acceptance of these doctrines, especially so since 
they may now be judged by their fruits. And, above all, lessons of cour- 
age have come from this pulpit, both by word and by example — the cour- 
age of one's convictions such as our leaders exhibited in years gone by, 
and such as they exemplify today. 

As I was recently leaving the Mission office in New York, for a 
trip into> the field, I passed through an electric gateway at the railway 
station. As I approached the gate leading to the train, it opened mysteri- 
ously before me, and to my mind came the question, "What hand opened 
that gate for me?" The obvious answer seemed to be: "No hand at all. 
You simply intercepted the electric current and the power did the rest." 
But that was not the answer. Many hands and many minds, working 
over many years, opened that gate for me, and tens of thousands of men, 
women and children have availed themselves of that convenience which 
science had given unto us. I thought of the Faradays and of the Edisons 
and their kind and of how they had been taunted and even ridiculed, as 
they worked their way upward to bring a blessing to mankind. Courage 
kept them at their task. But more than all, I thought of the leaders of 
that Mission in the early days — of Wilford Woodruff, of John Taylor, 
of Parley P. Pratt and Orson Pratt, and such men as they. They also 
pointed out a gate which opened to tens of thousands of men and women 
and children, — a strait gate and a narrow way, one that leads to Life. 
That is the Way with which we are most concerned. These men, too, 
were taunted, were ridiculed and even persecuted, but they were never 
dismayed. They were men of fortitude and of unfailing courage. They 
were convinced of the rectitude of that for which they stood. They were

converted to the Gospel of Jesus Christ, and there was no compromise 
in their souls or in their minds. 

These are the lessons which have been taught from this pulpit during 
all the years of its history. May we appreciate its importance, its deep 
significance. May we not fail in our integrity, in our courage, in our de- 
votion to the work of the Lord, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 

An anthem, "Be Thou Faithful" — Engel — was sung by the Choir. 



PRESIDENT J. REUBEN CLARK, JR. 

First Counselor in the First Presidency 

We thank the Choir for the beautiful songs which they have sung 
to us today. We always know when we have the Brigham Young Uni- 
versity Chorus that we will have good music. 

I again urge that as you leave here to drive to your homes, you drive 
carefully, and I ask the pedestrians to walk sensibly as they cross the 
roads. 

The benediction was pronounced by Elder Richard C. May, Presi- 
dent of the Minidoka Stake. 

Conference adjourned until 10 a. m., Saturday, April 5. 



SECOND DAY 
MORNING MEETING 

Conference reconvened Saturday morning, April 5, at 10 o'clock. 



PRESIDENT J. REUBEN CLARK, JR. 

First Counselor in the First Presidency 

The moment has arrived for opening the third session of this Con- 
ference. We are indeed grateful again this morning, notwithstanding 
the inclement weather, that President Grant is with us and is presiding. 
He has asked President Clark to conduct the services. 

Through the courtesy of Radio Station KSL and of the other Radio 
Stations cooperating the meetings of this Conference are being broadcast 
over KFXD at Nampa; KSEI at Pocatello; KTFI at Twin Falls; KID 
at Idaho Falls ; KSUB at Cedar City ; and KEUB at Price. 

The Presidents of Stakes in these localities are arranging meetings 
in various of their Ward meeting houses where Ward and Stake congre- 
gations can hear the Conference. A direct wire from the Tabernacle to 
the Los Angeles Stake Tabernacle in Los Angeles, California, will bring 
the services to that area. 

We were advised last evening that the reception was very good in 
all these areas, and that people were coming together and enjoying the 
services. 



ELDER JOSEPH F. MERRILL

There are present on the stand this morning President Grant and his 
two Counselors, the eleven Apostles, all of the First Seven Presidents 
of Seventies, and all of the Presiding Bishopric. 

The music today will be furnished by the Blackfoot Stake Choir, 
Elder Ronald Bitton, Director, Elder Frank W. Asper, Organist. 

The congregation and the Blackfoot Stake Choir sang the hymn, "Do 
What is Right." 

Elder Wilford W. Warnick, President of the Timpanogos Stake, 
offered the opening prayer. 

The Choir sang "Lift Up Your Heads" — Taylor. 

ELDER JOSEPH F. MERRILL 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

Revelation is the rock upon which the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints is built. It is the basis of Mormonism — the restored 
Gospel of Jesus Christ in its fulness. Using the term revelation in a 
broad sense, it is the means the Lord has always employed to acquaint 
His children with the plan of salvation, with a knowledge of His exist- 
ence and of our relationship to Him. We believe the Bible and other 
scriptures are divinely inspired writings. 

JOSEPH SMITH, HEAVEN-TAUGHT 

The Prophet Joseph Smith was wonderfully favored by the Lord 
in the matter of revelation. So far as the records show, it began in what 
was the most marvelous vision ever given to mortal man. The Father 
and the Son not only showed themselves to Joseph but actually talked 
to him. In addition to these personages a number of others of the 
greatest personages in heaven also appeared and talked to him — Moses, 
Elias, Elijah, John the Baptist, the Apostles Peter, James and John, 
and the prophet Moroni — an imposing list of immortals. Thus to a 
remarkable degree Joseph Smith was heaven-taught by word of mouth 
as well as by inspiration of the Holy Ghost. We are entirely correct, 
therefore, when we say that divine revelation is basic to the organization 
and continued existence of this Church. 

REVELATION FOR THE CHURCH AND FOR INDIVIDUALS 

Without revelations other than the inspired teachings of the Bible 
this Church could never have been organized. There would have been 
no need for it, because it could not have been essentially different from 
existing churches. It would have had no more light than they have — 
no fuller truth to impart. 

Revelation is needed not only to guide the organization and teach- 
ings of the Church, but also to enable the members to function acceptably 
in their respective duties. One thing that is characteristic of the Latter- 
day Saints is their assurance that God lives, that this is His accepted 
Church and that He helps His children according to their worthiness and 



48 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Saturday, April 5 Second Day 

needs. Experience has taught them the validity of certain scriptural 
teachings relative to the individual receiving divine revelations. 

We remember what Jesus said to Peter when He asked His dis- 
ciples "Whom say ye that I am ?" The answer came quickly from Peter, 

Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God. And Jesus an- 
swered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon Barjona: for flesh 
and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father, which is in 
heaven. (Matt. 16:15-17.) 

This indicates that Peter received his knowledge through divine 
revelation. 

THE PRAYER OF FAITH ANSWERED 

Joseph Smith's boyhood experience in this matter has been published 
world-wide. The lad most earnestly wanted to know which church to 
join. He decided to ask the Lord, for he read in the writings of the 
Apostle James the following : 

If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all 
men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him. 

However, James gave a caution in these words : 

But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth 
is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed. For let not 
that man think that he shall receive anything of the Lord. (James 1 : 
5-7.) 

This biblical passage heartened the boy and he went into the nearby 
woods to pray. The sequel was the most marvelous vision ever given to 
mortal man. The Father and the Son appeared to Joseph in a column of 
transcendent light. He not only saw them, he heard their voices, for they 
spoke to him. He learned the truth that God hears and answers prayers. 

Many Latter-day Saints can and do bear witness to the truth of 
another saying of Jesus recorded by the Apostle John and stated in these 
words : 

If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether 
it be of God, or whether I speak of myself. (John 7:17.) 

This of course indicates that revelation is the means of getting this 
knowledge. 

I give another scriptural reference on this point. It is clearly and 
explicitly written and is found in the Book of Mormon, recorded in the 
tenth chapter of Moroni and is as follows : 

And when ye shall receive these things, [those written in the Book 
of Mormon] I would exhort you that ye would ask God, the Eternal 
Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not true; and if ye 
. shall ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ, 
he will manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy 
Ghost. And by the power of the Holy Ghost ye may know the truth 
pf all things. (Moroni 10:4-5.) 



ELDER JOSEPH F. MERRILL

REVELATION FROM TWO SOURCES 

I call attention to this principle of revelation, not that all Latter-day 
Saints do not accept it, but to point out that there are certain dangers 
regarding it about which a few of our people seemingly need to be warned. 
The kind of revelation of which I have spoken is divine revelation. I 
know of no dangers associated with this kind of revelation. Its source 
is heaven and most commonly is a manifestation of the power of the Holy 
Ghost. But using the term in its broadest sense it will include the whis- 
perings that come from evil sources through the power of Satan. 

According to our teachings, Satan and an army of supporters were 
cast down to earth from the premortal spirit world. They are spirit 
brothers of ours, and are real persons having spirit bodies. As surely as 
we live they live also. They are trying to handicap and thwart the work of 
the Lord. Wherever the Saints are found there the devil is also. If 
Satan can overcome the Saints, he will have all the world subject to him. 
He is a deceiver, the father of lies, the source of evil, the enemy of all 
righteousness. 

He has great power in the earth. He has deceived, and is deceiving, 
some people who have been and may now be members of the Church, 
but members in grave danger. One of his schemes is to give them a type 
of revelation, inducing them to believe that these come from heaven in- 
stead of from the devil. It is these people that are in urgent need of a 
warning. 

In writing to the Corinthians the Apostle Paul speaks of those 
opposing his labors as : 

false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves 

into the apostles of Christ. And no marvel; for Satan himself is trans- 
formed into an angel of light. Therefore it is no great thing if his 
ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose 
end shall be according to their works. (II Cor. 11:13-15.) 

Do you notice the similarity in method used in Paul's day and in 
this day by emissaries of Satan ? 

In Matthew, Chapter 24, Jesus in speaking of the signs and condi 
tions preceding His second coming is reported as saying : 

There shall arise false Christs, and false prophets and shall shew 
great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall 
deceive the very elect. (Matt. 24:24.) 

FALSE PROPHETS TODAY 

Do you know of any false prophets among us in these days — those 
misguided, lying, deceitful workers who claim to be the recipients of 
divine revelation? In the 7th Chapter of Matthew Jesus is again re- 
ported as saying : 

By their fruits ye shall know them. Not everyone that saith unto 
me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that 
doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven. Many will say unto 
me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and 
in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonder-

Saturday, April 5 Second Day 

ful works? And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: 
depart from me, ye that work iniquity. (Matt. 7:20-23.) 

There are many scriptural references, particularly in the Doctrine 
and Covenants, that might be given of the deceiving power of Satan. One 
found in the Book of Mormon bears directly upon the point I have in 
mind. It is found in the 30th Chapter of Alma. Korihor, an anti-Christ, 
was arrested and brought before Alma, the governor and chief judge, 
for teaching infidelity and leading the people into wickedness. Before 
the judge Korihor refused to desist from his position and demanded 
from Alma a sign that there is a God. When struck dumb Korihor wrote : 

The devil hath deceived me; for he appeared unto me in the form 
of an angel, and said unto me: Go and reclaim this people, for they have 
all gone astray after an unknown God .... And he taught me that 
which I should say, and I have taught his words (Alma 30:53.) 

Are all of us not acquainted with instances essentially like the one 
Alma relates of Korihor ? 

THE DECEIVED 

Occasionally there comes to my office and presumably to other offices 
in the building, an individual who claims he has a divine message for the 
Church or for President Grant. Of course, we give no credence to their 
claims. But I refer to their claims in illustration of the statement that 
our belief in modern revelation may be the means of leading away some 
of the people unless they are on their guard. Perhaps at no time in history 
did Satan have power as great as he has today. There was no time in the 
past when so many people believed in revelation as today. Satan tempts 
us where we are most vulnerable. He misleads a few into believing that 
the promptings that come from him are divine revelations. These false 
prophets in turn are seemingly so devout, so humble, so earnest and 
sincere that they, with Satan's help, are able to deceive and mislead 
many others — only those, however, who profess a belief in modern reve- 
lation. Thus heresies spring up, faith in our leaders is destroyed and the 
devil laughs because of his successes. The foolish who have been blinded 
have been led to believe that they are serving the cause of the Master 
when the fact is they are dupes of the devil. I speak plainly to avoid being 
misunderstood. 

There are adulterous men going about lying to and trying to deceive 
people into believing that the President and leaders of the Church have 
lost the spirit of their callings and have repudiated some Gospel prin- 
ciples. This is one of the ways in which the devil is working. 

INDIVIDUAL GUIDANCE 

We believe that an individual is entitled to divine guidance in his 
personal and material affairs. President Joseph F. Smith was reported 
in a Conference sermon as saying the following : 

Every man has the privilege to exercise these gifts (of revelation) 
in the conduct of his own affairs .... in the management of his farm, 
. his flocks, his herds and in the management of his business. 



ELDER JOSEPH F. MERRILL 



51 



I was once reliably told that President Wilford Woodruff advised 
going ahead with building the Lehi sugar factory, even though a com- 
mittee of business men had reported and decided against its feasibility. 
President Woodruff knew the project would be successful because the 
Lord had so indicated. But Satan has deceived many Church members 
by his devilish manifestations in matters of material projects. I called 
attention to one of those in a recent stake conference. No loyal Church 
member can logically expect a project to prosper when it has been dis- 
approved by two presidents of the Church. 

THE WORTHY MAY DETECT EVIL, 

Yes, the devil is among the Saints. Let them beware. He uses 
various means and methods — those that are found to be most effective, 
depending on many pertinent factors. He catches often those who are 
off their guard. None of us is secure from his wiles. To be as secure 
as may be we must have the help of the Lord. This is available if we 
worthily seek it. Every one in the Church must have it if he does well 
the work authoritatively assigned him to do. But no officer, no missionary 
can fully enjoy the work of his calling in the Church without the spirit 
thereof, which is given through the Holy Ghost. 

Brethren and sisters, let us not be deceived. There are many agents 
of Satan abroad in the land and some of them may be self -deceived, not 
knowing that they are in the power of the evil one. However, the spirit 
of the devil among this people may be detected by all honest, sincere 
members who keep the commandments of the Lord. The spirit of the 
Lord is comforting, joy-producing, love-inspiring, help-giving. The spirit 
of the devil is manifested in fault-finding, envy, selfishness, hatred, deceit, 
dishonesty, and produces misery, sin and crime. 

GUIDANCE THROUGH PRAYER 

Do the people of the Church want a safe guide to what is well for 
them to do ? It is this : Keep in harmony with the Presidency of this 
Church. Accept and follow the teachings and advice of the President. At 
every Conference we raise our hands to sustain the President as prophet, 
seer and revelator. Is it consistent to do this and then go contrary to 
his advice? Is anyone so simple as to believe he is serving the Lord 
when he opposes the President? Of course, the President is not infallible. 
He makes no claims to infallibility. But when in his official capacity he 
teaches and advises the members of the Church relative to their duties, 
let' no man who wants to please the Lord say aught against the counsels 
of the President. 

In the spirit of helpfulness let me give you a key. When in doubt 
go on your knees in humility with an open mind and a pure heart with a 
real desire to do the Lord's will, and pray earnestly and sincerely for 
divine guidance. Persist in praying in this way until you get an answer 
that fills your bosom with joy and satisfaction. It will be God's answer. 
If obedient to this answer you will always act as 'the President indicates. 
You will then be safe. God help us all to act wisely I pray in Christ's 
name. 




GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Second Day 



ELDER RICHARD L. EVANS 

Of the First Council of the Seventy 



As always, I declare my dependence upon the Spirit that motivates 
all of these proceedings. 



I was happy yesterday to hear President Grant and President Clark 
address part of their remarks to the young men of my generation who 
face a breaking up of the pattern of their lives by those events which we 
now face, and I was happy to hear them remembered, in the opening 
prayer this morning. We have lived to see the day when the best laid 
plans of men have gone wrong, and these young men are facing the post- 
ponement or abandonment of many of their ambitions and most cherished 
dreams and plans for their own futures. And as the young men are 
affected, so are the young women. We sympathize with them greatly. 

I met with such a group a week ago today, a group of M Men, and 
I felt them reaching for a message on this subject. I should like to have 
the ability briefly to deliver that message to them. 

I think it shouldn't be a time for too much pessimism and discour- 
agement, in spite of all the uncertainties. I think we should remind our- 
selves of the fact that there has always been uncertainty. No one ever 
lived in a static society. No one has ever had fixed guarantees that his 
way of life would not be interrupted, and I am sure that it is not a time 
for disrupting our plans. The time for preparation in the lives of our 
young men is altogether too short, and I feel in my heart that they should 
go forward with whatever they have in mind, and let interruption 
overtake them when and how it will. 

It certainly is not a time for living from hand to mouth. It is a time 
for laying broader foundations than ever before, because no matter what 
kind of world we find ourselves living in tomorrow, the best qualified 
men will always be in demand, and whether we are living here or not, 
we shall be living somewhere, and those intangible things that we acquire 
we shall take with us wherever we go. 



Some of our young men, and some of our mothers who are called 
upon to send them forth into service, wonder why they have to go. There 
have been some who have urged the Church and its members to declare 
themselves conscientious objectors. There may be some merits in this 
position. Perhaps we should reserve the right so to declare ourselves at 
some future time. I can think of possibilities and circumstances arising 
under which there could conceivably come some times and conditions 
for which we might want to reserve that right. But there are two sides 
to the question. Traditionally this has not been our position. In the 
century of our existence there is no people of like numbers that I know 
of anywhere in the world who have a better record for giving service 
when the call has come than this people. 



THE FUTURE AS IT AFFECTS YOUTH 



THE CALL TO ARMS 



ELDER RICHARD L. EVANS 



53 



No matter how ardently we may agree or disagree with those policies 
which have been and are being pursued in this regard, we are committed 
as a people to loyalty to constituted authority. That is true of our people 
in all the world, no matter what nation they may live in. 

There may be another reason why our young men should respond 
to this call. Many people, and we are among them I am sure, bitterly 
regret the fact that when war comes it takes the cream of our man- 
hood, it does not take the physically or the mentally unfit. It takes those 
who are best capable of rendering service, and we regret this fact most 
gravely. 

But there is another side, and I would like to quote a paragraph from 
one of our nationally known commentators and columnists which ap- 
peared in the press a short time ago. Speaking of all our defense prep- 
arations and the creation of materials for defense, he stated that it also 
should be remembered that these things 

can be used against us by an inside enemy just as easily as we can use 
them against an outside foe. This means a character-building cam- 
paign should be a definite part of our defense program. Now, more 
than ever before in the history of warfare, it is vital that the people of 
the strongest character should furnish the men who are to be trained 
for this new and all-important branch of our national defense. Let 
religious and civic leaders who are serious in their prayers re-read this 
last sentence. 

I am sure that you and I, since an army appears to be a necessary 
evil — it has always been so far as history tells us anything, in ancient 
Israel, in Book of Mormon times, and down to the present — since it 
appears to be a necessary evil under the conditions in which we live, I 
am sure that you and I would not care to have an army in our midst made 
up of the worst elements of our society. And I am sure that our young 
men who remember who they are and what they are can be a leaven and 
a wholesome influence in this service into which they go. This applies 
of course only to those who keep in mind their principles and their ideals 
and who always conduct themselves in accordance therewith. 

A LESSON FROM THE LIFE OF JACOB 

I am reminded of the story of Jacob in the Old Testament, in 
Genesis, when he was traveling in a strange land. Up to that time he had 
had limited experience and had been held close to home ties. But in this 
strange place he awoke one night after a dream and said. "Surely the 
Lord is in this place; and I knew it not." (Genesis 28:16) I would like 
our young men to remember that wherever they are, God is in that place 
and they must take Him into their confidence and conduct themselves in 
His ways. 

We cannot departmentalize the eternal record of our lives. It is 
one continued story. As Latter-day Saints we don't behave one way in 
the army and one way in business and another in Church. That is, not if 
we give heed to our principles. We do not behave one way at home and 
another way away from home. Wherever we are, remember that God 
is in this place also, and when the final record is written and read, all that 



54 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Saturday, April 5 Second Day 

we have done and thought, at home and abroad, in all the occupations 
and in all the pursuits that we may be called upon to undertake, is all a 
part of the eternal record of all of us, and it stands unalterably for us or 
against us. 

PREPARATION FOR LIFE SHOULD GO FORWARD 

And to those young people who are inclined to be discouraged by the 
course of events, those who are oppressed with the spirit of "What's the 
use?" we say to them, there will always be a future. Again quoting 
from Genesis a passage that is a comforting assurance: "While the 
earth remaineth, seed-time and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer 
and winter, and day and night shall not cease." (Genesis 8:22.) And 
we must not cease in our preparations or in our living of life to the 
fullest that we are able to do it in accordance with the conditions and 
opportunities of our own generation. If we make the best of all our 
circumstances of our own generation and time the Lord will ask no 
more of us. 

Life is not very long, I think. In the normal course of events mine 
is now half over, and I feel that I have scarcely put my foot in the door. 
I am sure that it isn't long enough to gamble any of the values of eternity 
against the values of time. And this thought recalls one of the most im- 
pressive passages from the Doctrine and Covenants, in which the Lord 
spoke to the Prophet Joseph Smith in one of his hours of deepest 
despair : 

My son, peace be unto thy soul; thine adversity and thine afflic- 
tions shall be but a small moment; and then, if thou endure it well, God 
shall exalt thee on high; thou shalt triumph over all thy foes. (Doctrine 
and Covenants 121 :7, 8.) 

And so I say to these young men of my generation : Go forth and 
live your lives in all of the fulness that is possible for you, and remember 
who you are and what you are, whether you are at home or abroad, in 
the army or out of it, and the Lord will bless you and prosper you and 
comfort you and reward you, and bring good out of all the circumstances 
of your lives. 

I leave you my testimony that I know that God lives ; that Jesus is 
the Christ ; that Joseph Smith and all of his successors have been prophets 
of God, and I do it in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 



ELDER RUFUS K. HARDY 

Of the First Council of the Seventy 

From "away down under" there is this that is said by that people : 
"A rain drop above and a chrysalis beneath," — their way of stating that 
God's beneficent kindness produces a beautiful race of human creatures. 
I think if that great race of lovely and intelligent people could have the 
privilege of seeing this gathering, they would know that what their 
forefathers and immediate ancestors declared to them is absolutely true.

CONFERENCE GATHERINGS IN THE TABERNACLE 

We come here twice each year, in April and in October, and have 
been doing so since 1867, the year this Tabernacle was dedicated, and each 
Conference since has been fraught with the splendid advice, the wonderful 
counsel, and the lovely and beautiful testimonies which have been borne 
here in the past and given to us already in this great April gathering of 
1941. We have had one hundred and forty-eight Conferences in this 
building since we started to hold Conferences here, and I think if there 
were gathered together that which has been expounded from this pulpit, 
the world would be greatly enriched as it never has been before, and we 
would know and understand better that which God desires us to under- 
stand, and feel assured of our future safety and of our daily and present 
actions. 

PREPARATIONS FOR WAR 

I am prompted somewhat along the line on which Brother Evans 
has just been speaking, for I have met with many mothers of boys who 
have been called away, and in my weak way I have tried to comfort 
them, and I fear all too hopelessly and inadequately. 

You know that in this old world and earth of ours today, mankind 
are running to and fro like ants whose hives have been disturbed, whose 
homes have been uprooted ; and that over the great expanse of the oceans 
these monstrous steel vessels are zigzagging the lanes of travel, bearing 
their precious burdens, while underneath dives the submarine to lurk 
beneath the waves and wait to destroy the floating vessels. Over and 
above all come the hissing sound and the roar of the bombing planes, 
which spread destruction and bring to us such fear. 

There is, however, a thought which comes in connection with this, 
and that is this : that in China and Japan, in Italy, in England, in Ger- 
many, in Norway, in Rumania, in almost every spot of the earth men are 
preparing for that which Satan himself desires. He, if possible, would 
have his own way, and that is the death of mankind. Away down under- 
neath us, in those beautiful jewel-like islands of the Pacific, even in 
them, men are dressing and robing themselves in the attire of the soldier, 
and the accouterments of war are being gathered by them. Their faces 
are stern ; smiles have left their countenances, unless it is the smirk ; and 
their hearts are as lead. The cries of their women-folk go up to heaven 
for the assuaging of their sorrows and the bringing of relief from that 
which they face. 

PROPHECIES OF WARNING AND OF COMFORT 

God has said some things in prophecies concerning this. All this 
evil is done in order that some may acquire that which they do not 
possess or rightfully claim. To each and every child born upon this 
earth God gave a portion of it. It has been bestowed upon him by right 
of heirship from Adam, and even before this earth was formed, the 
Lord said :

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Second Day 



We will go down, for there is space there, and we will take of 
these materials, and we will make an earth whereon these may dwell; 
and we will prove them herewith, to see if they will do all things 
whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them. 

Now, out of all this greed and lust for power comes, as I say, this 
terrible confusion. I am impressed more each day with the fact that God 
is my refuge. 

We, the people of this Church — and I say this not in any way of 
arrogance, no, but from my youth and from my earliest recollections there 
has come ringing down to me, through the various voices of the Presi- 
dents of this Church whom I have known, this great cry — and I believe 
that you and I, we all of us have answered it ; it is significant that from 
almost every nation of this earth there are people here assembled who 
have answered this cry : 

Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, 
and that ye receive not of her plagues. 

So that, so far as we are concerned, unquestionably we have com- 
plied with and listened to the wisdom that is from above, for "the hearing 
ear and the seeing eye, God hath made them both." 

And then declares Isaiah this : 

He that walketh righteously and speaketh uprightly; he that 
despiseth the gain of oppressions, that shaketh his hands from hold- 
ing of bribes, that stoppeth his ears from hearing of blood, and shutteth 
his eyes from seeing evil; 

He shall dwell on high; his place of defense shall be the munitions 
of rocks; bread shall be given him; his waters shall be sure. 

THE PROMISES OF THE LORD SURE OF FULFILMENT 

God is not unmindful of His children. God will do that which in 
His own way He has seen from the beginning, that which is today and 
that which has come before, that which He directs and continues to 
control, as surely as we live upon this earth. 

There is a promise, and that promise has been repeated and reiterated 
from this stand hundreds of times. I would like all the Saints to remem- 
ber that promise. It is this: 

And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of 
the Lord's house shall be established in the top of the mountains, and 
shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow unto it. 

And many people shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to 
the mountain of the Lord, to the house of the God of Jacob; and he 
will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths; for out of 
Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem. 

So I say, let all of us draw in from our wanderings and distress of 
mind, and rely upon God and what He has promised. Surely there shall 
come to us comfort and there should come to us a greater knowledge 
than to any other people upon this earth, that if we do that which we 
profess, God is with us, His people, and all others that obey Him, and 
that all is right in the heavens above and on the earth beneath.

THE STAKE MISSIONARY WORK 

We are doing not only all that we can do for our own beloved land, 
as a nation, but we are doing for those who dwell in our immediate 
vicinity that which God commanded us to do. Our missionaries are 
scattering abroad the truths which they have received. It was my pleasure 
to tell you, a year ago, that during the year 1939 the Stake missionaries 
had performed 2,220 baptisms ; and again I say to you that last year, in 
1940, the same missionary group of splendid men and women brought 
into this Church 2,203 converts. 

This work goes on apace, and God is calling more unto the fold each 
day and doing more for them and for our communities as a whole. With 
cheerful hearts these missionaries have gone out and performed this 
labor of love with the help and assistance of the splendid Stake presi- 
dencies which we have in the Church. So I say, with grateful hearts 
let us give unto God the honor and the glory and the praise. 

Above everything else may we have that sweet assurance which He 
has given through His servants to us, from this stand, and from His 
servant, Joseph Smith, and all the revelations of scripture which have 
been given to us, that we shall, through obedience to the laws and ordi- 
nances of this Gospel, not be destroyed but ultimately gain salvation and 
our reward. I ask that in Jesus' name, Amen.

ELDER MARVIN O. ASHTON 

First Counselor in the Presiding Bishopric 

Some of you wonder why some of us who have the responsibility 
which is mine at this particular moment frequently ask for guidance 
from above. If some of you had this responsibility I believe you would 
be asking for the same help. 

It has just been my pleasure to make a visit to the Hawaiian Islands. 
I am sure those who have been to this beautiful country will not be at 
all surprised if, in the few weak words I may say on this particular oc- 
casion I refer to these islands and those wonderful people. 

A LESSON DRAWN FROM FISHING IN HAWAII 

In speaking of guidance from above, I am reminded that some of us 
take ourselves very seriously, in fact too seriously, sometimes. If we 
would continually seek for guidance from above, we would all be better 
off. In the Hawaiian Islands, they catch fish in different ways. One of 
the parts played in the most popular way of fishing is to have one of the 
natives go to a precipice or high mountain overlooking the bay, or the 
place where they fish, and he, from that particular viewpoint, directs the 
fishing. By the way, as you go over the islands in an airplane and you 
look down in the water, you find it as clear as crystal. You can see the 
coral below. Of course, he can see the schools of fish as they move 



58 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Saturday, April 5 Second Day 



about. This man on the heights scans the water below, locates the school 
of fish, signals to the natives below. They go out sometimes with a mile 
of net and corral, if you please, the fish, and, of course, all is accomplish- 
ed by this continual signalling back and forth. Without this guidance 
from above the fishermen would make many a false move. Much of his 
work would be guesswork, there would be much lost motion because of 
a lack of vision. 

That little story of fishing has meant much to me. We can't get 
very far unless we have communication from above. There must be 
signalling going on between us on earth and One on high. We are some- 
times so close to the forest we don't see the trees. Sometimes if the 
source of our guidance were farther away, we would see more clearly. 
Our work would be easier and our catch greater if we had communica- 
tion from above. 

EXPERIENCE BROADENED BY PERSPECTIVE 

This trip to Hawaii and our contact with this new people reminded 
me of the story of a little bird. I think the story was in an old reader. 
The bird first lived in a pale blue shell and it thought the whole world 
was pale blue. Its next experience was a nest, and it thought the whole 
world was feathers and sticks. Its next vision was from the top of the 
nest. After the mother and father had crowded it out, it thought the 
whole world was green leaves. One day, in the course of the education 
by the parents, the children were pushed out of the tree and they found 
a big world before them. Sometimes I think we are like the little bird. 
Our thinking apparatus, if you please, works, depending on what our 
experience is. We sometimes think the whole world is a pale blue shell 
because our experience is so limited. Our gauge is broadened by the 
experience we get when we get out of that tree. We have a better per- 
spective of things. 

These Hawaiian people — I have had some thrilling moments in my 
life. I often think back on those things in my life that have been thrill- 
ing moments. I want to say very frankly and clearly here that never 
have I been thrilled more than in the contact with those people. Sometimes 
we get a notion that all the virtues belong to the white race. We will 
change our minds some day. 

A TRIBUTE TO THE PEOPLE IN HAWAII 

Speaking of the Hawaiian Mission under Brother Cox and the 
Japanese Mission under Jay Jensen, those men are doing a wonderful 
piece of work. As I have said, I have had a lot of thrills, but I' have 
never been thrilled more than two weeks ago today, at the Fast Meeting 
of those Japanese people. Boys and girls from fifteen up, two at a time, 
crowded to the front to bear their testimonies. Those people are won- 
derful people. Those Chinese people, the Japanese, the Hawaiians, and 
what not, some of those dark-skinned people have the best blood flow- 
ing through their veins of any people that the Lord ever created. Some 
time we will find it out.

They sing because they have to. It is spontaneous combustion, if 
you please. They love because they must love. They put a lei around 
your neck. Love prompts it and in their bestowing the lei they expect 
only love in return. It gives you a sweat bath by the time they get you 
decorated the way they do; but better than a sweat bath around your 
neck is the warmth that comes to your heart. You can't get away from 
it. There you find nature in the rough, if you please, but not very great 
emphasis on the "rough." There were some of the highest class, best 
educated people that I have ever met among those people ; they are cul- 
tured and refined. 

I want to state here that if you ever have had in your philosophy : 
"God bless me and my wife, and our son John and his wife, us four and 
no more" — if you have got that in your system, take a trip to the Islands. 
It will do you a wonderful lot of good. Hawaii is the gateway to the 
Pacific, the gateway to the Orient. Millions and millions of people, the 
best people in the world are there. 

I sometimes believe in order that our thinking be straight and our 
conduct right that we have to go up-stream once in a while to the source 
of the fountain — go back to Christ. What is the Gospel ? Do we pervert 
it sometimes ? Do we adulterate it ? Do we get away from the original 
article? My experience with those people taught me that they have a 
wholesomeness, a piece of that original Gospel spirit that we shouldn't 
get away from. Sometimes we do pervert it ; we change it. With all 
of our civilization and the advantages that come with it, our thinking is 
corrupted. We so change the original article that the one looking for 
the real thing can't recognize the substitute. 

I heard this story the other day. It did me good. An antique wor- 
shipper — you have them all through this country ; some of your wives 
are antique worshippers. (Laughter.) Maybe I didn't mean that, just the 
way that you took it. If you think I meant some of your husbands, well, let 
it go. This antique worshipper was going about in Virginia. He came to a 
farm where they were doing some advertising of antiques. His eye 
spied an old man out in the yard chopping wood. In his scrutinizing 
this thing and that, he went up to the man and the conversation was about 
as follows : "How do you do ?" He said : "It looks like an old axe that 
you are using." The old man stopped. Said he : "Yes, they have said 
that this is an axe that George Washington used to use." Of course, the 
eyes of the antique lover bulged. Exclaimed he, "My dear man, if that 
is the axe George Washington used, I would give you a right good price 
for it." The old man grinned. "The only trouble is, if this was the axe 
that George Washington used, I know this is the third head it has had 
and the fifth handle." 

In the spirit we do things and in our interpretation of the Gospel, 
that is exactly what we are doing. We have changed the head several 
times and what we are chopping with has had thrust into it the fifth 
handle. We have to go back up-stream sometimes to see what the real 
spirit of the Gospel really is. In those islands you find it. I want to say 
that.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Second Day 



THE MENACE OF INTOXICANTS 

Just one more word in closing : In my observation, in going to and 
fro, including life on the boat, including conduct going to restaurants, it 
is my judgment that America never was going at such a pace as she is 
going right now in this liquor business. We are going fast and furious. 
It will take stamina of steel to stem the tide. I never was more im- 
pressed in my life. We are going drink crazy. The example we are 
setting the youth is criminal. 

We members of the Bishopric are to be forgiven if we continually 
hammer on this youth question. Speaking again of the youth, I saw a 
sight that impressed me much. Will you please let me tell you about it ? 
A good bishop was taking me on an inspection trip about the island. In 
the course of our travels he said, "I want to show you something. You 
probably haven't seen anything like this before." He was right — I had 
not. All over the islands everywhere were cocoanut trees. Everywhere 
they stood erect with their fruit to the sun. They were in most everyone's 
yard and on many of the highways. He repeated, "I want to show you 
something." He took me to a yard and there on the ground crawling as 
it were, like a great SO-foot python snake was a cocoanut tree. It did 
everything but cut the figure 8 in sprawling and looping the loop. In- 
stead of keeping its head up and majestically filling its destiny in the 
world, that ten inch monster was crawling in the dust. 

I thought to myself : Well, there is the way some of our youth are 
brought up. Somebody, when that plant was just taking root, gave it a 
kick. Even then, when yet tender if someone had only given it a kind 
touch, it would have gone straight. Instead of the tree facing the sun, 
its fruit toward the sun, there it was sprawled on the ground — too late, 
the day of correction past. 

That is our great problem. It is going to take courage to stem the 
tide. The enemy are the millions. I often think of that story of the Greek 
at Thermopylae. When he was told that the arrows of the Persians 
darkened the sun, he said, "So much the better. We will fight in the 
shade." Yes, in this fight against this demon, liquor, we'll have to fight 
in the shade. Let's put on our shield and may we fight on with the same 
undaunted valor of the Greek youth, whose mother buckled on his shield 
and said, "Come with it or on it." 

May the Lord bless us with courage — if we ever needed it, it is to- 
day. Amen. 

ELDER JOSEPH L. WIRTHLIN 

Second Counselor in the Presiding Bishopric 

I sincerely trust, my brethren and sisters, that I shall enjoy a 
portion of the Spirit of the Lord in the attempt to address you this 
morning. 

THE TEACHINGS OF A GOOD MOTHER 

I am ever grateful to an angel mother for the many lessons she 
taught me with respect to the Gospel of Jesus Christ and the inspired 



ELDER JOSEPH L. WIRTHLIN 



61 



leadership that stands at the head of this Church. I distinctly recall 
how she took me, as a small child, to her knee and impressed upon me 
the fact that Joseph Smith was a prophet; and furthermore, she im- 
pressed me with her burning testimony that the present leadership of 
this Church, and for all time, is and would be inspired men of God. 

THE LEADERS OF THE CHURCH SERVANTS OF GOD 

I am now grateful that I can testify to you that this great organi- 
zation is being directed by our Heavenly Father through the instrumen- 
tality of prophets and apostles of the Lord Jesus Christ. Those of us 
who listened to President Grant yesterday, had in our hearts a burning 
feeling that he is, indeed, a prophet of the Lord, that there rests upon 
him the same mantle of authority that Joseph Smith and Brigham 
Young enjoyed, and all other Presidents of the Church who have suc- 
ceeded them as the Lord's mouthpiece here upon earth. 

It is a most wonderful privilege to covenant with the Lord periodi- 
cally that we will sustain these brethren as servants of God and obey 
the counsel they impart to us. In following their counsel and advice, 
we will always be found doing those things which will be for our 
ultimate good and benefit. 

OBEDIENCE A SAVING PRINCIPLE 

There is one lesson the world needs to learn, namely, the lesson 
of obedience. Had the children of men been obedient to the command- 
ments of the Lord, the terrible catastrophe that is now taking place in 
Europe could have been prevented. But through disobedience and the 
fact that men have forgotten the Lord and what He expects of them, 
calamity and ruin have come upon the nations. 

I would that all of us could learn and understand the principle of 
obedience as Adam learned and understood it. He was commanded to 
build altars upon which to offer sacrifices. And upon one occasion, 
after having complied with this commandment, an angel of the Lord 
appeared to him and asked him the question: 

Why dost thou offer sacrifices unto the Lord? And Adam said 
unto him: I know not, save the Lord commanded me. 

And then the angel spake, saying: This thing is a similitude of the 
sacrifice of the Only Begotten of the Father, which is full of grace and 
truth. (Moses 5:6-7.) 

In Adam's mind there was no question why he should render 
obedience, for he knew that whatever the Lord commanded him to do 
would be for his good and benefit. 

It is interesting to note that after Adam had fulfilled the com- 
mandment of offering up sacrifices, the Lord rewarded him with a 
visitation from a divine being, imparting to Adam the knowledge why 
he was to offer sacrifices. And this applies to each and everyone of us 
when obeying the commandments of the Gospel. We may not under- 
stand them fully ; but through obedience, the Lord will reveal to us the 



62 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Saturday, April 5 Second Day 

reason and the knowledge which will give us a full, clear comprehension 
of the law or the commandment involved. 

This point of obedience without a complete understanding is denned 
so beautifully by Montaigne. He declared: 

The first law that ever God gave to man was a law of pure 
obedience. It was a commandment, naked and simple, wherein man 
had nothing to inquire about, after, or dispute for inasmuch as to obey 
is the proper office of a rational soul, acknowledging a heavenly, 
superior benefactor, from obedience and submission spring all victory, 
as all sin does from selfish opinion. 

Carlyle declared, too: 

Obedience is our uniform duty and destiny, wherein whoso will 
not bend must break. 

The Lord through the Prophet Joseph Smith has plainly indicated 
that the achievement of any blessing is predicated upon obedience. In 
the 130th Section of the Doctrine and Covenants, we read: 

And if a person gains more knowledge and intelligence in this life 
through his diligence and obedience than another, he will have so 
much the advantage in the world to come. 

There is a law, irrevocably decreed in heaven before the founda- 
tions of this world, upon which all blessings are predicated — 

And when we obtain any blessing from God, it is by obedience 
to that law upon which it is predicated. (D. & C. 130:19-21.) 

Success, spiritually and temporally, will only be achieved to the 
degree that the laws involved are obeyed. The highest degree of success 
is accomplished by rendering the fullest degree of obedience to the 
fundamentals and the principles of the Gospel of Jesus Christ ; and the 
same is true in any line of endeavor that we may choose to follow. 

DISOBEDIENCE BRINGS ITS OWN PUNISHMENT 

Disobedience represents that which is negative. It had its incep- 
tion in the great council of heaven where one of the sons of God took 
a negative attitude and stand toward the Lord. Consequently, disobedi- 
ence leads men away from the Lord and places them in the paths of 
sin, degradation, and failure. Brother Merrill indicated to us this morn- 
ing that we should harken unto the affirmative spirit, that spirit being 
best expressed in obedience to the mind and will of our Heavenly 
Father. 

The Prophet Jeremiah pointed out in unmistakable terms that in 
disobedience the people brought upon them their own punishment. He 
declared : 

Thine own wickedness shall correct thee, and thy backslidings 
shall reprove thee: know therefore and see that it is an evil thing and 
bitter, that thou hast forsaken the Lord thy God, and that my fear is 
not in thee, saith the Lord God of hosts. (Jeremiah 2:19.) 

This ancient prophet points out plainly that in disobedience the 
children of men always find a penalty involved, just as much so as there is 



ELDER JOSEPH L. WIRTHLIN 



63 



a reward for rendering obedience to the Lord. The Lord, too, has 
declared : 

And my people must needs be chastened until they learn obedience, 
if it must needs be, by the things which they suffer. (D. & C. 105:6.) 

Brigham Young declared: 

Anything that is impure must sooner or later perish, no matter 
whether it is in the faith and practice of the individual, town, nation, or 
government. That kingdom, principality, power, or person that is not 
controlled by principles that are pure and holy must eventually pass 
away and perish. 

Disobedience begets that which is impure and the penalty involved 
is that of destruction. 

The children of Israel were a chastened people. The Lord harkened 
unto their cries for deliverance from bondage, and under the leadership 
of the Prophet Moses, led them out of Egypt across the Red Sea, and 
into the wilderness. They became disobedient. Unholy practices sprang 
up among them. They forgot God. They worshiped the golden calf. 
The penalty for this disobedience was one which forced them to wander 
for 40 long years in the wilderness before they finally understood the 
lesson of obedience. 

OBEDIENCE SHOWN BY EARLY LATTER-DAY SAINT PIONEERS 

Our pioneer fathers and mothers came into this valley, conquered 
the elements, and subdued the soil, achieving the highest place among 
American pioneers because they harkened unto the will and the mind of 
the Lord, made manifest through His servants, the prophets. 

Brigham Young said: 

The Latter-day Saints, in all their travels, have not been as 
rebellious as the children of Israel were. 

One of the most interesting and intriguing bits of Mormon history 
is that which had to do with the group of pioneers who made the long, 
weary trek from the Missouri River to these mountains. Shortly there- 
after many of them were called to settle the San Bernardino Valley in 
southern California. The terrain from the Salt Lake Valley to the San 
Bernardino Valley is one of waste and desert, particularly the great 
Mojave Desert. But they were under mandate to make the journey, 
and obeyed accordingly. This band of devoted Latter-day Saints re- 
mained in the San Bernardino district for six years. A large portion of 
the original purchase of 35,000 acres of land was cultivated, schools 
were established, store buildings and churches were erected, a flour 
mill and saw mills were placed in operation; and this area became a 
thriving, prosperous community. 

The New York Herald gleaned from the San Francisco Herald 
that the Mormon settlement was in a valley — 

.... unsurpassed for fertility of soil, salubrity of climate, beauty of 
scenery, and general desirableness, by any portion of the State. Their 
agricultural interest is larger than that of Santa Barbara, Los Angeles, 
and San Diego Counties united, and the capabilities of producing are 
much better. 




GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Second Day 



These people had a bright future. But one day, word was received 
from Salt Lake City that they were to return immediately. An invading 
army was on the boundaries of the State of Utah. Without question the 
members of the San Bernardino colony left their pleasant homes, farms, 
mills, schools, and once more traversed the barren wastes of the Mojave 
Desert. And what was their response? Willingly they rendered obedi- 
ence to the word of the Prophet of God. This quality of obedience laid 
the foundations for this great intermountain commonwealth in which 
we live. And it was this type of obedience which made it possible for 
our Heavenly Father, through His servants, to restore the Church of 
the Lord Jesus Christ in the last days. 

I have often wondered what became of these people after they re- 
turned to Utah. I wonder if they were blessed temporally. I have 
wondered what their' attitude was. I am sure that if we could have an 
expression from them it would be phrased in the words of the Christ : 

For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world 
and lose his own soul? (Mark 8:36.) 

So, again, may I remind you of these words spoken by our Redeemer : 

I, the Lord, am bound when ye do what I say, but when ye do not 
what I say, ye have no promise. (D. & C. 82:10.) 

Our pioneer fathers leaned on the Lord and rendered obedience; 
and He has kept His promises in that they and we, their descendants, 
have been abundantly blessed. 



Making reference to the valleys of Utah, Brigham Young said: 

Talk about these rich valleys, why there is not another people on 
the earth that could have come here and lived. We prayed over the 
land, and dedicated it and the water, air and everything pertaining 
to them unto the Lord, and the smiles of heaven rested on the land 
and it became productive, and today yields us the best of grain, fruit 
and vegetables. 

The Lord blessed the people who were obedient. Their obedience 
has brought the blessings of heaven upon this fair land. It has become 
as a garden, blessed with a varied abundance of all that goes to make life 
pleasant and comfortable. We of today are the recipients of blessings 
literally wrought out of the obedience of our forefathers. 



The Lord definitely kept His promise at the time President Snow 
traveled up and down the State pleading with the people to be obedient 
to the command of tithing, promising them in the name of Israel's God 
that the windows of heaven would be literally opened and the blessings 
of heaven showered down upon them. The crops of the southern part of 
the State were parching and drying up because of a lack of moisture. 
The people harkened to the voice of the Prophet of the Lord. They 
obeyed the commandment of tithing. Rain fell. Crops were saved. And

PROMISES OF THE LORD SURE OF FULFILMENT 



ELDER JOSEPH L. WlRTHLlN 



65 



from that day to this, the Church has rested on a strong financial foun- 
dation due to the obedience of many of its members to the financial law 
of God's Kingdom. 

President Grant admonishes the membership of the Church to 
keep the Word of Wisdom, the promise of the Lord being that those 
who observe the Lord's law of health will be blessed with alert minds 
and strong bodies. More than that, He has promised to us revelations 
which will give to the world treasures of hidden knowledge. As a people, 
we should be the most obedient to the Lord in the whole world because 
we are a covenant people. We have entered the House of Jacob's 
God, which House was to be established in the tops of the mountains 
in the last days ; and in this Holy of Holies we have covenanted with 
the Lord that we will contribute of our time, talents, and resources for 
the building up of the Kingdom. Like Adam of old we should be will- 
ing to obey, for we accept God the Eternal Father as our God, and 
Jesus Christ as the Redeemer. 

OUR OBLIGATION TO THE WORLD 

The world needs an example in obedience. The Lord has desig- 
nated us as that example. Our destiny as a people is one of leadership. 
And the day is not far distant when the nations now engaged in this 
bloody struggle will finally come to the conclusion that war is futile, 
that it is entirely useless to kill men and destroy property. They will 
seek for a philosophy of life which will bring peace, harmony, and good 
will among them ; and they will find it only in one place and among but 
one people — that place will be in the tops of these mighty mountains 
and among this people, the covenant people who call themselves Latter- 
day Saints. 

A great responsibility devolves upon us, individually and collectively 
— an obligation to exemplify to the world in our lives and through obeying 
God's commandments, that the Restored Gospel of Jesus Christ is upon 
the earth in its fulness and simplicity, and obedience to it brings peace, 
joy, and good will. May we render that degree of obedience which will 
cause the Lord to say of us as He did the children of ancient Israel : 

Now therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my cove- 
nant, then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people: 
for all the earth is mine. (Exo. 19:5.) 

Through the Prophet Joseph Smith He placed upon us the following 
mandate in the 115th Section of the Doctrine and Covenants: 

Verily I say unto you all: Arise and shine forth, that thy light 
may be a standard for the nations. (D. & C. 115:5.) 

This is the destiny of the Church. This is the challenge of the 
Lord to His people. 

May the Lord so strengthen us individually and collectively that 
we will willingly render the necessary obedience which will exemplify 
the principles of the Gospel to all men and to all the world, I humbly 
pray, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. 



66 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Saturday, April 5 Second Day 

ELDER RICHARD R. LYMAN 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

Christ Himself, that highest authority, said : "Blessed are the peace- 
makers: for they shall be called the children of God." (Matt. 5:9) 
Nothing does the world need more these days than peacemakers. And 
if out of the conflicts of battle which are now going forward with un- 
precedented fury can come those who can and do plan a permanent peace, 
truly all such will be children of God. 

THREATENING FORCES 

These are not ordinary days. We live in momentous times. A 
survey of conditions in the troubled world of today reveals the fact that 
we have made little if any progress toward that peace and good will 
which the Savior of mankind taught nineteen centuries ago. Civilized 
nations of the earth are marshalling their man-power and their material 
resources for war and for defense on a scale the world has never known 
before. Forces are abroad in the earth which threaten the overthrow of 
liberty, of democracy and of our way of life, if not of our very civiliza- 
tion. War, devastating, destructive and barbarous, is scourging the air, 
the sea and the land. These are anxious days for all of us. More than 
16J4 million of our young men between the ages of 21 and 36 have al- 
ready registered for service in the United States. I repeat that for all of 
us these are anxious days. 

Two important questions present themselves to those who ponder 
this situation. 

1. What can we do about it? 

2. What will come after it? 

FAITH, THE ONLY REMEDY 

The ingenuity of man seems powerless to stay the dreadful ravages 
of modern war. The world is in distress, it is struggling in agony be- 
cause men in their selfishness have forgotten God; they have forsaken 
the ways of truth, mercy, justice and righteousness. Somehow or other 
the fate of mankind hangs on faith in the Creator of the world. 

The religion of the Latter-day Saints, which is the religion of our 
Lord and Master Jesus Christ, contains and presents the forces that make 
for righteousness and peace in the earth. Morality centers in religion. 
Without its saving power democracy cannot survive. Selfishness, greed, 
ambition and lust for power always, if they go unbridled, manifest them- 
selves in contention and bloodshed. Unless these tendencies are chasten- 
ed and controlled by the spirit written in the Sermon on the Mount, unless 
the unselfish spirit of the Gospel of Jesus Christ finds a place in the 
hearts of men and manifests itself in their relationship one to another, 
civilization is sure to decline. Righteousness is fundamental to the peace 
and progress of the world. How can this spirit be cultivated? What 
can be done to bring to the world that peace for which we pray ? How 
can we cultivate and make effective the spirit of the Master? These are 
pertinent questions that should be asked these days.

"seek and ye shall find" 

I shall submit to you good folks for your consideration two very 
simple but fundamental ways which in the end, if faithfully followed, will 
help to bring peace of mind and ultimate prosperity by establishing a 
partnership with Him to whom nothing is impossible. Prayer is the first 
approach to the Almighty. He is, always has been and forever will 
continue to be our strength and our refuge. We know that He still lives 
and that He reigns on high. Christ Himself said : 

Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and 
it shall be opened unto you: For everyone that asketh receiveth; and 
he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened. 
(Matthew 7:7-8.) 

The religion of the Latter-day Saints brings to the world the bright 
assurance that God the Eternal Father is still in His Heaven keeping 
watch over His children. He holds in His hands the destiny of men and 
the destiny of nations. In His own time and in His own appointed way, 
He will see that righteousness is rewarded, that justice is meted out, and 
finally that truth will triumph. I am of the firm conviction that only 
through a real return to true religion can a permanent peace come to the 
world. There is no other way. 

APPEAL TO ATTEND SACRAMENT MEETINGS 

One of the two simple ways in which Latter-day Saints may come 
into communion and partnership with our Heavenly Father is in our 
weekly Sacrament meetings. We do not attend these meetings primarily 
to get knowledge or to be taught, but to worship, to partake of the sacra- 
ment, to bow our heads, close our eyes, repent of our wrong doings, feel 
sorry for our sins, ask to be forgiven and appeal to our Heavenly Father 
for His help and guidance in our efforts to overcome our weaknesses. 
These meetings have a specific purpose to build up the spirituality, to 
increase the faith, to strengthen the testimony, to fill the soul with a zeal 
for the truth, and hearts with a love for the Redeemer of the world. 

I appeal to all Latter-day Saints to come to these places of worship 
and there in deep humility and with contrite hearts make of the Lord 
a confidential friend, tell Him of our weaknesses, confess our shortcom- 
ings and seek devoutly for forgiveness, remembering that one great 
glorious and comforting principle of the Gospel is repentance and for- 
giveness. The scripture tells us : 

Though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be white as snow; 
though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool. (Isaiah 1:18.) 

When we have truly repented, when we have set our own houses in 
order, let us remember that if we ask "with faith as a grain of mustard 
seed" nothing shall be impossible. (Matt. 17:20) 

POWER IN PRAYER 

The other of the two ways of coming into communion with our 
Heavenly Father is around the family altar in daily family prayer and 



68 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Saturday, April 5 Second Day 

in making our secret prayerful appeals. There is power in prayer. Roger 
W. Babson says that in these days and times some of our men of wealth, 
some of our great empire builders, ridicule religion, but he adds further 
that these very men are indebted for all that they possess to the family 
prayers which were once held daily in the homes of their fathers. 

Dr. Alexis Carrel, famous scientific investigator, has said recently 
(Readers Digest, March, 1941) that prayer is the most powerful form 
of energy that man can generate, that its effect on the human mind and 
body is as easily and certainly detected as is the effect of the secretion of 
the glands that exists in the human system. Its results can be measured 
in increased physical buoyancy, in greater intellectual vigor, in greater 
moral stamina and in a deeper understanding of the realities underlying 
human relationships. Prayer is the beginning of the journey of the soul 
toward the realm of grace. It supplies human beings with a steady flow 
of sustaining power in their daily lives. Prayer, like radium, is a source 
of luminous, self-generating energy. "When we pray we link ourselves 
with the inexhaustible motive power that spins the universe." We may 
pray anywhere, in the street, the office, the shop, the school, as well as in 
the solitude of a secret chamber, or in a church. In conclusion he writes : 

Today as never before prayer is a vital necessity in the lives of 
men and of nations. The lack of emphasis of the religious sense has 
brought the world to the edge of destruction. Our deepest source of 
power and perfection has been left miserably undeveloped. Prayer, the 
basic exercise of the spirit, must be actively practiced in our private 
lives. The neglected soul of man must be made strong enough to 
assert itself once more, for if the power of prayer is again released 
and used in the lives of common men and women, if the spirit declares 
its aims clearly and boldly, there is yet hope that our prayers for a 
better world will be answered. 

THE TWO SOURCES OF SECURITY 

My appeal, therefore, is that we assemble regularly on the Sabbath 
day in our various Wards and there partake worthily of the Sacrament 
of the Lord's Supper, and that daily in our homes around our family 
altars as well as in secret we humbly and sincerely appeal to our Heavenly 
Father that that peace, for which Christian people everywhere are plead- 
ing, that blessing which all men most need today, may by the power of 
God be brought to all mankind. Then our lives and our motives will be 
purified and our faith in the Almighty will wax strong. Being thus es- 
tablished in the confidence and fellowship of our Heavenly Father there 
will come to us a feeling of strength and of silent, satisfying security, of 
an unselfish determination and desire to serve and to bless those with 
whom we mingle. As Paul declared : 

Let us remember the words of the Lord Jesus how he said, It is 
more blessed to give than it is to receive. (Acts 20:35.) 

When the selfishness of mankind vanishes, peace on earth will come. 
The way to peace and happiness then is to return to the Almighty, to 
cultivate His Spirit, to supplicate Him, and to plead for a forgiveness of 
our sins and shortcomings. Through a consistent attendance at Sacra- 



ELDER RICHARD R. LYMAN 



69 



ment meetings, if we partake of the holy Sacrament with clean hands and 
pure hearts, we renew our covenants with the Almighty with assurance 
that those who do so acceptably shall have the most precious blessing 
bestowed upon man, that is "His Spirit to be with them." 

war's consequences 

Now to the second division of my subject. What will come after? 
When this great war ends fatigue and famine, bitterness and the memory 
of wrongs inflicted, and of outrages suffered will make impossible a good 
and lasting peace unless by divine power those who prepare the terms 
have in their hearts the spirit of the Prince of Peace and can proceed as 
did Lincoln, "With malice toward none and with charity for all." As 
long as a desire for revenge or punishment guides those who prepare the 
conditions of peace rather than a desire to create conditions of confidence 
and good will, wars and rumors of wars will scourge the earth. Even 
in our own beloved land of liberty it seems that in these trying times 
many prefer the satisfaction of retaliation rather than the spirit of for- 
giveness and peace with equal consideration for all people. These ap- 
parently are unable to understand that great fundamental doctrine that 
it is more blessed to give than it is to receive. 

Far-seeing statesmen and economists are agreed that at the close of 
this war a depression much greater than those which have followed other 
wars is sure to come. The world will be compelled to struggle with the 
financial, economic and social aftermath of the present furious conflicts 
which are being waged on many battle fronts. 

The length and the severity of a war determine the length and the 
severity of the depression which follows it. The greater the destruction, 
the greater the depression. Famine, pestilence, plagues, diseases and 
poverty will no doubt come in a more or less serious degree to the people 
of all nations when this death struggle comes to its close. And for this 
reason I repeat the appeal that has been made from the beginning by the 
leaders of the Church that all the people as far as possible get out of 
debt and keep out of debt. 

PEACE THROUGH JUSTICE AND CHARITY 

Truly in these days, at this very hour, the world's greatest need is 
peacemakers. And I repeat, if out of the conflicts, out of the battles which 
are now raging, those can come who can and will plan a lasting peace, 
one with malice toward none and with justice and charity for all, these 
will be, they must be now and forever numbered among the very choicest, 
the most select and most richly blessed of all the children of God. 

In conclusion, I appeal again to you to do these two things : 1. At- 
tend Sacrament meetings faithfully; 2. Participate regularly in daily 
family and secret prayers. If we all can and will do these two things, 
if we can live the unselfish Christian life, the testimony that Jesus is the 
Christ will burn in our souls and we will walk with confidence among 
our fellowmen, disseminating the spirit of the Redeemer of the world, 
which is the spirit of peace and the spirit of good will.

I repeat : Please drive carefully, the streets are very slippery ; and 
pedestrians will be good enough to walk cautiously and carefully. 

We would like particularly to say a word of commendation to the 
Blackfoot Stake Choir. Some of the members of this Choir have traveled 
regularly to their rehearsals a distance of fifty miles, and they have never 
missed a rehearsal. This represents what the Church Music Committee 
is trying to do in ail of our Stakes. I would like to say to the Utah Valley 
people and the Brigham Young University that they must look to their 
laurels for up in the Snake River Valley there is a group that is pressing 
very hard on their heels.

ELDER SYLVESTER Q. CANNON 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

I have been greatly impressed, my brethren and sisters, by the im- 
portant testimony given by President Grant yesterday morning, the fine 
expression that he gave to us of the things that impressed him and that 
have influenced him greatly during his life. I realize that the work he 
has done and the testimony he has borne to us are a source of guidance to 
all of us, and a realization that he is indeed a servant of the Lord, a 
prophet of God. He enjoys the power and keys of authority that were 
given to him some twenty-two years ago, and he has testified to us in 
clearness and inspiration with regard to the divinity of the work in which 
we are engaged. I have been greatly impressed by this statement, and 
not only in regard to the testimony he has borne, but in regard to his life. 

President Grant at eighty-four years of age has accomplished a great 
deal in his life. At twenty-four years of age he was appointed President 
of the Tooele Stake of Zion — in his youth practically he received that 
responsibility and carried it forward successfully. Shortly after that he 
was sustained as a member of the Council of the Twelve, and he has car- 
ried on diligently and faithfully in that position from that time to this. 

KEYS OF AUTHORITY OF THE PRIESTHOOD 

Some twenty-three years ago, I believe it was, he received the keys of 
authority of the Priesthood to preside over the whole Church and to carry 
on this responsibility. He has fulfilled it. He has been loyal and faith- 
ful in every respect, and achieved a great work. Every duty and respon- 
sibility given him has been ably magnified. He has been constant in season 
and out of season and lived up to every requirement. Full of alertness 
and initiative in the responsibilities that have come to him he has fully 
measured up in every respect. I rejoice in the testimony he has borne 
to us. I am sure all the Latter-day Saints who were present or who 
listened over the radio have been greatly impressed thereby, and have 
realized that he is verily a servant of the Lord and stands at the head of 
the Church upon the earth, and is a power and influence to all who are 
loyal and true to him and love the work he has accomplished. 

I believe that the motto that President Grant has used extensively 
has had an influence on his life. It reads : 

That which we persist in doing- becomes easy to do; not that the 
nature of the thing has changed, but that our power to do has increased. 

I believe it expresses very effectively the diligence and the persist- 
ence that President Grant has maintained. He has accomplished the 
work he has been called to do fully and effectively, and there is no one 
who has any reason to feel otherwise than that he has fulfilled in every 
respect in his life his great responsibility. I am sure it is a joy to every 
member of the Church. 

FACTORS AFFECTING HUMAN BEHAVIOR 

I have been impressed with the idea and feeling that there are 



72 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Saturday, April 5 Second Day 

certain factors that affect the behavior of men and women here upon the 
earth. These same factors affect every one of the Latter-day Saints. In 
the first place we are influenced by our appetites or carnal desires, and 
thereby we may be led to do good, or we may be led to do evil ; we have 
the choice ; we are free agents. Every human soul who lives upon the 
earth is a free agent to himself to do the will of the Lord or to do wrong, 
and he will be governed and will be judged for his actions here in mortal- 
ity and will have to give an accounting of his actions in the world to 
come. 

EVERYONE HAS THE RIGHT OF CHOICE 

We are told by the Apostle John that every human soul will be called 
up to give an account of his life here in the flesh. The books or records 
that have been made will be opened and we will be held responsible for 
our actions. I appreciate the fact that it is a very important 'thing for 
every individual to learn the difference between right and wrong, and 
choose the right, to battle for truth, and righteousness. We shall be 
blessed if we stand firmly for the same. On the other hand we will be 
punished for that which we do which may be evil. That is our responsi- 
bility and our privilege ; every one of us is called to this responsibility ; 
every individual, I say. We are eternal beings spiritually. We have 
received through the blessing of the Lord the opportunity to come here 
upon the earth in mortality, to live and to accomplish our mission; and 
after we leave here we will go into the spirit world. The day will come 
when we will be resurrected and become immortal beings and will have 
to account for our deeds. We will receive the blessings that we merit 
according to our deeds here in the flesh and our preparations for immortal- 
ity. 

I realize that this is a very important question, a very important 
matter in our lives, and we can be led and guided through light and 
truth to do that which the Lord desires of us, or we can be led by the in- 
fluence of evil, the influences that we heard about this morning, the in- 
fluences of the Adversary who seeks to mislead mankind. 

The Savior said to His disciples in the Sermon on the Mount: 
"Strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and 
few there be that find it." Many people prefer to take the easier way, 
the way that brings them trouble and destruction. It is the Adversary 
who endeavors to lead men away to destruction ; that is the broad way, the 
easy way, and the way which mankind have the power, the right to accept 
if they so choose, and which the Lord endeavors to influence them against. 
He wants us to live in harmony with righteousness and truth. That is a 
very important factor in our lives, the way we live, the desires, the feel- 
ings and the habits we have, because we have the power to do as we choose, 
and we will have to be responsible for everything we do. We should 
strive to be guided in righteousness, that we might be able to discern be- 
tween that which the Lord desires and that which is influenced by the 
other power, which is contrary to truth and righteousness. 



ELDER SYLVESTER Q. CANNON 



73 



HUMAN EMOTIONS AND REASON 

There is another factor by which we are affected, and that is the 
influence of our emotion. We have the power to control ourselves largely 
in this respect also, and yet we can gain a great deal of satisfaction 
through proper emotions if we cultivate them and live for them, if we 
do the right thing. There are emotions that are of a very elevating nature 
and there are others that are of a character that lead us to destruction and 
to downfall, and therein also we have a responsibility. There is another 
influence, and that is in the nature of reason or judgment which guides us 
in our lives, and we are supposed to use common sense and judgment 
in all the things we do ; we have that power. Of course men are some- 
times influenced by the other influence, the emotions and desires, and 
reason does not govern them altogether, but that is a very important 
thing for them to cultivate. 

We as Latter-day Saints have the opportunity of doing these things 
and we have the privilege and responsibility of cultivating the attitude 
and the qualifications, the factor of reason in our lives, that we may there- 
by be judged righteously in everything that concerns us. The Lord has 
given us an understanding of these things and how to control them, and 
to be influenced thereby, and we have the power also, if we live for it — 
every man has the power, has the understanding, and should be taught 
principles that will lead us to understand righteousness and the purposes 
of the Lord. 

POWER OF THE HOLY SPIRIT 

We have particularly that responsibility and that blessing that the 
Lord has given to every one who has received the Gospel that we are 
enabled to grow in the spirit and power and testimony of the truth and 
learn to know the difference between sound reasoning or judgment, and 
that which is not for our welfare ; and we have the ability also to judge 
and discern between the influence and emotions which will lead us astray. 

And so the Lord desires that we should cultivate the influence and 
power of His Holy Spirit, and if we do this we shall grow in the spirit 
and power of the Gospel, love of truth, and understanding of His pur- 
poses, and if we continually maintain that attitude we shall develop in 
power to serve the Lord as He desires us. 

You will remember that when the Savior was upon the earth He 
repeatedly called the attention of His Apostles to the importance of keep- 
ing His commandments. He said to them time and again, "If ye love 
me keep my commandments." Frequently He called it to their attention, 
showing how important and desirable was the principle He had given 
them, and every other human soul to serve Him, keep His commandments 
and do His will. "Thereby," He said, "Ye show that ye love me if ye 
keep my commandments." 

Such an example as the divine influence of the Savior on mankind 
has been a great power for those who have sought to do His will and 
have drawn near to Him. To us as Latter-day Saints we have the op- 
portunity and privilege of living up to this principle of serving the Lord 



74 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Saturday, April 5 Second Day 

and doing His will and if we strive to do that continually we shall grow 
in influence and power through drawing near to Him and seeking to serve 
the Lord, and to do so in the name of His Beloved Son. Thereby we 
may all grow in the spirit and power of this work. That is a responsi- 
bility that rests upon all of us, who are members of the Church 
everywhere, and upon our children, the young people, that thereby every- 
one of them may grow in the love of the truth, the love of the Lord and 
the desire to do His will and keep His commandments. 

TESTIMONY OF THE TRUTH 

I testify of these things to you and pray the Lord to bless you and 
bless us all in our desires to do right and live His will. I testify and 
declare that this is the work of the Lord. It is intended for the welfare 
of mankind, for their eternal salvation and exaltation. I testify also 
that the Prophet Joseph Smith was indeed a prophet of the Lord. He 
has set the example to us in this dispensation of the blessings which fol- 
low the observance of the commandments of the Lord which he received 
from God. That same spirit and that same influence is manifested by the 
brethren who preside over the work now, and all of those who have 
presided over the Church in former days. I testify to these things and 
pray the Lord to bless us all, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER RULON S. WELLS 

Of the First Council of the Seventy 

There are three reasons recorded in the scriptures why Satan was cast 
out of Heaven, and with him those who rebelled against God and followed 
after Satan. Those three reasons were, as I recall them : first, that they 
were in rebellion against God ; second, that they sought to arrogate unto 
themselves the credit, the honor and the glory which belong to God alone ; 
and, third, that Satan sought to destroy the free agency of man, which 
God has given to every man, as we have heard here from the brethren 
who have preceded me. 

GOOD AND EVIL CANNOT BE DONE UNDER COMPULSION 

It is impossible for any man to commit sin under compulsion, and it 
is impossible for him to do good under compulsion ; that is, I mean, this : 
there is no evil in doing wrong under compulsion, neither is there any 
virtue in doing good under compulsion. We are only responsible for that 
which we do willingly in the exercise of our free agency. God will hold 
us responsible for all that we do of our own volition and He has endowed 
us with certain gifts that will enable us to distinguish between good and 
evil. 

You will find recorded in the seventh chapter of the Book of Moroni 
wherein we are told in the sixteenth paragraph, that "the spirit of Christ 
is given to every man that he might know good from evil," and ever since 
the days of the Garden of Eden and the partaking of the forbidden fruit 
by our first parents the eyes of mankind have been opened to a knowledge 



ELDER RULON S. WELLS 



75 



of good and evil. The Lord has given us that knowledge by bestowing 
upon all that spirit of Christ that is poured out upon all men, and we 
know when we do wrong. No man can ever say that he did an evil thing 
because he had to do it, for if he had to do it there would be no evil in it ; 
but if he does it with the consent of his own mind, then and then only can 
it be called "committing sin." The same thing will apply to doing good. 
They are good deeds only when they are done willingly. We will be 
judged according to the light and knowledge which God has given to us. 

Another great blessing that God has given to us for our guidance is 
that every one who has received the truth and entered into covenant with 
the Lord through the holy waters of baptism has received the gift of the 
Holy Ghost, which is the Spirit of Truth that will lead us into all truth, 
that our minds may be lit up thereby and our understandings enlarged. 

Compulsion does not belong to the theory of government in the 
Kingdom of God. There are many man-made governments where they 
seek to control the actions of others, even in their religion and everything 
else. All this is contrary to the mind and will of God. He desires that 
every man shall be free "to choose his life, and what he'll be, for this 
eternal truth is given, that God will force no man to heaven." 

So you see, my brethren and sisters, the Lord has not left us without 
divine guidance. We have a battle to fight; Satan was cast out of 
Heaven because he rebelled against God and sought to lead away and did 
lead away many of God's children, even one-third of the hosts of Heaven. 

THE SAVIOR'S PLAN FOR MANKIND 

In reply to the question which God propounded, "Whom shall I 
send?" (this pertaining to the sending to this world one to carry out 
the purposes of the Almighty Father) our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, 
known to ancient Israel as Jehovah said : 

Here am I, send me. . . . Father thy will be done, and the glory 
be thine forever. 

What a difference from the attitude of Lucifer, the son of the morn- 
ing, otherwise called Satan, and sometimes called the devil, more fre- 
quently than not ! What a difference in the attitude and the spirit ! Said 
Lucifer : 

Here am I, send me, I will be thy Son and I will redeem all man- 
kind, that one soul shall not be lost; and surely I will do it, wherefore, 
give me thine honor. 

He was ambitious, he wanted to arrogate to himself all the honor 
and the glory, and he wanted to use compulsion, and save us whether we 
wanted to be saved or not. Force will never convert the human mind ; 
this can be done only in the exercise of our free agency and not other- 
wise. 

All through the teachings of our Savior we are taught the wonder- 
ful lesson of doing the will of God. The Lord taught us to pray to our 
Heavenly Father, "Thy Kingdom come, thy will be done in earth as it 
is in Heaven." When that day comes the will of God will be done, but 



76 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Saturday. April 5 Second Day 

not under any compulsion whatever. If we ever arrive in Heaven we 
will find that we have so adapted ourselves to the will of God that our 
minds will be lit up, we will have the Spirit of God which reveals to us 
the things of God, and we will know the will of God and act in accordance 
with it, or we will never get there. 

OBEDIENCE TO THE WILL OF GOD REQUIRED IN ALL THINGS 

And so I say this, that it is the will of God that we are to obey, and 
we have the means of ascertaining and learning it without any undue in- 
fluence or coercion being used with us. "Thy will be done." The order 
and will of God — there is order in the Kingdom of God ; there is order in 
Heaven; in this whole universe there is order; law prevails throughout 
the universe. There is an equilibrium in all this universe which is upheld 
and sustained by the will and power of God, by His laws, and some- 
times we refer to them as the laws of nature. Let one of those laws be 
suspended and there will be confusion and disaster. Either there would 
be violent collisions among the heavenly bodies, or the members of this 
sidereal universe would fly off into an endless space, never again to re- 
turn. There is order everywhere prevailing. I think it was Aristotle or 
one of the great philosophers who made the remark that order was the 
first law of heaven. I heard that contradicted the first time by President 
George Q. Cannon. I do not know whether it was original with him or 
not, but this is what he said : "No, order is not the first law of Heaven ; 
obedience is the first law of Heaven, and order is the result." That is 
what I like, that coincides with my view. Obedience, then, of which we 
have heard so much, is the thing that will set us in order and will set 
the world in order. The universe renders obedience to the will of God, 
obedience to the law of Heaven, obedience to the Divine powers that 
preside over the universe. That is the way to unify ourselves and to find 
access to God. There will be no compulsion in it. 

The order as we find it in the universe prevails in Heaven, and there- 
fore we should seek to know what the order and will of God are in all 
things pertaining to our lives here upon the earth, and we will have the 
Spirit of the Lord to guide us and the revelations of the Lord that have 
been given to men, that we might know good from evil. This Spirit per- 
vades the universe, and it was by this Spirit that the universe was made — 
the Heavens and the earth. 

In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, 
and the Word was God. 

The same was in the beginning with God. 

All things were made by him; and without him was not anything 
made that was made. 

In him was life; and the life was the light of men. (John 1:1-4.) 

That is the true light which lighteth every man which cometh into 
the world, the light of Christ. "Let us walk in the light even as He is 
in the light," and we are told we shall then "have fellowship one with 
another, and the blood of Jesus Christ will cleanse us from all sin."

THE COVENANT MADE BY GOD 

The Gospel provides the plan of life and salvation to every one that 
will render obedience to it. 

The Lord makes covenant with His chosen people. The people of 
God have always been called a covenant people. We first entered into 
covenant with God in that primeval day before the world was made when 
God assembled before Him His sons and daughters and revealed unto 
them the plan of life and salvation — the glorious plan that has been reveal- 
ed from Heaven, known as the New and Everlasting Covenant, which 
means the same thing as the Gospel of Jesus Christ in its fulness. 

Under the terms of this covenant God requires us to keep His com- 
mandments. As it is set forth in the Book of Abraham, and translated 
by Joseph Smith, the Prophet, through the gift and power of God : "We 
will go down and make an earth whereon these may dwell," (thus says 
the Lord referring to His assembled children) "And we will try them 
herewith to see if they will do all things whatsoever the Lord their God 
shall command them. They who keep their first estate shall be added up- 
on * * * * * and they who keep their second estate shall have glory added 
upon their heads forever and ever." 

We are now in our second estate, and if we do "all things" whatso- 
ever the Lord our God shall command us, then we are promised in the 
covenant that we shall have glory added upon our heads forever and 
ever — a never-ending glory that shall continue to come to us through- 
out all the eternities that lie before us ; a never-ending glory and life in 
the presence of God and His sons and His daughters, being heirs of 
God, even joint heirs with Jesus Christ, and with Him inherit all things 
that the Father hath. In other words, we shall be glorified and enter into 
the Celestial kingdom of God, and obtain that highest and greatest gift 
of God unto men — eternal life in His Celestial kingdom — or as Elder 
Joseph Fielding Smith told us, "eternal lives." 

When we speak of the New and Everlasting Covenant our minds 
immediately turn to the marriage covenant. This is truly a very impor- 
tant part of it, but it is only a part. The fulness of the Gospel of Jesus 
Christ is the everlasting covenant (See D. re C. 66:2.) They mean one 
and the same thing. Obedience, then, to the Gospel of Jesus Christ in 
its fulness and primitive purity as restored to the earth in these last days 
through the instrumentality of Joseph Smith, the Prophet, is our part in 
the Everlasting Covenant, and if we render this obedience by doing all 
things which the Lord, our God, has commanded us, then He is bound 
under the terms of the Covenant to do His part which He has promised 
to do, which is adding "glory upon our heads forever and ever." This 
simply means a never-ending glory that shall be added upon our heads 
throughout all the eternities that are to come. This is salvation, as con- 
templated under the New and Everlasting Covenant, for which our Lord 
and Savior Jesus Christ made the supreme sacrifice, redeeming us from 
death and the grave (both natural death of the body and spiritual death 
which was banishment from the presence of God.) It will be obvious 
therefore that when salvation comes it is through Him and Him only. 



78 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Saturday, April 5 Second Day 

We cannot save ourselves for the "greatest gift of God to man is the 
gift of salvation," "for by grace are ye saved through faith, and that 
not of yourselves, it is the gift of God." 

THE SAVIOR'S PART IN THE PLAN OF SALVATION 

Again let me emphasize that we need a Savior. After the transgres- 
sion in the Garden of Eden the Lord said : 

Behold, the man is become as one of us to know good and evil; 
and now lest he put forth his hand and partake also of the tree of life, 
and eat and live forever (in his sins), therefore I, the Lord God will 
send him forth from the Garden of Eden. 

And he was literally driven out of the Garden of Eden. But, God 
did not forsake him ; nevertheless he was banished from the presence of 
God, a condition which still prevails. We no longer see the face of God ; 
we do not talk with Him face to face as did Moses and others, includ- 
ing Joseph Smith the Prophet, but we are banished, and it came upon 
Adam and all of his posterity. That is one phase then of salvation, to 
have that overcome. The other phase is the natural death of the body — 
"In the day thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die," and when that 
day comes and we shall attain to the allotted age of man, which is some- 
times called seventy years — it may go to a hundred or even beyond that, 
I myself have gone nearly seventeen years beyond that alloted age — the 
time will come when we will shuffle off this mortal coil, and our bodies 
will be laid in the silent tomb', there to mingle with mother earth and to 
return to that mother earth from whence we came, but our spirits shall 
go back to God in His paradise if we are faithful, but anyway to the spirit 
world to await that glorious day when the trump shall sound and the 
dead shall arise and be clothed upon, if they have been faithful, with im- 
mortality and eternal life, but with immortality in any event in the due 
time of the Lord. 

So don't you see we are wholly and totally dependent upon the Lord 
to save us from these conditions ; they are wholly beyond the power of 
any man. Which one of us can bring his own body out of the grave? 
How can we be brought back to God ? How can these things be ? The 
Savior answers that in very terse terms. Said He : "I am the Way, the 
Truth and the Life; no man cometh unto the Father but by me." 
Neither is there any name given under Heaven save the name of Jesus 
Christ whereby man must be saved. 

May the Lord help us, therefore, to seek the counsels that come 
from God and be guided by the Holy Spirit to enter into covenant with 
the Lord and keep ourselves sweet and clean and unspotted from the sins 
of the world. Just as surely as the day follows the night we shall be 
brought back to God to inherit all these wonderful blessings which He 
has promised unto them that love Him and keep His commandments. 
May God grant it, I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

ELDER LEVI EDGAR YOUNG 

Of the First Council of the Seventy 
and President of the New England Mission 

My brethren and sisters, I have traveled a long way to attend this 
Conference. Boston is about the farthest point East on the Atlantic sea- 
board, and is a beautiful and historic city, but there is no joy like the joy 
of coming home. 

ASSOCIATE MISSION PRESIDENTS PRAISED 

I have the honor of being associated with some fifteen other Mission 
Presidents, who are fine and capable men. They are fearless and have 
taken hold of this work with all the power of fine manhood, of truth, and 
everything that is noble. They sit here before us in this congregation, 
unassuming, God-fearing men, and I want them to know that I am happy 
to be counted with them. It is an honor, for they have done me so much 
good, and my Mission as well, for naturally we call the Missions "Our 
Missions." 

EARLY MISSIONARY WORK IN NEW ENGLAND 

The New England Mission is in a sense the oldest Mission of the 
Church. President Brigham Young and Heber C. Kimball were mission- 
aries a hundred years ago and from that time to the present some of the 
greatest men of the Church have carried the Gospel to that part of the 
United States. Vermont, as you know, is the "cradle" of Mormonism, for 
in that State was born the Prophet Joseph Smith and President Brigham 
Young, and many others who have been the stalwart bearers of truth in 
this Church. 

We have a band of very fine and noble men and women, your boys 
and girls. It is very hard on them the first winter in New England, as the 
climate is very severe, but they face their difficulties bravely. Everything 
is so new, and we have only a few Saints comparatively. We have about 
1,180 in the New England States and in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia 
in Canada. This entire section of America is very beautiful. 

MISSIONARIES MAKING HEADWAY 

In New England the people as never before are respecting this lat- 
ter-day work. Our missionaries are allowed to speak and lecture upon 
Mormonism in many of the large churches. One of our brethren recently 
gave one of the most intelligent talks on the history of the restored 
Gospel that I have ever heard, and he did it fearlessly and with courage, 
and with beautiful English. He had studied his work and he bore testi- 
mony of the restoration of the Gospel of our Lord and Savior Jesus 
Christ. 

We are working together, and the nobility of our work is equal to the 
demands of the people there. You must remember New England has 
many colleges and universities. There are twenty-seven universities and 
colleges in and around Boston alone ; and therefore we come in contact 



80 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Saturday, April 5 Second Day 

with the students and faculties. Down in New Haven we have a group of 
fine boys in Yale University. In Cambridge, we have eighty Utah stu- 
dents in Harvard College, and they are all doing fine work. Up at 
Dartmouth and down at Brown University in Providence, and over in 
Smith College, not to mention other colleges, we have Utah students. We 
try to keep track of them and this work alone is very important. 

We teach the missionaries to study certain historical facts of New 
England. For example, December 20th of last year they spoke on the 
mission of the Pilgrim fathers, and read to hundreds of people the thir- 
teenth chapter of I Nephi, which foretells the settlement of the shores of 
New England. We have held Priesthood meetings at Plymouth Rock and 
at the little town of Whitingham, Vermont, the birthplace of President 
Brigham Young. Many meetings have been held at South Royalton, 
where the Joseph Smith Memorial farm is located. President Heber C. 
Kimball was born at Sheldon, Vermont, and President Wilford Wood- 
ruff's birthplace was at Avon, Connecticut. Apostle Willard Richards 
was of New England lineage, as were Apostles Orson Hyde, Ezra T. 
Benson, Erastus Snow, and Franklin D. Richards. Many other histori- 
cal characters of the Church were born in New England. The Elders 
have joy in visiting the old homes of our leaders, and some day the people 
will take pride that so many of the founders of the Latter-day work came 
out of New England and were of Puritan descent. 

ITEMS OF EARLY HISTORY IN NEW ENGLAND 

New England has the oldest churches in the United States, and hun- 
dreds of church buildings. We respect these church buildings, for when- 
ever anyone with a clean purpose builds a church in honor of God, good is 
being done. The Elders of our Mission have cooperated with me in 
making a study of the history of the religions of New England with a 
view of being able to converse better on the subject of the Gospel. A 
number of books have moulded the thought of the people since the rise 
and growth of Puritanism, and as a result of our study, the Elders are 
able to draw comparisons in an intelligent manner. To illustrate just 
what I mean: In the year 1S36, John Calvin published a noted work on 
religion that moulded the thought of Protestantism possibly more than 
any other work. It was his famous Institutes of the Christian Religion. 
It was a clear exposition of Protestant doctrine and a forceful refutation 
of the opposing Catholic views. It also laid down the laws of Church 
government, later known by the name of Presbyterianism. An eminent 
modern Catholic scholar has called Calvin's book "the finest work of 
Reformation literature." In it Calvin gave his program for reform 
in religion, and when the book was translated into English, it moulded the 
thought of the Puritans of England. Copies of it were brought to Amer- 
ica, and in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries it was used in many 
of the colleges where religion was taught. We missionaries have made 
careful study of the religious principles laid down by Calvin. 

Another work issued from the press about the same time as the 
Institutes was the work of Ignatius Loyola entitled Spiritual Exercises, 



BISHOP LE GRAND RICHARDS 



81 



which was a manual of religious drill designed to lead the sinner to con- 
centrate all his faculties upon the task of realizing his sinfulness and 
God's abounding grace. 

One hundred years ago, there was a great uncertainty about the 
Christian faith, and of later years that uncertainty has grown so that 
to-day thousands, yes, I might say millions of the youth of America have 
little or no church allegiance, and are without foundation of religious 
home life or knowledge of the Bible. Even among those who call them- 
selves Christian, there is an uncertainty as to what to believe. The deep 
discontent with the achievements of Christianity itself in dealing with 
social, economic, and international relations is weakening the sense of 
assurance of Christianity's value to the world. 

JOSEPH SMITH'S OWN STORY AND ARTICLES OF FAITH OF GREAT WORTH 

There are two documents that our missionaries are coming to know, 
documents that the world will have to reckon with. They are Joseph 
Smith's Own Story and the Articles of Faith. Had the Prophet Joseph 
Smith never issued anything else but his own story and the Articles of 
Faith, his work would in time have revolutionized religious thought. They 
refute the tragic mistake of the Calvin and Loyola documents, for they 
announce to the world the large fundamentals on which the restored 
Gospel is based. In the Prophet's writings you never find any pretense 
or bombast, but everything he writes is simple and direct. The reader is 
always impressed with his truthfulness and honesty. We are using these 
two documents with fine success in our mission. 

We are feeling the effects of the war in New England. Factories 
have been re-opened and thousands of men and women have found work. 
People differ on the policies of the administration at Washington. One 
thing I hope and that is that our country may keep out of this war and 
free from the terrible hatreds of the world. May we place our hands in 
His hand and go into the future with larger hopes and greater faith in 
His holy laws, I ask in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.

BISHOP LeGRAND RICHARDS 

Presiding Bishop of the Church 

Considerable has been said at this Conference concerning the value 
of a testimony of the Gospel. Some years ago I had a discussion with 
an associate of mine in the Church, an educator, who said he believed 
the day had come when we would have to appeal to the young people of 
the Church through reason rather than through that which we custom- 
arily call a testimony of the Gospel. I answered that if we had reached 
that stage, then I feared for the future of the Church, as all that we had 
accomplished as a people had been because of the testimonies that the 
Lord had given unto us. 



82 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Saturday, April 5 Second Day 



A TESTIMONY BRINGS WITH IT WILLINGNESS TO SACRIFICE 

I am sure we shall never forget the testimony we listened to yes- 
terday from President Grant. I recall having been in this building 
as a boy and having heard President Woodruff's testimony of how the 
Lord had guided and inspired him all his life. I am not sure but what 
it was the last address he delivered here, and that testimony has always 
remained with me. When I think of President Grant's life and all he 
has accomplished, of his beautiful soul, his inspiration, and the sacrifices 
he has made in order to answer the calls that have been made of him 
in this great Church, I realize what his testimony has done for him. 

Many of us remember having heard President Ivins from this 
stand tell how many times he had sold all he had and burned his bridges 
behind him to answer the call of the brethren to serve in some other 
part of the Church. Those of us who have labored in the mission field 
know how many of the Saints have forsaken all they had in this world 
in order that they might be obedient to the testimonies the Lord had 
planted in their hearts. 

President Clark said in his address that in events that are yet 
to come we would find our testimonies of the Gospel our greatest solace. 
I feel as we are sending our boys at the present time into the service of 
their country if we can send them with a testimony of the Gospel in 
their hearts, that it will give them power to live their lives sweet and 
clean before God and all men, as they have been taught in their Latter- 
day Saint homes. 

The Savior of the world indicated that if we would be His disciples 
we must be willing to forsake all that we have in this world, even to 
fathers and mothers, lands and herds, and I want to say to you that I 
do not believe men and women will forsake all they have because of 
any reasoning power they possess. They will do it when their souls are 
touched by the inspiration and power of the Spirit of the living God, 
which is the testimony of the truth, and then it is that men can love 
God more than they love anything else in this world, and hence forsake 
all because of their love of Him. 

I wish we could send our boys into the service of their country with 
the faith and testimony the two thousand Lamanite boys had in the time 
of Helaman of old when they went forth to battle and came back every 
man because of his faith. 

THE PROMISES OF THE LORD SURE OF FULFILMENT 

We have great promises resting upon us as a people and as indi- 
viduals through obeying and keeping the commandments of God. Ref- 
erence has been made to the promise of the Lord through observance 
of the Word of Wisdom, not only that we should run and not be 
weary, walk and not faint, and that we should receive hidden treasures 
of knowledge, but the destroying angel should pass by us and not slay 
us even as the children of Israel. 

It has been said that man's extremities are God's opportunities. 
We have all known that in our day should come the judgments of God, 



BISHOP LE GRAND RICHARDS 



83 



the great and dreadful day of the Lord, when all the proud, yea, all who 
do wickedly, should be as stubble, and that day should burn them up that 
it should leave them neither root nor branch. We have reason, if we have 
faith in God and keep His commandments, to believe that the destroying 
angel might pass us by as a people, and individually, and not slay us, and 
that we might stand as a light and an ensign to the world, and an evi- 
dence that God does not forget His promises. I hope every one of us 
believes in these promises the Lord has made to us. 

A PATRIARCHAL BLESSING AND ITS FULFILMENT 

Two weeks ago while I was visiting in Arizona a counselor to a 
Stake President told me of an experience he had which typifies many 
similar experiences of the members of this Church. He said that during 
the World War he was drafted. He was a young man and did not want 
to go to war ; he felt if he ever went into action he would never return 
alive. So he went to the Patriarch, (and I met that Patriarch on the 
same trip) and the Patriarch came in from his field and said to this 
good brotber: "You sit down at the table and write as I dictate." He 
laid his hands upon the head of this young man and pronounced a 
blessing upon him, and I took the time to write it down as he gave it to 
me. I would like to read a few words from that blessing here today : 

Inasmuch as ye have been called to go to the defense of your 
country, I promise you if you will be humble and faithful and prayerful, 
that if your life is ever brought into danger, the way will be opened for 
your escape, and you will yet be given in marriage and have sons and 
daughters of good repute and be the means of doing much missionary 
work in the world. 

You see all this was conditioned upon his being faithful and prayer- 
ful and humble. It is a grand and glorious thing to bind the God of 
Israel to us through obeying and keeping His commandments. You will 
remember that He said to the Prophet Joseph : 

I, the Lord am bound when ye do what I say, but when ye do not 
what I say, ye have no promise. 

This man had a promise from the Lord that was worth living for. 

I want to say to you, brethren and sisters, I would rather have the 
promise of God resting upon me than that of any mortal man, just 
as this brother who went forth to battle for his country. Within ninety 
days after he received his patriarchal blessing he was going over the 
top in France, and in his company were 250 men to which were added 
thirty replacements. On the day that the Armistice was signed, at 
10 o'clock in the morning, there were eighty men left out of the 280, 
and they were told they should cease firing. The men gathered around, 
three of them in one hole, including this brother, of whom I speak. Two 
hundred yards away he saw the army kitchen, and he invited his 
companions to go with him to get something to eat. They had had no 
supper or breakfast and were sure they would get nothing if they went, 
so he went alone. Just as he was being handed a stack of hot cakes, a 



84 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Saturday. April 5 Second Day 

bomb fell in the midst of the little company of eighty he had left behind 
and thirty of them were killed and fifty were left. When he returned, 
there were the two men that were in the hole with him, with the tops 
of their heads blown off. The Patriarch had said : 

If your life is ever brought into danger, the way will be opened 
for your escape and you will yet be given in marriage and have sons 
and daughters of good repute. 

He now has six children, one in the mission field. 

THE SAINTS STANDING IN HOLY PLACES 

Now the Lord made also this statement regarding the judgments 
that are to come in these latter days : 

But my disciples shall stand in holy places, and shall not be 
moved; but among the wicked, men shall lift up their voices and 
curse God and die. 

I do not know what you think about this promise. So far as I am 
concerned I think the Lord did not mean that we should stand on this 
Temple Block or back in Independence ; I think He meant that His chil- 
dren should live such lives that wherever they stand the ground upon 
which they stand should be holy and sanctified because of their presence. 

THE ELEMENTS REBUKED BY FAITH 

You will recall that in the early days of the gathering of the Saints 
it was considered as good as an insurance policy when a company of 
Latter-day Saints embarked on a vessel crossing the Atlantic. I recall 
reading in my grandfather's diary of a time when the boat upon which 
he was sailing was in great jeopardy, so much so that the captain of 
the boat came to him and pleaded with him to intercede with the Lord 
in behalf of the boat and her passengers ; and Grandfather, remembering 
that he had been promised that he should have power over the elements, 
walked out on the deck of the boat and raised his hands to high heaven 
and rebuked the sea and the waves, and they were immediately calmed, 
and the appreciation of the captain of the boat was so great that he 
offered him the use of his private quarters during the balance of the 
journey. 

Now, brethren and sisters, I believe that in the experiences that 
are ahead of us through the judgments that are to befall the nations, 
God will stand by our side, and by the side of our boys even though 
they go forth to battle^ if they take with them a testimony of the truth 
and the kind of faith they ought to have in the living God and in this 
great latter day work. 

I pray God to bless you all, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 



ELDER ALBERT E. BOW EN 



85 



ELDER ALBERT E. BOWEN 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

The teachings of Jesus, with the testimonies of the prophets con- 
cerning Him and concerning His death and resurrection, constitute the 
Gospel message. That is a universal message, not limited to any time nor 
to any people, but applicable to all peoples of all times. It purports to lay 
down correct principles of living life in mortality, upon which in turn 
depends man's condition of living in immortality. In short, it becomes the 
law of life valid for time and for eternity. In that view it must be 
regarded as the embodiment of absolute human and spiritual values, not 
subject to alteration with the aberrations of changing times, nor to 
variation with the vagrant shiftings of prevailing opinion. 

Those courses of behavior which harmonize with and conform to 
absolute spiritual values must be eternally right just as their opposites 
must be eternally wrong. Between the two there is undying conflict. 
They cannot accommodate themselves one to the other. If it were at- 
tempted to make adjustments between them by having each yield some- 
thing to the other you might succeed in tempering the wrong but what 
you had left would not be the right. It could at best be right debased by 
an admixture of wrong, a counterfeit. 

FUNDAMENTALS MUST REMAIN UNALTERED 

The Church as the teacher and interpreter of the Gospel message 
cannot countenance any dilution. There may be new techniques of ex- 
position, improved approaches, expanding understanding of interpreta- 
tion and application and even a weeding out of extraneous accretions 
which have fastened themselves upon the basic principles, but in the 
fundamentals of the message itself there can be no alterations. Wherever 
the majority opinion may for the moment lie, or however the conflict may 
swirl and lash about it the eternal right must still stand unshaken and 
unmoved as the fixed base to which men may with assurance and safety 
anchor their lives. That which is right does not become wrong merely 
because it may be deserted by the majority, neither does that which is 
wrong today become right tomorrow by the chance circumstance that it 
has won the approval or been adopted by overwhelmingly predominant 
numbers. Principles cannot be changed by nor accommodate themselves 
to the vagaries of popular sentiment. 

TODAY'S TEST OF GOSPEL MESSAGE 

If, as I have already said, the Gospel message has, as in the very 
nature of the case it must have, a universality of application, without 
limit as to time or locality or people, then it must have in it a specific 
cure for the ills of every age. In all circumstances, in every time we 
should, if it fills the requirement of its claim, be able to turn to it and find 
a direction suited to the needs of the hour. For it is not divorced from 
life but on the contrary is concerned solely with the lives of men and so 



86 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Saturday, April 5 Second Day 

must instruct and fortify them for life's requirements. Let us consider 
whether it meets that test as related to the conditions of today. 

The mischief against which there is presently the most insistent 
complaint is the reign of violence with its train of accompanying evils. 
This grows out of the arrogance and egotism of rulers and leaders who 
seek to establish their supremacy at whatever cost, and without regard to 
consequences to humanity at large or to nations or individuals in particu- 
lar. The Gospel message on the contrary admonishes men to humility. 

Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, the 
same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven. 

But when thou art bidden, go and sit down in the lowest room; 
that when he that bade thee cometh, he may say unto thee, Friend, 
go up higher: then shalt thou have worship in the presence of them 
that sit at meat with thee. 

For whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that 
humbleth himself shall be exalted. 

But he that is greatest among you, shall be your servant. 



HUMILITY WOULD WIPE OUT VIOLENCE 

Let these sayings characterize the desires of men and oppression 
would vanish away. There is no nation today whose leaders would not be 
immeasurably benefitted by a lesson in humility. 

One of the results of a reign of violence is the denial of justice, but 
justice is a cardinal part of the Gospel law. 

What doth the Lord require of thee, but to do justly, and to love 
mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God. 

Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to 
you, do ye even so to them: for this is the law and the prophets. 

In any land where that law prevailed there could never be the plun- 
dering, the robbing, the despoiling and the murdering that invariably 
accompany the rule of force. I have spent a large part of my mature life 
in dealing with and trying to adjust people's disputes. I have learned that 
there would be very little trouble between men in this world if only every 
one wanted to do about what is right — to be fair and just. The trouble 
grows out of the unjust advantage taken of situations which throw 
unfair opportunities into the hands of those who are willing to exploit 
them. The discouraging part about it lies in the difficulty of getting 
reciprocal willingness among disputants to yield to the principle of fair- 
ness. As one may be disposed to yield the other increases already unjust 
demands. But that has nothing to do with the existence of the principle 
about which we are just now inquiring. It only signifies rejection of the 
message. 

WAR NEVER ENDS WAR 

Another evil consequence of the rule of force is that it begets re- 
prisals, which lead to interminable conflicts. We are all familiar with the 
feuds of families and clans and the wars of tongs carrying down through 
long generations. The victim of a wrong suffered or a grievance borne 
waits the day of revenge and then takes it with interest compounded. The 



ELDER ALBERT E. BOWEN 



87 



new sufferer in turn retaliates when a change of fortune favors him 
and so the mischief endlessly spirals. 

"Vengeance is mine, saith the Lord." Its exercise cannot safely be 
left to mortals. In nothing is the futility of war more surely revealed 
than in the inevitable consequence of reprisals. The victor despoils the 
vanquished. The latter with an undimmed memory waits the day of 
retribution and when the time of reckoning comes takes back what was 
before lost with something more besides, thus sowing the seed of a future 
war. Seemingly the memory of nations is long; they never forget and 
war never ends war. 

THE SPIRIT OF REPRISAL 

We see the same vicious evil at work in all the contested relations 
of men. We may take an illustration from current happenings. Laboring 
men, by which we mean those who toil with their hands in the service of 
others, have complained that they have been unfairly treated. I have not 
any doubt that their complaint is a just one. They have striven for cor- 
rection. Through unionization and a combination of circumstances they 
have possessed themselves of vast powers. Their direction unfortunately 
has fallen far to.o largely into the hands of unscrupulous exploiters and 
the spirit of reprisal is set in operation. They now in many ways seek 
to punish those against whom they have nursed their grievances. These 
offer resistance and useless quarrels grow. 

The simple law is that a wrong is never righted by the commission 
of another wrong. The expressive common phrase is "Two wrongs never 
make a right." Those who have so bitterly inveighed against injustice 
now deny their fellow workmen who do not wish to join with them the 
right peaceably by their honest toil to earn their daily bread. Rival unions 
quarrel among themselves and in promotion of their feuds stop work to 
the irreparable loss of non-contending parties and the public at large. By 
violence property is destroyed, men maimed and murdered and anarchy 
supplants the rule of law and order. 

DEFENSE PREPARATIONS DELAYED THROUGH GREED 

We read daily reminders that a national peril hangs over us, which 
can be averted only by straining every productive power we have while at 
the same time plants are shut down and men forced to idleness as the 
alleged danger creeps steadily upon us. Boys by the thousands have been 
taken from their employment to prepare themselves for the fighting 
service where they receive twenty-one dollars a month. No one knows 
how soon they may be in armed battle, but the implements of war they 
shall need are not being provided because those who remain undisturbed 
in their employment, and who are already drawing from two to three 
times as much in a week as the soldier gets in a month, strike for higher 
pay and as a means of enforcing their demands not only refuse to work 
themselves but by violence prevent others who are willing to work from 
doing so. If the soldier boys go into war unequipped somebody will be 
answerable.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Second Day 



THE WAY TO INDUSTRIAL PEACE 

And how useless it all is. Instead of reprisals or vengeance the 
Gospel message teaches forgiveness and peace. 

Let not the sun go down upon thy wrath. 

But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse 
you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despite- 
fully use you, and persecute you. 

For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will 
also forgive you. 

But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father 
forgive your trespasses. 

In these principles of the Gospel message lies the way to industrial 
peace. I appeal to the laboring men to forego the methods of force and 
vengeance for they will never bring you peace of mind, contentment of 
spirit nor the rewards you seek. I think I am in a position from ex- 
perience and observation to understand your aspirations. I have a deep 
sympathy with your desire to improve your conditions. It is a laudable 
ambition for every one. But vituperation and violence and hatred and 
reprisal will bring you in the end only disillusionment, disappointed hopes 
and the bitterness of remorse. The peaceful way of counsel and persua- 
sion and a willingness to show justice and observe the right are the ways 
that will win. I make the same appeal to the industrialist, to the man of 
agriculture and to the whole race. 

PEACE IS DRIVEN FROM OUR BORDERS 

This goodly land of ours, the boasted refuge of the oppressed and 
the guarantor of freedom, is seething with unrest. Strife, class rancors, 
uncertainty, hatreds, greed, deception, demagoguery have driven peace 
from our borders. The simple truth is that the interests of all classes are 
inseparably bound up together. There is no legitimate basis for antagon- 
isms between industrialists and laborers or between agriculturists and 
either of the others. They are kept apart by distrust, suspicion and a 
reciprocal lack of faith and confidence. Each is essential to the other. 
Neither can prosper alone, but they are set in conflict by stupid name 
calling, epithet hurling, and intemperate denunciations. These proce- 
dures have always failed. The healing for wounds is not more wounds 
but a soothing balm. 

The final resort of a nation which seeks to impose its unbridled will 
upon others is war. War is always evil. It has always been so and never 
can be anything else. 

WARS SETTLE NOTHING 

If you read your Hebrew scriptures you will see that the destructions 
which befell the people were heralded by wars and slaughters. War was 
the scourge by which the land was devastated as told in the Book of 
Mormon story. And when Jesus was describing to His disciples the 
sorrows and tribulations which were to be so terrible that except they 
should be cut short there should no flesh be saved, prominent among the 



ELDER DAVID A. BROADBENT 



89 



initiating terrors were wars — nation rising against nation and kingdom 
against kingdom. 

A war of defense may be justifiable. It may be the only means of 
saving from utter extinction those institutions and sanctions through 
which the ways of peace by conversion to a better way may be imple- 
mented. But so far as any lasting enduring results are concerned wars 
themselves settle nothing. It is their history that the settlements imposed 
at the close of one contain the seeds of another to follow. 

But I need not pursue the point. The thesis I laid down at the 
beginning, namely, that the Gospel message is universal and has in it, 
all the necessary curative agents for the ills of the day, is clearly demon- 
strable. Your own reflection will carry you far beyond any place to which 
in the limits of my time I have been able to take you. 

GOSPEL MESSAGE MUST BE TAUGHT 

Let me in closing refer again to the second phase of my theme, 
namely, that in the eternal conflict between right and wrong there can be 
no compromise. The Gospel message cannot change its principles to 
accommodate itself to the caprice of the hour. Among the great un- 
changeables are the truth that God lives ; that Jesus Christ is His Son, 
the Messiah, the Savior of the world ; that He died, was buried and was 
raised from the dead ; that man is a child of God, destined to immortality ; 
that he is therefore a sacred being and that it is unalterably wrong to 
enslave him or to coerce the human spirit ; that there is a moral law by 
which man must, through disciplined self-control, govern himself which 
finds its faithful expression in the Ten Commandments as given by Moses 
and reiterated and reinforced by the Master, and which cannot be rejected 
without destroying the foundations of civilized life. These convictions 
are the essential conditions to the incorporation of the principles of the 
Gospel message into the lives of men by which alone may be satisfied 
the hunger of the world for tranquility and peace. These truths the 
Church can never cease to teach. 

It is for you leaders to see that they are taught. That God may give 
you power to do so, I pray, in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER DAVID A. BROADBENT 

Former President of the North Central States Mission 

My brethren and sisters, I was notified before noon that I would be 
given five minutes in which to bear my testimony, and I have been worry- 
ing about it ever since. 

I had the privilege, with my family, under the good graces of our 
leadership and the blessings of the Lord to preside in the North Central 
States Mission for a little more than three years. We are very grateful 
for that opportunity. I think I shall leave the report of that mission to 
my worthy successor, who I believe is the best man in the Church to 
succeed me in that position, Elder George F. Richards, Jr., who for the 
past six months has been presiding in that field of labor. We were 



90 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Saturday, April 5 Second Day 

released from that glorious opportunity to come and take his position 
in the Temple, he having been Second Counselor to President Chipman 
there while we presided in the mission. 

While in the North Central States, I considered that to be the best 
position in the Church. Now I will say without hesitancy that I believe 
that any position in which we may have the privilege of serving in this 
Church is the best place that we can be appointed to labor, it matters not 
where, only let us remain active in the Church. 

We are just now in the midst of what our people are considering 
rather a tightening up on the question of recommendations to get into 
the Temple. I have no disposition to speak at length to that particular 
point, but to illustrate with an incident that occurred only a few weeks ago 
when a member from a very worthy family came and said : "Are you 
going to keep me out of the Temple for the sake of a cup of coffee?" 

The attendant who met that sister replied, "Are you going to let a 
cup of coffee keep you out of the Temple ?" I think that is the position 
we must take in our testimony, as I find myself fully in accord with all. 
that has been said at this Conference thus far. 

I find myself committed to the thought that my testimony is my life. 
I believe the day will never come when this Church can move forward 
without the divinity of the testimony of Jesus Christ, but I am sure that 
there is a practical side to that testimony. There is no virtue in a mere 
assent to a confession of belief in the Gospel of Jesus Christ. We really 
have to do something about it. There are two purposes as I see it in the 
Gospel plan and in service of the Church. First, the great mission of 
seeing that this Gospel reaches mankind throughout the world. We must 
teach mankind in every nation, kindred, tongue and people ; and the 
second mission of this message is that we shall perfect ourselves as 
individuals through activity in the Church, in applying its every teaching. 

There is no testimony in the heart of any man, as I understand a 
real testimony, who declares that he believes in the Word of Wisdom if 
he continues to desecrate it ; to break that law in any way. I am very 
positive in my mind that no man can have a full testimony of the law of 
tithing who does not honestly pay a full tithing. I am very well committed 
to the thought that in the homes of the Latter-day Saints there are none 
who have a full and complete testimony of the Gospel, who neglect their 
daily prayers with the family. I cannot conceive as a fact that a Latter- 
day Saint with a testimony, will let his children grow up in idleness 
without having them understand that there is a great educational institu- 
tion all around us,- — I mean the entire educational system provided by 
the State from the grades through the university, — that they could be 
receiving the benefits of, instead of leaving them to grow up in ignorance. 
I am convinced that there is no real testimony in the homes of the Latter- 
day Saints where the parents do not lead their children into the organiza- 
tions of the Church, to train and teach them the benefits and blessings 
of this great program. The plan of salvation, the Gospel of Jesus Christ 
is the greatest university that has ever been instituted in all the world. 

I am very sure that if we had a full and complete testimony of the 
Gospel of Christ in 100% of the homes of the 806,000 Latter-day Saints, 



ELDER MERRILL D. CLAY SON 



91 



and if we were living according to our teaching, that we would need no 
other missionary work in the world. The whole world would be at our 
feet and ask "How did you do it?" for it would produce such a superior 
race of men and women as has never been known in the earth up to the 
present time. 

If we had a full and complete testimony of the Gospel of Christ in 
our homes our young men and maidens would not be seeking either the 
Bishop or the President of the Stake, a constable or Judge, or any other 
officer of the land to consummate their marriage at the proper age in 
life ; but they would come into the House of the Lord to be sealed for time 
and for all eternity, knowing that this is the only real type of marriage 
instituted by God and designed to be eternal. 

I am just as sure if we might detail all the other activities of the 
Church that my testimony, your testimony, is measured by my actions, by 
your actions, and in no other way. I may give assent, but that is not a 
testimony. The testimony as I see it is illustrated largely as a result of 
what is said of the two great Greek orators, Demosthenes and Cicero. 

When Cicero spoke everyone said: "He speaks well." But when 
Demosthenes spoke the audience declared, "Let us go against Philip." 
Philip to us is the sins of this hour ; Philip to us is the desecration of the 
Sabbath Day and the breaking of any and all the other moral and relig- 
ious laws of God. I may have this testimony in knowledge, but it is as 
sounding brass and a tinkling cymbal unless my life responds to it in 
all the affairs that I am responsible for. 

God give me the power to move in the circles where I am appointed, 
to the end that I may show by my works that I do know the Gospel of 
Jesus Christ is true, I pray earnestly in His name, even so. Amen. 

ELDER MERRILL D. CLAYSON 

Former President of the Southern States Mission 

It has been a great opportunity to have had the privilege of filling 
a mission in the Southern States, as well as a previous one in England. 

The introduction of the Gospel of Jesus Christ into the Southern 
States, like the beginning of most new movements, was accompanied 
by gross misunderstanding, hatred and bitter persecution. The history 
of this mission is filled with incidents of persecution that our mission- 
aries went through in order to introduce the Gospel into that land. 
From 1875 to 1900 there is recorded over 135 mobbings experienced by 
the missionaries. More than ten churches were either torn down or 
burned by the mobs. Four Elders lost their lives while carrying the 
Gospel to their fellowmen and it took years to break down this great 
wall of persecution. 

History is replete with evidences which show that through all of 
this the Lord was back of this great work in prompting, inspiring and 
building the lives of men and women who stood for truth. Today the 
scene presents a completely different picture. Persecution has vanished 
and the missionaries are given the opportunity of preaching the Gospel 



92 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Saturday, April 5 Second Day 

in all cities of the Southern States Mission extending from the Mississippi 
River to the Atlantic Ocean, and from the South Tennessee line to Key 
West, Florida. 

As an example of this great change in the attitude of the people 
of the South toward our Church may I relate just one experience. 
Sometime ago the chairman of a council of religions made the request 
that the President of the Southern States Mission appear before the 
ministers and executives of more than twenty-five churches and tell 
them the philosophy and story of Mormonism. Naturally this request 
was granted, and when the day arrived the large Mormon Church in 
Jacksonville, Florida, was filled to overflowing. A few Latter-day 
Saints were on the side, but most of the people in that great hall were 
ministers and religious executives of Catholic, Protestant, and Jewish 
churches. 

It was a great opportunity. I never felt more keenly in my life 
the responsibility of representing my Church and my God than I did 
on that occasion. It was peculiarly interesting to be introduced to such 
a congregation as that by the wife of a Jewish Rabbi. After the meeting 
was over, Catholics, Protestants, and Jews came up to the speaker with 
as much enthusiasm and appreciation for the truths of Mormonism that 
had been presented, as if they had been members of the Church. 

There never has been a time in the Southern States Mission when 
conditions have been more ideal for the spread of the Gospel than today. 
The number of souls accepting the Gospel in that land is rising to greater 
heights continually. The future of this Mission presents a most prom- 
ising outlook. The people of the South are naturally religious. They 
are great believers in the Bible, and the assertion that they are sincere 
and hospitable cannot be overestimated. 

I believe that the time is coming and not far off when this Mission 
is to be one of the strongest and most powerful units of the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. God has endowed this great southern 
country richly in natural beauty, with shrubs, with the oak and the sweet 
magnolia, wth the dogwood, and many, many other types of her creation. 
I am grateful for the opportunities I have had of filling this mission. I 
appreciate the opportunity that the First Presidency of the Church has 
given me and believe from the bottom of my heart that these men are 
called by God and are working in His behalf in this great kingdom. 

Whenever I have had an element of doubt in my life regarding 
their instructions I have lived to see the time when I was wrong and 
they were right. This has convinced me more than ever that their vision 
of this great Church of ours is unusual, that they are called of God, 
that they are inspired by God, and that men and women who follow their 
advice will be happier, more progressive, and reach greater heights 
than those who stoop to complain and find fault with God's servants. 

And so I bear you this testimony today. We may not always think 
as they think, but they are God's servants. If a time should come that 
any of them are not in line with their duty we shall not need to worry 
about removing them. The Lord will remove them from their positions 
as He did Saul and others in days of old. 



PRESIDENT J. REUBEN CLARK, JR. 



93 



God bless us to stand back of them solidly as a unit for the prog- 
ress of this great Church, and for our personal happiness in life, I 
humbly pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

An anthem, "O Divine Redeemer," was sung by the Choir. 

PRESIDENT J. REUBEN CLARK, JR. 

First Counselor in the First Presidency 

I should like again to express our gratitude and appreciation to this 
wonderful chorus that has come to us from Idaho. We are grateful 
to them for all the work they have done in preparing to do this singing 
for us. They are a splendid group of young people, and we certainly pray 
that the Lord will bless them in their labors. 

Please drive carefully, brethren and sisters. I do not know how 
widespread this storm may be, but be careful, and if any of these young 
people in the choir are returning home tonight I hope they and their 
drivers will be particularly careful. You who are walking on the streets, 
please be good enough to walk carefully and observe the signals. 

Elder Clifford E. Young, President of the Alpine Stake, offered 
the closing prayer. 

Conference adjourned until ten o'clock Sunday morning, April 6. 

THIRD DAY 
MORNING MEETING 

Sunday morning, April 6. 

The great Tabernacle was crowded with people many of whom had 
assembled far in advance of the time to begin this session of the Con- 
ference. The large Assembly Hall immediately south of the Tabernacle 
was also filled with people, and other thousands assembled on the Taber- 
nacle grounds. Those who were in the Assembly Hall and on the grounds 
listened to the services as they were broadcast from the Tabernacle, by 
means of amplifying equipment that had been installed. 

The meeting commenced promptly at 10 o'clock. 

PRESIDENT J. REUBEN CLARK, JR. 

First Counselor in the First Presidency 

The hour has come for the opening of this the fifth session of this 
Conference. President Heber J. Grant is present and presiding. He has 
asked President Clark to conduct the meeting. 

There are present on the stand this morning President Grant and 
his two Counselors, the eleven Apostles, all of the First Seven Presi- 
dents of Seventies, and all of the Presiding Bishopric. 

The music for both of the sessions today will be by the Tabernacle

GENERAL AUTHORITIES OF THE CHURCH SUSTAINED 

President J. Reuben Clark, Jr., First Counselor in the First Presi-

and General Officers of the Church, also the General Auxiliary Officers, 
and they were sustained by the unanimous vote of the congregation, as 
follows :

President Clark then made the following statement for the First 
Presidency : 

In the past history of the Church, especially in President Brigham 
Young's time, it was found necessary for the First Presidency or the 
Twelve, or both, to call brethren, frequently designated as Counselors, to 
help carry on their assigned work in the Church. 

The rapid growth of the Church in recent times, the constantly in- 
creasing establishment of new Wards and Stakes, the ever widening 
geographical area covered by Wards and Stakes, the steadily pressing 
necessity for increasing our missions in numbers and efficiency that the 
Gospel may be brought to all men, the continual multiplying of Church 
interests and activities calling for more rigid and frequent observation, 



GENERAL AUTHORITIES SUSTAINED 95 



supervision, and direction — all have built up an apostolic service of the 
greatest magnitude. 

The First Presidency and Twelve feel that to meet adequately their 
great responsibilities and to carry on efficiently this service for the Lord, 
they should have some help. 

Accordingly it has been decided to appoint Assistants to the Twelve, 
who shall be High Priests, who shall be set apart to act under the direction 
of the Twelve in the performance of such work as the First Presidency 
and the Twelve may place upon them. 

There will be no fixed number of these Assistants. Their number will 
be increased or otherwise from time to time as the necessity of carrying 
on the Lord's work seems to dictate to be wise. 



It is proposed that we sustain as Assistants to the Twelve, the fol- 
lowing named High Priests, who will labor under the supervision and 
direction of the First Presidency and of the Twelve: 

Marion G. Romney, President of Bonneville Stake. 

Thomas E. McKay, former President of Ogden Stake and Acting 
President of the European Mission. 

Clifford E. Young, President of the Alpine Stake.

program, which will have completed its twelfth year of continuous nation- 
wide broadcasting in July of this year, was presented by the Tabernacle 
Choir and Organ, and broadcast through the courtesy and facilities of the 
Columbia Broadcasting System's coast-to-coast network, throughout the 
United States and Canada, and by short wave transmission to many 
foreign lands. This broadcast originated with Radio Station KSL, Salt 
Lake City, and, exclusive of routine introductory and closing announce- 
ments, was as follows :

all men, we pause again within these hallowed walls to welcome you once 
more to the Everlasting Hills of the West. This traditional Temple

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Third Day 



Square performance, now in its twelfth year of continuous nation-wide 
broadcasting, is brought to you each week at this hour through the facil- 
ities of the Columbia network and its affiliated stations. 

We begin with a song written upon one of the most beloved incidents 
of the New Testament : "I think when I read that sweet story of old, 
when Jesus was here among men, how He called little children as lambs 
to His fold, I should like to have been with Him then." 



Announcer, Richard L. Evans : The hymn now to be sung by the 
Tabernacle Choir has come down to us from those whose courage and 
conviction conquered the western desert nearly a century ago: "Come, 
come ye Saints, no toil nor labor fear .... and should we die before 
our journey's through, happy day, all is well." 

"Come, Come Ye Saints" — Clayton Choir 

"Live by my Side" — Bach Organ 

Announcer, Richard L. Evans: Ofttimes in the face of some even- 
tuality that has overtaken us, we find ourselves saying regretfully : "If I 
had only known, I would have done differently." Sometimes this is true, 
but more often it is not the fact that we do not know that gets us into 
difficulties, but rather that we choose to ignore what we do know. We 
mix so little wisdom with our knowledge. We know the facts of history. 
We know what causes have produced what results in the past — but time 
has a way of making the past seem different from the present. We may 
believe that Babylon and Rome fell because of their moral and spiritual 
dissolution. It seems so easy to believe this because it is all far in the past. 
But it does not seem so easy to believe such probabilities of our own 
time and our own generation, however true they may be. From history 
and from scripture it seems quite easy to believe that men have always 
paid a price for disobedience; that the breaking of a law has always 
exacted its penalty ; that the terrible luxury of over-indebtedness has al- 
ways brought a day of disastrous reckoning. It seems easy to believe 
of the past that the Lord God has often permitted evil men to pursue their 
purposes for a short season before over-ruling their evil works. It seems 
easy to believe of the past that those who would rather mortgage the 
future than curtail their appetites, have always been brought low in 
remorse. But what is not so easy to believe, but is also solemnly true, 
is that these same causes will still lead to these same results even in our 
day. We have no charmed immunity from the consequences of our own 
doing. On this point the Father of the spirits of all men has said : 

I, the Lord, am bound when ye do what I say; but when ye do 
not what I say, ye have no promise. (D. and C. 82:10.) 

Knowledge of the past we have — both of scripture and of history. 
It would be well to transmit that knowledge into wisdom, by believing of 
our own generation what we so readily believe of other times.

session of the Conference, and was also released over nation-wide and 
international network facilities. The program was conducted by Elder 
Richard L. Evans ; music was by the congregation of more than 10,000 
voices and by the Tabernacle Choir and Organ, with J. Spencer Cornwall 
directing and Dr. Frank W. Asper at the Organ, and Elder Stephen L 
Richards of the Council of the Twelve delivered the following address : 

ELDER STEPHEN L RICHARDS 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

DESCRIPTION OF THE TABERNACLE 

For the benefit of those who listen over the air, perhaps I should first 
say something about my surroundings at this broadcast. I stand in the 
historic Tabernacle in Salt Lake City. The vast auditorium is completely 
filled by the congregation. Thousands are standing in the aisles and in the 
spacious doorways and more thousands are in the grounds about the 
building, unable to gain admittance. There are more men than women in 
the audience, which, I believe, is rather exceptional in church gatherings 
throughout the country. The people here assembled have come from many 
parts of the United States, chiefly from the West, from Canada, Mexico, 
and some islands of the Pacific. War disturbances have prevented travel 
from Europe and other distant countries. 

Behind the upper pulpit where I stand are seated the Tabernacle 
Choir composed of about 300 singers who serve without pay and who, for 
more than a decade, have gratuitously furnished weekly programs to the 
radio listeners of America. You have just heard the voice of their faith- 
ful, capable announcer, Richard L. Evans. The great Organ of the Taber- 
nacle towers over the Choir in the background, — its massive, ornamented 
structure almost presenting the appearance of another building within 
the main building. 

The Tabernacle has unusual acoustical properties, as some of you 
may have learned. To demonstrate these properties a pin is dropped on 
a table near the rostrum and those who listen in the other end of the 
building, 200 or more feet away, are able to hear it. These remarkable

sound effects are obtained largely through the elliptical dome-like roof 
which was erected by the Pioneers in early days before the railroads came 
to this section of the country. Steel girders were not available, bolts and 
even nails were hard to obtain. So the roof is supported by wooden truss- 
work made of timbers taken from the nearby mountains and in lieu of 
bolts and metal commonly used in such construction, wooden pins were 
employed as fasteners and strips of rawhide used to secure the pins and 
prevent splitting of the timbers. 

The Tabernacle is but one of many enterprises undertaken and suc- 
cessfully completed by the Pioneers, during the time they were isolated 
from production centers. They were of necessity forced to be resource- 
ful and they were not without ambition and skill. They came to this 
then forbidding land of desert and mountains, driven by a great religious 
urge and a still greater religious intolerance on the part of others. The 
story of their persecutions, their drivings and migrations is pretty well 
known. It is doubtful, however, that their motives and their lives have 
ever been generally understood. It is from their motivating concepts that 
I desire to draw the theme of this hour. 

RELIGIOUS IDEALS OF THE PIONEERS 

These Pioneers, who were the progenitors of many who sit in this 
audience and others who hear my voice this day, had the idea that religion 
is the most important and vital thing in the world. They subordinated 
all things to it. They construed it to be broad and comprehensive enough 
to cover every aspect of living. They gave to temporal things spiritual 
significance. They accepted divine law as the standard by which all 
things are rightly determined. They consecrated themselves to the doing 
of God's will and the establishment of His Kingdom. 

So resolute and intent were they upon this latter objective that they 
stood ready to devote time, talent and property to the advancement of the 
Cause in which they believed, often with untold sacrifice to themselves 
and their families. In response to the call of their leaders they frequently 
undertook hazardous colonization projects which deprived them of the 
security and comfort of homes they had built and communities they had 
helped to establish. Then, too, the menfolk would leave their newly 
formed homes with the bare subsistence obtained for their families and 
again at the call of their religious leaders undertake, at their own ex- 
pense, missions for the Church, frequently retraversing the path of their 
migration to distant lands from which they had come or to other countries, 
seeking to carry to others, perhaps their kinsmen, neighbors and friends 
of the Old World, the message in which they believed ; so that in the 
early days of the settlement of this country there were always two armies 
on the march, — one made up of men and women coming from the eastern 
States and from lands across the sea, converts of the new faith, making 
the long, weary trek across the prairies to the land and people of their 
adoption, — and the other made up of missionaries, many of whom came 
from the ranks of these same converts, winding their way back across 
the prairies to expand the knowledge of the truth they had found. It was 



ELDER STEPHEN L RICHARDS 



101 



one continuous round from convert to missionary and missionary to 
convert. 

This was the demonstration of the vitality of their religion to these 
people. No one who knew their sacrifices ever questioned their sincerity. 
They had been taught to make sacrifices and endure hardships for the 
Cause they had espoused by their first leader. His devotion, his persever- 
ance, and his loyalty through the unspeakable persecutions heaped upon 
him, finally resulting in his cruel martyrdom, had served to make the 
hardships and deprivations of his followers seem small by comparison. 
So these men and women of the early days did not complain. They wel- 
comed opportunities for service and they counted themselves fortunate to 
be chosen for great undertakings. 

EARLY MISSIONARIES AND THEIR MESSAGE 

These missionaries of whom I speak were not trained theologians 
and preachers. They were almost entirely made up of men from the or- 
dinary walks of life who made their own living by their own work. Not 
many of them had enjoyed the privilege of extensive schooling because 
schools were rare in those days, but they were hard-headed men of prac- 
tical experience who knew the value of industry and who prized educa- 
tion, even though they may not have had much of it. Many of them came 
from the New England States. Their fathers had fought in the Revolu- 
tionary War, so they knew the meaning and the value of freedom and 
democracy. They believed the Constitution to have been framed by 
divinely inspired men and they loved their country with a greater love 
than in some instances it had deserved at their hands. So these mis- 
sionaries for the most part were loyal, free Americans who went forth 
with conviction in their hearts to preach a religion and a Gospel which 
they believed would make all men free. They had no eloquence but the 
eloquence of their message, but people everywhere listened to them and 
believed in their sincerity and many thousands embraced the truth which 
they taught. 

Perhaps the principal thing which made them feel that their religion 
was so vital and their responsibility in it so great was that they believed 
that Jesus Christ had set in the earth anew His holy Gospel with a new 
interpretation of it for all mankind. They considered themselves under 
obligation to present this new interpretation of the Gospel to every per- 
son possible for them to reach that he might have the opportunity of 
accepting or rejecting the message. I think perhaps you might be inter- 
ested to know what some of these new interpretations which the early 
missionaries carried to the people of the world are. 

They taught that since every man is a son of God, each man is en- 
titled, if he lives worthily, to receive and exercise the power of God in the 
form of the holy Priesthood. They believed that this divine gift and its 
bestowal was not reserved merely for a few selected men,: but that it 
was essential for every man who would do Christ's work effectively 
and prepare himself for eternal life with the Savior of the world. 
They taught that each one receiving this power should use it to bless 



102 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Sunday. AptU 6 Third Day 

the lives of others by performing the ordinances of the Gospel and by 
carrying with him the inspiring and comforting spirit which emanates 
from the Priesthood. They bore witness of the authentic bestowal of 
the Priesthood in their generation and of innumerable demonstrations 
of its efficacy. They interpreted the Priesthood as a divine force coming 
to men on whom it is bestowed to be exercised only in mercy and by 
persuasive means, without any compulsion whatsoever. They taught that 
anyone who sought to use his Priesthood for ulterior purposes or self 
aggrandizement or in any degree of unrighteousness should lose it. It 
was recognized as a Christ-like endowment, thriving only in Christian 
virtue. 



NEW CONCEPTS IN THE RESTORED GOSPEL 



They set forth a new concept of man's body, that it is the tabernacle 
wherein is housed the spirit of man which is the literal child of God, the 
Father, and that no man can knowingly take into his body poisons and 
other deleterious substances without offending God, the Father of his 
spirit, — so that infractions of the true laws of health have spiritual as 
well as temporal significance. They endeavored to persuade men to re- 
frain from indulgence in intoxicating liquors, tobacco, coffee, tea and 
other narcotics, not alone for reasons of health but because they believed 
that such practices would militate against faith and spiritual growth and 
consequently against true worship of God. As a health measure, these 
early teachings of more than a century ago have been amply vindicated 
by modern science and their spiritual value has likewise been sub- 
stantiated. 

Another new concept which these men taught related to the matri- 
monial status. They set forth that marital unions, through the perform- 
ance of proper ordinances under divine authority, may be made to endure 
not for time and earthly life only, but for all eternity; that a man and 
woman properly married by the holy Priesthood may establish a home 
which will be the basis for their exaltation and happiness in the world to 
come ; that all children born to them in this holy compact of marriage 
shall belong to and be with them hereafter; that death does not break 
such bonds and that sin only can sever such ties, — the epitome of such 
teaching being that our heaven is little more than the projection of our 
home into eternity. 

They gave to the world a new idea about salvation. The interpreta- 
tion which they promulgated was that through the atonement of the 
Lord Jesus Christ all men would be resurrected from the grave and come 
forth in a new life hereafter — and this irrespective of the creed they 
might profess or without belief in or acceptance of any religion whatso- 
ever. They made clear distinction between general salvation or resur- 
rection from the grave and individual salvation or exaltation earned by 
a man through his compliance with the laws of God. They taught that 
there are preferential places in heaven as there are on earth and that the 
highest place or Celestial Kingdom could be attained only by those who 
faithfully subscribe to and keep all the laws and ordinances of the Gospel 



ELDER STEPHEN L RICHARDS 



103 



of Jesus Christ and thereby entitle themselves to come into the presence 
of our God and Jesus Christ, His Son. 

They taught, too, that holy Temples dedicated to the Lord are es- 
sential for the administration of some of the necessary ordinances of the 
Gospel to prepare for the highest blessings to which man may aspire and 
that these Temples are also necessary for the accomplishment of certain 
vicarious work to be performed for our ancestors who have passed away 
without knowledge of the Gospel plan, so that ultimately none of God's 
children will be treated unfairly but that each shall have opportunity to 
accept the principles of the Gospel and earn our Father's blessings. So 
confident were these early missionaries as to the necessity and vitality of 
this Temple work that they and their people made almost incomprehen- 
sible sacrifices for the erection of beautiful buildings to be dedicated to 
the Lord for these holy purposes. One such building built at Nauvoo, 
Illinois, at a cost of a million dollars, entailing years of labor and untold 
deprivation to poor people was wantonly destroyed by a mob within sight 
of the people fleeing from their cruelty in evacuation of the city. Where- 
ever the adherents to the faith have gathered in sufficient numbers they 
have always caused to be erected as their most expensive establishment a 
Temple of the Lord for the performance of sacred ordinances and cere- 
monies. 

These missionaries also carried the word that new revelations had 
come from the Lord, setting forth, among other things, these new con- 
cepts of which I have told you and bearing new and additional witness of 
the divinity of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. They acknowledged 
these new revelations as additional scripture to the Bible and as the 
Word of God. They heralded them as a supreme blessing in the resolu- 
tion of doubt and uncertainty and the acquisition of deep and abiding 
faith in the Gospel of Christ. In these revelations are such important 
statements as these : 

Truth is knowledge of things as they are, and as they were and 
as they are to come. 

The spirit of truth is of God. 

And no man receiveth a fullness unless he keepeth His command- 
ments. 

The glory of God -is intelligence, or in other words light and truth. 

No man can be saved in ignorance. A man is saved no faster than 
he learns. Whatever knowlelge a man acquires in this life he will take 
with him into the world to come. 

On the basis of such statements the doctrine of eternal progression 
was deduced and taught. Men were given to understand that through 
obedience to the laws of the Gospel they might continue to grow and 
develop in knowledge and power until in eternity they would come to 
divinity itself ; that the highest order of intelligence is that intelligence 
which comprehends the things of God and eternity ; that, "It is the glory 
of God to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man," and 
that "men are that they might have joy." The place of good and evil in the 
world and their necessity for the exercise of man's free agency were all 
set forth in this new interpretation of the Gospel of Christ. 



104 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Sunday, April 6 Third Day 

A VITAL FAITH THE NEED OF THE WORLD 

I have, of course, only outlined very briefly the distinctive doctrines 
and principles which these early missionaries carried to many countries 
of the earth. My purpose in telling you of this almost incomparable devo- 
tion to a cause is to emphasize the necessity I feel exists in the Christian 
world for a living, vital faith that truly works. Surely all observers must 
be convinced that mere protestation of faith in Christ is wholly inade- 
quate to carry forward His work and set up His Kingdom in the earth. 
"Faith without works is dead." Lip service is futile. No man truly 
loves Christ unless he obeys the laws of His Gospel. We never have the 
truth until we adopt it in our lives. No man learns true worship of 
Christ without truly giving himself to Christian service and I believe 
that no man is a true disciple of Christ who does not acknowledge Him 
for what He really is, the Savior and the divine God of this earth. 

Equivocation about His divinity not only would rob the Christ of 
His real power but it likewise robs the professed Christian of the con- 
cept and the loyalty which alone make him a true disciple. What the 
world most needs today is not so much adoration of the attributes of 
Christ, however beautiful and beneficent they are, as the true worship 
and acknowledgment of the sovereignty of the Lord and His divine 
power. When men and nations look to Him as the arbiter of all ques- 
tions and the principles of His Gospel as the criteria by which all con- 
siderations shall be judged, then, and then only, will the world be the 
beneficiary of the true Christian influence and power. 

IRREVERENCE WEAKENS FAITH 

This will not come about so long as men mock God and set at naught 
His holy laws. No man can love God and damn Him. Irreverence ex- 
pressed in profanity is an all too important factor in weakening Christian 
influence. I call upon men everywhere, for the most part thoughtless 
men, to cease taking the name of God and Christ in vain and to seek 
to establish, among the youth particularly, a sincere reverence for these 
holy Beings. Why do we have to endure such profanity in our military 
establishments ? I should think the Commander-in-Chief would exercise 
his great influence to stop it. 

I am sure that disrespect for sacred names and sacred things has in 
large measure contributed to widespread disregard of law, authority and 
established institutions throughout the land. If a boy is taught to revere 
God and respect his father, we may be pretty well assured of a loyal, law 
abiding citizen, whereas those who blaspheme holy names and speak of 
their parents as "the old man" and "the old woman" are very apt to be 
a liability rather than an asset to society. 

RESPONSIBILITY OF EDUCATORS 

I decry the tendency manifest among certain educators who are still 
greatly in the minority, I am happy to believe, and among other sophisti- 
cated people to tear down the faith of youth and their confidence in 



ELDER STEPHEN L RICHARDS 



105 



eternal verities. I can scarcely think of anything more cruel and mean 
than for one who has had extended educational opportunities and the ad- 
vantage of a position in an institution of learning to impose upon the 
credulity and immaturity of a student and rob the young mind of a faith 
and confidence that will support him at least until he has had experience 
sufficient to make wise decisions. 

Would not the fathers and mothers of America today take great 
comfort if they could have the assurance that all their boys in the training 
camps were fortified and directed by faith in God? I believe they 
would, and anyone who has robbed them of that faith has cause for regret 
and repentance. 

It is therefore living faith in the eternal God and in Jesus Christ, 
His Son and faith in man, too, as the son of God which is so imperative 
today in the advancement of Christian civilization. Such faith will clari- 
fy and not mystify our thinking, our relationships and our aspirations. 

I firmly believe that true science has no quarrel with faith of this 
order. The scientists who are frank enough to admit the limitations of 
their fields of research and demonstration will impugn neither the mo- 
tives nor convictions of the spiritual man of true faith. If they them- 
selves do not share such faith, their very scientific attitude should prompt 
them to say of the faithful, "They may be right, — we do not know. The 
province of the spiritual is beyond the scope of our investigations." 

Now I realize, my friends, that this is a subject on which the ex- 
periences and the convictions of each man determine his attitude and 
conclusion. Faith is individual. No one can acquire it for another. 
About all one can do for another is to voice his testimony and substantiate 
it by consistent living. 

THE VALUE OF A LIVING FAITH 

I take the liberty, in conclusion, to give to you my humble assurance 
that the living faith in Jesus Christ which dominated the lives and work 
of our Pioneer progenitors is alive in the hearts of our people today. I 
know that there is vitality and power in that faith. I have had ample 
demonstration of its efficacy in my own life and I commend it with all 
the power of my soul to men and women of all countries, tongues and 
creeds the world over. It will resolve doubt and uncertainties. It will 
give high purpose to living. It will fortify against temptation. It will 
promote love and charity. It will assuage sorrow, and rob death of its 
sting.- It will bring contentment, peace, enduring happiness, and a spirit 
that passes understanding. 

God grant that such faith may be the portion of men and nations 
and that divine truth may quickly triumph, I humbly pray in the name of 
Jesus Christ, the Lord of this earth. Amen. 

The Choir and congregation sang the hymn, "O Ye Mountains 
High" — Charles W. Penrose. 

An anthem, "Praise Ye the Lord" — Evan Stephens — was sung by 
the Choir.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Third Day 

PRESIDENT DAVID O. McKAY 

Second Counselor in the First Presidency 

From among the sublime teachings of the Savior in the Sermon on 
the Mount I quote the following : 

Seek ye first the Kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all 
these things shall be added unto you. 

This admonition and promise I have chosen for my theme this morn- 
ing because (1) it seems so aptly to epitomize generally the timely in- 
structions given at this Conference. Then, too, it expresses the ideal to 
which every man who holds the Priesthood has subscribed. Again, if 
heeded, it will be the greatest and best safeguard to our sons who are 
called to serve their country. And, finally, I firmly believe that if rulers 
of nations followed that admonition contention and war would be banish- 
ed from among men. 

What the kingdom of God is, is answered by the Prophet Joseph 
Smith as follows : 

Where there is a prophet, a priest, or a righteous man unto whom 
God gives His oracles, there is the kingdom of God. 

Seeking first the Kingdom means subordinating to the principles of 
the Gospel all other aims and pursuits. 

WHAT THE KINGDOM OF GOD IMPLIES 

The term implies divine rule in the hearts and wills of men and in 
society. Man acknowledges a power and authority superior to his own. 
"It is not the arbitrary rule of a despotic Deity, but is based upon man's 
voluntary submission of his will to that of God's." On one occasion Jesus 
said, "The kingdom of God is within you." That is true, for it is in the 
heart of man that membership in the outward kingdom has its origin. 
Devotion and loyalty that spring thus from the heart "for the common 
Father of all mankind is the strongest and only universal bond that can 
bind all men together." Only such a group looking as one mind to 
heaven for guidance can eventually transform human society. 

The Kingdom of God implies also a universal brotherhood in which 
all men acknowledge God as their Supreme Ruler and cherish the desire 
to obey His divine will. 

THE PURPOSE OF THE CHURCH 

The mission of the Church is to prepare the way for the final estab- 
lishment of the Kingdom of God on earth. Its purpose is, first, to de- 
velop in men's lives Christ-like attributes ; and, second, to transform so- 
ciety so that the world may be a better and more peaceful place in which 
to live. 

HOW THE CHURCH CONTRIBUTES TO CHARACTER BUILDING 

In the changing of men's lives the Church recognizes certain funda- 
mental factors so essentially important that they are constantly called to 



106 

Sunday, April 6 



PRESIDENT DAVID 0. McKAY 



107 



our attention, and have been impressively emphasized by the speakers 
in this Conference. For example, recognizing the reality of the divine 
edict "the sins of the fathers will be visited upon the children to the third 
and fourth generation" the Church emphasizes the necessity of moral and 
physical fitness for parenthood. Hence the constant plea that young 
men and women live clean, chaste lives prior to their assuming the re- 
sponsibility of marriage, and their remaining true to that sacred cove- 
nant. Hence is constantly held before us the ideal of Temple marriage, 
where the sanctity of the marriage covenant is sealed and ratified by the 
highest divine authority given of God to man. Hence the emphasis laid 
upon the Word of Wisdom wherein tobacco, stimulants, and narcotics 
are eschewed, and temperance and obedience to the laws of health en- 
couraged and admonished. Hence the teachings from childhood to be 
"honest, true, chaste, benevolent, virtuous, and to do good to all men." 

The Church, recognizing the potency of other influences besides the 
home in the growing child's life before he reaches self-determination, of- 
fers a religious environment almost from the time of birth. The Sunday 
School, the Primary, the Mutual Improvement Association arrange suit- 
able instruction, entertainment, and proper guidance from the cradle roll 
to maturity. 

FIVE FATEFUL YEARS 

Says one social writer : 

The most fateful years in life are the first five, and this is the 
time when life is subject to its environment, and before self-conscious- 
ness and self-direction are aroused. In a large sense man's life has 
its bent and direction, its color and tone before it has begun to reason 
and choose. 

Believing the adage, "Train up a child in the way he should go, and 
when he is old he will not depart therefrom," the Church fosters Quor- 
ums and Auxiliaries in which over fifty thousand officers and teachers 
willingly and gratuitously devote their time, ability, and means for the 
development of character among the children and youth of the Church. 
Parents who fail to encourage their boys to attend their Quorum duties, 
who fail to encourage their children to take advantage of the Sunday 
School, the Primary, and the Mutual are recreant to their duties and to 
their parental responsibilities. 

These are but a few of the aspects of the Church devoted to the phase 
of character building, and to something which is even more precious — ■ 
a testimony of the truth of the restored Gospel of Jesus Christ. 

The first duty of the citizens of the Kingdom is to live exemplary 
lives. 

TRANSFORMING SOCIETY 

But as I have said, the betterment of the individual is only one aim 
of the Church. The complete ideal of Mormonism is to make upright 
citizens in an ideal society. 

On the night of Gethsemane, in the Upper Room, before Jesus and 
the Apostles left for the garden, He prayed : 



108 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Sunday, April 6 Third Day 

I am now no more in the world, but these are in the world ... I 
pray not that thou shouldst take them out of the world, but that thou 
shouldst keep them from evil. 

The mission of the Church is to minimize and if possible eliminate 
these "evils" from the world. The need of such a unifying force is ex- 
pressed by a leading writer (Samuel Z. Batten) as follows: 

The world has many good people in it today, more who are ready 
to believe than ever before, but these people possess no unifying ideals, 
no organic principles, no coherent view of life, no synthetic program 
of action. Society is coming to self-consciousness, and is beginning to 
take note of its troubles and needs, but it has no clear sense of direc- 
tion, no organizing impulse, no all-inclusive ideals, no mighty impul- 
sion. ... Is there anything by which our nature can gain its unity; 
our race acknowledge its brotherhood, our humanity order its affairs 
as a whole? 

We answer, yes — such a uniting force, such an ideal is the Gospel 
of Jesus Christ as restored through the Prophet Joseph Smith. It ex- 
plains man's life and its purpose, and has within it the vital saving ele- 
ments, noble ideals, and spiritual uplift for which the heart of man today 
is yearning. 

Right thinking, upright men and women everywhere are desirous 
of eliminating from our communities evil elements that are constantly 
disintegrating society — the liquor problem with its drunkenness, poverty, 
and misery ; immorality with all its attendant evils ; war, which is liter- 
ally hell on earth, and which is now devastating Europe and Asia; and 
threatening our own land. 

SOCIAL ATTITUDE 

What should be our attitude towards these social conditions ? First, 
see to it that as individuals we do not by our acts contribute to their ex- 
istence, and, second, put forth every righteous effort to eradicate them 
from our communities. 

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is seeking through 
its Welfare Plan, through increased Quorum consciousness and respon- 
sibility, to make both home and community environment better and 
brighter. 

Cooperation and mutual helpfulness are virtues characteristic of the 
Church of Christ. Its watchwords are unity, efficiency, brotherhood — 
a brotherhood in which justice and mercy prompt the actions of all men. 

President Young once said : 

Whoever lives to see the Kingdom of God fully established upon 
the earth, will see a Government that will protect every person in his 
rights. 

And again : 

If the Kingdom of God were established on earth .... one com- 
munity would not be permitted to array itself in opposition to another 
to coerce them to their standard. One denomination would not be 
suffered to persecute another because they differed in religious belief 
and mode of worship. Everyone would be fully protected in the 



PRESIDENT DAVID 0. McKAY 



*109 



enjoyment of all religious and social rights, and no State, no Govern- 
ment, no community, no person would have the privilege of infring- 
ing on the rights of another. 

HONEST LABOR ENCOURAGED 

The arrogance of wealth, and the bitterness of soul that springs 
from poverty would find no place in a society made up of men and women 
who truly believed and put forth sincere effort to live in accordance with 
the Gospel. 

The present strife between capital and labor, which in its enmity 
threatens to undermine the very foundation of the Government, would 
cease, for the spirit and actions of coercion, intimidation, and violence 
are contrary to the teachings of Jesus and by Him would be most vehe- 
mently denounced. Intimidation and dictatorship are elements foreign 
to the spirit and government of the Church. The Church encourages and 
recognizes honest labor whenever and wherever it presents itself, but 
it must condemn the spirit of oppression, of compulsion, of intimidation 
wherever it rears its head. 

No power or influence can or ought to be maintained by virtue of 
the Priesthood only by persuasion, by long suffering, by meekness, 
and by love unfeigned. 

Says Beverley Nichols : 

Economic problems, racial problems, sexual problems, unemploy- 
ment problems, war problems, are myths, ugly phantoms created by 
minds that are not washed with the Spirit of Christ, absurd chimerae 
that could only flourish in deserts across which the shadow of the cross 
has never fallen. I know that our lives have no "problems" as long as 
we trust in Christ, and the fact that my own life is full of problems 
at the moment is only a proof of the distance that I still have to travel 
before reaching perfection. 

There are those in the world who say that jealousy, enmity, selfish- 
ness in men's hearts will always preclude the establishing of the ideal 
society known as the Kingdom of God. No matter what doubters and 
scoffers say, the mission of the Church of Christ is to eliminate sin and 
wickedness from the hearts of men, and so to transform society that peace 
and good-will will prevail on this earth. 

The whole purpose of Christ's existence on this earth was to 
change human nature. And if you deny the possibility, you are saying 
to him, by implication, "Go back ... we don't want you . . . you're 
attempting the impossible." Some brave men have said this, but 
it was the grey uniform of the atheist that they were wearing, and 
not the shining robes of the servant of Christ. 

HUMAN NATURE 

You CAN change human nature. No man who has felt in him 
the spirit of Christ, even for half a minute, can deny this truth, the 
one great truth in a world of little lies. You DO change human nature, 
your own human nature, if you surrender it to Him. To deny this 
is to proclaim yourself as an uneducated fool. 

Human nature CAN be changed, here and now. 

Human nature HAS been changed, in the past. 




GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Third Day 



Human nature MUST be changed, on an enormous scale, in the 
future, unless the world is to be drowned in its own blood. 
And only Christ can change it 

Twelve men did a lot to change the world, nineteen hundred years 
ago. Twelve simple men, with only the wind to bear them over the 
seas, with only a few pence in their pockets, and a shining faith in their 
hearts. They fell far short of their ideal, their words were twisted and 
mocked, and false temples were built over their bones, in praise of a 
Christ they would have rejected. And yet, by the light of their in- 
spiration many of the world's loveliest things were created and many 
of the world's finest minds inspired. 

If twelve men did that, nineteen hundred years ago, what might 
not twelve men do today? For God has now given us the power of 
whispering across space, or transmitting our thoughts from one end of 
the earth to another. What shall we whisper — what shall we think? 
That is the question? 

Every true Latter-day Saint will not only whisper but proclaim that 
"a marvelous work is about to come forth among the children of men." 
I most sincerely bear witness that the Church of Jesus Christ is that 
marvelous work. 



Therefore, O ye that embark in the service of God, see that ye 
serve him with all your heart, mind and strength, that ye may stand 
blameless before God at the last day. 

With faith, charity and love in our hearts let us press ever onward 
inspired by the hope and assurance that — 

There shall come a time when brotherhood shows stronger 

Than the narrow bonds which now distract the world, 

When cannons roar and trumpets blare no longer, 

And the ironclad rusts, and battle flags are furled; 

When the bars of creed and speech and race, which sever 

Shall be fused in one humanity forever. 

That God may give everyone a desire to help hasten that day by ex- 
ample as well as by precept, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 



We are honored this morning by the presence of Dr. James E. 
West, celebrating his thirtieth year as Chief Scout Executive of the Boy 
Scouts of America. In his time nine and a half millions of boys have been 
members ; now one and a half million Boy Scouts are enrolled. We have

THIRD DAY 



AFTERNOON MEETING 

The concluding session of the Conference convened Sunday after- 
noon, April 6, at 2 o'clock. 

Again the great Tabernacle was crowded to capacity ; in addition, 
the Assembly Hall immediately south of the Tabernacle, was filled to 
capacity, and thousands of others congregated on the Tabernacle grounds, 
where they listened to the services as they were broadcast from the 
Tabernacle. 

The Tabernacle Choir furnished the music for this session of the 
Conference — Elder J. Spencer Cornwall, Director ; Elder Alexander 
Schreiner, Organist. 

PRESIDENT J. REUBEN CLARK, JR. 

First Counselor in the First Presidency 

The time has arrived to open the sixth and last session of this 
General Conference. President Heber J. Grant is presiding and he has 
asked President Clark to conduct the services. 

Again I repeat, through the courtesy of KSL and other stations 
cooperating, this service is being broadcast to four stations in Idaho, 
one in Price, and one in Cedar City. The Presidents of Stakes in these 
localities have arranged meetings in various of their Ward meeting 
houses. We have already heard from some of them saying they are having 
a good time. A direct wire from the Tabernacle here to the Los Angeles 
Tabernacle is also carrying the services to that area. 

There are present on the stand this afternoon President Grant and 
his two Counselors, the full quorum of the Twelve, all of the First Seven 
Presidents of Seventies, and all of the Presiding Bishopric. 

The Choir and congregation sang the hymn, "We Thank Thee, O 
God, For a Prophet." 

Elder J. Percy Goddard, President of the Liberty Stake, offered 
the opening prayer. 

The Tabernacle Choir sang "By Babylon's Wave" — Gounod. 

ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

I have been very happy during this Conference, barring the anxiety 
that I have felt and feel, knowing that I would be expected to speak and 
to lead in intelligent, profitable thought the many people assembled 
and those who are on the air listening. The thought of it is almost ap- 
palling. If it were not for the faith that I have in the Lord through 
His Spirit coming to my assistance, I feel that I would wilt. 



112 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Sunday, April 6 Third Day 



A MANIFESTATION OF INTEREST 

I can say that my feelings have been in perfect accord with the busi- 
ness that has been transacted in this Conference, and with all that has 
gone before. I rejoice exceedingly in the blessing of the Lord that 
has been upon us in these various meetings. The attendance at each 
session, including the Priesthood meeting held in this building last eve- 
ning, has far exceeded the seating capacity. Many hundreds of people 
have had to stand. One of the Mission Presidents told me last evening 
after the meeting that he had to stand all through the Priesthood meet- 
ing, that he could not find an unoccupied seat. 

This is a glorious condition. It gives great satisfaction to the Presi- 
dency of this Church, the General Authorities, and I am sure it is pleasing 
to the Lord, — a manifestation of interest in the work of the Lord, in 
which we are engaged. 

JOY IN THE MINISTRY 

I have enjoyed my labors as much during the last six months in the 
ministry as at any other period of my life and experience. I rejoice in 
going out into the Stakes of Zion and the Missions and meeting leaders of 
the people, and the faithful of the people who attend our conference 
meetings. I find as I get better acquainted with members of the Church 
and leaders of the Church, that my love for them increases, and my ap- 
preciation for them and for the Gospel, increases also. The only differ- 
ence between the love that I have for these leaders and the other part of 
the Church membership is that I do not know the others so well. There 
are just as good men and women, they are numbered by the thousands 
in this Church, whose acquaintance I do not have, who are just as good 
and faithful as those with whom I am acquainted. 

I love the Latter-day Saints, and I hope that they can give me their 
love and support in return. I believe I have the confidence of the people. 
I am trying to live my religion as a teacher, to set a good example, and to 
encourage others to live their religion, and to faithfully serve the Lord. 

REVELATION BROUGHT TRUE KNOWLEDGE OF GOD 

In speaking of the Gospel I have in mind now what the Lord said of 
ancient Israel: 

I am the Lord thy God, which have brought thee out of the land 
of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. 

Thou shalt have no other gods before me. 

Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness 
of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, 
or that is in the water under the earth. 

Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, or serve them: for I 
the Lord thy God am a jealous God. 

I am sure that it is displeasing to our Heavenly Father that His 
sons and daughters should worship anything else, or in any other way 
than that which He has designed and taught. The scriptures are replete 
with information pertaining to God the eternal Father, His existence, 



ELDER GEORGE P. RICHARDS 



113 



His attributes, His personality, and qualities, so that there should be no 
question in the minds of intelligent men and women as to what kind of a 
being the God of this world is, the God of Abraham, of Isaac and Jacob. 
Yet the world has been in darkness for ages, with respect to the knowledge 
of God. In His loving mercy, in the opening of this Gospel dispensation 
of the fulness of times He revealed Himself anew to the world of man- 
kind, He and His Son Jesus Christ, our Savior, appearing to the boy 
Joseph Smith, whom He raised up to be a mighty prophet of the last days, 
for the restoration of the Gospel and the establishment anew of His 
Church and kingdom here upon the earth, in preparation for the coming 
of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ to reign as King of Kings and 
Lord of Lords. 

ONE FATHER OF THE SPIRITS OF MEN 

There is a responsibility on the membership of this Church to 
make known to the people of the world this wonderful revelation of the 
Father and the Son, as a part of the restored Gospel. We are told by 
scripture that a belief in God the eternal Father is vitally necessary to 
all intelligent beings. Their faith is centered in Him, and of necessity 
they must have a correct understanding of Him, and know Him as He 
is, a glorified and exalted being in whose image and likeness we are in 
very deed born sons and daughters of God. 

Furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us, 
and we gave them reverence. Shall we not much rather be in subjec- 
tion unto the Father of spirits, and live? 

Many fathers of the flesh, but one Father of the spirits of all men, 
the eternal Father of us all. So every man and every woman under the 
sound of my voice is either a son of God or a daughter of God. He is our 
eternal Father. And as things earthly are typical of things heavenly, when 
we think of Father we naturally think of Mother. We think of being 
born. So we have been born of our heavenly parents in the spirit, and 
in our spirit birth have inherited attributes and qualities of a God-like 
character. What a noble parentage ! What a noble ancestry we are of ! 
What manner of men and women ought we to be? In the language of 
the scripture we might say: 

Look unto the rock whence ye are hewn, and to the hole of the 
pit whence ye are digged. 

The love which our Father in heaven bears for us is divine love, a 
perfect love. Jesus said : 

For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, 
that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlast- 
ing life. 

He gave His Son to a life of sorrow and to a death upon the cross. 
What that meant of sorrow to the Son and to the Father we shall never 
fully know while we are in mortality. We read how that in the Garden 
of Gethsemane He sweat great drops of blood, so great was the anguish 
of His soul because of the wickedness and abominations of the people. 



114 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Sunday, April 6 Third Day 

THE GREATEST GIFT 

Then we read about His death upon the cross. His was the greatest 
gift that ever was given. It is a proof of love, divine, the Father for His 
children, a sacrifice, the greatest ever made; a service, the greatest ever 
rendered. And as He has loved us and done so much for us in providing 
for our salvation, He has asked us, in return, to love Him, even with all 
our heart, soul and mind, and then to love one another, our neighbor as 
ourselves. If we could obey those two commandments, what peace there 
would be in the earth. If all mankind could live up to those two principles 
there would be no more bloodshed, no widows and orphans caused 
through wars rampant in the nations of the earth. There would be no 
hatred in our souls, but love would abound. 

That is what our Father in heaven would like of us above all other 
things, that we love Him first, and that we love one another. In our 
home in heaven there was peace, there was love. After Lucifer was cast 
out, and those with him, there was no more contention. When we come 
to earth, though our recollection of the past is withheld, why should we 
not love one another here ? 

Do we hate those men in high places responsible for war and blood- 
shed, killing and maiming and making widows and orphans? If we love 
them as we should we would not hate them. The mother doesn't hate the 
wayward son or the wayward daughter. A mother's love, next to the 
love that our Father in heaven bears for us, is the kind of love that should 
actuate us, one toward another. Whether we are in the Church or out of 
the Church, we are our Father's children, all of us, and the Lord loves 
us, and no doubt sorrows over the sins and the wickedness of some, and 
rejoices over the righteousness of others. 

SACRIFICE REWARDED 

I trust and pray, brethren and sisters, that we may live up to the light 
of the Gospel which has come to us, for it is a glorious truth. It is appeal- 
ing. There is no question but what the reward in this life and the life to 
come will amply pay for every sacrifice that we make. And brethren and 
sisters, if we ever lose out in the end, and meet with disappointment, it 
will be because we have not done the things which we know that we 
ought to do, and that we have done things that we know we ought not 
to do. In other words, if we live up to the light which we have we will 
not meet with condemnation, but with the favor of heaven. 

May the Lord help us to so live and to labor, in return for the love 
which is extended unto us by our Father in Heaven, and His Son Jesus 
Christ. May we return love and show by our actions that we do 
love the Lord, and let us show by our actions that we do love our fellow- 
men, and that we are going to keep the commandments of God. 

May the Lord bless us and help us to this end, I pray, in the name 
of Jesus Christ. Amen. 



ELDER JOHN A WIDTSOE 



115 



ELDER JOHN A. WIDTSOE 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

My brethren and sisters : We welcome with all our hearts Brother 
Harold B. Lee and the other brethren who have been called to new 
service in the, Church and Kingdom of God. 

This has been a profitable and inspiring Conference. The sweet 
spirit of the Lord has brooded over the sessions of the Conference, from 
the first when President Grant delivered his remarkably impressive op- 
ening address. 

I desire to speak to a simple and well worn subject, one which has 
been touched upon by every speaker at this splendid Conference, and 
which of necessity is approached in every Stake or Ward Conference. 
Yet, it bears repetition. 

TOLERENCE FOR THE OPINIONS OF OTHERS 

I have chosen a theme which seems vital in the lives of Latter-day 
Saints. 

Among the principles of beauty and power which make up the 
Gospel, none is more conducive to peace than the Mormon doctrine 
of tolerance. We are taught to give due respect to the opinions and 
mode of life of our fellow beings. This accepted principle was formulat- 
ed concisely by the Prophet Joseph Smith : 

We claim the privilege of worshipping Almighty God according 
to the dictates of our own conscience, and allow all men the same 
privilege, let them worship how, where or what they may. (11th 
Article of Faith.) 

That is, men may believe and act as seems to them good so long as 
they do not infringe upon our rights or transgress the law. They may 
cherish false beliefs, yet we mingle with them in friendliness. Thereby 
the association of mankind is made tolerable. 

THE CHURCH HAS SUFFERED FROM INTOLERANCE 

We of this Church have reason to be tolerant ; for we know the law- 
less cruelty of intolerance. For over a century we suffered a religious 
persecution of Satanic fury, unparalleled in modern times, and seldom 
if ever surpassed in former days. Often helpless in the face of intoler- 
ant fury, the Latter-day Saints have only been able to say, "Father, for- 
give them, for they know not what they do." If the Lord had not been 
our captain, and truth our chart, men would long since have destroyed 
the Church. We know that tolerance is of God ; intolerance of the devil. 
We are and must remain a tolerant people. 

TRUE MEANING OF TOLERANCE 

However, the true meaning of tolerance is often misunderstood. 
Tolerance has its distinct limits. To allow our neighbors the privilege 



116 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Sunday. April 6 Third Day 

to believe and live as they choose, under the law, does not mean that to 
keep peace we must live as they do. 

Tolerance is not conformity to the world's view and practices. We 
must not surrender our beliefs to get along with people, however be- 
loved or influential they may be. Too high a price may be paid for social 
standing or even for harmony. Appeasement was recently tried in the 
world, and the most hideous war of history is the result. The Gospel 
rests upon eternal truth ; and truth can never be deserted safely. Allegi- 
ance to truth, as well as tolerance, is of the Lord. 

True, there are matters of minor importance to which all may wisely 
conform. Such are the constantly changing conventions or fashions in 
dress, speech and etiquette. Whether a woman wears her hair long or 
short, or a man a soft or a starched collar, are not vital matters. They 
do not violate the law of God, and no one takes them seriously. Wisdom 
dictates to all in the words of Pope : 

Be not the first on whom the new is tried 
Nor yet the last to lay the old aside. 

DANGER IN NOT LIVING UP TO STANDARDS 

But, deviations, however slight, from the straight Gospel path, be- 
come major matters in life. Whatever is contrary to the doctrine or 
regulations of the Church or in violation of our covenants with the Lord, 
in baptism, in the Temple, or elsewhere, is of evil and therefore should 
be spurned. .It is dangerous to play fast and loose with truth and our 
sacred covenants. Spiritual and moral disintegration begins when we 
sacrifice truth to conform with the way of the crowd. The creeping evil 
that then sets in begets indifference and often ends in apostasy. It leads 
to certain unhappiness. 

Clearly, in a world of many men of many minds, it requires at 
times some courage to be true to our convictions. The non-smoker, or 
non-drinker, or non-card player, may feel alone in a smoking company, 
or in a cocktail or card or gambling party. The coward within us 
always shrinks from being a target for observation or criticism. In 
fact, however, the person who stands by his honest convictions wins the 
respect of all decent people. Honest courage is always admired. On 
the contrary, he who is untrue to his professions, to win the favor of 
the crowd, is held in contempt, often unspoken but equally real, by his 
associates. Smoking or drinking young men of Latter-day Saint par- 
entage are seldom welcomed by smoking and drinking employers. He 
who is untrue to his convictions may fail in his business integrity. So 
reasons the wise man of the world. 

THE GOSPEL OF CHRIST FOUNDED IN TRUTH 

Latter-day Saints have no reason to forsake their beliefs for 
the plaudits of the crowd. Rather, there should be a vast gratitude in 
the hearts of the Latter-day Saints. The Gospel is founded in un- 
shakeable truth ; it sheds light upon that which is dark ; it is unsurpassed 
for answering the deep questions of the human soul; its authority to 



ELDER JOHN A WIDTSOE 



117 



act, the Priesthood, sets this people apart from all others in their power 
to perform work for private and public good. Every principle is 
divinely devised for human good. Experience has shown that men are 
better off for keeping the Word of Wisdom, or paying tithes to the 
Lord, or complying with any other Gospel practice. In the midst of 
the world's philosophies, the Gospel of Jesus Christ stands uncon- 
quered. We should be so proud of our membership in the Church of 
Christ, that we would refuse, with disdain, to disobey, for public ac- 
claim or personal appetite, any principle of action within the Church. 

THOSE VALIANT FOR TRUTH ARE CONQUERORS 

Latter-day Saints should be thoroughly loyal to the course of life 
laid out in the Gospel plan. A milk-and-water allegiance kills; while a 
passionate devotion gives life and soul to any cause and its adherents. 
The troubles of the world may largely be laid at the doors of those who 
are neither hot nor cold ; who always follow the line of least resistance ; 
whose timid hearts flutter at taking sides for truth. As in the great 
Council in the heavens, so in the Church of Christ on earth, there can 
be no neutrality. We are, or we are not, on the side of the Lord. An 
unrelenting faith, contemptuous of all compromise, will lead the Church 
and every member of it, to triumph and the achievement of our high 
destiny. 

The final conquerors of the world will be the men and women, few 
or many matters not, who fearlessly and unflinchingly cling to truth, 
who are able to say no, as well as yes, on whose lofty banner is inscribed : 
No compromise with error. At the present moment it is a flaming faith 
in liberty, a phase of truth, that enables England to withstand her 
enemies despite the rain of powder and steel. 

THE SPIRIT OF EVIL RAMPANT 

Our world is sick. Millions of men have surrendered or have been 
made to surrender to an evil spirit — the spirit of Satan. Those who are 
attacked with the malady foam with a brutal, snarling ferocity. They 
have forgotten the kingship of man; they have descended below the 
beasts. They invoke and use the law of the jungle. The prince of 
darkness has world-girdling ambitions. The leaders of the nations, 
stupefied by the incredible prostration of our hard-won civilization, 
stand helplessly among their bombs, airships and submarines. They 
know that the issue is not material, but spiritual. They know that the 
changed heart alone can restore peace to earth. In their inmost selves 
they are calling for men of truth, who will not sell their birthright for 
a mess of pottage, who do not know the meaning of compromise. And 
all the world, the hosts of common men, beckon for such leadership. 
Humanity does not care to live in, and bring children into, a world ruled 
by ignorance, hate, perfidy and blasphemy. 

BELIEVERS IN CHRIST THE ULTIMATE LEADERS IN THE WORLD 

That leadership, the world's prime need, must come, as we know, 



118 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Sunday, April 6 Third Day 

from those who accept the Gospel of Jesus Christ, and who, courageously 
and without apology, cling to its truth and practice. They will be the 
leaven in the lump ; they will be the world's wonder workers ; they will 
be the ultimate conquerors, though they may be but a handful in 
numbers. Goliath's man-made sword was no match for David's faith- 
directed pebble. 

This places a heavy burden upon us, members of the restored 
Church of Christ ; the authorized holders of the Priesthood ; the light- 
bearers and truth-givers of the world. To assume leadership in pointing 
the way to peace has always been the high commission, perhaps the 
highest, of the Church of Christ. In the end, the world's peace de- 
pends on us. This seems a stupendous claim; we make it humbly; but, 
the word of the Lord does not fail. Out of Zion shall issue the power 
that will change swords into plowshares, and make the earth a happy 
dwelling place for men. 

We, the members of the Church, now far-flung over the earth, 
must make and keep ourselves fit by obedience for the mission assigned 
us — the regeneration of the world. It is a call to every member of the 
Church. As we obey the commandments, so will the strength of the 
Church be. As we fearlessly live the law, the influence of the Church 
will cover the earth and prepare it for peace. Delay and vexation, 
sorrow and bloodshed, will overtake us if we surrender our convictions, 
and enter into compromise with the world. It is better to observe the 
law, even in its lesser details. Then we shall have the greater claim for 
personal satisfaction in the days of our years. 

All this was said by our Lord, the Redeemer of mankind. Shortly 
before His sacrificial death He prayed to His Father for those who 
should remain after Him, to carry on the work which He had estab- 
lished. The burden of that immortal prayer was, that His disciples 
should not be taken out of the world, for their message was to the world, 
but that though they were in the world, they should not be of the world. 

I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that 
thou shouldest keep them from evil. They are not of the world, even 
as I am not of the world. (John 17:15, 16.) 

That is the problem of every Latter-day Saint, especially as we 
spread over the earth, and as mankind calls for help: To be in the 
world, but not of the world! To be ever a unique people, a peculiar 
people, in the observance of righteousness. They who fail to do so, 
will suffer cankered souls, will question the value of life, and eventually 
will face spiritual death. 

We all look with trepidation into the future. No land is wholly 
safe. Disaster may overtake any or all. It is folly to trade the perma- 
nent joys of the Gospel for man-made, transient, unsatisfying and often 
injurious offerings. Israel would show the higher wisdom if all of us 
laid away the things that are not in harmony with Gospel law, that 
distract us, take our time, and leave us empty when the day is done ; 
if every man of us would set his house in order until he could say with 
Joshua of old, "As for me and my house, we will serve the Lord." 



ELDER HAROLD B. LEE 



119 



Today, as perhaps never before, the battle-cry of modern Israel, the 
people of the Lord, must be, with respect to the truths of the Gospel : 
"No Compromise."* 

May the Lord bless us and give us faith, courage, clearness of 
vision, and strength of will to live His law, to keep our covenants, and 
to be wholly acceptable servants in His great cause, I pray in the name 
of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. 

PRESIDENT J. REUBEN CLARK, JR. 

First Counselor in the First Presidency 

All of the brethren who have spoken have indicated there are two 
terrors which we up here suffer. One is the anxiety which runs along 
until we are called, and the other is the fear which we have when we are 
called. We cannot relieve Brother Lee of the first, but we will relieve him 
of the second by calling him now, following Elder John A. Widtsoe of 
the Council of the Twelve who has just spoken. 

Our next speaker will be Elder Harold B. Lee whom we sustained 
this morning as a member of the Council of the Twelve. 

ELDER HAROLD B. LEE 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

This morning before I came to the meeting I wound my watch, 
and when the meeting closed I took it out to look at the time. I dis- 
covered that it had stopped at twenty minutes after ten. I was numb 
and dumb. I am not sure, when I finish here, that I shall not find my 
watch completely put out of commission. 

THOUGHTS STIRRED BY NEW ASSIGNMENT 

Since nine o'clock last night I have lived an entire lifetime in 
retrospect and in prospect. I spent a sleepless night. I never closed my 
eyes one moment, and neither would you if you had been in my place. 
Throughout the night, as I thought of this most appalling and soul- 
stirring assignment, there kept coming to me the words of the Apostle 
Paul, that he spoke in explanation of the human qualities that were to 
be found in the Lord and Savior : 

For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the 
feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, 
yet without sin. 

Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we 
may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need. 

One could not have listened to the soul-stirring testimony of Presi- 
dent Grant, in bearing testimony as to his feelings when he was called 
to the apostleship, or his experiences in calling others to similar posi- 
tions, without realizing that he has been close to his Heavenly Father 
in this experience. Therefore I shall take the word of the Apostle 




GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Third Day 



Paul. I shall come boldly unto the throne of grace, and ask for mercy 
and His grace to help me in my time of need. With that help I cannot 
fail. Without it I cannot succeed. 



Since my childhood I have looked upon these men as the greatest 
men on the face of the earth, and now the contemplation of an intimate 
association with them, is overwhelming and beyond my comprehension. 

I thank God today for my parentage. My father and mother are 
listening, either in this great assembly or on the radio, if perchance 
they did not get into this meeting. I think perhaps this is my way of 
paying tribute to the two family names they gave me at my birth, 
Bingham and Lee. I trust I shall not disgrace those names. I have 
been blessed with a splendid father and a grand and lovely mother, one 
who didn't display often her affection, but showed her love in tangible 
ways that, as a child, I came early to recognize as true mother love. 

As just a high school boy I went away on a high school debating 
team. We won the debate. I came back and called mother on the 
telephone only to have her say: "Never mind, Son. I know all about 
it. I will tell you when you come home at the end of the week." When 
I came home she took me aside and said : "When I knew it was just 
time for this performance to start I went out among the willows by 
the creek side, and there, all by myself, I remembered you and prayed 
God you would not fail." I have come to know that that kind of love 
is necessary for every son and daughter who seek to achieve in this 
world: My tribute to my parents. 

Last night, when I left here, as my little family with me kneeled 
down for our family prayers, I tested their faith. I found them true. 
They have given me their assurance, their strength. They are willing 
to make the sacrifice and have accepted this as their call, along with me. 
I have come to know, in these last few years, in my brief service in this 
Church, that without such help from a lovely, devoted wife, willing to 
sacrifice and to keep the home, no man can hold a position in this 
Church and hope to continue to serve as he has been called. To her, 
likewise, as she listens this afternoon and before you I acknowledge her 
loveliness, her sweetness, her devotion and sacrifice. 



For the last five glorious, strenuous years, I have labored, under a 
call from the First Presidency, with a group of men in the development 
of and the unfolding of what we have called the Church Welfare Plan. 
I felt that I should bear my testimony to you concerning that work as 
I close. It was on April 20th, 1935, when I was called to the office of 
the First Presidency. That was a year before official announcement of 
the Welfare Plan was made in this Tabernacle. There, after an entire half 
day session, at which President Grant and President McKay were 
present, President Clark then being in the East — they had some com- 
munications with him, so that all members of the Presidency were in

DEVELOPMENT OF THE CHURCH WELFARE PLAN 



ELDER HAROLD B. LEE

agreement — I was astounded to learn that for years there had been 
before them, as a result of their thinking and planning and as the result 
of the inspiration of Almighty God, the genius of the very plan that is 
being carried out and was in waiting and in preparation for a time when 
in their judgment the faith of the Latter-day Saints was such that 
they were willing to follow the counsel of the men who lead and preside 
in this Church. 

STRENGTHENED THROUGH HUMBLE PRAYER 

My humble place in this program at that time was described. 1 
left there about noon-time, feeling quite as I do now. I drove with my 
car up to the head of City Creek Canyon. I got out, after I had driven as 
far as I could, and I walked up through the trees. I sought my Heavenly 
Father. As I sat down to pore over this matter, wondering about an 
organization to be perfected to carry on this work, I received a testimony, 
on that beautiful spring afternoon, that God had already revealed the 
greatest organization that ever could be given to mankind, and that 
all that was needed now was that that organization be set to work, and 
the temporal welfare of the Latter-day Saints would be safeguarded. 

Yesterday morning in the special Welfare meeting in the Assembly 
Hall, we saw a portrayal of what can be accomplished in one Ward 
where the Lord's organization does work according to His plan. With 
twelve hundred times the kind of demonstration you observed in that 
Welfare meeting, the present problem would cease to be a problem. 
We would be living the Lord's way, for unless we are one we are not His. 

god's will, made manifest 

It was in August of that same year that with Brother Mark Austin 
of the General Committee, I had driven down to St. George and then 
back across the mountains to Richfield, for an early morning meeting. 
At that time there was an upturn in business, so much so that some were 
questioning the wisdom of this kind of activity, and why hadn't the 
Church done it before now? There came to me, in that early morning 
hour, a distinct impression that was as real as though someone had 
spoken audibly, and this was the impression that came, and has stayed 
with me through these years: There is no individual in the Church 
that knows the real purpose for which the program then launched had 
been intended, but hardly before the Church has made sufficient 
preparation, that reason will be made manifest, and when it comes it 
will challenge every resource of the Church to meet it. I trembled at 
the feeling that came over me. Since that day that feeling has driven 
me on, night and day, hardly resting, knowing that this is God's will, 
this is His plan. The only thing necessary today is that the Latter-day 
Saints everywhere recognize these men, who sit here on the stand, as 
the fountainheads of truth, through whom God will reveal His will, 
that His Saints might be preserved through an evil day. 

A TESTIMONY OF THE TRUTH OBTAINED THROUGH EXPERIENCE 

I bear you my testimony that I know that God lives. I know that He

has spoken in this clay. I know that the work that we are now advancing 
and unfolding has still greater potential possihilities. They will come to 
the extent that the Latter-day Saints will learn to do what they are told, 
but not until ; and some of the grandest things yet to come can only come 
if and when we learn to listen to these men who preside as prophets, seers 
and revelators. 

I ask for your faith and prayers, that as the years come and go I 
may be the witness that one who is called to this position is expected to be. 
Will you pray that that might be a fruition of my activity among you. I 
have loved you. I have come to know you intimately. Your problems, 
thank the Lord, have been my problems, because I know, as you know, 
what it means to walk when you have not the money to ride. I know what 
it means to go without meals to buy a book to go to the University. I 
thank God now for these experiences. I have loved you because of your 
devotion and faith. God bless you that you won't fail, but that with this 
Church you and it will go on to a glorious future, I pray, in the name of 
the Lord Jesus Christ, Amen.

PRESIDENT J. REUBEN CLARK, JR. 

First Counselor in the First Presidency 

We shall now have the privilege of hearing a few words from each 
of the brethren who this morning were sustained as Assistants to the 
Council of the Twelve. We shall first hear from President Marion G- 
Romney, now President of the Bonneville Stake. 

ELDER MARION G. ROMNEY 

Assistant to the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

My beloved brethren and sisters, I know I have your sympathy and 
your interest, and I now earnestly beseech you to give me your active 
faith that the few moments I stand here shall not be wasted. 

I have stood before a General Conference but once before in my life. 
That was at the opening session in October, 1938. I was called from the 
audience and had to find my way through the scenery which had been set 
up for the staging of the oratorio Elijah. It seemed as if it took me an 
eternity but as I came on to the stand, President Grant gave me an under- 
standing smile and I was able to get through that opening prayer. 

RESPONSE REGARDING THE NEW CALL TO SERVICE 

I respond to this call as I have responded to all calls that have come 
to me in the Church, although I do not know just what I shall be asked 
to do. You who were here this morning had the same notice that I had 
and know just as much about what the call is as I do ; but whatever it is, 
I know as well as did Nephi of old : 



ELDER MARION G. ROMNEY 



123 



.... that the Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of 
men, save He shall prepare a way for them that they may accomplish 
the thing which He commandeth them. 

I assume that this call will mean some closer association with the 
leaders of the Church ; for that I am very grateful. One of the principal 
compensations that have come to me as a worker in the Church has been 
the opportunity to occasionally meet and shake hands with these leaders. 
I accept them and always have accepted them as prophets of the living 
God. I have never been very particular to determine when they were 
speaking as prophets of God and when they were speaking as men. It 
has never occurred to me that I had the ability to determine that. It has 
been the rule of my life to find out if I could, by listening closely to what 
they said and by asking the Lord to help me interpret it, what they had in 
mind for the Latter-day Saints to do and then do it. I am happy to say, 
not boastfully but gratefully, that I have never hesitated to follow the 
counsel of the Authorities of the Church even though it crossed my social, 
professional or political life. I am very grateful now that I may have 
some opportunity to associate more closely with them. 

SAFETY IN FOLLOWING THE COUNSEL OF OUR LEADERS 

Recently I have read biographies of all the past presidents of the 
Church except President Snow — his I have not had available — as well as 
biographies of Heber C. Kimball, Parley P. Pratt and other leaders of 
the Church. In all the experiences of my life, including this reading, I 
have never learned of a single instance where a person who has followed 
the advice and counsel of the leaders of the Church suffered therefrom. 
On the other hand the record of the past is full of instances where men 
have refused to follow such advice and counsel and as a result have lost 
the Spirit of the Lord and the companionship of His people. These 
observations have persuaded me that the Church leaders speak under the 
inspiration of the Lord regardless of the subject under consideration, 
and have strengthened my determination not to try too closely to discrim- 
inate between when they speak as prophets and when they speak as men. 
I should like very much to avoid the consequence of making a mistake 
for it is a terrible thing to lose the Spirit of the Lord. One of the 
reasons why I have always paid an honest tithing, and a little more, is 
because in one of the revelations the Lord has said that those who were 
not tithed should not have place with those who were tithed, and I have 
desired with all my heart to have a place with the faithful Saints of God. 
I can understand now why it was that my father could pay tithing in the 
days of his distress. After we were driven from Mexico I saw the time 
when he supported a family of seven or eight children — ten at the end — 
on an income of about $45.00 a month, and I saw him go to the Bishop 
every month and pay $4.50 tithing. I used to wonder why it was, but 
I know, now that I have the witness of the Gospel in my own heart. 

God grant that I may not fail in whatever my responsibilities may 
be, and that when I have finished this calling I may be worthy to be 
released honorably and still stand among the faithful of God's servants, 
I ask in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen,

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Third Day 



ELDER THOMAS E. McKAY 

Assistant to the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

I feel very humble, my brethren and sisters, in accepting this call to 
this new position. It is a great honor, but at the same time I realize that 
it is a tremendous responsibility. 

ADVICE OF PARENTS RECALLED 

A little over forty years ago I was at the station in Ogden with my 
parents and a few friends just before I boarded the train leaving for my 
first mission. My mother kissed the goodbye, and as she did so said, "My 
boy, come home clean." I have never forgotten that injunction and I hope 
when I am released from this earthly mission and return to that heavenly 
home where my angel mother now is I can say, as I can say today, 
"Mother, I have come home clean." 

At that same parting my father placed his hand upon my shoulder 
and said, "Remember, my son, it doesn't matter so much where you work, 
it is how you work. You go where the Lord wants you and try to say 
what the Lord wants you to say." I am thinking of those parents today, 
and I wish to express my appreciation for them and for my brothers and 
sisters and my friends. I wish to express my appreciation for the associa- 
tion of President Grant and his Counselors and the other General Author- 
ities of the Church. I love these men and I am grateful for this position 
that will give me the opportunity of more intimate association with them. 

HAPPINESS IN THE GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST 

I am more grateful than I can express for the Gospel, for the testi- 
mony I have of its truthfulness. I wish to testify to you, my brethren 
and sisters, that this is the Gospel of Jesus Christ, that every principle of 
the Gospel has been given to us to make us better and happier here in this 
life. God is our Father. We are all His children, and He has given us 
the principles of the Gospel to make us happy here in this life. "Man is 
that he might have joy." We do not have to wait for the other life, the life 
beyond, to enjoy true happiness ; if we live the principles of the Gospel, 
we can have heaven here on this earth. 

A TRIBUTE TO PRESIDENT GRANT 

I desire to testify to you also that I know that Joseph Smith was and 
is a Prophet of God and that those who have succeeded him have been 
called of God. I wish to express also that same testimony with refer- 
ence to President Heber J. Grant. No one can estimate the good that 
he has accomplished during his Presidency. Think for a minute of the 
change in the attitude of the world today towards this Church compared 
to the time he was called and accepted the Presidency. I testify especially 
to his influence in Europe, which changed prejudice to admiration. How 
grateful I am today that he visited those good people in the European 
Mission and that so many of them heard his testimony. What a com- 



ELDER CLIFFORD E. YOUNG 



125 



fort it is to them in their present sufferings and trials that they have seen 
the President of the Church and spoken to him and heard his testimony. 
I am thankful to have the opportunity of laboring with them, still keep- 
ing in touch with them, trying to encourage them. But their letters are 
more of an encouragement to me because of their faith, I am sure, than 
what I can do or say to encourage them in their faith. God bless them. 
I am grateful that we have a Presidency and other General Authorities 
who appreciate them and are doing everything they can to help them. 

ARMY CHAPLAINS APPOINTED 

I am also grateful that we have men at the head who are taking an 
interest in our soldier boys. God bless these young soldiers. The First 
Presidency is very much concerned about the kind of Latter-day Saint 
chaplains that are sent among them, and have been very fortunate to 
date in having at least eight very fine men appointed ; and through the 
kind cooperation of the Chief of Chaplains of the Army, Col. William 
R. Arnold, these chaplains have been placed where the majority of our 
Mormon boys are located. Remember those boys also in your prayers, 
my brethren and sisters, just as you remember the missionaries and 
our people abroad. 

God bless you, and God bless me that I may be faithful to this added 
responsibility. I appreciate it with all my heart as I appreciate the Gos- 
pel, and may I always be worthy of the Spirit of God to help me in all 
my work, I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER CLIFFORD E. YOUNG 

Assistant to the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

My brethren and sisters, a little over twelve years ago I was sur- 
prised, and I might say shocked, to be called to succeed President Stephen 
L. Chipman as President of the Alpine Stake. I remember well a les- 
son that he taught me then. In being released he and his counselor, 
President James H. Clark, who remained in our Stake, came to the new 
presidency and in assuring us of their support said they wanted to work 
wherever we wanted them to work. And then President Chipman gave 
us some counsel which I have always remembered, and that was to find 
out what was expected of us and then to do it to the best of our ability. 
I have learned to appreciate that counsel, and while I do not know now 
what is expected, (this is entirely new as far as I am concerned, and 
perhaps it is a new departure) I assure my brethren and the Authorities 
of the Church that I will meet this responsibility to the best of my ability 
and will give it the best I have. My one prayer is that I may be able to 
make the right adjustment, that I may not be hampered in any way in 
doing that which shall be expected of me. 

I appreciate my membership in this Church. I am thankful for my 
parents who implanted in their children faith and confidence in this great 
work, and I humbly pray that I may not fail in this responsibility, that 
I may be able to measure up to every requirement and to every expecta- 



126 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Sunday, April 6 Third Day 

tion that you and the Brethren who preside have a right to expect. May 
God help us all to sustain each other and to uphold this work of God I 
humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER ALMA SONNE 

Assistant to the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

My brethren and sisters, I am sure no one can arise for the first 
time on an occasion like this without feeling a thrill of emotion. I have 
spent many hours in the service of our great Church and I want to testify 
to you this afternoon that the compensation for that service has been 
very great. I rejoice in the testimony which I have of the Truth. I 
know God's work has been established on the earth; I know that the 
Gospel is true ; that Joseph Smith was a Prophet of God. I have con- 
fidence in the leadership of this Church. If we follow their advice we 
shall never go astray. May God bless them, and may He bless us that our 
eyes may be open to appreciate and understand the everlasting things 
which will not perish. 

I accept this responsibility with fear and trembling, but I have 
confidence in the promises of God. God bless you. Amen. 



ELDER NICHOLAS G. SMITH 

Assistant to the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

My brothers and sisters, I come before you in humility this day. 
This Conference to me has been a thrilling one. Friday morning as I 
sat and wept as President Grant was giving us his testimony, I was so 
grateful to my Heavenly Father that my life had come so close to his, 
that from my infancy I had known him, that I had been permitted to 
travel with him, to sleep with him, to be in his home, to have him in my 
home. I love him, and above all other men on earth I owe him most. 
Each of the General Authorities of the Church I know intimately. I 
love every one of them, I have never seen one of them do a thing or heard 
one of them say a thing but what was of an uplifting nature. And I am 
so grateful for my association with them. 

MISSIONARY WORK IN THE NORTHWESTERN STATES 

I am grateful to have had the privilege to serve in the mission field, 
grateful for the opportunity that is mine now to be in the Northwest. 
I bring you the greetings of one hundred forty missionaries, lovely young 
men and women, and eleven thousand members of the Church, Latter-day 
Saints scattered all over the Northwest. It is reported that President 
Nibley said, "You can walk up to any old bush in the Northwest and 
give it a kick and out jumps a Jack Mormon." (Laughter.) It is 
strange how far our people have traveled. We find them everywhere, — 
way up in Alaska, in Fairbanks, 100 of them. In Anchorage, now that 
the soldiers are gathering there, there will be many of them. In Ft. 



ELDER NICHOLAS G. SMITH 



127 



Lewis and Camp Murray there are over a thousand of our boys that 
have come from Idaho points. We have been holding meetings with 
them, fine, clean, lovely young men, and it has been a joy to be with them. 
We have there too the careless ones, but there are the fine ones — true 
Latter-day Saints. Their example has been glorious and lovely. 

EXAMPLE OF LATTER-DAY SAINTS 

I had an accident going up into the Northwest with my automobile, 
and had it fixed, and after the garage man had finished I handed him a 
check in payment of $60.00. He took the check and looked at it, on a 
Salt Lake City bank. He said, "You are a Mormon ?" I said, "Yes." 
He said, "I will take your check." I could not have done that in Salt 
Lake City. (Laughter.) Why could I do that? Because of the nature 
of our people who are living in the Northwest — the true Latter-day 
Saints. They have lived a life that means so much, and this little poem 
by Whitney Montgomery exemplifies their lives : 

I knelt to pray when day was done, 
And prayed, "Oh Lord, bless everyone. 
Lift from each saddened heart the pain 
And let the sick be well again." 

And when I woke another day 
And carelessly went on my way, 
The whole day long I did not try 
To wipe a tear from any eye. 
I did not try to share the load 
Of any brother on my road. 
I didn't even go to see 
The sick man just next door to me. 

Yet once again when day was done, 
I prayed, "Oh Lord, bless everyone." 
But as I prayed, into my ear 
There came a voice that whispered clear. 
"Pause, hypocrite, before you pray, 
Whom have you tried to bless today? 
God's sweetest blessings always go 
By hands that serve Him here below." 

And then I hid my face and cried, 
"Forgive me, God, for I have lied. 
Let me but live another day 
And I will live the way I pray." 

Truly that has been the situation in the Northwest. This people 
love President Nibley and the brethren who have presided there. It is 
a lovely mission and people. 

THE CALL TO NEW DUTIES 

Now with respect to this call that has come to me here today — as the 
others have said, it was a complete surprise. I do not know what it means, 
but these Brethren have never touched my life but what it has turned 
into a blessing, and I am grateful to do anything that I can. I do not 
know just what it means to be an Assistant to the Quorum of the Twelve 



128 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Sunday. April 6 Third Day 

Apostles, but I am glad there are twelve men in that Quorum to give me 
a going over and help me out. 

God bless us all to really appreciate what this Church stands for and 
what it means, that we may be true to it, that we may sustain the Gen- 
eral Authorities and each other in our lives, is my prayer in Jesus' name. 
Amen. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

I understand that if my voice is weak, it can be arranged with this 
amplifying equipment so that it will be strong. 



HAPPINESS EXPRESSED IN ATTENDING CONFERENCE 

I am very happy indeed to be here to extend to you good people and 
to all the Latter-day Saints my prayers and love and blessings at the 
close of this Conference. It seems to me that all during my life since I 
first became an Apostle, way back when I was twenty-six years of age — 
so of course I have had almost sixty years of it — that every Conference is 
a little bit better than the previous one, but it seems to me that this has 
been the best that we have ever had up to date, and I am grateful for it. 
We certainly have never had anything to compare with the attendance 
Friday and Saturday at any other Friday or Saturday session of Confer- 
ence that I have attended. The people filled this building at each of our 
sessions. 

I was very much disappointed not to have the privilege of attending 
the Priesthood meeting six months ago, but I was very happy to be here 
last night, and it was a wonderful sight, and a marvelous portion of the 
Spirit of the Lord was present with us. I rejoiced in having the oppor- 
tunity of speaking to the people. I was a little bit afraid that perhaps I 
got a little bit too anxious when I pounded the stand, and maybe if my 
doctor were here I would get a scolding, but I want you to know that 
although my improvement is very slow, each and every day I believe I 
can say truthfully, when people ask me how I am : "A little better than 
yesterday." 

CONDITION OF HEALTH TRYING 

I am perfectly willing to go along as slowly as the Lord wants, but 
the quicker I get so that I can talk faster and get more accustomed to 
these false teeth, the better I will like it. (Laughter.) 

I am free to confess that I do not like the sound of my own voice 
worth a cent. (Laughter.) 

I am very sorry, after laboring more diligently, I believe, than any- 
body else ever did to try to learn to sing a song, that I cannot sing any 
more. But I have been practicing bass sitting next to Brother McKay 
here today, and I have concluded that I had better join the bass choir, 
(Laughter) and say goodbye to the lead. 

Of course it has been quite a trial to me, spending hours without 
sleeping every night, that when I am awake in the night I cannot sing to 
myself, which would help me out a good deal, but I have not been able to 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 



129 



do so. I am inclined to think, knowing from my experience years ago 
when I suffered intensely from insomnia and was ordered to go to the 
Coast, or I might go crazy for lack of sleep, that I can always sleep in 
California and Arizona on the sea level. I think that I shall go away 
from home now for a short time in the hope of improving more rapidly 
than I have improved since I came from California. 

CAUSES FOR GRATITUDE 

I have not the language with which to express my gratitude to the 
people for their faith and their prayers. I know that some people thought 
I never would be able to use my arm again or my left leg, but I can use 
them pretty well. I feel well, and I am very happy in having a couple 
of Counselors who can do all the work that I ought to do, and all that I 
have to do is to sign my name and let it go at that. I have Brother An- 
derson tell me what is in the letter in just a word or two, and then I sign 
my name. 

I have been very, very grateful for the attendance at our meetings, 
and I wish to leave with the people my faith and my prayers for their 
welfare. I would like to say to you good people that the Lord never 
makes any promises but what He fulfills them, and He has promised that 
when we do His will He will bless us, that He will guide us, that He will 
help us, and I am anxious always to try to get the Latter-day Saints 
to do the will of the Lord. 

ANTHONY W. IVINS' CALL TO MEXICO 

I am going to tell you a little experience. I was one of the com- 
mittee that recommended my cousin Anthony W. Ivins to go to Mexico, 
and it was a great shock to me to do so, because I was heavily involved. I 
was receiving 25 per cent per annum on an investment in a cattle ranch, 
that I had refused time and again to take $18,750 for my $12,500 in- 
terest; but you know that little $12,500 paid interest at 6 per cent on 
$50,000 of my debts, and gave me 1 per cent over. I was alarmed about 
having my cousin go to Mexico, and I had refused, as I say, $18,750 for 
my interest in this ranch. When he had to leave the ranch, we could not 
find anybody who wanted it, and we got 60 cents on the dollar. We 
made a very handsome sacrifice, but in the kind providences of the Lord, 
matters pertaining to my affairs changed immediately, and I soon made 
up the loss, and the Lord blessed him down in Mexico. He made a nice 
little sale there of a few million acres of land to Mr. McCornick, Mr. 
Wood, Mr. Hagenbarth and others, and got a nice little commission of 
$40,000, and he paid $2,000 tithing down there, and $2,000 to Bishop 
Empey here. He died thinking that I had supposed that all he had made 
was $20,000, because he told the Bishop : "You must not say anything 
about this, I just kind of thought I would like to pay some tithing up 
here." And so I did not give it away to my cousin. The Bishop had 
never dreamed of such a thing as that Tone would not tell me about it. 
Otherwise, I suppose that he would not have told me. 

But the Lord blessed him and magnified him, and I want you to 



130 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Sunday, April 6 Third Day 

know that as plain as any words that were ever spoken to me in my life 
I heard, when I was feeling very blue — blue as indigo, as the saying is — ■ 
about his going, I heard in the Salt Lake Temple : "He is going where 
the Lord wants him to go, and you shall have the pleasure of welcoming 
him back into this Temple as an Apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ of this 
last dispensation." I turned my head so that my companions could not 
see me, and I shed tears of gratitude for the blessing that was coming to 
my cousin. 

He went there and he made a marvelous record, and that statement 
to me was fulfilled. Finally my associates, as near as I could judge, were 
all very anxious for him to be chosen as one of my counselors. 

The Lord always rewards us and blesses us. 

A PROPHECY FULFILLED 

Never but once in all my life have I stood up in a meeting and 
prophesied in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, and that once was 
many, many years ago up in Idaho, at Paris. I was preaching that we 
should judge things not by the exception but by the general average, and 
that the most prosperous, the most successful, the best financial men 
were those that were honest with God. And it seemed as though a voice 
said to me : "You lie, you lie. You will never live to pay your debts, al- 
though you have been an honest tithe-payer." If I had had a bucket of 
cold water poured over me, it could not have made a greater impression. 

I stopped a moment, then I said, "I prophesy in the name of the 
Lord Jesus Christ that what I have said to you people is true, and that 
the Lord rewards us when we do our duty, and I prophesy that although 
I am a ruined man in the estimation of many men, I will yet live to pay 
my debts." And I was just $91,000 worse off than nothing, had two 
wives to support and the children of a dead wife. But from that very 
day my prophecy was fulfilled. The Lord blessed everything I touched, 
and in only three short years I was even with the world, financially 
speaking. 

BLESSING AND TESTIMONY 

I leave my testimony with you that this is God's work, and that it 
is by men responding as these five men have done that the work pro- 
gresses. They say they do not know what they have to do. I will tell 
them what they have to do : They will have to work right straight along 
for the Church the way the Apostles work, they will have to make some 
changes in their lives, and they will have to devote themselves more to 
the work of God than they have ever done before, and they will have joy 
in doing so. 

I pray God to bless you good people. I bless the honest the world 
over. I pray you to have no hard feelings in your hearts toward many 
of the people who are in the war, who are fighting against England, be- 
cause many of them would give their lives, almost, if they could get out 
of that kind of fighting. I want you to know that from Holland and 
Germany some of the choicest and finest men that have ever been mem- 
bers of this Church, came. Karl G. Maeser's name will always live 



PRESIDENT J. REUBEN CLARK, JR. 



131 



among us. He was a marvel of spirituality and he impressed and blessed 
the youth of Zion. I want you not to feel hard toward the Germans, even 
though they are fighting, because there are many of them that would be 
grateful and thank the Lord Almighty if they did not have to fight. 

Let us do our best to encourage our boys in the army to live the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ as perfectly as though they were in the mission 
field, and to seek God for the guidance of His Spirit and its protecting 
care. Encourage your loved ones. I regret beyond all my powers of ex- 
pression that we have to send our boys to war, and I feel that we would 
not have needed to do it if we had been governed properly. 

I beg pardon, the doctor will get after me for sure. (Laughter.) 

I was going to say some more, but I had better keep still or it will 
be called politics. You know, I have contempt for politics, because, as 1 
have said for many years, they are like the measles, if you will just take 
a little saffron tea and keep the measles on the surface, they will not hurt 
you, but if they set in on you they turn your hide yellow and make you 
cross-eyed. (Laughter.) 

Well now, I would like us to close on time. I want to bless the Latter- 
day Saints the world over and the honest the world over. I want to 
thank this choir from the bottom of my heart for what they are doing 
for us. I want to thank the choir and the orchestra that came from 
Provo, also the choir that came from Blackfoot. May the Lord bless 
them all. They are doing a great work, a great missionary work. I am 
grateful for all the blessings of the Lord to me. I have been blessed 
more than I could have hoped or expected. All that I have and all 
that I amount to I owe to my sainted mother. 

I pray the people to remember to honor their parents, follow that 
commandment. It is one of the greatest in all the world. Children, hon- 
or your parents. 

God bless you. Amen. 

PRESIDENT J. REUBEN CLARK, JR. 

First Counselor in the First Presidency 
May I for President McKay and myself say what I am sure you 
know must be true, that we make no important decision without consult- 
ing President Grant, and his mind is as clear and concise and accurate as 
it ever was. 

The Tabernacle Choir sang "Hallelujah" {Messiah) — Handel. 

PRESIDENT J. REUBEN CLARK, JR. 

First Counselor in the First Presidency 
I should like to add my thanks to those expressed by President Grant 
for this wonderful music by the Choir. 

Drive carefully, please, going home ; pedestrians walk cautiously. 
After the benediction this Conference will stand adjourned sine die. 

The benediction was pronounced by Elder M. Howard Randall, 
President of the Morgan Stake. 

Conference adjourned sine die.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



The musical exercises at the Friday sessions were furnished by the 
Brigham Young University Chorus and members of the Provo Duo Stake 
Choir, Drs. Franklin W. Madsen and Florence Madsen, Directors; at 
the Saturday sessions, by the Blackf oot Stake Choir, Elder Ronald Bitton, 
Director ; and at the Sunday meetings by the Tabernacle Choir, J. Spencer 
Cornwall, Director.

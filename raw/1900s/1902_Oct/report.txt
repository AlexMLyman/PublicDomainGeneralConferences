OPENING ADDRESS. 

PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 

Greeting— Causes for thanksgiving— God's bless- 
ings increase through faithfulness — More 
Temples to be built — Great responsibility 
resting upon the Saints. 

My beloved brethren and sisters, I 
greet you heartily this morning in your 
attendance at this the 73rd Semi-annual 
Conference of the Church. I am pleased 
to see such a good representation here 
this morning. Especially am I pleased 
tn see so many of the presiding au- 
thorities of the Church — the Apostles 
and the presidents of stakes, and also 
many of the presidents of the various 
missions of the Church. It is indeed 
gratifying to see these our brethren 
assembled here, on whom rests so greit 
a responsibility, they having been en- 
trusted with the proclamation of the 
Gospel to the nations of the earth and 
with the care of the flock of Christ in 
the various Stakes of Zion. 

During this conference we desire, as 
far as the time will permit, to give an 
opportunity to as many as possible of 
the Elders who are presiding abroad, 
and of the presidents of the stakes o*

GENERAL, CONFERENCE. 



Zicn, to express themselves; and in or- 
der that we may reach as many as pos- 
sible, we desire that the brethren who 
speak shall have that portion of the 
Sp'rit of God that will enable them to 
speak clearly, pointedly and briefly up - 
on those subjects that may come to 
their minds. 

We have here the Apostles, the Pres- 
idents of the Seventies, and the Presid- 
ing Bishopric, who are practically tra v- 
eling' Elders in the Church, visiting the 
stakes of Zion and the various mission 
fields, from time to time, and they are 
especially posted in relation to the con- 
dition of the work of the Lord in the 
various fields that they have visited 
and will be able to speak to us in rela- 
tion to those subjects and matte :-s 
that will be most interesting and neces- 
sary for the general enlightenment of 
those who have come to the conference, 
and to the edification of the whole peo- 
ple. 

We desire to say to the people th-it 
we feel very grateful to the Lord for 
His continued mercy unto us, and, noL- 
w ithstanding the drouth of the past 
season, which has been almost unpre ■ 
cedented in many parts of the country, 
we feel that the Saints have been great- 
iv blessed, and that there will be r.o 
necessity for any great lack or want 
among the people in consequence of the 
drouth, but we feel that all will be 
blessed with sufficient for their needs. 
In many parts of the country we have 
been exceedingly blessed. There has 
been an abundance of water, and in 
some sections our people have been 
visited by unprecedented rains, result- 
ing in great floods, which have done 
nr. ore or less damage to the people; bvt 
this, of course, is not to a very great 
extent. 

We feel in our hearts that Zion is 
prospering, and that all is well with 
the people of God at large; still, we re- 
alize that there is great room for us 
to improve, and that the opportunities 
for advancement are very extensive. 
We hope that all the Latter-day Saints 
will continue their diligence and faith- 
fulness before the Lord in the work in 
which they are engaged, that Zion may 
continue to flourish in the tops of the 
mountains, and that the purposes of 



God Almighty concerning His peop^ 
and His work in the latter days may be 
consummated and fully realized. We 
fe<*l that the Lord will bless His peo- 
ple, and the earth, for their sake, in 
the future more abundantly than in the 
past. In proportion as we renew and 
redouble our diligence and faithfulness 
betore the Lord in keeping His com- 
mandments and walking in all right- 
tcusness and acceptableness before 
Him, so will His blessings x>e increas- 
ed upon the people, and upon all their 
substance, and upon the earth which 
they inhabit. 

We congratulate you, brethren arid 
sifters, on your appearance here this 
morning, and we pray God to pour out 
upon you and upon all of us His Ho'y 
Spirit during this Conference, that we 
may have a time of rejoicing, and that 
we may be able to act intelligently 
and wisely on all matters of business 
that may be presented before us; that 
we may have the spirit of union, love 
and devotion to the cause of Zion abid- 
ing in our hearts; that we may have no 
feelings of dissension, but that we may 
be one, that we may be indeed the peo- 
ple of God. 

It is not my purpose to prolong my 
remarks this morning, but I desired to 
express my gratitude to my Father 
in heaven for all His mercies and bless- 
ings unto us. 

We will say to the people that we 
have no reason to complain of the dili- 
gence of the Saints, so far as we are 
able to judge, in keeping the law of 
tithing. We believe that the Latter- 
day Saints are observing that law as 
faithfully as they have ever done, and 
we beseech of you that you will con- 
tinue to do this until our hands shall 
be freed from all obligations, and until 
we shall have means in the storehouse 
of the Lord with which to accomplish 
greater works, which may be neces- 
sary to be done. We feel there is much 
that can be done and much that ought 
to be done in the interests of Zion and 
for the benefit of the people of God. 

We feel that an effort should be 
made to preserve the Temples of God, 
those houses that have been erected for 
the purpose of administering the ordi- 
nances of the Gospel therein for the 



ELDER JOSEPH E. ROBINSON.

livmg and the dead. We desire that 
these building's shall be preserved and 
kept in repair and in a wholesome con- 
dition, so that the Spirit of the Lord 
may dwell in them, and that those who 
minister therein, may feel the presence 
and influence of His Spirit. We also 
feel that when the time shall come and 
our hands shall be free from the ob- 
ligations that now rest upon us, other 
pl'tces should be prepared for the con- 
vergence of the Latter-day Saints in 
more distant stakes, in order that those 
who are living at great distances from 
the center may have the privilege of 
receiving the ordinances of the Gosp«l 
without being put to the great expense 
and loss of time that is necessary now 
in journeying from 500 to 1,000 miles in 
order to reach the houses of God. We 
hope to see the day when we shall have 
temples built in the various parts of 
the land where they are needed for the 
convenience of the people: for we re- 
alize that one of the greatest responsi- 
bilities that rest upon the people of God 
today is that their hearts shall be turn- 
el unto their fathers, and that they 
shall do the work that is necessary to 
be done for them in order that they 
may be joined together fitly in the bond 
of the New and Everlasting covenant 
from generation to generation. For the 
Lcrd has said, through the Prophet 
Joseph, that this is one of the greatest 
responsibilities devolving upon us in 
this latter day. 

God help us to do this work and help 
up. to be faithful, one and all, that we 
may have means with which to accom- 
plish it, is my prayer, in the name of 
Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER JOSEPH E. ROBINSON, 
(President of the California Mission.) 

My very beloved brothers and sisters, 
when I heard the voice of the Prophet 
of God say that all is well in Zion, the 
words of one of the Prophets of old 
came to my mind: 

"How beautiful upon the mountains 
are the feet of him that bringreth good 
tidings, that publisheth peace; that 
bringeth good tidings of good, that pub- 
lisheth salvation; that saith unto Zion, 
Thy God reigneth!" 



In the California Mission we are not 
always blessed by the presence of those 
who bring good tidings of good; we 
often hear the people of Zion villified 
and spoken of evilly. It fills my heart 
with joy to know that those whose in- 
terests are our interests, and who have 
done so much for our common weal in 
fostering our industries, can say that 
all is well, and they have no com- 
plaints in regard to the law of tith- 
ing and other matters relating to the 
Saints of God. 

In our mission we have the same 
spirit that characterizes the saints of 
God in all the world. The hearts of the 
Saints there turn to you in these val- 
leys, and deep in their souls they have 
a desire to come to the Temple of the 
Lord and receive their blessings, and 
some few have been so privileged. They 
feel a pride in all your successes. When 
they hear of any great thing you do or 
any good thing that is said of you, 
they rejoice, and feel that they are 
entitled to do so, because they are of 
you, though not with you. When the 
Tabernacle choir visited us it feasted 
our souls. We sensed again that the 
prophecy was being fulfilled wherein 
it was said that in Zion there should 
be the voice of thanksgiving and mel- 
ody. When we lifted up our voices to- 
gether this morning and sang in unison, 
it brought to my mind this saying of 
old: 

"Thy watchmen shall lift up the 
voice; with the voice together shall 
they sing; for they shall see eye to 
eye, when the Lord shall bring again 
Zion." 

The Saints of the California Mission 
have been valiant and earnest in the 
payment of their tithes. They feel 
that they are adding to the glory of 
Zion and to the wealth of their own 
souls by the practice of self-abnegation 
and self-sacrifice. Though we number 
but about six hundred souls, and quite 
a percentage of them, I am sorry to 
say, are not the most faithful, yet to 
date we have paid something over 
$3,000 in tithes, besides liberal offer- 
ings. The Elders are valiant, earnest, 
and God-fearing; many of them are 
boys, several being under twenty years 
of age. Among them are some most 
promising speakers, humble, childlike.

GENERAL, CONFERENCE. 



feeling their dependence upon the Lord, 
and knowing that it is not sufficient to 
be able to quote scripture to substan- 
tiate our belief, but that they must 
live in accordance with the Spirit of the 
Lord to gain favor with the honorable 
of the world. I often tell them that it 
it not enough to be able to quote scrip- 
ture; for many of the people of our 
cosmopolitan state know but little of 
the scriptures, and many of those who 
have a knowledge of them do not be- 
lieve them, and they ask for more ma- 
terial results. "Show me," they say, 
"wherein the Gospel which you teach 
has benefited and helped you to do bet- 
ter. What has it done for your com- 
monwealth? Show me the logic or the 
philosophy of the Gospel which you 
preach." How soul-satisfying it is to 
be enabled to say that it has made a 
peace-loving people, a patriotic people, 
a people that live in their own homes to 
a very great extent, a people that have 
not mortgaged themselves, a people 
that are tolerant, a people that have 
been gathered out from almost all lands 
and climes, with one purpose, one am- 
bition, and have dropped their national 
antipathies and animosities, and in 
their children have become one. When 
I heard of the reply that Ambassador 
White had made to Count Tolstoi, that 
when the youth of Zion grew up and 
began to assert their individuality, 
then the fabric which had been woven 
and the building which had been con- 
structed by Mormonism would fall to 
pieces, I thought how little he knows of 
us. I can remember when our fathers, 
who had been gathered from many 
lands, had differences with each other. 
Having been brought up under different 
environments and training, they had 
different methods of gaining a liveli- 
hood and varied ideas as to what 
should be accomplished, and sometimes 
they clashed one with another. But 
now we find that their sons have 
dropped the differences of nationality, 
and enjoying the same testimony that 
their fathers have borne in relation to 
the truth of the Gospel they are one in 
intent and purpose, and I trust are 
more fixed, if possible, upon the one 
object of upbuilding the kingdom of 
God than were their fathers and mo- 



thers. This to me is a testimony of the 
Gospel of Christ. 

Our Elders meet with the same ex- 
perience that they do in other lands. 
During the last five months we have 
met with a great deal of opposition, es- 
pecially on the streets. Some few men 
have apparently dedicated themselves 
to the purpose of driving us out of the 
state, exposing our fraud, as they term 
it, and the life of hypocrisy which they 
accuse us of leading. They have met us 
on every street corner and in every way 
imaginable. When they have learned 
that we had some friends, they have 
sent people to them to embitter their 
minds against us; and in one city they 
have gone so far as to print a little 
tract about us, signed by the ladies of 
three leading religious organizations. 
This tract has been distributed broad- 
cast. They did not pass by the house 
of the Elders even, but left us a copj r . 
We feel that this is in part due to the 
visit of the choir and to the attention 
it attracted toward us in that state, 
and to our renewed efforts to be heard 
and seen. I have found it necessary to 
call upon the mayor and the chief of 
police of some of the cities, and express 
to them the wish that they would see 
that we, as American citizens, should 
not be villified beyond endurance; and I 
am glad to state that they have ac- 
corded me a most kindly hearing and 
given me the protection asked for, so 
much so that some of the most per- 
nicious speakers have been told that 
they could no longer speak upon the 
streets. By the way, one of them has 
since been welcomed into the pulpit of 
one of the leading churches and Is now 
preaching there. 

We have not had many baptisms so 
far this year. It has not been a season 
of harvesting. But our hearts have 
been filled with joy because of the 
thousands of strangers who have heard 
our testimonies. In that land of golden 
sunshine there are thousands of people 
from the east, who come there for the 
sake of - the climate. Many of them 
come to hear us, perhaps in many in- 
stances where they would have nothing 
to do with us at their homes, because 
of the same spirit that Nicodemus man- 
ifested when he came to the Savior by 



ELDER EPHRAIM H. NYE.

night. We have visited the homes of 
3,000 strangers, and re-visited over 
4,000, as well as holding the Saints to- 
gether. We have distributed something 
like 38,000 tracts, besides loaning a num- 
ber of books. "We do not have the suc- 
cess in selling our literature that some 
of the brethren report in other parts 
of the United States. The people do 
not seem to care to buy from us, or 
else we are not very good canvassers 
along that line. But we have given 
away a goodly number, and are trying 
to place the Book of Mormon, in par- 
ticular, in a way that the people will 
take hold of it, because of the price that 
the book is now held at and the gra- 
cious donations given to us by the 
Presidency of the Church. 

I do not feel that it would be proper, 
my brethren and sisters, for me to take 
more of your time; for you have come 
to hear the words of the prophets of 
the living God; but my testimony is 
that God lives, that His work is ad- 
vancing, that we are beginning to be 
known as His people, and that the peo- 
ple of the world sense the fact that 
there is something in the very genius 
of the Gospel we teach which has more 
to do with this life than any of their 
plans or schemes. They see, too, that 
it is beneficial, and they would rather 
have something that is practical, and 
that does not deal alone with the dead 
past. Many friends have been raised up 
unto us who have said that they knew 
we had more to offer than any other 
religious denomination, but that they 
cared nothing for any church. We have 
been fortunate in becoming acquainted 
with some of the leading citizens in the 
state, and among the medical frater- 
nity we have friends who have cared 
for the Elders and do care for them 
without price, and who have told me 
to send the Elders to them if they ever 
needed any consultation. I think some- 
times, because of the reputed good cli- 
mate of California, that several Elders 
have been sent to me that were not the 
soundest in health. This season 1 have 
had six or eight who have had to be 
cared for nearly the whole season. 

May God bless and prosper you in 
your labors, increase your love for the 
Gospel, help you to subjugate your pas- 



sions, wean yourselves of improper de- 
sires, correct your judgment, peace at- 
tend you in your homes and joy await 
you at your gates, is my prayer in the 
name of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER EPHRAIM H. NYE. 

(President of the Southern States 
mission.). 

My Brethren and sisters, it is a joy, 
greater and grander than I have words 
to express, to have the privilege of 
coming up to Zion occasionally. 
President Robinson, who has addressed 
you, succeeded me in the care of the 
California mission. I took great pleas- 
ure in laboring in that mission, and in 
turning it over to him when I was re- 
leased. It fell to my lot to be sent to 
the Eastern states, and after laboring 
there for a season, to be sent into the 
Southern states, where I was met by 
President Ben E. Rich, and given a 
royal welcome into that region, and 
relieved him of a part of his responsi- 
bilities. 

I am not prepared to say very much 
about the Southern States mission, as I 
have hardly got seated in the saddle 
yet, and have not had a fair opportun- 
ity to know much about it. I have 
traveled through the mission, and have 
visited the Elders in their conferences 
and labored somewhat with them; but 
it is only about three months since I 
went in there. I find a great differ- 
ence between laboring among the peo- 
ple of California and the people of the 
"Sunny South;" but I labor there with 
the greatest possible pleasure and with 
a desire to bring souls to a knowledge 
of the truth and into the fold of Christ, 
and help to lift some of them, at least, 
upon a higher plane, that they may 
come up to the standard required of 
Latter-day Saints. I take joy in min- 
istering among that people, and I hope 
to see the results of my labors as the 
years roll on. 

What is now known as the Southern 
States mission embraces the states of 
Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Florida, 
North Carolina and South Carolina; 
and we have about 100 Elders in the 
field. We would like to have twice 
that number; we could use them very

well. We hope we may be permitted 
to have many more than we now have. 
The Elders are a brave and noble set. 
You fathers who have sons there, be 
proud of them. You wives who have 
husbands there, be proud of them. 
They are serving' God to the very ut- 
most of their ability, and they are pass- 
ing through scenes and trials that you 
have no idea of. Let your prayers as- 
cend unto the Almighty in their be- 
half; for they are faithful and valiant 
in the discharge of their duties. I do 
not expect to do any better there than 
my predecessor. Brother Rich » has 
performed a noble work. If that can 
be said of me when I am released 
from that mission, as it can justly be 
said of him today, I shall be satisfied. 

I feel like taking the admonition of 
the President and not occupy too much 
time. I rejoice in the knowledge of t v e 
truth, and in the opportunity of com- 
ing up here and worshiping once or 
twice a year, beholding the faces and 
hearing the voices of the Prophet and 
his associates, that I may learn more 
perfectly the ways of God and be bet- 
ter fitted and prepared to perform the 
labors and duties that rest upon me, 
and go back to my labors strengthened, 
filled with integrity and faith to go 
forth and prosecute the ministry de- 
volving upon me. That the blessings 
of the Almighty may rest abundantly 
upon the Latter-day Saints, that you 
may grow and increase in the knowl- 
edge of the truth, and rise higher and 
higher in the standard of perfection 
until you shall reach that position that 
the Almighty requires the Latter-day 
Saints to come up to, is my prayer in 
the name of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER BEN E. RICH. 

(President of the Middle States Mis- 
sion.) 

My brothers and sisters, it has been 
promised by the Lord that in the last 
days He would establish a kingdom 
upon the earth, and the promise was 
also given that it would never more be 
thrown down or given to another peo- 
ple, but that it would be like unto a 
little stone cut out of the mountains 



without hands, which should roll forth 
and eventually fill the whole earth with 
righteousness. It was promised by our 
Master while He was dwelling in mor- 
tality that one of the signs of His 
second coming would be the preaching 
of that Gospel planted upon the earth 
by Him, built upon the foundation of 
apostles and prophets and revelation 
from God, preached without purse or 
scrip, the fundamental principles of 
which would be faith in Him, repent- 
ance of sin, baptism for the remission 
of sin, and the gift of the Holy Ghost 
by the laying on of hands. 

We are living in an age, whether 
the world believe it or not, when these 
promises are being fulfilled; when the 
God of heaven has established a 
kingdom upon the earth, and notwith- 
standing the fact that the powers of 
the earth have been arrayed against it 
from its organization up to the present 
time, it has been rolling forth, it has 
been growing and multiplying in 
strength and influence. Its destiny is 
to fill this earth with the righteous- 
ness of our God, and it is being 
preached in fulfillment of the Master's 
word, as a witness unto all the na- 
tions of the earth, before the end of 
Wckedness shall come. 

We have been blessed to live in this 
dispensation, and to be made ac- 
quainted with the principles of the Gos- 
pel; and God has given to us through 
the whisperings of His Spirit a tes- 
timony of the truthfulness of the same. 
It has been my privilege to be in the 
world for some little time, directing 
the missionary work in some of the 
states and aiding to warn the people of 
the world to flee from the wrath to 
come. We do not anticipate convert- 
ing the world. Our mission is to gath- 
er in the honest in heart from among 
the nations of the earth, to warn all 
mankind, and to preach the Gospel as a 
witness, in fulfillment of the Master's 
word. 

In the missionary field we meet many 
things that you dr not meet at home. 
Many things happen that you pay no 
attention to, and yet they are mag- 
nified by the people of the world; and 
\.n?ess the Almighty continued to 
magnify us and our ability before the

people of the world and softened the 
hearts of the people towards us, and 
led us to the doors of those who are 
searching after the truth, we wou.d 
have a very hard time indeed. The 
missionaries are entitled to the faith 
and prayers of all Saints. The sun 
should never go down without the 
Latter-day Saints being- able to say, 
This day I have prayed for those who 
are laboring- in the nations of the earth 
to spread the principles of ■', eternal 
truth. Everything that happens is con- 
strued by the world in such a way as 
to bring the work of God into ill repute 
before the people. Inasmuch as I am 
laboring in the world where we have 
to meet these things, I may be justi- 
fied in alluding to the fact that this 
awful crime which was committed re- 
cently in New York City (you all know 
what I refer to) has been magnified in 
all the great newspapers of the country 
in an effort to bring the horrible deed 
home to the "Mormon" Church. In 
flaming headlines they state that the 
doctrines of the "Mormon" Church are 
responsible for that crime and the con- 
dition of that unfortunate creature who 
now rests in a prison cell! I have won- 
dered many times if the non-Mormons 
v/ho live here, who are reaching out 
after the patronage of the Latter-day 
Saints, and who know us as we are, 
would not have the manhood, the inde- 
pendence, the Americanism burning in 
their veins to raise their voice in a 
protest against the awful things 
charged against these good men who 
stand at the head of this religious or- 
ganization. The Latter-day Saints do 
not have to rely upon any man for a 
testimony of the truth of the Gospel. 
They have received it, accord- 
ing to promise, from heaven. 
The whispering of the still small voice 
of God has told them that Joseph Smith 
was a Prophet; that his successors in 
office at the head of the Church have 
been and are Prophets, Seers and Rev- 
elators; that these brethren here are 
Apostles of the Lord Jesus Christ,' and 
that the Gospel is true. They have 
been taught to let their light so shine 
that it will not be hid. But those who 
are not of our faith, and who have lived 
for years in our midst, know the many 



falsehoods that have been circulated 
about us. They know that meji who 
have resided here, and who have been 
treated in a kindly way, ha*ve gone east 
and filled the minds of the people with 
the most damnable lies about us. And 
I have waited for many years to see if 
there would not be a spirit of fairness 
bubble up in the hearts of the non- 
"Mormons" of Utah, and a protest sent 
out by them against the many lies cir- 
culated concerning this people. 

They say that the "Mormons" believe 
in blood atonement. "We do believe in 
blood atonement; and so does all the 
Christian world believe in blood atone- 
ment. We believe in the atoning blood 
of the Lord Jesus Christ, that it will 
cleanse mankind from all sin, upon 
condition of obedience to the laws of 
the Gospel. There is not a Christian 
nation on earth who does not believe 
or pretend to believe in blood atone- 
ment just as the Latter-day Saints be- 
lieve in it. Oh, but the "Mormons" 
believe in another kind of blood atone- 
ment! it is said. Well, we do, in the 
same way that this nation believes in it, 
and in no other way — in the way that 
God revealed it to the ancients, that 
if man spilt man's blood, by man should 
his blood be spilt. There is not a state 
in this glorious Union of ours that does 
not believe in that kind of blood atone- 
ment. So far as putting a murderer to 
death is concerned, we believe that if 
the right punishment were inflicted up- 
on the individual it would not be by 
strangling him to death or by placing 
him in an electric chair, but it would be 
an execution whereby his blood would 
be shed. Thank God, In this state there 
were enough in the Constitutional Con- 
vention who believed in that principle 
to wisely place in that constitution a 
clause which provided that in dealing 
out the death penalty the murderer 
should have a choice between bein& 
shot and being hung; and if there were 
a particle of belief in the law of God in 
the heart of the convicted murderer the 
law would give him the chance to 
choose a death whereby his blood could 
be spilt by man legally, seeing that he 
had spilt the blood of his fellow man. 
But this being the Gospel of the Lord 
Jesus, we believe in the doctrines laid

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



down by Him, and therefore we believe 
in rendering- unto Csesar that which be- 
longs to CEesar, and unto God that 
which belongs to Him. 

Last Tuesday evening's Deseret News 
contained an article that had been pub- 
lished in 1889. It was signed by the 
First Presidency of the Church, by the 
Twelve Apostles, and also by Daniel 
H. Wells and John W. Young, who 
were then acting as counselors to the 
Apostles. You will pardon me if I read 
that article. It is a declaration made 
by the leaders of the Church upon the 
subject I am speaking of. 

"That this Church views the shedding 
of human blood with the utmost abhor- 
rence. That we regard the killing of a 
human being, except in conformity with 
the civil law, as a capital crime which 
should be punished by shedding the 
blood of the criminal after a public trial 
before a legally constituted court of the 
land. 

"Notwithstanding all the stories told 
about the killing of apostates, no case 
of this kind has ever occurred, and of 
course has never been established 
against the. Church we represent. Hun- 
dreds cf seceders from the Church have 
continuously resided and now live in 
this territory, many of whom have 
amassed considerable wealth, though 
bitterly opposed to the Mormon faith 
and people. Even those who made it 
their business to fabricate the vilest 
falsehoods, and to render them plausi- 
ble by culling isolated passages from old 
sermons without the explanatory con- 
text, and have suffered no opportunity 
to escape them of villifying and black- 
ening the characters of the peop.e, have 
remained among those whom they have 
thus persistently calumniated until the 
present day, without receiving- the 
slightest personal injury. 

"We denounce as entirely untrue the 
allegation which has been made, that 
our Church favors or believes in the 
killing of persons who leave the Chuich 
or apostatize from its doctrines. We 
would view a punishment of this char- 
acter for such an act with the utmost 
horror; it is abhorrent to us and is in 
direct opposition to the fundamental 
principles of our creed. 

"The revelations of God to this 
Church make death the penalty of cay., 
tal crime, and require that offenders 
against life and property shall be de- 
livered up and tried by the laws of the 
land. 

"We declare that no Bishop's or other 
court in this Church claims or exercies 
civil or judicial functions, or the right 
to supersede, annul or modify a judg- 
ment of any civil court. Such courts, 



while established to regulate Christian 
conduct, are purely ecclesiastical, and 
their punitive powers go no further 
than the suspension or excommunica- 
tion of members from Church fellow- 
ship." 

This same thing has been proclaimed 
many times by the authorities of the 
Church since its organization; but not- 
withstanding this, an opportunity is 
never let pass by the people of the 
world, and especially the leaders of 
Christian churches, to try and bring 
this old charge up and frighten the 
people from hearing the Elders when 
they go forth to preach the Gospel of 
Jesus Christ. Not over two weeks ago 
I was asked by a man who was sup- 
posed to be intelligent, a minister of 
one of the churches, "Is it not true, if 
anyone joins your Church and then 
leaves it, that the orders of the leaders 
of the Church are that you must kill 
that man and shed his blood?" I asked 
him where he got that idea; and he 
replied, "from publications and writ- 
ings of ministers and others who have 
been in your midst." Oh! you men 
who do not believe in the "Mormon" 
Church, and who have lived here for 
years unmolested, it is your duty to 
fling these lies back into the teeth of 
the world. It is your duty to say to 
the people of the world that men who 
have gone from here and lied are not 
worthy of consideration. One minister 
in the east, who used to live in Brigham 
City, is telling stories about how not 
over six years ago women would walk 
from Salt Lake City on the railroad 
track to Brigham City, seeking pro- 
tection from him to keep their hus- 
bands from shedding their blood, under 
the doctrine of blood atonement. Well, 
my non-"Mormon" friends of Salt Lake 
City, that is placing your protective 
powers at a minimum, is it not? Shame 
on you, to make a woman walk from 
Salt Lake City to Brigham City— that 
stronghold of anti-"Mormonism" (?) — 
to ask "for protection! Yet that man 
pretends to be a minister of the Gos- 
pel. Perhaps in his lifetime he has op- 
ened the Bible; but he has forgotten 
that he read there the words of God 
which say, "Thou shalt not lie." "Thou 
shalt not bear false witness against

thy neighbor." "Why. right in Salt Lake 
City, a few years ago, one of these min- 
isters murdered two girls, cut their bod- 
ies up and burned them in the church 
furnace. He took their effects, and 
they were found in a pawnshop in 
Butte. Have the "Mormon' 'people ever 
charged that that was due to the 
teachings of the doctrine of that 
church? Have we ever borne false wit- 
ness against them in this respect? 
Has the world ever laid that horrible 
crime to the church •with which that 
minister was connected? How different 
it would have been if that had been 
one of these "Mormon" presidents of 
stakes, or a "Mormon" Bishop! What 
headlines would have been printed in 
the papers, giving an account of the 
affair; and how it would have been 
published to the world that the doc- 
trines of the "Mormon" Church were 
responsible for the murder of these two 
girls! But it was one of these good 
Christian churches here; and if that 
man had followed the doctrines of the 
church he pretended to preside over 
he never would have committed that 
murder. The "Mormon" people know 
that, and are willing to bear witness to 
it. "Why do not some members of these 
other churches say that if this young 
man in New York had been following 
the doctrines of the "Mormon" Church, 
he probably would have been in New 
York standing upon the street corners 
bearing testimony that God lives and 
that Jesus is the Christ, instead of be- 
ing locked up in a prison cell. A few 
yearg ago, in San Francisco, 
you remember, two girls were 
murdered in a church there, theii 
nude bodies being found in the tower 
of the church; and for quite a whiie 
the minister of that church was ac- 
cused in the public press of being im- 
plicated in the awful crime. But there 
was no attempt made in the press 
throughout the United States to show 
that the teachings of that church were 
responsible. They declared that it was 
the depraved condition of the criminal, 
and that all churches had good and 
"bad. How different it would have 
been if that had hapened in this Tab- 
ernacle, and the bodies of t*wo mur- 
dered girls had been found secreted 



around this organ! The world would 
have known it in twenjty-four hours, 
and it would have been charged to the 
doctrines of the "Mormon" Church. 
The Cincinnati Enquirer of Sept. 7— 
about ten days before this awful thing 
happened in New York— gave an ac- 
count of a minister belonging to the 
Baptist church. He had cut the throat 
of his wife, and was found with a razor 
in one hand and the Bible in the othei 
hand. He was reading extracts from 
the Bible on blood atonement, and he 
was crying out that without the shed- 
ding of blood there is no forgiveness; 
and he endeavored to justify his terri- 
ble crime by what he found in the 
Bible. The paper went on to say that 
he was very high in Baptist church 
councils, and that he had occupied 
some of the most prominent pulpits of 
the Baptist church in the state. But 
did they charge the deed up to the Bap- 
tist church? No! How different it 
would have been if a "Mormon" Apos- 
tle had done such a thing! They 
would not have said the poor man had 
gone crazy; but they would have said 
that he was following the instructions, 
given him by the authorities of the 
"Mormon" Church. 

I tell you they circulate some most 
infamous lies about this people, and if 
they do not repent they will be 
damned, and they will stay in that 
condition until the Lord in His mercy 
permits some "Mormon" Elder to go 
and help them out of it. I pray that 
their eyes may be opened, and that 
they may repent; and if they do not 
repent, I pray God in His mercy to 
take them away from the earth, to 
where they cannot do any more lying. 

My brethren and sisters, you can see 
that I am a little warm; but if you 
will go out in the missionary field and 
meet these things as I have met them,- 
and as every Elder meets them, you 
will at least be indignant when you 
know how the leaders of church or- 
ganizations and the newspapers 
throughout the length and breadth of 
this land are lying about your faith. I 
have been born and raised in this 
Church. I received a testimony of the 
Gospel from God, not from my father 
But my father and my mother taught 



GENERAL, CONFERENCE. 



me from infancy that in the sight of 
God murder is the most awful crime 
man can commit, and next to that is 
adultery. The way was pointed out by 
them whereby I could receive a testi- 
mony of the Gospel for myself, and I 
have listened to the whisperings of the 
still small voice, which has given me 
a testimony, so that I do know, as I 
know that the sun shines, that Joseph 
Smith was a Prophet of God. I do 
know that his successors were proph- 
ets of God, and I do know that Presi- 
dent Joseph F. Smith is the Prophet, 
Seer and Revelator of God upon the 
earth today, and that these men here 
are Apostles of the Lord Jesus Christ. 
I never received this testimony from 
my parents; I received it from God; 
and I know that when I stand before 
the judgment seat of the Almighty and 
the books are opened, this testimony 
will be recorded there for or against 
me. So that I bear my testimony in- 
telligently, knowing that I have to 
meet it, and in the name of Jesus 
Christ I say I know that this is the 
Gospel of our Lord and Savior that has 
been restored to the earth in the age 
in which we live, and that it is now 
being preached as a witness unto all 
the nations of the earth, that the end 
may come. In the name of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER J. A. McRAE, 

(President of the Colorado Mission). 

My brethren and sisters, I can say 
that I rejoice this morning in having 
the opportunity of meeting with you in 
conference. I look forward with fond 
anticipation to the time when I can 
meet here and hear the words of the 
servants of the Lord. While I am un. 
der the sound of their voices and hear 
the inspired words that come from 
them, I feel that I will never do any- 
thing wrong as long as I live. I have 
heard Elders in the mission field, while 
they have been assembled in confer- 
ence, say, "I feel now that I could go 
out and spend my whole life in preach- 
ing the Gospel." But sometimes, after 
leaving these places of worship, we for- 
get what we have heard, and we drift 
back again. Hence it is necessary for 



us to be constantly reminded of our 
duty. Our Lord and Savior Jesus 
Christ, while on earth, realized the 
necessity of preaching the Gospel unto 
His people; for He said unto His Apos- 
tles, "Feed my sheep." He realized that 
the Saints should be preached to, and 
tauglit, and reminded of their duties 
day by day. It is essential that we. 
pray constantly, that we be not led in- 
to temptation, nor do that which will 
grieve the Spirit of the Lord. 

I feel well in the Gospel. I know it i» 
the power of God unto salvation. I love 
to hear the servants of the Lord ad- 
dress us from time to time. I love to 
hear the voices of those who love the 
Gospel. I have been deiighted this 
morning in hearing the voices of my 
brethren who have spoken the prin- 
ciples of the Gospel. I have been 
made glad to hear our Prophet say 
that Zion is prospering and growing in 
the land. I can realize this myself. I 
can also realize the influence which tht 
good people of Zion have among the 
people of the world. As has been said 
many times, I know that God and one 
righteous man is a majority; and I 
know that if we will live according to 
the light which we receive from tim<» 
to time through the servants of the» 
Lord, the Elders who are in the mis- 
sion field preaching the Gospel will 
have an easier time. 

The mission over which I have the 
privilege of presiding is an extensive 
one, reaching from Canada on the 
north to Mexico on the south, from the 
Missouri river on the east to Califor- 
nia on the west, and including fivt» 
states and two territories. We haves 
laboring in that mission about 46 El- 
ders. From the first of January last 
the Elders have visited about 60,000 
houses. In making these visits I sup- 
pose it would be a fair estimate to 
say that they have preached the Gospel 
to 150,000. They have distributed 
about 40,000 tracts bearing upon the 
principles of the Gospel and telling the 
people how they travel and how they 
preach the Gospel without purse and 
scrip. They have been sent out to bear 
testimony to the divinity of the mis- 
sion of Joseph Smith the Pruphet. Dur- 
ing that time there have been distrib-

uted several hundred hooks. Many 
thousands of people have heard the 
proclamation of the Gospel, on the 
street corner and in the various halls 
in which we have held services; and 
though the baptisms have been very 
few indeed compared to the great num- 
ber who have been visited, I feel that 
much good has been done. The Spirit of 
the Lord has been with the Elders, and 
I feel that the leaven is beginning to 
work among the people. 

A few weeks ago a lady physician 
came to our office, and she said, "Mr. 
McRae, I want to talk to you for a 
short time on your method of con- 
trolling your young people. I realize 
that you have more control over your 
rising generation than any people upon 
the face of the earth. Our young peo- 
ple are slipping away from us gradual- 
ly, and falling into vice, and we can- 
not control them. How do you man- 
age?" I told her how we managed, and 
detailed to her the work done in the 
Mutual Improvement associations, the 
Primary associations, the Sunday 
schools and other institutions I told 
her about our Church schools, about 
our ward teachers visiting the people, 
and about the special missionaries that 
are called in the various wards and 
stakes to visit the young people and 
exhort them to diligence. She said, 
"Will you be kind enough to have an 
interview with one of our ministers 
and tell him how he can work along 
these lines.' " I remarked to her that 
I would willingly do so, but that I was 
afraid he could not live to it or teach 
it to his congregation. Why? she 
asked. My answer was, "He requires 
a salary to preach the Gospel. When- 
ever he arises to preach to his congre- 
gation and says that which they do not 
like, they say that he will have to stop 
preaching that way or they will stop 
his salary." "Now," said I, "when I 
preach to the people, I do not care 
whose toes I tread on; I do not carts 
who I strike; I teach the truth, and 
no matter where it hits they cannot 
come to me and say, 'We'll stop your 
salary because I haven't any to stop. 
That is the difference between your 
minister and me." That is one great 
difference between the ministers of 



the world, who are professing to 
preach the Gospel unto the people, and 
the Elders of the Lord Jesus Christ. I 
would sooner be a humble Elder 
preaching the Gospel unto the people, 
bearing testimony that Jesus is the 
Christ and that Joseph Smith is a 
Prophet of God, than to be the greatest 
"divine" upon the face of the earth. 

I pray that the Lord will bless us 
during this conference, and that He 
will inspire those who speak unto us, 
that we may be fed with the bread of 
life, that when we go from here wt 
►will form a resolution in our minds 
that we and our families will serve 
God and keep His commandments. May 
the Lord bless us to this end, is my 
prayer. Amen. 

ELDER HYRUM M. SMITH. 

Apostates sacrifice the most- -Professed ministers 
of Jesus guilty of misrepresentation — God 
will exeoute justice; the Saints' mission Is 
peace. 

I have greatly rejoiced this morning, 
brethren and sisters, in the testimony 
of those who have spoken and in hear- 
ing a report of the condition of somo 
of The missionary fields. It seems from 
the reports of the brethren that not a 
great number have given heed to the 
preaching of the Gospel of Jesus Christ 
by His servants who are endeavoring to 
save them; yet we are told that hun- 
dreds of thousands have been preached 
tu, and thus warned of the coming 
judgments of God. For my own part, 
I would rather retain faithful and firm 
ten members of the Church who are al- 
ready converted than convert one hun- 
dred out in the world. 

Brethren and sisters, I hope that in 
your hearts is burning that same testi- 
mony which has been borne by our 
brethren here today, and that it is su 
firmly established there that it will bfe 
impossible for you to ever fall from 
the Church. To apostatize from the 
Church would be your own loss. As 
has been said, no physical injury or 
harm of any other kind would come to 
you from the Church itself; but in 
leaving the faith which you have es- 
poused you would only cut yourselves 
off from the fellowship of good man 



12 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



and women, and, what is more, from 
the fellowship of God our Eternal Fath- 
er. We often hear it said that sacri- 
fice brings forth the blessings of 
heaven, and that we should make sac- 
rifices for the Gospel of Jesus Christ. 
AH this may be true, but from my 
view-point the man who cuts himsel* 
off from the Church and denies himself 
full fellowship therein is the one who 
makes the greater sacrifice; for by so 
doing he sacrifices the fellowship of the 
Spirit of the Lord and welcomes dark- 
ness rather than light; in fact, there 
is no good thing that he does not sac- 
lifice. 

With my brethren who have spoken, 
I have a testimony of the Gospel of 
Jesus Christ. I know it is true, i 
Know that every principle that has ever 
bten taught by the servants of the 
Lord, from the Prophet Joseph Smith 
till now, is true; and everyone of them 
tends to the development of mankind, 
to lift them up and make them better. 
There is no principle that is degrading 
in the least. We cannot compromise 
with the world; we cannot meet them 
h'tlf way; but we are in duty bound 
to go all the way for the purpose of 
warning them and preaching the Gospel 
as we have received it. And unless 
those who hear the Gospel accept every 
ptinciple of it they cannot become 
members of the Church of Christ. There 
is no half way business with the Lat- 
ter-day Saints. You have either to ac- 
cept every principle that has been 
taught by God Almighty or you cannot 
h^ baptized in the Church of Jesus 
Christ. We have no right to do other- 
wise. Jesus Christ taught the people 
in His day that all those who came to 
H?m must be born again; and He sent 
His Apostles forth to preach the Gospel 
to every creature, and he that believed 
and was baptized, He said should be 
saved, but he that believed not shouM 
be damned. That is the only thing we 
can do. 

Now, we have charity for the world, 
but I glory in the testimony of Brother 
Ben E. Rich. I have a sort of indig- 
nant strain in my own blood when I 
hear these falsehoods spoken against 
us by men professing to be ministers of 
Jesus Christ. An appeal was made to 



the Gentiles who live in our midst, but 
I do not expect to see any number of 
thorn, however long they have lived in 
our midst, ever stand up and be men 
enough to deny to the world the lies 
that are told about us. I do expect, 
though, that if they go away from Salt 
Lake City for a period they will enter 
into the spirit of their brothers and 
lie with them. That is the only thing 
I expect from them, especially from 
those who wear the long coats and are 
professed ministers of the Gospel. We 
might name many of them to you, but 
you know them as well as I do. 

The Latter-day Saints, from the be- 
ginning until now, have suffered from 
the misrepresentations of this class of 
men, and I expect that we will suffer 
until Christ comes to reign from just 
such men. The hand of Satan is raised 
against the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints, and he finds these 
professed ministers of the Gospel ready 
tools through which to work; and just 
so long as these conditions exist do I 
expect that these men will be employed 
in his service. Were not the Prophet 
Joseph Smith and his brother murdered 
in cold blood by a mob led on by men 
who claimed to be ministers of the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ? Did not they, 
in their piety, as the Jews of old, cry 
out, Away with this fellow? They said, 
is he not a blasphemer? Is he net 
teaching false doctrine? Is he not 
leading away our sons and daughters-: 
from the doctrines and traditions of 
their fathers? Why, if we let this man 
go on he will turn the whole world up- 
side down. Therefore, away with him, 
murder him; anything to get him out of 
the way! And did they not do it? Did 
they not partake of the same spirit 
that those who crucified the Son of 
God had? And did they not prosecute 
their devilish work even to a culmina- 
tion? Certainly they did. I feel warm, 
too, at these things; for my uncle and 
rny own grandfather were the men who 
were thus slain, and in my veins flows 
the same blood that was shed then on 
the soil of Illinois, and that still cries 
to God for vengeance. But while mv 
prayers shall ever ascend to God for 
vengeance upon those who have slain 
the prophets, anciently and today, yet

were those men brought before me and 
their guilt established beyond the pos- 
sibility of a doubt, I would say, Let 
them go and let God execute His own 
justice; and I would pray, O God, bo 
merciful to them in the justice which 
Thou dost execute, because they knew 
not what they did. If they did know, 
then oh, how worthy are they of the 
most dire punishment that God can 
give to the murderer! 

My voice shall ever be raised in de • 
fense of the Gospel of Jesus Christ and 
of the Latter-day Saints; and it shall 
e^er be raised against those who de- 
nounce us and lie about us. May God 
bless you, brethren and sisters. May 
ycu get a testimony of the Gospel for 
yourselves, so that, whatever people 
imy say or do, we will be able to en- 
dure all things, even to the very end, 
and then be saved in the kingdom of 
God. Then we will turn our attention, 
as we are now doing, to the salvation 
of those who have spoken against VL3. 
Our mission is a mission of peace, of 
salvation and of goodwill to every man 
"who will repent of his sins and turn 
unto God. To every one who will cease 
to do evil, who will cease to backbite, 
to lie and to bear false witness, will 
we give the hand of fellowship, and 
welcome him, if he repent truly, into 
the Church of Christ. But, so far as I 
am concerned, I hope I will be able to 
establish myself so firmly in the Church 
that though the whole world rise 
against us, and though it cost my life 
with the lives of my brethren, I will 
remain faithful and firm to the testi- 
mony which God has given me. May the 
spirit of testimony rest upon us ail, 
any may we indeed live near unto God 
our Eternal Father, and keep His com- 
mandments, in spite of all that may be 
s.i id or done, is my prayer in the name 
of Jesus. Amen. 

The choir and congregation sang the 
hymn which begins: 

Guide us, O Thou great Jehovah. 

Benediction by Elder Thomas E. Bas- 
sett, president of Fremont Stake. 

AFTERNOON SESSION. 

The choir and congregation sang: 

Now let us rejoice in the day of salva- 
tion. 



No longer as strangers on earth need 
we roam, 

Good tidings are sounding to us and 

each nation, 
And shortly the hour of redemption 

will come. 

Prayer was offered by Elder William 
Budge, president of Bear Lake Stake. 

Singing by the choir and congrega- 
tion: 

Come, come, ye Saints, no toil nor labor 
fear: 

But with joy wend your way. 



ELDER J. G. DUFFIN. 

(■President of Southwestern States Mis- 
sion.) 

I desire with all my heart, my breth- 
ren and sisters, that I may be led by 
the inspiration of the Spirit of God 
during the time that I shall speak to 
you this afternoon. There is one lesson, 
at least, that I have learned during my 
brief life, and it is this: no man can 
reach the hearts of the children of our 
Father in heaven, in speaking upon the 
principles of eternal life, save he is led 
by the inspiration of the Spirit of God. 
So important has our Father thought 
it to be that His servants should be 
led by that Spirit, that He has given 
commandment that they should not at- 
tempt to teach unless they knew they 
were led by His Holy Spirit. 

While the brethren have been speak- 
ing today I have thought a little about 
the opening up of this great work that 
you and I are engaged in, and of some 
questions that are presented to us when 
we go among the nations of the earth 
and bear witness unto our fellows that 
Joseph Smith is a Prophet of God, and 
that Jesus is the Christ. When we bear 
witness of this great truth revealed in 
these latter days we are frequently 
asked, "Why do you so often bear wit- 
ness that Joseph Smith is a Prophet 
of God? Do you believe that he takes 
the place of Jesus, the Sa_vior?" If we 
should answer that question dogmati- 
cally, we would say that we bear wit- 
ness to that great fact because it is 
true; but that, I take it, is not suf- 
ficient. Whenever our Father in heav- 
en has had a dispensation of the Gos- 
pel upon this earth, He has sent to 
the earth choice spirits, who had been 
foreordained in the heavens because of

their pre-existent faithfulness, through 
whom He could reveal His will, and 
upon whom He could confer the keys of 
power and authority to minister His 
word among His children upon the 
earth. The time came when the prom- 
ises of our Father were going to be ful- 
filled pertaining to His work in the last 
days. Again He sent to earth one of 
those choice spirits, who, when he came 
here, was given the name of Joseph 
Smith. Through him Father in heaven 
revealed His will again to His children, 
and to him He gave authority. Through 
that great man of God has been op- 
ened up the work of salvation for the 
living and redemption for the dead in 
this the greatest of all dispensations 
that have been given to man. I hold 
as a principle in missionary work that 
the first fact to be established before 
the people is the great truth that Jo- 
seph Smith is the man whom Father 
in heaven has raised up for this special 
purpose; for if they will not accept of 
him they will not accept the revela- 
tions of God given through him. It is 
because we believe this with all our 
hearts that in the mission over which 
your humble servant has been called to 
preside the Elders hold before the peo- 
ple first and foremost^ the great truth 
that Joseph Smith is a true Prophet 
of God. 

A few weeks ago I stood, with Presi- 
dent Andrew Kimbail, in the room in 
Carthage, Illinois, where our beloved 
Prophet and Patriarch laid down their 
lives and sealed their ieouiiwny witu 
their blood. Years before that time I 
made a vow to my Father in heaven 
that if He would give unto me His 
Holy Spirit, and courage and intelli- 
gence sufficient, I would devote my life 
to bearing witness to the world that 
He had raised up that man of God to 
establish His latter-day work. When I 
stood in that room and passed to the 
window out of which that man of God 
threw his body in order to save hia 
brethren who were yet alive, I renewed 
that vow, with tears streaming down 
my face; and I want to say to you this 
day, especially to the young brethren 
and sisters in Zion, that again I do 
renew that vow, and desire with all 
my heart that I may ever be led by that 



Spirit of God to lift up my voice and 
bear witness that that great man who 
there gave his life is a Prophet of God, 
and that his testimony, sealed by his 
blood, lives today and will live in the 
hearts of the children of men. 

In the Southwestern States Mission 
this fact is second only to the great 
truth that Jesus is the Christ. In that 
mission we are doing the work of our 
Father in heaven as He gives us ability 
to do it. "We have about 120 Elders la- 
boring there, and have had two of the 
beautiful, intelligent daughters of Zion, 
but one has recently returned from 
filling a faithful mission and is now in 
this building; the other is still there, 
doing good, efficient work. "We hope to 
have others of the daughters of Zion 
sent to us to assist in the work. Breth- 
ren and sisters, your sons who are there 
are full of courage and zeal. Your 
daughters who have been and are there 
are filled with the same spirit of devo- 
tion and courage. I bear witness this 
day, with regard to the work of our 
young sisters, that when they stand 
before the people of the world and bear 
testimony that Jesus is the Christ, that 
Joseph Smith is a Prophet of God, and 
that Father has again spoken from 
the heavens, it goes to the hearts of 
the people, and they cannot resist the 
humble testimony of our beloved sis- 
ters. 

I would like to say a word with re- 
gard to writing to your sons. Never al- 
low one line of discouragement to go 
from you to them. Never put a thought 
in their minds that they should return 
home until the men whom God has 
chosen to direct His work are moved 
upon by the Spirit of God to release 
them from their missionary labors. Why 
do I say this? Because we have had 
occasion sometimes to know that the 
work of the Lord has suffered by rea- 
son of our young men being taken from 
the field before they ought to retu %\, 
and they themselves have suffered most 
in consequence of it. I know the pres- 
idents of missions are careful of the 
young men. They are considerate of 
your sons. They love them as they love 
their owns sons. They would lay down 
their lives for your boys, and they are 
not going to permit them to do that

which would be for their detriment, if 
they can help it. 

The work of the Lord in that mission 
is progressing- reasonably well. Our El- 
ders are treated well by the people. It 
is a rare exception where they meet 
mob violence. We have only had one 
case of extreme mob violence in about 
three years, and that was in a part of a 
state that has always exhibited a rank 
spirit towards the work of God; but 
even in that state the governor is a 
friend to the people of the Lord, as are 
some of the judges. I have talked with 
leading men in that state, and they 
have said to me, "Mr. Duffin, I want to 
say to you that the better element in 
this state, the men of thought and prog- 
ress, are not bitterly opposed to your 
people, but are friendly towards you." 
That is the spirit which prevails gen- 
erally among the intelligent and think- 
ing classes of the people throughout the 
Southwestern States Mission. There is 
one exception to this rule, and that is 
among those who pretend to be follow- 
ers of the meek and lowly Nazarene. 
From that class of people come the bit- 
terest statements and opposition that 
we have to meet. A few weeks ago we 
held a conference of the Missouri El- 
ders in Kansas City. The leading news- 
papers there treated us nicely, and gave 
fair accounts of the conference. They 
sent their reporters to our meetings, 
and they advertised us free of charge 
before the conference began. This 
stirred up the anger of some of these 
men who pretend to be followers of the 
meek and lowly Nazarene and they 
gave us a little more advertising in 
their Sunday night sermons. As soon 
as the reporters got those sermons 
they came right to our office and want- 
ed to know whether the ministers' 
statements were true or not. They 
said they wanted to treat us fairly and 
get our side of the question, and they 
reported pretty fairly what we said in 
reply to the attack of those men who 
are not following the Savior, though 
they pretend to be. President Rich said 
he sometimes got warm in talking 
about these men and thinking how they 
treated our young men who are full of 
faith and zeal and who are doing a 
work of unselfishness among man- 
kind. I do not suppose there is a presi- 



dent of a mission anywhere but gets 
angry sometimes at this, and righteous- 
ly, too. 

Brethren and sisters, we reported last 
spring that we had issued a ten thou- 
sand edition of the Book of Mormon in 
that mission. Since last May we have 
distributed nearly seven thousand cop- 
ies of that sacred book, to various mis- 
sions and throughout the country; and 
it is now going out by the thousands 
where formerly it was distributed by 
the hundreds. It is down to a price 
that can be reached by the people. Since 
I have been a student of this great lat- 
ter-day work I have always held that 
if we must speculate out of any books, 
it should not be out of the Book of 
Mormon; for when the angel delivered 
the plates to the Prophet Joseph Smith 
he warned him against using them for 
the purpose of getting gain. I believe 
that same principle should obtain in 
the publishing and distribution of the 
book. We have acted upon that prin- 
ciple in contributing of our means in 
this direction. Your sons have given 
of their means to put this book at such 
a price that the people could reach it. 

I pray, my brethren and sisters, that 
the Spirit of the Lord may be in the 
heart of everyone who attends this con- 
ference, and in the heart of every mem- 
ber of the Church, and that it may go 
forth among the nations of the earth 
and enter into the hearts of the people 
and open them to the reception of the 
eternal truths of heaven that have been 
revealed in this dispensation. I want 
to bear you my witness this day that I 
know that Joseph Smith is a prophet of 
God. I know that Brigham Young is a 
Prophet of God. I know that these tes- 
timonies are being borne among the na- 
tions by our young men. I know that 
our beloved brother who sits on this 
stand today— Joseph F. Smith— is a 

true and a living Prophet of God, and 
that he holds the keys of the kingdom 
in the day in which he lives. God bless 

you. Amen. 

ELDER ASAHEL WOODRUFF. 

(President of the Northern States 
Mission.) 

My brethren and sisters, while stand- 
ing before you upon this occasion I 



16 



GENERAL, CONFERENCE. 



earnestly desire an interest in your 
faith and prayers,- that I may be 
clothed upon with the Spirit of the 
Lord, to enable me to report truthful- 
ly the conditions which prevail in the 
Northern States Mission. We have 
heard today reports from that portion 
of the country that is washed by the 
waters of the Pacific, and from por- 
tions washed by the Atlantic and the 
great Gulf as well as from 
the great interior country em- 
braced within the Colorado Mis- 
sion. It is my privilege to re- 
port that part of the country which 
may be called the district of the great 
lakes. Of late years the Northern 
States Mission has been shorn of some 
of the outlying States which were 
formerly part of it. The State of 
Missouri was given to the Southwest- 
ern States Misson, the States of Kan- 
sas and North and South Da- 
kota were added to the Colo- 
rado Mission, and Ohio to the 
Southern States Mission. At the pres- 
ent time the Northern States Mission 
is very compact, the city of Chicago 
being almost centrally located, geo- 
graphically. There are six states em- 
braced in the mission, viz.: the state 
of Michigan (which in the early rise 
of the work furnished many splendid 
converts to the Church), the state of 
Indiana, the state of Illinois (whose 
soil drank in the blood of the Prophets 
that were slain for the testimony 
which they bore, and within whose 
borders are many points of historical 
interest connected with the Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints), 
the state of Iowa (into whose wilder- 
ness the band of pilgrims made their 
way when they commenced that great 
exodus in the summer of 1846), the state 
of Wisconsin (which furnished the "ce- 
dars of Lebanon" for the beautiful tem- 
ple at Nauvoo), and the great and beau- 
tiful state of Minnesota, with its more 
than ten thousand lakes, including 
Itasca, which gives birth to the great 
Father of Waters— the Mississippi riv- 
er. We have about 100 Elders laboring 
in that mission at the present time. 

Our work has been somewhat ham- 
pered the last few months, during 
which time it has been my privilege to 



preside over that part of the Lord's 
vineyard, owing to many of the Elders 
having to be released, and a large num- 
ber of fresh ones sent into the field. 
I will say, however, that, notwithstand- 
ing the great majority of our force are 
young men, they are laboring assidu- 
ously, conscientiously and diligently 
to spread the work of the Lord in that 
part of the world, and their efforts are 
being met with reasonable success, 
though in point of baptisms the suc- 
cess is not as encouraging as we could 
wish. During the past eight months 
about 80,000 tracts have been distribut- 
ed, and practically the same number of 
families have been visited, and 25,000 
revisited; 2,500 meetings have been held, 
among this number being about 1,000 
street meetings. I do not know that we 
can trace any conversions directly to 
our efforts upon the streets, but it has 
allayed a great deal of prejudice and 
has warned the people of the impending 
judgments which God designs to pour 
out upon the world. We have also seen 
this beneficial effect resulting from our 
street meetings: in districts where 
they have been held, the Elders have 
received a more cordial welcome at 
the homes of the people in their tract- 
ing. We have in the mission three 
Young Ladies' associations, one Young 
Men's association, and seven Sunday 
schools, all of which are doing effective 
work. Among those who have identi- 
fied themselves with the work in these 
states we have some good, honest souls, 
who are thoroughly converted to all the 
principles of the Gospel promulgated by 
the Elders, and who have paid their 
tithes with care and precision. Many 
of our converts are employed in the 
factories and stores, and they will come 
religiously each Sabbath day and pay 
one-tenth of their earnings, thereby 
setting a commendable example to 
many of our people at home. 

The spirit of gathering seems to take 
possession of the people almost as soon 
as they embrace the Gospel, and it is 
hard to restrain them from carrying 
out their desires in this matter. This 
tendency weakens our branches to a 
great extent, and we try to discourage 
it as far as possible, advising the peo- 
ple, in preference to gathering and

leaving employment which they have 
and going where they will perhaps find 
it difficult to get suitable employment, 
to make a brief trip to Zion and at- 
tend to their work in the Temple of 
the Lord, which is the great incentive 
for them to gather with the people. 

I believe that, aside from the work 
of the conversion of people in the 
world, one of the great features of mis- 
sionary work is the conversion of the 
corps of Elders who are constantly 
traveling throughout the nations of the 
earth. Missionary work is one of the 
best educators that a young man could 
possibly have. It gives that practi- 
cal education which fits them for the 
battle of life. It has been contended 
by people who are not of our faith that 
the young Latter-day Saints who 
show a disposition to follow in the 
footsteps of their fathers do so because 
they have inherited their prejudices. 
They look upon it as a case of the blind 
following the blind, and the ignorant 
following those who are still more ig- 
norant. They say that the solution of 
this trouble is greater light, greater 
knowledge, and opportunity for the 
young men to come in contact with the 
purer (?) state of society which ex- 
ists outside of Utah. That is largely 
the contention of the people who are 
opposed to our faith, notwithstanding 
the great amount of evidence which 
time is continually accumulating to 
show the plan to be a rank failure. 
The young men of our Church do go out 
Into the world, with very limited 
knowledge or experience, perhaps with 
no certain knowledge of the divinity 
of those principles which they have 
embraced, except that which comes 
through a consciousness of the honest, 
probity and truthfulness of their par- 
ents who believe in the Gospel. They 
go forth into the world, which has 
grown rank with conflicting notions and 
Ideas, and they are compelled to raise 
their hand against every creed, because 
every creed lifts its head against them. 
Surely this is a condition the most 
lavorable that could be desired to erad- 
icate from their young minds whatever 
respect they might have for the faith 
-of their fathers, if anything could do 
ao; and yet the leaders of the Church 



and the fathers and mothers of the 
young men all unite in urging them to 
take the very step which our enemies 
declare will be the means of eradicat- 
ing from their minds whatever belief 
they have in the faith of their fathers. 
We see these young men by the hun- 
dreds taking the advice which comes 
from such opposite elements. They go 
out into the world, remaining there 
from 18 months to 3 years or more, and 
in 999 cases out of 1,000 they return 
with a firm conviction of the truth, the 
purity and the unsurpassing reason- 
ableness of the Gospel. There might 
not be anything remarkable about an 
occasional conversion among these 
young men to a faith that had long 
been professed by them, though per- 
haps but little understood; but almost 
without exception these young men re- 
turn with a strong personal testimony 
of the truth which their fathers have 
espoused. 

There are many ways in which mis- 
sionary experience is of great value 
to those who engage in it. It gives 
them a breadth of charity and consid- 
eration for their fellow creatures 
which cannot be obtained in any other 
Way. It gives them an insight into 
the hopes, the aspirations and the con- 
ditions that exist in the world. It 
gives them a broader understanding 
of our Father's purposes in connection 
with the placing of His children here 
upon the earth. It also develops with- 
in them that quality which is declared 
by all people to be one of the cardin- 
al virtues— unselfishness. The very fact 
of their being willing to sacrifice home, 
friends, and all that is near and dear 
to them, for a period, and go forth to 
suffer the scorn, the contumely, the 
hatred and the rebuffs of the world 
which they have to meet, is an evidence 
of their sincerity and their unselfish- 
ness. This gathering of people from 
all parts of the world, and this send- 
ing forth of our Elders to every na- 
tion under heaven, by which they be- 
come acquainted with the conditions 
that exist in the world, and then their 
returning home with the experience 
which they have acquired, is filling this 
state and surrounding states with men 
possessed of a knowledge of the world

that cannot be found in any other com- 
munity on the earth. I believe that this 
continued will be the means of estab- 
lishing here the greatest, the purest 
and the most progressive people upon 
the face of the earth. 

My testimony is that this work is 
true, that Joseph Smith was a divine 
instrument in the hands of the Al- 
mighty of establishing His work in the 
last days upon the earth, and that be 
did his work nobly and well; that he 
was succeeded by spirits which had 
been held in reserve tc come forth in 
this important dispensation, to continue 
the work and to build upon the found- 
ation laid by the Prophet Joseph; thst 
a prophet of God still stands at the 
head of this Church, and that He will 
continue to place prophets at our head 
to receive His will and deliver it unto 
the people. I pray that God will help 
us to work out our salvation with fear 
and trembling, and to be true and loy- 
al to the Priesthood, to God, to our 
friends and to ourselves, and to be 
counted worthy to be numbered among 
the jewels of our Father when He shall 
come to make them up. I ask these 
blessings in the name of the Lord Je- 
sus. Amen. 

ELDER NEPHI PRATT, 

(President of Northwestern States Mis- 
sion.) 

I feel thankful to God for the bless- 
ings that we have received tnis day by 
the inspiration of the Holy Spirit in 
listening to the inspired remarks of the 
brethren who have spoken. To come 
from the missionary field and look upon 
the faces of the Saints and hear the 
voice of inspiration from the mouths 
of the prophets, is a great privilege. It 
is greatly enjoyed by those who from 
day to day and from month to month 
go through the great cities of our land 
and seldom look upon a friendly face. 

The Northwestern States Mission, over 
which I have been called to preside, is 
a small mission in some respects. It 
consists of the State of Washington, 
British Columbia, Montana, and a part 
of Idaho. I took the presidency of that 
mission and started my labors on the 
14th of May last. I found about twenty 



great cities in the mission, and many 
large towns, and there were only eight 
Elders. They were so few and so inex- 
perienced that it seemed when I ar- 
rived there like we had nothing to work 
with. But we commenced a little more 
systematically than the Elders had been 
doing, and we started to hold street 
meetings in Spokane, and in Butte, 
where they had almost given up the 
work. In our preaching instead of 
speaking so much upon faith, repent- 
ance and baptism, as we have in years 
past, we were led to preach upon the 
divinity of the mission of Joseph Smith, 
and upon the fact that God had once 
again uttered His voice from the heav- 
ens, and that He had sent forth divine- 
ly-authorized servants into the great 
field of the world to warn the people- 
of the judgments of God that are com- 
ing upon the earth; for the people of 
Washington and Montana are so utter- 
ly indifferent to the Bible and its con- 
tents that those whom the Elders can 
reach seem to have no interest in those 
things. We cannot reach the family 
people, who make up the church-going 
members in the various cities where we- 
labor; for they reject us, shut us out, 
and will not have us. When we Dreach 
on the streets our tongues are loosed 
upon the subject of the coming of the 
Son of God and the signs that were to 
precede it, and we are led to proclaim 
that this people are the ones that are 
doing this great and marvelous work. 
We have also been able, by the power 
and inspiration of the Holy Ghost, to 
defend the Prophet Brigham Young, 
and to show up the majesty and the 
greatness that rested upon him in es- 
tablishing the Latter-day Saints in this 
place, where in the beginning, when we- 
looked down at the earth, it was like 
an ash-heap, and when we looked at the 
heavens, the sun's scorching rays came 
down upon our unprotected heads with- 
out pity. We did not know anything 
about irrigation, and we could not tell, 
if we dropped the seed in the soil, 
whether it would ever grow. We have 
told the people that in the midst of 
these difficulties, so huge and so appall- 
ing, there was one potent voice — the- 
voice of Brigham Young, who, sticking 
his cane in the soil, said, "Here shall 



ELDER NEPHI PRATT. 



19 



be erected the Temple of our God;" and 
there was one voice that could say, 
"Here shall be builded a great city." 
We have testified to this, and to what 
it has done for the people of the west; 
and when we have defended the proph- 
ets and declared these things, we have 
been received royally, and our hearts 
have been made to rejoice when we 
went on the streets without fear and 
trembling. 

In the mission we now have 15 Elders 
in all, a few of whom are in Spokane, 
a few in Butte, and a couple in Ana- 
conda. "Western men do not threaten to 
mob us. They seem \o feel above it. 
When we have been attacked on the 
streets by some wicked or quarrelsome 
person, we have found that we had de- 
fenders, who rose up and spoke well of 
us; while some have bx>rne testimony 
to the greatness of the men that set- 
tled this country and made it possible 
to settle the other countries west of 
here. We have three branches of the 
Church — one in Butte, one in Anaconda, 
and one just established in Spokane 
with 22 members. In the five months I 
have been there we have baptized 17. 
We have Sunday schools in two of our 
branches, and expect to establish one 
in Spokane next Sunday or the Sunday 
following. In Spokane we have to hold 
our Sabbath meetings in our private 
residence, and we are beginning to have 
it crowded each Sunday, with tts many 
strangers as Saints. Our Elders are 
young men, without any training in 
singing. You ought to go out on the 
streets and see how lamentable it is to 
call what we do singing. Men that 
cannot carry a tune, to save their lives; 
but, like Brother Grant, they are per- 
severing, and we are getting so that we 
sometimes sing in harmony, if the Spirit 
of the Lord rests upon us. If I were 
to speak my mind, I would say to the 
rising generation of men who expect to 
fulfill missions in this Church, learn to 
become good singers; learn to sing in 
parts, so that you can form singing 
clubs. When you go into the missionary 
field it will help you greatly, and it will 
open doors to you that will not be 
opened if you do not possess that gift. 

Brethren and sisters, in our mission 
we have not been able to set the world 



on fire by any means. I never saw 
such indifference as there seems to be 
there. Men do not want you to speak 
the word "religion" in their hearing. 
They have their business to attend to, 
and they won't talk religion. There is 
only one here and there that cares to 
speak upon the principles of the Gospel. 
But we have considerable opposition 
there from the ministers, and from 
some apostates that have been spewed 
out of the mouth of the Lord. They 
get into our street meetings and begin 
to abuse the prophets and find fault 
with us and the word of God; but we 
ignore them. We will not contend with 
them, and they are getting so that they 
have no following, a nd I am glad of it. 
In the cities where we preach on the 
streets, we have good crowds to hear 
us, and some of them are quite intelli- 
gent and attentive; but they are not 
made up of men who care anything 
about it after we are through. Some 
of them will come and bear testimony 
to the excellent character of our people, 
and that is all. We have a number of 
scattered Saints there, among them 
some young people, and they are hoping 
that some day they may come where 
they can get good companions and mar- 
ry. They are holding themselves from 
the company of the wicked, trusting 
that in the future they may have the 
blessing of becoming united with the 
righteous. They are mixed up with the 
sectarians, and we cannot hold meet- 
ings with them. The best we can do ia 
to send an Elder among them occasion- 
ally, and then very often they cannot 
get a schoolhouse to meet in. But we 
feel blessed and encouraged. We have 
the still small voice up there, and re- 
ceive of the inspiration of the Holy 
Ghost. We feel to bless the name of 
the Lord who gave us that mission, and 
to proclaim His Gospel. We would be 
discouraged, did we not know that it ia 
His work, a nd not ours. 

One evening, on the streets of Butte, 
we met a minister, who got up a new 
argument against us. We had been 
preaching that a church without apos- 
tles and prophets, pastors and teachers, 
called by divine revelation from God, 
was not the body of Christ; that a 
church which did not have these offi- 



20 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



cers was a thing without parts, with- 
out limbs, without eyes, and that a 
church without the Holy Ghost was 
dead. This man said that he wanted to 
tell the people that we were a deform- 
ity. He had studied Mormonism seven 
months, and he said the Mormons be- 
lieved in a great many things that were 
not in the New Testament. He went 
on to say that we believe in three Pres- 
idents to preside over the church, and 
there was no such thing establishd by 
Jesus; we believed in High Priests, and 
there had been no High Priests in the 
Church in the days of Jesus; we be- 
lieved in Patriarchs, and there was no 
such thing as Patriarchs provided for 
in the New Testament days. He con- 
tinued, "If we are a body that is dead, 
without limbs or eyes, what are they? 
Are they not a body with three ears, 
and four arms, and eight legs?" And 
he called us a deformity. "Well, the peo- 
ple did not receive him very well, and 
the answer of the young Elder to his 
remarks was so overwhelming against 
him that he departed very quickly. We 
have been blessed and prospered, and it 
has not been possible for whatever in- 
telligence has been brought against the 
work of God to bring it into shame or 
humiliation. I will tell you what we 
need in that mission. We need 80 El- 
ders. But they are giving us mission- 
aries just as fast as they can spare 
them, and we are thankful for them. 

I ask God the Eternal Father to bless 
this work, to promote its interest every- 
where, to bless the missions and the 
mission presidents, with all the mission- 
ary Elders, to bless the Presidency of 
the Church and all the interests of this 
people everywhere. I ask God to bless 
them all, and to plant our feet wher- 
ever we are colonized, that our influence 
may be felt, and that we may exhibit 
those qualities of salvation that shall 
attract men to us. I ask it in the name 
of Jesus. Amen.

Friendly manifestations where persecution ex- 
isted before— Favorable time to preaoh the 
Gospel — Liberal-minded listen respectfully, 
but few yield obedience— Talents should be 
used for the blessing of all. 

My brethren and sisters, it is a 
matter of pleasure to me to be with 



you in attendance upon this confer- 
ence, and to have listened to the wor Is 
which have been spoken by our breth- 
ren who have been in the missionary 
fie-d, seeking to sow the seeds of the 
Gospel and to discharge that obligation 
required at the hands of those that are 
warned, namely, that they shall warn 
their neighbors. The brethren ha\e 
given us in brief some of their experi- 
ences in connection with the work that 
has been assigned unto them. It has 
been my privilege in the past few weeks 
to have ha,d some little opportunity of 
mingling with the people in several 
states of the Union, and noting condi- 
tions under which the Elders are labor- 
ing in some of the fields to which they 
have been appointed by the presiding 
authority of the Church. My own ex- 
perience while away from home in the 
discharge of a duty that had fallen to 
my lot, was among the pleasurable ones 
of my life. In an absence from home 
of something like four weeks, I do not 
know that in the entire time, although 
I mingled with a great many, I had 
one wry face made at me because I 
happened to be a "Mormon." I do not 
know that any of our brethren who 
were with me were subjected to any 
evidence of disrespect, or that any ex- 
pressions of animosity were in any way 
directed against the organization of 
which we are members. We received 
the most thoughtful treatment, and in 
the discharge of the duties that were 
incumbent upon us were enabled, I be- 
lieve, to impress upon the minds of 
seme of our fellowmen a higher regard 
and a better understanding of our pur- 
pose than they possibly had before. 

Among the most pleasing experiences 
through which it was my privilege to 
pass in connection with other brethren, 
was one such as stated by Presidert 
Duffin as having occurred in his ex- 
perience, and that was in the payment 
of a visit to Hancock county, Illinois, 
and to receive very kindly consideration 
from many of the old-time citizens ot 
that county. Their expressions were 
of the most friendly character, and 
many of them absolutely and uncondi- 
tionally declared that Hancock county 
today was "Jack-Mormon," and not 
9nti-"Mormon," and they expressed a

wish that it were possible for the Saint i 
t<- again establish themselves upon 
that land and build up again, by their 
thrift and industry, the towns that 
had withered after the removal of the 
Saints. The sentiment that we found 
among many of these men and women 
was to me an evidence of a working 
change in the breasts of the people; 
and I am of the opinion that the op- 
portunities for extending the Gospel fn 
cur own nation are better today than 
they have ever been since the Saints 
left their homes in the east and estab- 
lished themselves in the valleys of the 
mountains. "While there are some men 
who are given to misrepresenting our 
character, and the press of the coun- 
try in many instances take up very 
readily anything that will reflect upon 
and in a measure retard the progress of 
the latter-day work, the constant travel 
of the better elements of the people of 
the United States is having the effect 
to wear away and disprove the false 
st\tements that have been heralded 
broadcast in times that are past and 
gone, and the possibility of arousing a 
spirit of hatred and animosity again.it 
u.<? is not so marked as formerly. There 
are large bodies of fair-minded, hon- 
orable men and women in all parts o* 
the land, and while they may not be as 
aggressive in their spirit as the enemies 
of the Saints are, they are ready to 
give aid and comfort to the Elders of 
the Church in the performance of their 
part, and to defend them if necessary. 

I feel that no better time has existed 
for us to fulfill that great responsibility 
of preaching the Gospel and warning 
the world than exists at the present 
time. Our contact with men in bust - 
noss, our association with them in the 
variety of congresses and conventions 
that are held in the various parts of 
the nation, has awakened in the breasts 
of many thoughtful and prudent men 
mcst serious thoughts in connection 
with our ministry. The large bodies 
of men who attend these cattle conven- 
tions, irrigation congresses, good roads 
congresses, Trans-Mississippi con- 
gresses and other representative gath- 
erings at which our brethren and other 
-rieri from our state have been present, 
have accomplished wonders in chang- 



ing the spirit of the thoughtful and 
fa?rminded of our land. One man who 
has figured most conspicuously in al- 
most all of these congresses, and who 
is eminent in one of our territories, in 
a published expression over his own 
signature, recently made the statement 
that if nothing else had been accom- 
plished by these conventions and con- 
gresses in this western country than 
the obtaining of a better understanding 
of "Mormonism" and its purpose in the 
world, that alone has amply repaid the 
p-ople of the Trans-Mississippi country 
for the establishment of these gather- 
ings. Coming from such a man,' who is 
equipped, by the education and train- 
ing of his life, to discharge fully and 
thoroughly almost any part that might 
be required at his hands, after an ex- 
tended acquaintance with the men who 
h?ive gone from our state to these vari- 
ous gatherings, that statement is a wit- 
ness to me of an advance in the line of 
thought and in the opening up to the 
fairminded and generous American peo- 
ple a way to allay the intense excite- 
ment that in the past has been awak- 
ened against us because of a lack of 
understanding with regard to our pui- 
pose. 

I believe this is true, not only within 
the confines of our own great govern- 
ment, but also beyond our borders in 
the great south land and in the lands 
to the north of us. While many men 
are not inclined to express themselves 
vipon the question of our religion, yet 
th« justice engendered in their hearts 
as a result of their mingling with the 
people has broken in pieces many of 
the idols of the past, and has destroy- 
ed, in a great measure, the work of 
the illiberal and smallminded, too many 
of whom are found in the ranks of the 
clergymen, so lacking in that breadth 
and understanding of the principles of 
the government under which we live 
that their constant clamorings are di- 
rected to the hurt of their fellowmen. 
But even among the ministers there are 
men of broad minds, of big hearts and 
generous purposes. While they are not 
believers with us in the doctrines of the 
Gospel as restored through the admin- 
istrations of the prophets in this dis- 
pensation, still they recognize the fact 



22 



GENERAL, CONFERENCE. 



that in the exercise of their rights and 
in the fulfillment of their mission they 
cannot regard with respect those that 
would trample upon them in the exer- 
cise of their rights, and they concede 
to their fellowmen the same privileges 
that they desire for themselves. All 
such men, whether they be without 
faith, whether they are acceptors of the 
doctrines of the Protestant world, or 
believers in Judaism, or members of 
that great organization known as the 
Catholic church, wherever they may be 
found they are among the protectors 
and preservers of the liberties of man 
and those human rights guaranteed un- 
to us by the Constitution of the United 
States. To these men, whose hearts 
are big, and whose education is in 
keeping with the character of the gov- 
ernment which the Almighty has per- 
mitted to be established in this day, we 
may turn our faces with a degree of 
safety. But when it comes to those 
whose souls are narrowed down to the 
acceptance of the idea that their pray- 
ers can simply ascend in the interest of 
their own little circle, and that liberty 
can only be permitted to be enjoyed 
by the members of that circle, senti- 
ments such as they possess, and which 
find expression in a desire to interfere 
with the conscience of their fellowmen 
will, I trust, gradually decrease in in- 
fluence and power until beneath the 
flag of the United States, no human 
being can be called in question as to 
the character of his faith, whether he 
worship Mohammed or whether he ac • 
cepts the doctrines and views presented 
to the world by the great Christian or- 
ganizations that are proclaiming Christ 
and His ministry in the world. 

The promise to us in the introduc- 
lion of this work was not that it should 
ever become a popular system in the 
minds of mankind. The promise made 
was that it should gather one 
of a city and two of a family. 
Up to the present moment, take the 
statements of the men who are 
in the mission fields of this great coun- 
try, and there has been no declaration 
that the work which the Almighty has 
established in this day has become pop- 
ular among the people. A few receive 
their message; a few have adm'ni«tered 



unto them the ordinance of baptism: a 
few aid them in the accomplishment of 
their work by providing for their wants, 
or by preserving them from the at- 
tacks of mobs or unwise and thought- 
less people. The work began with a 
few; it probably will continue for some 
time with a few. But its destiny and 
mission will be accomplished upon the 
basis designated by our heavenly 
Father. The one of a city and the two 
of a family will be gathered, will be 
nurtured in harmony with our Father's 
purposes, and in due time the work will 
be established in its fullness and be- 
come indeed the joy of the whole earth. 
It will not come with a rush; it will not 
come by great popular demonstrations; 
it will not come as a result of any 
great eloquence or skill or power that 
we may possess; it will come through 
the operations of the still small voice 
bearing witness to the hearts of the 
few, until step by step and stage by 
stage the children of our God will be 
assimilated and brought into harmony 
with the principles of His. truth; for it 
is destined to accomplish its work and 
bring about our Father's purpose. "We 
note the conditions that grew up in 
the ages past, when the Christian re- 
ligion became a popular religion; when 
the Christianity of the Redeemer was 
lost or buried in the paganism that 
surrounded it, and when the ordinances 
of God's house, with the keys, rights, 
authorities and blessings, were lost in 
the philosophy and wickedness of that 
day. 

My brothers and my sisters, before us 
is this entire world. Our Father has 
given it to us as our field. From its 
islands and from its continents, from 
its mountains and from its valleys we 
are to gather together the children of 
our Father, indoctrinate them in an 
understanding of the principle of reve- 
lation, write upon their hearts the 
characteristics of the prophecies of 
old, and engender in their minds the 
understanding that as prophecy and 
revelation were requisite in that form- 
er day, so they, in this day, who would 
be in communion with our heavenly 
Father must seek to obtain that self- 
same spirit and drink in of that reve- 
lation and prophecy that stall bring

"to the souls of men a complete compre- 
hension of our Father's purposes in 
connection with His great family. To 
this end the seeds will have to be sown, 
gradually but surely, that little by little 
the lump may be assimilated, the condi- 
tions may be shaped, the hearts of 
God's children may be brought to the 
proper understanding, and that upon 
their souls shall be written, by the im- 
press of His Spirit, the truth of His 
work that shall lead them to obey it 
and do His bidding. 

There are many things we have to do 
in connection with the development of 
our Father's work that probably in our 
experience are very trying to us; but we 
look back over the past, as we remem- 
ber the conditions that surrounded us 
in the state of Illinois, or in the state 
of Ohio, or in the state of Missouri, 
and we note the changes that have 
been wrought in our establishment in 
this mountain home, we must glorify 
our Father's name that He utilized 
means to push us into the valleys of 
these mountains, and equip us by the 
education that we have received for the 
accomplishment of that great work 
which He has set us to do. There was 
no escape from this. It has come to us 
in the accomplishment of His purpose, 
and His purpose is the gradual regen- 
eration of His children and the estab- 
lishment in all the world of the truth 
of that message which God the Father 
and His Son Jesus Christ made known 
to the Prophet of this dispensation, and 
to which our brethren have borne tes- 
timony this day and become witnesses 
of the ministry and mission of the chos- 
en ones designated to scatter this seed 
and bring to repentance the sons and 
•daughters of God. At jio time in the 
world's history has there ever been 
made so wonderful an accomplishment 
in the sowing of seed and in the dis- 
semination of principle such as was 
made in the life ministry of the Proph- 
et Joseph Smith. In almost every 
church we hear sung songs of the lat- 
ter-day Zion. We hear them clamoring 
in many sections of our country for in- 
formation bearing upon many princi- 
ples in which we believe, and we note 
that the thoughtful and prudent men of 
the land.as well as of other parts of this 



continent upon which we live, desire 
our association and companionship, that 
the labors of our organization may be 
brought to bear to change the condi- 
tions in their sections of country and 
open the door that more of our Father's 
children may be successful in securing 
to themselves the blessings and com- 
forts of life. 

I recognize the fact, my brethren and 
sisters, that it is not prudent In me to 
speak to you longer; but with my asso- 
ciates who have spoken to you this day 
I desire to bear my testimony to the 
truth of this Gospel. I desire to say to 
you practical and thoughtful men 
among the Latter-day Saints that our 
Father expects you to utilize the tal- 
ents that you possess in the creation ol 
industries, in the providing of work, in 
aiding every child that shall receive ot 
that faith which the Almighty has giv- 
en unto you, that he may secure for 
himself a home, that he may be indoc- 
trinated in the principles of eternal 
truth, and that all our talents may be 
utilized for the spiritual and tempora' 
blessing of every one of our Father's 
children to the uttermost limit of ou' 
capacity. That which we have em- 
braced came from a divine source. It' 
mission is a mission of regeneration. It 
moves forward in the accomplishmenf 
of its destiny. Nothing in the world 
can stay its progress. That declaration 
that "no weapon that is formed against 
thee shall prosper; and every tongue 
that shall rise against thee in judgment 
thou shalt condemn," will operate in 
the future as it has in the past. Ail 
honor to the honorable, upright and 
generous men of this world who stand 
upon the basis of fair-dealing among 
their fellows, and all dishonor to the 
narrowminded, illiberal and ungener- 
ous men of the world whose hearts and 
minds are not broad enough to register 
aright the rights that they themselves 
enjoy and that the rights of their fel- 
lows should be sacred in every sense of 
the word! 

May the blessings of God attend you. 
May the faith that was delivered to the 
prophets of this dispensation And its 
lodgment in your hearts and homes. 
May you be stalwarts among men in 
the defense of human liberty and in

the blessing of every creature. May you 
impress upon the souls of your sons 
and daughters that sacred regard for 
human rights that no human being 
with your consent should be denied the 
exercise of his conscience, so long as ne 
does not interfere with the rights or 
liberties of any other human being; and 
that this principle and spirit may grow 



and garnish your lives and enable you 
to fulfill your destiny, under the bless- 
ing of our God, is my prayer, in the 
name of Jesus. Amen.

ELDER REED SMOOT. 

Striking evidence of friendship — Payment of fast 
offerings for the poor— Necessity for avoid- 
ance of debt. 

My dear brothers and sisters, it is in- 
deed an inspiring sight this Sabbath 
morning to see this building so well 
filled with people who have come to 
hear the word of the Lord. I am thank- 
ful for the privilege of speaking this 
morning and bearing my humble testi- 
mony to the work of the Lord Jesus 
Christ that has been established in 
these last days. I am thankful that I 
am in harmony with the Presidency of 
this Church, and with the members of 
the quorum of< the Twelve. I hope I am 
in harmony with every Latter-day 
Saint. 

If I had been called upon to speak 
yesterday, I felt in my soul that I would 
liked to have spoken upon the subject 
that is causing so much comment in 
the newspapers of the United States— 
the subject of blood atonement; but as 
Brother Ben E. Rich spoke upon it and 
explained to a certain extent the posi- 



tion of our Church in reference to it, I 
will be content in saying that I endorse 
every word uttered by him on that 
point, and I ask every Latter-day 
Saint to read his remarks. I was proud 
of all the men who spoke here yester- 
day, and who bore their testimonies to 
the work of God. I noticed that the 
most of them were young men, born in 
the church of Jesus Christ, and of 
parents who had suffered the hardships 
of the early days, and I was delighted 
with all of them for the testimonies 
which they bore that Jesus was the 
Christ and that this was the Church 
of Christ. When Brother Rich stood 
here and testified that he had not re- 
ceived his testimony from his father, 
but from God, I was happy in the 
knowledge that there were thousands 
of young men born in this Church who 
could bear the same testimony; and I 
know that the world loves a man who 
is true to his convictions and fearless in 
defending the right, wherever he may 
be. 

About three weeks ago I received a 
letter from one of the largest wholesale 
houses of Cincinnati, In wnich they 
stated to me that they had met Brother 
Ben E. Rich (for they called him 
"brother") and had offered him a place 
in their establishment for his head- 
quarters, and that they would do all 
they could to help him along. I wrote 
an acknowledgment to that letter and 
told them I wanted them to take good 
care of him, for he was one of the no- 
ble sons of God, and whatever they did 
for him would indeed be appreciated by 
me. I know that I have hundreds of 



ELDER REED SMOOT. 



staunch friends outside our Church, and 
I believe there are hundreds and thou- 
sands of staunch friends to the Lat- 
ter-day Saints. Whenever a man goes 
into the world and is not afraid to bear 
testimony and speak in defense of the 
principles of the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints, I tell you 
that honest men respect such a one for 
so doing'. 

I desire to call the attention of the 
people to a question that has come to 
my notice in traveling- through the dif- 
ferent Stakes of Zion, and that is in re- 
gard to fast offerings. I am pleased to 
state here that there are a number of 
the Stakes of Zion that have no poor 
within their borders, so I have been in- 
formed in meeting with them; but they 
have thought that, because they had no 
poor, it was unnecessary for them to 
collect fast offerings. To all such 
Stakes I want to say that it is a re- 
quirement of the Church that the Saints 
observe the fast day each month and 
that the food saved by abstaining from 
meals that day should be given to the 
poor of God's Church. If this were uni- 
versally followed, there would be no one 
lacking food in all Zion. The require- 
ment made by the Church in relation to 
fast day offerings should be adhered 
to by every member of this Church. It 
may be asked, What shall be 
done with the offerings in Stakes 
where there are no poor? I have told 
the Presidents of Stakes and Bishops of 
wards that in the Salt Lake Stake and 
other large Stakes there are hundreds 
of poor that need to be fed and clothed, 
and could be with ease if all the Saints 
paid their fast offerings as they should. 
If the Bishops will only notify the Presi- 
dent of the Church that they have an 
accumulation of fast offerings he can 
tell them where to send it, and it will be 
put to good use. The poor people who 
congregate in the large cities can be 
helped by it. 

While I am on this subject, I desire 
to call the attention of the Bishops of 
the Church to some things I have no- 
ticed in regard to the distribution of 
the fast offerings, which, in my opinion, 
should be corrected. In one ward not 
long ago I was looking upon a list of 
the names of those who were helped 



from the fast day offerings. Standing 
at the head of the list was a man who 
had never in his life paid a dollar in 
any form to the Church of Jesus 
Christ, and he was a man who had 
been placed by the people in positions 
that brought him a deal of means ev- 
ery year. He lived for years in that 
Stake of Zion drawing a princely sal- 
ary, but forgot to pay his tithes and 
offerings; and now that adversity has 
overtaken him he is ready to come and 
ask that the fast offerings be given to- 
him, and seems to feel that he has a 
greater claim upon them than some 
faithful Latter-day Saints who perhaps 
are suffering more than he, but who 
may not call upon the Bishop so persist- 
ently as he does. I believe with all my 
heart in looking after the poor, no mat- 
ter what their condition may be; but 
I ask you Bishops and the people to first 
remember those that remember God in 
the days of their prosperity. I trust that 
every one who asks aid from the fast 
offerings will be worthy of it and will 
have a rightful claim upon the offer- 
ings of the people. 

In many parts of the Church, espec- 
ially in the outlying districts, the fast 
offerings are mostly paid in flour and 
produce of various kinds, and where 
such is the case, I would ask the Bish- 
ops to have the Deacons call upon the 
people every month for these offerings, 
and let them take what they gather 
to a place where it will be kept and 
cared for. In this way let the people 
be reminded every month of the re- 
quirement that is made of them. I un- 
derstand that in Salt Lake City and 
one or two other large towns where 
they handle nothing but cash, the offer- 
ings are paid at the fast meeting. 
Where it can be done in this way, it is 
all well and good; but in the great ma- 
jority of the wards of the Church we 
feel that the Bishops should see that 
the Deacons collect the fast offerings. 

I also desire to call another thing" to 
the attention of this vast audience, and 
I would that my voice could reach ev- 
ery home in Utah and wherever the 
people of God live. I refer how to the 
practice of running in debt. I ask the 
people of the Church of Christ to get 
out of debt, if they are in debt; and if 



26 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



they are out of debt, to stay out.Every- 
body has employment now, money is 
plentiful, the banks being- full of it, and 
it is easy to borrow; but I ask my 
brethren and sisters to remember one 
fact, which is considered as much a 
truth in business as any truth of the 
Gospel is religiously, and that is this: 
Failures are not made in times of de- 
pression. In hard times men's creditors 
try to make them pay up and crowd 
them pretty closely, and while a fail- 
ure may occur in hard times the cause 
of it began in prosperous times, when 
credit was easy. I a sk those who are 
in debt, to get out of debt while these 
prosperous times are upon us. Specula- 
tion is rife in the land; men are reach- 
ing out all over, and, I am afraid, 
reaching farther than they can gather; 
and the people here as well as in other 
parts of the country need to be warned 
against this tendency. I ask the Saints, 
as the President of the Church asked 
the Priesthood last night, to get out of 
debt, and keep out of debt. I want to 
say to the wives of the Church: When- 
ever your husband asks you to place 
a mortgage upon your home— the 
shelter of yourself and children— if it 
be not to save his honor, do not sign 
the mortgage. If he insists upon it, 
plead with him for your home and the 
home of your children. Fathers, I say 
to you, wherever you have a piece of 
land in Zion, I trust that you will not 
sell it. Do not sell your inheritance. 
Do not sell the farm that you have 
worked on. If you are getting old, di- 
vide it up with the boys and keep them 
at home. I wish that every farm in this 
land was farmed as it should be, and 
every corner attended to. I have often 
said that if the sugar factory in Utah 
county had done nothing else than to 
learn our farmers how to farm, it had 
proved a blessing to the people of Utah. 
I say so now. I ask the farmers to 
see that every foot of their land is cul- 
tivated, instead of some of it going to 
weeds, and then you will not have to 
have your boys hunting new places and 
getting from under your influence. 

I ask God's blessing upon this great 
multitude, and upon His Church and 
people, wherever they may be upon the 
face of the earth. My prayer is that 



that blessing shall be upon them, in 
the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER ANTHONY W. IVINS. 
(President of the Juarez Stake.) 

My brethren and sisters, during the 
few moments that I shall occupy in 
telling you something of the condition 
of the Latter-day Saints who are lo- 
cated in the republic of Mexico, I sin- 
cerely desire that I may be assisted by 
your faith. It is quite unexpectedly 
that I am called to occupy this posi- 
tion, and therefore I must depend upon 
your assistance and the aid of ou r 
Father in heaven. 

The Latter-day Saints in Mexico are 
doing the things which the Latter-dav 
Saints are doing in Canada, in Mon- 
tana, in Oregon, in Idaho, in Wyoming, 
in Utah, and in all other places where 
Lhey are established. The Gospel is the 
c ame wherever we are. Our effort is, 
bv example as well as by precept, to 
teach the Mexican people the ways of 
the Lord and convert them to the truth 
Of the fact that God's kingdom has 
oeen established in the dispensation In 
which we live. There are in Mexico 
about 12,000,000 of people, 9,000,000 of 
whom are Indians whose blood has not 
been intermingled with the blood of 
uther people. For nearly 400 years 
these Indians have been a subjugated 
race. Since the conquest of Mexico, 
when with the sword in one hand and 
the Bible in the other the doctrines of 
the Catholic church were established 
among the Aztec people, that great 
church has been dominant there, and 
probably 95 per cent of the inhabitants 
v£ Mexico are converts to its teachings. 
We have not sought insistently to in- 
troduce the principles of the Gospel 
among the Mexican people; but b" 
degrees, through the example which we 
set, through our works of industry, and 
through the blessing of the Lord upon 
our efforts, we find it necessary to send 
out missionaries and organize branches 
cf the Church among them. 

A year ago last June, under the di- 
rection of Apostle John Henry Smith, 
a mission was re-established in th<i 
( ity of Mexico, since which time about 
200 people have been added to the 



ELDER ANTHONY W. IVINS. 



27 



Church— that is, probably 150 convert? 
have been made and about 50 had a 1 . - 
leady been baptized— so that we have a 
very prosperous and promising- branch 
of the Church there, with headquarters 
in the City of Mexico. 

Our relationship with the federal 
government is of the most agreeable 
cind friendly character. President Diaz, 
whose strong character has made it 
possible for him to accomplish the re- 
markable reconstruction of the Mexi- 
can government which has been the re- 
sult of his administration, owes much 
of his character, it is admitted by all 
to the strong blood of his mother, who 
was an Indian. 

We regard with a great deal of satis- 
faction the devotion that is shown by 
these simple people to the principles 
cf the Gospel after they receive them 
They are very poor, very humble; the> 
have been so long in abject servitude to 
the small aristocratic minority which 
Las controlled and does still control 
the politics and finances of Mexico, that 
the spirit of independence has to a 
great degree been crushed out of them, 
but they are religious. That those who 
are converted have received a testi- 
mony of the Gospel and the Spirit of 
the Lord is evidenced by their works, 
by their repentance, by their devotion 
to the Elders who are laboring among 
them, and by the disposition which 
they show to push out into unexplored* 
fields and introduce the Gospel among 
their fellows. 

The Lord told us in the early history 
of the Church that before the great dav 
of the Lord should come, Jacob shou'd 
flourish in the wilderness and the La- 
manites should blossom as the rose. 
Tf you will carefully study the reve- 
lations of the Lord to the Church, you 
v. ill find that our destiny and the des- 
tiny of the American Indians, who are 
the descendants of Lehi and heirs to 
the promises which God has made to 
the house of Israel, are very closed 
associated together. You will find that 
before the redemption of Zion the work 
of the Lord must be introduced among 
the Lamanites. Christ said to His dis 
cirles, when He ministered among them 
upon this continent, that He would 
firive them a sign by which they might 



know that the work of the Father was 
nbout to begin for the redemption of 
all Israel and the fulfillment of every 
word which had been spoken by tha 
mouths of the holy prophets, and this 
was the sign which He gave: "When 
these things which I declare unto you 
and which I shall declare unto you 
hereafter of myself, and by the pow«r 
of the Holy Ghost, which shall b> 
given unto you of the Father, shall 
be made known unto the Gentiles, that 
they may know concerning this peop^ 
who are a remnant of the house of 
Jacob, and concerning this my people 
who shall be scattered by them; . . . 
and when these things come to pass, 
that thy seed shall begin to know these 
tnings, it shall be a sign unto them, 
that they may know that the work of 
ti e Father hath already commenced 
unto the fulfilling of the covenant 
v/nich we had made unto the people 
who are of the house of Israel." S«, 
my brethren and sisters, as we see 
the result of our labors in Mexico and 
the very promising outlook there is for 
the introduction of the Gospel there, we 
see these words of the Lord fulfilled, 
and it encourages us in the hope that 
w? are nearer — as we know we are — 
to the consummation of God's purpose-3 
in the dispensation in which we live. 

Our life in Mexico has taught us pa- 
tience. They are a slow-going people, 
and it has taught us to develop 'to a 
neater degree perhaps than among any 
oLher people the spirit of charity and 
longsuffering kindness, knowing as we 
do that their condition is the result of 
transgression on the part of their fore- 
fathers. We have learned that our 
friendly relations with them and with 
+hat government are largely due to the 
fact that we have sought to bring 
blessing where we have gone, that we 
have taught kindness and considera- 
tion, charity and love to the people, 
and have endeavored to exemplify that 
in our lives. It is not necessary to 
teach resentment and retaliation; there 
is enough of that in the nature of man. 
The spirit of the Gospel of Christ 
teaches people to overcome those pro- 
pensities, and to bow in humble sub- 
nvssion to the will of God. This is His 
work, and He will take care of it. That 



28 



GENERAL, CONFERENCE. 



which we need to do is to be humble, 
faithful and considerate of the condi- 
tions of our fellows with whom we 
come in contact, teaching them repent 
ance from sin, teaching them love, 
charity, and absolute dependence upon 
God to work out this great problem. 
He will do it, my brethren and sisters. 
In this age of reason, of logic and of 
argument the truth must eventually 
prevail, and the principles of the Gos- 
pel, being founded upon evelasting 
truth, will triumph. We need have no 
fear but that the Lord will take care 
of His people. 

I bring you greetings from the people 
in Mexico, and assure you that our 
hearts, like yours, are absorbed in the 
work of the Lord; that our sole desire 
is for the upbuilding of His kingdom, 
the welfare of the Latter-day Saints, 
and the conversion of the world. This 
is cur mission, and with us more es- 
pecially the conversion of the remnants 
of the house of Israel surrounding us. 
We owe a great deal to the Lamanites. 
Whoever stopped to reflect that the 
man who was sent from God to teach 
the Prophet Joseph the principles of 
the Gospel, and who showed him where 
the plates were concealed containing 
the record which, translated, was given 
to the world as the Book of Mormon, 
was one of the ancestors of the aborig- 
ines of this continent? The Book of 
Mormon came from them, and it con- 
ta ns the fullness of the Gospel of 
Christ as no other book does. There- 
fore we feel that there is some obliga- 
tion upon us to remember this down- 
trodden, oppressed people, and with the 
help of God to bring about their re- 
demption, through obedience to the 
laws and ordinances of the Gospel. 
Give us your faith and prayers in this 
work; we need them. We are isolated 
entirely from our brethren and sisters; 
we are surrounded by a strange peo- 
ple, with a strange language, with cus- 
toms and manners entirely foreign and 
distinct from ours; but, thanks be to 
the Lord, we have been preserved and 
prospered, and the people are con- 
tented and happy, satisfied with their 
lot, and entirely devoted to the work 
which has been assigned to them. 

May God bless you, my brethren and 



sisters, and help us all to perform oir 
duties, that we may ultimately see the 
triumph of truth. I ask it in the name 
of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER SAMUEL E. WOOLLEY. 

(President of Sandwich Islands Mis- 
sion.) 

It gives me joy this morning to meet 
with so many Latter-day Saints. I 
have been absent from the bosom of 
the Church for over seven years, pre- 
siding over the Sandwich Islands Mis- 
sion. I have had great joy in my la- 
bors with that people, and also with 
the Elders and sisters who have labor- 
ed with me in trying to convert them. 
We have heard from Brother Ivins re- 
garding the Lamanites. The people of 
the Sandwich Islands are of the same 
blood. They are of the seed of Israel 
and great promises have been made 
concerning them, if they will be faith- 
ful in the latter days. We have had 
success in our labors. There have been 
upwards of 2,000 converted and baptized 
into the Church during the last seven 
years. From last April conference to 
the end of August there were 300 new 
members added to the Church, 110 of 
which were baptized in the old district, 
where the Church was first established 
by President George Q. Cannon, and 
t where President Smith labored in his 
youth. In the place where the Gospel 
was first established there are only 
three remaining outside the Church to- 
day. This has been a hard district for 
years, but the Lord has opened up the 
way, and the honest that have dwelt 
there so long have been converted, 
some of whom are over 80 years of age. 
The other part of the mission is also 
prosperous, and I feel that we are do- 
ing a great labor among that people. 
We have not enough Elders, however, 
to do the work that we would like to 
do. There are only 15 Elders remaining 
in the mission, and four sisters from 
Zion. But we are aided greatly by local 
Elders, who are very efficient in 
preaching the Gospel to their friends 
and kindred. We also have in that 
mission a sugar plantation, which 
makes the mission self-sustaining. 
That, too, is prospering, and we are

building it up and making it a desir- 
able home for the people who require 
labor. 

I rejoice this morning to meet with 
the Saints and to mingle my voice with 
my brethren in speaking to the people 
and in bearing testimony to the truth 
of this great work that we are en- 
gaged in . I know that the Lord lives, 
and that He has been with the Elder9 
In our mission. I know that Joseph 
Smith was a Prophet, and that the 
Gospel is true. I know, as we all ought 
to know, that we are engaged in the 
work of the Lord; and if we will be 
faithful in keeping His laws and com- 
mandments we will receive exaltation 
in the presence of our Father in 
heaven. 

At the request of President Smith, 
Elder Woolley spoke a short time in the 
Hawaiian tongue, remarking before do- 
ing so that he had spoken exclusively 
in that language for the last seven 
years, and for five and a half years, 
previous to that, during which time he 
had labored at the Josepa colony, he 
had been under the necessity of using 
that language almost entirely. 

ELDER HEBER S. ALLEN. 
(President of Alberta Stake.) 

I am very grateful for the privilege 
of being with you, my brethren and sis- 
ters. About 100 people came from Can- 
ada to the conference — perhaps the 
largest number that has ever been pres- 
ent at such a gathering of the Church. 
While I stand before you a few mo- 
ments I desire an interest in your faith 
and prayers, and am desirous of being 
directed by the Spirit of the Lord in 
what I say. 

I am very young in the position to 
which I have been called, the reorgan- 
ization of the Stake having taken place 
less than a month ago. The people in 
Canada feel well in the Gospel, and a 
good spirit prevails throughout all the 
settlements of the Saints. Our people 
in Canada have much to be grateful 
for. They have been wonderfully pros- 
pered in that land. The Lord has bless- 
ed them abundantly; and while they 
have many things to contend with that 



you have not in Utah, at the same time 
they have been prospered and the 
blessings of the Lord have attended 
them in all that they have set their 
hands to do. It is now about fifteen 
years since our people went into that 
country; I have been there fourteen 
years; and while the people of that 
land looked upon us with suspicion 
when we first went there they have 
grown to love and honor us now, and 
to seek the Latter-day Saints as set- 
tlers for their vast tracts of land. One 
of the first business enterprises that 
our people started, about 13 years ago, 
had some difficulty in getting a char- 
ter to do business, for it was feared 
that if we got a foothold in the coun- 
try we would drive all other people 
out, and it took us about six months 
to get a little business incorporated 
with a capital of ten thousand dollars. 
It is very different today, however. 
The people are desirous that we should 
settle among them, and the Lord has 
raised up many men, among them 
some leaders of the government, who 
have fought our battles in the legisla- 
tive halls of that country. 

A short time ago I had occasion to 
visit some of the officials of the North- 
west government, and they expressed 
themselves very freely in relation to 
the labors of our people. They said 
they had not seen so much progress in 
any other part of the Northwest as 
they had in our part of the country. 
They came through some of our new 
settlements, and the progress and pros- 
perity seen on every hand was truly 
marvelous to them. In one of the set- 
tlements just established, where fifteen 
months ago not a furrow had been 
plowed, this year they will raise about 
150,000 bushels of as fine grain as you 
ever saw. This was a marvel to some 
of the officials of the government. The 
Bishop of that Ward wrote me some 
time ago and wanted to know what he 
should do with the tithing grain, as he 
had only capacity for 3,000 bushels and 
he expected to receive from 12,000 to 15,- 
000 bushels. I met quite a number of 
officials there and they expressed them- 
selves as highly pleased with the man- 
ner in which our people have taken 



30 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



hold of the country- I saw one gentle- 
man who had labored throughout dif- 
ferent parts of the Northwest Terri- 
tory, on government works, and he told 
his friends that he had been better 
treated among the Latter-day Saints 
than in any other part of the North- 
west, and that he saw more evidence 
of thrift and prosperity there than in 
any other place. We are very glad 
that we occupy this position before the 
people of the country. 

The Saints feel well spiritually. They 
are trying to live their religion to the 
best of their ability, under the circum- 
stances in which they are placed; and 
while some of our settlements that are 
located near the mountains have suf- 
fered with frosts this year, upon the 
whole we have had an abundant har- 
vest—plenty for our home needs and a 
great deal to export. I believe that we 
have the honor of being the best tithe- 
paying people in the Church. I under- 
stand that Alberta Stake stands at the 
head. We are mostly young people out 
there. There are very few old pe pie 
among us. I think it would be difficult 
to find 15 persons over 60 years of age. 
I believe the Lord is modifying the cli- 
mate for our good. We do not have 
the rigorous winters that we used to 
have. Our young people are well looked 
after in that Stake. There is very lit- 
tle sin of the graver kind amongst 
them, and we are trying to the very 
best of our ability to live up to our re- 
ligion. As an evidence of the spirit 
which exists in our Stake, I might cite 
the fact that twenty or thirty people 
who have been in the Church all their 
lives, but have lived on the outskirts, 
in mining camps, have come down this 
conference for the purpose of go ng 
through the Temple and being sealed 
together as husbands and wives and 
children. 

I believe we have a very great future 
before us in Alberta. The government 
officials have done all in their power 
to make it pleasant for us, and they 
have made all the concessions that they 
possibly could under the laws of the 
land. We enjoy just as much fre dom 
as the people of any country do, and 



the Lord is blessing us. We hope in 
the not distant future to have a temple 
in that land, and I was very glad to 
hear our President say yesterday that 
it was the intention to build temples in 
the outlying Stakes of Zion. I presume 
that our people have spent many thous- 
ands of dollars ta come down here and 
go through the temples of the Lord. 
When our young people get married we 
like to see them start out right, but it 
is a very expensive trip to come down 
here to go through the house of the 
Lord; and it would not take many- 
years, if we could use the money that 
is spent for this purpose, to build a 
temple of our own. I believe that Can- 
ada is a good place for people who have 
not got good homes, and for young peo- 
ple who have plenty of sticktoitiveness 
and are filled with faith, courage and 
energy; but I never have advocated 
the breaking up of homes by Utah peo- 
ple who are well established in order 
to come to Canada. I have been there 
quite a few years myself and am pret- 
ty well acquainted with all the people 
in the Stake, and I can say that many 
young people who came with nothing 
and stayed with the country are well- 
to do today and trying to live their re- 
ligion. 

May the Lord bless us all in this 
great work of His, and may He es- 
pecially bless those who are called to 
preside in the various offices through- 
out the Church with wisdom to direct 
the affairs thereof, that the purposes 
of the Lord may be accomplished in the 
earth, is my prayer in the r.ame of 
Jesus. Amen. 

PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 

Appreciation of faithful labors — A spirit of rest- 
lessness not desirable. 

It may be appropriate at this mo- 
ment for me to say a few words rela- 
tive to the Alberta Stake of Zion. Most 
of the Latter-day Saints are aware of 
the fact that President Charles O. Card 
was the pioneer of that country, and 
for long years has been acting as the 
president of the Alberta Stake of Zion. 
We desire to say to his numerous 
friends and acquaintances that no man 



ELDER WILLIAM H. SMART. 



31 



who has been called to such a position 
has been more valiant and faithful in 
the performance of his duty, accord- 
ing to his knowledge and ability, than 
President Charles O. Card. He has 
been indeed a pioneer, a faithful, en- 
ergetic man, and has been instrumental 
in laying, to a great extent, the founda- 
tions of the prosperity of the Alberta 
Stake. But on our late visit we found 
that his health was so greatly impaired 
that it became necessary to honorably 
relieve him from the great responsibili- 
ties of presiding over that Stake; and 
I think you will all bear me witness, 
if Brother Allen will continue to main- 
tain the spirit that he possesses today, 
we will not have made any mistake 
in selecting Brother Card's successor. 

I would also say that we do not de- 
sire the people to get in their minds 
a spirit of restlessness or a desire to 
migrate from one place to another. We 
would like our brethren and sisters to 
remain where they are, as long as they 
can consistently, and only those go to 
the newer Stakes who have a necessity 
to go. We desire to maintain our 
foothold and to continue to establish 
ourselves in the central Stakes of Zion. 
We realize the necessity for this, and 
we hope that the brethren and sisters 
of all the Stakes will continue to abide 
where they are and contend for the 
success of the people in the locality 
where they live. There are a few 
places where our people have settled 
which need no words of commendation 
to induce settlers to go there, because 
they plead their own cause; but we de- 
sire to keep the foothold we have. We 
do not intend to retrograde, or to yield 
up. We believe that there has been no 
mistake made in the past in forming 
settlements in the south and in the 
various places where our people are 
located. We believe that the hand of 
the Lord is in it all, and that those 
who directed the locating and settle- 
ment of those places were inspired by 
that wisdom which comes from above. 



ELDER WILLIAM H. SMART 
(President of Wasatch Stake). 

My brethren and sisters, I feel very 



dependent upon the Lord to direct me 
in the utterances that I shall make. 
It has been very interesting to hear the 
reports from the various missionary 
fields of the world. It is gratifying to 
see the work of the Lord progressing 
in the earth and it makes my heart re- 
joice to receive testimonies of the 
same. 

A year ago last February I was called 
to go into the Wasatch Stake of Zion 
— seventy miles from this city by rail 
— to succeed President Abram Hatch as 
the president of that Stake; so that I 
am, comparatively speaking, an infant 
in this grave responsibility, and I can 
speak mostly of our good intentions 
rather than the labors that have been 
performed. We are 5,500 feet above 
sea level, away up in the tops of the 
mountains in a very beautiful valley 
surrounded by the everlasting hills. In 
reading of the physical structure of 
Switzerland I often think that our 
little valley may be compared in its 
beauty to some of the beautiful valleys 
of Switzerland. No doubt, this is why 
we have in our valley so many good, 
sturdy inhabitants from Switzerland. 
Our little valley shows the hand of 
hardihood, industry and privation; for 
the winter months have been long and 
the summer months short. There are 
those in that valley who have gone 
through all the privations of early life 
in these mountains. Many of them 
knew the Prophet Joseph Smith, and 
passed through the trying scenes of 
the early history of our Church, and 
crossed the plains when it was but a 
trackless desert. We have nine Pa- 
triarchs to bless the people, and most 
of these Patriarchs had the privilege 
of knowing the Prophet Joseph Smith, 
and their old frames vibrate under the 
powerful testimonies which they bear 
that he was a prophet of the living 
God. We have many aged sisters 
who knew the Prophet, and who went 
through the early trials among our peo- 
ple. We feel blessed to have so many 
aged brethren and sisters still living 
among us with burning testimonies of 
the divinity of Joseph Smith's mission. 

I desire to say that we are endeav- 
oring to keep up with the spirit of the 

times. We encourage our people to 



32 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



remain at home and build upon the 
worthy foundation laid by the men and 
women who were the pioneers of that 
little commonwealth. We have hun- 
dreds of acres in the valley still cov- 
ered with sagebrush — virgin soil which 
has not yet known the plow — and our 
hearts are going out in loving sympa- 
thy to these untilled acres. Our hearts 
are also going out to our young men 
who are going to Park City, delving 
in the mines for gold and silver, and 
being led astray by the vices of the 
world, when there are still hundreds 
of acres yet uncultivated at home. Our 
minds are being led to some extent on 
the question of irrigation and along 
those temporal lines that will assist in 
sanctifying the land and bringing It 
to a higher state of cultivation. In 
spiritual matters we are endeavoring 
to do our duty. Our Heavenly Father 
has blessed me with two good counsel- 
ors in the persons of Joseph R. Mur- 
dock and James C. Jensen — men who 
feel to give their lives to the service 
of God. They have stated that if need 
be all their time and means are at the 
disposal of God our Eternal Father for 
the upbuilding of His Church upon the 
earth. We have a High Council who 
are men of God. They are united with 
us in furthering the interests of our 
people. We have a corps of Bishops 
who are leading the people as best they 
can according to the ability which God 
has given them. We are endeavoring 
to be abreast of the spirit of the times 
with regard to the quorums of the 
Priesthood; but I regret to say that 
in our Stake we have experienced the 
difficulties which Bishop Preston spoke 
of in the Priesthood meeting last even- 
ing — that is, our work in the Teachers* 
department is not as we would like to 
have it. In the auxiliary departments 
of the Church we are trying to keep up 
with the rest of the Church. Speak- 
ing of religion class work, the presi- 
dency and High Council, and for the 
most part our Bishops, are interested 
In this work. We see that It will be 
a mighty factor, under the blessing of 
God, in distilling the principles of the 
Gospel upon the minds of the youth 
of Zion. We realize that we feed our 
children's bodies three times a day.but 
too many of us have been contented to 



give them only one or two spiritual 

meals a week. Therefore, many of 
the youth of Zion are growing up 
physically strong, but spiritually weak. 
We recognize this condition in the 
Wasatch Stake. In visiting some of 
our religion classes, tears have rolled 
down my cheeks to see little tots stand 
before the class and lead their class- 
mates in a practical prayer. It has 
made me think of that prayer of the 
Savior where He said, "I thank thee, 
O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, 
because thou hast hid these things 
from the wise and prudent, and hast 
revealed them unto babes." I have 
thought of it, too, when our little chil- 
dren taught the law of tithing in these 
classes, have brought their nickels and 
laid them, like the disciples of old, at 
the feet of their teachers. 

May God grant that the spirit of 
progression may be in the hearts of 
the people in every part of the vine- 
yard of the Lord, and that we, His ser- 
vants, may be equal to the great duties 
that He has placed upon us. I ask it 
in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER ABRAHAM O. WOODRUFF. 

Establishment and maintenance of settlements — 
Hand of God manifest In them— Discrimina- 
tion against the Saints. 

My dear brethren and sisters, I have 
been very much delighted with what 
we have heard during this conference, 
and while I stand before you to bear 
my testimony to the divinity of this 
work and to say a few words I desire 
your faith and sympathy and the divine 
aid of my Father in heaven. I re- 
joiced very much in the words of Presi- 
dent Joseph F. Smith this mprning, 
and I would like to call your attention 
to the fact that the Prophet Joseph 
Smith, many years before the bulk of 
the people ever thought of coming to 
these Rocky mountains, predicted that 
the Saints would suffer much persecu- 
tion, but that many of them would 
live to come to these valleys of the 
Rocky mountains and assist in estab- 
lishing cities there. 

I have in the past spoken considerably 
regarding our new settlements, and I 
want to say a few words this morning 
in regard to our old settlements. I 



"ULDER ABRAHAM O. WOODRUFF. 



33 



know that the brawn and sinew of the 
older settlements have been drawn up- 
on largely in order to establish new 
settlements in various parts of the 
country, and as a result there is a 
spirit of lethargy and not of progress 
resting upon the people of some of 
these old settlements. The young and 
energetic have gone to Canada or other 
northern locations, and have left only 
the aged and infirm and the non-pro- 
gressive, and where this is the case the 
settlements are in a state of decline. If 
I were the president of a stake in 
which these conditions exist, and col- 
onization agents came into the stake 
and attempted to draw away Bishops 
and progressive men, I would demand 
that they show their credentials from 
the Presidency of the Church, or I 
would not let them take my useful men. 

I feel that in the establishment of 
these settlements we have been doing 
the will of God and I want to call your 
attention to the fact that some of the 
best blood of this Church has been 
called, not to occupy the most desirable 
sections of country, but to go and as- 
sist in the establishment of lands to 
the south which might be regarded a9 
altogether undesirable. Hundreds of 
thousands of dollars have been spent 
and lives have been worn out in es 
tablishing these settlements, and I hope 
that they will never be abandoned be- 
cause there is better country some- 
where else. I want to tell you, in the 
name of the Lord, that the time will 
come when the wisdom of God 
in establishing these settlements 
under the direction of the 
leaders of the Church, both 
past and present, will be manifest, and 
that He hasi had a purpose in doing it.. 
We did not come to these Rocky moun- 
tains because it was a good, desirabla 
country. We are here today because 
President Brigham Young, when the 
pioneers landed in this valley, said this 
was the place where God designed His 
people should halt. Those who wer& 
looking for good countries wanted him 
to go on to California, or to Oregon; 
but he said; No, here is the place— very 
undesirable in the eyes of men, there- 
fore it will not excite the cupidity or 
the selfishness of our enemies, and here 



we can rest. As a result of the inspira- 
tion which rested upon the Prophet 
Joseph Smith in his successors, the 
Saints have been established in these 
nooks of the mountains. Had they gone 
to more favored places.it would not have 
been long before they would have been 
only a drop in the bucket; but by being 
placed in these crevices of the rocks 
they have been able to maintain their 
ground, and God has blessed the land 
for the sake of His people. As I have 
often said, the Lord has caused some 
of His choicest sons and daughters to 
go into the stakes of Arizona and Mex- 
ico, where they do not raise 10,000 
bushels of grain, but where they have 
■gone because He has called them 
through His servants to locate there, 
and where they have determined to 
stay though it should cost them their 
lives. That is the kind of people that 
dwell in those places that are consid- 
ered undesirable. They may not be de- 
sirable places, but they have to be built 
up and maintained; and we do not 
want to draw from them their best 
blood and leave them in a languishing 
condition. We want them to continue 
to progress, to husband the water, take 
care of the lands which God has given 
them, and build new houses. We go in- 
to some settlements and find that there 
has not been a new house built in the 
last five ok ten years, and all the 
young and progressive element have 
left to the detriment of those who re- 
mained. 

I am in favor of maintaining these 
settlements. I am also in favor of main- 
taining our foothold right here at head- 
quarters, where we are new almost up- 
rooted, because the country has appar- 
ently become too good for us. It is 
worth too much money, and conse- 
quently we have sold out to those not 
of our faith. Therefore, we have but 
little voice in the government of our 
city and in other affairs here. While 
the Latter-day Saints have built the rail- 
roads, and while they furnish, I am 
told, about 80 per cent of the local traf- 
fic of these roads, there is scarcely one 
Latter-day Saint in a hundred in the 
employ of these large railroad com- 
panies. These matters are controlled 
almost exclusively by the labor unions.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



The contracts for our buildings, when 
they are let, are controlled by com- 
panies who employ union men; and a9 
a result our people, who are counseled 
all the time to keep out of these things, 
have to take what few crumbs drop 
from those who are eating the slice. 
I do not think this is a good thing. "We 
do not show that interest in each other 
in these temporal affairs that we ought 
to do. We have not as much interest in 
obtaining employment for one another 
in this city, take us as a whole people, 
as the labor unions have for 
their members. And I am in favor of 
either joining the unions or else being a 
union among ourselves as we ought to 
be. I feel that the Latter-day Saints 
are in a position to demand some con- 
sideration in regard to these things, 
and that we ought not to be forced to 
sell our homes right here at head- 
quarters because the land has become 
too valuable for us. I love the little 
piece of land I occupy, which was a 
part of my father's homestead, and 1 
have covenanted with the Lord ana 
with myself that I will never part with 
that, unless I have to do it to maintain 
my honor, or the honor of my people, 
or to buy bread for my family. 

God bless you, my brethren and sis- 
ters. I rejoice in the Gospel of the 
Lord Jesus Christ. I know that this 
is God's work, and I know that we, 
have a living Church, not a dead form, 
for which I thank God. May the bless- 
ings of the Lord be upon our brethren 
and sisters who have worn out their 
lives in fulfilling the missions where- 
unto they have been called to build up 
the great southern country and to live 
in the less desirable places. They are 
among the best people we have in the 
Church, and God has blessed them ana 
will bless them. I love them, as I love 
the people of every other part of Zion. 
As President Smith has said, there are 
sections of our country which will rec- 
ommend themselves and speak fox 
themselves; but I do not think that 
people ought to be drawn away from 
our old settlements, to the detriment of 
those places, in order to build up some 
other country. I am interested in Can- 
ada, in Oregon, in Big Horn, and in 
every one of these settlements that 



have been founded, as my labors in the 
Apostleship have been exclusively in 
the stakes of Zion, I think over these 
things, and I am concerned regarding 
the welfare of our settlements and theii 
maintenance. President Smith and I 
went to St. Johns, with authority to 
release the people there, if they wanted 
to go, and we could not do it. The 
young and the old stood up and ex- 
pressed their feelings; they cried, and 
we cried, and we were determined that 
♦we would not raise our hands to aban 
don a settlement which had been es» 
tablished under the direction of one of 
the prophets of God. Now, my brethren 
and sisters, let us think of these 
things. Let us be contented. Let u» 
be progressive in our own settlements, 
and let us strive to love all mankind. 
I thank God for the honorable men of 
the earth, and for the Latter-day Saints 
who are accomplishing good in this 
world. I recognize in every man one 
of God's sons, and in every woman ont> 
of His daughters; and they are all my 
friends, so far as they befriend Zion or 
speak a good word for her. May God 
bless us and fill us continually with the 
testimony of Jesus, who died for the 
redemption of all mankind. I ask it 
in the name of Jesus. Amen. 



ELDER L. A. KELSCH. 

My brethren and sisters, while stand- 
ing before you for a short time I desire 
to be inspired of the Lord to say only 
those things that shall be for our good. 
I have greatly rejoiced in the testimo- 
nies which have been borne during this 
conference. My heart has been made 
glad. I rejoice in bearing testimony un- 
to you, and unto all who shall read con- 
cerning this conference, that I know 
that the work in which we are engaged 
is of God, and that He has revealed 
His mind and will unto His servants 
the prophets in these latter days. I 
know that Joseph Smith was a prophet 
of God, raised up in this dispensation, 
and that he has given the mind and 
will of the Lord unto the inhabitants 
of the earth; that the authority which 
he received from holy messengers 
whom God sent to confer it upon him, 
has been conferred upon brethren who 



ELDER L. A. KELSCH. 



35 



are in this congregation, and that 
these men of God hold the right and 
the authority to act in the name of 
Jesus Christ in all the world; that this 
Gospel which has been restored in these 
latter days is going to revolutionize the 
whole world, and bring together the 
children of men into one faith, by which 
every man and woman will Know that 
God lives and that Jesus is the Christ, 
that Joseph Smith is a prophet of God, 
and that he died as a martyr. This 
work will continue to grow and increase 
among the nations vof the earth. The 
Lord is at the head, and He will direct 
its course. Whether those of us who 
have been called to labor for Him are 
faithful or not, He will have men, and 
plenty of them, to accomplish His 
mighty purposes. I desire to be one of 
those who shall be faithful unto the 
end; for I realize that It Is not the re- 
ceiving of great testimonies and prom- 
ises that will save us, but those who 
receive these great blessings are ex- 
pected to use their power and strength 
for the accomplishment of His purposes 
and to endure faithfully to the end. 

I have had the great pleasure and 
privilege to be called as one o* the ser- 
vants of God to carry the Gospel to 
the nations of the earth, and in my 
weak way I have tried to fulfill the 
responsibilities which have been placed 
upon me. The last mission to which 
I have been called was, as has been 
stated by President Smith, a mission 
to Japan. I was called to assist Apos- 
tle Heber J. Grant and Brothers Hor- 
ace S. Ensign and Alma O. Taylor. As 
you are aware, a little over one year 
ago we left here for that land; and it 
seemed to us when we arrived that we 
were indeed strangers in a strange land, 
for everything was strange unto us. 
The people, their customs, their habits, 
their food — all were strange. We could 
not speak to the people, only through 
interpreters, except to those who were 
able to understand the English lan- 
guage. We have in our weak way tried 
to do the best we could. We have suc- 
ceeded in making two converts, and we 
had the privilege of baptizing them. 
We might have baptized many, if we 
had desired to do so; but we realized 



that they did not know sufficient of this 
work to justify us in baptizing them 
into the fold of Christ. I believe that 
there are many honest souls in that 
land. There is a great people living 
upon the different islands of Japan, 
The Japanese are very kind, very socia- 
ble, and extremely polite. I never saw 
so much politeness and kindness in my 
life as I have witnessed among that 
people, not only with themselves, but 
also to foreigners. My heart went out 
to that people in love, and I had a 
great desire to preach the Gospel unto 
them in their own tongue; but for some 
cause it has not been my fortune to do 
this. I have been asked many times 
if I am going back to Japan. I want 
to say to you, my brethren and sisters, 
that I have been released from that 
mission. I was not able to preach the 
Gospel in their language, but I have 
preached it to thousands of foreigners 
there, and to the Japanese who were 
able to understand me. I visited a great 
many of them and preached the Gos- 
pel to them. After I found out that 
my time would be short in that land, I 
made it my special business to labor 
among the missionaries of other 
churches, preaching the Gospel to them, 
trying to make friends with them and 
getting them to stop speaking evil of 
us. I believe I succeeded to some ex- 
tent, at least, a number of them be- 
came friendly, and some invited me to 
visit them again, which I did. I met 
men there who had visited this city, and 
notwithstanding they did not agree 
*vith our faith they admitted that we 
had a beautiful city, and they also ad- 
mitted that we could be saved as well 
as them, if we would be faithful to 
that which we believed. 

The brethren and sisters who are 
there now were feeling well when I 
left. They are desirous of performing 
a good mission, and remaining there un- 
til they are honorably released. The 
language is very difficult to learn, and 
it will be necessary for the Lord to as- 
sist the brethren and sisters in order 
that they may acquire it. Until that i» 
accomplished, I do not feel that much 
will be done among that people; for 



36 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



preaching the Gospel through an inter- 
preter is a mistake, I believe; always 
has been, and always will be, in my 
opinion. This has been proven in 
Japan; but we had to have some one 
to talk to the people, who crowded 
themselves upon us and desired to know 
something about our faith. We found 
that the interpreter could not translate 
some words to convey the proper mean- 
ing, and scholars there have told us 
that it is very difficult to translate 
English into Japanese. There are many 
words in the English that they cannot 
find equivalents for, and in order to 
get them to understand our meaning 
some words will have to be explained 
considerably. For this reason I feel 
that nothing of much moment will be 
done until our brethren are able to 
speak unto the people in their own lan- 
guage, thereby getting close to their 
spirits and warming them up by the 
testimony of the truth. The people are 
very anxious to know concerning our 
doctrine; but whether they will receive 
it after we are able to explain it unto 
them I cannot tell. We can only plant; 
it is God who gives the increase. Even 
if they should come into the Church by 
the thousands, they will have to be 
humble, prayerful and diligent, or they 
will be overcome, just as we have to be 
diligent and careful in order to avoid 
being overcome. For from the begin- 
ning of this work Satan has tried to 
destroy it. You remember when Joseph 
Smith went into the woods to ask God 
what church he should join, how the 
power of darkness seized him. I be- 
lieve that Satan knew Joseph Smith in 
the spirit world; knew he was a 
mighty man, and that he would seek 
to overthrow his kingdom; and there- 
fore, as soon as he went to pray unto 
the Lord, he tried to destroy him, and 
it was only the power of God which 
saved him at that time. Then from 
that time on Satan continually sought 
to kill him, and finally he accomplished 
it, though not until the Lord permitted 
it and the time had come when it was 
necessary, I presume, for him to seal 
his testimony with his blood; "for 
where a testament is," says Paul, 



"there must also of necessity be the 
death of the testator." Many of the 
Saints have lost their lives for the Gos- 
pel's sake, and every one of us will 
have to be willing to sacrifice all that 
we have, and our lives if necessary, if 
we expect to receive the same blessing. 
Jesus did not seek to-do His own will, 
but the will of the Father. We shall 
have to do the same. We must be will- 
ing to do the will of God as made mani- 
fest through His servants. President 
Joseph F. Smith and his counselors and 
the Twelve Apostles are servants of 
God, and they give unto us the word 
of God. We must be willing to heark- 
en to that word, just as if Christ were 
to come himself and deliver it; and un- 
til we are willing to be governed in that 
way we will not make the progress 
which God designs we should make 
We must be willing to be governed in 
righteousness, and I want to tell you 
that the servants of God do not de- 
sire to exercise any influence over the 
children of men only upon the principles 
of righteousness and justice. Not one 
of you can stand up and truthfully say 
that you have ever been told by any 
President of the Church, or by any 
Apostle, to do anything that would not 
be for your good or for the good of 
mankind. I know there is safety in 
being humbled and willing to be guided 
by the Lord. If we are obedient, then 
God will bless us. If we are willing to 
be judged, we will make good judges 
ourselves; but we never will until we 
become subject to the power of God 
ourselves. 

I thank my Heavenly Father for the 
privilege of going to the nation of 
Japan. It has been a great blessing 
and comfort to me. It has been a good 
school for me. I have been taught 
things there that I never would have 
learned in any other place perhaps. 
That experience will be a benefit to me 
in the future, and I thank my brethren 
who were inspired to send me to that 
land, and I thank the Lord and my 
brethren that I have been honorably 
released. I desire to continue to labor 
for Zion and her interests. I desire to 
be a servant of God, to keep on bear- 
ing testimony, wherever I shall be 



ELDER L. A. KELSCH.

called to labor, whether it be In a ward 
capacity or in any other direction. We 
will all receive that which w e merit. I 
know this work is true. I bear testi- 
mony that this people are true, loyal 
American citizens. We love the Con- 
stitution; we love this nation; we 
love its flag 1 . We have proved this in 
the past, and we are able to prove it 
again, should it be necessary. We love 
all good, honorable men and women, 
whether they are Latter-day Saints or 
not, so much so that we are willing to 
leave our homes and all that is dear 
unto us for the purpose of carrying the 
Gospel to them. We are willing to sac- 
rifice our time and our means in the 
interest of their salvation. However, 
we should not regard it as a sacrifice. 
It is no sacrifice to be baptized, when 
we are converted. It is no sacrifice to 
pay our tithes and our offerings, when 
we are converted. So with all the prin- 
ciples of the Gospel. We love to do 
these things, because they bring us joy 
and satisfaction. 

Now, I thank my brethren for giving 
me this privilege. I rejoice in the testi- 
monies which have been borne. I love 
my brethren and sisters, and may God 
bless us and unite our hearts together, 
that we may become one in Christ 
Jesus, is my prayer in the name of 
Jesus. Amen. 



PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 

I would like to remark that Brother 
Kelsch was honorably released from his 
mission in Japan. It has been discov- 
ered that it will take very young men, 
and take them some years, too, possi- 
bly, to master the Japanese language. 
Brother Kelsch has been serving in the 
missionary field for the last Ave or six 
years, without any respite at all, and 
it was thought that he was a man too 
far advanced in years and had been 
serving too long in the missionary field 
to keep him in the Japanese mission un- 
til he could learn that language. There- 
fore, he was honorably released. 

The choir and congregation sang: 



Praise to the man who communed with 
Jehovah! 

Traitors and tyrants now fight him in 
vain. 

Benediction by Elder C. F. Middleton, 
counselor in presidency of Weber Stake

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



ELDER WM. H. SEEGMILLER, 
(President of Sevier Stake.) 

I very much appreciate the privilege 
of meeting- in this conference with my 
brethren and sisters. I have enjoyed 
myself very much in listening to the 
remarks that have been made since the 
conference began. 

I desire to add my testimony unto 
those of my brethren with reference to 
this great latter-day work. I know 
that we are engaged in the work of 
God, that the Gospel has been restored 
and that the Latter-day Saints enjoy 
its gifts and blessings. I know that 
Joseph Smith was an inspired Prophet 
of God, that he sealed his testimony 
with his blood and that his testimony 
is now in force in the earth. 

In listening to the remarks of the 
brethren this morning— although I may 
be but a new-comer in the Church as 
compared with those who gained ex- 
perience in Kirtland, Missouri and Il- 
linois, where the Saints were once lo- 
cated—when I came to consider that 
only fourteen years of the history of 
the Church had been made in Utah 
when I became identified with it, I be- 
gan to feel that I had been associated 
with it for some time myself; and as 
I think over the changes that have 
come to us as a people, I also rejoice 
and testify, as my brethren have done, 
to the knowledge that I possess that 
God has been with this community; 
that He has guided them, that He has 
directed and prospered them, and that 
they have spread out, since those days, 
until they now occupy land outside of 
the realm of the United States. I know 
that as we have prospered in the past 
so we will in the future. 

The different Stakes of Zion have 
been organized that the Latter-day 
Saints might acquire an education 
which will prepare them for coming 
events, yea, for the coming of the 
Bridegroom. There is an important 
question that confronts us as a peo- 
ple, individually: Will we be numbered 
among the wise virgins or among the 
foolish ones? It is a problem that con- 
fronts ever one of us, than which there 
is no more important subject for our 



consideration. The path of counsel, we 
have been told, is the path of virtue. 
Those who observe the counsel and 
commandments which come to us from 
time to time from those who are in- 
spired and appointed to advise the peo- 
ple, will be prepared to go forth when 
the word is sounded that "The Bride- 
groom cometh, go ye out to meet Him." 

There are grand opportunities before 
us, and I hope and trust that we will 
improve the chances and privileges that 
are ours today, that in time to come we 
and our children may stand with the 
people of God. When we look around 
we find there are names mentioned in 
the early history of the Church that we 
do not hear sounded today in the 
councils of the Elders of Israel. In 
reading the early history of the Church 
we are able to ascertain, at least in 
part, the reason for this. I hope and 
trust that we will appreciate the priv- 
ileges that are ours; that we may have 
testimonies in our hearts strong enough 
to endure everything that may beset 
our pathway in life; that our integrity 
may be great, yea, that we may value 
it more than we do life itself. 

My experience thus far in connection 
with this work of our Father is that 
the more intently I labor to advance 
His purposes in the earth the more joy, 
pleasure and contentment I have. So, 
if it is a matter of contentment and 
joy, the way to obtain it, as I under- 
stand it, is to do the will of our Father 
in heaven, so far as it is made known 
unto us. 

May the peace of heaven continue to 
be upon the Latter-day Saints; may 
this great latter-day work continue to 
grow and increase, and may it accom-' 
plish in the earth its mighty destiny; 
may we who are beginning to grow old 
in the work of our Father not become 
weary, but may we continue faithfully 
on, doing those things that may be re- 
quired at our hands, that at last we 
may gain the reward which the faith- 
ful are entitled to, and hear the glor- 
ious words, "Well done, thou good ar.d 
faithful servant; enter thou into the 
joy of thy Master." I ask it through 
Christ, our Redeemer. Amen. 



ELDER C. 

ELDER C. N. LUND, 
(President of North Sanpete Stake.) 

My dear brethren and sisters, my 
heart is filled with gTatitude to my 
heavenly Father for the opportunity 
tint I have of meeting with you here 
in conference. I have come here for 
many years to attend the conferences 
of the Latter-day Saints, held at th« 
headquarters of Zion, and I have never 
left one of them disappointed. The 
inspiration that I have received in these 
gatherings and the counsel and teach- 
ings to which I have listened have beep 
a guiding star to me through life. 

It must be a great testimony to the 
world, after having heard the Elders 
of this Church announce that we have 
a living Prophet upon the earth, as 
referred to in the hymn this afternoon, 
to ree the people gathering here by the 
thousands, from all parts of this state 
and from other states in this Union, 
and from Canada in the north and 
Mexico in the south, that they might 
receive the word of the Lord. We have 
rot come here to listen to man as man 
speaks, but we have come to receive 
the word of God through His inspired 
servants, the prophets, whom He has 
raised up to lead Israel in these latter 
days. We have gathered here to drink 
in of the inspiration of the Almighty, 
that we might receive the key-words 
for the future to guide us until we 
shall have the privilege and oppor- 
tunity of meeting here again. Such a 
gathering as this proves that we be- 
lieve what we proclaim: That God has 
T-.vlsed up a Prophet in these last days, 
and that He has ushered in the great 
and glorious dispensation of the fulness 
of times to prepare the way for the 
coming of His Son, Jesus Christ. This 
is our testimony to the world. I have 
rejoiced in listening to this testimony 
during this conference, as borne by the 
authorities of the Church, and also by 
the mission presidents, who have come 
in from the various parts of the earth. 
They have borne their testimony that 
they know that Joseph Smith was a 
Prophet of God. I was very much 
pleased to hear one of the mission presi- 
dents say that he and his fellow-labor- 
ers had been inspired to take up th:s 



/ 

N. LUND. 39 

subject in the mission field where they 
v/ere laboring — to testify of that grand 
rran and his mission to the earth. I 
have always maintained, and still 
maintain, that the most important 
thing for this generation to know is 
that God raised up the Prophet Joseph 
Smith and endowed him with the pow- 
er, authority and keys to proclaim the 
Gospel to the world for the last time, 
and that through him Christ's Church 
was restored in its original power and 
wth all its blessings. No greater mes- 
sage was given to man since the days 
of our Lord and Savior upon the earth 
1 rejoice, my brethren and sisters, to 
be numbered with you, and I thank 
G'<d with all my heart that He searched 
me out in the land that gave me birth 
and enlightened my mind with the 
truths of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, 
and that He brought me here. When 
I first came here and entered the largo 
tabernacle for the first time, I felt that 
the inspiration of God was there. I 
saw then for the first time that mighty 
man who then stood upon the earth 
as the mouthpiece of God to His peo- 
ple, President Brigham Young. I feH 
that never before, or since, for that 
matter, had I heard a man speak who 
possessed greater power than that man. 
Although I could understand but very 
little of what he said, yet I felt that 
he was indeed a Prophet of God to that 
generation, as well as Joseph Smith 
had been. I feel that all the men who 
have stood in that position since have 
been prophets of God to. this genera- 
tion; and I feel that the great man who 
stands at the head of the Church of God 
today, in whose veins flows the blood 
of the great prophet of this generation, 
is indeed a Prophet of God unto this 
people. 

May God bless Zion; may His peace 
and His Spirit be and abide with us, 
and may we enjoy its blessings and 
its inspiration, that we may know 
what to do in all things. Brethren 
End sisters, we are working for a great 
cause. During this conference I have 
been struck with the magnitude of this 
great work in which we are engaged, 
it is growing and increasing in power, 
and we can realize the truth of Daniel's 
saying, that the little stone should, in

lime, fill the whole earth. It will be 
accomplished, and God grant that it 
may, and hasten the triumph of truth 
and right in the earth, is my prayer, 
in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER MOSES W. TAYLOR. 

(President of Summit Stake.) 

My brethren and sisters, I desire an 
inteiest in your faith and prayers, that 
I may be inspired to say those things 
that will be for the best good of all of 
us. 

A little over a year ago the Prophet, 
Seer and Revslator of the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints sent 
T o my office in Salt Lake City, for ma. 
lie said to me, "We want you 
to leave your home in this 
city and go out and live in the 
Summit Stake of Zion. A few day.; 
afterwards three of the Apostles and I 
boarded the train, and we landed in 
Coalville, Summit county. When we 
got there we went to a Priesthood 
meeting, at which there was a fair 
representation of the Priesthood of the 
Stake. At this meeting these three 
Apostles disorganized the whole Stake, 
leaving out of office all the Bishops, 
with their counselors, the High Coun- 
cilors, the presidency of the Stake, and 
all the other officers of the Stake. Al- 
though I was a stranger in a strange 
land, apparently, after the Priesthood 
meeting, the same evening, before these 
three brethren boarded the train for 
home, they said to me, "Now, Moses, fix 
it up. You have got to stay here and 
fix it up." 

I did not feel that I was altogether 
alone; I went to the Lord and told Him 
that He and I were the only officers in 
the Stake now. I thought it was a good 
thing to go in partners with the Lord; 
He has been good partner to me — the 
best I have ever had. He has blessed 
me in my labors; for out there in the 
tops of the mountains, on the little 
streams in Summit county, I found some 
of the best people I ever met in my life. 
We have been trying to raise some ap- 
ples out there in that cold country, and 
at our Priesthood meeting, held a week 
ago, we made such a fine showing that 



everyone that tasted them said they 
were better than any they had ever 
eaten. I said the apples were like the 
land, and water and the air.that every- 
thing w r as good there, even the people. 
With the aid of Apostle Smoot and the 
inspiration of the Lord, we went 
through the Stake and selected a Bish- 
opric for each of the eighteen wards; 
we also selected a High Council. Our 
main desire in choosing these brethren 
was that they should be men who set a 
good example. When I went out to se- 
lect counselors for myself my first 
thought and my prayer to my heavenly 
Father was that I might be led to men 
that set an example worthy of emula- 
tion. I was led to the homes of two 
brethren who, with their families, w T ere 
observing the Word of Wisdom and 
paying their tithing. This requirement 
was made of all the brethren; so, when 
we got through we had men who weie 
observing these principles and who 
knew that Joseph Smith was a Prophet 
of God. Of course, we had to take some 
men who w^ere using tobacco and tell 
them to stop it; and I bear testimony 
to the people assembled here in con- 
ference that out of the hundreds of offi- 
cers chosen to preside in any capacity 
in that Stake, of whom the requirement 
was made, it has not been impossible 
for any one of them to keep the Word 
of Wisdom. Those who have been in 
the habit of breaking the Word of Wis- 
dom, all the way from six to ninety-two 
years of age, have been able to quit 
that course. They have said to me 
that the Lord had taken away from 
them the desire for such things. I want- 
ed to bear my testimony to you with 
regard to this thing, because wherever 
we go among the Latter-day Saints we 
find people who say they cannot quit 
tobacco, or "I cannot quit tea and cof- 
fee, as I would have a headache all day 
long if I did," and all such excuses. 
Hundreds of the people of the Summit 
Stake could bear the same testimony — 
that they have been able to leave off the 
use of these unwholesome things and 
observe the Word of Wisdom. The rea- 
son they have been able to do this, 
brethren and sisters, is because they 
have taken the Lord In as a partner 
with them. They have all said that. 



ELDER MOSES W. TAYLOR. 



41 



with the help of the Lord, they would 
do this thing. 

Now, I believe that the people out 
there area good people to make sacri- 
fices; I can testify to this. Some people 
get the notion that the ward they live 
in is the only ward in the Church. We 
have been endeavoring to get the people 
to discard this selfish idea and to be 
more liberal and broadminded. 

We went after some of the Stakes 
adjoining us last summer, and, with 
them, got together on the water ques- 
tion. We decided to aid and assist one 
another in our distress. During the 
dryest part of the season the people 
of the lower counties sent word to the 
Saints of Summit Stake asking if they 
would not turn down the water. They 
said they realized that it was the driest 
part of the season and that the people 
of Summit Stake needed the water for 
their own lands, but that they felt to 
appeal to them for aid. In response to 
this appeal every ditch in the county 
was closed for eight days, and immedi- 
ately afterwards the Saints of Morgan 
county did the same thing; so the peo- 
ple below were blessed. Later in the 
season some of the Bishops, and other 
prominent men of our Stake, came to 
me and said, "Brother Taylor, though 
the water was taken from our lands, 
still our crops are abundant. The Lord 
has blessed us for our sacrifice." Breth- 
ren and sisters, I tell you that where a 
spirit like that is exhibited the Lord 
cannot withhold His blessings. 

While on this subject I should say 
that grain, cows, horses, sheep, money, 
and all those things, are not always 
blessed. There are two kinds of 
money, one kind carries with it 
the blessings of the Lord, the oth- 
er carries with it the blight of 
the prince of darkness. A man came 
to me recently and said that he had 
sons who, in their youth, worked faith- 
fully with him; the Lord blessed him 
with means, and these sons grew up* 
and became good and honorable men 
in the community. "Now," said he, "I 
have other sons growing up; they are 
different from the first; they are un- 
governable, and I can do nothing with 
them." I could have told him the 



cause of the difference between these 
sons: When his older sons were grow- 
ing up he was paying his tithes and 
offerings, attending his meetings and 
performing his other duties, and these 
sons grew up under a good influence; 
his money and increase had the bless- 
ings of God UDon it. But conditions 
changed. He got into trouble with 
his Bishop and the president of his 
Stake, and finally left the Church. His 
other sons came along, but they grew 
up under a different influence. They 
were proud of their gain, and were 
using this money, which looked the 
same as the other, but which had the 
blight upon it and was a curse to 
them; while, on the other hand, it had 
been a blessing to their father and 
their other brothers. May the Lord 
add His blessings to all, which I ask 
in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

Elder Melvin J. Ballard, of Logan, 
then sang a solo, the choir joining in 
the chorus. 



ELDER JAMES W. PAXMAN. 
(President of Juab Stake.) 

My beloved brethren and sisters, I 
feel very much in need of your faith 
and prayers and the assistance of the 
Spirit during the few moments I shall 
stand before you this afternoon. 

I deem it a great privilege to have 
the opportunity of meeting with the 
congregations of Israel in general Con- 
ference, and to hear the voice of in* 
spiration, which has been sounded in 
our ears not only during this glorious 
conference, but also during the con- 
ferences that have preceded it. I was 
thinking, in listening to the remarks 
of Brothers Seegmiller and Lund, that 
it had been my good fortune to meet 
with the Saints in Conference ever 
since I was a boy in my teens. I have 
not missed a conference of the Church, 
since my boyhood, except when I was 
out of the state. In\hese Conferences 
I can truthfully say that I have felt the 
influence of the Spirit of God. This 
conference has been no exception to 
the others in this regard; if there is 
any difference, I think I see more vigor 



42 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



and strength in the testimony of my 
brethren at this Conference. 

I rejoice to know that we live in a 
day and ag-e of the world in which 
the Gospel has been fully established 
in the earth in its primitive purity and 
grandeur, with men inspired of God and 
raised up to take charge of His work 
in the earth and to direct His people 
aright. I feel grateful that it has been 
my lot to have the still small voice in 
my soul, so that the cry of the shep- 
herd has found a response. I felt thank- 
ful to hear the testimony of Apostle 
Reed Smoot this morning, when he 
said he felt that he was in accord with 
those that presided over him, and all 
the members of the Church, as well as 
the principles and doctrines of the 
Gospel. I thought that was a most 
happy state to be in. I feel to join 
with him in the joy and pleasure ex- 
pressed by him in this glorious testi- 
mony. L. too, feel that the Lord has 
been kind to me and has been my 
friend. I know that He will be an ever- 
lasting friend to the children of men, 
inasmuch as they seek unto Him with 
full purpose of heart, and no one will 
seek Him in vain. I rejoice in the 
principles of the Gospel, because I see 
in them the virtue to redeem this fallen 
world. I rejoice in the testimony our 
Elders are able to bear, and are bear- 
ing, to the nations of the earth. I 
feel grateful and proud that the same 
spirit possesses all our Elders and mis- 
sion presidents abroad in the earth. I 
rejoice that the Spirit of the Lord is 
being shed forth upon His people and 
that they are being made glad because 
of its effulgence. I feel that there is 
an abiding growth with the members 
of the Church; that those active and 
interested in the work are growing 
stronger and more firmly fixed in the 
faith; that the Church and kingdom 
of God has been established in the 
earth never to be thrown down or given 
Ho another people. I feel grateful that 
it has been my lot and privilege to be 
born and reared in Zion; that the 
Lord has given unto me a good pa- 
rentage; that my father devoted his 
life, time and talents, as well as his 
means, to the building up of the king- 
dom of God; that he was willing to 



make sacrifices for the Gospel's sake. 
Though the world may consider as a 
sacrifice what he did, yet it was no 
sacrifice to him. 

I feel to testify to the words of my 
brethren, that those that pay their 
tithes and offerings will be blessed 
of the Lord. The blessings of 
heaven are more to us than the bless- 
ings of the earth. My admonition 
to the people lately has been not to 
measure the blessings of our Father 
in heaven by dollars and cents. If 
adversity comes upon us, as it has in 
our section of the country, on account 
of the continued drouth, and we are 
short in our crops, we should not at- 
tribute the shortage to a curse of the 
Lord; but, rather, we should feel grate- 
ful to the Lord for the Gospel and for 
the many blessings that we enjoy. 1 
feel that the hand of God is over us 
when we are chastened and reduced in 
our jonditions, for then we are more 
humble and prayerful and devoted to 
the work of God. 

I feel proud of the little stake of 
Zion over which it has been my lot to 
preside, Four years ago this month my 
father met with an accident, and gave 
up the ghost shortly afterwards. Not 
long after I was called to preside over 
the stake. I can truthfully say that wt 
have had pleasure in our work there. 
Now, Brother Moses W. Taylor has told 
you of the goodness of the people of his 
stake and of the valor of the men that 
are associated with him. I can testify 
to like conditions in the Juab stake. I 
do not know of two better men in the 
whole stake than those who are asso- 
ciated with me as my counselors; and I 
can say the same as to the High Coun. 
cil. We are all united, and are paying 
our tithes and keeping the "Word of 
"Wisdom. The auxiliary organizations 
of the stake have never been in a bet- 
ter condition than they are new in. 

I testify to you that I know that Jo- 
seph Smith was and is a Prophet of 
God. I do not know this simply be- 
cause my parents have told me so or 
taught me this, as President Ben E. 
Rich, of the Southern States mission, 
said yesterday, but I know it through 
that Spirit that comes from above, to 
which we are all entitled, providing, of 



ELDER JOSEPH MORRELL. 



43 



course, that we are living- right. I 
testify to you in all soberness, recog- 
nizing that I will have to meet my tes- 
timony before the judgment bar of 
God, yet I testify that, as I knew tht, 
sun would rise this morning when 1 
saw the danvn of day approaching ovet 
the eastern horizon, so do I know that 
the Savior is coming. The Lord has 
said that He would come and dwell 
with His people a thousand years and 
instruct them in His word, and that it 
would be a reign of peace. I kno-w 
these conditions are coming; the Spirit 
of God, through the voice of inspiration, 
distills on my soul this great truth. 1 
feel to rejoice that the Lord has given 
me this testimony, which came to me 
•as a shaft of light, filling my whole 
being and fastening me to the rock of 
truth. May God enable us to endure to 
the end and receive His blessings, is 
my prayer, in the name .of Jesus. Amen. 



ELDER JOSEPH MORRELL. 
(President of Cache Stake.) 

I have only one desire, my brethren 
and sisters, in standing before you at 
this time, and that is that the Spirit of 
the Lord will direct me in what I shall 
say, that we may be mutually edified. 

I have a testimony of the Gospel, 
which I bear to you this afternoon. I 
have always taken pleasure in uphold- 
ing and sustaining the testimony that 
God has given me that Joseph Smith ib 
a Prophet of God, and that he was 
raised up in these latter days to bring 
forth the dispensation of the fulness ot 
times, and that he was an instrument 
in the hands of God in bringing forth 
those principles that are the power of 
God unto salvation. What desires 1 
have had so far in life have been swal- 
lowed up in the testimony that I have 
received of the goodness of my Hea- 
venly Father to me.I have been willing, 
in my ■weak way, to answer the callss 
that have been made of me, and there- 
lore am I here this afternoon. 

In lisiening to the testimonies thai 
were borne this morning, I was think- 
ing over xhe changes that had taken 
place in the Cache Stake of Zion since 
I have been connected with it. Our 



stake ustd to be about the largest in 
the Church, extending from Paradise, 
in the south, to Cardston, Canada, in 
the north; but, piece by piece it has 
been divided up, and new stakes form- 
ed. To jay our stake is about ten miles 
long and eight or nine miles wide. But 
if our stake is small it is pretty thick- 
ly settled, and the people are good. 
They desire to do what they can to as- 
sist in building up the kingdom of our 
Father upon the earth. I can testify 
to you, my brethren and sisters, that 
my counselors, and the High Council of 
the stake, and all the other authorities, 
are faithful and energetic men. Our 
stake has contributed some of its best 
young men to assist in building up 
other stakes of Zion. Two of the 
brethren who spoke this morning 
were reared in our stake. They 
are now presidents of other 
stakes of Zion. The land has 
been taken up and so utilized that, 
in the past, it has been hard for our 
young men to get a home in our sec- 
tion of the country, as under the con- 
ditions that prevailed then it required 
quite a large farm to bring in anything. 
But, through the blessings of the Lord, 
we now have a sugar factory and the 
land can be utilized to greater advan- 
tage and profit, and, in consequence, we 
are enabled to keep our boys and girls 
at home. The girls go out in the field 
and help with the beets, which I think 
is a great blessing to them, as they can 
thus get plenty of fresh air and exer- 
cise. They are growing up puny; they 
are not as strong as their mothers 
were, who bore the heat and burden of 
the day. It will be a good thing for 
them to get out a little instead of sit- 
ting so much in the house. 

We have no very rich people in our 
Stake, as the farms are small; but some 
of the Saints are quite well to do. 
Since the beginning the land has been 
divided into small parcels, and there is 
not much chance for any one to own 
large tracts of land, as our Stake is so 
small. The last few years we have 
taken hold of manufacturing a little, 
as well as the raising of beets, and we 
have so divided our interests that if we 
should fail in one pursuit we would 
have another to fall back on. 



44 



GENERAL, CONFERENCE. 



We have continually counseled the 
people to keep out of debt. It has been 
our experience, in associating- among 
the people, and in our own lives, that 
if we can get a few dollars ahead, and 
pay the tithing on it, and thus get the 
blessings of our heavenly Father to at- 
tend our investments, that that money 
went much farther than the money we 
borrowed, upon which we had to pay a 
high rate of interest. It nas been truth- 
fully said here this afternoon that 
money and the accumulation of wealth 
is not the only blessing that God has 
in store for us. He has said that if we 
neglect to pay our tithes and offerings 
our names will be taken from the rec- 
ords of the Church, and the names of 
our children as well. I would rather lose 
every dollar and every piece of prop- 
erty that I possess than to have this 
calamity come upon me. Christ gave 
this parable unto His Disciples: 

"The ground of a certain rich man 
brought forth plentifully: 

"And he thought within himself, say- 
ing, What shall I do, because I have nc 
room where to bestow my fruits? 

"And he said, This will I do: I will 
pull down my barns, and build greater, 
and there will I bestow all my fruits 
and my goods. 

"And I will say to my soul, Soul, thou 
bast much goods laid up for many 
years; take thine ease, eat, drink, and 
be merry. 

"But God said unto him, Thou foo 1 
this night thy soul shall be required of 
thee: Then whose shall those things 
be, which thou hast provided? 

"So is he that layeth up treasure for 
himself, and is not rich toward God." 

I feel well, my brethren and sister •. 
I do not know what I ever did that the 
Lord should be so kind to me. I have 
Leen a weak instrument in His hands 
and have endeavored to put my trust in 
Him. I pray that His Spirit may be 
with us all, that in the end we may be 
saved in His kingdom. Amen. 

ELDER 'GEORGE C. PARKINSON, 

(President of Oneida Stake.) 

My brethren and sisters, I have lis- 
tened with much pleasure to the re ■ 
marks of the brethren during this con- 



ference. I rejoice in the testimony of 
my brethren, and that I have the privi- 
T ege of associating with the Latter-day 
Saints at these meetings. 

The Oneida Stake is located in the 
northern part of Cache Valley, in the 
State of Idaho. It was organized over 
eighteen years ago, with eleven wards 
and about 3,000 souls. Since that time 
many changes have taken place. The 
people increased in number as the pos 
Abilities of the country became better 
known. We had a large tract of 
:and, and as the country was built up 
other wards were organized and several 
new Stakes were made. As the Stake 
exists today we have seventeen wards 
a id a population of about 6,000 Latter 
oay Saints. The presidency of the 
Stake are united and are laboring in 
hf rmony with each other. The mem- 
bers of the High Council of the Stake 
are good men. They all keep the Word 
of Wisdom, I think, and are devoting 
their time and attention to the minis- 
try. They meet once a month, as a 
High Council, and attend to any busi- 
ness that may come before them. Most 
of them visit the various wards of the 
Stake on Sundays, and also on othe'* 
days, keeping up the organizations anJ 
encouraging the Saints in the work of 
T he Lord. I believe the wards are all 
thoroughly organized, and that the 
Bishops and their Counselors are all 
ifood, exemplary men, actively engaged 
in the midst of the people. We try 'o 
impress upon them the necessity of 
looking after those bearing the Lesser 
Priesthood, that they might be trained 
and prepared for higher and greater re- 
sponsibilities as they grow in years and 
faithfulness. I believe the quorums of 
lhe Priesthood are pretty well taken 
care of. Of course, we also have some 
who are negligent and careless, as m^y 
be found in other Stakes and organiza- 
t.ons of the Church. Our Seven- 
ties are nearly all active men, 
engaged in the ministry. We ca!l 
them into service as home mission 
aries, to labor with the Elders and 
High Priests, in connection with the 
members of the High Council of the 
Stake, and they are seeking to edify 
the Saints and to encourage them in 
their duties. 



ELDER GEORGE J. CANNON.

I rejoice, my brethren and sisters, in 
the testimony which the Lord has giv- 
en to me. I know that God lives and 
that Jesus Christ is His Son and the 
Redeemer of mankind. I know that 
Joseph Smith is a Prophet of God, and 
that he was raised up of God to estab- 
lish the Gospel of Jesus Christ upon the 
earth for the last time. He delivered 
the message, and it has gone forth to 
the nations of the earth, and it shall be 
proclaimed to all nations, kindreds, 
tongues and peoples upon the face of 
the earth. I know that Brigham Young 
was a Prophet of God, and that he was 
raised up to lead the people of God 
from the land of their persecutions and 
drivings to this promised place in the 
tops of the mountains, according to the 
will of God, made known through His 
Prophet Joseph Smith. I also have a 
testimony that John Taylor was a 
Prophet of the Lord, loved of God, and 
that he labored devotedly in the minis- 
try for the establishment of the work 
of the Lord. I can bear the same tes- 
timony as to President Wilford Wood- 
ruff and President Lorenzo Snow, who 
were good and noble men, and Prophets 
of God. I know that, today, we have 
to preside over the Church as Prophet, 
Seer and Revelator, a noble son of God, 
one recognized of the Lord as His ser- 
vant to preside over His Church in all 
the world; that these brethren who are 
associated with the Presidency of the 
Church, the Apostles, whose labors call 
them to the several Stakes of Zion and 
the different parts of the earth, are the 
servants of the Lord. I know that they 
enjoy the revelations of the Holy Spir- 
it, and that they are special witnesses, 
traveling among the people and bear- 
ing a faithful testimony to the divinity 
of the work of the Lord as restored 
and established in our day. 

My desire is to go onward and up- 
ward, and to do what little 1 may be 
able to do, under the blessings of the 
Almighty. I desire not to grow weary 
or to become discouraged, but I feel like 
lifting up my voice in defense of the 
truth and the establishment of right- 
eousness in the midst of the people. 

I am associated with a good people, 
who are devoted to the work of the 



Lord. We have an excellent school in 
our midst, at which within a month 
from now, perhaps, we will have about 
fifty young men engaged in the mis- 
sionary class, preparing to go into the 
world and proclaim the Gospel. We 
have organized our auxiliary associ- 
ations, and they are presided over by 
men and women who are devoted to 
the work in which they are engaged. 

In listening to the testimonies of 
Apostles Smoot and Woodruff this 
morning my heart warmed within my 
bosom, and I thank God for such men. 
I thank Him that His inspiration has 
been poured out, and is now being 
poured out, upon these young men, who 
have been called to this active posi- 
tion in the ministry. They are men of 
God, and I know it. I have associated 
with them to quite an extent during 
the past few years, and I know that 
they are true, genuine, and faithful, 
and that they live in the love and con- 
fidence of God, and that His blessings 
are following their ministrations in the 
midst of the people. May God bless 
them, and all who are engaged in His 
glorious cause, that it may spread 
abroad through the earth; that the 
honest in heart may be gathered out 
and assembled in the tops of the moun- 
tains and in other places appointed of 
the Lord for the gathering of His peo- 
ple, is my prayer, in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 

Brother and Sister Ferrin of Ogden 
sang a duet. 



ELDER GEORGE J. CANNON. 

My dear brethren and sisters, it was 
a great surprise to me when Brother 
Woodruff called out my name; it was 
the last thing I expected. Neverthe- 
less, I can testify to you, as I have to 
my brethren and sisters and others, 
when the opportunity has presented it- 
self, that I know that the Gospel of 
Jesus Christ has been restored to the 
earth again, and that we are the recip- 
ients of its blessings. Before leaving 
for my mission to Germany, I, with the 



46 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



rest, received instructions, and we were 
told that if we could not say anything 
else in arising to speak to the people, 
we were to bear our testimonies and 
something would come to us. There- 
fore, in addressing you this afternoon 
I begin with bearing my testimony. My 
brethren and sisters, I have a testi- 
mony, and have always had it, that the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ is true. If we 
take the scriptures and compare the 
Gospel taught therein with the Gospel 
taught by the Latter-day Saints, we 
find that they are the same; that the 
Gospel taught by the Savior and 
His disciples in former days is 
identical with that taught by the 
Latter-day Saints. Those of us who 
have had the privilege of preaching the 
Gospel in the world have had numerous 
testimonies given to us, which have 
strengthened us in the testimony that 
we already possessed. I believe there 
is not a young man who goes out into 
the world to preach the Gospel that 
does not possess a testimony, although 
he may say he does not have one. He 
may not be aware of the fact, but the 
testimony is there just the same; it 
is born in him and only needs some- 
thing to bring it out. We find that 
our young men, some of whom may 
have been careless at home, when they 
have reached their missionary field 
and, perhaps, have been put in charge 
of some branch, or placed to preside 
over a conference, and are obliged to 
explain the principles of the Gospel and 
to study them, are surprised and as- 
tonished to learn that they have had 
a testimony of the Gospel but did not 
know it. I would advise the young 
brethren and sisters to become ac- 
quainted with this testimony before 
they go on their missions, because 
they will then be just that much fur- 
ther ahead, and they will be better 
prepared to explain the principles of 
the Gospel. We are told, in the 130th 
section of the Doctrine and Covenants, 
a passage that I love to quote, that 
"Whatever principles of intelligence we 
attain unto in this life, it will rise with 
us in the resurrection; 

"And if a person gains more knowl- 
edge and intelligence in this life 
through his diligence and obedience 



than another, he will have so much the 
advantage in the world to come. 

"There is a law, irrevocably decreed 
in heaven before the foundations of this 
world, upon which all blessings are 
predicated; 

"And when we obtain any blessing 
from God it is by obedience to that law 
upon which it is predicated." 

This should be an encouragement to 
us as Latter-day Saints — that through 
our obedience in this life,if we are more 
industrious and studious than another 
in seeking knowledge, we will have that 
much the advantage of him in the 
world to come. I trust that we, es- 
pecially the young and rising genera- 
tion, upon whose shoulders the further- 
ance of the kingdom of God, rests, will 
sense and appreciate the importance 
of this principle, and that, through our 
diligence, we will advance to a high de=*- 
gree of perfection. 

I pray that the blessings of our Heav- 
enly Father will rest upon us. I testi- 
fy to you in all soberness and humility 
that we are engaged in the work of 
God, and that, if we are faithful in the 
performance of our duties, He will 
bless us. I can testify that the law 
of tithing and the Word of Wisdom 
are true principles. I have always ob- 
served the former principle, and have 
also kept the Word of Wisdom; I was 
taught to do so by my parents, and I 
appreciate the blessings to be derived 
therefrom, for I have experienced them. 
May the blessings of our Heavenly Fa- 
ther rest upon us all, I ask it in the 
name of our Savior, Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 



ELDER REED SMOOT. 

How to get out of debt — Economy a righteous 
principle — Admonition to save wheat. 

Perhaps the greater number of the 
people here this afternoon were in the 
Tabernacle this mottling, when I spoke 
upon the subject of keeping out of debt. 
Since that meeting a brother has asked 
me how to keep out of debt, and there 
may be quite a number of this congre- 
gation that would like to ask the same 
question. Brethren and sisters, I can 
tell you in a few words how to get out, 
and how to keep out of debt; it is in-

deed simple and is this: Stop the waste 
that so many people are practising-, 
save a little every day from your earn- 
ings, and it will not be long until you 
are out of debt, and if you will do this 
you will never get into debt. I consid- 
er it is a sin in the sight of God to 
waste anything that He has created, 
either in its original state or changed 
by the labor of man. The uld saying 
"Waste not, want not," is just as true 
today as it ever was. It is gratifying 
to read the history of the different na- 
tions and learn that many great men, 
by their personal examples and lives, 
demonstrated that they were enemies 
to waste in every form. In reading of 
Dante, who was the most radical 
against waste in his day, we find that 
he classifies the spendthrift in the same 
circle as the miser, thinking the mirer 
would surely go to hell and the spend- 
thrift would be his close neighoor. 
Dante had the Middle Age idea of hell, 
not knowing the limited number of 
crimes that will keep a man there 
eternally. By revelation, we know that 
the only crimes man will be placed in 
hell for is committing the unpardonable 
sin, knowing the Christ and then deny- 
ing Him; or shedding innocent blood. 

Man never will go to hell for saving 
means, even if miserly. No man ever 
lived that looked more carefully into 
household expenses than did George 
Washington, the father of our country. 
Many of his servants thought him 
penurious, and that he should give at- 
tention to greater matters, not be look- 
ing after small things and petty sav- 
ings. My brethren and sisters, there 
are many who look upon a man that 
saves as stingy, and think that he is 
thus doing a wrong, but I assure you 
that is not true. I have always insist- 
ed that under all circumstances and 
conditions economy is necessary. You 
will find that it is necessary in every 
condition of life, whether the man be 
a millionaire or the humblest and poor- 
est soul that walks the face of the 
earth; economy, not in dollars and cents 
only, but it also relates to the use of 
time, one of God's gifts that He will 
hold us all responsible for. Watch ev- 
ery expenditure, and see that nothing 
is wasted. I remember reading an inci- 



dent in the life of Carlyle, the man who 
said he overcame the two jailors of the 
human family — "low birth and an iron 
fortune," — proving that he was indeed 
an economist. One day he was cross- 
ing a street in one of the large cities of 
Scotland, with a companion, and stoop- 
ing down picked something from the 
mud. He stepped to the sidewalk, ai;d 
brushed the mud from a piece of bread, 
laid it on the curb, remarking to his 
friend that it might do a dog or bird 
some good. , I want to say, my brethi-:n 
and sisters, that the great Scotchman 
was an enemy to waste, and his life 
was an example of economy. He was 
taught by his mother never to waste a 
crumb of bread, said he, "mother im- 
pressed me with the fact that bread 
was to man what the mind is to the 
soul." I am indeed thankful that the 
mother who gave me birth taught r. >e 
that principle, and I earnestly wish 
that every Latter-day Saint had it im- 
pressed upon them so they will prac- 
tise economy in their lives. Not long 
ago I was in one of the stakes of Zion, 
and a young man complained to me 
how hard it was to get along financial- 
ly. He asked me to go home with him 
to dinner. I did so. On going co the 
back of his residence after dinner, I 
found enough good food thrown into a 
swill-barrel to feed another family; and 
yet he was wondering why he could not 
make ends meet. 

In the early days of Utah, the voice 
•of President Brigham Young rang out 
warning the people to be saving, and 
not waste anything that God in His 
goodness had given them. I say the 
same to you, with all my heart; and I 
wish our people would stop and think 
about it, and use the intellect that God 
has given them. I tell you, if they 
would do this there would be less suf- 
fering from poverty among us. I was 
in the north a couple of weeks ago, 
and saw trainloads of wheat being 
shipped from the state. What does this 
mean? It means, if not stopped, that a 
great portion of the amount of wheat 
being shipped at the present time may 
have to be brought back into Utah, and 
the people thus have to pay freight 
charges going out and coming in, and 
a middleman's profit besides. Farmers

of Utah, is this the way to do? Why, 
no! How often have we heard the 
Prophets of the Church, in times past, 
tell the people to store their wheat. Just 
as sure as we live the time will come 
when we will wish we had followed that 
advice, and stored at least enough to 
last us from one harvest to another. 
Brethren and sisters, for your own 
sakes, save enough wheat and keep it 
on hand so that we can have bread 
stuff in case of any unforeseen contin- 
gency that may arise. 

Suppose a great strike had occurred 
on all the railroads of the United 
States last year, every wheel tied up, 
and every avenue for carrying freight 
to this intermountain country had been 
stopped, either by strike or through any 
other cause, in what condition would we 
have been? Do you know that flour 
and wheat were shipped last year into 
Sanpete county, once called the gran- 
ary of Utah? Do you think that such a 
thing could have happened if the Saints 
were following the advice of the Proph- 
ets of God? No, never! I ask the peo- 
ple to remember this, for I tell you, in 
the name of J.esus Christ, you will see 
the wisdom of it some day. God wants 
His people to be prepared for the com- 
ing judgments. Peace be to you all, 1 
ask in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER ABRAHAM O. WOODRUFF, 

Blessing-i In disguise — Dogo.nl to all mankind. — 
Forbearance to the Ignorant and wayward. 

My beloved brethren and sisters. I 
tried to handle a subject this morning 
in five minutes, and there are about two 
minutes left this afternoon. I wish to 
say just a few words, and I will try 
to get through in time for us to get out 
of here by 4 o'clock. I not only believe 
in beginning our meetings on time, but 
in quitt'.og on time as well. 

Many sections of the country nvhere 
our people are located have been suf- 
fering greatly through drouth during 
the past few years. I have thought over 
this condition a great deal, and have 
come to the conclusion that, for my 
part, I feel to thank God for the drouth 
as well as for the many blessings which 
He tends to us that are not in disguise. 
If it had not been for the grasshoppers, 



crickets and drouth in early days the 
Latter-day Saints would have been 
crowded out of their strongholds and 
places by those who would have de- 
sired to locate in our communities. 
Now, I can see the hand of God even 
in these trials, which come to us as 
blessings in disguise. Those Latter- 
day Saints who have faith in God will 
outwear the drouth and live to see 
their lands become fruitful, while those 
who are weak-kneed, who possess little 
faith, will be driven out by the drouth. 
Only those who are true to God and 
determined, through their faithfulness, 
to call down His blessings upon them, 
will bf there to see conditions change 
and their land become fruitful again; 
for it will become fruitful again just 
as sure as the Lord lives. 

Now. our mission, brethren and sis- 
ters, is to all mankind. We have heard 
much good instruction during this con- 
ference, and it will be of great benefit 
to us if we will put it into practice. 
Let us not be selfish and feel that it 
is our duty to devote our life and time 
to our immediate family circle and our 
friends and favorites only. We, as 
Saints of God, who have received the 
Gospel of +he Lord Jesus Christ, must 
be broad enough to let our life extend 
to all mankind. It does not lessen that 
Avhich we have to bestow upon our fam- 
ily and loved ones to extend a hand 
to all mankind, to those who are not 
of our faith; for there are many hon- 
orable men and women who have not 
been abie to see as you and I see. There 
is a place for every one. There 
is a place for the young people who 
have been born of Latter-day Saint 
parentage who have no testimony of the 
Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. It is a 
mistake, when we see young men and 
young women who do not have a testi- 
mony of the truth, to point them out 
and say. or feel, that they have com- 
mitted some moral evil and, as a con- 
sequence, have no testimony that this is 
the work of God. Those who possess a 
testimony of the truth have reason t.o 
be thankfdl indeed, for what a glori- 
ous thing it is. and how unhappy and 
uneasy are those who do not possess 
such a testimony and who are in doubt 
regarding the Gospel and the existence

of God and the atoning blood of oui 
Lord and Master, Jesus Christ. We 
may fell thankful, my brethren and sis- 
ters, that we have this testimony, and 
we ought not to point our fingers at 
those who have no testimony and feel 
that they are to be condemned on this 
account. Probably the circumstances 
of their rearing differed from ours; 
probably the Gospel has never been 
presented to them with such force and 
spirit and in such plainness as it was 
to us. I realize that the Lord told His 
liEciples to go into all the world and 
preach the Gospel to every creature, 
and that those who would repent and 
be baptized r-hould be saved, and those 
who believed not should be damned; 
but it is the Lord's business to damn 
5r to bless His sons and daughters and 
lot mine or yours. The Lord has 
commanded this people to forgive all 
nen for their trespasses, and He would 
iorgive whomsoever He would. Re- 
nember this in your troubles and dif- 
iculties in your dealings with your fel- 
owmen. 

May the spirit of this conference and 
)f this meeting go with you to the 
lomes of the Saints, and may we be 
nore determined to serve God and keep 
His commandments; I ask it in the 
lame of Jesus. Amen. 

The choir sang, "But in the last days 
t will come to pass." 

Benediction by Elder Nephi L. Morris. 

AFTERNOON SESSION. 

The choir sang the anthem: "The 
mountain of the Lord's house." 

Prayer by Elder Hugh S. Gowans, 
president of Tooele Stake. 

The anthem, "Praise the Lord, all ye 
nations," was sung by the choir. 

ELDER RUDGER CLAWSON. 

ATords inspired by the Holy Spirit are Scripture- 
Need for giving heed to such words— Callings 
in the Priesthood must be magnified— Willing 
obedience. 

I have greatly rejoiced in the spirit 
)f this conference. We are assembled 
lere, a mighty host of Israel, gathered 
ogether from all parts of Zion. We 
lave with us the First Presidency, 



members of the quorum of the Twelve 
Apostles, the presiding Patriarch, the 
Seven Presidents of Seventies, the pre- 
siding Bishopric. We have Patriarchs, 
High Priests, Seventies, Elders, bear- 
ers of the lesser Priesthood, and mem- 
bers of the Church in great numbers, 
who have come up to wait upon the 
Lord. The heathen would say per- 
haps: "We have our gods before us. 
We can see and feel them, and we fall 
down and worship them. But where is 
your god?" The answer is that our 
God is not far away, and certainly He 
is not beyond the bounds of time and 
space; but He is a God who hath ears 
to hear, eyes to see, and a mouth with 
which He can speak to His people. 

We may get a general idea of the 
character of this work and of this great 
general conference by the revelations 
of God which have been given to us in 
this age of the world. Upon one occa- 
sion, in speaking through the Prophet 
Joseph Smith to Oliver Cowdery, the 
Lord said: 

"If thou art led at any time by the 
Comforter to speak or teach, or at all 
times by the way of commandment un- 
to the church, thou mayest do it. 

"But thou shalt not write by way of 
commandment, but by wisdom; 

"And v thou shalt not command him 
who is at thy head, and at the head of 
the church; 

"For I have given him the keys of 
the mysteries.and the revelations which 
are sealed, until I shall appoint unto 
them another in his stead." 

Upon another occasion the Lord said: 

"Hearken, O ye my servants! Ye are 
rot sent forth to be taught, but to teach 
those things which have been put into 
your hands by the power of my spirit; 
and ye are to be taught from on high. 

"Sanctify yourselves, and you shall be 
endowed with power that ye may give 
even as I have spoken." 

Again, the Lord in a revelation to Or- 
son Hyde, speaking of the manner in 
which the Gospel should be preached to 
the world, said: 

"And behold, and lo, this is an en- 
sample unto all those who were ordained 
unto this Priesthood, whose mission is 
appointed unto them to go forth; 

"And this is the ensample unto them, 
that they shall speak as they are moved 
upon by the Holy Ghost. 

"And whatsoever they shall speak 
when moved upon by the Holy Ghost, 
shall be scripture, shall be the will of 
the Lord, shall be the mind of the Lord.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



shall be the word of the Lord, shall be 
the voice of the Lord, and the power 
of God unto salvation. 

"Behold, this is the promise of the 
Lord unto you, O ye my servants." 

We can see by this, my brethren and 
sisters, how great is the responsibility 
resting upon us in this important con- 
ference. If the Presidency of the 
Church and others who may be called 
upon, shall arise before the congrega- 
tions of the Saints and speak by the 
voice of the Comforter, it is the will of 
the Lord unto us, and we are in duty 
bound to receive it. How much will we 
be benefitted by assembling together? 
Just so far as we lend a willing ear to 
the counsels which are given. During 
the conference possibly many princi- 
ples of interest and importance will be 
touched upon. The law of tithing has 
been mentioned here; you may hear 
something further in relation to it. Is 
there need of such instruction? Verily 
there is. I presume there has not been 
a general conference convened for the 
last 60 years at which this principle has 
not been alluded to, and specific in- 
structions given the Latter-day Saints. 
I grant you that there are many in the 
Church who are honest with the Lord, 
and who come up to the spirit of the 
law; but there are many who do not 
pay a full tithing— many who sit under 
the voice of the Priesthood, which is 
the mind and the will of the Lord, and 
go straightway from the meeting or the 
conference and fail to give heed there- 
to. It may be that the Word of Wis- 
dom will be touched upon, and the im- 
portance of its observance set before 
the people. Is there need of this? Will 
somebody ask why is this principle 
again spoken of. Verily, it is not the 
word of man; it is the word of God to 
His people; and so long as it goes un- 
observed by any number of the Latter- 
day Saints there is need to speak of it. 
It may be that a word or two of coun- 
sel will be given in relation to magnify- 
ing the Priesthood. Is there need of 
such word? I ask the High Priests. 
Seventies, Elders, and the lesser Priest- 
hood, is there need of something being 
said concerning the authority and pow- 
er and sacred character of the Holy 
Priesthood? You know that there are 
many who disregard the Priesthood; 



many who fail to attend their quorum 
meetings, and consequently fail to catch 
the spirit of the Priesthood. Only about 
fifty per cent of those who bear the 
Priesthood are faithful in attending 
their quorum meetings, which have 
been appointed by the Lord, under the 
counsel and direction of the First Pres- 
idency of the Church. The brethren of 
these various orders of the Priesthood 
should meet together often, to bear 
testimony one to another and to be in- 
structed in their duties, that they may 
exercise this sacred power for the salva- 
tion of souls. If any man or woman 
enters into the celestial kingdom of 
God, it will be by and through the au- 
thority of the Holy Priesthood. If we 
do not hold that Priesthood, and mag- 
nify it, we cannot pass by the angels 
and the gods. It may be that a few 
words will be said by some of the 
speakers in relation to the quorums of 
the lesser Priesthood. Words of in- 
struction were given last night relative 
to them. The orders of the lesser 
Priesthood are v_ery necessary and im- 
portant in the Church, very needful to 
its welfare, and placed there by the God 
of heaven. This is the Church of God, 
not our Church, and who are we 
that we shall rise up and say that these 
quorums of the lesser Priesthood are 
unnecessary, and that we have too 
much Priesthood? It is God who has 
established the Priesthood, and set its 
bounds and limits. Something may be 
said in relation to the acting Teachers 
of the Church, who are called to act 
as Teachers in the lesser Priesthood. 
The ordained Teachers are usually 
young men from fourteen to eighteen 
or perhaps twenty years of age, who 
are not of themselves quite qualified to 
go out and teach the families of the 
Saints? Hence men are called to be 
acting Teachers, whose duty it is to 
take these young men with them in 
their visits to the people, that they 
may gain experience and become quali- 
fied to perform the functions of their 
office. If there is any duty neglected in 
the Priesthood, I think you will find it 
among the acting Teachers of this 
Church, who in many places fail to 
meet this responsibility. 

There has been no lack of instruction 
and counsel, from the days of thi 



ELDER RUDGER CLAWSON. 



51 



Prophet Joseph Smith until the present 
time. Twice a year in these general 
conferences, four times a year in the 
Stake conferences, once a year in the 
ward conferences, and then in the 
Sacrament meetings, the Priesthood 
meetings, and on other occasions, in- 
struction, full and complete, covering 
the whole field, has been given to the 
Latter-day Saints. But I often think 
that some of us are like the people of 
ancient Israel— we are slow to hearken 
to the voice of the Lord. We acknowl- 
edge His hand; we admit the import- 
ance of these things, and see the ne- 
cessity of them: but in many cases fail 
to carry out counsel, and thereby lose 
the blessing. I give it to you as my 
candid judgment that the great suc- 
cess which attended the ministry of 
Jesus Christ was due to His strict obe- 
dience to the will of the Father. I 
fancy that He sought to teach that les- 
son in all His life— almost by every 
word He spoke and everything He did. 
He was constanly striving to impress 
upon His disciples that He came not to 
do His own will, but the #.ill of the 
Father who sent Him. Do you not re- 
member that even at the age of twelve, 
when but a lad, upon one occasion he 
was separated from his parents. They 
searched for him with great anxiety, 
and finally discovered him in the temple 
at Jerusalem, disputing with the 
learned doctors. His parents chided 
Him for what appeared to them an act 
of disobedience in leaving them with- 
out their knowledge, and He turned 
and said, "Wist ye not that I must be 
about my Father's business?" Even 
at that tender age the spirit of obedi- 
ence manifested itself, and He gave 
His earthly parents to understand that 
He was there to do the will of the Fath- 
er. When He came to the waters of 
Jordan to be baptized, John the Baptist 
forbade Him, feeling that he was not 
worthy to baptize the Savior. The Sav- 
ior said, "Suffer it to be so now: for 
thus it becometh us to fulfil all right- 
eousness." In other words, to render 
obedience to the will of the Father. He 
who was without sin and without guile 
went down into the waters of baptism, 
and when He came up out of the water 
the heavens were opened and the Holy 
Ghost descended upon Him in the form 



of a dove ; and a voice came from the 
heavens, saying, "This Is my beloved 
Son, in whom I am well pleased." Why 
was the Father well pleased? Because 
of His obedience; because of His wil- 
lingness to do that which was required, 
even though it seemed not to be neces- 
sary. Again He was willing to be lifted 
upon the cross. Did He not say to the 
Father, "O my Father, if it be possible, 
let this cup pass from me: nevertheless 
not as I will, but as Thou wilt?" And 
did He not thus fulfil the will of the 
Father by His sufferings on the cross? 
Afterwards He ascended into heaven, 
and now sits upon the right hand of 
the Father, glorified, the Lord of life, 
the Savior of the world a perfect ex- 
ample of obedience! And should we not 
therefore follow His example, resting 
as we are under the great responsibility 
of having rceived the word of the Lord 
in relation to the various duties re- 
quired at our hands? How strict is the 
commandment of God! Are we not 
told in the language I have quoted, 
that the President of this Church is 
endowed with the keys of the myster- 
ies, and of the revelations which are 
sealed; but is there time at this confer- 
ence to talk upon the mysteries? No; 
we must talk upon the practical things, 
especially those which are neglected by 
the Latter-day Saints. Then when the 
next conference comes we shall doubt- 
less have to talk about the same things, 
again and again, because of our for- 
getfulness and our mortality. The 
President of the Church holds the keys 
of the revelations which are sealed. 
Have you forgotten, my brethren and 
sisters, that part of the plates from 
which the Book of Mormon was trans- 
lated are sealed, to come forth in the 
due time of the Lord? Is this the due 
time of the Lord? Can we expect that 
these plates will be unsealed and these 
mighty revelations brought forth, un- 
less we accept and carry out in our lives 
the commandments which have been 
unsealed and transmitted to us in the 
Book of Mormon, in the Book of Cove- 
nants, and in the Holy Bible — these 
glorious books which are before us, and 
which should receive our attention and 
our study, that we may become ac- 
quainted with the commandments of 
the Lord and observe to keep them, that

we may prepare ourselves for the 
great revelations which are to come, 
and which will come, as the Lord lives. 

I rejoice in these things. I know that 
this is the work of the Lord. I know 
that His hand is in it, and that His 
power is with us. I have seen it mani- 
fested upon many occasions. I have 
received many testimonies of the truth 
of this work. I cannot deny it and 
never will so long as the Lord will 
bless me with His Spirit and the power 
of the Priesthood. It is the work of 
God; and all who give heed to it, and 
who go down into the waters of bap- 
tism and are baptized for the remission 
of their sins, have hands laid upon 
them for the reception of the Holy 
Ghost, and continue faithful, will re- 
ceive a knowledge of this work, and 
shall know, as I know and as you know, 
that it is the work of the Lord. May God 
bless you and prosper you abundantly, 
is my prayer in the name of Jesus. 
Amen. 

Charles Kent rendered, with excellent 
effect, the beautiful hymn of which the 
following is the opening verse: 

my Father, Thou that dwellest 
In the high and glorious place! 

When shall I regain Thy presence, 
And again behold Thy face? 

In Thy holy habitation, 
Did my spirit once reside; 

In my first primeval childhood. 
Was I nurtured near Thy side. 

ELDER ANDREW KIMBALL. 
(President of St. Joseph Stake.) 

1 rejoice this afternoon, my brethren 
and sisters, in this opportunity, and 
deem it an honor to my sacred father's 
name and to my sacred mother's name. 
I feel it an honor to the Indian Terri- 
tory and Southwestern States Mission, 
with which I became so intimate, and 
to the Stake that I now have the hon- 
or to preside over. 

It takes me nearly two thousand 
miles travel to visit with you in con- 
ference, and it is my pleasure to gain 
all the information possible to take 
back to our people in the St. Joseph 
Stake, and they shall hail with delight 
my return to receive the word of the 
Lord as it has come unto us through 
the servants of God in these meetings. 
I indeed feel embarrassed to take up 



this valuable time, and if others feel as 
I do they desire to get the word from 
the fountain head; but we do appreci- 
ate the recognition of our Stakes and 
Missions, and we know that this is go- 
ing to redound to the good of the 
Church; for the people will feel com- 
plimented and will be strengthened in 
consequence of this remembrance. 

The St. Joseph Stake of Zion is situ- 
ated in the southeast corner of Arizo- 
na, adjoining Old Mexico and New 
Mexico. If you were to ride across 
Arizona, on the north, from Albu- 
querque, New Mexico, to California, 
you would see nothing but desert and 
tops of mountains among the timbers, 
and on the south along the Southern 
Pacific railroad nothing but sand hills 
and desert; but leaving the railroad, 
in a little oasis in the desert, you will 
find a happy people, nearly 4,000 Latter- 
day Saints, over whom I have the priv- 
ilege of presiding. It seems that the 
Lord has preserved these choice little 
spots in the desert for our people. They 
could not be seen by the travelers go- 
ing to and from California; but they 
were found by our people who were 
sent by President Brigham Young in 
early days. I will here say that those 
who left Utah in early days by team, 
did not find the promised land. They 
journeyed into Arizona, and, becoming 
discouraged, many of them returned 
home. There were some who had cour- 
age to remain and "hold the fort," and 
they have continued to increase, until 
today in that arid district of Arizona 
we have four good Stakes of Zion. 

I will say to you that we appreciate 
what has been said by the brethren in 
regard to the restless condition that 
exists among some of our people. There 
have been many inducements thrown 
out by some of these northern Stakes 
to draw people thither, and we ask you 
brethren of these Stakes to keep your 
hands off. We are happy and content- 
ed down there, and we do not want to 
lose our people. The trouble is, you are 
drawing away the financial men, the 
men of strength and character, whom 
we need ourselves. There are, how- 
ever, a number in our Stake that we 
would like you to have. We are liv- 
ing in a desert.Every foot of the ground

is sandy desert, and were it not for the 
water that is brought upon it by irri- 
gation, it would still be a desert, and 
when the water is taken off it becomes 
a desert again. But it is one of the 
most fruitful spots on earth. Possibly 
you have heard some of my stories 
about big sweet potatoes, the large 
shocks of corn, the thrifty growth of 
trees, and all that; but they are true, 
nevertheless. While I was in St. Paul 
this summer, representing Arizona in 
the Trans-Mississippi Congress, I had 
the pleasure of telling something of the 
resources of Arizona, lest those people 
in the rainy districts might think they 
had it all. After I had told them that 
we had grown a sweet potato weighing 
37% lbs., there was a Missourian yawn- 
ed, got up and went out. You know, 
the Missourians have to be "shown." 
A Texan came up and congratulated 
me, and said to the convention, "Texas 
has held the fort in all these conven- 
tions up to the present day, but now 
we'll give it up to Arizona; we can't 
beat the sweet potato." 

We bring the water from the Gila 
river and carry it over the sandy soil, 
and with the warm climate we can 
produce anything on that soil.. We 
have already dispensed with our early 
crop of Irish potatoes, and are now 
eating sweet potatoes from the same 
ground. I remember a short time ago 
seeing a beautiful field of grain, con- 
taining possibly forty-five bushels to 
the acre, and just as I left there was 
good-sized corn standing on the same 
ground. 

Now, we do not want you people of 
Oregon and Canada to get excited and 
come rushing down, for there is not 
room for you. 

We have a Latter-day Saint schcol 
established in Thatcher, the attendance 
sometimes running as high as 220. They 
come in from the surrounding country, 
and are trained in the Gospel as well 
as the various branches of education. 
It was my privilege to be in tb° 1 gis- 
lature two years ago, and while there 
I secured the passage of a bill giving 
to the Academy the National Guard, 
and now we have the largest National 
Guard in Arizona, and will get the 
regiment band soon. The governor, I 



want to say, is very proud of his "Mor- 
mon" boys. Recently it was my pleas- 
ure to visit him and talk with him 
about our country. He wrote me and 
asked me to go and see him. I called 
on him on my way home from St. Paul, 
and reported my trip in the interests 
of the Territory, and he was very much 
pleased. He wanted to know all about 
you good people, all about our organi- 
zation, etc. He took me to dine with 
him, and his wife, a very amiable and 
nice lady, was there also. While there 
he desired me to get information from 
th other Stakes of Zion in Arizona in 
regard to our people, and I did so. The 
Arizona people are broadminded and 
liberal. They are not hurt with religion, 
however. We have no trouble from 
the outside churches. Occasionally a 
little upstart comes in from the east 
and undertakes to uproot our people, 
but he can get no following. Not leng 
ago a wealthy Jew— Mr. Solomon— af- 
ter whom the county seat is named, 
had some relatives and friends visit 
Salt Lake City, and they were kindly 
entertained on these grounds. They 
spoke to Mr. Solomon, and he was very 
much interested and desired to visit 
Zion himslf. They told him he must 
try and get into the Temple, and he 
said he would get a recommend from 
President Kimball. Sure enough, he 
came to Thatcher with the company 
and introduced them to me, and said, 
"Brother Kimball, I want a recommend 
to go to the Temple." "Well," said I, 
"Brother Solomon, I'll tell you how you 
can get there. Baptism by immer- 
sion for the remission of sins — and I 
know you need it— will let you through 
the door. Then you can take your 
wife along, if she will repent, and you 
can have her married to you In the 
right way." I went into the store and 
wrote out a nice recommend to Presi- 
dent Lorenzo Snow, and he brought it 
up here, and President Snow enter- 
tained him for four hours. He came 
back and bore testimony throughout 
our country concerning the grand old 
gentleman at the head of the "Mor- 
mon" Church. He said he was the 
cleanest, nicest man he ever saw. 

Many good things have been said of 
us there. Last winter, while visiting 



54 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



in Tucson, one of our largest cities, 
Senator Ives, president of the last leg- 
islative council, asked me to dine with 
him. In the evening I joined him and 
his wife, and after they had put their 
lovely little family to bed, we com- 
menced talking upon Mormonism. I saw 
they were interested, and for four 
hours I explained to them the rise of 
this Church, told them of the Prophet 
Joseph Smith in his boyhood, of the 
establishment of this work in the earth, 
of the exodus of the people across the 
plains, of their establishment in the 
Rocky Mountains, and explained to 
them in detail the organization of the 
Church. Occasionally I asked them if 
I was not tiring them but they would 
say no, go ahead, Mr. Kimball, it is 
immensely interesting. When I reached 
the point of divine authority, then the 
good lady, who is a devoted Catholic, 
said, "Now, I have it. Some time ago 
there were two Elders left some tracts 
in our home, and I told our Protestant 
people that they were not in it a bit 
as far as authority was concerned, for 
it rested either with ourselves or the 
Mormon people." I replied, "Yes, that 
is where it rests. You people claim 
the literal descent, but we claim that 
the Gospel was taken from the earth 
and restored again through the Proph- 
et Joseph Smith." Thus our conversa- 
tion ended. 

This is the principle upon which we 
act down there; we treat the outside 
world right, and they treat us right. 
As Apostle John Henry Smith said to 
me, "Andrew, we are not out of the 
woods yet;" and sometimes I think 
that his policy of kindness is the safest 
policy to win friends. I have not for- 
gotten a lesson taught me by our ven- 
erable brother, Apostle Franklin D. 
Richards, when I was in the Indian 
Territory Mission. He said, "Brother 
Andrew, if you can do nothing more 
than to win friends unto the Gospel of 
Christ, you are doing a good work; for 
the honorable of the earth will have a 
much better opportunity than we can 
imagine — greater than many of those 
who have received the truth and not 
lived up to it." 

Brethren and sisters, Arizona is all 
right. We have a song, composed by 



one of our people, called "Arizona — the 
sun-kissed land." I wish now that I 
had sent it up here for Brother Steph- 
ens to have the Tabernacle choir sing 
it; for I want to tell you, it is good 
enough even for the Tabernacle choir. 
I was raised in Salt Lake City. These 
dear old streets and almost every nook 
about the city are familiar to me, and 
I love the people here with all my 
heart. My wife's folks and my folks 
are here. My wife said she had trem- 
bled all her life lest she might be sent 
into Arizona, and it seemed to me that 
was my condition, too. I went down 
there, in obedience to the word of the 
Lord, with a feeling of gloom and des- 
pondency hanging over me, and when 
President Joseph F. Smith set me apart 
he blessed me that I might not become 
despondent. 

I want to say to you that since I have 
been there I have not had time to be 
despondent. Arizona is the sun-kissed 
land, the home of the cactus and of the 
Gila monster. I am satisfied with my 
home there. I say, God bless Ari- 
zona; God bless her people. God bless 
those people that have had nerve and 
courage enough to stay down there and 
hold their homes; and you people up in 
these more favored districts, keep your 
hands off. God bless you all. Amen. 



ELDER WILLIAM T. JACK. 
(President of Cassia Stake.) 
My brethren and sisters, I need not 
say that I am delighted at this oppor- 
tunity of meeting with you in another 
general conference of the Church. For 
many years it was my lot to live in 
Salt Lake City, the place of my birth, 
and when conferences were being held 
it was not an unusual thing for me 
to be engaged in the avocation of life; 
but as time rolled on and my place of 
residence has been changed to one of 
the remote settlements in our neigh- 
boring State, I have come to appreciate 
the blessings of the Gospel, and the 
gatherings of the Latter-day Saints in 
which they come together and listen to 
the voice of the servants of the Lord, 
and receive that spiritual food which is 
calculated in its nature to strengthen 
and brace them up. 



ELDER WILLIAM T. JACK.

It is a little over two years since the 
call came to me to remove into Cassia 
county, Idaho, the gem state of the 
Union. I am thankful to say to you 
that long years ago, from my parents 
and through the inspiration of the Al- 
mighty, I was taught the lesson of 
obedience, and I take pride today in 
saying that whatever word has come to 
me from the servants of the Lord, I 
have been willing to accept it cheerful- 
ly and to accomplish the work intelli- 
gently, so far as my ability would per- 
mit. I removed to the north and suc- 
ceeded that venerable old pioneer, Hor- 
ton D. Haight, in the Cassia Stake. I 
found there a delightful place to live. 
The climate is similar to that that we 
have in Salt Lake City. The district is 
new.and the possibilities of the country 
are immense. Lying out in the valley to 
the northwest of where our little city 
is situated there are 250,000 acres of 
as good land as can be found any- 
where outside the valley of the Nile, 
and all we require in that district is 
the blessing of the Almighty and more 
water. We are waiting now for the 
hand of the artisan and the mechanic, 
and for the means of the millionaire, 
to come and assist us in taking the 
water out of the mighty Snake river 
and carry it upon that vast tract of 
land. 

In our religious work I feel very 
much encouraged. I think I can see 
a steady and constant growth on the 
part of the people. In the labor to 
which I have been called I am abund- 
antly blessed with the association of 
two stalwart, faithful, tried and true 
men, Elders John L. Smith and Wil- 
liam T. Harper, and with their aid, 
counsel and encouragement we are la- 
boring for the advancement of the 
work of the Lord in that held. We re- 
joice in the thought that good is being 
done. We also are blessed with the 
presence of a Stake academy in our 
lcality. At the present time we have 
over 100 of our young men and women 
enrolled in that institution.and they are 
receiving that education which is cal- 
culated to prepare them, not only for 
the duties of life, but for the eternity 
before us. 

I rejoice in the work of the Lord. I 



have rejoiced exceedingly in the testi- 
monies that have been borne by our 
brethren, and I have thought that it 
must be exceedingly discouraging to 
our enemies who have looked for the 
overthrow of the Gospel from the day 
of the assassination of the Prophet 
Joseph Smith until the present. When 
the Prophet Joseph Smith was among 
the people they thought he was the 
power of Mormonism, and they said 
among themselves that if they could 
destroy him, Mormonism would go 
down. They accomplished their de- 
sire, but Mormonism lived and flour- 
ished. When President Brigham Young, 
that noble leader of pioneers, came 
upon the scene, and he led the people 
to this wilderness and planted their 
feet firmly upon this land, they again 
thought that if Brigham Young were 
disposed of Mormonism would die. The 
time came when that venerable leader 
passed away; still the Lord had pre- 
pared another to take his place. Men 
have looked from time to time for the 
leader of the people to pass away, in 
the hope that the religion of the Lat- 
ter-day Saints would then come to 
naught. But in this Conference we 
have seen a new generation, young men 
of faith, and of most promising futures, 
upon whose shoulders some day will 
roll a portion of the responsibility of 
this great work. While this must be 
most encouraging to President Smith 
and his counselors, to the Twelve Apos- 
tles and our leading brethren, it must 
be very discouraging to our friends who 
have waited and hoped all these long 
years for the downfall of Mormonism. 

I pray that the Lord will bless us, 
and that He will inspire us to be faith- 
ful and to be charitable to our enemies, 
remembering the words of Malachi the 
Frophet, who, in speaking of the wicked 
makes the statement that the day will 
come that shall burn as an oven, when 
all the proud, and they that do wicked- 
ly, shall be as stubble. "The day that 
cometh shall burn them up, saith the 
Lord of hosts, that it shall leave them 
neither root nor branch." I think we 
can safely leave the wicked and all 
their evil machinations unto the Lord: 
for that day will most assuredly come 
that shall burn them up, saith the 



56 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Lord. "But unto you that fear my 
name shall the sun of righteousness 
arise with healing- in his wings; and ye 
shall go forth, and grow up as calves 
of the stall." Therefore, brethren and 
sisters, be encouraged in good works. 
Put upon yourselves the whole armor 
of righteousness, do your duty, yield a 
faithful and implicit obedience to the 
counsels that are given you from time 
to time, and I promise you today that 
the power and peace and blessings of 
the Almighty shall rest upon you; 
your streams shall increase, your bor- 
ders shall be lengthened, your bounda- 
ries shall be strengthened, and you will 
see the hand of the Almighty manifest 
in your deliverance in these troublous 
times, because just as sure as the an- 
gel has flown through the midst of 
heaven bearing in his sacred charge 
the everlasting Gospel and has restored 
it to the earth, just so sure are we liv- 
ing in the hour of God's judgment. 
Therefore, I say unto you, my breth- 
ren and sisters, be faithful to your- 
selves, and faithful to the trust that 
has been reposed in you, to the Priest- 
hood, to the Father and to His Son Je- 
sus Christ, whose blood was spilled on 
Calvary's hill. May we be humble and 
diligent in the performance of every 
duty, and may the power and blessings 
of the Almighty rest down upon the 
Prophet of the Lord, who stands at 
our head. May he be filled with power, 
with wisdom, and with every gift neces- 
sary for his high and holy calling, and 
may his brethren who are associated 
with him constantly hold up his hands 
and help him to accomplish the pur- 
poses of the Lord. I ask God to bless 
Israel in all her abiding places, in the 
name of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER S. R. BENNION. 
(President of Uintah Stake.) 

T deem it a great pleasure to have the 
privilege of assembling in this place 
and mingling my voice with the Lat- 
ter-day Saints. It has fallen to my lot, 
from my birth to the present time, to 
always be associated with the Latter- 
day Saints, and I hope that it will ever 
be my lot. I pray that I shall enjoy 
the Spirit of the Lord suffi- 



ciently to enable me to endure faith- 
fully unto the end, and to be true to 
the trust which is committed to me 
from day to day. It is only by con- 
stant labor and training that we shall 
secure to ourselves an exaltation in the 
celestial kingdom of our Heavenly 
Father. The prize is not to those who 
run swift for a few years, but it is to 
those who will endure unto the end, 
and I hope that we will all be enabled 
to endure to the end. I realize that we 
will be called upon to meet trials. Tt 
is written that the Lord is going to 
have a tried people. He will have a 
people that will serve Him and keep 
His commandments. Therefore, I look 
to be tried in all things. If I have not 
had trials they will come along soon 
enough; but I hope to be able to endure 
them. 

It is my pleasure to preside over tbe 
Uintah Stake of Zion, which is situated 
in the northeast corner of our fair 
state. We live in a goodly land. I 
suppose our Heavenly Father design id 
us to be there. Many good people live 
in that Stake of Zion, although there 
are some who are restless, wanting lo 
go to the north or to the south. I re- 
member a brother who resided the^e 
years ago. He had one of the finest lo- 
cations in the valley, but wanted to go 
down where Brother Kimball is. 
"Whether Brother Kimball has him yat 
or not I don't know. He was anxious 
to go where he could raise five crops 
of lucern a year. In our country he 
could not take care of two, so that I 
do not know what he will do down 
there. It is better for us to be content- 
ed with our lot, and try to do our duty 
in all things; and if we do this we will 
be. greatly blessed of the Almighty. The 
earth and the fulness thereof belongs 
to the Lord, and He has said that He 
will give it to whomsoever He will. 
He has promised to bless His people 
and to pour out His spirit upon them, 
if they will keep His commandments. 
I expect to enjoy every blessing that 
I live for. Every Latter-day Saint will 
enjoy everything he or she is entitled 
to. 

I pray that peace and prosperity may 
attend the labors of the Latter-day 
Saints, and the labors of the servants

cf God who are directing the affairs 
of His kingdom upon the earth. I feel 
satisfied with my brethren who are 
placed over me in the Holy Priesthood 
T am satisfied with those who laboi 
v/ilh me in the Uintah Stake of Zion — 
my counselors, the High Council, and 
the Bishops. The only thing that I am 
fearful of is, am I doing my duty from 
day to day? If I am not, my Heavenly 
Father and my brethren who are placed 
over me will hold me responsible. I 
can bear my testimony in regard to 
this work. I know that it is of God. 
I know that Joseph Smith was a pro- 
phet of God, and that those who have 
succeeded him were prophets. I know 
that we have prophets and apostles to 
l^ad and guide the affairs of the king- 
dom of God upon the earth today. May 
God add His blessing. May we be 
humble before Him from day to day, 
is my desire and prayer in the name of 
jesus. Amen. 

ELDER FRANK Y. TAYLOR. 
(President of Granite Stake.) 

My dear brethren and sisters, I es- 
teem it quite an honor to represent the 
Stake over which I preside. 1 am also 
happy in the thought that when they 
selected me to preside over a Stake of 
Zion they did not send me down to 
Arizona to raise big potatoes or up to 
Canada to raise large fields of wheat, 
but they let me stay right at home in 
Salt Lake county, almost on the bor- 
ders of Salt Lake City. I am delighted 
to say that the people in our stake are 
a good people. We have able men who 
are endeavoring to live their religion, 
and all organizations of the stake are, 
I believe, practically up-to-date in their 
work. The presidency of the stake has 
been loyally sustained by tne people. 

I was very much interested and im- 
pressed last night with the talk that 
Bishop Preston gave to us in regard to 
the training of our youth in the Les- 
ser Priesthood. It appears to me that 
as the Priesthood and presiding officers 
in the Church we ought to pay a little 
more attention to the proper training of 
our boys and girls, particularly the 
boys in the lesser Priesthood. I believe 
the future strength and growth of this 



great people and the work of the Lord 
depends largely upon the proper train- 
ing of our young people. I believe that 
it is the duty of presiding officers in 
the Church to see that there are no 
Deacons neglected in the Church. We 
ought to be sure, as Bishops of wards, 
that we have the organizations of the 
Deacons' properly perfected. If we 
take hold of them at the right age 
and see that they attend their meetings 
and are trained properly in the duties 
assigned to them, I believe we will have 
less trouble to organize our Teachers' 
and our Priests' quorums. I think we 
ought to begin young with the boys, 
nurse them along kindly, and try to 
implant within them a testimony of 
the faith that we have espoused. We 
ought to put them to work; teach 
them to act as doorkeepers in 
our meeting houses, to open the door 
when people come in and to act 
as ushers in taking the people to their 
seats, and showing them to the front, 
so that the late-comers will not have to 
pass a crowded place at the back to 
get to empty seats in the front. I tried 
this when I was a boy. I remember that 
of all the duties I had to perform in this 
Church, there is none that has given 
me greater pleasure than to act as a 
Deacon. The Bishop of the ward where 
I grew up used to honor the Deacons 
in their place. We had to look after the 
door and to seat the people in their 
places. He honored us in our positions 
to the extent that he expected people 
to conform to the rules of the house 
and to take the seats we assigned them. 
We had a trial of that down in our 
stake the other day. We had a confer- 
ence of the Lesser Priesthood, and I 
believe it was one of the most profitable 
meetings we have ever neld in our 
stake. In that meeting we gave the 
boys a practical illustration of their 
duties. We had Deacons that had been 
previously trained stationed at the 
door, and no boy was allowed to open 
the door. The door was opened for him 
very courteously and nicely, and as he 
stepped in the vestry a Deacon tapped 
him on the shoulder and led him to a 
seat in the proper place. We instructed 
them that they were to take the seat as- 
signed them. We had places for our 



8 



GENERAL, CONFERENCE. 



Bishops and High Councilors, and the 
Deacons knew just where to take them. 
During 1 the meeting- one of our Bishops 
came in late. He had been accustomed, 
I presume, to take any kind of seat he 
wanted; but I had instructed the Dea- 
cons that it would make no difference 
whether it was a Bishop or myself, they 
were expected to assign the seats. The 
Deacon and the Bishop walked up the 
aisle, and the Deacon had got clear to 
the stand before he noticed that the 
Bishop had taken a seat of his own 
choosing. Then I had to get up and re- 
mind the Bishop that we expected him 
to honor these boys in their place. I 
believe we ought to honor our Deacons, 
and encourage them in the start, so 
that they may grow up to understand 
the duties pertaining to the Priesthood, 
and not have to wait until they are 
twenty years of age and then have to be 
humiliated, when they want to get mar- 
ried or something of the kind, be- 
cause they have to go through the order 
necessary for them. I thank the Lord 
we had a Bishop that took hold of me 
when I was a little fellow and trained 
me in the duties pertaining to the Les- 
ser Priesthood, because if there is any 
strength in me it is due to the training 
that I received when a little boy. I 
think this is the time we ought to start 
in matters of this kind. 

There is another thing that is lack- 
ing: at least, it is with us. It seems to 
me that there ought to be in every 
ward, where possible, a quorum of 
Priests, a quprum of Teachers, and 
they ought to be active in the perform- 
ance of the duties pertaining thereto. 
If we get these quorums thoroughly or- 
ganized and attending to their duties, 
we will not have much trouble with act- 
ing Teachers. The great trouble is, the 
Bishops cannot get the Teachers to do 
their work; but if we get the boys 
started early and train them aright, we 
will have little trouble in regard to this. 

There is another matter that appeals 
to me very strongly, and that is the 
welfare of the youth of Israel. I love 
the youth of Israel, and I feel that as 
Latter-day Saints we are not giving 
them the close attention that we oughi 
to in the way of missionary work, and 
nurturing them, and getting them to 



forsake the little evil practices they in- 
dulge in by holding out a better life 
and light unto them. We are so busily 
engaged in the duties of life that we do 
not stop to think that there are some 
who need an arm thrown around them. 
They need someone to love them, some- 
one to nurture them, and give them a 
chance to reform. I heard of a case 
recently that will illustrate this, of a 
boy who had lived in a settlement all 
his life. Nobody had paid any attention 
to him; they had taken it for granted 
that there was no good in him. But a 
stranger moved into the settlement, and 
he liked the appearance of the boy. 
He put his arm around him 
and in kind words asked him if he 
had not better repent; that there was 
a better chance for him in the fold of 
the Church of Jesus Christ than on the 
outside. The boy turned to him and 
with tears in his eyes thanked him for 
the interest he had shown in him by 
putting his arm around him and speak- 
ing kindly to him. He said, "You are 
the first man that ever did that to me 
in my life. I have lived in this set- 
tlement all my life and it has been the 
rule almost to point the finger of scorn 
at me; but never has it occurred to 
any of them to come up and say a kind 
word as you have done." That boy 
turned round and is now a faithful, hon- 
orable young man in the Church. The 
trouble is, we are so busy that we take 
it for granted that our boys who some- 
times make mistakes have no good in 
them, and we do not go out of our way 
to put our arms around them in love 
and teach them the principles of the 
Gospel. We ought to preach the Gos- 
pel of Christ at our firesides, and in 
the homes of our neighbors. There is 
plenty of opportunity in these valleys 
of the mountains to preach the Gospel, 
and to bring the wayward back again 
into the fold of Christ. Here is op- 
portunity for all of us: Blessed is the 
father and blessed is the mother whose 
family is all around them and living 
their religion, and making no mistakes! 
That father ought to rejoice that he 
has such a family, and he ought to feel 
warm towards the less fortunate father 
who has a family that he has no con- 
trol over. He ought to put his arm

around his neighbor's children, and 
with the talent he has exercised in con- 
trolling his own family try to use an 
influence with them. Do not let the 
boys go to the four winds, simply for 
the lack of doing our duty in this re- 
gard. I have said it before and I 
will repeat it here, that lots of us will 
go out into the world to preach the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ without asking 
any questions. "We will have door af- 
ter door slammed in our face; and if 
opportunity will present so that we 
can pour into the ears of the people 
the good things of the Gospel we are 
delighted. After awhile, if we can 
lead them down into the waters 
of baptism, we rejoice exceedingly that 
we have converted someone. We do 
not specially ask them about their past 
or what they have been doing. All we 
ask of them is to repent of their sins, 
go down into the waters of baptism, 
and have hands laid upon them for the 
reception of the Holy Ghost. Yet oft- 
times we will come back home and we 
would not cross the road to preach the 
Gospel to some of our young boys right 
here. I believe I will be safe in saying 
that if we would expend one-tenth of 
the energy and time and means, one- 
tenth of the patience and love, that we 
give to the children of the world, in 
the interest of our own wayward boys 
at home, we would save many more 
souls. We could love our boys more 
than we do; we could have more pa- 
tience with our girls than we do have. 
We could spend more time around our 
own firesides, teaching the children the 
principles of the everlasting Gospel, in- 
stead of going after the things of the 
world and letting the boys go to the 
winds. As fathers and mothers, we 
ought to be more careful in regard to 
the rearing of our youth. We should 
make home the most pleasant place 
that the boy or girl can find in this 
whole world. It ought to be the cen- 
ter of attraction to every child. We 
should make it so attractive by our 
kindness, our love, and all necessary 
conveniences, that they will love it bet- 
ter than any other place. I believe it 
would do good sometimes to sell a calf 
or a horse in order to place good books 
in the home for our boys and girls to 



read. Subscribe for the works of the 
Church, so that they can read the prin- 
ciples of the Gospel and have them im- 
planted in their hearts. Then let us 
take some time to sit down by the fire- 
side with them and explain unto them 
the Gospel. 

Brethren and sisters, I love the youth 
of Israel. I know that there is good in 
them. If the coal looks dead, it reeds 
someone to blow the bellows to bring it 
back to life again. I have found boys 
who have been looked upon as no good 
and practically dead, but with nursing 
and effort that coal has been brought 
back to life. And what happiness 
comes into the home when a wayward 
son turns over a new leaf and becomes 
a good, upright Latter-day Saint! I re- 
joice in the Gospel of Jesus Christ. I 
bear my testimony to its truth. I know 
that the Prophet Joseph Smith was a 
prophet of God. I know that the proph- 
et that we have presiding over us today 
is a man of God, and sets an example 
in his family that is worthy of all Is- 
rael. God bless you. Amen. 



ELDER MATHIAS F. COWLEY. 

Difficulties to be settled privately, If possible — 
Presiding authorities should not be appealed 
to unnecessarily — Honor every man in his 
position. 

My brethren and sisters, I rejoice 
very much in the teachings of this con- 
ference, and in the way that President 
Smith has been led to conduct the con- 
ference. I would like to say to the 
Bishops that it is a good example for 
you to follow. It is impossible for the 
work of the Lord to be carried on by 
the intelligence of man, or by any pre- 
meditated arrangement carried out in 
a mechanical way. As the President of 
the Church has been led to conduct our 
conference, so ought every Stake Pres- 
ident to conduct his Stake conference, 
and every Bishop to conduct his ward 
conference, as well as his meetings in 
general. I do not mean by that that 
you should follow it in mechanical de- 
tail, but that you should follow the 
whisperings of the Holy Spirit; for this 
is what has been done during this con- 
ference, as it has no doubt in the con- 
ferences of the past.

GENERAL, CONFERENCE. 



We rejoice to hear the testimonies of 
our brethren who preside over the 
Stakes. I rejoice to be associated with 
men such as they are; and if I were 
as sure of my salvation as I am of the 
salvation of such men as have stood 
before us this afternoon, I would be 
exceedingly delighted. They are men 
of God, and we who live in the Stakes 
of Zion ought to look to these men for 
counsel, and not, when we have diffi- 
culties to settle, always run to one of 
the Twelve Apostles, or to one of the 
presiding Council of Seventies, when 
they are in the Stake. We ought to 
settle our troubles right in the Ward 
where they occur, and there ought to 
be a more strict observance of the law 
of God in regard to the adjustment of 
difficulties. Where there are differences 
between brethren and sisters, they 
ought to try and settle them in the way 
indicated by the Savior — between them- 
selves, in the spirit of prayer; not with 
a determination to show how wrong 
your brother is, but in the Spirit of 
the Lord seek to be reconciled with 
your brother. If this will not accom- 
plish it, then call in the Teachers of 
the Ward, and let them act as peace- 
makers; for blessed are the peacemak- 
ers. And when the Teachers find a 
difficulty in a family, they have no bus- 
iness to tell it to anybody else or to 
circulate it on the streets. They ought 
to guard such things with the utmost 
sacredness. 

The Lord has laid down His law on 
this subject, as well as on all other 
subjects affecting the welfare of the 
Church. In Section 42 of the Book of 
Doctrine and Covenants, it is written: 

"And if thy brother or sister offend 
thee, thou shalt take him or her be- 
tween him or her and thee alone; and 
if he or she confess, thou shalt be rec- 
onciled." 

That is, it shall not be harped upon 
or talked about after it has been set- 
tled. Every man ought to esteem him- 
self as put upon honor, after a difficulty 
is settled, not to stir it up or resur- 
rect it among the people of God, but 
let it be settled forever. When Teach- 
ers find difficulties existing in families 
that they can settle without reporting 
them to the Bishop, it is not a duty in 



the sight of God that the Bishop even 
should know of them. In fact, I do not 
suppose the Bishop wants to know the 
failings of the people, if they can be 
rectified without his knowledge. The 
Lord has laid down the doctrine that 
the confession shall be as broad as the 
offense. If I offend my brother, I must 
make it right with my brother; and it 
is hypocrisy to go and ask the forgive- 
ness of God until I have become recon- 
ciled with and made restitution to my 
brother. The Lord says:> 

"If any one offend openly, he or she 
shall be rebuked openly, that he or she 
may be ashamed. And if he or she con- 
fess not, he or she shall be delivered up 
unto the law of God. 

"If any shall offend in secret, he or 
she shall be rebuked in secret, that he 
or she may have opportunity to confess 
in secret to him or her whom he or she 
has offended, and to God, that the 
Church may not speak reproachfully of 
him or her." 

The object is to save people; to 
make it as easy as possible for them 
to repent and to make restitution for 
their wrong; not to circulate the story 
of their wrongdoing and create a pub- 
lic scandal, but to have it settled ac- 
cording to the law of God. 

In another revelation, the Lord says: 

"It always has been given to the El- 
ders of my Church from the beginning, 
and ever shall be, to conduct all meet- 
ings as they are directed and guided by 
the Holy Spirit." 

This is the law of God to every 
Bishop, to every stake president, and 
to the president of every quorum or 
association in the Church. They are 
to be guided by the Holy Spirit. Thia 
conference has been exceedingly inter- 
esting because it has been conducted 
by the Spirit of the Lord through the 
man who presides over us on this oc- 
casion. I may say that it is the most 
Interesting conference of the Church 
that I ever attended. 

Another thing: The Lord certainly 
placed prophets and apostles, evangel- 
ists, pastors and teachers in the 
Church, as Paul describes, for the work 
of the ministry and for the edifying of 
the body of Christ; but He has placed 
the Bishops and the authorities of the 
stakes in the Church for the perfecting 
of the Saints, just as much as the 
Apostles, or the Council of Seventies, 



ELDER MATHIAS F. COWLEY. 



61 



or the Presiding Bishopric, or the Pres- 
idency of the Church, who stand at the 
head; and there ought to be an im- 
provement in all the stakes in regard 
to the adjustment of all matters af- 
fecting the salvation of the Saints of 
God in the respective stakes. I sup- 
pose that the President of the Church 
gets bushels of letters written by men 
and women who, disregarding the 
Bishop and the presidency of the stake, 
go over the heads of those officers in 
order to lay their cases before the Pres- 
ident or to ask questions of him, some 
of which are of the most foolish char- 
acter. This is all wrong. I want to 
advise the Latter-day Saints to settle 
these questions at home just as far as 
possible. When the Priesthood of God 
is trusted by the people, there will be 
a greater measure of the Spirit of the 
Lord attending the ministrations of oui 
Bishops and stake presidents through- 
out the Church. I do not believe that 
the Presidency of the Church are un- 
der any obligation to do those things 
that ought to be done by the local au- 
thority, and I do not knew that they 
have any promise of being blessed of 
the Lord in doing work that ought to 
be done by the Bishops and presidents 
of stakes. I am impressed with this, 
because I have been asked in various 
stakes of Zion a great many questions 
that could easily be answered by the 
Bishop of the ward, and I have been 
appealed to to seUH difficulties that 
ought to be settled easily right at home. 
The Latter-day Saints should under- 
stand this and feel the responsibility of 
it. The Priesthood of God is the repre- 
sentation of God, if you please, in th& 
earth. It is not man's personal in- 
dividuality that we honor, but it is tht 
authority of God which he holds. God 
has established His work upon thu 
earth, and He has appointed men to be 
the recipients of His holy will and, 
through their administration, to voice 
that will unto the Latter-day Saints. 
The Savior said to His disciples, "H*» 
that receiveth you receiveth me; and 
he that despiseth you despiseth me; 
and he that despiseth me despiseth Him 
that sent me." When this principle is 
understood and properly carried out, 
there will be more of the power of God 



in the midst of the Latter-day Saints, 
there will be a stronger bond of union 
among them, and there will be greater 
and more effective work accomplished 
throughout the stakes and wards by 
the local Priesthood. I »wish to say to 
every man in the Church, young and 
old, that the greatest desire of his heart 
should be to honor the office in the 
Priesthood which he holds, and not 
have constantly in his mind the great- 
ness of somebody else's calling. It is 
all the authority of God, the one Priest- 
hood, and it cannot be parted asun- 
der. The High Priest holds the Mel- 
chisedek Priesthood ;the Seventy holdb 
the same, just as the Apostle does, and 
he is entitled to the power of God in 
his ministrations among the people. 1 
have heard President Woodruff say 
many times that he never enjoyed mora 
of the Spirit of God than he did when 
he was a Priest, preaching the Gospel, 
I believe, in Arkansas. It was the same 
with John the Baptist, and with 
Philip; they enjoyed the spirit and 
power of Almighty God, and yet they 
officiated in the Lesser Priesthood. We 
are entitled to the same blessing if we 
live for it. I think it would be a 
good thing if every Bishop would call 
together all the Priesthood in his Ward, 
and would select from the High Priests, 
the Seventies and the Elders enough 
men to act in the capacity of Priests. I 
have enquired in the Stakes of Zion 
where I have traveled, about a quorum 
of Priests and have found but few. Yet 
the Lord has laid down that as one of 
the offices in the Lesser Priesthood, 
and has specificially stated that they 
are the ministers of the Gospel unto 
the people. 

We had instructions here last night 
by President Smith concerning our re- 
sponsibility to the authorities of Wards 
and Stakes. I have been taught this 
doctrine all my life. I was born and 
raised on the same block as Brother 
Frank Y. Taylor and Brother John W. 
Taylor, and I used to act in the ca- 
pacity of a Teacher in the home of 
President John Taylor. I was not very 
well qualified, it is true. I believe the 
only qualification I had was a willing 
spirit and an obedient heart; but the 
Lord blessed me in my labors. When- 



62 



GENERAL, CONFERENCE. 



ever we entered into the house of Pres- 
ident Taylor as Teachers, he laid aside 
all other things that were demanding 
his attention, and he would call his fam- 
ily together, sit down with us, and hear 
what we had to say. On one occasion 
a young man, who was asked to ques- 
tion President Taylor in regard to the 
performance of his duties as a member 
of the Church, said he did not want to. 
Why not? Because, said he, he is a so 
much better and greater man than we 
are. President Taylor told him it was 
his duty to question him. "Why," said 
the young man, "I don't think you 
would hold the office that you do if 
you did not perform your duty as a 
member of the Church." The President 
replied, "It is your duty to find out 



whether I do my duty as a member or 
not; whether I teach my children the 
principles of the Gospel, and pay my 
tithing, and attend to my family and 
my secret prayers." 

The more men know about the Priest- 
hood of God, the more they respect it. 
I say to the people, seek unto the 
Priesthood of God, and let wizards, nec- 
romancers, hypnotists, spiritualists and 
all such things alone; for within the 
Church of God there is all sufficient for 
our salvation in this life and our exal- 
tation in the life to come. God bless 
you. Amen. 

The choir sang, "Rouse, all ye mor- 
tals." 

Eenediction by Presiding Patriarch 
John Smith. 



THIRD DAY. 



IN THE TABERNACLE. 
MONDAY, OCT. 6, 10 A. M. 

The choir and congregation sang the 
hymn which begins: 

Do what is right; the day dawn la 
breaking. 

Hailing a future of freedom and light. 
Angels above us are silent notes taking 
Of every action; do what is right! 

Opening prayer was offered by Elder 
Joseph E. Taylor, counselor in the pre- 
sidency of the Salt Lake Stake. 

Singing by the choir: 

Come, dearest Lord, descend and dwell, 
By faith and love, in every breast; 

Then shall we know and taste and feel 
The Joys that cannot be expressed. 

ELDER MARRINER W. MERRILL. 

Remarkable development of the Lord's work — The 
elements tempered, and tbe land blessed — 
Continued Improvement essential — Import- 
ance of the teacher's calling— Evils of debt and 
mort gages. 

The meetings of the conference thus 
far have been very interesting to me. 
I have listened with a great deal of in- 
terest to the reports of the presidents 
of missions and presidents of the Stakes 
of Zion. We are here, my brethren and 
sisters, to be fed spiritually, and to be 



instructed with regard to our temporal 
duties. Thus far, I think, we have all 
been satisfied with the things that we 
have heard and the spirit that has been 
manifest. Indeed we may say we have 
had a refreshing from the Lord. We 
have been benefitted and profited by the 
various subjects that have been treated 
upon. How vast is the work of the 
Lord! And how it is increasing and 
spreading abroad, notwithstanding the 
difficulties that have been thrown in 
the way! When we look back, say 50 
years (there are many here, I suppose, 
that can remember 50 years back,) and 
observe the progress that has been 
made in 50 years, it is wonderful to 
contemplate. While in that time twen- 
ty of our Apostles and Presidents of the 
Church have passed to the other side, 
yet we see today the Church is stronger 
and the people are more numerous than 
ever before. There is more interest man- 
ifested in the forwarding of this work in 
the earth, than ever before in our his- 
tory. Thus we see the hand of the Lord 
manifest towards this people in their 
growth and development in the earth. 
What will be the growth and develop- 
ment in fifty more years? No doubt 
there are people here that will live to 



ELDER MARRINER W. MERRILL. 



63 



see fifty more years, and the work be- 
ing developed fifty years hence. 

We have great cause to give thanks 
and praise to our heavenly Father for 
His goodness unto us, and for His mer- 
cy in tempering the elements in these 
high mountain valleys. I can well re- 
member when it was said that certain 
valleys in these mountains would not 
produce the cereals of the earth, be- 
cause of their altitude and the frosts; 
but this saving has been brought to 
naught. I remember very distinctly go- 
ing with President Young on his first 
trip into the Bear Lake Valley. A 
number in the company, after we ar- 
rived there and camped, predicted that 
there never would be any grain raised 
in Bear Lake Valley, because it was too 
cold. But we find that the Lord tem- 
pered the elements. I remember what 
President Young told them in the first 
meeting. He said, "You have come here 
to a cold, high valley; but if you will 
stay here and be contented, and serve 
the Lord, you will get rich." He as- 
sured them that they would be able to 
raise grain; but if you cannot raise 
grain, said he, you can raise hops, and 
get rich raising hops. We find that 
the elements have been tempered in 
all the high valleys. In Cache valley 
we all huddled together, you know, on 
the low lands. I remember President 
Kimball saying one time when he was 
there that the day would come when we 
would want to crowd up toward the 
mountains, and cultivate the land on 
the high benches. That saying is veri- 
fied today. Go into Cache valley and 
you can see the valley cultivated in 
places almost to the top of the moun- 
tains, while the lower part of the val. 
ley is abandoned to grass. 

The Lord has been with His people. 
He has been with His servants. And it 
has seemed to me, in watching the 
progress of the work of the Lord, as if 
e"ery administration that we have had 
was a little stronger than the previous 
one: but perhaps that is not the case. 
It may only be that in the develop- 
ment of the work of the Lord new 
things have arisen. The Lord did not 
promise He would reveal everything 
at once. He said He would give line 
upon line, precept upon precept, here a 



little and there a little; and as the work 
of the Lord develops new features are 
brought before the people. Things are 
revealed from time to time that were 
not necessary half a century ago. 

Now, taking into consideration om 
condition and our circumstances, is 
there yet room for improvement among 
the Latter-day Saints? Notwithstand- 
ing the good reports that we hear from 
the various Stakes of Zion, let me ask, 
is there yet a chance for improvement 
in the Church of Christ? Why, thefe 
certainly is. We have not all come to 
the unity of the faith yet. We have 
not all come to a perfect understand- 
ing of the Gospel. We learn a little to- 
day and a little tomorrow, advance step 
by step and keep learning a little more 
about the work of God. 

The Lord has given unto His people a 
perfect organization, such as is not 
found anywhere else in the world. It 
was reported by somebody since the 
conference commenced that there werti 
no poor in one of the Stakes of Zion. 
When I heard that, I thought to myself 
that that Stake was in rather a bad 
condition. The Savior said, The poor 
ye have always with you. My experi. 
ence in the Church has taught me that 
if no poor are found it is because a 
thorough search has not been made in 
the Stake; for I believe there are poor 
in all the Stakes of Zion. There is a 
certain class of people amongst us that 
wont make their wants known. They 
will suffer, and suffer a great deal, be- 
fore they will let their neighbors know 
their condition. I have acted as a 
Bishop for eighteen years in tbv? 
Church, and I have found in my ad- 
ministration that there are cases of 
this kind, where people will not re- 
veal their condition. Such people have 
to be hunted for; and then looked af- 
ter, by the Priests, or by the Teach 
ers, or by somebody, in order that their 
circumstances may be made known. I 
will guarantee if all the Stakes of Zion 
were searched carefully it would be 
found that there are poor everywhere; 
not so extensively perhaps in some 
Stakes as in others, but there are poor. 
The organization that the Lord has giv. 
en us suits the condition of every mem- 
ber of the Church, and also the condi- 



64 



GENERAL, CONFERENCE. 



tion of non-members of the Church, be- 
cause they, living among- us, are to be 
cared for, are to be looked after, and 
treated kindly. 

I fear there is a lack, my brethren 
and sisters, with regard to the labors 
of the Lesser Priesthood. I fear thia 
because I know from experience that it 
requires a constant labor and a con- 
stant watchcare on the part of the 
Bishop to keep the Lesser Priesthood in 
good working order. Now, every family 
in the Church, and every family in 
the district, whether they are in the 
Church or not, ought to be visited. They 
are the Lord's children, and they ought 
to be looked after. They ought to be 
visited at least once a month. Can we 
Bishops or Presidents of Stakes say, 
and say truthfully, that the flock over 
which the Lord has appointed us to 
preside is visited, cared for, looked af- 
ter and provided for. If we can, then 
we are in a happy condition, and we 
are doing just what the Lord wants us 
to do. But if we fail in this import- 
ant matter, then it is time for us to 
consider, to counsel together as the 
Priesthood, as a quorum of the 
Priesthood, and see wherein we can 
make our labor more valuable and more 
profitable to the Latter-day Saints. The 
Teachers, you know, have general jur- 
isdiction. The office of a Teacher is 
an important one in the Church. I 
remember once going as a Teacher into 
the family of President Kimball, and 
President Kimball was there. Of course, 
being a boy, I felt bashful, and ver> 
diffident in talking in the home of one 
of the Presidency of the Church; but 
it was not long before President Kim- 
ball made me feel perfectly at home, to 
talk there just as I would to anyone 
else, because of the spirit and kind- 
ness he manifested. He says, "I want 
you to preach the Gospel to my fam. 
ily. If you see anything out of order, 
I want you to tell them about it; 
whether it be indoors or out-of-doors, 
tell them about it; advise with them 
about it, counsel with them about it." 
Now, that has always been a lesson 
to me. I have always remembered it. 
The Teachers should advise with the 
people in regard to their interests. Not 
that they should have one simple rou- 



tine of questions to ask in every fam- 
ily; that is not necessary, and the Lord 
will not lead you that way either; but 
He will lead you to say such things in 
each family as shall be suitable and 
proper. The Lord will be with ever> 
Teacher if he is humble and prayerful. 
No»w, I conclude, from my own ex- 
perience, thai the very best thing in 
the world for the Teacher to do before 
he goes out, is to go off into a secret 
place, and tell the Lord he is going ouv 
in fulfilment of his duty, to labor as a 
minister of the Gospel among the 
people. If you will do this in humility, 
the Lord will be with you and direct 
you in your labors. Now, do not miss 
anybody in your travels. Do not be in 
such a hurry that the most remote fam. 
ily in the district may not be visited 
and looked after. You may feel in your 
hearts that those people are no good, 
that they are not worthy, that they 
wont receive you kindly, and so on; but 
there may be children there, on whom 
your influence may have great effect, 
and you cannot afford to neglect them. 
We cannot afford to neglect our duty to 
these people. Now, these things apply 
to the Presidency of the Stake as well 
as to the Bishopric. 

There is one very good thing that 
tht-- Teachers might talk to the people 
about, and that is with regard to going 
in debt. Some of our people have had 
a great desire to go in debt, perhaps 
for the purpose of making as good a 
show as their neighbors. In my opin- 
ion, the time has come when we should 
desist from "going into debt. We should 
not mortgage our homes. This is a sub- 
ject that I certainly think the Teachers 
should talk about. I hope that it may 
be said from this time on that the Lat- 
ter-day Saints will not mortgage their 
realty, their homes, their chattels, or 
anything they have. Under some cir- 
cumstances it may be a necessity; but 
a rule it is a bad thing, and we 
ought to quit it. I have seen people 
turned out of their homes, owing to 
tre mortgage being foreclosed. They 
have had to let it go for half its valu^, 
because it is seldom you can borrow 
on a piece of property the full value of 
it, and in that way their hard earningr 
are dissipated. Do not mortgage your 



ELDER DAVID K. UDALL. 



6S 



homes. There was a time when there 
were no mortgages in all Utah; but 
1t is not so today. I do not suppose 
there is a Stake of Zion that is now 
free from it. It is time, therefore, that 
we began to seriously consider our con- 
dition, and cease going in debt. Let us 
pay off our mortgages and our obliga- 
tions as fast as possible; and the quick- 
est and easiest way to do it is for every 
man to pay his tithing and offerings 
to the Lord. For everything belongs 
to the Lord, and He has made us stew- 
aids over what He has placed in our 
hands. Then let us pay our obligations 
to the Lord, no matter what our neigh- 
bor may say about it. Every man 
in the Church should pay his tithing, 
and pay it when he has it. Do not put. 
off paying the tithing on your sum- 
mer's wage until the fall, because that 
is not a good way. When you receive 
your monthly salary, pay your tithir.g 
right at the time; and do the same 
with whatever you get from any 
3ource. If you will do this, the Lor>l 
will open up your way and help you 
out of debt. Let us make a resolve 
not to go in debt any more, and the 
Lord will assist us to carry it out. We 
not only want to get out of debt our- 
selves, but we want to see the Church 
out of debt, so that the hands of the 
Presidency may be so liberated that 
they can use whatever means are 
necessary for the development of the 
work of the Lord and the building up 
of Zion. If we had in our possession 
today the interest that we have paid 
on outside capital, it would help us 
considerably. 

Another thing: Let us not make too 
many demands upon the Presidency of 
the Church. The Presidents of Stakes 
and Bishops of wards are continually 
asking the Church to help them for one 
purpose or another. Bless your soul, 
tne Presidency of the Church would b= 
willing to help everybody if they had 
it in their power; but it is not in their 
power at present. Therefore, if we have 
a meetinghouse to build, let us go to 
and build it without asking aid from 
the Church. If we could utilize thv 
labor that is wasted in all the Stakes 
of Zion, we could build all the meeting- 
-houses we need. You brethren that 



need meetinghouses in your wards and 
stakes, try and utilize that labor in 
the building of them. I know by ex- 
perience that this can be done. Then 
you will not have to ask the Church fcr 
anything. 

These are some of the details that 
affect us in our wards and stakes. It 
would be a good thing for the Bishops* 
and Presidents to make a note of what 
is said by the speakers, and wherein 
the remarks fit their circumstances, 
apply them. We are gathered from 
all parts to get information and in- 
struction, and let us not pass these 
things by without giving heed to therr. 

I testify to you, my brethren and sis- 
ters, that this is the work of the Lord 
It has done my soul good to hear the 
brethren testify that they knew tikffc 
was the work of God. It is not our 
work, but the Lord has given us tho 
privilege to take part in it. Joseph 
^mith, the great prophet of the last 
dispensation, has a wjatchcare over 
as today, just as he had while he wa^ 
on the earth; and he is not so very 
far off, either. The Prophet Brigham 
also, and the other leaders of Israel 
who have gone to the other side, are 
watching over the people of God; and 
let us not feel that they are away, 
beyond the bounds of time and space, 
because they are not very far away. 
This is the work of God. Joseph was a 
great prophet. He ushered in this dis- 
pensation of the fulness of times, and 
it is gradually going forward. It hss 
spread abroad upon the mountains and 
in the valleys, and will continue to do 
so. God will build up His kingdom and 
sustain His servants. Let us see to 
it that we are not found complaining 
or faultfinding, but let it be said of u* 
mat we have sustained the work of 
God and our brethren. God bless you, 
is my prayer in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 

ELDER DAVID K. UDALL, 
(President of St. Johns Stake.) 
I desire the faith and prayers of my 
brethren and sisters the short time that 
I may stand before you. I am not like

beautiful city of yours. It is a revela- 
tion to me to behold what is to be seen 
in these lovely valleys of the moun- 
tains. It has not been my good for- 
tune to be associated intimately with 
the leading authorities of the Church, 
only when they have visited our coun- 
try. For twenty-seven years I have 
been engaged in looking after the in- 
terests of the Latter-day Saints in dif- 
ferent parts of the Lord's vineyard. It 
has been my lot to be on the frontiers, 
and to assist in building up the waste 
places of Zion. I have rejoiced in this 
labor, and have seen the power of God 
made manifest on many occasions in 
the support and succor that has come 
to the Latter-day Saints in the estab- 
lishment of new colonies. I rejoice ex- 
ceedingly in the testimony of the Gos- 
pel of Jesus Christ. I know this is the 
work of God. I have known for many 
years that those who led the Church 
were inspired of the Almighty. I can 
remember, in the days of my childhood, 
when the little children went out to 
greet President Brigham Young as he 
passed through the settlements of the 
Saints. I recollect how my heart leap- 
ed with joy and satisfaction in seeing 
this great man and in listening to his 
words and the words of those who ac- 
companied him on those noted trips. 
In my ministry among the people I 
have rejoiced in the teachings and the 
words of encouragement that have 
come from the leaders of the Church, 
and I bear my testimony today that 
the men who lead Israel are men of 
God, who have had and do have the 
power and the inspiration to lead this 
people successfully, if we will adhere 
to their instructions. 

I have had great pleasure in my la- 
bors in the St. Johns Stake of Zion. 
"We do not raise these wonderful sweet 
potatoes that President Kimball re- 
ferred to; but I will tell you what we 
do have, as no doubt President Kimball 
has in his Stake: we have a choice peo- 
ple in that land, who are trying to 
serve God. As an evidence of this, we 
discover in all the wards a desire on the 
part of the Bishops and the Saints gen- 
erally to keep up the organizations that 
have been established for the welfare 



of the people. "We are at peace with 
our neighbors. We have the Navajos on 
one side of us, and the Apaches on the 
other; and in some places where our 
people reside there are Pueblo Indians. 
"We are at peace with these people. "We 
are at peace with the territory of Ari- 
zona, and I was very thankful to listen 
to the remarks of President Kimball 
yesterday in regard to our treatment 
there. I think it is due the people and 
officials of the territory that the Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints 
should understand that we are treated 
nicely and kindly in the country in 
which we live. The conditions sur- 
rounding us in the St. Johns Stake are 
rather peculiar. We live in a section 
of country where we are not favored 
with a railroad passing through any of 
our settlements, nor a telegraph line. 
"Whether these things are a blessing or 
not is not for me to say, but we miss 
these opportunities of the age. We re- 
joice, however, that we have the same' 
privileges in the Gospel that you have 
who are more favored in these other re- 
gards. We have a people free from 
mortgages. I do not believe there is a 
single home belonging to the Latter- 
day Saints in that Stake of Zion that 
is under mortgage. Every meeting- 
house, every schoolhouse, our Academy 
building, and all our public property, 
is free of debt; and though we are poor, 
we rejoice in that fredom. In our farm- 
ing we depend almost entirely upon res- 
ervoirs. If my memory serves me right 
in the eight wards of that Stake we 
have fourteen reservoirs, constructed 
by the united labor of the people. With 
a population of about 1,500 in the Stake, 
we have expended in the neighborhood 
of $80,000 in the building of reservoirs, 
and we do not owe anything for them. 

I am happy, my brethren and sisters, 
in having the privilege occasionally to 
come and visit with you and to attend 
the general conferences. I pray God to 
continue to bless and prosper His peo- 
ple. There is one thing comes to my 
mind that I will refer to. We have 
been very much exercised in our part 
of the country over our financial condi- 
tions. The young men and many of the 
fathers and husbands are under the ne- 



ELDER JESSE W. CROSBY.

cessity of leaving their homes to find 
employment, so that they may support 
their families in these dry times that 
we are passing through. The thought 
has occurred to us many times that if 
we could put forth the same energy 
and union in this direction that we 
manifest in keeping up the organiza- 
tion of the Church, it would not he 
necessary for us to leave home to find 
employment. I look forward to the time 
when in every village and city through- 
out the land where the people of God 
dwell, there will he industrial estab- 
lishments, where our young people will 
he taught to work in wood and iron, 
etc., and by means of which we will be 
able to produce all that is necessary 
for our support. How is it today? "We 
bring in from abroad that which we 
wear, and that which we eat in some 
localities. Nearly everything that we 
need has to be imported; at least, that 
has been the case with us for some 
years past, in consequence of the 
drouth. How it is that we can live 
and maintain this drain upon the peo- 
ple is a mystery to me. It certainly is 
an evidence that God is watching over 
us. In many of our homes we see the 
motto, "God will provide," and He, 
surely has provided for the colonies of 
the Latter-day Saints on the outskirts. 
I bear testimony to this today. God 
bless this people and the leaders of Is- 
rael, and may we be faithful and true 
to them, as they are true and faithful 
to the Church of Christ.is my prayer in 
the name of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER JESSE W. CROSBY, 

(Of the Presidency of Big Horn Stake.) 

In standing before you this morning 
and representing the Big Horn Stake of 
Zion — a new stake that has been or- 
ganized in "Wyoming — and in listening 
to the reports of the different missions 
and stakes, I feel that we still belong 
to Zion. The people of our stake have 
come from various parts; some from 
almost every county in Utah, some from 
Idaho, some from Canada, some from 
Mexico. They have formed themselves 
into a body of people there that are 



known and recognized as Latter-day 
Saints. To us who have gone there it 
has been a land of promise, and our 
gathering is a fulfillment of prophecy; 
for it was prophesied many years ago 
that the Saints would locate in the Big 
Horn basin and become a flourishing 
people. President Young prophesied in 
regard to this, as did Jesse "W. Fox, the 
well known surveyor, who went into 
that locality and discovered its re- 
sources. We believe that the Lord has 
held in reserve portions of that coun- 
try for His people. 

I do not think it necessary to say 
much about our country; in the due 
time of the Lord it will speak for itself. 
When compared with many places that 
the Saints have located in, it is cer- 
tainly a goodly land. The Lord has 
heard and answered the prayers of His 
people there, and the success that has 
attended our labors has been marvelous 
to us, as well as to those who have 
watched our operations. Quite a num- 
ber of eastern people have tried to col- 
onize in that land, but have r>een unsuc- 
cessful in taking out the water. They 
have had fto concede that the Latter- 
day Saints are natural colonizers, be- 
cause of the union that exists among 
them. In a little over two years we 
have opened a number of canals, our 
biggest canal being thirty-three miles 
long, and costing nearly $100,000.00. 
The water was taken out this year, go- 
ing the full length of the ditcn, and on 
the 23rd of June we commenced irri- 
gating, and have produced some crops. 
This will show what can be done on 
that soil. 

We have friends in that land. The 
governor of the state has been watching 
very carefully what the Latter-day- 
Saints were capable of doing. He says 
he has watched us with more than per- 
sonal interest, so that he might see 
what could be done to make some of 
that desert land fruitful. Since we 
commenced operations, companies from 
the east and the west have started to 
taking out canals. The officials of the 
state of Wyoming are treating us with 
all the courtesy that we could ask. We 
have come to regard Governor Richards 
as being unto us like Joseph was in

GENERAL, CONFERENCE. 



Egypt, and we feel very grateful to 
him. 

Many of those who have gone into 
the Big Horn country are poor people. 
They had more labor than they could 
utilize where they were living, the 
water resources being limited, and they 
either had to work for someone else or 
go without employment. They are now 
working for themselves, opening up 
farms and making homes. About two 
years ago we discovered that we were 
going to be short of provisions, many 
people having come in without sufficient 
to hold out until they could raise some- 
thing. The situation seemed somewhat 
serious; but the Lord openea the way, 
in answer to fasting and prayer. The 
Burlington railroad officials offered us 
contracts on their road, which we ac- 
cepted; and after fulfilling the contracts 
we received our money, and utilized it 
to the very best advantage. 

The people, I believe, are trying hard 
to make it a land of Zion, by keeping 
the commandments of the Lord thereon. 
We have a God-fearing people there, 
who are trying with all their hearts to 
serve God, and to make the land a 
place that the Lord will delight to bless 
because of the faithfulness of those who 
dwell there. 

May God bless Israel, and all who 
write and speak in favor of Zion, is the 
prayer of your humble servant, in the 
name of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER STEPHEN L. CHIPMAN 
(President of Alpine Stake). 

My beloved brethren and sisters, I 
rejoice in the privilege that I have of 
meeting with the Saints at the Confer- 
ence of the Church, to receive the in- 
structions which come from the lead- 
ing brethren of the Church. I never 
come to these Conference meetings 
without being fed with the bread of 
life. 1 have shown to me many places 
in my character that are weak, and 
when I depart from the Conference I 
feel strengthened in my faith and in 
my determination to go forth among 
the people and, if possible, make a 
greater effort to accomplish good. I 
have rejoiced in the testimonies that 



have been borne by my brethren. I 
have been exceedingly grateful and sat- 
isfied in my feelings with the manner 
in which these meetings have been con- 
ducted, wherein we have had the pri- 
vilege of listening to our brethren from 
far and near bear their testimony and 
tell of their work among the people. 

I have pleasure in reporting the Al- 
pine Stake of Zion, which is located in 
the north end of Utah county. It com- 
prises ten wards and four branches. 
The largest ward numbers about three 
thousand souls; the smallest about two 
hundred and fifty souls. In the ten 
wards there are now being erected 
seven meetinghouses, one of which you 
might term a magnificent tabernacle, 
which will cost in the neighborhood of 
$50,000 or $60,000. About two weeks ago 
we called the Bishops and the High 
Council of the Stake together and con- 
versed with them upon the condition of 
their wards, and we found the spirit 
of harmony existing among them. On 
the following evening we called togeth- 
er all the authorities of the Stake, and 
from them we also learned that the 
spirit of harmony and good feeling pre- 
vailed in their midst and with the peo- 
ple they are presiding over. The presi- 
dency of the Stake are united; the 
High Council are united. We can tes- 
tify that there is a good feeling pre- 
vailing in the Alpine Stakp. Tn pnitf* 
of the outlay of means in the erection 
of these meetinghouses, we are pleased 
to state that last year the people did 
not fall behind in their tithes and of- 
ferings. All the organizations of our 
Stake kept a record of their doings for 
the year 1901, upon loose leaves which 
were given to them for that purpose. 
These leaves were handed in at the 
end of the year.and have been compiled 
and bound in one record, so that we 
have the records of the different or- 
ganizations, together with the minutes 
cf the presidency of the Stake, all in 
one volume. The presidency of the 
Stake meet every week, to talk and 
plan for the welfare of the people. We 
have counseled our Bishops to do like- 
wise, as well as the presiding officers 
in the various organizations. We have 
secured individual tithing cards for 
every member who paid tithing in our 



ELDER URIAH T. JONES. 



(59 



Stake last year, which have been given 
to the Bishops to present to each tithe- 
payer. The card has on it the amount 
of tithing that the individual paid last 
year, and it contains space for the re- 
cording of his or her tithing for twenty 
years. We keep duplicates of these 
cards at our office. From the testimo- 
ny of the Bishops we believe that this 
will result in good. Only this morn- 
ing one of the Bishops reported to us 
that in delivering a card, the brother 
receiving it said he felt ashamed of the 
tithing that he had paid, and he has 
already paid a great deal more tithing 
this year than he paid during the whole 
of last year. The people are instruct- 
ed to bring these tithing cards at the 
time of settlement, so that what they 
have paid during the year may be 
placed on them. 

We know that our labors among the 
people are appreciated, from the fact 
that they are carrying out the instruc- 
tions which we have given them. Wa 
know that the gifts of the Gospel are 
among the people as they were ancient- 
ly. Not long since one of our members 
met with an accident in the little city 
of Alpine. A large hayfork ran in his 
body at the shoulder to a depth of 
fifteen inches. The physicians were 
called in to dress the wound, and they 
declared that his chances for living 
were very slim. His mother received 
a testimony at that time that he would 
live, and therefore told them that he 
would not die. The Elders were called 
in to administer to him, and in about 
two weeks the young man was out 
upon the streets, and is living today. 
There was another brother, who came 
to us to receive a blessing for his 
speech. He was of a stammering 
tongue. Before he went on a mission 
to which he had been called.he received 
a blessing at the hands of the presi- 
dency of the Stake, and word comes to 
us that he has been wonderfully blessed 
so that he is able to speak to the peo- 
ple in plainness and without difficulty. 
We have the spirit of prophecy, the 
gift of tongues, the gift of revelation 
and of great wisdom in our Stake, and 
we feel to rejoice that these blessings 
are with the people today as they were 
anciently. We also can testify that we 



know the Gospel is true, and that the 
men whom God has called to lead in 
the affairs of the Church are men of 
God. The teachings they give us are 
true and timely. If we live up to 
them, they build us up in our faith and 
make us better men and women . 

I pray that the Lord will bless us in 
our labors, and help us to magnify our 
callings, that our faith in Him may be 
increased, that our testimonies may be 
added upon, and that we may have 
strength and courage to perform every 
duty required at our hands, in the name 
of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER URIAH T. JONES, 
(President of Parowan Stake.) 

In facing this vast audience I feel 
that I am overrated; but I am very 
grateful for the honor conferred upon 
me in having the privilege of repre- 
senting the Parowan Stake of Zion. It 
is one of the oldest stakes in the 
Church, Iron county having been set- 
tled, I believe, in the fall of 1850. In 
the years 1853-4 iron works were start- 
ed in that county, and the population at 
that time was about as numerous as it 
is today. After the failure In the manu- 
facture of iron, the number of inhab- 
itants was reduced nearly three-fourths. 
Cedar City then had three hundred 
families, and in 1856-7 there were only 
about fifty families. We now have a 
population in that stake of a little up- 
wards of four thousand. We have all 
the auxiliary organizations of the 
Church in fairly good running order, 
and those who have charge seem to be 
alive to their duties. The tithing of 
the people is not as we would like it to 
be. Of course, we attribute that, to 
some extent, to the unusually severe 
drouth that that part of the country is 
going through at the present time, and 
which we hope will soon be broken. 
Numbers of our young men, the best of 
our communities, are moving to other 
places. During the last three years we 
have been under the necessity of or- 
ganizing the Young Men's association 
three different times, the presidencies 
having moved to other places. The 
present prospects are that our wonder- 



70 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



ful iron deposits will be developed. Of 
course, we cannot tell; we Aave been 
fooled so many times that it won't hurt 
us if we get disappointed again; but 
from what we can judge at present the 
time has arrived when they will be 
developed, and instead of our people 
moving away we will have room for 
many to move in. 

As I have said, I feel it an honor to 
have the privilege of standing before 
you for a few moments and bearing my 
testimony to the divinity of the mission 
of the Prophet Joseph Smith, and I 
pray that the blessings of the Lord may 
be with us as a people, that we may 
be as a light set upon a bill, that the 
people of the world, seeing our good 
works, may be led to glorify the name 
of our Father in heaven. In the name 
of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER CHARLES D. WHITE, 
(President of Beaver Stake.) 

My brethren and sisters, in standing 
before you here, I feel as Brother Jones 
stated, as if I was overrated, although 
I am very pleased to be numDered with 
the Latter-day Saints and to have the 
privilege of meeting with you in gen- 
eral conference. I endorse all the re- 
marks that we have heard during this 
conference. My testimony is that they 
are true, and that they have been dic- 
tated by the Spirit of God. The Beaver 
stake is in the southern part of this 
state, adjoining Parowan stake. While 
we have suffered in the past from 
drouth and frost, we have not the same 
reason to complain that they have. We 
feel that the Lord has blessed us abun- 
dantly, because we have very fair crops 
this year, and our prospects are bright. 
Beaver City, the capital of our county, 
is as nice a little city as there is any- 
where. We may not have the rich soil 
and the good climate that they have in 
other parts of the state, but we have 
as good water, as fine streets, and as 
clean a city as there is anywhere. We 
also have a Church school that we are 
very proud of — a branch of the Brig- 
ham Young Academy — and it is doing a 
great deal towards making Latter-day 
Saints. I tell the people of Beaver that 
the money invested in that school goes 



further towards making Latter-day 
Saints than the money they spend in 
sending their Elders out into the world 
to preach the Gospel, although we have 
Elders out in the world who send us 
very' encouraging reports of their la- 
bors. In that school we have many 
that will bear testimony, whenever op- 
portunity affords, that they have 
learned that the Gospel is true through 
being taught there. We think that we 
have the nicest place for a Church 
school that there is anywhere in the 
state. We have 240 acres of land, and 
quite a number of buildings. There are 
perhaps a hundred rooms rented at the 
present time to students who are at- 
tending the school, and we have room 
for more. The school is increasing 
each year. This is the fifth year of its 
existence, and we are very much en- 
couraged with it. We feel that the 
Lord is blessing the people of Beaver. 
I bear testimony that the Gospel is 
true. The Lord has certainly revealed 
His mind and will to His children in 
this age of the world, and there is no 
mistake about it. 

I pray that God will bless us, that we 
may be true and faithful to our call- 
ings and always be found steadfast and 
laboring for the advancement of the 
kingdom of God, in the name of Jesus. 
Amen. 



ELDER IRA N. HINCKLEY. 
(President of Millard Stake). 

My brethren and sisters, I feel full 
of gratitude to my Father in heaven 
and to my brethren for the privilege 
of standing here a few moments, not- 
withstanding I must confess that I 
have rather shrank from it. Listening 
to my brothers that are laboring as 
presidents of stakes, seeing the good 
spirit tha: has attended them and 
noting the good instructions they have 
given I felt that if I should be called 
upon I might not be able to interest 
the people as much which will probably 
be true. I was much pleased with "he 
remarks of Apostle Merrill this morning 
in regard to the great improvement 
made in this part of the country. I 
landed in this city in 1850. It was my 



ELDER GEORGE TEASDALE. 



71 



good fortune for a while to be a police- 
man on the streets of Salt Lake City, 
and I used to know where every in- 
dividual lived in the town, and where 
everyone sat when they came to meet- 
ing. But I was thinking if I was 
dropped down with my eyes blindfolded 
in some parts of this city now I would 
hardly be able to find my way out, it 
has made such a growth. 

I feel to endorse the remarks that 
have been made, and I assure you that 
on returning home I want to put into 
practice some of the things that have 
been told us, in which we are behind 
perhaps in our stake. We live just next 
to Beaver, and we border on to Juab 
stake. In listening I find out, as I al- 
ways do when I come to conference, 
that we are lacking in some things, anl 
that there is room for improvement in 
our stake. I am pleased with the oppor- 
tunity of coming to headquarters for 
the purpose of learning my duty, and 
I desire to be faithful in discharging 
it. I have struggled along and am a 
member of the Church yet, and I hope 
to continue to the end. I find that the 
greatest difficulty I have, under some 
circumstances, is to fellowship myself 
from the crown of my head to the soles 
of my feet, not being altogether satis- 
fied at times that I have done my full 
duty; but I assure you that I have been 
determined to do right although I may. 
not have been so strong as I might in 
fulfilling all that has been required of 
me. I am pleased to note the improve- 
ment of the Latter-day Saints. I want 
to tell you that I have endorsed the 
leaders of Israel all the day long. I 
have traveled with this Church some- 
thing over 60 years and I know a little 
about the people and the trials and 
hardships we have gone through; and 
when I see Zion at headquarters 
branching out over the hills enjoying 
plenty, dressing well, living well, I feel 
to r ejoice. 

We have all the organizations in our 
stake of Zion that are in the other 
stakes and they are in pretty good 
shape. We have been suffering more 
or less for three years from drouth, and 
we have sometimes lost good citizens on 
account of it, and sometimes we have 
had some go that we are glad went. I 



was very much pleased with the idea 
expressed by one of the brethren, that 
when people want to leave a stake ot 
Zion they should get a release. I tell 
you, I have always believed in standing 
to the rack, hay or no hay. That has 
been my motto all my life since coming 
to Utah. I have not been on preaching 
missions, but I have done some working 
missions. I love my brethren, I love 
the leaders of Israel, and I love and 
fellowship my brethren in the stake 
over which I preside. I know that the 
Gospel is true, and I pray God to bles3 
us in all our walks in life, that we 
may stand shoulder to shoulder, in 
touch with all the leaders of Israel 
and in touch with our Father in 
heaven. This is my prayer in the name 
of Jesus. Amen.

A promise fulfilled — Pleasure In preaching the 
Gospel — The Lord answers prayer — Union 
among the servants of God. . 

I have been exceedingly interested 
during this conference, and have re- 
flected upon the power of testimony 
that has been manifested here. Over 
50 years ago I heard this everlasting 
Gospel. It was then promised to me 
that if I would worship the living and 
true God, repent of my sins, accept of 
the atonement of Jesus Christ, and 
o'cey the Gospel, I should have the 
piivilege of a knowledge that God 
lived, that Jesus was indeed the Christ, 
that Joseph Smith was a true prophet 
tent of God, and that the signs fol- 
lowed the believer. I was told that I 
had to believe in God, the Maker of 
heaven and earth, the sea and the 
fountains of waters, and that I had to 
accept of the efficacy of the precious 
blood of Christ, which cleanseth from 
sin and sanctifieth the believer, and 
then I should receive the gift of the 
Holy Ghost, the Spirit of the Father 
which would reveal to me the things of 
God. This everlasting Gospel was 
preached to me in my early days. Af- 
ter some consideration I accepted it, 
notwithstanding it was so dreadfully 
unpopular; for the Latter-day Saints 
were nicknamed "Mormons," and th* 
doctrine they taught "Mormonism,"

and those who embraced it were looked 
upon as the offscouring of all flesh. I 
received the promised testimony, and 
after 50 years' experience I do most as - 
buredly know that God has spoken 
from the heavens, that Joseph Smith 
was a true prophet sent of God, and 
that this Church, now presided over by 
Presidents Joseph F. Smith, John R 
Winder and Anthon H. Lund, is thij 
Church of the Lamb. 

This everlasting Gospel is being 
preached in all the world for a wit- 
ness. I have had the privilege of trav- 
eling abroad to preach it. I labored 
for some time in the Southern States, 
declaring the message of salvation, and 
when I was released to come home I 
was sorry, for I was enjoying my la- 
tors so much among that people. No 
one could be treated any better than 
I was by the people of the Southern 
States. I never had to sleep out of 
doors, for the Lord always opened up 
the way for me. And I am so thankful 
to know that the Lord blessed the peo 
pie that blessed me. Those who threw 
open their doors to the Elders, who 
fed and clothed them, and who aided 
them in the work of the ministry, 
though they have not embraced the 
Gospel they will most assuredly re- 
ceive the recompense of reward from 
the Lord Jesus, our Master. We were 
representing the Lord Jesus Christ, noc 
ourselves. We were not beguiling the 
people by falsehood, by false dogmas or 
to. lish traditions; we were offering 
th<=m the Gospel of the Son of God 
with the promise that if they would re- 
pent and obey it they should be put in 
possession of a similar testimony and 
knowledge to that which we ourselves 
enjoyed. Love the inhabitants of the 
earth? Of course, we do. I have 
crossed the Atlantic ocean seven times, 
rot on pleasure trips, but in the inter- 
ests of the Church, and I know how 
the Lord has protected me and taught 
me. He will do the same to anybody 
else, if they will put their trust in Him 
and ask; for He has declared in the^e 
last days that if we will ask we shall 
receive, if we will knock it shall be 
opened unto us, if we seek we shall 
find. We do most assuredly know that 
this is true. 



These are the glad tidings that we 
take to the nations. We tell the peo- 
ple what opportunities are within their 
reach today, if they will only repert 
and obey the Gospel. We are pleased 
to do this, because we love the in- 
habitants of the earth. As Latter-day 
Saints we are frequently admonished 
to live our religion. I understand that, 
to live our religion is to love the Lord 
oiir God with all our might, mind and 
strength, and our neighbor as our- 
selves, and speak of all the best we 
can. I understand that to live my 
religion is to mind my own business, 
attend to my own affairs, work out n:y 
own salvation, and magnify my calling. 
I ".mderstand that to live my religion 
is to trust in the Lord and do good; to 
seek earnestly for the blessing of the 
Almighty, and to be filled with grati- 
tude to Him that I have the privilege 
of being a member of His Church, that 
1 have a living testimony, that I have 
become -sanctified through the precious^ 
bl.->od of Christ, and that I have th»* 
fellowship of the Holy Ghost. The Lord 
has said He would be enquired after, 
and I have enquired of Him for the 
last 50 years, and do most assuredly 
know that when I have asked for thct 
wrich has been necessary He han 
gi anted my prayer, having tested Him 
under many different circumstances in 
my labors. It has been my privilege to 
bear my testimony in many countries, 
and I have been thankful to Almighty 
God for the manner in which He has 
sustained me in all my travels. He 
has preserved me from all harm, ai'dt 
enabled me to accomplish His pur- 
poses. I have frequently said that if 
I had been as kind to myself as the 
...ord has been to me, I would have 
no reason to complain. I am thankful 
to declare the loving kindness of our 
Father in heaven. 

Ihere is a living testimony manifest- 
ed here. I shake hands with brethren* 
whom I knew 50 years ago, when we 
were brought into the Church by our 
Father in heaven; for the Lord Jesus 
Christ said, "No man can come to me, 
e>cept the Father which hath sent me 
draw him." I know that He drew me 
and enlightened my mind; I know that 
He drew my brethren and enlightened

them. They know it, too, and we are 
living witnesses, living monuments of 
His mercy, that in all the vicissitudes 
of life our Father has preserved us ani 
has filled our souls with gratitude and 
praise. He has given us the privilege 
of the higher education in His ho 1 }' 
temple, and of all the blessings of the 
n^w and everlasting covenant. There 
is nothing that we have and enjoy but 
has been given to us by Him, and we 
soy. All glory be to the Father, and 
to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost! 

I am thankful that I have the privil - 
ege of bearing my testimony upon this 
auspicious occasion. I am thankful for 
this conference, and for the testimony 
of my brethren. It has been sweet to 
me to listen to their voices, declaring 
the goodness of God to them. We can 
see what class of men the Lord has 
selected to be his ministers, humble, 
childlike, filled with the Spirit of the 
Lord. Do we love each other? We 
do; it is impossible for us to do any- 
thing else. May the Lord God of Israel 
bless these His servants in all then- 
outgoings and incomings. May they 
be established in His everlastirg 
righteousness, that their days ma> 
never fail, but that their testimony 
may be true and bright, so that they 
rray lay down their lives as members 
of the Church of Christ in full fellow- 
snip, to be received into the Church 
of the Lamb behind the veil, and to 
realize the promise, Blessed are they 
that have a right to the tree of life. 
If we can obtain a right to the tree of 
life, we will surely be members of the 
Church of Christ in good standing, to 
the glory of God our Eternal Father, 
through Jesus Christ. Amen. 



PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 

Possession of Priesthood not confined to a few. 

Although we may enjoy a little a>l- 
\antage over the rest of the congre- 
gation, for my part I could stay here 
a week longer to hear the testimonies 
of my brethren, and to give to the 
world an opportunity to see and know 
that the Priesthood in the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is 
not confined to one man, nor to three 



men, nor to fifteen men, but that there 
are thousands of men in Zion who 
hold the Melchizedek Priesthood, which 
is after the order of the Son of God, 
and who possess keys of authority and 
po-ver to minister for life and salvation 
amcng the people of the world. I 
would like to give the world an oppor- 
tunity to see what we are, to hear 
what we know, and to understand 
what our business is and what we in- 
tend to do, by the help of the Lord.

CLOSING SESSION. 

The choir sang: 

Though deep'ning trials throng your 
way, 

Press on, press on, ye Saints of God. 
Ere long the resurrection day 
Will spread its light and truth abroad. 

The opening prayer was offered by 
Elder Wm. C. Parkinson, president of 
Hyrum Stake. 

Singing by the choir: 

Hark! listen to the trumpeters! 
They sound for volunteers, 
On Zion's bright and flowery mount 
Behold the officers. 



ELDER JOHN W. TAYLOR. 

Ancient prophecies fulfilled in these days— The 
work of John and the three Nephites— Pre- 
paration for the coming of Messiah. 

My dear brethren and sisters, I nev- 
er enjoyed a conference better in my 
life than the one we are now holding; 
for I delight in hearing the workers in 
Zion express their views. This is a re- 
markable congregation, and last night 
we also had this house filled to over- 
flowing, with Sunday school workers. 
When I see these large congregations 
gathered together in the tops of the 
mountains it Alls my heart with joy, 
because I can see in it the fulfillment 
of ancient prophecies. Yesterday the 
choir rendered a beautiful anthem, 
suggesting that the mountain of the 
Lord's house would be established :n_ 
the tops of the mountains. The Proph- 
et Isaiah spoke of this. He was a great

prophet. He prophesied of the coming 
forth of our Lord and Savior Jesus 
Christ a long time before His birth in- 
to the world. He also prophesied of the 
coming forth of the Gospel in the dis- 
pensation of the fullness of times, as, 
well as the coming forth of the Book 
of Mormon. He said: 

"And it shall come to pass in the last 
days, that the mountain of the Lord's 
house shall be established in the top 
of the mountains, and shall be exalted 
above the hills; and all nations shall 
flow unto it. 

"And many people shall go and say, 
Come ye, and let us go up to the moun- 
tain of the Lord, to the house of the 
God of Jacob; and he will teach us of 
his ways, and we will walk in his paths; 
for out of Zion shall go forth the law, 
and the word of the Lord from Jeru- 
salem." 

Brethren and sisters, where did you 
come from? You came from the va- 
rious nations of the earth, and in your 
presence here is fulfilled one of the 
greatest signs that will ever be given 
to this generation before the second 
coming of our Lord and Savior Jesus 
Christ. 

When our Savior was among men he 
rebuked them because they took no no- 
tice of the fulfillment of prophecy. He 
said, "O ye hypocrites, ye can discern 
the face of the sky; but can ye not dis- 
cern the signs of the times?" He said 
further: "Ye hypocrites, well did 
Esaias prophesy of you, saying, This 
people draweth night unto me with 
their mouth, and honoreth me with 
their lips; but their heart is far from 
me. But in vam they do worship me, 
teaching for doctrines the command- 
ments of men." Jesus wanted to im- 
press them that they should rather 
look to the fulfilment of prophecy than 
to the precepts of men. He himself re- 
spected all that the holy prophets ut- 
tered. In His memorable sermon on 
the mount He said: "Think not that I 
am come to destroy the law, or the 
prophets; I am not come to 
destroy, but to fulfill. For verily 
I say unto you, Till heaven and 
earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall 
in no wise pass from the law, till all 
be fulfilled." 

The Prophet Jeremiah also prophe- 
sied concerning the gathering, in the 
following language: 



"I will take you one of a city, and 
two of a family, and I will bring you to 
Zion: 

"And I will give you pastors accord- 
ing to mine heart, which shall feed 
you with knowledge and understand- 
ing." 

When you find a pastor that will 
teach the children of men according to 
the heart of God, you will find one that 
has perfect reverence for the words of 
Jesus wherein He says, "Men shall not 
live by bread alone, but by every word 
that proceedeth out of the mouth of 
God." 

It has been eighteen hundred years 
since any one has come forth and testi- 
fied that they have seen the face of 
God, until among all the nations of ttu-> 
earth they are beginning to look upon 
the Eternal Father as an imaginary 
creature. Through transgression the 
Lord withdrew the Gospel from the 
children of men. Jesus foreshadowed 
this when He said to the Jews, "The 
kingdom of God shall be taken from 
you, and given to a nation bringi g 
forth the fruits thereof." He was fi- 
nally put to death, according to proph- 
ecy, and after His resurrection He ap- 
peared unto the Apostles. On one oc- 
casion they asked Him, "Lord, wilt 
thou at this time restore again the 
kingdom to Israel? And he said unto 
them, It is not for you to know the 
times or the seasons, which the Father 
hath put in his own power." Again, 
when His disciples asked him "what 
shall be the sign of thy coming, ai d 
of the end of the world?" He said, 
among other things, "And this Gos. el 
of the kingdom shall be preached in all 
the world for a witness unto all na- 
tions; and then shall the end come.'' 
He also said, "Jerusalem snail be trod- 
den down of the Gentiles, until the 
times of the Gentiles be fulfilled." Here 
are two remarkable signs that w* re 
to precede the coming of the Son of 
Man. 

Now, the Lord our God has opened 
the heavens in these last days, in ac- 
cordance with the prophecy of Jesus 
Christ, and the Father and the S n 
have appeared to the Prophet Jose; h 
Smith. The Gospel of Christ has been 
restored, in fulfillment of prophecy, and 
it is being preached in all the world 
for a witness, according to the predic- 



ELDER JOHN W. TAYLOR.

tion of the Savior. The Elders of Is- 
rael have stood up in your midst and 
spoken as they were moved upon by 
the Holy Ghost. "When you heard them 
you said in your heart that what they 
said was true; for behold it went 
through your systems like fire. God 
poured out upon you the convincing 
power of His Holy Spirit, and gave 
you a witness that the Elders were 
servants of God and were speaking un- 
der the influence of the Spirit of truth. 
Hence you yielded obedience to the 
Gospel. This also is in accordance 
with the words of Jesus wherein He 
says, "My sheep know my voice; but a 
stranger they will not follow." The 
voice of the Spirit of God led you out 
from the nations of the earth. As El- 
der Teasdale testified here this morn- 
ing, "No man can come to me, except 
the Father which sent me draw him." 
When that Spirit rests upon the hon- 
est in heart their greatest desire is to 
help build up the kingdom of God. 

A portion of Israel is now gathered 
together, but in a little while you will 
find another prophecy will be fulfilled, 
and that is the prophecy that Jesus 
made to the three Nephites who, hav- 
ing power over death, are still livirg 
upon this continent. He spoke to them 
of a time when they would perform a 
great and mighty work among the 
Gentiles; and that has not yet been 
fulfilled, but it will be. You 
will find that many districts where the 
Elders of Israel cannot reach will be 
penetrated by these men who have pow- 
er over death; and when the honest in 
heart see the power and authority that 
is with them, they will feel like Nico- 
demus did of old, (but I trust they will 
have more faith and courage) when he 
said, "Rabbi, we know that thou art 
a teacher come from God: ror no man 
can do these miracles that tnou doest, 
except God be with him." These three 
men are going to perform a great work 
in the program of the last days, as is 
the beloved disciple, John, whom Christ 
refers to when He says, "If I will that 
he tarry till I come, what is that to 
thee?" According to a revelation given 
through the Prophet Joseph Smith, the 
Savior said unto Peter, "If I will that 
he tarry till I come, what «s that to 



thee? for he desired of me that he might 
bring souls unto me, but thou desiredst 
that thou mightest speedily come un- 
to me in my kingdom. I say unto thee, 
Peter, this was a good desire, but my 
beloved has desired that he might d» 
more, or a greater work yet among men 
than what he has done before; yea, he 
has undertaken a greater work; there- 
fore I will make him as flaming fire and 
a ministering angel; he shall minister 
for those who shall be heirs of salva- 
tion who dwell on the earth." 

My testimony is that these men are 
going abroad in the nations of the 
earth before the face of your sons, and 
they are preparing the hearts of the 
children of men to receive the Gospel. 
They are administering to those who 
are heirs of salvation, and preparing 
their hearts to receive the truth, just as 
the farmer prepares the soil to receive 
the seed. The Lord has promised that 
He would send His angels before the 
face of His servants, and He does so. 

You are here, my brethren and sis- 
ters, in a gathered capacity, in fulfill- 
ment of prophecy. This is the day spok- 
en of by Jeremiah: 

"Therefore, behold the days come, 
saith the Lord, that it shall no more be 
said, The Lord liveth, that brought up 
the children of Israel out of the land of 

Egypt; 

"But, The Lord liveth, that brought 
up the children of Israel from the land 
of the north, and from all the lands 
whither he had driven them; and I will 
bring them again into their land that 
I gave unto their fathers. 

"Behold, I will send for many fishers, 
saith the Lord, and they shall fish 
them; and after will I send for many 
hunters, and they shall hunt them from 
every mountain, and from every hill, 
and out of the holes of the rocks." 

Brethren and sisters, your sons are 
fulfilling this prophecy today in the na- 
tions of the earth. Speaking of Zion 
that should be established in power 
and glory in the last days, the prophet 
says: 

"The Gentiles shall come unto thee 
from the ends of the earth, and shall 
say, Surely our fathers have inherited 
lies, vanity, and things wherein there 
is no profit." 

In conclusion, let me say to my young 
brethren and sisters and to my friends 
who are under the sound of my voice, 



76 



GENERAL, CONFERENCE. 



I know that God lives. I know that 
Jesrus Christ is the Redeemer of the 
world, and through His atoning blood 
all mankind may be saved, by obedience 
to the laws and ordinances of the Gos- 
pel which He has revealed in these last 
days through the Prophet Joseph 
Smith. I know that Joseph Smith was 
an inspired man, raised up of God to 
usher in the dispensation of the fulness 
of times; yea, that time which all the 
holy prophets looked forward to. My 
testimony is that through your faith 
and diligence in keeping the command- 
ments of God, every gift and blessing 
that He has ever promised unto the 
children of men is yours, whereby you 
can be brought back into the presence 
of our Father and crowned heirs of 
glory, immorta-ity and eternal life. Be- 
hold, this is the day of the Loid's prep- 
aration We are preparing for the 
coming of our Lord and Sa\ ior Jesus 
Christ, and His coming is near at hand. 
He will come in the clouds of heaven, 
with power and great glory. I also 
lestify unto you that the words of the 
Prophet Malachi are true when he said, 
"For, behold, th? day cometh, that 
shall burn as an oven; and all the 
proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, 
shall be stubble; and the day that com- 
eth shall burn them up, saith the Lord 
of hosts, that it slvll leave them. neith- 
er root nor branch." I say unto you 
when that voice goes forth among the 
children of men, "Lo, the bridegroom 
cometh; go ye forth to meet him," it 
will be a sorrowful day for the children 
of men. It will be a day of weeping 
and wailing among those who have 
taken "the broad way." As Jesus him- 
self has prophesied, they will cry for 
the rocks to fall upon them, to hide 
them from the wrath of Him who shall 
come; for no man can stand in the 
presence of God, except he be cleansed 
every whit from sin. 

May God bless you, my brethren and 
sistecs, and fill you with His Holy , 
Spirit, that your greatest desire may 
be to build up the kingdom of God up- 
on the earth, that we all may keep our 
garments clean and unspotted from 
the world, and strive to set an example 
worthy of imitation, that we may be 
justified of the Lord and be prepared 



for His coming; which is my prayer in 
the name of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER W. C. LYMAN, 
(President of San Juan Stake). 

My beloved brethren and sisters, I 
feel very humble in attempting to speak 
to you a short time, and I trust that 
the Spirit of the Lord may be with me, 
that my remarks may be appropriate 
to the occasion and applicable to those 
who may listen. 

I was sustained and set apart as the 
president of the San Juan Stake a little 
less than six months ago so that I am 
perhaps not as well acquainted with 
the conditions that exist there as I will 
be in the future. However in connec- 
tion with my counselors Brother Wil- 
liam Halls of Mancos and Brother Redd 
of Bluff I have visited the different 
wards that compose the stake. I be- 
lieve all the auxiliary organizations are 
in good running order. The stake cov- 
ers the southeast corner of the state of 
Utah the northwest corner of the terri- 
tory of New Mexico and the southwest 
corner of the state of Colorado; and all 
we lack to make us happy is a portion 
of the territory of Arizona that we may 
raise some of those large sweet pota- 
toes that Brother Kimball has been 
telling you of. We have some good 
county in the San Juan Stake and we 
have a good deal of the other kind. In- 
asmuch as the brethren have counseled 
the Saints not to move too much at the 
present time it would perhaps not be 
wise for me to tell you the advantages 
of that portion of the Lord's vine- 
yard. However, if any of you are dissat- 
isfied with your present homes and 
think you are not getting wealthy fast 
enough come dcnvn and visit 
us, examine our country, and you 
will certainly return home and feel sat- 
isfied to stay there. Some portions of 
our stake have been settled under pe- 
culiar conditions. One of the towns that 
we have there, when the first settlers 
•went into that locality they had to 
take their wagons to pieces and let 
them down over a perpendicular cliff 
nearly 40 feet high. Some of them nev- 
er came out again. I would like to men- 



ELDER JOSEPH B. KEELBR. 



77 



tion briefly trie history of one of our 
towns. For a period of years after it 
was settled it seemed as if it would be 
impossible to maintain the settlement. 
I believe the people once or twice asked 
the privilege of leaving there and going 
to a more favored locality. The ser- 
vants of the Lord told them that those 
who desired to leave were at liberty to 
do so and they could go with their 
blessings but that those who remained 
would be doubly blessed. Quite a num- 
ber of the members of that ward hai 
faith in the promise of the Lord, and 
they remained there, and that 
promise to them has been literally 
fulfilled. I presume that today there is 
not another ward in the Church, *with 
the same number of people, that pos- 
sesses the same amount of wealth aa 
this ward does. 

We are happy in that country. We are 
trying to keep the commandments of 
the Lord and to build up His Church :n 
that part of the vineyard. I love the 
cause in which we are engaged. I love 
the Latter-day Saints, and I love the 
men whom God has appointed to pre- 
side over us. I bear testimony that I 
do know that they have been called of 
the Lord, and that they are inspired b> 
His Spirit. I pray that the blessings of 
the Lord may accompany each one of 
us who have attended this conference 
to our homes and remain with us 
through life. May the Lord grant it. 
Amen. 

ELDER JOSEPH B. KEELER 
(Of the Presidency of Utah Stake.) 

It affords me much pleasure, my 
brethren and sisters, to represent be- 
fore you the Utah Stake of Zion. It 
has only been about twenty months 
since that stake was divided, and three 
stakes made out of it; but I can assure 
you that its spiritual welfare, and, I 
hope, its temporal welfare, has been 
enhanced by this movement. It seems 
as though our quarterly conferences 
and our general meetings are as well 
attended now as they were before the 
division. From the reports we hear 
from the Alpine Stake and from the 
Nebo Stake, it would seem that they 
likewise are prospering. The people, 



on the whole, are striving to keep the 
commandments of the Lord. I believe 
they are increasing in their tithes and 
offerings. They rejoice in the educa- 
tional advantages that they have. As 
you know, one of the great Church 
institutions is located in that stake — 
the Brigham Young academy. Its regis- 
tration last Friday evening in the high- 
er departments was 710 students, and 
140 in the preparatory * school. The 
stake is composed of seventeen wards 
and three branches, and all of the or- 
ganizations are complete, I believe. 

I have been much interested, as 
doubtless you have, in the reports that 
we have listened to today. It seems 
as though, when we are hearing these 
reports, we cannot refrain from ex- 
claiming, Zion is growing! We are liv- 
ing in the midst of the fulfillment of 
prophecy, as was remarked by Apostle 
Taylor. The faith and the testimonies 
of the people are increasing. I do hope 
that we will be able to follow the coun- 
sel and advice that is given to us from 
day to day by our brethren who are 
placed over us. I think it is wonderful 
counsel they are giving about remain- 
ing in the places where the Saints have 
settled, and have an inheritance there. 
I know full well that there is a rest- 
lessness among the people, even in our 
part of the land, where they are not so 
short of moisture as they are in other 
places. But the counsel to the Lat- 
ter-day Saints is, Remain where God 
has planted your feet, unless you are 
advised to go elsewhere. I believe 
that the Lord will send the former and 
the latter rains. He is not going to 
drive His children from this chosen 
land. We are in a position that we 
may know in the spring of the year 
whether there is a prospect for much 
or little moisture and it seems to me 
it would be the part of wisdom if we 
should govern ourselves in our farming 
interests by these conditions. There 
are some crops that we need not plant 
if we know there is going to be a short- 
age of water. It would be better for 
us if we would intensify that that we 
already have; farm less in these dry 
seasons, and cultivate it more thor- 
oughly, and in all probability we would 
get just as great returns. 



78 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



I have also been gratified to hear the 
counsel given regarding the betterment 
of the quorums in the Lesser Priest- 
hood. I acted for a number of years 
in the Bishopric and I know the diffi- 
culties the Bishops have to contend 
with. I have been a short time in 
the presidency of the Stake, and I com- 
prehend also the difficulties that have 
to be surmounted in that calling. I be- 
lieve that we should get nearer to the 
Lesser Priesthood. "We prepare, say 
the Seventies, to go abroad to preach 
the Gospel. Our Mutual Improvement 
associations tend toward this; our Sun- 
day schools in some respects tend to- 
ward this. But we find very little 
done for those who officiate in the 
Lesser Priesthood. I have rejoiced to 
see that a movement is now being un- 
dertaken to make more effectual the re- 
ligion classes. I hope the brethren will 
pay some attention to this. The breth- 
ren who hold the offices in the Lesser 
Priesthood need to have personal at- 
tention. They need to come in per- 
sonal contact with the Teacher. The 
trouble is 1 think, we talk to them at 
too long a range. They ought to be 
trained in their duties, the Deacon to be 
trained in his office, the Teacher in his. 
If the Teacher is a young boy, put him 
in care of some experienced man, and 
let him be taught the practical as well 
as the theoretical part of his calling. 
If our young men can be put through 
this system of training and education, 
the result will be, when they arrive at 
manhood they will be capable of going 
among the people and giving them good 
advice in their homes. One would 
think that the Seventy, coming from 
his mission, would be just the man to 
go among the Latter-day Saints in 
their homes; but that work is alto- 
gether different from the work he has 
been doing in the world. The work of 
proselyting is one thing, the work of 
Teacher among the Saints is another 
thing. Although they both belong to 
the Gospel, they are not quite alike. I 
feel to rejoice that the brethren have 
been advised in these matters, and I 
hope we will take these instructions 
home to our Stakes and wards, and put 
them into practice, that in the years to 
come we may have a valiant band of 
brethren of the Lesser Priesthood, or 



those who will act in that Priesthood, 
going among the people and teaching 
them their duties. May God add His 
blessings, is my prayer in the name of 
Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER MILTON H. WELLING 
(President of Malad Stake.) 

I rejoice exceedingly, my brethren 
and sisters, in the privilege I have had 
of attending this conference. .1 believe 
it has been the most inspiring specta- 
cle of my life. To hear the brethren 
who are laboring in the various mis- 
sion fields and in the Stakes of Zion 
report the progress of the work of God 
among the children of men is a testi- 
mony to me that the Gospel which we 
.have received is true. I believe if the 
young Latter-day Saints will make a 
careful study of the proceedings of this 
conference they will be able to obtain 
a testimony of the fulfillment of proph- 
ecy in the spread and development of 
this work. The Prophet Daniel saw the 
time when a little stone should be cut 
out of the mountain without hands, 
which should roll forth and fill the 
whole earth. Today we can see in a 
measure that this word of God is being 
fulfilled, from the reports given h_re 
by the servants of the Lord who have 
come from different parts of the earth. 

I am honored this afternoon in hav- 
ing the privilege of speaking to you 
for a few moments regarding the con- 
ditions that prevail among the people 
of the Malad Stake of Zion. The Ma- 
lad Stake was organized about fifteen 
years ago, with President Oliver C. 
Hoskins at its head. President H>s- 
kins remained as the presiding officer 
of that Stake until about seven month? 
ago, when I had the honor of being^ 
called to preside among that people. 
The Saints of the Malad Stake are 
united. They are laboring earnestly 
and devotedly, I think, for the upbuild- 
ing of the kingdom of God among the 
children of men. The Presidency of the 
Stake have visited all the wards, of 
which there are eleven, and two 
branches, and we find that the people 
are striving to the best of their ability 
to serve the Lord and keep His com- 



ELDER ANTHON H. LUND.

mandments. The Presidency of the 
Stake are united, and in my youth and 
inexperience I have been exceedingly 
blessed in my ministry among the peo- 
ple there by having two faithful, stal- 
wart counselors — Brother Gibbs, who 
has been associated with the Presiden- 
cy of the Stake since its organization, 
and Brother Ward, who has been pre- 
siding for the last twenty-two years 
among the Indians of Washakie. In 
that connection I may say that we feel 
proud of the fact that we have an In- 
dian ward in our Stake, thoroughly or- 
ganized, and with all the auxiliary or- 
ganizations. These Indians are endeav- 
oring to serve the Lord, and we feel 
that they are a credit to our Stake. 

My brethren and sisters, I desire to 
testify that the Gospel of Jesus Christ 
is true, and that those who are placed 
at the head of this Church are inspired 
of the Lord to perform the work that 
they have been called to do. I trust 
that the Latter-day Saints may go 
forth from this conference to the va- 
rious Stakes of Zion and carry the in- 
structions they have received to the 
home of every member of the Church, 
that this work may grow and prosper 
in the earth. This is my prayer in the 
name of Jesus. Amen. 



PRESIDENT ANTHON H. LUND. 

Importance of an education, secular and religious 
— Missionaries should avoid debates— The God 
we worship — Only the accepted standard works 
of the Church authoritative . 

This conference has been a very inter- 
esting one to me. It has been instruc- 
tive to hear the reports from the dif- 
ferent stakes and missions, given by 
those who are present; and as far as I 
have learned the conditions, I know 
that they have reported truly. 

I have one or two things I would like 
to speak upon, if the Spirit of the Lord 
shall lead me upon those subjects. 

Winter is coming, and during the 
winter time our day schools are all in 
session. We have an excellent school 
system in the state, and we desire to 
ask all parents to see to it that their 
children attend school and receive all 
the benefits they can from the schools 
in our midst. We have been accused 



of being an ignorant people, and that 
the authorities of the Church believe 
their strength lies in the ignorance of 
the people; but this is not the case. We 
do not want to foster ignorance. On 
the contrary, we desire that all our chil- 
dren shall enjoy the blessings of an ed- 
ucation, as far as it lies in our power 
to give it them. The Prophet Joseph 
said that no man could be saved in ig- 
norance. We look upon ignorance as a 
hindrance to salvation. Hence we want 
our people to be an enlightened people, 
an educated people, a people trained in 
all that leads to eternal life. 

Besides our district schools, *we hav«» 
schools instituted in our midst for the 
teaching of the principles of the Gospel. 
Last night we had a large congregation 
here of Sunday school workers. We 
would like our brethren and sisters 
throughout the stakes of Zion and in 
the different missions where Sunday 
schools are established, to see the im- 
portance of having all their children 
attend them /and receive the instruc- 
tions given there. We look upon the 
Sunday school as a very important or- 
ganization in our midst, and we are in- 
deed pleased that so much interest has> 
been taken in this matter. While 
speaking about Sunday schools, I want 
to mention the Juvenile Instructor, and 
to ask the parents to support that jour- 
nal and place it in the hands of the 
children. Remember that it belongs to 
the Sunday schools; and is not a pri- 
vate enterprise. Hence we ask the 
Sunday schools to be loyal in its sup- 
port, so that we can spend more means 
on improving it and making it what it 
ought to be — a journal in very deed for 
the instruction of our juveniles. 

Religion classes have also been start- 
ed in our midst; and now that 
the day schools are opened, we want 
these classes started, too, that the in- 
struction given in the district schools 
may be supplemented with religious in- 
struction. It is not intended, however, 
to mix the two. We cannot interfere 
with the state schools. We do not de- 
sire to take any rights from our friends, 
living here; but we do claim the right 
to see to it that our own children are 
given the privilege of learning that 
which we believe to be of the utmost

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



importance. Presidents of stakes ana 
Bishops of wards, we depend upon you 
to put forth a strong effort to the end 
that in every ward a religion class bt 
established, if there be not one already 
We have quite a number of Church 
schools, and we encourage our younj, 
men and young women to attend them. 
We are pleased to hear from all our 
academies that they have opened with 
better prospects than ever before. A 
greater interest seems to be taken in 
these institutions, and the First Presi- 
dency and the Church board of edu- 
cation, realizing the importance of this 
work, have made a greater appropria- 
tion in favor of it than ever before. We 
feel that the expenditure of means foi 
the education of our children in thesb 
schools is profitable. We cannot fully 
estimate the value of these institutions. 
It may cost us a great deal, but if we 
can saA-e if it were but one soul, how 
great will be our joy, saith the Lord. I 
believe these institutions will be the 
means of saving thousands of souls. 
In our academies missionary courses 
have been established, which many of 
our young men have been called to at- 
tend, in order to study the principles of 
the Gospel and get a systematic knowl- 
edge of the plan of salvation, so that 
when they go out into the world they 
may know how to teach that which 
they believe. These courses are doing 
a great deal of good. 

I started by saying that we want all 
to attend the district schools. Now, we 
have in this state an excellent univer- 
sity. There has been some talk that 
the First Presidency and other authori- 
ties of the Church were inimical to that 
institution, and did not want our people 
to send their young men and young 
•women there. We want it understood 
that this is not the case. In the past 
our legislatures have been composed 
mostly of men belonging to this 
Church, and they have made large ap- 
propriations in favor of that institution, 
to equip it and make it worthy the 
name of a university. We feel that 
our people should avail themselves of 
the advantages of that institution 
Many who go east for education could 
go to that institution and receive just 
as much, I believe, as they do at the 



eastern institutions of learning. We 
want it understood that we are not 
against the university, but we favor 
our people getting the advantages 
which it offers. Religion cannot be 
taught there, of course. There all sects 
and denominations must meet on neu- 
tral ground. But for the students be- 
longing to the Latter-day Saints it is 
possible that some means can be found 
whereby they could be given religioua 
instruction outside of the institution. 
If any of them could make arrangement 
to attend the theological course in the 
Latter-day Saints' university, it is open 
to them. 

When we were down south we en- 
couraged the people to also attend the 
Normal school established at Cedar 
City. We consider that these state 
schools are well equipped and supplied 
with able instructors, and that our 
young people can derive much benefit 
from them. In short, '.ve want to study 
how we can make the most of the edu- 
cational advantages in this state and 
in the other states throughout Zion, 
that ail our children may receive an 
education. 

In listening to the reports from the 
presidents of missions, I was pleased 
with one feature. Some of them said 
that the missionaries avoided debates 
and contention. I look upon this as 
the right course. Some there are who 
think we are afraid to meet anyone in 
debate. Not so. It is much harder for 
oup young brethren to keep from debat- 
ing than it is to engage in it; for they 
feel that they have the truth, and they 
are not afraid to meet anyune in de- 
fense of the principles in which they 
believe. But we have only one object 
in view in going out amongst the na- 
tions, and that is to follow the Master's 
instructions — to go out and teach men. 
That is our work. We do not go out to 
win battles as debaters; but we go out 
to teach men that which we have re- 
ceived, and which we know is true. 
If men are not willing to receive it, 
that is their own concern, not ours. 
When our Elders show the world the 
beauty of the principles of the Gospel 
as revealed to us, it is for men to say 
whether they will receive them or not. 
The Elders do their duty, and leave the 



ELDER ANTHON H. LUND.

result to the Lord. Those who seek to 
debate with our Elders and thirst for 
the honor of beating them in argu- 
ment, do not want to be taught; they 
simply want contention. Paul tells us 
to avoid contention. He said: "But if 
-any man seem to be contentious, we 
have no such custom, neither the 
churches of God." So we say; conten- 
tion is not our custom, and we advise 
our missionaries not to contend, but 
simply go out and teach the principles 
of the Gospel. 

Some there are who follow our Elders, 
and after they have preached the prin- 
ciples of salvation, these men get up 
and charge that the Elders do not be- 
lieve in God, but that they believe in 
Adam as their God, and they will bring 
up a few passages from sermons de- 
livered by this or that man in the 
Church to substantiate this charge. 
Now, we are not ashamed of the glor- 
ious doctrine of eternal progression, 
that man may attain the position of 
those to whom came the word of God, 
that is, gods. When Jesus was preach- 
ing unto the Jews on one occasion they 
stoned Him, and He wanted to know if 
they stoned Him for the good works 
He had been doing. Oh, no, they say, 
"for a good work we stone thee not; 
but for blasphemy; and because that 
thou, being a man, makest thyself God." 
To meet this, Jesus said: 

"Is it not written in your law, I said, 
Ye are gods? 

"If he called them gods, unto whom 
the word of God came, and the scrip- 
tures cannot be broken; 

"Say ye of him, whom the Father 
hath sanctified, and sent into the 
world, Thou blasphemest; because I 
said, I am the Son of God?" 

"We believe that there are gods, as 
the Savior quoted. He repeated what 
was written in the law, and He did 
Tiot say it was wrong, but used it as 
an argument against them. While, 
however, we believe, as the scripture 
states, that there are more gods, to us 
there is but one God. We worship the 
God that created the heavens and the 
earth. We worship the same God that 
came to our first parents in the Garden 
of Eden. In the revelation contained 
in Section 116 of the Book of Doctrine 
and Covenants the Lord speaks con- 



cerning Adam-ondi-Ahman, "the place 
where Adam shall come to visit his 
people, or the Ancient of days shall 
sit, as spoken of by Daniel the prophet." 
In the 107th section, the Lord speaks of 
Adam as "Michael, the Prince, the 
Archangel," and says that he shall be 
a prince over the nations for ever. We 
may with perfect propriety call him 
prince, the ancient of days, or even 
God in the meaning of the words of 
Christ, which I have just quoted; but 
we do not worship him, we worship the 
same God that he worshipped. When 
our missionaries are met with these 
sophistries and with isolated extracts 
from sermons, we say to them that any- 
thing that is a tenet of our religion 
must come through revelation and be 
sustained by the Church, and they 
need not do battle for anything outside 
of the works that have been accepted 
by the Church as a body. When men 
come with extracts from sermons, let 
them bring the whole sermon, so that 
the context can be taken to see what 
was the meaning of the preacher, and 
not bring a few isolated passages whose 
meaning can be twisted and distorted 
to something opposite to what was in- 
tended. Our brethren have a right to 
ask for this. They can defend the 
principles they teach by the revelations 
of God as contained in the Bible, the 
Book of Mormon, the Book of Doctrine 
and Covenants, and the Pearl of Great 
Price, the standard works of the 
Church; outside of these they need not 
go. Many of our Elders, when they 
go out into the world, have never 
heard of the things that are brought up 
against us, because they are not doc- 
trines believed or taught here. In re- 
gard to the young man who lately com- 
mitted a fearful deed, in New York, 
and the charge that the teachings of 
Mormonism had caused him to do it, I 
am safe in saying that the young man 
never heard at home in Zion a single 
thing taught by the people here 
in regard to the horrible doc- 
trine attributed to us by the 
world, called "Blood atonement," 
for nothing is taught either in private 
or in public that would lead to such 
a dreadful crime. It is only out in the 
world where we are accused of holding 
such views. I have alluded to the argu- 



82 



GENERAL, CONFERENCE. 



ments brought against us and the 
works considered by us as standards 
in order that our missionaries may not 
feel at a loss what to do. They know 
the works which have been accepted by 
the Church; they can read the word of 
God unto His people, both ancient and 
modern, and let them plant themselves 
firmly thereon. God bless you all. 
Amen. 



PRESIDENT JOHN R. WINDER. 
Temple work — The Sacrament— Fast offerings. 

While listening to the reports made by 
the Presidents of Missions, I thought it 
might not be out of place for me to say 
a few words in relation to some mis- 
sionary work done at home. I refer 
now to the work that is done in the 
house of the Lord. We have in the 
Salt Lake Temple about fifty mission- 
aries — brethren and sisters who have 
been called to that labor— and they 
work without compensation. Some of 
them have been on that mission for 
more than nine years. I have in mind 
one sister who has been working in 
the temple nine and a half years, and 
I do not know that she has ever missed 
a day during all that time, when the 
temple has been open. She is not quice 
as old as I am, but she is nearly 81 
years of age. If you will pardon me, 
I can say the same thing for myself: 
daring the nine and a half years I have 
never been absent from the temple one 
day when it has been open. 

1 will give you a few figures bearing 
upon the work that is being done in 
*he houses of the Lord. In the Salt 
Lake Temple, during the past six 
months, there have been 34,758 ordi- 
nances performed, and during the past 
year 73,060 ordinances. Since it was 
opened in 1893 there have been 726,924 
ordinances performed there. In all the 
Temples now in existence there have 
been 2,447,000 ordinances performed. 

This is a brief sketch of the work 
that is done by the missionaries who 
are called to work in the houses of the 
Lord. 

Be it remembered, brethren and sis- 
ters, that this Temple work was one 
of the most important subjects that 



the mind of the Prophet Joseph Smithy 
in his last days, was very much exercis- 
ed over. And it is an individual work. 
It is the duty of all who have relatives 
and friends on the other side of the 
veil to see that this work is done for 
them. These temples have been erected 
at great expense; millions of dollars 
have been expended on them; they are 
kept open at a heavy expense; and we 
ought to avail ourselves of the oppor- 
tunity to obtain blessings in them. 
There is room in them for all who de- 
sire to perform ordinance work. 1 
hope, therefore, you will take this into 
consideration, and remember the word* 
of the Prophet Joseph, that it is the 
duty of every person who has received 
ordinances for themselves to seek after 
their dead relatives. 

There is one more subject that I wish 
l o say a few words upon: it is in rela- 
tion to the administration of the Lord s 
supper. When visiting wards and 
stakes I have thought there is not that 
solemnity surrounding this ordinance 
ihat ought to be. It is a matter that 
J he presiding officers should look after. 
Call the attention of your people, when 
tJ-e sacrament is being prepared, to the 
sacredness of the obligations they are 
about to enter into. I remember the 
fiist time I ever visited a Latter-day 
Paint meeting after I obeyed the Gos- 
pel, that when the sacrament was pre- 
pared the presiding officer arose and 
spoke to those present in relation to 
tt-e obligations they were about to en- 
into, and time was given for any 
who had been overtaken in a fault to 
make confession before partaking of 
Ihe sacrament of the Lord's supper. I 
believe we are too careless in relation 
to this ordinance. When the bread and 
the water are passed around, we ar* 
too apt to partake of it in a mechanical 
"kind of a way, without thinking scarce- 
ly of what we are doing. Consequent 1 } , 
I call the attention of the presiding 
officers to this subject. 

One more subject I want to touch 
upon. Tour attention has been called 
to the fast offerings, and it has beeu 
en id that some stakes and wards had 
no poor, consequently they did not 
deem It necessary to fast. Don't you 
know, brethren and sisters, that a

blessing comes from fasting? It is 
not; so much the dollars and cents aa 
it is the blessing that we are afte i \ 
and unless we observe this we cannot 
expect the blessing. I could give you 
some statistics on this question that 
probably would astonish you, but I wtll 
say this: Last year $36,000 had to b^ 
drawn from the general tithing office 
to provide for the poor. Now, if the 
Latter-day Saints would observe this 
rule as they ought to, every Bishop 
would have abundance with which to 
supply all the poor in Zion. 

My brethren and sisters, during the 
three days we have been here, while 
hearing the brethren I have felt sev- 
eral times like shouting Hosanna, Ho- 
sanna, to God and the Lamb! In tn<? 
r.ame of Jesus Amen. 

PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 

"I hold in my hand a copy of the re- 
vised edition of the Pearl of Great 
Price. The" Pearl of Great Price, as it 
originally existed, was presented before 
the general conference and accepted as 
one of the standard works of the Church. 
Since then the book has undergone a 
revision; that is to say, all the revela- 
tions that it formerly contained which 
were also in the Book of Doctrine and 
Covenants, have been eliminated from 
it, as we thought it unnecessary to 
have revelations published in this book 
which were already published in the 
Doctrine and Covenants; therefore, 
these revelations have been eliminated 
from the Pearl of Great Price as it now 
is, and you will find them In the Doc- 
trine and Covenants. In addition to 
tbis, Professor James E. Talmage has 
gone through the work and divided it 
into chapters and verses, making it a 
far more convenient book of reference 
than it was before. He has also sup- 
plied copious footnotes or references, 
which will be an aid in the study of the 
book. 

These are the changes that have been 
made .in the book, and we now present 
this book in its revised form — the orig- 
inal matter being preserved as it was 
before, only divided into chapters and 
verses — for your acceptance as a stand- 
ard work of the Church." 



It was moved and seconded that the 
book be accepted as a standard work 
of the Church, and the motion was car- 
ried unanimously. 

President Smith then presented the 
authorities of the Church, first remark- 
ing that "we desire that the brethren 
and sisters will all feel the responsibil- 
ity of expressing their feelings in rela- 
tion to the propositions that may be 
put before you. We do not want any 
man or woman who is a member of the 
Church to violate their conscience. Of 
course, we are not asking apostates or 
non-members of the Church to vote on 
the authorities of the Church. We only 
ask for members of the Church in good 
standing to vote on the propositions 
that shall be put before you, and we 
would like all to vote as they feel, 
whether for or against." 

THE GENERAL AUTHORITIES 

of the Church were presented by Pres- 
ident Joseph F. Smith, to be voted up- 
on by the conference, as follows:

PRESIDENT SMITH 

read the following and in suitable re- 
marks gave it his hearty approval: 

Salt Lake City, Utah, Oct. 6, 1902.— 
An organization has recently been ef- 
fected under the direction of the gener- 
al board of the Relief Society of the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints, in which Sister Emma A. Em- 
pey was sustained as general supervis- 
or of the Relief Society nurses, with 
Sister Phebe Y. Beatie as secretary and 
treasurer, and Sister Margaret C. Rob- 
erts as instructor. 

It is desired that the Relief Society 
of every stake of Zion shall send as 
many young women as possible to study 
nursing, and that the presidents of 
stakes shall interest themselves with 
the Relief Societies and young ladies 
that the good work that has been start- 
ed here may be carried on, and that 
the sick and needy throughout all the 
settlements may have proper attention. 



The class will start Monday, Nov. 3. 
For further information see Relief So- 
ciety pamphlet, or write to Sister Phebe 
Y. Beatie at 55 North West Temple 
street, Salt Lake City. Emma A. Em- 
pey, general superintendent. 

PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 

Honor the Priesthood in their respective callings — 
Sustain the Church publications— President 
Snow's great and good work — Commendation 
of the auxiliary organziations— Closing ad- 
monitions. 

Six months ago we announced to the 
people in conference assembled that we 
expected to carry the Gospel and our 
testimony to the Saints as far as we 
had power to do it. I desire to say to 
this conference that we have fulfilled 
that promise to the best of our ability. 
Myself and at least one of my coun- 
selors, together with a number of the 
Apostles, have visited many of the set- 
tlements between here and Canada, 
holding conference in Canada and 
meetings in several of the wards there; 
and we have been as far south as St. 
George. We have attended the con- 
ferences of the people as far as our 
time would permit, and there has not 
been a Sabbath day that we have been 
idle. We have visited the Saints, borne 
testimony and declared the truth to 
them as diligently and faithfully as we 
had strength and time to do. What re- 
mains to be done, we hope, by the bless- 
ings of the Lord and continued health 
and strength, to be able in the future 
to accomplish it. Between now and 
next April we will perhaps be able to 
visit a number of the Stakes of Zlon, 
and Wards, too, which we have been 
unable to reach up to the present. We 
cannot afford to be idle. 

At this conference we have heard 
from nine Apostles-all that were in 
attendance. I regret exceedingly to say 
that President Brigham Young is con- 
fined to his room with serious illness; 
and while we hope and pray that the 
Lord may be merciful unto him and 
prolong his life, we feel, from ^ the 
knowledge we have of his condition 
and sufferings, that we will have to 
leave him in the hands of the Lord. If 
he had been present at this conference, 



86 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



we would have had all the brethren of 
the Twelve with us, excepting Brothers 
Lyman and Grant, who are in foreign 
lands laboring in the missionary field. 
Besides the Twelve, we have heard 
from almost forty presiding officers in 
the Church; and I only regret that we 
do not have the time to continue this 
work until we could hear from all the 
Presidents of Stakes, at least. But, 
brethren, do not be discouraged; if you 
will come next Conference we will give 
you a chance then. 

Furthermore, I want to say to the 
Saints who have listened to the breth- 
ren who have spoken unto us, that 
they are only an average of the Pres- 
idents of Stakes. We have not select- 
ed the brightest, the wisest and the 
best to speak to us. "We have taken 
those from the outer settlements, as far 
as we could, because we desired to 
have them heard here. We desire to 
recognize them, and we would like their 
people at home to realize the fact that 
they are recognized in the general con- 
ferences of the Church. I believe it to 
be the duty of the Church to recog- 
nize and acknowledge every man that 
holds an official position in it, in his 
sphere and in his calling. I hold to the 
doctrine that the duty of a Teacher :s 
as sacred as the duty of an Apostle, in 
the sphere in which he is called to act, 
and that every member of the Church 
is as much in duty bound to honor the 
Teacher that visits him in his home as 
he is to honor the office and counsel of 
the presiding quorum of the Church. 
They all have the Priesthood, they are 
all acting in their callings, and they are 
all essential in their place, because the, 
Lord has appointed them and set them 
in His Church. We cannot ignore 
them; or, if we do, the sin will be up- 
on our heads. 

We have had some excellent instruc- 
tions from President Lund and Presi- 
dent Winder of the First Presidency, in 
relation to the work in the Temple, to 
discussions and contentions, in the mis- 
sionary field, to the education of our 
children, to the maintenance of schools, 
to religion class work, and other mat- 
ters. I endorse their remarks. Presi- 
oj papuauiuiooaj osre SBq pun^ }uap 



us the Juvenile Instructor, of which 
the brethren have given me the honor 
of being the chief editor. I am not the 
only editor of this periodical. Brother 
George Reynolds is one of the editors; 
indeed he is the worker, the bee in that 
hive. He is always busy wherever 
you find him. So far as industry 
is concerned, I do not know a man in 
Israel that performs a greater multi- 
tude of duties and labors than George 
Reynolds does. He is always at work, 
and always has plenty to do. I desire 
to remind you too, that the brethren 
have done me the honor also of elect- 
ing me to be the editor of the Improve- 
ment Era, the organ ot the Young 
Men's Mutual Improvement associa- 
tion, Elder E. H. Anderson being ac- 
tively in charge. As the Juvenile In- 
structor belongs to the Sunday schools, 
and not to any individual or syndicate 
of individuals, in like manner the Era 
is the organ of the young men of 
Zion. No man has any interest or profit 
in it more than another; nobody is 
making money out of it, and nobody 
is getting any salary out of it, except 
one or two who have to be constantly 
employed in the office. We send the 
magazine to the missionaries abroad, 
and receive commendations from the 
Elders with respect to the good that ig 
being accomplished by doing this. We 
recommend the Improvement Era, as 
we do the Juvenile Instructor, to the 
youth of Zion, and we say that you can- 
not do better than subscribe for it, and 
have it in your libraries, and still bet- 
ter, read it. Nor do we wish to overlook 
the Young Woman's Journal, nor the 
Children's Friend. 

Brethren and sisters, we want you to 
be united. We hope and pray that you 
will go from this conference to your 
homes feeling in your hearts and from 
the depths of your soul to forgive one 
another, and never from this time forth 
to bear malice towards another fellow 
creature, I do not care whether he is a 
member of the Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints or not, whether he 
is a friend or a foe, whether he is good 
or bad. It is extremely hurtful for any 
man holding the Priesthood and enjoy- 
the gift of the Holy Ghost to harbor a 
spirit of envy, or malice, of retaliation, 



PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 



87 



or intolerance toward or against his 
fellow man. We ought to say in our 
hearts, let God judge between me and 
thee, but as for me I will forgive. I 
want to say to you that Latter-da* 
Saints who harbor a feeling of unfor- 
giveness in their souls are more guilty 
-and more censurable than the one who 
has sinned against them. Go home and 
dismiss envy and hatred from your 
hearts; dismiss the feeling of unforgive- 
ness; and cultivate, in your souls that 
spirit of Christ which cried out upon 
the cross, "Father, forgive them; for 
they know not what they do." This is 
the spirit that Latter-day Saints ought 
to possess all the day long. The man 
who has that spirit in his heart and 
keeps it there will never have any trou- 
ble with his neighbor; he will never 
have any difficulties to bring before the 
Bishop, nor High Council; but he will 
always be at peace with himself, at 
peace with his neighbors, and at peace 
with God. It is a good thing to be at 
peace with God. 

One year ago today, as near as I can 
recall, we were honored by the presence, 
and with the privilege to hear the voice 
of President Snow. Shortly after he 
was called home to his final account be- 
fore the great Judge of the quick and 
the dead. The Lord preserved his life 
to a goodly age, and I want to say that 
the Lord Almighty accomplished some 
things through President Lorenzo Snow 
that neither President John Taylor nor 
President Wilford Woodruff accom- 
plished in their day. Although the 
same questions had been brought be- 
fore them, yet they were never thor- 
oughly decided and settled until Presi- 
dent Snow did it. Therefore, I say, all 
honor and praise be unto that instru- 
ment in the hands of God of establish. 
Ing order in the midst of uncertainty, 
and certain rules by which. we know oui 
bearings. I wish to mention this, be- 
cause I feel in my heart to thank the 
Lord for President Snow, and to honor 
iiim as the instrument in His hands 
of accomplishing his mission, for which 
the Lord preserved him so long in life. 
He lived to bear his testimony to the 
world that Joseph Smith the Prophet 
taught him the doctrine of celestial 
marriage. He lived to declare to the 



world that he knew positively that Jo- 
seph Smith did receive it by revelation 
ajnd that that doctrine was true and of 
God. And if he had done no more than 
this he would have accomplished a 
great work, because he was a living 
witness, an eye-witness and an ear- 
nvitness, and he knew whereof he 
spoke. You and I will have to meet his 
testimony, and so will the people of 
the world; and when we go to give an 
account of that which we have heard 
and known in the world, we can not 
dodge this, but will be held to an ac- 
count for it, just as sure as the Lord 
lives and President Snow did his duty. 

I want to say a few words to the 
Mutual Improvement associations. You 
young men and young women, officers 
of the Mutual Improvement associa- 
tions, I implore you to go from thia 
conference and do your duty. Look af- 
ter the wayward, the disobedient, the 
thoughtless, and the indifferent. It is 
necessary that they should be guarded 
and looked after. As it has been ex- 
pressed here time and again, it is bet- 
ter for us to save our own boys who are 
being misled at home, than It is for us 
to go out into the world and spend 
years of time and endless means in 
order to gather in a few people from 
the world, while some of our own boys 
and girls need redemption as much as 
they, besides these people of the world 
are so full of the traditions and super- 
stitions of their fathers when they 
gather to Zion that it is difficult, if not 
impossible, for them to entirely over- 
come these traditions and get down to 
a full comprehension of the Gospel and 
a complete reception of the truth. Yet 
a soul saved out in the world is as 
precious in the sight of God as a soul 
saved at home. But we have work to 
do right at home, at our own doors; 
and it will not do for us to neglect the 
work necessary to be done at our own 
thresholds, and then go out into the 
world to do work that is no more neces- 
sary. Let us do our duty everywhere. 

I desire to speak a word of commen- 
dation of the Primary associations. The 
sisters who are engaged in this noble 
work are most worthy women and very 
energetic in their labors. They are ac- 
complishing a wonderful work. It is 



88 



GENERAL, CONFERENCE. 



soul-inspiring, delightful and encourag- 
ing to see the results of the labors of 
these sisters. I commend this work to 
the attention of presiding officers every- 
where, and would ask that the Bishops 
encourage and foster not only the Sun- 
day schools and the Improvement asso- 
ciations, but also the Primary associa- 
tions; for theirs is a work necessary to 
be done among the little children, 
which cannot be done, it would appear, 
in any other way. 

Furthermore, I desire to commend the 
work of the Relief Society, an organ- 
ization that was effected by the Prophet 
Joseph Smith. The objects of this or- 
ganization are manifold. It is not de- 
signed to look only after the poor and 
the needy as to their bodily necessities, 
but it is also intended to look after the 
spiritual, mental and moral welfare cf 
the mothers and daughters in Zion, and 
all who are engaged or interested in fe- 
male work. I commend the Relief So- 
cieties to the Bishops, and say, be 
fnendly to these organizations, be- 
cause they are auxiliary organizations 
and a great help to the Bishops. 

I regret very much indeed that we 
*ave not had time to hear from the 
Seven Presidents of Seventies, but nei- 
ther they nor you need to feel very bad 
about it, because we expect to send them 
out to visit you. If you have not nad 
the prilvilege of hearing them here, we 
will let you hear them at your homes. 
It is their business to preach the Gos- 
pel, and another time they may have a 
chance to preach it to you here. I 
would love to have heard them and — I 
was going to say — hundreds of others, 
whom we would like to have heard, if 
time would permit. 

I now say to the brethren of the 
Priesthood — the High Priests, the Sev- 
enties, the Elders, and the Lesser 
Priesthood— magnify your callings; 
study the scriptures; read the 107th 
section of the Book of Doctrine and 
Covenants, on Priesthood; learn that 



revelation, which was given through 
the Prophet Joseph Smith, and live by 
its precepts and doctrine, and you will 
gain power and intelligence to straight- 
en out many kinks that have hereto- 
fore existed in your minds, and to clear 
up many doubts and uncertainties in 
relation to the rights of the Priesthood. 
God gave that word to us. It is in 
force today in the Church and in the 
world, and it contains instruction to 
the Priesthood and the people in rela- 
tion to their duties, which every Elder 
should know. 

I will say now to all of the Latter- 
day Saints, Let us live our religion; let 
us pay our tithing and be blessed; iet 
us remember the poor and the needy, 
and sustain and help them; let us visit 
the sick and afflicted, and admlnster 
consolation unto them; let us help the 
weak; let us- do all in our power to 
build up Zion, to establish righteous- 
ness in the earth, and to plant in the 
hearts of the people the glorious truth 
that Jesus is the Christ, the Redeemer 
of the world, that Joseph Smith is a 
prophet of the living God, whom the 
Lord raised up in these last days to 
restore the everlasting Gospel and the 
power of the Holy Priesthood to the 
world. 

That the Lord may help us to accom- 
plish this work, and sustain us in every 
good word and work, is my humble 
prayer in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

The choir sang, 
We Thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet. 

The benediction was pronounced by 
Elder Charles W. Penrose, counselor in 
the Presidency of the Salt Lake Stake. 

Conference adjourned for six months. 



The stenographic work, in taking a full 
account of the speeches, was done by- 
Elder Arthur Winter.

Clerk of Conference. 



SEMI-ANNUAL SUNDAY SCHOOL CONFERENCE. 

Preliminary Meeting of Superintendents. 



The superintendents and assistants 
of the Sunday schools of the various 
stakes of Zion met with the Deseret 
Sunday School Union board, at room 
No. 25 of the Lion House, Salt Lake 
City, at 6 o'clock on the evening of 
Sunday, October 5, 1902, for the consid- 
eration of special business. The call 
was made by the general superintend- 
ency. Thirty-five stakes were repre- 
sented. 

The brethren sang, "Redeemer of 
Israel," and prayer was offered by El- 
der James H. Linford. 

Elder George D. Pyper brought up 
the subject of the Juvenile Instructor 
and stated that a subscription v of 8,300 
was secured last year and this had in- 
creased to 8,800 during the present sea- 
son with the prospect of reaching what 
the board desired by the end of the 
year — nine thousand subscribers. It was 
claimed, however, that the list should 
be increased to at least 10,000 during 
1903, and Elder Pyper asked the sup- 
port of the officers in behalf of the 
magazine and urged upon them the 
necessity of reading it themselves in 
order to keep up with the Sunday school 
work. 

Elder George M. Cannon offered the 
following resolution: 

"Resolved, that as stake superintend- 
ents of Sunday schools we make an 
earnest effort to increase the number 
of subscribers to the Juvenile Instruct- 
or in our respective stakes at least ten 
per cent." 

After some remarks the resolution 
was adopted. 

Elder Joseph "W. Summerhays said 
that the board was simply the agent of 
the schools in publishing the Juvenile 
Instructor, but it was plain to all that 
the Sunday school organization needed 



an organ and the Instructor was a. 
necessity; all the board asked was that 
the stake and ward officers and work- 
ers should bear their part of the burden. 

Elder Summerhays also stated that 
the board would like a Sunday School 
Union organized in every stake of Zion; 
that it was recommended that a Sunday 
school conference be held in each ward 
once a year; that stake Sunday school 
officers should go into the by-ways and 
corners and mining towns and organize 
Sunday schools wherever possible. No- 
town, village, settlement or camp 
should be without its Sunday school. 

Elder Horace Cummings related his 
experience in organizing a Sunday 
School Union in Juarez Stake, Mexico. 
All schools were represented except one 
composed of two families, living one 
hundred and fifty miles away. There 
were two hundred and ninety-nine pre- 
sent, and it took a month for some 
of the workers to come to the meetings 
and return to their homes. This, he 
thought, a complete answer to those 
who object to the organization of a 
union because of the scattered condition 
of the people of their stakes, as very 
few stakes are as scattered as Juarez, 
and yet they made a great success of it,, 
and he believed great good would fol- 
low. 

Elder Joseph M. Tanner then an- 
nounced the near completion of the 
Sunday school plans, and stated that, 
subject to the printer's ability to do the 
work, the committee hoped to have the 
plans in the hands of the teachers by 
December 1st. 

General Treasurer George Reynolds 
submitted a proposition to offer premi- 
ums of ten volumes of the Juvenile In- 
structor to the stake remitting the 
nickel donation to the general treasurer 



90 



DESERET SUNDAY SCHOOL UNION. 



by December 1, 1902, and five volumes 
to the stake remitting by January 1, 

1903. 

On motion of Elder David O. McKay 
the offer was amended so as to require 
a payment of a full one hundred per 
cent of the nickel fund based on last 
year's report of enrollment, and on mo- 
tion the time of payment was changed 
to December 15th and January 15th, in- 
stead of December 1st and January 1st. 

Elder Thomas C. Griggs stated that 
with the exception of one stake and 
part of another all the jubilee histories 
had been sent to the various stakes in 
accordance with the resolution adopted 
by the stake officers, and there was still 
some $1,100 due. It was thought suf- 
ficient time had now been given and 
that these accounts should be squared 
up. 

The meeting then adjourned with the 
benediction by Elder Seymour B. 
Young. 



GENERAL MEETING. 

The General Semi-Annual Conference 
of the Sunday schools of the Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was 
held in the Tabernacle, Salt Lake City, 
Utah, Sunday evening, October 5, 1902, 
at 7:30 o'clock, General Superintendent 
Joseph F. Smith presiding. There were 
present, of the General Superintend- 
ency, Joseph F. Smith, George Rey- 
nolds, and Joseph M. Tanner; most of 
the members of the Sunday School 
Union board, several Apostles, officers 
and representatives from forty-three 
stakes, the absentees being Bingnam, 
Maricopa, St. Johns, Sevier, Snowflake, 
Star Valley, and Union. Three mis- 
sions were also represented, viz: Cali- 
fornia, Colorado and the Northern 
States. 

This congregation of Sunday school 
officers and teachers and those interest- 
ed in the work formed probably the 
largest Sunday School Union meeting 
ever held in the Church. 

The conference was opened by the 
Tabernacle choir, led by Professor Evan 
Stephens, singing the anthem, "Let the 
Mountains Shout for Joy." Prayer was 
offered by Elder Reuben G. Miller of 
Emery Stake. 



The choir then sang, "From afar, 
Gracious Lord." 

General Secretary George D. Pyper 
then called the roll, which was respond- 
ed to by forty-three stakes and three 
missions, as before stated. The secre- 
tary also presented the general Sunday 
school authorities, who were sustained 
as follows: 

Joseph F. Smith, General Superin- 
tendent. 

George Reynolds, First Assistant Gen- 
eral Superintendent. 

Joseph M. Tanner, Second Assistant 
General Superintendent. 

Members of the Board: Joseph F. 
Smith, George Reynolds, Joseph M. 
Tanner, Thomas C. Griggs, Jos. W. 
Summerhays, Levi W. Richards, Fran- 
cis M. Lyman, Heber J. Grant, George 
Teasdale, Hugh J. Cannon, Andrew 
Kimball, John W. Taylor, L. John Nut- 
tall, James W. Ure, John F. Bennett, 
John M. Mills, William D. Owen, Sey- 
mour B. Young, George D. Pyper, Hen- 
ry Peterson, Anthon H. Lund, John R. 
Winder, James E. Talmage, George M. 
Cannon, Horace Cummings. 

George D. Pyper, General Secretary. 

George Reynolds, Treasurer. 

Thomas C. Griggs, Business Manager. 

SECOND ASSISTANT SUPERIN- 
TENDENT JOSEPH M. 
TANNER. 

I am pleased to see so many present 
who are evidently interested In the 
great Sunday school cause; and I ask 
an interest in your faith and prayers 
that I may have the Spirit of God in 
the remarks which I may make. 

The Sunday school work is something 
that comes home to us all and especial- 
ly is it important to the home; and all 
those who look forward to the establish- 
ment of home, its elevation, its inspira- 
tion, must of necessity be particular 
friends of the Sunday school. It la 
that great organization of the Church 
used for the training of our children in 
spirit and mind, and therefore the 
methods adopted for its work are im- 
portant, and the amount of the work is 
a matter in which the Deseret Sunday 
School Union board is greatly interest- 
ed. 



DESERET SUNDAY SCHOOL. UNION. 



91 



There have heen remarkable changes 
In the Sunday schools in some of the 
stakes of Zion within the last few years. 
These changes are so great In some in- 
stances that it is hardly possible to real- 
ize the improvements made. The in- 
tense interest and enthusiasm that have 
been awakened have almost revolution- 
ized some stakes. It has been a matter 
of great importance to the Union board 
to learn what has been the cause of 
these changes and why some stakes 
have advanced so much more rapidly 
than others, though no doubt all the 
stakes of Zion are ambitious to be in 
the first rank. One important cause is 
found in the fact that the teachers and 
students are now preparing tnemselves 
in their lessons before going into the 
Sunday schools. The teachers have 
union meetings, and once a month as- 
semble and give instructions. It is now 
required of the teachers that they be 
prepared in advance before going 
into the school room, and this prep- 
aration of the teacher leads to 
preparation on the part of the pu- 
Til- The Deseret Sunday School Union 
board have noticed that these changes 
have been due to program and out- 
lines prepared in advance; and in con- 
sequence it was proposed that uni- 
form outlines be prepared for all the 
stakes of Zion, so that every Sunday in 
the year there is a lesson for the teach- 
ers to give. The plans will be uniform 

In the past some classes have spent 
j ears reading the Scriptures without 
any aim, and little children have been 
required to take up subjects not suited 
to them; subjects away beyond their 
years. "We have endeavored to get up 
p.'ans embodying the experience of the 
union board, stake boards, and teachers 
of ability, and by the first of Decem- 
ber we hope to have the work in the 
hands of all the Sunday schools of the 
Church, that the teachers may begin 
their work on the first Sunday in Jan- 
uary, 1903. Teachers, I desire to call 
your attention to the importance of 
preparation on your part. Some of the 
subjects cannot possibly be taught by 
the teachers not prepared before going 
to their classes. 

It is desired that teachers should be 
more familiar with the Scripture. Read 
it in your homes. This will lead the 



pupils to study, and if the children real 
at home what an encouragement it will 
be to the parents! It will all result in 
families gathering around the fireside, 
reading the Scriptures and preparing 
i:ssons for the next Sunday. Home 
reading is a beautiful habit and a taste 
for it should be encouraged by exam- 
ple; it is not enough to admonish chil- 
dren to read. 

I have been asked when children 
should be taught the reading habit, and 
in answer I would say: Before they are 
old enough to read. If parents them- 
selves will adopt the practice of reading 
aloud the children will be encouraged 
to read as soon as they are able to do 
eo. There is no more beautiful habit 
than for a father or mother to read to 
their children in the evening. It will 
correct pernicious inclinations. This 
new plan should create a new love for, 
and interest in the Bible, Book of Mor- 
mon, Doctrine and Covenants and 
Church works. The first volume of 
the History of the Church is just is- 
sued, and it should be in the home of 
every Latter-day Saint, as it is pub- 
lished at so low a price that it is with- 
in the reach of all. 

We are especially anxious to encour • 
age self-effort on the part of the young 
that they may realize the value of these 
good books, and that it will be dis- 
creditable to them not to understand 
the Scriptures and their own history. 
What a lovely thing it is to see a model 
home! It is a credit and an honor to 
any man to have a good family, and 
we respect those God-fearing men who 
are examples in the homes for uphold- 
ing its purity, its enlightenment and its 
stability. We better help our country 
when we perform our duties in the 
home and in the Sunday school. 

God bless our leader, a man among 
men, fitted in every way to stand at 
the head of this great work; and may 
all who labor for the advancement of 
the Sunday school interests find their 
reward a thousand fold; I ask in the 
name of Jesus. Amen. 

PRESIDENT ANTHON H. LUND. 

My dear brothers and sisters: I re- 
joice in seeing the interest the Latter- 
day Saints take in the Sunday school

work. This is the largest organization 
in the Church, and I believe in every 
ward, and in every branch of the 
Church where there are children we 
have a Sunday school. There is a grow- 
ing desire to make these schools inter- 
esting to the children. I am pleased 
with the steps taken to have the work 
laid out beforehand and the lessons 
planned so that the teachers and chil- 
dren may be prepared for their Sunday 
mornings' work. It is a great work: 
That of teaching the children the plan 
of salvation and the moral law. Our 
Sunday schools are used for this pur- 
pose. We believe there is hardly an 
organization in the Church that has 
such far-reaching consequences as the 
Sunday school. The work done there is 
not only for the present, but it will 
leave its imprint in the years to come. 

Sunday school teachers should be ex- 
emplary men who teach not only by 
precept but by example. If you want 
children to do right show them the 
way. The teacher who indulges in 
things forbidden in the Word of Wis- 
dom will not accomplish much in teach- 
ing the children. The little ones soon 
find out the teacher's way and manner 
of living and the effort to instruct will 
be in vain. If you want to have in- 
fluence with the children show them 
that you are in earnest and believe 
what you teach and mean it, and thus 
load them in the paths of virtue and 
right. 

The Sunday school is not only for the 
education of the head but we must 
reach the heart; we must make the 
children love that which is right; mah- 
them love virtue for virtue's sake; 
make them have an abiding faith in 
God their Creator, and a knowledge 
of the infinite love shown to all man- 
kind by the Redeemer; to partake of 
that love which must show itself in 
good works. 

Teachers, this is a noble work in 
which you are engaged. Go to your 
secret chamber and there pray that th<- 
Spirit of God may be with you; that 
you may secure the love and confidence 
of the little ones placed in your care. 
And that you may succeed in this great 
work I ask in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 



GENERAL, SUPERINTENDENT 
JOSEPH F. SMITH. 

My beloved brethren and sisters: I 
do not intend to say very much on 
this occasion. There are many breth- 
ren present who have subjects upon 
their minds and I desire to give them 
aij much time as possible. But I feel 
like saying something in relation to 
our children. It does not need argu- 
ment to convince our minds that our 
children will be just about what we 
make them. They are born without 
knowledge or understanding — the most 
helpless creatures of the animal crea- 
tion born intq^the world. The little one 
begins to learn after it is born, and 
all that it knows greatly depends upon 
its environment, the influences under 
which it is brought up, the kindness 
with which it Is treated, the noble ex- 
amples shown it, the hallowed influ- 
ences of father and mother, or other- 
wise, over its infant mind. And it will 
be largely what its environment and 
its parents and teachers make it. 

The child of the lowest of our na- 
tive tribes born in a wigwam and the 
child born in luxury start out almost 
equal so far as the possibilities of 
learning are concerned. A great deal 
depends upon the influences under 
which it is brought up. You will ob- 
serve that the most potent influence 
over the mind of a child to persuade it 
to learn, to progress, or to accomplish 
anything is the influence of love. More 
can be accomplished for good by un- 
feigned love, in bringing up a child, 
than by any other influence that can be 
brought to bear upon it. A child that 
cannot be conquered by the lash, or 
subdued by violence, may be controlled 
in an instant by unfeigned affection 
and sympathy. I know this is true; 
and this principle obtains in every 
condition of life. 

The Sunday school teacher should 
govern the children, not by passion, by 
bitter words or scolding, but by affec- 
tion and by winning their confidence. If 
a teacher gets the confidence of a child 
it is not impossible to accomplish every 
desired good with that child. 

I would have it understood that I be- 
lieve that the greatest law and com- 
mandment of God is to love the Lord 
our God with all our mind, might and

strength, and our neighbors as our- 
selves; and if this principle is observed 
at home the brothers and sisters will 
love each other, they will be kind and 
helpful to one another, showing forth 
the principle of kindness and being 
solicitous for each other's good. Under 
these circumstances the home comes 
nearer being a heaven on earth, and 
children brought up under these influ- 
ences will never forget them, and 
though they may be in trying places 
their memories will revert to the homes 
where they enjoyed such hallowed in- 
fluences, and their better natures will 
assert themselves no matter what the 
trials or temptations may be. 

Brethren and sisters of the Sunday 
school, I emplore you to teach and con- 
trol by the spirit of love and forbear- 
ance until you can conquer. If children 
are defiant and difficult to control, be 
patient with them until you can con- 
quer by love and you will have gained 
their souls, and you can then mould 
their characters as you please. 

Sometimes children do not like their 
teachers, and the teachers are impa- 
tient with the children and complain 
of them as being very uncouth, uncon- 
trollable and bad. The children in their 
turn tell their parents honv they despise 
their teacher and say they don't want 
to go to school any more because the 
teacher is so cross. I have heard of 
these things and know them to be true. 
On the other hand, if children say to 
father or mother, "We think we have 
the best teacher in the world in our 
Sunday School," or "We have the best 
teacher in our district school that ever 
lived," it proves that those teachers 
have won the affections of the children, 
and the little ones are as clay in the 
hands of the potter to be moulded in any 
shape desired. This is the position you 
teachers should occupy, and if you get 
their affections this will be the report 
the children will make regarding you. 
God bless you. Amen. 

"Scatter Seeds of Kindness" was 
beautifully sung by a ladies' quartette 
from the Eleventh ward, Salt Lakt 
City. The quartette was composed of 
Sisters Maggie Bassett, Etta Felt, Olive 
Cushing and Anna "Vine. 



JOSEPH W. SUMMERHAYS. 

I trust, my brethren and sisters, that 
during the few moments I may address 
you I may have the Spirit of the Lord 
to dictate my remarks. 

Previous to coming to this meeting 
the Deseret Sunday School Union Board 
met with the stake superintendents; 
and one of the subjects spoken upon 
at that meeting I desire to speak of 
here. I have reference to cottage Sun- 
day Schools and to looking after wards 
which have no Sunday Schools estab- 
lished. 

Some years ago in a near-by stake 
there was a certain mining camp with- 
out any Sunday School organization. A 
brother was called upon a mission to 
visit the locality, search out the Latter- 
day Saints and effect an organization. 
He did so, and by the blessing of the 
Lord his efforts were crowned with 
success. A Sunday School was organ- 
ized, and it has grown and increased 
from that day to the present and has 
done some glorious work. On one fast 
day, early in the spring, some sixteen 
baptisms took place, and most of the 
subjects were children taught in that 
Sunday School, but whose parents were 
not of our faith. This is but one in- 
stance of several which have occurred 
in Utah. 

Now, brethren, you who have been 
called to be watchmen upon the tow- 
ers of Zion, when you go home look 
into the nooks and corners of your 
stakes and see if there are not many 
children who need the bread of life. We 
do not desire to interfere with the 
duties of the bishops, but it is our 
duty to do all that we can toward get- 
ting every child in Zion to attend Sun- 
day School. 

Our average attendance is altogether 
too low. Some Sunday Schools report 
an average attendance of as low as fif- 
ty and fifty-five per cent. I speak ad- 
visedly when I say that there are some 
places within the organized stakes of 
Zion where there have been no meet- 
ings of any kind held for two years. 
These are places, too, in near-by local- 
ities, and there are many children there 
who are anxious to be baptized. What 
is needed is some attention to the mat- 



94 



DESERET SUNDAY SCHOOL UNION. 



ter by the brethren whose duty it is to 
look after the sheep of Christ's fold. It 
is my mission and yours to work while 
it is yet day. Think of it for one mo- 
ment! Consider the numbers of our 
youth throughout the Church who 
should be in the Sunday Schools, and 
who are not. We plod along from one 
week to another and allow these souls 
to decay. "We are willing to preach the 
Gospel to the nations of the earth, and 
this is right. It should be so. We all 
understand the God-given feeling we 
experience when we take the candidate 
into the waters of baptism.' But I want 
to say that it is just as important to 
save souls in Zion as in the ten thous- 
ands of cities in foreign climes. Re- 
member the cottage Sunday Schools, 
establish them wherever needed, and 
seek to care for the lambs God has 
given to your care. Remember the sug- 
gestions given by the Savior to Peter, 
"Feed my lambs." 

That we may have power to work 
righteously for the Sunday School cause 
as we should do, I ask in the name of 
Jesus. Amen. 



ELDER HENRY PETERSON. 

My brethren and sisters: While I 
stand before you I trust I may be guid- 
ed by the same Spirit as were those w^o 
have spoken before me. President 
Smith in his remarks spoke of o le great 
qualification that every teacher should 
possess, namely, the spirit of love for 
the pupils. A teacher who has that one 
great qualification will probably acquire 
all others necessary to the successful 
doing of his work. Love inspires him 
with a desire to benefit those placed 
under his watchcare. He studies their 
needs and prepares himself to supply 
his class with the necessary spiritual 
food. 

A teacher filled with love for his 
students learns to love the Gospel as the 
means by which he can lead them into 
the right kind of spiritual life and draw 
them nearer to the Master. He enjoys 
searching the Scriptures and leads oth- 
ers into that same enjoyment. He car- 
ries a life into the class that is felt by 



all present and leads them to regularity 
of attendance. 

A teacher who loves his pupils will 
seek unto the Lord for assistance that 
he may be helpful to them. He will thus 
acquire the Spirit of the Lord, whose 
mission it is to bring to remembrance 
things past and to show things to come; 
and which gives the power of discern- 
ment that he may see the needs of 
others and be instrumental in supplying 
them. 

If the hearts of all who are called to 
teach were filled with love, it would 
not be necessary for others to plan for 
them. That feeling would prompt them 
to make the necessary outside prepara- 
tion, and the Spirit of God would use 
them as instruments and guide them 
into natural and wholesome methods of 
work. Instead of cramming the minds 
of pupils mechanically with disconnect- 
ed religious and historical facts, they 
would give them the daily bread of 
spiritual life. 

As the qualification mentioned does 
not universally inspire teachers and 
spur all on to the right kind of effort, 
the plans of which have been spoken 
have been prepared. Their chief value 
will be that they aid the teacher to 
make the proper outside preparation. 
A commendable feature of the plans 
being prepared is that they do not do 
the work for the teacher. The lessons 
are not prepared for the teacher, nor 
can he prepare them from the plans; 
but if he is willing to put forth effort 
the plans will guide him in making the 
right kind of preparation directly from 
the Scriptures. 

The plans will help him to make this 
preparation easily and to find the most 
inspiring parts of the scripture. 

.It is to be hoped that the plans will 
be properly received and used, and that 
they will help teachers to get inspira- 
tion from the scriptures and a love for 
their work and for the children whom 
they teach. May God grant the aid of 
His Spirit and fill the teachers will love 
for their pupils, that they may be suc- 
cessful in winning souls to Christ. 
Amen. 

"The Pilgrim's Song of Hope" was 
then rendered upon tbje great organ by 
Prof. John J. McClellan.

ELDER HORACE CUMMINGS. 

To say that I am surprised to be 
called upon to address this congrega- 
tion would be a mild representation of 
my feelings; but I trust with the Spirit 
of the Lord I may be able to say some- 
thing of interest to you and to me in 
connection with the subject of children. 

One phase of the remarks of Presi - 
ident Smith struck me with force. He 
stated that the characters of our chil- 
dren are about as we make them. 

Eut we do not apply this fact as we 
should do. If we wish to become me- 
chanics we find it necessary to be ap- 
prenticed to learn the trade. If we are 
to practice medicine, we must study 
the human body and how it responds to 
treatment. But we get married and be- 
gin to rear families without giving any. 
or but little, consideration to the nature 
of the children we bring into the world. 
We often rebuke them in the most 
bungling and hurtful manner. The 
time has come when more attention 
must be given to the training of the 
young. 

A little incident which occurred in 
my neighborhood recently will show 
how thoughtless we sometimes are in 
correcting our children. A good mother 
who had been toiling hard all day found 
herself somewhat behind in her work 
of getting supper in the evening. She 
was tired, nervous, and worried lest it 
should not be ready by the time her 
husband returned from work. Her little 
daughter, six years of age, was helping 
her by tending the baby as best she 
could, but the baby was fretful and 
would cry in spite of the best atten- 
tions the little sister could give. "May- 
be baby is hungry," said the little girl, 
"I'll get him some milk." So saying, 
she laid him in the crib and hurried in- 
to the pantry and got him a glass of 
milk. In her hurry and anxiety— for the 
baby was crying — she stubbed her toe 
and fell, spilling the milk on the car- 
pet. The mother, without inquiring in- 
to the motives of the child, flew into a 
passion, rushed up and gave the little 
girl a smart blow on the head and 
called her a naughty girl for making 
such a grease spot on the carpet. The 
little girl, who had been doing her besc 



to help her mother, shrank into a cor- 
ner broken-hearted at the treatment 
she had received. 

What a grave mistake this mother 
made! How little consideration she 
gave to the motives of the child, or the 
real effects of the punishment! Could 
that child continue long to love and re- 
respect that mother under such unwise 
treatment? Punishment may be neces- 
sary at times, but we should be care- 
ful and know that we are right in giv- 
ing it. 

The same error often occurs in giv- 
ing instructions. Sometimes we are 
clear upon a certain point ourselves, 
but cannot get out thoughts down to 
the capacity or condition, of the chil- 
dren. For instance, on a recent trip I 
visited a certain class of pupils who 
were from six to eight years of age. The 
teacher was trying to explain the pas- 
sage from Isaiah which speaks of sev- 
en women taking hold of one man. 
What would little children know about 
such a subject? The subject as well 
as its treatment should be suited to the 
child. Other lessons from the Bible 
might have been given with profit, in- 
deed, the greatest good may be derived 
by the use of the beautiful, simple stor- 
ies which the Scriptures contain. 
Through them impressions may be 
made upon the young mind that will 
never be forgotten, and ever exert a 
good influence over their lives. But 
they must be chosen and presented 
wisely. 

Our children are the greatest bless- 
ing God can give us, and we should be- 
stow more attention and study upon 
child nature. Inquire into their mo- 
tives, and give our best thought to their 
training. 

The plans prepared are good ones for 
live teachers, but they are not good for 
lazy ones. Some people think it a sin to 
prepare a lesson beforehand. I re- 
member a story told by Brother Mae- 
ser. This beloved teacher once visited 
a theological class, the teacher of which 
went — as Brother Maeser expressed it — 
from "Dan to Beersheba" and "from 
Genesis to Revelation" in his address 
to the class, without making clear any 
point or principle. Brother Maeser, at 
the proper time and place, asked him 



DESERET SUNDAY SCHOOL, UNION. 



what preparations he had made for 
that recitation. The teacher in evident 
surprise answered, "I never make any. 
I don't propose to lariat the Spirit of 
God." "My dear brother," responded 
Brother Maeser, "let me assure you 
there was not a particle of the Spirit 
of God in all your teaching this morn- 
ing." 

Read one of the lessons on the sub- 
ject in the Doctrine and Covenants. The 
Prophet Joseph and Oliver Cowdery 
were both blessed with the gift to 
translate. Oliver lost it and the revela- 
tion tells us why. He thought all 
he had to do was to ask God 
and he would get the translation 
without further effort. Because he 
did not exercise his own mind, to 
think it out, his gift was taken away. 
So with the teacher. The plan is given 
you from the Union Board. Take each 
lesson, think it out, ask God's blessing 
upon it, and give it your best effort; 
■your gift will grow; you will succeed. 

ELDER JAMES E. TALMAGE. 
It is a great thing to be one of an 
organization of this kind, and be identi- 
fied with a cause represented by such 
numbers. I thought while looking over 
this immense congregation that we 
might search the world in vain for a 
similar gatherings on Sunday School or 
auxiliary matters. And this occasion is 
not a unique one amongst us; for twice 
every year thousands gather here in the 
interest of the Sunday School cause. 

You will learn doubtless from what 
has been said by the brethren that 
much improvement is evident in the 
Sunday School work. I rejoice in this 
improvement but still think there is 
room for greater advancement. You 
will also gather from what has been 
said that we cannot get to a condition 
when we are beyond doing better. If I 
thought I could get to a heaven where 
there was no advancement possible, I 
don't believe I should want to go there. 

When we feel that we have done the 
best possible we should. give God the 
glory and say "That and better will 
do." One characteristic of true perfec- 
tion is the capacity for improvement 
and progress. Development is a char- 
acteristic of everything that lives. 



Reference has been made to teachers 
who do not teach in the way to make 
the most lasting impression. Now, 
something depends upon the dress of 
the teacher; and a failure is often 
traced to the fact that a teacher is not 
dressed right. Much of the impression 
we make on those with whom we come 
in contact depends upon our dress and 
address. I do not refer to the manner- 
isms of society, nor to the cut of the 
coat, the style of the gown or to the 
flowers and feathers on the hat, but to 
the clothing of the spirit. The teach- 
ers should wear the garment of their 
calling in Sunday School or they will 
never make the impression necessary. 

When the garment of Elijah fell up- 
on his successor it was manifested that 
the spirit of his calling was transmit- 
ted. Without this spirit we cannot ac- 
complish anything. So, my brethren 
and sisters, strive for it, work for it 
and the spirit of your calling will en- 
gender the spirit of industry — God fear- 
ing industry, which will bring with it 
efficiency in the work to which you 
have been appointed. 

My heart bounded with joy in listen- 
ing to the voice of authority calling up- 
on the teachers to prepare by study and 
earnest effort for their work and not 
expect the Lord to do it all for us. That 
injunction would at one time have been 
considered heresy, at least by a few. 
The Spirit of the Lord comes to him 
who seeks for it. I find I can prepare 
a lesson at home in as prayerful a spir- 
it and with as much of the influence of 
the Lord, as if I stood here and at- 
tempted to talk to you on the subject. 

When we pray for all we undertake 
then will we have the Divine influence 
always with us. This is the way to 
fulfill the admonition, "Pray ye without 
ceasing." 

Some teachers are veritable proph- 
ets, bringing out things suitable for ev- 
ery occasion. The spirit of a calling en- 
ables one to overcome every obstacle. 

When I am called by authority to 
perform a certain mission if I have the 
spirit of my calling I feel that I am 
better able to do it than is any other 
man, because it is my calling, my 
authorized labor; and I can go forth, 
confidently, knowing that the Lord nev- 



DESERET SUNDAY SCHOOL UNION. 



it- 



er calls a man to perform any work 
without opening the way for him to do 
it. 

The following' question, handed in, 
has been given me to answer: 

"What should be done with a mem- 
ber of the superintendency or a teacher 
in a Sunday School who does not ob- 
serve the Word of Wisdom?" 

It is not my function to give a law 
on this matter, but I will say this: That 
a teacher who professes to be directed 
by the Spirit of the Lord, and who vio- 
lates the spirit of the Word of Wisdom, 
will not have that spirit in strength to 
enable him to realize what is intended. 
Such a teacher should be labored with 
and an effort made to bring him to the 
proper standard. I don't believe there 
are very many teachers who are not 
observing the Word of Wisdom. We 
are all trying to secure the same glory 
and we cannot continue to do an evil or 
the Spirit of God will cease to strive 
with Js, and that man who persists in 
breaking the law of God is bereft of his 
power as truly as was Sampson when 
his locks were shorn from his head. 

We must live by the law of God. 
Look around you and you can tell the 
men and women who are what they 
pretend to be; not those with lips ever 
guarded lest they show what is within, 
but those who show purity by every 
act. I testify from experience that 
when I obey the laws of righteousness 
the Lord comes to my help. And a 
teacher who is thus governed and who 
prepares a lecture or address upon the 
Scriptures puts forth the very spirit 
of the Scriptures. 

In teaching put away the disposition 
to present personal theories. We have 
no authority to interfere with individ- 
ual opinions; but neither you nor I 
have any right to teach a principle or 
doctrine as a tenet of the Church un- 
less it has been sanctioned by the 
Church or the authorities. We are not 
to let fads lead us away. I was de- 
lighted with a couple of articles on fads 
and hobbies recently printed in the Ju- 
venile Instructor over the signature of 
General Superintendent Joseph F. 
Smith. I could read in it the spirit of 
revelation. 

The Spirit of God will not tell you 
that a thing is true and tell someone 



else that it is false. If I speak tonight 
and you do not find an echo of the truth 
of it in your hearts it is because I am 
not truthful or you don't know the 
truth when you hear it. 

Reference has been made to the home. 
I recently paid a visit to one of the 
stakes of Zion and I asked the superin- 
tendent, a very earnest man and the 
very man for the place, what was the 
greatest difficulty he had to contend 
with. He answered that he had the 
most trouble on account of a lack of 
interest among parents. A teacher will 
be faithful Sunday after Sunday and 
then of a sudden she is absent from 
school, off to the lake or some other 
place of recreation or amusement. The 
mother says to the daughter: "You 
have been very punctual for a long 
time and there is no harm in taking a 
day off for a rest." Sundays are not 
given to us for that purpose, and that 
mother was not doing her duty. The 
Sunday School work is not so arduous 
that we have to take a day off to rest 
up. 

I rejoice in the good work of our 
teachers: I rejoice that the harvest is 
coming in forty and fifty fold. I hope 
it may soon be one hundred, yes two 
hundred fold, and on without limit or 
stop. God bless you. Amen. 

ELDER JOSEPH M. TANNER. 

I desire to call your attention to the 
fact that the outline plans will be pub- 
lished in pamphlet form; not all of the 
departments in one, because the teach- 
ers in the primary department may not 
want to use the theological plans and 
vice versa. The parts will be published 
for a very few cents. The plans are 
merely sketches and model lessons will 
be published from time to time in the 
Juvenile Instructor. The Juvenile In- 
structor, by the way, is the organ of 
the great Sunday School organization, 
and President Smith has taken a great 
interest in it and uses it as one of the 
channels to communicate his thoughts 
to the Saints throughout the Church. 

The congregation sang the "Doxol- 
ogy" and the conference adjourned 
with the benediction of Assistant Su- 
perintendent George Reynolds.

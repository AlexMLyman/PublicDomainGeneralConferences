hymn : 

Come, let us anew 

Our journey pursue, 
Roll round with the year, 

And never stand still 
Till the Master appear. 

His adorable will 

Let us gladly fulfill, 
And our talents improve, 

By the patience of hope 
And the labor of love. 

The opening prayer was offered 
by Bishop Charles W. Nibley. 
The choir sang the hymn : 

Hark ! listen to the trumpeters ! 

They sound for volunteers, 
On Zion's bright and flowery mount 

Behold the officers. 

President Smith announced that 
hundreds of persons, who desire to

participate in the services in this 
large Tabernacle, can not be accom- 
modated, for lack of room, and they 
are now waiting outside. For their 
benefit, services will be conducted 
in the adjoining Assembly Hall, 
under direction of Elder Anthony 
W. Ivins. 

PBESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 

OPENING ADDRESS. 

The Saints should manifest gratitude for 
the Lord's blessings. — Large expendi- 
ture by the Church for meeting 
houses, etc. — Futile efforts of the ene- 
mies of Truth.— Complete observance 
of the Word of Wisdom obligatory. 
— Suppression of saloons strongly ad- 
vocated. — Evil doers must not be fel- 
lowshiped. — Saints should be consist- 
ent examples of righteousness. 

My brethren and sisters, it is in- 
deed a cause for congratulation, joy 
and great satisfaction, to see the 
large number of members and of- 
ficers of the Church who have as- 
sembled here, at the opening of our 
seventy-ninth semi-annual confer- 
ence, notwithstanding the inclem- 
ency of the weather. It is remark- 
able, to say the least, to see so many 
here as are present this morning, 
and I feel grateful, in my heart, to 
the Lord for the feeling and inter- 
est manifested by those who are 
present, for your attendance here 
today is evidence of your interest 
in this work. I am glad to see you 
and to welcome you to this confer- 
ence of the Church, and I sincere^ 
ly hope and pray that the true spirit 
of the Gospel of the Son of God, 
may pervade all our meetings in 
this hall, and in other places where 
we shall be met together. I hope 
that, at the conclusion of our con- 
iferqnce, every soul possessing a 
knowledge of the Gospel, and a 



love of truth, will feel amply re- 
paid for attendance here; and tc 
this end I invoke the blessing of 
the Lord upon every individual who 
has come here today, and who will 
attend the conference for the love 
of the truth and for his or her 
devotion to the cause of Zion. The 
Lord has blessed us in a remarkable 
degree, throughout the past sea- 
son, with the exception of here and 
their a partial failure of late crops 
by frost ; generally the season has 
been fruitful, and the people have 
been blessed, so far as we have been 
informed, throughout the length 
and breadth of the land. We de- 
sire that the Latter-day Saints will 
always, and especially at this time, 
remember the Lord for His good- 
ness and mercy to them and for Hi.-' 
blessings upon their labors; for we 
do acknowledge the hand of the 
Lord — or should do — in every thing 
that we possess and enjoy in the 
world. It is written that the Lord 
is displeased with those who will 
not acknowledge His hand in ail 
things. All Latter-day Sainti 
acknowledge in their hearts that 
every good and perfect gift comes 
from God, "from the Father of 
lights, with whom is no variable- 
ness neither shadow of turning." 
We do not arrogate to ourselves 
the power to secure blessings, to 
mlultiply and increase our posses- 
sions and our wealth in the land 
without the assistance of Him from 
whom all blessings flow. We should 
keep in mind that law which makes 
it our duty to remember the Lord 
with the first fruits of all our in- 
crease, and that He is the giver of 
all good, not forgetting the duty we 
owe to Him and to His cause in the 
world, to provide our part of the 
means necessary for the carrying on 
of His work and for the building 
up of Zion in the latter days. Much

has been done during the past sea- 
son toward the building of houses 
of worship throughout the land — 
not only in this state but in Ari- 
zona, in Idaho, and throughout the 
missions of the Church. Much has 
been done by the Latter-day Saints, 
and much assistance has been ren- 
dered by the Trustee-in-Trust in 
the erection of houses of worship, 
schoolhouses, and in the purchase of 
places that were necessary to the 
welfare of the Saints. We are con- 
tinually doing, as far as it is pos- 
sible, what we may do consistently 
to assist God's work throughouv 
all the land. It will not be neces- 
sary nor perhaps consistent for me 
to enter into details in relation to 
the labor that is being performed in 
these directions. We have the re- 
cords of these things, and any of 
the Latter-day Saints who desire to 
be posted in relation to what is be- 
ing done for the building up of the 
Church can come to the head and 
obtain all the information that they 
need. Since our last conference, 
however, we have succeeded in ob- 
taining most excellent headquarters 
for the British mission, in the City 
of London. We rejoice exceed- 
ingly that, after the lapse of years, 
we have at last obtained a foothoic 
in that great metropolis where so 
many have been gathered into the 
covenant of the Gospel. We have 
also obtained headquarters, else- 
where, but I will not enter into an 
account of these things. 

The Lord has been prospering 
Zion, and we rejoice exceedingly in 
the many and glorious manifesta- 
tions of His kindness and mercy 
unto His people. We are grate- 
ful for deliverance from those who 
wilfully and wickedly and without 
a cause seek our hurt. We arc 
grateful in the belief, aye in the 
knowledge that notwithstanding 



the efforts they have made to in- 
jure this people and to thwart the 
purposes of the Almighty, they 
have but been the means, indirect- 
ly, of forwarding the work in the 
world. They have called attention 
of the world toward us, and that is 
just what we want, though they 
have done it with wicked intent. 
We want to be known as we are. 
We want to be seen in our true 
light. We want the world to be- 
come acquainted with us. We wain 
them to learn our doctrine, to un- 
derstand our faith, our purposes, 
and the organization of the Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints. We would like them to 
know something about the origin 
of this work, but we desire thai 
they shall see this work in the true 
spirit of it, and the only way this 
can be brought about is by the in- 
quiring, intelligent world coming 
in contact with us — those indeed 
who are disposed to love truth and 
righteousness and whose eyes are 
not so blinded that they can not 
see the truth when it is presented' 
before them. There are those who 
having eyes see not, and having 
hearts do not and will not under- 
stand. There are none so blind as 
those who will not see, and none so 
deaf as those who will not hear ; 
and there are none so heartless and 
so wicked as those who knowing 
the truth and seeing the light will 
close their eyes and their ean, 
against it. 

We are living in a momentous 
age. The Lord is hastening His 
work. He is at the helm, there is 
no mortal man at the helm of this 
work. It is true the Lord uses such 
instruments as will be obedient to 
His commandments and laws to as- 
sist in accomplishing His purposes 
in the earth. He has chosen thost 
who, at least, have shown a will-

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



ingness and a disposition to obey 
Him and keep His laws, and who 
seek to work righteousness and 
carry out the purposes of the Lord. 
It is for the Latter-day Saints to 
judge the standing of these men. 
They have no occasion to sound 
their own praise, to bear testimony 
of their own works; their lives 
are open books to all the Latter- 
day Saints and to all the world. 
You know these men; you under- 
stand them:; you have seen their la- 
bors ; you understand the desires 
of their hearts, for you are familiar 
with them. The Lord has sustained 
these brethren in the positions to 
which He has called them, and He 
will continue to sustain them in 
these positions so long as they con- 
tinue to be faithful before Him. It 
one of them should cease to be 
faithful and turn away from the 
right path, the consequences of hh 
own evil acts will fall upon him 
sooner or later, and the fruits of his 
works and the desires of his heart 
will be made manifest. 

When I arose to my feet, I had 
in mind the thought of presenting 
before this conference one of the 
revelations that has come to ua 
through the Prophet Joseph Smith, 
a revelation with which you are ail 
familiar, which has been the text, 
perhaps many a time, of every of- 
ficer in the Church. It is a revela- 
tion which has been sounded in the 
ears of all the people for the last 
seventy years, and yet it is a new 
theme, practically, for there is still 
great necessity for it to be held out 
to the Latter-day Saints and to all 
the world. We see great reasons 
for the principles contained in this 
chapter of the book of Doctrine 
and Covenants being taught to the 
world, and especially to the Latter- 
day Saints. It is nothing more nor 
less than that simple Word of Wis- 



dom that was given in 1833, for 
the benefit, the help, and the pros- 
perity of the Latter-day Saints, 
that they might purify and prepare 
themselves to go nearer into the 
presence of the Lord, that by rea- 
son of keeping this law they might 
fit themselves to enjoy the bless- 
ings that He is more than willing 
to bestow upon them, if they are 
worthy. I propose to read this 
revelation to you and, perhaps, 
make a few remarks upon it: 

Revelation given through Joseph, the 
Seer, at Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio, 
February 27th, 1833 : 

A Word of Wisdom, for the benefit of 
the Council of High Priests, assembled 
in Kirtland, and Church; and also the 
Saints in Zion. 

To be sent greeting — not by command- 
ment or constraint, but by revelation and 
the word of wisdom, showing forth the 
order and will of God in the temporal 
salvation of all Saints in the last days. 

Here we are informed that it wa> 
not given, at that time, by way of 
commandment or . restraint but by 
revelation, "a word of wisdom 
showing forth the order and will of 
God in the temporal salvation of 
all saints in the last days." Subse- 
quently, years afterwards, from this 
stand, it was proclaimed from the 
mouth of the Prophet and Presi- 
dent of the Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints, Brigham 
Young, that the time had now 
come when this word of wisdom — 
then given not by commandment or , 
constraint — was now a command- 
ment of the Lord to the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 
and the Lord required them to ob- 
serve this word of wisdom and 
counsel, which is the will of God 
unto the people for their temporal 
salvation. 

Given for a principle with promise, 
adapted to the capacity of the weak and

the weakest of all Saints, who are or can- 
be called Saints. 

Behold, verily, thus saith the Lord 
unto you, in consequence of evils and 
designs which do and will exist in the 
hearts of conspiring men in the last 
days, I have warned you, and forewarn 
you, by giving unto you this word of 
wisdom by revelation, 

That inasmuch as any man drinketh 
wine or strong drink among you, behold 
it is not good, neither meet in the sight 
of your Father, only in assembling your- 
selves together to offer up your sacra- 
ments before him. 

And, behold, this should be wine, yea, 
pure wine of the grape of the vine, of 
your own make. 

And, again, strong drinks are not for 
the belly, but for the washing of your 
bodies. 

And again, tobacco is not for the 
body, neither for the belly, and is not 
good for man, but is an herb for bruises 
and all sick cattle, to be used with judg- 
ment and skill. 

And again, hot drinks are not for the 
body or belly. 

And again, verily I say unto you, all 
wholesome herbs God hath ordained for 
the constitution, nature, and use of man. 

Every herb in the season thereof, and 
every fruit in the season thereof; all 
these to be used with prudence and 
thanksgiving. 

Yea, flesh also of beasts and of the 
fowls of the air, I, the Lord, have or- 
dained for the use of man with thanks- 
giving; nevertheless they are to be used 
sparingly ; 

And it is pleasing unto me that they 
should not be used only in times of win- 
ter, or of cold, or famine. 

All grain is ordained for the use of 
man and of beasts, to be the staff of life, 
not only for man but for the beasts of 
the field, and the fowls of heaven, and 
all wild animals that run or creep on 
the earth ; 

And these hath God made for the use 
of man only in times of famine and ex- 
cess of hunger. 

All grain is good for the food of* man, 
as also the fruit of the vine, that which 
yieldeth fruit, whther in the ground or 
above the ground. 

Nevertheless, wheat for man, and corn 
for the ox, and oats for the horse, and 
rye for the fowls and for swine, and for 
all beasts of the field, and barley for all 



useful animals, and for mild drinks, as 
also other grain. 

And all saints who remember to keep 
and do these sayings, walking in obedi- 
ence to the commandments, shall receive 
health in their navel, and marrow to 
their bones. 

And shall find wisdom and great 
treasures of knowledge, even hidden 
treasures ; 

And shall run and not be weary, and 
shall walk and not faint; 

And I, the Lord, give unto them a 
promise, that the destroying angel shall 
pass by them, as the children of Israel, 
and not slay them. Amen. 

Now, it may seem altogther un- 
necessary and out of place, pei- 
haps, to many, for me to occupy 
the time of this vast congregation 
in reading this revelation, inas- 
much as it is presumable that every 
man and woman present has access 
to this book and is more or 
less familiar with all its contents. 
I am sorry to say that I do not be- 
lieve there is another revelation 
contained in this book, or another 
commandment given of the Lord 
that is less observed or honored 
than this "Word of Wisdom," and 
that, too, by members and officers 
of the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints, male and fe- 
male. Go where you will, you see 
a lack of appreciation of the coun- 
sel given in this revelation to the 
Latter-day Saints, by some of them. 
Some of our best men disregard in 
part this law; many do not fully 
observe it; some of our leading 
women do not keep the command- 
ment of the Lord that is given here, 
and they excuse themselves in var- 
ious ways, and for various rea- 
sons, for not observing the law of 
God. I simply want to say to you. 
my brethren and sisters, that there 
is no other way — no other course 
that we can take in the world, in 
relation to our temporal welfare

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



and health, better than that which 
the Lord God has pointed out to 
us. Why can we not realize this? 
Why will we not come to a perfect 
understanding of it ? Why will we 
not deny ourselves that which our 
craven appetites desire? Why can 
we not observe more closely the 
will of the Lord as made known to 
us in this revelation? If we would 
observe this law or commandment 
of the Lord, — first given not as a 
commandment nor by constraint, 
but afterwards declared by the 
mouthpiece of the Lord to be in 
force as a commandment there- 
after to the Latter-day Saints — if, 
I say, the people would observe 
the principles of this revelation, 
there could not exist in their midst 
that most obnoxious institution 
known as a saloon; it can not ex- 
ist where only Latter-day Saints 
dwell. If this commandment were 
observed by the whole people, the 
vast amount of money that now 
goes out to the world for strong 
drink and these other things for- 
bidden in the word of wisdom, 
would be saved at home, and the 
health, prosperity and temporal sal- 
vation of the people would be cor- 
respondingly increased. No man 
can violate the laws of God with 
reference to health and temporal 
salvation, and enjoy those bless- 
ings in the same degree that ht 
could do and would do if he would 
obey the commands of God. Don't 
you believe that? Can not Latter- 
day Saints accept that truth in 
their hearts? Can there be any 
room for argument in relation to 
that proposition? I say to you, my 
brethren and sisters, that God 
knows better than we do what is 
and will be for our best good, and 
when the Lord speaks to us, as He 
has spoken to us in this revelation 
which I have read to you, we should 



give it attention. We should ac- 
cept it in our hearts; we should 
live closely to it; and then, we are 
promised, we should find wisdom 
and great treasures of knowledge 
even hidden treasures; we mighl 
run and not be weary, walk anu 
not faint, and when the destroyer 
should come he would pass by us, 
as he passed by the children of 
Israel anciently. If we fail to ob- 
serve this law of God, we are not 
entitled to these promises. Those 
individuals who do not live up to 
these principles, conveyed to them 
through this word of the Lord, wul 
fail in rightfully claiming the ful- 
fillment of the promise that is made 
to them that keep the law. The 
Lord has said, "If ye will do the 
things I require at your hands," it 
ye will do my will, "then am I 
bound; otherwise there is no pro- 
mise," for every promise is made 
on condition that we will observe 
the law upon which that promise 
may be justly and righteously ful- 
filled. We go into the outer set- 
tlements of the Latter-day Saints 
where there are a few non-believ- 
ers, a few apostates from th; 
Church, probably, and a few whe 
have never belonged to the Church 
at all, but the majority of the peo- 
ple are members of the Church ; 
and we see planted, here and there, 
in the midst of these communities, 
saloons and other places of ill re- 
pute, and they are sustained by 
somebody. In some instances, at 
ijeast, we know that the outside 
element, the non-Mormon element 
is not sufficiently large or wealthy, 
nor are they so numerous in their 
patronage of these institutions as 
to keep them alive or to sustain 
them. The conclusion, therefore, 
is that there are some who are 
members of the Church who arc 
also frequenters of these places. 



PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH.

This is all wrong — all wrong. No 
member of the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints can 
afford to do himself the dishonor 
or to bring upon himself the dis- 
grace, of crossing the threshhold of 
a liquor saloon or a gambling heii, 
or of any house of ill-fame of 
whatever name or nature it may be. 
No Latter-day Saint, no member 
of the Church can afford it, for it 
is humiliating to him, it is dis- 
graceful in him to do it, and Goci 
will judge him according to his 
works. The man or woman who 
truly believes in the doctrines of 
the Church or professing to have 
membership in the Church, who be- 
lieves and practices the principles 
contained in this "Word of Wis- 
dom," will never be numbered 
among those who will bring this 
disgrace upon them, upon their 
neighbors or upon the Church to 
which they belong; they will never 
do it. 

Now there is a great movement 
on foot throughout the land; its 
waves have struck us here and arc 
flowing over our state — a wave of 
temperance. Even t'he wprld is 
moved upon by an irresistible in- 
fluence and spirit to advocate and to 
establish among communities in 
states and counties and cities the 
principle of temperance. I am in 
favor of this movement, I endorse 
it with all my heart; I know that 
it is in the right direction, and I be- 
lieve that the Lord Almighty is 
moving in that direction upon those 
who are willing to devote their la- 
bor and time to this portion of His 
good work in the world. The Lord 
does not delight in intemperance, 
in drunkenness, nor can He have 
pleasure in the poverty, in the de- 
gradation and ruin that such prac- 
tices bring upon their votaries and 
upon those who are dependent up- 



on them, the ruin of manhood, the 
ruin of family organizations and 
the degradation of those that are 
engaged in it and that bring pover- 
ty, destruction, and death upon 
themselves and upon their families. 
Every member of the Church, male 
and female, ought to set his or her 
face as flint against intemperance 
and against anything that is in 
violation of the laws of God, that 
they might never be overcome or 
yield to the temptation of evil. We 
ought to have purer communities, 
communities that are not ridden by 
vice, by pernicious habits and prac- 
tices. One cannot walk up and 
down the side-walks of our streets, 
but he will meet young men and 
boys with tobacco pipes in their 
mouths, or cigars or cigarettes, 
smoking in the streets. Perhaps 
those who are accustomed to these 
habits think this is a very trivial or 
very unimportant thing to talk 
about to a vast congregation like 
this, but I never see a boy or a 
man, young or old, addicted to this 
habit and practicing it openly but ' 
am forced to the conclusion to the 
conviction in my mind that he is 
either ignorant of God's will con- 
cerning man or he is defiant of 
God's will and does not care any- 
thing about the word of the Lord, 
and that alone is sufficient to bring 
sorrow to the heart of any man 
who has any regard or respect for 
the word or will of the Lord and 
would like to see it obeyed. We go 
occasionally to the theaters, and ot 
late years we see it has become very 
fashionable,or very common, for the 
actors to puff away at their cigars, 
pipes and cigarettes on the stage; 
and they light cigarette after cigar- 
ette, and cigar after cigar, right on 
the stage before their audience. 
To me such a practice is an insult 
to the Latter-day Saints at least, 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



and should be to all decent people ; 
and if I had little boys growing 
up who would be susceptible to the 
influence of such practices I should 
not want them to go to our thea- 
ters at all, where they would sec 
things in open practice as if it was 
something commendable. I think it 
is reprehensible, to say the least; 
and if I were managing a theater, 
and could do it, I would have it 
stipulated that there should be na 
smoking on the stage nor in the au- 
ditorium. Aside from the folly of 
smoking in a theater, lighted 
matches, cigars, and cigarettes are 
dangerous to property. There are 
other things however, in theatric*,, 
performances that are about as dis- 
graceful as smoking on the stage. 

Now, my brethren and sisters, 
the subject that I had in view in 
reading these words is simply to 
emphasize, as far as it lies in my 
power, the Word of Wisdom, giv- 
en to the Latter-day Saints to ail 
that are or can be called saints to 
the weakest of the weak, for it 
is adapted to them, and the weaker 
they are, if they will observe this 
principle, they will become strong- 
er by the observance of it. If we 
will observe this law, we will gain 
strength, we will have health in 
our bodies and marrow in our 
bones ; we may run and not weary : 
walk and not faint ; and this is most 
desirable for those that are feeble, 
or weak, who need strength, and 
health; they should observe this 
principle in order that they might 
obtain the very thing they desire 
and need most and that they arc 
destroying most by not following 
the word of the Lord but by prac- 
ticing those things that are for- 
bidden of Him. We pray God to 
heal us when we are sick, and then 
we turn round from our prayers 
and partake of the very things that 



He has told us are not good for 
us ! How inconsistent it is for men 
to ask God to bless them, when 
they themselves are taking a course 
to injure and to bring evil upon 
themselves. No wonder we don't 
get our prayers answered more 
than we do, and no wonder our 
health is no better than it is, when 
we are addicted to practices that 
God has said are not good for us, 
and thereby entail evils upon otu 
life and physical being ; and then to 
turn to the Lord and ask Him tc 
heal us from the consequence of 
our own folly, and pernicious prac- 
tices; from the effects of the evil 
that we have brought upon our- 
selves and that we knew better 
than to do. How foolish it is ! 

The Lord bless you my brethren 
and sisters. We endorse any move- 
ment looking to temperance, look- 
ing to virtue tending to purity of 
life and to faith in God and obed- 
ience to His laws ; and we are 
against evil of every description ; 
and we are, in our faith and pray- 
ers against evil doers — not that we 
would pray for evil to come upon 
evil doers, but that evil doers 
might see the folly of their way3 
and the wickedness of their acts 
and repent of them and turn away 
from them. If they will not hearken 
and repent of their evil ways, then 
let them pursue their course of evii 
to the end, and let the judgment 
of God come upon them and they 
receive their reward according to 
their works Let God judge ail 
men. He will reward them fot 
good or for evil according to their 
works. We are not here to execute 
judgment or to impose punish- 
ments upon our fellow men except 
the punishment of withdrawing 
from those who are unworthy our 
fellowship in the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints. We

find it necessary, sometimes, to 
withhold fellowship from those 
who have turned away from the 
truth from the love of God and the 
cause of Zion — that they might no<- 
be regarded as having membership 
and standing with us. It is an in- 
jury to the cause of Zion for any 
fcommunity organization, ward, 
stake or branch of the Church to 
permit men or women to retain 
their membership in that ward or 
stake or branch, when it is known 
that their practices and habits are 
vicious and that their manner of 
life and unbelief are calculated to 
sow the seeds of apostasy corrup- 
tion and evil in the midst of the 
people where they dwell. It is 
right and proper that the line of 
separation should be drawn dis- 
tinctly between them and the Lat- 
ter-day Saints. Withdraw fellow- 
ship from them cut them- loose, let 
them go to the world, and let 
the people of the Church under- 
stand that they are not held in fel- 
lowship and that their conduct is 
not countenanced by the authorities 
of the Church. 

Now, the Lord bless you, and in 
the name of the Lord I bless you — 
this congregation, the covenant 
people of the Lord, just as truly as 
ancient Israel were the covenant 
people of God, for you have enter- 
ed into the solemn covenant of 
the Gospel of Jesus Christ, that you 
will keep the commandments of 
God, that you will eschew evil and 
wickedness. You know what you 
have done ; you know the nature ot 
the covenants you have entered in- 
to before God and witnesses and 
before the angels of heaven; and, 
therefore, you have entered into 
the bond of the new and everlast- 
ing covenant and are indeed the 
covenant people of God in the lat- 
ter days. Therefore, what man- 



ner of people ought we to be ; whal 
manner of individuals should we 
be? Should we not set an example 
worthy of our profession? Should 
we not live pure lives? Should we 
not be upright, virtuous, honest, 
God-fearing and God-loving in oui 
souls every day of our lives and in 
every position in which we ma> 
be called to act; ought we not to 
set an example for good? Ought 
we not to be Christ-like, manly 
true to every principle of the 
Gospel, and honorable out in th; 
world and at home so that no man 
can justly point at us the finger of 
scorn or of condemnation? Thai 
is indeed the kind of people we 
ought to be. God help us to be 
such is my prayer, in the "name of 
Jesus. Amen. 

The choir sang the anthem, 
"Rouse, oh ye mortals." 

PRESIDENT JOHN R. WINDER. 

Conditions here fifty years ago and to- 
day contrasted. — Continued growth of 
the Lords' work. — In full accord with 
President Smith's purposes. — Determi- 
nation to continue devoted to the cause 
of truth. 

My brethren and sisters, I am de- 
lighted to have this opportunity of 
meeting with you once more in 
general conference. I have been 
listening, with much pleasure and 
satisfaction, to the remarks of our 
beloved President, and I propose, 
my brethren and sisters, to aid anc! 
assist him, to the extent of my abil- 
ity, in carrying into effect every 
proposition that has been mentioned 
here this morning. 

I am thankful that the Lord has 
spared my life to see one more gen- 
eral conference. This morning, 
when I awoke, my mind v^nt back 



10 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



to the general conference of fifty- 
years ago, and I was contrasting 
the many changes that have taken 
place, and the difference between 
our situation today and then. Jus I 
prior to that time the people had 
been in exile; they had moved 
away from their homes, and they 
were now returning. Within a 
few miles of this city a large army 
of the United States was stationed, 
as a menace to the people here in 
the valleys of the mountains. As 1 
compared conditions now and ther? 
I thought, what a change has come 
over us! At that time the founda- 
tion of our Temple was covered 
up; since then it has been uncov- 
ered and that beautiful edifice 
erected ; and thousands, yes, tens of 
thousands, of Latter-day Saints 
have been permitted to enter that 
building and receive blessed ordin 
ances for themselves and their 
dead. In addition to these changes 
that I have mentioned, I thought 
of how the work of the Lord has 
spread abroad in the world. At 
that time there were only a very 
few stakes of Zion, but they have 
been multiplied until now there are 
between fifty and sixty stakes of 
Zion. The foreign missions have 
also been multiplied in many nations 
of the earth. The Lord has pre- 
served and protected His people, 
notwithstanding $he fact that, at 
many times, they have been men- 
aced by opposition, all things have 
been overruled for the good and 
benefit of the work of the Lord, and 
for the advancement of His work 
upon the earth. I do not know of 
any time when my heart has felt 
to rejoice more than at the present, 
in the extent of the work of the 
Lord and the progress that it is 
making upon the face of the earth. 

It is my pleasure, my intention, 
and my determination to snstai:; 



our President with all my might, 
mind, and strength, to assist him 
to carry out his wishes, as he has 
expressed them here this morning, 
in every department, both temporal 
and spiritual. My life has been a 
busy one, it has been work, work, 
work from my childhood until the 
present time ; and I do not propose 
to discontinue, so long as the Lord 
shall permit me to live upon the 
earth. I intend, during the re- 
mainder of the time the Lord is 
willing to give me life, to uphold 
and sustain His work. Every day 
that I live I have renewed assur- 
ances that this is the work of the 
Lord, and that Joseph Smith is a 
Prophet of the Most High God. 
This testimony gives me joy, and 
strength, and satisfaction. 

Now, by brethren and sisters, you 
do not expect me to speak long, but 
I am thankful to have the privilege 
of bearing my testimony to you this 
morning in relation to this great 
work, and to express my determi- 
nation to stand by it so long as the 
Lord shall permit me to live upon 
the earth. God bless you all, is 
my prayer. Amen. 



PRESIDENT ANTHON H. LUND. 

Obedience to Word of Wisdom should 
be regarded as a requisite of Church 
fellowship. — Saints should be exam- 
ples of temperance and purity. — Care- 
ful guardianship of the young advised. 
— A law advocated enforcing Sunday 
observance. 

I have been much pleased to 
listen to the testimony of Brother 
Winder, and with him I feel to 
say that I will try to carry out the 
instructions given unto us by our 
President. I endorse his sayings 
with all my heart. I feel that it 
would be for the best good of the 



PRESIDENT ANTHON H. LUND. 



11 



Latter-day Saints to ■ study the 
revelation on the Word of Wis- 
dom, which he has read to us, and 
to determine to obey it. The Lord 
gave this revelation to our Church 
in the early days, and those who are 
called to lead the people have felt 
how important are the instructions 
given in that revelation. Our 
brethren who are traveling among 
the Saints, organizing wards and 
quorums of the priesthood, insist 
upon those who accept positions in 
the Church that they will obey the 
Word of Wisdom. Some of the 
people have thought that the breth- 
ren were too strict in making such 
a request, but at the very time when 
this revelation was given, in Kirt- 
land, the same instructions . were 
given. At a High Council meeting 
held in Kirtland, February 20th. 
1834, over which the Prophet pre 
sided, he rendered the following de- 
cision ; "No official member in this 
Church is worthy to hold an office, 
after having the Word of Wisdom 
properly taught him, and he, tho 
official member, neglecting to com- 
ply with, or obey it." This decision 
the Council confirmed by vote 
(History of the Church Vol. 2 

page 35)- 

In May, 1837, the Presidency 
of the Church at Far West called 
a general meeting of the Church. 
Among those present were the High 
Council, two of the Twelve, ten of 
the Seventies, the Bishop and one 
counselor. At this meeting it was 
resolved unanimously: "That we 
will not fellowship any ordained 
member who will not or does not 
observe the Word of Wisdom ac- 
cording to its literal reading/' 
(History of the Church, Vol. 2, 
page 482). 

We have listened this morning 
to our President laying it down as 



a law unto Israel. Shall we hold 
this word lightly, or shall we, wSth 
Brother Winder, say we are de- 
termined to carry out the instruc- 
tions given unto us? While he 
read and explained the Word of 
Wisdom, I thought of the words of 
Paul, written to a young mission- 
ary in Crete, and I will read them. 
He says to Titus : 

"But speak thou the things which be- 
come sound doctrine : 

"That the aged men be sober, grave, 
temperate, sound in faith, in charity, in 
patience." 

"The aged women likewise, that they 
be in behavior as becometh holiness, not 
false accusers, not given to much wine, 
teachers of good things : 

"That they may teach the young wom- 
en to be sober, to love their husbands, 
to love their children. 

"To be discreet, chaste, keepers at 
home, good, obedient to their own hus- 
bands, that the word of God be not 
blasphemed. 

"Young men likewise exhort to be 
sober minded. 

"In all things showing thyself a pat- 
tern of good works : in doctrine show- 
ing uncorruptness, gravity, sincerity, 

"Sound speech, that cannot be con- 
demned; that he that is of the contrary 
part may be ashamed, having no evil 
thing to say of you." 

These instructions, given by the 
Apostle formerly, are very appro- 
priate to us today. The President 
has spoken "things that become 
sound doctrine" to us this morning, 
and the advice here given to ail 
who labor in the priesthood is ^hat 
they shall speak sound doctrine. Do 
not hanker after mysteries. Ther? 
is enough in our standard works 
for texts upon which to speak un- 
to the people. The Church is guid- 
ed by revelation. Some have wond- 
ered why we do not receive revela- 
tion upon revelation, as they did m 
the early days of the Church. What 



/ 



12 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



blessing would it be to receive the 
word of the Lord in greater abund- 
ance than we do at present, if we 
do not obey His commandments 
unto us ? We have had this Word 
of Wisdom these many years ; have 
we improved in keeping it? I hope 
we have. I believe the Latter-day 
Saints are growing and increas- 
ing in good works, but a spirit of 
carelessness in regard to this Word 
of Wisdom has manifested itself in 
our midst. If it were not so would 
we see many saloons in settlements 
that are nearly all composed of Lat- 
ter-day Saints ? I suppose that the 
traveling public may help to sustain 
them, but I consider it a shame tc 
see such institutions in settlements 
largely composed of our people. 

I hope that this movement of 
temperance will continue until it 
shall be a success, and temperance 
be a vitrue possessed by all our 
people. Paul says we shall teach 
the old men to be temperate and to 
be sober, and the young men like- 
wise. You know how harmful are 
the effects of drunkenness and that 
it leads to a great many other 
crimes. When a person indulges in 
strong drink he partly loses his rea- 
son, and is easily tempted to vio- 
late the commandments of God and 
do things that lead downward, 
hence, when a man knows what the 
effects of strong drink are, he 
ought not to indulge in' it. Th: 
court may judge an act committed 
in drunkenness less severely, con- 
sidering that the man did not have 
full control of his faculties, yet 
when he wilfully goes and indulges 
in that which he knows makes him 
weak and exposes him to the dan- 
gers of violating the command- 
ments of God, he will be held 
guilty and responsible before the 
Lord. What a disgusting sight it 



is to see a man under the influence 
of liquor! I will not say a woman 
because it is so very seldom that 
such a sight is seen in these valleys, 
but I have seen such in other coun- 
tries, and it is a most hideous sight. 
A Latter-day Saint should never be 
known to indulge in strong drink. 
We are told by Paul that we should 
set an example before all worthy 
of imitation. That kind of sermon 
we can all preach; it is within our 
power to do thai Persons may be- 
come slaves to habit, and some have 
indulged so long in strong drinks, 
or perhaps have appetites which 
have come to them from their fa- 
thers, that it has become very hard 
for them to overcome this degrad- 
ing habit, but it can be done by the 
aid and assistance of the Spirit ot 
God. When persons are weak in 
such respects, the tempter will as- 
sail therm on their weak side, and 
they should therefore try to guard 
against these things. Young men 
should never go where intoxicating 
liquors are dispensed. The law 
forbids minors to enter saloons. I 
say unto you that the law of God 
forbids men to indulge in these 
things and to enter such places. 
Even men who do not want to par- 
take of the drinks dispensed in a 
saloon should not go there. It ir- 
not a place where anything good is 
taught; it is a place where lang- 
uage most filthy can be heard, and 
idle and vain talk which may cause 
our young men to lose sight of the 
greater objects of life and to take 
the downward road. It is said that 
the old Egyptians would get their 
slaves drunk in order that then 
sons could see what a disgusting 
spectacle men make of themselves 
when they are under the influence 
of drink. If a person has indulged 
to such an extent, especially if he

still is a man of faith, I know tha'. 
his conscience will upbraid him ani 
he will desire to leave off this hab 
it. To such a man I would say, 
do not stop with having the desire 
only, but make the resolve that you 
will not be conquered by nor yield 
to this habit. 

In speaking about the works of 
the flesh, Paul lays strong emphas- 
is also upon works of impurity, 
adultery, fornication, uncleanness 
and lasciviousness. He enumerates 
other vices and then adds drunken- 
ness, revelings ; and he declares that 
those who indulge in these things 
cannot inherit the kingdom of God. 
He puts it very strongly. 

Brethren and sisters, are we 
looking after our young people as 
we ought to do? I am pleased with 
the work of a number of Elders 
who have been appointed in the dif- 
ferent stakes to look after our 
young people at night; I believe 
that a great deal of betterment has 
taken place. In a large city like 
this there are many temptations, 
and the parents ought to be on their 
guard, and know where theii 
young people are when they are not 
at home. 

There is also much evil in hav- 
ing theaters open on Sunday even- 
ings. I hope that the legislators 
who shall be elected this fall will 
feel to pass a Sunday law. In a 
Christian community I think a Sun- 
day law ought to be passed and 
ought to be enforced. When I was 
a missionary in England, I was 
pleased to observe how well the 
Sunday was observed there. When 
walking the streets I was glad to 
see how quiet the cities were, and 
that the people, many of them, 
went to their churches. I wish that 
in all the towns of Zion there may 
be a marked improvement in keep- 



ing the Sunday holy. I do think 
that something should be done in 
this respect, because if people are 
permitted to keep theaters open on 
the Sunday, perhaps after a while 
they will have dances on the Sun- 
day evening. I believe that this 
can be stopped, and that a law to 
that effect can be passed. Why, 
it is said that sometimes young peo- 
ple, after they have been to Sunday 
meeting, go to be .entertained and 
amused at some of the theaters. I 
should think that when they have 
been to meeting and received 
spiritual food that that should suf- 
fice. To keep the Sunday holy is 
a commandment given us by the 
Lord, and we must observe it. See 
how strict He was in regard to 
this commandment in olden times. 
He has given it for our good. It 
is certainly best for man to have 
one day in seven to rest from his 
labor and to devote to the worship 
of God. Now, this commandment 
ought to be observed in all the 
wards and stakes of Zion. Pro- 
fanity should not be heard and 
everything that violates the com- 
mandments of God must be avoid- 
ed. We have taken upon us the 
name of Latter-day Saints. Let us 
show to the world that that means 
to be men of God, that we propose 
to keep His commandments and to 
spread that influence throughout 
the world. We call upon men to 
repent, to accept the Gospel of 
Christ, and to live such "lives that 
may bring unto them salvation 
hereafter. 

May God bless the Latter-day 
Saints ; may He -help us to over- 
come all our weaknesses and prove 
ourselves worthy to be His chil- 
dren in spirit and in truth, is my 
prayer, in the name of Jesus. 
Amen.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



President Smith made announce- 
ments, and recommended the sisters 
to leave small children in care of the 
efficient attendants at the Day 
Nursery, during meeting hours. 
Visitors who have been unable to 
find lodgings were advised to con- 
fer with the committee that has 
been specially appointed to look 
after their welfare. He stated that 
conference overflow meetings will 
be held this afternoon, in the As- 
sembly Hall and in Barratt Hall. 

The choir sang the anthem, 
"Praise the Lord, all ye nations." 

Benediction was pronounced by 
Bishop Orrin P. Miller. 

Conference was adjourned until 
2 p. m. 



Overflow Meeting. 

An overflow session of the Con- 
ference was held in the Assembly 
Hall at 10 a. m. Elder Anthony W. 
Ivins presided, and Prof. Charles 
J. Thomas conducted the singing. 

The Temple choir and congrega- 
tion sang the hymn, "Now let us re- 
joice in the day of salvation." 

Prayer was offered by Elder W. 
Derby Johnson. 

The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn, "Redeemer of Israel, our 
only delight." 

ELDER ANTHONY W. IVINS. 

Purpose of gathering to Zion. — Study of 
Scripture enjoined. 

I earnestly pray, my brethren 
and sisters, that the spirit of the 
Lord may attend our services 
here this morning, that the same 
influence may be here which we 
know will characterize the meet- 
ing in the tabernacle, where that 
large congregation of Latter- 



day Saints are met together. We 
are here to learn the will of the 
Lord, to be taught In His ways, 
that we may better learn to walk 
in His paths. Nearly all, and 
perhaps all of us who are here are 
converts to the truth, with faith 
in God and in the redemption 
wrought out by His Son Jesus 
Christ, having yielded obedience 
to the principles of the gospel, 
having repented of our sins and 
been baptized by immersion for 
the remission of them. We have 
gathered up here to Zion that we 
might better learn our duties, that 
we might better learn the will of 
the Lord, that we may be better 
able to serve Him and to keep 
His commandments, in order that 
His spirit may continue with us, 
and that we may be instructed, 
that we may review ourselves, 
that we may also review the con- 
dition of the Church, and thus be 
able to reach proper conclusions 
as to its development, to be bet- 
ter able to judge ourselves, that 
our faith in the Lord may be in- 
creased, that our determination to 
do His will may be greater. 
That we may have greater power 
over the weakness of the flesh, 
we meet together from Sabbath 
to Sabbath, and twice during the 
year the whole Church comes to- 
gether, that we may be taught, 
that, in fulfillment of the words 
of the Prophet, we who have gath- 
ered up here to the Mountain of 
the House of the Lord may learn 
His ways and be able to walk in 
His path. 

Now, my brethren and sisters, 
exercise your faith, pray to the 
Lord that His blessing, that His 
Spirit may attend the services that 
we are holding here this morning, 
and I promise you we shall go 



ELDER GERMAN E. ELLSWORTH. 



15 



out from this building blessed, 
we shall go out rejoicing in the 
Lord, and with greater faith in 
Him and greater determination to 
serve Him and keep His com- 
mandments, that we may magni- 
fy the calling to which we have 
all been called who are members 
of His Church. You know it is 
only him who has kept the faith, 
who has fought the good fight, 
who has finished his work, re- 
maining true to the covenants 
made with God the Eternal Fath- 
er, that shall attain eternal life. 

May the Lord bless you, my 
brethren and sisters. I bear wit- 
ness to you that we are engaged 
in the work of the Lord, that we 
are not in error, that this work 
is not delusion, but that it has 
come in the Dispensation of the 
Fullness of times for the redemp- 
tion of the world, that Israel may 
be gathered, that the words of the 
prophets may be fulfilled, that 
His covenant people may hear the 
truth and be gathered into the 
fold of Christ preparatory to His 
kingdom and coming. It is all 
in harmony. I do not desire to 
take time to enter into any dis- 
cussion with you, my brethren 
and sisters, to undertake to show 
you by the scripture or by any 
lengthy argument that what I 
have just said is true ; but I exhort 
you all to study, I exhort you all 
to understand better the word of 
the Lord, that you may know the 
harmony which exists. It is not 
enough that we become acquaint- 
ed somewhat with the cardinal 
principles of the gospel. It is not 
enough that we understand only 
the dispensation in which we live. 
But we must go back to the be- 
ginning we must understand the 
written word of the Lord as we 



have it in these sacred books, even 
from the beginning until the day 
in which we live. We must un- 
derstand the harmony that exists 
between all these gospel dispen- 
sations, and then we Will begin 
to understand how admirably our 
work fits in the time, and the 
place, and the manner in which 
the Lord has decreed that it 
should come about. The work 
that He has decreed, that He has 
accomplished is all in harmony 
with the words of the prophets 
which have been spoken since the 
beginning. 

Now may the Lord bless you, 
and bless our brethren who shall 
address us, with His Spirit, that 
the truth may be impressed upbn 
our hearts this morning, I ask in 
the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 



ELDER, GERMAN E. ELLSWORTH. 

(President of Northern States Mission.) 

My brethren and sisters, I cer- 
tainly appreciate the privilege that 
I have of attending conference, and 
partaking of the influence that is in 
these general assemblies. I feel re- 
newed in spiritual strength, and I 
go away from these meetings re- 
freshed, and with a determination 
in my heart to labor, if possible, 
more diligently for the spread of 
truth, and for the building up of 
the Lord's kingdom in the earth. 

I can say to you that in the 
Northern States, where it is my 
privilege to labor, there is a spirit 
among 'the people that is much more 
favorable toward the truth than has 
been manifest in the previous four 
or five years that I have been there ; 
and there is greater diligence 
among the elders. Many times 



16 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



have I heard the elders say when 
they were about to be released, 
"Well, I am just learning how to 
do missionary work, and I was just 
converted to' the work when I was 
released to return home." I pre- 
sume you have heard elders say that 
they were just getting' interested 
the last few months of their mis- 
sionary experience. It has been my 
pleasure this year to see the elders 
favorably change in feeling, many 
of them, the majority, in fact, have 
seemed to partake of the spirit of 
Nephi. When his father told him 
of his vision concerning the future 
of his people, he had a desire to 
know likewise, first-handed, con- 
cerning the subjects of that vision, 
and the Lord favored him with the 
same vision; he then became im- 
bued with zeal for the work of God, 
and followed in the footsteps of his 
father, not because of what his fath- 
er said but because of the knowl- 
edge received by himself, directly 
from the Lord. 

We take our missionaries when 
they first come into the field and say 
to them : "Brethren, we have a good 
many elders here, and you do not 
know the policies we have adopted 
in our conference ; you do not know 
anything concerning the plans we 
have laid out for the accomplish- 
ment of our work this year. We do 
not want you to wait weeks or 
months to be converted to it; take 
our word for it, for it has been 
agreed to by all the elders in con- 
ference assembled, to be the plan 
of our missionary work in the com- 
ing summer months," (or the fall, 
or winter months, as the case may 
be). "You young men must go to 
the Lord, get His Spirit, and give 
us your sympathy and best efforts 
from the beginning, and when we 
form different plans in future you 



will be a party to it." And it is 
marvelous to see the young men, 
within a few days, equal in the dis- 
tribution of books and tracts, and 
the holding of meetings, with those 
who have been months in the mis- 
sion field. In a few weeks they are 
in full sympathy with every move 
that is made, and we receive their 
support from the very first. 

Counting those who have been re- 
leased this year, we have had about 
two hundred elders in the mission 
field where I am privileged to labor, 
and the great majority were most 
true and loyal, their hearts beat in 
unison with the conference presi- 
dent, and the mission president. I 
believe there has never been a pe- 
riod during the eight years I have 
been there when so great an amount 
of missionary work has been ac- 
complished as in the past five or six 
months. 

Where last year our elders were 
successful in placing copies of the 
Book of Mormon, they are this year 
welcomed by the best men in the 
community, and are taken to their 
homes. The people are glad to re- 
ceive them, and pleased to learn 
more of the truth. They have been 
told: "We have not only read the 
Book of Mormon, but we have 
handed it to our neighbors ; and we 
are surprised that a book so full of 
truth and good teachings, and won- 
derful examples of faith in the Lord 
Jesus, has been printed so long and 
yet we have never read it, nor heard 
anything of it except the untruth 
that it was a book peculiar to you 
people, and not for general distribu- 
tion." 

I am very proud to labor with so 
many true and loyal men. I be- 
lieve that out of the 200 we have 
had this year, there has not been 
one but who has been true to the

faith and true to his birthright, as 
true as Nephi of old was to his. 
They have struggled hard to main- 
tain unsullied their Rocky Moun- 
tain honor, and the faith which 
brought their fathers out to these 
mountain valleys. In our district 
we have wonderful testimonies of 
the splendid spirit of our parents, 
for we meet in every state the sons 
of men and women who had not 
courage enough to join in the mi- 
gration of the Saints, but who re- 
mained behind. Observing their 
lives, their homes and surround- 
ings, their present spirit and stage 
of development, we find occasion to 
rejoice that our parents had the 
strength of faith in God to follow 
the pioneers across the plains. This 
is an incentive to us to emulate the 
faith and integrity of our fathers, 
the pioneers. Though our labor is 
not like theirs, as pioneers, yet our 
elders have a desire in their hearts 
to emulate the fathers in perform- 
ing missionary labor among the 
people of the world, distributing the 
written word, and calling them to 
repent and be baptized. They cour- 
ageously emulate their fathers in all 
the great work they are called upon 
to perform. 

I rejoice in the truth, and in the 
missionary work that is being ac- 
complished. My heart burns in see- 
ing the faith and courage that is 
manifested by the young men who 
are laboring with us. Their char- 
acter is exemplified in this illustra- 
tion : I wrote to a young man about 
four weeks ago, reminding him that 
he had been laboring nearly thirty 
months, as long as we generally 
keep missionaries in the Northern 
States, and that he could now be re- 
leased to return home with a com- 
pany that was returning on the 28th 
of September. I told him I did not 



know his circumstances, but I knew 
that he had done a good work, and 
that he was entitled to an honor- 
able release, and I asked the Lord to 
bless him ; and in closing my letter I 
added this postscript: "Dear 
brother, I am impressed to invite 
you to stay another six months, if 
you feel like it." This was some- 
thing that had never been done be- 
fore in that mission field, that I 
know of. In about three days we 
received a letter back, in which he 
thanked us for our confidence in 
him, and said : "Brother Ellsworth, 
I am mostly impressed with the 
postscript to your letter, and I feel 
that I would like to stay another 
six months. I feel also that my par- 
ents would like me to stay, there- 
fore, if you will accept my services, 
I desire to continue with you, for 
I never enjoyed any period of my 
life like I have the last two years, 
and especially this last summer. 
The people are yielding to our tes- 
timony, and are opening their hearts 
to the truth, and I would like to re- 
main longer, if you will accept my 
services." That is only one of 
many. 

The testimony of all our elders is 
that the people are opening their 
hearts to the truth, they are being 
softened in their feelings toward the 
religion of the Latter-day Saints, 
and thev are finding new truth and 
new beauty in the gospel that we 
proclaim to them, something they 
never dreamed of before. So, our 
elders are glad to remain, and have 
the hearts of the people turned un- 
to them'; and they are powerful in 
their testimony of the truth that the 
Lord has given them. As you all 
know it is hard to battle forever and 
have no encouragement, but when 
you see the day-dawn, when you 
find people yielding to the truth, 



18 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



when good men open their hearts 
and homes to you, you feel encour- 
aged in the work. So we feel to 
rejoice in the wonderful work the 
Lord is accomplishing in softening 
the hearts of the people; and we 
take delight in bearing witness that 
God has established His Church in 
this, the last time, and are encour- 
aged in the favor with which the 
people are receiving our literature. 

Five years ago our year's record 
in the distribution of literature was 
something like 5,000 books and 
109,000 tracts. In the nine months 
closing with September last, we 
have succeeded in distributing 62,- 
000 books and 469,000 tracts. Five 
years ago our record was 100 Books 
of Mormon, this year we have dis- 
posed of 12,000 in the Northern 
States, and apparently we have not 
given as much effort to the sale of 
Books of Mormon this year as we 
did last year, but it has been more 
. readily received. We have calls for 
it on every hand, both through the 
mails and by orders from our elders, 
and we greatly rejoice in this mar- 
velous increase. People tell us, "It 
is wonderful how long you have 
stood the misrepresentation, and the 
misinformation that has gone 
abroad in the world. We received 
a wrong impression of you and your 
message. You have labored long 
and faithfully, and we doubt wheth- 
er we could have borne what you 
have so patiently." 

May God bless the Latter-day 
Saints. May we emulate the men 
who have been true and faithful in 
the work of the Lord, and may we 
ever have such as examples before 
us. The men who have been true 
to the faith, true from the begin- 
ning, are the men whose sons and 
daughters today feel proud of their 
parentage. We feel proud today 



of our leaders in the church and 
kingdom of God ; while the names 
of the men who were weak in the 
faith in the beginning, who turned 
traitors, have been blotted out from 
our remembrance. I pray that God 
will give every one of us power to 
stand true to our brethren who are 
called to lead and direct this church 
and kingdom' in the earth. May the 
Spirit inspire each and every one of 
us to feel and know what God de- 
sires us to do, both temporally and 
spiritually, without being told, that 
we may receive in our hearts things 
that we do not hear spoken, and 
know how to walk and how to act in 
this church and kingdom. That we 
may preserve our rights and liber- 
ties, and that God may bring free- 
dom to Israel, both spiritual and 
temporal, is my prayer, in the name 
of Jesus Christ. Amen. 



ELDER ANDREW JENS0N. 

(Assistant Historian.) 

At the present time, my breth- 
ren and sisters, Zion in her gath- 
ered condition is represented by 
58 stakes, and in her scattered 
condition by 21 missions. Over 
each of these stakes, as we know, 
there are presidencies; and there 
are also presidents over each mis- 
sion as they are now established 
throughout the world. From 
these presiding officers we often 
hear reports, as we have here to- 
day. In looking broadly upon the 
work of the Latter-day Saints we 
realize that we have indeed a 
great labor to perform on the 
earth. Our special mission is to 
preach the gospel in all the world, 
for which purpose missionaries 
have been sent out from the very 



ELDER ANDREW JENSON.

beginning. In some countries 
. these missionaries have been more 
successful than in others ; and 
particularly among the English- 
speaking people have the Elders 
been blessed in making a great- 
number of converts. These con- 
verts, when baptized in foreign 
lands, or in different parts of our 
country, are usually organized in- 
to branches and into conferences 
of the Church, and these are 
grouped into missions. Most of 
the missions in the different lands 
where our Elders have preached 
have been somewhat permanent, 
but the conferences, and partic- 
ularly the branches in these mis- 
sions, have not always been con- 
tinuous, because the members 
who constitute them usually emi- 
grate to Zion, after the lapse of 
a short time, sometimes only 
months, sometimes years. 

The principle of gathering is be- 
ing taught by the Elders of the 
Church ; and if it has not been 
taught much in public at times, 
the Spirit of God, nevertheless, 
whispers to the members that the 
dispensation of the fulness of 
times is a gathering dispensation, 
and that it is proper and profitable 
for the Saints to gather to Zion, 
as Brother Ivins remarked, to learn 
more of the ways of the Lord and 
to walk more perfectly in His 
paths. For that reason we have 
been gathering the Saints togeth- 
er almost from the beginning, the 
Lord making-known to us that he 
would call upon the elect from the 
four quarters of the earth to as- 
semble together and be organized 
into Zion, or stakes of Zion. Thus 
the Lord, in an early day, reveal- 
ed the location of the main city in 
Jackson county, Missouri, and 
from that time until the present 



we have understood that we 
should, as a part of our labors for 
the redemption of mankind, build 
up stakes of Zion throughout the 
land until both North and South 
America are filled with such 
stakes. In fact, the Prophet Jo- 
seph, in the last conference he at- 
tended before his martyrdom in 
Carthage, Illinois, declared that 
all of North and South America 
was the land of Zion itself. 

We have been quite successful 
in our missionary labors abroad, 
and we have also been quite suc- 
cessful in our home enterprises. 
For a number of years after trie 
organization of the Church, say 
17 or 18 years, we labored under 
great difficulties and trying cir- 
cumstances, in our endeavors to 
build cities, towns and villages in 
the East, as persecution arose 
against us because of our pecu- 
liar faith, and our neighbors 
would not let us alone. They 
robbed and plundered us,, drove 
us from place to place, killed a 
number of our people, and made 
it very unpleasant indeed for the 
survivors. At last we found our- 
selves driven beyond the borders 
of civilization into these valleys 
of the mountains — an event that 
took place in fulfillment of predic- 
tions made by the Prophet Joseph 
Smith during his life time. Had 
his life been spared, he would un- 
doubtly have led us here himself ; 
but as he was taken away while 
yet a young man, President Brig- 
ham Young became the chosen in- 
strument in the hands of God to 
lead Israel to these valleys of the 
mountains. And I will venture 
to say here, my brethren and sis- 
ters, that since we settled here in 
these valleys, we have had the 
best opportunity that we ever had, 



20 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



as a people, or as an organized 
community, to demonstrate, to an 
unbelieving world, what the fruits 
of "Mormonism" are, or might 
be, or can be, when the people 
who believe in the restored gos- 
pel are let alone. Our enemies 
gave us a bad name in Missouri 
and Illinois ; they claimed that we 
were dishonest ; they claimed that 
we had blacklegs among us, who 
were doing all kinds of mischief; 
there were, they would have it, 
even counterfeiters in our midst, 
as well as horse thieves and other 
criminals, and on this ground they 
sought a pretense to drive us all 
away from them. But it was prov- 
en most beautifully and conclusive- 
ly, after they had driven us out in 
the wilderness, and after we had 
got a foothold here in these moun- 
tains, that we were not composed 
of such elements as our enemies 
accused us of. If we had been 
that kind of a people we most 
surely would have built up a sort 
of a Robbers' Roost in these 
mountain fastnesses, as there 
was nothing here to prevent us 
from so doing. We had no laws 
at that time except those that 
we brought with us, which were 
practically the very laws that 
guided our actions in Nauvoo, 
when they accused us of so many 
crimes; and in addition to these 
we had, for many years, no other 
laws here except such as we pas- 
sed ourselves. This was abso- 
lutely the case for a number of 
years after our arrival in these 
mountains, say from the year 1847 
until we became the territory of 
Utah. That territory was, as you 
all know, created in the latter 
part of 1850, but the federal offi- 
cers who were appointed to take 
hold of the local government here 



were not properly installed until 
the beginning of the next year, . 
1851. 

During the past few months I 
have had a better opportunity, 
than ever before in my life, to 
look into the pile of letters and 
documents that accumulated in 
the hands of the historians and 
the Saints generally during those 
early years when the Saints first 
settled in the Great Salt Lake 
Valley. Many letters passed be- 
tween the people of this valley 
and the people of other lands and 
climes, where we had missionaries 
and friends ; some of these letters 
were published at the time and 
are known to those who are fam- 
iliar with the early files of the 
"Deseret News" and "Millennial 
Star." But a great many import- 
ant and characteristic communi- 
cations have never been published 
and have never been known to 
the public generally. Besides the 
communications written by our 
own people here, many letters 
were written by strangers who 
passed through or who sojourned 
temporarily "within our gates." 
For instance, in 1849, when the 
great influx to the California 
mines took place, and thousands 
of people passed through our chief 
city on their way from the Mis- 
souri river to the gold diggings of 
California, there were many liber- 
al and fair-minded men among 
them — men who were not afraid 
to tell the truth about the "Mor- 
mons" in the Rocky Mountains. 
Many of these overland travelers 
had friends in the East to whom 
they would report by letters or 
otherwise what they had seen and 
experienced in these mountains as 
they journeyed through. Some of 
these were, prior to their arrival,

so afraid of Salt Lake valley that 
they did not know whether they 
dared pass through or not, be- 
cause they imagined, judging from 
what they had heard, that the 
"Mormons" would steal their cat- 
tle and wagons, and thus make 
it impossible for them to rea-.h 
Cahfornia, the goal of their ambi- 
tion. But a number of these same 
writers were, according to their 
own statement, almost dumbfound- 
ed and utterly astonished, when, in- 
stead of outlaws, they found a God- 
fearing people in the Great Salt 
Lake Valley — a good people, a peo- 
ple who were, as they wrote to their 
friends, "friendly to us, and instead 
of stealing from us what we had, 
they were kind, honest and accom- 
modating to us ; for they exchanged 
commodities with us and gave us 
things which we wanted for what 
we had and could spare; and thus 
they made it easier for us to reach 
California than it would otherwise 
have been. In fact, in many cases, 
it would have been impossible for 
us to reach California that year, 
had it not been for the assistance 
rendered us by the 'Mormons.' " 
And, speaking of our morals, these 
travelers said they had never 
known a more moral, chaste and 
temperate people than those they 
found in Salt Lake Valley. They 
describe these early pioneers of 
Utah as God-fearing, honest, and 
possessing all the virtues that could 
be expected in a Christian commu- 
nity; and even went so far as to 
say that they excelled the Christians 
in the eastern states in virtue, not 
to speak of the western states, 
-where the people at that time were 
not supposed to be as good as they 
were in the east. Such were the 
reports of these strangers who 
passed through the settlements of 



the Saints in 1849. I call your at- 
tention to these things to show you 
the fruits of "Mormonism," for 
Christ said in His great sermon up- 
on the mount, "By their fruits ye 
shall know them. Men do not gath- 
er grapes from thorns or figs from 
thistles." 

I am proud, as one of your his- 
torians, to refer to these facts, and 
to know that at the time our people 
could have been very wicked, they 
chose to be good; at the time they 
could have been robbers and out- 
laws and morally corrupt, they 
chose to be an honest people; at 
the time they could, without fear 
of punishment, have stolen from 
their neighbors who passed through 
their midst, they helped these in 
every way possible. This is a mat- 
ter of record; and our nation and 
the world will- some day acknowl- 
edge that these conditions were the 
natural fruits of "Mormonism," 
because the "Mormons" had a much 
better opportunity then than thev 
ever had before, or have Had since, 
to exhibit what the fruits of their 
religion or their own natural inclin- 
ations were. So on this ground 
there is no reason why we should 
be persecuted or be rejected as 
God's people. 

Coming down to the present day 
we find that conditions have some- 
what changed with us. After the 
Lord had blessed this land, in which 
we dwell, others — not of our faith 
— came to dwell with us, the same 
as strangers did in the land of Pal- 
estine in days of old. When the 
Lord made that land in the orient 
a good country, strangers came to 
sojourn and dwell with Israel, and, 
in some instances, these ied away 
the hearts of the chosen seed from 
the path of duty and caused them to 
bow the knee to Baal, or worship 



22 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



strange gods. This called down the 
displeasure of the God of Israel and 
His people were made to suffer ac- 
cordingly. Now, we are of Israel, 
just as much as the inhabitants of 
Palestine were in those days, only 
we live in a different dispensation 
and in a different country. We are 
visited continually by men and 
women who realize that our cli- 
mate is good, that our mountain air 
is balmy and pleasant, and who like 
to live in the shades of these great 
Wasatch mountains and partake of 
the blessings that we already enjoy 
here. The consequence is that we 
today are a mixed community, and 
some of the evils that exist in this 
city now, and in other cities of 
Utah, are positively not the fruits 
of "Mormonism." On the part of 
the Saints they are, rather, the 
fruits of their contact and associa- 
tion with the outside world. When 
the Children of Israel, in the days 
of Elijah the Prophet, bowed the 
knee to Baal to such an extent that 
there were only a few thousand 
who had not worshiped idols, this 
condition did not exist because of 
the teachings of the Prophets of 
God. On the contrary, it was the 
consequence of their rejection of 
these holy men and their coming 
into contact with the people sur- 
rounding them. So it is also with 
us. Our wrong doings as a people 
and individuals today are not the 
fruits of "Mormonism," but we are 
doing wrong, in many instances, 
because we bow to those things 
which have been introduced into 
our midst by those who are not of 
us, and because of the influences 
that have been brought to bear up- 
on us ; and that has caused sorrow 
and much grief to come upon many 
of our people. 

When we think of our success in 



the mission field, and hear such 
splendid reports as we have heard 
today, we grieve sometimes in con- 
templating that our converts, who 
are making their way to these val- 
leys for the purpose of becoming 
identified with a ward and a stake 
of Zion, will naturally come in con- 
tact with the influences of wicked 
people in our own midst; for, in 
some cases, the Saints have, in the 
past, been drawn away to worship 
the "gods of the strangers," and to 
do things that are not acceptable in 
the sight of our heavenly Father. 

Let us try to remember,my breth- 
ren and sisters, that we are God's 
people, and that we live in a land 
that God has given us, and that we 
should continue to make this land a 
land of Zion — a pleasant abode for 
the pure in heart; and if our fath- 
ers and mothers did so well in the 
earlier days of the Church, even in 
troublous times, we should endeav- 
or to the fullest extent of our pow- 
ers and abilities to do as well as 
they did, notwithstanding the fact 
that we now have neighbors all 
around us who do not serve God, 
and who do not desire to keep His 
commandments. Remember that 
the redemption of Zion is yet in the 
future and that a great prepara- 
tory work for the second advent of 
Christ is expected of us. When we 
speak of the redemption of Zion in 
the sense that I now allude to it, we 
mean that the time will come when 
some of the Saints will go back to 
Jackson county and build up the 
greatest and best city that we have 
ever been called upon to build, and 
also to build a Temple to the name 
of the great and true God — such a 
one as has never before been erect- 
ed by men; and it will require a 
people that have done well and have 
served God faithfully in the stakes

of Zion to do this work. Zion's 
chief city must be built by a people 
who are true to their God, and true 
to their brethren and their religion. 
It will most assuredly fall to the lot 
of such only to go and build up that 
center place, and erect that great- 
est Temple of all. 

Let us try, my brethren and sis- 
ters, as we live in these mountains, 
with Prophets and Apostles of Al- 
mighty God among us, to worship, 
in spirit and in truth, the God of 
our fathers, the God of Israel that 
our fathers obeyed so zealously in 
years gone by, the God of our fath-' 
ers in New York, Ohio, Missouri 
and Illinois, and in the early days 
in these valleys of the Rockies, and 
the God of our fathers in days of 
old, even in the land of Canaan. 
Let us remember that the God of 
ancient Israel is also our God, and 
that He looks upon sin and iniquity 
in the same light that He looked 
upon it thousands of years ago. 
What was sin then, is sin now ; 
what was displeasing in the sight 
of God then, is displeasing in His 
sight now, for God never changes. 
Circumstances surrounding the peo- 
ple of God may change, but the 
eternal principles of God never do, 
and God accepts on common 
ground His people in all ages and 
in all lands and climes who serve 
Him and keep His commandments ; 
and He will be pleased to multiply 
blessings upon all that merit His 
blessings. It is for us to nreach 
the gospel in all the world, gather 
the elect from all lands and climes, 
build up Zion and perform the pre- 
paratory work which must neces- 
sarily be done before Christ will 
come to reign upon the earth as the 
King of Kings and the Lord of 
Lords. 

May God help us to be faithful 



and true in the accomplishment of 
this great and glorious mission en- 
trusted to us by our heavenly Fath- 
er, is my prayer in the name of 
Jesus Christ. Amen. 



ELDER JOSEPH E. ROBINSON. 

(President of California Mission.) 

I most sincerely desire your pray- 
ers of faith in my behalf, my breth- 
ren and sisters, for I feel a little 
indisposed this morning and not 
much like speaking. However, I 
have a testimony of the Gospel. I 
know that God lives, that He hears 
and answers the prayers of faith. 
Every fiber of my being responds 
to this thought, that Jesus is the 
Christ, the begotten son of the 
Father, and our elder brother with 
whom we are joint heirs to all the 
powers and prerogatives of our 
Father's kingdom,if we but keep the 
faith. I know that Joseph Smith 
was a prophet of the Most High 
God ; and I bear testimony to what 
my brethren have said this morn- 
ing, that this knowledge is not en- 
tertained or had only by the saints, 
but some men who have not become 
members of the Church of Christ 
are convinced in their souls that 
this man was raised up of God, and 
given wisdom and knowledge and 
light far beyond his years and the 
day in which he lived. I have met 
men of letters, men of politics, men 
who are philanthropists, who have 
concurred in that thought; and 
some have expressly stated to ljie 
that no man in view of the limited 
advancement in the day of Joseph 
Smith, with the little education that 
men had in that day, but partic- 
ularly what he did not have, could 



24 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



have announced such doctrines as 
did he, unless he received them 
from some higher source, or God 
inspired him. One gentleman in 
particular, in dwelling upon these 
things, in reviewing the life of 
Joseph, in reading the Book of 
Mormon and in reading the Pro- 
phet's address to the American 
people at the time he was a can- 
didate for the presidency of the 
United States, said of him: "The 
greatest testimony and proof that 
Joseph Smith was what he says he 
was, that he received what he said 
was given him, is the very fact that 
no man, much less he, could have 
advanced such ideas and given such 
truths unless what he said is true 
and God revealed those things to 
him." I rejoice in this, for the 
Master tells us that "they who are 
not against us are on our part." 

I had occasion to remark yes- 
terday, and I believe it fully, that 
there are some things in relation 
to religion and pplitics that I 
would feel more secure in trusting 
to honorable men of the earth than 
I would to give them to some of 
our people at home, for they are 
more liberal toward us in this land 
than are some among ourselves. I 
find, that in common with the gen- 
erality of American people, we are 
prone to criticise those who sit in 
the seats of judgment, those who 
are appointed to high office. Wc 
elevate heroes t<5 exalted positions, 
men who have earned their laurels 
by courage, fidelity, honesty and 
virtue, and yet as soon as we have 
lifted them to some point of emin- 
ence, it is an American trait that 
we begin to pull them down, crit- 
icise and berate them, and I was 
going to say, bury them in the 
slime and mud of filthy politics, 
and mean jealousies, and I don't 
know but I am entitled to say it, so 



let it stand. It is so, and history 
proves it in the case of Abraham 
Lincoln,who was so foullv maligned, 
vilified and traduced by th every men 
who owed to him their pre-emin- 
ence among the American people. 
Subsequently great regret came in 
the hearts of the whole nation when 
he was stricken, then he was hon- 
ored as one of the greatest of Amer- 
icans. The same may be said of 
William McKinley. There are men 
in our midst today whom we have 
lauded to the skies because of their 
courage and fidelty on the battle- 
field or upon the battle-ship, who 
have helped to make secure the 
rights and privileges of the Am- 
erican people, that we have borne 
high upon our shoulders a little 
while only to pull down and belittle 
afterwards. This propensity of 
fault finding, that is so prevalent 
among American people, has be- 
smirched their good names and 
trailed them in the dust, and we 
forget sometimes the very things 
that we owe to these men and al- 
most forget their names ; and that is 
why I said what I did with relation 
to the fact that some honorable men 
of the earth, I believe, are more lib- 
eral to us in politics, in domestic 
relationship, and in our efforts to 
build up and colonize in these moun- 
tains, and accomplish that which 
God hath ordained that we should 
do, than we are sometimes. 

What Brother Ellsworth said in 
relation to the work of the ministry 
and the excellency of the work 
done by elders, and their very excel- 
lent characters, doubtless may be 
said of every mission established by 
the Church of Jesus Christ of Lat- 
ter-day Saints. There are times 
when some men lack faith, there are 
times when they fail to feel or sense 
the weight of the position that they 
are called to; but in the main the

boys and the men who engage in 
the work of the Lord take upon 
themselves the armor of righteous- 
ness and gird it about their loins, 
and they are humble and faithful. 
God magnifies them, and they grow 
in favor with Him and men, and 
have a rich harvest of souls and of 
testimonies to the truthfulness of 
the Gospel, and their hearts are fill- 
ed with praise and adulation to the 
Most High God. ' They are full of 
integrity and courage to defend His 
principles and honor His priesthood 
that is now upon the earth. This 
may be said of the California mis- 
sion, in which I have the pleasure 
of laboring. I want to say that 
people grow more liberal in their 
views of religion, and more liberal 
to us as a church, and yet upon that 
west sea-board there is such a 
spirit of indifference and of pleas- 
ure making and pleasure loving 
that it is very hard indeed to con- 
vince men of the necesssity of be- 
longing to any church. They sense 
with some of our great educators, 
who announced this principle at the 
last National Educational As- 
sociation that met in Los Angeles 
a year agp, "that to serve the in- 
terests of our country, to perpetu- 
ate its institutions, to best conserve 
the liberties of the peoples of this 
world as well as of our own coun- 
try, there must be a deep-seated re- 
ligious conviction in the heart of 
every man." There must be a 
Christian training, for all that is 
good in man tends towards wor- 
ship and devotion. This spirit of 
"religiosity," as Carlyle has called 
it, augments the very best that 
there is in man, let him be white or 
black, bond or free. And so men 
who think and who have watched 
the current of events, are convinced 
of this fact that we cannot drift far 
away from the principles of Chris- 



tianity* the ideal life which Christ 
lived for men, and hope to achieve 
success, and hope that the name of 
our country shall long obtain in the 
world's history, or hope that our 
children or children's children shall 
find peace and prosperity in the 
land. But, O how few of those 
who possess these ideas are willing 
to concede the fact that there must 
be a Church, that men if they be- 
long to the Christ, must take upon 
them His name, repent of their sins, 
have them washed away in the 
grave of baptism and be born anew 
from the womb of waters unto 
newness of life. They cannot see 
the philosophy of it. 

One man told me not long since : 
"I can't see the philosophy of faith, 
nor the philosophy of repentance. 
Baptism may be all right, but I 
can't see the relationship of this 
principle with that which is spirit- 
ual." He, too, had been taught 
from his youth up, these very 
principles. But when he came in- 
to the field, he said: "I find there 
are devout people in other 
churches; I find there are people 
who pray to God our Eternal Fath- 
er in the name of Christ as do we ; 
there are people who try to render 
that which is just and true to their 
fellows as do we, so far as I can 
understand, and I am not prepar- 
ed to teach these first principles. 
I believe in the life and mission of 
the Prophet Joseph. I believe that 
we had an existence before we 
came here." But these first and car- 
dinal virtues or principles of the 
Gospel he did not comprehend or 
find the necessity of. Yet there i» 
not a philosopher, aside from those 
whom we may look upon as con- 
verts to Christianity, but who 
knows that "faith is the underly- 
ing principle of all intelligent ac- 
tion," that faith impels men to do 



2Q 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



and dare. Faith it is that has 
prompted every man that has 
achieved any great result — to strive 
in his particular field for the ac- 
complishment of the purpose he 
had in view. It is true there have 
been certain discoveries made b> 
accident, they were not the result 
of faith and labor, but when we 
look upon what the world has done, 
and the great men of our world it 
has been as a rule the result of per- 
sistent and intelligent action which 
sprung out of the hope that such 
things could be accomplished, the 
faith that it could be realized. It 
was not chance nor accident that led 
Franklin into the field with his kite 
and string. It was not for pleasure 
and play that Watt and Stevenson 
labored with the giant steam, and 
dreamed out the dreams that were 
their prophets in the creation of the 
engine, of the locomotive, nor of 
Fulton with the steamboat, but 
faith, that those things would 
result as the end of their efforts. 
And the same faith hath actuated 
the minds of Edison and Marconi 
and other great inventors, and of 
the Wright brothers who have 
achieved so wonderful a feat as 
flying in the air. It is the faith that 
is persistent in the minds of men 
leading them • to delve and seek 
after and accomplish these things, 
and, as I have said, it underlies all 
intelligent action as the Prophet 
Joseph declared. It underlies re- 
ligion, and science, and philosophy, 
and politics; a faith in govern- 
ment, a faith in statesmanship, a 
faith in rule that will best subserve 
the interests of the commonwealth. 
So it seems to me that when a man 
says that he cannot see any use in 
the principle of faith, he has not 
thought at all, but he esteems it as 
something merely esthetic, dealing 
only with morbid religion. 



Repentance too goes hand hi 
hand with faith, and is its con- 
comitant part which must follow it 
as the night the day. Repentance, 
according to Carlyle, is the grand- 
est trait there is in mankind, turn- 
ing away from sin, from error, 
striving after the light, after the 
good, after the pure, after the per- 
fect, and perfecting our lives there- 
by. Every business man applies this 
principle to his business ; and when- 
ever he learns by his experience or 
by what he observes in the exper- 
ience of others that he had made a 
mistake, he repents of that, if he 
is sane, and seeks a better way. 
Whenever the scientist has made a 
mistake in his workshop or his lab- 
oratory, he turns from that mis- 
take, as soon as he discovers it, and 
applies other laws or methods to 
achieve his end. And so it follows 
faith, that principle of progression, 
and is a principle of true religon, 
for the religion of God the Eternal 
Father, the theology that deals with 
Him and His attributes and laws, 
underlies all the sciences, and they 
with their philosophies are all built 
upon it. And so repentance is as 
broad in its application and in its 
saving power as faith, and there- 
fore no wonder it is taught as one 
of the principles of religion, for re- 
ligion, properly understood and ap- 
plied, is the plan of God, and is for 
the salvation of the souls of men. 
If men persist in error, in mistakes, 
if men persist in doing things that 
are hurtful to their bodies and to 
their spirits, how can they be saved. 

When it comes to the ordinance 
of baptism, that men and women in 
the world so commonly claim is 
non-essential, after accepting these 
other principles, it is sufficient to 
me, aside from its symbolism and 
from the virtue that there is in the 
spirit of obedence that God com- 



ELDER JOSEPH E. ROBINSON.

manded it; upon the principle of 
obedience all blessings are predi- 
cated. It is only by observing- the 
law of their creation that plants 
and animals grow and have life. 
The Master when he called the at- 
tention of his apostles to the lily 
of the field said, "Behold, how it 
grows." It was not the glory of 
the lily, or its beauty that he had 
in mind, but how it graeyntelli- 
gently following the order of its 
creation and being, and answering 
the laws of its growth and develop- 
ment. And so with everything that 
we see in the universe that is har- 
monious, that is beautiful and pro- 
gressive. It answers the law of its 
growth, obeying the law thereof for 
its development. So it is sufficient 
for me to obey the law which the 
King of Heaven hath said is essen- 
tial in order that man shall see and 
enter into His kingdom ; and as He 
is the King, the Lord of Lords, and 
the law giver,surely we will concede 
to Him the' right of saying how citi- 
zens shall be initiated into that 
kingdom, and we will comply with 
that method, because He ordained 
it and Himself set the pattern. 

If we comply with it, by brethren 
and sisters, or my friends, if all 
men and women would comply with 
it, then they would have shed into 
their souls such light, and peace and 
joy, that the riches of the world 
would sink into insignificance be- 
side it. So long as they bask in the 
light of the Spirit, there is noth- 
ing on earth would tempt their feet 
to stray in forbidden paths. Then 
would they know the virtue of new- 
ness of life, then would they feel 
the freedom that comes when men 
accept the truth, and their sins have 
been forgiven and stripped from 
them. Then would they realize the 
promise which Christ made when 
He said:"This gospel is not Mine 



but His that sent Me; and if any 
man will do His will he shall know 
of the doctrine whether it be of God 
or whether I speak of Myself." 
When men have that assurance and 
testimony, they are strong in their 
hearts to do the bidding of God, and 
pity the sneer of the skeptical. They 
would pity those who do not see 
and understand, and would give all 
that is theirs to bring them to the 
knowledge of the truth; and they 
are rich in the possession of this 
truth, beyond the riches that the 
world can conceive or give. Some- 
times men and women say: "I do 
not understand it; it is beyond me. 
I cannot apprehend it; I do not 
know where you get it from. It 
sounds reasonable, it appeals to my 
mind, it moves the very emotions 
of my heart and soul." I have had 
many a man and woman tell me, 
"If I could believe as you do, Elder 
Robinson, I would be the happiest 
being on this earth, but I can't see 
it, I can't understand it." Why? 
Because they have not complied 
with the conditions of growth and 
knowledge, and they have no right 
to understand it, and no man has 
the right to expect that he will 
know all about this Gospel, or un- 
derstand even the primary prin- 
ciples thereof, until he hath com- 
plied with the conditions, and then 
the truth makes him free and error 
drops from his mind, and he comes 
into the knowledge of the truth and 
can bear testimony that God lives 
and that Jesus is the Christ. 

May the peace of the Gospel be 
in your hearts and homes, my 
brethren and sisters. May the de- 
sire to keep inviolate the pledges 
and covenants which you have 
made in the waters of baptism, and 
when you have named the name 
of God in holy places, actuate you, 
so that you will live the lives of

Latter-day Saints, that we who bear 
the ensign of tiuth in the world, 
who are your representatives, we 
who proclaim your virtues to the 
ungodly and unbelieving, shall 
never have cause to blush because

that is untrue, and that they will 
not find when they come, as we

ELDER SAMUEL 0. BENNION. 

(President of Central States Mission.) 

My brethren and sisters, it is a 
pleasure for me to have the priv- 
ilege of addressing you this after- 
noon, and I trust that while I do so 
I will have an interest in your faith 
and prayers, and that our Father 
in heaven may bless us, that what is 
said may be in accordance with His 
mind and will. It is unprofitable 
for any one to address this congre- 
gation of Latter-day Saints, or 
anywhere else, I think, whether 
they are Saints or not, without the 
inspiration of the Lord to direct 
his remarks, while he is teaching 
the Gospel or acting in the author- 
ity he has received from the Lord. 

I was thinking this, afternoon 
about the great man who wrote 
Proverbs, who said, "Where there 
is no vision the people perish. But 
he that keepeth the law, happy is 
he." In traveling throughout the 
country we can see this is verified 
to the letter, that people will un- 
doubtedly perish if there is no di- 
vine vision. If our Father in 
Heaven does not reveal His mind 
and will unto His people, through 
such means as visions, and through 
prophets, then they must perish in 
unbelief. That was the condition 
under which the world was when 
the Prophet Joseph Smith received 
instructions from an angel. When 
the Prophet read in the Bible the in- 
struction that James laid down, "If 
any of you lack wisdom, let him 
ask of God, that giveth to all men 
liberally and upbraideth not, and it 
shall be given him," he was, per- 
haps, the first man in ages that 



ELDER SAMUEL 0. BENNION. 



29 



had put the interpretation upon that 
passage that he did. He thus ascer- 
tained in his boyhood days that he 
might go and ask the Lord. It ap- 
peared clear to him that the Lord 
had inspired James to make this 
promise, and that, therefore he 
might go and ask God which of all 
the denominations of religion then 
upon the earth were correct. Thus 
the Lord had indicated a means 
through which His sons and daugh- 
ters need not perish, and there 
would be no need for them to run 
hither and thither, searching for 
the truth and not finding it, but that 
He would again open up the chan- 
nel of revelation to His children. 

Since that time the work has been 
going on ; missionaries have been 
going out into the world, under the 
appointment they have received of 
God through the Presidency of His 
Church, whom the Lord has ap- 
pointed to guide and govern Israel 
in these last days. Through the in- 
spiration of Heaven, thus coming 
unto them, thousands have received 
the truth. Under the inspiration oi 
the Lord, thousands of authorized 
men have gone out and declared 
unto the people that there has been 
a vision again, that there has been 
and is now revelation to God's chil- 
dren here in tjhe earth from the 
Eternal Father, that we need no 
longer perish in unbelief. We can 
call upon Him and receive an an- 
swer to our petitions ; we can serve 
Him in spirit and in truth, and 
know that if we follow the plans 
He has given througjh His Son 
Jesus Christ we will receive an in- 
heritance in His kingdom according 
to our works here upon the earth. 
Our missionaries go out preaching 
these truths, and thousands of peo- 
ple have accepted the Gospel mes- 
sage which they bear, and now 
know that the doctrines of "Mor- 



monism" are correct and that God 
has indeed again revealed His mind 
and will. The Prophet Joseph 
Smith declared this unto the world. 
He gathered around him many men 
who were capable of declaring it, 
who stood by him, and who went 
forth among the nations of the 
earth, and they have gathered fruit 
unto the Master. They can look in- 
to the faces of their brothers and 
sisters and declare that they know 
that God lives and has spoken again 
from the heavens, and that we arc 
entitled to revelation from Him, the 
same as in the days when Christ ana 
His Apostles were upon the earth. 
They declare the same Gospel that 
Christ taught; they teach with 
words of soberness that Jesus and 
His Father have again appeared 
unto the children of men, that there 
is a channel opened up whereby 
men and women may go on unto 
perfection, and be received back in- 
to the presence of their Heavenly 
Father. 

The Latter-day Saints as a body 
I think, do not understand this as 
perfectly as they should do; I be- 
lieve they should pay more atten- 
tion to it than they do. It is obliga- 
tory upon us to teach it unto all 
the sons and daughters of God that 
we come in contact with. It is our 
duty when we have children to 
teach it unto them, and prepare 
them that when the time comes for 
them to go into the world and 
preach it unto the children of men, 
they may be qualifed to do so. 

There are thousands of people, 
my brethren and sisters, who have 
not yet heard the Gospel of the 
Redeemer. As I have said, we are 
sending out missionaries to teach 
them the Gospel, to cry repentance 
unto them, and I want to tell you 
they are representing us nobly in 
the earth ; they are receiving praise 



30 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



and gratitude from those among 
whom they labor, and they are la- 
boring earnestly and faithfully. I 
believe there are none under the 
sun who labor more faithfully than 
do the Elders of Israel, traveling 
from house to house, from state to 
state, without hope of remunera- 
tion in this life, preaching the Gos- 
pel freely unto the people, after the 
plan that the Apostles of old did, 
and the same condition that Christ 
laid down when he said : "Freely 
ye have received, freely give." They 
go out into the world, calling peo- 
ple unto repentance in their homes 
and upon the street corners, preach- 
ing in halls, and leaving books, 
tracts and other literature with 
them, that have been prepared by 
the Latter-day Saints, truthfully 
representing their principles and 
doctrines. 

It is wonderful, my brethren and 
sisters, the work in this direction 
that is going on in the world; and 
I may as well give a brief account 
of what is being accomplished in 
the mission where I have the priv- 
ilege of laboring. During the last 
nine months, beginning with the 
first of January, we havj 
had 216 baptisms. We have 
distributed over 49,000 books. We 
have held,6,633 meetings,have visit- 
ed 195,471 families in tracting, 
and distributed 244,617 tracts. We 
have blessed 117 children. At a 
cost of, perhaps, an average of $20 
per elder, per month, it is simply 
astonishing the amount of work 
that our elders are doing. Now this 
is just one corner of the earth, and 
we understand that the elders are 
laboring similarly teaching the Gos- 
pel that the Savior taught, distribut- 
ing literature, asking the people if 
they won't, at least, read about us ; 
asking them to investigate the doc- 



trines we are teaching, not asking 
them to be baptized at once, bul 
listen to what we have to say. We 
ask them to "read the Book of 
Mormon, see if it does not testify 
unto you, through the Spirit, con- 
cerning its truthfulness." 

When we think of the great mis- 
sionaries who have thus gone, 
and of the great work they have 
done, such men as John Taylor and 
Wilford Woodruff, who went out 
without purse or scrip and taught 
this Gospel unto the people, going 
from house to house, from city to 
city, it is remarkable how strong 
and faithful those men were in 
times of trial, and what testimonies 
their converts received from the 
Lord that He had again spoken 
from the heavens. When men who 
had become disaffected sought to 
turn the baptized believers away 
from the Prophet Joseph Smith, it 
was invariably their reply, if the 
Gospel was true when you taught 
it to me, it is now. We have the 
privilege today of listening unto 
men of God, unto Prophets of the 
Lord, who prove unto us that the 
revelations of our Father in Heaven 
still continue, and that we need not 
perish in unbelief, if we will but 
open our ears to hear and our 
hearts to understand, and that this 
Gospel of the kingdom has been 
established and will never be 
thrown down nor given unto anoth- 
er people. The responsibility rests 
upon the Latter-day Saints to go 
out and declare unto the world the 
principles that have been revealed 
from heaven. There is nothing 
greater in the world than "Mor- 
monism," there is no religion equal 
to it. So far as the conversion of 
the souls of men is concerned, our 
field is the world. It is our duty to 
go out and declare the Gospel of

the Redeemer. Hundreds of thou- 
sands have already responded to the 
call. 

As to loyalty, there is nothing 
in the world that equals the loyalty 
of the Latter-day Saints. We know 
that the Lord has spoken from the 
heavens that He has a Prophet here 
upon the earth ; and we are sons 
and daughters of the pioneers of 
this chosen country, enjoying what 
our pioneer fathers and mothers 
prepared for us. I have wondered 
if we have been doing all that we 
should, and if we sense as we 
should the position that we occupy 
as sons and daughters of those 
pioneers who passed through so 
much hardship for the establish- 
ment of the people of God in this 
country. 

We have not any time to waste. 
No matter whether a man is at 
home or abroad, he should use 
his time and his talent, all 
that can possibly be giv- 
en, to the building up of .the Church 
and Kingdom of our Father. A 
man who will do this will grow and 
increase in the earth, and will be 
blessed of the Lord, he will be a 
power for good wherever he goes, 
and will be in a position to return 
unto the Lord some of the bless- 
ings that he has received, some of 
the substance of the earth, and re- 
sults of the talents that God has 
given him. Such a man will be en- 
titled to the resurrection and ex- 
altation which you and I are all 
seeking for. I thank the Lord for 
His mercies and I ask Him to bless 
the Latter-day Saints, in the name 
of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER HUGH J. CANNON. 

(President of Liberty Stake.) 

My brethren and sisters, there 
are doubtless in this congregation 



men and women who have traveled 
many miles, several hundred miles 
perhaps in some cases, to attend 
this conference ; and they have 
come here, no doubt, with a desire 
to be strengthened in their faith, 
and built up in their determination 
to more faithfully serve the Lord in 
the future than they have done in 
the past. It seems to me, under 
these circumstances, that they have 
a claim upon the blessings of the 
Almighty, and any speaker who at- 
tempts to address them should cer- 
tainly have the benefit of their faith 
and prayers. No man, no matter 
what his qualifications may be, who 
has the spirit of the Gospel in his 
heart, ever attempts to address a 
congregation upon the vital prin- 
ciples of the Gospel without feel- 
ing a desire to have the guid- 
ance of the Holy Spirit, and cer- 
tainly I am in that position myself 
this afternoon. 

I have been led to think during 
the last few weeks of the import- 
ance of having a testimony of the 
divinity of this work in which we 
are engaged. It has been impress- 
ed upon my mind more strongly 
than at any time before in my life, 
that we should have a knowledge 
that God lives, the knowledge that 
we are engaged in His service, the 
knowledge that the authority, the 
Priesthood, is in our midst, and 
that we have among us those who 
are qualified, and have the author- 
ity to point out to us the way in 
which we should walk. Now, we 
hear a great deal concerning the 
outward ordinances of the gospel. 
The Latter-day Saints, in my 
opinion, are pretty well posted as 
to the Scriptural proof. Of course 
we are not as well acquainted with 
the Scriptures as we might be ; but 
still it seems to me we are better 
equipped with proofs of the divinity 



32 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



of the Gospel that are contained in 
the Scriptures than we are with the 
inward testimony. We know what 
the Scriptures say about our duties, 
and about the religion in which we 
believe. We see the outward mani- 
festations of the Spirit of the Lord. 
We see the sick healed. We know 
that the signs follow those that be- 
lieve. But important as this is, it 
is not the only testimony which we 
can have, and I believe it may be 
said with perfect truth that it is not 
the most important testimony that 
can come to our hearts. Every per- 
son who belongs to this Church 
should inquire into his own condi- 
tion and see whether there is in his 
heart strong and abiding faith, and 
a testimony of the divinity of this 
work outside of any Scriptural 
proof, because it is stronger and 
more enduring than any written 
word or any outward manifestation 
can possibly be. If we will look 
into our hearts, as I have said, 
look down into the depths of 
our own souls, I am sure that 
every man and woman will discover 
an abundance of reasons why we 
should maintain our standing in the 
Church, and why we should go on 
in the path which has been pointed 
out for us to follow. There is no 
Latter-day Saint who has reached 
the age of accountability, or at 
least has reached the age of man- 
hood, but would find in the depths 
of his heart sufficient reason for his 
standing in this Church, and suf- 
ficient reason for him to labor dili- 
gently and faithfully to maintain 
that standing. 

For my own part, when I ex- 
amine myself and my own life, my 
own hopes and aspirations, I need 
go no further to find evidence 
enough to justify me in the pur- 
suit of my present course; because, 
weak and frail and incompetent as 



I am, I still see that I am better 
and higher, more advanced, than 
would have been the case without 
the teachings of this gospel of Jesus 
Christ. I see where it has made 
me better, where it has held me 
back from committing sin, and from 
going in wrong directions. It has 
taught me by the whisperings of 
the Spirit, that when I depart from 
the straight and narrow path, I may 
return and get into line. I need no 
better indicator as to my duty than 
the teachings which are contained 
in the Gospel of the Lord Jesus 
Christ. The Savior said, "By then- 
fruits ye shall know them." When 
we apply this test to the Church 
and to its members, individually 
and collectively, we find sufficient 
proof to convince any reasonable 
man that our claims are well found- 
ed. We need not be ashamed of the 
gospel of Jesus Christ when we 
apply this test, which the Savior 
gave, to the lives of those who have 
joined tjhe Church, and who arc 
carrying on this work, because the} 
will compare very favorably with 
any other people upon the face of 
the earth, according to my experi- 
ence. We are imperfect, and do 
things which we should not do. 
We grieve, no doubt many times, 
the Spirit of the Lord, by our weak- 
nesses and our folies; and still 
there is no better people throughout 
the world, I am fully convinced, 
than can be found in the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 
When this test is applied it furnish- 
es a satisfactory answer to me for 
the hope which I have, for the faith 
which is in my heart, that this is 
the truth, and that through this 
Gospel I may be saved in the king- 
dom of our Father in Heaven. 

Now, we are not perfect. We do 
not pretend to be. We do not want 
to think we are perfect, but it

won't hurt us any to think that we 
are as good as other people, as 
long as we are humble and prayer- 
ful. There is a higher standard set 
for the Latter-day Saints than for 
any other people upon the earth. 1 
remember once having a conversa- 
tion in the mission field with a 
young lady who had been born and 
raised in Utah, although she was 
not a member of the Church, and 
never had been. She was study- 
ing music in the city of Berlin. We 
had a number of gospel conversa- 
tions with her. While she was very 
friendly, and frequently helped us 
in our meetings with her musical 
talent, she did not have any faith 
in the Gospel, at least not very 
much. On one occasion when I 
was present she got into an argu- 
ment with some of the missionar- 
ies. She said : "Well, I know Cath- 
olics, and Methodists and Presby- 
terians that live their religion bet- 
ter than the Latter-day Saints do." 
"Why," I said to her, "that is easy. 
It is not difficult for a Catholic to 
live his religion." It is easy for any 
person belonging to these various 
denominations to live their relig- 
ion, because it does not require 
anything special of them; but you 
take a religion that sets perfection 
as its standard, that requires per- 
fection of its members, and it is a 
little more difficult to live that re- 
ligion. With all due respect to oth- 
er denominations, it is possible for 
their adhierents to go along with 
the stream, living as the world 
lives, and still live their religion , 
but with the Latter-day Saint it is 
vastly different. He must cast 
aside all these weaknesses which 
men in the world have, must walk 
in that straight way, deviating 
neither to the right nor to the left, 
in order to live the religion of 



Jesus Christ; he must not smoke, 
must not drink tea or coffee, must 
not profane, must not break the 
Sabbath, must be virtuous, clean 
in every act and thought of his life. 
In order to fully live up to his be- 
lief, he must live a perfect life, and 
who can do it in this mortal state? 
Very few, if any at all. None, per- 
haps, can live this Gospel of the 
Lord Jesus Christ as it should be 
lived. No wonder that people may 
say the Catholics or persons of oth- 
er denominations can live their re- 
ligion better than we Latter-da\ 
Saints can. Why, it is further proof 
that the religion which we have, 
and which we claim is the plan ol 
salvation is better and higher than 
anything else in the world. 

I thank the Lord from the bottom 
of my heart for the testimony of 
the divinity of this work, which He 
has given«ne. I thank Him that 1 
know that He lives, that I know 
that Jesus is the Christ, and I thank 
Him still more that I know that 
divine authority is upon the earth 
today. I appreciate that testimony 
more than the other, if possible. 
There are plenty of men in the 
world who have a knowledge of 
Jesus Christ, who believe firmly, 
and who are sincere in that belief, 
that He was the Son of God, and 
that He did redeem the world. And 
still they have not got the knowl- 
edge that He has spoken in this 
day. They know nothing about the 
authority which He has delegated 
to mankind in the generation in 
which they live, and they are de- 
prived of the great blessings whicli 
come to the Latter-day Saints, as 
partakers of the New and Ever- 
lasting Covenant; and therefore I 
say that, if possible, I am more 
thankful for the testimony which 
I have that prophets live upon the 



34 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



earth now, that the Lord has spok- 
en today, than I am for the other 
knowledge. Of course we can 
never have this testimony without 
having the other, but I am remind- 
ed of the number of people there 
are in the world, and the number 
there are in our own community 
who know that Christ lives. At 
least, they profess to have that 
knowledge. Some of them go a 
step further, and profess to believe 
implicitly that Joseph Smith was a 
Prophet of the Almighty, that 
Brigham Young was his legal suc- 
cessor, and that John Taylor, Wil' 
ford Woodruff and those who have 
succeeded them as presidents of the 
Church were duly authorized to 
lead this people ; but some of those 
remind me of the saying of the 
Savior, they honor the dead pro- 
phets but would kill the living 
prophets if they had the power. 
There are men in our community 
who do that very thing, who have 
that very feeling in their hearts, 
because they have grieved the 
Spirit, and they are living in the 
dead past. I thank God that to 
some extent I can live in the pres- 
ent, and in the future. 

All that I have, all that I ever 
hope to have is tied up in the Gos- 
pel. I pray that the Lord may 
bless us and enable us to walk in 
the path set for our feet. That we 
may see the light, and that we may 
know it when we see it, that we 
may not be left to wander in dark- 
ness ; that our faith may be strong 
and perfect, and that we may go on 
to perfection, is my prayer, in the 
name of Jesus Christ. Amen,

BISHOP HEBER C. IVERSON. 

I have greatly rejoiced in the spir- 
it and instruction of this conference 
and I sincerely trust that during the 
few moments I occupy this import- 
ant position I may be inspired of the 
Lord to say something that will be 
of value to us, and that will re- 
dound to the honor and glory of our 
Father's work and kingdom. 

I have listened with a great deal 
of interest to the remarks that have 
already been made, and especially 
have been impressed with the state- 
ments made by President Cannon, 
who preceded me. Some time ago I 
attended a meeting at which he 
spoke, and his testimony was similar 
to the one borne to us this after- 
noon, and it made upon my mind a 
lasting impression. He .spoke of his 
gratitude unto our Father in heav- 
en for imparting unto him the 
knowledge that Jesus is the Christ, 
and that Joseph Smith was and is a 
prophet of God, "but more import- 
ant," said he, "than the other is the 
fact that I know that he who stands 
today at the head of the Church is 
likewise a prophet, inspired of the 
Almighty, chosen of Him to lead Is- 
rael and to guide His people." This 
last expression — possibly not in 
these words exactly — found an echo 
in my heart, and as I have stated, 
made a lasting impression. I be- 
lieve it to be of vital importance, 
my brethren and sisters, that we 
should know that Joseph F. Smith, 
who, today stands at the head of 
God's cause upon the earth, is His 
chosen servant, that he is inspired of 
God. Thanks to .the Lord, we may 
enjoy this testimony, and need not 
grope in darkness. The Lord, in His 
wisdom, His infinite love and mercy, 
has indeed made plain the way, and 
made the provision, whereby each

and all of us may know for our- 
selves whether our President speaks 
of the Lord or of himself ; whether 
he speaks as one having authority, 
and whether the work that he is en- 
deavoring to advance in the earth, 
and the instructions he gives unto us 
from day to day, are the Lord's 
work and His will concerning us. 

I remember reading from that 
learned Professor Drummond, these 
words : "Obedience is the organ of 
spiritual knowledge, a most remark- 
able association," says he, "that has 
been made by the Master." Jesus 
Himself made this declaration, "My 
doctrine is not mine, but His that 
sent me ; if any man will do His will 
he shall know of the doctrine,wheth- 
er it be of God or whether I speak of 
myself." In other words, he who is 
in the line of duty, keeping the com- 
mandments of God, obeying His re- 
quirements and receiving His in- 
struction, upon him will rest the 
inspiration of the Almighty, the 
light of heaven and of truth, and he 
will know it is true, darkness is not 
in his path. Prof. Drummond, com- 
menting upon this says, "It is a most 
remarkable association, where we 
associate obedience, which is consid- 
ered purely spiritual, with knowl- 
edge, which is considered entirely 
intellectual." But yet the associa- 
tion has been made by the great 
Master and Teacher. Along this 
line of thought let me illustrate the 
importance of the principle of obe- 
dience by calling your attention to a 
circumstance with which you are fa- 
miliar. The Lord directed the proph- 
et Samuel to say to Saul that he and 
his army should go forth and slay 
all the Amalekites, and bring noth- 
ing with him on his return home. 
Saul went out and fulfilled part of 
the commandment, but saw that 



which seemed to attract him, and he 
spared part of that which he had 
captured, to the displeasure of the 
Lord and Saul's own destruction. 
When Saul returned to the Prophet 
Samuel and declared he had done 
the will of the Lord, and had kept 
His commandment, the prophet 
asked him, "What meaneth then this 
bleating of the sheep in mine ears, 
and the lowing of the oxen which I 
hear?" and Saul undertook to make 
apology. You are all acquainted with 
the story, and you remember the 
words of the Lord through the 
Prophet Samuel : "Hath the Lord as 
great delight in burnt offerings and 
sacrifice as in obeying the voice of 
the Lord ? Behold to obey is better 
than sacrifice and to hearken than 
the fat of rams." Returning to the 
sentiment expressed by Prof. Drum- 
mond, that "obedience is the organ 
of spiritual knowledge," just a word 
of comment on that thought. In the 
wisdom of the Almighty it has thus 
been ordained, were it otherwise 
than that "obedience is the organ of 
spiritual knowledge," and that to 
know God, to find out Him and His 
ways, were left to the learned and 
the wealthy, how should the hum- 
ble and unlearned, the poor of the 
earth receive the gospel? The Lord, 
in His mercy and love, has made 
plain the way and easy the path that 
the most humble and unlearned can 
find if they seek after Him; they 
may know Him, if they will, with- 
out a college education.great wealth 
or affluence. They can come unto 
Him and receive of His bounteous 
blessings and His love. The Lord 
has made these provisions, and we 
as Latter-day Saints should be 
grateful that the gospel has been 
preached to the poor of the earth. 
You remember the Lord said that 



36 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



this was one of the evidences of 
His divine mission when they who 
were sent by John the Baptist came 
and asked Him in reference to His 
identity, whether he was the Mes- 
siah or whether they should look 
for another. Jesus told them to go 
and tell John that the lame are made 
to walk, the blind to see, and the 
gospel is preached unto the poor; 
that the gospel was preached to the 
poor was cited as a strong evidence 
that He was indeed the Lord. 

In order to enjoy the blessings of 
the Lord we must yield obedience to 
His will. I was thinking along this 
line this morning, while listening to 
the remarks of President Smith, in 
relation to a vital principle, one of 
the fundamental principles of the 
gospel. Obedience to the Word of 
Wisdom I regard as of very great 
importance to us as Latter-day 
Saints, for that word contains a 
great deal that is of temporal and 
spiritual value to us, and to the 
youth of Zion. I consider that every 
father and mother should set his and 
her children examples worthy of 
emulation. When children are 
taught in the Sabbath schools, the 
Primary associations, the Religion 
classes, and kindred institutions, 
and taught by the elders of the 
Church that it is the Lord's will 
that we abstain from those things 
forbidden in the Word of Wisdom, 
and then they see their fathers and 
mothers, whom they regard as the 
most nearly perfect beings in the 
world, on whom they rely absolutely 
for guidance, whose instruction and 
example is more potent in the form- 
ation of their character than any 
other agency in the world, if they 
see them in open violation of this 
Word of Wisdom, what think you 
is the result upon the minds of 
those children? I believe that if I 



have inherited an unholy appetite 
that is difficult to control, and I am 
conscious of it, that if I give way to 
it I will possibly destroy or darken 
my soul, and drive from me the 
Spirit of the Almighty, which it is 
my privilege to enjoy, I should lose 
no time in doing all in my power to 
control and root out, if possible, 
that inherent disposition; or, if I 
have an appetite, the gratification of 
which is worth more to me than my 
children's interests and welfare, I 
feel and believe that I am an un- 
worthy parent. Every child that 
comes into my home is not only a 
child of mine but a child of my 
heavenly Father, and unto Him I 
am responsible for the instruction I 
give to that child, for the example I 
set and possibly for the result of 
those instructions and examples ; 
for them I shall stand amenable to 
Him. I remember now the words 
of the Apostle Paul, who said : "We 
have had fathers of the flesh which 
corrected us, and we gave them rev- 
erence ; should we not much rather 
be in subjection to the Father of our 
spirits and live ?" The essential part 
of man, nay, the being himself, the 
spirit, is a child of God ; man is a dual 
being. We have had fathers of the 
physical organism ; these physical 
beings were created, begotten by 
our earthly parents, but that which 
thinks and wills, the ego, self or 
spirit, if you please, the enduring 
part of man, that which existed in 
the presence of the Great Eternal 
One, and came to earth to pass 
through this mortal probation, this 
school of human experience so nec- 
essary in the providence of the Al- 
mighty, that I say is a child of our 
Father. When He sends a child of 
His to earth He gives to the parents 
that which is more precious to Him 
than all the wealth of the worlds 



BISHOP HEBER C. IVERSON.

He has created. Sacred, indeed, is 
the trust, and great is the responsi- 
bility that is placed upon those who 
receive a child of His. I say, then, 
if my precepts and example are not 
in keeping with His will and in har- 
mony with His law, and that child 
of His shall go to destruction, be- 
cause of my failure to keep the com- 
mandments of the Lord, woe be un- 
to me. And if I shall, through my 
own wrongdoing, transmit an un- 
holy desire or soul destroying appe- 
tite, to any child of mine (for I am 
a believer in pre-natal influences) I 
shall thus place around that child's 
neck a millstone, as it were, and 
possibly that millstone may drag 
him into the depths of degradation, 
and I, because of selfish gratifica- 
tion of my appetites, am responsible 
for his destruction, what think you 
shall be my condemnation? I re- 
gard these things seriously, my 
brethren and sisters. I consider as 
one of my most solemn duties and 
responsibilities, that I shall set be- 
fore the children that God gives me 
examples worthy of emulation. Rec- 
ognizing my own weaknesses as I 
do, asking God's help constantly in 
the battle of life, I desire that I may 
indeed impress upon my children, if 
possible, the thought that I am at 
least sincere in my profession. If I 
can lay deep in their hearts the 
fountain of faith, make them feel I 
truly believe that which I am teach- 
ing them, that my life is consistent 
therewith, and I can go to my grave 
having established in the hearts of 
my children abiding faith in the gos- 
pel of Jesus Christ, His revealed 
will and commandments, I will feel 
that I have done more for them 
than though I had bequeathed them 
untold millions, or .eriven to them 
any or all the perishable things of 
this world. 



I feel that the Word of Wisdom 
is an important law unto this peo- 
ple. If the father and mother in the 
home feel that they can violate this 
commandment of the Lord with im- 
punity, they are mistaken. Suppos- 
ing you teach your children that 
these forbidden things, set forth in 
the Word of Wisdom, are hurtful 
to them, and then you partake 
of them'; suppose you teach 
your children that tea, coffee, to- 
bacco, or liquor are hurtful, and 
you partake of any one of these, 
in so doing do you not give 
your children the opportunity to 
think and to feel that, while you do 
not partake of the other things men- 
tioned that the law is not so import- 
ant in your mind as it might be? 
These things are all in the same for- 
bidden class, included in the same 
commandment, therefore, do you 
not give to your children a license, 
and do you not set before them this 
example, and impress them with 
this thought, that the law, after all, 
cannot be very important, otherwise 
my parents would not violate it? 
Either that, or the children will say 
to themselves, "My parents believe 
in it, but they are too weak to live 
up to the requirements of the Lord." 
Truly you would be humiliated if 
you were compelled to acknowledge 
before your children your inability 
and weakness. It would indeed be 
humiliating for you to say to your 
children : "This is the Lord's will ; 
these things are hurtful, but I am 
not strong enough, I am not capable 
of controlling myself sufficiently, 
and I yield to my appetites." Be- 
sides, it would lessen your influence 
with your children, and lessen the 
respect they entertain for you, very 
materially. We should be consistent 
in these matters ; we should deny 
ourselves for our children's sake, 



38 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



our own sake, and because of the 
reverence we have for Him' who is 
the father of the spirits of our chil- 
dren ; and for the sake of being obe- 
dient to the will of the Lord, that 
we may be possesed of that knowl- 
edge to which President Cannon re- 
ferred, and of a knowledge of the 
truth of the gospel. 

I am delighted to know, as Presi- 
dent Smith said this morning, that 
there is a temperance wave sweep- 
ing the country. I sincerely hope 
that we shall feel its force, and that 
we shall be found in the stream of 
its onward progress ; that we 
shall do our utmost to assist in 
the accomplishment of the end for 
which it aims, and that we and our 
children may derive benefit from 
this important movement. 

In conclusion, I desire to bear tes- 
timony that I know that Joseph F. 
Smith is a prophet of God, that he 
is now the one chosen of God to lead 
this people. We can do no better 
than to seek his counsel and advice, 
and follow therein. It is no sacri- 
fice »of manhood for us to resolve 
that we will be obedient unto the 
Lord, that we will be submissive un- 
to him ; for I take it that obedience 
is one of the strongest attributes of 
the noblest men in the world. It 
was one of the pre-eminent fea- 
tures or qualities in the life of Him 
who died that men might live. None 
have been quite so obedient as was 
He, obedient to the will of His 
Father. Let us remember His 
orayer : "Father, if it be possible, 
let this bitter cup pass from me ; 
nevertheless, not as I will,, but as 
thou wilt." I believe that before him 
passed, in panoramic view, as it 
were, that which he would have to 
endure ; in the depths of. woe and 
bitterness of suffering, He felt that 



if it were possible that His great 
mission could in any other way be 
accomplished than that He should 
thus suffer, that it might be so; 
"nevertheless, not my will, but as 
thou wilt ; not my will, but thine, be 
done." He is our example in obedi- 
ence. He was implicitly obedient to 
the will of his Father, yet He 
was the greatest Man that ever 
lived in the world, and, by 
the way, the most maligned, 
abused and persecuted Man that 
ever lived. From' His childhood, 
yea, from His birth, His life was 
sought by the powers of darkness. 
Remember how Herod, the king, 
sought His life, for fear that he, 
Herod, would be deprived of his 
throne by the King Child, if Jesus 
were permitted to live. Hence, I 
say, from the day of His birth until 
He was cruelly suspended between 
heaven and earth, He was hounded, 
persecuted and maligned, slandered 
and abused by those who were in 
darkness, and by those whose hearts 
were full of bitterness and preju- 
dice. If He was thus misunderstood, 
driven from pillar to post, maligned 
and slandered, He was the Son of 
God, the Redeemer of the world, 
the sinless One upon whose lips 
was found no guilt, if He was thus 
ill-treated and misunderstood — and 
I believe there were those so full of 
corruption, so comoletely given 
over to the power of the adversary, 
that they claimed they did God ser- 
vice in thus persecuting- and putting 
to death the Redeemer of the world 
— I say if this be true of Him who 
was sinless, could it not be true like- 
wise that His servants who, though 
not sinless, are men after God's own 
heart, that they, too, might be mis- 
' understood, maligned, slandered, 
and put to death by those who are

inspired by the powers of darkness ? 
I say to you that JoseDh F. Smith 
is a prophet of God. Under God's 
inspiration he will lead this people 
aright. My greatest desire is that I 
may be ever worthy of his confi- 
dence, willing to receive his coun- 
sel and follow therein; if I can do 
this I feel sure of salvation in the 
kingdom of God. 

May the Lord add His blessing, 
and help each of us to secure an in- 
heritance in His kingdom, is my 
prayer, in the name of Jesus. Amen. 



ELDER BEN E. RICH. 

(President of Eastern States Mission.) 

Those who are in the tabernack 
this afternoon, listening to the pro- 
phets, seers and revelators of God's 
people are hearing no greater truth 
than you have heard from the 
brethren who have spoken to you 
here in this building. Those who 
have spoken have done so by the 
power of the same Holy Spirit, by 
the authority of the same priest- 
hood, and they have taught you the 
truths of heaven. I have listened 
with a great deal of interest to their 
remarks, and I sincerely hope that 
God may help me, as I believe they 
have been assisted, and that you 
may give me your faith and prayers 
during the time that I may occupj 
in speaking to you, as I may be led 
by the direction of the Holy Spirit. 

Apostfe Richards told you, in 
introducing me, that I had been for 
some years in the Southern States. 
Ten years and three months have 1 
labored in the sunny south, and thai, 
too with a great deal of satisfac- 
tion. My father was a southerner , 
he was born in the State of Ken- 
tucky, and while my mother wa:- 



born in Illinois, yet her people were 
southerners, and were from the 
state of South Carolina, so that I 
have southern blood in my veins 
and Irish also. (I am proud of 
that little drop of Irish blood. I 
suppose it is Irish; my father's 
mother's name was O'Neill — I 
don't think she came from Ger- 
many.) I have been most happy in 
bearing my testimony to the prin- 
ciples of the Gospel throughout the 
south land, and many times I have 
publicly expressed my appreciation 
of the kindness bestowed upon me 
by the people of that land. I have 
stated many times that I believed 
they were the most religious people 
in the United States, the kindest 
hearted, the most generous and hos- 
pitable, and I repeat it. My heart 
will never be weaned away from the 
good people of the south. 

Inasmuch as one mission presi- 
dent has given a synopsis of the 
work done in his field, I think per- 
haps it would not be out of place 
for me to do likewise. 

During the time I have labored 
in the south, 1 think there has been 
25,000 Books of Mormon distribut- 
ed among the people, 160,000 Voice 
of Warning, 150,000 copies of "Mr. 
Durant," a work upon the princi- 
ples of the Gospel, some 25,000 
hymn books, 40,000 other miscel- 
laneous works, 3,500,000 religious 
tracts; and there has been a little 
over 6,800 people baptized into the 
Church. That bears me out, I think, 
in saying they are the most religi- 
ous people that we are finding in 
any portion of the United States. 
Their love is strong, and their pre 
judice is strong. They are not 
hypocritical. If they are your 
friends you will find it out very 
quick, and if otherwise they don't 
hesitate in letting you know it. God 
bless the people of the south. I

thought I would like to say just 
these few words concerning them, 
now that I am to take my depart- 
ure to another field of labor. I am 
glad I am going to another field; 
that is my business. I am a Seventy 
in the Church, and my place is out 
on the firing lines. That is w,hen; 
my priesthood calls me, and I trust- 
that while I live and bear this 
priesthood I will be willing to re- 
main out in the world, so long as 
the authorities of the Church may 
see fit to keep me there. 

There are many reasons why I 
rejoice in the knowledge that I am 
going to labor in the Eastern 
States. I look upon that as a sacred 
ground. It was there that the boy 
prophet, as mentioned by President 
Bennion, went into the woods, and 
kneeling down in solitude, asked 
God for wisdom. It was in that field 
where the heavens were opened, 
after centuries of darkness, and 
where God the Eternal Father and 
His Son Jesus Christ condescended 
to speak once more to their children 
upon the earth. It was there, in 
answer to prayer, where God sent 
the angel Moroni to visit the 
Prophet and reveal to him concern- 
ing the plates that had been hid for 
centuries, and which gave to the 
world a knowledge, then unknown, 
concerning the dealings if the Al- 
mighty with one half of this world 
of ours. It was there that this sac- 
red record was translated by the 
gift and power of God. It was 
there that the Almighty sent John 
the Baptist with the Aaronic priest- 
hood, when he came to Joseph and 
Oliver, in Pennsylvania, and laying 
his hands upon their heads, be- 
stowed upon them, in the name of 
Messiah, the Aaronic Priesthood, 
with a promise that it never more 
would be taken from the earth until 
the' sons of Levi did offer an offei- 



ing unto God in righteousness. It 
was there that the Father sent 
Peter, James and John, who came 
upon their mission to bestow the 
holy Melchisedek Priesthood and 
ordain those servants Apostles of 
the Lord Jesus Christ. It was 
there that the first people in this 
dispensation were led down into the 
waters of baptism, where they were 
confirmed members of the Church, 
where the Church was organized, 
and where God did many wonder- 
ful things in setting up His Church 
and Kingdom upon the earth. Not 
only that, but it was in that terri- 
tory that God did something else 
before this, the setting up of the 
government of the United States, a 
part of the work of God that wai 
a forerunner of the coming of His 
Holy Son upon the earth. In this 
sacred book too, the Book of Mor- 
mon, we read that the Almighty 
took the prophet Nephi upon a high 
mountain and gave to him a vision 
of the future, showing him a time 
when His Spirit would move upon 
an individual, causing him to crosj 
the mighty waters, coming to a 
remnant of His people, and that the 
power of God would be upon those 
who gathered to this land. The 
Lord showed Nephi how His Spirit 
moved upon them in breaking loose 
from their mother country, and 
afterwards contending for their lib- 
erty, and organizing the govern- 
ment of independence upon this 
land. 

Talk about loyalty to the govern- 
ment of the United States, there is 
no church upon the earth the mem- 
bers of which believe as fully as wc 
believe, that the organization of this 
government was a part of the work 
of Almighty God. There is no peo- 
ple upon the earth who believe as 
strongly as we believe, that what 
God has set up no man should teai

down. Therefore that sacred book, 
which is a part of our religion, 
give^ the lie to any man or any set 
of men, any political party, who 
say the Latter-day Saints are not 
the most loyal Americans living 
upon the face of the earth. We 
keep an army of over 2,000 men out 
in all parts of the civilized earth, 
teaching, what? That God made 
the government of the Unites 
States ! That is a part of their mis- 
sionary work, distributing the 
proof, given to us by revelation 
from on high, of the fact that this 
government is a part of the work 
of God, the only government upon 
the face of the earth that He has 
set up, and demonstrated by revela- 
tion, by vision, that it is His work. 
Yet we find some people who 
say that we are antagonistic 
to the government. I al- 
most feel like quoting the words 
of President Angus M. Cannon, 
who said once, "the sooner some 
people went to hell the quicker they 
. would get out," and I don't know 
but that is about true. 

It is our business to go into all 
nations of the earth and tell man- 
kind what God has wrought, what 
He has set His hand to do in the 
dispensation of the fullness of times 
that the Priesthood has been re- 
stored, that the last dispensation 
has been ushered in, that the 
Church has been organized. The 
words of the angel to the boy, the 
farmer's lad, have come true, not- 
withstanding he was told that he 
would never be known outside of 
the county where he lived, yet today 
there is not a civilized nation upon 
the face of the earth where the 
name of Joseph Smith is not had 
for good and for evil. There is no 
other thing, no other work, that 
has been a fulfiller of so many pre- 
dictions of the Almighty as this 



work. -In our day, in every nation 
upon the earth, there are people 
saying, "Let us go up to the moun- 
tain of the Lord, to the house of the 
God of Jacob, where we can learn 
of His ways and walk in His 
paths;" and this has been brought 
to pass by the restoration of the 
Gospel of the Lord Jesus Chrisf 
upon the earth in this dispensation. 
It is true that the enemy said to 
our fathers and our mothers, "Get 
ye up into the mountains," and 
they got; and they are fulfilling 
one of the mightiest revelations 
of God, by being driven here. 
Every time, as Brigham Young 
said, they kicked Mormonism, the^ 
kicked it uphill, never down hill. 

We acknowledge the hand of the 
Lord even in our persecution, but 
that does not justify the persecu- 
tors. It needs be that offenses 
come, but woe be unto them by 
whom they came. God did not 
compel them to do it ; they have got 
to pay the penalty. It was prob- 
ably ordained in some way that 
there should be a traitor in the 
days of the Messiah, but that does 
not take away from Judas the re- 
sponsibility, as an individual, or 
his punishment for betraying the 
Son of God. He has got to suffer 
the pangs of the condemned; and 
so will all persecutors suffer the 
pangs of the condemned, until the 
justice of Almighty God shall bt 
satisfied. It will not be a lake of 
fire, either; it will not be to be 
toasted upon coals of fire; it will 
not be having a horned devil there 
with a pitchfork turning them over 
as he roasts them upon coals of 
fire. Here we are mortal, with 
mortal faculties. We commit sin, 
and we suffer the pangs of the re- 
morse of conscience, but after a 
while it passes away, and we forget 
it, because we are mortal, and then 



42 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



we go on sinning more and more, 
and we continue to forget it. But 
I want to say to you that when we 
are resurrected from the dead we 
will not come up mortal. Every 
faculty of our being will be immor- 
tal, and we will bring forth with 
us a remembrance of everything 
that we have not atoned for, and 
we cannot forget it. We will there 
suffer remorse of conscience untii 
we have paid the uttermost farth- 
ing ; and I don't know but that will 
be worse than coals of fire. 

I bear testimony that Joseph F. 
Smith is a prophet of God. I warn 
to bear testimony that no man can 
be untrue to that man and still re- 
ceive blessings from God the Eter- 
nal Father. I say it is your duty 
to be loyal and true. His friends 
are your friends, his enemies are 
your enemies. You should teach it 
to your children and your children's 
children, from generation to gener- 
ation, that the man who may 
be at the head of this Church, no 
matter what his name is, no mat- 
ter who he may be, his friends are 
your friends, his enemies are youi 
enemies, and what mankind would 
like to do to him they have it in 
their hearts to do to you. 

I remember in the missionary 
field that I had a portrait of an in- 
dividual who was not a religious 
man, not by any means. Probably 
he did not do at all times what he 
ought to have done, but I have writ- 
ten beneath his picture the words, 
"Fprter Rockwell, the Prophet's 
Friend." He was indeed the friend 
of the Prophet ; a devoted protector 
of the head of the Church. He 
would have, laid down his life in de- 
fense of the man who stood at the 
head of the Church, and he is re- 
membered today for his loyalty, 
and his love for those whom God 
had placed at the head and his de- 



votion will be remembered in his 
favor on the books above. While 
he may have to pay the uttermost 
farthing for sins he committed, 1 
want to tell you on the other page 
of that book he has received a cred- 
it for loyalty that will stand in his 
favor throughout the countless ages 
of eternity. I think we should let 
the world know that, to a man we 
are willing to surround our presi- 
dent and protect him. That we 
look upon his enemies as our en- 
emies, and that we will defend him 
with our lives if necessary. 

I rejoice in the testimony that 
God has given me concerning this 
work, and feel for myself, and 
know, it is true, and I want to re- 
main true to it. I bear my testi- 
mony to you that the men at the 
head of this Church are prophet ; 
of God and I want my testimony- 
recorded for or against me, be- 
cause I give it as knowledge, and I 
bear it in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 



ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS. 

Divine inspiration manifest in discovery 
of this land, and establishment of its 
government.— Saints should live up to 
the light and knowledge they have re- 
ceived. — Good works the only sure ev- 
idence of faith. — Church members 
blessed with wise, faithful, and dili- 
gent teachers. 

I bear you my testimony, my 
brethren and sisters, that the words 
that have been spoken to you this 
afternoon are the truths of heaven, 
inspired of the Lord, and I admon- 
ish vou to remember them, and put 
them into practice. 

The Lord revealed, many cen- 
turies ago, to one of His Prophets, 
Nephi, that His people who inhabit- 
ed this country, North and South 



ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS. 



43 



America, should be destroyed, leav- 
ing but a remnant of the seed of his 
wicked brethren, on whom rested 
the curse of blackness, that this 
country should be lost to the knowl- 
edge of the eastern world, and that 
He would inspire one who should 
journey upon the waters and dis- 
cover this promised land. And so 
we believe, emphatically, that the 
discovery of America by Christo- 
pher Columbus is a direct fulfilment 
of the prediction of the Lord, and 
that it is a part of His great plan, 
as has been stated, in preparing for 
the restoration of the everlasting 
gospel in these last days. He not 
only inspired Columbus to discover 
America, but He also inspired men 
to establish this great government, 
whose principles are as liberal as 
the principles of the gospel of the 
Lord Jesus Christ, yielding obedi- 
ence to which will make men and 
women free indeed. We under- 
stand that not only did the Lord in- 
spire the declaration of independ- 
ence and the constitution of this 
great country of ours, but by His 
power He has enabled the people 
thus far to maintain independence, 
and liberty of faith, under the con- 
stitution of these United States. We 
Latter-day Saints are presumptuous 
enough to believe that we as a peo- 
ple, though but few in number com- 
pared with the population of these 
United States, are the "IT," if I 
may use that expression; though 
limited, our numbers help to make 
up this great commonwealth. By 
and by from the center of Zion, the 
word of the Lord is to go out, not 
only to this nation, but also into all 
the nations of the earth, until every 
nation, kindred, tongue and people 
shall have the opportunity to enjoy 
the same blessing's that we enjoy to- 
day through the gospel of our Mas- 



ter. This is the great land of pron- 
lse in which we live. I thank the 
Lord for the liberty implanted in 
this great country of ours. I thank 
the Lord, too, for the liberty which 
our people find in other nations 
where they are located. There is a 
spirit of toleration and liberality 
with the heads of other nations 
where our people have colonized. 
I acknowledge the hand of the Lord 
in all these civil blessings for our 
people, as well as other spiritual 
and temporal blessings that are so 
bounteously poured out upon us. 

I was thinking while the breth- 
ren were speaking, of that passage 
of scripture beginning with the 11th 
verse of the 4th chapter of Ephe- 
sians, which tells how the Lord 
gave to His primitive Church cer- 
tain officers, "Apostles, Prophets, 
Evangelists, Pastors, Teachers," 
etc., for certain specific purposes, 
for the work of the ministry, the 
perfecting of the Saints, the edify- 
ing of the body of Christ, till they 
should all come into a unity of faith 
and a knowledge of the Son of God. 
So in these days He has organized 
His church in perfection, giving un- 
to us all the officers that were had 
in the primitive church, and many 
auxiliaries as helps in government ; 
and these people, the Latter-day 
Saints, are well taught. Indeed, if 
we were now living up to the light 
and knowledge that has come to us, 
our light would shine out in the na- 
tions, they would behold the power 
of God manifest among us, and see 
a people who would delight in 
works of righteousness, and who 
would eschew all evil. Had we lived 
fully up to this light the evils that 
have come to some of us through 
strong drink, and other evils, would 
have been averted. For instance, 
the sickness, weakened constitu- 



44 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



tions, and premature deaths result- 
ing from' the use of tobacco would 
have been prevented. This work 
would have rolled on more rapidly, 
because the timings of the people 
would have been paid as the Lord 
designed. As a result of complete 
compliance with that law, the bless- 
ing and favor of heaven would have 
been more abundantly poured out 
upon us, and the earth would have 
been blessed for our sakes to bring 
forth more than it has. 

I acknowledge the faithfulness of 
the people generally. The Lord 
has acknowledged their faithful- 
ness, and He has manifested His 
appreciation of what we have done, 
and has favored us by pouring out 
many blessings upon us ; certain- 
ly we have been greatly blessed of 
the Lord. But I do feel that as 
a people we have need of being 
impressed with the importance and 
necessity of doing as well as we 
know how, as well as we have 
been taught. That we are well 
taught there is no question. We 
know what we should do, and we 
know what we should not do. We 
are not only required to do and to 
labor, but we are commanded to 
abstain from doing certain things 
which are evil, demoralizing, de- 
grading, and unbecoming honest, 
honorable men and women. Indeed, 
the gospel of the Master is one of 
self-denial and self-sacrifice ; it re- 
quires faith to enable men and wom- 
en to make the sacrifices required, 
and to deny themselves the things 
which are forbidden by the gospel. 
Just as we were told by one of the 
speakers this afternoon, it may be 
an easy matter for people of some 
denominations to live" up to the re- 
quirements of their churches and 
creeds, but with the Latter-day 
Saints there is a continued warfare 



through life, denying one's self the 
things which his nature craves, and 
making sacrifice day after day; it 
requires faith to enable us to do 
these things and to continue to the 
end. We cannot hope to be able to 
succeed, and come off victorious in 
the end, only through faith in God 
and the help that He will give us 
through faith. If I do not pay my 
tithing, what reasons have I to as- 
sign for not doing so ? I can think 
of no other reason than that I have 
not faith sufficient to do it. If I 
could make myself believe that God 
has spoken from the heavens, that it 
was He who gave that revelation 
which says that one-tenth of my in- 
terest annually should be given to 
the Church for the building up of 
the kingdom, if I could believe in 
my heart and soul, even as if God 
came and told me that it is His will 
I should do so, I think I would have 
no further trouble. The difficulty is, 
if I do not yield obedience to that 
law, I manifest that I do not believe 
the law. I try to make myself im- 
agine that I believe it, but in this I 
deceive myself. What did the Apos- 
tle James say? "Lay apart all filthi- 
ness and superfluity of naughtiness 
and receive with meekness the en- 
grafted word, which is able to save 
your souls, but be ye doers of the 
word, not hearers only, deceiving 
yourselves." So, I feel that some of 
us Latter-day Saints are actually 
deceiving ourselves, trying to make 
ourselves believe that our faith is 
perfect in the law of God, and at the 
same time it does not produce that 
result which the Lord desires. 

We have need, my brethren and 
sisters, to increase our faith in the 
Lord; and so these officers are 
placed to teach us faith in God, and 
in Jesus Christ as the Redeemer of 
the world, and faith in the Holy

Ghost as one of the trinity of the 
Godhead, whose influence fills the 
immensity of space, the medium of 
communication between the Father 
and His children. Those who have 
spoken to you today are laboring 
for this end. You have heard two 
presidents of missions of the United 
States, and two local presidents, one 
presiding over an important stake 
of Zion, and another over a popu- 
lous ward. You have heard their 
pleading, and their teachings. Such 
are the teachings of other servants 
of the Lord, who can be counted by 
the thousands. Thus we are teach- 
ing the Latter-day Saints, and 
teaching the world ; and we propose 
to continue to teach and labor in 
loving kindness and persuasion, to 
bring men and women to that per- 
fect faith in the Lord which will se- 
cure them eternal lives, by their 
yielding obedience to the laws and 
requirements of the gospel. 

God bless you, my brethren and 
sisters. May His favor be upon us. 
May we be able to understand His 
will, and with all our souls, with all 
our might, mind and strength, serve 
Him, making the required sacri- 
fices that we may obtain eternal life, 
is the humble prayer of your fellow 
servant, in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen.* 

The choir sang the hymn, "On- 
ward, Christian soldiers." 

Benediction was pronounced by 
Elder Daniel G. Miller.

ELDER NEPHI PRATT. 

(President of Northwestern States Mis- 
sion.) 

My brethren and sisters, I ap- 
preciate the privilege of being at 
home among the Saints of God, 
and listening to the inspired teach- 
ings of the Presidency and other 
Elders of the Church. The speak- 
ers are here this afternoon by ap- 
pointment of the prophet of the 
Lord. We are few in number, but 
the Lord has said that He will be 
even with, three or four, when the} 
come together in His name. I hope 
that you will pray that I may be 
inspired by the Spirit, that we may 
be blessed together, and the hearts 
of those who are assembled here 
be comforted, their faith increased, 
and they be instructed. 

I praise the Lord for the inspira 
tion in the remarks of my brethren 
who have spoken in this conference. 
I love the sound of their voices. 
I am laboring away off, 800 mile.5 
from here, in a missionary field, 
and I rarely have, except upon spec- 
ial occasions, as great an audience 
as is here assembled; and you may 
imagine the great pleasure and hap- 
piness it gives me to mingle with 
the Saints in Zion. God has blessed 
this country. This is the land to 
which the Lord inspired His ser- 
cants to gather the hosts who have 
from time to time met in our great 
conferences. The site for the tern- 



46 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



pie of the Lord and the place for 
its chief cornerstone, was pointed 
out by revelation. I have been with 
this Church,- in Salt Lake Valley, 
except when I have been traveling 
on missions, from the time I was 
a year and a half old. I have seen 
the growth of this people, and the 
greatness of their character. When 
we first worshiped the Lord on 
this block, under the old Bowery, 
the theme of the prophets and 
saints in that day was that God had 
sanctified and blessed this land, re- 
served it on purpose, and kept it 
for this people. The prophetic vis- 
ion of our leaders then looked for- 
ward to the time when great build- 
ings would grace the Temple block. 
When log houses were builded by 
the pioneers around Pioneer 
Square, which was* at that time 
called the Old Fort, I was a small 
child, but I know the spirit that 
possessed the people. I want to 
tell the Saints who are gathered 
here that when our pioneers look 
ed upon that ten-acre block, enclos- 
ing log houses shingled with stra-w 
and mud, they beheld, with pro- 
phetic eye, those cabins merge into 
palaces of beauty. And when they 
worshiped God under the crude 
shelter which they had builded, 
they thought of the Temple of the 
Lord, and the Tabernacles that 
would sometime be builded on this 
block. They felt that the poverty 
of those years would some day 
change into riches. You are my 
witnesses, who walk the streets of 
our beautiful city, that the Lord 
did not inspire our fathers with any 
false hopes, but has fulfilled to the 
letter all predictions that were made 
through His servants, and many 
times made them greater than they 
were spoken. 

It is a great and magnificent day 
in which we live; and among Ua 



everywhere, are evidences of tlv; 
greatness that the Gospel brings to 
those who live it. So far as any- 
thing that I have ever read in his- 
tory says, there never was as great 
a body of Priesthood on the face of 
the earth, living the Gospel laws to 
as great an extent, as there is today 
gathered here on the tops of the 
mountains, exalted, as Isaiah said, 
above the hills. The people of 
many nations have flown unto us. 
The desert has blossomed as the 
rose. Harmony, joy, gladness, and 
thanksgiving are here, as Isaiah 
predicted, and the voice of melody, 
which is evidenced by the great 
Eisteddfod that has recently been 
held here, and by the great choirs 
that sing in our places of worship, 
— and the Elders see eye to eye, all 
of which the Lord promised should 
be, when the Lord should bring 
again Zion. 

I want to stand among this peo - 
pie, a humble member of the 
Church of Christ, sanctified and 
blessed by a good course of con- 
duct. My destiny is in my own 
hands. If I ascend into the para- 
dise of God when my spirit departs 
from this tabernacle, and in peace 
and happiness reside with the Pio- 
neers who laidthe foundation of this 
splendid commonwelth, it will be be- 
cause I have received of the same 
Spirit, humbled myself before God, 
purified myself by repenting of 
that that I have done wrong. It 
will b* because I have worked and 
studied to make myself yield to the 
will of God, because my house ha., 
been a house of prayer and thanks- 
giving, because my means and 
ability have been spent in the ser- 
vice of God, because I chose good 
instead of evil, because I curbed 
impure appetites, and subjugated 
myself to the good. Then I shah 
see Joseph Smith,who, under God's

direction, laid, the foundation of 
this work, when my spirit shall 
pass into the other world. I per- 
sonally knew President Brigham 
Young, and I associated with his 
children. President Young has held 
me on his knee when I was a child ; 
and he spoke consolingly to my 
mother in her widowhood, anc! 
sympathetically condoled the sor- 
row of our family when father was 
assassinated. When I pass from 
this world, I expect to meet Presi- 
dent Young, and be associated with 
other worthies who sustained the 
banner of truth and righteousness 
in the midst of a hostile world. 

If I go where darkness, and 
weeping, and wailing prevail, I 
shall never be able to accuse God 
our Father, or say to Kim, Father, 
why have you placed me in such 
sorrowful conditions, in outer dark- 
ness where there is weeping, and 
wailing and gnashing of teeth i 
Why, Father, have you given me 
evil companionship, and made my 
soul to dwell with those that are 
ungodly ? Why,the Lord might say, 
my son,, you only earned a place 
where there is outer darkness, and 
weeping and wailing and gnashing 
of teeth, and we have given you 
what you earned. You had your 
destiny in your own hands. Your 
brother that is across the chasm 
over which you cannot pass, who is 
in the association of prophets, 
priests and kings and with Jesus, 
blessed with eternal riches and eter- 
al life, is the recipient of what he 
has earned. You each had your 
agency. I gave you my precepts, 
laws, and commandments, and you 
exercised that agency. I shall not 
be able to blame my Heavenly Fa- 
ther if I stand condemned. 

My brothers and sisters, read the 
laws of the Gospel and lay them to 
heart. The prophet of the Lord 



God has spoken by revelation, and 
declared that hailstorms will de- 
stroy the crops. Do you think the 
saints shall escape famine wher 
that comes ? And there will be the 
grim reaper, death, coming to all 
the nations, in various forms that 
have been foretold. It has been 
Written that awful new diseases 
shall come, over which the physi- 
cans will have no power ; that flies 
shall come upon the wicked and eat 
their flesh, and that maggots shall 
come upon them, and devour them. 
But the revelation that was quoted 
in our hearing this morning holds 
out hope to us. When these aw- 
ful conditions which are coming 
shall predominate, and the judg- 
ments of God be poured out with- 
out stint, in that day the man who 
has kept the Word of Wisdom can 
say to the Lord, Father, you did 
promise that if I kept this word, 
the destroyer should pass me by, 
and the Lord will hear. Now let 
us heed these things, individually. 
I can preach them, but can I prac- 
tice them ? It is easy to talk ; it is 
harder to act. We should take up- 
on us the whole yoke of our Re- 
deemer, the whole armor of right 
eousness, and thus become free 
and sinless ; when we do that, our 
yoke will be easy, and our burdens 
light. Sin binds us and makes us 
fearful. A condition of apostasy 
will keep us from being heard by 
the Lord when we pray. Faith is 
lacking in our families, if the first 
thought is to call for physicians 
when we are afflicted instead of ap- 
pealing to the Lord. 

Now, my brethren and sisters, I 
desire to live these principles, and 
to live a life that shall please God. 
Before I pass away from the earth, 
I want to make amends for all my 
transgressions. I want to pay all 
the debts I owe to man and to ou. 



48 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Heavenly Father. I want to go 
free into the spirit world, and 1 
hope the Lord, when I have done 
my best, will open the way before 
me that I may not go into the spirit 
world among the ungodly, look- 
ing forward with fear to that whicii 
shall come in the judgment of God. 
I hope the Lord will approve my 
sacrifices and say, it is enough, let 
him go into the paradise of God 
with the saints. If I only can live 
worthy to obtain these things, 1 
will risk the rest. 

Brethren and sisters, may God 
bless you in His mercy, comfort 
you in your homes in the future 
have His hand ever extended to 
bless the Saints, save our children, 
and keep us for ever and ever hi 
His holy keeping, and save and ex- 
alt us in His kingdom, I ask it in 
the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

ELDER JOSEPH A. M'RAE. 

(President of Western States Mission.) 

I am pleased to have the op- 
portunity of meeting with 'you here 
this afternoon. There are but few 
of us present, but as I said to 
Brother Pratt before the begin- 
ning of this meeting, there have 
been many times in my life that 
I have spoken to smaller audiences 
than the one here today. I have 
seen smaller audiences in larger 
halls too, where we have gone to 
the expense of renting and invited 
the people to our meetings, done 
everything possible to get them to 
come and listen to the testimony 
of the Elders, and we have had but 



few present. I note that there are 
just eighty present now; and it is 
a coincidence that the most glorious 
meeting I ever attended in my life, 
was held with just eighty people 
That meeting continued five hour^ 
and a half, and I never attended 
in all my life a meeting where there 
was a more glorious outpouring of 
the Spirit of the Lord than was 
witnessed on that occasion. Some 
of the Elders, after the meeting 
was concluded, looked at their 
watches, and were surprised to as- 
certain we had been present five 
and a half hours, The reason that 
our meeting was marked by such 
an outpouring of the Spirit of the 
Lord, was that every individual 
present was living close to tht 
Lord ; and when we offered ou ,_ 
petitions unto Him that His Spirit 
should be in that meeting, He could 
not refuse to answer our prayer. 
I saw on that occasion stalwart 
men arise to bear their testimonies 
and they broke down and sobbed 
like children. Such an outpouring 
of the Spirit, I say, I never wit- 
nessed in my life before, nor do J 
expect to ever witness another 
greater. 

We who have assembled here 
this afternoon, have come for the 
purpose of having our hearts and 
souls satisfied with reference to 
the principles of the Gospel. Wt 
have come to be fed the bread of 
life, and listen to the inspiration of 
our Father given to His servants in 
the words that they shall utter. We 
have come for the purpose of re- 
ceiving a portion of the Spirit of 
the Lord, and although in the Tab- 
ernacle this afternoon thousands 
are gathered to hear the inspired 
words of the servants of God, there 
is no reason why our prayers as- 
cending to our Father shall not 



ELDER JOSEPH A. McRAE. 



result in us obtaining the same rich 
blessings. 

I have listened with interest this 
afternoon to the remarks that have 
been made by Brother Pratt, who 
has the privilege and blessing of 
presiding over one of the missions 
of the United States. I have listen- 
ed to the testimony he has borne 
respecting the integrity of the men 
and women who have stood fore- 
most in this Church, some of whom 
are standing there today. I have 
listened with interest to his recital 
of the conditions which prevailed 
in these valleys while he was a boy 
— conditions that we know nothing 
about, and by which, consequently, 
we will never be tried. Our trials 
will come in some other way. W". 
are surrounded today by all the 
luxuries that God can bless us 
with ; and the Lord has promised 
us, if we will keep His command- 
ments, that there is nothing the 
earth produces that shall not be 
ours. He has verified those words, 
and has blessed us with an abund- 
ance of this world's goods, includ- 
ing the beautiful buildings by 
which we are surrounded, in 
which we can meet from time to 
time. The two buildings upon the 
Temple block, in which are being 
held today meetings of the Saints, 
are filled to overflowing. We have 
assembled in another building, and 
if this was filled to overflow, there, 
are other buildings we could re- 
pair to, where meetings could be 
held, and the voice of the Lord, 
through His servants, could be 
heard by us. 

My experience, in the few years 
that I have lived, has taught me 
there is no safety, no genuine hap- 
piness, joy, nor pleasure comes to 
an individual except he be keeping 
the commandments of the Lord. 
There is no real joy nor happiness in 



the things of this world. I find men 
in my travels about the country 
who are undecided about the affairs 
of life, and who ridicule religion. 
I find other men who say there is 
something in religion, but "I can- 
not understand it ; it is all a mys- 
tery to me." In some instances, 
men's hearts are torn asunder, and 
their families are divided one 
against another, because they do 
not know God; they have not re- 
ceived His revelations; they hav;: 
not tasted of the inspiration that 
comes through the voice of His 
servants. They do not know what 
it means to kneel down and listen 
to the voice of the Spirit in an- 
swer to prayer. They do not realr 
ize what this means ; they cannot 
understand it as we do, therefore 
they are disrupted, torn asunder, 
dissatisfied, discontented, continual- 
ly complaining of this Church an ' 
that, and the doctrine that is 
taught. 

I sat in the Tabernacle this 
morning and listened to the inspir- 
ed words of President Smith wlit^ 
he arose in that congregation, an 1 
called the people to order, gave oui 
the hymn, and by virtue of his di- 
Vine calling took charge of that 
gathering, and I thought of anoth- 
er conference that I read of a short 
time ago, where a body of religious 
worshipers were gathered togeth- 
er. They have a man whom they 
sustain as the head of their church, 
and this man has two counselors. J 
thought of the beginning of their 
meeting, when the congregation 
was called to order bythe chairman, 
one of the members arose and said, 
"I move that it be the sense of this 
meeting that the present presidency 
of this church preside over this 
meeting." I thought when I read it, 
how devoid they are of the Spirit 
of God ; and I could not help but 



50 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



contrast what I had read with what 
I saw this morning. 

It is said that this is a most 
peculiar doctrine that we preach, a 
most peculiar religion that we 
have embraced. The fact is this is 
the religion of Jesus Christ, the 
Church that He established. That 
is the reason it is regarded as a 
peculiar religion. The burden of 
the message that was given to the 
Elders in the early history of this 
Church was, "Faith, repentance, 
and baptism by immersion for the 
remission of sins." A shor$ time 
ago I met upon the train a lady 
and gentleman, and they began to 
talk about Brigham Young. Thio 
lady had been to Utah. They were 
sitting j-ust opposite me, and I said, 
"Wait a minute before you go any 
farther with your conversation. I 
want to tell you that I am a Mormon 
Elder." This lady then said to me. 
"Tell me why it is that the people 
of Utah hold Brigham Young up 
as such a great man ?" I said : "My 
good lady, they have reason, 
they have cause, for it. If you 
would investigate the early history 
of Utah, if you could see the im- 
migrants who came from the work 
shops of Europe, if you could see 
those people who never knew what 
it was to own land of their own be- 
fore coming to the valleys of Utah, 
and saw the inspiration of that 
great man in planting those people 
in the various parts of this state, 
and then could see today the off- 
spring of those men and women, 
you, if you were candid, would 
never cease praising the name of 
Brigham Young. And yet," I said, 
"Brigham Young was not the one 
who did it, it was God, our Eternal 
Father. Brigham Young wa: 
merely His instrument in accomp- 
lishing this great pioneer work." I 



believe, after our conversation, she 
had a different idea and understand- 
ing of the work that Brigham 
Young has done. 

What has been the cause for thi^ 
people coming from the islands of 
the sea, and from the continent ot 
Europe, and establishing them- 
selves in these valleys? The pri- 
mary cause of it has been repent- 
ance from their sins, and baptism 
for the remission of those sins ; and 
without it they would not be here. 
Without it there would not be that 
bond of union that we see today, 
and there would be no Temples 
erected in these mountains. With- 
out it we would not be here to teli 
the story of our faith in God and 
in His Son Jesus Christ; and I 
say therefore, the fundamental 
principles we have to learn are, 
"First, faith in the Lord Jesus 
Christ, second repentance from our 
sins, third baptism by immersion 
for the remission of sins." 

Sometimes the Elders come to 
me and say: "We have preached 
faith, repentance and baptism for 
so long that this people know all 
about it." I say, "There is no 
theme you can teach that is of more 
importance to the Latter-day Saints 
than faith, repentance, and bap- 
tism." I believe we ought to be 
made to think of the first time we 
went down in the water and were 
baptized for the remission of our 
sins. One of our Elders remarked 
last night at our meeting here, 
"When an Elder of Israel arises to 
address a congregation, and asks 
for the interest of their faith and 
prayers, I wonder how many realize 
the importance of that request? I 
wonder how many say Heavenly 
Father, bless the speaker, that he 
may speak under Your influence." 
Now, I wonder how many of us 



ELDER JOSEPH A. McRAE. 



51 



recall the time of our baptism, im- 
mersion for the remission of sins, 
and remember the things connected 
therewith. I wonder how many of 
us review those things, and see if 
today we are much better. I wonder 
if we ask ourselves if there are 
things that we should repent of to- 
day. 

President Smith was moved upon 
this morning to read the Eighty- 
ninth section of the Doctrine and 
Covenants. You have read it many 
times, no doubt, that beautiful 
Word of Wisdom. He felt im- 
pressed to read that, and he called 
the people to repentance, and asked 
them to turn unto the Lord, for the 
Lord is mighty to save, He is 
merciful to us. He holds out His 
hand with charity towards us, and 
will save us if we will, as Brother 
Pratt has told us this afternoon, 
work for our salvation, work for 
our exaltation. 

I love this Gospel. I love the 
principles that have been revealed 
through Joseph Smith and the 
other prophets who have minister- 
ed unto us. I love my brethren and 
sisters who have embraced the Gos- 
pel of Jesus Christ. Sometimes 1 
hear Elders say in the mission field, 
"I have left every thing that was 
near and dear to me." I do not say 
that, because the people that I am 
sent to, those who are in darkness, 
who know not Jesus Christ, who 
know not the sound of His voice, 
who do not understand revelation, 
they are near and dear to me, for 
they are the children of my Father. 
I have been sent to preach the Gos- . 
pel to them, to bear my testimony 
to them; I have been sent to tell 
them that Joseph Smith was a 
prophet of God, and that the Book 
of Mormon is a divine record re- 
vealed by the Lord unto this gen- 
eration. This is what I have been 



sent for, to call them to repentance, 
just as President Smith felt called 
upon to call the people of Israel to 
repentance today, and ask them to 
turn unto Him, to turn unto the 
Lord and serve Him, and keep HL 
commandments. 

I know this work is true, as I 
know I live. I know that Joseph 
Smith is a prophet of the living 
God. I know that Brigham Young 
and all of Joseph Smith's succes- 
sors have been prophets of the 
Lord. I know that the Apostles 
who are today in our midst, who 
have been ordained Apostles of the 
Lord Jesus Christ, are men after 
God's own heart. I have asso- 
ciated with them. I have come in 
close contact with them, and I have 
enjoyed the privilege of meeting 
with thern in the temple in coun- 
cil with them, and I know the teach- 
ings they give are the teachings 
that have been inspired by our 
Father in Heaven. My brethren 
and sisters, let mc exhort you to 
listen to their counsel and teach- 
ings, to listen to the advice they 
give, and if they chide or admonish 
you, let me ask in all humility that 
you will receive that chastisement 
and counsel that they give in the 
spirit that it is given, and the Lord 
will bless us, and will pour out His 
Spirit upon you, and though 
your afflictions in this life may be 
great, you will have much to praise 
the Lord for. His Spirit will take 
possession of you, and it will make 
no difference whether we are but 
few, God will be with us, and He 
will bless us, and will pour out His 
Spirit upon us in abundance, and 
we shall come near to the Lord, and 
there shall be just a thin vail be- 
tween us and our Father, and when 
we kneel down and offer our pray- 
ers, we will hear the voice of the 
Spirit.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



May God bless those who have 
assembled here this afternoon, pom 
out upon them His Holy Spirit, 
cause them to reflect upon the first 
principles of the Gospel, and then 
go on from faith to faith until we 
shall know our Father in heaven as 
He knows us. When we kneel down 
at our bedside or around the fam- 
ily altar, and pour out our soul to 
our Father in heaven for blessings 
upon ourselves or upon our family, 
may our faith be such that those 
blessings will surely be realized 
upon our head, is my prayer in the 
name of Jesus. Amen. 



ELDER THOMAS B. EVANS. 

(President of Ogden Stake.) 

Brethren and sisters : I have very 
much enjoyed the spirit of this meet- 
ing, as also the spirit of this morn- 
ing's session of |our Conference. 
When Brother Nephi Pratt stood 
before you, bearing his testimony 
of his knowledge- of the divinity 
of the work in which we arc en- 
gaged, it took my mind back to the 
time when I was about twelve o» 
thirteen years of age. Brother 
Pratt at that time was filling a mis- 
sion in Wales. He was a man that 
devoted his time and his talents to 
the spreading of the Gospel of Jesus 
Christ among the people of my 
country. He was an instrument in 
the hands of the Lord of bringing 
many to a knowledge of the truth. 
The people of that principality lov- 
ed Brother Piatt bf.cause of his 
faithfulness, because of his devotion 
to the cause of God. 

We have \ery much to be proud 
of, I believe ; we are indeed blessed 
above all other people upon the 
face of the earth ; and I sometimes 



question as to whether or not we 
appreciate the blessings that are 
conferred upon us. 

When President Joseph F. Smith 
was speaking to us this morning 
upon the Word of Wisdom, I wa;> 
reminded of the people known as 
ancient Israel. On either side of a 
valley two great armies were met. 
for the purpose of giving battle. 
One man, a giant, stepped forth, 
and issued his challenge, saying to 
the people who should have been 
serving God, "Send out a man that 
I may fight him." This he did for 
forty days, and none dared go out 
and fight that giant. A young man 
happened into the camp. He hac' 
been sent thither by his parents to 
take food to his brothers, who were 
serving in the army. He overheard 
Goliath issuing his defiance, and it 
came into his mind that someone 
ought to go and meet the giant. He 
proffered himself to do so. He was 
laughed at ; but he was ushered into 
the presence of the king. The king 
instructed his officers to put on this 
boy a coat of mail, and also give 
hjm a sword, and put upon his head 
a helmet. After attempting to walk 
in this new garb, this shepherd bo> 
David, said, "Nay, I cannot do any 
efficient work in this garb. I have 
not proved them." So he took off 
these garments, and put on his 
shepherd clothing, and he went out 
in the name of the Lord. He said 
that when he was attending his 
father's sheep, a lion and a bear 
came, but God made him equal to 
the occasion of destroying theso* 
wild beasts, and he now felt quite 
sure that his Maker would make 
him equal to destroying this man 
who defied the armies of the living 
God. Brethren and sisters, there 
are no Goliaths today, there are no 
giants that we may fight, but the 



ELDER JOSEPH S. WELLS, 



53 



spirit of Goliath ie among us, and 
we ought to arm ourselves with a 
view of fighting that spirit which 
crops out in the saloons and in the 
electric theaters, baseball parks, and 
other places of amusement which 
are thrown open on the Sabbath 
day, enticing our young men and 
young women to go there and thus 
forget to serve their Maker. Broth- 
ers and sisters, let us put on the 
armor of righteousness. Let us 
go forth and defy these vile ele- 
ments. Let us, in the name of the 
Lord, go forth and fight this 
spirit of Goliath, in order that our 
young people may be established be- 
yond question in the paths which 
lead back to the presence of our 
God. 

May God bless us and make us 
equal to this great work which 'is 
before us, that of saving souls, my 
brethren and sisters, I ask, in the 
name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER JOSEPH S. WELLS. 

(Of the Presidency of Ensign Stake.) 

Brethren and sisters : I have felt 
very much edified and instructed, as 
I am sure all of vou have, in listen- 
ing to the testimonies that have been 
borne by the brethren who have 
spoken this afternoon. It is a great 
blessing to be identified with the 
Church of Christ, and to have a tes- 
timony that the principles which we 
advocate, which we have embraced, 
are the principles of truth, calcu- 
lated to save all of God's children. 
We are fighting in the world today 
for the principles of truth and 
righteousness, and it is a great 
blessing to us to be able to bear tes- 
timony, to bear witness, that God 
lives, and that He has restored His 



Gospel again to earth ; and we have 
the privilege of bearing it to the 
world of mankind who lie in dark- 
ness ; and it makes no difference un- 
to us, who have this testimony, how 
the world may fight against it. They 
cannot stay the arm of God. They 
cannot prevent Him from' accom- 
plishing His purposes. And we 
know that the principles of truth 
have been restored again for the 
last time ; that they are not to be 
given to another people, but that in 
fulfillment of the prophecies of old, 
the Kingdom of God shall be estab- 
lished in the last days, never more 
to be thrown down. 

We can look back upon the his- 
tory of this people from the time of 
the organization of the Church,and, 
notwithstanding all of the trials and 
persecutions, and mobbings, and 
drivings that our people have had 
to go through, the Church today is 
stronger in numbers, in property, in 
material growth and wealth, than it 
has ever been before, although the 
prophet of God who was His in- 
strument in restoring the princi- 
ples of truth aeain to the earth, was 
martyred. The world thought that 
his death would be the end of "Mor- 
monism." but could it kill the testi- 
mony that had been declared by 
these prophets of God? No. While 
the people were called upon to leave 
their homes and their property, and 
were driven to these valleys of the 
mountains, God was with them, the 
principles of truth were still being 
preached in the nations of the earth, 
and the honest in heart were being 
brought to a knowledge of the 
orincioles of the Gospel. Honest- 
hearted men and women embraced 
the gospel and gathered to these 
vallevs of the mountains, in great 
numbers. The progress of 



54 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Church has not been stayed. Our 
enemies have not ceased to worry 
us, to persecute us, to falsify 
against us in all this time ; but not- 
withstanding all of this, the work 
of God is growing and increasing in 
the earth. There are more mission- 
aries in the field today than ever be- 
fore, and the true Gospel is being 
preached by them to every nation, 
kindred, tongue and people, as a 
witness unto all nations. It is a 
pleasure to those who bear the 
priesthood of God to fulfill this mis- 
sion which God has given unto us 
as the army of Christ, to spread the 
truth in these latter days. 

I am glad to be able today to join 
with the other brethren in 
bearing testimony of the truth 
of this work. God has given 
me a testimony that Joseph Smith 
was a prophet of God, His humble 
instrument in restoring the Gospel 
again to the nations of the earth ; 
that Brigham Young, whom I 
was acquainted with in my boyhood 
days, was his legal successor; and 
that all of those who have followed 
him are men of God, chosen by rev- 
elation and inspiration, to guide and 
direct the Church of Christ in this 
day and age. May God bless them, 
and bless all of the Elders who are 
proclaiming His word, who are de- 
fending the truth, who are living 
the lives of Latter-day Saints; and 
may He bless all of the people who 
have named His name, and who 
have taken upon themselves cove- 
nants to keep His commandments, 
is my prayer, in the name of Jesus. 
Amen. 

The congregation sang the hymn, 
"We thank Thee, O God, for a 
Prophet." 

Benediction was pronounced by 
Elder John M. Knight. 



AFTERNOON SESSION. 

Conference was resumed at 2 p. 
m., in the Tabernacle. 

President Joseph F. Smith called 
the congregation to order. 

The choir sang the anthem 1 , "Un- 
fold ye portals everlasting." 

Prayer was offered -by Elder 
David H. Cannon. 

The choir sang the anthem, "God 
of Israel ;" the solos and quartet 
were rendered by Lizzie T. Ed- 
ward, Edna Dwyer, John W. Sum- 
merhays and John Robinson. 

PRESIDENT FRANCIS M. LYMAN. 

The Saints always under laws of Tem- 
perance and Prohibition. — Should sus- 
tain present world-wide agitation 
against liquor traffic. — Valuable sug- 
gestion for Sabbath day observance. — 
The Saints should be examples of 
righteousness. 

It is a very great undertaking for 
many of the brethren to speak to so 
large a congregation, and I think it 
will be very proper for all Latter- 
day Saints present, as the brethren 
arise to speak, to ask the Lord to 
bless them', so that they may speak 
with the Spirit and with under- 
standing. 

I am sure we were all greatly 
pleased this morning in listening to 
President Smith and his counselors, 
for the good Spirit was abundantly 
with them and with the congrega- 
tion, and I trust the same may be 
true this afternoon. We all endorse 
most heartily the word of the Lord 
so beautifully given to us this morn- 
ing in regard to the Word of Wis- 
dom, the law which prohibits the 
use of intoxicating liquors of all 
kinds. The most of us have lived 
under this law for a long time ; and 
when the temperance movement 



PRESIDENT FRANCIS M. LYMAN. 



55 



was inaugurated by the world, look- 
ing to this important reformation 
among men, it was not a surprise to 
the Latter-day Saints ; for we live 
under the law of the Gospel, which 
is the law of prohibition so far as 
strong drinks.tea, coffee and tobacco 
are concerned ; and the same law re- 
quires also the very moderate and 
wise use of meats. It behooves the 
Latter-day Saints to order their 
lives in harmony with this law, 
which we heard read here today, for 
it is a very important law. I re- 
member so distinctly, and, no doubt, 
many in this congregation remem- 
ber the same, when President Brig- 
ham Young, speaking as the mouth- 
piece of God, announced, from this 
stand, that from that time forth the 
Word of Wisdom was a command- 
ment, binding upon all Latter-day 
Saints. 

I have no doubt but from that 
time, as well as before, very many 
of the Latter-day Saints have un- 
dertaken to observe this law, but 
some of us, no doubt, have excused 
ourselves because it was not given 
in the beginning by way of com- 
mandment or constraint, but by rev- 
elation, a "word of wisdom," with 
promise of very particular and im- 
portant blessings — the blessing of 
health, and wisdom and knowledge. 
We have been striving to live that 
law, and we have labored unceas- 
ingly, especially with our leading 
brethren, in all the stakes of Zion 
and in the various mission fields, to 
train the Latter-day Saints in this 
law of temperance and wisdom, 
given for our temporal salvation. 
Compliance with it on the part of 
the members of the Church would 
not only be a great blessing to them 
physically, but it would have a re- 
markably beneficial effect upon their 
financial condition, for the means 



expended for liquor, tobacco, tea, 
and coffee, go out of the country, 
as these articles are generally im- 
ported, and the people are impover- 
ished to the extent that they use 
them. So it is with meats, which 
the Lord says, should be used spar- 
ingly, and in times of excessive cold 
and hunger. If the meats that are 
so extravagantly expensive in our 
day, could be partially dispensed 
with, and if we could dispense with 
all the tea, coffee, tobacco and 
strong drinks that are used — if all 
the Latter-day Saints would do 
without these things entirely, it 
would conduce to their becoming a 
wealthy people ; for the means thus 
saved would be kept at home. It is 
upon this principle that we are now 
producing in our state all the sugar 
that is used in the state, as well as 
all the sugar being used in the state 
of Idaho ; and I presume the same 
is true of Colorado. We produce 
our own sugar, and at the same 
time give employment to the peo- 
ple, thus keeping the means at 
home. Then, we manufacture and 
provide for exportation as much 
more, which is sent abroad, and the 
means therefor comes back into our 
state. This industry alone has ma- 
terially helped to put the State of 
Utah in splendid financial condition, 
but if the people would observe the 
Word of Wisdom, if the law of tem- 
perance were enforced and prohibi- 
tion obtained that would prohibit, 
the benefits to the community would 
be incalculable. 

It seems necessary to have laws 
of the land to confirm and assist the 
law of the Lord in prohibiting the 
use of strong drinks, and the world 
has been moved upon to make an ef- 
fort in that direction. This move- 
ment should find a ready response in 
the heart of every Latter-day Saint. 



56 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Those who bear the Priesthood es- 
pecially should second every move- 
ment of this kind and encourage and 
sustain it, at home and abroad ; for 
it means the temporal salvation of 
the people of our state and our na- 
tion, t here is no profit in drinking 
strong drinks, or tea or coffee ; and 
there is no profit in the use of to- 
bacco. There is profit in the barter 
and sale of these things. A great 
deal of money changes hands, and 
there is, no doubt, profit for those 
who barter and sell tea and coffee, 
liquors and tobacco. But there is no 
profit to the person who uses these 
things. No good comes to those 
who use these things, but very seri- 
ous injury does come as a result of 
their use, and we become the slaves 
of our appetites. Now, we have 
been trying to correct, and the Lord 
desires that we should correct our 
appetites in this regard, and set an 
example before the people, so that 
the Latter-day Saints may be rec- 
ognized, among the children of men 
as remarkable for their temperance. 

I am sure the importance of this 
question is felt by my brethren — 
the Twelve, the presidents of stakes, 
*-He bishops of wards and their coun- 
se*ors, the high councilors, the pre- 
siding men in quorums and associa- 
tions. I am sure that, as a rule*, 
these brethren feel the importance 
of this burning question, and I trust 
that the brethren who have been do- 
ing about right in this regard will 
use their influence with others. 
There is quite an army of people 
who have been doing fairly well, 
but there is an army that needs 
reformation. We expect our people 
to fall in line with every movement 
and every action taken in our nation 
and among the peoples of the world 
for the salvation and redemption of 
men. We approve of all good that 



is being accomplished among the 
children of men. We sustain men 
that are workino- righteousness ; for 
there are many people who are as 
honest and conscientious as they can 
be. They have not entered into the 
light and received revelation from 
the Lord; but the world is full of 
truth. Mankind have been abund- 
antly furnished, by the Lord, with 
the spirit of truth; and there are 
many men of principle, and women 
also. I believe that the great ma- 
jority of all the children of men are 
good, conscientious and honest. I 
have that faith in human nature. 
There are men, of course, who are 
wicked, and there are women who 
are wicked, and there will always be, 
no doubt, so long as men live in the 
flesh, in a fallen condition ; but there 
is goodness in the world ; purity and 
righteousness among men. We rec- 
ognize such people ; and their splen- 
did conduct, their good lives, their 
good principles, and their honor in 
business, we approve and appreci- 
ate, and - we love to live among 
them. We love to be associated with 
men of honor, men of honesty, men 
of sobrietv, men of truth, men who 
love righteousness ; and we hold out 
to such men the hand of fellow- 
ship in the truth ; we love them and 
feel to bless them. 

We call all men to repentance. 
The mission of the Latter-day 
Saints is to call all men, every- 
where, to repentance. The Gospel 
is being preached among the nations 
of the earth ; and as we call men to 
repentance in the nations of the 
earth, so we call upon all Latter-day- 
Saints in this mountain region, in 
the land of Zion, or among the peo- 
ple of the world, as we, do upon our- 
selves, to repent of sins, follies and 
weaknesses, that we may serve the 
Lord the remainder of our mortal

lives. It is an important matter that 
we should be in, the service of God 
while we live in the flesh, for the 
Lord has so ordered that if we will 
receive the truth, receive the light, 
listen to His counsels and enjoy His 
Spirit while we live in the flesh, we 
shall be freed from the power of 
Satan ; he will have no power or in- 
fluence over us ; for whom we list 
to obey in this probation of ours, to 
him we will be servants in the world 
to come — either the servants of 
righteousness or the servants of Sa- 
tan and darkness. We ought to be 
very anxious, my brethren and sis- 
ters, to do what is right, to serve the 
Lord, and to keep His command- 
ments, so that when we are in need 
we may be worthy to ask and re- 
ceive of the Father. 

In addition to what we have said 
upon the subject of temperance and 
the Word of Wisdom, I want to say 
a few words in regard to the Sab- 
bath day. Latterly, I have felt very 
much impressed with the impor- 
tance and sacredness of the Sabbath 
day among the Latter-day Saints, 
and the necessity of our advocating 
the keemnsr of the Sabbath day holy. 
On that day we should refrain from 
all labor, from all secular and im- 
proper pleasures, and spend the day 
in the service and worship of the 
Lord. Efforts have been made in 
numbers of cases to bring this mat- 
ter before the presiding brethren 
and sisters in the various stakes of 
Zion, to try to bring them not only 
to observe the Word of Wisdom 
and the law of tithing, not only to 
meet together and partake of the 
Sacrament, but to make the legiti- 
mate and orooer use of the Sabbath 
day. I believe I have discovered a 
thought that is worthy of our con- 
sideration in this regard. The Lord 
commands that we should keep the 



Sabbath day holy, that during six 
days we should do all our labor, and 
rest on the Sabbath day; for the 
Lord hallowed the Sabbath day; it 
is His day, and we are expected to 
honor it and to keep it holy. Then, 
the question is, how shall we keep 
the Sabbath holy? We have pro- 
vided Sunday Schools for the morn- 
ing, and we have also provided for 
classes of Seventies, on the Sabbath 
morning, that our foreign ministry 
may be thoroughly trained and pre- 
pared for their work abroad. We 
have provided for the Sacrament in 
the after part of the day, either in 
the afternoon or evening, in all the 
wards of Zion, and quite a percent- 
age of the people attend these meet- 
ings. However, those who attend 
the Sabbath schools sometimes ex- 
cuse themselves from attending the 
afternoon meetings, and those who 
attend the Sabbath schools or after- 
noon meetings sometimes excuse 
themselves from meeting with the 
young people in the evening. But, 
what shall we do with all the Sab- 
bath day? How shall it be occu- 
pied? This thought has taken pos- 
session of m'y mind. You will re^- 
member that the Lord has required 
that parents in Zion, who have chil- 
dren, should teach them faith in the 
Lord Jesus Christ, the doctrine of 
repentance, and of baptism by im- 
mersion for the remission of sins, 
so that when they are eight years of 
age they shall receive that sacred 
ordinance of baptism and be 
brought into accountability under 
the law of the Lord. Parents are 
required, also, to teach their chil- 
dren to observe the Sabbath day and 
keep it holy ; and they are required, 
also, to teach their children to walk 
uprightly before the Lord. Now, 
we have organized in our midst, not 
only the quorums of the Priesthood, 



58 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



but we have the auxiliary associa- 
tions. We have the Relief Societies 
and the Young Ladies' Mutual Im- 
provement Associations for our sis- 
ters, the Young Men's Mutual Im- 
provement Associations for our breth- 
ren, the Sunday Schools, the Pri- 
maries, and the Religion Classes for 
our young folks — and all these or- 
ganizations have been established in 
our midst in order to perform just 
the very labor that is required of 
parents, in the way of teaching and 
training the children, that they may 
be prepared for their lives in this 
Church. Now, I wonder if the Lat- 
ter-day Saints haven't felt thankful 
that these associations have been es- 
tablished, and that they (the par- 
ents) have been so nicely relieved of 
teaching their children. The parents 
prepare their children for the Sun- 
day Schools, the Primaries, and the 
Religion classes, and send them' to 
these organizations, and I wonder if 
they do not then conclude that that 
is about all they need to do, and that 
their children will receive about all 
the religion, in these meetings, that 
they can take care of and live up to. 
I have felt that the Sabbath day 
should be utilized by the fathers and 
the mothers in their homes ; that af- 
ter the children have returned from 
their Sabbath schools, and after they 
have been suitably fed, as they 
should be on the Sabbath day and 
their food prepared, as ours has 
been, with singleness of heart— that 
the balance of the dav, instead of 
the children being turned adrift, in- 
stead of those half-grown being al- 
lowed to walk upon the hills and vis- 
it about, spending their time seek- 
ing worldly pleasures, instead of the 
young people spending their time 
going visiting and riding in car- 
riages, or young men fishing and 
hunting, or the like, making the day 



a time for pleasure and frolic and 
fun — I believe thatj;he Sabbath day 
should be occupied in our home 
temples, in home study, in home 
reading, in home prayer. The fath- 
ers and mothers will, perhaps, find 
themselves pretty well "stumped" at 
times to know just exactly how to 
handle the little ones ; but they must 
not be wearied; they must not be 
worn out and disgusted. I believe 
they will all enjoy singing the songs 
of Zion. This is what is desired by 
our brethren who are teaching little 
children. If Brother Stephens 
could have his way there would not 
be a child in the world who could 
not sing; he would have them all 
taught to sing and enjoy themselves 
in this way. They may be taught 
the songs of Zion; there may be 
some singing, some praying, some 
reading, and the time may be occu- 
pied wisely and well. I believe in 
fulfilling that requirement of the 
Lord, that parents in Zion, having 
children, shall teach them. Oh, what 
a glorious thing, if there could be a 
people such as the Latter-day Saints 
— a half million of them, possibly, in 
all the world — and in every home 
there could be given these Sabbath 
instructions, this home training, and 
home worship ; fathers and mothers 
teaching: their children these princi- 
ples, that their children may learn to 
love and reverence the Lord. We 
have six days in the week for school 
and for labor and for pleasure, for 
fishing, hunting, frolic and every- 
thing that is required ; and we want 
a great deal of that. We want all 
the six days for labor and for pleas- 
ure, but on the Sabbath day we 
should be occupied in the service 
and worship of the Lord, in every 
home. Fathers and mothers should 
see that their children observe this 
day ; but they should do it in such a 



PRESIDENT FRANCIS M. LYMAN. 



59 



manner that they will not offend 
their children, that their children 
shall not feel that they are too close- 
ly cared for. Make the singing, the 
instructions, the worship and the 
occupations of the Sabbath day a 
choice morsel to the children. Lit- 
tle boys and girls, if they are thus 
trained in their childhood, when 
they come to be fathers and mothers 
will walk right in the same path. 
They will say : That is the way fath- 
er did, and that is the way mother 
did ; we were so instructed when we 
were children. That is the home dis- 
cipline we want; and there should 
be prayers — morning, evening, and 
other times as well. Let the children 
be so trained that they understand 
there is no lying down at night un- 
til prayers are said ; and there is no 
such thing as going to work on the 
week days without we have com- 
mended ourselves to the Lord's 
keeping, thanking Him for what we 
enjoy, and asking His protection to 
be over us. And when we have done 
this, we are under the necessity of 
keeping His commandments. If we 
keep His commandments, we are 
then entitled to ask and we shall re- 
ceive, to knock and it shall be open- 
ed unto us ; and there shall not be 
anything, that we are entitled to en- 
joy as His children, but what the 
Lord will be delighted to bestow up- 
on us, and He will hear and answer 
our prayers. 

I feel, and have felt for some time 
the importance of this question, and 
so I recommend to all Latter-day 
Saints that they undertake this im- 
provement; and let us see if we 
can not, under the inspiration of the 
Lord, find just what is the best and 
wisest way to keep the Sabbath day 
holy. I believe if we will do this, 
we will receive great pleasure and 
satisfaction in that labor, and there 



will be great pleasure to the chil- 
dren. The Spirit of the Lord will 
be with parents who thus labor, and 
the Spirit of the Lord will be with 
children who are thus taught; for 
they will be so instructed and train- 
ed that when they are eight years 
of age they will be prepared and 
they will be anxious to go into the 
waters of baptism; and this matter 
will not be overlooked. We will re- 
member it, and they will remind us : 
We are eight years of age, the boys 
and girls will say, and we want to 
be baptized ; we want to be Latter- 
day Saints, so we can partake of the 
Sacrament in our own right, and so 
that we may have our sins forgiven 
us. Thus great good will be accom- 
plished, and our children will be 
saved ; we will be able to restrain 
them and withhold them from sin ; 
they will listen to our counsel, and 
Satan will not have power over 
them. I believe that we have not 
done our duty fully in this regard ; 
I am satisfied that I have not, and 
it may be true of others ; yet, there 
may be many Latter-day Saints who 
have done their full duty. If they 
have done their duty in the past, 
they will recognize and approve 
what I have said. If they have not 
done their full duty and feel a little 
reproved and condemned in their 
spirits, as I do, they may make ref- 
ormation for the future. 

I pray the Lord to bless us, that 
we may take hold of all these va- 
rious points and principles and doc- 
trines, and bring them to bear upon 
the whole measure of our life in the 
world today, for the Lord requires 
wonderful things of these Latter- 
day Saints. We have the preaching 
of the Gospel to the world, and we 
ought to go into the world spotless, 
for we are entitled to be spotless ; 
we have no reason for doing wrong, 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



no reason for indulging in anything 
that is forbidden, anything that 
would contaminate or corrupt us ; 
we should be free in this regard. 
We ought to be filled with the light 
and inspiration of the Lord, for we 
are entitled to enjoy that Spirit 
which the Lord gives with His work, 
and which bears testimony to the 
heart of every Latter-day Saint in 
every country. We are entitled to en- 
joy that spirit daily if we keep His 
commandments so that we can stand 
approved before him and before our 
own consciences. May God bless 
you, my brethren and sisters, and 
give us the light and inspiration of 
His Spirit, now and forever, and the 
seal of His Spirit upon the position 
and stand taken by our Presidency 
today, for I am sure that they have 
the full fellowship and support of 
all Latterday Saints in the doctrines 
they laid down for us this morning. 
God bless you, my dear brethren 
and sisters, in the name of Jesus. 
Amen.

Spiritual and financial advantages in 
obeying the Word of Wisdom. — Con- 
vincing arguments about temperance, 
quoted from "Leaves from the Diary 
of an old Lawyer," etc. — Resolution 
condemning saloons and favoring 
"Sunday Law." 

I am pleased to have the oppor- ' 
tunity of meeting with so many Lat- 
ter-day Saints, and I earnestly de- 
sire that the time I may occupy, this 
afternoon, may be spent for the mu- 
tual benefit of all of us who have as- 
sembled. I have been deeply inter- 
ested in all that has been said thus 



far in our conference, and I hope 
and pray that the words that were 
spoken here this morning and this 
afternoon, appealing to the Latter- 
day Saints to observe God's law, 
may find lodgment in the hearts of 
the people. Upon my return from 
Europe, and in traveling in some of 
the stakes of Zion, I made the re- 
mark that I believed the Latter-day 
Saints were becoming more careless 
many of them, in observing what is 
known among us as the Word of 
Wisdom. I regretted to see it, and 
in my public utterances from this 
stand, since my return home, and in 
the stakes of Zion, I have endeav- 
ored to urge upon them the neces- 
sity of returning to an observance of 
this law of God. I know there are 
many Latter-day Saints who feel 
that the breaking of the Word of 
Wisdom is a small affair, that it is 
a very slight matter to partake of a 
cup of tea or coffee, or to use tobac- 
co, or to occasionally take a drink 
of liquor, but I, for one, cannot be- 
lieve, and never have believed, that 
it is a slight affair for any man, 
woman, or child, to do that which 
God our heavenly Father has com- 
manded us not to do. From my in- 
vestigations, I believe, beyond a 
doubt, that the saving to this com- 
munity by the observing of the 
Word of Wisdom would be far 
more than the profits that are made 
todav by our great sugar factories in 
the State of Utah. When we stop 
to reflect upon the fact that we 
spend enough money, in breaking 
this commandment of God, to build 
about two factories every year, then 
we can realize the importance of 
what some people call an insignifi- 
cant matter. I rejoice, beyond meas- 
ure, to have the prophet of the Lord 
lay it down so forcefully to this 
people, under the inspiration of thp 



ELDER HEBER J. GRANT. 



61 



Spirit of God, telling us that it is in 
very deed our duty, an obligation 
from God Almighty resting upon 
us, to obey this command. I have 
heard some people say that many of 
those who preach upon the Word of 
Wisdom — one of whom I have al- 
ways been — are standing up so 
straight that they lean over back- 
wards. No man stands up any 
straighter than he ought to stand, 
by keeping the commandments of 
God and urging the people to do the 
same. 

Now, I have read, time and time 
again, as I have traveled through 
the stakes, some very strong and 
forceful arguments against the li- 
quor traffic. I have read the same 
thing here from this stand, but, like 
a good song, or like one of the rev- 
elations of the Lord that contains 
truth and instruction, a repetition 
will not hurt the people. Although 
I realize, as I stated the last time I 
read these same things from' this 
stand, that it is wearisome to an au- 
dience to listen to reading, yet at the 
risk of wearying this large audience 
by a repetition of what I have read 
here once before, I shall read it 
again, and I believe if the people 
will listen attentively and will mark 
carefully the wonderful items that 
are brought forth in that which I 
shall read, that it will be of more 
benefit, perchance, than anv remarks 
that I might make myself along the 
same line : 

From "Leaves from the Diary of 
an Old Lawyer :" 

"I believe that it will require the force 
of the whole people, men and women, ap- 
plied at the ballot box, to effectually blot 
out of existence the great curse to the 
country, 'The Laws that License and 
Permit the Sale of Alcohol as a Bever- 
age.' I deny the right of the govern- 
ment to sell to one citizen the privilege 
to tempt another to commit crime — " 



Incidentally, I wish to say I also 
deny the right, but I thank God that 
you and I have the right to stamp 
out this evil that is in our midst, if 
we determine to do it. 

"I doubt the policy of those laws that 
seek to raise a revenue by the sale of 
that which debases the people, is the pro- 
lific source of crime and pauperism, and 
costs the country annually a thousand 
times more than the revenue received 
therefrom. I deny the justice of those 
laws that on one page of the statute 
books legalize that which promotes crime 
and makes criminals, and on the next 
page provide severe penalties to be ad- 
ministered to those they have tempted to 
transgress. This little volume [and it is 
as large as the book I hold in my hand, 
exhibiting the large edition of the Book 
of Mormon] is presented to the public 
to promulgate these views. They may 
be thought radical, and perhaps are so ; 
but they are the result of long years of 
experience in our criminal courts, and 
are but a feeble expression of my abhor- 
rence of the vice of intemperance, and 
the laws that encourage and promote it. 

"Tell me I hate the bowl — 

Hate is a feeble word ; 
I loathe — abhor — my very soul 

With strong disgust is stirred 
Whene'er I see, or hear, or tell 
Of the dark beverage of hell."* 

"My experience at the bar has satis- 
fied me that intemperance is the direct 
cause of nearly all the crimes that are 
committed in our country. I have been 
at the bar over thirty years, have been 
engaged in over four thousand criminal 
cases, and on mature reflection I am sat- 
isfied that over three thousand of those 
cases have originated from drunkenness 
alone, and I believe that a great propor- 
tion of the remainder could be traced 
either directly or indirectly to this great 
source of crime. In sixty-three cases of 
homicide forty-nine have been caused by 
the maddening influence of strong 
drink." 

Think of one lawyer defending 
forty-nine cases of murder, all orig- 
inating from strong drink ! If there

had never been but one boy or one 
girl murdered, and only one boy had 
become a murderer, through the in- 
fluence of strong drink, then every 
father and every mother ought to 
rise up and determine that there 
shall never be another from the 
same cause if they had the power to 
prevent it — and we have the power, 
by legally putting down the saloons. 

"I have seen upon the counsel table of 
our court room the skull of an aged 
father who was killed by a drunken son. 
My brother and myself sat by his side as 
his counsel, and I never shall forget the 
look of that son when the ghastly evi- 
dence of his guilt was laid on the stand 
before him. That silent yet eloquent 
witness ! It was but an arch of bone, and 
was handled carelessly by the jury in 
their investigation, yet it had once been 
covered by a father's gray hairs, beneath 
it had throbbed a brain full of pride and

Go feel what I have felt — 
Go bear what I have borne — 

Sink 'neath the blow a father dealt, 
And the cold world's proud scorn ; 

Then suffer on from year to year — 

Thy sole relief the scorching tear. 

Go kneel as I have knelt, 
Implore, beseech, and pray — 

Strive the besotted heart to melt, 
The downward course to stay — 

Be dashed with bitter curse aside, 

Your prayers burlesqued, your tears de- 
fied. 

Go weep as I have wept 

O'er a loved father's fall — ■ 
See every promised blessing swept — 

Youth's sweetness turned to gall — 
Life's fading flowers strewed all the way, 
That brought me up to woman's day. 

Go see what I have seen — 

Behold the strong man bow, 
With gnashing teeth.lips bathed in blood, 

And cold and livid brow- 
Go catch his withering glance, and see 
There mirrored, his soul's misery. 

Go to thy mother's side, 

And her crushed bosom cheer — 

Thine own deep anguish hide — 

Wipe from her cheek the bitter tear; 



affection for the son who was now on his 
trial for murder, and as it passed from 
hand to hand the fearful expression on 
the face of the accused plainly told the 
terrible feeling of remorse that filled his 
soul. It was a wicked and most unna- 
tural crime, and begot feelings of loath- 
ing and horror in the breasts of all who 
witnessed the trial. Yet it was not in 
reality the son who had committed the 
crime, but the demon that lurks in every 
cup of strong drink. And that cup had 
been filled and placed to the lips of that 
son by the hand of a most respectable 
member of society — a man who had a li- 
cense from that very court to sell that 
which maddened the brain and prompted 
the hand to murder. 

"I saw upon the table the skull of 
young B — , who was killed by his most 
intimate friend in a drunken brawl at 
Hartstown, and the respectable propri- 
etor at whose hotel the murder was per- 
petrated, and who sold the maddening 
spirit that prompted the deed, was a wit- 
ness to the trial. He said he had a li- 



Mark her wan cheek and pallid brow — 
The gray that streaks her dark hair now, 
Her failing frame, and trembling limb; 

And trace the ruin back to him 
Whose plighted faith in early youth, 
Promised eternal love and truth, 
But who, foresworn, hath yielded up 
That promise to the cursed cup ; 

And led her down, through love and 
light, 

And all that made her prospects bright; 
And chained her there, 'mid want and 
strife, 

That lowly thing, a drunkard's wife ; 
And stamped on childhood's brow so 
mild, 

That withering blight, a drunkard's 
child ! 

Go hear, and feel, and see, and know, 
All that my soul hath felt and known ; 

Then look upon the wine-cup's glow — 
See if its beauty can atone — 

Think if its flavor you will try! 

When all proclaims, 'tis drink and die ! 

Tell me I hate the bowl — 

Hate is a feeble word ; 
I loathe — abhor — my very soul 

With strong disgust is stirred — 
Whene'er I see, or hear, or tell,

cense from that respectable court to sell 
liquor ; yes, from the very court then sit- 
ting in judgment on that act, which was 
but the natural sequence of the license it 
had sold and granted. 

"I have seen upon the table the skull 
of a little child, with the evidence upon 
it of a murderous blow, inflicted by the 
hand of a drunken mother. Yet it was 
not the mother who had committed the 
most unnatural crime. All our knowledge 
of the promptings of the human heart 
deny the charge. Who that remembers 
his own mother and her maternal love 
could believe it? No! a demoniacal 
spirit had violated the sanctuary of the 
mother's heart and cast out the tender, 
loving tenant that once resided there, 
and that was the spirit of strong drink, 
sold to the woman by a man who held a 
license to sell under the seal and sanction 
of that very court. 

"I have seen upon that table the blood- 
stained skull of a wife, cleft from top to 
base by an axe in the hand of a brutal, 
drunken husband, who came home from 
a neighboring licensed beer shop, reel- 
ing, drunken, and maddened by drink 
there sold by a most respectable dealer, 
by a man who had a legal right to sell 
that poison whose effects are more ter- 
rible than the plagues confined within the 
fabled box of Pandora, and under whose 
baneful influence 

" 'The hand that should shield the wife 
from ill, 

In drunken wrath is raised to kill.' 

"I once defended a man for killing his 
own brother, by whom, in a fit of drunk- 
en frenzy, he had been attacked with a 
dangerous weapon, thereby compelling 
him in his own defense, to strike a blow 
that had taken his brother's life. He 
was tried for murder, and in his defense 
I called the 'landlord' to prove that the 
murdered brother was mad from the ef- 
fects of the liquor he had received at the 
witness' bar. He so testified, yet seemed 
conscious of no wrong. Why should 
he? He had a license from the court, 
and why should that brother's blood 
cry to heaven for vengeance against 
him ? Oh, no ! he was a respectable citi- 
zen, possessing a good moral character, 
for the law grants licenses to none other! 
He had a legal right to present the mad- 
dening cup to his fellow's lips, and no 
one should complain of him. He had 



acted in accordance with the law, and did 
not one of England's greatest and best 
men say that 'the law was that science 
whose voice was the harmony of the 
world, and whose seat was the bosom of 
God?'" 

That ends the extracts from the 
"Leaves of an Old Lawyer." I now 
desire to read an advertisement is- 
sued by a saloon keeper, and cer- 
tainly nobody can complain if we 
give free advertising to those en- 
gaged in the saloon business by 
reading their own advertisements, 
for which they have spent their 
money. It is headed : 

"an honest saloon keeper. 

• "Tombstone, Arizona, claims credit for 
the frankest saloon keeper in the United 
States. He keeps the Temple Bar sa- 
loon, and advertises his business with 
moSt enterprising frankness: 'Allow 'me 
to inform you that you are fools,' he 
says, yet his place is usually filled. He 
maintains that he is an honest saloon 
keeper, and that it will not hurt his busi- 
ness to tell the truth about it. He has 
had printed an advertising card which 
would make an excellent manuscript for 
a temperance lecture. Copies are being 
circulated through the western states 
and are attracting attention. The card 
reads as follows : 

" 'Friends and Neighbors : I am grate- 
ful for past favors, and having supplied 
my store with a fine lot of choice wines 
and liquors, allow me to inform you 
that I shall continue to make drunkards, 
paupers and beggars for the sober, indus- 
trious, respectable, part of the commu- 
nity to support. My liquors will excite 
riot, robbery and bloodshed. They will 
diminish your comforts, increase your 
expenses, and shorten your life. I shall 
confidently recommend them as sure to 
multiply fatal accidents and incurable 
diseases. They will deprive some of life, 
others of reason, many of character, and 
all of peace. They will make fathers 
fiends, wives widows, children orphans, 
and all poor. I will train your sons in 
infidelity, dissipation, ignorance, lewd- 
ness and every other vice. I will cor- 
rupt the ministers of religion, obstruct

the gospel, defile the church, and cause as 
much temporal and eternal death as I 
can. I will thus accommodate the pub- 
lic. It may be at the loss of my never- 
dying soul, but I have a family to sup- 
port — the business pays, the public en- 
courages it. I have paid my license, and 
the traffic is lawful; and if I don't sell 
it somebody else will. [If we don't go 
to hell somebody else will.] I know the 
Bible says : Thou shalt not kill. No 
drunkard shall enter the kingdom of 
heaven, and I do not expect the drunk- 
ard-maker to fare any better, but I want 
an easy living, and I have resolved to 
gather the wages of iniquity and fatten 
on the ruin of my species. I shall, there- 
fore, carry on my business with every 
energy, and do my best to diminish the 
wealth of the nation and endanger the 
safety of the state. As my business flour- 
ishes in proportion to your sensuality 
and ignorance, I will do my best to pre- 
vent moral purity and intellectual 
growth. Should you doubt my ability, I 
refer you to the pawnshops, the poor- 
house, the police court, the hospital, the 
penitentiary and the gallows, where you 
will find many of my best customers have 
gone. A sight of them will convince you 
that I do what I say. Allow me to in- 
form you that you are fools, and that I 
am an honest saloon keeper.' " 

I wish to read a few words from 
a book written by David Starr Jor- 
dan, entitled "The Strength of Be- 
ing Clean." I believe that President 
Smith has paid this little book the 
tribute of saying that it is one of the 
strongest arguments yet produced 
or written by a non-Mormon in sup- 
port and vindication of the teach- 
ings of God, through the Prophet 
Joseph Smith, contained in the 
Word of Wisdom. (The speaker 
turned to President Smith, and then 
continued) : The President says that 
is true : 

"So far as the drink of the drunkards 
is 'concerned, prohibition does not pro- 
hibit. But to clean up a town, to free it 
from corrosion, saves men, and boys and 
girls, too, from vice, and who shall say 
that moral sanitation is not as much the 



duty of the community as physical san- 
itation. The city of the future will not 
permit the existence of slums and dives 
and tippling-houses. It will prohibit their 
existence for the same reason that it now 
prohibits pig-pens and dung-heaps and 
cesspools. For where all these things 
are, slums and cesspools, saloons and 
pig-pens, there the people grow weak 
and die." 

Now we, as Latter-day Saints, do 
not wish to. grow weak and die. We 
wish to grow in strength, in power, 
in ability, in the Spirit of Almighty 
God. We wish to grow in the pow- 
er to be clean and sweet in our lives ; 
we wish, in very deed, to so live that 
otfier men seeing our good deeds 
shall glorify God and be ready to 
investigate the truth. 

I indorse, with all my heart, the 
teachings of the Presidency of the 
Church and the teachings of the 
President of the quorum of the 
Apostles, in our hearing today. I 
believe that if the Latter-day Saints 
would, in very deed, observe this 
law of God, that the rich outpour- 
ings of the Spirit of God would be 
felt among the people as never be- 
fore. 

May God bless us and inspire us, 
one and all, with a determination to 
live up to this resolution and with a 
determination to serve God and to 
keep His commandments, is my 
prayer, and I ask it in the name of 
Jesus Christ. Amen. 

At the conclusion of his remarks, 
Elder Grant read the following 

RESOLUTION. 

Believing in the words and teach- 
ings of President Joseph F. Smith, 
as set forth this morning on the 
subject of temperance, it is pro- 
posed, therefore, that all officers and 
members of the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints will do

all in their power, that can properly 
be done, with lawmakers generally 
to have such laws enacted by our 
legislature, soon to be elected, as 
may be necessary to close saloons, 
otherwise decrease the sale of liquor 
and enact what is known as the 
"Sunday Law." 

On motion, the immense congre- 
gation voted in favor of the resolu- 
tion submitted, proclaiming "aye" 
in a unanimous shout. 



ELDER ANTHONY W. IVINS. 

The Saints enjoined to walk in the way 
of righteousness. — They must increase 
in faith, knowledge, and love. — Laws 
do not make "men good, but the love 
of right. 

"And it shall come to pass in the last 
days that the mountain of the Lord's 
house shall be established in the top of 
the mountains, and shall be exalted 
above the hills; and all nations shall 
flow unto it. 

"And many people shall go and say, 
Come ye, and let us go up to the moun- 
tain of the Lord, to the house of the God 
of Jacob; and He will teach us of His 
ways, and we will walk in His paths. 1 ' 

If I might be permitted, my 
brethren and sisters, to paraphrase 
or quote this Scripture as it presents 
itself to me, this afternoon, I would 
say : It has come to pass, in the last 
days, that the mountain of the 
Lord's house has been established hi 
the tops of the mountains, and all 
nations have flown unto it; and 
many people have gone, and have 
come up to the mountain of the 
Lord, to the house of the God ot 
Jacob, where they have been taught 
His ways, and where they have 
learned to walk in His paths. It 
seems to me that I see, in this vast 
congregation of Latter-day Saints 
who are assembled here this after- 
noon, the fulfillment of these words 



of the prophet Isaiah. It seems 
to me that I see in it justification 
for the change that I have made in 
the quotation of this Scripture. We 
have come to be taught the way of 
the Lord, that we might walk in 
His paths. What is the way of the 
Lord, my brethren and sisters? 
What are the paths which He has 
marked out, • and which we have 
come here that we might walk in 
them? Jesus said: "I am the way; 
I am the light; I am the life." If 
this be true, the way of the Lord is 
the way that He has taught us. If 
it is true that we are to follow in 
the way of the Lord or in the paths 
of the Lord, then are we to follow 
after Christ whom we acknowledge 
as the way. The Psalmist here say* 
that the way of the Lord- is right 
eousness, and he appeals to the 
Lord to teach him that he may 
walk in that righteous way. The 
way of the Lord, then, is righteous- 
ness; it is to do that which Christ 
our Savior, has commanded thai 
we should do. 

Many things which He taught us 
to do did not come in the way of di- 
rect command, but are binding upon 
us His followers. You who have 
come up here, my brethren and sis- 
ters, have faith in the Lord Jesus 
Christ. This was the way that He 
taught us, that we should believe 
in our Eternal Father, that we 
should recognize Christ as His Son, 
the Savior of the world. Your pres- 
ence here this afternoon is witness 
that you have this faith ; conse- 
quently, thus far, you are in the 
way of the Lord. This faith brings 
hope, and hope is manifest in your 
lives, in your obedience to the prin- 
ciples of the Gospel. He told us 
that after faith, after hope in the 
mercy of God our Eternal Father, 
repentance is necessary upon our 
part, that we forsake everything 



66 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



that is not righteous that we 
get into the righteous way 
to which the psalmist referred. In 
order that we might properly enter 
into it, he bore witness to us that 
except a man be born of the water 
and of the Spirit, he could not en- 
ter into the kingdom of heaven ; and 
more than that, unless he were born 
of the Spirit, he could not even see 
the kingdom of heaven, much less 
enter into it. So He called us to 
repentance. You have repented of 
your sins and are thus in the way of 
the Lord ; because that is the way 
He marked out. You have gone 
down into the waters of baptism 
and have been baptized for the re- 
mission of your sins. That was the 
way of the Lord ; you were follow- 
ing in His path, because He Him- 
self was baptized of John, in the 
river Jordan, and He bore witness 
to us that in order to fulfill all 
righteousness so should we be 
baptized in similitude of His death, 
and come out of the water in simil- 
itude of His resurrection ; and so. 
having done this, you are in the 
way of the Lord ; you are following 
in His path — that path which He 
tells us, though easy to follow ; 
though He makes it very plain to 
us, nevertheless, it is a straight and 
a narrow path. 

So, my brethren and sisters, we 
are here in the tops of the mount- 
ains, having access to the house of 
the God of Jacob, having been 
taught His way, we are learning to 
walk in His paths. We are not yet 
perfect, though we have giver, 
obedience to those fundamental and 
indispensable ordinances of the Gos - 
pel — not yet perfect before the 
Lord, because there are other 
things which are necessary to us 
that we may learn the way of life 
now, that we may understand how 
to apply these ordinances of the 



Gospel, which the Lord has given 
us, to our everlasting exaltation. 
It is necessary that our faith be in- 
creased by studying more fully the 
theory of this Gospel of redemp- 
tion, that we may become familiai 
with the word of the Lord, under- 
standing all of His dispensation.^ 
that we may know something of the 
past, that we may know something 
of the present, and that we may 
understand something of the 
future. He has revealed to us many 
many great and important things 
which apply to the future, as well 
as things concerning the present 
and the past, that these things may 
all be brought into harmonious 
union, that we may understand the 
providence of the Lord and th J 
purpose in this great scheme of 
human life and human redemp- 
tion which is embodied in the Gos- 
pel of Christ. Thus, He expects 
us to learn ; this is a part of His 
wjay, that we have come here to 
learn, the way of the Lord. 

If we walked in His paths, we 
wouldn't need courts, very badly, 
to keep us in the line of duty ; it 
would not be necessary for us to 
exercise the privileges and prero- 
gatives which the civil law gives 
us, in order that men might live 
righteous lives, but righteousness 
would be written in our hearts, be- 
cause of the love of it. We wouid 
be righteous because we desired 
righteousness, because we knew 
that it was the way of the Lord, the 
narrow path which He had marked 
Out. For that reason, we would 
be moral men and women, we 
would be truthful men and women ; 
we would be virtuous men and wo- 
men ; we would be temperate men 
and women; we would not be 
drunkards ; we would not be blas- 
phemers, because that is not the 
way of the Lord; that is not the 



ELDER ANTHONY W. IVINS. 



67 



way He taught us, and that is not 
the example He set for us to fol- 
low. His example was one of 
righteousness, one of love, one ot 
mercy, one of charity and of long- 
suffering, kindness towards all of 
God's creatures here in the earth. 
You know that He told us that the 
greatest of all gifts is charity. You 
knpw that He told us that the 
first great commandment is that 
we should love the Lord our God 
with all our hearts; and that the 
next great commandment, which 
is like unto it, is that we should 
love our neighbors as we love our- 
selves. This, He told us, is char- 
ity — not that we give liberally to 
the poor, not that we administer to 
the wants of those we know are in 
need, — 'but that the love of God act 
ually enters into our hearts, that we 
sympathize with those who are in 
distress, that we find joy in admin- 
istering to their wants, that we 
love each other and, show that love 
by rendering help ' where help is 
needed, that we love righteousness 
and seek, with all our might, to es- 
tablish it in the earth. 

I am not a strong believer in the 
ultimate ends that can possibly be 
accomplished by coercive means. It 
is all right to apply the law; it is 
necessary: we could not very well 
do without it, but far better and 
above the civil law is faith and the 
voluntary love that we have, by 
which we do good and observe the 
law without compulsion, but be- 
cause we love it. To illustrate this 
idea, I have often referred to two 
great peoples who were upon this 
American continent at the time of 
its discovery. The greatest na- 
tion in North America was the 
Aztec nation, with its headquarters 
where the City of Mexico now 
stands. Their dominion had been 
extended over all of this North 



American continent, a great and 
wealthy empire with a code of laws 
that in many respects were very 
remarkable. These people were 
noted for the rigor with which they 
applied the law to evil-doers; the 
murderer was punished by death , 
the thief among them was punished 
by death ; the adulterer was pun- 
ished by death ; the drunkard was 
punished by death; the man who 
struck his father was placed upon 
an equal plane with the murderer, 
and the law was rigorously enforc- 
ed, and yet historians tell us that 
that people were immoral, and the}' 
were so devoid of sense of right, 
so far as conscience was concerned, 
that it was impossible to lay an 
article down that was not immed- 
iately appropriated by some one 
else. We are told that murdei 
and adultery were common among 
them ; in fact, these crimes pre- 
vailed to an alarming extent. They 
had no regard at all for human 
life. Farther down, in South Amer- 
ica, was the empire of the Incas. The 
emperor stood there as the Son 
of Heaven, representing himself to 
be God's vicegerent here on earth, 
claiming all of that race as his peo- 
ple, his sons and his daughters, — 
another mighty empire, equal in 
wealth, equal in numbers, but here 
the people were governed almost 
entirely by moral law. They were 
taught that it was wrong to do evil, 
that they' must answer to the Great 
Spirit for the deeds done in the 
body, and it is written of them that 
theft was unknown among them; 
that immorality was unknown 
among them, that a homicide 
scarcely ever occurred ; a man leav- 
ing his house left the door open, 
with effects exposed, but they were 
never touched ; all the people work- 
ed together in harmonious union 
for the accomplishment of the well-

being of their fellows. The con- 
trast is very marked. 

So, my brethren and sisters, I 
feel that the greatest mission these 
brethren, these presidents of stakes, 
have before them today, the great- 
est mission before these bishops, 
and all the Latter-day Saints in 
general, who have come up here to 
learn the way of the Lord, and to 
walk in His paths, is that we teach 
righteousness to the people because 
of the love of it. This is the com- 
mand of our Father in heaven, and 
only through this plan, and onlv 
by righteousness manifest in ou." 
lives, because of our conversion to 
the truths of the Gospel, and the 
way of the Lord, can we please 
Him. I want to say to you that 
there is nothing requisite for the 
happiness, the welfare, the hope 



and the faith of men and women, 
that is not. comprehended in the 
Gospel of our Lord and Savior 
Jesus Christ, as it has been restored 
to the earth in the dispensation in 
which we live. 

May the Lord bless you, my 
brethren and sisters, and may He 
inspire us all to do right because 
we love it, that we may verily walk 
in the way of the Lord, as we have 
come up here to do, through Jesus 
Christ, Amen. 

The choir sang the anthem, 
"Awake, my soul;" the solo parts 
were rendered by Lizzie T. Edward 
and Wm. D. Phillips. 

Benediction was pronounced by 
Patriarch John Smith. 

Conference adjourned until 10 a. 
m. Monday, Oct. Sth. 



SECOND DAY. 



In the Tabernacle, Monday, Oct. 
5th, 10 a. m. 

Conference was called to order 
by President Joseph F. Smith. 

The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn : 

Our God, we raise to Thee 
Thanks for Thy blessings free 

We here enjoy; 
In this far western land, 
A true and chosen band, 
Led hither by Thy hand, 

We sing for joy. 

Prayer was offered by Elder 
Joseph A. McRae. 

The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn: 

O ye mountains high, where the clear 
blue sky 

Arches over the vales of the free, 
Where the pure breezes blow, and the 

clear streamlets flow, 
How I've longed to your bosom to 

flee. 

ELDER JOHN HENRY SMITH. 

Kind treatment at Irrigation Congress.— 
Utah victories at New Mexico Terri- 
torial Fair.— Music and religious ser- 
vices on passenger train. — Moral ele- 
vation of mankind the mission of the 
Saints. 

My brethren and sisters, I am 
happy in the privilege of being 
present here this morning, and 
sorely regret that it was not quite 
possible for me to be with you here 
yesterday, that I might have partic- 
ipated in the spirit of the opening 
session of the conference, and been 
in communion with you during the 
entire day. 



It has been my privilege, within 
the past few days, to be in attend- 
ance at the Irrigation Congress 
held at Albuquerque, New Mexico. 
There were present about nine hun- 
dred delegates from various sec- 
tions of the Union, and the spirit of 
the congress was a very satisfactory 
one. Some of us, however, were 
compelled to leave before its close, 
as also we were delayed in reaching 
and being in attendance upon its 
first meetings, owing to conditions 
along the lines of the railways. The 
spirit of that gathering was the 
improvement, so far as practicable, 
of this western land, the reclama- 
tion of the arid sections, and es- 
tablishment of such enterprises as 
tend to the betterment of that sec- 
tion of the world we love so much. 

We were also happy to be in at- 
tendance, though briefly at the Ter- 
ritorial Fair of New Mexico. Utah 
was in competition with other sec- 
tions of the country for a cup or 
trophy, given by Mr. Hearst 01 
New York ; and I am pleased so say 
to you that Utah was successful in 
carrying off that trophy, valued 
at one thousand dollars. In addi- 
tion to this, there was a contest be- 
tween four or five bands. The band 
from Utah, led by Mr. John Held, 
was in competition for another cup, 
presented by Mr. Hearst, valued at 
$100.00. There was a band fron 
Chihuahua in Mexico, said to stand 
very high in the knowledge of music 
and there were several other bands, 
One, I believe, from Denver, and 
others from the Territory of New 
Mexico, and possibly one from Ari- 
zona, though I am not certain in 



70 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



regard to this latter statement. The 
result of that competition was that 
the band from Utah secured the cup 
valued at $100.00, given by Mr. 
Hearst; and they returned home in 
jubilation over their success. 

We were kindly treated, as we 
always have been among that body 
of gentlemen who congregate at 
these congresses ; and the fairest 
possible action was taken, in every 
sense of the word, by all concerned, 
looking to the good of every sec- 
tion. We find that we are gradual- 
ly becoming more widely known, 
and that the ill feelings that have 
sometimes existed are being elim- 
inated from the hearts of men and 
women, as they become conversant 
with the nature of our work. 

I desire to say, in addition, that 
yesterday the band gave something 
of an entertainment in their car, to 
which the people upon the train 
were invited, and they gave 
us some very fine music indeed. It 
was also our privilege to sing 
hymns, and to offer prayer, and we 
had the further privilege of speak- 
ing to that body of people from 
many sections of our country, to 
express our regard and love for our 
country, and to proclaim our 
purpose to aid in its advancement 
and upbuilding, and in the bet- 
terment of its citizenship. After 1 
had spoken, a motion was made, by 
Brother Richard W. Young, tend- 
ering a vote of thanks to the band, 
and this was unanimously carried. 
Then they played "My Country 'Tis 
of Thee," and the Doxology was 
sung, "Praise God From Whom aii 
Blessings Flow," after which Bro 
ther George Austin offered a clos- 
ing prayer. Quite a number of the 
people who were in that company 
expressed themselves as very hap- 
py indeed to have been invited to be 
in attendance upon that occasion. 



I presume it is possible that some 
of them may be present here today, 
with the purpose in view of hear- 
ing our choir, as well as seeking 
to become acquainted with the con- 
ditions that exist in this part of the 
world, and for the purpose of list- 
ening to the voices that may bt 
raised from this platform, in speak- 
ing upon the principles of the Gos- 
pel. 

My brothers and sisters, I regret 
to say that owing to engagements 
that have arisen with me, I shall be 
under the necessity of leaving this 
city today at one o'clock, for Cali- 
fornia. I trust you will tolerate my 
absence, as I have been entangled 
in the meshes of some business con- 
nected with these congresses, that 
requires the fulfillment of my word 
to be in attendance. 

With you, I want to endorse the 
resolutions that it is said you pass- 
ed here yesterday. I did not read 
them, but I take it for granted that 
the common sense of the Latter- 
day Saints, and their faith in the 
Supreme Being, lead them to de- 
cide upon their movements and 
purpose in harmony with such sug- 
gestions as may come from our pre- 
siding authorities, looking to the 
betterment of the human race — not 
alone the problems of our own ad- 
vancement, the uplifting and up- 
building of that system we love so 
Well, but the betterment of our 
great country, that its citizenship 
may be improved by our aid and 
suggestions. We desire, also, that 
we ourselves may be improved by 
the application of the principles of 
temperance and morality; and that 
we may be inspired with a thorough 
and determined purpose that the best 
elements of pure manhood and pure 
womanhood shall be awakened also 
in the souls of our fellows, to the 
best of our ability. This is our

purpose, and our mission. The 
work we have accepted came from 
God, and it comprehends within it 
all things that are noble and good, 
all things that are pure and right. 
They who drink at the divine foun- 
tain, and are impressed with the 
Holy Spirit and enjoy its direction, 
will be found in their struggles and 
efforts seeking to enhance the well 
being of their countrymen. When 
I say "01 untrymen," I am in har- 
mony with the view that was held 
by the fathers of our country, in re- 
gard to this land, that it was indeed 
choice above all other lands ; 
and that- it was indeed the 
purpose of our government to 
open the door of liberty, peace, and 
happiness to the human race. While 
I do not anticipate that the down- 
trodden people of all the world can 
find a home under the flag of tne 
United States, it being impossible 
for this land to care for and pro- 
tect them all, yet I do believe that 
the principles of liberty announced 
by the fathers of this republic, and 
upon which this government has 
builded, will modify, and change, 
and "leaven the lump" until every 
land and clime under the sun will, 
in greater or less degree, receive 
the principles enunciated by them, 
and make the effort to so overcome 
false traditions of the past that ail 
nations will eventually be found in 
the way of the accomplishment ol 
good. 

My brethren and my sisters, with 
this mission and purpose in view, 
appreciating the glorious land in 
which we live, the truths of thr 
Gospel that has been re-established, 
the visitation of heavenly mes- 
sengers, the presence of God Him- 
self and His Son, their declaration 
of truth, and the bestowal of the 
graces and gifts so essential to the 
well-being of the human race, we 



are led to think more cautiously, 
and to act more considerately. 
When we reflect upon these things, 
we should feel disposed to act more 
wisely and more kindly in the con- 
duct of our lives, in obedience to 
the principles of temperance and 
morality, the principles of justice,, 
mercy and love, reaching out the 
helping hand to the unfortunates of 
the world, pointing to them the 
way of life and the enjoyment of 
liberty, freed from the trammels 
of evil into which so many have 
drfted. 

My brethren and my sisters,I bear 
my testimony to the truth of the 
Gospel of the Redeemer, and I say 
to you; obey its behests, keep the 
commandments of God, stand up- 
right in the majesty of the Spirit 
that comes from on high, and when 
His jewels are clustered, in the 
eternities, upon your brow will rest 
the crown of life, and you will re- 
ceive the approval of God. Dis- 
obedience to these principles, dis- 
regard of the Divine will, and dis- 
regard of the laws of this glorious 
country of ours, means trouble, 
tribulation, and sorrow ; while, on 
the other hand, if we are true to 
these principles and keep the com- 
mandments of God, happiness and 
peace will be the result, and the 
blessings of God will come to His 
children. May God bless you 
Amen.

Evidences that Temple building is ap-

Brethren and sisters : Perhaps the 
most striking feature of the Latter- 
day work, in which we are engag-

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



ed, is temple-building; we are a 
temple-building people. When- 
ever and wherever the Lord has 
had a people upon the earth, He has 
required them to build a temple, or 
a house of the Lord, unto Him. If 
this be true, what becomes of the 
claim of the Re-organized Church 
of Latter-day Saints that they have 
the Church of Christ, for they are 
without a temple and without tem- 
ple ordinances; and what becomes 
of the claims of many other de- 
nominations in the earth? For they 
also are without a temple and with- 
out temple ordinances. 

You will remember that in the 
early ages of the world, in the days 
of ancient Israel, in the wilderness, 
that they had a tabernacle, a kind 
of a movable building, suited to 
their condition, which no doubt to 
them took the place of a temple ; at 
least, it was the sanctuary of God, 
a place where He could meet with 
His people; and there were many 
demonstrations of power and of the 
favor of the Lord witnessed in the 
tabernacle in the wilderness. Later 
on, in the promised land, a great 
temple was reared to the name of 
the Lord; it was known as the 
Temple of Solomon. It was dedi- 
cated to the Lord under very inter- 
esting circumstances, and with de- 
monstrations of power and of di- 
vine acceptance. Later on, the 
Savior, many times appeared in the 
temple and instructed the people 
there* His disciples and the saints, 
and when that holy house was used 
for improper purposes, and was 
desecrated, the Lord Jesus drove 
the offenders therefrom, for He de- 
clared that it was His Father's 
house. Even on this continent, in 
the days of the Nephites, we learn 
that temples were built among the 
people, for Nephi declared that he 
built a temple of the Lord and that 



it was patterned after the temple 
of Solomon. At the time, or just 
prior to the time, that the Savior 
manifested Himself to the Neph- 
ites, the people gathered around the 
temple in Bountiful, discussing the 
wonderful events that had trans- 
pired. In these latter days, after 
the saints founded the city of Kirt- 
land, a temple was reared there to 
the name of the Lord ; and as in the 
case of the temple of Solomon, the 
dedication of the temple at Kirt- 
land was attended with demonstra- 
tions of power and of divine ac- 
ceptance of the Lord. He appeared 
to be well pleased with that work, 
and in that house the saints enjoyed 
many glorious visions. It is re- 
corded in section no of the Doc- 
trine and Covenants, as follows ; 
under the heading, "Visions mani- 
fested to Joseph, the Seer, and 
Oliver Cowdery, in the Kirtland 
Temple, April 3, 1836." — seventy- 
two years ago : 

"The veil was taken from our minds, 
and the eyes of our understanding were 
opened. 

"We saw the Lord standing upon the 
breastwork of the pulpit, before us, and 
under His feet was a paved work of pure 
gold in color like amber. 

"His eyes were as a flame of fire, the 
hair of His head was white like the pure 
snow, His countenance shone above the 
brightness of the sun, and His voice 
was as the sound of the rushing of great 
waters, even the voice of Jehovah, say- 
ing: 

"I am the first and the last, I am He 
who liveth, I am He who was slain, I am 
your advocate with the Father. 

"Behold, your sins are forgiven you, 
you are clean before me, therefore lift 
up your heads and rejoice, 

"Let the hearts of your brethren re- 
joice, and let the hearts of all my peo- 
ple rejoice, who have, with their 
might, built this house to my name, 

"For behold, I have accepted this 
house, and my name shall be here, and 
I will manifest myself to my people in 
mercy in this house. 



ELDER RUDGER CLAW SON. 



73 



"Yea, I will appear unto my servants, 
and speak unto them with mine own 
voice, if my people will keep my com- 
mandments, and do not pollute this holy 
house. 

"Yea, the hearts of thousands shall 
greatly rejoice in consequence of the 
blessings which shall be poured out, and 
the endowment with which my servants 
have been endowed in this house; 

"And the fame of this house shall 
spread to foreign lands, and this is the 
beginning of the blessing which shall be 
poured out upon the heads of my peo- 
ple." 

Why should the fame of that 
house, the first temple reared in this 
generation, spread to all nations? 
Because it was accepted of the 
Lord, and the Lord Himself ap- 
peared in it, He manifested Himself 
to His people, and His voice was 
heard there declaring that He had 
accepted it, and that He had ac- 
cepted His people. And there were 
other glorious visions given ;Moses, 
Elias, and Elijah appeared, and 
committed keys of power and au- 
thority to the Prophet. 

A few years after the saints set- 
tled at Nauvoo, and founded that 
beautiful city, they reared a temple 
to the Lord; and again, when the 
people migrated to this country and 
established a community in the 
mountains, after they had founded 
the great city of Salt Lake, they 
built a temple to the Most High 
God. In their infancy, as it were, 
in the days of their poverty, the 
foundations of this great temple 
were laid. After the saints settled 
in Cache valley, and had founded 
the city of Logan, they built a tem- 
nle there. Also, after they had set- 
tled in Manti, thev built a temple 
there: and when they founded the 
city of St. George, away to the 
south, thev were a poor people, but 
in the course of time, they built a 
temple there. Thus we have, in 
this mountain region, four great 



and glorious temples ; and doubtless 
Isaiah, the Prophet, had his eye 
fixed upon the temple located on 
this block, when he said : 

"In the latter day, the mountain 
of the Lord's house shall be es- 
tablished in the tops of the mount- 
ains and be exalted above the hills, 
and all nations shall flow unto it." 

Brethren and sisters, go forth 
into the world, entier into th; 
mountains, visit the high places of 
the earth.and where — except here — 
where will you find a temple erect- 
ed to the Most High God? Surely 
Isaiah was inspired, and his proph- 
ecies are being fulfilled by the Lat- 
ter-day Saints. Let me call your at- 
tention to this significant fact, that 
these temples, which have been er - 
ected at such a cost of time and 
means and labor, were not built to 
beautify the country or to please the 
eye, or to attract the attention of 
strangers, but were built for a 
greater purpose, and that purpose 
is emphasized in the following 
words, better, perhaps, than I can 
tell it; 

"And again, verily, thus saith the 
Lord : Let the work of my temple and all 
the works which I have appointed unto 
you, be continued on and not cease, and 
let your diligence and your perseverance 
and patience and your works be redou- 
bled, and you shall in no wise lose your 
reward, saith the Lord of Hosts. 

"And if they persecute you, so perse- 
cuted they the prophets and righteous 
men that were before you ; for all this 
there is a reward in heaven. 

"And again, I give unto you a word 
in relation to the baptism for your dead : 

"Verily, thus saith the Lord unto you, 
concerning your dead : When any of you 
are baptized for your dead, let there be a 
recorder, and let him be eye-witness of 
vour baptism : let him hear with his ears, 
that he may testify of the truth, saith the 
Lord, that in all your recording it may 
be recorded in heaven, that what- 
soever you bind on earth may be bound 
in heaven ; and whatsoever you loose on 
earth may be loosed in heaven, 



74 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Therefore, brethren and sisters, 
these temples of the Lord are re- 
garded by the Latter-day Saints as 
the connecting link between the 
heavens and the earth; and there- 
fore, again, because of the or- 
dinances for the dead, which are 
performed in the House of Goa 
we are not only building up a great 
church upon the earth, but are lay- 
ing the foundation for a great 
church in the spirit world. It is be- 
cause of this, in my judgment, that 
the Lord emphasizes the importance 
of temple work and that with us 
His people, it must continue on and 
not cease. 

Some years ago, a brother ap- 
proached me, and he said : "Brothei 
Clawson, I am sixty-seven years of 
age ; I have been a strong and ac- 
tive man in my life, and have done 
a great deal of hard work, but now 
I am somewhat feeble; I can not 
engage in manual labor as hereto- 
fore. How shall I spend my time ?" 
I said to him, "Go to the house of 
the Lord." "Thank you," he re- 
plied, "I will take your counsel." 
About eight years later, I met this 
brother again. He appeared to be 
very happy indeed; and there was 
an expression of joy in his coun- 
tenance. "Brother Clawson," he 
said, "during the past eight years 
I have been working for my an- 
cestors, in the house of the Lord, 
After that conversation with you, 
I went east and I gathered up eight 
hundred names of my relatives ; and 
during the past eight years I have 
personally officiated for three hun- 
dred of my ancestors, and I pro- 
pose to continue on with the good 
work ; I am happy for the Lord has 
blessed me." He further said, "1 
saw in vision, upon one occasion, 
mv father and mother, who were 
"ot members of the Church, who 
1">d not received the Gospel in life. 



and I discovered that they were 
living separate and apart in the 
spirit world, and when I asked 
them how it was that they were 
so, my father said: 'This is an en- 
forced separation, and you are the 
only individual that can bring us 
together ; you can do this work ; 
will you do it?'" — meaning that he 
should go into the house of the 
Lord and there officiate for his par- 
ents who were dead, and by the 
ordinance of sealing bring them to- 
gether and unite them in the famiL 
relation beyond the vail ; and he 
informed me that he had attended 
to the work, and I rejoiced with 
him and congratulated him. 

Just now, at the beginning of 
this meeting, I went down into the 
audience, and a brother reached oui 
his hand, a brother eighty years of 
age and upwards, I think, I judged 
so from his appearance. He shook 
my hand, and I recognized him as 
a man who had been much in the 
temple here, and I said to the party 
sitting next to him, "This is a tem- 
ple man," and the brother spoke 
up and said, "Yes, Brother Claw- 
son, I have officiated in the temple 
for twelve hundred souls." Then I 
turned again to the party next to 
him and said: "Our brother here 
may pass through life unnoticed ; 
he may attract but little attention, 
but I tell you he will be a big man 
in the other world." He will be 
an important character there, be- 
cause it will be known of him and 
will be said of him that he turned 
the key of life and salvation for 
twelve hundred souls. And I sub- 
mit to you, my brethren and sisters, 
is not that a mighty work, and are 
not his last days better than his 
first days? 

Brethren and sisters, the oppor- 
tunities that are before us in the 
house of the Lord are boundless.

Our dead are waiting, anxiously 
waiting for this people to go into 
the house of God and officiate for 
them that they may be liberated 
from the prison house in the spir- 
it world. During the time these 
four temples have been in opera- 
tion, there have been over three 
million ordinances performed in be- 
half of the dead and over 240,000 
ordinances in behalf of the living, 
or in other words, between three 
and four million ordinances per- 
formed for the living and for the 
dead. So I maintain and wish to 
strongly emphasize, if I could, that 
probably the most striking feature 
of the latter-day work, in which we 
are engaged, is the building of tem- 
ples. We are a temple-building 
people, and ever will be, for this is 
one of our duties, it is one of the 
obligations resting upon us and 
made binding upon the Latter-day 
Saints, and made binding upon 
every people who are blessed and 
accepted by the Lord. May God 
bless us and help us to appreciate 
His goodness, His power and His 
authority, is my prayer, in the name 
of Jesus. Amen. 

"He leadeth me," a tenor solo, 
was sung by Elder Wm. D. Phil- 
lips.

Necessity for prayer, and its efficacy. — 
The Saints admonished to pray in 
their homes. — Marvelous results of 
prayers of faith. — The praying Saint 
will not apostatize. — Prayer a reliable 
source of peace and happiness. — 
Prayer needful under all conditions 
and circumstances. 

We have been blessed, my breth- 
ren and sisters, with sweet music 
during this conference, but above 



this, we have been extremely blessed 
with the word of the Lord, through 
His servants, by way of admoni- 
tion to this people. 

Yesterday, while President Smith 
was speaking upon the Word of 
Wisdom, my soul responded 
"Amen" to every word utered by 
him, and I said to myself: I would 
that the "Mormon" people were 
united in their observance of this 
great law, that every member of the 
Church would accept the counsel 
given at this conference respecting 
temperance as the will of the Father 
and live strictly according to the 
revelation of God in this particu- 
lar. Is it possible for us to place 
ourselves in a position to accept and 
adhere to this requirement of the 
Lord? I am convinced that it is. 
Then what can I recommend to this 
people, or what advice can I give 
to this congregation, and to the 
Saints in general, that would help 
them to live this law strictly? I 
have decided that the best thing I 
can say is to recommend to the peo- 
ple that they pray to God for help 
and assistance, and continue to pray 
in earnest until the desired end has 
been attained. Let those who have 
already obeyed the law pray that 
power may be given them to assist 
those who are still struggling to 
overcome their shortcomings in this 
regard. 

During this conference I have felt 
like calling the attention of the 
Saints to the necessitv of prayer, for 
I know what prayer has done for 
God's people in the past, and what 
it has done for them in this age. I 
feel in my soul to thank the Lord 
that I had a mother who taught me 
to pray, from the time I was old 
enough to understand anything. She 
not only taught me by word and 
example to pray, but she taught me 



76 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



in the same way observance of the 
Word of Wisdom. My home was 
a home of prayer and temperance, 
and I sincerely thank God for it. 

Here let me quote the words of 
one of our hymns, that I always 
love to hear sung: 

Prayer is the soul's sincere desire, 

Unuttered or expressed; 
The motion of a hidden fire 

That trembles in the breast. 

Prayer is the burden of a sigh, 

The falling of a tear, 
The upward glancing of an eye, 

When none but God is near. 

Prayer is the simplest form of speech 

That infant lips can try ; 
Prayer, the sublimest strains that reach 

The Majesty on high. 

I trust and hope that all the Lat- 
ter-day Saints attend to their pray- 
ers. I have been surprised many 
times, when traveling in the stakes 
of Zion, to hear presidents of stakes 
say that, in some homes of mem- 
bers of the Church, prayer is almost 
forgotten. I say to every Latter- 
day Saint that this is wrong and 
dangerous. Have family prayers ; 
they should be simple and sincere, 
a supplication to God from the 
heart, asking for His blessings and 
mercies. I know that He will bless 
the people if they will ask Him. 
Christ taught simplicity of prayer; 
and gave as an example that sim- 
ple yet sublime form now known as 
the Lord's Prayer. I often wish 
that it was repeated in our congre- 
gations more than it is. In the Sen- 
ate of the United States, the Rev- 
erend Edward Everett Hale, the 
chaplain of that law-making body, 
never offers a prayer but what he 
brings it to a close by repeating the 
Lord's Prayer. 

Prayer is the proper way of com- 



munication between God's children 
and Himself; when that communi- 
cation ceases, then spiritual decay 
begins. I can testify to that, my 
brethren and sisters, and I know 
that almost every one of you can 
testify similarly — not from experi- 
ence, but from observation. We 
have seen men enjoying the Spirit 
of God, thankful recipients of His 
blessings, enjoying peace and con- 
tentment in their homes, and thank- 
ing God night and morning for 
these blessings; but, for some rea- 
son or other, they ceased to ac- 
knowledge God as the Giver of all 
good, and prayer became a thing of 
the past with them; in almost every 
case the Spirit of God has been 
withdrawn from such homes and 
such men, and spiritual decay be- 
gan. Therefore, let me ask you to 
pray with your families; and I ad- 
vise you to see that every one of 
your children is taught how and 
when to pray. 

A famous preacher, Christmas 
Evans, says of prayer: "It is the 
rope in the belfrey; we pull it, and 
the bell rings in heaven." 

To him, my brethren and sisters, 
prayer was real. He believed in 
God, had faith in Jesus Christ, and 
was convinced that through prayer 
blessings were obtained by the chil- 
dren of this world. I believe that 
it has been by prayer alone that 
modern Christian organizations 
have retained as many truths per- 
taining to Christ's teachings as they 
have. I know that the prayer of a 
child is pleasing to God, and that 
the prayers of all righteous people 
availeth much. I ask that God will 
put it into the hearts of our chil- 
dren to pray to Him. I know, as 
the hymn says, that "prayer is the 
soul's sincere desire," and that it 



ELDER REED SMOOT. 



77 



will either be to God or to Mam- 
mon — one or the other. If an hon- 
est person offers a prayer, if it is 
in his heart to ask of God those 
things that will be best for him, 
and that will tend toward the up- 
lifting of mankind in this world, the 
betterment of God's children here, 
then that petition is a prayer that 
will ascend to the throne of the 
Father; but if it comes from the 
heart of a wicked person, and it is 
a mere selfish request, not intended 
for any righteous purpose, it is a 
prayer to mammon. 

Many people say : What does 
prayer do? What good does it ac- 
complish ? Let us reflect ; let us re- 
fer to the Bible, and see what prayer 
did for God's people in the past. As 
I recall it now, prayer has divided 
seas, and has rolled back flowing 
rivers; it has caused living streams 
of water to burst forth from solid 
rock; it has muzzled lions and has 
rendered vipers and poisons harm- 
less; it has arrested the sun in its 
rapid race, and has stopped the 
course of the moon; it has burst 
open iron gates, and has recalled 
souls from eternity ; it has called 
legions of angels down from the 
heavens. Prayer has bridled the 
vicious passions of men ; it has rout- 
ed and destroyed armies of proud, 
daring atheists. Prayer has brought 
one man from the bottom of the 
ocean, and carried another, in a 
chariot of fire, to heaven. I can 
imagine the scoffer and unbeliever 
saying : "Oh, this is ancient history. 
These are Bible stories ; tell us what 
prayer has done modern individ- 
uals ; tell us what prayer has 
done touching the things of 
this life; something that prayer 
has done in this age of the world, 
and let the dark ages take care of 



themselves." Well, I know a peo- 
ple who can say that through the 
power of prayer there have been 
accomplished as great things in this 
day as were ever done in former 
ages. It was through prayer that 
the Father and the Son appeared to 
Joseph Smith ; through prayer that 
the great plan of salvation was re- 
vealed unto him. It is through 
prayer that this people have been 
directed from' the foundation of 
this Church to the present time. It 
was through prayer that the pio- 
neers were protected and guided 
across the trackless plains of the 
western wilderness, and brought 
safely to the tops of these moun- 
tains. It has been through prayer 
that God has blessed the earth in 
these valleys and made it produce 
abundantly, of fruits, vegetables 
grains and nearly every other req- 
uisite for the sustaining of His peo- 
ple in comfort. It seems to me that 
if we look into our own lives, and 
see what prayer has done for each 
and every one of us, we will find 
countless blessings that have come 
to us through prayer. 

But we must so live that we are 
worthy of the blessings asked for. 
I do not believe that a people steep- 
ed in sin, or a man corrupt in heart, 
can receive the full blessings of the 
eternal Father, for they do not place 
themselves in a position to receive 
them. A man must repent of his 
sins ; he must have faith that God 
is the Giver of all good; he must 
believe that God actually exists be- 
fore he can feel that his prayer will 
be answered. 

As far as I am concerned, and I 
believe as far as each and every 
Latter-day Saint is concerned, we 
can say it is through prayer that 
we have received a testimony that 



78 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



this Gospel is true, that God lives, 
and that Jesus is the Christ. I re- 
member when I was a boy, my 
mother would talk to me by the 
hour, and often testify to me that 
she knew that this was Christ's 
Church. I had my doubts, and 
frankly stated to her that I had no 
such testimony. She was never dis- 
couraged, and would always say, 
"Reed, attend to your prayers ; keep 
yourself unspotted from the sins of 
this world; have faith in God, and 
you shall know that this is God's 
work, that this is His Church, and 
you will be able to testify to the 
world that you know that God 
lives." The Prophet Joseph Smith 
told President John Taylor that if 
he would pray earnestly every day 
of his life, he would never apos- 
tatize from the Church. I say also 
to all members of the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 
that if they will attend to their 
prayers, make the hearthstone of the 
home an altar for prayer, where the 
words from sincere hearts appeal 
to our Father in Heaven, pray hon- 
estly, morning and evening, with 
the family and in secret ; I promise 
them that they will never apostatize 
from this Church. 

When I was one of the presi- 
dency of the Utah Stake of Zion; 
I had a number of people come to 
me with their troubles, in a few 
instances, wives complaining of 
their husbands, the husband, in one 
or two cases, complaining against 
the wife — and to such a degree that 
they actually thought separation was 
necessary. I desire to say to you, 
that in not one instance did a 
woman or man come to me under 
such conditions but, upon inquiry, 
I found that family prayers had en- 
tirely ceased in such homes, the 



Spirit of God had left them, dark- 
ness had come in place of light, and 
the influence that made the home 
happy before, that made the hus- 
band love the wife and the wife the 
husband, had been removed, and 
they were drifting farther apart 
every day. 

I know that God will bless His 
people if they will attend to their 
prayers honestly and sincerely. 
Prayer is a duty. Why? Because 
God says that He desires His peo- 
ple to pray. And far greater than 
a duty, prayer is a privilege to ev- 
ery Latter-day Saint, and that priv- 
ilege should be exercised by every 
member of the Church. No mat- 
ter whether it be child, man, or 
woman, we should value our souls ; 
and, as we value our soul's eternal 
happiness, as we value the salva- 
tion of mankind, the fulfilment of 
the decrees of God, the extension 
of the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints, the eradication 
of all vices in our midst, as we 
value the great principles of tem- 
perance, virtue, truth, and charity, 
so let us pray. Let us pray early and 
late, and let the prayer not only be 
by the lips but from the heart. Let 
us pray in secret and in public. The 
sick and afflicted of this people need 
our prayers. The poor and needy 
need our prayers. The President of 
this Church needs our prayers. The 
President of this Nation needs our 
prayers. The wicked need our 
prayers ; and I wish to say to you 
that Salt Lake City needs our pray- 
ers. All the peoples of the world 
need our prayers, and God will give 
answer, in His own due time, if they 
come from the hearts of an honest 
people. May we realize the im- 
portance of prayer and what it 
means. It is a weapon that God has 



ELDER HYRUM M. SMITH. 



79 



placed in the hands of His people, 
a weapon He has given us with 
which to fight sin ; and remember 
this, that when we use it, we have 
God on our side to uphold our hands 
in any battle against sin. 

My brethren and sisters, I pray 
that the blessings of God may be 
with you, and that you will take 
to your homes, from this confer- 
ence, the spirit of prayer. Teach it 
to your children, and let one peo- 
ple — the Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints — be known all 
over the world as a people who be- 
lieve in prayer. During my visits 
in the East, I have had people tes- 
tify, many times, that they have 
been in the homes of Latter-day 
Saints, and know that the "Mor- 
mons" are a prayerful people. I 
remember one Senator, living in 
an adjacent State, whom I have 
heard testify, time and time again, 
that there was one class of people 
in his State that honestly believed 
in prayer ; they even opened their 
amusements with prayer. He also 
testified that he had been in the 
home of a president of a stake, and 
that he had seen every member of 
the family, night and morning, 
kneel in prayer, after having sung 
a hymn, and join in calling upon 
God, in all earnestness, for His aid ; 
and that no one could witness such 
a sight without testifying that such 
people must be sincere and honest 
in their attitude and belief respect- 
ing God and their religion. My 
brethren and sisters, let our lives 
be such that we can have all men 
testify the same of us ; and may 
God's blessings be with you and 
with this people forever, is my 
prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen.

Deserved reproof should be humbly ac- 
cepted. — "There is no such thing as 
necessary evil." — Intelligent obedience 
most desirable. — Leaders should them- 
selves walk the path they want flock to 
follow. 

I would like to read a portion of 
a revelation given to Joseph Smith, 
the Seer, at Kirtland, in May, 1831, 
in which the Lord said : 

Hearken, O ye elders of my Church, 
'and give ear to the voice of the living 
God, and attend to the words of wisdom 
which shall be given unto you, accord- 
ing as ye have asked and are agreed as 
touching the Church, and the spirits 
which have gone abroad in the earth. 

Behold, verily I say unto you. that 
there are many spirits which are false 
spirits, which have gone forth in the 
earth, deceiving the world ; 

And also Satan hath sought to de- 
ceive you, that he might overthrow you. 

Behold, I the Lord have looked upon 
you, and have seen atiominations in the 
Church that profess my name; 

But blessed are they who are faithful 
and endure, whether in life or in death, 
for they shall inherit eternal life. 

But wo unto them that are deceivers 
and hypocrites, for, thus saith the Lord, 
I will bring them to judgment. 

Behold, verily I say unto you, there 
are hypocrites among you, who have de- 
ceived some, which has given the adver- 
sary power, but behold such [that is, 
those who are deceived] shall be re- 
claimed ; 

But the hypocrites shall be detected 
and shall be cut off, either in life or in 
death, even as I will ; and wo unto them 
who are cut off from my Church, for the 
same are overcome of the world. 

Wherefore, let every man beware lest 
he do that which is not in truth and 
righteousness before me. 

And now come, saith the Lord, by the 
Spirit, unto the elders of His Church, 
and let us reason together, that ye may 
understand. 

Let us reason even as a man reason- 
eth one with another, face to face. 

Now when a man reasoneth he is un- 



80 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



derstood of man because he reasoneth as 
a man, even so will I, the Lord, reason 
with you that you may understand. 

Wherefore I, the Lord, asketh you this 
question, unto what were ye ordained? 

To preach my gospel by the Spirit, 
even the Comforter which was sent 
forth to teach the truth; 

And then received ye spirits which ye 
could not understand, and received them 
to be of God, and in this are ye justi- 
fied? 

Behold, ye shall answer this question 
yourselves; nevertheless I will be merci- 
ful unto you — he that is weak among 
you hereafter shall be made strong. 

Verily, I say unto you, he that is or-, 
dained of me and sent forth to preach 
the word of truth by the Comforter, in 
the Spirit of truth, doth he preach it by 
the Spirit of truth or some other way? 

And if it be by some other way, it be 
not of God. 

And again, he that receiveth the word 
of truth, doth he receive it by the Spirit 
of truth or some other way? 

If it be some other way it be not of 
God: 

Therefore, why is it that ye cannot un- 
derstand and know that he that receiveth 
the word by the Spirit of truth, receiveth 
it as it is preached by the Spirit of 
truth ? 

Wherefore, he that preacheth and he 
that receiveth, understandeth one an- 
other, and both are edified and rejoice 
together ; 

And that which doth not edify is not 
of God, and is darkness ; 

That which is of God is light; and he 
that receiveth light and continueth in 
God, receiveth more light, and that light 
groweth brighter and brighter until the 
perfect day. 

As remarked by Elder Reed 
Smoot, I also have rejoiced, during 
this conference, that my spirit has 
received gladly every word that has 
been spoken. Those remarks of the 
President of the Church, in relation 
to the Word of Wisdom, found my 
spirit in perfect accord, and I re- 
joice that I, who heard, understood 
exactly as he who spoke. I have 
understood the words of all the 
brethren. They have not been mys- 



terious; they have been plain and 
easy to understand; and those who 
have spoken and all who have 
heard, I trust, have understood 
alike, and thereby evidence that 
they are possessed of the Spirit of 
Truth and of Light, and not of 
darkness. All that has been said 
has been edifying and good, and in- 
tended to build us up. From the 
manner in which the whole congre- 
gation, in one united "aye" ex- 
pressed their approval of the reso- 
lution endorsing the sentiments of 
the President, I judge that they 
were in possession of the Spirit of 
God, that they understood His ser- 
vants who reasoned with them as a 
man reasoneth with his friend, face 
to face. 

I am glad that there is the dispo- 
sition in the President of the 
Church and in God, Who speaks 
through His servants, to reprove 
the congregations of Israel when 
they need reproof, as well as to 
commend them, when their lives are 
worthy of commendation. We 
should receive reproof with the 
same spirit that we receive com- 
mendation. We are sorry, to be 
sure, that we have to be reproved 
because of neglect of duty, but if 
neglect does prevail among us, then 
we need to be reproved, and it is my 
belief that this people will be more 
faithful in keeping the Word of 
Wisdom than they perchance have 
been before. I believe we are will- 
ing to receive the word of the Lord 
and that we will repent of our sins 
and overcome these evils that we 
have allowed ourselves to Decome 
addicted to and which were prompt- 
ed by the false spirits that have 
gone abroad in the world to de- 
ceive men. The Lord is absolutely 
opposed to all manner of sin, of 
evil, of wickedness, of vice, and 



ELDER HYRUM M. SMITH. 



81 



corruption. He has declared that 
He can look upon these things with 
no degree of allowance. He cannot 
wink at these things, because He 
has commanded that they shall be 
done away among His people. Yet, 
there are those among us who have 
been deceived and who have imag- 
ined that the committing of a little 
sin was not a great thing. But 
when sin is committed, in the face 
of the knowledge that it is sin, con- 
demnation must follow just as 
surely as the sin is committed. 

There is no such thing as "nec- 
essary evils." When any man de- 
clares that prostitution or any other 
crime is a necessary evil, or that sa- 
loons are a necessary evil, we are 
inclined to ask him how he knows. 
He can not know it, other than by 
his personal experience ; he can not 
know it for some one else ; and if he 
knows it by his own experience he 
acknowledges that he is vile and 
corrupt and is unfit and entirely un- 
worthy of the association, confi- 
dence, or trust of decent and re- 
spectable people. We know to the 
contrary ; we know that these things 
are not necessary, because God has 
declared it, and the Lord knows. 
Nowhere has He ever said that sin 
and wickedness are necessary, but 
He has condemned all such. As 
was said yesterday, all Latter-day 
Saints ought to set their faces, as 
flint, against all manner of evil, and 
by that example prove to the world 
that it is possible to live above sin, 
and not yield to the seducing wicked 
spirits which have gone abroad in 
the world. The man who imagines 
that these things are necessary is 
one of those that the Lord referred 
to as having been deceived by those 
wicked spirits. The Latter-day 
Saints ought to be in possession of 
the Spirit of God, and be guided in 



all things by it. We ought to have 
tabernacles which are clean and 
pure, and which have never been 
defiled, and cannot be defiled, be- 
cause they are controlled Ti)y the 
Spirit of the Lord. Our bodies 
should be temples of the Most High 
God, wherein may dwell the Spirit 
of the Lord, and our words and our 
acts should always be the fruits of 
the Spirit. We should never per^ 
form the evil works of the flesh, but 
subdue them, and control ourselves 
in all righteousness. Thank God 
we, both as individuals and as a 
people, have the power to resist evil 
and overcome it with good. There- 
fore, my brethren and sisters, I re- 
joice that the Lord can see when 
His chosen people in any manner or 
degree depart from strict obedience 
to His commands, and that He will, 
by His divinely constituted author- 
ity, in a spirit of love, chasten us 
and call our attention to our short- 
comings, that we may repent and 
turn unto Him before it is too late. 

I believe in my heart that there is 
a disposition on the part of the 
whole people to receive the word of 
the Lord and to put it into practice 
in their lives. If we have been guil- 
ty in any way, we will repent sin- 
cerely, we will strive to do better in 
the future, and we will exert our in- 
fluence, with those over whom we 
preside, or with whom we can pos- 
sibly have influence. I will say for 
my brethren of the general authori- 
ties of the Church, we ought to re- 
ceive the instructions given in this 
conference. They apply not only to 
us as individuals, but as families. It 
is our duty to bring to bear on our 
families, our wives and children, 
that influence which shall also make 
them believe and rejoice to obey the 
word of God. These presidents of 
stakes and bishops of wards should 



82 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



not only be free from every manner 
of sin, themselves, free from every 
degree of evil, but they should set 
their houses in order; and their 
wives and their children should be 
obedient unto them, as thev are obe- 
dient unto the servants of God and 
unto our Father Himself. Their 
wives and children should obey the 
commandments of the Lord, walk 
in the paths of righteousness, obedi- 
ence, and peace, and set an example 
that would add strength to those 
who preside. If it is possible for us 
to avoid it, none of us should be 
found in the condition of Alma of 
old. He had to say to his son : Be- 
cause of your wickedness, because of 
your evil ways, my efforts in the 
preaching of righteousness have 
been neutralized, and I can do no 
good among the people who know 
you, because of your evil life; for 
they say : Go and set your own house 
in order, call your own son to re- 
pentance, correct his life, then come 
and teach us. That is the way I 
feel about it. I want those over 
whom I have influence, or authority 
and jurisdiction, not to obey me be- 
cause of any coercion or force 
brought to bear upon them, but to 
obey me in the same manner that I 
feel to obey the servants of the 
Lord, and the commandments of 
God. Because it is right and the 
requirements are just. I want them 
to be possessed of the good Spirit, 
that they will not only obey gladly, 
but that they will know for them- 
selves what spirit the instructions 
are of, so that when the servants of 
the Lord speak by the power and in- 
fluence of the Holy Spirit, they will 
know and understand because they 
themselves have the same spirit. 
They will obey because they love 
the Lord and they love the Lord's 



anointed. They will rejoice and, of 
their own free will and choice, will 
serve God and keep His command- 
ments. That is the condition that 
should exist in the families of all the 
authorities of the Church, both gen- 
eral and local. Their families are or 
ought to be, in this condition ; and 
then, as with the Priesthood, so 
with the people ; we will have great- 
er power, we will have greater in- 
fluence to overcome the evils that 
obtain in our midst, and be better 
able to resist these wicked and se- 
ducing spirits which preach to us 
the doctrines of devils and have de- 
ceived some. May we have power 
to reclaim those thus deceived and 
call all evil ones to repentance ; and 
if they will not repent, as we have 
read, leave them to the judgment of 
God. Our hope and feeling is that 
all may repent, and that sin and 
wickedness and evil of every name 
and nature may be done away. It 
cannot exist in a community which 
loves only purity and virtue and 
righteousness and whose every act 
proves that they love God with all 
their heart, might, mind, and 
strength, and that they love their 
neighbors as themselves. May the 
Lord be merciful to His people, in 
the name of Jesus. Amen. 

The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn: 

Praise to the man who communed with 
Jehovah ! 

Jesus anointed that Prophet and Seer, 
Blessed to open the last dispensation; 
Kings shall extol him and nations re- 
vere. 

Benediction was pronounced by 
Bishop David A. Smith. 

Conference adjourned until 2 
p. m.

AFTERNOON SESSION. 

Conference was resumed at 2 
p. m. 

President Francis M. Lyman 
called the meeting to order. 

The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn : 

Come, come, ye Saints, no toil nor labor 
fear, 

But with joy wend your way; 
Though hard to you this journey may 
appear, 

Grace shall be as your day. 

Prayer was offered by Elder Jos- 
eph E. Taylor. 

The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn: 

say, what is truth? Tis the fairest 

gem 

That the riches of worlds can pro- 
duce ; . 
And priceless the value of truth will be 
when 

The proud monarch's costliest diadem 
Is counted but dross and refuse. 

ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH. 

Blessings received only by obedience to 
l aw —Observance of Word of Wisdom 
will increase faith— Obedience to sim- 
ple laws qualifies for obedience to the 
higher. — Saloons closing in towns 
where Saints predominate. — Uplift 
mankind — make this land Zion. 

While I stand here this afternoon 

1 very much desire that the Lord 
will give me His Spirit, that the 
words I utter may be His words, for 
of myself I have nothing that I 
wish to say, I realize that the time 
is valuable, therefore I pray that 
the Lord will bless me that some- 
thing may be brought forth that 
will be profitable to this vast con- 
gregation. 

I rejoice that the President has 
been inspired to call our attention 



to section 89 of the Doctrine and 
Covenants, and to emphasize the 
importance of it to the Latter-day 
Saints. We are living in a da) 
when the Lord has spoken again 
to His people. We, who are mem- 
bers of the Church, who have com- 
plied with the requirements of our 
Father in Heaven, understand per- 
fectly that God lives and that He is 
a rewarder of those who diligently 
serve Him. We understand that He 
has given certain rules and regu- 
lations to govern us in this life, 
and obedience to His requirements 
insures us His pleasure, and the 
blessings promised will follow our 
obedience; but, if we fail to obey 
His teachings, if we ignore His 
wise counsels, then we have no 
promise from Him, and we are 
wasting opportunities that will not 
come to us again. I feel the im- 
portance of the Latter-day Saints 
observing this particular law. I 
believe that by obedience to it, 
much more faith may be enjoyed 
by the Latter-day Saints. We read 
in the teachings of Mormon that 
if there were not miracles wrought 
among that people it was because 
they did not have faith; and he 
told therri, 'further, that without 
faith, "awful was the state of man." 
If we violate the known will of the 
Lord it is natural that our faith will 
wane, for the Spirit will not always 
strive, with us. 

There is no blessing that the 
Latter-day Saints need that they 
may not enjoy. Our Father has 
established His work in this day: 
there is communication between the 
heavens and the earth, and the in- 
spiration of the Lord flows to His 
servants who are living righteous 
lives and complying with His re- 
quirements. There is no glorious 
thing, that man can rightly desire 
that we may not enjoy within the 



84 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



folds of the Kigdom of our Lord ; 
but if, as a people, when command- 
ments have been given to us, by 
Him, and we fail to observe them, 
then the promise is not to us, but it 
will be realized by those who are 
obedient. 

We are living upon what is com- 
monly designated by us as the Land 
of Zion. These great continents of 
North and South America, have 
been so named. Millions of God's 
children reside upon this favored 
land, and He has said that it shall 
be blessed as long as the inhabitants 
thereof keep His commandments 
and obey His laws; one of which 
is the Word of Wisdom. In our 
day the Gospel has been given — 
not that a few people might be 
magnified, but that the blessings ot 
our Father might be enjoyed by 
all His children, for He desires the 
salvation of each and every soul 
that has been born into the world. 
Unto you, my brethren and sisters, 
has come a knowledge that God 
lives. All doubt has passed from 
you, if you have complied with His 
requirements. You no longer feel, 
as some of our brethren and sisters 
of other faiths say, that you "hope" 
God lives, that you "hope" there 
will be eternal life for us. If you 
have done His will, if you have 
had faith, if you have repented of 
your sins, if you have been bap- 
tized by proper authority, by im- 
mersion, for the remission of those 
sins, and received the Holy Ghost 
by the laying on of hands, then do 
you know that God lives, that Jesus 
Christ was the Redeemer of the 
world, and that Joseph Smith was 
the instrument in the hands of our 
Father of establishing' this latter- 
dav dispensation. With that know- 
ledge in our hearts — which many 
of our brethren and sisters have not 
yet received — can we be recreant? 



As the sons of God, bearing the 
Priesthood, can we neglect the in- 
valuable opportunities that are plac- 
ed within our reach? Can we shut - 
our eyes to the glorious privileges 
that are unfolded to us by our 
Father in Heaven? Will we fail in 
keeping this simple commandment, 
a commandment that He has said is 
adapted to the capacity of the weak, 
or the weakest of all who are or can 
be called saints? I firmly believe 
that by reason of neglect of this 
simple requirement, faith has 
diminished in the hearts of some 
of our people. That, by a more gen- 
eral observance of the Word of 
Wisdom, faith will be increased 
among the Latter-day Saints, and 
greater knowledge will flow to us 
as a result ; for, by obedience to 
it, there will come a disposition to 
obey other laws of our Father, and 
compliance with each' insures a 
blessing. If this law, that is adapt- 
ed to the capacity of the weakest 
of us, is obeyed, it will be a foun- 
dation upon which may be added 
many great blesings that our Fath- 
er will be pleased to bestow, that 
otherwise we would not be entitled . 
to and could not receive. How can 
any of us feel justified in ignoring 
a simple law of God that He, by 
His own voice, has said any of 
us can obey? Can we ex- 
pect to be able to keep a higher law. 
and be able to attain great ex- 
altation, if we fail to keep this sim- 
ple requirement? 

I rejoice in being able to say that, 
as I travel among the people, I 
find a disposition to keep that coun- 
sel, given for our temporal salva- 
tion. Brother Anthony Ivins and 
I recently visited the Saint George 
Stake of Zion ; it was the last visit- 
ed, and for that reason I specially 
mention it. The president of that 
stake (comprising 22 wards) arose 



ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH. 



85 



in conference and announced to the 
people that he and his counselors, 
the members of the high council, 
and the bishops with their counse- 
lors all kept the Word of Wisdom, 
with the exception of two men. it 
so happened that, during our visit, 
we met the two men referred to. 
We explained to them the position 
they occupied, that, as leaders 
among the people, they were unable 
to teach the Word of Wisdom be- 
cause they were not themselves 
keeping it. In humility, and in a 
spirit of obedience to the desire of 
our Father they said : "We will 
make it unanimous, so far as this 
stake of Zion is concerned ; God 
being our helper we will put from 
us those things that He has forbid- 
den." If the stake presidency, high 
council and bishoprics of any 
stake will keep the Word of Wis- 
dom, and set their own houses in 
order, they will exert a powerful 
influence for good, that will be felt 
in the remotest parts of their field. 

Referring to the liquor saloon. 
Saint George has had a saloon, up 
to a few months ago, but the citi- 
zens concluded that it was too ex- 
pensive a luxury for that commun- 
ity. They decided that the morals 
and lives of their sons were worth 
more than the license money thai 
would flow to the city treasury, and 
the place was closed up. Since that 
time drunkenness in that city has. 
practically become a thing of the 
past, even to such an extent that 
during their County Fair, which 
was held prior to the Stake Con- 
ference, I was informed by one who 
was an officer there, that, in the 
multitude gathered, only two men 
were seen who gave any evidence 
that they were under the influence 
of liquor. The peace and order of 
the citv has been wonderfully im- 
proved ; and men and women who 



live there feel to thank their Father 
in Heaven, day by day, that they 
had wisdom and power sufficient 
to put away the thing that had been 
such a detriment to them. 

I take it for granted that all of 
us who voted to sustain the advice 
and counsel of our President, un- 
derstood what we were doing. That 
it did not mean only that we an. 
willing somebody else should do 
the work. My understanding of 
the obligation we assumed was that 
here,in the presence of our Heaven- 
ly Father, we agreed that all the 
influence we can exert will be used, 
on the right hand and upon the 
left, day and night, if need be, to 
purify the moral condition, and pre~ 
pare the way for a more whole- 
some condition among the citizens 
of this great land. We are not 
depriving man or woman of any 
blessing, when we withhold from 
them that which dethrones their 
reason and debases their lives. 
Brethren and sisters, the sisters 
particularly — God has blest you 
with power and influence, as he 
has blest we men; you have the 
franchise and should exercise it; 
and in love and kindness you should 
work for the uplifting of all ; in do- 
ing this there will flow to you joy 
and peace, by reason of the re- 
sults that will follow your efforts. 

This grand State of Utah ought 
not to be one of the last to stand for 
temperance, it ought to have been 
first, by reason of the revelation of 
our Father that has been given to 
the Latter-day Saints. If this body 
of men and women will keep the 
covenant that they made yesterday, 
it will be only a question of a little 
time until, from one end of this 
state to the other, temperance will 
abound, and there will be a change 
that shall conduce to the blessing 
of every man and woman that lives 



86 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



in our midst. I rejoice that these 
things have been taught to us in 
this conference. My soul is atune 
to the word that has gone forth; 
and as I looked into the faces of 
men and women in the congrega- 
tion yesterday, I realized that they, 
too, felt as I did, that it was a step 
in the right direction. 

This is the land of Zion, blessed 
above all other lands. Our Father 
has placed with the people the pow- 
er to make it the grandest of all 
nations upon the earth. He has 
helped to make it such, for verily I 
believe, today, no other nation un- 
der heaven is equal, in privileges, to 
the nation in which we live. God 
grant that we may not side-step. 
Ithat we may not back-step, but 
that, day by day, with our faces 
turned toward righteousness, we 
may go steadily onward, serving 
the Lord, keeping His command- 
ments, and fulfilling the require- 
ments that He has made of us. 
This is our Father's work. The land 
• hat we live in is blest above all 
other lands; God has decreed it — 
only so far, however, as the people 
upon it are righteous. He has given 
us the Gospel, which is the power 
of God unto salvation. It has been 
taught to us in plainness ; He has 
given us power to keep its laws ; He 
has given us tihe privilege of pro- 
claiming them ; He has broken 
down the barriers wherever the 
Gosoel has been proclaimed. Here 
in Zion, with hearts filled with joy 
and gratitude for the blessings we 
receive let us evidence, by our lives, 
that we do know that Jehovah is 
at fife head, that this is not the 
work of any man, but that it is the 
work of our Father. 

Mav the Lord strengthen us for 
our labor : may He au^lifv us for 
our ministry : Mav He give us 
strength to keep His commandments 



day by day; and may we seek to 
apply in our lives the glorious prin- 
ciples He has revealed, that by and 
by, from this portion of His vine- 
yard, may radiate peace and right- 
eousness, that others observing our 
good works, may be constrained to 
glorfy our Father in Heaven. May 
the Lord continue His blessings 
upon us; may those who have as- 
sembled here take to their homes 
the influence of this blessed occa- 
sion ; and, day by day, may we con- 
secrate our lives for the blessing 
and the benefit and the uplifting of 
our fellow-men, using the intelli- 
gence with which God has blest us 
to overcome evil and plant, in the 
place thereof, righteousness and 
truth, is my prayer, in the name of 
Jesus Christ. Amen. 



ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS. 

Temporal and spiritual welfare en- 
hanced, by observing Word of Wis- 
dom.— Love to do God's will should be 
the incentive to obedience.— The Sa- 
vior's great example of loving obedi- 
ence. — Splendid record in some wards 
and stakes. 

The spirit of this conference, as 
nearly as I am able to judge, is to 
create a sentiment among this peo- 
ple in favor of yielding more im- 
plicit obedience unto the word of the 
Lord ; as pertains to the keeping of 
the Word of Wisdom'. I do firmly 
believe that it will be fitting for men 
and women holding leading posi- 
tions in this church, to carry from 
this conference to their homes, in 
the stakes and wards of Zion and in 
the mission field, this sentiment, and 
that they should advocate it, and 
teach it to those under them — the 
ward teachers, the officers of the 
various quorums of Priesthood, and 
auxiliary organizations. The offi-

cers of the Church must see to it 
that they themselves observe this 
important Word of Wisdom, and 
then teach those over whom they 
preside to do likewise. They must 
follow this counsel up closely until 
they see the fruits of their labors. 

I am reminded that a few years 
ago, when the Church authorities 
discovered that the Church was 
greatly involved in debt, and they 
could see no opening, apparently, bv 
which they would soon be able to 
meet the obligations and liquidate 
the indebtedness, inspiration came 
to the President of the Church, and 
he saw that if the Latter-day 
Saints would pay their tithes there 
would be an abundance of means, 
in the storehouse of the Lord, with 
which to pay the debts and meet the 
current expenses of the Church. 
Therefore, a sentiment was created, 
and a wave passed over the people, 
a resolute determination that they 
would do their part well and faith- 
fully in the payment of their tithing, 
and the results were most gratify- 
ing. 

I am reminded, now, that since 
we received the word first in this 
conference from the President of 
the Church, the mouthpiece of the 
Lord unto us, all the servants of the 
Lord who have addressed us, or 
nearly all of them, have been in- 
spired to speak upon the same sub- 
ject. I do feel that we should put 
forth an effort, greater than we 
have ever done before, to make obe- 
dience to the Word of Wisdom uni- 
versal among us. If there are some 
who will complain that too much 
time of this conference has been 
given to a consideration of the 
Word of Wisdom, I will answer 
that no faithful Latter-day Saint, 
who has himself been yielding obe- 
dience to this requirement of the 



Lord, will make such complaint. 
Any person who speaks thus you 
may justly suspicion as not having 
observed this important revelation 
of the Lord. There are many rea- 
sons which might be assigned why 
we ought to observe to keep the 
Word of Wisdom', reasons which 
are common to those in and out of 
the Church. As a matter of individ- 
ual economy we ought to observe it. 
As a matter of national economy all 
men and women ought to observe 
it; also that the evil effects of the 
use of these things which are for- 
bidden may be obviated among the 
people. The evil effects of these 
forbidden things, on the system of 
the individual, ought to remind him. 
if he will stop to consider, that it is 
profitable for him to yield obedience 
unto this requirement, whether he is 
in the Church or out of it. 

Above and beyond all these rea- 
sons, and any others which 1 can 
think of, is that whicn appeals to 
the Latter-day Saints — that our 
Father in heaven has expressed it as 
His will that we do observe these 
laws. I would call your attention to 
a part of the second paragraph in 
the 89th section, which reads as fol- 
lows, referring to this revelation ; it 
"was given by revelation, and the 
word of wisdom, showing forth the 
order and will of God in the tem- 
poral salvation of all Saints in the 
last days." We have accepted Jos- 
eph Smith as the prophet, seer, and 
revelator of this last dispensation, 
and in doing so we accept these rev- 
elations as being the word of the 
Lord to us. Here the Lord ex- 
presses His will, in very plain terms, 
that this revelation is given "show- 
ing forth the order and will of God.' 
If for no other reason, this should 
be sufficient for any consistent Lat- 
ter-day Saint to induce him' to yield

implicit obedience unto this word. 
I can think of no gospel subject that 
will apply directly to more people 
among us as Latter-day Saints than 
this Word of Wisdom, unless it may 
be the principle of obedience, which 
includes yielding obedience unto 
this word ; or repentance, which also 
includes turning away from these 
things which are forbidden, and 
obeying the will of the Lord. In our 
onward march towards perfection 
we will not leave the first principles 
of the Gospel of the Master, but will 
continue to observe them. In the 
Church, we, the teachers, are placed 
for the express purpose of bringing 
the people up to a knowledge of the 
Son of God, showing them the way 
unto perfection. I desire to say 
here that we never can reach per- 
fection until we yield obedience un- 
to this simple word of the Lord. We 
are required to do the will of God, 
at any sacrifice. I have in mind the 
word of the Lord upon this sub- 
ject, contained in the revelations : 
"Let no man be afraid to lay down 
his life for my sake ; for whoso lay- 
eth down his life for my sake, shall 
find it again, and whoso is not will- 
ing to lay down his life for my sake 
is not my disciple." We are not 
asked now, my brethren and sisters, 
to lay down our lives to show our 
obedience to the Lord, and our 
worthiness to be His disciples, but 
we are asked by the Lord to abstain 
from the use of strong drinks and 
tobacco, in every form, also to ab- 
stain from the use of meats to ex- 
cess. This is a simple requirement. 
How can we hope to have faith to 
lay down our lives, how can we 
claim to be willing to do so, while 
our lives and actions, every day, 
show to our neighbors and to the 
Lord that we are not willing to rid 
ourselves of the use of strong drink 



or tobacco- — those things which are 
forbidden of the Lord? Let us be 
consistent with ourselves and our 
professions of faith. 

I am reminded of the great war- 
fare that was carried on in heaven, 
while we existed in the spirit, of 
which we read in the revelations of 
John, given upon the Isle of Pat- 
mos, and more clearly explained in 
the revelations of the Lord to 
Moses, as found in the Pearl of 
Great Price. The account states 
that, when Lucifer rebelled against 
the Father and drew away a third of 
heaven's hosts, that great general, 
the First Born of God our Father, 
in the spirit and Who was the Only 
Begotten of the Father in the flesh, 
stepped forward and, in contradis- 
tinction to the demands made by 
Lucifer, that God our Father should 
give to Him His honor, which 
means His glory and His power and 
authority, the First Born said: 
"Father, Thy will be done, and the 
glory be Thine forever." That is 
the true spirit of the Gospel, the 
spirit that every Latter-day Saint 
ought to possess, no matter what 
the requirement may be. Do you 
not think that Jesus, when He made 
that declaration, had some concep- 
tion of the requirements that would 
be made upon Him? I think so. We 
are told expressly, in the scripture, 
that He was the Lamb slain from 
before the foundation of the world ; 
and I believe that when He made 
that remark to the Father, He did 
not intend it to apply merely to the 
warfare in which they engaged in 
the spiritual existence., but that it 
was to continue in all His work per- 
taining to the salvation and eternal 
life of the children of men, which 
involved His mortal existence here 
upon the earth. As you will ob- 
serve in the reading of the scrip-

tures, that spirit characterized, more 
than anything else, the life and la- 
bors, the testimony and teachings of 
our Savior. In the midst of His 
direct sorrow and suffering, when 
He endured such agony that it is 
said of Him that He sweat, as it 
were, great drops of blood — in the 
midst of it all He said, "Oh, Father, 
if it be Thy will, let this cup pass, 
but Thy will, and not mine, be 
done." That is the spirit. When 
Adam was cast out of the garden of 
Eden, as we read in the revelations 
of the Lord to Moses, found in the 
Pearl of Great Price, he was com- 
manded to build an altar and make 
offerings to the Lord, the firstlings 
of his flock, those that were without 
blemish, and he did as he was re- 
quired. After a time, an angel ap- 
peared to Adam and said : "Adam, 
why do you do this thing?" Adam' 
answered, "I know not, save God 
has commanded me." That should 
be a sufficient reason for obeying ev- 
ery commandment that our Father 
has given unto us. It ought only to 
be necessary that it be known by us 
that the Father wills it so, to incite 
us to go straightway and perform 
our duties, and live by the law ; we 
have his promise that He will help 
us. How was it with Abraham, 
when he was called upon to offer his 
son Isaac, in whom he had hope of a 
numerous posterity of honorable 
men and women ? The Lord required 
that he take his son three days' jour- 
ney into the mountain, and upon a 
place which should be indicated to 
him he was to slay his son, offer him 
as an offering to the Lord. All his 
hopes would thereby be blighted, 
yet we have no account that Abra- 
ham said to the Father : Why am I 
required to do this ? I warrant you 
that Abraham made no such argu- 
ment with the Lord, nor did he 



plead with Him to know the whys 
and wherefores ; but he went and of- 
fered his son, virtually offered him, 
and it was accepted of the Lord. It 
was sufficient for Abraham to know 
that God had commanded it ; and 
why should not the same be sufficient 
for us? If we are consistent, any- 
thing that the Lord expresses to us 
as His will, whether it be by written 
revelation or through the mouths of 
His servants in whom we have con- 
fidence, and whom we sustain, when 
we know what the will of the Lord 
is, and we fail to do it, with all our 
mind, might, and strength, we are 
under condemnation before the 
Lord, and are not acting according 
to the light He has given us. 

I am very thankful for the knowl- 
edge I have of the faithfulness of 
the Latter-day Saints generally, in 
yielding obedience to this word of 
the Lord. In one stake of Zion it 
was reported to me, by the presi- 
dent of the stake, that every offi- 
cer in all the organizations and 
wards of the stake, observed to keep 
the Word of Wisdom, except a very 
few who had given him their word 
that they would observe it in the fu- 
ture. I have found, as I remember 
now, a stake president of primary 
associations, in one of our stakes 
here on the east, in reporting her or- 
ganization, made the statement that 
out of ninety officers engaged in 
primary work in the stake, including 
the ward officers, eighty-nine of 
them were strictly observing the 
Word of Wisdom. I remember, 
too, the report made by a superin- 
tendent of the Young Men's associ- 
ations in one of our stakes, in wjjich 
he made the statement that all the 
Mutual Improvement officers in the 
wards and stake, excepting two, 
were observing that law. We often 
hear such reports, during our trav-

els among the people. There are 
thousands to whom this word does 
not come as a reproof, yet there are 
too many, by far, who have disre- 
garded this word of the Lord. It 
is time, my brethren and sisters, 
that we begin to comply with these 
smaller things, things that are most 
easily complied with, that we may 
prepare and school ourselves for the 
greater requirements that may be 
made upon us in this Church. 

May the Lord help us to be faith- 
ful in this and in all things in the 
keeping of His commandments, that 
we rmy receive the promised bless 
ing of eternal life, I pray, in Jesus' 
name. Amen.

I hope that my voice, which is 
somewhat disabled by a cold, will 
permit me to speak what is in my 
heart. 

It is about two thousand years, 
according to our accepted chronol- 
ogy, since the Lord Jesus Christ 
died on Calvary, since He commis- 
sioned twelve apostles and other sev- 
enty and sent them' forth to preach 
the Gospel to every creature. It is 
over one hundred years since the 
Prophet Joseph Smith came into 
the world to restore the Gospel, 
from which the world had departed. 



It is seventy-eight years since the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints was organi^d, and 
Mormonism — so-called — has been 
preached among the nations during 
that time. 

The question uppermost in my 
mind today is this : Has the world 
been benefited by what the Lord has 
done ? Is it growing better or worse 
as a result of the efforts put forth 
by the God of Heaven for the sal- 
vation of mankind? I think there 
can be but one answer to such a 
question. I am a believer in the pro- 
gress of the human race. I believe 
that the world, in spite of its wick- 
edness, its opposition to the truth, 
and its hatred of the people and the 
cause of God, is six thousand years 
nearer to perfection than when 
Adam fell from the Garden of 
Eden. I believe that this Church, 
in spite of its derelictions, its diso- 
bedience to some of the require- 
ments of the Gospel, its neglect of 
some of the principles revealed 
from heaven for the perfecting of 
the Saints and for the salvation of 
all people — I believe that this 
Church, in spite of its errors of 
omission and commission, is in a 
better condition today than it has 
ever been. I cannot consistently 
take any other view, and yet I know 
that there is great room for im- 
provement. The present condition, 
however superior to the conditions 
of the past, furnishes no argument 
to justify stagnation and stand-still. 

The Apostle Paul exhorted the 
Church in his day to be progressive. 
In his epistle to the Hebrews he 
says : "Therefore, leaving the prin- 
ciples of the doctrine of Christ, let 
us go on to perfection; not laying 
again the foundation of repentance 
from dead works, and of faith to- 
ward God, of the dodrine of bap-

91 



tism, and of laying on of hands, 
and of resurrection of the dead, and 
of eternal judgment." Paul, of 
course, did not mean that any prin- 
ciple of the gospel should be aban- 
doned or put upon the shelf. There 
never will come a time when faith 
will not be essential to salvation. It 
is one of the greatest of principles, 
and although it comes first, it is no 
small or trivial thing. There never 
will come a time when repentance 
will not be necessary, so long as 
men sin and depart from God. The 
Apostle did not mean that the 
Church, in its progress to perfec- 
tion, should leave these principles 
behind, as having no further use for 
them; though that construction 
might be put upon his words, if the 
letter be taken without the spirit. 
Hence the Prophet Joseph Smith, in 
revising the scriptures, saw proper 
to insert the word "not" in that 
very injunction of the Apostle Paul, 
making it read : "Therefore, not 
leaving the principles of the doc- 
trine of Christ, let us go on to per- 
fection." It was a plea for progress, 
but not a license to lay aside as a 
thing that had outlived its useful- 
ness, any principle of salvation. 

The work of the Lord is always 
progressive. There has been pro- 
gress in the world from the begin- 
ning ; not in every part, not in every 
particular, but in the general trend 
of human affairs as manipulated by 
Divinity. God has not been thwart- 
ed in the work that He set out to 
perform — the redemption and even- 
tual perfection of the world that He 
created. The lives and labors of 
the patriarchs, from Adam to Abra- 
ham; of the prophets, from Moses 
to Christ; and of all good men and 
women who have figured in history 
before and since that time — these 
have not been in vain. Noah's mis- 



sion did not fail, though the ante- 
diluvian world went down to death 
for rejecting his testimony. 
Through Noah the truth was per- 
petuated and the earth repeopled af- 
ter the flood. I cannot conceive that 
the Son of God could die to lift up 
fallen humanity and nothing but de- 
generacy and degradation result. I 
cannot conceive that a man like 
Joseph Smith could live, or that 
such a religion as "Mormonism" 
could be preached in the world for 
upwards of seventy years, and man- 
kind not be benefited thereby. It is 
perfectly apparent to those who see 
aright that the doctrines taught by 
Joseph Smith have permeated soci- 
ety, have modified the religious 
creeds of men, and are acting as a 
leaven upon the world at large. 

I was once conversing with a 
Christian minister, who said that he 
did not understand the position tak- 
en by the Latter-day Saints toward 
the good works that were being 
done by other religious organiza- 
tions and by philanthropic and pro- 
gressive agencies in general. "You 
have an article of faith," said he, 
"which commits you to the admira- 
tion of and search after every thing 
that is virtuous and praiseworthy." 
The article referred to is as fol- 
lows : "We believe in being honest, 
true, chaste, benevolent, virtuous, 
and in doing good to all men; in- 
deed, we may say that we follow 
the admonition of Paul; we believe 
all things, we hope all things; we 
have endured many things, and 
hope to be able to endure all things. 
If there is anything virtuous, lovely, 
or of good report, or praiseworthy, 
we seek after these things." Said 
this gentleman, "That being one of 
your articles of faith, I cannot un- 
derstand why you take no account 
of the good that is being done out-

side of your own community. Here 
we are, retranslating the scriptures, 
endeavoring to make them more 
perfect, more accurate, and you take 
no interest in it. We are uncover- 
ing buried cities and civilizations, 
deciphering ancient monuments and 
manuscripts, and you account it of 
little or no worth. We are found- 
ing hospitals and reformatories, 
sending missionaries to the ends of 
the earth, establishing missions and 
charities, pleading for justice, kind- 
ness, peace and progress — and you 
take no stock in what we are do- 

tag." 

I answered that he was very much 
in error in his supposition. And I 
think that the gentleman would 
have modified his opinion had he 
been present here yesterday when 
President Joseph F. Smith, during 
his splendid discourse upon the 
Word of Wisdom, gave a most 
hearty endorsement to the great 
temperance movement that is roll- 
ing like a mighty billow over the 
land; when Heber J. Grant, one of 
the apostles of the Church, present- 
ed a resolution, which was unani- 
mously and enthusiastically adopt- 
ed, pledging this great people to an 
effort to secure legislation for the 
closing of saloons and the discour- 
agement of the liquor traffic ; when 
the president of the apostles, Elder 
Francis M. Lyman, feelingly com- 
mended the good work that is being 
done by enterprising and benevo- 
lent men in all countries. Had my 
ministerial friend been present this 
morning, he would have heard an- 
other apostle, John Henry Smith, 
fresh from the National Irrigation 
Congress at Albuquerque, New 
Mexico, utter similar sentiments, 
reminding us that we are one in 
sympathy and friendship with all 
agencies that have as their object 



the betterment of mankind, whether 
in the redemption of these arid 
wastes, the success of the great 
temperance cause, the safeguarding 
of morality, or the correction of evil 
in any form. The gentleman would 
have found that the Latter-day 
Saints stand by their articles of 
faith, and that Mormonism be- 
friends every good cause, every 
high enterprise started by any peo- 
ple in any part of the world. And 
why not? Many of these move- 
ments are the fruits of the preach- 
ing of "Mormonism" among the na- 
tions, while others are the fruits of 
Christianity, w 7 hich, in its purity, 
from our point of view, was only 
the "Mormonism" of an earlier day. 

Let me now present a few para- 
graphs from an article by a schol- 
arly and learned divine, Dr. Henry 
Van Dyke, who, in his admirable 
essay, "Is the World Growing Bet- 
ter ?" says : 

"No man knows of a certainty the an- 
swer to this question. If it were an in- 
quiry into the condition of the world's 
pocket book, or farm, or garden, or ma- 
chine-house, or library, or school-room, 
the answer would be easy. Six million 
more spindles whirling in the world's 
workshop in 1903 than in 1900; eight 
hundred million more bushels of wheat 
in the world's grain-fields than in 1897 : 
an average school attendance gaining 145 
per cent, between 1840 and 1888, while 
the population of Europe increased only 
33 per cent. So the figures run in every 
department. No doubt the world is 
busier, richer, better fed, and probably it 
knows more than ever before. * * * 
But is it growing better? That is an- 
other question, and a far more important 
one * * * I asked John Friendly, 
the other day, 'Do you think the world 
is growing better? 'Certainly,' said he, 
with a smile like sunrise on his honest 
face, 'I haven't the slightest doubt of it.' 
But what makes you so sure of it? 
'Why, it must be so ! Look at all the 
work that is being done today to edu- 
cate people and help them into better 



ELDER ORSON E. WHITNEY. 



93 



ways of living. All this effort must 
count for something. The wagon must 
move with so many horses pulling at it. 
The world can't help growing better !" 

Then he left me to go down to a meet- 
ing of his 'Citizens' Committee for the 
Application of the Social Boycott to Po- 
litical Offenders' (which frequently ad- 
journs without a quorum). Immediately 
afterwards, I passed the door of the 
'Michael T. Moriarty Republicratic 
Club' — wide open and crowded. On my 
way up the avenue I saw a liquor sa- 
loon on every block — and all busy. The 
news-stands were full of placards an- 
nouncing articles in the magazines — ■ 
"Graft in Chicago," "The Criminal Cal- 
endar of Millionaires," "St. Louis, the 
Bribers' Paradise," "The Plunder of 
Philadelphia." Headlines in the yellow 
journals told of "Immense Slaughter in 
Manchuria," "Russia Ripe for Revolu- 
tion," "The Black Hand Terror in the 
Bronx," "Gilded Gambling Dens of the 
Four Hundred," "Diamonds and Di- 
vorce." 

"John Friendly's cheerful a priori con- 
fidence in the betterment of the world 
seemed to need reinforcement. Some of 
the horses are pulling his way, no doubt, 
but a good many appear to be pulling the 
other way. Under such conditions the 
wagon might stick fast or go backward; 
possibly it might be pulled to pieces. 
Who can measure, in the abstract, the 
comparative strength of the good and 
evil forces? Who can tell, beforehand, 
which way the tug of war will go ?" 

Dr. Van Dyke then goes on to 
show that there are three main 
points of goodness — justice, kind- 
ness, and self-restraint. A man is 
said to be growing better when he 
is becoming more just, and careful 
to do the right thing; more kind, 
and ready to do the helpful thing; 
more self-controlled, and willing to 
sacrifice his personal will to the 
general welfare. The doctor de- 
clares his belief that the modern 
world, in two of these important di- 
rections, manifests a great improve- 
ment over the ancient world. He 
reminds us that in order to arrive at 
anything approaching a correct con- 



clusion in the premises, we must be 
willing to take a long view and a 
wide view. "What we have to look 
at is not the local exception, nor the 
temporary reaction, but the broad 
field as far as we can see it, the gen- 
eral movement as far as we can 
trace it;" and taking that view, it 
seems to him that the world is re- 
ally growing better; "not in every 
eddy, but in the main current of its 
life ; not in a straight line, but with 
a winding course; not in every re- 
spect, but in at least two of the 
three main points of goodness." 

To illustrate the growth of jus- 
tice, he cites the fact that in Shake- 
speare's time a woman was looked 
upon as a mere piece of property. 
She belonged to her husband ; he 
could beat her with impunity; he 
could deprive her of the guardian- 
ship of her children ; the very pres- 
ents that he gave her were still his 
property, for she could hold nothing 
in her own right. But all that has 
been changed; woman today is a 
person in the light of the law; she 
can hold property for herself, and 
can share equally with her husband 
in the guardianship of her children. 
The wife-beater is now punished as 
a criminal. "Surely," says our au- 
thor, "it is an immense gain in jus- 
tice that woman should be treated 
as a human being." He holds that 
not only is woman rising among 
those nations that lead the march of 
civilization, but that even in Mo- 
hammedan and in heathen countries 
her cause is gaining ground. 

In the same way he interprets the 
laws that protect the young against 
cruelty, oppression, and injustice, 
citing the Factory Act of 1833 and 
the Mines and Collieries Act of 
1842 in England as examples of a 
steadily-increasing effort since that 
time to diminish and prevent the 



94 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



degradation of the race by the en- 
slavement of childhood to labor. 
Moreover, it is now regarded as un- 
just to deal with young delinquents 
as if they were old and hardened 
criminals. "No more herding of 
children ten and twelve years old in 
the common jail ! Juvenile courts 
and probation officers, asylums and 
reformatories; an intelligent and 
systematic effort to reclaim the 
young life before it has fallen into 
hopeless bondage to crime ; this is 
the spirit of the civilized legislation 
of today. In 1903 no less than ten of 
the American states enacted special 
statutes with this end in view." 

The abolition of ancient and med- 
ieval methods of judicial torture — 
such as the rack and the thumb- 
screw — and the abandonment of 
brutal and degrading methods of 
execution are also mentioned : Crim- 
inals are no longer impaled, cruci- 
fied, disemboweled, or buried alive; 
and capital punishment, which was 
formerly inflicted for stealing and for 
forgery, is now confined to the two 
great crimes of murder and treason. 
Some things that were once punish- 
able are no longer prosecuted, such 
as heresy, witchcraft, religious non- 
conformity; and, on the other hand, 
new offenses have been created 
that were formerly ignored, such as 
the adulteration of foods, gambling, 
the violation of laws in restraint of 
the liquor traffic, selling cigarettes 
to children, tapping electric wires, 
disfiguring the landscape with ad- 
vertisements or printing them on the 
American flag, making combina- 
tions in restraint of trade, sleeping 
in a public bakery, spitting on the 
floor of a street-car. "A large part 
of what appears to be the increase 
of crime in recent years (according 
to statistics), is due to this new defi- 
nition of misdemeanors. * * * 



Another part comes from the great- 
er efficiency in the execution of the 
laws and the greater completeness 
in the tabulation of reports. * * * 
Pike's History of Crime in England 
estimates that in the fourteenth cen- 
tury murders were at least sixteen 
times as frequent as in our own 
day." 

The learned doctor also refers to 
the abolition of the slave trade, the 
establishment of international law, 
the granting of copyrights to for- 
eign authors, and the purchase, by 
the United States government, of 
the lands owned by the Spanish 
friars in the Philippines, instead of 
the confiscation of those lands, 
which would have been the rule a 
hundred years ago. These and other 
acts are cited as evidences that the 
spirit of justice is growing among 
men and nations. 

In regard to the increase of kind- 
ness in the human race, he thinks 
that the evidence is even more clear 
and strong. "There are more peo- 
ple in the world who love mercy, 
and they are having better success 
in making their spirit prevail. More 
is being done today to prevent and 
mitigate human suffering, to shelter 
and protect the weak and helpless, 
to minister wisely to the sick and 
wounded in body and in mind, than 
ever before in the history of man- 
kind." The work begun by John 
Howard a hundred and thirty years 
ago, which has done so much to 
cleanse away the shame of a cruel, 
filthy and irrational prison system, 
is given prominent mention. Our 
author affirms that since the middle 
of the nineteenth century charity 
has grown twice as fast as wealth 
in England, and three times as fast 
in France. In the United States 
the amount of the larger gifts 
($5,000 or more) rose from $29,-

000,000 in 1893 to $107,000,000 in 
1901. And "with all this increase 
of money comes an equal increase of 
care and thought in regard to the 
best way of using it for the real 
benefit of mankind. Reckless alms- 
giving is recognized as an amiable 
but idiotic form of self-indulgence. 
The penny dropped into the beg- 
gar's hat gives place to an inquiry 
into the beggar's condition. * 
* * * * * * * Schools of 
philanthropy are established to 
study and teach the economy of 
generosity. Asylums are investi- 
gated and supervised. Relief funds 
are intrusted to responsible com- 
mittees, who keep books and ren- 
der accounts." 

Upon the broad theme of interna- 
tional mercy, the doctor states that 
since the days of Abraham there 
have been three hundred and fifty 
great famines in various parts of the 
world, but, he asks, who ever heard, 
before the nineteenth century began, 
of any of the hungry nations receiv- 
ing help from the outside? "Now, 
within a week after the distress is 
known, money, food, and help of all 
kinds begin to flow in from all quar- 
ters of the globe." The Hague 
tribunal is referred to as an effort to 
get rid of the hell of war, or at least 
to mitigate its horrors and torments, 
and comparison is made between 
modern and ancient methods of con- 
ducting war. "Let any man," he 
says, "read the story of the siege 
and sack of a town in Holland by 
the Spanish soldiers, as it is given 
in Motley's 'Dutch Republic,' and 
compare it with the story of the cap- 
ture of Paris in 1870, or even the 
taking of Pekin in 1900, and he will 
understand that war itself has felt 
the restraining touch of mercy." 
"Not one of the great nations of 



the world today would dare to pro- 
claim a war in the name of Reli- 
gion." 

Our author then comes to the 
third factor of real betterment — self 
restraint. In justice and kindness, 
the world, he believes, is becoming 
better, but in the matter of self re- 
straint, the willingness to sacrifice 
one's own passion and pleasure for 
the good of others, he says : 

"Here, I confess, my guessing is con- 
fused and troubled. There was a vast 
improvement from the fourteenth to the 
nineteenth century, but whether the 
twentieth century is carrying on the ad- 
vance seems uncertain. * * * The 
theory of individual liberty threatens to 
assert itself in dangerous forms. Litera- 
ture and art are throwing their enchant- 
ments around the old lie that life's high- 
est value is found in moments of intense 
self-gratification. Speed is glorified re- 
gardless of direction; strength is wor- 
shiped at the expense of reason. Success 
is deified as the power to do what one 
likes. Gilding covers a multitude of sins. 
On the one hand, we have a so-called 
'upper class' which says : the world was 
made to amuse me ; nothing else matters. 
On the other hand we have an apparent 
increase of the criminal class, which lives 
at war with the social order. Corpora- 
tions and labor unions engage in a strug- 
gle so fierce that the rights and interests 
of the community are forgotten by both 
parties. In our own country, lynching— 
which is organized murder for unproved 
offenses — grows more common. Divorces 
increase to 60,000 in one year; and there 
is an epidemic of shocking accidents and 
disasters, greater than any hitherto re- 
corded, and due, apparently, to the spirit 
of unrestraint and recklessness which is 
sweeping furiously in its motor car along 
the highways of modern life. 

"Is this selfish and headlong spirit 
growing? Will it continue to accelerate 
the pace at which men live, and dimin- 
ish the control by which they are guided ? 
Will it weaken more and more the bonds 
of reverence and mutual consideration 
and household fidelity and civic virtue, 
until the states which have been civilized 
by the sanctions of love and the convic-

tions of duty are whirled backward by 
the passion of self-indulgence into the 
barbarism of luxurious pleasure or the 
anarchy of social strife?" 

He concludes that it is neither 
brave nor wise to give these trou- 
blesome questions an answer of de- 
spair. Two are stronger than one, 
and if the world has grown more 
just and more kind, we can reason- 
ably trust that in the long run it 
will improve in the matter of self- 
restraint, and the selfish, reckless 
spirit will be overcome. 

This seems to me a very intelli- 
gent and comprehensive view. I 
thought of it while President Smith 
was speaking yesterday, when he 
declared that his motive for present- 
ing the Word of Wisdom was the 
fact that it was more neglected than 
any other revelation which God had 
given to this people. Right in line, 
you see, with the argument of this 
learned man, that in the matter of 
self-restraint there is a laxity, even 
among those who are otherwise just 
and kind — not just, not kind to 
themselves, however. And in this 
spirit of self-indulgence, this un- 
willingness to curb and control the 
passions, there lurks a danger that 
threatens the disruption of society. 
It behooves every good man and 
every good woman to stand in a 
solid phalanx against any tendency 
that imperils the happiness of the 
human race and nullifies in any de- 
gree, the good that is being done in 
the interests of temperance, virtue 
and philanthropy. 

One more thought and I will con- 
clude. I wish to recur to a question 
propounded by Dr. Van Dyke in the 
fore part of his interesting essay : 
"Who can measure, in the abstract, 
the comparative strength of the 
good and evil forces? Who can 



tell, beforehand, which way the tug 
of war must go?" 

I can, and you can ; every soul il- 
lumined by the Holy Ghost can tell 
what will be the inevitable outcome. 
If God and Satan are pulling 
against each other, what will hap- 
pen must be plain to every reverent, 
thoughtful mind. The issue is not in 
doubt. God will not be mocked; 
Omnipotence will not be defeated. 
While He allows the agency of man 
and the agency of Satan their full 
play, never at any time has He 
given to man or to Satan the power 
to destroy His work or prevent the 
fulfillment of His predestined pur- 
pose. Strength will prevail over 
weakness. Truth will triumph over 
error. No matter what trials and 
persecutions the cause of Christ 
may have to undergo before its vic- 
tory is assured, the final outcome 
will be glorious. Christ will com- 
plete His work; the righteous will 
be saved ; the wicked, damned ; and 
the world will attain perfection. 

"Truth forever on the scaffold ; 
Wrong forever on the throne; 
Yet that scaffold sways the future, 
And behind the dim unknown, 
Standeth God within the shadow, 
Keeping watch above His own." 



PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 

Gratifying evidences of faith of the 
Saints. — Blessings invoked on those 
devoted to God's work. 

We feel to give to God praise 
and gratitude from our hearts for 
the manifest interest shown by you, 
the Latter-day Saints, the people of 
the Church of Jesus Christ of Lat- 
ter-day Saints, in this semi-annual 



PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 



97 



conference. During the inclement 
weather of yesterday this building 
was filled to overflowing, and over- 
flow meetings were held in the As- 
sembly Hall and in the Barrattt 
Hall, and the Spirit of the Lord was 
enjoyed richly by all who heard. We 
thank you and the Lord will bless 
you, my brethren and sisters, for 
your devotion to His cause, for your 
love for His truth, for your union 
and fellowship toward those who 
are called to labor in your midst 
and to preside over you in the vari- 
ous organizations of the Church. I 
feel in my heart to say not only God 
bless you, but as I may exercise my 
own right as a witness of the Lord 
Jesus and as an apostle of Jesus 
Christ, I bless you with all my soul, 
because you love the truth, and you 
manifest it. There is nothing in 
God's world that draws men and 
women so near to my heart as that 
they love the truth and that they 
love God, that they love the cause of 
Zion and are devoted to the inter- 
ests of the Church. This endears 
men and women to my heart ; I love 
them when they love this work and 



when they show their interest in it. 
It lifts my soul to heaven and fills 
it with joy unspeakable. 

God bless you in your bodies, in 
your minds, in your labors, in your 
homes, in all your positions and, 
above all things, pour out upon you 
His Spirit that you may rejoice 
more and more abundantly in God's 
glorious work that He is inaugurat- 
ing in the world in the latter day. 
Peace be to you and all that pertains 
to you and to the kingdom of God, 
is my prayer, in the name of Jesus. 
Amen. 

The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn : 

The Spirit of God like a fire is burning ! 
The latter-day glory begins to come 
forth ; 

The visions and blessings of old are re- 
turning, 

And angels are coming to visit the . 
earth. 

Benediction was pronounced by 
Elder Seymour B. Young. 

Conference adjourned until 10 a. 
m., Tuesday, Oct. 6th. 



THIRD DAY. 



Tuesday, Oct. 6th, 10 a. m. 

Conference was called to order by 
President Joseph F. Smith. 

The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn : 

Redeemer of Israel, our only delight, 

On whom for a blessing we call, 
Our shadow by day, and our pillar by 
night, 

Our King, our Deliv'rer, our all ! 

Prayer was offered by Elder Ger- 
man E. Ellsworth. 

The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn : 

. For the strength of the hills we bless 
Thee, 

Our God, our fathers' God ; 
Thou hast made Thy children mighty, 
By the touch of the mountain sod. 



ELDER JOHN G. MdTJARRIE. 

(Late President Eastern States Mission.) 

In traveling through this uneven 
country of ours, whenever we reach 
any summits in the road, whether 
they be high or low, we instinctive- 
ly stop to take our bearings ; we 
want to determine where we are and 
what progress we have made, and 
allow our eyes to look as far as 
possible along the path or road 
that we are following. There is a 
striking analogy between such 
movements and our movements up- 
on this mysterious current we call 
"time." There are periods in the 
lives of individuals, also of com- 
munities and organizations, when 



they instinctively stop to take their 
bearings, and try to determine what 
course they are taking, which way 
they are moving, and what progress 
they have made. 

Only a short time ago, as a peo- 
ple, we were standing upon the 
summit of a century, reckoning 
time from the birth of our Prophet, 
Seer and Revelator, and the organ- 
izer of the Church in this last great 
dispensation. Standing upon that 
summit, it is probable that no line of 
history, from the creation to the 
present, affords such a splendid 
view or such a grand chain of im- 
portant events, that stretches from 
the White Mountains of Vermont to 
the shores of the Great Salt Lake ; 
also, when we turn to observe the 
stream of life and truth, and knowl- 
edge, that has been flowing in upon 
us, beaming upon the world, there 
is nothing in all the history of reve- 
lation to compare with it. In no par- 
ticular period of the world has 
there been such a rapid increase of 
knowledge and intelligence and 
power; and there have been many 
important events, revelations, man- 
ifestations of the presence and pow- 
er of God which even exceed that 
of the transfiguration, for in this 
dispensation, both the Father and 
the Son appeared to introduce this 
great "marvelous work and a won- 
der," with which we have the honor 
and the privilege of being connected 
or united. 

I was reading an article written 
by one of the faculty of the Colum- 
bia College, in relation to the teach- 



ELDER JOHN G. McQUARRIE. 



99 



ing of theology in the schools. He 
felt that we really needed and must 
have some kind of religion, some 
kind of ethical and moral teaching, 
but the problem that seemed to con- 
front them was this, not only the 
wide diversity of opinions between 
the Jew and the Christian, and be- 
tween the various sects of Christi- 
anity, but the question was wheth- 
er they had any real underlying 
principles of theology that they 
mifht make coherent with the prin- 
ciples of science, and whether they 
were prepared, at this time, to sub- 
mit to a careful and thorough an- 
alysis the principles of religion, the 
dogmas that were being taught, and 
whether they would stand the same 
critical examination that other prin- 
ciples of truth might stand. In sub- 
mitting and bringing these in con- 
tact with each other, there was the 
question as to whether it would real- 
ly develop or shatter the faith of the 
students whose minds they were 
trying to instill with a love of God 
and belief in a divine Creator. When 
I read this I thought, how grateful 
we should be, as Latter-day Saints, 
that we have had revealed unto us 
principles of truth which are coher- 
ent with all other principles of truth, 
and that thev will readily fit in with 
any knowledge that may be revealed 
to us, either from the heavens above 
or from the earth beneath — any- 
thin^ that we can gain from astron- 
omy or from geology or from any of 
the other manifestations of God's 
creation ;we may be assured that they 
will not run counter to the divine 
ethical and moral truths and princi- 
ples which He has revealed unto us. 

In a summary published in one of 
our scientific journals, this state- 
ment was made, that perhaps the 
greatest discovery of the nineteenth 
century, after summing up all, was 



that there is no place, space, or 
condition that is beyond the imper- 
ial dominion of law. This is only a 
rather faint way, or another way, of 
expressing the information received 
in a revelation given through Joseph 
Smith, to the effect that there is no 
space without a kingdom, and no 
kingdom without space, no kingdom 
without law; and that all things 
were created, controlled and devel- 
oped in harmony with law ; and also 
that there was a law irrevocably de- 
creed in heaven uoon which every 
blessing was predicated. If this lit- 
tle bit of information had been un- 
derstood by the teachers of philos- 
ophy and theology, down through 
the centuries, what a wonderful dif- 
ference it would have made in the 
establishment of truth in the world. 

The theory of Darwin, in relation 
to evolution, has perhaps destroyed 
the faith of more people than any- 
thing else; it seemed to run so di- 
rectly counter to the interpretation 
placed upon the Scriptures, by those 
at least whose business seemed to 
be to interpret these Scriptures. 
But a short time before Darwin, 
and Huxley, and Spencer marshal- 
ed their arguments and hurled them 
against what was then considered to 
be the battlements of divine truth, 
we received a revelation, through 
the Prophet, in relation to the prob- 
lem and mystery of life. In this 
revelation the statement Was made 
that the principle of life was not 
created but always and eternally ex- 
isted, like the principles of chemis- 
try and other eternal laws or prin- 
ciples of power. A great French 
scientist, in an article lately pub- 
lished, said that the Darwin theory 
was built up without one single ex- 
ample to prove it, that there was 
not one individual example where 
one species had really been changed 



100

into another. He concludes his ar- 
ticle with a statement like this, that 
we cannot successfully resist any 
hypothesis in relation to the origin 
of living things, but it is only a step 
in advance to conclude that life in 
itself existed separate and apart 
from this earth, and anterior to our 
world, and, like the principles of 
chemistry and other things, that it 
probably always existed. I felt 
grateful that I might receive, even 
in my Sunday school teaching, a 
true knowledge of the origin and 
purpose of life, without having, per- 
haps, to reach it through all these 
difficult and uncertain methods. 

I know that through their the- 
ories they have discovered a great 
many truths, but how much better it 
would have been if they could have 
started, at first, from a true hypo- 
thesis in relation to this great law, 
or these rules which have been re- 
vealed to us for the preservation, 
the development and the purification 
of our carnal tabernacles, these tem- 
ples which have been created and 
given to us, which we must cleanse 
and purify that they may become 
fit places to be inhabited by the 
Spirit of God. I say these "rules" 
that have been given, by which I 
mean the requirements which have 
been given to us in what we sum up 
and call the Word of Wisdom. How 
we ought to appreciate this law, 
these rules ; and just at this particu- 
lar time when, practically, the whole 
professional and scientific world are 
coming to understand and see the 
beauty, power, and virtue in these 
suggestions. How contemptible, as 
a people, we would be if we failed 
to glorify them in our actions be- 
fore we would allow ourselves to be 
coerced into a kind of obedience to 
them, through the strong arm of 
the civil law. It has been my ex- 



perience and my privilege to rec- 
ommend a great many of our re- 
turned missionaries for positions 
that they have desired to fill. In 
applying to the companies that fur- 
nish securities, some of the great 
eastern security companies, they 
have had to have a reference in re- 
lation to their integrity, their char- 
acter, and their habits. In receiv- 
ing letters from these security com- 
panies, almost invariably the ques- 
tions have been asked : Are they 
users of tobacco? Do they indulge 
in strong drink? Have you ever 
seen them under the influence of 
liquor? When young men go to 
apply for positions, that is, positions 
of trust or importance, some of our 
great railroad companies, and other 
great corporations of the United 
States and of other nations, these 
questions are asked, and they look 
carefully into these things to know 
whether the young men are users of 
tobacco, and whether or not they 
ever indulee in strong drink; and 
they regard as much stronger and 
brighter,and more useful, the young 
men or the young women who have 
kept themselves free and clean 
from these things. 

I was remarkably impressed with 
an incident that happened in the 
State of New York, at a time when 
a crime had been committed, when 
a renegade son of one of our lead- 
ing families had committed an overt 
act, which brought down upon us 
the indignation of the whole popu- 
lation of that great city ; and I won- 
dered whether the lynch law would 
not be administered to us. This oc- 
curred on Friday night, and upon 
Saturday morning all the papers in 
the city were ablaze with this news, 
which was extremely sad and dis- 
appointing to us ; and upon Sunday 
morning the reporters of practical- 



ELDER BEN E. RICH. 



101 



ly every paper in the city flocked 
into our meeting, expecting to re- 
port something startling and pe- 
culiar of the emissaries of this "oc- 
cult or mysterious religion." Of 
course, we welcomed them to our 
meeting and talked pleasantly with 
them, and we told them we were 
glad to have our faith, our princi- 
ples, and our lives advertised to the 
world. When the account came out 
next morning, instead of what some 
of us expected — a fierce arraign- 
ment — they said that, to their sur- 
prise, instead of meeting a lot of pe- 
culiar, long-bearded, mysterious- 
looking men, they met a company 
of voung men who looked like col- 
lege graduates ; and they said, fur- 
ther, "these missionaries have that 
clear look which indicates clean liv- 
ing." I thought, this is really the 
way to glorify our Father in Hea- 
ven; and if we will observe these 
laws, and if we will incorporate into 
our lives these divine principles of 
truth, we need not fear for our rep- 
utation; we will carry upon our 
faces, upon our countenances, the 
testimony of our lives, and we will 
reflect there the glory of our Fath- 
er in Heaven. To me, it becomes 
our bounden duty to do these 
things, especially in view of the 
great claim's that we make and the 
sacred name that we bear — that of 
members of the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints. May 
the Lord help us to do this, I ask 
in Jesus' name. Amen. 

ELDER BEN E. RICH. 

(President of Eastern States Mission.) 

I feel, my brethren and sisters, 
that no one needs the prayers of the 
people of God more than I do, in 



occupying this position, this morn- 
ing. It has pleased the authori- 
ties of the Church, and, I believe, 
it has pleased my heavenly Father 
■ — because I believe the authorities 
of the Church act under the inspira- 
tion of God — to transfer me from 
my old field of labor, in the South- 
ern States Mission, to the field re- 
cently vacated by Brother McQuar- 
rie, who has just spoken to you. I 
believe I will find a great deal of 
happiness, pleasure and satisfaction 
in doing missionary work in that 
historic country. I said, in the As- 
sembly Hall yesterday, that to me it 
is sacred ground, on account of the 
marvelous things which our Father 
in heaven has accomplished in that 
part of our country. I called at- 
tention to the fact that it was there 
the boy prophet went out into the 
woods and prayed for light and 
knowledge, and did not call upon 
the Lord in vain. It was there the 
angel Moroni appeared to the 
prophet, and delivered to him the 
sacred records containing the his- 
tory, both religious and civil, of 
one-half of the world. It was there 
this prophet and his brother, the 
patriarch, were born. It was there 
the Church was organized, and 
where the Lord raised up three men 
to bear witness unto all the world 
that they had beheld the plates, had 
seen the angel, and heard the voice 
of God bearing record of the truth- 
fulness of the Book of Mormon. 
It was there that the priesthood 
of God was restored, and that John 
the Baptist came and gave author- 
ity to lead mankind into the waters 
of baptism. There, also, Peter, 
James and John came and restored 
the holy apostleship. Not only 
that, but, as I said yesterday, it 
was in that section of the country 
that God caused the Government of 



102 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



the United States to be formed. 
That was the work of God just as 
well as the restoration of the Gos- 
pel. 

There is no church organized 
upon the face of the earth today 
whose members have such re- 
ligious devotion to the Government 
of the United States as have the 
Latter-day Saints, because we be- 
lieve in the statements I have made. 
We believe an angel was sent to 
earth, that he delivered a record 
unto a young man raised up by the 
Lord, and gave him the power and 
authority to translate that record 
into the English language, which 
gave to the world the history of 
prophets who had lived upon the 
earth centuries ago, and who had 
been brought by the power of God 
from the tower of Babel and after- 
wards from Jerusalem. God had 
shown to one of their prophets, as 
he took him up on the top of a high 
mountain, what would take place in 
the future; just as the angel of the 
Lord said to an apostle of Jesus 
Christ, on the other hemisphere. 
"Come up hither, John, and I will 
show you things which must be 
hereafter." So it was with Nephi, 
when he was taken up on the moun- 
tain, and the visions of the future 
were opened to him. This book, 
given to us by the power of God, 
relates the vision, or an abridge- 
ment of the vision that God gave 
to that prophet. As He parted the 
curtain of time and permitted him 
to look into the future, he saw the 
power of God resting upon Colum- 
bus, moving upon him to cross the 
mighty waters and visit the land up- 
on which were dwelling a remnant 
of His people. God showed him in 
vision how others would cross that 
water, and how, eventually, the 
Spirit of God would move upon 



them and cause them to break loose 
from their mother country. And 
in that vision it was revealed to the 
prophet that, in the war between 
the people who had gathered upon 
this sacred land, and the people of 
their mother country, the power of 
God was with the people here in or- 
ganizing an independent govern- 
ment upon the land of Zion. We 
believe, as part of our religion, 
that the contents of this book came 
from God, and, therefore, that the 
organization of the government of 
the United States was accomplish- 
ed by the power of God is also a 
part of the "Mormon" faith, and 
they cannot be untrue to it. They 
do more than any other church up- 
on the face of the earth for the 
United States government; they 
are making many sacrifices to keep 
an army of two thousand young 
men out in all the civilized nations 
of the earth, trying to convert men 
of every government upon the earth . 
to believe in the divinity and sacred- 
riess of the Book of Mormon, and 
therefore to believe that there is an 
earthly government upon the face 
of the earth that God Himself had 
a hand in organizing. No man is 
baptized into the "Mormon" church, 
whether it be in the United States, 
England, Germany, or any other 
country, who does not accept as a 
part of that faith these truths that 
I have uttered concerning the gov- 
ernment of the United States. This 
is the reason that we love the gov- 
ernment. This is the reason that 
our aged President, a few years 
ago, one who has now passed be- 
hind the vale, when the govern- 
ment stood face to face with war 
with Spain the venerable Prophet 
of God advised the youth of Israel 
to stand for the flag, and offer their 
lives in defense of the government 



ELDER BEN E. RICH. 



103 



of the United States. It was on 
account of this portion of their 
faith, this portion of their religion, 
that when they were driven from 
. the confines of the United States, 
they clung close to and cherished 
the banner representing the gov- 
ernment, and brought it with them 
to what was then a part of Mexico. 

It is too late in the day for peo- 
ple to organize themselves into a 
party on the false basis that the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints is antagonistic to the 
government of the United States ; 
and it is also too late in the day for 
them to taunt us by saying that we 
dare not disobey the men who stand 
at the head of the Church. I want 
to place myself on record that I 
have never heard a particle of 
counsel coming from a man who 
has stood at the head of the 
Church, that is not just and right. 
It is always good and safe counsel ; 
and every individual who has mem- 
bership in the Church can look the 
enemies of these men in the face 
and say: Yes, I stand solidly for 
our leaders in every way, shape and 
manner, and I propose to have my 
children do so, for in standing by 
them I find more safety than with 
those who fling vilifications at them. 
It is true that we may have a testi- 
mony of the Gospel today and, by 
our own acts, we may lose it to- 
morrow, but as long as we cling to 
the light, we will vote not only 
twice a year, but three hundred and 
sixty-five days in the year to sus- 
tain the men who stand at the head 
of the Church. I said yesterday 
that their enemies are the enemies 
of this people. What their ene- 
mies would do to them, they would 
do to you, if they had the power; 
and that has been demonstrated. 
I do not know whether I am 



treading upon dangerous and for- 
bidden ground or hot; no one has 
warned me. I remember the time 
when Brother Roberts was elected 
to a political office on the Demo- 
cratic ticket. There were members 
of this Church who went from one 
end of the state to the other trying 
to defeat him — I was one of that 
number; that may be the reason he 
was elected — but when the enemies 
of this people got ready for the at- 
tack it was not on B. H. Roberts, it 
turned upon the Church. The fight 
ended in the House of Representa- 
tives of the United States. So it 
was when the Republican party 
elected Senator Smoot; the fight 
was not on him, it was on you just 
as much as it was on him. 

God has restored His Priesthood 
to the earth. Sometimes the evil 
one selects one man and sometimes 
another, but always he demonstrates 
that it is the Priesthood of Al- 
mighty God he is fighting. Prob- 
ably I feel this keenly because I am 
kept out in the missionary field free 
from political strife, not mingling 
in your political quarrels. As long 
as a young man does his duty in the 
missionary field, he prays with all 
earnestness for the prophets, seers 
and revelators who stand at the 
head of the Church. 

I have heard men, sons of prom- 
inent men in the Church, bear 
solemn testimonies that they knew 
Joseph Smith was a prophet of 
God ; I have heard them give coun- 
sel and advice to youn^ men in the 
missionary field, whom they inci- 
dentally met, counseling them, by 
the spirit they then possessed, to 
stand by the authorities of the 
Church. Then I have seen them, 
when their fathers — who seemed to 
be the anchors of their faith — 
passed to the other side, turn, with 



104

all the hideousness of a rattlesnake, 
against the very men that they pre- 
tended to support before. I have 
often wondered whether, if their 
fathers had continued to live, they 
would have continued to bear_ the 
former testimony. Perhaps it is 
good to take men's fathers away 
from them, at times, so the children 
can exercise their own free agency, 
that God may know how a man is 
for himself. 

There is not a young man in this 
audience but has the right, if he 
lives for it, to know that Joseph 
Smith is a prophet of God, to know 
that this work is true, just as well 
as these brethren on the stand. God 
is no resoecter of persons. I do 
not bear testimony to the truthful- 
ness of the work of God because 
some of these authorities or all of 
them bear that testimny. I knew 
it before I ever saw a majority of 
these brethren; I know it as well 
as they know it, and that is the priv- 
ilege of every member of this 
Church. When God does give us 
that testimony, and we are living 
under the influence of the Spirit 
that comes from on high, we will 
sustain the men who are at the head 
of the Church, with our lives, if 
necessary ; and we would be anx- 
ious for all the world to know that 
we sustain them, and that we are 
willing to stand between them and 
danger, because of the position they 
occupy. This is where I hope ev- 
ery man and every woman in this 
Church stands. 

I pray that God may give you the 
light and influence of His Holy 
Spirit that you may receive a tes- 
timony of the Gospel, that you may 
know the object God had in plac- 
ing you here upon this earth. This 
was not the beginning of your lives. 



I have heard it said, often, that man 
is a dual being — I say, he is a trin- 
ity. Man is a representative of the 
Father, Son and Holy Ghost. When 
a human body comes into the world,- 
there is a light from another sphere 
placed within it. The spirit that 
God places within this tabernacle 
was not created in this sphere, it 
was created yonder, in the presence 
of our Father and our Mother in 
heaven. When that spirit taber- 
nacle was born unto them, there 
was a light, there was an intelli- 
gence placed within it that existed 
from everlasting. So that man was 
created in the image of God, and, 
like unto God, he is from' ever- 
lasting to everlasting, and is thus a 
representative of the Trinity in 
heaven. Try to live under the in- 
fluence of that Spirit which comes 
from Them, and be true to the cove- 
nants that you have made with God. 
Remember the words of the Proph- 
et Joseph, that, in all your flounder- 
ings be careful to stand by the 
brethren whom God has given to 
us as prophets, seers and revelators ; 
whether it pleases the world, or not, 
it will please God. May His bless- 
ings be upon you, in the name of 
Jesus. Amen.

ELDER CHARLES A. CALLIS. 

(President of Southern States Mission.) 

I pray you, my brethren and sis- 
ters, that I may have the benefit of 
your faith and prayers while I 
speak unto you. The sole desire of 
my heart is to say those things that 



t 



ELDER CHARLES A. CALLIS. 105 



it would please the Lord to have me 
tell you. 

As I listened to the instructions 
of the servants of God, yesterday 
and throughout this conference, I 
felt in my soul that it was a blessed 
privilege to enjoy the presence and 
counsels of the general authorities 
of the Church. As we have been 
told, we have been reproved for 
things we were guilty of; yet it is 
said that the rebuke of a friend is 
just, "but the kisses of an enemy 
are deceitful." One of the ancient 
prophets, in lamenting the downfall 
of Israel, stated as one of the rea- 
sons for the decline of his glory and 
the blessings of the Lord being 
taken from him was that he could 
not receive correction. The instruc- 
tions that have been imparted unto 
us this day will make for righteous- 
ness in our lives ; and I for one — 
and I know that we all feel likewise 
— feel to accept these instructions 
in the spirit in which they were 
given, and demonstrate unto the 
Lord that we love His servants and 
show our appreciation of their coun- 
sels by living up to the principles 
of the Gospel, which they teach us 
from time to time. 

We bring you cheering news 
from the mission field. Your sons 
are bearing aloft the royal standard 
of the Gospel in a creditable man- 
ner. People marvel at the influ- 
ence which these young men wield, 
but they forget that a life of unself- 
ishness and love and devotion to 
dutv not only strengthens us with 
our people, but magnifies us in the 
eyes of those who are not of our 
faith, and in building up each other, 
we are only building up ourselves. 
One of the reasons for the strength 
of this Gospel, and for the influence 
which your sons wield in the mis- 
sion field is this : they speak under 



the power of the Holy Ghost, and 
the oower of the Holy Ghost car- 
ries their words, their instructions 
unto the hearts of the children of 
men. One of the reasons for the 
decay of religious thought in the 
world today is that men are teaching 
solely by the learning of men ; they 
are not relying upon the power and 
influence of the Holy Ghost. The 
prophet has said : "To be learned is 
good, if you obey the counsels of 
God ;" but, my brethren and sisters, 
when it comes to a choice between 
the two, when it comes to that which 
makes most for righteousness, per- 
sonal goodness will count more in 
the battle of life and in the build- 
ing up of our fellow man, in the 
development of character, than will 
mere intellectual knowledge. 

The very power of this people 
lies in the fact that they are obedi- 
ent to God, and to be obedient is to 
please Him, and not to debase them- 
selves. I am sure that the Latter- 
day Saints feel this way today, and 
that from their hearts they can ex- 
claim with the Apostle Paul, "I am 
not ashamed of the Gospel of 
Christ, because it is the power of 
God unto salvation, unto every one 
that believeth." Now we discover 
the reason for the opposition to 
this system of religion called Mor- 
monism ; it is because it is the pow- 
er of God unto salvation ; it is be- 
cause the principles of this Gospel 
are making headway in the world. 
The Gospel is making substantial 
progress in the nations of the earth ; 
go where you will, the light of the 
Gospel is spreading, and the princi- 
ples are not so new and strange to 
the world as they were three or four 
decades ago. You talk to men 
about the principle of revelation ; 
they are beginning to believe in 
that princip.le, and men are no

longer scoffing at the Prophet Jos- 
eph Smith— that is, men of under- 
standing, men with unbiased minds, 
men who do not read the history of 
"Mormonism" with their preju- 
dices, but read it with their eyes ; 
these men with liberality of thought 
are beginning to see in the Prophet 
Joseph Smith a man of God, a 
prophet of Israel who enunciated 
and taught these glorious saving 
principles to all the world for the 
salvation of mankind. 

The Lord has said that some men 
shall see signs, but not unto sal- 
vation. The greatness of this work 
is apparent to fairminded men, 
while others are fighting the work, 
because their minds are prejudiced, 
and they do not discern its glory, 
virtue, and power. When Jesus 
called Lazarus from the grave there 
were men who marveled at that 
miracle and believed in Christ; and 
there were also men who, filled with 
envy and hate, straightway went 
unto the Scribes and Pharisees and 
prejudiced them still more against 
the Son of God. When the Savior 
healed the blind man, and restored 
his sight, he who was blind was 
summoned before the Jewish tri- 
bunal. They tried to make him be- 
lieve that Jesus was a sinner, that 
his sight had not been restored by 
the power of God. This excited 
marvel and wonder in the mind of 
the man who had been afflicted, 
and he said : It is a marvel to me 
that you men, who are steeped in 
the knowledge of the Scripture, 
who are learned according to the 
laws of your church, it is a marvel 
to me that you can not see that this 
was done bv the power of God. So 
it is with us today; it is a marvel 
unto us, or to many of us, that men 
seeing the greatness of this work do 
not discern its virtue, its beauty, 



and the only motive it has, which is 
the uplifting and the benefit of man- 
kind ; because, God being our wit- 
ness, our hearts are filled with love 
for the children of men and duty to 
God, and this creates in us a love 
for our fellow creatures. 

Well, my brethren and sisters, we 
know in our lives this Gospel has 
been the power of God unto salva- 
tion. When the Lord was born, 
widen that heavenly song was sung, 
when that message of good will was 
given to the earth, "Peace on earth 
and good will to man," it was met 
by persecution; it was answered 
by hate ; it was replied to with mur- 
der. What was there in that in- 
nocent babe of Bethlehem to ex- 
cite the envy and hate of the world ? 
It had not wealth; it had not high 
earthly station; it was born amid 
humble surroundings ; but the ad- 
versary recognized in that babe the 
Messiah, the being who had come 
to earth with the Gospel, which is 
the power of God unto salvation. 
The adversary well knew that all 
the obsolete forms of religion that 
the Jews had, did not make for 
righteousness or bring men and 
women to a knowledge of God. 
History repeats itself ; the centuries 
went by; the religious world was 
in a state of confusion, when the 
boy prophet Joseph Smith declared 
to the world that he had seen the 
Father and the Son. He but de- 
livered to the world a message of 
peace, yet that message was met 
with persecution, and with hatred, 
and with murder. What was there 
in the boy prophet that should call 
forth this envy and hate and mur- 
der? He was not wealthy; he was 
not of distinguished parentage, as 
the world goes ; he did not wear 
soft clothing; he was born amid 
humble surroundings, but Satan 



ELDER CHARLES A. CALLIS. 



107 



saw in that boy the messenger of 
God through whom should be re- 
stored to the earth the Gospel which 
is the power of God unto salva- 
tion. So it is today, that is the rea- 
son for the persecution and the 
hatred that are being visited upon 
the Latter-day Saints. It is not be- 
cause we strive for political grati- 
fication or for political honors, but 
we are the people of God, we have 
the Gospel of the Son of God, and 
our mission is definite, we have an 
object in view, and this object 
makes us strong, even the object 
of preparing the world for the glor- 
ious second coming of the Redeem- 
er. To this our mission we will be 
true, and though men persecute us 
we will pursue the even tenor of 
our ways, and preach the Gospel of 
love. 

You remember reading that when 
the Grecian nation was in danger 
of invasion, two statesmen were 
discussing the best means of re- 
pelling the invader, and one of the 
statesmen could not meet the logic 
of the other with logic; he grew 
angry and went to strike his op- 
ponent, but the latter said : "Strike 
if you will,but listen." We say to the 
world, if you must persecute us, we 
will accept it in the spirit of Christ. 
Strike, if you must, but listen — 
listen to our message, for it is im- 
portant to you, it is the Gospel of 
the Lord Jesus Christ. Brethren 
and sisters, the schooling we are 
receiving, the arduous labors we are 
performing are good for the Lat- 
ter-day Saints. The poet said : 

"This is a scene of combat — not of rest; 
Man's life is a laborious one at best ; 
On this side of death, his labors never 
cease, 

His joys are joys of conquest — not of 
peace." 



Every Latter-day Saint can 
preach the Gospel. It is not given 
to everybody to go out into the mis- 
sion field, but it is given to us all to 
pay our tithes and our offerings, 
that houses may be built to the wor- 
ship of God, and, as the Lord has 
said, if we labor all the davs of our 
lives and bring but one soul unto 
the knowledge of Christ, how great 
shall be our joy with that soul in 
the kingdom of our God. So you, 
my brethren and sisters, who are 
not on the "firing line," you can 
live good true lives at home. By 
paying your tithes you are assisting 
in erecting meeting houses in the 
world as well as in Zion, and in 
those places of worship men and 
women will meet and they will lis- 
ten to the Gospel of the Redeemer. 
Their souls will be turned unto God, 
and in the day that we shall be re- 
warded for the deeds done in the 
body, you people whose money has 
been expended in building these 
houses, you shall have joy with the 
souls of men who have been saved 
by reason of your generosity in giv- 
ing of your means to build up the 
kingdom of God. 

I pray that the light of the Gos- 
pel of Christ may spread through- 
out the earth, as the good old hymn 
says : 

"Thy swift messengers are treading 
The high courts where princes dwell, 

And thy glorious light is spreading ; 
Zion prospers, all is well." 

May Zion continue to prosper ; 
may the Gospel continue to spread, 
until every son and daughter of 
God basks in the sunlight of ever- 
lasting truth, is my prayer, in the 
name of Jesus. Amen.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



ELDER DAVID 0. M'KAY. 

Work more effective than words. — No- 
bility of true manhood and woman- 
hood. — Defenders of truth and doers 
of duty. — Vile literature and poison- 
ous journalism condemned. 

"The world wants men, true men, 
Who cannot be bought or sold ; 

Men who will scorn to violate truth — 
Genuine gold." 

Last Sunday afternoon, ten 
thousand voices declared, as one, in 
favor of prohibitory laws against 
the saloon traffic and against the 
violation of the Sabbath day. I 
thought, after the vote was taken, 
and several times since, that is the 
easiest part of the work ; it was easy 
to say "aye" to the resolution, but 
what is wanted now are men, true 
men, who cannot be bought or sold, 
who scorn to violate truth — genuine 
gold. 

In ancient Israel, fifty thousand 
soldiers, under Zebulori, one day 
came to David. It is said that they 
knew the ways of war, that they 
could wield the bow and the arrow, 
and that "they could all keep rank, 
and were not of double heart." 

Can all the ten thousand, and the 
250,000, or more, represented by 
that ten thousand, all keep rank and 
be not of double heart? It is work 
that will count in this state. It is 
not the "aye" alone. "Aye," "aye" 
will not do it; work, work, will do 
it. "It is not every one that sayeth 
Lord, Lord, that shall enter into 
the kingdom of heaven, but he that 
doeth the will of my Father which 
is in heaven." 

We want men. There is nothing 
in life so admirable as true man- 
hood; there is nothing so sacred as 
true womanhood. Manhood! Oh, 
what that means — to be a man, to 
be worthy of the honor that Antony 



gave to Brutus, when he pointed and 
said : "This was the noblest Ro- 
man of them all: all the conspira- 
tors, save only he, did that they did 
in envy of great Ceasar; he 
only, in a general honest thought 
and common good to all, made one 
of them. His life was gentle, and 
the elements so mixed in him that 
Nature could stand up and say to 
all the world : This was a man." 
Wordsworth's heart leaped up 
when he beheld a rainbow in the 
sky. Burns' heart wept when his 
plowshare overturned a daisy. Ten- 
nyson could pluck the flower from 
the "crannied wall," and see, if he 
could read in it the mystery, "all 
that God and man is." All these, 
and other great men, have shown to 
us, in the works of nature, the 
handiwork of God. Shakespeare 
could "find tongues in trees, books 
in the running brooks, sermons in 
stones, and good in everything." 
All, I say, are expressions of good- 
ness, and praises to God invite ; but 
the !?lory of creation, "the beauty 
of the world," says Shakespeare, 
"the paragon of animals," is man. 
"An honest man is the noblest work 
of God." We delight in associ- 
ating with true men ; it is good to 
be in their presence. "They are 
living light fountains," says Car- 
lyle, "which it is good and pleasant 
to be near." I often think that it is 
easy to be honest ; and to be honest 
means that we are in harmony with 
divine law, that we are in keeping 
with the noblest work of God. 

A dishonest man brings only mis- 
ery into the world. Look at Judas 
— oh, what that man brought upon 
himself by not being true. He as- 
sociated with his Lord and heard 
the divine truths from his Master's 
lips. It may be that once he felt, in 
his heart, the truth; but he let out- 



ELDER DAVID 0. McKAY. 



109 



side influences come upon him. He 
let his appetite for greed lead him 
into dishonesty. Following that 
prompting he opposed the works of 
the Master, found fault with con- 
ditions around him. Six days be- 
fore the passover, Mary, out of the 
great love in her heart, anointed 
Jesus. Who is it that finds fault? 
Not an honest man whose heart was 
in the truth; but the Judas, and 
even in his fault-finding you detect 
the lie: "Why was not this oint- 
ment sold for so much money, that 
we might give it to the poor ?" Oh, 
dissembler! Oh hypocrite! Not 
that he wanted the money for the 
poor, "but," says one of his com- 
panions, "because he was a thief 
and kept the bag." He sat at meat 
with his Lord, near his Master's 
side, there in the presence of the 
Divine Man, pretending to be one 
with Him in friendship — not only 
friendship but discipleship ; not only 
that, but a disciple in whom had 
been placed trust. There at the ta- 
ble, eating bread by the side of his 
Master, he was still untrue and had 
already bargained to betray his 
Lord into the hands of His enemies. 
Later he passed out from Christ's 
presence, out into the darkness; 
oh, God pity the man who so leaves 
the light! Pity Judas that night, 
when he left the radiance of that 
room, the company of discipleship 
and the divine presence of the Lord ; 
when he passed out into the dark- 
ness to give expression, not to his 
better self, but to the dishonesty 
within him, responding to the ap- 
peals of a morbid appetite, of a dis- 
honest soul. Then came the cul- 
minating act of hypocrisy and de- 
ceit, when he implanted the kiss up- 
on his Master and said : "Hail, 
Lord." It is not with such a man 
that you feel inspired; it is not in 



his presence that you feel illumined. 
Follow him to his death, and the 
feeling of pity and compassion for 
him' is intensified when you see his 
sad end. 

Compare his life with that of 
James, the brother of the Lord, or 
even James, the brother of John. 
We do not know much about them, 
but they were both true men. But 
the one who wrote his epistle, prob- 
ably also gave the decision on cir- 
cumcision, a man who was true un- 
der all conditions. He was a Jew, 
born with the prejudices of the 
Jews against the Gentiles. Yet, 
when the light came to his soul that 
Christ's truths were for all the 
world, his old traditions had to be 
swept aside, and he stood there in 
the face of his countrymen and de- 
clared the truth, which God had re- 
vealed to him, that the Gospel was 
for all. Follow that man from 
there on in his just acts, the few 
we know, and see how he com- 
manded the respect, even of his en- 
emies. Why? Because he was true 
to his Lord; he was true to that 
which he knew to be right. When 
he had occasion, a few years before 
his death, to rebuke dishonesty, to 
call the attention of the people to 
evils that existed, and admonish 
them to be true to the Gospel of 
Christ, he speaks such words as 
these : 

But let him ask in faith, nothing wav- 
ering. For he that wavereth is like a 
wave of the sea, driven with the wind 
and tossed. 

For let not that man think that he 
shall receive any thing of the Lord. 

A double-minded man is unstable in 
all his ways." 

Then again : 

Out of the same mouth proceedeth 
blessing and cursing. My brethren, these 
■ things ought not so to be.

Doth a fountain send forth at the 
same place sweet water and bitter? 

Can the fig tree, my brethren, bear 
olive berries? either a vine, figs? so can 
no fountain both yield salt water arid 
fresh. 

Who is a wise man and endued with 
knowledge among you? let him show 
out of a good conversation his works 
with meekness of wisdom. 

But if ye have bitter envying and 
strife in your hearts, glory not, and lie 
not against the truth. 

The man who is true to his man- 
hood will not lie against the truth. 
We are told that we can crucify the 
Lord afresh. If that be true, we 
can betray the Lord afresh. There 
is that within every man which is 
divine, a divinity within every 
man's soul. It can not die. God 
renews it, inspires it, works to keep 
it alive. The man who will be true 
to the divine within, is true to his 
Lord, and is true to his fellowmen. 
The man who betrays that, the man 
who is untrue to that which he 
knows to be right, is wavering, is 
weakening. God pity him ; he may 
go so far that he will step out of 
the light, out of that divine pres- 
ence, and woe be unto him when he 
does ; God help him. 

Men and brethren, we have de- 
clared to the world that we have the 
Gospel of Christ, that we are going 
to stand against vice. That "aye" 
the other day merely meant this : 
We have buckled on the armor ; we 
have unsheathed our swords. Now, 
shall we make the charge ? or shall 
we waver and be driven by the wind 
and tossed? Shall we forsake this 
cause, in order to please men? be- 
cause we desire to give "eye ser- 
vice" rather than heart service, be- 
cause of some political power that 
is brought to bear upon us ? No ! 
We will stand, true to ourselves, 
true to the divine within us, true to 
that truth which we have received. 



We ought to know that it is not 
good to have such evil surround- 
ings as saloons in our midst, to 
draw away our young and lead 
them into the darkness of misery and 
despair. Let us be true today; let 
us act; let us act! After leaving 
this conference,when we are thrown 
into the company of men who will 
try to tempt us, when we are thrown 
again under the influence of appe- 
tites that we have developed, let 
us, like James, be true to the death. 
As he stood there on the pinnacle 
of the temple, and the men, look- 
ing upon him then as a just man, 
said : "Where is the gate to Christ?" 
he bore his testimony of the Lord 
Jesus. Even then, historians tell 
'us, they said : "We can't believe 
him, even though he is just;" and 
they hurled him down to beat him 
to death. James' death is inspir- 
ing; Judas' death is death! death in 
its gloomiest form. 

All men who have moved the 
world have been men who would 
stand true to their conscience — not 
only James, not only Paul, Peter, 
and all those ancient apostles, but 
all other great men in history. I 
often admire Luther ; I cannot help 
but feel better when I read his 
words to the assembly at the Diet of 
Worms, all the Catholic church 
opposing him, and all the powers of 
the land staring him in the face. 
"Confute me by proof of Scripture 
or by sound argument," said he ; "I 
cannot recant otherwise. It is not 
safe for a man to do aught against 
his conscience. Here stand I ; I can 
not do otherwise; God assist me." 
It was Joseph Smith who, after 
having a testimony of the Lord 
Jesus in his bosom, declared to the 
men who said, "It is from the devil" 
— ministers who had influence with 
him before, men whom' he respect- 



ELDER DAVID 0. McKAY. 



Ill 



ed as, at least, attempting to teach 
the word of God — to them he said : 
"I know I have seen a vision, and 
God knows that I have." And he 
was true to this testimony to the 
last. When he was going to his 
death, he declared to all the world : 
"I have a conscience void of offense 
toward God and all men." Why? 
Because he had been true to it; he 
was a man possessing divine man- 
hood, for true manhood is divine; 
oh, it is glorious. It was that spir- 
it that prompted our leader (Pres- 
ident Joseph F. Smith) to say to 
the world : "I will be true to those 
who have trusted me ; I can not do 
otherwise." That is the manhood 
the Latter-day Saint should pos- 
sess, in defending the truth. That 
is the manhood that we all need 
when we go out into our wards and 
stakes, to inspire young men with 
that same truth; it is that we need 
in combating all kinds of error — 
not only the saloon, not only the to- 
bacco habit, but another condition 
that is here in our midst, which is 
just as fatal as the saloon, which is 
just as poisonous, aye, more pois- 
onous than the tobacco, bad as it is. 
I refer to the vile literature that is 
being circulated among the young. 

The greatest power in the world 
today is the press. Think of the 
thousands, the hundreds of thou- 
sands, the millions, that daily are 
brought into contact with the 
thoughts that are published to the 
world. Speaking of this power, Car- 
lyle says : 

"I many times say, the writers of 
newspapers, pamphlets, poems, books, 
these are the real, working, effective 
church of modern times. Nay, not only 
our preaching, but even our worship, 
is not it, too, accomplished by means of 
printed books? The noble sentiment 
which a gifted soul has clothed for us 
in melodious words, which brings mel- 



ody into our hearts — is not this essen- 
tially, if we will undrestand it, of the 
nature of worship? There are many, in 
all countries, who, in this confused time, 
have no other method of worship. He 
who in any way shows us better than 
we knew before that a lily of the field 
is beautiful, does he not show it us as 
an effluence of the fountain of all beau- 
ty ; as the handwriting made visible 
there of the great Maker of the Uni- 
verse? He has sung for us, made us 
sing with him, a little verse of a sacred 
psalm. Essentially so, how much - more 
he who sings, who says or in any way 
brings home to our hearts the noble do- 
ings, feelings, darings and endurance of 
a brother man ! He has verily touched 
our heart as with a live coal from the 
altar. Perhaps there is no worship more 
authentic." 

Let me digress here a moment 
to say that the element of great- 
ness all through these men I have 
named is sincerity, true consis- 
tency. A sincere man who sits 
down at night and pens that which 
his soul believes to be right, that 
which his soul tells him will be good 
for humanity, is exercising a pow- 
er over the world that is beneficial. 
We should hail that expression of 
greatness, of goodness, with thanks- 
giving. But the insincere man, the 
man who will sit down at night and 
distort facts, who will wilfully mis- 
represent truth, who is a traitor to 
the divine within him which is call- 
ing, nay longing for truth, what 
shall we say of that man? He is 
publishing falsehoods to the world, 
giving poison to young, innocent 
souls who are longing for truth. 
Oh, there is no condemnation too 
strong for the hypocrite, for the • 
betrayer of Christ.. We will not 
condemn him, but God will, in His 
justice; He must. 

Too much time is taken up by 
our young people, and by our older 
ones, too, in reading useless pamph- 
lets, useless books ; "It is worse than 



112 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



useless," says Farrar, in that excel- 
lent little work on "Great Books:" 

* * * * "t rea( j through the squalid 
details of every police trial, or the nause- 
ous revelations of divorce courts, or 
vague political conjectures, or the sensa- 
tional items of 'the silly season.' There 
are papers that seem to exist for no oth- 
er reason than to 'chronicle small beer.' 
How can we have time to think or leave 
a margin to our life, if we spend hours 
every week in dabbling about in what 
Mr. Lowell called 'the stagnant goose- 
ponds of village gossip.' When the 
'mems' and 'items' and 'pars' are full of 
gossip, scandal, and spite; when they are 
like the verminiferous dust in which are 
incubated the germs of envy, hatred, 
malice, and all uncharitableness — the less 
we notice them the better. They are un- 
diluted poison to the healthy soul, which 
loves charity and truth. There is one 
piece of advice which I would give with 
intense earnestness to all. It is this : 
Never be tempted by curiosity to read 
what you know to be a bad book, or 
what a very little reading shows you 
to be a bad book. Bad books, by which 
I do not mean merely ignorant and mis- 
leading books, but those which are pru- 
rient and corrupt — are the most fatal 
emissaries of the devil. They pollute 
with plague the moral atmosphere of 
the world." 

Men in Israel, it is time that we 
take a stand against vile literature. 
It is poisonous to the soul. It is 
the duty of a parent to put the poi- 
son, that is in the house, on the 
highest shelf, away from that inno- 
cent little child who knows not the 
daneer of it. It is the duty of the 
parent also to keep the boy's mind 
from becoming polluted with the 
vile trash that is sometimes scat- 
tered — nay, that is daily distributed 
among us. There is inconsistency 
in a man's kneeling down with his 
family in prayer, and asking God 
to bless the leader of our Church, 
and then put into the hands of the 
boy, who was kneeling there, a pa- 



per that calls the leader a hypo- 
crite. It ought not to be done; it 
is poison to the soul. 

How can we tell? May be those 
are the great men who are writing 
the scurrilous articles, and these 
whom they attack are not the great 
men ? Some may say : Give the chil- 
dren an opportunity to hear both 
sides. Yes, that is all well and good ; 
but if a man were to come into your 
home and say to you that your 
mother is not a good woman, you 
would know he lied ; wouldn't you ? 
And you wouldn't let your children 
hear him. If a man came and told 
you that your brother was dishon- 
est, and you had been with him all 
your life and knew him to be hon- 
est, you would know the man lied. 
So when they come and tell you the 
Gospel is a hypocritical doctrine, 
taught by this organization, when 
they tell you the men at the head are 
insincere, you know they lie ; and 
you can take the same firm stand on 
that, being sincere yourself as you 
could in regard to your mother and 
brother. Teach your children, your 
boys and girls everywhere, to keep 
away from every bad book and all 
bad literature, especially that which 
savors of hatred, or envv, or malice, 
that which bears upon it the marks 
of hypocrisy, insincerity, edited by 
men who have lost their manhood. 

"The world wants men, true men, 
Who can not be bought or sold, 

Men who scorn to violate truth — 
Genuine gold." 

Now, brethren, it is for us to 
say whether we will be the Judases 
or the Jameses, whether we will be 
true to the divine within us, in ob- 
serving the word of wisdom, in 
Sabbath keeping, in giving to our 
children pure literature — the best

books, so that we can keep their 
souls free from the polluted atmos- 
phere of poisonous journalism. 

May God bless us all, that we 
may, above all, be true to the di- 
vine within us ; be men, true men ; 
be noble women, true to mother- 
hood, true to wifehood, true to God ; 
then we shall all be one. If all the 
world will take that same stand, ev- 
ery man give out only that which 
he understands to be right, some 
day we must all come to the truth; 
sincerity of life will bring all men 
to the truth, eventually. God has- 
ten the day, I ask in the name of 
Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn : 

How firm a foundation, ye Saints of the 
Lord, 

Is laid for your faith in His excellent 
word ! 

What more can He say than to you He 

hath said, 
You who unto lesus for refuge have 

fled? 

Benediction was pronounced by 
Elder Joseph E. Robinson. 

Conference adjourned until 2 p.

CLOSING SESSION. 

In the Tabernacle, at 2 p. m. 

President Joseph F. Smith called 
the meeting to order. 

The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn : 

Now let us rejoice in the day of salva- 
tion ; 

No longer as strangers on earth need 
we roam, 

Good tidings are sounding to us and 
each nation, 
And shortly the hour of redemption 
will come. 



Prayer was offered by Elder Ne- 
phi Pratt. 

The choir sang the hymn : 

Lord, Thou wilt hear me when I pray ; 
, I am forever Thine! 
f fear before Thee all the day; 
O may I never sin. 



PRESIDENT JOHN R. WINDER. 

Endorsement of the temperance resolu- 
tion. — Blessings follow payment of tith- 
ing. — Testimony that tithing has been 
carefully guarded, and rightly used. — 
"Rustling" seventy-five years. 

I am very thankful, my brethren 
and sisters, to have this privilege of 
standing before you a few mo- 
ments. I wish to express to you 
my appreciation of the good things 
that we have heard during this 
conference, and to say that I can 
heartily endorse all the sentiments 
that have been uttered by all the 
brethren who have spoken to us. I 
am sure, my brethren and sisters, 
if we will carry them out in our 
lives, that we will all be benefited 
by them. I propose, myself, to us& 
my best endeavors to aid and assist 
in carrying them out in the future. 

One thing that I endorse with 
all my heart is the resolution that 
was passed in relation to temper- 
ance. I heartily endorse that prop- 
osition, and say to you that I will 
give to that principle my aid and as- 
sistance to the best of my ability, to 
see that it shall be carried out 
amongst the people. I believe that 
the people will receive this proposi- 
tion and that, as a general rule, it 
will be carried out by them. There 
is no doubt in my mind that there 
was a necessity that this matter 
should be brought up before this 
conference, and I am very glad that 
it has taken the shape that it has 



114 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



There are many other good things 
that have been said, to which our 
attention has been called, and I 
have no doubt, my brethren and sis" 
ters, that you have concluded iii 
your minds, by this time, that you 
propose to carry out these instruc- 
tions. 

There is one principle that comes 
to my mind that has not been very 
much talked about during this con- 
ference, that is the principle of tith- 
ing. It has been alluded to, but 
there has not been very much said 
about it. This is a principle that I 
believe in with all my heart. I be- 
lieve it is the duty of all faithful 
Latter-day Saints to pay their hon- 
est tithing and donations. I am 
sure from past experience, that it 
is a safe proposition, although I 
do not think we should be prompt- 
ed to pay tithing from the mercen- 
ary consideration that we are to re- 
ceive a reward, or have returned to 
us a portion of what we pay. How- 
ever, I believe that we do receive 
blessings from the Lord by paying 
tithing; I know I have been blest 
by so doing ; I can testify to that. 1 
remember what Malachi says about 
it: "Bring into my storehouse your 
tithes and your offerings, and I 
will pour you out a blessing." You 
are all familiar with what is said 
in relation to this. I know it is a 
true principle, brethren and sisters. 
One other thing in relation to it; 
Never mind what is said about the 
use of the tithing and how it is 
appropriated. 

I testify to you here, this after- 
noon, that I know that during the 
last six or seven years that I have 
been associated with the Trustee- 
in-trust every dollar of tithing that 
came into his hands was carefully 
guarded. Every dollar is accounted 
for ; every dollar that is appropri- 
ated is properly registered, and the 



accounts are just as carefully kept 
and the funds just as carefully ac- 
counted for, as in any banking or 
mercantile institution in the coun- 
try. I want to say this much to you 
this afternoon; because this is a 
matter with which I am familiar, 
and I can speak positively about it. 
You need have no fears in relation 
to what is done with your tithing, 
it is carefully appropriated. When 
requests for appropriations come in. 
the question arises : what is the con- 
dition in each case ? Let us consider 
what the conditons are. What is the 
condition of that ward or that stake 
which asks for this appropriation? 
All these matters are carefully con. 
sidered,and then the question comei 
up, how much can we appropriate 
for this, that, or the other, as the 
case may be. So it is in all these 
matters, my brethren and sister:,. 
The Twelve are associated with us ; 
they are consulted, and they take 
part in the appropriation and care 
of tithes and offerings. 

I know what I have said, my 
brethren and sisters, to be the truth. 
I do not know how much longer 
I shall live and how many more 
conferences I shall be permitted to 
'attend. There is a limit to the life 
of man, it is said, and we know 
there is. How long my life will be 
extended I know not; but I did 
want to make this statement to you 
this afternoon, whatever my future 
may be. I want you to bear it in 
mind that such is the fact, no mat- 
ter what may be said from any 
other source. 

Now, for the remainder of my 
days, so long as the Lord shall per- 
mit me to live among you, I pro- 
pose that every day of my life 
shall be devoted to the interests, 
and welfare, and upbuilding of the 
kingdom of God upon the earth 
Mine has been a busy life; I com-

menced to labor and rustle for my- 
self from the time I was about ten 
years of age, which is more than 
seventy-five years ago, and I have 
been rustling ever since. It is too 
late for me to lie down now; i 
propose to continue in this work 
just as long as I am permitted to 
live. 

May God help you, my brethren 
and sisters, to carry into effect the 
good things you have heard here 
today. If you will do this, you will 
be taking a step higher up; you 
will go on and advance, and in- 
crease and multiply upon the earth. 
May the Lord help us all to be 
faithful and true to the end, is my 
prayer, in the name of Jesus. 
Amen. 



PRESIDENT ANTHON H. LUND. 



Marvelous character of work done by 
Joseph Smith. — Convincing effects of 
reading the Book of Mormon. — Won- 
derful perfection of the Church or- 
ganization. — Succession in Presidency 
of Church after the crucifixion. — 
Church not disorganized, no need to 
be re-organized. 

I believe we all feel pleased to 
hear the remarks of Brother Win- 
der. Think of his being eighty- 
seven years old, and yet is able to 
talk with such vigor as he did. He 
is in full possession of all his fac- 
ulties ; his memory is strong ; he is 
an encyclopedia on everything per- 
taining to the Church. I know he 
is a man who fulfills the duties of 
his office to the acceptance of our 
heavenly Father, and we feel pleas- 
ed to be in his company. 

I rejoice in what has been said in 
this conference. I endorse the in- 
structions that have been given. I 
feel that the Lord has given unto 



us His word, and I hope, when we 
leave for home, we will take with 
us the good influence of the spirit 
that has been present, and remem- 
ber the teachings that have been 
given us. 

I was just thinking of the words 
that the Lord revealed to his ser- 
vant Joseph Smith, a year before 
the Church was organized. He says : 
"Now behold, a marvelous work is 
about to come forth among the 
children of men." 

You remember, it was fourteen 
months before the Church was or- 
ganized, that this revelation was 
given to a young man only twenty- 
three or twenty-four years old. He 
was told that a marvelous work was 
about to come forth among the 
children of men. Reading these 
words now, so many years since the 
revelation was given, can we say 
that they have not been fulfilled? 
Has not a marvelous work been 
brought forth among the children of 
men ? Certainly, it has been a mar- 
vel to many. When you contemplate 
and investigate the principles of the 
Gospel, as brought forth through 
the instrumentality of that young 
man, you marvel at trie consistency 
of every principle with the holy 
scriptures. All the Prophet taught 
was indeed sound doctrine, and he 
himself proved to be a prophet of 
God. The Lord fulfilled his proph- 
ecies on subjects both relating to 
this people and to the whole nation. 
The Prophet Joseph spoke and 
prophesied of things that, apparent- 
ly, were not likely to come to pass, 
but we have seen them fulfilled to 
the very letter. As a prophet, he is 
sustained by his prophecies ; as a 
teacher, he is sustained by the doc- 
trines he taught, for they are true 
and consistent with the teachings of 
the prophets of old ; and as a man 



116 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



he was loved by those who were ac- 
quainted with him'. Those who went 
in and out of his home, who saw 
him daily, loved him better than any 
one else! When you meet these 
people, you are delighted to hear 
them talk about him, about his kind- 
ness, and the pleasant intercourse 
they had with hirn, how they love to 
tell about sitting- under his voice, 
and hearing him instruct the peo- 
ple! They will testify that they 
know he was a man of God. And 
every one of us who have received 
the gift of the Holy Spirit, can bear 
the same testimony, for the Spirit 
has testified unto us that he spoke 
the truth. The marvelous work was 
inaugurated by him ; and how quick- 
ly the early Elders commenced to 
labor ; for it was said in the same 
revelation that the field was already 
white for harvest. They accepted 
this work, and they went out and 
preached unto men, and laid before 
them this wonderful message. 

It took men of moral courage to 
receive that testimony, for already, 
at that time, and even before then, 
persecution had started. The ad- 
versary wanted to stop this work, 
and if ever there was a time that it 
could have been stopped, it would 
seem to have been then, when there 
were so few in the Church ; but the 
One who had established the work 
was greater than the adversary, and 
He had power to protect it. Even 
in its infancy, although the Church 
met with such strong persecution, it 
still prospered. The Book of Mor- 
mon was published, in an edition of 
five thousand copies. We had no 
other pamphlets or tracts to spread 
among the people, but that book 
contained the word of God, the Gos- 
pel in its plainness, and it did a good 
missionary work. It was sold to 
the people, and loaned or given to 



them; men read it, and many re- 
ceived a testimony of the truth of 
the principles it contained. Presi- 
dent Joseph F. Smith has a copy of 
the first edition which was the 
means of bringing such men 
as Joseph Young, Brigham Young, 
Phineas Young, Lorenzo Young 
and John Young into the 
Church. They read it; they were 
convinced; and they joined the 
Church. You know what strong 
men they were — not easily persuad- 
ed, but when the light of the Spirit 
of God illumined their hearts they 
were willing to accept the truth, 
and they became strong defenders 
of the faith — especially such a man 
as President Young, and also Jos- 
eph Young, the good and kind lead- 
er of the Seventies. The Book of 
Mormon was indeed a work that 
carried with it convincing power. 
There was a time when we thought 
that argumentative works were bet- 
ter to scatter among the people, 
and then afterwards let them read 
the Book of Mormon; but our 
brethren have been directed to try 
to disseminate or to spread the 
Book of Mormon among the peo- 
ple. I hear that the last edition 
printed in the Northern States, con- 
sists of one hundred thousand cop- 
ies, and they are selling very fast. 
One firm sent an order, the other 
day, for five hundred copies, and 
they were wanted at once ; this 
shows that the book is a seller. 
Now, we want to get the book into 
the homes of all men, that they 
may have a chance to know what it 
contains, and they will have the op- 
portunity to either receive or reject 
it. Our mission is to reach all men. 
and I believe that the Book of 
Mormon will show the people what 
are the principles of the Gospel, and 
teach them so plainly that if they 



PRESIDENT ANTHON H. LUND. 



117 



reject it, they will do so because 
they let prejudice govern them. 
This book has been translated into 
many languages ; it is read from 
the North Cape, in Norway, to the 
southern point of the Cape of Good 
Hope; and in nearly all parts of 
the world. Yet we want it dis- 
tributed still more among the peo- 
ple. 

It was said that knowledge 
should cover the earth as the waters 
cover the deep. This seems to be 
fulfilling in our day. Bibles have 
been printed in every language — 
as early as 1861, this claim was 
made. Men of liberal means have 
done what they could to have edi- 
tions of the Bible circulated among 
the pagans as well as among civilized 
peoples. I consider that they have 
done a great deal of good in doing 
this, for the Bible contains the word 
of God. It is true that it has passed 
through many translations, but the 
Lord has had His hand over it and 
has preserved His word, so that it 
has come down to us in nearly per- 
fect shape, though we believe that in 
some parts, through the translators' 
ignorance or, perhaps, wilfulness, 
it may not have been translated cor- 
rectly. We believe in it; we are 
glad to find that it has been dis- 
tributed among all people. I pray 
that the Book of Mormon may have 
the same destiny, that it may be 
known among all people. 

A. couple of weeks ago I heard 
with pleasure President Richard W. 
Young give a concise statement of 
the organizations in our Church. 
When you examine the organiza- 
tion of this Church you find that it 
is wonderful in its perfection. And 
it has not been the product of ex- 
perimentation, for it has not been 
added to year by year. The or- 
ganization of the Priesthood was 



given in the very beginning. On 
the very day that the Church was 
organized, the revelation on Church 
government was given. Before 
the Church was organized it was 
made known that there should be 
Apostles in the Church. Nearly a 
year before, the Three Witnesses 
were called by revelation to select 
the Twelve. On the 6th of April, 
1830, when the Church was organ- 
ized, there were but nine, or there- 
abouts, in the Church. We know 
the names of the six who took part 
in the incorporation of the Church, 
and there were very few others. 
There were not enough members 
then to fill all the offices in the 
Church; but the revelation was 
given ; an outline of what it should 
be was already understood by the 
prophet and his brethren, and they 
knew what officers should be placed 
in the Church. It took some time, 
however, to complete the organiza- 
tion. Elders were the first officers 
ordained. There are two divisions 
in the Priesthood : the Aaronic and 
Melchizedek. An Elder holds the 
Melchizedek Priesthood. Joseph 
Smith presided over the Church, 
first as an elder; but when the time 
came and the Church had grown 
more numerous, other and higher 
offices in the same priesthood were 
conferred. The leading elders were 
called and ordained High Priests, 
and then Joseph Smith presided 
over the Church as a High Priest. 
For nearly a year after its organiza- 
tion the Church was ministered to 
by elders. Then bishops were 
called and ordained, at that time 
from the Elders' quorums, and af- 
terwards the High Priests' quorum 
was instituted. Then it was re- 
vealed that bishops and presiding 
men in the Church should hold the 
office of a High Priest. 



118 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Some have wondered that the 
Prophet was ordained an Elder on 
the 6th of April, 1830. He held 
the Melchizedek Priesthood before, 
but the offices in the priesthood did 
not exist until the Church was or- 
ganized and gave its consent ; then 
he was ordained an Elder.. After- 
wards he was ordained to be a High 
Priest, and he ordained other High 
Priests. In 1832 Joseph Smith 
was called by revelation to be Pres- 
ident of the Church, but the First 
Presidency was not organized un- 
til March, 1833, when Sidney Rig- 
don and F. G. Williams were 
chosen to be his counselors ; and 
the three took charge of the affairs 
of the Church. In 1835 the quorum 
of the Twelve Apostles was organ- 
ized. It had been indicated before 
the Church was organized who 
should select them and ordain them. 
Then, shortly afterwards, the Sev- 
enties were called, and again other 
Seventies, until we have an army of 
Seventies today. The Lesser Priest- 
hood was also organized early in 
the Church, and has continued as 
first started. 

I thought I would draw your 
minds to these points, showing 
that the quorums were organized 
as the Church needed them, and it 
was not by men suggesting that 
now it would be good to' have such 
and such a quorum. The Lord in- 
dicated before the Church was or- 
ganized, what quorums would be 
needed in the Church, and the or- 
ganization was proceeded with as 
rapidly as the needs of the Church 
required it. 

We come to the time of 1844, 
when the President of the Church, 
the Prophet, and Seer, was incar- 
cerated in jail and foully assassi- 
nated, with his brother, the Patri- 
arch of the Church. Such a thing 



as the breaking up of the First 
Presidency had not been contem- 
plated by the Church, and there 
were many in the Church, not hav- 
ing given the matter any study or 
thought, who wondered who should 
be the successor. Before the 
Prophet was murdered, he had 
called the Apostles together, and 
had instructed them in all things 
pertaining to the Priesthood; and 
'he had laid upon their shoulders the 
responsibility of carrying on the 
work; hence they were the men to 
preside over the Church when the 
Prophet was gone. And this had 
its precedent in the scriptures. We 
find the first-day Church organized 
with apostles, seventies, and other 
officers in the Priesthood. They 
had been called by the Savior Him- 
self. We are told by Paul that He 
gave apostles, prophets, teachers, 
evangelists, etc. Consequently, 'if 
He gave these officers to the Church 
he organized the Church when He 
was taken away from among men, 
He left His apostles to take care of 
it. There was no mention of his 
brothers or any relatives to preside 
over the Church. He laid it upon 
Peter and the apostles to do this. 
I desire to read a few words on this 
subject. When Jesus met with His 
disciples on the shores of the Sea 
of Galilee, the Evangelist says : "So 
when they dined, Jesus said to Si- 
mon Peter : Simon, son of Jonas, 
lovest thou me more than these? 
He saith unto him :-Yea, Lord, thou 
knowest that I love thee. He said 
unto' him : Feed my lambs." This 
was the first question. He asked 
Peter if he loved Him more than 
these. This language I know can 
be interpreted in two ways, but we 
may understand the meaning when 
we think of Peter's expression at 
the last supper, when Jesus said 



PRESIDENT ANTHON H. LUND.

that there would be many that 
would be offended at Him. Peter 
declared that he would never be of- 
fended at Him; he felt so strong. 
Jesus tells him that before the cock 
should crow that night, he would 
deny Him three times. Peter said, 
if I should die with you, I would 
not deny you. Now, this was Pe- 
ter when he was under the good in- 
fluence of the Master. Having a 
testimony for himself and feeling 
strong he depended on his own 
power. "Do you love me more than 
these ?" He had said that he would 
never deny Him, and yet he had 
done so. He felt the gentle rebuke, 
and said : "Thou knowest I love 
thee," and the Master said : "Feed 
my lambs." The next verse reads : 
"He said to him again, the second 
time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest 
thou me? He saith unto him, yea, 
Lord, thou knowest I love thee. He 
saith unto him, feed my sheep." 
The word which is here translated 
"feed" is a different word in the 
Greek text from the word so 
translated above. The word first 
used is "boske," which is trans- 
lated, "to graze; feed, nourish." 
The word used in the second place 
is . "pomaine," which has been 
translated "feed," but has a much 
broader meaning than that. My 
lexicon gives the following trans- 
lation of "pomaine :" "to herd ; to 
be a shepherd ; to rule ; to take care 
of ; to tend." Peter was, therefore, 
called to be the shepherd, the care- 
taker, the ruler of the Church. And 
the third time, He saith : 'Simon, 
son of Jonas, lovest thou me?" Pe- 
ter was grieved because He said it 
unto him the third time, and he 
replied : "Lord, Thou knowest all 
things ; Thou knowest that I love 
Thee." Jesus said unto him, "Feed 
my sheep." Here the word "feed" 



is the same as in the first reply — 
where He told Peter to feed His 
lambs. Now I consider that the 
charge which Jesus gave to Peter 
and the Apostles was that they 
should direct and take charge of 
His Church here upon the earth. 
Following the history of the Apos- 
tles as it is given, we find that when 
any dissensions arose in the Church, 
men were sent to Peter and James 
and John at Jerusalem, to learn 
from them what was the word of 
God on those matters, and the de- 
cision of the Apostles was the end 
of controversy. There we have the 
precedent given us, that when the 
President of the Church was taken 
away, the Apostles took the place. 
Jesus presided over the Church 
while He lived in the flesh upon 
the earth; He continued to preside 
over the Church through His Spirit, 
and revealed His word to His ser- 
vants, but His earthly representa- 
tives were the apostles, and they 
took charge of the Church. So 
when the Prophet Joseph was mar- 
tyred, the responsibility rested 
where he had placed it. There was 
no talk of heredity ; there was 
nothing said about his relatives tak- 
ing charge ; but there was the quor- 
um of the Apostles, and upon them 
rested the responsibility of carry- 
ing on the work, and they did so; 
they continued the work that Jos- 
eph had commenced so well. 

There has been a claim made that 
the Church was disorganized at the 
death of the Prophet, and hence the 
necessity of a re-organization. The 
Church was not disorganized ; the 
quorum of the Twelve was not dis- 
organized, neither were the quor- 
ums of the Seventies, nor the Bish- 
ops, nor the Elders, nor the Lesser 
Priesthood ; all of them were just 
the same after the death of the 



120 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



■Prophet as before. As they had 
been organized by him, so they con- 
tinued, and at no time have the 
quorums of the Priesthood been dis- 
organized. Wherein is the claim, 
then, justified? Did He reject His 
Church because the Prophet and 
his brother sealed their testimonies 
with their blood ? Should it be a 
cause for disorganizing the Church, 
that the people were driven away 
from their homes and had their 
houses burned, and their temple 
taken from them? The answer is 
self-evident. They showed them- 
selves brave and true; they con- 
tinued with the work of the tem- 
ple until they could go into it, and 
receive their promised blessings. 
When persecution raged and they 
were driven forth they had to leave 
the temple, but they did not give up 
the Gospel. Perhaps there were 
not so many members in some of 
the quorums, for there were men 
who, too cowardly to share the 
trials of the Saints went away, and 
were not willing to bear the burden 
and the heat of the day, and follow 
the Church. The Lord, however, 
blessed His Saints and led them to 
this land. When they came here, 
they had not forgotten that thev 
owed a duty to the people of the 
whole world to preach the restored 
Gospel to them, and in a year or 
so missionaries were sent forth to 
the different nations upon the earth. 
We thank the Lord that these men 
came to the countries where we 
lived, and brought the light of the 
Gospel, which gave us peace in our 
souls, and the' testimony that God 
had revealed Himself in our day. 
You : can bear that testimony with 
me, We thank the Lord for the ad- 
ministration of President Young 
and his brethren the apostles. 

When the First Presidency was 



organized by them, it was done ac- 
cording to the pattern set by the 
Prophet himself. The Church has 
been organized in the way that God 
intended ; and it has never needed 
any reorganization, because it has 
never been disorganized, even 
through the darkest days of the 
expulsion and drivings. 

I thank the Lord that I am a 
member of the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints. I pray 
that I may be faithful to the cove- 
nants I have made with Him; and 
I ask that His blessings may rest 
upon all present and upon all Israel, 
in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER SEYMOUR B. YOUNG. 

. My brethren and sisters, I de- 
sire very much that you will as- 
sist me by praying for me, and that 
I may be enabled to make you hear, 
during the short time that I shall 
occupy. President Smith has in- 
vited me to say a few words, and 
I will endeavor to do so. I wiil 
begin by saying that I endorse, 
very heartily, the vote that was 
taken for the suppression of the 
drinking habit and the sale of al- 
coholic drinks, in the communities 
of the Latter-day Saints. To show 
that I am not illiberal at all, I wish 
the same unanimity of spirit could 
be shown in every communit} 
wherever there is a Christian set- 
tlement established. I am willing 
that the Catholic Church, the 
Methodist Church, the Episcopal 
Church, the Quakers, the Shak- 
ers, the Congregationalists, the 
Campbellites and all other ites, and 
all other denominations claiming to 
have the Christian religion and 
faith, I am willing that they should 
show their loyalty to the cause of 
right and to the spread of the prin- 



ELDER SEYMOUR B. YOUNG. 



121 



ciples of temperance, and vote as 
you voted here, day before yester- 
day, for the suppression of the vice 
of the drunkard; and also for the 
establishment of more definite rules 
enjoining upon this people, and 
every other people, the observance 
of the Sabbath day. I have seen, 
with a very great deal of dissatis- 
faction, for the last two or three 
years, in this our beloved city of 
Salt Lake, the teams and men em- 
ployed by the City of Salt Lake, 
working, driving, plowing and 
scraping, placing down pavement 
in these streets on the Sabbath day. 
working as vigorously on that day 
as on any other day in the week. I 
am also reminded now that I have 
seen the saloons, that have been 
licensed by other influences than the 
"Mormon" people, running night 
and day, Sunday and week days 
alike, ready to receive the wayward 
man or foolish person within those 
drinking dens, and there administer 
the cup that inebriates, and that 
destroys the soul. When I voted 
with you on this question, and lifted 
my voice as loud as. I could, that I 
might at least hear my own ex- 
pression on the subject, I believed 
with all my heart that you voted 
as I did, sincerely, and with the 
hope that your influence, from this 
time, would be felt from' one end 
of the land to the other. As it is 
a fact that you brethren and sisters 
here assembled on that day, and 
on the days subsequent, are a rep- 
resentative body of this great peo- 
ple, I am satisfied that the influence 
of that vote will be carried to all 
of our organizations. 

I rejoice today, my brethren and 
sisters, when I remember the open- 
ing remarks of President Smith; 
and I hope we will all follow his 
instructions. He called our atten- 
tion to the extensive neglect of the 



people to observe that law, that 
commandment which the Lord gave 
for the preservation of His people, 
that will give them length of years, 
and spiritual as well as physical 
strength ; for in the act of obedience 
to this great commandment we are 
insured these blessings of the Lord. 
I know by my own experience that 
when I have endeavored, with what 
little ability I have, to exemplify 
His word and keep His command- 
ments, I have realized a direct an- 
swer to my prayers, and have felt 
within my soul that the Lord had 
been kind and merciful to me, be- 
cause I had shown a willingness to 
do His will ; and I know that is the 
experience of the Elders as they go 
out into the nations of the earth. 
They speak with power and with 
strength because they feel that they 
are on the Lord's business, that 
they are preaching His Gospel, that 
they are exemplar? of the life thai 
He has designed they should live. 
While I apply this word of com- 
mendation to our Elders, I apply it 
likewise to our brethren in their 
local capacities, as presidents of 
stakes, as bishops of wards. The 
most successful officers in the 
Church are those who live closest 
to the Lord. This we see exempli- 
fied in these great gatherings,for we 
do know that our brethren who pre- 
side over us are devoted to the work 
of the Lord, and are determinea 
to magnify the holy calling which 
has been laid upon them. They are 
exemplary in their lives, and we 
see it evidenced. When they stand 
before the people to proclaim the 
word of the Lord unto us, we know 
that it comes from their hearts 
which are pure and clean before 
Him. 

I rejoice to be able to bear this 
testimony to you today, my breth- 
ren and sisters. I rejoice in being 



122 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



here in this great congregation of 
the saints. These are gatherings long 
to be remembered ; they will be 
historic forever. The words that 
come from our President, and oth- 
er leaders, will be remembered; 
they wdl be recorded for us and our 
children to read in the future. I 
refer to the record of these great 
gatherings of annual and semi- 
annual conferences. 

My brethren and sisters, there 
are many things that need reform- 
ing. There is a very good chance 
for every Elder in Israel to preach 
the Gospel, not only abroad in the 
nations but at home, by the firesides 
of the people, in the streets, upon 
the sidewalk. Wherever we trav- 
el we generally find an opportunity 
to correct evil, and we should do 
so in a mild spirit, even the spirit 
of our Lord and Savior; not rail 
against evil but kindly call the at- 
tention of the trespasser to the fact 
that he is not alligned with the 
Spirit of the Gospel. As Jesus 
taught, let us forgive our enemies, 
and always lend a helping hand to 
our neighbors. He said: "Thou 
shalt love the Lord thy God with all 
thy heart and thy neighbor as thy- 
self." Sometimes we find it difficult 
to love some of our neighbors' ac- 
tions. During the history of this 
people, we have seen times and ex- 
periences wherein we could not en- 
dorse the actions of our neighbors ; 
yet if they will repent of their sins, 
and receive the Gospel ;wewill glad- 
ly offer them, in the name ofjesus, 
salvation and redemption. This is the 
duty and calling of every Latter- 
day Saint Elder. 

I pray the Lord to bless our lead- 
ers, and to bless the people all the. 
day _long\ that He will give us 
hearts to understand and a determi- 
nation to carry out the will of the 



Lord, and to fulfill His purposes in 
our creation, that we may inherit 
eternal life, with our loved ones and 
with all the saints, is my prayer, in 
the name of Jesus. Amen. 

"Sweet Spirit, hear my prayer," 
was sung by Sister Claribel Gard- 
ner. 



PATKIARCH JOHN SMITH. 

It is with peculiar feelings, my 
brethren and sisters, that I stand 
before you on this occasion. I have 
listened attentively to the remarkr 
which have been made during this 
conference, and I can indorse every 
sentiment, every word, and bear 
testimony that the sayings we have 
listened to have come from the 
right source ; they have been grtei; 
to us through the whisperings of 
the Good Spirit with which owe 
Father in Heaven has inspired 
those who have spoken to us. I 
say to the people I trust that 
these instructions will sink deep in- 
to their hearts, and that they may 
profit thereby. 

I can bear testimony to the truth 
of this work. I bear you my testi- 
mony that Joseph Smith was the 
prophet of the living God, and that 
through his labors and the gifts 
which came from the Father, this 
work has been thus far established, 
and that his successors have been 
in the true path, that they have 
worked and labored for the further- 
ence of the cause of truth. They 
have been men of God, proph- 
ets, seers, and revelators and 
their teachings have been 
just and true, I can also bear 
testimony to the guidance of 
the Spirit of the Lord in many 
ways, for myself individually. On

one or two occasions, from over- 
work, exposure, and so forth, phys- 
ically I have been broken down, 
but through the faith and prayers 
of the saints, I have been restored. 
I can bear testimony that the Lord 
has heard my petitions, not only in 
my own behalf but also in behalf 
of many of the people. I often 
meet individuals who have received 
blessings under my hands, pro- 
mises and so forth, and they have 
borne testimony that the words 
which I have spoken, under these 
circumstances have been prophetic, 
that the promises I have made havt 
come true, every word. 

Although I am not, probably, 
living in the full sense of the word 
up to the revealed law in all re- 
spects, I have striven to do my 
duty ; I have tried to do that which 
the Father has called me to do. A-; 
a rule, there are many people more 
guilty of sin of omission than 
sins of commission, and I trust that 
this has been my lot. I admonish 
the people to try to understand their 
duties, to try to live in obedience to 
the laws of God, and to keep His 
commandments. If we as a peo- 
ple will listen to the whisperings 
of the still small voice we will not 
often err in judgment; and if we 
call upon the Father, in humility, in 
a proper way, He will hear our 
petitions and answer them. I often 
admonish the people when they get 
their blessings under my hands, 
and say to them they must first 
learn to listen to the whisperings of 
the still small voice ; and if they will 
seek for the gift of discernment, 
they will be guided by the Spirit 
of Truth. 

I pray God, the Eternal Father,, 
to let His blessings rest upon all 
Israel, and guide us in the true 
path, that when we have finished 
our work here, we may be worthy 



of His blessings. May Father add 
His blessings unto us, qualify us 
for every duty, that we may fill 
the missions whereunto He has 
called us. If we will strive diligent- 
ly to do this, His blessings will be 
with us and make us equal to every 
task. May the Lord help us to fill 
the mission whereunto we are 
called, and thereby be worthy of 
His continued favor, I ask in the 
name of Jesus. Amen.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 

CLOSING REMARKS. 

Deaths in .the missions. — Blessing of 
Heaven invoked upon the Priesthood 
and Saints, and upon the Nation. — 
Thankfulness expressed that Utah is 
represented in Congress by good men. 

For the benefit of the congrega- 
tion, I will announce that the fol- 
lowing elders have passed away in 
the various missions since Jan. 1, 
1908: 

Leroy Hall, Southern States mis- 
sion, typhoid fever. 

Burdette P. Burdette, Swiss and 
German mission, drowned. 

Everett Hall, Central States mis- 
sion, typhoid fever. 

John A. Southwick, New Zea- 
land, typhoid fever. 

Emil J. Huber, Turkish mission, 
typhoid fever. 

John Leroy Tripp, Netherlands, 
appendicitis. 

John Loosly, Swiss and German 
mission, heart failure. 

This is sad news. We are sorry 
indeed for the kindred and loved 
ones of these good and faithful el- 
ders who have met death while la- 
boring in the missionary field. The 
Lord prolong their memories in 
Zion, for they died with the har- 
ness on — faithful to the covenants 
they had made and the commis- 
sion with which they were sent 
forth to preach the gosp.el. 

There are now laboring in the 
mission fields a little over 2,000 
•elders. 

(After announcing the special 
Priesthood meeting, President 
Smith continued) : 

I desire to express briefly the sin- 
cere prayer of my heart for all this 
congregation and for all the faith- 
ful Latter-day Saints who have 



been in attendance here during this 
most interesting and profitable con- 
ference. I feel in my heart to in- 
voke the blessings of the Lord more 
abundantly upon all the presiding 
general authorities of the Church 
and upon all the presidents of stakes 
and their counselors, the members 
of each high council, and upon all 
the bishops and their counselors 
throughout the length and breadth 
of Zion. I pray God to bless 
all our auxiliary organizations 
and prosper them in the labor that 
they have been called to perform. 
May the Lord give them joy and 
satisfaction in their labors. May 
they be interested, earnest, devoted, 
diligent and prayerful, that they 
may enjoy abundantly the spirit of 
their callings, and that their labors 
may be a blessing, a pleasure and a 
joy unto them, and exceedingly 
profitable to all the children of Zion 
for whom they labor. 

I pray God, my heavenly Father, 
to bless you as elders in Israel, as 
high priests, as seventies, and all the 
lesser priesthood. Mav peace abide 
and abound with you, and oh ! may 
the Spirit of truth, may the enlight- 
ening influence of the Holy Spirit, 
may the power of the living God 
rest down upon those, one and all, 
who have been ordained to the holy 
Priesthood which is after the order 
of the Son of God, and the append- 
ages that belong to it ! May the 
Lord bless you in your homes ; bless 
you as husbands ; bless your wives ; 
bless your children and your chil- 
dren's children to the latest gener- 
ation ! May God prosper Israel in 
all her abidings ! May the Lord 
bless the earth for your sake and 
make it fruitful ! May He prosper 
you and bless you ! May He multi- 
ply your flocks and your herds and 
prosper you in the labor of your

hands; and may you always feel 
inspired and inclined to honor the 
Lord with the first fruits of all your 
increase; so shall your barns be 
filled with plenty, and the Lord will 
pour out His Spirit upon you more 
abundantly! God bless Zion, and 
the Lord have mercv upon her ene- 
mies and those that seek her hurt! 
I have no fears in my heart, or 
mind, that that which is called 
"Mormonism" — which is indeed the 
gospel of Jesus Christ — will not 
bear the scrutiny of science and 
the researches of the learned and 
literate into all truth. The Gospel 
of Jesus is founded in truth. Ev- 
ery principle of it is susceptible of 
demonstration beyond any just rea- 
son for contradiction. The Lord is 
doing His work and will do it, and 
no power can stay it. 

I desire that the blessings of the 
Lord may be upon our choir here, 
who have made music for us dur- 
ing the Sabbath day, for they were 
here then in full number. These 
days of labor, they are under the ne- 
cessity of following their various 
occupations, and they are not able to 
be present, for they are bread-win- 
ners ; they have to labor with their 
hands for their livelihood, but they 
give their Sabbath day and they 
give their time for practice for the 
benefit of the Church ; and we ask 
God to bless them for it. May He 
unite them' together, give them con- 
fidence in their leaders, and give 
their leaders power and influence 
over them for good. May the Lord 
bless Brother Stephens, Brother 
McClellan, and their assistants, and 
all the members of the choir. 

I ask God, my heavenly Father, 
to bless my counselors. May He 
bless President Winder, a noble 
spirit, an honest man, a man of 
truth, a man of God ; and I pray 



God to bless Brother Lund, who is 
in all respects equal to Brother 
Winder in his integrity, in his love 
for the truth, and in his devotion to 
the cause of Zion! May the Lord 
bless us all and preserve us from 
our enemies until we shall complete 
our mission in the world ; and while 
we live may He help us to be val- 
iant in the testimony of Jesus 
Christ, true to our covenants, true 
to our people, and true to God until 
we shall finish our work ! This is 
my prayer for you all and for all 
Israel. 

I pray for the prosperity of our 
great nation, for the -blessing of God 
to be upon the executive, the judi- 
cial and the legislative branches of 
our government. May the Lord 
bless our government and lead those 
that hold the power in their hands 
to do that which is righteous, pleas- 
ing and acceptable unto God, who 
established this great government 
by His own will and providence ! I 
thank God, my heavenly Father, 
that this State of Utah is, and has 
been, represented in the halls of 
Congress by honest men, men after 
God's own heart, men who love 
their people and who are just and 
impartial and true to the interests of 
all the citizens of our state. I thank- 
God that we are blessed with the 
privilege of representing ourselves 
rather than being misrepresented by 
our enemies, in the halls of Con- 
gress; and in the name of common 
sense I deplore the thought that 
any Latter-day Saint should regret 
that good and true men have been 
chosen — not by the Church, but by 
their own political parties — to rep- 
resent the State of Utah in the halls 
of Congress. Thank God for it. 
That is my sentiment, and I hope 
that I shall not see the day soon 
when we will have the misfortune

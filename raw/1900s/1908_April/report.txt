Hold us with Thy powerful hand."

over-ruled for good. — The Saints' bus-

I esteem it a pleasant duty to at- 
tempt to make a few remarks at the 
opening of this our 78th Annual 
Conference. I am delighted with the 
vast number of brethren and sisters 
who are in attendance this morning. 
I am glad to look into your faces, 
to see you,and to,realize,asI am made 
to do this morning by your 
presence, the interest that you feel 
in the cause of Zion,and in the work 
of the Lord in which we are engag- 
ed. It is also evidence of 
the interest you feel in the 
matters that may be presented 
to the conference for your approv- 
al ; we desire and hope that we will 
be able to present only such mat- 
ters to you, for your action and ac- 
ceptation, as will be pleasing to you 
and acceptable to the Lord. 

I believe that we have every rea- 
son to feel grateful to our Heaven- 
ly Father, the Giver of every good 
and perfect gift, for His merciful 
providjences and wonderful kind- 
ness that have been extended to 
His people during the past yean 
since the last general annual session 
of the Church in conference in this 
place. The hand of the Lord is over 
His people, and His eye is upon His 
work — never was it more so than is 
visible at the present time. It is true 
that we owe to Him our deliverance 
from, our 'enemies, from those who 
have sought our hurt and who are 
still seeking our hurt. We acknowl- 
edge the hand of Him who over- 



rules all things, for we do not claim 
to possess the wisdom, the knowl- 
edge, or the power, in and of our- 
selves, to accomplish that which 
has been accomplished, or to effect 
the deliverance that has been 
wrought out for the people of God 
since the incipiencey of this work. 
We realize that it has been by the 
favor, and mercy, and protecting 
care of Almighty God that His peo- 
ple and the work of redemption, 
established in the latter days 
through the Prophet Joseph Smith, 
have been preserved and brought 
to their present standing, power, 
and influence in the midst of the 
earth. We thank God for His 
mercies and blessings ; and I do not 
know but what we owe in some 
small degree gratitude to those who 
have bitterly opposed the work of 
the Lord ; for in all their opposings 
and bitter strife against our peo- 
ple the Lord has developed His 
power and wisdom, and has brought 
His people more fully into the 
knowledge and favor of the intelli- 
gent people of the earth. Through 
the very means used by those who 
have opposed the work of God, He 
has brought out good for Zion. Yet, 
it is written, and I believe it is true, 
that although it must needs be that 
offenses come, woe unto them by 
whom they come; but they are in 
the hands of the Lord as we are. 
We bring no railing accusation 
against them. We are willing to 
leave them in the hands of the Al- 
mighty to deal with them as seem- 
eth Him good. Our business is to 
work righteousness in the earth, to 
seek for the development of a 
knowledge of God's will and of 
God's ways, and of His great and 
glorious truths which He has re- 
vealed through the instrumental- 
ity of Joseph the Prophet, not only 
for the salvation of the living but

for the redemption and salvation 
of the dead. 

I rejoice as much tjpday— and 
more, if I am capable of rejoicing 
more, in the work of the Lord than 
I ever did before. I feel today as 
confident and as sure in the con- 
tinued providences of the Lord, in 
His continued mercy toward His 
people, and in the glorious fact that 
it is His work, that He is direct- 
ing it and will continue to do so, as 
I ever felt in my life. Indeed there 
is not the shadow of a doubt in my 
mind in regard to these things. I 
feel confident of the truth of God's 
work, of the mission of the Prophet 
Joseph, of .the truth and divinity of 
the precious ordinances of the Gos- 
pel that have been restored to man 
in the latter-day, and I believe that 
this Gospel is the power of God un- 
to salvation. I feel sure of it. I 
am convinced of the truth of these 
things in every fiber of my being. 

I "feel that it is a great privilege 
for us to be permitted to come to- 
gether from time to time in. the 
capacity in which we have met this 
morning. Here, during our confer- 
ence, the elders of the Church will 
have opportunity to bear their testi- 
mony of the truth, to exhort and to 
admonish, to advise andj . counsel 
and instruct the people, as the 
Spirit of the Lord may move upon 
them and give them utterance. 
Here we have the opportunity of 
mingling together, of renewing ac- 
quaintances, and of partaking of the 
spirit of the work of Ijhe Lord 
which pervades assemblies of this 
kind. I rejoice to see you here 
and welcome you today. I pray 
that God's blessings may be extend- 
ed to every soul present this morn- 
ing, that life, and health, and peace 
may be our portion. I prav that the 
protecting care of the Lord may be 
upon you, individually and col- 



lectively, and upon all that you 
possess, all that the Lord has given 
unto you. I trust that we may have 
a time of rejoicing, and that at 
the conclusion of our conference we 
may return to our homes having re- 
newed strength and determination 
in our souls to continue on and on 
in faithfulness to the covenants that 
we have made with the Father of 
Lights, with Whom there is no 
variableness nor shadow of turn- 
ing. Let us strive to keep sacred 
the covenants we have made with 
Him in the waters of baptism, and 
in the ordinances of the Gospel, 
wherein we have promised to be 
His children in very deed. 

It may be proper for me to say 
that since our last semi-annual con- 
ference, quite a number of our be- 
loved brethren and sisters have been 
called from this sphere of action 
Some of them were prominent in 
the ministry, and all have been be- 
loved, and honored for their integ- 
rity to the cause of Zion. They have 
gone to meet their Father, and to 
render that account of their minis- 
try in the world, as described by 
Alma the Prophet, by which they 
shall receive that judgment which 
will assign them to the paradise of 
God, where they shall await their 
resurrection from the dead. "The 
Lord giveth and . the Lord taketh 
away," and we feel in our hearts 
to exclaim, like him of old, "Bless- 
ed be the name of the Lord." 

I will say to my brethren and sis- 
ters who are present that I believe, 
in all candor and in truth, that the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints, now organized in the 
midst of these eternal hills, was 
never in a better condition, spirit- 
ual or temporal, than today. The 
people never were more united than 
they are now. They never observed 
the laws of God more faithfully,

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



or more truly and honestly than 
they are doing today, not only upon 
general principles, or in a general 
way, but specifically they are be- 
coming more careful in their ob- 
servance of the wortls that the Lord 
has spoken for their good. I be- 
lieve that we are coming nearer to 
the point where we shall be able 
to observe that great and glorious 
law of temperance which the Lord 
Almighty has given unto us, where- 
in He has said that strong drink is 
not good, that tobacco is not for 
the habitual use of man, not for the. 
stomach, but for sick cattle. We 
are coming to the conclusion that 
the Lord knew best, when He de- 
livered to the Church, through the 
Prophet Joseph Smith, that "Word 
of Wisdom," contained in the book 
of reflations from the Lord. Al- 
though we see a few, professing 
to be Latter-day Saints, who are 
still slaves to the debased appetite 
for tobacco, and perhaps some with 
an appetite for strong drink, yet the 
great majority of the people of the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints are coming nearer and 
nearer to a proper observance of the 
law which the Lord has given to us 
for our health, for the preserva- 
tion of our lives ; that we may be 
in harmony with His Spirit and His 
will, that we may be clean and un- 
dented, that we may be nearer like 
unto Him Who was without sin, 
Who was indeed pure and holy as 
God is pure and holy. When I see 
a man professing to be a Latter- 
day Saint, or even professing to be 
a member of the Church, though 
not making any great professions 
of being a Latter-day Saint, befoul- 
ing His breath with intoxicating 
drink, with the fumes of tobacco, or 
unnecessarily indulging in stim- 
ulants, it grieves my spirit, my 
soul goes ( out for him in pity and 



in sorrowful regret, and I wonder 
why it is that we, individually, can- 
not realize our own folly, our own 
degradation in yielding t to these 
pernicious habits that are neither 
useful or ornamental, nor in the 
least degree beneficial, but indeed 
are harmful. Why cannot we rise 
to that degree of intelligence that 
would enable us to say to the 
tempter, "Get behind me," and to 
turn our backs upon the practice of 
evil. How humiliating it must be 
to a thoughtful man to feel that he 
is a slave to his appetites, or to 
an over-weening and pernicious 
habit, desire, or passion. We be- 
lieve in strict temperance. We be- 
live in abstinence from all injuri- 
ous practices and from the use of all 
hurtful things. Poison, in the judg- 
men of the physician, may be bene- 
ficial, under some conditions in life, 
as a momentary relief; but poison, 
under any circumstance, should on- 
ly be used as a temporary expedi- 
ent, necessary, perhaps, in our best 
judgment, for the time being, for 
the instant — for sudden and certain 
desired relief, — but the continued 
use of that poison will fasten its 
fangs upon us, so to speak, in such 
a way that by and by we will find 
that we are over-powered by it, and 
we become slaves of the pernicious 
habit that becomes a tyranical mas- 
ter over us. 

There is a general movement 
throughout the land looking to- 
wards local option and temperance 
among the people of our state, and 
of the adjoining states. I sincerely 
hope that every Latter-day Saint 
will co-operate with this movement, 
in order that we may curtail the 
monstrous evils which exist, espec- 
ially in our cities. I wish to say 
that I am in sympathy with this 
movement, and I know that my 
brethren are united with me and in

harmony with the efforts that are 
being made to establish temperance 
throughout the land. We want 
nothing drastic, nothing that would 
be illiberal or oppressive, but 
we do think that the people 
ought to have their choice as 
to whether they will permit or have 
in their midst drunkenness, rioting, 
and murder — which is too often the 
result of drunkenness, — or whether 
they will insist on abstinence from 
these things, that the people might 
have peace insured among them, 
and that their children might not 
be subjected to the temptations in- 
to which they are thrown because 
of the presence of these evils. 

Several very important move- 
ments have been inaugurated of 
late among us for the advantage of 
the Saints, and especially for the 
benefit and advancement of those 
who are associated with the various 
quorums of the Priesthood. I de- 
sire to mention the effort that is be- 
ing made by our Seventies in their 
organization of classes and schools 
for the instruction of the members 
of their quorums, that they might 
be qualified for the great work of 
the ministry to which they are dedi- 
cated. Efforts are also being made 
to organize and put to usefulness 
the quorums of the Lesser Priest- 
hood. In my judgment, we are pro- 
gressing rapidly in these directions. 
It is also understood that those of 
the Melchizedek Priesthood, the 
presidents of High Priests quorums, 
and the High Priests throughout 
the Church are instituting methods 
by which those who are members 
of these quorums may learn their 
duty and become familiar with the 
laws of the Church, which should 
govern their actions, that they may 
be, indeed, fathers among the peo- 
ple, exercising the functions that 
belong to their calling as High 



Priests in Zion or in the Church. 
They should be examplars; they 
should be teachers. They should 
understand, above all other 
men, the principles of government 
and the order of the Church. They 
should move forward solidly in the 
exercise of their influence, indi- 
vidually and collectively, against all 
evil, against the spirit of indiffer- 
ence, the spirit of neglect and un- 
belief. Every man who holds the 
office of High Priest in the Church 
or has been ordained a High Priest, 
whether he is called to active posi- 
tion in the Church or not — inas- 
much as he has .been ordained a 
High Priest, should feel that he 
is obliged, — that it is his bounden 
duty to set an example before the 
old and young worthy of emulation* 
and to place himself in a position to 
be a teacher of righteousness, not 
only by precept but more particu- 
larly by example — [giving to the 
younger ones the benefit of ex- 
perience of age, and thus becoming 
individually a power in the midst 
of the communities in which they 
dwell. Every man who has light 
should let that light shine that those 
who see it may glorify their Father 
which is in Heaven, and honor him 
who posseses the light and who 
causes it to shine forth for the bene- 
fit of others. In a local capacity, 
there is no body of Priesthood in 
the Church who should excel,or who 
are expected to excel, those who are 
called to bear the office of High 
Priest in the Church. From among 
those who hold this office are chos- 
en the presidents of stakes and their 
counselors, and the High Councils 
of the fifty-six stakes of Zion which 
are now organized ; and from this 
office are chosen the bishops, and the 
bishops' counselors, in every ward 
in Zion; and heretofore, of this of- 
fice are those who have been called

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



to take charge of our stake Mutual 
Improvement organizations. Those 
holding this office are, as a rule, 
men of advanced years, and varied 
experience, men who have filled 
missions abroad, who have preach- 
ed the Gospel to the nations of the 
earth, and who have had experience 
not only abroad but at home. Their 
experience and wisdom is the ripen- 
ed fruit of years of labor in the 
Church, and they should exercise 
that wisdom for the benefit of all 
with whom they are associated. 

The Seventies are laboring for 
the purposq of qualifying them- 
selves for the work of the ministry 
abroad among the nations of the 
earth, which is their legitimate call- 
ing. I commend the efforts of our 
brethren of the Seven Presidents of 
Seventies in their endeavor to bring 
about the good results they have 
in view in this direction. 

The Elders' quorums should al- 
so be looked after, and those who 
preside in them should be active 
in season and out of season. They 
should be vigilant and faithful 
in looking after those in- 
trusted to their care, and are sub- 
ject to their direction and counsel. 

The Bishops and the Lesser 
Priesthood should be very active 
and energetic. We should look af- 
ter our boys w'ho have been ordain- 
ed Deacons, Teachers, and Priests 
in the Church. We should find 
something for them to do in their 
callings. Let them be appointed to 
active labors in their several 
spheres. Put forward those who 
have not had experience to accomp- 
any those who have, and give them 
something to do. Let the Deacons 
not only assist to keep the meeting 
houses in repair and their grounds 
in proper condition, but let them be 
set to work to look after the wel- 
fare of the widows and fatherless, 



the aged and the poor. Many of 
our young men who are idle, 
languishing for the want of some- 
thing to do, could be made most 
useful in helping the poor to clean 
up about their homes and make 
them comfortable, and helping 
them to live in such a way that life 
would be pleasant to them. There 
is no reason why the members of 
the Lesser Priesthood should not 
be engaged in missions and labors 
of this kind. Instead of calling up- 
on the Trustee-in-trust for the 
tithing to pay for planting trees 
to ornament the grounds of the 
meeting houses, or to paint the 
woodwork, or to renovate and 
cleanse the houses of worship, to 
make them suitable for the worship 
of God, — call the Lesser Priesthood 
to the work. Give them something 
to do that will make them interested 
in the work of the Lord, and above 
all things direct their energies in 
such a way that they will be helpful 
to the needy, helpful to the poor, 
helpful to themselves and to the 
Church. It will benefit them not 
only as regards their standing in 
the Church, and their faith in the 
Priesthood which they bear, but it 
will help them to become better 
boys at home. They will be more 
dutiful to their parents, more re- 
spectful to their brothers and sis- 
ters and others. They will become 
more mindful of their duties at 
home and abroad. This is in the 
line of discipline, of instruction and 
of gaining practical experience. In- 
stead of leaving these young peo- 
ple, who are full of energy, to roam 
the streets, to congregate upon the 
corners, or to idle away their time 
in folly, and in contracting, per- 
haps foolish habits and practices, 
give them something to do that wiil 
be uplifting, something that will 
be enlarging to their souls, and that

will be an instruction to them that 
they will remember all their days. 

I want to say also, that so far as 
I know, and I think that we have 
the opportunity of knowing pretty 
well, — the condition of our auxil- 
iary organizations is satisfactory. 
As a general thing they are in good 
condition. We may lack in some 
things, but as a whole our auxiliary 
organizations are active and ener- 
getic and are working constantly 
for individual and general good. I 
believe that there is a feeling of 
harmony existing between all these 
associations, one with another. 
There is no strife existing among 
them. There is no contention. Indeed 
the spirit of contention is a thing 
not known among the Latter-day 
Saints. You find the spirit of con- 
tention only among apostates and 
those who have denied the faith, 
those who have turned away from 
the truth and have become enemies 
to God and His work. There you 
will find the spirit of contention, the 
spirit of strife. There you will find 
them wanting to "argue the ques- 
tion," and to dispute with you all 
the time. Their food, their meat, 
and their drink is contention which 
is abominable in the sight of 
the Lord. We do not contend. We 
are not contentious, for if we were 
we would grieve the Spirit of the 
Lord from us. Just as apostates 
do and have always done. 

Perhaps I should not have oc- 
cupied so much time. I have been 
suffering a little of late, like a great 
many others, with a cold, and I 
find that my talking is affecting my 
voice somewhat, but I have some 
data here that I thought I would 
mention in a general way. 

One item is the number of mis- 
sionaries laboring in the worid, — 
that is Elders sent out from Zion 
into the mission field: On the 31st 



of last December we had 1810 mis- 
sionaries from Zion out in the var- 
ious mission fields in the world. 
There .were also forty-four sisters 
who have accompanied their hus- 
bands upon these missions. Be- 
sides these there are a number of 
local Elders working in the min- 
istry. 

We sent out, during the year 
1907, into the various missionary 
fields 927 Elders, who will spend 
from two to four years on their 
missions. 

There have returned from the 
various mission fields, during the 
year 1907, 707 Elders. 

In this connection I wish to men- 
tion the fact that the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 
through their Trustee-in-Trust, 
have paid the returning fares of all 
these Elders. They go out into 
the world at their own expense. 
They maintain themselves in their 
missions, at their own expense or 
by the assistance of their parents 
or kindred at home, and the little 
assistance that they may receive 
from time to time from the peo- 
ple among whom they labor. 

I have another list, which is too 
long to be given here today, show- 
ing the number of Elders in the 
mission field from each stake of 
Zion. We can tell you, in a mom- 
ent, just how many Elders each 
stake has in the mission field; but 
I feel that to continue longer would 
be to trespass upon your time. 

I pray God to bless you. I feel 
joyous and happy in the ministry, 
in the work of the Lord. 

We will hear, during the con- 
ference, reports from other quart- 
ers. A very careful and exhaustive 
auditation of the accounts and 
books, the receipts and expendi- 
tures of the tithing, for the last

year, has been made by the Audit- 
ing Committee of the Church. 

It just comes to rnv mind that 
Elder Charles W. Nibley, having 
been called to the Presiding Bishop- 
ric, has been released from the 
Auditing Committee, and Brother 
Henry H. Rolapp, of Ogden, has 
been appointed to act in his stead. 
I would like to submit the name of 
Brother Henry H. Rolapp before 
this meeting for your approval and 
acceptance to act upon this commit- 
tee. (Vote unanimous). 

The general authorities of the 
Church will be presented possibly 
tomorrow, and if not then, the next 
day. We desire the brethren and 
sisters who come to the conference 
to come with their hearts full of 
the spirit of wisdom and of truth, 
and if you discern in us any lack 
of wisdom, or of judgment, any 
failure in the performance of our 
duty, we desire that those who have 
superior experience and knowledge, 
and greater intelligence, will do us 
the honor and favor of coming to 
us individually and letting us know 
wherein we come short. We will 
give a thousand errors, ifVe can find 
them or if they exist in us, — any 
moment for one truth ; and we will 
swap off a hundred mistakes, aye 
thousands of mistakes if they can 
be found, for one accurate, con- 
sistent, and proper action. We are 
seeking for the truth. We love the 
truth, and we know when we learn 
the truth that it is the truth. We 
believe in the divine mission of 
Christ and in His great plan of re- 
demption for the living and the 
dead. We belive in the divine mis- 
sion of Joseph Smith the Prophet. 
We belive in every word that he 
spoke by the inspiration of Al- 
mighty God, and not one word that 
he ever uttered or gave as a revela- 
tion from God will fall to the 



ground as error, but it will stand 
upon its own merit as truth, God's 
truth, eternal truth,— "While life 
and thought and being last or im- 
mortality endures." This is our tes- 
timony to the divinity of the mis- 
sion of the Prophet Joseph Smith, 
and to the divine revelations that 
the Lord made, through him, to 
the world. God help us to receive 
the truth and abide by it, is my 
prayer, in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

The choir sang the anthem, 
"From afar, Gracious Lord, Thou 
hast gathered Thy flock.". 



PRESIDENT JOHN R. WINDER. 

President Smith's sentiments endorsed. 
— Greatly increased interest in Tem- 
ple work. — Never has been a brighter 
day for the Saints. 

In consequence of a very sudden 
cold I have taken upon my lungs, I 
do not know that I can make this 
large congregation hear, but I de- 
sire to say to you that I endorse ev- 
ery word and sentiment that has 
been spoken in our hearing, this 
morning, by our President. I re- 
peat that I am in strict harmony 
with him in every sentiment he has 
expressed. I am thankful for the 
opportunity of saying this much, 
and acknowledging mv gratitude to 
the Lord that He has been so good 
to me, and spared my life to see 
another conference, and to again 
meet with you, my brethren and 
sisters. 

Every day of my life I see new 
evidences of the truth of the ever- 
lasting Gospel, and of the mission 
of the Prophet Joseph Smith. There 
was one thing the President re- 
ferred to incidentally that I would 
like to mention, and that is in re-

lation to the salvation of the dead. 
You will all remember the great 
anxiety of the Prophet Joseph 
Smith in regard to this subject. On 
more than one occasion he said that 
he was very much concerned about 
this matter, and desired to bring it 
before the people. I rejoice, my 
brethren and sisters, to be enabled 
to say to you this morning that 
there has been a wonderful increase 
in the interest manifested in this 
work, especially during the past six 
months. The Temple, the House of 
the Lord, has been so crowded, on 
many occasions, that we have had to 
send people away, much to our re- 
gret, however. Every day shows 
an increase in this work. The Lat- 
ter-day Saints come here from all 
parts of the country, from Old 
Mexico, New Mexico, Arizona, and 
all the settlements in the south, as 
well as from Canada, from Idaho, 
and all the settlements in the north. 
They flock here by the hundreds, 
and I may say by the thousands. 
This is one of the evidences, to me, 
my brethren and sisters, that the 
people are improving; and they are 
fulfilling the promises that have 
been made by the prophets of old, 
that the hearts of the fathers would 
turn to the children, and the hearts 
of the children would turn to the 
fathers. There is a greater interest 
in this direction, within the last six 
months, than I have ever seen be- 
fore ; and that is only one item that 
causes my heart to rejoice this 
morning. 

I never saw a brighter day than 
this, for the Latter-day Saints. Ev- 
erything that I see around me and 
everything that I hear causes me to 
rejoice. We have heard this morn- 
ing that there are eighteen hundred 
missionaries abroad in the world 
preaching the Gospel of life and sal- 



vation, "Peace on earth, good will 
to men." That is the message they 
go abroad to deliver, and it is left 
optional with every person to accept 
or reject it. If they accept it, it is 
life and salvation; if they reject it, 
it may be their condemnation. 

Now, my brethren and sisters, I 
did want to say just these few 
words to you, and to exoress my 
thanks and gratitude to God, my 
eternal Father, that He has pre- 
served my life this long. I am' now 
in my eighty-seventh year, and I 
am thankful that I have all my fac- 
ulties. 

I pray God, my eternal Father, 
that He will continue to bless and 
prosper His people; and He surely 
will, my brethren and sisters, if we 
fulfil and discharge our duties as 
we ought to do ; and may the Lord 
help us, is my prayer. Amen. 



PRESIDENT ANTHON H. LTJND. 

The Saints not contentious, but peace- 
makers. — The ethics of "Mormonism." 
— The gathering an important feature 
of God's work. — Outcasts from home, 
but blessed in Zion. — Joseph's prophecy 
fulfilled concerning the Rocky Moun- 
tain region. 

I am happy, this morning to 
have the privilege of being present 
with you, of listening to the dis- 
courses that we have heard, and the 
good instructions given us. I be- 
lieve that they have been enjoyed 
by all. I rejoice in the testimony 
that we have heard, and I rejoice in 
possessing this same testimony, that 
I know the Prophet Joseph Smith 
was authorized and sent of God to 
perform the great and important 
work which he accomplished. 

President Smith said that a con- 
tentious spirit showed the spirit of

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



apostasy. I thought of the words of 
the Savior: "Blessed are the peace- 
makers, for they shall be called the 
children of God." We want to be 
peacemakers. We do not want to 
contend. The Lord says to us : 
"Contend against no church, save it 
be the church of the devil." Our 
desire is not to contend, but to 
preach the Gospel of peace unto 
men. Where men want informa- 
tion concerning what we believe, 
we are always ready to give it unto 
them ; but if they only want to con- 
tend with us, and they have a quar- 
relsome spirit, we do not want to 
encourage argument with such. If. 
however, they are seeking for truth 
we are ready to meet them in a 
friendly spirit, for the sake of con- 
vincing them of the truth. The Lord 
has given unto us the truth, and the 
truth has made us free. We do not 
labor under the oppression of doubt 
and darkness, but through the truth 
revealed from heaven we have been 
set free, and we rejoice in this free- 
dom. 

I am pleased to see so many here 
this morning at the first session of 
our conference. I would like to 
read to you a few words from the 
fifty-ninth section of the Doctrine 
and Covenants : 

"Behold, blessed, saith the Lord, are 
they who have come up unto this land 
with an eye single to my glory, accord- 
ing to my commandments ; 

"For them that live shall inherit the 
earth, and them that die shall rest from 
all their labors, and their works shall 
follow them, and they shall receive a 
crown in the mansions of my Father, 
which I have prepared for them; 

"Yea, blessed are they whose feet 
stand upon the land of Zion, who have 
obeyed my Gospel, for they shall receive 
for their reward the good things of the 
earth; and it shall bring forth in its 
strength ; 

"And they shall also be crowned with 



blessings from above, yea, and with com- 
mandments not a few; and with revela- 
tions in their time : they that are faithful 
and diligent before me. 

"Wherefore I give unto them a com- 
mandment, saying thus : Thou shalt love 
the Lord thy God with all thy heart, 
with all thy might, mind, and strength ; 
and in the name of Jesus Christ thou 
shalt serve Him. 

"Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thy- 
self. Thou shalt not steal ; neither com- 
mit adultery, nor kill, nor do anything 
like unto it. 

"Thou shalt thank the Lord thy God 
in all things." 

These verses give us the ethics of 
"Morm'onism." Here also are glor- 
ious promises unto those who have 
come up to the land of Zion. 
Through the principle of gathering, 
this vast congregation is present to- 
day. Most of the older people have 
come from other states and other 
nations. They have come here be- 
cause they wanted to assemble with 
the people of God. They have left 
their homes to come to the land of 
Zion, and all those who came here 
with an eye single to the glory of 
God, have found Zion. Those who 
did not come with an eye single to 
the glory of God, but whose aim 
was to build up self, make means, 
and so forth, have not found Zion. 
but have been ready to find fault 
with it. You who came here with 
Zion in your hearts did not feel to 
find fault with existing conditions, 
although you may have had to take 
hold of labors that you had never 
been accustomed to. ' You may have 
left good homes to come here ; you 
may have tasted of poverty, and so 
on, yet, having Zion in your hearts, 
you felt you had come to the land 
that God had appointed for a gath- 
ering place for His people. 

The principle of gathering was 
taught early in the history of our 
Church. When I read the eleventh 



PRESIDENT ANTHON H. LUND. 



11 



chapter of Isaiah, which the angel 
Moroni quoted to the boy Joseph, 
then only eighteen years old, I see 
that he was taught this principle of 
gathering, and of building up a 
Zion unto God. It was not a prin- 
ciple that was evolved after the 
Church was organized and it had 
been thought best to gather togeth- 
er the people. The angel Moroni 
taught it to Joseph before any one 
was baptized in the Church. In May 
1829, the Lord revealed to Joseph 
Smith that He would gather His 
people together, and said that if 
they would come they should par- 
take of the water of life freely. The 
Prophet received this principle from 
the Lord; he could not have taken 
it from any of the existing religions, 
for it was taught in none of them. 
He was told that the Lord intended 
to gather His people, and during the 
first year after the organization of 
the Church, from month to month, 
there are allusions to this principle ; 
and before a year had passed the 
Lord spoke like this, concerning 
Zion : , 

"And the glory of the Lord shall be 
there, and the terror of the Lord also 
shall be there, insomuch that the wicked 
will not come unto it, and it shall be 
called Zion. 

"And it shall come to pass, among the 
wicked ,that every man that will not take 
his sword against his neighbor, must 
needs flee unto Zion for safety. 

"And there shall be gathered unto it 
out of every nation under heaven ; and it 
shall be the only people that shall not be 
at war one with another. 

"And it shall be said among the 
wicked, Let us not go up to battle 
against Zion, for the inhabitants of Zion 
are terrible ; wherefore we cannot stand. 

"And it shall come to pass that the 
righteous shall be gathered out from 
among all nations, and shall come to 
Zion, singing with songs of everlasting 
joy." 

This revelation was given March 



7, 1831. The Church was not then 
a year old, and but very few had ac- 
cepted the faith; but the Lord re- 
vealed through His servant, the 
Prophet Joseph, the glory that 
should come unto Zion, and He told 
him that the people of Zion should 
be gathered from every nation. 
Think of this young man called to 
lead the Church, then but twenty- 
five years of age, given this promise 
that there should be established a 
Zion to which the people should 
gather out of all nations ! What 
likelihood was there for him to im- 
agine this himself, when he looked 
at the small flock around him that 
believed in his words? But it was 
not his imaginings ; it was the rev- 
elation of God unto him that there 
should be established a Zion to 
which people should come from out 
of all nations. It was the fulfil- 
ment of the prophecies in the sec- 
ond chapter of Isaiah, and fourth 
chapter of Micah, in language sim- 
ilarly worded, when they looked 
down through the vista of time and 
saw there was to be a gathering, 
and that the people would go up to 
the "mountain of the Lord, to the 
house of the God of Jacob," in or- 
der that they might learn of His 
ways and walk in His paths. Isa- 
iah prophesied to this effect, and 
we bear testimony it is coming t<3 
pass. 

In this congregation before me 
there are people from all parts of 
the world. They have heard the 
Gospel preached in their different 
homes. They have learned what it 
means to accept the truth. They 
have learned that those who will 
live godly in Christ shall be perse- 
cuted. They had not done anything 
to deserve the strictures, the mock- 
ings, and the persecutions of their 
neighbors ; they had simply believed 



12 



(/ EN URAL CONFEREN CE. 



in the words they heard from the 
servants of God and made cove- 
nants with the Lord, in the waters 
of baptism, to serve Him'. In the 
sincerity of their hearts they had 
repented of their sins and were try- 
ing to live better lives, and for do- 
ing this their neighbors and friends, 
yea relatives, looked down upon 
them. They felt like a certain 
mother who, when she heard that 
her son had received the Gospel and 
become a Mormon, said: "Oh, how 
could you do such a thing and bring 
shame upon us. Had you stolen and 
been sent to the penitentiary, you 
could have got over that, but the 
thought of your becoming a Mor- 
mon, the thought of the shame that 
is brought upon us, makes us say 
that vou are not a son of ours." Yet 
he had done nothing except that he 
believed in the Gospel as preached 
to him and had repented of his sins 
and been baptized. Thus he was 
rejected by his own mother. In this 
way friends and relatives have ris- 
en up against those who have join- 
ed the Church. You, my brethren 
and sisters, have learned what it 
costs to join an unpopular people, 
but do you feel that you would ex- 
change the blessings you have re- 
ceived by obeying the Gospel, for 
the good will of those who despise 
yeu ? I think not. You have found 
the "pearl of great price." To you 
it is of inestimable value, and you 
cannot afford to lose it. "Blessed 
are they who have come to this 
land," says the Lord, "with an eye 
single to my glory, according to my 
commandments ;" and He also says, 
"Blessed are they whose feet stand 
upon the land of Zion, who have 
obeyed my gospel, for they shall re- 
ceive for their reward (the good 
things of the earth, and it shall 
bring forth in its strength." This 



was the promise. I have often won- 
dered if the pioneers, when they 
first saw this valley, with its barren, 
sunbaked soil, covered with sage- 
brush, except along the creeks 
where willows and a few straggling 
cottonwoods grew, thought it possi- 
ble that this promise could be ful- 
filled : that they should receive the 
good things of the earth, and that 
it should bring forth in its strength. 
When these words were revealed 
through the Prophet to the Saints 
of the Colesville branch in Jackson 
county, and they looked upon the 
beautiful country around them — 
the rolling plains, the fertile soil — 
it was easy for them to believe it; 
but it was not so easy for the Saints 
who came here to believe that this 
dry soil would be able to bring 
forth in strength the good things of 
the earth. Yet they had enduring 
faith ; they had followed their lead- 
er, President Brigham Young, over 
the plains and had come here hav- 
ing full confidence in his leadership 
for they knew that he was the suc- 
cessor of the Prophet Joseph. 

The idea of going to the Rocky 
Mountains was not original with 
President Brigham Young. He just 
executed the plan which had been 
given through the Prophet Joseph, 
when he prophesied that this peo- 
ple would gather here in the Rocky 
Mountains and become a mighty 
people. So imbued was the Prophet 
with this thought that a committee 
was appointed by him to go to the 
Rocky Mountains to examine the 
country and select a gathering place 
for the Saints. Through circum- 
stances which arose the committee 
did not go during his lifetime, but 
it shows that the Prophet Joseph, 
with the eye of -prophecy, saw what 
would come to pass. President 
Young followed him. He called 



PRESIDENT ANTHON H. LUND. 



13 



upon men to come with him, and 
having a testimony of the truth, and 
believing that he was the Prophet 
of God, they followed him. He did 
not know much about this country. 
Before them lay the pathless plains 
on which roamed the savages ; and 
beyond those plains, what? The 
Rocky Mountains, unexplored. 
Only a few had been here before the 
President, inspired by the Spirit of 
God, led the people to this place; 
and as forbidding as this land 
looked when they came here in 1847 
he still said : This is the land, and 
here shall the Temple of God be 
erected. With the eye of prophecy 
he saw the future. It was not an 
easy task that was given to the pio- 
neers to settle this country, but the 
Lord had said : "Blessed are they 
whose feet stand upon the land of 
Zion, who have obeyed my gospel, 
for they shall receive as their re- 
ward the good things of the earth, 
and it shall bring forth in its 
strength." That promise was made, 
and you can all bear testimony that 
it has been fulfilled. You can tes- 
tify that the Lord has blessed this 
land, that He has tendered the ele- 
ments, and through His blessings 
and the labors of His people this 
land has been made to blossom as a 
rose, to use the figurative language 
of the Prophet. 

The Lord is able to bless His peo- 
ple, but He asks of them' that they 
shall keep their eye single to His 
glory, single to this one aim, to 
serve Him. None can serve two 
masters. He that serves two mas- 
ters, Jesus says, will love the one 
and despise the other. We love the 
Master, we love to serve Him, for 
He is able to bless us, not only in 
the present but in all time to come. 
If we strive to live with an eye 



single to the glory of God, doing 
His will, we will be able to gather 
riches that, will be imperishable 
riches that we will not need to leave 
behind us, for they will go with us. 
When working for self we acquire 
the things that will perish, but that 
which we do through faith in God, 
with an eye single to His glory, 
with love and brotherly kindness for 
each other, that will be placed to 
our credit, and no one can take it 
from us. 

Brethren and sisters, let us all re- 
solve that we will serve God. Let 
this thought go through the heart 
of each of us : As for me and my 
house, we will serve the Lord, come 
what may. The time which the 
Lord has given us here upon the 
earth is very valuable indeed. There 
is so much that we can do. Let us 
not neglect our opportunities. Let 
us rejoice in having received this 
Gospel and the testimony that it is 
the Gospel of Christ. Let us re- 
joice that we are members of His 
Church, and resolve to so live that 
the whole world may know that we 
have received the truth and are 
what we profess to be. May God 
bless all Israel, is my prayer, in the 
name of Jesus. Amen. 

The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn: 

Our God, we raise to Thee 
Thanks for Thy blessings free 

We here enjoy; 
In this far western land, 
A true and chosen band, 
Led hither by Thy hand, 

We sing for joy. 

Benediction was pronounced by 
Patriarch John Smith. 

Conference was adjourned until 
2 p. m.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



AFTERNOON SESSION. 

Conference was resumed at 2 p. 

m. 

. The choir and congregation sang 
the. hymn commencing : 

O ye mountains high, where the clear 

blue sky- 
Arches over the vales of the free, 
Where the pure breezes blow, and the 

clear streamlets flow, 
■ How I've longed to your bosom to 

flee. 

Prayer was offered by Patriarch 
Angus M. Cannon. 

The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn: 

say, what is truth? 'Tis the fairest 

gem 

That the riches of worlds can produce ; 
And priceless the value of truth will be 
when 

The proud monarch's costliest diadem 
Is counted but dross and refuse. 

PRESIDENT FRANCIS M. LYMAN. 

The people of Utah prosperous. — Tem- 
perance a fundamental principle of the 
Church. — Time has arrived for general 
observance of the Word of Wisdom. — 
Reformation necessary to prepare for 
the Lord's coming. — America the land 
of Zion, its inhabitants should be 
righteous.' — Evidences of divinity of 
latter-day work. 

I am sure that we all rejoiced, 
this morning, in listening to the 
opening remarks of President 
Smith and his counselors. We are 
favored with splendid weather, and 
a generous attendance of the people. 

1 have no doubt that the Lord is 
pleased to see His Saints come to- 
gether to worship, to receive in- 
structions, to renew their faith, and 
to listen to the word and will of the 
Lord through His servants. I trust 
that the same good spirit may abide 



with the brethren who speak this 
afternoon. Throughout our con- 
ference I anticipate a feast, for the 
Saints have been wonderfully bless- 
ed during the past year. They 
have manifested by their works that 
they are thoroughly established in 
the faith. Improvement is discov- 
ered, I believe, on every hand. Al- 
though we have passed through 
financial stringency, during the last 
six months, I believe that the peo- 
ple of this state have weathered the 
storm as well as the people of any 
state in the Union. The institu- 
tions of our state have stood the 
pressure. We have been well pre- 
pared to meet the shock, and I be- 
lieve that the situation of the peo- 
ple of this state is such that they 
will continue to prosper and grow 
stronger from this time. As a result 
our state will become remarkable 
among the states of the Union in 
many ways. 

The key-note was given this 
morning by the President. Our at- 
tention was drawn to the fact that 
the Latter-day Saints are a temper- 
ate peoole. The principle of tem- 
perance is a strong point in the 
faith of the Latter-day Saints. We 
have not always lived up to it as 
perfectly as we should have done, 
but that doctrine, with many other 
doctrines that have been made 
known by the Lord, through the 
Prophet Joseph Smith, seems to 
have taken hold of the people of our 
nation. There is a wave in favor of 
temperance, passing over the na- 
tion, growing and increasing stead- 
ily. No people in the Union should 
be as well prepared and as ready to 
take part in this movement as the 
Latter-day Saints ought to be, for 
it is quite in harmony with the fund- 
amental principles of the Gospel of 
Jesus Christ. I believe the time is 



PRESIDENT FRANCIS M. LYMAN. 



15 



ripe for Latter-day Saints, partic- 
ularly, to place themselves in ac- 
cord with this revelation, the Word 
of Wisdom, which was given in the 
beginning by the Prophet Joseph 
as a Word of Wisdom with promis- 
es which are very precious. In the 
beginning, it was not laid down as 
a strict commandment. I do not 
know whether or not the Lord took 
into account the fact that our fore- 
fathers, and our fathers, had been 
so used to many things forbidden 
in the Word of Wisdom that it 
might be difficult for them to order 
their lives in harmony with those re- 
quirements : so we were given per- 
haps thirty or forty years of train- 
ing and experience before the Lord 
announced, through His servant the 
Prophet Brigham Young, that the 
Word of Wisdom has now become 
a commandment of the Lord. Pres- 
ident Young laid it down very 
strictly and exactly from this stand 
that from that time henceforth the 
Word of Wisdom is a command- 
ment from the Lord, and all Lat- 
ter-day Saints are required to ob- 
serve it. My acquaintance with 
the Latter-day Saints in Zion, as 
well as abroad gives me to under- 
stand that presiding brethren 
throughout the Church and our 
leading brethren and sisters in the 
associations and organizations are 
taking a stand strongly in favor of 
temperance, not only in regard to 
strong drinks but in regard to the 
use of tea, coffee, and tobacco. This 
will be a very remarkable people 
when visitors can come to us from 
the world and discover that through- 
out Zion, the home of the Latter- 
day Saint*, there are none who 
indulge in the use of strong drinks, 
nor in the use of tea, coffee and 
tobacco. However, I want to 
draw your attention to the fact 



that there are people in the world 
who are not only abstaining from 
the use of strong drinks, but they 
are just as abstemious in regard 
to the use of tobacco, tea and coffee 
as are the Latter-day Saints. 
They have come to understand that 
those things are injurious, and they 
are refraining from their use. I 
have met quite a number of people 
who are just as careful .in regard 
to these matters as Latter-day 
Saints can be. It was not on ac- 
count of the Word of Wisdom that 
these people in the world have been 
avoiding thetee things, for they 
knew nothing of that revelation 
that has been given to the Latter- 
day Saints. It appears that this 
spirit is not only moving upon the 
Latter-day Saints but it is among 
the peoples of the world as well. 

I believe that the time has now 
come when not only the leading 
brethren in the Church, the presid- 
ing brethren in the stakes of Zion. 
in the wards, and in the quorums 
should be very careful and faithful 
in the observance of this law, but 
I believe the time has come when 
all Latter-day Saints should be 
held to a little stricter account. I 
believe that every man who bears 
the Priesthood, every man who has 
entered into covenant with the Lord 
as we have done at the waters of 
baptism, to keep the commandments 
of the Lord, to observe them faith- 
fully so far as we know them, and 
as fast as they shall be revealed un- 
to us, I say I believe the time has 
come when they should observe the 
Word of Wisdom, as well as to pay 
their tithing, as well as to attend to 
their prayers and the worship of the 
Lord. I believe it is a time now for 
reformation — extended and increas- 
ed reformation — over the condi- 
tions that have prevailed among us 



16 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



in the past. I appeal to my breth- 
ren who bear the Priesthood, the 
Lesser as well as the Melchisedek 
Priesthood, that we engage in this 
work, first laboring with ourselves 
regulating and setting in order our 
own lives, and when we have ac- 
complished this, that we shall la- 
bor to set in order the lives of our 
friends. I believe that we will find 
many people, who are our neigh- 
bors in the land of Zion, who will go 
hand in hand with us thus far in our 
religion. May be they will not re- 
ceive it all, some of them will not 
but many of them' will, and this is 
an opportunity to show to the peo- 
ple of the world as well as those 
with whom we associate, that we are 
in earnest, that we are sincere, and 
that we are not hypocritical. 

I believe the time is here, my dear 
brethren and sisters, that we ought 
to make whatever reformation is re- 
ally necessary in order that the 
power of this Gospel may be felt in 
the earth. The coming of the Lord 
is near, even the coming of the Lord 
Jesus to reign on the earth, and you 
and I and our chiFdren, should we 
live until that day, would be happy, 
and it would be very desirable, I am 
sure, that we should find ourselves 
in the possession of faith and in the 
accomplishment of good works for 
the building up of the kingdom. If 
it is our good fortune to live, cer- 
tainly we want to be worthy to meet 
the Lord. If we don't live to meet 
Him here, we will meet Him all the 
sooner on the other side, and hence 
our preparation will not be in vain. 
We want to be prepared for His 
coming, we should be ready, and we 
will then be in splendid condition if 
we depart before He comes, but 
His coming is near at hand. We 
see it in the signs of the times., 
among the nations of the earth. The 
Lord is befriending His people. He 



is caring for His Saints — a little 
handful of people, a small percent- 
age of all His children, of course, 
but a chosen people. He has se- 
lected us; He has poured out His 
Spirit upon us; and we have been 
prepared, exercising our agency, to 
receive the Gospel of the Lord Jesus. 
We have a belief in God. We know 
that God lives, for He has revealed 
Himself unto us. He revealed 
Himself to the Prophet Joseph, as 
an introduction to this work, so that 
Joseph knew the Father, and the 
Son was introduced by the Father. 
The Holy Ghost has been given to 
all Latter-day Saints, that Spirit 
which has established the people, 
made them strong, made them sta- 
ble, and given them success. It has 
inspired them with a desire to gath- 
er to Zion, and has strengthened 
them in their efforts to do the will 
of God on the earth; yet, we are a 
small minority. Although we are 
but a little handful of neople, we 
have gained a splendid footing in a 
splendid country, under a splendid 
government; and, thank the Lord, 
it is His business to care for His 
Saints, and He will do so. There 
is no question. You and I can't 
take care of this work. Men have 
not been able to do it. The Prophet 
Joseph could not take care of the 
work in his day, when he stood 
alone, when he was but a boy, al- 
most, for at the organization of this 
Church he was only twenty-five 
years old. What can we expect to- 
day of a young man twenty-five 
years old? But the Lord was with 
the Prophet Joseph, and the Lord 
raised up men about him, — men of 
intelligence, men of judgment, a 
strong class of men who stood by 
the Prophet, although some of them 
fell away. Some of them were not 
faithful ; they could not endure, for 
the seed sown in their hearts fell

upon stony ground; there was lack 
of strength and vitality in the 
ground where the seed was sown. 
Many of those who were with the 
Prophet fell away, so that, so far as 
men are concerned, he stood almost 
•alone ; but a few such men as Brig- 
ham Young, Heber C. Kimball, and 
others of that class were brought to 
the work and stood by the Prophet 
so that the work was established. 
It started with just a few poor peo- 
ple — poor people, so far as this 
world's goods are concerned — but 
the Church has grown from the very 
beginning. It has advanced, it has 
been sustained; the Lord has taken 
care of it, and there has never been 
an enemy that could overcome the 
work of the Lord. This work has 
been maintained and it will endure 
to the end. It will not be broken to 
pieces. It will not be given to other 
people. The earth will never be 
left again without the Church of 
Christ established unon it. This 
Church will remain, for the Father 
is at the helm'. I would bear my 
testimony to you, my brethren and 
sisters, that God lives and is the 
author of this work. He it is Who 
sustains it; and He it is, through 
His Son, that has guided and con- 
trolled and cared for it all the time. 
They have selected the men, and, 
they have known the men that have 
endured and carried forward the 
work to the present time — not only 
the chiefs, not only those that have 
been called to responsible positions 
but He has chosen you, this body 
of people here today, and all Israel, 
the hosts of Israel that are gath- 
ered in these valleys of the moun- 
tains. The Lord has had you in re- 
serve. He has brought you here and 
has planted your feet here to re- 
main. You cannot go anywhere 
else, for this is the land of Zion. 
The Lord has saved this land ; He 



has prepared the way and laid the 
foundation. Some of us have strug- 
gles, but the work will arise and 
triumph and prosper, in the future, 
more gloriously than ever before. 

How lovely it is, when we dis- 
cover, as we travel and labor 
among the Latter-day Saints, the 
improvement that is being made on 
every hand, careful attention being 
given to every individual — not a 
soul,not a child in Zion that does not 
receive particular attention, and this 
is necessary in order that our chil- 
dren may be properly trained and 
reared in the ways of truth and 
righteousness, and when they get 
old they will not depart from it. 

At this time special efforts are be- 
ing made to establish temperance in 
the country, and we have received 
encouragement from the outside and 
everywhere in order that we may be 
a more temperate people. Why 
should not the people of the Unit- 
ed States set that kind of example 
for the rest of the world. This is 
the land of Zion, the land upon 
which men must serve God or they 
are in danger. It is a choice land 
the land of the Lord, kept hidden 
for many centuries, for this coun- 
try was not known. For very 
many centuries the learned men of 
the world did not know that there 
was any such country as these North 
and South Americas. They thought 
they had everything in the east, and 
they did not know there was any 
west. It is only a few centuries, 
four or five, since the discovery was 
made that there were two sides to 
the world ; that there were people on 
this side of the world; and all the 
evidences of a remarkable and refin- 
ed civilization is found today upon 
these lands. The people are just be- 
ginning to open up and discover the 
stories that these lands have to tell.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



This is the land of Zion, and why 
should not the people of this coun- 
try lead in these matters. We as 
Latter-day Saints are under the law 
of the Lord. We are prohibited 
from the use of strong drink and 
tobacco. We are prohibited from 
profanity and all kinds of wicked- 
ness. We have been living under 
prohibition in this line, under the 
law of the Gospel, for the law is: 
thou shalt not steal; thou shalt not 
lie ; thou shalt not commit adultery ; 
thou shalt not rob or trespass, but 
serve the Lord and do what is right. 
We are taught to love our neighbors 
as ourselves ; we must do as we 
would be done by. These are some 
of the laws we have been living, and 
according to these laws we have 
been trying to order our lives. Pro- 
hibition is not a new departure with 
us. I know so far as I am concern- 
ed, I have been under the law of 
prohibition for very many years. I 
obeyed it as a law of the Gospel 
and it is a good thing. I discover 
that it is a good thing to be sober 
a good thing to be temperate. It is 
a good thing to do what is right 
among men — not only among Lat- 
ter-day Saints, but in the world. 
Why, a man is absolutely safe in 
this world if he will only do what is 
right. This is what the law of the 
Gospel requires : that men should 
do what is right — work righteous- 
ness, for on no other principle can 
we obtain salvation. 

Brethren and sisters, let us go out 
from this conference to every part 
of the Church with the determina- 
tion in our hearts that we will work 
righteousness, that the spirit of this 
conference may be felt throughout 
the Church. We expect to go to 
every part of the Church; we ex- 
pect to go into every ward. We 
would like you to look out for us, 



because we are coming to see you. 
We shall visit you in your wards i 
ana when you hear of the brethren 
coming, we want you to meet them 
at your homes — that is, at your 
home places of gathering. We can- 
not go into all the homes of the 
people very well; there are too 
many people, and we are too few. 
The time was when the Prophet 
Joseph could go into the home of 
every Latter-dav Saint, visit all the 
people, shake them by the hand, 
and erive them a blessing; but today 
1 resident Toseph F. Smith can visit 
but a very few of the people in their 
homes. He can see them in gener- 
al conference, but onh' a very small 
percentage of the people can come 
here to conference. Suppose there 
will be twenty thousand people 
gathered here tomorrow, on the 
Sabbath day — that is a small mi- 
nority of the half million of Latter- 
day Saints. In order that we may 
see all the people and labor among 
them, get acquainted with them 
and know their spirit, that we may 
be able to bless them and take into 
their neighborhoods instruction 
counsel and encouragement we must ■ 
visit the people. In order to look 
after the affairs of organization 
and regulation as well as ordina- 
tions and the blessings necessary to 
establish the kingdom and keep it 
regulated, we must go to every 
stake, and there are fifty-six stakes 
— six or seven hundred wards — and 
we must do that every year, and 
two, three or four times a year we 
must visit every stake. We are in 
that ministry all the time. I want 
to say to every Latter-day Saint : If 
you be converted and are true Lat- 
ter-day Saints, we want you to con- 
vert your neighbors — and convert 
them by your living. No stronger 
testimony can be borne in regard 



PRESIDENT FRANCIS M. LYMAN. 



19 



to the principles of honesty, tem- 
perance, justice, mercy, truth and 
morality, than for a man to live 
those principles and doctrines. No 
testimony is stronger. People may 
question what we sav and what tes- 
timony we bear, but they cannot 
question our lives. If a man lives 
an honest life, meets his obligatior 
if he is a true man and lives a godly 
and upriedit life, dealing with his 
fellow men as he would that men 
should deal with him, if he is true 
and faithful in every line, no man 
can say nay to what that man does, 
for it is unquestionable, it is the 
facts as they exist and are eternal. 

There are a few things to which 
we would like to refer which were 
mentioned in the presence of the 
First Presidency, in our councils, as 
we report regularly to them ; we re- 
port our labors, just where we have 
been and what we have accomplish- 
ed, every week. These men here, 
the brethren of the Twelve, and 
these Seventies, as well as the breth- 
ren presiding over the stakes of 
Zion, are all men of God. They are 
strong, capable men. They are men 
of worth and integrity. In all these 
fifty-six stakes, and in all these six 
or seven hundred wards, and in the 
quorums of the Priesthood these 
leading men are men of God. They 
have been chosen of the Lord; every 
one of them' has been designated by 
the finger of the Lord in revelation 
for their positions of responsibility, 
and the authority they bear is just as 
sacred as that given by the Savior 
Himself to the Prophet Joseph, or 
the authority conferred upon the 
Prophet Joseph by Peter, James and 
John, who were the chief apostles 
in the days of the Savior, for it was 
their mission and ministry. They 
have not come to the earth for 
eighteen hundred years to give that 



authority and power to any other 
men, but after that great length of 
time, after those centuries of time, 
these men, bearing the keys of the 
kingdom, came under the direction 
of the Son of God and conferred 
that authority, and priesthood and 
power, upon the Prophet Joseph 
and Oliver Cowdery. Before them 
came John the Baptist, who was 
the forerunner of the Savior ; he, too 
was the forerunner of the Prophet 
Joseph, and he came and adminis- 
tered to Joseph and Oliver. He in- 
structed them and authorized them 
to officiate with the power of the 
Lesser Priesthood, by which they , 
had authority to baptize each other. 
Then came Peter, James and John 
with the Melchisedek Priesthood, 
holding the keys and authority to 
organize and build up the kingdom' 
of God on the earth. They brought 
that authority to the earth and con- 
ferred it upon these young men, 
with the promise that it should nev- 
er be taken from the earth again, 
and it has remained. Since that 
time the Latter-day Saints have mul- 
tiplied, but not phenomenally, not 
very remarkably, for there have been 
other peoples that have multiplied 
much more rapidly, having doc- 
trines, ideas, and fashions that were 
more popular with the world, and 
they accepted the easier plan. It is 
a difficult thing for fallen men to 
serve the Lord in this life. It is 
rather difficult for the reason that 
fallen men incline to do wrong. 
Their appetites and passions rule 
them; they are fraught with evil 
propensities and desires, and the 
tempter is always before them. 
Therefore it is difficult for them to 
overcome and open their hearts to 
receive the truth. That is the rea- 
son we are not more numerous than 
we are, but we are a remarkable 



20 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



people. No other people in the 
world gather together; no other 
people in the world build temples as 
do the Latter-day Saints — temples 
erected to the name of God,in which 
blessings and ordinances are ad- 
ministered for time and eternity. 
There are no other people who mar- 
ry for time and eternity, and who 
are laboring for the salvation of the 
dead — not another temple on this 
earth today, except these four tem- 
ples of the Latter-day Saints, in 
which ordinances are being per- 
formed for the salvation of the liv- 
ing and the dead. These are some 
of the many evidences that this is 
the Church of Jesus Christ, for 
whenever the Lord has a people up- 
on the earth who bear His author- 
ity, you will find these same doc- 
trines and principles advocated and 
established among them— not only 
for the benefit of those that are 
here and those that are to come, 
but for the good of all those who 
have lived in the past, for it is one 
great family. From the time of 
Adam until the winding up scene 
of the children of men on this earth 
there is just one family of our Fath- 
er, and the Lord is just as much in- 
terested in the men who came first 
as those who came at the last, or 
those who came in the meridian of 
time. Men were just as valuable 
in the beginning as they were in the 
days of the Savior; and they are 
just as valuable now as they were in 
the beginning or at the time of the 
Savior ; it will be so to the end, and 
the children of God are innumer- 
able. And this is a great work, of 
populating: the earth, bringing the 
family of God here to dwell and 
giving them opportunities. Of 
course there are plenty of other 
opportunities, there have been and 
will be throughout all the ages of 



eternity. This is not the only work 
of the Lord — this is only one sec- 
tion, one department of the Lord's 
work, but it is very important, very 
remarkable, and those of His fam- 
ily who come here will be very nu- 
merous, but there will be plenty 
more for other worlds like this here- 
after without number. There will 
be no dearth of worlds, no dearth 
of spirits, no dearth of space, no 
dearth of light, intelligence and op- 
portunities for the development of 
human kind who have always been 
and who always will be. 

My brethren and sisters, let us be 
true to this cause. We Latter-day 
Saints are few, only a handful of 
people in a world of many millions, 
but we have been gathered together 
and entrusted with this great and 
remarkable work. Let us be faith- 
ful and do our duty well, so that in 
a few years when we depart and go 
to the other side, it may be said of 
us that we have been true and faith- 
ful, that we have fought a good 
fight. 

Now in regard to keeping the 
commandments of the Lord, being 
temperate and living up to His 
laws in all things — I want to make 
this impression upon this body of 
people, UDon these elders and sisters 
here today: The leading brethren 
do not want to be lonesome in keep- 
ing the commandments of God. We 
want you to be temperate as we are 
temperate. It is not any more im- 
portant that we should keep the 
commandments of God than that 
you should keep them. You must 
be upright, temperate, honest arid 
conscientious. It is not enough for 
me and my family to do the will of 
the Lord. You, my brethren and 
sisters, and your children, your 
neighbors and kindred, and all who 
are Latter-day Saints should keep 



ELDER JOHN H. SMITH. 21 



the commandments of the Lord, and 
then it will not be lonesome for us. 
We want your help. We want your 
support. We want you to minister 
and labor with us. When the Pres- 
ident was speaking of the Lesser 
Priesthood, I was reminded that 
not long ago there came into my 
home two Teachers and a Deacon. 
I think it was the first time I had 
had a Deacon come to visit me. I 
would like you to remember that 
the lesser Priesthood has a minis- 
try. Any man who bears this 
Priesthood, any part of it, either the 
lesser Priesthood or the Melchisedek 
Priesthood, has a ministry, and the 
Lord requires that that ministry 
should be magnified and honored. 
The way should be opened so that 
these boys may be given a chance, 
that they may be employed and have 
their ministry as Teachers, for it is 
their duty to labor and assist the 
Teachers in all things. The Priests 
also should perform their duties in 
the homes of the people, that the 
people may be stirred up, not only 
in regard to temperance, but in re- 
gard to the principle of prayer, that 
men and women shall be taught to 
pray, that they may know how to 
pray, and have courage to pray, 
that in their prayers they may stand 
committed before the Lord to keep 
His commandments. Be sure that 
you live in such a way that when 
you pray, you can say: Father, I 
have done Thy will this day. Start 
out your prayer like that. Live so 
that you will be able to tell the Lord 
that you have done exactly right 
that you have not done anything 
that is wrong. Tell the Lord that 
and tell the truth, and I say to you 
that you can't ask the Lord a thing 
you ought to have, that is reason- 
able at all, that He will not give. 
Keep His commandments, then 



open your hearts to the Lord and 
ask Him for what you need, and 
He will grant it unto you. 

God bless you, my brethren and 
sisters. May His Spirit fill all our 
hearts, and may we go from this 
conference strengthened, and estab- 
lished, and fortified so that we shall 
never fail but that we may be suc- 
cessful in the service of God 
through Jesus Christ. Amen. 

A soprano solo, "Oh Shining 
Light," was rendered bv Sister Clor- 
inda Poulton. 

ELDER JOHN HENRY SMITH. 

Influence of sweet song inspires to good 
resolutions. — Necessity for strict com- 
pliance with correct principles. — Tem- 
perance generally observed by the 
Saints. — Satisfying comprehensiveness 
of the true Gospel. — Joy in the doc- 
trine that all infants arte saved. — 
Proud and grateful to be associated 
with God's great work. 

I desire that I may possess the 
good spirit that has been enjoyed 
by the brethren who have spoken 
unto us thus far, during the confer- 
ence. In order that I may do so 
I would like to read two or three 
verses from that wonderful hymn 
written by Brother Phelps : 

"There is no end to virtue ; 

There is no end to might ; 
There is no end to wisdom ; 

There is no end to light ; 

"There is no end to union ; 

There is no end to youth ; 
There is no end to priesthood; 

There is no end to truth ; 

"There is no end to glory; 

There is no end to love; 
There is no end to being :— 

Grim death reigns not above." 

I congratulate you, my brethren 
and sisters, on your ability to be 



22 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



in attendance upon this conference, 
that you have found the time and 
the means, and have had inclination 
to be present to commemorate this 
wonderful day. To me it is among 
the memorable days of my life, 
from the fact that it commemorates 
the birthday of my oldest living 
son, and also one of my wedding 
days. 

I am happy in the privilege of 
attending this conference and re- 
ceiving the impress of the spirit, 
in the songs rendered by the choir, 
as well as the solo given by our 
sister, to which we have just list- 
ened. The touch of inspiration 
that reaches us from this source 
gladdens and sweetens these gath- 
erings, and causes us to reflect, 
probably more seriously and more 
thoroughly upon our condition. 
We are inclined to weigh with 
thoughtfulness the possibilities of 
our conduct in the future, as we 
look backward upon our lives, un- 
der the influence of the spirit of 
song. I presume resolutions have 
been made by every man and wom- 
an present, many times in their 
past lives, as they have felt the 
influence of the spirit of song, or 
have listened to the words of in- 
spiration that have fallen from the 
lips of their brethren, that in the 
future they would! make a very 
earnest and serious endeavor to ap- 
ply in life the principles and doc- 
trines of the Gospel of the Redeem- 
er. I presume that probably all of 
those under the sound of my voice, 
whether members of the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints 
or of any other of the church or- 
ganizations of the world, have made 
these resolutions quite frequently in 
their experiences and many of them, 
possibly, have hedged quite close to 
the fulfillment of the covenants, 



that they have made in secret con- 
versations with themselves and their 
Heavenly Father. No doubt the 
same will be our experience as we 
depart from this gathering here 
today, as we weigh the past, as we 
look into the present, and as we 
consider and reflect upon the pos- 
sibilities that are in the future. 
When we look upon the list of calls 
that have been made from among 
our ranks in the past few months,and 
consider the possibility of such call- 
ing coming to us, as soldiers of the 
cross of the Redeemer, we may well 
consider with deliberation and 
thoughtfulness the character of the 
seed we have sown, as shown in 
the lives of the children our Father 
in Heaven has entrusted to our 
watch-care, and who should - have 
been impressed, by the character 
of our lives, with regard to the prin- 
ciples of everlasting life. I believe 
that all the fathers and mothers con- 
gregated here today would like to 
have every child of theirs follow 
carefully, thoughtfully, and pru- 
dently the doctrines which they ac- 
cepted when they embraced the Gos- 
pel of the Redeemer. We would 
be most happy if the moral prin- 
ciples that it has been our purpose 
to implant in the minds of our fel- 
low-men, as heralds of righteous- 
ness, shall have made an impress 
upon their minds, as well as upon 
our own, so completely and thor- 
oughly that there would not arise 
a necessity for words of warning 
and counsel, such as we continue 
to give concerning the problems in- 
volved in this latter-day Gospel. 
With all our success, and with all 
the efforts we have made to implant 
these truths in the souls of our 
children, and notwithstanding the 
efforts we have put forth to estab- 
lish these principles in the minds of 



ELDER JOHN H. SMITH. 



23 



our fellows, we note conditions ex- 
isting that are not quite in harmony 
with our wishes in regard to these 
matters. Nor is there a proper con- 
sideration of these problems to be 
found sufficiently in the minds of 
those who have possibly received 
the impress of this great mission 
of the. latter-days, and who still cling 
to the truth,but who fail to apply its 
doctrines as completely as they 
might in their lives, and in the work 
that continues to present itself be- 
fore them. 

Our attention has often been call- 
ed to this principle of temperance, 
upon which President Smith and 
the brethren spoke this morning, 
and to which President Lyman has 
referred this afternoon. How deep- 
ly it should have made its lodg- 
ment in our souls. How thorough- 
ly its impress should have been 
stamped upon the lives of our chil- 
dren. How completely we should 
have observed this law, that in the 
fulfillment of our duty in this re- 
spect our example might have im- 
pressed our fellow-men wherever, 
in the providences of our Heavenly 
Father, it has been our duty to la- 
bor and minister. It has made its 
impress, probably, in wider circles 
than we sometimes imagine, but 
how much more extensive would 
its influence have been among the 
children of men, as the result of 
our companionship, if we had re- 
ceived of it in the spirit thereof. 
If there had been a more thought- 
ful application of this principle in 
the conduct of our daily lives, its 
power for good would probably 
have spread much further than it 
has done. But, it is not my purpose 
to continue my talk upon this sub- 
ject, except to say that I believe, in 
proportion to our numbers, we have 
observed this law of temperance 



more fully than the people of the 
world. I believe that the Latter- 
day Saints, taken as a whole, wheth- 
er located within the state of Utah 
or beyond the borders in the various 
states of our Union, in the Repub- 
lic of Mexico or the Dominion of 
Canada, or among the governments 
of the world, a larger proportion 
of them have applied the principles 
of temperance, along the lines mark- 
ed out by our Heavenly Father, than 
you will find in a like number of 
people anywhere in the world. It 
is true there are many thousands, 
of good men and women in every 
land and clime whose hearts have 
been so fully given to respect and 
reverance for the Divine Master 
and His teachings, that they have 
largely applied these moral prin- 
ciples in their lives. Thjere are 
many people who have accepted 
these doctrines, but when we come 
to consider their impress upon a 
whole community, I believe that 
these principles have sunk deeper 
into our hearts than they have into 
the hearts of any other people. 
I trust that in the future, guard- 
ing our own rights and the rights 
and liberties of our fellows, we 
shall seek fully and thoroughly to 
obey the Spirit of our Heavenly 
Father in regard to this matter of 
temperance, and that through our 
companionship its impress shall be 
felt among all classes of people with 
whom it shall be our privilege to 
mingle. 

My brethren and sisters, I think 
the young people of the Latter-day 
Saints should rejoice, indeed, in the 
privileges that have been theirs. No 
matter where they are found, or 
how far they may have drifted 
from the path of rectitude and tem- 
perance, I do not think that any of 
them will ever be able to say that 



24 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



the doctrines of the Church, of 
which their parents were members, 
did not impress upon their minds 
the importance of righteous living. 
The aim of the Church has been 
to teach the best that could be found 
and to implant in the hearts of its 
members such ideals that, seeking 
to approximate the conditions pre- 
sented by those ideals, they might 
be in advance of conditions found 
among others with whom they have 
mingled. To me there is no scheme 
presented to mortals, in the world's 
history, which presents so bright a 
prospect as the system given to us 
and known as the Gospel of the 
Redeemer. There is nothing in the 
world which presents to mortals 
such possibilities and privileges as 
are given to the Latter-day Saints 
in that religion which the world 
calls "Mormonism" — so broad, so 
complete, so thorough in every de- 
tail, and presenting such incom- 
parable possibilities and probabili- 
ties. 

Just think of one proposition that 
comes home to the hearts of the 
mothers who are congregated here 
this day, under the sound of my 
voice. Compare their situation 
with that of the mothers who 
were believers in the doctrines of 
Calvin and good old John Knox, 
when the idea prevailed that in- 
fants, by countless thousands, 
were forever lost, unless, per 
chance, parents had the foresight 
and wisdom to have administered 
to them certain ordinances ; and if 
by any chance those ordinances 
were not administered their infants 
were eternally lost. Compare this 
doctrine with that presented by the 
boy Joseph Smith, in the introduc- 
tion of the Gospel in these the lat- 
ter-days, saying to all the mothers 
of the world — not to the mothers 



of the Latter-day Saints alone, but 
to the mothers of the Catholic 
Church, the Protestant Churches 
the Jewish Church, the Buddhist 
Church, and the mothers of every 
denomination in the world : "Your 
children are redeemed by the blood 
of Christ, not one of them' will be 
lost." What a beautiful proposi- 
tion, in its breadth, in its liberality ! 
It comes home with joy and glad- 
ness to the motherhood of this or- 
ganization of which we are mem- 
bers. What a comfort this is to 
them, when they take their infants 
to their breasts and care and min- 
ister for them. And if any of 
their babes drop to sleep in death, 
they realize that these little ones 
are welcomed by the Redeemer of 
the world, that they are not out- 
casts, they will not be found among 
the unjust, the impure, the vicious 
who have rejected God and His 
truth. 

We are taught that every human 
being, that reaches an understand- 
ing of right and wrong, shall be 
judged upon the basis of his ac- 
ceptance or rejection of the truth. 
To every man and woman it is 
made known clearly and fully that 
the justice of our Heavenly Father 
operates in the interest of all His 
children who have grown to ma- 
turity, that all who comprehend 
right and wrong are accountable 
for the lives they lead, and in the 
end they shall be called upon to an- 
swer for their actions, whether they 
be good or evil. Upon the opening 
of the books where the facts of 
their lives are recorded, they will 
be judged according to their 
works and their understanding of 
right and wrong. We cannot go 
through the world in recklessness, 
in viciousness, in impurity, injus- 
tice, doing wrong, trampling be-

neath our feet every principle of 
righteousness, and then think that 
by declaring with our last breath 
that we believe in the Redeemer of 
the world, that the door-way to 
heaven will be opened to us. Think 
of these things you "Mormon" boys 
and girls, when people talk of the 
breadth of the doctrines of the sec- 
tarian world, and condemn, and 
brand with infamy the doctrines 
and system introduced through 
the providences of our God, by the 
declaration of the Father Himself, 
in the introduction of His Son and 
in the bestowal of the keys of ever- 
lasting life. 

President Winder spoke to us 
this morning of the great work be- 
ing accomplished in the temples, in 
behalf of the millions that have 
died without a knowledge of the 
Redeemer of the world, without 
an understanding sense of the pur- 
pose of His Gospel, without a 
knowledge of these glorious build- 
ings dedicated to our God, wherein 
work is performed for tke salvation 
of the dead, and clustering under 
the Gospel of the Redeemer all 
those for whom these ordinances 
shall be administered. 

Why need any Mormon boy or 
girl in the world hang the head 
when men brand with infamy, and 
lack of liberality, or lack of worth, 
or power or goodness, a system 
that makes men pure and clean, by 
the gift of God, redeems them by 
His blood and crowns them with 
everlasting life? Why should we 
bow our heads, or be ashamed of 
a cause which aims at the establish- 
ment of righteousness, and teaches 
that, under the laws of God, we 
shall all be judged according to 
our individual works ? Shall we find 
fault with the justice and mercy 



of our God, when His great plan, 
as revealed to us, provides for the 
redemption of millions who have 
gone before without a knowledge 
of His Gospel, and to whom' the 
witness of the Spirit had not 
come? He says to those who 
are living: Do your duty in 
harmony with the principles of 
righteousness, then the key of 
knowledge shall be turned, and the 
thousands who have gone before 
shall hear and accept the Gospel 
in the spirit world ; the justice of 
our Father thus exhibiting itself 
for them as for us. 

My friends, especially you young- 
er people who are under the sound 
of my voice, I ask you to weigh 
these propositions, study these prin- 
ciples. Standing in your presence 
and feeling the impress of the Spir- 
it and the nature of this great work, 
I declare to you that in all the 
schemes and devices that have come 
to the understanding of men through 
their own skill, through their own 
wisdom, and light, and knowledge, 
there is nothing which can be com- 
pared to it. Everything else in the 
world sinks into insignificance when 
we think of this wonderful plan of 
life and salvation which has been 
restored to earth in our day. There 
is no truth in the world, whether in 
the sciences of men or from the reve- 
lations of God, but what is part and 
parcel of the Gospel which the Re- 
deemer has given to us. I bear you 
my witness to its truth, and implore 
your thoughtful consideration of it. 
I trust that these younger people 
will weigh its possibilities, that they 
will keep themselves pure and un- 
spotted from' the world, and fulfil 
the mission and destiny of genuine, 
earnest, devoted and thorough-go-

ing Latter-day Saints. May peace 
abound with you all, is my prayer, 
in the name of Jesus. Amen. 



ELDER HEBER J. GRANT. 

Evidences of increased faith. — Financial 
and moral advantages in obeying 
Word of Wisdom. — Zion's people 
tried, but all is well. 

It is always a pleasure to me to 
meet with the Latter-day Sanits. I 
have listened with interest to the 
remarks that have been made by 
those who have preceded me in this 
Conference; and while 1 stand be- 
fore you today, I desire that all I 
say may be for our mutual benefit. 
I trust that it may be calculated 
in its nature to inspire us with a 
determination to press forward, and 
discharge the duties and obligations 
resting upon us as Latter-day 
Saints. 

I feel to rejoice in the splendid 
condition of the Church at home 
and abroad. I rejoice that the gath- 
erings here this morning, and this 
afternoon, have been the largest 
that I ever remember to have seen 
in the first meetings of our Con- 
ference. It is an evidence to ine 
that the Latter-day Saints are in- 
terested in the Gospel, that they are 
anxious to hear what may be said 
to them by those who shall speak 
during the Conference. If there is 
any one thing more than another 
that is not calculated to inspire a 
speaker, it is the privilege of talk- 
ing to empty benches. I have had 
that privilege, in years gone by, 
when speaking in the first meeting 
of our Conference. The gallery 
was not often opened, and the body 
of the house more than held the 
congregation, years ago. There- 
fore, I am very happy indeed to 



see this large gathering. To me it 
is an evidence of improvement 
among the Latter-day Saints ; it in- 
dicates a growth of their faith, and 
of their interest in the teachings of 
the servants of the Lord. 

Three weeks ago, I had the priv- 
ilege of speaking from this stand to 
the; people who were assembled, 
and I devoted nearly the entire time 
to quotations from the Doctrine and 
Covenants, from the Word of Wis- 
dom, and from the leaves of the 
journal of an old criminal lawyer. 
My remarks were all upon the sub- 
ject of temperance. I read to the 
audience a statement that the drink- 
bill in Great Britain amounted to 
over $800,000,000 a year; and oth- 
er items, showing that the drink- 
bill in America was fully up to the 
average of the people of Great 
Britain. The Lord has said that 
the Word of Wisdom was given to 
the people for their temporal sal- 
vation, and when you and I stop to 
reflect upon the fact that tea, coffee, 
tobacco, and liquor, with the ex- 
ception of the small amount manu- 
factured in our state, all comes 
from a distance, and that every dol- 
lar expended in breaking the Word 
of Wisdom goes out of this country, 
never to come back, with nothing 
in exchange for it, and when \vc 
realize that the profits of all the 
sugar factories in Utah would not 
begin to compare in amount with 
the wasted money thus sent away, 
it does seem to me that our finan- 
cial sense ought to teach us to obey 
this law of God. I have no hesita- 
tion in saying that if the Latter- 
day Saints had obeyed the Word of 
Wisdom, as a people, from the day 
they entered these valleys until the 
present time, that this would be the 
wealthiest state west of the Missis- 
sippi River, from which neighbor- 
hood our fathers were driven. 



ELDER HEBER J. GRANT.

Money accumulates very rapidly 
when it is allowed to remain in any 
country, and goes from pocket to 
pocket, or is compounded from 
year to year. AJ1 the money that 
has been spent for the breaking of 
the Word of Wisdom, during the 
sixty years that we have been in this 
country , — almost every single, soli- 
tary dollar of it, might have been 
retained in this community, it might 
have been here accumulating and 
multiplying, and growing all the 
time. 

In the article which I read here 
(three weeks ago,this man announced 
that he had been a criminal law- 
yer for more than thirty years ; that 
he had defended sixty-two men who 
had been accused of murder, and 
that forty-nine out of the sixty-two 
murders were committed because 
of the use of strong drink. He an- 
nounced that he had defended a boy 
for killing his own brother ; that he 
had defended a son for killing his 
own father ; that he had defended a 
husband for killing his wife ; that he 
had defended a mother for killing 
her child. Then he askes this ques- 
tion: "Is there anyone who would, 
for one moment, presume that these 
murders were committed because of 
the natural inclination of the peo- 
ple ?" And he went on to show that 
in these cases he had brought wit- 
nesses forward to prove that these 
people had committed these crimes 
under the maddening influence of 
drink* 

Now, . the Lord has said to the 
Latter-day Saints that it is not good 
for us to partake of strong drink. 
Let us, as Latter-day Saints, show 
to the world, by our good deeds, 
that we believe in the teachings of 
our Heavenly Father ; let us, by ob- 
serving the Word of Wisdom, set 
an example before the world that 
shall command the admiration of 



our fellows. I want to say to the 
young people that, as a cold- 
blooded business proposition, as an 
investment, there is nothing that 
will give a young man more credit, 
or better standing in the world, than 
to obey this simple law of God 
Many of the greatest corporations, 
employing thousands of men, will 
not employ a man who smokes ; 
neither will they employ a man who 
drinks. They are beginning to find 
out that men who drink, who 
smoke, and break these command- 
ments that the Lord has given to 
the Latter-day Saints, lack the in- 
tellect, lack the physical strength, 
and the moral character which is so 
necessary to efficient service. They 
discover that those who break these 
laws of God are not so capable in 
the performance of any labor as are 
those who keep these laws. Now, 
let us fit and qualify ourselves mor- 
ally, intellectually, and physically, 
that we may be able to fulfill every 
duty and obligation in all the walks 
of life. Let us have this capital 
as a part of our reserve ; for it will 
prove to be one of the means by 
which we can make a success in 
the battle of life. 

I had the privilege, a day or two 
ago, of attending a little meeting 
that is held in the temple-annex, 
just before those who work in the 
temple enter that sacred building. 
On that occasion, I read the hymn 
on page 168, it having first been 
sung by the choir ; and, as Brother 
Smith was reading the hymn, "If 
You Could Hie to Kolob," I decid- 
ed to read it to the audience here 
today : 

"Zion stands with hills surrounded — 
Zion, kept by power divine; 

All her foes shall be confounded, 
Though the world i« .arms combine; 

Happy Zion, 
What a favored lot is thine!

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



"Every human tie may perish, 

Friend to friend unfaithful prove, 

Mothers cease their own to cherish, 
Heaven and earth at last remove; 

But no changes 
Can attend Jehovah's love. 

"In the furnace God may prove thee, 
Thence to bring thee forth more 
bright, 

But can never cease to love thee, 
Thou art precious in His sight; 

God is with thee; 
Thou shalt triumph in His might." 

This was the favorite hymn of the 
late President Lorenzo Snow, and 
there never was a time in his life 
when he doubted for one moment 
that her foes should be confound- 
ed ; he never doubted for one mom- 
ent that, although in the furnace 
God might prove us, He would 
thence bring us forth more bright. 

This hymn reminds me of an- 
other, that I did not intend to read 
but I will : 

"ZION PROSPERS, ALL IS WELL. 

O awake ! my slumb'ring minstrel, 
Let my harp forget its spell ; 

Say, O say, in sweetest accents, 
Zion prospers, all is well. 

"Strike a chord unknown to sadness, 
Strike, and let its numbers tell, 

In celestial tones of gladness, 
Zions prospers, all is well. 

"Zion's welfare is my portion, 

And I feel my bosom swell 
With a warm, divine emotion, 

When she prospers, all is well. 

"Zion, lo ! thy day is dawning 

Though the darksome shadows swell, 
Faith and hope prelude the morning; 

Thou art prospering, all is well. 

"Thy swift messengers are treading 
Thy high courts where princes dwell, 

And thy glorious light is spreading; 
Zion prospers, all is well." 

There is no question in my mind 
that Zion prospers, and that all is 
well. I rejoice when I read these 



inspired words which were written 
by the late Eliza R. Snow. I be- 
live, as was said here this morning, 
that the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints was never in a 
better condition than it is today, 
spiritually, and temporally, and 
every way. During the last year, 
I have had the privilege of travel- 
ing in many stakes of Zion, and I 
believe that the presidents of stakes, 
the high councilors, the bishops of 
wards, and the teachers are more 
energetic, more diligent in keeping 
the commandments of God, and in 
teaching their people to live the 
laws of God, than they ever have 
been before.; I believe that the 
auxiliary organizations of this 
Church are in a flourishing condi- 
tion, from the Relief Society down 
to the Primary Association. I be- 
lieve that the Latter-day Saints as 
a people are taking more interest 
in the Gospel of Jesus Christ, and 
are striving to carry out the com- 
mandments of the Lord more per- 
fectly than they have ever done be- 
fore. I rejoice in this fact; I re- 
joice that the people love the Gos- 
pel; that they desire the advance- 
ment of the work of God upon the 
earth, and that they are anxious to 
so order their lives that the example 
which they set shall be worthy of 
the imitation of all men. 

I want to bear witness here to- 
day that no man or woman ever 
lived, who kept the commandments 
of God and lived according, to the 
teachings of the Gospel of Jesus 
Christ, whose example was not 
worthy of the imitation of all men 
and all women, in any land, and in 
any clime. This Gospel of Jesus 
Christ, which you and I have em- 
braced, is in very deed the plan of 
life and salvation. It is in very deed 
the Gospel revealed again to the 
earth. It is the same Gospel that 



ELDER HEBER J. GRANT. 



29 



was proclaimed by our Lord and 
Master, Jesus Christ; and He gave 
His life in testimony of the same. 
And the lives of our Prophet and 
Patriarch were given as a witness 
to the divinity of the work in which 
we are engaged. For seventy-eight 
years this Gospel has been pro- 
claimed to the world without 
money, without price. Freely we 
have received, and freely we have 
given to the world. 

May God give us the light and 
inspiration of His spirit as our con- 
stant guide and companion. May 



we be Latter-day Saints in very 
deed, is my prayer and desire, and 
I ask it in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 

The choir sang the anthem, "Lift 
up the voice in singing." 

Conference was adjourned until 
Sunday, April 5th, at 10 a. m., to 
meet in the Tabernacle and in the 
Assembly Hall. 

Benediction was pronounced by 
Bishop Charles W. Nibley. 



SECOND DAY. 



In the Tabernacle, Sunday, April 
5th, 10 a. m. 

Conference was called to order 
by President Joseph F. Smith. 
. The choir sang the hymn begin- 
ning : 

Hark ! listen to the trumpeters ! 

They sound for volunteers, 
On Zion's bright and flowery mount 

Behold the officers. 

Prayer was offered by Elder An- 
drew Kimball. 

The choir sang the hymn : 

Ye simple souls who stray 

Far from the path of peace, 
That lonely, unfrequented way 

To life and happiness. 

ELDER RTJDGEE, CLAWSON. 

A gathering of the Priesthood describ- 
ed and analyzed. — The spirit of the 
Priesthood delineated. 

My Brothers and Sisters : If 
there is anything in the world that 
will cause one to feel timid, it is 
in facing a congregation of this 
character and magnitude, wherein 
the hosts of Israel are assembled 
to worship before the Lord. I 
trust that you will give me your 
faith and prayers that I may be 
sustained by the Lord in the re- 
marks which I shall make. 

We had a very remarkable gath- 
ering in this building last evening. 
It was a meeting of the Priesthood 
of the Church. There were present 
1389 souls, possibly as great a gath- 
ering of this character as we have 
ever held in the Church. I think 



it was. A stranger sitting in our 
midst last evening would doubtless 
have said : Yes, this is a gather- 
ing of your Priesthood. It seems 
to me that it is a very heterogeneous 
body of men. The answer to that 
remark would be : No, it is not 
a heterogeneous body, but a homo- 
geneous body. If the word had 
come from the presiding officer of 
the meeting, there would have been 
an immediate re-arrangement. The 
brethren would have divided and 
sub-divided into groups, until we 
should have had quite a variety of 
councils presiding authorities and 
quorums of the Holy Priesthood; 
varied as to number, but homoge- 
neous in purpose, in sentiment, and 
in faith. And if the stranger had 
sought to discover the identity of 
these various councils and quorums 
of the Priesthood, he would have 
found : first, three great presiding 
Pligh-Priests, the Presidency of the 
Church, whose jurisdiction in the 
Church is supreme, and from whose 
decision there is no appeal. The 
Lord has so ordained it. He would 
have discovered the quorum of the 
Twelve Apostles, whose authority 
and jurisdiction reach out into the 
fifty-six stakes of Zion, and into 
the world, a body of men who labor 
directly under the authority of the 
First Presidency. He would have 
discovered the council of the Seven 
Presidents of Seventies, whose jur- 
isdiction and authority extend to an 
army of Seventies throughout the 
Church, numbering about ten thou- 
sand. He would have discovered 
the Presiding Patriarch,with a body 



ELDER RUDGER CLAWSON. 



31 



of Patriarchs,' whose jurisdiction 
extends to spiritual blessings in the 
Church. He would have discovered 
the presidents of stakes, coming 
from localities in all directions and 
all parts of the Church, representing 
fifty-six great stakes of Zion, whose 
authority is very great and far- 
reaching in its character, and who 
preside in a general way, over the 
quorums of the High Priests and 
the Elders of the Church, and the 
Bishopric of the wards and, 1 the 
lesser Priesthood. He would have 
discovered the bishops of the wards 
coming from something like 652 
organized wards in the stakes of 
Zion. These men who are denom- 
inated as common judges in Israel, 
are appointed to act as fathers of 
the people and ministry not only in 
spiritual affairs, also in temporal 
matters, to give counsel, and direct, 
to look after the poor, and see 
that no iniquity abounds in the 
Church. He would have discovered 
numerous quorums or bodies of 
men 'such as High-Priests, Sev- 
enties, Elders, Priests, Teachers and 
Deacons. The stranger would also 
have discovered that if this vast 
body of men had been called into 
action, every man would know per- 
fectly the scope of his authority 
and the character of his duty. They 
would move in a solid phalanx, there 
would be no confusion, no disorder, 
no stubbornness of spirit. This is 
what the stranger would have dis- 
covered. Such, my brethren and 
sisters, sis the Priesthood of the 
Church of God. It is the result of 
seventy-eight years of training un- 
der the inspiration of the Spirit 
of the Lord, which is the spirit of 
order ; it is the spirit of obedience, 
the spirit of united action, the spir- 
it of harmony and oneness of pur- 
pose. 



The opening song that was given 
last night will be found on page 28 
of the Hymn Book. The words of 
the first verse are as follows : 

"God moves in a mysterious way, 

His wonders to perform, 
He plants his footsteps in the sea 

And rides upon the storm." 

The thought occurred to me, ex- 
pressed by Bishop Nibley in his re- 
marks last evening, that nowhere 
in the wide world beyond our bord- 
ers could such a body of men be 
brought together as were those as- 
assembled in this building last even- 
ing. During the meeting, the fol- 
lowing song was sung: 

"Praise to the man who communed with 
with Jehovah ; 
Jesus annointed that Prophet and Seer, 
Blessed to open the last despensation ; 
Kings shall extol him and nations re- 
vere. 

Hail to the Prophet, ascended to heaven ; 
Traitors and tyrants now fight him in 
in vain ; 

Mingling with Gods, he can plan for his 
brethren ; 

Death cannot conquer the hero again. 

Praise to his mem'ry, he died as a . 
martyr ; 

Honored and blest be his ever great 
name ; 

Long shall his blood, which was shed 
by assassins, 
Stain Illinois, while the earth lauds 
his fame. 

Great is his glory, and endless his 
Priesthood ; 
Ever and ever the keys he will hold ; 
Faithful and true, he will enter his 
kingdom, 

Crowned in the midst of the Prophets 
of old. 

Sacrifice brings forth the blessings of 
heaven ; 

Earth must atone for the blood of that 
man ; 

Wake up the world for the conflict of 
justice : 

Millions shall know "Brother Joseph" 
-again."

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



I want to say to you, brethren and 
sisters, that the spirit aroused by 
the singing of that hymn last even- 
ing in the priesthood meeting and 
in the meetings of the general as- 
semblies of the Church is a spirit 
which is unconquerable. I do not 
say this in an offensive way. It 
is the spirit that stands for peace, 
for good order, for virtue, for tem- 
perance, for justice and for truth. 
I tell you, brethren and sisters, it 
is the spirit that burned in the heart 
of the prophet, when he declared 
to the world that he had seen the 
Father and the Son. And he made 
this declaration in the face of the 
opposition of the world, and against 
the sentiment and the faith of the 
world. When he would not re- 
cant, or take back the announcement 
or say that he had been deceived, 
he was hunted like a wild beast. 
He was driven from pillar to post. 
He was dragged before the courts 
time and time again, and on every 
occasion was discharged for lack 
of evidence, such evidence as the 
enemy wanted to convict him, un 
til finally the great prophet of 
this dispensation, with his brother 
Hyrum Smith, were lured into the 
confines of the Carthage jail, and 
there suffered martyrdom. It is 
the spirit that fired the heart of 
Brigham Young when he led the 
Pioneers across the desert, and into 
these mountains, and established 
them here to become a great and 
mighty people in the Rocky Moun- 
tains, in fulfillment of the prediction 
of the martyred prophet. It is the 
spirit that burned in the heart of 
John Taylor, the champion of truth, 
a man of courage and of unyielding 
faith. It is the spirit that burned in 
the heart of Wilford Woodruff, the 
intrepid missionary of the Church, 



the man who carried the Gospel to 
the nations of the earth, with a 
spirit that could not be wearied, a 
spirit that could not be discouraged 
and which knew no failure ; a 
mighty man of Israel. It is the 
spirit that burned in Lorenzo Snow, 
who, like his predecessor, also car- 
ried the Gospel to the nations and 
kingdoms of the world, and in 
whose heart, when he came to the 
presidency of the Church, burned 
a great desire, a great longing, to 
see the Church freed from the bond- 
age of debt. He inaugurated that 
great work. It is the spirit, breth- 
ren and sisters, that burns in our 
present leader, the Prophet of God. 
and a man of mighty faith, a man 
of integrity a man who loves his 
people and who is beloved of his peo- 
ple almost as no man who has pre- 
ceded him' in that office. He has liv- 
ed to carry on that glorious .work of 
relieving the Church of its obliga- 
tions, and he lives today, to see the 
consummation, and, in fact, to bring 
about the final consummation of that 
glorious undertaking. I say, my 
brethren and sisters, the Lord God 
of heaven bless our leader, and 
bless the Priesthood of the Church- 
May He bless the Saints, the peo- 
ple of God,that we may go on from 
one victory to another, without 
fear, without trepidation, putting 
our trust in the arm of Jehovah. 
I pray that His bessings may con- 
tinue with us and that His Spirit 
may abide in our hearts, and rest 
down mightily upon us during the 
progress of this great conference 
of His people, which I ask, in the 
name of Jesus. Amen. 

Prof. Charles Kent's male chorus 
rendered a selection entitled "Near- 
er to Thee."

ELDER HYRUM M. SMITH. 

Saints desire to learn truth, and govern 
themselves by God's word. — The 
Church authorities faithful guides to 
the people. 

It is written, "Man shall not live 
by bread alone, but by every word 
that proceedeth out of the mouth 
of God," and it is further written 
that, "Every person that belongeth 
to the Church of Christ shall ob- 
serve and keep all of the command- 
ments and covenants of the 
Church." While I presume all of 
us have not arrived at that stage 
where we are living according to 
every word that has proceeded out 
of the mouth of God ; while we are 
not all observing to keep all of the 
commandments and covenants of 
the Church, nevertheless I believe 
there is a strong desire on the part 
of the Latter-day Saints to live as 
near as possible to the words which 
have been, spoken by the mouth of 
God unto the people. From the 
testimony of President Smith yes- 
terday morning, it is evident the 
Saints are improving every year. 
Each year we are growing a little 
better, living a little closer to the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ, keeping the 
commandments of the Lord a little 
more fully, and remaining true to 
the covenants we have made within 
the Church. This congregation is 
an evidence that the Latter-day 
Saints are not content to live by 
bread alone, but that they are ex- 
ceedingly desirous of hearing the 
word of God. Hence we have come 
up in vast numbers to this confer- 
ence, that we might hear the word 
of the Lord as it shall be given un- 
to us through the Lord's servants; 
and we will not have come in vain. 
We have never yet come up in vain, 
but each time that we have gather- 
ed in our general conferences we 



have received the word of God, and 
we have received it, too, in open 
hearts, after which we have gone 
home and carried into effect, in a 
measure, that word. 

It is the truth we love; it is the 
truth we seek ; and we believe there 
are no men who are better acquaint- 
ed with the truths of God than the 
constituted; authorities of His 
Church. Our belief is verified in 
the results that have followed the 
Saints when they have heard and 
put into practice these truths. "The 
spirit of truth is of God," declared 
the Lord to Joseph Smith the Pro- 
phet. "I am that spirit of truth, and 
John bore record of me, saying : He 
received a fullness of truth, yea 
even of all the truth. And no man 
receiveth a fullness unless he keep- 
eth His commandments. He that 
keepeth the commandments re- 
ceiveth truth and light until he is 
glorified in truth and knoweth all 
things." That is our desire, to 
keep the commandments of God, 
and to become acquainted with 
truth and light. The Lord has said, 
"He tjhat keepeth the command- 
ments receiveth truth and light un- 
til he is glorified and knoweth all 
things." We want knowledge and 
wisdom. We want to understand 
the truth, and understanding the 
truth rejoice in it. We want to 
know what the commandments of 
God are, and knowing them we are 
determined, as a people, to keep 
them, that we might come to a 
knowledge of all truth, even as the 
Lord Jesus Christ understandeth 
and knoweth all of the truth. He ar- 
rived at that condition through 
keeping the commandments of God, 
His Father. 

I rejoice in the general faithful- 
ness of the people of the Latter-day 
Saints. They are indeed, as it 
were, a city set upon a hill which

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



cannot be hid, whose light is shin- 
ing-, in all the world, and is light- 
ing the feet of those who are seek- 
ing the Word of Life. We have 
been gathered out, and others are 
being gathered out, from the world 
and are following in the footsteps 
of God's servants. I would advise 
the Latter-day Saints to continue in 
following the servants of the Lord, 
who preside in the Church and 
Kingdom of Christ. Never in the 
history of the people have the saints 
gone wrong or gone astray while 
following the lead of the Presidency 
and general authorities of the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints. Never in the world 
will the people go wrong or go 
astray and fall by the wayside, if 
they will continue to follow the lead 
of these men of God; and I want 
to suggest that we look to the 
Presidency of the Church, and the 
leading quorums of the Priesthood, 
as true indicators of the way the 
Lord would have us walk. They are 
indeed God's liahona, and if we 
will discover their spirit in all mat- 
ters pertaining to the building up 
of the Kingdom of God, the spread 
of everlasting truth, and then fol- 
low them, we will be right, will 
prosper, will do as the Lord wishes 
us to do. We will keep His com- 
mandments, and in return shall re- 
ceive light and truth until we be 
glorified, and know all things, and 
are prepared and worthy to dwell 
with God in Celestial Glory. 

May the Lord bless the Saints, 
that they may ever be willing thus 
to seek to understand and know 
the mind and will of God, as it may 
be indicated unto the people in all 
things, through the Presidency of 
the Church ; and, having discover- 
ed what the Lord wishes, be de- 
termined that with all our strength 
and power we shall go in that way. 



This will be a blessed day, a blessed 
future, for the Saints of the Most 
High. 

God bless the people in the name 
of Jesus. Amen. 



ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH. 

Appreciating the importance of the Sac- 
rament. — Reverence and care in its 
adminstration. — Scripture teachings 
concerning the Sacrament. — Sacred- 
ness of covenants. 

I desire that my words to you 
may be indicted by the Spirit of 
our Father in Heaven, for the brief 
time allotted to a speaker is so val- 
uable that individual opinions are of 
little worth, except they be inspir- 
ed of the Lord. 

, I have rejoiced in being permitted 
to attend this conference, and in 
meeting so many of our brethren 
and sisters. To me it has been a 
time of refreshing, and I have en- 
joyed, more than I can tell, the in- 
structions and spirit of the Confer- 
ence. 

It is my privilege to travel and 
visit from place to place in the 
Church, and among the evidences 
of faithfulness that I have observ- 
ed, in many places, is the increased 
attendance of the members of the 
Church in their sacrament meet- 
ings. I feel that a comprehension 
of the sacredness of the sacrament 
of the Lord's Supper is important 
to the members of the Church. We 
partake of pjhysical food — that is, 
we partake of bread and water etc., 
to nourish the physical body. It 
is just as necessary that we partake 
of the emblems of the body and 
blood of our risen Lord to increase 
our spiritual strength. It is ob- 
served that men and women who go 
from year to year without partaking

of the Lord's Supper, gradually 
lose the Spirit of our Heavenly 
Father ; they forfeit its companion- 
ship where they have had opportun- 
ity to participate in that blessing, 
but have failed to take advantage 
of it. The sacrament is of great 
importance. The Lord Himself or- 
dained that we partake of these 
emblems. • There are many people 
who believe it is necessary to be 
baptized, and to have other or- 
dinances of the Gospel perform- 
ed in their behalf, and yet they 
become indifferent and careless re- 
garding the sacrament of the Lord's 
Supper. It was regarded of such 
imporantce by our Father in 
Heaven that, through His beloved 
Son, and the apostles and prophets, 
as recorded in the scriptures, the 
Saints were admonished to partake 
of it regularly. Three of the evan- 
gelists refer to it, and we find that 
the scripture, in many places, 
teaches the importance of it, as it 
was taught by the Lord Himself 
when He dwelt in the flesh. Our 
Father in Heaven does not give us 
commandments or advice that are 
not of importance. He teaches us 
for our uplifting, for our growth 
and development, and if we will 
follow His counsel it will prepare 
us to go back into His presence. So 
I rejoice that the Saints are more 
faithful in observing this require- 
ment of our Father. Each Sabbath 
day we are expected to meet to- 
gether and partake of the emblems 
of the body and blood of our risen 
Redeemer. I have turned to a pas- 
sage of scripture in the 11th chap- 
ter of First Corinthians, begin- 
ning with the 23rd verse, which 
reads as follows : 

"For I have received of the Lord that 
which also I delivered unto you, That 
the Lord Jesus, the same night in which 
he was betrayed, took bread : 



"And when He had given thanks, He 
brake it, and said, Take, eat; this is my 
body, which is broken for you; this do 
in remembrance of me. 

"After the same manner also he took 
the cup, when he had supped, saying, 
This cup is the new testament in my 
blood : this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, 
in remembrance of me. 

"For as often as ye eat this bread, and 
drink this cup, ye do show the Lord's 
death till He come. 

"Wherefore, whosoever shall eat this 
bread, and drink this cup of the Lord, 
unworthily, shall be guilty of the body 
and blood of the Lord. 

"But let a man examine himself, and 
so let him eat of that bread, and drink 
of that cup. 

"For he that eateth and drinketh un- 
worthily, eateth and drinketh damnation 
to himself, not discerning the Lord's 
body. 

"For this cause many are weak and 
sickly among you, and many sleep." 

When I remember these words 
that have been given to us as the 
revelation of our Fathers' will, I re- 
joice when I find our brethren and 
sisters coming to the sanctuary and 
partaking of these emblems as in- 
dicated — worthily; but I desire 
to call your attention to the fact 
that there is danger if we do it un- 
worthily. Before partaking of this 
sacrament, our hearts should be 
pure; our hands should be clean; 
we should be divested of all enmity 
toward our associates; we should 
be at peace with our fellow men; 
and we should have in our hearts 
a desire to do the will of our 
Father and to keep all of His com- 
mandments. If we do this, partak- 
ing of the sacrament will be a bless- 
ing to us and Will renew our spirit- 
ual strength. 

In connection with this matter, 
I note that there is a great improve- 
ment among us as a people. I be- 
lieve our understanding of the im- 
portance of this requirement is in- 
creasing and becoming better all the 



36 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



time; that we are more particular 
to have the vessels bearing these 
emblems scrupulously clean, and 
that everything pertaining to the 
sacrament is as our Father in 
Heaven would have it — clean, 
sweet, and pure. 

The Lord has indicated the im- 
portance of the sacrament in anoth- 
er way. There are certain of the 
Priesthood who are not permitted 
to officiate in this ordinance. The 
Deacon or Teacher may not ad- 
minister the sacrament, and those 
who bear no Priesthood, cannot act 
in this capacity. The Lord has cer- 
tainly emphasized its importance by 
designating those who may officiate. 
Our people have been taught to 
take the sacrament with the right 
hand; we believe that is appropri- 
ate, and proper, and acceptable to 
our Father. The sacrament should 
not be accepted with a gloved hand ; 
nobody should receive it in that ir- 
reverent manner. We should par- 
take of it in humility, with prepara- 
tion of clean hands and pure hearts, 
and with a desire to be acceptable 
to our Father; then we will re- 
ceive it worthily, and rejoice in the 
blessing that comes to us by reason 
of it. 

. The Lord has spoken regarding 
this matter in the Scripture ; I re- 
fer to the Bible, Book of Mormon, 
and the Doctrine and Covenants. I 
find in the Book of Mormon, chap- 
ter 9, that Mormon, while teaching 
the people, admonishes them as fol- 
lows : 

"See that ye are not baptized un- 
worthily ; see that ye partake not 
of the sacrament of Christ un- 
worthily." 

He thought it was of sufficient 
importance to emphasize it, and 
thus he taught the people in re- 
gard thereto. 



We also find reference to this 
matter in the 18th chapter of Third 
Nephi, where the Savior is instruct- 
ing the people on this continent, 
just as He had taught His disciples 
in the old world, to observe the sac- 
rament. It reads as follows : 

"And when the multitude had eaten 
and were filled, He said unto the disci- 
ples, behold there shall one be ordained 
among you, and to him will I give power 
that he shall break bread, and bless it, 
and give it unto the people of my 
Church, unto all those who shall believe 
and be baptized in my name. 

"And this shall ye always observe to 
do, even as I have done, even as I have 
broken bread, and blessed it, and gave it 
unto you." 

We believe that the sacrament is 
not the literal body and blood of our 
Lord; in other words, we do not 
believe in the doctrine of Transub- 
stantiation. The next verse reads 
as follows 

"And this shall ye do in remembrance 
of my body, which I have shown unto 
you. And it shall be a testimony unto 
the Father, that ye do always remember 
me. And if ye do always remember me, 
ye shall have my Spirit to be with you." 

So the Master taught, and there 
are other things in this chapter, per- 
taining to the same matter, that I 
will not take time to read. In ad- 
dition to that, we find that in our 
own day the Lord has given us rev- 
elation upon that, subject. In sec- 
tion 20 of the Doctrine and Coven- 
ants, the Lord gives unto us in- 
structions upon the matter. In that 
revelation, beginning with the 75th 
verse, He says : 

"It is expedient that the church meet 
together often to partake of bread and 
wine in the remembrance of the Lord 
Jesus ; 

"And the elder or priest shall admin- 
ister it; and after this manner shall he

37 



administer it — he shall kneel, with the 
church" [It does not say that the church 
must kneel, but he shall kneel with the 
Church] "and call upon the Father in 
solemn prayer, saying — " 

Note the beautiful prayer that 
follows. It is the same as that con- 
tained in the Book of Mormon, with 
the exception of one single word: 

"O God, the eternal Father, we ask 
Thee, in the name of Thy Son, Jesus 
Christ, to bless and sanctify this bread 
to the souls of all those who partake of 
it, that they may eat in remembrance of 
the body of thy Son, and witness unto 
Thee, O God, the eternal Father, that 
they are willing to take upon them the 
name of Thy Son, and always remember 
Him and keep His commandments which 
He has given them, that they may al- 
ways have His Spirit to be with them. 
Amen." 

The prayer and blessing upon 
the water is somewhat similar. How 
sacred, how profoundly sacred, are 
the thoughts expressed in the sac- 
rament prayer. I admonish you, 
my brethren, that when we officiate 
in administering the sacrament, we 
repeat, if possible, the exact words 
given by revelation, and that we do 
so with the Spirit of the Lord. 
When we repeat these prayers, we 
should feel the sentiments express- 
ed by the words that we speak. 
Then I say also to those who par- 
take of the sacrament, we should 
consider seriously the covenants we 
make with our Father. Let us pay 
strict attention to those covenants, 
and let us see to it that we eat and 
drink worthily, for the blessings of 
our souls and for the increase of 
our spiritual strength. These bless- 
ings are for you, my brethren and 
sisters, who are of the household of 
faith. Let us appreciate them, and 
live worthy of them, that by our 
lives we may exemplify our be- 
lief. Let none of us be under con- 



demnation by partaking of the 
sacrament unworthily, thereby be- 
ing deprived of the companionship 
of the Spirit of our Father. 

May the Lord bless us; may His 
Spirit continue to be poured out 
upon us. May we love each other, 
as our Father commanded that we 
should do. If we can partake of the 
sacrament worthily, we can love 
each other, even as our Father has 
ordained ; remembering that He has 
said unto us: "If_ye are not one, ye 
are not mine." May we be 
one. May we be His in very 
deed — examplars of His cause 
and His truth, ever ready to teach 
and expound it in kindness and love, 
to the convincing of His children 
who know not of it. Let us teach 
them the truth by precept and ex- 
ample, so that, by reason of our 
faithfulness in so doing, our skirts 
may be rid of the blood of the 
generation in which we live; and 
when we go to our eternal home, 
may we be welcome there because 
of our labor in the interest of our 
Father's children. 

May the Lord add His blessings, 
and His peace be upon us, is my 
prayer in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen.

My brethren and sisters: For 
several days I have been contract- 
ing a cold which this morning has 
reached that stage which renders 
my voice hoarse and unnatural, and 



38 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



I have some fears that I will not 
be able to make this vast congrega- 
tion hear all that I say. I have, too, 
some anxiety with reference to 
what I shall say upon this occasion ; 
for I realize that the time is very 
valuable, where so very many Lat- 
ter-day Saints are assembled to- 
gether for the purpose of receiving 
instruction. 

During the meetings of this Con- 
ference, however, there has been a 
thought in my mind which I would 
like to develop in a measure before 
you, if I can enjoy the Spirit of the 
Lord. I wish to say, in beginning 
that I am heartily in accord with 
all the sentiments which have been 
expressed by my brethren at the 
meeetings of this Conference. They 
have spoken words of praise for 
the faithfulness of the Latter-day 
Saints, as well as words of inspira- 
tion to the people. 

I will read the 28th and 29th 
verses of the 14th chapter of Luke : 

"For which of you, intending to build 
a tower, sitteth not down first, and 
counteth the cost, whether he have suf- 
ficient to finish it? 

"Lest, haply, after he hath laid the 
foundation, and is not able to finish it, 
all that behold it begin to mock him." 

The use which the Savior makes 
of this figure is different from that 
which I design to use it for. The 
Savior here implies that it would 
be very unwise indeed for a per- 
son to undertake the building of a 
tower, or a structure of any kind, 
without first having planned and 
made an estimate of the cost, and 
determined in advance whether he 
would be able to meet the expense 
to build the structure. I say, the 
words of the Savior imply the fol- 
ly of one undertaking such a struc- 
ture without having first made the 
plans. No reference is made here 



to plans, but I conclude that in or- 
der to arrive at the actual cost, 
or even the approximate cost of the 
structure, especially if it be com- 
plicated, that the plans must first 
be made. 

Now, suppose that one of us is 
going to erect a beautiful and mod- 
ern home that would be expensive, 
that would be complex in its archi- 
tecture and construction. We 
would find it necessary to have an 
architect provide plans and speci- 
fications. When those plans were 
privided, what would you think if 
other and different plans were sub- 
mitted, and the individual should 
start the building, and employ some 
workmen on one side and some on 
another, distributing these plans, 
varied though they must necessarily 
be, — all these men engaged on the 
same structure with the thought 
that there would be eventually a 
most perfect modern building con- 
structed? Why, you would think, 
of course, that there was folly in it. 

I speak of this to impress upon 
the minds of the people the neces- 
sity of there being harmony of de- 
sign in any great movement, just 
as there must be but one design 
and plan for a building ; unless, per- 
chance, those which are added are 
duplicates. 

Then, another point in connection 
with that. When the plans are all 
made, the individual who has the 
plans in hand and understands them, 
comprehends the work from begin- 
ning to end. He may not sumbit 
the whole of the plans to any one 
of his workmen, but, if it were a 
large building, requiring much time 
and many laborers, he might give 
certain details to some of them, and 
on another part of the structure he 
would give other details of the 
general plan to other workmen ; but 



ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS. 



39 



all would be working together sys- 
tematically upon the one great plan. 
In this way, the architect sees all 
his work, even the end from the be- 
ginning. That is the point. 

Now, things earthly, we are told, 
are typical of things Heavenly, and 
that which comes nearest to perfec- 
tion here on earth reaches nearer to 
Heaven, or is more like the things 
which are Heavenly, Which are per- 
fect. So the great plan, the great- 
est of all plans, which involves the 
salvation of. the human race, and 
■covers a period of at least seventy 
centuries ; with many thousand mil- 
lions of people, living under differ- 
ent conditions, having different 
temperaments, different disposi- 
tions, and different faiths and de- 
sires. This great plan must, of 
necessity, have had an Archi- 
tect, and His plan must have been 
well designed. So we read in the 
Acts of the Apostles, the 15th chap- 
ter, 18th verse : 

"Known unto God are all His 
works from the beginning of the 
world." 

To me, this means that all along 
down the line all things were known 
by the Lord, the Great Architect, 
even the end from the beginning. 
By reason of this knowledge, the 
result of a definite and well-defined 
plan, He could pdint out the de- 
tails of this great work to be ac- 
complished many centuries in the 
future. Whis is the very thing 
He has done, for He revealed 
these things to His apostles 
and prophets, who have lived from 
the earliest days of this world's 
history down to the present time. 
He is, indeed, the Great Architect, 
the Sole Builder, — He Himself be- 
ing, as the Scriptures tell us, "The 
chief corner stone." He knows 
whereof He speaks, and it is small 



matter for Him to indicate to His 
workmen, His prophets who have 
lived upon this earth, any matter 
of detail pertaining to this great 
plan. 

Now, the other point: if one 
Would consider it folly for a man, 
having undertaken to erect a large 
building, to have different plans, 
perhaps made by different archi- 
tects, and none of them alike, sub- 
mitting one plan to one workman, 
and another plan to another work- 
man engaged in the building of this 
great structure, and expect to reach 
symmetry, beauty and perfection 
when it was completed — if man 
would consider such a course one of 
folly, how can he consistently be- 
lieve that God, the Eternal Father, 
the Author of the plan of salva- 
tion, would give to His children dif- 
ferent plans to follow, with the hope 
that, in the end, they would suc- 
cesfully complete the desired 
structure? If it would be folly to 
take such a course with respect to 
a building, how much more neces- 
sary it is to have a definite pur- 
pose respecting plans which affect 
the salvation of the human family. 
I wish to quote the saying of the 
Prophet Joseph, which is recorded 
in his "Gems," found on page 288 
of the Compendium. He says : "At 
the first organization in Heaven we 
were all present, and saw the 
Savior chosen and appointed and 
the plan of salvation made, and we 
sanctioned it." 

While the term! "Mormonism" is 
a misnomer, it is nevertheless a 
comprehensive term, because it em- 
braces both the Gospel of the Lord 
Jesus Christ, which is the power of 
God unto salvation, and also the 
Church which was instituted as the 
machinery for the carrying out of 
His great plans and purposes. 



40 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



"Mormonism" comprises the great 
plan of the Creator, and there was 
no other plan instituted in Heaven 
for the accomplishment of this great 
work — .If there were more than one 
plan we would find confusion in the 
work of the Lord, but there is not, 
consequently there is symmetry and 
beauty, and progress, as our 
brethern have testified during the 
meetings of this conference. The 
confusion in the world concerning 
the principles of salvation is due to 
the fact that men, of their own voli- 
tion, have made plans and doctrines 
according to their own ideas. 
Everywhere in the great structure 
they have attempted to erect they 
have introduced conflicting ideas, 
hence the confusion that we see 
throughout the world today. I 
want to say to this people, and I say 
it to the world, for these words will 
go forth to the world in print, that 
"Mormonism" is the biggest thing 
in this wide world. It is of more 
importance to the children of men 
today, this wide world over, than 
anything and everything else com- 
bined ; because in it is included the 
law by which the children of men 
shall be judged. 

The Scriptures tell us that un- 
til the law came, sin was in the 
world. But sin is not imputed where 
there is no law. To me this means 
that where there is no law there is 
no judgment. To us, and to all the 
world to whom "Mormonism" has 
been proclaimed, has come the law 
by which the people of the world are 
to be judged. I want to say to the 
world to whom "Mormonism" has 
come, or may come in the future, 
that it is unto them the savour of 
life unto life, or of death unto death, 
according as they receive it and live 
it, or as they reject it. 



The foundation of this work is 
revelation — Divine revelation from 
God. On one occasion, Jesus told 
Peter, "Upon this rock," (the rock 
of revelation) "will I build my 
Church; and the gates of hell shall 
not prevail against it." And so this 
Church has been built upon the rock 
of revelation; and it has met the 
storms ; the rains have descended 
upon it; the floods have come and 
blown against it from every side; 
the blasts have not impaired it; it 
stands because it is founded upon a 
rock. Neither can these things dis-, 
turb it, — all the falsehoods, the per- 
secutions, the calumnies, anything 
or everything that the adversaries 
of righteousness may inaugurate or 
wage against this work, only have 
dashed against it ; the winds have 
the effect of lifting it up and mov- 
ing it forward. "Mormonism" 
thrives in adversity; the more we 
are hounded, the more we are op- 
posed, the more life, energy and 
zeal is exhibited on the part of the 
Latter-day Saints. It has come to 
be a common expression that every 
time opponents kick "Mormonism" 
they kick it up hill ; which is a verit- 
able truth. "Mormonism" is grow- 
ing and prospering in the earth, be- 
cause it is the truth, and truth will 
not be downed ; or, if downed, it 
will rise again. Truth, like murder, 
will out, and the world must know 
it. I thank the Lord that so many 
of us are engaged as champions of 
the truth, and we have an assurance 
of the great destiny of this work. 

In the second chapter of Daniel, 
the prophet refers to the establish- 
ment of the Church and Kingdom 
of God upon the earth in the last 
davs ; for the time there indicated in 
the interpretation of Nebuchadnez- 
zar's dream does refer to the last 
days. It is written that the God of

Heaven would set up a kingdom 
which shall never be left to another 
people,a kingdom which shall not be 
destroyed; but it shall break in 
pieces and consume all other king- 
doms, and shall stand forever. We 
are told that it is likened unto a 
little stone cut out of the mountain 
without hands. This Church and 
Kingdom of God had a most hum- 
ble beginning, but it shall progress, 
increasing in size and strength, and 
it shall roll upon that great image, 
representing the powers of the 
earth, until it shall be crushed to 
pieces, and become as the dust of 
the summer's threshing-floor, which 
shall be blown to the four winds 
of heaven. And this kingdom shall 
roll on and on until it fills the whole 
earth. The Lord has identified most 
clearly this Church and Kingdom 
as being that seen by Daniel. We 
find it in the 109th Section of the 
Book of Covenants, 72nd para- 
graph, where almost the identical 
words of Daniel are used. The 
restoring of the Gospel by the visi- 
tation of an angel, as predicted by 
John, upon the Isle of PatmOs, has 
been fulfilled. The Lord establish- 
ed that fact most clearly in the 
133rd Section of the Book of Cov- 
enants, beginning with the 36th 
verse. Of these things, the Latter- 
day Saints are well assured. To 
doubt the ultimate triumph of 
"Mormonism" and its glorious 
destiny, as depicted in the Second 
Chapter of Daniel, we would have 
to doubt the word of God as it is 
given to us in these modern reve- 
lations; and it would be necessary 
for us to repudiate Joseph Smith as 
a Prophet of this dispensation. But 
we are assured of the fulfillment of 
God's word, and we do know that 
Joseph Smith is a Prophet of God. 
The Lord has revealed this to us 



most clearly; and testimony upon 
testimony have the Latter-day 
Saints received from the Lord as 
they have continued in faithfulness 
to serve Him. They know whereof 
they speak when they say that this is 
the Church of'Jesus Christ,establish- 
ed by the power of God, and destin- 
ed to fill the whole earth, until it 
shall be known as the Kingdom of 
God, for Jesus, our Lord, is to come 
and take charge of His Kingdom 
and reign as King of kings, and 
Lord of lords. Through our faith- 
fulness, we have great hope of ob- 
taining eternal inheritance in that 
Kingdom. 

May the Lord add His blessings 
to the Latter-day Saints, I humbly 
pray, in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

The choir sang the anthem, "In 
our Redeemer's name." 

Conference was adjourned until 
2 p. m'. 

Benediction was pronounced by 
Elder Lewis W. Shurtliff. 



Overflow Meeting. 

An overflow session of the Con- 
ference was held in the Assembly 
Hall at 10 a. m. Elder Heber J. 
Grant presided, and Prof. Charles 
J. Thomas conducted the singing. 

The congregation sang the hymn, 
"Redeemer of Israel, our only de- 
light." 

Praver was offered by Elder 
Stewart Eccles. 

The congregation sang the hymn, 
"Come, come ye Saints, no toil nor 
labor fear." 

ELDER GERMAN E. ELLSWORTH 

(President of Northern States Mission.) 

My brethren and sisters, it gives 
me pleasure to have the privilege of

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



standing before you for a few min- 
utes, to briefly report the labors of 
the Elders laboring in the Northern 
States mission. I take it that you 
are more interested in that subject 
than in any doctrine that I might 
preach. I feel highly honored in 
having the privilege of laboring 
with so many good men and women 
as are now in the Northern States 
mission, men and women who are 
active and faithful in their calling. 
They are struggling earnestly to 
magnify that calling before their 
heavenly Father. We are indeed 
grateful to God for His wonderful 
blessings, and we rejoice when we 
realize how He has opened the way, 
so that the honorable men of the 
earth may hear the gospel and read 
our literature. 

As most of you know, in the past 
three years, we have turned our at- 
tention more to the distributing of 
the Book of Mormon. We find 
that the dissemination of the Book 
of Mormon has more than doubled 
the distribution of other books and 
tracts. Three years ago we dis- 
posed of 1,000 Books of Mormon in 
our field, and something like 12,000 
small books. In 1906, the Books of 
Mormon increased to 5,000 and our 
other books to over 20,000. Last 
year the Elders increased the Book 
of Mormon distribution to some- 
thing like 12,500, and increased the 
ten-cent books to about 58,000. It 
has opened the door to the homes 
of- hundreds of people, and our El- 
ders feel that the Lord has been 
with them and has magnified them 
in their labors. They feel that in 
taking the Book of Mormon to the 
doors of the people that they have 
something important enough to take 
to the biggest men of the nation. 
The Lord, speaking to the Prophet 
Joseph and some of the Elders, in 



the eighty-fourth section of the Doc- 
trine and Covenants, seems to have 
chided them because they had neg- 
lected the things they had received, 
and speaks particularly of the Book 
of Mormon, — beginning with the 
fifty-fourth verse, He says : 

"And your minds in times past have 
been darkened because of unbelief, and 
because you have treated lightly the 
things you have received, which vanity 
and unbelief hath brought the whole 
Church under condemnation, and this 
condemnation resteth upon the children 
of Zion, even all; and they shall remain 
under this condemnation until they re- 
pent and remember the new covenant, 
even the Book of Mormon and the for- 
mer commandments which I have given 
them, not only to say, but to do accord- 
ing to that which I have written." 

The Book of Mormon has been 
given to the people of this dispensa- 
tion to bring them nearer to Christ. 
It is a witness that the Bible is the 
word of God, and that God has es- 
tablished His Church in this day 
and time. There is something re- 
markable about the Book of Mor- 
mon, it is a great missionary book. 
You can open it any place, and the 
Spirit of the Lord, which accom- 
panies the book, comes upon the 
people, and they are at once in- 
terested. 

The missionaries have enjoyed 
excellent health in the Northern 
States mission, having had little or 
no sickness. There is nothing that 
gives me greater happiness than the 
manifestations that the Lord has 
given to me, that He is establishing 
His work in the earth. I have a tes- 
timony that God lives, that Jesus is 
the Christ, and that Joseph Smith 
was His prophet, and that our Fath-. 
er has fulfilled, and is fulfilling, the 
promises to His servants in the mis- 
sionary field, wherein He said, that 
He would send His angels before

their face to prepare the way. We 
are learning every day of our lives 
that in order to keep pace with the 
angels that the Lord has sent out 
to prepare the way, we must work, 
and work hard. It is my experi- 
ence that when we are weary in 
body we feel these messengers are 
with us, guiding and sustaining us. 
In the past I believe many of us 
have neglected the opportunities, 
and have come long after the way 
has been prepared, and the hearts 
of the people have grown cold, but 
I am glad to say, we are now doing 
our' best, and cheerfully, too, to 
keep pace with the messengers that 
have been sent before our face. 

The last five weeks we have met 
all the Elders in the mission, but 
four, holding nine conferences with 
them, and laying plans for our sum- 
mer work. Instead of preaching to 
the Elders in these conferences we 
had a short report, and then, in 
about an hour's talk, laid before 
them a plan for our summer cam- 
paign, and asked them for sugges- 
tions. At the close we voted to 
make the plans laid before them 
the plans of the conference for our 
summer's work. 

Our plan for the summer is to 
send a letter to the leading men of 
the city chosen for our week-end 
conference. We also expect to send 
two men ahead of the company of 
six, to call upon the newspapers 
and announce our conference as 
well as place our posters in public 
places announcing the coming of 
a company of Elders to hold confer- 
ence in that town. In going through 
these cities, we expect to leave as 
many Books of Mormon, Voices of 
Warning, Durrants and Cowley's 
Talks as we can, and also copies 
of the Liahona. We expect to send 
them away not only with the spirit 
of the work but also with plenty of 



books and literature. We have pre- 
pared a tract containing 17 of the 
songs of Zion which preach a ser- 
mon, as it were, of the restoration 
of the Gospel, and all who will may 
go home with this collection, hav- 
ing heard some of them. Many 
learn to love and sing our songs, 
and music has a wonderful influ- 
ence. 

We have had testimonies in the 
past year concerning men who have 
heard their children singing the 
songs of Zion, and they have been 
led to wonder from what source 
they came, and were moved to in- 
vestigate the Gospel. The Lord has 
been eood to us, and we rejoice in 
the truth. We rejoice in the mani- 
festations of our Father. We pray 
that God will continue to bless and 
prosper Zion, and assist the Saints 
to send more of their sons and 
daughters into the mission field 
that they may learn that God is 
guiding His work, and that His an- 
gels are guiding the elders in their 
work. 

May the prayers of the Saints of 
Zion be fulfilled upon the heads of 
our Elders abroad, and upon our 
leaders at home. May God's spe- 
cial blessings be upon President 
Joseph F. Smith, upon his. counsel 
and upon the Twelve, that Zion's 
people may receive through them 
the blessings they are praying for, 
and go forth and build up Zion. 
May the light of Zion guide the 
honest in the whole earth, to join in 
preparing the earth for the coming 
of the Savior, is my prayer in the 
name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER NEPHI PRATT. 

(President of Northwestern States Mis- 
sion.) 

I have rejoiced greatly in the 
good spirit that has been upon the

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



servants of the Lord, and the Saints 
during this conference. I have 
been interested in the words of 
President Ellsworth, and I am glad 
to hear concerning the successsful 
methods adopted irt the mission over 
which he presides. The missionary 
fields are better systematized than 
they have been in years gone by. 

In the Northwestern States mis- 
sion we have had an average of 
thirty-one Elders during the year 
ending December 31, 1907, and we 
baptized a considerable number 
more good converts than have been 
baptized in any year since I have 
presided over that mission. We 
have received encouragement and 
blessings, by the accession of 
some strong men and women, full 
of faith, who have come into our 
mission from Zion. I refer partic- 
ularly to the Nampa branch, in Ida- 
ho. The tithes donated by the 
Saints in our mission are greater 
than ever before, to the extent of 
about $1,230. 

We have received many evidences 
of the divinity of the calling of the 
Elders. The eyes of the blind have 
been opened, and sight restored. 
One individual's lungs were sup- 
posed to be gone, it was thought she 
was dying, but she was restored by 
the power of faith. We have been 
blessed with numerous manifesta- 
tions of the power and gifts of God. 

We have visited more of the mid- 
dle classes (if we should speak of 
classes in free America) the last 
year than at any time previously. I 
would like to repeat to you some 
sentiments which were expressed 
to me by Mr. M — •, a passenger 
agent of a railroad and steamship 
system. He said to me : "There is 
one man in your community whose 
ideal life in his home is the most 
beautiful I ever witnessed. I would 



go any time a hundred miles to 
meet him. I have never seen nobler 
characters than are his wife and 
himself and their children. [Now, 
this is the testimony of a Presby- 
terian.] In my own religious com- 
munity, where I am acquainted, I 
have never seen such faithfulness, 
such devotion, such perfect truth 
and goodness as I witnessed in that 
man's family." This man that he 
praised is well known to all of you. 
I won't tell his name, but I exhort 
you to emulate his example, and 
let your light so shine that your 
righteousness and faithfulness may 
affect your neighbors. 

Goodness in the home is the 
foundation of Zion's prosperity. 
Cultivate cheerfulness at home. 
There is no man or woman who cul- 
tivates the spirit of affection for 
the members of their households 
but that is cheerful. Cheerfulness 
may be cultivated until the gloomy 
man starts his liver to working so 
that biliousness will cease and he 
will become the glory and the sun- 
shine of his own house. His chil- 
dren, instead of wanting to hide 
when father comes home, because 
they feel the oppression of a man 
who treats them tyranically, will 
look to his coming with joy, and 
the neighbors, seeing the hands of 
the children held out to a good 
father, will say, "how beautiful 
such home government is." The 
influence of a kind and affectionate 
father will diffuse itself through ev- 
ery member of his family, and will 
attract the honorable who see his 
home life. 

I was conversing with a man who 
is an ear and eye specialist, when 
I was availing myself of his ser- 
vices, and he told me that he was 
passing through the trouble of a di- 
vorce suit with his wife in court. 



ELDER ANDREW JENSON.

He said to me, "It is reputed of 
your people that they are the most 
constant, and most faithful to each 
other of any people in the world. I 
feel that if I ever desired to be 
united to a woman again, after my 
troubles are over, I would like to 
get a 'Mormon' girl." I answered, 
"You would have to become a 
mighty good man if you tried to im- 
itate a 'Mormon' as a husband, you 
would have to become like the Lat- 
ter-day Saint in principle, to satisfy 
a 'Mormon' girl ; in fact vou would 
have to receive the d/octrines of 
Jesus Christ as they are revealed in 
this age." 

Our Elders have been working on 
splendid lines last winter. We 
changed our plans, and established a 
system of missionary work in the 
great towns, so that we have reach- 
ed more people and accomplished 
more than at any other time, in the 
mission's experience. Our Elders 
are healthy, united, industrious, and 
happy, and they are abler than they 
have been. Elders of experience are 
being sent to the field, who are 
making themselves felt among the 
people in the states of the north- 
west. They visit men of influence 
in financial and governmental af- 
fairs, men who are officials of the 
state and municipalities. There are 
more men reading the Book of Mor- 
mon in our field than ever before. 
I allude to men outside of the 
Church. There is still, however, 
much indifference which we cannot 
break through. Many are hard- 
shelled, as it were. Sometimes the 
Elders are sneered at, and ordered 
out of the house, or out of the office 
of a business man ; but business men 
generally treat us better than the 
common people do. 

We have evidence that the power 
and blessing of our Father is in- 



creasing upon the Elders and upon 
the Saints. When the Saints are 
liberal in tithes and offerings, to 
help build up this kingdom, you 
may know they are in a healthy 
condition. God bless you here at 
home, my brethren and sisters. God 
bless President Smith. My soul 
echoes the blessings that have been 
pronounced upon our president by 
those who have spoken during this 
conference. The Saints shall pros- 
per, and God will magnify them. 
He is magnifying you in the earth 
and there is not a hand that could 
be raised, and there is not a weapon 
that could be formed that can stay 
this work, from this time henceforth 
and fprever. Whatever the condi- 
tions may seem, this work has come 
to stay. God has revealed it to us, 
and we know it is true. May God 
bless you, my brethren and sisters, 
I ask in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

The congregation sang the hymn, 
"O, say, what is truth?" 

ELDER ANDREW JENSON. 

I have been requested, under the 
direction of Apostle Grant, to occu- 
py a speaking position between two 
presidents of missions and two pres- 
idents of stakes. I noticed that par- 
ticularly in the appointment an- 
nounced yesterday, and that natur- 
ally introduces to my mind the two 
grand objects that we as Latter-day 
Saints have in view, or rather, that 
God had in view in commencing His 
great work upon the earth in, these 
last days, viz., to preach the Gospel 
in all the world, on the one hand, 
and, on the other hand, to build up 
stakes of Zion — to build up strong 
places, where the elect from the four 
quarters of the earth may gather 



46 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



together to learn more perfectly the 
ways of the Lord, and walk accord- 
ing to His statutes and command- 
ments. I have discovered by close 
study of the history of the Church, 
that whenever conditions at home 
have been favorable and good, and 
whenever the sons and daughters 
of Zion have walked in the paths of 
righteousness, the spirit of Zion 
has, naturally been felt for good 
abroad, among all the nations where 
missionary fields have been estab- 
lished ; and these fields have always 
flourished better when conditions 
have been favorable at home, that is, 
the missionaries who have gone 
abroad generally carried with them 
the spirit that prevailed at home. 
When the gathering places have 
been what they should be, and when 
the people at home have prospered 
in good works, the missionary fields 
have generally flourished in propor- 
tion. There never was a better time 
in the missionary field than short- 
ly after the Saints had located in 
these mountains, when the good re- 
ports went forth that Zion at last 
had found a resting place, and that 
the persecuted people of God of 
these the last days had finally been 
brought to a land where they were 
sheltered by high mountains, far 
away from the wicked world. The 
glorious reports that went forth 
from these valleys in these early 
days diffused life among the Saints 
in all the world ; and, as I say, at no 
time in the history of the Church 
have our missionary labors flourish- 
ed better than they did in the fifties. 

This introduces to us the great 
principle of gathering, the great 
principle of the Saints of God, flock- 
ing together to places which the 
Lord designates as gathering places 
for His people, where they may be 
properly trained and become what 



the Lord intends they should be. 
This principle goes back to the be- 
ginning of creation. You may nev- 
er have thought of it in that light, 
but I have. In the beginning, as 
Moses tells us, the Lord created this 
beautiful world in which we live, 
more beautiful, in the beginning, 
of its existence than it is now. The 
Lord could consistently look upon 
"everything that He had made, and 
behold it was very good." Never- 
theless, he planted a garden "east- 
ward in Eden, and there he put the 
man whom he had formed." This 
garden then was a choice spot upon 
this earth where everything was 
good. The garden of Eden was the 
first home of man, a choice spot, 
which the world in vain has tried 
very hard to locate, but which we, as 
Latter-day Saints, by the revela- 
tions of God, have succeeded in lo- 
cating. This was in the beginning. 
A little later, as men began to mul- 
tiply upon the earth, and some of 
the inhabitants of the same became 
wicked and others righteous, the 
Lord raised up a great Patriarch 
Enoch, who was commanded to 
build a city, and to that city the 
righteous gathered, and in that city 
the inhabitants conformed their 
lives to the glorious principles of 
righteousness until the city became 
holy enough to be taken up to God. 
We find that in other instances the 
people of God were warned to flee 
from wickedness, and from destruc- 
tion, as at the time of the deluge, 
when the people had become so 
wicked that it was necessary for the 
Lord to call upon those who would 
obey Him, in order that they might 
be preserved, to build an ark in 
which He kept them from destruc- 
tion, while the wicked perished in 
the flood. Of a little later period 
we read about some "cities on the 



ELDER ANDREW J EN SON. 



47 



plains" afterwards a part of the 
kingdom' of Israel, in which, the 
righteous were commanded to flee 
from the wicked cities of Sodom 
and Gomorrah, and seek refuge in 
the mountains, because the Lord 
had decided to destroy the wicked 
cities of the plain. 

Shortly after the deluge, too, we 
find that the Lord decided to con- 
found the language of the people, 
in order that they might be scat- 
tered all over the face of the earth 
In this connection we read in the 
Book of Mormon about a man called 
Jared, but more particularly about 
one whose name is not given in the 
record, called the Brother of Jared 
— a man of mighty faith, who pray- 
ed to the Lord that the language of 
himself and his family might not 
be confused ; and the Lord heard his 
prayer. And after the Lord grant- 
ed him this first request, he prayed 
again that God would lead them to 
a land where he and his kindred 
and friends could dwell by them- 
selves ; and the Lord also granted 
this request, and led them to a land 
of promise, to a land which was 
"choice above all the lands of the 
earth." (Ether 1 : 42.) That was 
the introduction of the Jaredites to 
America, and their history tells us 
that as long as they kept the com- 
mandments of God in this land, 
they were prospered exceedingly. 

Perhaps the next instance, in a 
chronological order, was the calling 
of Abraham in Ur, in Chaldea, 
where the people had gone astray 
and were worshiping strange gods. 
God called Abraham and command- 
ed him to get- out of his country, 
and from his kindred and from his 
father's house, unto a land which 
the Lord would show him. And 
after he had traveled, in obedience to 
the comandments of God, and found 



himself in what is now the land of 
Palestine, the Lord said : "Unto thy 
seed will I give this land." (Gen. 
12: 7). We have the history of 
the Israelites before us, and without 
going into details, I will state that 
it took some hundreds of years be- 
fore the descendants of Abraham' 
were numerous enough to possess 
the land of promise, and then they 
spent some time in preparing them- 
selves for taking possession of the 
land. We all remember that they 
spend forty years in the wilderness, 
receiving laws and making prepara- 
tions to enter the land that the Lord 
had promised to Abraham — a prom- 
ise that was afterwards repeated to 
other Patriarchs, as they came along 
in their line. History tells us that, 
later on, the Children of Israel, in 
that promised land of Canaan, bow- 
ed their knees before Baal and other 
idols, and became very wicked, on 
account of which they were severe- 
ly chastized and brought into slav- 
ery under heathen nations and 
eventually dispersed among the na- 
tions, to be gathered in the due time 
of the Lord. Next I will draw your 
attention to another gathering dis- 
pensation, or rather, a gathering 
out, when a good man — a prophet 
at Jerusalem — by the name of Lehi, 
some six hundred years before the 
birth of our Savior, was command- 
ed of God to leave his native 
country — leave his own people and 
take his family and depart into the 
wilderness. (I Nephi 2:2). - And 
as he came into the wilderness, in 
obedience to the commandment of 
God, the Lord spoke to him as fol- 
lows : "Inasmuch as ye shall keep 
my commandments, ve shall pros- 
per, and shall be led to a land of 
promise, yea even a land which I 
have prepared for you ; yea a land 
which is choice above all other 



48 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



lands." (I Nephi 2: 20.) Thus it 
soon became apparent that Lehi and 
his family should not lose anything 
by leaving the land of Jerusalem', 
for the Lord would lead him to a 
land more choice than any other 
land upon the face of the earth ; that 
land proved to be the same land to 
which the Jaredites had gone a long 
time before. Hence the land of 
America is once more introduced to 
us as the land of Zion. 

We have indeed the whole history 
of the world before us, in connection 
with this command of God, to gath- 
er out or to gather in, as the case 
may be. The people of God have 
again and again been called to gath- 
er out or to gather together in cer- 
tain localities, which the Lord des- 
ignated unto them. 

This Church was only nine 
months old when the Lord revealed 
to the Latter-day Saints that this 
also should be a gathering dispensa- 
tion, that the time for the gathering 
of Israel had come, that the dis- 
persed of Judah should be gathered 
that the lost tribes of Israel should 
be sought for, and that gathering 
places should be provided for them. 
A few years later Moses appeared 
to the Prophet Joseph Smith in the 
first temple built in this dispensa- 
tion, that at Kirtland, Ohio, and 
committed to the Elders of this 
Church the keys for the gathering 
of Israel from' the four quarters of 
the globe. But even before these 
keys were given, the gathering 
commenced to Jackson County, Mis- 
souri. I haven't time to go into de- 
tails, but in 1831, step by step, and 
all in very quick succession, the 
Lord made known to His Saints in 
these last days, that He would give 
to them, as He had formerly given 
to the Children of Israel, a land of 
inheritance in which they should 



dwell, and in which they should 
build up cities to His name, and in 
which they should keep His com- 
mandments and laws like their pro- 
genitors had done awav back in the 
days of Canaan. Our history leads 
us through Jackson county, Mo. 
Some of our history is connected 
with Kirtland, Ohio, and that, too, 
of a very interesting character ; then 
we have our experiences in Clay, 
Caldwell and Daviess counties, in 
Missouri. There we have a history 
of a gathering and a history of a 
scattering; the history of mobbings 
and persecutions, partly in conse- 
quence of the people of God failing 
to keep the commandments of the 
Lord with that fidelity which was 
required. They were driven from 
one place to another, but in these 
various places efforts were made by 
the Latter-day Saints to build cities, 
and in two of them, in the state of 
Missouri, they also commenced to 
build temples. Next we found our- 
selves in Nauvoo, 111., where we suc- 
ceeded better than we had ever done 
in any other place we had hitherto 
occupied in the east, inasmuch as 
we built- up a greater city and a 
larger temple than we had ever 
built before in our history. 

Then came the great exodus from 
Nauvoo to these mountains, and it 
became our privilege to settle in the 
only land in which the Latter-day 
Saints have ever been permitted to 
dwell in peace. I want to tell you 
right here that during the last few 
months of my life, I have had the 
greatest pleasure possible while pre- 
paring Church annals, to post my- 
self thoroughly in regard to the 
events that took place in these 
mountains in the early days of Utah, 
or even before this inter-mountain 
region was known as Utah, when 
there was no government here ex-

cept that which was inaugurated 
by the Latter-day Saints. This 
country was Mexican territory at 
that time, it is true; but no Mexi- 
can jurisdiction was extended here,, 
and no Mexican laws carried out, 
because it was so far from the cen- 
ter of Mexican government, and 
consequently all the laws that pre- 
vailed in these valleys for about 
three years and a half were such as 
were enacted by this same people 
that came from Nauvoo, accused 
by their enemies, who had driven 
them out, of all the crimes that were 
known to the criminal code. But 
these people came here and wor- 
shiped God, and established a com- 
munity of which we are justly 
proud today, and in which there 
existed many excellent conditions. 
The liberty and justice measured 
out by the Pioneers of Utah in these 
early days make you and I and ev- 
ery Latter-day Saint feel thankful. 
These valleys of the mountains be- 
came our gathering place, and in 
this place we had a chance to show 
what the real fruits of "Mormon- 
ism" were; we laid here a founda- 
tion for a commonwealth of which 
we are justly proud to this day. 

Now, my brethren and sisters, I 
will simply emphasize this fact, that 
we, as Latter-day Saints, are under 
obligations similar to those that 
rested upon the children of Israel 
in the days of Canaan, in the days 
of Joshua, in the days of the 
Judges, in the days of the kings of 
Judah. The Israelites were under 
obligations to worst"'" the only true 
and living God. They were for- 
bidden to fall upon their knees and 
worship the idols of the nations 
that surrounded them. And their 
history tells us that as long as they 
remembered the God of Israel, and 
as lone as they kept the laws that 



He had thundered out unto them 
from Mount Sinai, they prospered 
in the land, and none had power to 
overthrow or subdue them. But it 
was when they did wrong and for- 
sook the commandments of God. 
that the Philistines, the Middian- 
ites and the other surrounding na- 
tions came upon them and led them 
into bondage ; and it was after they 
had crucified the Son of God, and 
had slain the prophets that had 
been sent unto them, that the armies 
of their enemies came upon them 
and scattered them' among all the 
nations of the earth, until they be- 
came a hiss and a by-word among 
all nations. 

The Lord has commanded us in 
tl.ese last days to do something sim- 
ilar to what was done by ancient 
Israel in those days of which I 
speak. He has given us a land in 
which we may dwell and keep His 
laws and commandments, and our 
history is already sufficiently long 
to tell us this one grand and true 
story, that when we have done the 
will of God ; when we have listen- 
ed to the counsel of the Almighty, 
when we have been obedient to 
those men that the Lord has placed 
over us, and have listened to the 
whisperings of the Holy Spirit, we 
have done well and we have pros- 
pered in the land which the Lord 
our God has given unto us. And 
it has generally been at times when 
we have not hearkened so well that 
trouble has come upon us. 

And now, my brethren and sis- 
ters, I feel in my heart that the 
Lord has intrusted us with the pos- 
session of the soil of this western 
land, that these mountain valleys 
are the valleys of modern Ephraim, 
that Israel is to gather here, and 
that the tribe of Ephraim pre- 
dominates here. We can go through 



50 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



the land of Palestine today and 
there find the valleys of Ephraim, 
once blessed, and now cursed; but 
these valleys of Ephraim in the 
west are blessed of the Lord. Let 
us make this a land of Zion in- 
deed; let us keep the laws of God 
and honor His commandments in 
this western land. Let us listen to 
the voice of inspiration, and let us 
make this a land of temperance, of 
virtue, and honor; there should be 
no drunkenness in this land, so far 
as we as a people are concerned ; 
there should be no whoredoms in 
the land, and no adulterer allowed 
to go unpunished. Let us worship 
no strange idols ; these may not, as 
in days of old, be made of wood 
or stone, but they may consist of 
foolish fashions, extravagance of 
dress and kindred evils. Let the 
people of Zion also keep the Word 
of Wisdom. I don't know that pro- 
hibition on general principles has 
been preached stronger in any part 
of the world than the Word of 
Wisdom has been preached among 
us at hqme. We are loathe to think 
that it is necessary to take upon 
ourselves any formal pledge, or to 
join any particular society or or- 
ganization, for the purpose of keep- 
ing sober, or for a man to keep 
away from' strong drink, or from 
drinking to excess. It is only nec- 
essary for us to exercise strong per- 
sonal will power in keeping the 
commandments of God; and we 
should be the most willing to re- 
ceive these, and to observe them, 
and we certainly should welcome 
temperance among the people of our 
state, even if enforced by law. 

I hope, my brethren and sisters, 
that we will do what is right, so 
that this land may continue to be a 
land of Zion unto us, and that we 
may continue to be blessed and 



prospered in these mountain valleys, 
that the word of God may go forth 
from here to all the nations of the 
earth, that righteousness and the 
spirit of the true Gospel of Jesus 
Christ may shed its rays of light 
upon the nations, and that the cause 
of Zion may be prospered in 
all lands and in all climes, until the 
kingdom' of God shall be established 
and have dominion over the whole 
earth. God hasten the day, is my 
prayer in the name of Tesus. Amen. 

ELDER FRANKLIN S. BRAMWELL 

(President of Union Stake.) 

I rejoice exceedingly, my breth- 
ren and sisters, to have the privilege 
of meeting you in general confer- 
ence, and in hearing the good re- 
ports that have been piven concern- 
ing the various organizations of 
the Church throughout the world. 
It certainly is gratifying, indeed, 
for us to hear from our leaders that 
Zion is growing, not only numeri- 
cally but in righteousness. 

It affords me great pleasure to 
represent the Union Stake of Zion, 
which is located in the eastern part 
of the state of Oregon. We have 
there a very excellent country and 
a choice neople. Some of our wards 
have nearly doubled in number dur- 
ing the last twelve months, and the 
spirit of peace and thrift prevails. 

But while I speak in glowing 
terms of the members of the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints, I think it would be very 
unkind of me not to make specific 
mention of those who are not of our 
faith. It has never been my pleas- 
ure to labor among a people more 
friendly or broader in their views, 
or who extended the hand of broth- 



ELDER FRANKLIN S. BRAMWELL.

erhood to the Latter-day Saints so 
generally as is done in our commu- 
nity. Our Elders have been preach- 
ing and doing a good deal of local 
missionary work, and we have re- 
ceived personal messages over the 
telephone requesting us to send the 
"Mormon" Elders again, that they 
iiked to hear them. I have never 
seen a better field for missionary 
work than the State of Oregon. I 
have never been in a place where 
the people attend our meetings more 
generally, or where they manifested 
greater interest, and investigated 
with greater soberness, than they 
do in that locality. We have a 
missionary organization whose busi- 
ness it is to collect funds to pur- 
chase tracts, and in this way we are 
disseminating the word of God as 
fast as oossible. 

A key-note expressed by Presi- 
dent Smith, in the opening of our 
conference, yesterday, was the more 
particular training of the lesser 
priesthood. I rejoice, and I am 
very pleased, indeed, that our boys 
are to receive closer and better at- 
tention. I have known boys who 
have grown up without experience 
in the priesthood, and when they 
have reached their majority, and 
have gone to the Bishop for a tem- 
ple recommend, with the under- 
standing that they were going to be 
married, their recommends have 
been brought to me for indorsement, 
and it has given me pain to observe 
some instances, that while the young 
man was clean and pure and sober, 
he was inexperienced in Church af- 
fairs, and I thought surely some- 
thing had been neglected. I believe 
that, if we organize more fully the 
lesser priesthood in the stakes of 
Zion, an important missionary work 
will be accomplished, and when our 
boys reach majority they will be 



fit to receive the higher priesthood, 
and they will make better husbands, 
better fathers, and in general, bet- 
ter in every particular than they 
have been hitherto. 

I notice, in the report of Sunday 
schools in the Union stake, there 
are something like 85 per cent of 
the members of the Church in our 
stake that observe the Word of 
Wisdom. We are going to take up- 
on ourselves a missionary labor to 
convert that other fifteen per cent. 
We are going to arrange in alpha- 
betical order the names of all mem- 
bers of the Church of school age,and 
we are going to see that special 
missionary labor shall be taken up 
with them in their homes. We are 
going to take the wild boy, who has 
thought that he counts for nothing 
who has thought, as he expesses it, 
"I ain't any good" ; we are going 
to labor with that boy, and take him 
by the hand and let him know that 
we cherish his soul, that he is a 
son of God, and our brother. We 
are going to try and take care of 
the eighty-five per cent, but we are 
also going to give specific attention 
to the fifteen per cent, until it shall 
be recorded in the Union Stake, 
and in all the Stakes of Zion we 
hope, that one hundred per cent ob- 
serve the Word of Wisdom, one 
hundred per cent are enrolled in the 
Sunday School, one hundred per 
cent are active in the auxiliary or- 
ganizations of the Church, one hun- 
dred per cent are taking part in this 
glorious work and assisting in con- 
summating the majestic purposes 
of our Father. 

I see necessity of missionary work 
at home, and I rejoice exceed- 
ingly to hear of the success of mis- 
sionary work abroad, under the sys- 
tematic methods that are employed. 
I rejoice to hear that hundreds of 



52 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



thousands of books and phamphlets 
relating to the Gospel are being dis- 
tributed in the world, but I know 
there is need for work of a similar 
character to be performed at home, 
near our own door yards. How 
many of us who have received the 
light are giving it to our neighbors? 
How many of us are inviting our 
neighbors to participate in the bless- 
ings that the Gospel affords, and has 
made possible for us to obtain? I 
fancy, sometimes, that we look too 
far off for our duties. I am afraid, 
my brethren and sisters, that some 
of our neighbors may stand before 
us at the judgement day, and say, 
"My friend, you claimed to have 
the light, claimed to have received 
the priesthood, the higher authority ; 
yet never once in your life did you 
invite me into your home; never 
did you proclaim to me the liberty 
which you claimed you had receiv- 
ed ; never did you invite me to read 
concerning this system of truth; 
never did you invite me to partake 
of that divine influence the Holy 
Ghost." I am afraid we sometimes 
forget what Christ has said, "Free- 
ly ye have received, freely give — " 
freely impart unto your brethren 
and sisters. This work applies to 
all the world . It is an individual 
work. We are called into the minis- 
try, every one of us, some to labor at 
home, and some to carrv the Gospel 
abroad. No man who has received 
the Priesthood has a right to lay 
down his armor, or a right to cease 
to bear witness unto the world con- 
cerning those things that God has 
revealed to him. If it is good for 
us to bask in the sunshine of "Mor- 
monism" it is good for our neigh- 
bors to enjoy the same blessing. If 
it has been the duty of some Elder 
to bring to us, it is equally our 
duty to carry it to our neighbor, to 



our brother ; and we will stand con- 
demned unless we do this. I hope, 
my brethren and sisters, that we 
will broaden out in our daily inter- 
course. I believe that among the 
crying evils of the day is falsely 
judging each other, a lack of 
charity, a lack of faith and confi- 
dence in each other and in the world. 
We should remember particularly 
the words of wisdom from the 
mouth of our Redeemer, "Condemn 
not, and ye shall not be condemned, 
judge not and ye shall not be judged ; 
the measure that ye meet out unto 
others shall be measured back unto 
you, pressed down and running ov- 
er." I am afraid many of us are 
something like a country judge I 
once heard of. The case had been 
before him for three or four days, 
and at the conclusion of the argu- 
ment of the attorneys,he looked over 
his glasses and remarked : "This case 
has been very stubbornly fought, 
the client on each side has been very 
well and ably represented ; the court 
is inclined to be just, it is a very 
intricate case, and I shall take the 
matter under advisement for three 
days, at the end of which time I 
shall render a decision in favor of the 
defendant." Like that Judge, we 
pass judgment, sometimes, I think, 
before we ought to. If we have 
meted out love to our neighbor, if 
we have meted out faith, hope and 
charity, and that is measured back 
to us, pressed down and running 
over, then we will indeed rejoice; 
but if we have meted out to our 
neighbor disorder and strife, if we 
have undermined him, dealt treach- 
erously and unrighteously with him, 
and that is meted back unto us, 
pressed down and running over,then 
it will indeed be« cause to sorrow 
and to mourn. As the greatest of 
philosophers has said, "we reap 



ELDER WILLIAM H. SMART. 



53 



that which we plant." If we plant 
faith, we will reap faith; if we plant 
hope, we will reap hope ; if we plant 
discord, we will reap discord. If 
we plant dissolution, we will harv- 
est dissolution. It is our duty to 
bless all the world. The Lord has 
said this is our duty. Men may re- 
vile, my backbite and malign us and 
persecute and imprison us, but it 
is our duty to bless all the world, we 
have no license to do otherwise, 
that I know anything about. 

I rejoice because of the growth of 
"Mormonism." It is established in 
the top of the mountains, and we 
have a promise from God that it 
shall not be removed. I rejoice that 
the Prophet of the Lord can truth- 
fully say that "Mormonism" is grow- 
ing. The march is onward. The 
faith of the Saints is growing and 
increasing, and the conditions that 
obtain today are better, perhaps, 
than at any time in the history of 
the Church. We want to apply it 
to ourselves individually, and ask 
ourselves the question, are we doing 
our part? If we are not, the Lord 
will not be pleased with us as indi- 
viduals, he will not bless our efforts, 
and we will be unhappy. We should 
be beneficent and benevolent, see 
that order and tranquility prevail in 
our homes, and extend it to all the 
world. God bless you, in the name 
of Jesus. Amen. 



ELDER WILLIAM H. SMART. 

(President of Uintah Stake.) 

We are having a glorious time 
during this conference, yet I feel my 
weakness in representing one of the 
Stakes of Zion. You remember on 
the map of our State there is a kind 
of rectangular bite taken out of the 



northeastern part. The Uintah 
Stake lies just beneath the lower 
part of the rectangular bite, that 
forms a sort of chair seat where 
that piece is taken out. The Stake 
is about two hundred miles from 
here, and extends over a consider- 
able area of ground. Before I for- 
get it, I desire to say to the good 
people present that we have lots of 
room for more good people out 
there ; and if you are not so very 
good, but just like some of the rest 
of us who are there, you may come, 
and we will all try to get better to- 
gether. If you have sons or daugh- 
ters who want to take root some- 
where, and branch out, and grow 
up with the country, just send them 
over to the Uintah country. It is in 
Utah, on the borders of Colorado 
and we think it is a goodly land. I 
am glad the Lord has given me the 
spirit of loving that country, inas- 
much as He has sent me there. 
Our stake comprises, in round num- 
bers, about 100 square miles of ag- 
ricultural land; and we are just 
like little flies on a big wall, we are 
so few as compared with that ex- 
panse of country. But, as President 
Lyman said upon one' occasion, so I 
believe,it is destined to be one of the 
rich and populous sections of the 
state of Utah. In speaking this way 
I do not feel to depreciate any other 
part of the vineyard of the Lord, 
because all of it is important. The 
land and the people must all be re- 
claimed and brought under culti- 
vation, temporally and spiritually. 
You can find there any altitude you 
want, from 4,500 to 7,000 feet a- 
bove sea level. You can get any 
kind of soil you may desire. At the 
base of the mountains, you will find 
black alluvial soil ; on the benches 
red sandy, or clay soil; or, in the 
valleys below heavier clay, white- 



54 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



ish soil, which is kind of wax like, 
and never needs to be fertilized; or 
you can get sandy loam, if you 
desire a soil to work more smooth- 
ly over the plow, share. The climate 
is rather dry, and inclined to be hot 
in summer, and rather cool in win- 
ter. The rainfall is light, but there 
is ample water supply, it being one 
of the best watered countries in the 
west. All it needs is perseverance, 
faith, bone and sinew, every-day in- 
telligence and stick-to-itiveness to 
get the water out, soread it over the 
land and make the country "blossom 
as the rose." Brother Samuel R. 
B^nnion, his counselors, and the 
brethren and sisters who have la- 
bored with them in the past for al- 
most a quarter of a century, have 
made our valley a place beautiful to 
look upon. As you ascend the hills 
in going into the valley, in the sum- 
mer time, it begins to look almost 
like a garden of Eden. The trees 
skirting various avenues, fields 
of grain waving under the warm 
sun make it look beautiful. Down 
in the valley you find the town of 
Vernal. The people who built in 
different parts of the valley have 
improved their farms until they pre- 
sent a very sightly appearance, and 
show what inight be done through- 
out all that vast country. 

As to ecclesiastical work the Pres- 
idency and High Council with the 
other boards of the Priesthood, and 
the various auxiliary departments, 
are doing what they can to further 
the work of the Lord. Last year 
we divided the High Council into 
committees, and enlisted them as 
special missionaries to the various 
priesthood and auxiliary depart- 
ments, giving them a year's labor. 
We receive reports from time to 
time concerning conditions they find, 
and suggestions as to what would be 



good for the betterment. At our 
last quarterly conference, we made 
a little innovation. We used Sat- 
urday's portion of the conference 
as a special convention day ; that 
is, we had a program, and appoint- 
ed members of the Priesthood and 
also leading sisters of various auxil- 
ary departments to speak upon sub- 
jects that would be of special inter- 
est to the priesthood and the various 
departments. Then we allowed the 
congregation to discuss the various 
points at the close of the disserta- 
tion on the subject. It proved an 
occasion of very great interest and 
edification. Sunday was devoted to 
general services, and instructions, 
were imparted to the people on gen- 
eral topics. The plan worked very 
admirably. We did not do this 
however, without getting the sanc- 
tion of the leading brethren. 

The people of our stake, as a rule 
are feeling well and trying to live 
their religion. Last fall, in holding 
our ward conference, catching up 
the forerunning of the spirit of 
teaching the Word of Wisdom, as 
we have heard here, we made that 
a special subject in all ward confer- 
ences throughout the stake. The 
spirit of the Lord was with us, and 
the people felt that the time had 
come to observe that law more than 
we have done in the past. It is only 
a few years since President Snow 
was impressed by the Lord to 
preach more abundantly, and im- 
pressively, that other law of tempor- 
al salvation, the law of tithing. 
You remember, he went south and 
first delivered the message there, 
and then continued northward 
through the country, and the people 
were everywhere aroused to observ- 
ing that law of temporal salvation. 
Not only is the Church free from fi- 
nancial bondage today, but the peo- 



ELDER HEBER J. GRANT. 



55 



pie also have received spiritual bless- 
ings abundantly. Now the other 
law of temporal salvation is being 
brought forward by the Church au- 
thorites, the law which governs 
health, longevity, strength and our 
perpetuity in the earth, the Word 
of Wisdom, It should be gratify- 
ing to the Latter-day Saints to know 
that, after so many years have pas- 
sed since the Lord gave that law of 
temporal salvation, especially con- 
demning the use of strong drinks, 
many of our brethren and sisters in 
our great country now join hands 
with us, and preach prohibition. It 
is gratifying to us, and we gladly 
join hands with them for the better- 
ment of conditions among us. We 
young people are often admonished 
with reference to the Word of Wis- 
dom. Our fathers and mothers 
have been treated with great 
leniency with respecft thereto, 
because they came into the Church 
with the old traditions and many of 
them were addicted from childhood 
to the use of tea,coffee, and tobacco, 
and in some instances, perhaps 
accustomed to the use of li- 
quor. In our Stakes of Zion, while 
we have endeavored to intensify this 
principle before the young, we have 
told the fathers and mothers that, 
wherein they could get sufficient 
strength to keep the Word of Wis- 
dom, it would not only be a 
blessing unto them, but they would 
furnish thereby a rich example of 
faith and works to their posterity. 
I have felt to thus encourage the 
fathers and mothers to keep the 
Word of Wisdom. 

May God bless us, my brethren 
and sisters in observing the laws of 
the Lord. My heart is full of grati- 
tude and joy at the testimony of the 
First Presidency we heard yesterday. 
I felt that no Latter-day Saint could 



sit under the sound of their voices 
and not have his or her faith increas- 
ed, to witness the strength, the love 
the living faith that emanated from 
those men of God. May God help 
us to do our part, be valiant in the 
testimony of Jesus, and live so that 
we may illustrate the sentiments ex- 
pressed in the words of this hymn 
that we sing — 

"Why should we think to earn a great 
reward, 

If we now shun the fight? 
Gird up your loins, fresh courage take, 

Our God will never us forsake ; 
And soon we'll have this truth to tell : 

All is well, all is well." 

Amen. 

ELDER HEBER J. GRANT. 

Age no excuse for non-observance of 
Word of Wisdom.— Utah should be 
exemplary temperance state. — Doc- 
trines in Book of Mormon are evi- 
dences of its divinity. — A key note to 
success. 

It is always a pleasure to me to 
meet with the Latter-day Saints, 
and I have listened with interest 
and attention to what has been said 
by the brethren that have preceded 
me today. I earnestly desire that, 
in occupying the remainder of the 
time at this session of our con- 
ference, that the light and inspira- 
tion of the Holy Spirit may be and 
abide with me, that what I say 
may be of benefit to those who are 
here assembled. I have never had 
any desire in my heart in standing 
before the Latter-day Saints other 
than that I might be able to say 
something that would be for their 
good, for their benefit, and that 
Would be calculated in its nature tc 
encourage them and to fix in thei? 
hearts a desire and a determination, 
to be more faithful, more diligent 



56 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



more energetic in the discharge of 
the duties that devolve upon them 
in the future of their lives than they 
have been in the past. 

I feel to be charitable to fathers 
and mothers who have been break- 
ers of the Word of Wisdom; but 
there is just one little item I want 
to call attention to, and that is, if 
our fathers and mothers were in the 
church, and were six years old 
when the Word of Wisdom was 
given, they would now be 81 years 
old, because it was given over 75 
years ago, and it seems to me that 
a child six years of age might have 
imbided the spirit of the Word of 
Wisdom. So our charity will have 
to be, to a certain extent, mixed 
with justice, and with a determina- 
tion to impress upon the minds of 
those who are aged that there is 
greater necessity for them to ob- 
serve the Word of Wisdom be- 
cause they are aged and therefore 
more in need of the blessings of 
the Lord. Now, I realize that the 
Word of Wisdom was not orginal- 
ly given by way of a command- 
ment and that many have taken 
advantage of that fact. I was on- 
ly a boy, however, when Presi- 
dent Brigham Y/oung announced 
that from that time forward it was 
a commandmient to the people ; and 
I rejoice that it seems to be com- 
ing now with greater force than it 
has been in the past. 

Many years ago when I first heard 
a political speech, by a member 
of Congress from the east, in the 
Salt Lake theatre, my heart was 
filled with joy and gratitude as he 
announced that Utah stood fourth 
in the entire nation on the ques- 
tion of education. He said there 
was a map in the capitol building 
at Washington, which as education 
grew in this country, was painted 
white; that it was all black origin- 



ally, and in proportion to the ad- 
vance of education in the various 
States and Territories it was chang- 
ed and made white. He told us 
then that there were but three spots 
upon that map whiter than Utah. 
At that time w;e were still a Terri- 
tory, and had received none of the 
public lands and government 
'moneys for educational purposes. 
Today, as I understand it, when it 
comes to literacy, there is only one 
State ahead of us. Some two or 
three months ago I noticed a map 
in the Improvement Era, indicating 
where the sale of whiskey ruled 
supreme, or was curtailed, it was 
painted black where liquor was not 
curtailed. I found that Utah was 
one of the six States painted black, 
and that there were forty states 
ahead of us. I feel that if there 
is any spot upon the face of the 
earth that should be first, and that 
should set an example before all the 
world in the matter of temperance 
it is Utah. If we had kept the Word 
of Wisdom, as we should have 
done, Utah today would have the 
credit of standing as a leader in 
temperance. 

I confess there is something in 
being at the head that has always 
favorably impressed me. When a 
young man I was struck by the say- 
ing of a friend that he would soon- 
er be the head of a mouse than the 
tail of a lion. Today he is one of 
the leading men in the community. 
There is a great deal in a man or 
a community in aspiring to be at 
the head; there is much in making 
up our minds as Latter-day Saints, 
that we and our families will serve 
the Lord and keep His command- 
ments, and set examples before all 
people worthy of their imitation, 
and that shall characterize and stamp 
us as in very deed servants and 
Saints of God. I rejoiced exceding-

ly, many years ago, over a quarter 
of a century, in fact, when I was 
called to be one of the Apostles, to 
receive a letter from a man who had 
known me many years, stating that 
he had always believed the Latter- 
day Saint leaders were dishonest, 
and that they were imposing upon 
the people ; but now that I had been 
chosen to be one of the leaders he 
had changed his mind, and he owed 
them an apology, he now believed 
they were honest men. He said, "I 
have known you from a boy, and I 
know that you are honest, and now 
I know these men must be honest 
or they wouldn't invite you into 
their private councils, where you 
would know all that was going on, 
because if they were dishonest they 
would know that you would expose 
their wrong-doing." I rejoiced in 
having this kind of an expression 
from this man. There is a great 
deal, my friends, in the statement 
of Josh Billings. He says, we must 
not judge a man by his relatives, be- 
cause he can't help them ; they are 
crowded on to him. But, judge a 
man by the company he keeps, be- 
cause he picks his own. Now let 
us pick our own company, and be 
sure that it is good, and let us set 
examples before all men that shall 
be worthy of imitation. Let us 
make up our minds that we will 
serve God. 

I rejoice in the wonderful spirit 
of the Book of Mormon. I believe 
that it is one of the greatest mis- 
sionaries in the hands of the Elder 
that it is possible for him to have. I 
believe that no man can open that 
book and read it with a prayerful 
heart, and ask God, in the name of 
Jesus Christ, for a testimony re- 
garding its divinity, but what the 
Lord will mainfest unto him by His 
Spirit the truth of the book. Now 
that is the promise made in the book 



itself, and God has performed it ; he 
has done it in thousands of cases. 
There is a mark of divinity on this 
book; and I maintain that no man 
can read, for instance, the 36th 
chapter, the commandments of Al- 
ma to his son Helaman, without re- 
ceiving an impression of this kind. 
It is claimed by some that this book 
was written as a novel. I maintain 
that a man ought to have his head 
tapped for the simples who would 
undertake to say that any one would 
be idiotic enough to write a book 
like the Book of Mormon as a 
novel, hoping to sell it to the people. 
I maintain that no man can read 
that chapter, wherein this great man 
says: "My son, give ear to my 
words, for I swear unto you, that 
inasrquch as ye shall keep the com- 
mandments of God, ye shall pros- 
per in the land." Also: "For ye 
ought to know as I do know, that 
inasmuch as ye shall keep the com- 
mandments of God ye shall prosper 
in the land ; and ye ought to know 
also, that inasmuch as ye will not 
keep the commandments of God, ye 
shall be cut off from His presence. 
Now this is according to his word." 
And again the words we find in the 
29th chapter of this same prophet, 
saying : 

"O that I were an angel, and 
could have the wish of mine heart, 
that I might go forth and speak 
with the trump of God, with a 
voice to shake the earth, and cry 
repentance unto every people; yea, 
I would declare unto every soul, as 
with the voice of thunder, repent- 
ance, and the plan of redemption, 
that they should repent and come 
unto our God, that there might not 
be more sorrow upon all the face 
of the earth. ****** 
I ought not to harrow up in 
my desires, the firm decree of a just 
God, for I know that he granteth

unto men according to their desire, 
whether it be unto death or unto 
life; yea, I know that he allotteth 
unto men, according- to their, wills ; 
whether they be unto salvation or 
unto destruction." 

Read all the 29th chapter, and 
the 36th chapter of Alma. I know 
them nearly by heart, because I 
have read them so often; and I 
maintain that no man can read those 
two chapters and then believe for 
one minute that any man was idotic 
enough to write them, hoping to 
sell the book as a novel. It is the 
outpouring of an honest heart. It is 
the outpouring of a heart that de- 
sires the salvation of all mankind. 
This man Alma verily desired that 
he could have the voice of an angel 
to cry repentance unto all the ends 
of the earth. This man desired that 
his son should serve God; and he 
confesses in the 36th chapter that 
he had been guilty of waywardness 
in his youth. He confesses his 
wrongdoings, that he went with 
the sons of King Mosiah trying to 
destroy the Church of God. He 
confesses that an angel of God came 
and stopped them by the way, and 
commanded them if they would be 
saved themselves to seek not to 
destroy the Church of God ; and he 
says that he erred unto God for 
repentance, and that, after feeling 
the depth of sorrow and humility, 
he was forgiven. These are the out- 
pourings of a Prophet of God. No 
man can read the life of the Pro- 
phet Nephi, as recorded in this 
book without being a better man, if 
he reads it with an honest heart 
and a desire to learn. I read the 
Book of Mormon when I was a 
young man, and the one character 
among all others that I fell in 
love with was Nephi, a mian who 
never complained, who was never 



discouraged, who was never des- 
pondent; a man who had for his 
guiding star the conviction mani- 
fest in the remark he made to his 
father on returning from seeing that 
wonderful vision, when his father 
desired him to go up to Jerusalem 
for the record of Laban. He said, 
"I will go and do the things which 
the Lord hath commanded, for I 
know that the Lord giveth no com- 
mandments unto the children of 
men, save He shall prepare a way 
for them] that they may accomplish 
the thing which he commandeth 
them." And he went up with his 
brethren, and Laban refused to de- 
liver the plates. Then they took all 
their wealth and offered it to Laban, 
and he again refused to give them 
the plates, and sought to take their 
lives. Then his brothers desired 
to go back to their father and his 
tent in the wilderness, but Nephi 
said, "We will not go back until 
we have accomplished the thing 
which the Lord has commanded 
us." And when Laban had stolen 
their gold and silver and driven 
them out, the brothers beat Nephi, 
but the angel of God appeared and 
commanded them to desist, and told 
them to go up again to Jerusalem 
and God would deliver Laban into 
their hands. But after the angel 
had departed his brothers began to 
murmlur and said : "How is it pos- 
sible that the Lord will deliver 
Laban into our hands? Behold, he 
is a mighty man, and he can com- 
mand fifty, yea, even he can slay 
fifty ; then why not us ?" But Nephi 
answered them : 

"Come, let us be faithful in 
keeping the commandments of 
the Lord ; for behold he is 
mightier than all the earth, then 
why not mightier than Laban and 
his fifty, yea, or even than his tens

of thousands." "Let us be faithful 
in keeping the commandments of 
the Lord." That, O ye Latter-day 
Saints, is the key-note for success 
in any labor that God gives to us. 
Let us be faithful in keeping the 
commandments of God. 

May God bless us; may we be 
true and faithful in keeping His 
commandments. I ask it in the 
name of Jesus. Amen. 

The congregation sang the hymn, 
"Lord dismiss us with Thy bless- 
ing." 

Benediction was offered by Elder 
Joseph E. Smith.

ELDEK STEPHEN L. CHIPMAN. 

(President of Alpine Stake.) 

My beloved brethren and sisters, 
I trust that the few moments I 
speak to you this afternoon that I 
will be assisted by the faith and 
sympathy of those who are assem- 
bled, that I may express my feelings, 
and report acceptably to my heav- 
enly Father, satisfactorily unto my- 
self and, I hope, profitably unto 
you. I realize the responsibility 



that rests upon me, and upon the 
other brethren who are called to 
speak. We have here a vast con- 
gregation, and I am not certain that 
you will all be able to hear, but I 
trust that I may have sufficient vol- 
ume in my voice and be able to ex- 
ert sufficient strength that all may 
hear. I know how eager the Saints 
are, as a rule, to listen to the testi- 
mony of the general authorities of 
the Church, when they come to- 
gether on occasions of this kind. I 
always desire to sit where I may 
hear all that is said, because I re- 
alize that it is a good thing to listen 
to the living oracles of God. I take 
great pleasure in reading the holy 
scriptures, and I also have pleas- 
ure in listening to the men 
whom God has set in the Church 
to give unto us that spir- 
itual food that is necessary for each 
and every Latter-day Saint. My 
experience has taught me it is nec- 
essary that we partake of spiritual 
nourishment in order that we may 
be strengthened in spirit, just as it 
is necessary to partake of food to 
keep our physical bodies in proper 
condition. 

I have rejoiced exceedingly in 
the spirit of this conference, and 
in the testimonies that have been 
borne concerning the truthfulness 
of the Gospel, and the excellent con- 
dition that the Church is in today. 
I rejoice also in the fact that so 
many of our brethren and sisters, 
and friends, have availed them- 
selves of the opportunity, and have 
gathered together at this time, be- 
cause I realize that if we keep in 
close touch with that which is going 
on in the Church we feel better. 
The nearer we live to the Lord, and 
the more earnest we are in the per- 
formance of our duties, the more we 
will have of the Spirit of the Lord. 



60 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



and the more we will love the Lord 
and love the work He has estab- 
lished, and the greater love we will 
have for those who have been chos- 
en and sustained to preside in the 
Church. When we meet them, and 
enter into the spirit of their labors, 
we learn to appreciate them more, 
we love to associate with them, and 
we have a greater desire to sustain 
them with our faith and good 
works. I love the men who are 
placed to preside over us in this 
Church, and I listen to the instruc- 
tions given by them, because I wish 
to become informed upon the prin- 
ciples of truth that they desire the 
people should know, that I in turn 
may be able to do some good among 
those over whom I have been called 
to preside. 

We have in our stake of Zion 
many noble men and women, men 
and women of integrity, full of faith 
and good works. I meet quite fre- 
quently with them at their homes, 
and in meetings of the various 
organizations and I feel that the 
saints in the Alpine Stake of Zion 
are living more closely to the prin- 
ciples of the Gospel, are attending 
to their meetings better, are freer 
with their contributions for the er- 
ection of meeting houses, than ever 
before. I have discovered that the 
more the saints do in these lines 
the better they feel. The stake is 
now about seven years old," and 
during that period we have erected 
a number of meeting houses in var- 
ious wards, ranging in cost from 
$3,000 to about $60,000. I have dis- 
covered, in looking over the records 
of our people, that during the con- 
struction of these meeting houses 
the saints have been more faithful, 
and have paid more tithing, than 
they had done in previous years 
when they were not erecting meet- 
ing houses. They have attended to 



their duties better, they have sus- 
tained those who have presided 
over them faithfully, and there has 
been good feeling in the hearts of 
the people, when they have some- 
thing to do. I am satisfied that the 
more busily we are engaged, the 
more earnest we are in promulgat- 
ing the principles of eternal life, 
and putting forth our efforts in this 
work, and the more firmly we stand 
in the Church. I have noticed many 
of our young men who have gone 
on missions, and have returned full 
of faith and the spirit of the Gos- 
pel, if they are kept busy, if they 
have something to do and they do it, 
they are strong pillars in the 
Church, able workers, and they ac- 
complish much good among the peo- 
ple. I have also noticed other young 
men who have filled missions, and 
on their return apparently have had 
the spirit of the work, but through 
the force of circumstances, or some 
environments, they have not been 
used in the wards. They go away 
from home, out to the sheep herd, 
to the mining camp or upon the 
railroads, or other places where 
they are not surrounded witlh a 
proper influence, where they have 
not the opportuntiy of laboring in 
the Church affairs and in a com- 
paratively short time they become 
cold in spirit, and some become 
reckless in their manner of living. 
Therefore, it is important that we 
all have something to do, that we 
keep busy, so that we have not time 
to do anything only that which will 
have a tendency to uplift us, and to 
build up the Church that the Lord 
has established in the earth never 
more to be thrown down or given 
to another people. 
_ I have rejoiced, my brethren and 
sisters, in the sentiment that has 
been so freely expressed at this con- 
ference that our people, above all 



BISHOP JOHN W. HART. 



61 



on the face of the earth, ought to 
be temperate in their habits. The 
Latter-day Saints have had good 
teachings, and have been trained to 
be temperate. They have been 
taught from childhood that it is 
not right to partake of strong drink, 
or use tobacco; and that tea and 
coffee, mentioned in the Word of 
Wisdom as hot drinks, ought not to 
be used in their homes. I sometimes 
wonder that we are so full of sym- 
pathy toward some of our brethren 
and sisters in advanced years, when 
I realize the fact that many of them 
have had these teachings and train- 
ing from almost their infancy, 
through the Word of Wsidom. If 
there is a people on the face of the 
earth who should be prepared to 
carry out counsel with reference to 
these things, it should be the Lat- 
ter-day Saints. I regret to say that 
some of our young men are ignor- 
ing the teachings of their fathers 
and the authorities of the Church. 
There are none of them who felt 
that they desired to become drunk- 
ards, but they first partook in a so- 
cial way and, after they have been 
"treated" by their companions, they 
desire to return the compliment, 
and through these associations from 
time to time they have come to 
drink a little today, tomorrow, next 
week, next month, and soon they 
are in the condition that they in- 
dulge every day, and then many 
times during the day. But we are 
continuing the training, we are try- 
ing to live above these, habits, and 
to carry out the counsel of the au- 
thorities of the Church, as an ex- 
ample before the people and for our 
own individual blessing and bene- 
fit. In the Alpine stake of Zion, 
there are, I regret to say, a number 
of places where intoxicants can be 
purchased. In some small settle- 
ments there are as many as two or 



three of these places, and I fear 
they are not maintained wholly by 
those who are not of our faith, pos- 
sibly some who> claim membership 
in the Church frequent these places, 
and purchase that which destroys 
the body, and oft times the soul. 
I hope that the spirit of temperance 
will spread throughout the land, 
and that we will have the strength 
of character, determination, and de- 
sire that will enable us to free our- 
selves from the saloon evil. I hope 
we will appreciate this sentiment 
that has come to us, that we will 
stand by each other, and that we 
will not sympathize with those who 
are opposing the work of God and 
that which is for our best good. I 
have heard some of our brethren 
say, I would believe in prohibition 
if we could prohibit. That argu- 
ment is unreasonable. The law 
against murder does not prevent 
that crime, but that is no reason 
why there should be no such law. 

Let us, my brethren and sisters, 
get just as near to the mark as we 
possibly can. There is one thing cer- 
tain, and I wish I could impress it 
upon every Latter-day Saint, and 
that is, we will never rise above 
our aim ; if we set our aim high 
and work to it, we will assuredly 
come close to it. I hope that our 
aim will be high, and that we will 
use good judgment, and persistent- 
ly labor along these lines, that 
good may be accomplished. I ask 
it in the name of Jesus. Amen. 



BISHOP JOHN W. HART. 

My brethren and sisters, I feel 
that my being called to occupy this 
position is a far greater honor to 
me, possibly, than a benefit to you. 
As has been stated by Apostle Claw- 
son, I preside over a very humble 



62 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



ward in the State of Idaho. I am 
from the youngest stake of Zion, I 
believe, the Rigby stake, that has 
just recently been orgainzed. I feel, 
however, under these conditions, 
that you will not expect very much 
from me. For the last 23 years, 
probably longer, I have placed my 
services in the hands of the Lord, 
for Him to use me in any way that 
He could get the most good from 
me. I rejoice in mingling with 
you at this conference. I have been 
greatly interested in the instruction 
that has been given unto us. We 
always hear something new, or that 
appears new to us, at each of these 
conferences. 

The Gospel that we have received 
is a great plan. It embodies a very 
large scope of thought and reason. 
We cannot learn all about this Gos- 
pel in one day, or in a limited time. 
It takes diligent thought, humility 
and prayer to our Heavenly Fath- 
er. When our Savior was upon the 
earth, He established this plan. He 
made the fundamental principles of 
the Gospel very plain, simple, and 
easy of comprehension. He told us 
what would be required of us in or- 
der that we might enjoy the bene- 
fits of His mission to mankind up- 
on this earth. Among other things, 
he said, "This is eternal life to know 
thee, the only true and living God, 
and Jesus Christ whom thou hast 
sent." My brethren and sisters, if 
we are to be saved in the kingdom 
of heaven, to receive an exaltation 
therein, there is a great work for 
us to do. It is necessary that we 
keep busy at it all the time. If we 
do not, we will fall short of those 
blessings that we desire to enjoy. 

It is necessary, in order to intel- 
ligently worship the Almighty, to 
know who He is, to know some- 
thing of His attributes. If we do 
not know these things, it is impos- 



sible for us to worship Him intel- 
ligently. He says we must know 
Him in order to gain eternal life. 
He has pointed out the way where- 
by we - can claim and obtain this 
blessing. It i-s imoossible for us to 
know God only through revelation. 
Peter, the great apostle, knew Him 
only through this principle. When 
the Savior of the world asked Peter, 
among other things, who He, Jesus, 
was, Peter answered emphat- 
ically, "Thou art Christ the 
son of the living God." The 
Savior then said unto him, "Bless- 
ed art thou, for flesh and blood hath 
not revealed this unto thee but my 
Father which is in heaven." As 
further evidence showing that we 
cannot know the Father only 
through revelation, we have learned 
through that principle that God is 
a tangible being, as is also His Son, 
that He lives and that He hears 
and answers the petitions of His 
children ; that He has the power to 
chastize us when we do wrong, 
and to bless and reward us when 
we do good. Not all of the peo- 
ple of the world know God in this 
true sense. They have not received 
this information as we have receiv- 
ed it. Notwithstanding the fact 
that Jesus made the conditions very 
plain when He was upon the earth. 
The Savior said then that He was 
the express image of His Father, 
that whosoever had seen Him had 
seen the Father also. After the 
Messiah was put to death, and came 
forth out of the tomb, a resurrect- 
ed being, it appears that many of 
the disciples questioned as to the 
kind of being He was, whether He 
was tangible or not. The Savior 
knew this doubt existed in their 
minds. As a consequence, He ap- 
peared to them from time to time, 
in His resurrected form, that they 



BISHOP JOHN W. HART. 63 



might be convinced of His per- 
sonality, that there might not be 
any doubt left in their minds con- 
cerning His tangibility, that they 
might be able to go forth and teach 
the people the kind of beings God 
and His son Jesus Christ are. We 
find in this dispensation that,' when 
the Gospel was restored to the 
earth, and the plan of salvation in- 
augurated among the people, the 
Lord impressed this great principle 
upon the minds of those whom He 
placed in charge of His work. He 
was so particular in this matter, 
and deemed it of such consequence 
that the Father and the Son both 
came down to the earth, and ap- 
peared unto the chosen Prophet, 
Joseph Smith. Hence we have the 
testimony renewed in this dispensa- 
tion; we have the evidence of 
righteous men who have seen these 
Heavenly Beings, and know of their 
tangibility ; and they have given un- 
to us the means by which we also 
may know them. How ? They are the 
same principles by which Peter 
knew, and that the Savior estab- 
lished so that we may know. The 
Spirit of the Lord, that we are en- 
titled to be in possession of, will 
impart this knowledge, and place us 
in the proper condition to obtain 
salvation and exaltation. These, my 
brethren and sisters, are great prin- 
ciples. They are things that we 
should understand thoroughly. I 
would exhort the Latter-day Saints, 
both young and old, to seek for evi- 
dence along these lines, to work out 
salvation for yourselves, because it 
is a personal work. The Lord is 
a just God, and has never asked 
His people to do something for 
nothing. Do not let us place faith 
too strongly upon the arm of flesh; 
but let us stand squarely on our in- 
dividual knowledge in these mat- 
ters. 



I feel well in the work of God, 
and I feel to encourage the Latter- 
day Saints. As has been stated, I 
come from Idaho, and I want to 
say, before I sit down, that the 
work is progressing there, the same 
spirit which permeates you here is 
enjoyed by the Latter-day Saints 
there, they are prospering and 
growing. Wards and stakes are be- 
ing organized in the southeast of 
. the state of Idaho, probably faster 
than anywhere else in the Lord's 
vineyard. I wish to say, further, 
that those who are not of us, not 
members of our Church, are friend- 
ly, as a rule. We have a multitude 
of such friends who are fair-mind- 
ed, and willing that we should en- 
joy our rights as Latter-day Saints, 
in accordance with the privileges 
guaranteed unto us by that sacred 
instrument, the Constitution of the 
United States. We have a few 
enemies, but friends are greatly in 
the majority, and we are very 
thankful for this. We are grateful 
for all of the blessings we have 
received from the Lord. We are 
thankful that we are permitted to 
live in this dispensation, to know, 
and to see, and to hear the living 
oracles of God, and to partake of 
the inspiration that flows from the 
Prophet of God. I know that he is 
a Prophet, that he stands at the 
head of the work of the Lord here, 
and I sustain him as such, as it is 
our duty to do so. 

Let us, my brethren and sisters, 
order our lives so that we will be 
above criticism; be honest, true, 
just, and shun that which is evil, 
and the Lord will continue to bless 
us. Let our light so shine that oth- 
ers will see our good works and fol- 
low in our footsteps, as Saints of 
God. May the Lord bless us to 
this end, I ask in the name of Jesus. 
Amen.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



ELDER MOSES W. TAYLOR. 

(President of Summit Stake.) 

My brethren and sisters, I trust 
that you will give me an interest 
in your faith and prayers, as you 
evidently have done with the breth- 
ren who have preceded me. I ap- 
preciate the remarks that have been 
made, and I agree with them. I 
cannot help but think that we have 
leaders in the Church and Kingdom 
of God who are setting an exam- 
ple that is worthy of imitation. 
When President Joseph F. Smith 
was before the investigating com- 
mittee in Washington, one of the 
members asked him this question : 
"Mr. Smith, how rriany children 
have you?" and his answer was, "I 
have 42," and he added, "I am 
proud of every one of them." Now 
why should he be proud? Let me 
tell you: — President Smith, as I 
know, has 42 children who keep 
the word of wisdom; all of them 
who are old enough say their pray- 
ers, night and morning, and they 
attend their meetings and do their 
duty as Latter-day Saints. Now 
then, that is a splendid example for 
the leader of our Church to give 
unto us. In the stake where I live 
we remember it, and we are trying 
to live up to that one of the most 
wonderful examples in all the 
world. 

In our Stake the presidency the 
high council, the bishops of wards, 
and the various other officers tell 
each other how they are living, 
how their families are living, and 
what they are doing. Let me re- 
port to you a little about these 
high councilmen. They say, "In 
our family we keep the Word of 
Wisdom. When we come to the 
breakfast table in the morning, we 



have family prayer, and we ask 
a blessing upon the food. My wife 
takes turn with me in prayer, and 
my children who are old enough 
take their turn. They have their 
secret prayers ; and they belong to 
various organizations of the 
Church." Some of the members 
say, "I have in my family a member 
in the Religion Class, another in 
the Primary Association, another 
in the Young Men's Association, 
another in the Young Ladies' as- 
sociation, and another in the Relief 
Society; and we sustain the various 
organizations of the ward." Others 
say, "I have a son on a mission." 
They are proud to report when they 
have a son that is on a mission. I 
want to say to you that the children 
in the stake are sustaining their 
mothers and fathers in these things, 
and are helping forward the var- 
ious organizations, assisting the 
Bishops and others who are called 
to work of responsibility for the 
good of the people and the building 
up of the kingdom of God. I do 
not know of a boy, or girl in the 
Church, in the Summit Stake of 
Zion, that breaks the Word of Wis- 
dom. I know that their fathers and 
mothers do not. They are sustain- 
ing their fathers and mothers in 
this great work, and the Lord is 
blessing and prospering them, for 
keeping His commandments. One 
of our High Council men recently 
made to us this report in regard to 
prayer : 

"Sometimes I hire men at my 
place,andsom l e of triem ,are not mem- 
bers-of the Church. When those non- 
members were in the house I have 
felt as if it was casting pearls before 
swine if I had prayers before them. 
On one occasion I had a young man, 
a gentile, to take over into the res- 
ervation, and he came to my house. 



ELDER MOSES W. TAYLOR.

When he was there, I got up early 
and went out and prepared the 
horses to take the trip, and while 
I was out I made up my mind I 
would go in and get breakfast, and 
start off without family prayers. 
But, when I went in to breakfast, 
the children had come out, and 
table was set, and the chairs were 
placed, and some were already 
kneeling down, and I had to have 
prayers. After we got into the wag- 
on and drove off , this man said to me. 
'Is that the kind of thing the Lat- 
ter-day Saints always do? Is that 
the way Latter-day Saints live?' I 
said yes, if a Latter-day Saint is liv- 
ing his religion, he has prayers in 
his family every morning, just" like 
that. 'Well,' he says, 'I want to 
investigate, I want to find out more 
about your people, and what your 
people are doing.' He has since 
bought some books, and I under- 
stand that he is going to join the 
Church." One of the authorities 
said to us today, what a magnifi- 
cent thing it would be if the people 
who came out to this country could 
find that all the Latter-day Saints 
were living their religion, that they 
were consistent with it, and with 
the fact 'that they believe that 
Joseph Smith was a Prophet of 
God. I heard some one say recent- 
ly, a man was introduced to me as 
Brother so and so. "Why no," 
said the one introduced, "he is not 
a brother, he is not a member of the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
Day Saints ! he carries a sign that 
he! does not believe that Joseph 
Smith is a prophet of God." 
"What do you mean?" "Why, that 
cigar he has got in his mouth is 
a sure sign that he does not be- 
lieve Joseph Smith is a Prophet." 

We believe in temperance. Some 
of the Saints in our stake will hard- 



ly drink hot water, and some al- 
most hesitate to use hot gravy 
(laughter). We have good water 
out there, the finest in the world; 
and we raise fine trout, and many 
of our friends come in the summer 
to eat the trout, drink the water and 
build themselves up. Now, in re- 
gard to the question of getting rid 
. of saloons. The saloons do not hurt 
President Smith, because all his 
family keep away from such places. 
It is not the faithful sons of the 
president of the Church, or of the 
apostles, or of the bishops and 
presidents of stakes who patronize, 
saloons. Let me tell you what one 
of the Bishops of one of our wards 
did, and the Relief Society helped 
him in it. There was a saloon 
started in the ward, and made us 
all kinds of trouble. Sometime 
passed, and the members of the 
Church bought a lot just opposite 
the saloon on which to build a meet- 
ing house. Then the Bishop came 
to the presidency of the stake and 
said, "What shall we do about that 
saloon?" The presidency of the 
stake said, you go on hauling and 
cutting rock every day, right a- 
long. So they did it, and in about 
three weeks, he telephoned the pres- 
idency of the stake, and said, This 
saloon man has got quite friendly, 
he comes out, and talks with me. 
The people don't patronize him very 
much, and he says he will sell his 
saloon for so much, what shall we 
do? I told him to offer $50 less, 
and I will give you the money. 
Then the Relief Society bought it; 
and the women went into the va- 
cated saloon, and they got lime and 
made it into whitewash, and they 
whitewashed floors and everything 
else nearly; they wanted to wash 
the sin away, you know. And then 
they erected a long board table in 



66 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



it, and every day they got up a 
big dinner in that old saloon build- 
ing. Now they have got as fine 
a meeting house right opposite that 
former saloon building as there is 
any where, and the people built it, 
and it didn't cost them very much 
money. Thus sometimes you see, a 
saloon building is a very nice thing 
to have, if it is used by the Relief 
Society (laughter). 

I pray that the spirit of the Lord 
will be with the Latter-day Saints 
always and that we will follow the 
magnificent example that is set by 
.the President of our Church. Amen. 

The choir sang the hymn, "Praise 
ye the Lord! 'tis good to raise." 

ELDER OLEEN N. STOHL. 

(President of Box Elder Stake). 

I desire, my brethren and sisters, 
while I stand before you, that the 
same swejet influence may direct 
my mind in the words I utter that 
has inspired all that has been said 
and done during this conference, 
and that has suggested to our breth- 
ren who have spoken this after- 
noon that which would be for our 
good. I rejoiced very much yester- 
day morning when the president tes- 
tified that the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter day Saints is in a 
better condition today, spiritually 
and temporally, and from the stand- 
point of unity, than it ever was 
before. When he made that state- 
ment, I thought to myself, that so 
far as my knowledge goes in re- 
lation to conditions in the Church, 
and particularly the stake in which 
I have the privilege to labor, is 
concerned, I know that he speaks 
the truth; and I am very thankful 
for this condition and for this 



knowledge. That is only as it 
should be. While we are to be com- 
mended for the condition, still it is 
nothing more than ought to exist 
among us as a people. I think of 
the army of workers that we have 
in the Church, who are interested, 
and zealous and faithful in the great 
labor in which we are engaged. A 
short time ago I had the privilege 
to visit one of the wards in our 
stake, attending a ward conference, 
and when the Bishop had the ward 
officers presented, I found in that 
small ward they had 178 brethren 
and sisters working as officers in 
the ward and the respective organi- 
zations. Nearly two-fifths of the 
members of that ward engaged in 
the Relief Society, in the Sunday 
School, in the Young Men's and 
the Young Ladies' Mutual Im- 
provement Associations, in the Pri- 
mary organization, and in the Re- 
ligion Class, as officers in those or- 
ganizations. When we can select 
two-fifths of our people and get 
them harnessed up in the work of 
the Lord, and get them to perform 
the duties required of them in their 
work good is bound to come out of 
it, and the Church is going to con- 
tinue to improve as long as those 
conditions exist. Now, I think this 
Church has always been improving ; 
I believe there has never been a day 
since it was first organized when 
this work went backwards. Its 
course has always been onward and 
upward. That is its course today, 
and I have full faith that it will 
so continue. But, while the con- 
dition is as President Smith stated, 
there is room for further improve-' 
ment, and we all realize this fact; 
and in realizing it, I feel that we 
are determined to do better, to live 
better lives as Latter-day Saints. If 
the Lord has permitted us to see and 
understand our weaknesses, I think 



ELDER OLEEN N. STOHL. 



67 



we should strive to overcome those 
weaknesses; and as we individual- 
ly overcome them we are improving 
and bettering ourselves. In thus 
improving ourselves, we are im- 
proving' the great organization to 
which we belong. I believe, brethren 
and sisters, it is very important that 
we all should be thoroughly con- 
versant with the great organizations 
of the Church, that we should sus- 
tain the authority of the Church, 
and assist in supporting the Priest- 
hood, and in helping to perform the 
duties that are required. In line 
with this thought, I feel that the 
success of these organizations 
that I have referred to largely de- 
pends upon the thorough conversion 
of our fathers and niothers to the 
great work those organizations are 
performing. For example, I rem- 
ember a few years ago, in our stake, 
that many of our people were not 
converted to Religion Class work. 
Some of them thought it an un- 
necessary organization, that we had 
enough organizations; in fact, that 
we are over-organized. Well now, 
since the Religion Class has been 
operating and working among the 
people of our stake, parents have 
begun to see the benefits derived 
from it, they have seen the bless- 
ings that have come to their chil- 
dren in their being taught the etern- 
al principles of life and salvation,in 
the children being taught to pray, 
to ask a blessing upon the food, to 
perform littlq duties required of 
them towards their parents, and to- 
wards the officers in the ward. They 
have seen the good that has come 
from these organizations, and that 
is coming from them, and they are 
converted better to that work to- 
day than they ever were before. The 
result is that the Religion Class 
movement is lunging forward to- 
day as it never did before. I believe 



that we as parents ought to appre- 
ciate these various organizations, 
and encourage our children to sus- 
tain them, and patronize and take 
part in them. If we will do this, 
these organizations will flourish in 
the Church, and we will realize 
their great advantages. 

And this also applies to the 
Priesthood organizations. I feel that 
if there is any work in which the 
parents can co-operate with the 
bishops of the various wards, it is 
that in relation to the lesser Priest- 
hood. They should encourage their 
boys to perform the duties required 
of them by the bishops, and in at- 
tending the meetings of their re- 
spective organizations. I think, my 
brethren and sisters, this is a vital 
point. There is nothing comes clos- 
er to us than our children; nothing 
more important to us than they are, 
nothing that will ever be of great- 
er worth to us than they. They are 
our jewels, they are our wealth. 
Temporal things are not to be com- 
pared to them. Our children are 
given to be ours eternally, under 
the holy covenant, and it is our duty 
to interest ourselves in them, to see 
that they can be ours in honor here 
and throughout eternity. We can- 
not do anything better than help to 
encourage our children, and es- 
tablish them in the faith, encourage 
them in performing duties along 
the lines that are indicated in the 
respective organizations of the 
Church. 

I think that, as parents, we should 
unite our work with that of the 
respective organizations. We should 
know what they are doing, and in 
becoming acquainted with them, we 
might conduct little religion classes 
in our homes, and there consider 
the lessons and the work that is be- 
ing taken up by the Religion Class, 
the Primary Associations, the Mu- 



68 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



tual Improvement Associations and 
the Sunday Schools, and thus show 
to our children that we are inter- 
ested in them. If we would do this, 
and conduct these little devotional 
exercises in our home, we would 
plant faith in our children's hearts, 
and plant confidence in them, in 
the great work in which we are en- 
gaged. They would feel that we 
are sincere in it, that we are trying 
to live it, and that we are earnest in 
our desires that they should live it. 

Our children live very much as 
we want them to. It is our duty 
as Latter-day Saints to live so that 
they can see our good works, and 
be willing to emulate our example. 
I was impressed sometime ago by 
a thought that was* expressed by 
the Prophet Joseph Smith, that we 
cannot be perfect without our child- 
ren; we cannot enjoy exaltation in 
the kingdom of God without our 
children. If we expect to enjoy this 
exaltation and this glory, we must 
have our children with us; other- 
wise we cannot enjoy these bless- 
ings to the fullest extent. Now, 
if we would take up this work, and 
get our families to unite with these 
respective organizations in the 
Church, I believe sincerely that we 
would accomplish wonderful re- 
sults, and that this work will con- 
tinue to grow much more rapidly, 
perhaps, than it has in the past. 

I rejoice in this Gospel; I know 
that it is the work of God, and I 
am thankful to my Heavenly Fath- 
er for this testimony. I feel that, if 
there is one thing more important 
than another at the present time for 
the Latter-day Saints to consider, 
it is to plant in the hearts of their 
children a knowledge and a testi- 
mony of the divinity of this work. 
It is important that our children 
believe they will get it if they will 
seek it in the way the Lord has di- 



rected, and keep His command- 
ments. One thought that gives me 
great joy in connection with the 
doctrines of the Church is that they 
stand the test. The Savior, you 
know, on one occasion said, "My 
doctrine is not mine but his that 
sent me; if any man will do His 
will he shall know of the doctrine 
whether it is of God or whether I 
speak of myself." Our doctrines 
stand the test; if you will do the 
will of the Father, in other words, 
if you will accept the doctrine, 
and practice it in your daily lives, 
you will know of the doctrine 
whether it is true or not. Where is 
there a man or a woman who has 
tested the doctrines of our Lord and 
Savior Jesus Christ in this world 
and ever found them wanting? No 
man who has lived humbly, in ac- 
cordance with the teachings of the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ, can stand 
forth and say that they are not 
true, that they are not of God. Now, 
let us apply the test, and continue 
to add one test after the other. I tell 
you it will do more to establish us 
and our children in the work of our 
Heavenly Father than anything else 
we can do. 

May the blessings of Heaven rest 
upon the people of Zion, and may 
we rejoice in the great work which 
is being accomplished, and ever feel 
to thank our Heavenly Father that 
this Gospel came to us, and that we 
are partakers of the same. May we 
live so that we can be an honor to 
the work, I ask it in the name of 
Jesus. Amen. 

BISHOP HEBER C. IVERSON. 

Like those who have already 
spoken, I greatly rejoice in the 
spirit of this conference, in the 
splendid and wholesome advice and 
admonition that has fallen from the 



BISHOP HEBER C. IVERSON. 



69 



lips of the servants of our Father 
who have been inspired of Him in 
all their utterances. 

I am grateful to live in this day 
when we see a sentiment spread- 
ing abroad that bids fair to become 
universal, almost, if not entirely, 
that shall restrain, and obliterate if 
possible, the dens of infamy and 
vice that have cursed our country 
for so many years. My heart has 
ever gone out to the.youner men and 
women in Israel. I am not so far 
advanced along the path of life that 
I am unmindful, or unconscious of 
the character and force of the 
temptations with which the young 
men and young women are daily 
surrounded. They love amuse- 
ments, they love pleasure, and it is 
natural they should, but in seeking 
amusements and pleasure they are 
sometimes taken advantage of and 
led into paths of vice, innocently. 
Therefore, I feel that it becomes 
the duty of the Elders in Israel, 
■and the citizens of this common- 
wealth, to recognize the fact that 
these places which lead to sin, to 
death, to sorrow, to poverty and 
shame, should be removed from our 
midst. We know that their es- 
tablishment and maintenance is con- 
trary, in every particular, to the 
spirit and genius of the Gospel of 
Jesus Christ. You and I have been 
taught from our infancy that to ob- 
serve the word of the Lord, the 
Word of Wisdom, would be help- 
ful to us in every way. We have 
put it to the test and have proven it 
true. We know the Word of Wis- 
dom is scientifically as well as 
scripturally true, and it is for the 
well being of our Father's children. 
I say, therefore, this movement is 
a blessed thing, and 1 hail the sen- 
timent heartily, as do you. I know 
this is the sentiment of every true 



Latter-Day Saint from the centre 
of the Church to its circumference, 
even to the uttermost bounds of 
Zion. 

As President Stohl has said, 
there is nothing more precious to 
us, as fathers and mothers in Israel, 
than the children whom! God has 
given us. Are they not the great- 
est source of sorrow or happiness 
according to their aims, their lives 
and conduct. Is there anything we 
possess that brings to us more real 
joy and pleasure. We have heard 
this afternooa that President Jos- 
eph F. Smith said, when giving his 
testimony before the investigating 
committee, that he had. 42 children, 
each and all of whom he was proud 
of. Does he not feel in them a great 
source of happiness? And can you 
not say, when your sons and 
daughters keep the Word of Wis- 
dom, the commandments of God, 
that you are proud of them, and 
they are a source of the greatest joy 
and pleasure that is possible for the 
human heart to experience. As 
President Moses Taylor said, they 
are not temporary possessions, they 
are eternal possessions, for they 
are children of God as well as our 
children. The Apostle Paul says: 
"We have had fathers of the flesh 
which corrected us, and we gave 
them reverence, should we not 
much rather be in subjection to 
the Father of sprits and liye." God 
is the father of the eternal part of 
the child that is given us here. We 
recognize in man a dual character; 
a dual being, physical as well as 
a spiritual. We recognize the truth 
of the sentiment so beautifully ex- 
pressed in that hymn — 

O my Father, thou that dwellest 
In the high and glorious place ! 

When shall I regain thy presence, 
And again behold Thy face? 



70 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



In thy holy habitation 

Did my spirit once reside? 
In my first primeval childhood 

Was I nurtured near thy side ! 

For a wise and glorious purpose, 

Thou hast placed me here on earth, 
And withheld the recollection 

Of my former friends and birth ; 
Yet ofttimes a secret something 

Whispered, "You're a stranger here;." 
And I felt that I had wandered 

From a more exalted sphere. 

I had learned to call thee Father 

Through thy Spirit from on high; 
But, until the key of knowledge 

Was restored, I knew not why. 
In the heavens are parents single? 

No ; the thought makes reason stare ! 
Truth is reason; truth eternal 

Tells me I've a mother there. 

\ 

That doctrine was ridiculed 
seventy years ago, when announced 
by this hymn, teaching what had 
been given by inspiration flowing 
first through the mind of the Pro- 
phet Joseph Staith, that we have a 
mother in heaven. Not long since 
I read in one of the leading maga- 
zines of this country, from one of 
the great thinkers of our day, that 
he recognizes this truth as one of 
the most profound and sublime in 
the universe, that womanhood 
forms a portion of the Godhead. He 
discourses very learnedly upon the 
dual sequence of the term Elohim, 
and proves conclusively by his de- 
duction that there is a feminine ele- 
ment existing with the Deity, and 
that we have in Deity a mother as 
well as a father. There are mothers 
of our spirits. As the poet has said 
God has kindly sent to earth these 
sons and daughters of his. His 
spirits become our children in the 
flesh. 

To the mothers of our children I 
will say : Could you have any great- 
er honor, could you possibly have 
any greater ambition in the world, 



than to be the medium, through 
which a child of God shall come to 
earth, to fulfil a wise and glorious 
purpose ? Do you envy your brother, 
your husband, your male relatives 
for the honors that come to them, 
because, forsooth, they occupy posi- 
tions of responsibilty ? I say to you 
mothers in Israel, that yours is one 
of the most honored and honorable 
positions occupied by any child of 
our Father upon earth. We do hon- 
or to the hero of the battle field. We 
erect magnificent monuments to his 
glory, because he offers his life in 
defense of his country, moved, pos- 
sibly, by the love of fame, or of 
popularity. Should he give his life 
while engaged in the duty of taking 
the lives of his fellows, duty as he 
sees it, then we place his name up- 
on the pages of history, and it is 
handed down to future generations 
to be revered by them. We erect a 
splendid monument to his name, be- 
cause he jeopardized his life, 
through his heroism. How about 
the mother in Israel, who, in keep- 
ing the commandment of Him who 
said to Father Adam and Mother 
Eve, "Mutiply and replenish the 
earth," and who has kept inviolate 
the sacred covenants she has made 
with her husband in sacred and holy 
places, does she not jeopardize her 
life in maternity? Does she not 
place her life upon the altar of 
sacrifice and duty, ac J -?ndure un- 
told agony? I say to you hers are 
deeds of heroism worthy of the 
greatest monument ; nay, more than 
that, of an eternal crown in the cel- 
estial kingdom and presence of our 
Father. We have heard it said that 
"the hand that rocks the cradle is 
the hand that rules the world." 
Mothers, do you appreciate this 
fact? Do you realize that much de- 
pends upon you ; that the future of 



BISHOP HEBER C. IVERSON. 



71 



this Church, this community, this 
state, or this nation as a common- 
wealth, depends very largely upon 
you as mothers in Israel? Another 
one has said, and to me it seems a 
well deserved tribute to mother- 
hood, "God could not be with us al- 
ways, so He gave us mothers." If 
there are any under God's heaven 
deserving our tribute of praise for 
the offering of life with a love that 
is divine, a devotion that is angelic, 
that is charitable,long suffering and 
kind, that is willing to sacrifice all 
that one possesses for the love of 
another, it is the mother in Israel. 
After having passed through the 
dark valley of the shadow of death, 
having brought into the world a 
child of God, she watches patiently, 
prayerfully and faithfully over the 
little one, ever solicitous of its wel- 
fare, and devoted to its interests. 
President Roosevelt, not long ago, 
made use of these words, and I 
know you will agree with him ; "No 
leader in church, in state, in 
science, in art or industry, I care 
not how important tne cnaracter of 
his work begins to do work that 
compares in importance to that done 
by the father and mother in the 
home for they are the first of sover- 
eigns and the divinest of priests." 

The most sacred duty we have to 
perform in the earth is to care for 
those whom God has confided to our 
keeping, whom He has placed under 
our guardianship. We shall be held 
responsible for their care, not only 
for the precepts or teachings we 
give therm by word of mouth, but, 
as President Stohl said in his re- 
marks, we will be held sacredly re- 
sponsible for the example we set 
our children, for the very words we 
utter in their presence. More forci- 
ble, and more potent in the forming 
of their character, and establishing 



them in the faith of the Gospel, is 
our example, far more than our pre- 
cepts can possibly be. If we teach 
them by word of mouth some thing 
that our lives contradict, can you 
imagine their condition of mind, 
what their ideas are? May they not 
reason thus : My father is a hypo- 
crite, or else he is too weak to be- 
lieve, practice, and live up to that 
which he teaches me, and which I 
believe to be true. I do not desire 
to speak of my personal experience, 
but, aside from the testimony and 
strength of the Spirit, the still small 
voice, the whispering that moni- 
tor has given to me, as a result of 
my obedience to the Gospel, aside 
from this I say, that my father's life, 
his obedience to the requirements of 
the Gospel of Jesus Christ, is the 
most potent factor in sustaining me 
in the faith. It means much to me ; 
and I realize that my life also means 
much to my children, and that your 
lives will mean much to your 
children. 

Now my brethren and sisters, let 
us realize, as President Stohl has 
said, that these precious ones whom 
the Lord has entrusted to our care 
are likewise precious to Him. Each 
son of ours, each daughter of ours, 
is a child of His. It is a great re- 
sponsibility, and let us see to it that, 
even when it requires sacrifice on 
our part, and though we have to 
deny ourselves many things that 
we would like to enjoy,we shall be 
willing to deny ourselves for the 
salvation of our children. We 
should be men enough and women 
and Latter-day Saints enough to do 
it, for their good and benefit, and 
for our eternal blessing. 

I want to bear you my testimony, 
in conclusion. I know that this is 
the work of the Lord, and these 
men whom! we sustain as His ser- 



72 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



vants are inspired of Him. I desire, 
if I may have sufficient strength, 
to follow continuously, and consis- 
tently, him who is at the head of 
this work, whoever he may be, be 
he Joseph F. Smith or any other 
man whom God shall place there; 
for I know that the Lord will never 
permit the man who stands at the 
head of this work, as a guide to His 
children and to His Church, to 
counsel or advise contrary to His 
will. I believe that one in authority 
may give wrong advice, that may be 
possible, but the Lord's anointed 
never. He is my watchword, he is 
the one under God whom I shall 
endeavor to follow, by the help of 
the Lord. May we all do so, and our 
exaltation will be sure in the pres- 
ence of our Heavenly Father; 
which may God grant, in the name 
of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER RTJDGER CLAWSON. 

Absence of traitors an evidence of 
growth and stability of the Church. — 
Intense devotion now manifest. 

My brethren and sisters, the 
Church has been organized 78 years 
tomorrow. Have the Latter-day 
Saints made any progress in that 
period of time ? Mark this. Jos- 
eph Smith, the Prophet, was sur- 
rounded in part by false brethren 
men who were ready and willing 
to betray him. Some of them he 
had taken to his heart. Some of 
them were associated with him in 
the presidency, and some of them 
were connected with the quorum of 
the Twelve Apostles ; and there 
were many among the High Priests 
and the Seventies who were false 
to the Prophet Joseph Smith. Up- 
on one occasion Wilford Woodruff, 
who was approached by some of 



these men, lifted up his voice in 
warning, and predicted that if they 
did not repent of their sins that they 
would be damned and go to hell, 
and this because of their opposition 
to the Prophet, because of their 
willingness to betray him to his 
enemies, for they said he was a 
fallen prophet. He was not a fall- 
en prophet; they were fallen pro- 
phets. How is it today? Pause, 
my brethren and sisters, for a mom- 
ent and reflect. There are 56 stakes 
of Zion,each presided over by a pres- 
idency. That means 56 presidents 
and 112 counselors. There are 652 
wards, each presided over by a 
bishopric. That means 652 Bishops 
and 1304 counselors. There are 21 
missions in the world, presided over 
by 21 mission presidents. That 
makes altogether 2,145 very prom- 
inent and influential officers in the 
Church and not one, so far as I 
know, is a traitor, not one. 

Here is evidence brethren and 
sisters, that the Church has grown, 
that it has progressed that it has 
shot ahead wonderfully. And it 
may also be said of High Counsel- 
ors, Patriarchs, and High Priests, 
Seventies and Elders, and members 
of the Lesser Priesthood, and in 
fact of members of the Church, 
generally that very few, if any, are 
traitors among them. The Latter- 
day Saints hate the spirit of apos- 
tasy, and they despise a traitor, 
and God despises a traitor, and there 
will be no place found in the king- 
dom of heaven for a traitor, for the 
man who would betray his God or 
his religion, or his country. Now, I 
rejoice in this tesimony, for it con- 
firms to me the divinity of this 
work. The growth and progress 
of the Church clearly shows pow- 
erfully the spirit of God is operat- 
ing upon His people and upon His

servants to make strong in the faith, 
to make them firm in their attitude 
to the world and to each other, in 
keeping the commandments of God. 

This is a glorious time which we 
now behold, a glorious conference. 
The Spirit of the Lord is upon His 
people, and we are made to rejoice. 
There is a multitude of people as- 
sembled in the great tabernacle, 
and this house is filled to overflow- 
ing with Latter-day Saints, and 
the temple grounds are covered, 
and there are hundreds of Saints 
who have deft the grounds, and 
there are other hundreds upon 
the streets, and thousands and tens 
of thousands in the various stakes. 
Assuredly Zion is growing, and 
Zion is becoming strong, both spir- 
itually and temporally. Let me 
say to you that a people who are 
weak spiritually and strong tempor- 
ally are a weak people, and a peo- 
ple who are strong spiritually and 
weak temporally are a weak people ; 
but a people who are strong spir- 
itually and strong temporally are 
a strong people. My testimony is 
that the Latter-day Saints are a 
power in the earth which will be felt 
in a time to come. May the Lord 
bless and prosper us, is my prayer 
in the name of Jesus. Amen.

The choir sang the hymn, "Hark ! 
ten thousand thousand voices." 

Benediction was pronounced by 
Elder Arthur Parsons. 



Outdoor Meeting. 

The Tabernacle and Assembly 
Hall could not accommodate all who 
desired admittance and, the weather 
being propitious, several hundred 
assembled on the lawn, near the 



Bureau of Information building, 
where services were held at 2 p. m., 
under direction of Elder Benjamin 
Goddard. 

Prof. Charles Kent conducted 
the singing, and the selections ren- 
dered by him and his male chorus 
were highly appreciated. 

The services were commenced by 
the male chorus and congregation 
singing the hymn entitled "Sow- 
tag." 

Prayer was offered by Bishop 
David A. Smith. 

The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn, "Hope of Israel." 

ELDER BENJAMIN GODDARD. 

We are glad, my brethren and 
sisters, to meet with you in this 
capacity. We regret very much 
that we have not seats for all. 
It has been suggested that, if the 
Saints who desire to receive in- 
structions are to be accommodated 
hereafter, it will be necessary to 
roof over this entire block. From 
the increased attendance, it is very 
evident that "Zion is Growing," 
and that the cry is going out not 
only from our children in the Sab- 
bath schools, but from all Israel, 
"Give us Room that We May 
Dwell." I pray that the blessings 
of the Lord may rest upon you, 
that through your faith and pray- 
ers, the brethren who address you 
may be inspired of Him to give un- 
to you words of wisdom and truth- 
fulness. May God bless you un- 
to that end, in the name of Jesus. 
Amen. 

ELDER REUBEN G. MILLER. 

(President of Emery Stake). 

I am thankful to be here, and to 
listen to the testimonies that have 



74 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



been borne. It has done me good, 
and I trust that all of you who have 
been in the Tabernacle during this 
conference, have enjoyed the spirit 
of it. I think that the key-note has 
been sounded to this people, and it 
is that of local option. The time has 
come when we can put into practice 
the principles of the Gospel more 
fully than we have ever done. The 
Word of Wisdom is one of the 
most important subjects for this 
people to observe. For one, I shall 
advocate that question more strong- 
ly in the stake where I reside. At 
one time I was called upon to re- 
port the Emery Stake of Zion, and 
I spoke of the modern conveniences 
that were in the stake, not wish- 
ing to convey the idea that we had 
saloons belonging to Latter-day 
Saints, but that saloons were there. 
Since that time, several of our peo- 
ple have permitted their names to 
be stricken from the records of the 
Church because of engaging in that 
business. We propose to follow 
that up, and all who will not live 
according to the rules of the 
Church, in this regard, we propose 
to take their names off of the 
Church records. Brethren and 
sisters, I feel encouraged in this 
work, because I know it is the work 
of God, and not of man. In and of 
myself I feel very weak, but 
I "know that this work is the 
Lord's, and I am desirous of 
living up to every principle that the 
Lord has revealed, doing His will, 
keeping His commandments, and 
teaching others to do so. God bless 
you, in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER JOSEPH E. ROBINSON. 

(President of California Mission.) 

As I remember reading the sacred 
scriptures, there was an husband- 



man who invited all of his friends 
and kindred to a marriage feast. 
When the hour came for the meal 
to be served, he found none of them 
in attendance. Then he sent his 
servants out upon the byways and 
highways to constrain every man 
that passed by to come in to the 
wedding supper. I think, from the 
presence of this great crowd, that 
we are living in an age when the 
Gospel invitation to come to the 
marriage supper of the Lamb has 
been heard, and answered, by many 
friends and kindred, and also by 
many who are strangers to the 
cause. 

I rejoice in the work that the 
Latter-day Saints are performing in 
the world. I rejoice that many of 
the honorable of the earth are be- 
ginning to comprehend the fact that 
the Church of Jesus Christ of Lat- 
ter-day Saints is potent for good; 
that it is a power in the land; that 
in the genius of the Gospel there is 
life, durability, and stability. Many 
who have not been able to find sat- 
isfaction in any 'one of the creeds of 
the various churches, or in the dog- 
mas of science, are beginning to 
comprehend this fact, that in the 
Gospel, which is preached by the 
Latter-day Saints, there is that 
which appeals to the heart and mind 
of man ; there is something enno- 
bling in it, something uplifting and 
progressive; it has come to remain 
in the land. They feel a little of 
that which Apostle Clawson por- 
trayed this morning in his address, 
when he told of the files, ranks, col- 
umns and battalions of the Priest- 
hood, that such a force is irresisti- 
ble; and the Gospel they preach 
must obtain. I have found, in my 
experience, some of the better class, 
many of the enlightened men of 
our state (California) — among the 



ELDER JOSEPH E. ROBINSON. 



75 



bankers, the railroad men, the doc- 
tors, and the laywers, many who 
have their eyes upon the economi- 
cal aspect of Mormonism, and be- 
cause of this, have accorded to me 
and my brethren, many privileges 
that otherwise would not have been 
ours. We feel, in a measure, that we 
are a preferred class among these 
men, having been invited to their 
clubs,given transportation over their 
lines, participated with them in some 
of their political and civic move- 
ments. This, I take it, not as a com- 
pliment to me or my brethren, but 
to the great body of the Latter-day 
Saints whose representatives we 
are. 

Just at this time there is a fer- 
ment of expectation upon the part 
of the people of the Coast in rela- 
tion to the arrival of the great 
American fleet, and with that there 
is an undercurrent of feeling of un- 
rest in relation to conditions as they 
obtain in the Far East. You know, 
perhaps, that' we have had some lit- 
tle trouble — so-called trouble — with 
the Japanese in our schools ; and 
there are those who are so pessim- 
istic as to prophesy that, within two 
years from now,the City of Los An- 
geles and most of the coast towns of 
California will be patrolled by Jap- 
anese soldiers. This statement was 
made five weeks ago today, over the 
signature of one of the generals of 
the United States Army, who has 
been for the past five years in China, 
seeking the regeneration of the 
great Chinese Army. He gives his 
reasons for it, and I must confess 
that it appeals to me that such a 
thing might be possible under the 
conditions that he tells us of. "The 
proximity of the Philippines, of 
Hawaii, and of Alaska to the Flow- 
ery Kingdom, and the fact that they 
are preparing, no matter what the 



press says to the contrary, for 
something in the immediate future," 
is what he states. 

But I have a hope, I have an as- 
surance in the words which God 
hath spoken, that this is a land of 
liberty, and that He will fight the 
battles of the peoples of this land. 
I remember what He said to one 
of the ancient prophets of this land, 
and I ask you to indulge me while 
I refer to it briefly. He is speak- 
ing of the day when Christ's Gospel 
shall again be taught among the 
children of men, and when the Jews 
will begin to believe upon His 
name. I was very much impressed 
yesterday by the prayer offered by 
Patriarch Joseph E. Taylor, pray- 
ing for this people, the Hebrews. I 
have had the privilege of preaching 
the Gospel to some few of them. I 
associate almost daily with one who 
has the blood of that people in his 
veins, who is an able expounder and 
defender of the Gospel of the Lord 
Jesus Christ. We have had the 
privilege of baptizing a young man 
of that blood. Here is what the 
Lord says : 

"Behold, thus saith the Lord God: 
When the day cometh that they shall be- 
lieve in me, that I am Christ, then have 
I covenanted with their fathers that they 
shall be restored in the flesh, upon the 
earth, unto the lands of their inheritance. 

"And it shall come to pass that they 
shall be gathered in from their long dis- 
persion; f"im the isles of the sea, and 
from the four parts of the earth; and 
the nations of the Gentiles shall be 
great in the eyes of me, saith God, in 
carrying them forth to the lands of their 
inheritance. 

"Yea,^ the kings of the Gentiles shall 
be nursing fathers unto them, and their 
queens shall become nursing mothers ; 
wherefore, the promises of the Lord are 
great unto _ the Gentiles, for he hath 
spoken it, and who can dispute?" 

In California there are two He- 



76 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



brew leaders of reform, who point 
with considerable pride to the fact 
that Jesus Christ was a Jew, who 
are looking forth to the time "when 
Christianity and Judaism shall be 
one, and when righteousness will 
cover the earth as the waters cover 
the- mighty deep." Some of the 
kings of the earth have made solici- 
tation of the Sultan of Turkey to 
permit the Hebrews to buy Pales- 
tine, and fix themselves again in the 
land of their fathers. The hearts of 
the Jews, as you know, are turned 
to that land, and conditions have 
been turned backward in a way, and 
they are coming into their own ; for 
they begin to believe in part in the 
ministry of Jesus Christ. Further- 
more, in the day when this shall ob- 
tain, the Lord tells us of these 
things : 

"But, behold, this land, saith God, shall 
be a land of thine inheritance, [speaking 
to the people of Nephi], and the Gentiles 
shall be blessed upon the land. 

"And this land shall be a land of lib- 
erty unto the Gentiles, and there shall be 
no kings upon the land who shall raise 
up unto the Gentiles." 

Why, men may say when this 
book came forth, in 1829, that John 
VI of Portugal had seated on the 
throne of Brazil his eldest son, Pe- 
dro. I grant you that, and therein I 
find a greater testimony of the 
truthfulness of what the prophet 
has here written, for he was not 
raised up from among the Gentiles 
of this land, but was brought from 
abroad. But we want to go further 
in the case, and see what became of 
him. 

"And I will fortify this land against all 
other nations ; 

"And he that fighteth against Zion 
shall perish, saith God; 

"For he that raiseth up a king against 
me shall perish, for I, the Lord, the 



King of heaven, will be their King, and 
I will be a light unto them for ever, 
that hear my words." 

This man, Dom Pedro I, was suc- 
ceeded by Dom Pedro II, but, with- 
in my recollection, he had to abdi- 
cate his throne. Brazil was made 
a republic, and he returned to the 
fatherland, Portugal. Within the 
recollection of all of you, within 
the past few weeks, there has been 
the assassination of the King of 
Portugal, and of the Crown Prince, 
who were the descendants of John 
VI and his daughter Dona Maria, 
whom he set up to preside over that 
land (Portugal). The fate of that 
country today is trembling in the 
balance. A usurper is trying to un- 
dermine the throne, and conditions 
are very unsatisfactory to say the 
least, at this very day and hour. 

But more signally, perhaps, this 
prophecy was fulfilled in 1865-6, 
when Napoleon III sent one of his 
favorites, Maximillian, and "raised 
him up" to the people of this land, 
the Lamanites, as a king. It was 
while the North and the South were 
divided, in war and civil strife, that 
this thing was done. And the old 
world powers, England, France and 
Spain, thought that they could ob- 
tain from Mexico some of their 
claims, whilst the Federal Govern- 
ment of the United States had its 
hands full, and could do nothing to 
put into effect the so-called Monroe 
Doctrine. The Federal government 
protested, and Russia, in a compact 
made with that government, sent to 
New York harbor all of her battle- 
ships, which were to be turned over, 
in case of need, to the government 
of the United States. England 
withdrew her 10,000 troops, and so 
did Spain, but Napoleon was per- 
verse for some time, and established 



ELDER BEN E. RICH. 



77 



this man as the Emperor of Mexico. 
Under the leadership of Juarez, the 
father of that country, and Diaz, the 
present President, the people were 
called to arms. Maxim'illian's forces 
were overcome and he was cast into 
prison. His lovely and devoted 
wife, Carlotta, went to the various 
Courts of Europe and plead for 
succor for her husband in this land 
of Mexico. When petitioning at the 
feet of the Pontiff of Rome, she 
went mad, and was consigned to a 
mad-house, and to this day does not 
know the sad fate of her husband, 
who was shot to death by the sol- 
diery of Juarez. So this king, who 
was raised up like John of Portugal 
and his son, (John, you remember, 
died very soon after returning to 
Portugal, worn out with the trou- 
bles he had encountered in Mexico) 
and so Maximillian met his death; 
and he was the last of his line. Na- 
poleon III, who had "set him up," 
was forced to flee to England, an 
exile from his country, with his 
empress and young prince, "Na- 
poleon Bonaparte. This prince, 
who afterwards enlisted in the 
British service in South Africa, dur- 
ing the Zulu war, was ambushed, 
and killed by the Zulus, thus bring- 
ing an end to the house of Napoleon 
III. 

How signally has the Lord 
brought out the forces of this coun- 
try victorious against overwhelm- 
ing numbers and older countries. As 
an earnest of what the future will 
be, this tells me that we need not 
fear foreign oppression or foreign 
arm's. God hath established here 
the tree of Liberty, in this land of 
Joseph, that the nations of the earth 
might find shelter under its 
branches and eat of its fruit; for 
this is the land where God shall 
build His city, the New Jerusalem. 



This is the land from whence shall 
go forth the law of the Lord. From 
this land shall go forth His word 
by His ministers and ambassadors ; 
"and the power and the dominion 
and the greatness of his kingdom," 
says Daniel the Prophet, "shall be 
given to the people of the Saints of 
the Most High God," with whom 
our interests are identified. He has 
said, "I will fight the battles of the 
Gentiles of this land. I will fight 
the battles of this nation." So, you 
and I who have faith in this word, 
who have the precious pearl of 
great price in our possession, have 
no doubts, or misgivings, or per- 
plexities in relation to what the fu- 
ture has in store for this land of 
Joseph. 

God bless you, my brethren and 
sisters, and enable you to do what 
is right, to maintain that which is 
true and just to all men, that the 
promises made to our fathers shall 
not fall to the ground, but that we 
may inherit all the glories that shall 
come to the people of God and to 
the people of this nation, is my 
prayer in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn, "Praise to the man who 
communed with Tehovah !" 

ELDER BEN E. RICH. 

(President of Southern States 
Mission). 

When the prayer was offered 
opening this meeting, I was re- 
minded of a little pamphlet that I 
had in my pocket, which bears a 
portrait of the Prophet Joseph 
Smith, with some of his words ut- 
tered concerning his beloved broth- 
er, Hyrum Smith. And it also con- 
tains a picture of the Patriarch Hy- 
rum Smith, with his sons, Joseph 



78 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



F. and John, each side of him. I 
want to speak to you concerning 
the words of the Prophet Joseph 
in relation to his brother Hyrum, 
and also what the God of Israel said 
concerning that beloved brother of 
the Prophet. The words of the 
Prophet Joseph were as follows : 
"Brother Hyrum, what a faith- 
ful heart you have got! Oh, may 
the Eternal Jehovah crown eternal 
blessings upon your head, as a re- 
ward for the care you have had 
for my soul ! Oh, how many are 
the sorrows we have shared togeth- 
er! and again We find ourselves 
shackled by the unrelenting hand of 
oppression. Hyrum, thy name 
shall be written in the book of the 
Law of the Lord, for those who 
come after to look upon that they 
may pattern after thy works." 
This was uttered August n, 1842, 
while he was in the hands of his 
enemies. 

I read from a revelation of the 
Lord to the Prophet Joseph Smith- 
given Jan. 19, 1841, the following, 
concerning Hyrum Smith, the Pat- 
riarch, "And from this time forth I 
appoint unto him that he may be a 
prophet, and a seer, and a revela- 
tor unto my Church, as well as my 
servant Joseph. . . .That my ser- 
vant Hyrum may bear record of 
the things which I shall show un- 
to him, that his name may be had 
in honorable remembrance from 
generation to generation, for ever 
and ever." 

I was reminded of this little 
pamphlet, containing these words, 
when a grandson of Hyrum Smith 
opened this meeting with prayer. 
I was impresed more when I re- 
member that this grandson stands, 
with two others, at the head of the 
Aaronic Priesthood upon the earth, 
he being one of the members of the 
Presiding Bishopric of this Church. 



In the Tabernacle today you will 
find two of Hyrum Smiths sons: 
one the Prophet, Seer and Revela- 
tor, and President of the Church in 
all the world, and the other oc- 
cupying the same position that Hy- 
rum did when he was assassinated 
in Carthage jail, Patriarch of the 
whole Church. Thus the name of 
Hyrum Smith is remembered to- 
day, by these children, this grand- 
child, another grand child in the 
quorum of the Twelve Apostles, 
another as Assistant Historian of 
the Church, and by others faithful, 
true, clean as any men or women 
in the Church. They have main- 
tained, by their faithfulness, in 
honorable remembrance the name 
of Hyrum Smith down to this gen- 
eration, and will continue to hold 
him in honorable remembrance 
throughout all generations. 

There has not been a day since 
the organization of the Church that 
his Satanic Majesty has not en- 
deavored to get between the people 
of God and the man who stands at 
the head of the Church. It was 
true in the days of Joseph Smith; 
and true in the days of Brigham 
Young, John Taylor, Wilford 
Woodruff, and Lorenzo Snow, and 
it is true today. If he can succeed 
in getting between these people and 
the one whom God has placed at 
the head of the Church, he" wins 
a victory over the hearts of the 
people, to a certain extent. The 
spirit of the Nauvoo Expositor was 
not more malignant in the days of 
Nauvoo than is manifest at the 
present time. All the fiery darts of 
the wicked are directed today, as 
they have been from the year 1830 
to the present time, against the 
head of the Church. The devil 
has always inspired men to believe 
that, if they could destroy the man 
who stands at the head, they could 



ELDER BEN E. RICH. 



79 



destroy the Church. How foolish! 
If they should succeed, which I do 
not believe they will. — If they 
should succeed, what would hap- 
pen? Just what has happened upon 
the death of every former Presi- 
dent of the Church. The Twelve 
Apostles, with their chief, would 
stand up as leaders of Israel, and 
the work would go on; because it 
is not built upon man. The enemies 
of this Church do not care for man, 
they do not care any more for Jos- 
eph F. Smith than they care for 
any one of you. You exchange 
places with him, if it should be 
the will of God, and no more fiery 
darts of the wicked would be di- 
rected toward Joseph F. Smith; 
they would be pointed toward you- 
and he would be forgotten. Thaf 
has always been the case. This 
work is built upon that rock men- 
tioned by Jesus when He was talk- 
ing to Peter, and asking him whom 
men said that He was. When He 
asked Peter who He was, and 
Peter answered that He was 
Christ, the Son of the Living God, 
Jesus said, "Blessed art thou, 
Simon Barjona, flesh and blood has 
not revealed this unto you, but 
my Father, which is in heaven." 
He also said, upon that rock — 
the source of information that 
gave to Peter the knowledge that 
Jesus was the Christ — He would 
build His church, and the gates 
of hell should not prevail against 
it: and they did not. The wicked- 
ness placed by the devil in the 
hearts of mankind at that time 
caused them to believe if they 
could destroy the head of the 
Church they would destroy the 
work, and they took the Master, 
the head of the Church, and nailed 
Him upon a cross and crucified 
Him, and laid His body in the tomb. 
Then Christ, while His body lay 



in the tomb, was quickened by the 
Spirit, and He broke down the 
gates of hell, showing that they 
could not prevail against Him. He 
then went into hell and preached 
the Gospel to those who had been 
swept off the face of the earth in 
the days of Noah. 

We are engaged in preaching 
the Gospel of Christ. It has come 
to the earth, this time, with the 
promise that it will stay forever, 
never more to be thrown down,never 
stopped. It will continue to grow, 
and increase until it fills this whole 
earth with the righteousness of 
God, in fulfillment of prophecy. As 
the missionaries go throughout the 
world, it is their duty, their busi- 
ness, to search out the children of 
Joseph, the blood of Ephraim and 
Manasseh, and bring them to the 
land of Zion. In God's own due 
time, His spirit will move upon 
Judah, and they will go to the land 
of their fathers, and Ephraim and 
Joseph will conle unto the land 
given to them, and then Zion will 
become the great capital city of our 
God, and Judah will rebuild Jeru- 
salem. Then as Brother Robinson 
quoted, "The law shall go forth 
from Zion, and the word of the 
Lord from Jerusalem ;" and the 
time will come when the seed of 
Joseph will meet their brethren of 
Judah, and the peace of God will 
reign over the great capitals that 
He is going to found upon this 
earth; but in accomplishing this, 
there are many things to contend 
with. God gives an assurance that 
we will be successful if we will be 
patient. He has told us that it is 
our business to forgive all man- 
kind. He has told us that He is the 
Judge, and we must remember 
that. 

I was reminded of a statement 



80 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



made the other evening by one of 
my brethren about Paul, when he 
was known as Saul. When he was 
a persecutor of the Saints, on the 
road to Damascus, having willing- 
ly held the clothes of those who 
stoned one of the martyrs to 
death, (I suppose he had a look 
of contempt upon his face when 
he heard that missionary, with his 
dying words bear testimony that 
he saw the heavens opened, that 
he saw God, and Jesus standing 
upon His right hand), he was filled 
with hatred, this man Saul, and de- 
termined to punish every man who 
would bear testimony that the 
Nazarine was in reality the Son of 
the living God. When he was on 
the road to Damascus, to execute 
his designs, to serve the papers he 
had in his possession, he saw a 
great light and was stricken blind. 
He heard a voice, and the voice 
said, "Saul, Saul, why persecutest 
thou me?" Then the question, 
"Who art thou, Lord?" And the 
voice answered : "I am Jesus whom 
thou persecutest." Then he real- 
ized what he had done. Although 
he was a persecutor of the Saints, 
he was a choice spirit, and the time 
came when his eyes were opened; 
when he was converted to the Gos- 
pel. He was led blind, until an 
humble missionary came to teach 
him the way of salvation, the Gos- 
pel of Jesus Christ. 

I tell you, my brethren and sis- 
ters, he is not the only Saul that has 
lived upon the earth. It has been 
my privilege to meet a man who 
was the leader of a mob, who at- 
tempted with hatred and violence 
in his heart, to get at our elders, 
and, by streaks of lightning from 
the heavens, three different times 
he and his companions were driv- 
en back, then the horses of the 
mob took the bits in their mouths, 



the riders lost control, and the an- 
imals fled with the mob away from 
the servants of God. It was my 
privilege, two years ago, to lay my 
hands upon the head of the man 
who was the leader of that mob, 
and bestow upon him the holy Mel- 
chisedek Priesthood, and send 
him out to preach the Gospel, as 
Saul of old was sent out. It teach- 
es the lesson of patience to us. We 
can afford to leave all mankind in 
the hands of God. But we cannot 
afford, my brethren and sisters, not 
to keep the commandments of God, 
and not follow the revelations that 
God the Eternal Father has given 
us. 

I wish to call your attention to 
the work that a woman can do in 
this Church ; I refer to Mary Field- 
ing. In England, many years ago 
her father was a minister, an hon- 
orable man, who did not believe it 
was right to preach for hire and 
divine for money. He sent two of 
his children, Joseph and Mary to 
America. They landed in Canada. 
The Spirit of God led them into a 
little company of people, of whom 
John Taylor was a member, and 
they were praying for light, asking 
God for the truth. A Mormon 
missionary, Parley P. Pratt, also led 
by the Spirit of God, just as that 
Spirit took the missionary to Saul, 
taught tjiat company the Gpspel 
that had been restored to the earth, 
and brought many of them into the 
Church, among others John Tay- 
lor, Joseph and Mary Fielding. 
She afterwards became the wife 
of Hyrum Smith, the mother of 
Joseph F. Smith. Our President 
was born at a time when Hyrum 
Smith, his father, was dragged by 
his enemies away from the side of 
his wife, when she most needed his 
care and attention. Under those 
circumstances the present Presi- 



SISTER RACHEL H. LEATHAM.

dent of this Church was born in 
the world. After the death of Jos- 
eph and Hyrum, the martyrs, she 
maintained allegiance to the man 
who then stood at the head of the 
Church. She was found trailing 
across the deserts, her boy, nine 
years of age, driving an ox team ; 
thus manifesting her abiding faith 
in the man who stood at the head 
of the Church. She also took the 
other children of her husband, by 
hte deceased wife, and nurtured 
faith in their hearts. She went 
through all the trials that the oth- 
er pioneers went through, and was 
always faithful with her tithes and 
offerings. This woman planted the 
faith of the Gospel so deep in the 
hearts of her children that all hell 
has not been able to root it out of 
a single one of them. Through the 
faithfulness of that woman, her 
children and grandchildren stand 
where they do today. 

There is a lesson in this of the 
responsibility that rests upon 
mothers. Take it to yourselves; 
look after your children. 

Do not let the devil get between 
you and the man who stands at the 
head of the Church, no matter who 
that man is. God bless you. Amen.

SISTER RACHEL H. LEATHAM. 

My brothers and sisters : Some 
of you, I know, will appreciate my 
feelings as I stand before you. I 
think that I am one of the happiest 
girls in all the world, and it is the 
Gospel that makes me feel this way, 
for I do know that the Gospel is 
true. I do know that God our Fath- 
er, and His Son, Jesus Christ, came 



down and brought the Gospel and 
established it, and spoke to the 
Prophet Joseph Smith. I know that 
Jesus is the Christ, and that Joseph 
Smith is His Prophet. I feel that 
if I could live forever, I could never 
thank my heavenly Father enough 
for the blessings that have come 
into my life, for the privilege of go- 
ing out into the world and bearing 
this testimony, telling them of the 
Gospel being restored, of the au- 
thority Christ has given to His ser- 
vants, and of the blessings that are 
in store for those who listen to and 
obey the words of truth, life and 
salvation, as they fall from the lips 
of the servants of God who are sent 
out to preach the Gospel. 

I sometimes think that we young 
folks at home do not fully realize 
the responsibilities that rest upon 
us. We do not always remember 
that those who stand at our head are 
aged, and that when our fathers and 
mothers are gone it will devolve up- 
on us to assume their work ; that we 
are the future responsible people of 
Zion. Are we doing our part, and 
are we preparing ourselves so that 
we will be able to do the work that 
our fathers have done? Are we 
ordering our lives so that the Spirit 
of God will dwell with us as it has 
dwelt with our parents ? Do we re- 
alize the extent of the blessings that 
God has given us, and do we un- 
derstand the words of life and sal- 
vation contained in the Scriptures 
and in the Doctrine and Covenants ? 
Are we able to tell what the prom- 
ises are that God has made us, if we 
will keep His commandments? Are 
we familiar with the ancient rec- 
ord of the inhabitants of this con- 
tinent, the Book of Mormon ? And 
are we familiar with the great 
truths that are taught therein, and 
with those books that teach us the

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



beauties of the work in which we 
are engaged today ? I am afraid we 
are not sufficiently conversant with 
the principles of the Gospel, and 
that we are not as diligent as we 
should be. 

Where much is given, much is re- 
required ; and you know, every one 
of you, how much has been given 
to us, and how much will be requir- 
ed at our hands. Are we prepar- 
ing ourselves so that we will not 
fall short? Let us live by every 
word that proceeds out of the 
mouth of God. Let us live so that 
He will ever be willing to own us, 
and bless us, and love us. 

I do not desire to speak longer, 
but I want once more to bear my 
testimony. I want to say again 
that I know the Gospel is true. Not 
because my father knows it, not 
because my mother has always 
taught it to me, but I know that the 
Gospel is true because God has re- 
vealed it unto me. His Spirit has 
borne witness unto my spirit, and 
that testimony is God's most pre- 
cious gift to me. 

May God bless us all, I ask in 
the name of Jesus. Amen. 

SISTER M. M. LANGENBUCHER. 

My brothers and sisters : One of 
my greatest privileges is bearing 
my testimony. I can say that I know 
the Gospel is true, and I love it. 
There is nothing in life that has 
given me so much joy as going on 
a mission and bearing my testimony 
unto the people of the world. They 
ridicule us, but we know it is true, 
and we do not feel at all hurt for 
what they say. 

I greatly appreciate the privilege 
that we have of meeting together in 
these Conferences. We do not have 



this privilege out in the world, and 
we never see so many Saints gath- 
ered together as there are here. 
How happy we all ought to be in 
coming and receiving words of in- 
struction from those who are placed 
in authority. If we are humble and 
prayerful, we can accomplish a 
great deal of good in this world. 

We are set upon a hill to be a 
light unto the world, and our ac- 
tions are watched every day. Out 
in the mission field, the Elders are 
watched as they walk the streets, 
and all their words and actions are 
closely observed. 

I sincerely trust that the Spirit 
of our Heavenly Father may abide 
with us during the rest of our Con- 
ference ; and that we may enjoy 
ourselves while receiving instruc- 
tions that will be for .our eternal 
benefit. 

I have never had more blessings 
visited upon me than I did while in 
the City of Denver, going from 
house to house and bearing my tes- 
timony. 

I pray that the Spirit of God may 
be with us, that we may be a light 
to the world, that those who see our 
good works may glorify our Father 
which is in heaven. May this be 
our happy lot, is my prayer in th< 
name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

Prof. Charles Kent sang, by re- 
quest, as a solo, the hymn, "Kind 
words are sweet tones of the heart." 

EIDER JAMES G DUFFIN. 

I feel grateful for the privilege, 
my brethren and sisters, of meet- 
ing with you in this great confer- 
ence, and of partaking of the spirit- 
ual feast that has been spread be- 
for us. I am reminded of a few 



ELDER JAMES G. DUFFIN.

words, containing a prophecy, 
that were given by the Prophet 
Joseph Smith, on the 6th day of 
August, 1842, while standing with 
a number of his brethren in front 
of the Masonic Hall, in the town of 
Montrose, Iowa. 

"I prophesied that the Saints would 
continue to suffer much affliction, and 
would be driven to the Rocky Moun- 
tains, many would apostatize, others 
would be p it to death by our persecutors 
or lose their lives in consequence of ex- 
posure or disease, and some of you will 
live to go and assist in making settle- 
ments and build cities, and see the Saints 
become a mighty people in the midst of 
the Rocky Mountains." 

A few thoughts concerning these 
words have passed through my 
mind while my brethren have been 
speaking. It is a fact that our 
people did suffer persecution after 
these words were uttered. It is a 
fact that they were driven from 
their homes in that land where they 
had established themselves. It is 
a fact that they went out upon the 
great plains. It is a truth also that 
many of them endured great priva- 
tions, and many of them laid their 
weary and worn out bodies in the 
silent grave along the pathway of 
that great exodus from the Miss- 
issippi River to these mountain 
vales. 

Now, my brethren and sisters, 
particularly I would speak to those 
of our boys and girls who are here 
today, your fathers and your mo- 
thers blazed the way. They came 
to these mountain vales, and they 
established themselves here un- 
der the direction of men of God. 
They devoted their lives to fulfil 
the words of God the Eternal 
Father, as given through His ser- 
vant, Joseph the Prophet, and it is 
as a result of their labors, of their 



privations, of their integrity to the 
truth, to the work that God had 
established upon this earth, that 
you and I are here today, and en- 
joying the blessings of these 
mountain vales. Now there are 
those who, when these words were 
spoken, looked upon this western 
country as "The Great American 
Desert." Statesmen made the as- 
sertion that it was absolutely worth- 
less so far as commercial value 
was concerned. The great states- 
men of the day — one of them in 
particular, when discussing the op- 
ening up of a great highway to the 
west — speaking of this great west- 
ern country, of which there was lit- 
tle known at that time, said, "It 
is worthless. I would not give a 
$5 bill for the whole country.*' 
Notwithstanding this, the Prophet 
of God said that fhis people, God's 
people, should come to this western 
country to be established in these 
mountain vales. There they should 
build cities, towns, villages, and be- 
come a mlighty people. It is not 
land that makes a state, but it is 
men, men of integrity, men of hon- 
or, men of truth, men who love 
liberty, that make a state ; but lands 
and country are adjuncts to a peo- 
ple, and in order that they might be- 
come a great and a mighty peo- 
ple, they must have lands and oth- 
er properties as well. 

Now for a moment or two, I 
want to talk to you upon the tem- 
poral side of the Gospel of the Lord 
Jesus Christ. My brethren, my 
friends here, President Rich, Presi- 
dent Robinson and others, their 
special work is to direct the ener- 
gies of our boys who are out among 
the nations of the earth declaring 
the words of eternal life. I have 
had that great privilege also, but I 
have been released from that labor, 



84 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



and my mind and my energies are 
directed more particularly toward 
the temporal affairs of the kingdom 
of God at the present time. I see 
undesirable conditions in our midst 
concerning these wonderful lands 
that have been subdued by our 
fathers and our mothers: I see a 
condition arising in our midst that 
if we do not meet it, many people, 
thousands who now possess these 
productive lands, the possibilities 
of which are yet little understood 
even by us who have spent our lives 
here, are going to allow what they 
now hold to pass out of their hands. 
Now, I am not going to say a word 
against any man or set of men who 
come into our midst, who see the 
possibilities of this land that has 
been subdued by our fathers, and 
come to us and tempt us to part 
with our possessions for a handful 
of gold. They have been in other 
countries, and they understand the 
value of lands such as we are in 
possession of. They come here in- 
to our midst and see what we have. 
They come to us and say, "You 
have been holding your land at 
probably a hundred, or a hundred 
and fifty, or two hundred dollars 
an acre, some of your best lands, 
and I want to get hold of a piece 
that you are in possession of. I 
will give you three hundred dol- 
lars an acre, double what you have 
been valuing it at." And what do 
we do? We cannot resist the 
temptation to sell our possessions, 
and we part with them, and they 
go out of our hands. Some of our 
older brethren, notwithstanding the 
fact that their pood wives have al- 
most worn their lives out in as- 
sisting them to make a home, sell 
that good comfortable home, and 
are going out again and attempt- 
ing to subdue arid wastes. Now, 
I say I do not blame, neither have 



I a word to say against a person 
who, seeing these beautiful posses- 
sions of ours, has a desire in his 
heart to obtain them by honorable 
purchase, but the thought that is 
in my mind is thus: Is it justice, 
you husbands, to these dear wives 
of yours, to sell the homes that you 
have spent so many years in mak- 
ing, and taking that dear wife out 
again upon the arid waste, and 
wear her life out there, without her 
enjoying the comforts and blessings 
you had mutually labored so many 
years to collect around you? And 
is it justice to your posterity to set 
an example of that kind before 
them ? 

This was one thought that was in 
my mind.; Now another in con- 
nection with this prophecy. Jos- 
eph said that in the midst of these 
mountains, the Saints should be- 
come a mighty people. No people 
ever became mighty who would 
part with their possessions for a 
handful of gold. It is the people 
who get possession of the soil, and 
retain it who stay, and build from 
that foundation, who become 
mighty. I want to call your at- 
tention to a remark that was made 
by a son of Heber C. Kimball, some 
years ago, in speaking at a confer- 
ence in this great Tabernacle, he 
said : "If you Latter-day Saints 
would but put yourselves in a posi- 
tion to fulfil prophecy, after it had 
been made by the servants of God, 
they- would not be so afraid to- 
prophesy !" The Prophet of God, 
speaking by the light of heaven 
said that the Saints should become 
a mighty peoole in the midst of 
these Rocky Mountains. I hold it 
as a true principle that, when 
servants of God are moved by the 
spirit of our Father in heaven to 
prophesy, it is the duty of this peo- 
ple to do all that lies in their power 



ELDER JAMES G. DUFFIN. 



85 



to fulfil that prophecy. It is your 
duty, young men, you gray heads, 
mothers and daughters in Israel, 
and my duty, to do all that lies in 
our power to see that the word of 
the Prophet of God is made true, 
that we do not rest satisfied with 
the conditions we are under today, 
but that every movement of our 
lives shall be to glorify Zion, and 
build up the kingdom of God upon 
earth. 

There is another thought in my 
mind in connection with this sub- 
ject. The enemies of eternal truth, 
as has been remarked here today 
by one of the speakers, always di- 
rect their darts against the man 
who stands at the head of the work 
of God. Why? Because, if they 
could destroy the confidence of the 
people in that man, they destroy 
the confidence of the people in the 
work of God ; for he is the one 
who holds the keys of eternal 
Priesthood. I will read to you a 
portion of the word of the Lord to 
the Prophet Joseph Smith, while he 
was lying in Liberty Jail, Clay 
County, Missouri. "The ends of the 
earth shall enquire after thy name, 
and fools shall have thee in den- 
sion, and hell shall rage against 
thee, whil<! the pure in heart, and 
the wise, and the noble, and the 
virtuous, shall seek counsel, and 
authority, and blessings constantly 
from under thy hand." Now there is 
a thought in- connection with this. 
Who are they my brethren and 
sisters, that you see raising their 
forces against the mian who holds 
the keys of the everlasting Priest- 
hood? Did you ever hear a man 
who was clean, who was pure, who 
was seeking every day of his life 
to do what was for the good of 
humanity, for the establishment of 
truth and of righteousness upon 
this earth— did you ever hear of a 



man of this kind lifting his voice 
against that man who holds the 
keys of the Holy Priesthood ? Now, 
think for one moment, young men 
of Israel, if you have never heard 
a man of that character lift his 
voice against the head of the Church, 
who are the men who do that? 
Then consider, if you are ever 
tempted by a man, or by any set or 
combination of men, to raise your 
voice against God's servants, con- 
sider where they are likely to lead 
you if you accede to them. You 
had best beware how you listen to 
the tempter, because he will come 
to you. 

Fathers and mothers, young men 
and daughters of Israel, remember 
that when the Lord speaks He 
sees that it is fulfilled. He pro- 
vided the way for the fulfillment 
of His words through the Prophet 
Joseph, when he spoke to that lit- 
tle company of his brethren in front 
of the Masonic Temple, in Mont- 
rose. His people came here. They 
have grown. They have continued 
to grow, and it is your duty and 
mine to see that those words re- 
ceive a greater fulfillment, not only 
in a temporal way, but see to it 
that we are true and faithful unto 
the authority that God has placed 
here upon this earth. 

God bless you forever. Amen. 

The male chorus sang the an- 
them, "Nearer to Thee." 

Benediction was pronounced by 
Elder William Langton.

ELDER ORSON F. WHITNEY. 

The Gospel of Salvation. — A ladder to 
eternal life. — Joseph Smith's author- 
ity. — The mighty problem of Mormon- 
ism. — Redemption of the living and 
the dead. — The Latter-day Saints the 
friends of humanity. 

Two ministers of the Christian 
church were once conversing to- 
gether, and one of them asked the 
other this question : 

"Why is it, my friend, that the 
people love to hear you preach, and 
why is it that they do not love to 
hear me? Why is your chapel al- 
ways crowded with eager worship- 
ers, while mine is always nearly 
empty?" His friend answered him 
in these words : 

"I believe it is because I am al- 
ways telling the people that if they 
will pursue a certain course they 
shall be saved, while you are always 
telling them that if they don't do 
certain things they'll be damned." 

I gather from this that there is 
something in the human heart that 
prefers the affirmative to the nega- 
tive in the presentation of the Gos- 
pel message. I have always re- 
joiced in the fact that the Gospel of 
Jesus Christ is the Gospel of Salva- 
tion. Paul the Apostle, declares it 
to be so : 

"I am not ashamed of the Gospel of 
Christ, for it is the power of God unto 
salvation, to every one that believeth." 

While it is true that the Savior, 
when He commissioned His apos- 



tles to preach the Gospel, used these 
words : "He that believeth and is 
baptized shall be saved, and he that 
believeth not shall be damned," — ■ 
there is nothing in this to indicate 
that the Gospel is a Gospel of dam- 
nation. Damnation is no part of the 
Gospel of Christ. There is no dam- 
nation in it, but there is plenty of 
damnation outside of it. When the 
end comes, and Christ's mission is 
consummated, it will be found that 
He has exhausted every means for 
the salvation of man ; and those 
who stand condemned after the Gos- 
pel has done its work, will be found 
to have condemned themselves. God 
is bent upon saving, not damning, 
the human race ; and He will use 
every possible means to that end. 
He will send His servants with the 
voice of persuasion, the voice of 
solemn warning, and will fashion, 
shape, mold and manipulate all 
things for the spread of truth — the 
message of salvation. And then, as 
He has said : 

"After your testimonies come the tes- 
timonies of earthquakes, the voice of 
thunderings, the voice of the waves of 
the sea,heaving itself beyond its bounds." 

"All things shall be in commotion." 

"And not only the earth shall shake, 
but the starry heavens shall tremble." 

These powers will be put forth 
for salvation — not for damnation. 
Condemnation follows, as the night 
the day, the rejection of the means 
of salvation ; it is the alternative, the 
inevitable consequence of a refusal 
to accept and make use of the re- 
demption that God has provided. 
Let me use an illustration : 

Suppose a man to have fallen into 
a pit, and to be unable to scale the 
sides thereof, and emerge upon the 
plane above. He has intelligence, 
strength, wisdom, perhaps skill as a 



ELDER ORSON F. WHITNEY. 



87 



climber, but he cannot climb, be- 
cause there is nothing to climb with 
or by. A friend comes to the mouth 
of the- pit, hails him, and says : 

"I will help you ; you cannot use 
your own powers, thev are ineffec- 
tual. I will give you the means of 
putting them to their proper use." 
He lets clown a ladder, and says to 
the man below, "Now, climb." 

Suppose the man refuses to climb. 
Who is responsible for his failure 
to emerge from the pit into which 
he has fallen? Is he not worse off, 
by rejecting the means of escape, 
than if it had never been offered to 
him? He can do nothing for him- 
self, and when assistance is ten- 
dered, he rejects it. Who is to 
blame ? 

That is the light in which the 
problem presents itself to me. By 
the transgression of our first par- 
ents, the human race fell into a pit, 
and there was no help, and no hope, 
this side of heaven, for the race 
could not redeem itself. Man can- 
not be honest enough, nor virtuous 
enough, nor truthful enough, nor 
benevolent enough, to save his soul. 
That is why the Gospel was pro- 
vided, as a means of salvation, and 
it had to come from above. No 
part of that which was under con- 
demnation could be used as the 
means of redemption. Adam and 
Eve, with their posterity, were un- 
der the curse, and it was the curse 
of eternal death, — death spiritual, 
death temporal, — never-ending ban- 
ishment from the presence of God. 

But the Son of God came down 
from the Courts of Glory, and of- 
fered Himself as a sacrifice, a ran- 
som. He was not under the curse ; 
He had not fallen; and His life 
could pay the debt. It could be 
used as the means of the world's re- 
demption; and it was so used, and 



thus He became the Author of life 
and salvation to us all. He was the 
first fruits of the resurrection, and 
He declared : "Because I live, ye 
shall live also." 

He let down the ladder into the 
pit, and bade those who desired sal- 
vation at His hands, to climb. They 
were not to plead their own merits, 
nor rely upon their own strength, 
but were to use their powers iu 
climbing up by the way that He had 
provided. The first round of the 
Gospel ladder is faith in God; the 
second round is repentance from 
sin ; the third round, baptism' by im- 
mersion for the remission of sins; 
and the fourth round, the laying 
on of hands for the gift of the Holy 
Ghost. 

But having placed our feet upon 
the fourth round of the ladder, we 
must not stop there ; we must keep 
on climbing — keep on obeying the 
principles of the Gospel. They reach 
from earth to heaven, and salvation 
in its fulness is only to be attained 
by those who do the will of God, 
and continue in His service, endur- 
ing unto the end. 

This is the problem of salvation, 
from the view point of a Latter-day 
Saint. Mormonism, so-called, is the 
Gospel of Christ. It is a Gospel of 
salvation through and through, and 
it proposes to save, not only the liv- 
ing but also "that other living, called 
the dead." 

I was once conversing with a gen- 
tleman, a minister of one of the 
leading churches, and he said to me: 

"I do not believe that Mormon- 
ism would have had an existence, if 
Joseph Smith had been acquainted 
with the church to which I belong, 
with the religion that I profess and 
preach. Joseph Smith's revolt" — 
that was the word he used, — -"was 
against Methodism, the straight- 



88 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



laced Puritanism of his time, and 
the lurid and gloomy theology of 
the Presbyterians. These were the 
sects he came in contact with, and 
I do not wonder at his revolt. But 
if he had known my church, and be- 
come acquainted with my religion, 
there would have been no Mor- 
monism, for there would have been 
no need for it." 

I assured him that he was very 
much mistaken if he imagined that 
the Prophet did not comprehend his 
religion, as well as all the others. 
The word of God to Joseph Smith, 
in answer to his inquiry as to which 
of all the churches he should join, 
was this : "None of them ; for they 
have all gone out of the way." He 
was told that the true Church of 
Christ did not then exist upon the 
earth, but was about to be estab- 
lished, and that' he had been chosen 
as an instrument for that purpose. 

Let us consider briefly some of 
the claims made by the modern 
Prophet. His movement was no 
mere "revolt" against this creed or 
that; he did not belong to any 
church or sect ; but he was an earn- 
est seeker after truth, and was be- 
wildered by the confusion and con- 
tention that prevailed in the Chris- 
tian churches. Reading in the 
Scriptures : "If any lack wisdom, 
let him ask of God, who giveth to 
all men liberally," he resolved to 
put that promise to the test. He 
therefore asked of God.and received 
the answer I have quoted. Joseph 
declares that while he and Oliver 
Cowdery were translating the Ne- 
phite plates containing the Book of 
Mormon, and while praying over a 
certain doctrine mentioned in the 
plates, a messenger from Heaven 
came down, and laying his hands 
upon their heads,spoke these words : 



"Upon you, my fellow servants, in the 
name of Messiah, I confer the Priest- 
hood of Aaron, which holds the keys of 
the ministering of angels, and of the 
gospel of repentance, and of baptism by 
immersion for the remission of sins ; and 
these shall never be taken again from 
the earth, until the sons of Levi do offer 
again an offering unto the Lord in 
righteousness." 

Up to that time — Mormonism af- 
firms — there was not a man upon 
the face of the earth, in Christen- 
dom or in heathendom, who had the 
right to preach the Gospel and ad- 
minister even in the outward ordi- 
nances thereof. 

The angel who ordained Joseph 
and Oliver told them that his name 
was John, anciently called the Bap- 
tist. He informed them that there 
was still a higher Priesthood, a 
greater authority, called the Priest- 
hood of Melchizedek, the keys to 
which were held by the Apostles, 
Peter, James and John,under whose 
direction he was acting. This higher 
Priesthood should in due time be 
conferred upon them, and it would 
qualify them, not only to call men to 
repentance, and baptize them for the 
remission of their sins; but would 
also empower them to lay hands 
upon those whom they baptized, and 
bestow upon them the Holy Ghost. 
By means of these two Priesthoods, 
spiritual and temporal authority — 
for it was temporal as well as spir- 
itual salvation that was provided 
for, — the Church of God would be 
established, and the great dispensa- 
tion opened wherein was to be 
brought to pass the restitution of all 
things. Such was the substance of 
the angel's message. Under this di- 
vine authority, the Priesthoods of 
Aaron and Melchisedek, the Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints 
was organized, April 6, 1830, at 
Fayette, Seneca county, New York.

Six years later, while the Church 
was at Kirtland, Ohio, a series of 
visions were given in the Temple to 
Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery. 
In the first vision, they beheld the 
Lord Jesus Christ, as Jehovah, the 
God of Israel; and then, as it is 
written : 

"The heavens were again opened unto 
•us, and Moses appeared before us, and 
committed unto us the keys of the gath- 
ering of Israel from the four parts of the 
earth, and the leading of the ten tribes 
from the land of the north. 

"After this, Elias appeared, and com- 
mitted the dispensation of the gospel of 
Abraham, saying, that in us, and our 
seed, all generations after us should be 
blessed. 

"After this vision had closed, another 
great and glorious vision burst upon us, 
for Elijah the prophet, who was taken 
to heaven without tasting death, stood 
before us, and said : 

"Behold, the time has fully come, 
which was spoken of by the mouth of 
Malachi, testifying that he (Elijah) 
should be sent before the great and 
dreadful day of the Lord come, 

"To turn the hearts of the fathers to 
the children, and the children to the 
fathers, lest the whole earth be smitten 
with a curse. 

"Therefore the keys of this dispensa- 
tion are committed into your hands, and 
1oy this ye may know that the great and 
dreadful day of the Lord is near, even 
at the doors." 

Is it not evident to the student of 
Mormonism, if he delves deeply 
enough into the subject, that there 
is something more in this great and 
magnificent problem than a mere 
"revolt" against the inconsistent, 
and unscriptural doctrines of some 
of the sects of Christendom? Do 
you think, after what I have read 
to you, that Joseph Smith's course 
would have been different, if he had 
become better acquainted with any 
particular church or creed then in 
existence ? 

Let me read again, and show 



something further of the wonder- 
ful conception of God's plan of sal- 
vation, as it existed in the mind of 
that mighty prophet of God. In the 
year 1842, while in hiding from his 
enemies, who were seeking his life 
and who succeeded in taking it two 
years later, Joseph Smith addressed 
a communication to the Church, 
showing what was weighing most 
upon his thoughts, as his career 
drew to a close. In that communi- 
cation, he says, — after quoting the 
closing verses of Malachi : 

"It is sufficient to know that the earth 
will be smitten with a curse, .unless there 
is a welding link of some kind or other 
between the fathers and the children, 
upon some subject or other; and behold, 
what is this subject? It is the baptism 
for the dead. For we, without them, 
cannot be made perfect ; neither can 
they nor we be made perfect without 
those who have died in the Gospel also. 
For it is necessary, in the ushering in 
of the dispensation of the fulness of 
times, which dispensation is now be- 
ginning to usher in, that a whole and 
complete and perfect union, and welding 
together of dispensations and keys and 
powers and glories, should take place, 
and be revealed from the days of Adam 
even to the present time; and not only 
this,— but those things which never have 
been revealed, from the foundation of 
the world, but have been kept hid from 
the wise and prudent, shall be revealed 
unto babes and sucklings, in this the dis- 
pensation of the fulness of times." 

Two great thoughts are borne in 
upon the mind when reading this 
wonderful passage of modern 
Scripture : one is, that the past be- 
longs to Mormonism, and the other 
is, that the future belongs to it also. 
Mormonism is no mere nineteenth 
century religion ; it is not merely a 
religion of time. It is the religion 
of the eternities, and has come down 
from the presence of Jehovah, as the 
preordained plan for the salvation 
of the children of men. It has been 



90 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



upon the earth many times in a se- 
ries of dispensations, and this great 
and crowning Gospel dispensation 
has been introduced for the purpose 
of binding together all the dispen- 
sations, welding the present and the 
past, and preparing the world for 
still greater things in the future. 

When and where did the Gospel 
originate? I know of no better ex- 
planation than that given by the 
Prophet Joseph Smith, who said : 

"In the beginning, God, finding Him- 
self in the midst of spirits and glory, be- 
cause He was more intelligent, saw 
proper to institute laws whereby the rest 
might advance like Himself." 

We learn from this, that the Gos- 
pel — now called Mormonism, — 
which comprises and codifies those 
laws that were instituted of God in 
the beginning, was framed before 
the world was created ; that it is the 
means of man's progression, both in 
time and in eternity, — the ladder up 
which all must climb who attain to 
exaltation. Adam's fall was a step 
downward, but it was also a step 
forward — a step in the eternal 
march of human progress ; and it 
is by means of this everlasting Gos- 
pel, and our own individual efforts 
in making use of the powers that 
God has given us, that we lay hold 
upon eternal life, and go on to per- 
fection. 

This being true, is it reasonable 
to suppose that God would wait six 
thousand years before revealing to 
His children for the first time the 
plan of salvation? Is it reasonable, 
that He would wait four thousand 
years, or even two thousand years, 
before He gave to man a knowledge 
of the Redeemer who was to come? 
Would it not be a waste of time? 
Why not let Father Adam and 
Mother Eve know? Why not give 



them the joy of knowing that a Sa- 
vior had been provided, in anticipa- 
tion of their fall, and that they and 
their posterity were hei^s to salva- 
tion, through the atonement of Jesus 
Christ? 

Mormonism declares that this 
was done ; that Adam and Eve had 
the Gospel revealed to them before 
the coming of Christ ; that they were 
baptized for the remission of their 
sins, and received the Holy Ghost. 
By their faith in the Redeemer, 
whose coming Adam symbolized by 
erecting an altar and offering a. 
lamb thereon, — by virtue of Christ's 
atonement, and their obedience to 
the principles of faith, repentance, 
baptism and all other things that 
God required of them, they were re- 
deemed from the fall. They had to 
wait for the resurrection of their 
bodies, but did not have to wait 
for some one to be baptized for 
them. They were baptized in per- 
son, not vicariously. There will be 
enough of that kind of work, with- 
out the elect being added to the list. 
It will take a thousand years to re- 
deem the dead for whom we build 
temples and officiate. But some 
men and women, all down the age's,, 
have had the Gospel, and have been 
redeemed by their obedience to it: 
here, in this life. They do not need 
the vicarious work that will have to 
be done for perhaps millions of our 
race who never heard the name of 
Jesus Christ. Mormonism tells us 
that Adam, bowed with age, blessed 
his posterity, and predicted what 
should befall them to the latest gen- 
eration. The relationship between- 
that first and this last Gospel dis- 
pensation is shown in the fact that: 
Adam is to come again, as the An- 
cient of Days ; that he will call his 
children before him, and perform a 
great part in the winding up scene,.

in binding his dispensation to this 
dispensation, which is destined to 
swallow up the others, even as the 
ocean swallows up the rivers and 
the streams. 

After Adam's day, when the 
world had departed from God, a 
dispensation of the .Gospel was giv- 
en to Enoch. He built a city called 
Zion, which was redeemed and sanc- 
tified by principles that we, as a 
Church, have received, but to the 
perfect practice of which we have 
not yet attained. We falter, some of 
us, in the presence of the law of 
tithing. What shall we do when the 
greater law comes — the law of con- 
secration, when our all will be re- 
quired for the building up of the 
Zion of God, of which the City of 
Enoch was but a type, a symbol, a 
foreshadowing, the lesser coming 
before the greater, pointing out and 
preparing the way ? 

To Noah, also, came a dispensa- 
tion of the Gospel. In his day the 
earth was baptized with water, pre- 
figuring the baptism of fire, which 
our planet is destined to undergo, 
prior to its glorification. "For as 
it was in the days of Noah, so shall 
it be in the days of the coming of 
the Son of Man." 

Abraham also had the Gospel re- 
vealed to him ; and what was the 
part he played? What is the rela- 
tionship between his dispensation 
and our dispensation? God said to 
him', "In thee and in thy seed shall 
all the nations of the earth be bless- 
ed." That promise was fulfilled in 
the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ 
through the lineage of Abraham ; 
but it was also fulfilled in the scat- 
tering among all nations of the 
children of Abraham, Isaac and 
Jacob, preparatory to the great 
gathering in the latter days, when 
they are to be brought from the four 



parts of the earth, to build up Zion, 
and make ready for the second com- 
ing of the Messiah. 

Next came Moses, standing at the 
head of a Gospel dispensation, hold- 
ing the keys to the gathering of 
Israel. He bestows those keys up- 
on the Prophet Joseph Smith, in 
order that he may begin the work 
of the gathering, bringing to God 
all who will come : the Jew, the Gen- 
tile, and the Israelite from among 
the Gentiles. All who will do the 
works of Abraham are counted with 
the children of Abraham, justified 
bv their faith and obedience to the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ. 

In the meridian of time the Sa- 
vior made His mortal advent, choos- 
ing twelve apostles to preach the 
Gospel upon the eastern hemisphere, 
and after His resurrection, appear- 
ing to the Nephites in America, and 
choosing twelve among them to 
preach the Gospel to this part of 
the world. 

Eighteen hundred years later 
dawns the great and last dispen- 
sation, the dispensation of the ful- 
ness of times. Mormonism, with 
the Bible in one hand and the Book 
of Mormon in the other, is reaping 
the results of all the work done by 
servants of God in past ages. It 
avails itself of all the good that has 
been accumulated by the human 
race, not only by prophets and apos- 
tles, but by poets, philosophers, in- 
ventors, discoverers, — all the good 
and wise teachers of Christendom 
and heathendom. It seeks after and 
makes use of all that is pure, wise, 
virtuous, and praiseworthy; and by 
the learning of the past, and the rev- 
elations of the present, proposes to 
erect a monument to the honor and 
glory of God, that shall endure 
throughout the endless ages of the 
future.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



The Gospel designs to save all 
men, but it will save them upon the 
principles of eternal justice, every 
man according to his works. There 
is a glory of the sun, a glory of the 
moon, and a glory of the stars, and 
even as the stars differ in magni- 
tude, so will it be in the resurrection 
of the dead. The only class of hu- 
man beings who need fear that there 
is no salvation for them', are those 
who have received the Gospel in its 
fulness, who have been given every 
"key and passport to eternal glory — 
the power to be exalted to the high- 
est estate of which intelligence is 
capable, and. then have thrown it all 
away, trampling it under foot as a 
thing of naught and denying what 
they know to be true. All others 
can be saved, because all others can 
repent. Men can be forgiven as 
long as they have the power to re- 
pent. 

But some will not repent until 
they pass into another world, where 
those spirits went whose bodies 
were drowned by the deluge in the 
days of Noah. In these days, a 
great principle, that of salvation for 
the dead, has been revealed. This 
is the welding link that will bind 
together the dispensations — the 
child to the parent — the present to 
the past. Can you think of any- 
thing that would turn the hearts of 
the fathers to the children, or the 
hearts of the children to the fathers, 
more effectually than a principle of 
this kind? Mormonism deals with 
the past, the present, and the future. 
It proposes to save all who are will- 
ing to be saved. It will save even 
the damned, after they have paid 
their eternal debt ; but these cannot 
be saved with the fulness of God's 
glory. 

Mormonism is not an enemy to 
the human race ; it is not an enemy 



to the Gentiles. We do not recog- 
nize the word "Gentile" as an op- 
probrious term, though some of our 
outside friends take umbrage at it, 
as if we were trying to fling at them 
an unsavory epithet. What is the 
meaning of "Gentile?" The word 
springs from "gentilis," which 
means of a clan, a family, a race, a 
nation. _ In the days of the Jewish 
commonwealth, Gentile simply 
meant one who was not a Jew ; in 
the early ages of the Christian 
Church, it meant one who was not 
a Christian, and in these times it 
designates one who is not a Latter- 
day Saint. 

The Gentiles are the children of 
Japheth, while the Israelites are de- 
scended from Shem, through Abra- 
ham. Ephraim, from whom most 
of us claim lineal descent, has been 
mixed with the Gentiles, and is now 
being gathered out from the midst 
of them. The Gospel, when the 
Jews rejected it, went to the Gen- 
tiles ; God wanted to save them. 
Cornelius, a righteous man, was a 
Gentile, and upon him' and other 
Gentiles the Holy Ghost was poured 
out, even before baptism. The Gen- 
tiles of today are the nations of 
modern Europe, and this great na- 
tion of which we form a part. Co- 
lumbus was a Gentile, moved upon 
by the Spirit of God to discover 
America — the land of Zion; Wash- 
ington was a Gentile, who carved 
out with the sword of patriotism 
our independence. They were Gen- 
tiles who founded this government, 
the mightiest and most beneficent 
upon which the sun shines. God 
tells us in the Book of Mormon that 
the Gentile nations shall be mighty 
in His eyes in carrying forth the 
children of Israel to the lands of 
their inheritance. He declares fur- 
ther that if the Gentiles will, they

93 



shall come into the Church, partake 
of the blessings of the Gospel, and 
help the House of Israel to build the 
New Jerusalem, preparatory to the 
glorious coming of the Son of God. 
The blessing of Noah upon Japheth 
was, "God shall enlarge Japheth, 
and he shall dwell in the tents of 
Shem." We are not the enemies of 
the Gentiles, we are not the foes of 
the human race; our mission is 
friendship, peace, and good-will; 
our work is to preserve and bind to- 
gether all that is good, both past and 
present, and to labor for the con- 
summation of Christ's work in the 
great and wonderful future. 

May God speed His cause, keep 
us steadfast in the truth, in lifting 
up an ensign of peace to the nations, 
and in preaching to all the world 
the Gospel of Salvation, through 
Jesus Christ, our Lord. Amen. 

The choir sang a hymn entitled 
"True to the Faith." 



ELDER DAVID 0. MKAY. 

"Choose you this day whom ye will 
serve." — Faithfulness to duty is the 
most acceptable service. 

One of the greatest benefits de- 
rived from meeting together, is the 
experiencing of new and beautiful 
thoughfs and feelings. These 
thoughts and feelings are not al- 
ways those expressed by the speak- 
er. Words do not convey thought 
— they only call up thought; but 
those who, while listening, ex- 
perience new thoughts, or noble 
feelings, always derive one of the 
greatest blessings that come to 
those who meet together. You will 
agree with me that this conference 
has been particularly fruitful in 



awakening in our minds the noblest 
of thoughts, the highest and purest 
of feelings. 

Omi passage of Scripture has 
been repeatedly called to my mind 
ever since President Smith emphas- 
ized for the Priesthood the Gospel 
of Doing. That passage is this: 

"Choose you this day whom ye 
shall serve." 

I believe, with Professor Steph- 
ens, whose thought was expressed 
in the beautiful song just sung, that 
in making this choice, the youth 
of Zion will act wisely. 

"Shall the youth of Zion falter 
In defending truth and right ? 

While the enemy assaileth, 
Shall we shrink or shun the fight? No t 

"True to the faith that our parents have- 
cherished ; 

True to the truth for which martyrs have 
perished ; 

To God's command, — soul, heart and 
hand, 

Faithful and true we will ever stand." 

If each of the twenty thousand 
individuals who are this day as- 
sembled on these sacred grounds 
will say to himself, "I this day 
choose to serve the Lord," what a 
mighty army there would be in de- 
fense of right ! Why not make this 
choice? Recently, I heard a testi- 
mony from one of the presidents 
of stakes to this effect : "I am never 
happier than when in the perform- 
ance of my duty." There is nothing 
in life that brings more happiness 
than righteous living — than serving 
God. Then why cannot the twenty 
thousand people here today — nay, 
why cannot all Israel choose this day 
to serve the Lord ? The line between 
truth and error has been distinctly 
marked throughout this conference, 
and the members of the Church of 
Christ are given the choice of truth 
or error. The Church, though m 



94 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



the world, is not of the world. 
There are two distinct armies ; they 
are facing each other. The Church 
stands for truth, the enemy is er- 
ror. 

"Choose you this clay whom ye 
will serve." There is a mighty host 
assembled on these grounds today, 
and there was a mighty host as- 
sembled many years ago in the city 
of Schechenv Israel had gathered 
there to hear the last words of their 
great leader, Joshua. Five score 
years and ten he had seen life; he 
had led Israel faithfully through 
many trials; he had seen their 
waverings, and he had known their 
waywardness. On that memorable 
occasion, he preached to them the 
words of Life, reminding them of 
the many manifestations of God in 
their behalf. He reverted back to 
the days of Abraham, when the 
children went after strange gods. 
He told them how God had led 
their father Abraham out from this 
idolatry ; how the hand of the Lord 
had led Israel out of Egypt ; how 
He had given them lands not of 
their taking; how He had given 
them cities, not of their building. 

"Now, therefore," continued he, "fear 
the Lord, and serve Him in sincerity and 
in truth ; and put away the gods which 
your fathers served on the other side of 
the flood, and in Egypt ; and serve ye the 
Lord, 

"And if it seem evil unto you to serve 
the Lord, choose you this day zvhom ye 
will serve ; whether the gods which your 
fathers served that were on the other 
side of the flood, or the gods of the 
Amorites, in whose land ye dwell : but 
as for me and my house, we will serve 
the Lord." 

If it seem evil in your sight, to 
serve the Lord, then choose you this 
day whom ye will serve. "But," 
said the old Prophet, just before his 
death, "as for me and my house, we 



will serve Jehovah." Then he gave 
the people their choice: 

"Whom will ye serve ?" And they 
cried with one voice, "We will 
serve the Lord." "Remember," said 
he, "it is you who make that cove- 
nant." 

"Ye cannot serve the Lord: for He is 
an holy God; He is a jealous God; He 
will not forgive your transgressions, nor 
your sins. 

"If ye forsake the Lord, and serve 
strange gods, then He will turn and do 
you hurt, and consume you, after that 
Jle hath done you good." 

"And the people said unto Joshua, 
Nay; but we will serve the Lord." 

"And Joshua said unto the people, Ye 
are witnesses against yourselves that ye 
have chosen you the Lord, to serve him. 
And they said, We are witnesses." 

And the covenant made by the 
people that day was placed in the 
book of the law of the Lord, and an 
altar was built there as memorial of 
the covenant. Joshua bade them 
good-bye, and went the way of all 
the earth. That generation kept 
their covenants. You may' read the 
record of Israel from the Exodus to 
the Captivity, and you cannot find a 
generation that -served the Lord so 
faithfully as did those who coven- 
anted with the old Prophet Joshua, 
on that day. 

Brethren and sisters, we must 
choose whom we will serve. I say 
we cannot go on serving, part of 
the time, the enemy, and part of the 
time, the Church. We cannot do 
this. The Lord has said plainly, 
"No man can serve two masters ; 
for either he will hate the one, and 
love the other ; or, else he will hold 
to the one and despise the other. Ye 
cannot serve God and Mammon." 
These words are true ; and I believe 
we should take them! as literally as 
did the Prophet Joseph Smith take 
the words of James : 

"If any of you lack wisdom, let him 



ELDER DAVID 0. McKAY. 



95 



ask of God, who giveth to all men lib- 
erally." 

The Prophet believed these 
words, and took them for their 
meaning. So I believe, we should 
take Christ's words, and know that 
we cannot serve two masters. Let 
lis choose today whom we shall 
serve. 

The truth that we cannot serve 
two masters is emphasized in By- 
ron's "Cain," and I feel to mention it 
here for emphasis. Cain is tempted 
by Lucifer ; and after the Devil has 
led him on, telling him that the 
Gospel is nothing, that Adam was 
deceived, that the Lord is only a 
cruel God, Cain says : 

"Wilt thou teach me all things?" 
"Aye," says Lucifer, "upon one condi- 
tion." 

Cain : "Name it." 

Satan : "That you fall down and wor- 
ship me, the lord." 

Cain : "Thou art not the Lord my 
father worships?" 

Satan : "No." 

Cain: "His equal?" 

Satan : "No. And have naught in 
common with Him. No ; nor want any- 
thing to do with Him. I would be aught 
above, beneath, I would rather be any- 
thing than subject to His power. I dwell 
apart ; yet am I strong, and many there 
are who follow me, and many yet who 
shall. Be thou among the first." 

Cain answered : "I have never yet 
bowed to my father's God, though my 
brother, Abel, oft implores that I should 
offer sacrifices with him." 

Lucifer quickly catches him : "Hast 
thou not bowed to Him?" 

Cain: "Have I not said it? Need I 
say it? Dost not thy mighty knowledge 
teach thee that ?" 

Then these words and Byron 
never uttered a greater truth. 

Satan : "He who boivs not to Him has 
bowed to inc." He who bows not to 
God has bowed to Lucifer. 

"But," says Cain, "I will bow to 
neither." 



"Ne'ertheless," answers the tempter, 
"thou art my worshiper ; he who wor- 
ships not Him is mine the same." 

This truth harmonizes with the 
scripture. "No man can serve two 
masters ; for either he will hate the 
one, and love the other ; or else he 
will hold to the one and despise the 
other." 

Whom shall we serve,my brethren 
and sisters — all Israel here assembl- 
ed, the priesthood, the heads of 
families — the Elders of Israel? 
"Choose you this day whom ye will 
serve." 

I believe you cannot find through-, 
out the Church one young man who. 
if the choice be given him, would 
say, "I choose to serve the world," 
— not one. Well, then, why is it 
that we do serve the world? It is 
through ignorance, or weakness, 
the result of ignorance. The duty 
of the Latter-day Saints — the El- 
ders and leaders — is to teach the 
young men how to serve their 
master. This is not difficult. There 
is no one great thing that we can do 
to serve Him. It is not in member- 
ship only that Christ wants service. 
He can, today as of old, raise up 
from the stones children unto Abra- 
ham. It is not lip-service that He 
wants. Speaking of the churches 
of the world, the Lord said to Jos- 
eph Smith : "They draw near me 
with their lips, but their hearts are 
far from me." It is not lip-service 
— what is it? Faithfulness to duty, 
that is the service. 

I am reminded now of the re- 
sponsibility that rested upon those 
soldiers who followed General Wolfe 
up the mighty heights of Quebec 
that starlight September night. 
What was the duty upon each 
soldier that night? Nothing great — 
five thousand of them stealthily row-

ing down the river, and then quiet- 
ly pulling] themselves up by the 
branches of the trees on the hill- 
side. What was the service de- 
manded from that mighty army? 
Why, the service of order and 
quietness. One soldier that night, 
could have frustrated General 
Wolfe's entire plan. But each one 
had a duty — that of being quiet, 
that of remaining in rank, until, be- 
fore morning, the whole army stood 
on the plains of Abraham, ready to 
take the fort. So it is in this 
great army of the Priesthood ; each 
man has only a little duty to per- 
form; but, oh, the performance of 
it might mean everything to the 
quorum to which he belongs ! It 
mjight mean much to the Church. 

There are instances in history 
where little simple acts have ex- 
pressed the spirit of the entire na- 
tion. One comes to my mind now. 
At one time during the Revolution, 
General Greene had been defeated ; 
he was alone, penniless, hungry, 
foot-sore. He went into an inn, and 
the proprietor said: "Hello, Gen. 
Greene! All alone?" "Yes, alone, 
hungry, and penniless." The lady 
of the house set before him a warm 
breakfast — plain, but the best she 
had, and then, shutting the door 
quietly behind her, she brought and 
put in the General's hand, a purse. 
"There !" she said ; "it is all I have, 
but you are welcome to it ; take it." 
There was hanging just over the 
fire-place of that humble inn, the 
picture of George III. General 
Greene arose, turned the picture to 
the wall, and on the back of it 
wrote this line: "Hide your face, 
George, and blush." Why? Because 
that little simple act had within it 
the expression of the spirit of the 
Revolution. The spirit of freedom, 
was expressed by that woman in a 
little deed of service to her country. 



That is why General Greene said: 
"Hide your face, George, and 
blush." So it may be in this 
Church ; some little act by a dea- 
con, a teacher, a priest, an elder, a 
high-priest, a seventy, an apostle, 
or anyone — some little act may 
manifest his service fo his Church 
and express that loyalty which 
every young man feels, which every 
young man desires to express, and 
which can best be manifested by 
service in the work of the Lord. 
Let us choose this day, throughout 
all Israel, to say with Joshua of old : 
I know not what ye may choose. 
If ye do not wish to serve the Lord, 
choose ye other gods ; go after the 
spirit of the world, if you will ; 
"but as for me and my house, we 
will serve the Lord." 

God help us in this desire; may 
He inspire us in this determination ; 
and make us feel this day that it 
is our duty to teach the young how 
to serve God. The other day, ai 
young man came to me and said, 
that though he had lived in the 
ward for twenty years, in fact alf 
his life, he had never received the 
Priesthood until three months be- 
fore that day. He had not attend- 
ed his meetings, of course; he had 
been reared under an influence of 
the world, and that influence had 
dragged him down. But even that 
young man, that day, said this: 
"Now, I want to serve the Church," 
and he went back to his ward with 
that determination. Though he had 
been indifferent, the young man was 
not lost; his heart was right; but 
he did not know before that time 
how to serve the Church. He stands 
today with a feeling within him that 
he will serve the ward, and do as 
the bishop wants him to do; 
furthermore, to attend his quorums, 
and be true to them. I believe there 
are hundreds of young men who 



ELDER DAVID 0. McKAY.

need to be shown the way, and you 
will find that they will not falter, 
that they will be, 

"True to the faith that their parents 

have cherished; 
True to the truth for which 

martyrs have perished ; 
To God's command, soul, heart and 

hand, 

Faithful and true they will ever 
stand." 

I ask the blessings of our Father 



upon the youth of Israel and upon 
all the Saints everywhere, that we 
may choose to serve God and keep 
His commandments, in the name of 
Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The choir sang the anthem, "Ho- 
sanna !" 

Conference was adjourned until 
Monday, 10 a. m. 

Benediction was pronounced by 
Elder William H. Seegmiller. 



THIRD DAY. 



Monday, Oct. 6th, 10 a. m. 

Conference was called to order by 
President Joseph F. Smith. 

The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn: 

Redeemer of Israel, our only delight, 

On whom for a blessing we call, 
Our shadow by day, and our pillar by 
night, 

Our King, our Deliv'rer, our all ! 

Prayer was offered by Elder 
Frank Y. Taylor. 

The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn : 

How firm a foundation, ye Saints of the 
Lord, 

Is laid for your faith in His excellent 
word ! 

What more can He say than to you He 
hath said, 

You who unto Jesus for refuge have 
fled? 



ELDER ANTHONY W. IVINS. 

Undoubting faith in divinity of the Sa- 
vior, and mission of the Prophet Jos- 
eph. — Gospel laws and doctrines ap- 
peal to man's love of truth. — Disre- 
gard of those laws inevitably pro- 
duces unhappiness. — Distinction be- 
tween civil and Church government ; 
both affect the individual.. — Political 
religion. — Gratifying progress in 
Church affairs, further development 
essential. 

I sincerely desire, my brethren 
and sisters, that you will give me 
the benefit of your faith and prayers 
during the brief period that I shall 
stand before you this morning. A 
comparative stranger as I am to 



this congregation of people, with 
an environment so different from 
that to which I have nearly all my 
life been accustomed, I feel that 
unless the Lord shall help me, and I 
shall have your sympathy and faith, 
I will not be able to properly ex- 
press the thoughts that have been 
crowding through my mind while 
we have been together in this con- 
ference. 

It has been said that as a man 
thinketh, so he speaketh ; and if the 
brief remarks which I make shall 
be, in a measure, of a personal 
character, I feel certain that you 
will pardon me, because, in spite 
of myself, I have been thinking of 
my own life — of its varied circum- 
stances, associations, and conditions 
— which have finally culminated in 
this fact: that I stand here this 
morning, worthy to be counted a 
member of the Church of Christ; 
worthy, I trust, of your confidence 
and faith ; your servant and fel- 
low laborer in the work of the 
Lord, which has been established 
in this dispensation. 

I have not been accustomed, in 
my life, to mingle much with men 
under circumstances of this kind. I 
have not been accustomed to as- 
sociations which have been the re- 
sult of the works of man. Almost 
my entire life has been spent with 
nature. I have learned to love it; 
I have learned to feel at home with 
it; to appreciate the works of God, 
and to adapt myself to them as He 
created and left them long ago. Be- 
cause of this, it will not be easy, I 



ELDER ANTHONY W. IVINS. 



99 



suppose, for me to adapt myself to 
changed conditions. I have travel- 
ed, for weeks together, over barren, 
trackless desolate plains, seeing 
the face of no man of my own kind 
except my companions, and felt en- 
tirely happy and at home. I have 
been lonesome, and lost, and fearful 
in the crowded cities of the world ; 
I have slept by the camp-fire, with 
wicked and marauding men all 
around me, with no„ sound but the 
cries of the wild things of nature, 
and felt as perfectly secure, and 
rested as soundly as it would be 
possible for man to do; and have 
lain awake, anxious, nervous, un- 
settled in my mind, in the great 
hostleries of the large cities I 
have visited. I have prayed to the 
Lord upon the tops of mountain 
peaks, and in the shades of deep 
canyons, and felt Him as near to 
me as I ever have in temples erect- 
ed by human hands. 

At the time of my birth, my par- 
ents were members of the Church 
and I was taught by them, by pre- 
cept and example, principles that 
made for an upright and religious 
life ; and if I failed, if I came short, 
it was not because of the teachings 
or example of my parents. When 
I grew older, when I came to think 
and investigate for myself, when 
I came to pray intelligently to my 
Father in Heaven for light, wis- 
dom, and understanding — I became 
a thorough convert to the necessity, 
the divinity, and the efficacy of the 
mission of the Savior of the world. 
I learned to love His character, to 
love His works, to love the 
doctrines He taught, because I 
found in them, so far as my mind 
and spirit was concerned, that 
which satisfied every legitimate de- 
sire of the human heart. And this 
testimony of the divinity of His 
work was no stronger in my heart, 



no more satisfying to me, than was 
the testimony which the Lord gave 
me that in the dispensation in which 
we live, He had, in His mercy, re- 
stored the Gospel ; that Christ Him- 
self did appear to Joseph Smith, 
the Prophet of this dispensation; 
that God Himself did speak to him, 
thus re-establishing, in this age of 
doubt and darkness, the fact of His 
personality, and opening up to us 
a new Gospel dispensation. I be- 
lieve it with all my heart; and the 
experience of years of labor, years 
of investigation, years of study, 
have strengthened that testimony 
every day of my life. 

I love the Gospel of Christ, be- 
cause it taught me that birth was 
not the beginning of my existence, 
nor death the end of my life. For 
Jesus said that He came from the 
Father; that He was with Him in 
the beginning. Yet He was born 
of woman, as you and I have been 
born; walking among men; teach- 
ing, exhorting, organizing, pointing 
out the way .of eternal life; and 
eventually crucified by wicked men. 
We know that He rose again, we 
know that He went back to the 
Father, to sit upon His right hand. 

So I said to myself, Christ came 
to earth, not only to teach us by 
precept, the way of eternal life, but 
to show us by example, that we 
might have actual ocular demon- 
stration of what the life of every 
human being may be, if he only 
will coniform to the laws which 
God has given in order that he may 
attain to eternal life. I loved His 
doctrines, because I found truth in 
them — absolute truth in them all. 
Nothing that He taught, no word 
that He ever uttered, nor principle 
that He ever gave to men con- 
tained a word of error, so far as 
I was able to detect. It taught me 
that if I would be like Him, if I 



100 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



desired to attain to those things 
which He promised, I must love the 
truth. It taught me that I must not 
be a liar, because the Lord had 
said that a liar could not inherit the 
Kingdom of Heaven; it taught me 
morality, that I must be a moral 
man,— because He said that the 
adulterer could not enter into the 
Kingdom of Heaven; it taught me 
that I must be a temperate man, 
because the Gospel says that strong 
drinks are not for the body, that 
they are not for the use of man, 
but that they dethrone his reason. 
Therefore, I resolved in my heart 
that, with His help, I would be tem- 
perate. I want to say here by way 
of parenthesis: If there is a mem- 
ber of the Church of Christ today 
who is not a temperate man or 
woman, if it is necessary to preach 
temperance, to preach prohibition 
to the Latter-day Saints, it is be- 
cause they have been negligent, 
they have not listened to the word 
of the Lord, and not because the 
Gospel does not have in it that 
which will eliminate this evil. The 
Gospel has also taught me that 1 
must be an industrious man ; for 
the Lord has said that the idler 
should not eat the bread, nor wear 
the apparel of the laborer. It 
taught me that I should be true to 
every trust that was reposed in me, 
that if I accepted service, my duty 
was to my employer; and that I 
had no right, at his expense, to 
build up my own private interests. 

My brethren and sisters, I shall 
not prolong my remarks by con- 
tinuing this review. It is sufficient 
for me to say, as I before remark- 
ed, that I found in the Gospel 
everything which it seemed to mc 
the heart of man can desire in or- 
der that he may be made happy. I 
believe it is the will of the Lord that 



we should be happy in this life, 
notwithstanding the fact that when 
the path to happiness is so clear- 
ly defined, the great majority of the 
world walk in that other path, seek- 
ing that which they never find. 
They are unhappy, discontented, 
and still contending and fighting 
against the truth which would 
bring to them the thing that they 
vainly seek in their own way. The 
Gospel of Christ taught me that I 
should be loyal to the Church to 
which I belong. It taught me just 
as effectively, and just as definite- 
ly, that I should be loyal and pat- 
riotic to the government under 
which the Church exists. 

Church government is given to 
us in order that we may be pre- 
pared for eternal life in the world 
to come.. When brought before 
Pilate, one of the accusations made 
by the Jews against Christ was that 
He declared Himself to be a King. 
Judah was tributary to Rome, and 
Herod was the titular king of the 
Jews ; and so they said : "This man 
is guilty of treason, because he de- 
clared that he is a king." Then. 
Pilate said: "Art thou a king?" 
Jesus answered : "Yes, but my 
kingdom is not of this world; I 
came not to do the will of man, but 
to do the will of my Father." I 
came here to establish righteous- 
ness, to organize and establish my 
Church in the earth, that by obedi- 
ence to the precepts of the Gospel, 
men and women might be saved. 

So, in the dispensation in which 
we live, -God has re-established His 
Church ; He has given us the per- 
fect organization which exists, in 
order that its interests may be 
properly cared for. But churches 
need civil government. Ecclesias- 
tical government alone is not suf- 
ficient ; and so, as He has establish- 



ELDER ANTHONY W. IVINS. 



101 



ed church government in the earth, 
He has established civil govern- 
ment in the earth. The Church of 
Christ is presided over by men call- 
ed to their positions by divine 
authority, divinely authorized to ex- 
ercise the prerogatives of the 
Priesthood ; while civil government 
is presided over by men chosen by 
the people over whom they pre- 
side. Christ has told us that in the 
Church all things are to be done 
by common consent; that the pre- 
rogatives of the Priesthood are to 
be exercised only in kindness, — by 
persuasion, by reason, by love, by 
charity, — and with this, the exer- 
cise of our prerogative ends. We 
do not assume to impose pains and 
penalties; we only deal with peo- 
ple for their fellowship in the 
Church. Just as God has thus es- 
tablished His work, so He has told 
us, by inspired men, that, all just 
civil governments derive their pow- 
ers from the consent of the govern- 
ed; that the word of the people in 
the state is the word of God, just as 
the word of the people in the 
Church is the word of God. We say 
in the Church, you shall not steal, 
and if you steal, and repent not, you 
are unworthy of fellowship, and we 
cast you out; but with that, our 
prerogative ceases. The civil law 
says, you shall not steal — if you 
do steal, it lays hands upon you ; it 
restrains you of your liberty; it 
places you in bonds, and casts you 
into prison. The law of God says, 
you shall not shed the blood of 
man, and he who sheddeth the 
blood of man hath not Eternal Life 
abiding in him, and with this we 
cease. The civil law says, he who 
killeth shall answer with his life. 
Hands are laid upon him, and the 
law is executed. So that the pre- 
rogatives of civil government are of 
great, importance ; it deals with our 



property, it deals with our lives ; 
it carries into a temporal, a pres- 
ent, an actual effect the laws pro- 
vided for our protection and wel- 
fare. It defends us against foreign 
invasion, and protects us against 
wrong-doing among ourselves. So 
it seems to me that it is exceeding- 
ly important' that civil government 
be maintained ; and the Gospel has 
always taught me that it is my 
solemn duty to maintain it. 

I heard a man say, the other day, 
that his politics had nothing to do 
with his religion. I can think of 
no obligation resting upon me 
which is more sacred or nearer a 
religious duty, than that I see to 
it, so far as my influence, so far 
as my voice and my vote may go, 
that this civil government which we 
love, which we maintain, be ad- 
ministered by righteous men. To 
that extent it is my religion, and I 
don't want to be muzzled in saying 
so. Is that good doctrine, or is it 
bad doctrine? 

"When the wicked reign, the peo- 
ple mourn," and so men into whose 
hands these great responsibilities 
are nlaced, men who hold life and 
death at their disposal, men who 
control the disposition of our prop- 
erty—ought to be righteous men; 
they ought to be honest and con- 
scientious men. God being my 
helper, I will never vote for a man, 
nor advocate a man for a public 
place, in whom I have not that con- 
fidence ; and I say that this is good 
religion for Latter-day Saints, for 
Catholics, for Presbyterians, and 
for Methodists. No sect or creed 
should ever dominate the state, that 
fact is of very great importance; 
but it is nevertheless the religious 
duty of every sect and creed to see 
to it that the state which dominates 
them is righteously and properly 
administered. This is what the 



102 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Gospel has taught to me. These are 
the convictions that have come to 
my heart, and I speak them for 
myself. 

My brethren and sisters, I re- 
joice with you in the progress and 
development which the work of the 
Lord is making, as shown by the re- 
ports made in this conference ; I re- 
joice with you that conditions are 
so favorable as they are in the 
Church. But I want to say that, 
because of this progress, because 
of these favorable conditions, we 
must not suppose that there is noth- 
ing more to do. The work that 
is before the Church, the great 
problems that are to be worked out 
and adjusted, the future develop- 
ment of the Church, are of more 
importance to us than anything that 
has yet been accomplished. And we 
cannot carelessly relax our efforts ; 
we cannot sit down, and say the 
Lord is going to do it. The Lord 
never has done it; He has shown 
us the way; He has pointed out 
the path in which we should walk; 
He has taught us the truth, and 
then left us to go on and develop 
that great problem; — for I can tell 
you that it is a great problem, and 
one that is not yet fully developed 
— which involves the betterment 
of the social conditions of the 
world, the preaching of the 
Gospel, and the redemption of the 
children of men. It applies not on- 
ly to those who are receiving the 
truth in the world and gathering 
to Zion, but also to the remnants of 
the people of Nephi. These are 
important problems, which we are 
in duty bound to meet: we must 
see to the moral condition of the 
Saints; we must correct infidelity 
and unbelief which exists in the 
minds of young people — it does ex- 
ist to a certain extent, at least. All 



these are questions which require 
our undivided and earnest atten- 
tion, and our very best efforts. 

Yesterday, Brother Whitney 
very eloquently portrayed not only 
the condition of the Church at pre- 
sent, but the dispensations of the 
past were referred to, as well as the 
promises for the future— all of 
which gives great hope and 
strength. The past can benefit on- 
ly as we learn by it; we cannot 
change it. It may be, in a measure, 
a lamp, by which our feet may be 
guided, for the experiences of the 
past ought to teach us something of 
the present. Promises which refer 
to the future cannot be so directly 
beneficient. The thing which 
mightily concerns us, and which 
is of greatest importance to us is 
the present : our own lives, our own 
dispensation, the work that is here 
for us to do — the living present is 
that which should most interest 
Latter-day Saints today. There- 
fore, let every president of a stake 
every bishop of a ward, go back to 
his home with the thought that 
there is yet work to do, and work in 
plenty. 

May the Lord bless you, my 
brethren and sisters; may He bless 
all Israel, and prepare the way for 
the accomplishment of His pur- 
poses, for the redemption of His 
people. May He prepare our hearts 
that we may obey and observe 
every law which has been given. I 
testify to you that not one doctrine 
of the Church, not one law of the 
Lord given in this dispensation 
through the Prophet Joseph Smith, 
whether it refer to our temporal or 
spiritual affairs, will fall to the 
ground unfulfilled. The principles 
and doctrines that were given 
through him to the world, are true, 



ELDER BRIGHAM H. ROBERTS.

and truth is eternal, and must soon- 
er or later prevail. 

May the Lord defend it; and 
may we defend it; and may we 
have power to work out, not only 
our own salvation, but to assist 
in developing and working out the 
destiny of the Church, through 
Jesus Christ. Amen.

soprano solo, "O Loving Father." 

ELDER BRIGHAM H. ROBERTS. 

Yesterday President Smith gave 
us instructions which, if he follow- 
ed one would be able to make him- 
self heard in this great auditorium. 
When he got through, I thought 
now) if he would only devise some 
scheme, or give some instruction 
that would help one to overcome his 
inclination to stage fright, so that in 
the first few moments, when ad- 
dressing a congregation such as 
this, one could tell whether he was 
speaking in thundering tones or on 
ly in a stage whisper, I would be 
everlastingly grateful to him. 

There was a remark, made by 
President Lund in his address yes- 
terday which appealed very forci- 
bly to me. It was at that stage of 
his remarks where he was pointing 
out that the spirit of contention is 
not the spirit of Christ, and where 
he reminded us that it was our 
duty, especially the duty of the 
Elders of the Church, to preach the 
Gospel of Peace. That reminded 
me of a passage in one of the rev- 
elations given to the Church short- 
ly after the expulsion of the Saints 
from Jackson County, Missouri. 
I have no doubt in my own mind 
but what the instruction seemed 



very difficult to carry out by the 
Saints of that period. I will read 
to you the passage : 

"And again I say unto you, Sue for 
peace, not only to the people that have 
smitten you, but also to all people; and 
lift up an ensign of peace and make a 
proclamation for peace unto the ends of 
the earth ; and make proposals for peace 
unto those who have smitten you, ac- 
cording to the voice of the Spirit which 
is in you, and all things shall work to- 
gether for your good." 

I say that this instruction under 
the circumstances was doubtless re- 
garded as difficult to carry out. The 
Saints, at that time, were smarting 
under the sense of the heavy 
wrongs inflicted upon them. They 
had been whipped and maltreated. 
Their houses had been burned. 
They had been expelled from land 
which they had purchased from the 
Government. They were exiles 
from their homes ; and to be told, 
under these circumstance, to sue for 
peace, even at the hands of those 
who had smitten them — and to raise 
an ensign of peace unto the world, 
that, I say, was a hard task for peo- 
ple in their condition. It ought to 
be, and I think it is easier for us to 
carry out the spirit of this instruc- 
tion than it was for the Saints in 
those days. When our circum- 
stances are much more pleasant, 
and when such opposition as we 
have endured of late years has not 
ended so disastrously to us, it 
ought to be comparatively easy for 
us to follow the admonition given 
by President Lund, "to preach the 
Gospel of Peace." And I doubt not 
but we shall find this task all the 
easier of accomplishment if we will 
be entirely candid with ourselves 
and remember our own imperfec- 
tions and short comings, and our 



104 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



own folly, both as individuals and 
also as a community. To illustrate 
what I mean: As you know, I'have 
had some experience in the world- 
as a preacher of the Gospel, as a 
representative of the Church in 
mission fields. It is something of 
a matter of pride with me that I 
never yet preached the Gospel in 
such a manner that it resulted in 
mob violence ; yet during my con- 
nection with the Southern States 
Mission and the mission in Great 
Britain, there was scarcely a dis- 
turbance with which I was not con- 
nected, but it! was invariably to 
render assistance to others who 
were in trouble, and the trouble 
was none of my creating. From 
the experience then gained I know 
that much of the opposition met 
with in the world is the result of 
the folly of some of the Elders. 
We carry with us the Gospel of 
Peace, it is true, but occasionally we 
find Elders who shoot it at the peo- 
ple as if it were porcupine quills, 
with the result that they stir up need- 
less animosities by their actions. We 
ought not to marvel very much that 
the religious world dislike us. You 
know we have twisted the nose of 
Dame Orthodoxy rather severely. 
We start in by telling them that 
neither the individual sects nor all 
of the sects combined constitute the 
Church and Kingdom of God. We 
tell them that their creeds are false 
and an abomination unto the Lord; 
and the rasping part of the declara- 
tion, to them, is that we prove it. 
Now, under these circumstances 
you don't suppose that you are go- 
ing to have peace proclamations 
from them, do you? I doubt if we, 
ourselves, would be much inclined 
to peace, if people made such a 
proclamation concerning us. Well, 



I think that we can put off our war- 
paint all the easier if we remember 
our own delinquencies and confess 
them just a little. The Gospel of 
Jesus Christ is perfect. There is 
no flaw in it. There is no imper- 
fection in it. The revelations of 
God stand invulnerable. In our re- 
cent experience as a Church, we 
have had ample demonstration of 
that truth. You think of the rigid 
analysis made of our faith by one 
of the most powerful and intelligent 
committees in the Senate of the 
United States. Recall that rigid in- 
vestigation — what pinciple of the 
Gospel failed? For what principle 
revealed did you have to offer any 
apology? For none. The truth of 
God stood four-square to every 
wind that blew upon it. I can con- 
ceive of no assembly of men, no 
congress, no parliament, no as- 
sembly of the learned before whom 
I would have the least hesitation 
of undertaking the advocacy and 
defense of the revelations of God. 
Not because there is any excellence 
of understanding, or power of ad- 
vocacy, or adroitness in defense in 
me; but because I have absolute 
confidence in the Gospel of Jesus 
Christ, and in the strength of its 
truths. But when you come to mea- 
sure man by that truth you find 
he comes short. When you come to 
the defense of the acts of some who 
have figured in our history you can't 
defend them at every point. Man is 
weak and stands far below the level 
of the perfection of God's system 
of truth. Much that is unwise 
has been said. The conceptions 
that men have had of the 
truth have not always been ac- 
curate. You have to throw aside 
some discourses that have been 
preached. While the truth is perfect,

and defensible at every point, man's 
conception of things and man's ac- 
tions are not always defensible. So, 
now, if we recall our imperfections 
and realize that some of our 
troubles have arisen through our 
own folly, and the manifestation of 
weakness in us, it will be all the eas- 
ier for us to raise this standard of 
peace and to learn, from the ex- 
periences of the past, better meth- 
ods of presenting the truth to the 
people. Let us preach the Gospel of 
peace also. Brother Junius F. Wells 
here, once said — or he quoted some- 
body as saying — '"Brethren, preach 
the Gospel, and preach it pleasant- 
ly." I think that is good advice. 

I wish we either could modify our 
terminology, or, at least, could 
have a better understanding of that 
terminology which we use. Let me 
try to illustrate what I mean: One 
came to the Savior and said to Him, 
in the course of his conversation ; 
"Who is my neighbor?" The Sav- 
ior answered in the well known 
parable of the good Samaritan. 
The principal lesson of that para- 
ble is that you will not always find 
your neighbor among the priests, 
nor the Levites; you may some- 
times find him among the Samari- 
tans, whose name stands as a syn- 
onym for a despised people. In 
this instance, in the parable of the 
Savior, the Samaritan was more 
neighborly than the priest or the 
Levite. I could wish that the 
Savior had given us an equally 
luminous explanation of the term : 
Who is my enemy? Well, one will 
say, has He not done so? And, 
perhaps, you will be recalling the 
saying of the Savior when He said : 
"He that is not with me is against 
me ; and he that gathereth not with 
me scattereth abroad." 



You remember that, perhaps, but 
that is only half the truth ; only half 
what Jesus said. There was an- 
other occasion when John remarked 
— and you are surprised somewhat 
that John should do it, because it is 
a little out of character for him — 
but, nevertheless, he said : "Master, 
we saw one casting out devils in 

thy name and we 

forbad him, because he followeth 
not us." 

But Jesus said, "Forbid him not : 
for there is no man which shall do 
a miracle in my name, that can 
lightly speak evil of me." 

So Mark relates it. Luke ends the 
story by saying. "He that is not 
against us is for us." 

Now, take the passages together 
and you get something like the 
truth out of them. Let scripture 
interpret scripture ; do not take it in 
fragments. The work of the Lord, 
in these last days, has been of such 
a character that it has provoked 
strong antagonisms, and down on 
the immediate firing-line we have 
had enemies, and very bitter ones; 
men who love not the truth; men 
who struck at the truth through 
striking at what we were seeking to 
accomplish, and they may rightly 
be styled enemies of the truth, en- 
emies of God, and our enemies. 
They not only do not gather with 
us, but they scatter abroad and seek 
to destroy. They are truly against 
us. But, I pray you, do not in 
your thought expand the term "en- 
emy" beyond those few whom we 
meet in this conflict — do not expand 
your term so far that it will repre- 
sent all of our Father's children 
not immediately identified with us 
in the work of God, as being our 
enemies. It is not true; they are 
not all our enemies. The great 



106 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



mass of our Father's children are 
ignorant of us, or indifferent in 
respect of us; and some few of 
them are prejudiced against us be- 
cause of the things they have heard 
of us. We should look upon the 
hosts of our Father's children as 
our friends, as our brethren and 
sisters; and even where they are 
stirred up in animosity against us 
it should not create animosity in 
our hearts — nay, not even for those 
down here on the firing-line, with 
whom we are in immediate con- 
flict. While they may hate us, it 
is no part of our business to hate 
them. We may have enemies, but 
we can, under the Gospel, be enemy 
to no man. We must preach the 
Gospel in the spirit of "Peace on 
earth, good will to men." We will 
maintain our rights of course. We 
will sacrifice no truth to please mor- 
tal man. We can't be untrue to 
God ; that is out of the question ; but 
we can proceed peacefully in teach- 
ing this truth that God has com- 
mitted to us and which is so per- 
fect; we can and ought to cultivate 
the spirit of preaching it in the 
spirit of peace. Now let me de- 
part, for the moment, from this 
subject and call your attention to the 
broad manner in which God pro- 
ceeds with His work. 

If there is one tendency, one dan- 
ger, against which I would be dis- 
posed to raise my voice among the 
Latter-day Saints, it would be in 
the way of cautioning our people 
from becoming sectarian in spirit, 
in their sympathies — or rather in 
their lack of sympathies — and in their 
methods. I love the Prophet Jos- 
eph Smith — to me, in my affections, 
he is next to the Son of God, who 
must always be first in our affec- 
tions,as in our thoughts, and to whom 
we owe worship ; but after the Son 



of God, I have learned to love the 
memory of Joseph Smith, the Pro- 
phet. He was, indeed, a God-in- 
spired man. He looked deep into 
things and saw them as they are. 
Among the qualities for which I 
love him is the absence of every- 
thing of a sectarian spirit in his 
soul — his sympathies were broad as 
the human race; his conception of 
the relationship of man and God, 
exceeded in excellence all the teach- 
ings of all other modern men. 

You know, in former years, that 
some of the Latter-day Saints have 
been prone to narrowness. When 
God revealed to the Church 
that Independence, in Jackson 
County, was the center place 
of Zion, the hearts of the peo- 
ple turned to that land ; and I some- 
times think their affections and 
hopes were contracted to that par- 
ticular spot. When the Church 
was removed from Jackson County 
and took to building cities and lay- 
ing out towns in Caldwell County ; 
and when afterwards — being com- 
pelled to leave Missouri altogether 
— they took to building up cities in 
Illinois, the feelings of some 
were tried ; they felt that they were 
driven from Zion: "God made 
promises concerning Zion, and He 
has not fulfilled them," was their 
complaint. The spirit of complaint 
and unbelief existed, more or less, 
among the people ; but the Prophet 
previous to his death, enlarged their 
views and told them that this whole 
western land, North and South Am- 
erica, was the land of Zion. This 
was the land to which the predic- 
tions of God pointed; and they 
need not worry about this or that 
particular spot in it, for the two 
American continents constituted the 
land of Zion. 

Only the day before yesterday, a 



ELDER BRIGHAM H. ROBERTS. 



107 



young friend of mine stopped me 
on the street. He had made a dis- 
covery in the remarks of the Pro- 
phet at the April Conference of 
1844; and he asked me if I was 
aware that the Prophet had declar- 
ed both the American continents 
to be the land of Zion, and that he 
gave direction to the Twelve 
Apostles to establish stakes of Zion 
in New York, and in Boston, and 
I think also in Philadelphia. I re- 
joiced to see the animation of 
countenance and the joy in the face 
of my friend, who had just come 
from the discovery of a new idea. I 
rejoiced in that, and I told him that 
I too, had noted the Prophet's 
statements, and, moreover, I called 
his attention to the fact that while 
the Prophet was speaking of es- 
tablishing stakes of Zion in the 
Eastern states, at the same tim-e he 
was putting in readiness a body of 
men to explore the west and es- 
tablish the Church also in the val- 
leys of the Rocky Mountains. 

My friends, there was nothing 
narrow and contracted in the views 
and projects of that modern prophet 
of ours. His views of Zion were 
as broad as the American conti- 
nents. Why, think of that magnifi- 
cent exposition of what Mormonism 
is, that we listened to only yester- 
day afternoon, from Elder Orson 
F. Whitney, when the eternities 
were brought together, and all the 
ends of the earth were made to 
meet in this great latter-day work. 
How uplifting it all was ! It show- 
ed us that Mormonism is something 
more than a machine which pro- 
poses to make men of one length, 
and one height, and one weight. It 
is not a machine for making steor- 
typed men, but a system of truth 
with principles guiding conduct; 
the truth to be voluntarily accepted, 



and the principles personally ap- 
plied until man shall be enabled, 
under this system of truth and these 
principles, to approximate some- 
thing towards the stature of a per- 
fect man in Christ Jesus. 

Well, I started to call your at- 
tention to the largeness of things in 
this great latter-day work. Several 
times, here, we have had quoted 
to us the saying of Isaiah, the Pro- 
phet, "The law shall go forth from 
Zion and the word of the Lord from 
Jerusalem." That passage is very 
familiar to Latter-day Saints, but 
have you ever analyzed it, have you 
thought much about it? Why the 
law from Zion? Why the word of 
the Lord from Jerusalem? I think 
that Elder Ivins turned the key to 
that question this morning, in his 
remarks on civil government and on 
ecclesiastical government, and the 
distinction between them. In the 
Book of Mormon I find the follow- 
ing principles laid down — great 
fundamental principles ; and, mark 
you, they are to be found in the Am- 
erican scripture, in the scriptures of 
the land of Zion. Let me preface 
the quotation. The passage I am go- 
ing to read relates to an event that 
happened in the reign of the Sec- 
ond Mosiah. His sons had been 
converted to the Gospel, and hav- 
ing been imbued with its spirit they 
had gone on missions to the Lam- 
anites. Realizing that his own days 
were drawing to a close, Mosiah 
was anxious about the succession to 
the Nephite kingdom. He called 
the people together to ascertain 
their feelings concerning the suc- 
cession, and their desire was that 
one of his sons should succeed to 
the throne. Then he called their 
attention to the evils of monarchy — 
that it was all right to have kings to 
govern them ; <" they could always 



108 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



be sure that their kings would be 
righteous men; but the trouble is 
that virtues are not always heredi- 
tary. While the father is sometimes 
righteous, the sons do not always 
follow in his footsteps ; and so King 
Mosiah proposed to them a great 
revolution in the government. He 
proposed to establish a reign of 
Judges, elected by the people — 
government by the people, a repub- 
lic. And now the' passage : 

"Therefore choose you by the voice of 
this people, judges, that ye may be 
judged according to the laws which have 
been given you by our fathers, which 
are correct, and which were given them 
by the hand of the Lord. 

"Now, it is not common that the voice 
of the people desireth anything contrary 
to that which is right; but it is common 
for the lesser part of the people to de- 
sire that which is not right; therefore 
this shall ye observe, and make it your 
law to do your business by the voice of 
the people. 

"And if the time comes that the voice 
of the people doth choose iniquity, then 
is the time that the judgments of God 
will come upon you, yea, then is the time 
he will visit you with great destruction 
even as he has hitherto visited this land. 

"And now if ye have judges, and they 
do not judge you according to the law 
which has been given, ye can cause that 
they may be judged of a higher judge: 

"If your higher judges do not judge 
righteous judgments, ye shall cause that 
a small number of your lower judges 
should be gathered together, and they 
shall judge your higher judges, accord- 
ing to the voice of the people. 

"And I command you to do these 
things in the fear of the Lord: and I 
command you to do these things, and 
that ye have no king: that if this peo- 
ple [mark you this] that if this people 
commit sins and iniquities, they shall be 
answered upon their own heads. 

"For behold I say unto you, the sins 
of many people have been caused by the 
iniquities of their kings ; therefore their 
iniquities are answered upon the heads 
of their kings. . 

"And now I desire that this inequality 
should be no more in this land especially 
among this my people; but I desire that 



this be a land of liberty, that every man 
may enjoy his rights and privileges alike, 
so long as the Lord sees fit, that we may 
live and inherit the land; yea, even as 
long as any of our posterity remains up- 
on the face of the land." 

To me that is, in part, the law of 
Zion — the basic principle of the civil 
law of the land — a principle of the 
law that is going forth from Zion — ■ 
the civil law that is to be established 
and maintained upon this blessed 
land of liberty, and that, eventual- 
ly, will directly or indirectly bless 
and make free every land in all the 
world. 

There is another scripture — £n 
perfect accord with the passage I 
have just read from the Book of 
Mormon — from the Doctrine and 
Covenants : 

"And again I say unto you, saith the 
Lord, those who have been scattered by 
their enemies, it is my will that they 
should continue to importune for redress 
and redemption by the hands of those 
who are placed as rulers and are in au- 
thority over you, according to the laws 
and Constitution of the people, which I 
have suffered to be established and 
should be maintained for the rights and 
protection of all flesh, according to just 
and holy principles, that every man may 
act in doctrine and principle pertaining 
to futurity, according to the moral 
agency which I have given unto them, 
that every man may be accountable for 
his own sins in the day of judgment. 
Therefore, it is not right that any man 
should be in bondage, one to another ; 
and for this purpose have I established 
the Constitution of this land by the 
hands of wise men whom I raised up 
unto this very purpose and redeemed the 
land by the shedding of blood." 

This again, to me, is the law of 
Zion — in part the • law that shall 
go forth from Zion — the law of 
freedom — the law that the people 
shall rule — that "every man," as 
Mosiah puts it, "may enjoy his 
rights and privileges alike :" that if 



ELDER BRIGHAM H. ROBERTS. 



109 



a "people commit sins and iniquities 
they shall be answered upon their 
own heads." But in order to estab- 
lish in civil government this person- 
al responsibility of every individual 
to God, each individual must have 
an equal voice in the government ; 
every man must be a sovereign in the 
civil institution, and his vote must 
represent the voice and judgment 
of a free man, a vote unawed by in- 
fluence as unbought by corruption 
or gain. Less than this brings the 
whole scheme of free government 
by "the voice of the people" to con- 
tempt and failure. 

This "law" is expressed again in 
the American "Declaration of In- 
dependence : 

"We hold these truths to be self-evi- 
dent : that all men are created equal, that 
they are endowed by their Creator with 
certain unalienable rights, among which 
are life, liberty, and the pursuit of hap- 
piness ; and to secure these rights gov- 
ernments are instituted among men, de- 
riving their just powers from the con- 
sent of the governed." 

That is the 'law" that is now go- 
ing forth from Zion as expressed by 
those "wise men" whom God de- 
clares in his revelations to us he 
raised up and inspired to found the 
laws and constitution of the United 
States government ; that men might 
not be "in bondage one to another," 
and that every man may be account- 
able for his own sins in the day of 
judgment. This is the law of Zion 
that is going forth in the earth to 
redeem the world from human bond- 
age, and establish the freedom and 
the responsibility and the dignity of 
man. It is to be observed, in pass- 
ing, that there is perfect accord in 
these passages I have quoted from 
such widely variant authorities — 
from the Book of Mormon, from 
the Doctrine and Covenants, and 



from the declaration of Independ- 
ence. The insipration which pro- 
duced all three,however,is fjrom the 
same source, hence the unity in all 
three passages — unity of principle, 
and unity of purpose. The prin- 
ciple of government announced 
while not entirely new, in the Am- 
erican government is, nevertheless, 
by our own constitution, cast in 
new moulds, preserved by new 
safe-guards, but time will not 
admit of a discussion of that 
here. The announcement, how- 
ever, of the principle that gov- 
errnents derived their just powers 
from the consent of the governed, 
was a wide departure from the 
government by kings. It was des- 
tined to change the basis on which 
governments were supposed to 
rest — the divine authority of kings. 
The prevailing notion of govern- 
ment in the world at the time of 
our American Declaration of In- 
dependence was that political and 
civil rights were derived from 
kings ; and men esteemed them- 
selves bound by the customs and 
laws of antiquity. This declara- 
tion, however, makes every genera- 
tion of men their own masters, 
architects of their own political 
fortunes, masters of their own lib- 
erties. It takes civil government 
out of the hands of kings, and so far 
as civil government is concerned, 
out of the hands of priests also, and 
places it in the hands of the peo- 
ple. The people become soverign ; 
and those whom they elect to of- 
fice are not made rulers but ser- 
vants unto the people, to carry out 
their will according to the Constitu- 
tion and the laws of the land, even 
as Mosiah taught the ancient 
Nephites in the same manner and 
in the same spirit. These principles 
of civil liberty are marching 



110 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



through the world. They have 
given free institutions to the conti- 
nents of America, from the ice- 
bound North to the ice-bound 
South. These principles of govern- 
ment are established everywhere in 
the republics of the western world. 
The same truths are knocking at 
the doors of other nations. They 
have converted the ancient, ab- 
solute monarchy of Japan to a con- 
stitutional monarchy, wherein the 
voice of the people becomes a factor 
in determining the destiny of the 
country, and not the word or whim 
alone of the monarch. These princi- 
ples have given to France the most 
stable government she has ever 
known. These principles have en- 
larged the liberties of Englishmen, 
until today their freedom is sustained 
practically by "Manhood Suffrage." 
We witness from this distance a 
terrible struggle going on between 
the Russian people and the autocra- 
tic government pf that land. Sad 
failures, indeed the people have 
made of it as yet, but three times 
now they have exercised some 
measure of that sovereign power 
which our principles recognize 'as 
inherent in the people, and have 
elected their representatives tq the 
national assembly; and though pro- 
gress may be slow, still that knock- 
ing, still that persistent demand for 
the rights and liberties of the peo- 
ple in that land will go on until the 
"Law going forth from Zion" shall 
permeate all systems and bring 
freedom to the inhabitants of this 
earth. That, in part, is my under- 
standing of this idea that the Law 
shall go forth from Zion. God 
works not only by direct methods; 
He works also by indirect methods ; 
not only through the schools of the 
prophets, but once in a while He 
raises up a prophet that was not 



reared in the school of the prophets. 
Do not misunderstand me. Be- 
cause I believe that the purposes of 
God are being accomplished in the 
world now by his sending forth the 
"Law from Zion" in the indirect 
manner here described, — do not 
think that I believe that this will pre- 
clude the establishment of a future 
capital city of Zion from which the 
"law" shall continue to go forth; 
not only by the promulgation of 
these fundamental principles of 
civil government, on which depends 
the true freedom and dignity of 
man, but also, by the promul- 
gation of other great and im- 
portant laws pertaining to man's 
exaltation and glory. Not so. I 
would only impress upon you, if I 
cquld, the idea that the work of 
God now is in process of fulfill- 
ment, and that God's work is drawn 
on great, broad plans. That there 
is nothing narrow or contracted in 
His plans ; that He employs nations 
and empires as His agencies as well 
as individuals to work His sovereign 
will in bringing to pass the eternal 
life and joy of man; and this truth 
it is fitting that Latter-day Saints 
should recognize. 

What about the other part of 
this scripture so familiar to us: the 
Word of the Lord shall go forth 
from Jerusalem ? You must remem- 
ber in considering it that Isaiah was 
living in the seventh century be- 
fore Christ. I think if you modern- 
ize the expression of the ancient 
Jewish scripture the meaning, per- 
haps, would be more clear. I do 
not desire to take liberties with the 
written word of God, because I 
think that is meant to stand as the 
great land marks by which we must 
walk, and the teacher may not take 
liberties and change the terms of 
God' s word ; and without doing

Ill 



that, but for the purpose of convey- 
ing to you my thought on this sub- 
ject, suppose I were to read the pas- 
sage in this manner : "and the reve- 
lation of the Lord shall go forth 
from Jerusalem?" When we take 
into account the greatness of our 
own dispensation of the Gospel, I 
think sometimes we overlook the 
grandeur and the greatness of the 
"Dispensation of the Meridian of 
Times." It must always be remem- 
bered that the great Atonement, the 
central fact of the Gospel, was 
wrought out at Jerusalem; that 
there the sacrifice was made; that 
there the Son of God took upon 
Him our sins ; there our transgres- 
sions were laid upon Him, and by 
His stripes we are healed. The 
Atonement was made there, I say, 
and there, too, the grand, supreme 
revelation of God was made to the 
world for all time to come; for 
after the fact of the Atonement of 
Christ, the next thing in importance 
— if there is to be any degree as to 
importance between the two things 
— next in importance is the great 
truth, that Jesus Christ was the 
manifestation of God in the world ; 
the revelation of God to man; so 
that henceforth, above the horizon 
of men's vision, stands God per- 
fectly revealed in the person and 
character of Jesus Christ. And as 
He so stands — God revealed, — the 
clouds of error, superstition, and 
blackness of all the ages fall away ; 
for as the Christ is, so too is the 
Father, in person, in character, in 
mercy, in justice, and in all those 
qualities that enter into the divine 
nature. Moreover, Jesus in the 
scriptures is called emphatically 
"The Word," by which I under- 
stand is meant the expression, the 
revelation, of God. "And the Word 
was made flesh and dwelt among us, 



and we beheld his glory, the glory 
as of the only begotten of the Fath- 
er, full of grace and truth — " 
so that truly "The Word of the 
Lord," the revelation of what the 
Lord was and is, went forth from 
Jerusalem, even as "the law" is go- 
ing forth from Zion. As I said in 
reference to the future capital of 
the land of Zion, that the views 
here expressed did not preclude the 
idea of the future establishment of a 
capital city on the land of Zion from 
which the law will continue to go 
forth in those days, so I would not 
have you suppose that because I 
hold the view that "The Word of 
the Lord" has gone forth from 
Jerusalem in the revelation of "The 
Word," or expression of God in the 
person and character of Jesus of 
Nazareth — because I believe that 
the word of the Lord has gone 
forth from Jerusalem in the com- 
plete Gospel of Jesus Christ — that 
there was made the Atonement of 
Jesus Christ, the central truth of 
the Gospel; that there occurred the 
resurrection of Jesus, the Christ, on 
which is based our own hope and 
the hope of the world of resurrec- 
tion from the dead — do not, I 
pray you, because I hold that 
in these things the Word of 
the Lord has already gone forth 
from Jerusalem, suppose that I 
think that this will preclude any 
future going forth of the word of 
the Lord from Jerusalem that may 
be in the divine program. Jeru- 
salem must forever be a holy shrine, 
a place to which the eyes of all na- 
tions will turn for light and inspira- 
tion ; what more natural, then, than 
that it should become a holy city, 
the capital of the eastern world, if 
you will, the holy sanctuary whence 
shall issue the word of the Lprd in 
future even more abundantly than

in the past, even as the law shall go 
forth from Zion in the future as 
now and in the past? I am only 
pleading here for broad views con- 
cerning the things of God, and the 
ways of God. We Latter-day 
Saints do not want to contract our 
feelings, our sympathies, our opin- 
ions of the truth to the narrow 
limits of our own church fellow- 
ship ; but we must recognize that 
God does things on a broad scale, 
and that He is directing, and that 
He is influencing, by His Spirit, His 
children; and they will become 
more and more susceptible to the 
influence of the Gospel. I hope that 
we will become more and more 
skilfull in presenting it, that by rea- 
son of the operation of these two 
things — our increasing skill and the 
world's increasing susceptibility to 
its influence — Zion shall be enlarg- 
ed, and the Church of Christ shall 
be enlarged in her sympathies until 
we will stand locked fast in fel- 
lowship for righteousness with all 
the righteous men in all the world. 
Amen. 

The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn : 

Do what is right ; the day-dawn is break- 
ing, 

Hailing a future of freedom and light ; 
Angels above us are silent notes taking 
Of ev'ry action ; do what is right ! 

President Smith announced that 
the closing session of this Confer- 
ence will convene at 2 p. m.

Elder William McLachlan. 



CLOSING SESSION. 

In the Tabernacle, at 2 p. m. 
Pr^ident Joseph F. Smith called 
the meeting to order. 



The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn : 

Praise to the man who communed with 
Jehovah ! 

Jesus anointed that Prophet and Seer, 
Blessed to open the last dispensation ; 
Kings shall extol him and nations re- 
vere. 

Prayer was offered by Elder Mil- 
ton H. Welling. 

The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn : 

God moves in a mysterious way, 

His wonders to perform; 
He plants his footsteps in the sea, 

And rides upon the storm. 

ELDER RTJLON S. WELLS. 

My brethren and sisters, I do 
wish that I could occupy this re- 
sponsible position without that feel- 
ing of fear and trembling which 
comes over me when I am called 
upon to address this vast congrega- 
tion. I also hope that the Lord will 
be merciful and kind unto me. I 
trust that He will give me His fa- 
vor, that I may enjoy the influence 
of His Holy Spirt, for without that 
aid, I would indeed feel my weak- 
ness. 

I wish to bear testimony to the 
truths of the Everlasting Gospel. I 
endorse the testimonies that have 
been borne by my brethren who 
have preceded me in the various 
meetings of this General Confer- 
ence. I find myself strictly in ac- 
cord with their testimonies. I can 
endorse that which they have spok- 
en, for I feel that we have been fed 
the bread of life. The Gospel has 
been restored to the earth for the 
accomplishment of a wonderful 
work among the children of men. 
This great message which has been 
delivered through the Prophet Jos- 
eph Smith is for the salvation of all

men. It is a matter which will come 
to all our Father's children, either 
in this life, or in the life which is to 
come. The forces, the influences, 
and the workings of this Gospel 
must be felt by all of our Father's 
children ; it is an individual affair 
with each and every one of us. It 
therefore behooves the inhabitants 
of this earth to pay heed to the mes- 
sage, and there are none who will 
regret it, who do pay heed. Neith- 
er need they to feel that it is any 
condescension on their part, when 
they listen to the humble message 
of life and salvation. It is not any- 
thing that has been instituted by 
man for the purpose of self ag- 
grandizement. This work is a la- 
bor of love, of sacrifice, and of 
good-will towards men. It is for 
this purpose that it was established, 
— the saving of every soul, and 
none can be justified who will re- 
ject it, after the opportunity has 
been presented to receive it, and to 
benefit by its workings upon them. 

There are two things that are re- 
quired of all men who are formed 
and fashioned in the likeness of 
their great Creator ; and these two 
things are these : one is to learn to 
know the will of God, and the other 
is to do it. Therefore, every human 
being should feel that it is his duty 
to make it the effort of his life to 
find out what is the will of God ; and 
it cannot be found out unless peo- 
ple do put forth some effort. The 
great enemy of the Kingdom of 
God is indifference, and a lack of 
disposition to seek**and find, a lack 
of desire to know the truth, a lack 
of disposition to put forth the ef- 
fort, to ask, that we might receive. 
Surely, any individual blessed with 
intelligence ought not to feel any 
hesitancy whatever in making an 
effort to find out God, and to learn 



to know His will. If people do put 
forth this effort, it will be because 
they are yielding obedience to a 
fundamental principle of the Gos- 
pel which we proclaim; namely, 
faith in God, which will move us to 
action, and get us to appreciate the 
importance of knowing. 

If we have no desire to know it 
is because we love darkness rather 
than light, because we are satisfied 
to remain in ignorance, which is 
darkness, even that gross darkness 
that covers the minds of the people. 
But if we want to know, if we have 
in our hearts a desire to know, let 
us manifest that desire by putting 
forth the effort, and asking Him 
alone who can give the answer; 
namely, God, our eternal Father. 
And even though it should call upon 
us to bend the knee, why should we 
hesitate ? Is it not required of all of 
us that we should, in the presence of 
the Almighty One, be willing to 
humble ourselves before Him? 

We cannot evade the responsibil- 
ity of practicing these principles of 
life and salvation. We may exhort 
the inhabitants of the earth; we 
may, perchance, get many of them 
to start out upon this path of seek- 
ing to know the truth, but it should 
not end there. It behooves all those 
who have once planted their feet in 
the straight and narrow way, bv be- 
ginning to seek, that they might 
know the will of the Lord, to con- 
tinue to walk therein, by the con- 
stant and continued exercise of this 
principle of faith. As we grow in 
knowledge, that desire to know will 
still continue to grow within us, and 
we go on progressing in the knowl- 
edge of the Lord. Therein lies sal- 
vation, that we may grow in the 
knowledge of the truth, and that we 
learn to do the will of the Father. 

While it may be the exercise of 



114 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



faith which leads us to the knowl- 
edge of the truth, it is the exercise 
of the principle of repentance which 
teaches us to do. These are saving 
principles that the Lord has re- 
vealed. They are explained in Holy 
Writ ; they have been proclaimed by 
holy men, but if we never had re- 
ceived the revelations of the Lord, 
if they had not been handed down 
to us by the prophets who have 
lived in ages gone by, these truths 
would still stand and be the same. 
They appeal to the very nature of 
mankind ; without them, it is impos- 
sible to progress, and we each and 
every one of us have constant use 
and need for applying these princi- 
ples in our daily vocations, in our 
daily lives. 

The absence of light is darkness. 
By the continuation of growth in 
knowledge, which is the light of 
truth, the darkness will disappear, 
just as the darkness disappears 
from a building when we put into 
it the light. It should, therefore, 
be the ambition of Latter-day Saints 
to constantly struggle for the ac- 
quisition of light and knowledge, 
and truth. This can only be done 
in proportion to our faithfulness. 

These principles are called first 
principles, but to me, they are first 
principles and last principles. These 
fundamental principles of the Gos- 
pel of Jesus Christ are : faith in the 
Lord, Jesus Christ, repentance from 
sin, baptism by immersion, that 
principle by which we obtain a re- 
mission of sins ; and the securing of 
the Holy Spirit, by the laying on of 
hands. You have heard nothing 
else during the meetings of this 
Conference than different phases of 
these cardinal and fundamental 
principles. If we have heard some- 
thing regarding the law of temper- 
ance, the Word of Wisdom, what is 



it but one of, the practical applica- 
tions of the great law, that funda- 
mental principle of repentance from 
wrong doing? Is it not evil to do 
those things that are harmful to the 
body, those things that often de- 
stroy this temple, in which the Lord 
designs his Holy Spirit shall dwell ? 
What is the law of tithing? Peo- 
ple are required to pay their tithes 
and their offerings. And who is 
benefited most? The people them- 
selves, who observe to keep these 
laws and these commandments. 
They are most benefited for this 
reason : that it teaches them the ex- 
ercise of faith in God and confidence 
in His work. Their hearts are in 
sympathy and in touch with the 
great work which our Father has 
inaugurated in these last days. 
'They want to see Zion prosper; 
their hearts are in touch with that 
great work. They want to see the 
temples of God maintained; they 
want their children to be instructed 
in the ways of life and salvation ; 
they want their sons to go out into 
the mission field and deliver this 
message unto the people; and 
all of these things require sac- 
rifices, which they would not make 
if they did not have faith in God 
and in the triumph of His work. So 
we might apply it to every principle, 
to every requirement that is made 
of Latter-day Saints. It is found- 
ed on these fundamental principles. 
The first principles ? Yes, and the 
last principles, — always, eternal, 
and forever. We ought to appreci- 
ate them as the plan of life and sal- 
vation, whereby the children of God 
can be brought back into His pres- 
ence. And without observing them, 
no one can be saved. 

I rejoice in the -testimony of this 
work, for I know that the Lord is 
with us. I know that Joseph Smith 



ELDER J. GOLDEN KIMBALL. 



115 



is a prophet of God. I cannot pick 
up the book of Doctrine and Cove- 
nants and read a single revelation 
from the Lord, without feeling 
thrilled, and being convinced that 
this is the truth. 

In the opening address of Pres- 
ident Joseph F. Smith, he made a 
number of comments on different 
topics, and gave the keynote of this 
Conference, all of which was inter- 
esting to me, and met with my 
hearty aproval. When he finally 
came to bear his own testimony re- 
garding the divinity of the mission 
of the Prophet Joseph Smith, my 
whole being was filled with the 
spirit of testimony, and in my heart 
I said, "Amen." I know, too, and 
so should all Latter-day Saints 
know, when the spirit of inspiration 
is resting upon them, that this is the 
truth. The Spirit of the Lord will 
bear witness, that Joseph Smith is a 
prophet sent of the Lord. I ad- 
monish the people to carefully read 
the revelations as they are contain- 
ed in the book of Doctrine and 
Covenants, and ponder over them 
in your own hearts. No one can 
honestly read those revelations 
without being impressed that there 
is something in them, more than the 
power within men. This ability to 
know the truth, and this testimony 
which comes to us, is the result of 
the Spirit of God resting upon us ; 
and if we will only put ourselves 
in such a condition, that we can re- 
ceive the promptings of that Spirit, 
then we will grow in the knowledge 
of God day by day; and that we 
may do so is my prayer, in the name 
of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER J. GOLDEN KIMBALL. 

My life and labors are devoted 
to this work. While it is true that 



I have not been able to do my full 
and complete duty, because of my 
physical condition, yet I trust that 
my labors during the past fifteen or 
sixteen years have proven to this 
people, and to the brethren of the 
authorities, that I am loyal and 
patriotic to the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints. I have 
never been ashamed to testify to 
the divinity of this work, when I 
felt that I had the Spirit of God. 
I have held the name of the Pro- 
phet Joseph Smith as sacred. 
When I was in the mission field, 
I said to the Elders: whenever 
you are moved upon by the Spirit 
of God, and! the spirit of testi- 
mony, you are to testify that Jos- 
eph Smith is a Prophet of God, 
and I promise you it will make you 
all the trouble you can bear. I 
have never been afraid of the 
world, nor the children of men, 
when I have enjoyed the Holy 
Spirit. 

I look over my past labors in the 
ministry, and I discover there 
were some things that I didn't 
know. I find at times that I have 
been over zealous ; in fact, I be- 
lieve that I have been almost fan- 
atical, that I have said and done 
things that I now wish I hadn't. 
I have heard this, my brethren and 
sisters, and I am in no doubt about 
it: that I hold the Holy Melchi- 
zedek Priesthood, the High Priest- 
hood ; I am a Seventy- Apostle. I 
don't think I lack any Priesthood. 
I don't think there is anything in 
this Church to be done that I can't 
do, if the proper authorities tell 
me to do it, but there are many 
things they don't tell me to do, so 
I let it alone. It has taken me a 
long time to learn to mind my own 
business, to look after my own de- 
partment, and not try to interfere 



116 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



with Bishops or with Presidents of 
Stakes in their labors. I wish they 
all would learn the same lesson. 

Now, I am an officer — a sort of 
a lieutenant — in the army of the 
Lord. We have a large body of 
Priesthood who have been given 
advantages and opportunities that 
Seventies never had in the early 
history of the Church. There is a 
possibility of doing a great and 
good work; and we have made a 
great effort, under the instructions 
of the Presidency and Twelve 
Apostles, to place these Seventies 
in a condition that they can repre- 
sent the Church Of Jesus Christ as 
witnesses of the Lord. I realize, 
brethren, that the Bishops of the 
wards have to look after their 
wards ; the Presidencies of the 
stakes have to look after their 
work; and the supply of capable 
men is depleted owing to their be- 
ing absorbed in many organiza- 
tions. Whenever they find efficient 
capable men they take them to build 
up their work; but I want to ask 
you, in the name of all consistency, 
please don't take all the able men, 
or the greater part of them, and 
leave us only raw recruits to send 
into the world to preach this Gos- 
pel. I want to say to you Latter- 
day Saints, if you think your in- 
experienced boys can go out and 
disturb the wjorld, you are mis- 
taken. When I was in the South, 
the people paid but little more at- 
tention to us than if we were fice 
dogs. If ever I locked horns with 
anybody it was with some poor 
clergyman in the woods. Elder 
John Morgan used to tell us — and 
I honor his memory; I love him 
as I love few men — he used to tell 
us : "Boys, don't go into the cities, 
if you do, it may cost you your 



lives ;" and we stayed out. But it 
is different now. 

I have been in California for a 
few weeks, and I tell you I am in 
sympathy with Elder Robinson, and 
my heart goes out to the Elders. If 
I had been called upon in Ocean 
Park to stand before the intelligent 
class of people there, I don't know 
what I would have said. We need 
intelligence, and pure knowledge, 
to preach the Gospel to the nations 
of the earth. 

I desire to read a little extract 
from "Impressions," by Charles 
Erskine Scott Wood: 

"Where any number of men are gath- 
ered together, there are sure to be some 
better than others ; some more rational, 
and some less intelligent than others. 
There are good lawyers and bad law- 
yers, intellectual doctors and stupid doc- 
tors, [I have learned that in the last 
three years] wise clergymen and foolish 
clergymen. In short, as the mass of hu- 
manity in any one place and time will 
contain both extremes and all shades of 
humanity, so any considerable portion of 
the mass will contain various examples 
of the good, bad, and indifferent. There- 
fore, it is not proper to judge of any 
general class or organization of men by 
some few particular individuals, either 
good or bad. The question is : What 
is the average character, and what is its 
general influence, taken as a whole, and 
through the course of years. And 
though an institution on the hill may be 
a power for good, yet if it exhibits some 
special attraction for the narrow and 
intolerant, that is certainly a fault." 

I am trying to be wise, and I am 
trying to be prudent, and I confess 
to you I am having a terrible time. 
It is old men for counsel, young 
men for war. I believe I am a bet- 
ter warrior than I am a counselor. 
I have been away from home, and 
the first thing I picked up Was an 
anti-"Mormon" newspaper, and I 
am sorry I picked it up. What did 
I find in it? I found they were try- 



ELDER J. GOLDEN KIMBALL. 



117 



ing to prove that President Brig- 
ham Young and my father were 
murderers, and that they taught 
that as a principle ! Now, I say 
it is unjust. I say it is unkind. I 
say it is improper. But what are 
we going to do ? Why, we are not 
going to do anything; but I often 
feel it is wrong for us to be hushed 
into silence. 

This work is true. The character 
of this people is a marvel to me, 
and it has a pathetic side to it. I 
have traveled among this people 
from Mexico to Canada, and I 
know whereof I speak. I say to 
the young and rising generation: 1 
am willing to take off my hat to 
these horny-handed, white-headed 
broken-down men who have made it 
possible for us to exist in this moun- 
tain country. I say God bless these 
aged men. If you want examples,any 
object lessons, go down to Saint 
George and see what it has cost to 
settle that country. It is a number 
of years since I was there, but I 
found ninety widows. Some of the 
best men in the whole earth have 
died to make that country habitable. 
Then I would like to take you on a 
trip down to Arizona, in the St. 
Johns country. I preached Faith 
there once, but I want to tell you I 
haven't got enough faith to stay in 
such an undesirable country. You 
talk about good people ; you talk 
about righteous people; I tell you 
there are people in this city who are 
not worthy to unlatch their shoe- 
strings. That hard country, and 
their obedience to the Priesthood of 
God, has made those men great 
characters. You can't discourage 
■them. They will build a dam across 
the Colorado River every five 
years, if it washes out the next day ; 
and live on dry bread and molasses 
Yet, that is their home ; that is their 



country; there they worship God. 
Then you go up in the Big Horn 
country, then up into Canada, and 
then think what it has cost to make 
this country what it is. But, every 
time some of us weak-kneed young 
fellows encounter a difficulty we 
break for the woods, and we give 
up our rights and sell them for a 
little pottage. I tell you that the 
Almighty is not pleased with some 
of the rising generation. They 
stick up their noses at these homely 
men. It is such .homely men and 
women of character who have made 
this country, and this Church, what 
it is today, and I say God bless 
them. 

Brethren, I want to call your at- 
tention to one thing ; I am a sort of 
transgressor. My father died when 
I was fifteen years old. I have not 
committed any crimes, but there are 
some things in my history that I 
regret. Environment has a great 
deal to do with a man, and men who 
have colonized these outlying dis- 
tricts do not look upon some habits 
as seriously as men who have never 
indulged in them; if they did, it 
would be an injustice to themselves. 
You never saw a man in your life 
do a wrong thing, who was happy 
over it. You never saw men violate 
a commandment of God and feel 
jubilant over it, but if they have the 
Spirit of the Lord they feel miser- 
able. I say to you Latter-day 
Saints, and I say it to myself : I 
have preached this Gospel for fif- 
teen years, and I now understand 
the doctrine of repentance. A man 
can't repent simply because an Ap- 
ostle tells him to repent; he can't 
do it until he gets the spirit of re- 
pentance, which is a gift from God ; 
and some of us don't get it very 
quickly. Some of us don't get the 
spirit of repentance and see things 



118 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



right until our hair is gray. Breth- 
ren, let us be tolerant ; let us be 
kind and considerate. It is the prop- 
er thing to despise sin and wicked- 
ness ; but I think it is wrong to 
despise the man that has a weak- 
ness, and make him feel that he is 
good for nothing, and that there is 
not much chance for him. I think 
I can safely say to you Latter-day 
Saints : You will all be saved, every 
one of you ; the only difference will 
be this, some will be saved sooner 
than others. Every man that has 
transgressed and done wrong must 
pay the penalty of his transgres- 
sion, for salvation costs something, 
and you have to pay the price or 
you don't get it. 

While I was in Venice, Cali- 
fornia, or Ocean Park, I saw three 
great battle-ships, the Wisconsin,the 
Tennessee and the California. I had 
the privilege of going on board the 
Tennessee. They left Venice on 
Friday morning at ten o'clock, and 
I saw those beautiful war vessels 
leave the harbor. I had not been 
on the pier long when I noticed a 
young man, called a jackie, one of 
the boys of the Tennessee. He was 
looking longingly over the ocean 
at those retreating ships. I asked 
him why he was not with the ships,' 
and he said : "I was fifteen minutes 
late." I asked him : "What will they 
do with you? What are you going 
to do ? Why don't you take the rail- 
road and run up to a station where 
they will stop, and get on your war 
vessel?" He said: "O, it don't 
make any difference, I will go down 
to San Pedro and get on the Da- 
kota, and they will place me in 
chains and feed me on bread and 
water; but" said he, "I had a 
mighty good time." He had had a 
good time at Los Angeles, but he 
was fifteen minutes late, and accord- 



ing to his story he was to be dis- 
ciplined, and he was to eat bread 
and water, and be placed in chains. 
I asked him what he did it for, and 
he said : "Well now, look here Mis- 
ter, I did it and it is done, and I am 
trying to get a little sunshine out 
of this thing." That was a knock- 
down argument and I never said 
another word. If he could get any 
sunshine out of it I was willing for 
the poor fellow to have it. 

Now, brethren, let us be kind 
and considerate for each other. 

The Lord bless you. Amen. 

Elders John W. Summerhays and 
Noel S. Pratt sang, as a duet, the 
hymn beginning: 

The morning breaks, the shadows flee; 

Lo! Zion's standard is unfurled. 
The dawning of a brighter day 

Majestic rises on the world. 



ELDER JOSEPH W. M'MURRIN. 

My brethren and sisters, I feel to 
thank the Lord, with all my soul, 
that my father and mother heard the 
glad sound of the everlasting Gos- 
pel, many years ago in a far off 
land, that their souls were pricked 
by the power of God, and that they 
were made to understand the truth 
of the message which was commu- 
nicated to them by a humble mis- 
sionary of the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints. I say, 
I thank God that they heard that 
message,that they yielded obedience 
to the truth, and that they gathered 
with the people of the Lord to these 
mountain valleys. I feel very grate- 
ful to them for my birth in the midst 
of the people of the Lord. I honor 
their memory this day for the exam- 
ple they set before me and for their 



ELDER JOS. IV. McMURRIN. 



119 



anxiety concerning my life, that I 
might have faith in the message that 
brought them from the land of their 
nativity. 

My soul has been filled with grat- 
itude as I have listened to the tes- 
timonies of the servants of the 
Lord concerning this work — its 
greatness, its breadth, its strength 
and beauty, and the evidences that 
abound of the power of God that is 
in it. 

I have wondered, my brethren 
and sisters, if we appreciate the 
blessings that have come to each of 
us, as individuals, as a result of 
hearing the sound of this Gospel; 
and if we comprehend what "Mor- 
monism" stands for. We ofttimes 
hear remarks made regarding what 
men and women have done for 
"Mormonism," and yet I suppose it 
is true that "Mormonism" has done 
more for every soul, who has been 
convinced of its truth, than it is pos- 
sible for any man to do for it. As 
we have heard during the meetings 
of this Conference, "Mormonism" 
is the power of God unto salvation ; 
it embraces the truths of the Gos- 
pel of the Redeemer of men, re- 
vealed anew. 

I have been impressed with the 
fact that men from various nations 
have occupied this pulpit, bearing 
testimony to the truth of this work, 
and I do not suppose that we have 
discovered one particle of difference 
in the spirit that has actuated those 
who have spoken. They may have 
seen the light of day, in mortality, 
in Scandinavia, or in England, or 
in these United States of America, 
but "Mormonism," by the wonder- 
ful power that is in it, has brought 
to each one the very same spirit, 
and they have testified of the truth 
of this work by the same power and 
under the same inspiration. As I 



have looked over the immense gath- 
erings of this Conference, I have 
been reminded of the fact, as we 
ofttimes hear it expressed in one of 
the anthems, that God has gathered 
His flock from afar, from the na- 
tions of men throughout the earth. 

There has been ringing in my 
ears a passage of scripture, where- 
in we are told that our Father in 
Heaven has decreed that He would 
gather His servants and His hand- 
maidens — one of a city, two of a 
family, and bring them to Zion. He 
declared that He would give them 
pastors after His own heart who 
should feed them with knowledge 
and with understanding ; and I sup- 
pose the same feeling has been in 
your bosoms as in minej that God 
has accomplished and performed 
the thing which He promised by the 
mouths of His ancient prophets. We 
are not being fed with husks, but we 
are being fed with the kernel of the 
Gospel ; and we have come to feel, 
in the testimonies of these men who 
stand as presiding authorities of the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints, that they have in very 
deed the word of life to give to the 
people. Are we prepared to receive 
it? Are we acquainted with the in- 
spiration of the Spirit of the Lord ? 
Do we recognize the voice of the 
Good Shepherd? Do we know, by 
the Spirit that is in us, that we have 
been taught as the Lord would have 
us taught, and not according to the 
wisdom of men alone? I believe in 
the doctrine, taught of the Father 
in one of the revelations, where He 
directed His servants in the preach- 
ing of the Gospel, that they should 
speak as they were moved upon by 
the power of the Holy Spirit. He 
promised that whatsoever they 
spoke when they were moved by 
that Holy Spirit, should be the word 



120 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



of the Lord, the power of the Lord, 
and the very doctrines of the Gospel 
unto salvation. If we have recog- 
nized that Spirit in the words that 
have been spoken and in the testi- 
monies that have been delivered, we 
will not go away from this confer- 
ence questioning the counsels that 
have been given unto us; but we 
will go away impressed with the 
feeling that with the help of our 
Father in Heaven, we will endeavor 
to put into practice the counsels 
that have been imparted. We should 
feel that, so far as in us lies, we 
will give to this work and to our 
God the best that there is in us. God 
requires it of us. This great work, 
that has been spoken of so eloquent- 
ly, demands of every man, who has 
put his hand to the plow, that he 
shall work with a will, that he shall 
stand solidly for this work, and 
that it shall be known of all men 
just where he stands and what can 
be expected of him. 

I believe in this work. I know 
it is the power of God. It has filled 
my soul with peace and joy and 
happiness. It has filled me with 
hope, as it has filled you with hope, 
and I testify with my brethren con- 
cerning its truth, concerning its 
power, concerning the salvation 
that is in it ; and I ask men every- 
where to give attention to these 
glorious truths, for they have been 
revealed by our Father for the 
blessing of the human race. 

God bless you, my brethren and 
sisters, and God help us to be true 
to this work, true to the covenants 
we have made, true to our brethren, 
I pray, through Jesus Christ. Amen. 

PRESIDENT SMITH. 

We wish now to present before 
the Conference the report of the 



Auditing Committee, as we think 
this report will contain information 
that you will be pleased to receive. 
I will call upon Heber J. Grant to 
read it, as his voice is clear and can 
be heard in this building. (Report 
read.) 

Elder Heber J. Grant read the an- 
nual report of the Auditing Com- 
mittee of the Church, as follows : 

"We, the undersigned, members 
of the Church auditing committee, 
beg leave to report as follows : 

"We have carefully audited the 
financial reports of the Trustee-in- 
Trust, Presiding Bishop, the latter 
comprehending the Presiding Bish- 
op's, Office, 56 stakes of Zion and 
21 missions in the world; also the 
Deseret News and the L. D. S. hos- 
pital for the year 1907. The said 
reports we found to be very full and 
complete in every essential, show- 
ing care and accuracy in the work 
done, and we were highly gratified 
with the systematic, thorough and 
businesslike manner in which the 
accounts of the Church were kept. 

"In view of the financial strin- 
gency and depression of business 
interests last fall, almost resulting in 
a panic, we are happy to reoort that 
there is a substantial increase in the 
total amount of tithing paid for the 
year 1907 over and above that paid 
for 1906. The Latter-day Saints 
are to be commended for their faith- 
fulness in the observance of the law 
of the Lord. 

"In our examination of the report 
we noted with pleasure the fact that 
generous aid was extended by the 
Trustee-in-Trust to the worthy 
poor, Church schools, stake and 
ward meetinghouses, mission main- 
tenance, Latter-day Saints' hospital 
maintenance and improvements, and

PRESIDENT RICHARD W. YOUNG. 

Apropos the reading of the report 
of the Auditing Committee of the 
Church, to which we have just lis- 
tened, I desire to submit, for the 
consideration of the Conference, a 
couple of resolutions. It was stat- 
ed at the General Priesthood Meet- 
ing that this report would be given 
here, and anticipating the reading 
of it I have prepared these resolu- 
tions which speak for themselves. 
They express my very earnest con- 
victions, and I am satisfied will 
speak the sentiments of all the 
members of the Church. The reso- 
lutions are as follows : 

"Resolved, That the report of the 
Church Auditing Committee, to 
which we have just listened, be re- 
ceived and approved, and that a 
vote of thanks be and the same is 
hereby extended to Elders Rudger 
Clawson, William W. Riter, Aug- 
ust W. Carlson and Henry H. Ro- 
lapp for the intelligent and thor- 
ough manner in which they have 
performed the gratuitous labor of 
their office ; and be it further 

Resolved, That the Church in 
conference assembled expresses its 
full and unqualified confidence in 
the financial integrity, judgment 
and fidelity to trust of the Trustee- 
in-Trust and presiding brethren, to 
whose discretion' under the consti- 
tution and order of the -Church, is 



entrusted the control and distribu- 
tion of its revenues and properties." 

Elder Young moved the adoption 
of these two resolutions ; the motion 
was seconded by Elder Wm". H. 
Seegmiller, and was carried by 
unanimous vote of the congrega- 
tion.

PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 

(CLOSING REMARKS.) 

Invokes Heaven's blessings upon the 
members of the Church, and the peo- 
ple of the world. 

We have now approached the 
time for the closing of our Seventy- 
Eighth Annual Conference; and in 
conclusion, I desire to express my 
heartfelt gratitude to God for Hi's 
signal blessings, during) the ses- 
sions of our conference. The 
weather has been propitious, health- 
ful, beautiful, and in every way 
suitable to our need. I presume 
there has been a larger attendance 
at each session than we have had at 
any former conference of the 
Church. I feel grateful to my 
brethren and sisters who have been 
in attendance, and I desire to ex- 
press my heartfelt blessing upon 
every soul who has come to this 
conference with a desire to promote 
the well being and happiness of 
others, and who has desired to see 
righteousness and peace prevail. I 
thank you for your presence. 

I feel to bless my brethren who 
are acting in the important cal- 
ling of presidents of the various 
stakes of Zion, on whom rest such 
great responsibilities, standing as 
they do at the head of these stake 
organizations of the Church as 
fathers and counselors to the peo- 
ple. May the Lord bless their coun- 



PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH.

selors and the members of the vari- 
ous High Councils of the Church 
who are present. I invoke the 
special blessings of God our Fath- 
er upon you, my brethren, that you 
may be filled, one and all, with the 
spirit of your callings; that you 
may have the gifts of wisdom and 
perfect discernment, that you may 
be just judges in Israel, and righte- 
ous counselors among the people, 
that all may see that you are indeed 
the servants of God and true 
representatives of His work in the 
earth. 

I pray God to bless the Bishops 
and their counselors and all those 
who are acting in the Lesser Priest- 
hood ; may the spirit of their call- 
ings rest upon them. May our 
Bishops move forward in their 
great spiritual and temporal mis- 
sion and in the future so far as 
possible, give employment to the 
youth of Zion. Find something for 
them to do that will give them an 
opportunity to gain knowledge and 
experience in good works that will 
be beneficial to the cause of Zion 
and to themselves. I trust they will 
not forget this. 

I invoke the blessing of the Lord 
upon the various quorums of the 
Priesthood, the Seventies, the High 
Priests, the Elders, and upon the 
Patriarchs in the midst of Zion, that 
the spirit of their callings may rest 
upon them henceforth and for- 
ever. May they all be true men, 
true to their covenants, true to their 
God, true to themselves, true to the 
state and nation of which we are a 
part. 

I desire to invoke the blessings 
of the Lord also upon all the auxil- 
iary organizations of the Church, 
that the spirit of their missions may 
rest abundantly and fruitfully up- 
on them, that they will accomplish 
the greatest possible good in the 



spheres in which they act in the 
Church. 

I pray God to bless all our friends 
throughout the land and in all the 
world. May He bless and have 
mercy upon our enemies. May He 
open their eyes and their under- 
standing, that they may compre- 
hend the nature of the course they 
are taking and what it will result 
in to themselves at last. May the 
Lord have pity upon and turn them 
from their folly and the error of 
their way, and lead them into paths 
of peace and righteousness. 

I want to express my apprecia- 
tion of the labors of Brother Evan 
Stephens, Brother John J. McClel- 
lan and their assistants, also of the 
devotion of the members of the 
choir who have been able to at- 
tend during the conference, and 
others who have given us the bene- 
fit of their talent and skill. We 
thank them for their service. God 
bless our choir. May God bless 
Brother Evan Stephens, a man full 
of the love of truth, full of the 
spirit of song, devoted to the cause 
of Zion, a man who is wedded to 
his profession and his work, striv- 
ing for the uplifting of the child- 
ren of Zion. May the Lord bless 
him for it, and I hope by and by, 
when he gets old enough he will 
grow large enough to get wedded 
to a good wife as well as to music. 

I ask the Lord to bless all Zion — 
may He bless you as husbands and 
wives, as fathers and mothers, as 
parents and children. May the bless- 
ings of peace, life and health 
abound in all your abiding places. 

I ask these blessings, my brethren 
and sisters, upon you one and all, 
in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn :

gation at all the conference meet- 
ings in the Tabernacle, and Prof.

LATTER-DAY SAINTS. 



FIRST DAY. 



The 'Seventy-fifth Annual Confer- 
ence Of the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Later-day Saints convened in the Tab- 
ernacle, Salt Lake City, at 10 a. m. 
on Thursday, April 6, 1905, President 
Joseph F. Smith presiding. 

THE PROCEEDINGS. 

There were present of the general 
authorities: Of the First Presidency, 
Joseph F. Smith, John R. Winder and 
Anthon H. Lund; of the Council of the 
Twelve Apostles, Francis M. Lyman, 
Rudger Clawson, Hyrum M. Smith, 
George A. Smith, Charles W. Penrose; 
Presiding Patriarch John Smith; First 
Seven Presidents of Seventies, Seymom

Reynolds, J. Golden Kimball, Rulon S. 
Wells and Joseph W. McMurrin; of 
the presiding Bishopric, William B. 
Preston, Robert T. Burton and Orrin P. 
Miller. There were also a large number 
of presidents of stakes, their counsel- 
ors, presidents of missions, and other 
prominent men of the Priesthood. 

The services were commenced by the 
choir and congregation singing the 
hymn which begins: 
Redeemer of Israel, our only delight, 

On whom for a blessing we call; 
Our shadow by day, and our pillar by 
night, 

Our King, our Deliv'rer, our all! 



The opening prayer was offered by 
Elder Henry W. Naisbitt. 
Singing by the choir: 

Come, dearest Lord, descend and dwell, 
By faith and love, in every breast; 
Then shall we know and taste, and 
feel, 

The joys that cannot be expressed. 

PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 

(Opening address.) 

Condition of General Contentment Among 
the Latter-day Saints.— What Tithing 
is Used For.— Unhealthy Exeresences 
Must be Removed.— Zion is Establish- 
ed, and Will Remain.— The Church Not 
Led by Man.— The Lord Has Mads 
the Nation Great. 

My Brethren and Sister — It is cer- 
tainly a great satisfaction and pleas- 
ure to me to see this large assembly 
of Latter-day Saints, gathered here cn 
the opening day of our seventy-fifth 
annual conference. I am pleased to 
see you and meet with you; and with 
the blessings of the Lord and the guid- 
ing influence of His Holy Spirit I trust 
that I shall also be pleased in the op- 
portunity afforded me at this moment 
of speaking to you for a short time. I 
feel exceedingly dependent upon the 
promptings of the Spirit to my mind. 
You may think it strange for me to 
say that I have had no moments to 
bestow upon any forethought with 
reference to what I shall say to you 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



this morning. I stand before you 
without premeditation or forethought 
as to what I shall say. 

I believe that I can say to 
you with all confidence that so far as 
my knowledge extends, the Latter- 
day Saints throughout this inter- 
mountain region and the adjoining 
country, and so far as I know 
throughout the world, are in excellent 
spiritual condition. I believe that the 
Latter-day Saints enjoy as much today 
of the true spirit of their religion 
as they ever have enjoyed; I believe 
there is as much union among our peo- 
ple throughout the length and breadth 
of the land as has ever existed in the 
Church. I think I can confidently say 
that there are as few local difficulties 
and troubles among the people, com- 
ing before the Church courts, before 
the Bishops and before the High Coun- 
cils, as I have ever kno wn before within 
the scope of my remembrance and 
knowledge. We are perhaps never en- 
tirely free from little misunderstand- 
ings among neighbors and members 
of the Church one place or another, 
and it is often the case that 
these little misunderstandings, arising 
among our brothers and sisters, are 
brought before the teachers and per- 
haps before the Bishops for adjudica- 
tion and reconciliation, but I think I 
will be justified in saying, and that the 
truth will verify the same, that within 
my knowledge and according to my 
best understanding, there never was, 
since I can remember, any less of these 
little misunderstandings and difficulties 
than exist today. Indeed I may say 
that misunderstandings have been far 
more pronounced in years that have 
gone by than they appear to be now. 

I believe that there is a feeling of 
general contentment among the Latter- 
day Saints, and of satisfaction in their 
minds and hearts with reference to the 
divine mission of the Prophet Joseph 
Smith and to the divinity of the great 
mission and atonement of our Lord 
and Savior Jesus Christ. In other 
words I believe that the Latter-day 
Saints are today as devoted, fer- 
vent and firm in their convictions of 



the truth and in their knowledge there- 
of, as they ever have been at any 
period of the Church's history from its 
beginning down to the present time. 
I believe that these statements can be 
seconded and vouched for by the pre- 
siding authorities of the Church 
throughout the length and breadth of 
the land. We have these brethren here 
before us, — presidents of stakes and 
their counselors, the Bishops and their 
counselors and the presidents of our 
various missions; and I am satisfied 
that they will, one and all, verify the 
statements that I have made with ref- 
erence to the present condition of the 
Church. 

Not only is this so, but I believe that 
the time has never been when the 
financial, or the temporal condition, of 
the Latter-day Saints was better or 
more encouraging than at the present. 
I believe that our people are generally 
prosperous and I am satisfied that 
there is still greater prosperity in store 
for them through their continued faith- 
fulness. I believe that the Lord will 
bless the earth for their sake, that He 
will temper the elements for their good, 
that He will prosper them in the labor 
of their hands and in the thoughts of 
their minds; that He will guide them 
by the power of His Spirit into all truth 
and into the possession of those tem- 
poral blessings that are so necessary to 
make a people happy, contented and 
blessed in the land. With reference to 
this matter I desire to say that we 
have I believe a very correct criterion 
by which to judge the spiritual and 
temporal condition of the Church. The 
records of the Church will show at the 
closing of the accounts for the past 
year that the tithing and the offer- 
ings of the Latter-day Saints have been 
a little above what would be called the 
average. We have had one or two more 
prosperous years in the past judging by 
this criterion, the tithings of the 
people, but last year was a little 
above the average, notwithstanding the 
fact that during the last few years our 
people in many parts of the country 
have been suffering from a protracted 
drouth, in which they have come short 



PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH.

in their crops, and have suffered mater- 
ially in their flocks and in their herds. 
In many places the drouth has been so 
severe that the people have been under 
the necessity of borrowing- means with 
which to secure for themselves seed 
grain for the present year. I want to 
say to you, my brethren and sisters, 
and especially to those who preside over 
the Church, that it Is a matter of pride 
and of satisfaction to my mind that 
the Church is in a condition to assist 
those that are in need of this kind of 
assistance, and we have done so. If 
anyone should feel dissatisfied with the 
action of the Trustee-in-Trust and his 
counselors and associates in extend- 
ing aid to the Latter-day Saints in 
such matters of extremity as this, they 
know where to make their com- 
plaints, and I should be glad to meet 
them and consider these questions. 
We wish it distinctly understood that 
while the Lord preserves us in the po- 
sitions to which we have been called, 
the positions which we did not seek, 
but which, by the providence of God, 
have been brought upon us, we will 
hold ourselves responsible before God 
and before His people to render ma- 
terial and financial aid to the Saints 
in every direction where we feel 
that it is necessary to do so. Our peo- 
ple in the south have been unfortunate 
to some extent in having their 
dams washed away by floods. For a 
long series of years they have had 
drouth, the earth became parched 
and dry, and when the late rains and 
floods came they washed away some of 
their dams, and the people sent up 
their cries to us for help, and we have 
helped them. We thank God that we 
are in a position to help them, and so 
far as I am concerned I would be pleas- 
ed if I could know that every dollar of 
the tithing that I pay to the Church is 
employed in some good work of 
this kind by which the Saints 
are strengthened in building up Zion, in 
establishing their settlements and in 
"holding the fort" if you please. 

In addition to this I am happy to 
say to this congregation and to all the 
world so far as my words may go, that 



we have taken the liberty, and we have 
taken pride, and still feel proud of the. 
opportunity that has been afforded us, 
and of the ability that we have 
possessed to accomplish it — to ren- 
der aid to many of our mis- 
sions abroad in the purchase and in 
the establishment of mission headquar- 
ters and the building of churches In 
which they can meet to worship God, 
and to which they will not be ashamed 
to invite the stranger to come and join 
with them. We have used some of the 
tunings of the people for this purpose, 
and we think that when the 
Church desires to call us to an 
account for matters of this kind there is 
a way by which they can reach it 
which will not occasion any noise or 
confusion and I trust without any 
misunderstanding whatever. I be- 
lieve we can come to a per- 
fect understanding with reference to 
these matters. We have been able, too, 
to purchase quite a tract of land in 
Jackson county adjacent to the site 
that was chosen by the Prophet Jos- 
eph Smith for a temple, to be built 
some day; and some few of our people 
have generously contributed specially 
for the accomplishment of this purpose, 
but the most of the means that have 
been employed for the accomplishment 
of this object have necessarily been 
taken from the general tithing funds of 
the Church. By this means also we 
have been able to secure elegant head- 
quarters for our people in the 
Northern States mission; we have 
been able to assist the Southern 
States mission to obtain headquarters; 
and we have also been enabled to assist 
the British mission to obtain a comfor- 
table home and headquarters, where 
the "Star" that has been published for 
so many years, can continue to be pub- 
lished for the advancement of the work 
of the Latter-day Saints and of the 
Elders in the British mission. We 
have been able to assist largely 
in the erection of a commodious 
house of worship in Copenhagen, Den- 
mark, also In Christiania, Norway, and 
also in Stockholm, Sweden; and we 
have assisted also in obtaining head-

quarters for our people who live upon 
many of the islands of the sea. 
We have secured a tract of land upon 
the Islands of Samoa for the purpose of 
gathering- our Saints where they can 
receive the benefits of Church organiza- 
tion, the benefits of Sunday schools, 
Mutual Improvement associations and 
Sabbath worship, and where they can 
be taught the arts of industry and self- 
support. We have assisted our people 
in Australia and New Zealand in a 
similar way. And withall we have met 
more than one-half of the bonded in- 
debtedness of the Church; and we are 
in a condition, when the time shall be 
ripe for it, provided the Saints con- 
tinue to meet their obligations in their 
tithes and offerings, to pay off the 
remaining portion of the Church in- 
debtedness; when, I trust, by the bless- 
ings of the Almighty, the Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints 
will see a day in which it will be ab- 
solutely free from debt and under ob- 
ligation to no man; and it will not be 
long before this consummation is real- 
ized if we continue our work in the 
future as we have done it in the past. 

Now, my brethren and sisters, it is 
not my purpose to continue my re- 
marks very long. I desired briefly 
to refer to these matters of which I 
have spoken, and it just occurs to my 
mind that in addition to the few things 
I have named — and I have not named 
them all — that it would be very pro- 
per for me to state that the Church 
with a very small assistance from the 
estate of Dr. William H. Groves, has 
teen able to erect a first-class, well 
appointed hospital in this city, fire 
proof in every way, and equal to the 
best that can probably be found in 
any part of the world. We have been 
found fault with for this, that is to 
say, we have been charged with (hesi- 
tating) — pardon me if I do not mention 
that, it is too small a matter. How- 
ever, we have cranks, you know, 
among the Latter-day Saints as well 
as among the people of the world; and 
every once in a while you come across 
an individual who is all one-sided, who 
can only see out of one eye and out of a 



very small corner of the one eye, too, 
who is not capable of comprehending 
more than one thing at a time, who 
selects a certain little hobby — a certain 
little idea, a single thought, and strad- 
dles that idea and that single thought 
and commences to ride it, and it is im- 
possible to unhorse him from his hobby, 
because his mind is not capable of 
grasping more than that single 
little thought. We have such individ- 
uals as that, and it was from one of 
these individuals, one of these cranks, 
that we received not long ago 
solemn objection to the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints put- 
ting any of its means or tithing into a 
hospital. It was wicked and wrong 
to build hospitals according to his idea. 
Well, we will let such people go for 
what they are worth; they are 
scarcely worth noticing, and I feel that 
I should not have noticed it at all; 
but we have such individuals among 
us more or less. We have a variety 
of curiously formed creatures rising 
up amongst us occasionally, wbo 
are filled with the spirit of evil and 
hatred towards the truth and the peo- 
ple of God. It is only natural that 
this should be so. 

It has occurred to me somewhat in 
this way; that the body of the Church 
is likened to the body of a man, and 
you know men do sometimes get their 
systems a little deranged — that is to 
say, sometimes they are flea-bitten. 
Fleas bite them and mosquitoes bite 
them and cause little swellings to rise 
on their faces and hands. Sometimes 
they have boils upon them, and car- 
buncles, sebaceous tumors and other 
excresences, that only need the applica- 
tion of the lance to let out the humor 
from them or to excise them from the 
bcdy, or cut them off and let them go, 
so that the body may be cleansed from 
their poisonous effects. It is so with the 
Church. From time to time there are 
characters who become a law unto 
themselves and they follow the bent of 
their own "sweet will" until they get 
themselves into a condition mentally 
and spiritually that they become a 
menace to the body ecclesiastic. In other 



PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 



words, they become like a boil, tumor or 
carbuncle on the body, and you have to 
call in the surgeon to apply the knife to 
cut them out, that the body may be 
cleansed from them; and this has been 
the case from the beginning. 

From time to time these conditions 
arise and we have them to meet, and 
they will continue to arise from time to 
time, and we shall have them to 
meet; but they will never amount 
to more than a pimple or a little 
sore on the surface of the body, and no 
one need to be alarmed at all for the 
consequences. Zion is established in 
the midst of the earth to remain. It 
is God Almighty's work, which He 
Himself, by His own wisdom, and not 
by the wisdom of man, has restored to 
the earth in the latter days, and He 
has established it upon principles of 
truth and righteousness, of purity of 
life and revelation from God, that it 
can no more be thrown down nor left 
to another people, so long as the major- 
ity of the Church of Jesus Christ of Lat- 
ter-day Saints will abide in their 
covenants with the Lord and will keep 
themselves pure and unspotted from 
the world, as all members of the Church 
should keep themselves. Then it will be 
as God has decreed, perpetual and eter- 
nal, until His will is accomplished and 
His purposes fulfilled among the 
children of men. No people can ever 
prosper and flourish very long unless 
they abide in God's truth. There !a 
nothing, no individuality, no combinea 
influence among men that can prevail 
over the truth. The truth is mighty 
and it will prevail. It may be slow in 
the consummation of Us purpose, in the 
accomplishment of the work that it ha:* 
to do, but it is and will be sure; for 
the truth cannot and will not fail, 
for the Lord Almighty is behind it. 
It is His Work, and He will see to it 
that it is accomplished. The kingdom 
is the Lord's, and the Lord is capable of 
taking care of it. He has . always 
taken care of it. I want to say to 
you that there never was a time since 
the organization of the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints, when a man 
led the Church, not for one moment. 



o 

It was not so in the days of Jo- 
seph; it was not so in the days of 
Brigham Young; it has not been so 
since; it never will be so. The direc- 
tion of this work among the people of 
the world will never be left to men. 
It is God's work, let me tell you, and 
I hope you will put it down in your 
memoranda, and do not forget that 
it is the Almighty that is going 
to do this work and consum- 
rr.ate it, and not man. No man shall 
have the honor of doing it nor has 
any man ever had the power to do it 
of himself. Jt is God's work. If it had 
been the work of man, we would have 
been like the rest of the world, and it 
would not have been true of us that 
God had chosen us out of the 
world, but we would be a part 
of it and "Hail fellow, well met" 
with it, but it is true that God has 
chosen us out of the world; therefore 
we are not of it; and therefore they 
hate us and they will fight us and 
say all manner of evil against us 
falsely, as they have ever done from 
the beginning. And they will con- 
tinue to seek the destruction of the 
Latter-day Saints, and to feel to- 
ward us in the future as they have 
felt in the past. Now don't you forget 
it my brethren and sisters. When 
you go home, if you have not been 
in the habit of doing it or if you have 
neglected your duty, when you go home 
today or to your homes in distant set- 
tlements, carry this injunction with 
you: Go into your secret chambers — 
go into your prayer rooms and there 
by yourselves or with your families 
gathered around you, bow your knees 
before God Almighty in praise and in 
thanksgiving to Him for His mer- 
ciful providence that has been over 
you and over all His people from the 
inception of this work down to the 
present. Remember that it is the 
gift of God to man, that it is His pow- 
er and His guiding influence that has 
accomplished what we see has been ac- 
complished. It has not been done by 
the wisdom of men. It is proper we 
should give honor to those who 
have been intrumental in bringing 



G

to pass much righteousness. They are 
instruments in God's hand, and we 
should not ignore that they are such in- 
struments, and we should honor them 
a,s such ; but when we undertake to give 
them the honor for accomplishing this 
work and take the honor from God, 
who qualified the men to do the work, 
we are doing an injustice to God. 
We are robbing Him of the honor that 
rightfully belongs to Him and giving it 
to men who are only instrumental .in 
the hands of God in accomplishing His 
purposes. 

Now, may the Lord bless you, my 
brothers and sisters, and keep you in 
His holy keeping. But let me say, 
referring again to the last remarks, 
when you go home see to it that you 
observe this duty that devolves upon 
all members of the Church, to go before 
the Lord in prayer. Then when you rise 
up in the morning, before you go out 
into the world to engage in your daily 
avocations, bow yourselves before Al- 
mighty God with a heart full of grati- 
tude and with thankful spirits before 
Him and unto Him, for His mercy, 
which endureth forever, and for His 
loving kindness, not only to us as indi- 
viduals but to the whole people and 
to the whole people of our great nation. 
The Lord has blessed the people of our 
nation. The Lord has given to them 
the choicest of all lands upon the 
earth, and He has made them a great 
and a free people. He has biassed 
them with wealth and with power, not 
only in our own land, but power among 
the nations of the world. The Lord 
Almighty has made this nation great 
and He will continue to preserve it in 
its greatness and He will magnify it 
before the world so long as the people 
of the nation will observe honest laws, 
virtue, purity of life and equal justice 
to be meted out unto all men. 

I feel proud of the nation of which 
we are a part because I am convinced 
in my own mind that there is not an- 
other nation upon the face of the globe 
where the Lord Almighty could have 
established His Church with so little 
difficulty and opposition as He has done 
here in these United States. This was a 



free country and religious toleration 
was the sentiment of the people of the 
land'. It was an asylum for the op- 
pressed. All the people of the world 
were invited here to make homes of free- 
dom for themselves, and under these tol- 
erant circumstances the Lord was able 
to establish His Church, and has been 
able to maintain it and preserve it up to 
this time, that it has grown and spread, 
until it has become respectable — not 
only by its numbers, not only by the 
few years of age that it possesses, but re- 
spectable because of its intelligence, re- 
spectable because of its honesty, its 
purity, union and industry, and for all 
its virtues. It has become respectable 
before those who are intelligent enough 
to study it and who come to jsee and 
understand the truth for themselves. 
It is true there are those in the 
world who are so prejudiced and 
darkened in their minds that they 
will not see though the light 
shine upon them. They close their 
ears and 'will not hear, though the 
truth is spoken unto them.and they shut 
their eyes so they cannot see and close 
their hearts that they may not under- 
stand. Though you declare unto them 
the truth they will deny it and reject 
it. We cannot help this. God will 
deal with them in His own time and 
in His own way, and we only need to do 
cur duty, keep the faith ourselves, to 
work righteousness in the world our- 
selves and leave the results in the 
hands of Him who overruleth, all 
things for the good of those who love 
Him and keep His commandments. 

Now may peace be and abide in 
your hearts. May the union that has 
hitherto characterized our associations 
continue among us. May our people 
continue in their love for the truth 
and in their love for one another. May 
they continue in their honesty of pur- 
pose, in their uprightness, in their in- 
dustry, in the spirit of non-complaint 
and in the spirit of rejoicing and 
thanksgiving to God for the blessings 
that we receive, the blessings of the 
earth, the blessings of the Spirit of 
the Lord that is given to us. And 
I hope that we will continue during

the sessions of this conference to have 
a good attendance, and that we may 
have a peaceable spirit of love un- 
feigned in our hearts, one for another, 
joy inexpressible for the opportunity 
we have of meeting together in this 
house that has been built for this pur- 
pose and to attend to the duties that 
devolve upon us as members of the 
Church, and that we may go hence 
at the close of this conference strength- 
ened in the faith, encouraged in our 
good endeavors, and with a renewed 
determination that as for us and for 
ours we will serve God and let the 
world do its worst. May God bless 
you is my prayer in the name of Jesus. 
Amen."

PRESIDENT JOHN R. WINDER. 

Satisfactory Condtions of Church Affairs. 
— Interesting Incidents Connected 
With the Work, Under God, of the 
Prophet Joseph Smith. — Hardships of 
the People in Early Days.— Settlement 
of the Saints in This Valley, Their 
Temporary Exit and Return. — Unity 
of Latter-day Saints in Relation to 
Sustaining President Joseph F. 
Smith, as Head of the Church. 

My brethren and sisters, it affords ms 
a great deal of pleasure this morning 
to have the opportunity of standing 
before you to endorse every word that 
I have heard spoken by President Jo- 
seph F. Smith. Particularly am I 
pleased to be able to endorse everything 
he said in relation to the financial con- 
dition of the Church, and everything 
pertaining to the expenditures. I can 
say to you, my brethren and sisters, 
that your funds are perfectly safe in 
'his hands. First of all, I wished to 
make this statement. 

When I look over this vast congrega- 
tion of thousands of people, represent- 
ing many nations, kindreds, tongues 
and peoples, my mind goes back to the 
day 'when the boy Joseph Smith, It 
years of age, went into the woods to 
pray to the Father, and when the Fath- 



er and the Son appeared to him ana 
gave him some instructions as to how 
he should proceed. The thought comes 
to me that no sooner did he make 
known what had taken place than per- 
secution commenced. From that hour 
his life was sought. In every way the 
effort was made to destroy him and his 
influence. Seventy-five years ago today 
he was enabled to organize the Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints 
with a very few members. Persecution 
did not cease then. On the contrary, 
it continued from year to year. Then 
when I think of the trying circum- 
stances in which he was placed, the 
wonderful work that he accomplished 
during the few years he was permitted 
to live upon the earth, the translation 
of the Book of Mormon and the pre- 
senting of it to the people and to the 
world; also the production of the Doc- 
trine and Covenants, and the announce- 
ment of many glorious principles in- 
troduced for the salvation of the living 
and the redemption of the dead, I mar- 
vel at the great work that he accom- 
plished in the short space of 14 years. 
Then I thought of the time when the 
people were compelled to leave Nauvoo 
and come to this country, the hardships 
they had to endure, the travels across, 
the plains, the many difficulties they 
had to encounter, and after they had ar- 
rived here the energies they put 
forth to establish industries for 
the good and benefit of the people, 
including manufactures of vari- 
ous kinds. Of necessity they constituted 
the governments here — the city coun- 
cils, the legislatures; in fact, they 
were all that there were in the country. 
This, however, did not continue for 
many years. It was wonderful how the 
Lord blessed the people in the com- 
mencement of their labors. 

I remember also how, just ten years 
from the day when the pioneers arrived 
in this valley, as we were celebrating 
that event at the head of Big Cotton- 
wood, the word came that a great 
army of the United States was form- 
ing to come up and attack the people 
in these valleys of the mountains. I 
remember what occurred during the 
remainder of that summer and the 



GENERAL, CONFERENCE. 



following winter. We were very ousy 
during the winter manufacturing boxes 
in which to store flour and secure what 
provisions we could, because the word 
was that we would have to leave this 
beautiful city and sacrifice our homes. 
The report was that it was the flower 
of the United States army that was 
coming out here to exterminate the 
"Mormons." Not only did this army 
threaten us, but the Indians around us 
were excited, and were robbing the 
people of horses and cattle. In this 
condition we remained during the win- 
' ter and until the next April. That was 
48 years ago. The people were told 
that it was necessary to leave this city, 
and not an objection was raised. We 
were of one heart and one mind. The 
move seemed to be inevitable. Men 
could be seen gathering up a yoke of 
cattle or two or three horses' and hitch- 
ing them to an old wagon as best they 
could, they would put into each wagon 
a family and all of this world's goods 
that they could collect, and then march 
away. 

The road from here to Utah county 
was lined with teams passing from this 
city, the people not knowing whether 
they would be permitted to return 
again. I remember that it was a seri- 
ous condition with us at that time. It 
should be remembered that all this 
was brought about by misrepresenta- 
tions that were made to the President 
of the United States. He sent out a 
certain gentleman to discover the par- 
ticulars, and after he had learned the 
facts a commission was sent here to 
investigate. The matter was investi- 
gated, conclusions were arrived at, and 
the army, which had wintered at Fort 
Bridger, was permitted to come 
through the city and pass over the 
Jordan river. But when that army 
passed through the city, every house 
was closed, and not a person was to he 
seen; houses were shut, windows 
boarded up, and everything apparent- 
ly deserted. As the soldiers marched 
through, the line was more like 
a funeral procession than a conquering 
army. A few of us were left to take 
care of the city, but all the rest had 



departed. Peace was afterward brought 
about, and the people were permitted 
to return to their homes. 

I am referring to these things, my 
brethren and sisters.to verify the state- 
ment of President Smith this morning, 
that this is the Lord's work, and that 
He overrules all these conditions for 
the good of His people, who will do His 
will and keep His commandments. If 
you will look back and reflect, you will 
discover that every event I have men- 
tioned led to one result — the Church 
took on new life, new energy, and ad- 
vanced, increased and multiplied the 
more rapidly. 

After the return of the people from 
the south we had a season of prosper- 
ity. Factories and all kinds of busi- 
nesses were established, and the growth 
and increase were wonderful. There are 
many intervening events of a like 
character that I will net have time to 
mention, but they must be in the minds 
of many of you. We had peace for a 
time; but I remember that, just eigh- 
teen years ago today, conditions were 
such in this city that it was thought 
advisable to hold the general confer- 
ence in Provo. There are some inci- 
dents which I remember that I do not 
think it would be wise to mention, and 
I do not care to do it; but I come 
along down to the condition that we 
are in now. 

Last Sunday was the monthly fast 
day. Monthly fast meetings are held 
in the 620 wards throughout Zion, and 
in the branches abroad as well, I be- 
lieve. On such occasions every person 
present has an opportunity to speak his 
or her feelings. The meetings are gen- 
erally so conducted that all are invit- 
ed to express their feelings, to bear 
their testimonies, and to voice their 
thankfulness to the Lord for His good- 
ness and mercy toward them. I attend- 
ed two meetings last Sunday — one in 
the morning arid one in the afternoon. 
At these meetings I heard at least forty 
persons speak and bear testimony, and 
I think almost every person that spoke 
testified that they sustained and pro- 
posed to sustain President Joseph F. 
Smith as the president of the Church

of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 
Not a dissenting- voice did I hear in re- 
lation to this matter. And I believe, 
brethren and sisters, if I were to call 
upon this vast congregation and ask 
the question, "Do you sustain Presi- 
dent Joseph P. Smith as the President 
of the Church of Jesus Christ of Lat- 
ter-day gaints?" I would hear the ex- 
pression, "Yes, I do," from every 
voice. 

Well, brethren and sisters, let us do 
it as well as say we will do it. If we 
will do so, the Lord will continue to 
bless and prosper us, no matter what 
transpires. As has been said, this is 
His work, and His hand is stretched 
forth, and He will control all these 
matters to bring about the best results. 

May the Lord help us, brethren and 
sisters. Don't you think I feel thank- 
ful this morning for the health and 
strength I enjoy and for the blessing 
of the Lord in extending my life until I 
am almost eighty-four years of age, and 
enabling me to stand here and express 
my feelings in relation to these mat- 
ters? May the Lord help me to say 
always, "As for me and my house, we 
will serve the Lord." God bless you all 
forever. Amen. 

ELDER HUGH J. CANNON, 
(President of Liberty Stake.) 

My brethren and sisters, I feel that it 
is impossible . for me to satisfactorily 
express my feelings this morning, in 
standing before this vast congrega- 
tion. AH the speaking that I have done 
during the time I have been away 
has been in comparatively small 
halls. I think the largest congregation 
that I have been called upon to ad- 
dress numbered, perhaps, 400 persons. 
I, therefore, feel that it will be diffi- 
cult for me to say anything interest- 
ing, or instructive, unless I have the 
Spirit of the Lord. 

In reporting the work in the Swiss 
and German mission, I am pleased to 
be able to state that everything is go- 
ing along very well there. We have 
had a great deal of opposition. Some- 
thing like one hundred of our mis- 



mionaries were banished within one 
year, mostly from Prussia; but we were 
able to get an extension of time, 
through an appeal made to the German 
government by the U. S. Ambassador, 
and during that period the work for- 
merly attended to by our missionaries 
was, to a very large extent, turned 
over to the local Priesthood. I am 
pleased to be able to state 
that notwithstanding the missionaries 
from Utah are not now accorded free- 
dom in that land, still the work is go- 
ing onward, many converts are being 
baptized, and those who are coming in- 
to the Church are firm in the faith I 
believe. They do not accept the Gos- 
pel unless they are sure that it is 
true, exercising care on account of 
the opposition. Hence the people are 
better and stronger, and more able to 
stand, in spite of all the opposition 
they have to meet, than at any pre- 
vious time in the history of that mis- 
sion. I am happy to say that the seeds 
of truth, the seeds of the Gospel, have 
been planted in that land; and I pre- 
dict that, in spite of all the opposition 
of our enemies, that seed will grow and 
will bring forth fruit. I have an abso- 
lute assurance that this will bo the 
case. 

The area of the Swiss and German 
mission at the present time is very 
large. It covers Germany, Switzer- 
land, Austria, Hungary, Roumania and 
Servia, containing about one-<welfth of 
all the people in the world. In Switzer- 
land we have more freedom, and a 
good work is being done there. In 
Hungary and Austria we have very lit- 
tle freedom; still we are able to preach 
the Gospel to some extent, and are bap- 
tizing in both those lands. In Servia 
and Roumania nothing is being done 
by our missionaries at the present time. 
I expect in a very short time to hear 
that missionaries have been sent into 
the northern part of Italy, over the 
Alps from the French part of Switzer- 
land. Many people have been gathered 
from that part of the country, and some 
prominent families now in Utah ac- 
cepted the Gospel there. I firmly be- 
lieve that many more will embrace the 
Gospel in that part of the world.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



I have listened with great pleasure 
to the remarks that have been made 
this morning, and I thank the Lord 
from the bottom of my heart I have 
a testimony that that which has been 
said is true. I thank Him sincerely 
that I know Joseph F. Smith is a Pro- 
phet of the Almighty, and that he was 
called by revelation to stand in the 
place which he now occupies. I was 
taught from my earliest infancy to re- 
vere and love President Smith. My 
father was associated with him and 
loved and honored him, and he taught 
me to love, honor and respect this man. 
I thank my Heavenly Father that I 
know of a surety that this work will 
triumph. History repeats itself; the 
same cause will always have the same 
effect; and if we look back over the 
75 years that this Church has been in 
existence, and note the history of those 
who have' raised their hands against 
this work, we will find they have been 
failures, that they never have succeed- 
ed in their designs, and that the Gos- 
pel has gone on and on. I can bear 
testimony, as President Smith did, that 
it will triumph, and that it will even- 
tually fill the whole earth. If I did not 
have an absolute assurance of this I 
would be filled with misgivings at the 
present time. If I did not know that 
the Lord, and not man, is at the head 
of this work, I would be filled with 
fear; but, having that testimony, the 
only fear I need to have is that I may 
not be able to endure unto the end. I 
pray God that I may. I pray for my 
brethren and for my sisters, that all 
may retain the faith and prove true 
unto the end. I ask these bleissings 
for all of us in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 

ELDER RULON S. WELLS. 

it affords me great pleasure, my 
brethren and sisters, to add my testi- 
mony to those which have already been 
borne in this meeting and to express 
the faith I have in the ultimate tri- 
umph of the work of God upon the 
earth. I have been deeply interested 
and impressed by the remarks at the 



opening of this conference, and by the 
evidences of the great work which 
our Father is accomplishing among 
the children of men. In reviewing the 
conditions which prevail at the present 
time I have been led to remark, What 
a great and wonderful work it is that 
we are engaged in, and how the Lat- 
ter-day Saints who have been carrying 
on this work, under the inspiration of 
the Lord, have attracted toward them 
the attention of the whole world. To 
me it is something marvelous that a 
little band of people— only a few hun- 
dred thousand— should be so conspicu- 
ous in the history of this world and be- 
come so universally known. We have 
traveled as missionaries into many 
parts of the world, and I doubt if 
there is any community or any peo- 
ple that has not heard of the Latter-day 
Saints and of this work with which 
we are identified. Of course, they have 
not been informed in all cases as to 
the true standing of this people; they 
have not received correct information 
regarding us; but we have been spoken 
of and heard of in the remotest parts 
of the world. It is astonishing, too, 
what a great amount of hatred has 
been engendered among the people of 
the world towards the Latter-day 
Saints. We are generally regarded in 
the world as being a very wicked peo- 
ple, and have the reputation among the 
children of men of being the worst 
people upon the face of the earth. I 
have wondered at this myself. I have 
not only been familiar with the opinions 
of men in the world, but it has been 
my lot to be acquainted with the Lat- 
ter-day Saints, having been born in 
this community and having spent near- 
ly all my life here, and I have ob- 
served that they will compare favor- 
ably with any people on the earth. 
There is nothing in the lives of the 
Latter-day Saints to warrant the opin- 
ion that prevails in the world. In 
many places we are regarded as a 
band of cut-throats, an evil and a 
licentious people; but we know that 
this is not the condition that prevails 
among us. When I was in England a 
few years ago we held a conference 



ELDER RULON S. WELLS.

in the city of Nottingham, and while 
we were there literature was scattered 
among the people containing illustra- 
tions supposed to represent life In 
Utah, and this literature was published 
by a well known anti-"Mormon," Mr. 
Jarman. The Latter-day Saints were 
depicted there in the vilest terms. 
On the front page was a picture repre- 
senting a "Mormon," sitting on a pole 
fence with a wide sombrero hat on his 
head, in shirt sleeves, a vile expression 
on his face, and in his hand a black- 
snake whip. Out in the field before 
him were five or six women working 
"with pick and shovel, and plough, 
while he, presumably /he husband of 
these women, was directing them, and 
making them work as slaves. It is 
this kind of misrepresentation that is 
inflaming the minds of people against 
us. Even many good honorable men 
and women have been taught to be- 
lieve us wicked and degraded. While 
Brother McMurrin and I were cross- 
ing the ocean a few years ago we hap- 
pened to be in company with a number 
of school teachers of the city of Phil- 
adelphia who were going upon an ex- 
cursion to Europe. We became ac- 
quainted with them, and explaining our 
religion to them. We gave them some 
idea of the character of the people out 
here, and they looked upon us as repre- 
sentatives of the people. As we were 
about to disembark, one of the pro- 
fessors came up to me and said, "I 
never knew, Mr. Wells, until I met 
you gentlemen here, that there was 
such a thing as a "Mormon" gentle- 
man. I never knew but that the 
"Mormons" were the vilest kind of peo- 
ple, without any culture whatever. I 
was taught to believe them wicked and 
vile from the days of my infancy. Not 
only that, but I wish to make a further 
confession: I am a teacher in one of 
the public schools of Philadelphia, and 
I have taught my pupils to believe that, 
too. But I give you my word that 
when I return to my school I will try 
to undo the mischief I have done." 

Is it any wonder, my brethren and 
sisters, that many good people have 



been deluded and led astray, and 
that we have become hated by the 
people of the world? It may not be very 
pleasant for us to contemplate the 
fact that the world do not like. us. I 
regret that that is the condition. 1 
do not, however, regret that I am iden- 
tified with this people, nor have I any 
regrets for the Latter-day Saints them- 
selves. No; it is the heritage of the 
saints to be hated of the world; and 
I find consolation in the words which 
were quoted by Prest. Smith: "If ye 
were of the world, the world would 
love its own; but because ye are not 
of the world, but I have chosen you 
out of the world, therefore the world 
hate you." Neither should we feel sad 
and discouraged on account -of these 
conditions which prevail in the world; 
for the Savior said further: "Blessed 
are ye, when men shall revile you, and 
persecute you, and shall say all manner 
of evil against you falsely, for my sake. 
Rejoice and be exceeding glad: for 
great is your reward in heaven: for so 
persecuted they the prophets which 
were before you." 

My brethren and sisters, those are 
feelings that fill my bosom with regard 
to the attitude of the world toward us. 
I feel sorry for them, not for us. Rath- 
er I feel to rejoice that I am identified 
with the people of God, notwithstand- 
ing the enmity of the world toward us. 
They do not love the. leaders of this 
people; but we, who know them best, 
know them to be men of God. We 
know that there is nothing in their 
lives that will warrant the attacks that 
are being made upon them by the 
world. Let us uphold and sustain them 
by our faith and prayers, and by our 
obedience to the will of God, that we 
may be faithful and true to the cov- 
enants we have made with the Lord. 
Let us not be discouraged or concerned 
about the ultimate triumph of this 
work; for God is at the helm, and He 
will lead us triumphantly into His 
rest. We have no cause to fear. Let 
them oppose this work as they will, 
they will utterly fail in every attempt. 
That they may be fustrated in all their 
evil machinations, that they may be

The choir and congregation sang: 

"How firm a foundation ye Saints of

PRESIDENT ANTHON H. LUND. 

The Tithing Used Only for Legitimate 
Purposes. — Establishment and Won- 
derful Growth of the Church.— Doc- 
trines Taught by Joseph Smith Har- 
monize With the Scriptures.— Religion 
and Rights of Non-"Mormons" Re- 
spected by Us. 

I will read a few verses of the hymn 

that we have just been singing: 

What though our rights have been as- 
sailed ? 

What though by foes we've been de- 
spoiled? 

Jehovah's promise has not failed, 
Jehovah's purpose is not foiled. 

His work is moving on apace, 

And great events are rolling forth; 
The kingdom of the latter days — 

The "little stone" — must fill the earth. 
Though Satan rage, 'tis all in vain; 

The words the ancient Prophet spoke, 
Sure as the throne of God remain, 

Nor men nor devils can revoke. 
All glory to His holy name, 

Who sends His faithful servants forth, 
To prove the nations — to proclaim 

Salvation's tidings through the earth. 

I am pleased to see this large congre- 
gation. I enjoyed the forenoon services 
very much. I enjoyed the glorious tes- 
timonies borne and the good instruc- 



tions given. I hope that while I shall 
address you the same spirit may direct 
me that inspired my brethren who 
spoke to us this forenoon. 

Like Brother Winder, I feel to bear 
my testimony to the truth of the state- 
ments made by President Smith in re- 
gard to the tithing. I know that the 
tithing is used for the purpose of build- 
ing up the Church of Christ upon the 
earth, and only for that purpose. Presi- 
dent Smith, does not expend any of the 
noney of the Church without sharing 
the responsibility of doing so with his 
brethren. The accounts and books are 
kept, as has been stated, in such a way 
that not one cent could be diverted for 
any selfish purpose without it being 
known. The books are open for the 
inspection of the Saints. All the means 
that come into the Church are ac- 
counted for, and an auditing committee 
looks over the accounts and they cer- 
tify that the books are correctly kept. 
In addition to the things mentioned by 
the president this morning for which 
the tithing has been expended, I will 
say that during the last year more has 
been spent to help build meetinghouses 
both at home and abroad than in any 
other year that I remember. A great 
deal of Church means has gone to the 
various missions, and also to the poor 
of the Church; and besides that, more 
ifas been paid to our Church schools 
than ever before. I believe that all the 
Latter-day Saints approve and sanc- 
tion this way of spending the tithing. 
Our Church schools are progressing 
nicely. We do for them all that we 
can. We feel that they are a necessity 
in Zion, and that the Saints cannot do 
without them. We are proud of them, 
and we wish we were more able to help 
them, because we believe that much 
good is being done through them. 

In establishing our Church schools it 
was not the design to have them an- 
tagonistic to the state schools. When 
strangers travel through our communi- 
ties they are struck with the beautiful 
sehoolhouses we have erected. When I 
say "we," 1 include all citizens of the 
state; but as the Latter-day Saints are 
in the majority they can share at least 



r 



PRESIDENT ANTHON H. LUND.

■equally the honor of having erected 
such fine school buildings in which to 
educate the children. We are proud 
■of the institutions of higher learning 
established by the state, and we look 
to them to do much for our young men 
and young women in the line of edu- 
cation, and to save them from spending 
so much and so many years in the east, 
as they can just as well, and even bet- 
ter in several courses, stay at home and 
take what these institutions give. 

Our Church schools have an object 
which can not be reached in the state 
institutions. We want our young men 
and young women instructed in the 
principles of salvation. We want them 
brought under the influence of the 
Spirit of the Gospel. Hence we .have 
these schools established in our midst. 
Of course, it costs much to keep these 
•schools; but we feel the cost is far out- 
weighed by the good which is accom- 
plished in them. 

I am reminded that this is the 6th 
of April, and that the Church is 75 
years old today. Seventy-five years ago 
a few persons met in Peter Whitmer's 
house, and according to the command- 
ments given of the Lord the Church 
was organized This was done even 
in that early day by the same principle 
which 1 has governed the Church 
ever since, namely, that of common 
consent. The Prophet Joseph had 
translated the Eook of Mormon. Oliver 
Cowder> had been h's scribe. The 
book had already been published. 
These two had received the lesser 
Priesthood under the hands of John, 
whom we know as John the Baptist. 
Afterwards they received the Melchise- 
dek Priesthood under the hands of 
Peter, James and John, who were in- 
trusted by the Savior to hold the keys 
of the Priesthood upon the earth. 
When He ascended to heaven He 
left the authority to administer the 
ordinances of the Gospel with the 
Apostles, and Peter, James and John 
no doubt held the presidency of the 
apostleship. These persons were sent 
to Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery 
and conferred upon them the Melchis- 
(ec?ek Piriesthood. Remember, thete 



was no church organized at that time, 
and therefore there were no offices. In 
conferring the Priesthood upon Joseph 
and Oliver they were not ordained to 
any particular office, but the Priest- 
hood itself was conferred upon them. 
They were instructed, however, that 
when the Church was organized they 
should ordain each other to the office 
of Elder. When those who had been 
baptized met together seventy-five 
years ago today, they opened their 
meeting with earnest prayer, and then 
they laid before those present what 
the Lord wanted them to do, and they 
were accepted unanimously to teach 
the things of the kingdom of God. 
Then they ordained each other to the 
office of an Elder. They partook of 
bread and wine at that meeting, the 
first time that the sacrament was ad- 
ministered in this the dispensation of 
the fullness of times; and then they 
confirmed all those present, who were 
members of the Church, and ordained 
some to different offices in the Priest- 
hood. The Holy Ghost was poured out 
upon them, and they rejoiced that the 
Church had been organized and that 
they were members of it. It was a 
very small beginning; only six mem- 
bers participated in the organization, 
that is, so far as the incorporation of 
the Church was concerned; but there 
were a few additional members in the 
Church. The six that I refer to were: 
Joseph Smith, Jr., Oliver Cowdery, Pe- 
ter Whitmer, Jr., Hyrum Smith, Sam- 
uel H. Smith and David Whitmer. 
From that small beginning I see today 
this large congregation before me, and 
I am amazed to contemplate the great 
work that has been done in all parts 
of the world. 

When the angel said to Joseph that 
his name should be known for good 
and evil in all the world, how im- 
probable this seemed to be, that a 
farmer's boy, in the backwoods,) 
should be known outside of the few 
villages where he was known at that 
time! But this prediction has been 
fulfilled. Those whom I see before me 
today have come from many different 
lands, both from the west and the east.

GENERAL, CONFERENCE. 



Many different nationalities are repre- 
sented here. His name has indeed be- 
come known in all parts of the world. 
We receive letters from many different 
lands inquiring- about our religion 
and asking that Elders be sent to 
them. They have heard of the name 
of Joseph Smith. We rejoice this day 
that we have heard his name, that the 
Gospel came unto us, and that we have 
received the knowledge of its truth. 

While they were yet together in the 
meeting in which the Church was or- 
ganized, the Prophet Joseph received 
this revelation: 

"Behold there shall be a record kept 
among you, and in it thou shalt be 
called a seer, a translator, a prophet, 
an apostle of Jesus Christ, an Elder of 
the Church through the will of God the 
Father, and the grace of your Lord 
Jesus Christ." 

We who have studied his history can 
bear witness to the fact that he was 
not only called a prophet, but that he 
was indeed a prophet, and also a seer, 
which is a still greater calling; that he 
was shown the past, and also what 
should come to pass, and he was made 
the means as a revelator of bringing 
forth the Gospel of Christ in plainness 
and in perfection. As a teacher, he 
proved that his teachings were di- 
vine. It is true that they come in con- 
flict with many of the opinions held by 
the theologians of the day; but when- 
ever they come in conflict with them, 
the theologians' views are in conflict 
with the doctrines of the New Tes- 
tament. He taught that God lived, 
that Jesus Christ was His Son and 
our Redeemer, and that the Holy Ghost 
was one of the Godhead. He taught 
that the Son was like the Father. We 
know that the Son possessed a body. 
We know that He has promised that 
our bodies shall be changed and made 
like unto His glorious body. This is 
a promise unto the Saints. He was 
the express image of His Father. If, 
therefore, He has a glorious body — 
and we know He has — then the Father 
also has a body. Now, this teaching 
comes in direct conflict with the teach- 
ings of the world. But it is not con- 



trary to the teachings of 
the Bible. Read the Bible from 
Genesis to Revelations, and it 
sets forth a personal God, and that 
man was created in His image. We hold 
this to be a glorious doctrine. Then 
he taught us the relationship of man 
to God— that we are His children. 
Though this has been called a pre- 
sumptuous doctrine, it is one that in- 
spires the Saints and makes them feel 
thankful to know that God is their 
Father, and they look upon all human 
beings as their brethren and sisters, 
connected in the sacred relationship of 
brotherhood. Can teachings be more 
ennobling than this? We not only hold 
this as a belief, but we are trying to 
carry it out practically and show men 
that we do love them. We have been 
and are, willing to make much sacrifice 
for those who have not heard the truth. 
Why, this mere handful of Latter-day 
Saints send forth missionaries into the 
world by the hundreds. Why do they 
do this? It does not help them finan- 
cially. They do it because it is a duty 
they owe to their fellowmen, and there- 
fore, when they are called they go forth 
gladly. They do not ask what their 
salary will be, nor where the money 
will come from. If they have the 
means, they are willing to make the 
sacrifice and spend their time in this 
labor of love amongst their fellow-men. 

Why should those who are not of our 
faith be so opposed to us? They say 
we have a false doctrine. But is it 
false? Have they proved \it to be so? 
We invite a comparison of the princi- 
ples we believe in with those taught 
by Jesus Christ and His apostles. If 
our principles are contrary to those that 
they taught, then they cannot be true; 
but if they are like them, then is it not 
probable that they are true? And we 
can prove that it is not only in the let- 
ter that they are alike, but that the 
spirit which accompanied the preaching 
of the Gospel formerly is still in the 
Church, and the word is clothed with 
the same power. Therefore, we say they 
are just the same. 

I feel to bear my testimony unto this 
congregation that Joseph Smith was a 



ELDER JOSEPH E. ROBINSON. 



15 



prophet of the Lord, that he proved 
himself worthy of the name he was 
called to bear; and that he not only 
taught the principles of the Gospel, 
but, as a prophet, was able to tell the 
Saints what should come to pass, to 
warn them against certain courses, to 
tell them what the future had in store 
for them, and also to prophesy what 
should befall this nation. Read the 87th 
section of the Book of Doctrine and 
Covenants, and his history, and you 
will see that as a prophet he foresaw 
the future both of the nation and of 
the Saints. The Lord did not leave him 
nor the Saints in the dark concerning 
these things. And we have seen his 
prophecies fulfilled. 

Brethren and Sisters, this is the work 
of the Lord, and whatever opposition 
it may meet, always remember that the 
Lord is stronger than those who oppose 
Him, and that He will carry the work 
forward to triumph. This work will be 
as "the little stone cut out of the 
mountains without hands," it will fill 
the whole earth. We do not believe, 
however, that the rights of anyone will 
be taken away, but this work will be 
a protection to all, whether they be- 
long to the church or not. Those in our 
midst who are not of us need have no 
concern or fear as to what the Mor- 
mons will do with their neighbors. We 
have shown in the past that their 
rights have been protected equally 
with our own. Where we are in the 
majority we do not step on their toes 
or attempt to take their rights from 
them. On the contrary, we feel that 
they are entitled to just the same priv- 
ileges as we are. But the majority 
have a right to vote as the" please. 
Even politically our people have tried 
to give those in their midst equal rights 
with themselves. When it comes to 
business, some have feared that we are 
going too far in that line; but if they 
will examine into this matter they will 
And that as a people we are mostly 
farmers, tillers of the soil, and the 
cream of commercial business has been 
taken by our non-Mormon friends. But 
we do not find fault with this. They 
have a right to pursue any business 



they like. We simply claim the same 
right to enter into any line of business 
that we desire. There is enough for all, 
and all have a right to engage in busi- 
ness, whether Mormon or gentile, and 
there should be no friction on this ac- 
count. Go down Main street and look 
at the merchants' signs, and you will 
see that the Mormon merchants are 
few. Why, then, should they find fault 
with us, on this point? We say to the 
Latter-day Saints, pursue your even 
course. "Do what is right; let the con- 
sequence follow." Amen.

ELDER JOS. E. ROBINSON. 
(President of California Mission.) 

For the few moments I stand before 
you, my brethren and sisters, I desire 
an interest in your prayers of faith. 
I rejoice in the testimony of Jesus. I 
rejoice in the testimonies of my breth- 
ren which have been borne this day. 
It recalls to my mind a conversation I 
once had with a gentleman, when he 
said: "All you brethren speak the same 
words, bear the same testimony, and 
treat doctrine and principle alike." I 
told him it was in fulfillment of the 
prophecy of Isaiah: 

"How beautiful upon the mountains 
are the feet of him that bringeth good 
tidings, that publisheth peace; that 
bringeth good tidings of good, that 
publisheth salvation; that saith unto 
Zion, Thy God reigneth! 

"Thy watchmen shall lift up the 
voice; .with the voice together shall 
they sing: for they shall see eye to eye, 
when the Lord shall bring again Zion." 

The Lord has established Zion. The 
watchmen lift up the voice together; 
they see eye to eye, and their testi- 
mony is one in relation to peace, to 
salvation, to the fact that God reigns, 
and that if His people do right they 
need have no fear of the consequences. 

I am glad to report the California 
mission in good condition. We do not 
make many converts in that great State 
of pleasure and of wealth; but those 
who do come into the Church are of the 
better classes, and they grow more sta-

ble and more consistent in their faith 
day by day. 'The Saints are growiner 
and developing in faith and in the 
knowledge of the Gospel. They re- 
joice in the triumphs of truth. They 
sorrow at the ignorance of the world 
and those who shape the shaft of vil- 
lification and contumely against the 
Lord's anointed. We have pleasure 
in the visits of many of the worthv 
sons and daughters of Zion to that mis- 
sion. We have pleasure also that some 
who may have been froward and who 
have got outside the influence of home 
love, have had their testimonies re- 
kindled. They have had the oppor- 
tunity of comparing the Gospel of Jesus 
Christ with that taught by men, and 
their bosoms have swelled with sride 
and joy because of the new and ever- 
lasting covenant which God has es- 
tablished with their fathers, to their 
soul's good and to their reclamation. 
They bear testimony to these things, 
and return home renewed in faith, in 
zeal, and in courage, and with a de- 
sire to keep the commandments of God. 

We have heard today a little concern- 
ing the beginning of this work. We 
have been told of its wondrous growth 
in numbers, and in power; that it is 
known among all nations; that the 
name of the Prophet Joseph Smith is 
spoken of throughout the earth for good 
or ill, according to men's concept of 
his work and character. Those who 
have taken cognizance of the advance- 
ment in modern thought cannot but 
note how in seventy-five years the lit- 
tle leaven of the Gospel has influenced 
and modified the precepts and concepts 
of men in relation to the Gospel of the 
Lord Jesus Christ. Many have come 
to view the fact that faith alone is not 
sufficient to save; their concept of God 
and His attributes and powers have 
been changed; the old bottomless pit 
hell has been repudiated; a belief in 
that horrible heresy, the damnation of 
little children who are not baptized has 
been relegated to the past; and the 
concept of a personal God has grown. 
They believe today more in progression, 
as taught, though imperfectly, in some 
of their ideas of evolution. They sense 



more the capabilities of man, his re- 
lationship to Deity, the powers which 
He possesses, and with which, in the 
future, he will be able to develop until 
he may become like his Fa- 
ther in Heaven. Many understand the 
fact that like begets like, and that 
within man is an embryotic Deity. We 
have some such teachings as this from 
the learned professors of the great 
schools in our mission. They have 
learned to be more merciful, and hav^ 
come to see that the Gospel of Christ 
reaches out farther to save than was 
thought seventy-five years ago. They 
are now preaching the doctrine of a 
probation after death, a life beyond 
the veil, wherein mankind may have 
another opportunity to adjust them- 
selves to the Gospel plan. They are 
also teaching tithes and offerings. One 
man there is teaching temple-building. 
Some believe in apostles, others teach 
the gathering. So, as I said in the be- 
ginning, the little leaven is leavening 
the whole lump; and although they wili 
not admit it, their concept of God and 
His work and word has been most 
wondrously modified by the revelations 
of the Lord Jesus Christ through the 
Prophet Joseph Smith. Many of the 
scientific truths which he enunciated, 
and which were elaborated upon by 
Apostle Pratt, have been accepted 
and are now being taught in the 
schools of our land. I noted not long 
since that Professors Lodge, Curry and 
Crookes gave voice to what the press 
called a "stupendous theory" in relation 
to matter. They declared that spirit 
was matter, only finer and more sub- 
tle; and that atoms could be divided ad 
infinitum. Orson Pratt, getting his key 
from the Prophet Joseph Smith, taught 
the same doctrine and wrote his "Ab- 
surdities of Immaterialism" 60 yeara 
ago. So that, not only in religious mat- 
ters, but in scientific as well, the rev*>~ 
lations of the Lord have had their in- 
fluence in the world. Seventy-five 
years ago physiology and hygiene were 
not understood and taught, as they 
are today. Men have arisen one by one 
and voiced the laws of health as we 
have them in the Word of Wisdom; and 



ELDER NEPHI PRATT. 



17 



the States have made it incumbent upon 
the teachers in their various schools to 
teach to the rising generation the health 
laws that are embodied in the Word 
of Wisdom. Not only that, but great 
corporations, the railroads particularly, 
have partaken of this spirit, and those 
who indulge in strong drink or use to- 
bacco find it difficult to get employment 
with them, and if they do get it, the 
work is generally unimportant. 

I rejoice that the Saints of our mis- 
sion sustain the Church with their 
tithes and their offerings, and sustain 
with their confidence and prayers Pres- 
ident Joseph F. Smith and his counsel- 
ors, and the qxiorum of Twelve Apostles. 
I would like to remind you, my brothers' 
and sisters, of the words of Christ when 
He told His disciples to beware of the 
leaven of the scribes and Pharisees. 
They thought He referred to bread; but 
afterwards He explained the matter to 
them, and they sa'sv that He referred 
to their doctrines and teachings. Now, 
as our teachings have modified th« 
thought of the World, at least in re- 
ligious matters^ let us see to it that the 
leaven of the gentiles does not modify 
or change the testimonies we have that, 
God has set His hand to gather Hfs 
elect from the four corners of the earth; 
that the north has been made to give 
up, that the south has kept not back, 
and that the sons and daughters of God 
have been gathered from the east, from 
the west, and from afar off, to be 
taught of His ways and to walk in 
His paths. When philanthropists and 
humanitarians arise and declaim 
against Mother Goose rhymes, such as 
the one that deals with old Daddy 
Long-legs, as being improper teachings 
for our children, what will we say of 
papers and books that aim their shafts 
at the anointed of the Lord? 

Will we have such books and papers 
in our homes? Will we have the ad- 
versary, like a serpent, enter therein 
to poison the atmosphere^? Can we ex- 
pect that our children will learn things 
more healthful morally from such 
sources than those which are conveyed 
in the Mother Goose rhymes and jin- 
gles? Beware of the leaven of the 
Sadducees and Pharisees! Keep your 



covenants before the Lord. Betray not 
His Holy Priesthood. Be humble and 
faithful, and await the day when the 
prophecy of Isaiah shall be fulfilled 
wherein he says: 

"Arise, shine! for thy light is come, 
and the glory of the Lord is risen upon 
thee. 

"The sun shall be no more thy light by 
day; neither for brightness shall the 
moon give light unto thee; but the Lord 
shall be unto thee an everlasting light, 
and thy God thy glory." 

God grant it. Amen. 

ELDER NEPHI PRATT, 

(President of Northwestern States 
Mission.) 

My brethren and sisters, 1 have lis- 
tened this day to that which I came to 
conference to hear. My heart has re- 
joiced in the things that we have heard. 
I am glad that I am here. I have come 
from the northwest, where I have la- 
bored for almost three years, to meet 
with the general body of the church at 
these great conferences, for which 
privilege my heart is filled with grati- 
tude and thanksgiving to the Lord. I 
rejoice in the mission over- which I 
have been called to preside, notwith- 
standing the indifference of the peo- 
ple against most anything that bears 
the name of religion is so great that it 
is like the hide of a rhinoceros, scarce- 
ly penetrable, and it is all our Elders 
can do to get the privilege of having 
perhaps One gospel conversation in tvs'0 
or three days, and oftentimes that will 
be with people who have recently come 
from the east. In the year just past 
we baptized about seventy-five souls in 
that mission; about half of them were 
the children of people already in the 
Church. 

I have to say that the Latter-day 
Saints whose sons have been sent up 
to our mission may be thankful to the 
Lord for the spirit that begins to burn 
in the hearts of those young men. Only 
the other day, in the great town of 
Seattle, on the Puget Sound, myself 
and counselors (one a son of Jesse N. 
Smith, the other Brother George W. 
Quibell) met with the Elders in Priest- 



18 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



hood meeting. There were twenty-sev- 
en of us in all, and we' had that spirit 
and power which has never been mani- 
fested to me in such great abundance 
as it was in the four and a half hours 
of that Priesthood meeting, one of the 
best I have ever been in — and I have 
been brought up in the midst of the 
Priesthood. Every soul present spoke 
by the power of inspiration, their hearts 
were melted, and they bowed their 
heads and wept for joy. They felt that 
they never wanted to commit a sin 
against the Lord, or even any folly, 
but desired to walk the straight and 
narrow path that leads up to eternnl 
life. They felt like going with tears to 
sow the seed of eternal life among the 
people in that land. 

We held meetings in Tacoma, sailed 
across the sound, and went over to the 
Island of Vancouver, and in our meet- 
ings there was a power that it was 
blessed to feel. We had liberty of 
speech, liberty of the Holy Spirit, and 
the Saints and strangers that came 
there will not soon forget these splen- 
did meetings. We are not, however, 
setting the lakes nor the ocean on fire 
up there; but are working faithfully 
every day. Our missionaries are carry- 
ing literature from door to door, and 
whatever the result may be, we are do- 
ing the best we can. We hold meetings 
in the evenings, often upon the streets, 
and we sometimes have a baker's do^en 
to listen to us, and at other times from 
four to six hundred persons. 

We have heard the voice of inspira- 
tion through our Prophet who stands 
at the head of the Church, and in our 
field we know that he is a prophet of 
the living God; for we can testify that 
our hearts have burned within us when 
we have listened to his voice and testi- 
mony; and when we have yielded obe- 
dience to his counsel, we, too, have re- 
ceived revelation and inspiration from 
on high, such as men can only receive 
upon principles of righteousness. 

This, brethren and sisters, is my tes- 
timony, and I bear it wherever I get a 
chance. I talk to men upon the trains, 
on the steamboats, on the streets, and 
in the homes of the people, and I find 



that the intelligent American citizen is 
not holding great condemnation over 
this people. Men are testifying to us 
of the confidence they have in us and 
in our leaders; and we feel greatly 
gratified at the manner in which some 
of the foremost men in Portland and 
Seattle speak of the industrial charac- 
ter of our people, and of the splendid 
way in which we unite together to 
bring about and make successful the 
great industries that have been estab- 
lished by us. 

I wish to close my remarks by bear- 
ing my humble testimony that I know, 
and have known for many years, that 
God is with this people. I remarked 
this morning, as my mind meditated 
upon the apostate condition of some 
who have stood high in this Chxrch, 
where are they? where is their power 
and where is their influence? This work 
never stopped a minute when they dis- 
approved of what the prophets had 
done; on the contrary, it grew in num- 
bers, in union, in power and strength. 
The light of those apostates has gone 
out, and their works are forgotten, but 
this people will continue to rise in 
might and power, and be prospered in 
the earth, for God has planted them; 
and Zion shall remain forever. Amen. 

ELDER JOS. A. McRAE. 
(President of Colorado Mission.) 

My brethren and, sisters, I rejoice this 
afternoon with you in having the op- 
portunity to attend this seventy-fifth 
anniversary of the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints, and I want 
to bear my testimony to what President 
Smith said this morning in relation to 
the growth of this great latter-day 
work. In the field where I have been 
appointed to preside the church was 
never in better condition, and I do not 
know the time when the people were 
trying to live nearer to the Lord and 
were more willing to sustain President 
Joseph P. Smith, his counselors, the 
Twelve Apostles, and all the leading 
authorities of the Church. We have had 
some opposition in our work, but most 
of our trouble has been indifference. 



ELDER JOS. A. McRAE.

However, at the present time there is a 
spirit of inquiry among the people, and 
they want to know something- about 
the doctrines of the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints. About 
two weeks ago I took by surprise the 
Elders who are laboring in the city of 
Denver, and asked them to report to me 
the number of homes where they could 
go and read the Book of Mormon and 
tell the people of the Prophet Joseph 
Smith, and we counted 101 homes in 
that city where the Elders could go any 
night they choose and read the Book of 
Mormon to the people. We have estab- 
lished in many homes Book of Mormon 
classes, and have advocated doing this 
wherever practicable. We go there on 
specially appointed evenings, read chap- 
ters to them from the Book of Mormon, 
and they have the privilege of asking 
questions. This gives us the opportu- 
nity to confine our remarks to the sub- 
ject in hand, instead of wandering 
about. We have discovered that this 
has accomplished a great deal of good. 
The people have begun to inquire about 
the Book of Mormon, and many have 
desired a copy of it. We are pleased 
to know that many influential men in 
our mission are in favor of the Church 
of Jesus Christ, and in sympathy with 
the Elders. Many have invited the El- 
ders to their homes, and have volun- 
teered their friendship to us, telling us 
that anything they could do we were 
perfectly welcome to. We have not 
made many converts, so far as baptisms 
are concerned, but I believe that there 
is a feeling of inquiry spreading 
throughout the mission which will ul- 
timately result in good. We had one of 
our "reverend" brethren come up there 
(I was wondering if he came from 
Brother Rich's mission) and he unin- 
tentionally did some missionary work 
for us. In a newspaper interview he 
told some awful tales all about what 
the Mormons are doing in Denver, and 
with tears in his eyes related many 
pathetic stories regarding the work. 
The result was that for six weeks after 
his interview our little hall was crowd- 
ed with people, and we were accosted 
on the streets, and by street car and 



railroad conductors, asking us about 
this "reverend" gentleman, and what 
effect he had had upon us. My answer 
always was that he had done us no 
harm, but I did not know how much 
harm he had done himself. When I see 
the gentleman I am going to thank him 
for assisting the Elders to preach the 
Gospel of Christ. 

We have a body of good Elders in 
the mission at the present time. They 
are studying and working hard to 
preach the Gospel unto the people. We 
have also three lady missionaries, who 
are doing a valuable work among the 
people, getting into homes where the 
Elders could not obtain access. Girls 
who have left their homes in our midst 
and have married men not members of 
the church, have been visited by these 
sisters, who have had the privilege of 
teaching them the Gospel of Jesus 
Christ and instructing their children 
how to pray, when the fathers have ab- 
solutely refused to have the Elders in 
their homes. Our sisters have gone in- 
to these homes, and in Denver they 
have not done any tracting for several 
months because their time has been 
completely occupied in visiting the 
homes of friends, and they are two or 
three weeks behind now in going where 
they have been invited, notwithstand- 
ing they are going out day and night. 

Brethren and sisters, I have a testi- 
mony of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. I 
know that it is the power of God unto 
salvation. I know by the inspiration of 
the Holy Spirit that Joseph F. Smith 
is a prophet, seer and revelator, and the 
man who has been chosen of God to 
lead this people. I know that his 
counselors are men of God. I know that 
the Twelve Apostles have been chosen 
by divine authority and have been 
sent out to preach the Gospel. I am 
always willing, and I hope I always 
shall be, to listen to the counsel they 
give unto me. I hope I shall always 
be able to put myself in subjection to 
the Spirit of the Lord, that those who 
preside in this great work will have ac- 
cess to my heart and be able to counsel 
and direct me for good. May the Lord 
bless us and help us to this end, is 
my prayer. Amen. 



20 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



ELDER GERMAN E. ELLSWORTH. 
(•President of Northern States Mission.) 

My brethren and sisters, I do not feel 
as much at home in preaching to you, 
Latter-day Saints, as I would if this 
congregation were non-members of the 
Church. I believe I could attend this 
conference from beginning to end, and 
unless there was a feeling in my heart 
to bear my testimony to the truthful- 
ness of the Gospel and to the power of 
God, I would not desire to speak; but I 
cannot remember a time for the last 
eight or nine years whenever I came 
before a body of people who did not 
know the Gospel was true, but what I 
had a desire to bear my testimony to 
them. I have not such a desire to bear 
my testimony before you; but I feel to 
report unto you the labors of my mis- 
sion, having been called upon by him 
who holds the right to dictate in these 
things. 

With reference to the Northern States 
mission, I am proud to say that every 
Elder in the mission is doing his ut- 
most; for the record of the past year is 
one that is going to require great la- 
bor to equal in the future. I have 
visited almost every Elder in the last 
two months, and they all desire to at 
least equal the record of the past year. 
In many parts of the mission we have 
wonderful openings. We have com- 
munications from people stating that 
the ministers have forsaken them be- 
cause they are too poor to remunerate 
a good minister, and the poorer ones 
do not desire to visit them, so thev 
have asked for our Elders to come and 
preach to them the Gospel. You re- 
member that, at the last Conference. 
President Asahel H. Woodruff reported 
to you about the work in the little city 
of Robinson, Indiana, where they had 
baptized fifteen or sixteen individuals. 
We have added to that number, and 
since that time we have built a small 
church that will hold about 
150 persons, and it will be ready for 
dedication in a few weeks. Many of 
the people rejoice, and are glad that 
they have united in the faith of the 
Latter-day Saints. We have in the 



last two months received letters from 
the northern part of Wisconsin, desir- 
ing our Elders to go through that part 
of the country and hold meetings in 
their schoolhouses; for, they say, they 
cannot afford to pay preachers that 
are only half as good as the Elders who 
come to them for nothing. Three weeks 
ago we sent two Elders into far-off 
Ashland, in the northern part of Wis- 
consin; and, in that city, those two El- 
ders arose and bore their testimony, 
and thanked the Lord that they were 
sent to a place where our Elders had 
not been, so far as they knew; and 
they said that if there was another such 
point farther away they would thank 
the Lord if they could be sent there. 
A letter reached me yesterday in which 
I was told that those two Elders had 
a hard time for a few days to find an 
opening, but, through the mercy of the 
Lord, friends were raised up unto them, 
and in one week they held fifteen cot- 
tage meetings and sold several copies 
of the Book of Mormon. Three weeks 
ago we held a conference, in Monmouth, 
Illinois, of twenty-two Elders and four 
lady missionaries, and, like Brother 
Pratt, I do not remember a time when 
the Spirit of the Lord rested upon the 
missionaries more powerfully than it 
did in that historic town. Hundreds 
of people came to hear the testimony 
of the Elders representing a people that 
were once driven from that state, and 
they were glad to receive them. Many 
said they would to God that our peo- 
ple had never been driven from that 
state, and they are looking with anxi- 
ous eyes to the return of the Latter-day 
Saints to western Illinois. Editors 
of papers follow us up and ask ques- 
tions concerning the probable coming 
back of the Latter-day Saints to 
that part of the country. The people 
in Nauvoo would gladly welcome 
the Saints there, to rebuild that city. 
Several months ago two Elders 
were sent to Carthage, and they 
were received very kindly. Sometimes 
I wonder that they were so tolerant, for 
those two Elders, humble and young, 
stood upon the streets of Carthage and, 
in the fervor of their souls, declared 



ELDER GERMAN E. ELLSWORTH. 



21 



that the blood of the prophets slain in 
that city was crying from the ground 
to their heavenly Father. The people 
did not seem to be aroused with regard 
to their testimony until, on Christmas 
day, two ladies were baptized in the 
Mississippi river, and, when it 'was 
noised about, the ministers of the city 
and county united in the desire to drive 
the Elders out; but the officials told 
them it would not do. For two months 
past they have hardly had access to 
the homes of the people, because of this 
prejudice; but it is breaking down and 
they are visiting some of the honest in 
hjeart in that city, and children of 
Saints who remained behind there. One 
thing that causes me to rejoice that I 
am a Latter-day Saint, and that my 
parents and grandparents came to Utah 
with the body of the Saints, is the 
growth of faith in the young men and 
the young women in Zion. It is a sad 
sight to see the old people who did not 
have faith to gather with the Latter- 
day Saints, but remained in Illinois or 
in Iowa. They have not the spirit of 
the Gospel; they have only about half 
the spirit of Americans. They live in 
obscurity and are practically unknown; 
whereas if they had gathered to Zion, 
and possessed the faith of the pioneers, 
they might have been brilliant men and 
women, known for good among their 
fellows. But through criticising the 
leaders of the Church in that day, and 
through their lack of faith, they have 
been lost to the Church. It is my firm 
belief that the people of today who are 
fighting our leaders will in a very few 
years be practically unknown. I often 
recall testimonies that were borne fo 
me by apostates in California. I re- 
member one man coming to me and, 
with tears in his eyes, requested me not 
to sing the songs of Zion in his house, 
because he could not stand it. When I 
asked him why he did not repent, he 
said that the spirit of repentance had 
never come to him in thirty years. I 
believe that men and women in the 
Church today who are fighting Zion will 
lose the testimony, and it may never 
come back to them possibly in this life. 

The Latter-day Saints in Chicago are 
thankful to the Lord for the goodly 



place they now possess in which to wor- 
ship, and I bear witness that the means 
spent in Chicago for the obtaining of a 
beautiful house to worship in was weil 
spent. There are a number of members 
of the Church who are students in Chi- 
cago, and they are proud to belong to 
that branch. They assist us in our 
work, and we feel thankful for the la- 
bors they have performed and for the 
support they have given us. I believe 
that they ought to be encouraged; for 
they have gone out to battle with the 
world. One young man came to mo 
three months ago. He had not been at- 
tending our services, and he felt, pos- 
sibly, that he was not of much conse- 
quence. He roomed with a strong mind- 
ed student, and thought he had so much 
work to do that he could not come anil 
worship. After four months of isola- 
tion from the Church, by reading the 
many things that are written against 
us, he began to wonder if Zion was not 
astray. Today, however, he feels bet- 
ter, having come under the influence of 
faithful students and Elders there. 

In southern Illinois we have pur- 
chased another small church in which 
to worship; and the honest in heart, 
also the firm minded among them, are 
pleased to think that they are going to 
have an energetic, enterprising people 
live with them. 

My Brethren and sisters, I am glad 
to have the privilege of representing 
such a noble band of young men ancl 
young women as are the missionaries 
in the Northern States mission. I be- 
live that their souls are filled with a 
desire to keep the commandments 01 
the Lord and to spread a knowledge ot 
those commandments among their fet- 
lowmen. I have often thought, if tTnj 
mothers could see their sons out there, 
perhaps knowing scarcely a passage of 
Scripture from, memory, and, reading 
the Bible, find that it sustains the 
teachings of their mothers, their hearts 
would rejoice to note how their minds 
broaden, and how their souls are filled 
with joy, when they see that the Bible 
backs up the teachings they have re- 
ceived at their mother's knee, and in 
their Sunday schools and other good 
places. Many of our young men are 



22 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



not as well acquainted with the Bible as 
they are with the fact that their moth- 
er has taught them to believe in GO'd,- 
to repent and be baptized, and then to 
have hands laid upon them for the gift 
of the Holy Ghost. When they read 
about these principles they understand 
them, and instead of coming back weak 
in the faith, they return with their faith 
strengthened, and with the teachings of 
their parents confirmed by the doctrines 
of the Holy Scriptures. 

My brethren and sisters, I pray that 
God will bless the Elders in our mis- 
sion. We wish we had more to search 
out the honest in heart who desire to 
know concerning the great and glori- 
ous Gospel that has been restored in 
our days. I have a testimony that our 
Father in heaven is with Zlon and hei> 
leaders. When but a small boy I had 
a testimony that our present leader 
was a man of God, and I have received 
additional testimony that God approves 
of his actions and is guiding him, to- 
gether with those who have been called 
to direct the affairs of Zion. May God 
help us all to keep the testimony that 
we have, and to follow in the light that 
has come to Zion and her leaders, that 
we may not be lost sight of in the on- 
ward march of the work of God. This 
is my prayer in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 

PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 

"As this is the seventy-fifth anniver- 
sary of the day on which the Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints

PRESIDENT FRANCIS. M. LYMAN. 

The Way Preparing for Further Proclam- 
ation of the Qospel.— The Saints Giv3 
Practical Evidence of Love for Man- 
kind.— Leaders in the Church Deserve 
Faith and Confidence.— Ignorant Oppo- 
nents Not so Culpable as the Ma- 
licious.— Our Religion Conforms to the 
Law of the Land. 
I feel very much this morning the 
necessity of your, faith and prayers, 
and the blessing and Spirit of the Lord 
while I attempt to address you. My 
heart was full of joy yesterday m lis- 
, tening to the splendid reports of the 
condition of the Latter-day Saints, and 
what they have accomplished. It is 
wonderful that we have been able in 
seventy-five years to have brought to- 
gether from so small a beginning such 
a remarkable people, from so many dif- 
ferent nations, so well established in 
their faith, so completely organized, 
and working so unitedly together to 
carry the Gospel to the whole world. 
From the first organization of the 
Church, with six members, down to the 
present time, with several hundred 
thousand members, it is but a short 
time. And every Latter-day Saint has 
a testimony regarding the truth of this 
work. The people of the Lord have ob- 
tained forgiveness of sin through their 
faith, repentance and baptism, and 
they have received the Holy Ghost, 
which bears record of the Father and of 
the Son, and which enables us to un- 



derstand the truth and the things of 
God — things that none are able to com- 
prehend without the aid of that spirit. 
We see today a great multitude gather- 
ed here to worship the Lord, represent- 
ing all the various Stakes of Zion, and 
all the missions of the United States. 

We learned yesterday from the Pres- 
idency what we have accomplished col- 
lectively, and it is remarkable; for we 
are carrying forward a very important 
work among the nations of the earth. 
We would be delighted if we could pen- 
etrate those nations where we have not 
yet found religious liberty; and we be- 
lieve that the Lord will move among 
the nations and control them until all 
the world may enjoy the same liberty 
that the English-speaking people and 
some other races enjoy at the present 
time. The Gospel makes us free; but 
it is necessary that we should have a 
measure of freedom among the children 
of men, through the governments of 
the earth, before we can move the cause 
of Zion effectually among the nations. 
I believe that the hand of the Lord is 
manifest today, as it always has been, 
among the nations, and that He is pre- 
paring the way for the labor that we 
have to perform. Though the world 
have little faith in us, yet we will 
demonstrate to them that we are true 
men and women, that we love mankind 
and that we do not hate them. We la- 
bor to do them good, we work for their 
salvation, and among the Latter-day 
Saints there is a large percentage of 
men and women who have sacrificed 
years of their lives in preaching the 
Gospel among the peoples of the earth; 
and as a rule they have borne their 
own expenses, have lived with the 
people, and traveled without reward — 
without purse or scrip. And what has 
been done, and what we see around us, 
the Lord has enabled us to do it. He 
has wrought by our hands. He has 
planted our feet securely in these 
mountain valleys, and has enabled us 
to extend our borders. He has moved 
upon our neighbors in the surrounding 



PRESIDENT FRANCIS M. LYMAN. 



states and territories so that they have 
wanted us, because we are a peculiar 
people, leading out in practical lines, 
and possibly a little more stable in our 
ways than other peoflle. We have 
gathered for the purpose of settling 
down and occupying the land, and es- 
tablishing a church wherein we may 
learn of the ways of the Lord and 
walk in His path. We have listened to 
His counsel and have been led by it 
from the beginning. We have not been 
deserted. We have not been overlook- 
ed. The Lord hag been with His ser- 
vants who have led us. He has been 
with His people in their labors, at 
home and abroad. He has enabled us 
to build and develop a great and impor- 
tant commonwealth in this State, and 
we have helped materially in the estab- 
lishment of the States around us. We 
have led in home industry. We have 
been driven to do so for our self-pres- 
ervation. We have cultivated the earth. 
We have not given quite so much at- 
tention to mining as our neighbors have 
done. We have not made fortunes like 
our neighbors may have made in this 
direction. But we have established our- 
selves solidly upon the land, and have 
built up cities and towns, houses of 
worship, school houses, temples of 
learning, such as any State could well 
be proud of. In these respects we com- 
pare very favorably with the other 
States in the Union, although we 
have labored under disadvantages 
and have been a poor people, 
gathered from among the poor. 
Not many wealthy, not many great 
and noble, reckoning after the 
fashion of men,' have come into our 
ranks; but the souls that have gath- 
ered with the Saints have been of 
just as fine material, as splendid tex- 
ture as the peoples of any other church 
in the world. They have been men 
and women who were willing to make 
sacrifices for the Gospel's sake, and 
to bear the ill-will and the hatred of 
the world. They have been willing to 
endure trials and hardships, to leave 
their homes, their kindred, their 
friends and neighbors in the various 
nations, to gather with the Saints. 



They have come here and have been 
made one by the Spirit of the Lord. 
What remarkable oneness we noticed 
here yesterday in the voting! And we 
are always united just about like that. 
It is a rare thing to have opposition 
votes among the Latter-day Saints, 
for the reason that we see alike and 
we believe alike. We have faith in our 
leaders; not only in the men who lead 
the Church, but in the men who lead 
the wards, the stakes, the quorums, 
the associations and the missions. For 
these men have all been selected with 
great care, with prayer and with sup- 
plication to the Lord. As the officials 
of the Church and as the people, we 
have no object whatever but the ob- 
taining of the very best men and wo- 
men for the responsible positions. We 
want men and women who are exem- 
plary, who have faith, who are true 
and upright, and whose integrity is 
unquestioned. And today there is no 
dearth of that class of people. We 
find them in the stakes of Zion; we 
find them in all the gatherings of the 
people. In the Priesthood gatherings, 
in the conference gatherings, in the 
sacramental and fast meetings, we 
find very choice men and women. 
Though there may be, and there is, 
carelessness among some of the Lat- 
ter-day Saints, which grieves the 
spirit of our good brethren and sis- 
ters when they discover it, yet down 
in the hearts of those people they know 
that the Gospel is true, and they know 
the men who preside over them locally 
and generally; for we have dwelt to- 
gether, we embraced the Gospel to- 
gether in foreign lands, and then we 
have been trying to live it here, after a 
fashion. We have been doing pretty 
well. Some have been weeded out. 
They were not able to endure; they 
weakened and lost the faith, and with- 
drew from the Church, because it is 
a very great undertaking to be a Lat- 
ter-day Saint in the face of the feel- 
ing of the world toward us. The world 
feel ugly toward us, and as a rule, 
honestly, I believe. There are some no 
doubt that are not honest in it; but 



26 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



people that have not known anything- 
of us, and all that has come to them 
is what has been written by those 
who have maligned and despitefully 
used us, have honestly, conscientiously 
entertained those falsehoods and be- 
lieved them to be true, just as honest- 
ly as men did in the days of the Sa- 
vior, for there were men then who 
honestly persecuted the Saints and 
felt that they were really doing God's 
service. Do you not think that dur- 
ing our history many people have felt 
that they were really doing a service 
for the Lord when they persecuted 
the Saints? Do you not believe that 
they thought we were immoral, im- 
pure, corrupt and dishonest?. Of 
course, they believed that we were de- 
luded. That was the most charitable 
construction that they could put upon 
it. But what a wonderful "delusion" 
to come from a young man of the age 
of the Prophet Joseph Smith, and to 
have the effect it did upon men who 
were much older than he, more ex- 
perienced, better theologians, and men 
who had acquaintance with the world 
and who in some cases were educated 
and scholarly! He was the junior of 
most of those who associated with 
him. He was only thirty-eight years 
of age when he died, and he had then 
led the Church in its organized capa- 
city for fourteen years. And he had 
always waded through a sea of trou- 
ble; yet the Lord made his heart joy- 
ous and light. He was filled with in- 
spiration from on high, and he laid 
the foundations of this work under the 
direction of the Lord. It was not his 
work. He had not the wisdom, the 
judgment, the power, nor the under- 
standing-. But the Lord made him a 
Prophet and a law-giver, and he has 
handed down to us the revelations 
which the Lord gave to him. They 
compose a very precious volume, for 
they are the words of the Lord. This 
book is a law to the Church. The 
Prophet Joseph was especially raised 
up for this work. He was 
foreknown by the Father, who under- 
stood him perfectly. He knew his in- 
tegrity and his devotion, and He 



made up to him for the loss of this 
world's education, and brought him to 
a profound understanding under the 
inspiration of the Holy Ghost, so that 
he was one of the best theologians, 
learned in Scripture and the doctrines 
of the Lord, that has lived upon the 
earth. He laid down the doctrines of 
the Gospel for us, and they are here at 
our service. 

Now then, have we been deceived? 
Have we been led astray by this young 
man? He comes to us and tells us, as 
the Savior did in His day, that if any 
man will receive the message and will 
allow his heart to open and receive the 
principles of faith, repentance and bap- 
tism from the Lord, and th«n will do 
the will of the Father,, he may know of 
the doctrine. There is not a, man :'n 
the world but may know of the truth of 
the doctrine laid down in the revela- 
tions of the Lord to the Prophet Joseph 
Smith. There is not a man so great, 
so intelligent and so powerful in this 
world but he can learn that lesson. He 
can know that Joseph Smith was a 
prophet of God just as well as he can 
know anything on this earth; for all his 
faculties and his very soul will be con> 
vinced. And if he is an honest man 
like Paul he cannot deny it, provided 
he does right. When Paul got his eyes 
open and he heard the voice of the 
Lord, he was willing to sacrifice his 
life, because he had seen the light and 
had heard the voice. The Spirit of the 
Lord filled his soul and bore record to 
him that he had met Jesus in the way. 
Could he deny it? He could not. And 
the Prophet Joseph could not deny it 
when he saw the Lord and the angel. 
He knew it, he saw it, he understood it 
thoroughly. The Holy Ghost doth en- 
velop and inspire the hearts of men 
who serve the Lord, so that they are 
as thoroughly convinced of the truth 
as their natural senses are that there 
is light and darkness, cold and heat, 
pain and pleasure, taste and smell. By 
our natural senses we comprehend the 
things of the world; and just as infor- 
mation and knowledge come to us by 
hearing and feeling and seeing, so does 
the inspiration of the Holy Ghost fill 



PRESIDENT FRANCIS M. LYMAN. 



27 



the hearts and souls of all men who 
sincerely repent. Of course, men will 
not repent unless they have faith; but 
all men who have faith in God and in 
His Son Jesus Christ, who repent and 
turn from their sins, who are baptized 
for the remission of their sins in the 
authority of the Lord Jesus, obtain this 
light and inspiration. That is the spirit 
that made us one yesterday; it makes 
us one today, and it will unite us in 
the future. It will clear our minds, and 
we will not be troubled nor in the 
dark; for the Lord will be with us and 
will manifest His good pleasure to us 
in answer to our prayers and our good 
works. He will bring peace and joy 
into our Souls, and establish us and 
anchor our souls, that we shall not be 
easily moved. Why, we have become 
so numerous now, so well established 
and experienced, that with all the agi- 
tation that can be stirred up against 
us you will hardly see anybody turn- 
ing away from the truth. In early 
times, before the brethren were well 
seasoned and tried, while the material 
was fresh and green, many fell by the 
wayside, lost their footing, and wan- 
dered from the Church. Some of them 
returned and saw the light again, but 
many never returned. Today, how- 
ever, you cannot find a devoted and 
faithful Latter-day Saint, not a chief, 
not a leading spirit in the Church, 
that is shaken in his faith, or that 
feels uncertain in regard to his 
standing and fellowship. I want to 
say for the six hundred Bishops in 
the Church, for the fifteen hundred 
missionaries in the field preaching the 
Gospel, for the Presidents of Stakes 
and their counselors, for the High 
Councilors, for the Bishops' counselo 
one for the presiding councils of the 
Seventies, you can hardly find one of 
these presiding men that is shaken. 
And Israel is larger today than he 
has ever been in this dispensation, and 
we are more numerous and better es- 
tablished than ever before. Not one 
of these officers but knows just exact- 
ly where we are. The testimony 
abides in every heart when the will of 
God has been at all reasonably done. 
If there be any who do not know; if 



there be any who have question in 
their hearts, it is because they have 
not steered their course along the 
proper lines, and they have need to 
repent. We have need to repent if we 
are a little off the straight line that 
leads to eternal life. 

The brethren who preside are labor- 
ing constantly among the people, and 
we are doing what we can reasonably. 
And we will do more; we intend to do 
more; we intend to be better, to work 
righteousness better than we have done 
and to grow in faith and in favo 
with the Lord all the time. There is 
room for improvement, no doubt, with 
the very best of us. I believe that is 
the feeling with the brethren who pre- 
side. The care of the detailed affairs of 
the Church rests with the presiding 
brethren in the branches, the wards and 
the stakes, and these men are entitled 
to be filled with the inspiration of the 
Lord. Men who stand at the head of 
stakes and of wards, with their helps in 
government, are expected to be pre- 
pared to teach the people, to care for 
the various departments and organiza- 
tions, that none shall be neglected or 
overlooked, and that all shall be cared 
for, exercising sympathy and tender- 
ness towards those who are at all weak. 
And we all get "weak. There is not any- 
one so strong but gets weak at times. 
Let sickness and poverty come upon 
us, let misfortune overtake us, and we 
are weaklings. Man is like the worm 
of the dust almost when his health and 
strength and the favor of the Lord are 
taken from him. The strongest anH 
mightiest among the people need the 
favor and blessing of the Lord and the 
sympathy of their neighbors. We need 
to help one another, sustain and uphold 
one another, so that no one shall feel 
neglected; for all their souls are pre- 
cious. Though we be mortal, fallen, 
frail, yet we are the sons of God, the 
children of our Father who dwells in 
heaven. Thank the Lord that we have 
learned this through the Prophet Joseph 
Smith. Thank the Lord that we know 
who our Father is, that we knew wfTo 
the Savior is, and that we know that 
they live; for we have the witness, the 
word of the Lord through the Prophet, 



28 



GENERAL, CONFERENCE. 



and in addition to that we have the 
witness of the Holy Ghost. We have 
demonstrated in our lives and in our 
experience that we are not mistaken; 
for the Lord has manifested Himself to 
us in our visions and dreams and in 
answering our prayers, and in a thou- 
sand ways. He has redeemed us from 
our fallen condition, and has saved us; 
that is, we are preserved, we have not 
been broken to pieces, and we are' not 
going to be broken to pieces. We are 
going to be faithful, united, and at- 
tend to the duties that pertain to the 
kingdom of God. We propose to do 
that, 'with the Lord's help. Then wt 
intend to feed and clothe ourselves, and 
take -care of our farms, our flocks and 
our herds, and build our temples, our 
houses of worship and our temples of 
learning. We expect to be men in this 
world, like other men— manly men, hon- 
orable, upright men, business men, fi- 
nancial men, physical men, spiritual 
men, pure men. We expect to do the 
will of the Lord, and we intend to be as 
loyal to the government of the United 
States, and to our own state, as the 
people of any other state can possibly 
be. We will bear our share 
of the responsibilities and bur- 
dens of the state and the na- 
tion, in peace and in war, and we will 
do our duty faithfully and well. We 
will love our neighbors, and we will 
not wrong them. We will associate 
•with them in business matters and 
otherwise. We will bless them, and not 
curse them. We will not rail against 
them. We will not despise nor hato 
them. We will not do them injury, but 
we will do them good. We have gone 
out in the world to do mankind good. 
Have not the Elders who have gone 
out into the world done good service for 
these hundreds of thousands of people 
that are gathered together and that are 
now settled upon the land of Zion in the 
various states and territories surround- 
ing us? Are we not a good, peaceable 
element, prayerful and faithful? Are 
we not doing our part and portion for 
the state and for the government? We 
are; and we are faithful and true, and 
propose to be from this time henceforth. 
The things that belong to the nation 
and the state we will render equal to 



anyone else in the world; and then we 
will render to God the things that are 
God's. We will honor and obey Him 
and keep His commandments, and He 
•will not require us to wrong our state: 
or nation. We love the people of this 
nation. We live with them. They are 
made up, like we are, from all the na- 
tions of the earth. This nation is al- 
lowing the people to come from all the 
nations of the earth. I wonder if they 
ever think that they are gathering the 
people together. We won't have to go- 
away from home to preach to every- 
body, because this great land of ours 
will be filled with the people of all na. 
tions. They come here and possess 
the liberty which they cannot have in 
the eastern world; then they can heir 
the Gospel. This is to be a favored field 
for the preaching of the Gospel. The 
Lord has prepared the way, and He is. 
working the principle of gathering bet- 
ter than we could do. True, w^e are 
doing all we can in that direction, and 
intend to do more; but the peoples of 
the earth will gather themselves upon 
this land of Zion, and here the word, 
of the Lord will be taught. Here is 
where the word of the Lord came in 
this dispensation to the Prophet Joseph; 
and upon this land of Zion the nations, 
of the earth shall assemble, and ths 
Gospel will be preached to them. Thank 
the Lord for the liberty that is allowed, 
us, and that we have the liberty of 
talking, of living, of loving the truth, 
working righteousness and doing the 
will of God. I pray that this principle- 
may always remain with us, and that 
we will never be deprived of it;_ and. 
that this nation of ours will be perpetu- 
ated to do the 'work and will of the- 
Lord among the children of men. I 
hope that it will be preserved and sus- 
tained, and that the power which the- 
Lord has granted unto it so marvelous- 
ly shall be devoted for the accomplish- 
ment of His purposes in the earth. 

May the Lord bless you, my brethren, 
and sisters. May His Spirit abide in. 
your hearts. May we be united and 
faithful. May we see our way clearly; 
never be befogged! never get in the- 
dark; never fall away from the truth, 
but maintain our morality and our-

purity among the children of men. You 
know the leading men among you; you 
know those that visit you in your own 
homes; you know your neighbors; you 
know one another; and you know that 
they are honest, virtuous, upright men, 
and they are not trespassing upon 
you or yours, but they are conscien- 
tious and true. It is not necessary, 
therefore, for anyone to tell us we are 
a bad people, because we know to the 
contrary. We are not wicked, and we 
have no evil designs against anybody 
in the world. We are working right- 
eousness, and we are earnestly engage ! 
in a good cause, and we are bringing 
ing to pass much righteousness for the 
salvation of the children of men. May 
God bless us, redeem us and save us in 
His celestial kingdom and presence, 
through Jesus Christ, the Lord. Amen.

ELDER J. G. DUFFIN. 
<President of Central States Mission.) 

I feel grateful in my soul to my 
Heavenly Father for the privilege of 
meeting with you in this conference to 
worship the Lord, and to have the 
pleasure of listening to the testimonies 
that are borne of the goodness of God 
and of the power of His Holy Spirit 
which is among His chosen people in 
this goodly land. I stand before you 
to represent one of the missions which, 
by the authority of God, has been es- 
tablished in these United States, cover- 
ing five of the States and two of the 
Territories of this great Union. The 
work in the Central States mission is 
in good condition. The people are in- 
creasing in faith and in their devotion 
to the work of our Father in Heaven. 
While I was listening yesterday to the 
testimonies of our brethren, and to the 
statements of our beloved President 
Joseph F. Smith concerning the tithes 
and offerings of the people, I thought 
if the payment of tithes and offerings 
by the people of the Church is likened 
unto a barometer, registering the con- 
dition that exists, then certainly that 



register in the Central States mission 
must be encouraging. Within the last 
five years the tithes of the members 
of the Church in the Central States 
mission have increased nearly six hun- 
dred per cent. The tithes paid last 
year showed an increase of more than 
fifty per cent over the tithes of the 
previous year. The poor in the mis- 
sion — whom we have also with us. as 
the Savior said — were supported largely 
from the offerings of the people. A 
year ago last January we set out to 
make that mission self-supporting, so 
far as help for the poor is concerned, 
and we were nearly successful. We hope 
in the future to be entirely successful. 
Through the teaching of this law of 
offerings for the support of the poor 
we have learned that the people are 
increasing in faith and in their love 
for the Gospel of Jesus Christ. 

In that mission we are doing a little 
in the way of colonizing. In the state 
of Texas we have a colony of sixty- 
three families, with a membership of 
three or four hundred people. In the 
eastern part of the State of Kansas we 
have another nice little colony, where a 
number of people have gathered to- 
gether, and they have built a house of 
worship and are now beautifying the 
grounds. During the past few vfears 
six or eight houses- of worship have 
been erected in the mission, by the do- 
nations of the people; and we have not 
as yet found it necessary to call upon 
our brethren for contributions from the 
tjlbes for this purpose. The people in 
that part of the Lord's vineyard have 
manifested their faith in putting up 
these buildings for their own conveni- 
ence. Doubtless in the future some 
help will be required from the Church 
in the erection of our mission building, 
for which we are now collecting means, 
and which will probably be located in 
that city around which cluster so many 
memories that are dear to the Latter- 
day Saints — the city of Independence, 
in. Jackson county, Missouri. 

My brethren and sisters, in our as- 
sociations with your husbands and 
sons, and with a few of your daughters, 
who have been sent out there to carry 



30 



GENERAL, CONFERENCE. 



the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ un- 
to their fellows, we have experienced 
great joy and satisfaction; for we have 
learned to love them. There is a bond 
of union between us which we feel will 
not be broken in time nor in eternitv. 
Thev are devoted and faithful in their 
work. Every missionary that is la- 
boring in that mission gives support 
with his whole soul unto those men 
whom God has placed to lead and di- 
rect latter-day Israel. We are not 
tender about teaching the revelations 
of the Lord to our brethren and sisters 
in the world. The eternal principles 
of the Gospel are brought before them 
in plaiivness; nevertheless, we seek to 
use wisdom and discretion in our teach- 
ings. 

This in the work of our Father in 
Heaven. It has been established by 
revelation direct from Him. The work 
that is being done today we know is in 
fulfillment of the word of the Lord 
through His Prophets in former dis- 
pensations, pertaining to the redemp- 
tion and salvation of His children in the 
latter days. While I have been 
tmnhing over this latter-day work, a 
few of the words of the Prophet Isaiah 
have come forcibly to my mind, and I 
will take the liberty of reading them in 
your hearing. You will find them re- 
corded in the twenty-ninth chapter of 
Isaiah. Speaking of the work in which 
you and I are engaged; speaking of a 
tiered record that was to come forth, 
then the work that was to follow its 
corning forth and the effect it should 
have upon those who accepted it and 
upon those who opposed it, he said: 

"The meek also shall increase their 
joy in the Lord, and the poor among 
men shall rejoice in the Holy One of 
Israel." 

As I sat in this congregation yester- 
day and noted the joy and satisfaction 
that were depicted upon the counten- 
ances of the thousands assembled, I 
could not help but think that surely 
the words of the Lord are being ful- 
filled today, for the meek are indeed in- 
creasing their joy in the Lord and the 
poor among men are rejoicing in the 
Holy One of Israel. 



"For the terrible one is brought to 
naught, and the scorner is consumed, 
and all that watch for iniquity are cut 
off: 

"That make a man an offender for a 
word, and lay a snare for him that re- 
proveth in the gate, and turn aside the 
just for a thing of nought." 

It is no new thing, brethren and sis- 
ters, for those who do not love the Lord 
and who will not keep the command- 
ments of God and observe the princi- 
ples of purity, to lift their hands and 
their voices against those holding the 
authority of the Holy Priesthood. I say- 
to you that he who raises his hand 
against the Church of Christ strikes at 
me as an individual. He who raises his 
voice against men whom God has placed 
at the head of His work strikes at me 
as an individual. Why do I feel thus? 
Because all the blessings that have 
come to me and my family have come 
through this work that God has estab- 
lished. The sacred ordinances and 
blessings that we have received as a 
family have come to us through that 
authority which has been perpetuated 
in the men whom God has placed at 
the head of His work on the earth, who 
have held the keys of the Holy Priest- 
hood, and who have borne that author- 
ity with such faithfulness. So I feel 
that he who strikes at these men of 
God, and at the work of God, strikes 
at me as one of the members of the 
Church and places me upon the defen- 
sive. 

I feel encouraged in this work. With 
all my heart I am grateful that I am 
united with my brethren. I feel thank- 
ful for the blessings that the Lord has 
given to me and to mine. I am grate- 
ful for the spirit of faith that He has 
poured out upon your sons and daugh- 
ters in the mission field, and for the 
same spirit resting upon the people 
who have received their testimony. 
These principles are finding their way 
in the hearts of the people. They are 
acting as a leaven, and many of the 
prominent men, and even some of the 
ministers in our mission, are receiving 
these principles of eternal truth, though 
they do not render obedience unto the 
ordinances of the Gospel. Only the 
other day I received a letter from two 



ELDER BEN E. RICH. 



31 



of our faithful young- men who are 
down in the State of Texas, in which 
they related to me an interview they 
had recently with one of the prom- 
inent ministers of a popular church in 
that State. This man had read the 
Book of Mormon, and he said to these 
two Elders: "I know, young men, that 
we have got to begin to reorganize the 
line of work in our church, and we 
must conform more nearly to those 
principles that you Mormons are teach- 
ing unto the people." On every hand we 
have these testimonies coming to us. 
Let me say further, that the spirit in 
which your sons and daughters go 
among the people is finding its way into 
their hearts, and even ministers of the 
world who have bitterly fought this 
work are beginning in a measure to 
partake of that spirit, and they have 
more of the spirit of charity toward 
the servants of God than they have 
had. 

My brethren and sisters, my testi- 
mony to you this day is that God lives, 
that Jesus is His Christ, and that the 
man who stands at the head of the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints is the man whom God has chos- 
en, and He will uphold and sustain him, 
together with his brethren. May God 
bless you forever. I ask it in the name 
of Jesus our Lord. Amen. 

ELDER BEN E. RICH. 
(President of Southern States Mission,) 

Within the last two months, it has 
been my privilege to meet with the 
Elders who are laboring in the States 
of Virginia, South Carolina, North Car- 
olina, Georgia, Florida and Kentucky, 
and I expect, in the next two months, 
to have the privilege of meeting with 
my brethren who are laboring in the 
two conferences of Tennessee and in 
Mississippi, Alabama and Ohio. The 
work of the Lord is progressing very 
nicely in the Southern States Mission. 
There is a gradual growth all the time. 
It is seldom a week goes by without ad- 
ditions being made to the Church of 
Jesus Christ. Sometimes we have as 
many as fifty to eighty new baptisms 
in one month. We are rather in an 



unfortunate condition for help. I have 
the reputation with the authorities of 
the church of being a monumental beg- 
gar for missionaries. At one time we 
had Ave [hundred and sixty Elders 
laboring in that mission. We have not 
one-third of that number today. Our 
members are scattered very badly, and 
we have not missionaries enough to 
visit and look after the members of 
the Church, owing to their scattered 
condition. Wherever our Elders go 
they meet with success. They do so 
even in the days of persecution. God 
works with them. They are happy in 
their missionary labors, and their tes- 
timonies are increasing. I am very 
much encouraged in the missionary 
work there. 

If you know any young men who are 
laboring in that mission or in any other 
mission, do you ever ask yourself the 
question as to how the parents of those 
Elders are situated, and whether they 
are able to maintain them in the mis- 
sion field? All the Elders need clothes 
and shoes and other necessaries, and 
I wonder if the thought ever enters 
into your minds that it is your duty 
to help your neighbors bear the burden 
that rests upon them when they have 
a son or a husband upon a mission. 

Another thing: you young men who 
are about to go upon missions, let me 
say a word to you, — and I believe I can 
safely speak for the president of every 
mission who has spoken here, and for 
Brother McQuarrie, who probably will 
speak. You do not know what clothing 
you will need until you get there. If 
an Elder comes to our mission, he must 
go where his services are the most 
needed; and if, before leaving home, 
he obtains a suit of clothes that is 
suitable for Ohio, and his services are 
needed down in Mississippi, Alabama 
or Florida, he will go there and suffer 
from the heat. I would advise every 
young man to wait until he gets to 
mission headquarters, to find out where 
he is going, and then become clothed 
in a way that will be the most com- 
fortable. 

I never saw a day in my life when 
I was more satisfied with the prin- 
ciples of the gospel and the condition 



32 



GENERAL, CONFERENCE. 



of the Church than I am today. I never 
rejoiced more than I have over the tes- 
timonies which I have listened to yes- 
terday and today; and I may be par- 
doned if I call your attention to one 
little matter. I was especially inter- 
ested in the faithful testimony borne 
by Elder Hugh J. Cannon concerning 
the principles of the gospel, and the 
lessons that were given to him by his 
father regarding his duty to love and 
uphold the one who is now at the head 
of the Church. I was also interested in 
the testimonies of Elders Rulon S. 
Wells and Nephi Pratt. I single these 
brethren out because thousands of you 
have listened to the testimonies of their 
fathers, who once occupied positions of 
prominence in the church, and who are 
now dead. Every man in this church 
is going to be placed in a position 
where he will be tried and tested so 
that he will have the privilege of know- 
ing for himself that the gospel is true, 
and not simply believe it because his 
father is one of the authorities of 
the Church. I have listened to the tes- 
timony of three generations of Apostles 
in this building. I rejoice that I know 
the gospel is true just as well as I 
did when my father lived, and my 
brothers and sisters know that it is 
true just as well as they did when he 
Jived. The children of other dlead 
apostles and prophets, who have kept 
the faith and lived near enough the 
Lord to drink in the inspiration of His 
word, also know that the gospel of 
Jesus Christ is true tod-ay as well as 
they did in the days of their fathers. 
They know, too, that the man who 
stands at the head of the Church today 
is called of God, and is blessed with 
the same power and authority as the 
man who stood at the head of the 
Church in the days when their fathers 
sat upon this, stand. I rejoice in this; 
and I bear witness to you today that 
I do not believe there has ever been 
a man at the head of the Church more 
willing to listen to the voice of God 
and to receive a message from Him 
than the one who stands at the head 
today He occupies that position today 
in literal fulfillment of prophecies ut- 



tered by those who have occupied the 
same position before. I used to live 
in Ogden. Some of you brethren who 
live in Ogden may remember the time 
you sat in the Ogden tabernacle, many 
years ago, and listened to the voice 
of prophecy from the lips of President 
Wilford Woodruff, when he predicted 
in the name of God, and told the peo- 
ple to write it down and remember 
it, that Joseph F. Smith would be 
president of this Church, and you know 
by the way in which it was spoken, 
that it came from God; and you know, 
too, that it has been fulfilled by the will 
of God the Eternal Father. 

I .know that as long as we receive 
the whisperings of the Spirit we will 
never doubt the divine mission of the 
one whom God places at the head of 
ithe Ohruch. Those who cannot be 
tried from the outside will be tried 
from the inside, until every individual 
is tested. God is no respecter of per- 
sons. The son of the most obscure and 
unassuming man that ever joined the 
Church and the son of the mightiest 
prophet that God has given to us in 
this dispensation, will stand upon an 
equal footing in this respect. All of 
them will have their tests, and God will 
have a tried people. Sometimes I feel 
as though this people cannot live as 
they should live without the voice of 
the wolf being heard upon the outside. 
We are like a flock of sheep. Tou who 
are in the sheep business know how 
it is with a herd of sheep. They grad- 
ually cross and separate, but it only 
takes the howl of one or two wolves 
to bring them all together again. Jesus 
Christ said that the kingdom of God 
is like a net cast into the sea, which 
draws to the shore fish of all kinds. 
The gospel net draws to Zion all kinds. 
They must be tried and assorted, and 
some of them go back into the world. 

I have been fishing for many years, 
and I know I have caught lots of poor 
fish, and some who have come to Zion 
no doubt will be so tried that they will 
go back and swim off. Every man in 
the Chruch will be tried. But God 
lives. This is His work. The puny 
hands of man may try to stay the pro-

gress of it, but it will go right on 
; nevertheless; while they who try to 
stay its progress will die and be for- 
gotten. 

As has been said by some of the 
brethren, many people in the world are 
becoming converted to the correctness 
of the principles of the gospel, and 
are adapting them to their own be- 
liefs and teachings. Many people per- 
secute us with honest hearts. Not over 
three weeks ago I was standing on 
the streets of one of the largest cities 
of the south when a young man, who 
is being educated for the ministry, 
came up to me and told me that a pro- 
fessor of theology — the man who was 
training him to be a minister of the 
gospel — had stated that he had been to 
Salt Lake and that "Mormon" Elders 
always referred to their wives as 
cows; and, said the young man, "I 
know that he spoke the truth, because 
he is a good man." I replied, "he is 
a monumental liar." Some of these 
ministers may be opposing us with 
an honest purpose, but I tell you there 
are lots of them that are opposing us 
because they are naturally as mean as 
the devil. Sometimes the Irish blood in- 
my veins makes me feel like breaking 
loose long enough to tell such defamers 
of the truth to go where they belong; 
but there is no necessity for me to do 
that, they will go there anyhow. 

I bear witness unto you that I know 
that God lives. I know that this is 
His truth. I know that the man who 
stands at the head of this Church is 
a prophet, seer and revelator, and 
those who stand with him are the same. 
I hope that God will continue to 
whisper to them, no matter whether 
it is commercialism or not. I hope they 
will be wise enough to place us in a 
position sometime so that if a temple 
is needed in Jackson County we will 
know where the money is to build it, 
and not be compelled to go begging for 
it; or if temples are wanted in other 
places, that there will be funds on 
hand to build them, and that they will 
not have to be started without a dol- 
lar in sight. Don't you be afraid of 
anything they are doing; they can 
not go very far astray, God will not 



let them. I bear witness unto you 
that the gospel is true, and that it will 
prevail, no matter how much the 
wolves may howl. Whether they come 
from the world or go from us out into 
the world, they cannot stay the pro- 
gress of God's work. It is His eternal 
plan of life and salvation, and will 
save and exalt those who are faithful 
to it. Amen. 

The choir sang the anthem, "Let 
the mountains shout for joy."

Preston. 

AFTERNOON SESSION. 

Singing by the choir and congrega- 
tion: 

"Now let us rejoice in the day of sal- 
vation, 

No longer as strangers on earth nee 1 
we roam; 

Good tidings are sounding for us and 
each nation, 
And shortly the hour of redemption 
will come." 

Prayer was offered by Elder Joseph 
E. Taylor. 

The choir sang the hymn which be- 
gins: 

"Ye simple souls who stray 
Far from the path of peace, 

That lonely, unfrequented way 
To life and happiness."

Remarkable Development and Numerous 
Changes in Church Affairs.— Toung 
People Should be Prepared for Futur,- 
Responsibilties.— Predictions of An- 
cient Prophets Now Being Fulfilled. 

Brethren and sisters, I have greatly 
rejoiced in the spirit of this conference 
and in the great gatherings of the Lat- 
ter-day Saints within this building. 
There was a time when the Latter-day 
Saints were weak in numbers. That 
time was the 6th day of April, 1830, 
Today, however, the people of the Lord 
are strong — strong in faith, strong in 
experience, and reasonably strong in 
numbers. Today we have 55 stakes of 
Zion, with 629 wards, and 14 missions 
in the world; and there is no ward in 
Zion but has a larger membership than 
the whole Church had 75 years ago. I 
remember the Time, although I was but 
a boy, when a great canvas was 
stretched across the center of this 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



building, because at that time the place 
was too large and it was difficult even 
to fill one half of the building with Lat- 
ter-day Saints. Today the Tabernacle 
is not adequate. I do not remember to 
have witnessed so large a gathering at 
the first session of our conference as 
we had yesterday morning, and we 
have today a vast congregation of Lat- 
ter-day Saints, numbering perhaps be- 
tween 8,000 and 10,000. This is a very 
remarkable showing. It is encouraging 
to witness the growth and progress of 
the work of God. 

Some very wonderful changes have 
occurred since the organization of the 
Church. I call your attention to the 
fact that there are but few people with- 
in the sound of my voice today who 
were acquainted with the Prophet Jo- 
seph Smith, or who saw him in life. 
Most of his eontemporariss have passed 
away. I call your attention to some 
oiher changes that have taken place, 
suggested to my mind by the remarks 
of President Lund when he alluded to 
the fact that this was the seventy-fifth 
annual conference of the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Since 
our organization as a Church five Presi- 
dents have passed away; six counselors 
to the Presidents, 11 Apostles — nearly a 
full quorum of those who were faithful 
— have passed into the spirit world; 11 
members of the First Council of Seven- 
ties, and three Presiding Bishops have 
also gone. But this change is not so 
remarkable, in my opinion, as what has 
occurred in our own time, within the 
brief period of 13 years. Since the year 
1892, two Presidents of the Church have 
passed beyond— Presidents Wilford 
Woodruff and Lorenzo Snow; one coun- 
selor in the Presidency, President 
George Q. Cannon; the following Apos- 
tles: Franklin D. Richards, Abraham 
H. Cannon, Brig-ham Young, Jr., and 
Abraham O. Woodruff; three of the 
First Council of Seventies: Jacob Gates, 
John Morgan and Edward Stevenson; 
and of the other general authorities, 
Brother Karl G. Maeser, general sup- 
erintendent of Church schools, and 
Brother George Goddard, first assistant 
general superintendent of the Sunday 



schools of the Church, and John JaQues, 
assistant Church historian. Thirteen 
years ago there were 33 stakes of Zion; 
today there are 55 stakes, or an. in- 
crease of 22 in 13 years. Of the 33 Pres- 
idents of stakes then living 11, or one- 
third of the number, have passed away. 
So that in all 21 of the general authori- 
ties of the Church out of the 26 have 
closed their labors here and passed into 
the spirit world. To me this is very 
remarkable, and it shows that great 
changes are going on, almost without 
notice. What may we expect, breth- 
ren and sisters, in the course of 20 or 
30 or 50 years to come? Whether we dis- 
guise it or not, the fact still remains 
that the boys and girls of today will 
be the men and women of tomorrow. 
The authority resting upon the men 
of today will speedily descend to their 
children; and this emphasizes the need 
and the importance of the quorums of 
the Holy Priesthood and the auxiliary 
organizations of the Church. Many 
parents among us are very busy men 
and women; they are engaged in the 
various avocations of life, in order to 
provide for their families, and they do 
not seem to have very much time to de- 
vote to the teaching of their children. 
But a way is provided in the quorums 
of the Priesthood and in these organ- 
izations whereby the children may be 
taught in the things of the Lord. We 
have various grades of the Priesthood 
in the Church, from the Deacon up to 
the High Priest. There is no principle 
in this Church of so great importance 
and consequence to us as the authority 
of the Priesthood. This authority 
sl.ould be fostered and nourished, and 
the quorums should be strengthened 
and supported by the Latter-day Saints. 
Every man, every young man, and 
every boy who holds the Priesthood 
should do his duty. We should also 
foster and encourage the auxiliary or- 
ganizations of the Church. The Relief 
society, the Sunday school, the Mu- 
tual Improvement association, the Pri- 
mary and the Religion class, all 
should have our support; and 
parents should see to it that their 
children are sent to these places

of instruction, that they may be pre- 
pared and fitted for the great responsi- 
bility that will rest upon them in the 
near future. And notwithstanding, 
brethren and sisters, that prominent 
men and women, pillars of the Church, 
men and women of power, of strength 
and of faith, are passing away, still 
the Church goes on. That is charac- 
teristic of this work. I call your at- 
tention to the fact that some very re- 
markable predictions have been made 
concerning the work in which we are 
engaged. It was known of old. Even 
Daniel the prophet saw this work. You 
will remember, doubtless, the great 
vision of Nebuchadnezzar, which he 
could not call to mind. He had had a 
vision in the night time, in which he 
beheld wonderful things; but it was 
taken from his mind. He sent for the 
astrologers and wise men of Babylon, 
and he wanted to know from them 
what his vision was, and also the in- 
terpretation; but the wise men could 
not help him. If he could only re- 
call the vision, why then they might 
give to him the interpretation; but he 
could not do it. Then Daniel, of the 
despised Hebrew people, was called in 
to make known the vision of the king; 
and Daniel used these very remark- 
able words — words that I consider re- 
markable in view of the present atti- 
tude of the world on the question of 
revelation: 

"There is a God in heaven that re- 
vealeth secrets, and maketh known to 
the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall 
be in the latter days." 

Here was declared a God who reveal- 
eth secrets and speaketh to the chil- 
dren of men, a God of revelation. That 
was the God that Daniel worshiped, 
and that was the God who would make 
known to the king what he had seen 
in the vision of the night. Daniel 
thereupon interpreted the vision. The 
king had seen a great image of gold, 
of silver, of brass, of iron, and of iron 
and clay mixed together. The image 
represented kingdoms of the world 
that should reach from Nebuchadnez- 
zar's reign down to the end of time, 
the head being typical of Babylon as 
it existed in those ancient days. Other

kingdoms were to follow Babylon, until 
the feet and the toes were reached, 
which were typical of kingdoms which 
should be established in the latter 
days. And Daniel said: 

"In the days of these kings shall 
the God of heaven set up a kingdom, 
which shall never be destroyed; and 
the kingdom shall not be left to other 
people, but it shall break in pieces and 
consume all these kingdoms, and it 
shall stand forever." 

The Prophet Isaiah had his eye upon 
the same event, and if he had been 
here yesterday and written the things 
that are published in King James' 
translation of the Bible, and which 
were inscribed thousands of years agr 
he could not have set forth the condi- 
tion of this people more clearly than 
he did. If I remember correctly, the 
words of Isaiah were something like 
this: 

"And it shall come to pass in the 
last days, that the mountain of the 
Lord's house shall be established in 
the top of the mountains, and shall 
be exalted above the hills; and all 
nations shall flow unto it. 

"And many people shall go and say. 
Come ye, and let us go up to the 
mountain of the Lord, to the house of 
the God of Jacob; and he will teach us 
of his ways, and we will walk in his 
paths; for out of Zion shall go forth 
the law, and the word of the Lord from 
Jerusalem." 

And again Isaiah says: 

"O Zion, that bringest good tidings 
get thee up into the high mountain." 

And again: 

"For the Lord shall comfort Zion: 
he will comfort all her waste places; 
and he will make her wilderness like 
Eden, and her desert like the garden of 
the Lord; joy and gladness shall be 
found therein, thanksgiving, and the 
voice of melody." 

This vast congregation are living 
witnesses of the literal fulfillment of 
these words of the prophet. Was not 
this land a veritable wilderness in the 
year 1847? Has it not been trans- 
formed into a garden like Eden? This 
land has become choice above all 
other lands. We want no better. And 
I am inclined to think that the Lord 
can lead us to no better land than we 
have at the present time, unless a 



36 



GENERAL. CONFERENCE. 



special blessing is conferred upon the 
land beyond what we have received. 
And in this conference we have seen 
the joy of the people; we have wit- 
nessed their gladness. We have heard 
the voice of thanksgiving from this 
stand, from the lips of the Elders of 
Israel. Here in this choir we have 
heard the voice of melody. Isaiah 
must have had his eye upon these oc- 
casions; and in the great visions that 
were given to him he must have wit- 
nessed the gatherings of the people of 
the Lord. Oh, how our hearts have 
been made to rejoice upon this occa- 
sion! 

Brethren and sisters, I testify that 
this is the work of the Lord. I testi- 
fy to you that I have witnessed with 
my own eyes that Isaiah was a proph- 
et of God, and that Daniel was a true 
prophet. Their words are finding ful- 
fillment. This is the work of God, and 
not of man; and any man, in the 
Church or out of it, who pits himself 
against this work is measuring arms 
with the Almighty, and his effort will 
be futile, his folly will be manifest in 
the eyes of the people. You will re- 
member, brethren and sisters, that the 
Prophet Joseph obtained a promise 
from the Lord as he went forth to 
preach the Gospel of repentance unto 
this generation. The Lord said to 
him: 

"Wherefore, let them bring forth 
their strong reasons against the Lord 
[not against Joseph and his brethren, 
for they were but the representatives 
of the Lord]. Verily, thus saith the 
Lord unto you, no weapon that iS 
formed against you shall prosper; and 
if any man shall lift his voice against 
you, he shall be confounded in due 
time." 

Mark you, these are not the words of 
Joseph Smith the Prophet, but the 
revelation of God to him. This is the 
work of Jesus Christ, and not the 
work of Joseph Smith, nor of any of 
his successors, nor of any man upon 
the earth. I rejoice in this testimony. 
I rejoice in the teachings of this con- 
ference, and in the blessed words of 
comfort and consolation which we have 
received. I rejoice in the union of the 
Latter-day Saints. They begin to 



show forth the fruits of seventy -five 
years of experience in the work. The 
words of President Lyman sank deep 
into my heart when he referred to 
the experience and to the faith and 
faithfulness of the Latter-day Saints. 
That is my testimony and it has been 
confirmed in my visits to the Stakes 
of Zion. I rejoice in my fellowship 
with the Latter-day Saints, and in my 
acquaintance and association with the 
authorities of the Church, with the 
Presidencies of the Stakes, and with 
all the brethren and sisters. May the 
Lord bless us, and may He sustain His 
work, and bring us off victorious and 
triumphant, is my prayer in the name 
of Jesus. Amen. 

Sister Olea Shipp sang, "Be with me, 
O Lord." 

ELDER J. G. McQUARRIE. 

(President of Eastern States Mission.)- 
Yesterday afternoon I had the pleas- 
ure of sitting shoulder to shoulder with 
six other Presidents, co-laborers in 
the mission fields of the United States, 
and I wish I could explain the feeling 
of strength and sympathy that passed 
through my being in thus associating 
with my fellow-laborers. Ella Wheeler 
Wilcox expressed in a poetic way a 
truth intensely felt by the Latter-day 
Saints, when she said: 

"There is an unseen cord which binds 

the whole wide world together; 
Through every human heart it winds 

its one mysterious tether. 
It links all races and all minds within 

their span allotted, 
And death alone unties the strand 

which God Himself hath knotted." 

But I would like to change the last 
part of that, and say that even death 
does not sever these cords of brother- 
hood and fellowship that God ties in 
our hearts and in our souls. We cannot 
overestimate the strength of sympathy. 
The idea of government in the Church 
is the voice of God and the consent of 
the people, and hence those who offici- 
ate in any of the offices of the Church- 
must look for their strength, not only 
in the favor of God but also in the con- 
fidence of their brothers and sisters- 



ELDER J. G. MoQUARRIE.

The most touching appeal I have read 
from the far east was written by a 
(Russian officer complaining because, 
when they looked to Russia for strength 
they found division, contention and 
lack of sympathy among their own 
people, and literature was scattered in 
their ranks urging the men to lay down 
their arms, while they were facing a 
foe moved on and stimulated to almost 
superhuman strength by the sympathy, 
the unity and the power of sentiment 
that came to them from their own 
country. Those who are interested in 
the missionary work want to know 
what we are doing in the field. Perhaps 
they think we come here with the idei 
that we are going to tell about great 
things we are doing out on the battle 
line; but we come here with 
different feelings. Our thoughts 
are something like this: We 
are going to the strongholds 
of Zion; we are going to see the unity 
of the home guard; we are going to look 
upon the sources from which we may 
draw strength to continue our work; 
we are going to hear the voice of in- 
spiration, and clasp hands with our 
leaders and with our co-workers. This 
is the way I feel today. I want to 
clasp hands with those whose hearts 
beat in unison with my own. 

There is so much that should be said 
that what I have to say seems to me 
of so little importance that I do not 
feel like taking much of your time to 
tell it; yet perhaps there is no part 
of the work of Zion that is not im- 
portant. In listening to the reports 
that have been made, the earnest testi- 
monies that have been borne, and the 
voice of inspiration we have heard in 
this conference, I feel that I can be a 
stronger and a better man. Long- 
fellow said that we desired to walk be- 
neath the shadow of great names. This 
is illustrated by the fact that churches 
bear the names of great men. As men, 
we are timid in relation to our own 
opinion, and feel like resting our faith 
beneath the shadow of great names; 
but as Latter-day Saints we are taught 
to rest our faith beneath the shadow 
of bat one name — that of Jesus Christ. 



But while we know that we should not 
pin our faith to men, we also realize 
that we can receive strength from each 
other. 

I have labored in the mission field as 
a traveling Elder, as a conference presi- 
dent, and as a mission president, and 
I understand the feelings of the Elders 
as they go up against the stone walls 
of prejudice that seem to confront us. 
Individually we feel we are accom- 
plishing very little, but when the Elders 
report to their conference presidents, 
and they in turn report to the mission 
president at the close of the year, and 
we figure up how many homes have 
been visited by Elders bearing testi- 
mony of the restored Gospel.how many 
hundreds of thousands of tracts have 
been delivered, how many books 
have been sold or given away, 
how many meetings have been 
held, and sermons preached, and 
baptisms performed, then we rea- 
lize that something has been done. 
And when we think of this record be- 
ing united with those of all the other 
missions in the world, and then con- 
template the compilation of such for 
the last seventy years, we realize that 
it comprises one of the grandest, one 
of the most glorious missionary reports 
ever recorded in the history of the 
world. And when the clouds of envy, 
and hatred, and persecution shall have 
rolled away, and when the future his- 
torian shall trace to their source the 
many streams that have united togeth- 
er- to form the millennial sea of peace, 
it will be conceded that a stream of 
powerful influence has flown down from 
the mountains of Israel. 

In a recent magazine article written 
upon the so-called "Evil of Mormon- 
ism," the writer said: "We must first 
admit and understand the inherent 
power of Mormonism, before we can 
cope with this religion. The energy 
and zeal put forth by the Mormon 
Elders ought to put to shame any 
Christian denomination in the world." 
This is said, and yet they have only 
commenced to learn what a great work 
is being done by the Latter-day Saints. 

I bear my testimony to you who have 



38 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



made great sacrifices, to you who have 
performed many noble deeds, and to 
the Elders in the world laboring for the 
spread of truth, that these actions and 
deeds will not fade away in the gray 
mist of the past and be forgotten, but 
they will rise like a glorious scroll up- 
on the horizon of the future, and stand 
as a justification of the righteous and 
condemnation of the wicked. I feel 
strong in the support of my brethren 
and sisters and the Elders with whom 
I work. One young man, when he was 
told by his opponents that they were 
going to overcome the work with which 
he was associated, said, "How are you 
going to do it? We are here to work 
for it; we are here to sacrifice our 
means for it; we are here, if necessary, 
to die for it; how are you going to 
stop it?" With thousands of such men 
and women, and with God on our side, 
we will eventually be victorious. Even 
if assassins put such men to death, 
their death, like the guns of Concord, 
would send an echo round the world, 
and probably would be a more effective 
testimony than our preaching. 

As there has been some voice, some 
word, some murmuring heard through 
the land against our prophet-leader, it 
is natural that his friends should rally 
to his support and give expression to 
their feeling. This morning, President 
Ben E. Rich bore testimony to the fact 
that he knew President Joseph P. Smith 
had his ears open to hear the voice of 
God, and was ever ready to heed the 
whisperings of the Holy Spirit. I want 
to bear my testimony to the fact that 
he also has his ears open to his fellow- 
men, and that he sympathizes with 
them. He has not forgotten, as others 
have often done, "That the love of the 
Lord and of man are one." When I 
stood here six months ago I had a rath- 
er heavy heart, because our mission was 
without a home. We had been forced 
to leave our headquarters because of 
the agitation then going on, and were 
obliged to take shelter with the con- 
ference president in a little room about 
10x18. I thought I would appeal to the 
authorities of the Church and see if we 
could not get some aid to establish 



ourselves firmer in t^he city of New 
Tork, where it was important that the 
Latter-day Saints should be well repre- 
sented and established; but, I accident- 
ally heard that the funds of the Church 
had already been so divided, there had 
been so many calls, that word had been 
sent out that improvements not already 
started should not be commenced dur- 
ing that year. Still I felt I must ask 
for aid, and I testify that my appea'i 
received kind consideration, and five 
thousand dollars was given to us to 
make the first payment on a place we 
might call our own in the city of New 
Tork. Part of your tithing has gone 
there, my brethren and sisters, and I 
hope you do not regret it. 

Last Monday I was in the city of Chi- 
cago. It was the first time I had th; 
privilege of visiting the headquarters 
of the Church there, and while looking 
for the number I saw in bold letters 
across the front of a beautiful edifice 
the words "The Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints." I have seen many 
churches the last four years, but I 
had never before seen the name of 
Jesus Christ written across the front 
of any of them. We should feel hon- 
ored in erecting churches to His name, 
and I trust a similar building may soon 
be seen in the city of New York. 

Since we have been established in 
our own home, my notice has been 
called to a prophecy recorded in Ne- 
phi, 14th chapter, 10-12 verses. I hope 
you will read it, my brethren and sis- 
ters. It was a source of inspiration to 
me, because it describes the great 
struggle that you and I have to make. 
Nephi speaks of the great battle be- 
tween righteousness and wickedness 
which should continue until there 
would be only two churches — the 
Church of God and the church of the 
devil; that the latter*would have great 
dominions in all parts of the world, and 
that the Church of the Lamb of God 
should also be upon all the face of the 
earth, but its possessions would be 
small. Now, we have been gathering 
people from all nations, and no effort 
has been made until lately to obtain 
possessions, even small ones, in various 



ELDER BRIGHAM H. ROBERTS. 



parts of the world. These have not 
been secured for the purpose of fulfill- 
ing that prophecy. Instructions on this 
matter did not come to us from the 
President of the Church; but the move- 
ment seemed to come as an inspiration, 
almost simultaneously in all parts of 
the world. When I asked President 
Smith a year ago, as I was returning 
to my mission, if he had any counsel 
to give me, he said: "You have our 
confidence, and the time has come when 
men must go out into the world and 
live near enough to the Lord that they 
can receive their inspiration from Him, 
and build up Zion wherever they are 
called to labor, without the personal 
assistance and continued counsel of the 
general authorities of the Church." I 
testify that this desire to have places 
of our own in the world has burned 
in the hearts of the Saints, and it has 
been forced upon the Mission Presi- 
dents, until now from Norway and 
Sweden, from England and Denmark, 
from the islands of the sea, and from 
"all parts of the United States, we hear 
reports that they are established upon 
their own ground. I thank the Lord 
we now have a place we can call oui 
own, and we feel that Zion is becoming 
more firmly rooted. When I read this 
prophecy recorded in the 14th chapter 
of Nephi, I thought that possibly the 
prophets of old even saw this 
little work that we are doing. 
What a glorious thing it is 
to join with the Prophets of old 
fulfilling their words, and accomplish- 
ing the purposes of God. 

My brothers and sisters, there is, it is 
true, some agitation throughout the 
country against us, and many things 
are being said to injure our reputation. 
But why should we worry about our 
reputation? Let our anxiety be for our 
characters. No one can soil my char- 
acter but myself. No one can soil the 
character of the Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints, but the characters 
of its members may be soiled by their 
own misdeeds. A short time ago I read 
in the New York Herald the statement 
that after all that had been written and 
spoken, there was no source to which a 



scholar could go to get reliable infor- 
mation in regard to the "Mormon" peo- 
ple, because that which had been writ- 
ten had been blackened by prejudice or 
colored by zeal. I was glad that I could 
answer the writer by saying: There is 
one history written that zeal cannot 
color and prejudice cannot efface. That 
history has been written with the iron 
pen of industry. Its scroll has been 
rolled out from Canada on the north to 
Mexico on the south, covering like a 
beautiful veil the great desert of Amer- 
ica. That history has been engraved 
with winding streams, checkered fields, 
and fruitful gardens. It has been illus- 
trated with great cities, nestling vil- 
lages, and happy homes. It is vital- 
ized and vivified by hundreds of thous- 
ands of happy men and women, rejoic- 
ing in the blessings of liberty and an 
intelligent faith in God. And this his- 
tory will live, while yellow journalsm 
will die and be forgotten. The men and 
women who have written this history 
will be remembered and honored by 
thousands who reap the fruits of what 
they have sown, while those who have 
vilified and persecuted them will go 
down either to disgrace or oblivion. 

God grant that we may live up to the 
high ideals that have been given to us, 
that we may be able to preserve the 
heritage that has been intrusted to our 
care, and bequeath it, not lessened, to 
those who may follow after us. I ask 
it in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER BRIGHAM H. ROBERTS. 

I am going to ask you to listen to 
a few passages of scripture. 

"The heavens declare the glory of 
God; and the firmament showeth His 
handiwork. 

"Day unto day uttereth speech, and 
night unto night showeth knowledge. 

"There 'is no speech nor language 
where their voice is not heard. 

"There line is gone out through all the 
earth, and their words to the end of 
the world." 

Such is the language of David, 
Prophet and King of Israel. 

"There is a spirit in man; and the 
inspiration of the Almighty giveth 
them understanding." 



40 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



That is Job. 

"For the prophecy came not in old 
time by the will of man; but holy 
men of God spake as they were moved 
by the Holy Ghost." 

Such is the language of the chief of 
the apostles in the dispensation of the 
meridian of time. 

"For God speaketh once, yea twice, 
yet man preceiveth it not. 

"In a dream, in a vision of the night, 
when deep sleep falleth upon men, in 
slumberings upon the bed; 

"Then he openeth the ears of men.and 
sealeth their instruction." 

That is Job again. 

"And it came to pass, as Moses 
entered into the tabernacle, the cloudy 
pillar descended, and stood at the door 
of the tabernacle, and the Lord talked 
with Moses. 

"And all the people saw the cloudy 
pillar stand at the tabernacle door: 
and all the people rose up and wor- 
shiped, every man in his tent door. 

"And the Lord spake unto Moses face 
to face, as a man speaketh unto his 
friend." 

All these examples of revelations 
from God to man are from the Old 
Testament. If you turn to the New 
Testament you will find that all these 
modes of revelation are to be found 
upon its pages. I will read one or two 
passages from the New Testament. 

"For the invisible things of him from 
the creation of the world are clearly 
seen, being understood by the things 
that are made, even his eternal power 
and Godhead;" 

Such are the words of Paul, the 
apostle of the gentiles. 

"And Jesus, when he was baptized, 
went up straightway out of the water: 
and, lo, the heavens were opened unto 
him [that is, unto John the Baptist, 
who was to be a witness that Jesus of 
Nazereth was the Lamb of God, the 
Redeemer of the world; hence it was 
for him that the heavens were opened], 
and he saw the Spirit of God descend- 
ing like a dove, and lighting upon 
him: 

"And lo a voice from heaven saying, 
This is my beloved Son, in whom I 
am well pleased." 

Again, referring to Stephen at the 
very moment of his martyrdom: — 

"But he, being full of the Holy Ghost, 
looked up steadfastly into heaven, and 
saw the glory of God, and Jesus stand- 
ing on the right hand of God. 



"And said, Behold, I see the heavens 
opened, and the Son of man standing 
on the right hand of God." 

You who have followed me in the 
reading of these passages of the scrip- 
ture, have doubtless already concluded 
in your minds that it is my purpose 
to call your attention to the various 
modes through which God reveals Him- 
self to the children of men. You will 
observe that the first passage that I 
read calls attention to that species of 
revelation that is made known through 
the works of nature. "The heavens 
declare the glory of God." I presume 
there are no people living now or in 
past times but must have been im- 
pressed to a greater or less extent by 
that revelation which God gives of 
Himself through His works. Not only 
■Christian people, but the Mohammedan, 
the Buddhist, the Deist, are all im- 
pressed by that magnificient revela- 
tion of God's power and glory which 
may be seen in the magnitude of His 
works. The Deists, are of opinion 
that this revelation is all-sufficient as 
a foundation for natural religion. One 
high in authority among such people 
has declared that the wonderful struc- 
ture of the universe and everything 
we behold in creation proves to us bet- 
ter than books can the existence of God, 
and at the same time proclaims His 
attributes. "It is by the exercise of our 
reason," he continues, "that we are 
enabled to contemplate God in His 
work and to meditate His ways. When 
we see His care and goodness extended 
over His creatures, it teaches us our 
duties towards each other, while it 
calls forth our gratitude to Him." 

But great and magnificent as is this 
revelation of God's glory and power 
through His works, it is inadequate 
to meet all the requirements of man. 
There are great questions that the 
stars cannot answer. There are great 
problems that this world of ours can- 
not solve. I ask the question in the 
presence of this great revelation that 
comes from God, through nature. 
Whence is man, and the purpose of hi« 
existence? And the stars give no an- 
swer to that question. I ask the ques- 
tion, What is the purpose of humai 



ELDER B HIGH AM H. ROBERTS. 



41 



■existence? And nature gives no re- 
ply. I ask the question, What is the 
end of human existence? And from 
nature there comes no satisfactory an- 
swer. So that this revelation through 
nature, however splendid it may be, is 
not sufficient for guidance to the chil- 
dren of men. So say the Christiana 
of all sects. They hold that something 
must be learned more than can be 
learned through the revelations of na- 
ture. Hence they accept the revela- 
tions that come through the scriptures. 

I desire to call attention to Christian 
faith on this point, and I desire also 
to expound our faith, if I can, upon 
this great subject. 

Christians are pretty well united in 
believing that there Is a revelation of 
God through nature. They accept all 
there is in this revelation of nature, 
and in addition to that they believe 
that God is manifested in the history of 
the world. So also do we. They be- 
lieve, too, that there is a revelation 
from God through the human heart. 
So do we believe "there is a revelation 
in the intelligence that is in man. The 
Christian world also believe in special 
revelaitions from) God — revelaltions 
through inspiration, such as Job speaks 
of when he says that there is a spirit 
in man and the inspiration of the Al- 
mighty giveth them understanding. 
"This is the kind of revelation which 
has produced the scripture. Men spake, 
in olden times, as they were moved 
upon by the Holy Ghost, and what they 
said under such circumstances became 
the word of God, the will of God: 
and being reduced to writing and treas- 
ured up by the people, it has come 
down through the ages as holy writ. 
I say, all the Christians believe in 
that kind of revelation. So, too, do 
we. But there is a difference between 
our faith in respect of this class of 
special revelation and the belief of 
the various divisions of Christendom. 

I count myself happy that in conse- 
quence of the recent interest awakened 
on the subject of revelation we have 
in our city an utterance of the Chris- 
tian belief upon this subject. A prom- 
inent minister of our city has set forth, 



not only the views of the particular 
church of wlych he is the pastor, but 
also the views of the whole of Christen- 
dom with reference to this subject of 
revelation. I do not refer to his dis- 
course with any intention of entering 
upon a controversy. Far be that from 
me. I would not for the world, if I 
can help it, challenge the correctness 
of anything that may have been said 
by our fellow Christians. I do not feel 
antagonistic toward them. I am a 
man of peace. But this particular dis- 
course has afforded a good oppor- 
tunity of placing in contrast our be- 
liefs on the subject of revelation with 
the beliefs of the world, and I use it 
merely for this purpose. Sometimes, 
you know, we can appreciate things 
better when we see them in contrast 
than in any other way. 

And now in regard to special revela- 
tion by inspiration, whence comes our 
scriptures. This Christian teacher has 
this to say about it: 

"We are not only at one in gratefully 
receiving such scriptures as the faith- 
ful record of God's gracious revelations 
and the sure witness of Christ, but 
we are equally at one in denying that 
any such record or unveiling of the di- 
vine will has since been given, or ever 
will be given, for the guidance of man- 
kind." 

Why should such a conclusion as that 
be reached? When the great apostle 
of the Christian dispensation, unto 
whom Jesus had said: "I give unto 
you the keys of the kingdom, and 
whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth 
shall be bound in heaven," — when this 
man, clothed with the Holy Ghost, 
stood before the multitude in Jerus- 
alem, and they said unto him, "Men 
and brethren what shall we do?" He 
gave this memorable answer: "Repent, 
and be baptized every one of you, in 
the name of Jesus Christ for the re- 
mission of sins, and ye shall receive the 
gift of the Holy Ghost." Now mark 
you: "For the promise is unto you, 
and to your children, and to all that 
are afar off, even as many 'as tke Lord 
our God shall call." 

If Peter had designed to make this

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



promise of the Holy Ghost universal, 
I cannot for the life of me understand 
what language he could have used 
that would have made the promise 
more universal than the language he 
did use. This promise of the Holy 
Ghost, given as a result of obedience 
to the gospel, was to them, to their 
children, and to all that were afar off— 
a hundred years off, five hundred years 
off, five thousand years off — to all unto 
whom this message of repentance shall 
come this promise is made. Very well. 
How did we receive the scriptures? 
"Holy men of God spoke as they were 
moved upon by the Holy Ghost," that 
is how we came by the scriptures. 
"There is a spirit in man, and the in- 
spiration of the Almighty giveth them 
understanding." Now, if people are 
receiving the gospel today, I hold that 
they are entitled to the fulfillment of 
the promise that they shall receive 
the Holy Spirit — the power by which 
the scriptures were written. And hence 
our friends are confronted with the 
choice of one of two propositions; either 
they must say that men no longer re- 
ceive the Holy Ghost, when yielding 
obedience to the gospel, or else they 
must say that the Holy Ghost has lost 
His power to reveal the will of God 
to man. To say that, in my judgment, 
would be blasphemy. We Latter-day 
Saints do not say that. On the con- 
trary, we say that this Holy Spirit 
possesses all His powers, and those who 
receive that Spirit receive His powers 
and can exercise and enjoy them. 

Again: All Christians, together with 
ourselves, recognize that God manifests 
Himself through mighty works, called 
miracles. Yet listen to this discourse 
I am quoting on that mode of revela- 
tion: 

"While Christians are virtually at one 
in recognizing these invasions of the 
Divine will, they are well nigh as 
thoroughly agreed in denying that we 
have good reason to expect the con- 
tinuance of such marvels." 

Why? Whence came the miracles of 
scripture — the healing of the sick, 
prophecy, speaking in tongues, the in- 
terpretation of tongues, the gift of 
knowledge? They came from the pos- 



session of this same Spirit and power. 
This power, which is imminent in na- 
ture, which fashions and molds mat- 
ter as God wills— whence comes it? 
It comes from the possession and 
operation of this Holy Spirit. I re- 
peat again, that to deny to that Spirit 
the powers He is accredited with in 
scripture would be blasphemy. To 
deny Him His power would be to say 
that He was as salt that bath lost its 
savor. 

In common with our fellow Christians 
we believe in that mode of revelation 
by which men of God, such as Moses, 
Isaiah, Jeremiah, Peter, John, Paul, and 
the rest of the names which blazon the 
pages of sacred history, rose to such 
high privileges that, like Moses, some 
of them talked face to face with God, 
as a man talks with his friend. But 
while the Christian world believes that 
such revelation as this obtained in the 
past, listen to what is said of it at 
the present time: 

"Few Christians will deny that men 
of old had such revelations; few 
Christians will claim that we have 
reason to look for their continuance." 

Another mode of revelation recog- 
nized by ourselves and also by the 
Christian world is the revelation of 
God through Jesus Christ. He is the 
crowning revelation; for in Him, in 
His person and character, was revealed 
the Divine.. The Father was revealed 
through Him. He is spoken of as be- 
ing the express image of the Father; 
and henceforth the world has a means 
by which they may know, not only the 
being, the existence of God, but the 
kind of being He is, namely, that He 
is the express image of the Lord Jesus 
Christ; for as the Son is the express 
image of the Father, so also the Fath- 
er must be the express image of the 
Son. Concerning this, the discourse 
to which I am alluding says: 

"All Christians believe in the incar- 
nation. Very few believe that this rev- 
elation will ever be repeated in its ob- 
jective form till time, as we measure 
it, shall end." 

Well, no; the incarnation of the Son 
of God will not be repeated. He has 
obtained His body, arid it has beei 



ELDER BRIGHAM H. ROBERTS. 



glorified through the resurrection from 
the dead, and has become as immortal 
as the spirit that inhabits it. There 
will be no reincarnation of the Son 
of God, it is true; but this will be 
true of the Son of God, if we may 
trust the scriptures to guide us: He 
will make a glorious reappearance in 
the world. You remember that occa- 
sion, do you not, when the disciples 
were gathered together on the Mount 
of Olives after the resurrection, and 
Jesus met with them. Presently, after 
giving His last benediction, He was 
taken up into heaven. Spell-bound by 
the beautiful sight of His receding form 
from earth, to heaven, the disciples 
stood gazing up at Him, and as they 
did so two angels made their appear- 
ance and said to them: "Ye men of 
Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into 
heaven? this same Jesus, which is 
taken up from you into heaven, shall 
so come in like manner as ye have 
seen him go into heaven." That kind 
of a revelation of Jesus Christ — His 
reappearance among men in His resur- 
rected, immortal body of flesh and 
bones — that kind of a revelation of 
Jesus Christ is in the future for the 
world, though there may be no reincar- 
nation of Him. 

The difference between the Christian 
world and the Latter-day Saints re- 
specting special revelations from God 
is this: The Christian world believe 
that such revelations took place in the 
past, but that they have not taken 
place since the close of the apostolic 
age; that miracles have ceased: that 
special inspiration has ceased; that 
God conversing with man face to face 
has ceased; and they have no hope of 
these glorious kinds of revelation bf>- 
ing- repeated in the experience of the 
world. The Latter-day Saints on the 
other hand state boldly to the world, 
and as I remember it, one of our arti- 
cles of faith declares that 

"We believe all that God has re- 
vealed, all that he does now reveal, 
and that he will yet reveal many gre it 
and important things pertaining to the 
kingdom of God." 

I want to extend that a little and 



say that we not only believe in the rev- 
elations that have been given, that are 
now being given, and that will be given 
in the future, but we believe alsff in 
all these modes of revelation — revela- 
tion by inspiration, by the manifesta- 
tion of miraculous powers, by face to 
face conversations with God, and com- 
munion with Jesus Christ as a man 
might commune with his friend. And 
we believe that all these modes of rev- 
elation will continue. But we do not 
believe that the will of man will con- 
trol in these matters. Prom 
some things that have been said recent- 
ly relative to revelation one would 
reach the conclusion that because we 
have in our midst prophets and apos- 
tles, inspired men, God and angels and 
the Holy Spirit are subject to their beck 
and call; and because a man is upheld 
as a prophet of God some people seem 
to suppose that he may enter the pres- 
ence of God when he will and talk with 
Him face to face; or, that 'by his sum- 
mons, a prophet may bring angels to 
his side at his own sweet will! Not 
so. These divine things are under the 
control of the Lord Almightty, and 
He will reveal Himself when and in 
whatsoever mode seemeth Him good. 
Do you not remember the scriptures 
which clearly indicate the correctness 
of the view I state upon this subject? 
where it is declared that unto one is 
given by the Spirit the Word of Wis- 
dom, to another the word of knowledge, 
to another the gift of faith, to another 
the gift of healing, to another the 
working of miracles, to another proph- 
ecy, etc., the Lord dividing to every 
man severally as He [the Lord] will— not 
as man might will or choose. So that 
the times and modes of revelation are 
in the hands of God; our faith is sim- 
ply this: that the Lord reigns supreme 
in heaven, aye, and on the earth, and 
whenever His work requires that His 
hand should touch it and guide it He 
will inspire His servants to take the 
course that is necessary to conform 
His works to His will. If it be neces- 
sary to send from the presence of His 
throne an angel, clothed with power, 
might and majesty, to stand in the 



44 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



presence of prophets and apostles, to 
make known a divine purpose, the 
sovereign will of God is sufficient to or- 
der that to be done; and if it becomes 
necessary to summon a prophet into 
the presence of God to commune face 
to face with Him, then He will sum- 
mon that prophet into His presence; or 
open the vision of His mind, snatch 
away the veil of the covering that at 
present separates us from God, and will 
commune with His servant as He did 
with Moses face to face — all according 
as God wills. That is our faith con- 
cerning revelation; and as the great 
Luther said of his faith at the Diet at 
Worms — "Here we stand; we can do 
no other; God help us." If God says, 
move forward, we will move forward. 
If He says, halt, we will halt. If He 
says, turn to the right or turn to the 
left, we will turn accordingly. And 
our faith is if we shall walk under the 
guidance of God no harm can come to 
us individually, nor harm come to the 
work of God. Only such things will 
happen as will tend to the progress 
of God's work, and the glorification of 
His name in the earth. 

I do not know whether I am stating 
exactly your faith in these things or 
not, but this is my faith; and for the 
life of me I cannot understand how 
anyone, Jew or Gentile, Heathen or 
Christian, who believes in God at all 
can stop short of this perfect submis- 
sion unto His will; which submission 
of the mind to God is alone true wor- 
ship. Once admitting the great premise 
that God lives, that He is interested 
in human affairs, that He not only 
created but governs and controls this 
universe, it seems to me that after that 
the only logical conclusion for one who 
holds that faith' is that if he receives 
a message from God, he will perform 
the mission that is given to him in that 
message. 

Just a word or two in conclusion. We 
have spoken in this conference a great 
deal about the world hating us. I 
think sometimes we use the term with- 
out sufficient and proper modification. 
When Jesus said to His disciples: 

"Marvel not if the world hate you. It 



hated me before it hated you. If ye 
were of the world, the world would love 
his own, but because ye are not of the 
world, but I have chosen you out of 
the world, therefore the world hateth 
you." 

When the Master used that language 
I scarcely think He had reference 
to all the world, but only to 
those who were "wordly," to those 
whose hearts were set upon the 
things of this world, to those who were 
lovers of pleasure more than lovers of 
God, to those who were corrupt in their 
hearts; out of which conditions the 
Lord had called His disciples, and now 
in these days has called His people. 
When we say "the world hate us," 
let us ngt think that that means all 
mankind, but that it means the worldly 
portion of mankind, those who love 
darkness rather than light. Those 
whose deeds are evil. When we go to 
them with our message, it reproves 
this part of the world for sin and un- 
righteousness; therefore they hate it. 
They hate the light, because they love 
darkness. But we shall find, I am sure, 
hundreds of thousands, nay millions of 
our Father's children who do not and 
who will not hate us; but who will be 
responsive to the message that we have 
to declare to them. So that I am of 
opinion that we should keep this mod- 
ification in our minds that it is the 
worldly that will hate us, while those 
who are honest in heart will be re- 
sponsive to the testimonies that we 
have to bear. I remember with what 
supreme confidence President Brigham 
Young relied upon the operation of the 
Spirit of God upon the minds of peo- 
ple. He said on more than one occa- 
sion that no man had yet so much as 
heard of the Book of Mormon but what 
the Spirit of the Lord whispered quiet- 
ly to his soul that that book was true: 
no man had so much as heard of the 
Prophet Joseph Smith but what the 
"still small voice" whispered to him 
that he was a true prophet. 

The exact words of President Young 
on this subject are as follows: 

"Nothing short of the Holy Ghost 
will do us any lasting good. I told 
you, in the beginning of my remarks, 
the truth as it is in heaven and on 
the earth, as it is with the angels, and

with prophets, with all good people, 
and with every sinner that dwells up- 
on the earth. There is not a man or 
woman who on hearing the report of 
the Book of Mormon but the spirit of 
the Almighty has testified to them of 
its truth; neither have they heard the 
name of Joseph Smith but the Spirit 
has whispered to them 'He is the true 
Prophet.' 

It is the spirit which is invisible to 
the natural mind of man, that pro- 
duces effects apparently without causes, 
and creates mysteries, marvels, and 
wonders in the earth. These things we 
behold, but we cannot with the natural 
mind account for them, nor divine their 
ultimate end." 

(Discourse by Prest. Brigham Young, 
June 13, 1852. Deseret News, Vol. 4, 
No. 6.) 

I believe that doctrine, and it ought 
to be a mighty source of encouragement 
to the Elders who are preaching the 
gospel among the nations of the earth. 
They toil and labor, they distribute 
tracts, they try to make their voice 
heard in the midst of the world's clam- 
or, and they may think from surface 
indications that their labors are vain, 
that their voice is lost as though they 
were crying in a wilderness. Not so; 
but as they speak in halls or crowded 
thoroughfares God's Spirit bears wit- 
ness to the hearts of those at all sus- 
ceptible to its influence in testimony 
of the truths uttered; and it will be 
because the world rejects that testi- 
mony which comes to their souls that 
there will be condemnation for them, 



and not because they have rejected the 
words spoken by the Elders. 

Both we ourselves and the world 
stand in the presence of this enfolding 
influence and power of God's Holy 
Spirit — the spirit of revelation. Our 
lives through the gospel may be made 
to touch the life of God, and by touch- 
ing the life ot God partake some- 
what of His qualities; have brought 
into our lives some of His divine pow- 
ers, by which at least we may know 
the truth and rejoice in it. And though 
"the world" — regarding "the world" 
in the light of my suggestion — may hate 
us, let us see to it that we do not 
hate the world. We may dislike their 
acts; we may not be able to look upon 
their actions with the least degree of 
allowance; we must say that their 
actions are wicked and that they 
and their actions are ungodly; but 
after all, they are the children of 
God, though they have wandered 
far from Him, and it is our mission 
to send forth the voice that shall call 
them back, to stretch out a hand that 
shall lead them into the fold. Such is 
the spirit of the gospel as we have 
received it, and such our faith in the 
revelations of God. The Lord bless 
you. Amen.

Attendance Exceeding All Previous Con- 
ferences, an Evidence of Increasing 
Faith.— Blesses All Who Desire to Do 
Good and Establish Peace.— Strong 
Declaration of Loyalty to the Nation 
and to the Government. 

I would like to say to this vast con- 
gregation that I am delighted to see 
you here and to note the interest which 
is manifested by the/ Latter-day Saints 
in this conference. I sincerely hope 
that the same calm, peaceful spirit 
which has pervaded the meeting hith- 
erto will continue to be with us until 
the close of this seventy-fifth anniver- 
sary of the organization of the Church. 
Let every man and woman holding a 
membership in the Church exercise 
that faith which it is their right to 
exercise, and let them remember that 
the Lord hears and answers the 
prayers of those who petition Him in 
faith, nothing doubting, for the peace- 
able influence of His Holy Spirit, for 
the light thereof to shine upon their 
understanding, and for the strength- 
ening of their good resolutions to 
serve God and keep His command- 
ments. Thus far I do not think this 
conference has been surpassed for the 
number of those in attendance, and for 
the warmth of fellowship that has been 
manifested on the part of all that have 
assembled here. I pray God, my Hea- 
venly Father, that this spirit of union, 
fellowship and love may continue to 
the end of the conference, and that this 
spirit may spread to the uttermost 
bounds of the Church, that the people 
may be renewed, strengthened, built 



up, and established in the truth of the 
Gospel of the Son of God. 

I feel from, the depths of my heart 
to bless the Latter-day Saints, and I 
cry for blessings upon the heads of all 
people who have in their hearts a 
desire to do good and to establish peace 
and goodwill among the children of 
men. I pray not only- for the prosperity 
of Zion, but for the prosperity of our 
nation. We must always bear in mind 
that we are not only citizens of the 
Kingdom of God, but we are citizens 
of the United States, and of the states 
in which we dwell. We have ever been 
loyal both to our State and Nation, 
as well as to the Church of God, and 
we are at the defiance of the world to 
prove to the contrary. We have been 
willing to fight our country's battles, td 
defend her honor, to uphold and sus- 
tain her good name, and we propose to 
continue in this loyalty to our nation 
and to our people unto the end. 

Now, I did not design to speak this 
morning. May God bless you, May 
peace dwell in your soul. May the love 
of God pervade your hearts and minds. 
May light and truth shine upon your 
understandings. May wisdom be given 
unto you. Be( prudent in all your acts. 
May you be devoted to the cause of 
iZion and to the upbuilding of the 
Church and people of God throughout 
the length and breadth of the land. 
Let every officer of the Church be 
loyal to his calling, loyal to his 
people, and loyal to everything that is 
good, pure, noble and godlike. Let no 
man shrink from his duty for fear of 
consequences, nor from the responsibili- 
ty that rests upon him by reason of the 
calling which he has received through 
the holy Priesthood. Let us remember 
that the Gospel has come to stay, and 
to be preached to every nation, kin- 
dred, tongue and people. We have 
ourselves and mankind to save from 
the errors and sins of the world, and 
from those evils to which men are

prone, that they may come to the 
marvelous light of the Gospel of Christ 
and be made free from the law of sin 
and death, in the glorious liberty of the 
children of God. May He bless you, 
and may peace abide in your hearts, is 
my prayer, in the name of Jesus, 
Amen

Evils of internal dissension.— The insti- 
gator of crime as dangerous as the 
criminal. — President Roosevelt's courage, 
and honest policy.— God will vindicate 
His people. 

My brothers and sisters, the meetings 
of this Conference, so far should have 
brought to the hearts of all present un- 
limited joy and satisfaction, in seeing 
the unity with which the Latter-day 
Saints have come together and trans- 
acted the business pertaining to the 
Conference. In the opening remarks of 
President Smith, he made use of that 
simile of the Apostle Paul, wherein 
the Church of Christ is likened to the 
perfect body of a man — a man in whom 
the mental faculties and the physical 
powers are in harmony; one without 
blemish. You know that when a man 
is at war with himself, when the flesh 
wars against the spirit, when the 
yearnings and the great desires of the 
heart are denied by an inexorable will, 
there is internal strife, and that indi- 
vidual, if he be conscientous, suffers 
the fiery pains of a living hell. And 
as with a man, so with a family. If 
in a family there is strife, quarreling, 
false accusation, partiality, we know 
what the inevitable result will be, un- 
less it is checked. As in a man where 
this internal strife exists, if it be not 
checked, distress must follow, so if these 
conditions are not checked in a family, 
it means the disintegration of that fam- 
ily, and the scattering of its members. 
So in a community, or in an organiza- 
tion, or in a church; if the members 
thereof are at war one with another, if- 
they are not in harmony, if they are 
divided, if they are contentious, then, 
unless these conditions are changed it 
is but a short time until the organiza- 
tion, or the community, or the church, 
or the state, or the nation, is dismem- 



bered and destroyed. It was this con- 
dition which disrupted the French peo- 
ple to such an extent. It was their 
civil 3trife and fratricidal revolution, 
wherein they fought and slew one an- 
other, wherein the blood of noble and 
peasant flowed until the people grew 
weary with the bloodshed. The same 
thing also distracted our own great 
and glorious country during the civ- 
il war, wherein citizens of 
the same country, who had pre- 
viously fought shoulder to shoulder 
against a foreign power, were them- 
selves found in deadly strife. There 
is no telling what might have happen- 
ed—worse than did happen— had it not 
been that the eye and the hand of God 
were over this goodly land, wherein 
He raised up a man, whom I verily be- 
lieve was impired to guide the ship of 
state, that it might not be broken to 
pieces on the shoals and rocks of slav- 
ery and secession. I believe Abraham 
Lincoln was raised up to do God's will. 

I have rejoiced in hearing the patri- 
otic sentiments of the brethren who 
have spoken, showing forth their love 
and loyalty to the country of which 
we form a part. I, too, love my coun- 
try. I know that the Latter-day Saints 
love this nation. However, I see dan- 
gers today in this land of freedom and 
liberty, just as there have been dan- 
gers in our midst in times past. There 
are those who abuse the great privil- 
eges of freedom and liberty, and who 
prostitute the powers and talents 
God has given them, and use 
them to the hurt of their country and 
its people, rather than to the good and 
blessing of the land and its inhabitants. 
Abraham Lincoln, the man who held 
together our country, through whose 
wisdom the men of the north and the 
south were again united in the bonds of 
brotherhood, was put to death by an 
assassin. Of course, he who committed 
the rash deed was put to death also; 
but I ask you, were the ends of justice 
met when the murderer was himself 
put to death? Was the life of the one 
equal to the life of the other? Not at 
all. The ends of justice were no more 
met when the slayer of Abraham Lin-.

coin. was put to death than recompense 
would he made if the combined debt of 
. the world were to be paid with a coun- 
terfeit penny. Another of the noble sons 
of America who stood at the head of the 
nation, James A. Garfield, was likewise 
slain by the hand of an assassin, and 
this assassin also was put to death. 
But was the country and the people 
compensated for the loss of President 
Garfield by the death of his slayer? No. 
And in later times, so recently in fact 
that it still brings sorrow to our minds 
when we think of it, another presi- 
dent of the United States has been 
slain by the hand of an assassin, who 
was promptly taken and executed for 
the crime. But I ask you again, "Was 
recompense made in the death of this 
man? Put the life of this foreigner 
anarchist, this man with the unpro- 
nounceable name, in the scales with 
the life of William McKinley, whom 
he slew, and would the scales of jus- 
tice be balanced? Not at all. 

These men were the assassins, but, in 
my estimation, they were not the real 
murderers. The real murderers are 
still at large, and still have influence 
among the children of men. Who are 
they? They are men who live in this 
country of freedom, who have vouch- 
safed to them every privilege of liber- 
ty, and who pervert these privileges. 
Some of them edit newspapers, some 
occupy pulpits, and some speak from 
public platforms; they are the artists 
who picture noble men before the com- 
munity as fiends incarnate; they are 
writers who describe them as being 
monsters, as being wicked, cruel, am- 
bitious, as men reaching out to rob the 
poor, to oppress mankind, and to have 
flow into their own hands the proceeds 
of the work of the laborers. Christ 
said upon one occasion that he who 
looketh upon a woman to lust after her 
has committed adultery already in his 
heart. I say that the man who looks 
upon another with murder in his heart, 
and who, by speaking and writing, in- 
cites the feeble-minded and vicious to 
strike the blow which takes from the 
country her noble men whom they hate, 
is in fact the murderer. Such men 



commit murder in their hearts, and 
they are no less murderers than they 
would be if they committed the .deed it- 
self. So with the man who covets that 
which does not belong to him; in the 
court of Almighty God, he will be 
deemed a thief, just as though he put 
forth his hand and took that which be- 
longed to his neighbor. And when the 
Lord, in His courts on high, dispenses 
strict justice, these ignorant, foolish or 
vicious individuals who have been in- 
duced to take the lives of good men, 
through the lies that have been circul- 
ated about their victims, will be found 
no more guilty than will those who 
commit the murder in their hearts, and 
whose writings, speaking or pictures 
have incited the criminals to strike the 
deadly blow. This is what I believe. To- 
day, in our land of boasted freedom 
and liberty, whenever the President of 
the United States attends a public func- 
tion, or goes abroad, he must needs be 
surrounded by a corps of secret service 
men, detectives and policemen, who 
watch him and everyone who comes 
in contact with him, and look for sus- 
picious characters. Why? Is it be- 
cause President Roosevelt is a coward, 
that he dare not go abroad without be- 
ing protected thus? No; no man will 
say that the hero of San Juan hill is 
a coward. No man will say that one 
who boldly, and almost alone, stands 
out against the oppression of the people 
by wicked men and by trusts, is a cow- 
ard. No man will say that President 
Roosevelt is a coward when he dare 
stand unswayed against the 'Combined 
cry of tens of thousands of men and 
women incited by prejudice. He is not 
a coward; he is a brave man. But be- 
cause there are those in the land who, 
enjoying the liberties of a free country, 
describe and depict him as being ambi- 
tious, desiring to be an emperor, and 
wear a crown; because there are men 
who use their talents in cartooning him 
thus, representing him to be an op- 
pressor of the people and criminal in 
his desires — these men, through their 
writing and speaking from the platform 
and the pulpit, have made it necessary 
that the President of the United States, 



ELDER HYRUM M. SMITH.

brave though he be, must be surround- 
ed by a corps of secret service men, 
night and day, in order that his life 
may be preserved. I say that those who 
make this necessary are criminals. Why 
do not men use the gifts God has given 
them in portraying before the country 
the virtues of their fellow men, in mag- 
nifying their good deeds, and in imput- 
ing to their honest purpose good instead 
of evil? Why do they not magnify hon- 
orable men in the eyes of their fellows, 
rather than exaggerate imaginary 
faults, and arouse hatred in the hearts 
of the ignorant against men whose lives 
are spent in behalf of the people and 
in defense of righteous laws and 
justice? 

My brethren and sisters, there is but 
little true justice done among men in 
this day and age. The laws that men 
make are necessarily human, and men 
will err; but, in the day of God's judg- 
ment absolute justice will be done. 
Then it will not only be the acts' of 
men that will be taken into account, 
but it will be the thoughts and intents 
of their hearts that will also be con- 
sidered when they are judged. When 
men in the court of Almighty God are 
so judged and found unworthy, and 
they are shut out from the presence 
and love of their Pather,there will be no 
meed then to argue with them as to the 
truth of hell Are; they will know it 
without argument, you can depend up- 
on it. 

Well, we believe that in President 
Rposevelt we have an unprejudiced 
friend; and we know that in the Latter -1 - 
day Saints President Roosevelt will find 
.loyalty to the government and the 
greatest friendship toward him. There 
are no people in the nation more friend- 
ly to him; and they will remain so just 
so long as he remains true to the cause 
of humanity. Furthermore, we will con- 
tinue true to Old Glory, and to our glor. 
ious country, even though all the world 
should prove unjust to us. We are a true 
people. I believe that President Roose- 
velt is a man who has the courage of 
his convictions. He is fairly well ac- 
quainted with us, and he is not a man 
that is moved by public clamor or pre- 



judice. I believe that he will honest- 
ly and truly stand by his great policy 
of a "square deal to all men," and that 
he will accord us our portion of the 
"square deal." I do not believe he is 
the weak and vacillating man that a 
predecessor of his was who, knowing, 
our condition, said, "Your cause is' 
just, but I can do nothing for you." I 
believe he is a man who, so long as he 
believes our cause is just, will be will- 
ing to do something for us. We as- 
suredly will do all we can to sustain 
him, and all other good men. I believe 
these are the sentiments of the ten 
thousand Latter-day Saints who are 
gathered in this building today. I be- 
lieve they are the true sentiments of 
*every member of the Church, and we 
will demonstrate it in the future, as we 
have done in the past. 

May God bless us. May the Church 
of Christ never be less united than it 
is now. Like the nation of which we 
are a part, we have gone through trials 
of internal strife, but we do not have 
them now. In early days, in our weak- 
ness, we saw the witnesses to the Book 
of Mormon, who had stood shoulder to 
shoulder with the Prophet Joseph 
Smith, turn away from him, and op- 
pose him. We have seen his counsel- 
ors leave him; we have seen members 
of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles 
leave the Church and lead away many 
others. That was our internal struggle, 
but we have overcome it. It has been 
proven that God is over us, and He 
will not permit internal strife nor ex- 
ternal persecution to destroy His work 
in the earth, no more than He per- 
mitted civil strife to destroy this great 
country, over which He has had His 
all-seeing eye from the very beginning. 
Let men do what they will; let those 
whom Elder Rich dignified by com- 
paring them to the wolf (to my mind 
you could compare them more con- 
sistently to the penny fice, which makes 
only a noise) howl all they will, we will 
go right straight along, doing the will 
of Almighty God, and He will justify 
and vindicate us in the eyes of men, in 
His own due time. God bless you, my 
brethren and sisters, and make you

GENERAL, CONFERENCE. 



ever as faithful and even more faith- 
ful than you are today, is my prayer in 
the name of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER L. W. SHURTLIFF. 

(President of Weber Stake.) 

My beloved brothers and sisters, the 
few moments I shall occupy this morn- 
ing-, I trust that I shall have the Spirit 
of the Lord to direct me, as it has 
directed all of the speakers during the 
Conference. I have attended a great 
many conferences of the Church, and I 
feel that this is the best one I have 
ever had the privilege of attending. I 
rejoice exceedingly in the truths of the 
Gospel, and in my association with the 
people of God in the last days. It has 
been my good fortune to be associated 
with the Latter-day Saints all the days 
of my life. I have been personally ac- 
quainted with all of the Presidents of 
the Church from President Young 
down, and have served upon missions 
under all of them, and I thank God 
this morning that I can bear testimony 
that they have all been men of God, 
filled with light and intelligence and 
the revelations of heaven to guide His 
people on earth. I am thankful that 
I live in this glorious republic, that I 
was born in this nation, that my fore- 
fathers fought in the Revolutionary 
war. I am thankful for the liberty 
that we have in this great nation; and 
although my life has been spent with 
the Latter-day Saints, sometimes in 
darkness and difficulties, yet there has 
always been brightness to those that 
were filled with the love of truth. I 
am thankful to see this vast assembly 
come here to worship, and to hear the 
word of the Lord. We have alreadv 
heard it, we are hearing it from day 
to day. 

So far as the people are concerned 
over whom I have the honor to ore- 
side, in the Weber Stake of Zion, I will 
say that we have union, fellowship and 
love for one another and for those that 
lead Israel. There may be a few, and 
they are very few, that feel differently, 
but T tell you that the Latter-dav 
Saints do support the authorities of the 
Church. They pray for them and sup- 



port them in every way, and we are 
united in this. We have no fear about 
what shall be done with the tithes and 
offerings that are placed in the hands 
of the Trustee-in-trust. I believe that 
the Latter-day Saints who pay their 
tithes and offerings are not the ones 
that are finding fault, but it is those 
that have done little or nothing in this 
direction. I trust that we will be 
loyal to the servants of God. We know 
that God has inspired them to lead Is- 
rael, and we have full confidence in 
them, it matters not what the 
world may say concerning them 
or the people of God. The Church 
of Christ will go forth in great earnest- 
ness in the earth, and there is no power 
that can stay it. From time to time 
men may rise up and think they can 
do something that will retard the pro- 
gress of the work of God, but thev 
will fail, as they always have. Those 
that have been long in the Church know 
how freauently men have come for- 
ward and said, "We will show you the 
way;" but they have utterly failed. 

God bless Israel, and especially our 
leaders. I know that Joseph F. Smith 
is a nrophet of God, I know that his 
counselors are men of God also, and al- 
so the Twelve Apostles, and the others 
whom we have sustained, and we will 
continue to sustain them whatever the 
world may say regarding them. God 
he 1 .? us to do so. May Zion rise and 
shine. May we still feel able to main- 
tain the right and build up and 
strengthen the weak in all parts of the 
land. God bless you and all Israel. 
Amen. 

ELDER JESSE N. SMITH. 

(President of Snowflake Stake.) 
Brothers and sisters, I feel that I am 
one of the least among you; but not- 
withstanding my humility and my 
nothingness, I have received a witness 
of the truth of this work. I can relate 
how it happened that my lot was cast 
among the Latter-day Saints. I do not 
suppose there was any natural goodness 
about me to boast of, but I had very 
choice parents, and they had a great 
interest for me, as I have discovered, 



ELDER JESSE N. SMITH. 



51 



and I revere them. If any of the fath- 
ers have wayward sons, probably if 
they will take the course that my fa- 
ther took, they may be enabled to in- 
terest those sons in this work. My 
religious impressions commenced from 
my earliest childhood. My father seem- 
ed to make his religion first and fore- 
most. He attended very strictly to his 
family devotions. He did not seem to 
be hurried. At evening he read from 
the Scriptures, he and my mother sang, 
and we had family prayers. My re- 
ligious life, I may say, my testimony, 
dates from these things. My father 
soon passed away in death, but - 1 can 
never forget him. I felt that he was 
a minister of God. I lived in very great 
poverty, in much humility, privation I 
may say. I was taught early to pray, 
and I understood the meaning of those 
words in the Lord's prayer, "Give us 
this day our daily bread," because we 
did not have much laid by. When I 
was enabled to go to school, there 
were no free schools then; contracts 
were made by the parents; and I had 
a very meagre supply of books, almost 
none at all. I heard . that they were 
using the Book of Mormon in the 
schools, so I took my father's Book of 
Mormon with me. It was the first edi- 
tion. Our honored Patriarch was in 
that class with his Book of Mormon; 
young Joseph Smith, the son of Sidney 
Rigdon, the son of William Marks, and 
the son of Peter Haws were also in the 
class. I was in good company, but 
they all had books of the second edi- 
tion, with new and beautiful binding, 
and I felt I was a little behind them. 
As I was going to school one morning, 
and passing the Prophet's place, he was 
walking in the garden, and he answer- 
ed my salutation. I think he would 
answer a child's salutation just as 
readily as that of a grown person. He 
came up to the fence and spoke very 
kindly to me. He said, "You are going 
to school?" "Yes." "What book do 
you. read in?" "I read in the Book of 
Mormon." "Come in here." I passed 
in at the gate and he made me a pres- 
ent of a Book of Mormon of the ne"W 
edition, with the beautiful binding. I 
could then hold up my head with the 



others of the class. He gave me this 
injunction: "Read it in school and read 
it at home." I have done so. I believe 
the Book of Mormon. I have believed 
it from my childhood. I have been a 
great reader, but it is to me the most 
interesting of all books. I felt that 
that was the greatest treasure that 
could be bestowed upon me. And when 
I read that David Whitmer, one of the 
witnesses to the Book of Mormon, and 
his family, had a superstitious regard 
for the sacred record that was in his 
keeping, and they felt that no harm 
would come to them while they were 
the custodians of that record, I could 
comprehend that. My family have al- 
most the same feeling for the sacred 
volume that was presented to me by 
the hand of the Prophet Joseph Smith. 
In traveling around among the people 
as a missionary, which I do consider- 
ably, I find many young people just 
starting out in life. I call on them in 
their humble homes. When I find the 
Book of Mormon on their shelves and 
see an indication that it is read and 
considered, I feel thankful, for I have 
a sort of testimony that in that home 
there will be no family jars and no 
seeking for divorce. I have looked af- 
ter these things In a humble way. I 
find that there is power in this Gospel, 
and that the faithful and the true be- 
lievers are favored of God. Peace, 
blessed pence, comes to their homes. 
Their homes are homes of faith and 
prayer, and the Christian virtues clus- 
ter around their family altars. 

I thank the Lord for what I have re- 
ceived in the Gospel; chief of all, that I 
have received a degree of faith, blessed 
faith. I have been free from doubt. At 
the death of the Prophet and Patriarch, 
the people for a moment seemed help- 
less, and there sprang up many aspi- 
rants, who sought leadership and dig- 
nity and honor in the Church; yet I 
was blessed, I had no doubt, and I re- 
alized that the Twelve were the men to 
look to. It was given me of the Lord. 
Fortunately I was present at that won- 
derful meeting where President Brig- 
ham Young spoke with the voice of 
Joseph Smith, and I heard that familiar 
voice. That strengthened the testi- 



52 



GENERAL, CONFERENCE. 



mony of many. It was most wonderful. 
That voice which, as was said of the 
blessed Redeemer, spake as never man 
spake! I sincerely hope to remain 
faithful to this cause. It has not been 
difficult for me so far. I hope I may 
have grace ana the favor and blessing 
of the Almighty to continue. 

The people where I live are not nu- 
merous, but I believe that, almost uni- 
versally, they are content and satis- 
fied. They sustain the authorities of 
the Church in word and in deed, and 
they are greatly blessed. I think it 
very unfortunate to be discontented, to 
be an agitator, to delight in turmoil, 
to seek to stir up strife. I think there 
is far more happiness, there is far more 
opportunity to be of help to our fellow- 
men, to be conservative in our feelings 
and in our spirit, and help along, in- 
stead of trying to hold back. I regard 
it as the highest blessing to know the 
will of God and have a disposition to do 
it. 

I pray that we may all be preserved 
in righteousness, that we may build up 
the kingdom of God, and bequeath the 
legacy of righteousness and good works 
to those who shall come after us. Amen. 

President Joseph F. Smith arose and 
said, "Elder Jesse N. Smith, who has 
just addressed us, may properly be re- 
garded as a modern Nathaniel— a man 
in whom there is no guile." 

Elder John Robinson sang a baritone 
solo, "O Lord Have Mercy." 

ELDER E. H. SNOW. 
(President of St. George Stake). 

My dear brethren and sisters, I ap- 
preciate very much the opportunity 
given me to report the condition of the 
people in the St. George Stake of Zion. 
Ours is a stake of magnificent distances, 
requiring about eleven hundred miles 
to travel, all by team, to reach the peo- 
ple. There are twenty-two wards, most 
of them small. We have no railroad, 
no corporations, and not much of the 
wealth of the world to worry us. The 
stranger says it is a God-forsaken 
country; but >we do not believe him, for 
we know better. The Lord has justified 
the wisdom of the servants of God in 
colonizing this semi-arid region. The 



early pioneers have nearly all passed 
away; but their sons and daughters 
have regarded the call of their par- 
ents as equally binding upon them, and 
they have remained In the country, and 
have toiled and struggled and wrung 
from the elements a fairly comfortable 
subsistence. There is an affection in 
the hearts of the people for the sanSs 
and the rocks that have developed 
strength in them. After all, our best 
crop has been men and women. We 
have been engaged in building extensive 
canals.. The rives has washed some of 
our land away; and one canal, at an ex- 
pense 'of one hundred thousand dollars 
and ten years in building, has just been 
completed and water turned upon 
the land. Another reservoir scheme has 
been perfected, and we are getting this 
spring, for the first time, the benefits of 
that enterprise. Years ago we had 
plenty of rain, but for the last fifteen 
years there has been drouth. During 
the last winter, however, the rains have 
come up from the Gulf of California 
and settled down over the rim of the 
basin, and we have had rain, and rain, 
and glorious rain. We have not had 
such rain for twenty years. So we ar» 
happy, we are hopeful, we are content- 
ed, we are united. I need scarcely say 
to you that a people who have re- 
mained loyal to the country to which 
the servants of God called them, are 
still loyal to the servants of God. 

Personally, I feel well in the Gospel. 
Like Elder Ben E. Rich, I can say , 
that there never was a time in my life 
when I was so well satisfied with the 
Church of God and the administration 
of His servants as I am today. I re- 
joice in the fact that I have a testi- 
mony for myself that this is the work of 
God. I hope I shall always prove trua 
and faithful to it; for I can conceive ot 
no worse spectacle than for the Saints 
to tear down the work of their fathers. 
I have rejoiced in the spirit of this 
conference and in the spirit of the 
brethren who have spoken. I testify 
that this spirit is of God. I pray God 
to bless us as a people, especially the 
young, that we may be true and faith- 
ful, and that the spirit of this confer- 
ence may go as a great ground swell 
and penetrate throughout the length 



ELDER J. GOLDEN KIMBALL.

and breadth of the land, and stir up the 
souls of the people of Zion unto faith- 
fulness, to seek God and keep His com- 
mandments. Amen. 

ELDER J. GOLDEN KIMBALL. 

I very much desire to say the right 
thing- at the right time. I may pos- 
sibly speak by parable. Now, I intend 
to say just what the Lord will help 
me say. One parable is that I do not 
want a rosewood casket. I am willing 
to be buried among the people in a 
plain casket, and all I want inscribed 
■on the headboard of my grave is that 
I have been true to this Church and to 
the Priesthood of God, and have walk- 
ed in the footsteps of my father. 

I once read a beautiful article about 
anvils and hammers and I copied some 
of its sayings; but I have never used 
them, although I have carried the copy 
until it is nearly worn out. I now 
■quote as follows: "Every man in the 
world who gives blows must take 
blows, and until a man becomes as 
good an anvil as he is a hammer he 
fails to be thoroughly fitted for his 
work." 

I was born in this. Church, and if 
there is any one thing that I am proud 
of it is that I am a member of this 
Church. You Latter-day Saints know 
well how proud I am of my parentage. 
When I stop believing in my father 
and mother, I will stop believing in the 
human family; for where they go I 
want to go. I love this work. I may 
not love it quite so well as some men 
•do, but I hope I will always be given 
the credit of having integrity, and sup- 
port and sustain the Priesthood of 
God. 

I will tell you how I was brought up, 
and then you can make borne excuse 
for my general makeup. A lot of us 
boys used to meet up in the Eighteenth 
ward, right where now stands the La- 
fayette school— that beautiful building 
which cost over $170,000. I was educated 
in a very small building on the 
same block. We had a brother that 
was somewhat of a general, and he 
trained us boys— that is, when father 
^ivas away. He would get us behind 



the barn, where no one could see us; 
then he would put a chip upon one of 
our shoulders and tell one of the other 
boys to knock it off, then we would 
fight. That was part of the training 
he gave us, and when we asked why he 
did it, he said it makes you tough. My 
father had a great garden and it was 
fenced in by a six or eight foot stone 
wall. Father told us we couldn't have 
any of the fruit, so we got it anyhow, 
and I will tell you how we got it. This 
sfime brother of ours, took one of the 
boys and dangled him over the wall 
with a rope, and he loaded his shirt 
bosom and pockets with apples. One 
time, Father Tucker, the gardener, got 
after him with a willow, and lambasted 
him. Brother said that would make 
him tough. Now, I have a little boy— 
my oldest son — and when he was a 
child we always made him give up to 
every neighbor's boy that came in our 
home. These are parables that I am 
telling you now. We kept that up until 
he thought he had to give up everything 
in the world, and it made rather a 
coward out of him. He went to school, 
and the boys found out they could 
v/hip him; and they did so, until I told 
him that if he didn't take his own part 
and fight, I would whip him. Not 
long ago he came home with his 
thumb out of joint, and, forgetting all 
about my religion, I said, Did you whip 
him? He said, yes. Then I gave him 
some fatherly counsel. 

Now I grant, my brethren and sisters, 
that sometimes we have to endure, and 
I presume that if we live the Gospel of 
the Lord Jesus Christ we have to en- 
dure all things; but it requires a very 
prayerful heart to enable us to endure 
some things. I realize that the Con- 
gress of the United States, the presi- 
dent of the United States, and the com- 
mittee on privileges and elections, have 
their duty to perform. I do not object 
to those things, for it is a doctrine of 
the Church that we sustain the law of 
the land, and we have done it, although 
we have fought valiantly for the prin- 
ciples that were revealed to the Proph- 
et Joseph Smith; and I am proud that 
the people fought it out until it was 



54 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



decided that some parts of our religion 
were unconstitutional and would not 
be permitted. But the thing that I ob- 
ject to is, for every little gutter-snipe 
that comes into the country to think 
that he can kick and maul and abuse 
us. I occasionally feel a little like Joe 
Rich did once when they abused his 
father, Apostle Charles C. Rich, who 
spend a great part of his life as a 
pioneer in that hard country of Bear 
Lake, who used to come over the moun- 
tains on snow shoes in order to attend 
conference, 'who used to grind his wheat 
in a little coffee mill in order to have 
bread, and whose wives and children 
lived in log houses with dirt roofs, for 
many years. Joe went down to a cer"v 
tain newspaper office and demanded re- 
traction. He told them if they didn't 
retract he would turn the whole family 
loose on them, and that he was the 
smallest one in the family and the big- 
gest coward. The retraction came. I 
am not saying this to be sensational; I 
tell you, if it were not for that man of 
God, Joseph F. Smith, restraining his 
children, and they being obedient unto 
him. there would be some men horse- 
wipped today. But, he is a servant of 
God. I have known him all my life. I 
have known every man who has pre- 
sided over this Church from President 
Brigham Young down, and I know they 
have been men of God. 

Now, I realize that every man who 
strikes blows for power, for influence, 
for institutions, for the right, must be 
just as good an anvil as he is a ham- 
mer. If he is not, he may properly con- 
clude that he has no very important 
mission in the improvement and prog- 
ress of the race. If private and insti- 
tuted sin, error, prejudice and wrong 
would stand quietly and let us batte? 
in their sides, or knock them down, re- 
form would be easy; but they always 
object to this mode of treatment, and 
any man who attacks them must calcu- 
late on his powers of resistance, or his 
power to bear without flinching the 
blows he will receive in return. 

We have no small mission to perform. 
I honor Joseph Smith the Prophet for 
his bravery, for his courage, for his 



manliness. He had a message to de- 
liver that was in conflict with sin and 
wickedness, and it came in contact also 
with all the man-made religious organ- 
izations of the world. But God had re- 
vealed it to him, and he would not deny 
it, though it cost his life. Do you thin* 
we can continue proclaiming this mes- 
sage—can we Elders continue telling 
the world that God did appear to Joseph 
Smith, and that He did reveal these 
things, and expect they will receive us 
with open arms? Never. But not- 
withstanding it is our mission to treat 
them kindly, to carry the olive branch 
in our hands, to preach the Gospel ana 
to deliver this message. At the same 
time, brethren and sisters, we must 
have backbone. The people assembled 
here are those who generally attend to 
their duties, who go to quarterly con- 
ferences, and pay their tithing; but 1 
tell you there are some people in this 
Church who do not pay their tithing, 
do not attend conference, do not listen 
to the words of the Prophets, and do 
not work for the salvation of the souls 
of the children of men, and they are the 
ones that are shaking in their shoes at 
this very time. I hope the ship will stop 
just long enough for them to get off. 
The door is wide open; and, as someone 
has said, "when you want to go to hell, 
black your boots and go like a gentle- 
man." If I leave this Church I hope I 
will have manhood enough to leave it 
like a man, and not be a traitor and 
fight the people. I said to one man 
once, "You have a right to leave this 
Church, and it is a very simple thine 
to do. Just notify those in authority 
that you desire to withdraw." It is 
our business to treat all such kindly, 
to sympathize with them, and if pos- 
sible to uplift them; but I do not like 
a traitor, and never did. 

I am going to read some more to you: 
"I think there is a contemptible, quiet 
path for all those who are afraid of 
the blows and hammers of opposing 
forces. There is an honorable fighting 
for any man who is not ready to for- 
get that he has a head to be battered 
and a name to be besmattered. Truth 



ELDER J. W. 

wants no champion who is not as ready 
to be struck as to strike for her." 

Any of these backboneless people, any 
who are afraid that God's work will 
not triumph, had better get in the 
background, and let those that have 
courage stand in the front of the bat- 
tle. Of course, I might be the first 
one to run; I have not been tried yet; 
but I know I will be tried if I stay in 
this Church. I know that I cannot live 
on borrowed light. You can talk and 
preach and expound until you are black 
in the face, but if you do not know 
that Jesus is the Christ you will never 
stay in this Church. 

I want to read one more Quotation 
and then I will quit: 

"The more one reads of the newspa- 
pers the less clearly one sees. There 
are days when having read them and 
admitting that one believes their word, 
the reader will see himself obliged to 
draw this conclusion: Decidedly, there 
are none but tarnished men everywhere. 
There are no men of integrity, but some 
of these chroniclers. But that last 
conclusion will fall in its turn! The 
reader would have before his eyes a 
spectacle analagous to that represented 
in the caricature called the 'Combat of 
the Serpent.' After having devoured 
everything around them, two reptiles 
attack each other and begin to swal- 
low each other, so that there remains 
in the battle field but two tails." 

I guess we know where to apply this. 
There is one morning paper in this city 
that has treated us reasonably fair, 
and they know how well they are suc- 
ceeding in their fair treatment. As far 
as I am concerned, I want to be broad- 
minded enough to open my arms to tht 
stranger, and to treat him kindly; but, 
I will not sustain a man who will lie, 
abuse, and deride this people. It is 
our business to sustain this work, and 
it is our business to uphold this State 
and nation. 

May God bless this people. May He 
bless the authorities of the Church. It 
is not often I bear my testimony, but 
I want to tell you today that I know 
this work is true. I know that Joseph 
Smith is a Prophet of God. I honor 
and love his memory, although I never 
saw him. I have been acquainted with 
all the Prophets of God from the days 
of President Bi-igham Young down. 



McMURRIN. 55 

They have been kind to me in my childr 
hood and in my manhood. It does not 
matter much to me where the place is 
that they have gone to, but I want to 
tell you they are good enough company 
for me, and I do not want to go with 
any others, because I would be lone- 
some. God bless you. Amen. 

OVERFLOW MEETING. 

Sunday forenoon an overflow session 
was held in the Assembly Hall. It 
commenced at 10:40 and was largely 
attended. The presiding officer of the 
occasion was Elder Rudger Clawson. 

Singing "Redeemer of Israel." Prayer 
by Elder Chas. B. Felt. Singing, "How 
firm a foundation." 

ELDER JOSEPH W. McMURRIN. 

Elder Joseph W. McMurrin spoke of 
the necessity for a speaker to enjoy the 
Spirit of the Lord in order to accom- 
plish good. He rejoiced over the in- 
structions thus far given during the 
Conference, and the testimonies borne 
as to the divine principles of the Gos- 
pel and calling of those who are direct- 
ing the Church today. This is a day 
of restoration and of warning — the call 
is to repentance, the testimony to the 
world is that the Redeemer's work has 
again come to earth. 

Referring to the dream interpreted 
by Daniel, showing the setting up of 
God's kingdom in the latter days, of its 
perpetuity and that it should not be 
given to another people — he called at- 
tention to our duties; in view of our 
having received a knowledge of the 
restoration, that we treasure and cul- 
tivate that knowledge and testimony, 
live in accordance with it, and bear 
that testimony to the world by word 
and act. 

There ;seems to be great anxiety 
among those who are not of us, lest 
this people are being led astray. The 
enthusiasm and unanimity of the thou- 
sands in attendance at this Conference 
does not bear out such a theory, but 
it proves that there never has been 
more confidence in the servants of God 
than exists now in the hearts of the 
people.

GENERAL, CONFEK "\CB. 



He bore testimony that twenty-two 
years ago, when laboring in Scotland, 
Bishop McKay told him that he was 
present when President Wilford Wood- 
ruff prophesied that Joseph F. Smith 
would one day stand in the shoes of his 
uncle, the Prophet Joseph Smith. That 
Joseph F. Smith was chosen of God to 
lead this people, and he invited the peo- 
ple present to write it in their books. 
He related also another incident when 
President Woodfuff took Joseph F. 
Smith by the hand and led him before 
a congregation, many years ago, and 
told them that he would become presi- 
dent of the Church. (Brother Henry 
F. McCune, from the congregation, con- 
firmed the statement, as he was present 
at the meeting referred to.) President 
Woodruff spoke on both occasions by 
the spirit of prophecy. Every Latter- 
day Saint is entitled to the spirit of 
inspiration, and such cannot be led 
astray. 

God has given to this people indi- 
vidually the testimony of the Gospel, 
and through that they have been led 
here, and are united in the truth, and 
know they have the truth, and are 
not led astray. This same spirit rests 
upon the people today, and it will al- 
ways be the case. God has manifested 
to this people where His authority is, 
and they will never lose this testimony. 

"As our days may demand so our 
succor shall be." 

God reigneth! 

ELDER E. D. WOOLLEY. 

President E. D. Woolley of Kanab 
stake then addressed the meeting. 

He stated that he had attended all 
the general conferences but two for 
the last 21 years. During that time 
waves of trouble and times of peace 
and joy have passed over this people. 
He recognized that we are now passing 
through one of the peculiar experiences, 
and he felt, before the voting upon 
the general authorities of the Church, 
that the people would be even more 
anxious to vote to sustain them than 
for many years. The speaker bore 
testimony that Joseph F. Smith Is the 
mouth piece of God to this people; and 



said, if the people will observe his 
teachings, and follow his instructions, 
they will be blessed of the Lord and 
make no mistake. 

He reported the condition of the Kan- 
ab stake, referred to calling the Priest- 
hood together, with the heads of de- 
partments, and later in ward confer- 
ences, when, with full and free expres- 
sions from the people, the authorities 
were sustained with unusual enthu- 
siasm and absolute unanimity. 

ELDER JOSEPH E. ROBINSON. 

Elder Joseph E. Robinson, president 
of the California mission, was the next 
speaker. Referring to the restoration 
of the Aaronic Priesthood through John 
the Baptist, and of the Melchisedek 
Priesthood through Peter, James and 
John, called attention to the many im- 
portant revelations given since then, 
quoted from the Book of Doctrine and 
Covenants, showing that His word was 
to all the world, even the voice of warn- 
ing by the mouth of His servants whom 
He would send, and who could not be 
staid. In the 124th section, some of 
these servants are named, and these 
same men are they who came to these 
valleys and assisted in establishing the 
Church here. He exhorted the Saints 
to bear in mind the promises of the 
Lord, keeping fresh the comforting 
words and prophecies as given in the 
Book of Covenants, and rejoice and 
serve Him continually. He closed by 
bearing testimony that God lives and 
hears and answers the prayers of His 
children, and that we are enjoying the 
gifts of the Gospel as did the Saints 
of former days. 

ELDER RULON S. WELLS. 

Elder Rulon S. Wells of the First 
Council of Seventy spoke briefly. 

The Lord has declared that He would 
bring to pass His wonderful work, and 
we know that He is doing so; that He 
has opened the heavens and sent mes- 
sengers to the earth. The world, with- 
out the Spirit of God, cannot grasp nor 
receive these things, but only those who 
through obedience to God's laws have 
received His Spirit, and we know them. 



ELDER SEYMOUR B. YOUNG. 



57 



"Men love darkness rather than light 
because their deeds are evil," applies 
to men both in and out of the Church. 
Sin Is ofttimes attractive, and owing 
to weakness, and lack of the Spirit, 
men are often led into sin. Were we 
filled with the Holy Ghost we would 
hate sin. The speaker exhorted the 
saints to cherish the good, encourage 
the Spirit, and walk in the light. Let 
us walk in the light and secure the 
cleansing from sin that comes through 
the Lord's atonement. 

Obedience to God's laws always has 
brought marvelous manifestations of 
His power. When these wonderful 
things cease, it is because men have 
wandered away from the light, but as 
we increase in righteousness, whether 
as individuals, families on peoples, 
God's marvelous blessings will increase 
upon us. 

Singing, "Now let us rejoice." Bene- 
diction was pronounced by Henry F. 
McCune. 



SECOND OVERFLOW HEETINQ. 

The assembly hall was crowded to 
its utmost capacity long before the 
time of meeting at 2 o'clock, Sundav 
afternoon. Elder Rudger Clawson of 
the quorum of the Apostles presided, 
and with him upon the stand were El- 
ders Seymour B. Young, Angus M. Can- 
non, Ben E. Rich, Joseph E. Robin- 
son, Andrew Jenson and John W. Rig- 
don. 

The Ogden Tabernacle choir, under 
the leadership of Prof. Joseph Ballan- 
tyne, rendered the music of the occa- 
sion. The first selection was the hymn 
beginning with the line, "Prayer is the 
Soul's sincere desire." Elder Walter J. 
Lewis offered the invocation. The choir 
then sang "Author of faith, eternal 
word." 

ELDER SEYMOUR B. YOUNG. 

Elder Seymour B. Young addressed 
the congregation. He said he had been 
deeply impressed with the good spirit 
that had been manifest during this 
conference. He believed that never had 
the Saints had greater cause for re- 



joicing than at the present time. It 
was his opinion that the people were 
more united than ever before. He was 
led to this conclusion from his travels 
among the people from one end of the 
country to the other. Zion is growing 
and will continue to grow, notwith- 
standing the fact that ' many try to 
thwart its advance and bring trouble 
upon the people. 

The Latter-day Saints are loyal to the 
great government of the United States. 
It was founded with the favor and by 
the Spirit of the Almighty. When the 
convention met to frame the Constitu- 
tion confusion reigned, and but little 
progress was made until, at the sug- 
gestion of John Hancock, prayer was 
offered, after which harmony and good- 
will prevailed. 

The speaker related an incident of his 
childhood, wherein his mother held him 
up to see the Prophet Joseph and the 
Patriarch Hyrum passing through Nau- 
voo to surrender themselves at Carth- 
age. In a few days came the dreadful 
news of the martyrdom. Then came 
the .leadership of Brigham Young and 
his successors, all of whom the speaker 
said he knew were called of God. Of 
the present leader, President Joseph P. 
Smith, Elder Young testified that he 
is the right man in the right place. 

ELDER BEN E. RICH. 

A sacred solo by Miss Myrtle Ballan- 
tyne of Ogden was followed by remarks 
by Elder Ben E. Rich, president of the 
Southern States mission. He praised 
the men who at the instance of King 
James, had compiled and translated 
the Bible. They had done their best, 
but being uninspired, had made mis- 
takes, and sometimes filled in improper 
words where the original words could 
not be deciphered. This has at times 
led to confusion and misunderstandings. 

Elder Rich believed that the Latter- 
day Saints are oft-times too submissive 
when assailed by opponents. He told 
of an endeavor that had been made to 
debar him from becoming a member of 
a certain society to which he was in 
every way entitled, solely because he 
was a "Mormon." He said that this 



58 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Church will not fall to pieces; God will 
not permit such a thing to happen. The 
speaker said that he had never known 
President Brigham Young to say but 
one inconsistent thing, and that was 
when he advised those who wanted to 
apostatize to do so, but to be decent 
about it, as though such a thing was 
possible. 

OTHERS MAKE REMARKS. 

Elders Andrew Jenson and Joseph 
B. Robinson spoke, the former upon 
his late missionary experiences, and 
the latter upon the subject of true char- 
ity. 

JOHN W. RIGDON. 

John W. Rigdon, a son of Sidney 
Rigdon, was then introduced. He said 
that he joined the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints six months 
ago, and hoped to remain firm therein 
until the end. After a visit to the west 
in 1864, he had returned to the home of 
his father, who was near the end of his 
mortal life. He said to his sire that as 
the latter had not long to live, he 
owed it to himself, his family and 
to the world to tell what he knew about 
the coming forth of the Book of Mor- 
mon. The dying man raised his hand 
and avowed before heaven that the first 
he knew of., the book was when it was 
brought to him by Oliver Cowdery.Ziba 
Peterson and Parley P. Pratt. His wife 
and daughter (the latter is still living) 
w-ere present, when the book was pre- 
sented, and both testified to the son 
and the brother of the facts as stated 
by Sidney Rigdon. 

Brother Rigdon also said that he 
was present at the Liberty jail with 
his mother, and with Emma Smith and 
her little son Joseph, the latter now 
president of the Reorganized Chruch. 
and who is said to have been ordained 
and set apart by his father on that oc- 
casion. He testified that no such or- 
dination or setting apart took place. 
The speaker bore a powerful testimony 
to the truth of the latter-day work. 

The choir sang an anthem, and the 
benediction was pronounced by Elder 
Angus M. Cannon. 



OUTDOOR MEETING. 

By direction of the First Presidency, 
an open air meeting was held on the 
lawn, just east of the bureau of infor- 
mation building, Sunday afternoon, 
April 9, 1905, Elder Benj. Goddard pre- 
siding. Singing, "Oh, ye mountains 
high." Prayer was offered by Elder 
Joseph H. Felt. Sister Clara Cluff 
sang very feelingly "O my Father," 
accompanied by Prof. W. C. Clive, vio- 
linist. 

President J. A. McRae of the Color- 
ado mission addressed the assem- 
blage. He expressed his pleasure in 
bearing his testimony to the people, 
and trusted that if any present had 
heard him bear testimony in the mis- 
sion field that that testimony would 
bear witness that what he would now 
say is true. He spoke pointedly of cer- 
tain influences brought to bear on our 
young men, and cautioned parents to 
keep their boys under wholesome con- 
trol. Boys have more temptations than 
the girls. The latter should also be 
well guarded from the snares of the 
evil one. The speaker encouraged the 
young people to follow closely in the 
foot-steps of their parents, who had 
carried successfully the burden placed 
upon their shoulders, for they were 
God-fearing men and women. 

The congregation sang, "Our God, we 
raise to Thee," with violin accompani- 
ment by Prof. Clive. 

President Nephi Pratt, of the North 
western States mission, expressed his 
gratitude in meeting with the Saints 
of God in the tons of the mountains, 
where they have gathered in fulfill- 
ment of the prophecy of Isaiah. He 
compared the conditions of the pioneers 
when they first entered this valley with 
conditions at the present, and recount- 
ed' how they had been driven from a 
"Christian" community, who forbade the 
Saints worshiping God as they desired. 

The speaker referred to the unstinted 
joy that filled their hearts, for they 
knew the Gospel was true, and were 
willing to sacrifice anything for it, even 
their lives if necessary. He also bore a 
faithful testimony of the truth of the 
Gospel. 



ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH. 



The congregation sang, "Now let us 
rejoice in the day of salvation," etc., 
and the benediction was pronounced 
by J. L. Home. 

About 1,500 persons were present, and 
the best of attention was given to the 
speakers. 

CLOSING SESSION. 

In the Tabernacle, at 2 p. m. 
The choir sang the anthem, "The 
mountain of the Lord's house." 

Prayer was offered by Elder Edwin 
D. Woolley, president of Kanab stake. 

"When Thou Comest to the Judg- 
ment," was sung by Sister Lizzie 
Thomas Edward and the choir. 

ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH. 

A. Great Over-ruling Providence Comes 
from God — Unimpeachable Evidence 
of its Existence. 
When I look at this large audience I 
am reminded of something I read in a 
paper sometime ago. A certain man 
was driving down a road in the state of 
Kansas, and he saw out in a field at 
some distance, a man working in ma- 
sonry. It was not near a house, and 
he could not understand why the man 
was building a fence in that particular 
place. Finally, he went over to where 
the man was and asked him what he 
was building. The man said, "I am 
building a fence." ."Well," said ihe, 
"that is the most peculiar looking 
fence I ever saw; you are building it 
only three feet high, and you are mak- 
ing it five feet wide, and building it of 
stone. Now, can you tell .me why you 
are doing that?" The man replied, "I 
am doing it for a joke." He then ask- 
ed what the joke was. "Well," he said, 
"I have built quite a number of fences 
in this country, and every time 1 get 
one built in good shape, one of these 
cyclones comes along and turns it over, 
and I am building this fence so that 
the next cyclone that comes along and 
turns it over will be mightily sur- 
prised to find' that it is higher than it 
was before." When I look into the 
eager faces of this large audience, I am 
reminded that the circumstances and 



developments of the past few months 
have turned over the fence of '•'Mor- 
monism" in some quarters, and this 
audience, and the audience without, 
and the one in the adjacent building 
are evidence of the fact that it has 
been a "joke" thus far. In other words, 
the faith we have has not been weak- 
ened or lessened. 

I sometimes wonder if people realize 
the purpose of their existence, and the 
importance of the labor that men and 
women are expected to perform 
while on the earth. Some be- 
lieve that when we pass from this 
sphere of existence, that is the end. It 
seems incredible to me, when we look 
into the works of nature, when we in- 
vestigate the organism of man, the per- 
fection of .his body, the pulsation of his 
heart, the building and strengthening 
from childhood to manhood, then the 
gradual decline until this life is ended— 
that it is possible any of our father's 
children can believe that human beings 
have been born into the world only to 
live to manhood and womanhood, pass 
to old age, and die, without some pur- 
pose in their having lived here. We 
should remember that while it is in 
the power of man to take human life, it 
is not in the province of any human 
being or any, human agency to give life. 
The spirit which inhabits the body is 
not the product of man, and when that 
spirit leaves the body we believe that 
it goes back to the source from whence 
it came. When we look around us and 
see the beautiful works of nature, we 
find the sun giving us light and heat 
from day to day ,the planets moving in 
their regular orbits; we see the trees 
as they grow up from the ground, and 
the same sap that makes the bark and 
the wood feeds the leaf "and the blos- 
som; we plant in some spot of ground 
the seed of a variety of vegetables, and 
each comes forth- according to its kind, 
although the earth is apparently the 
same that has nourished each. We look 
throughout space, and all the condi- 
tions that exist give evidence to us that 
there is a power that is greater than 
that of man. I am grateful that I have 
been born among the Latter-day Saints, 



60 



GENERAL, CONFERENCE. 



and that I have been taught to revere 
the power we call God. I am grateful 
that I know there is a great and over- 
ruling providence, and I have been 
taught to believe, and do believe, that 
it comes from God the Eternal Father. 
We can look back upon the pages of 
sacred history and find a reason for our 
belief, though our brethren and sisters 
who do not believe in God may feel they 
cannot accept our teachings. We find 
that Adam, our first parent in the 
world, was not only given a sphere of 
action in which to work, but was in- 
structed by God the Father. He knew 
he was created in the image of the 
Father for he had seen Him face to 
face. Adam taught those with whom 
he was associated that there was a 
God in heaven, and admonished them 
to obey His laws. Down to the days of 
Noah the thought that there is a here- 
after and a home beyond the grave was 
instilled into the hearts of men. But 
there is in the world two powers — one 
power for good, and the other for evil. 
At the time of Noah the power of evil 
had so taken possession of the hearts 
of the children of men that it grieved 
Noah that God had made man, and the 
Lord in His wisdom sent the floods 
from heaven and destroyed mankind 
from the face of the earth, with the 
exception of a few who listened to the 
voice of His servant Noah. Then the 
world began to be peopled again, and 
great races inhabited many portions of 
the earth. If we follow down through 
the line of prophets we And that many 
of them walked and talked with God. 
that many received revelations from 
heaven enabling them to convince the 
children of men that this was no the- 
ory, but that it was a reality, and 
that there was a purpose in human be- 
ings dwelling upon the earth, and 
that purpose was that they might gain 
an exaltation in the kingdom of hea- 
ven. We And even down to the time 
of our Savior men generally believed 
in God. but the power of evil had 
put into the hearts of the children 
of men to destroy many of the pro- 
phets of the Lord, in order that their 
voices might be stilled, that the influ- 



ences of evil might gain greater sway 
among the children of men. Our 
Heavenly Father, in His mercy, sent 
His Only Begotten Son into the world, 
and He told the people as He labored 
with them that He was the Son of God. 
He ministered among them. He healed 
their sick, unstopped the ears of the 
deaf, restored the blind to sight, and 
raisfcd up the dead. He convinced 
those with whom He came in contact 
that there was a hereafter, and that 
the purpose of our living upon the 
earth is that we may prepare our- 
selves for that great future life. He 
eventually gave His life that this tes- 
timony might abide in the world. But 
there was another purpose. It re- 
quired in the providence of our Fath- 
er a pure and spotless person to find 
the way of the resurrection. Jesus 
Christ was a man without sin. By 
reason of His purity, His uprightness 
and His virtue, He was able to unlock 
the doors of the prison, to overcome 
-death and the grave, and pioneer the 
way for His fellow creatures unto that 
heaven where we expect to go. After 
He gave his mortal life He was per- 
mitted to come back an immortal be- 
ing, and visit with men in the flesh, but 
when the time came for Him to go 
again, although He was surrounded by 
His apostles, He departed heavenward 
and was received therein. Two an- 
gels in white stood before them and 
promised that as they saw Him go- 
ing to heaven so should He return 
again. Then we find that the Apostles 
who remained behind taught this same 
Gospel. The power of God descended 
upon them, even the Holy Ghost, which 
the Savior had promised should come, 
to bring things past to their remem- 
brance and to teach them things to 
come. It came upon them in that up- 
per room, in cloven tongues of fire, 
and they knew as they knew they lived 
that they had been endowed with pow- 
er from on high, and they proclaimed 
it to all men with whom they came in 
contact. They did not fear death, but 
they feared to be recreant to the trust 
our Father had reposed in them. They 
feared to turn their backs upon the 



ELDER GEORGE A. SMITH. 



61 



testimony they had received from 
heaven itself and from their associa- 
tion with the Son of God. When He 
said to them, "Go ye into all the world, 
and preach the Gospel to every crea- 
ture; he that believeth and is bap- 
tized shall be saved, and he that be- 
lieveth not shall be condemned," it 
was the voice! of God unto the children 
of men. When He said to Nicode- 
mus that unless he was born 
again he could not even see 
the kingdom of God, it was not the 
voice of man, it was the voice of 
God, and is a law binding upon all 
mankind. 

We have been placed here for a pur- 
pose. That purpose is that we may 
overcome the evil temptations that are 
placed in our way, that we may learn 
• to be charitable to one another, that 
we may overcome the passions with 
which we are beset, so that when the 
time comes for us to go to the other 
side we may be worthy, by reason of 
the effort we have put forth, to en- 
joy the blessings that our Father has 
in store for the faithful. The Latter- 
day Saints are believers in the words 
contained in the holy Scriptures. We 
believe that God created the heavens 
and the earth; and the same God that 
created the heavens and the earth 
declared that He made man in His 
own image; male and female created 
He them. No matter if scientists and 
great men of the world shall proclaim 
that we have evolved from the lower 
order of animals, the witness of the 
Spirit to you, my brethren and sis- 
ters, is that you are the offspring of 
the Lord, that the spirits which in- 
habit your bodies are immortal, and 
that in due time, if you are faithful, 
you will go back to the presence of 
that God who gave you life. 

Not only do we have the testimony 
of men who lived upon the eastern 
hemisphere, but in the providence of 
the Almighty we have received the 
testimony of the people who lived upon 
this western hemisphere. When the 
Savior ministered in the flesh He told 
His disciples at Jerusalem that He 
had other sheep, which were not of 



that fold, and that He must visit them, 
that there might be one fold and one 
shepherd. The question has been 
raised in the old world that Jesus 
was not of divine origin, because He 
was born as a little child, cradled in 
a manger, His mother being Mary and 
his reputed father Joseph the carpen- 
ter. Many have admitted that He was 
a great and good man, but they have 
desired to rob Him of the 
divinity of His birth. Fortunate- 
ly, however, for the Latter-day Saints, 
we have received a witness that these 
things are true; and in addition to that, 
we have received the testimony that He 
came to this western hemisphere, as re- 
corded in the Book of Mormon, and 
ministered unto the Nephites upon this 
continent. He did not come this time 
as a little child, but He came in the 
clouds of heaven; and His coming was 
proclaimed by a voice that penetrated 
to the very center of every person that 
dwelt in the land. He came this time 
as a man from heaven, and they saw 
Him come. They knew that He was the 
Christ, for His coming had been pre- 
dicted by their prophets. He gave to 
them the same organization that exist- 
ed in the Church at Jerusalem. 
He taught them that they must 
be baptized, as He had been, 
by those having authority to officiate 
in that ordinance. This was not the 
word of an ordinary man; it was the 
word of the Son of God, who had as- 
cended to His Father, and who had 
come back again, that the children of 
men might have another testimony add- 
ed to the number that had already been 
given 1 to them. 

Then in the day and age in which we 
live there arose another individual. A 
boy fourteen years of age believed what 
was contained in the Scriptures. He 
read in James, "If any of you lack wis- 
dom, let him ask of God, that giveth to 
all men liberally and upbraideth not: 
and it shall be given him." Believing 
those words, he went into the woods to 
pray, and his prayer was answered. 
His faith brought the blessing he so 
much desired. He received the record o£ 
the Book of Mormon. He not only had 
the witness of the Bible that Jesus was

the Christ, but he saw God the Father 
standing in the clouds of heaven, 
clothed with glory, and Jesus Christ, 
the Redeemer of the world, exalted at 
His right hand, and he heard the voice 
of the Lord, saying, "This is My Be- 
loved Son, hear Him." He bore testi- 
mony of this glorious vision to those 
with whom he was associated. Others 
also received a -witness from on high. 
Their testimony in the divinity of the 
Savior's mission had been increased and 
strengthened, so that it was no longer 
a matter of ancient history that God 
lived and that Jesus was the Christ; 
they knew it personally, because they 
had received a testimony themselves. 

As I look into the faces of this audi- 
ence I realize that this testimony has 
been handed down to you, not by mar;, 
but by the power of our heavenly Fatti- 
er, who has promised it to all of His 
children that will obey His command- 
ments and keep His laws. You are not 
dependent alone upon history, nor upon 
the teachings of any man, to know that 
this is the work of the Lord, because 
you have had it burned into your souls 
by the gift of the Holy Ghost. There 
is no doubt in your mind as to your, 
origin, nor as to the place you will go 
to when this life is over, if you are 
faithful to the trust reposed in you. We 
are not here to while away the hours* 
of this life and then pass to a sphere of 
exaltation; but we are here to qualify 
ourselves day by day for the positions 
that our Father expects us to fill here- 
after. We are here to learn to love 
one another. The great commandment 
that was given by the Savior to ths 
children of men in the day in which 
He lived is binding on us. • We are com- 
manded to love the Lord our God with 
all our might, mind and strength, and 
to love our neighbor as ourselves. In 
the, language of the poet, "Life is real, 
Life is earnest," and "the grave is not 
its goal." The spirit that inhabits the 
tabernacle is immortal. It lives beyond 
the grave. The body decays and re- 
turns to earth but the spirit lives on. 
None of us brethren and sisters, can 
control the beating of the heart? None 
of us, if it should stop, could start it 



again? Science has not discovered the 
secret. Yet there is a power that can 
do this and continues to do it, and we 
who are members of the fold of Christ 
know whence that power comes. 

If we believe as we claim, that Jesus 
is the Christ, and that we are the chil- 
dren of our heavenly Father, then how 
careful we should be to conduct our- 
selves that we may be worthy of the 
temples we occupy, which were created 
in the image of God. How many of us 
realize that by taking into our systeMo 
things that our Father has forbidden, 
we defile the temple of the spirit? How 
many of us stop to consider that when 
we give way to weakness of the flesh, 
we deprive ourselves of opportunities 
that await us in the future, and cut 
ourselves off from the blessings that the 
Lord hath in store for the faithful. As^ 
members of the Church of Christ, we 
should keep His commandments ana 
love one another. Then our love shoulu 
pass beyond the border lines of the 
Church with which we are identified, 
and reach out after the children 
of men, that the belief which is grow- 
ing in the world that God does not 
live and that the grave is our goal 
may be dissipated, and that in the 
place of that disbelief there may come 
a living faith, yea, a living know- 
ledge, that Jesus is the Christ, and 
that we are the "hilrirpa of the Fa- 
ther. Those of you who have received 
this witness have assumed an obliga- 
tion which you cannot turn your 
backs upon if you would. It must be 
declared by you to the children of 
men. The revelation that John re- 
ceived, that another angel should fly in 
the midst of heaven, having the ever- 
lasting Gospel to preach to men that 
dwell upon the earth, has been real- 
ized. Joseph Smith taught that he 
knew there was a hereafter, and that 
he knew that God lived, and that God 
knew that he knew that God lived. He 
was "willing to give his life in order 
that you, my brethren and sisters, 
might have your faith strengthened 
and that your confidence in him might 
not be shaken. He knew the purpose 
of this life. He knew that we were

here to prepare for the future and a 
more glorious existence. And he was 
willing, if need be, to give his own 
life, not simply that he might lose it, 
for our benefit, but because he knew 
that the Father had said that he who 
would save his life should lose it, 
but he who would lose his life for His 
sake should find it, even life eternal. 
It was this knowledge that made it 
possible for the Prophet and Patri- 
arch of the Church in early days to 
turn their backs upon loved ones, to 
be incarcerated in prison, and to give all 
that they had in this world, that men 
can give for their brethren — their mor- 
tal life. 

Brethren and sisters, this is a ser- 
ious matter. We should think of it 
seriouply. We should look into our 
own lives and discover if we are pre- 
pared for that great future life, 
if we were called hence tomor- 
row whether we would be pre- 
pared to give an account for our 
earthly deeds; whether we can feel 
that we would receive from our Hea- 
venly Father the welcome plaudit of 
"Well clone, good and faithful ser- 
vant." To preach the Gospel is our 
mission. Your sons and daughters are 
proclaiming it in the world. Let it in. 
deed be true, as was suggested by a 
Mission President from this stand, 
that when our missionaries look home- 
ward from the islands of the sea and 
from the nations of the earth they may 
see a home-guard, who are tried and 
true, who have been weighed in the 
balances and have not been found 
wanting, that their faith in us may not. 
waver, and that they may realize that 
we are willing and anxious to help 
the work of the Master in every pos- 
sible way. 

That the Lord may continue His 
blessings upon this gathering; that the 
peace which has characterized it so 
far may remain with all of us; that we 
may take it to our homes and dissem- 
inate it among the people where we 
live; that we may love the Lord our 
God; and be willing to keep His 
commandments, and not only be 
willing to die for the work, 
but willing to live for it. Let 



us see to it that we speak evil of no 
one, not even of those who speak evil 
of us. Let us extend to all our Fa- 
ther's children the hand of welcome, 
and teach unto them that we know 
without doubt that Jesus was and is 
the Christ, that Joseph Smith was a 
prophet of the living God, and that 
the men who represent the work today 
receive from our heavenly Father the 
inspiration and revelation of His mind 
and will when He desires to give it to 
them for the benefit of His Church. 
That we may be worthy of the honor 
God has given us that we may be 
worthy of the lineage whence we came 
that we may be faithful sons and 
daughters of God, worthy to bear His 
image in the earth, that we may not 
defile our tabernacles with anything 
that is impure or unholy, but that 
day by day we may let our light so 
shine that men, seeing our good 
works, will glorify our Father which 
is in heaven — that this may be our 
privilege, and that when our labors are 
finished and we are summoned back to 
our heavenly Father we may be wel- 
come there because of our faith and 
faithfulness here below, is my prayer 
in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

The choir and soloists rendered the 
beautiful anthem, "God of Israel, Hear 
our Prayer." 

ELDER JOHN HENRY SMITH. 

Keport of Visit to Southern pan of Mexico- 
Wise Rulers and Superior Rare of Natives- 
The Work of God will Triumph. 

My brothers and sisters, on the 21st 
of February I started upon a journey to 
the state of Tabasco, telling President 
Smith upon leaving that I would return 
to attend this conference. My purpose 
in going was the discharge of a sacred 
duty, and also in the hope of securing 
my complete return to health. I pre- 
sumed that I had so arranged matters 
that I would be able to be in attend- 
ance at the first day of the conference. 
Two weeks ago yesterday I left the 
town of Cardenas, in an Indian canoe, 
to make my way with my companions 
to the capital of the state, San Juan 
Baptiste. We reached that place in the 
anticipation that, on the 28th of last 
month, from Fontara the steamer 



64 



GENERAL, CONFERENCE. 



■would bring us to Vera Cruz; but upon 
our arrival we learned that the steamer 
would not sail until the 30th, and so 
we remained in the capital of the state 
for a few days, mingling with the lead- 
ing people, having interviews with the 
governor and .Tifipolitico, and finding to 
our surprise a wonderfully fine people. 
The city is said to contain about 20,000 
inhabitants, and is located upon Gijalva 
river. The people are mostly of Span- 
ish extraction, with an intermixture of 
the Indian races. We were treated with 
the utmost courtesy by the governor 
of the state and by the people with 
whom he mingled. We left there on 
the 29th, in the anticipation that upon 
the 30th we would be enabled to leave 
Fontara upon our way home. On ar- 
riving there, we learned that the sailing 
of our boat would not occur until the 
first of April, and on the evening of 
that day we left Fontara. We reached 
Vera Cruz, crossing the Gulf of Mexico, 
just after noon on Sunday last, and at 
once made our way to the railroad. 
Part of our company remained in Vera 
Cruz; Elder B. F. Grant and myself 
started immediately for home. We suc- 
ceeded in making our connections along 
the railroads very nicely until we 
reached El Paso, Texas, where we 
found that a quarantine had been put 
into operation against what was said 
to be the fever districts of Old Mexico, 
and as we had come from Vera Cruz, 
which had been especially tabooed, we 
were restrained from continuing our 
journey for 24 hours, thus preventing 
me from reaching here yesterday as I 
had expected to do. 

I desire to say that my experience in 
southern Mexico has been one of the 
most pleasant; 10 days of my time 
on horseback, six in Indian canoes, and 
the balance of the time looking over 
the country, studying the conditions, 
making the acquaintance of the people 
and satisfying myself as to the char- 
acteristics of the land. My associates 
also have been well pleased with their 
experience. Some of them, I presume, 
are on the way to this city, and I ar- 
rived here at 1:30 today. 

I am pleased to be with you in con- 



ference, to hear the voices of those who 
have sung their glorious songs for us, 
to listen to the remarks of the Elders, 
and to hear the words of prayer that 
have gone up to the Supreme Being in 
the interest of the people of God and 
of all the children of our Father. I re- 
joice in the glorious work the "Lord 
hath established, and have always held 
in remembrance the promise which has 
been made that no weapon that is 
formed against this work shall prosper, 
and they that rise Up in judgment 
against it shall find themselves utterly 
discomfited. I trust that, in fulfilment 
of the great mission God has assigned 
to this people, the spirit of liberty, of 
justice, of mercy, of determination, and 
a willingness to devote themselves to 
the betterment of the conditions of 
mankind, shall in no sense be checked, 
but that in the onward march and 
growth of this work its sons and daugh- 
ters shall be found upon the side of 
every correct principle and in favor of 
the broadest liberty and the greatest 
good to our Father's children. When 
we remember that beneath the folds 
of this great work the whole human 
race, excepting those who have reject- 
ed God and consented to the death of 
the Redeemer of the world, shall find 
lodgment in the various kingdoms our 
Father has established, and obtain the 
reward that they justly earn as the ful- 
filment of their part in the world, it 
should be a joy- to every one of tis to 
krow that we have part and lot in its 
accomplishment, and our efforts for its 
fulfilment and upbuilding should be 
shown in every direction. Our Father 
has never abandoned this work from 
the moment that He and His Son spoke 
to the Prophet. It has been one con- 
tinued onward march. Many things 
have arisen to interfere with its de- 
velopment and growth; many schemes 
and devices have been put upon foot 
by mankind looking to its overthrow; 
but the promise that nothing should 
prosper that was raised in opposition to 
it has been fulfilled to the letter, and 
in future time, as we move forward 
In the accomplishment of the destiny 



ELDER JESSE 

God has marked out for His work, the 
same will be true. 

I have nothing but good words for 
the people of Mexico; for President 
Diaz and his cabinet; for the cover - 
nors of the states which it has been 
my privilege to visit, for the mayors 
of the towns, and for the people them- 
selves. Those Indian races in Tabasco 
are among the finest and most industri- 
ous people I have met. They lack 
in some degree that trained mentality 
which is found among the larger por- 
tion of the Christian people of the 
world: but there are within them the 
elements of success, as has been shown 
in the lives of such heroic men as Por- 
firio Diaz and Benito Juarez. I trust 
that the heroic spirit shown by these 
men may continue through their gene- 
rations, that liberty and truth, justice 
and mercy, may characterize that peo- 
ple, and that the visitation of the Savior 
of the world in past times, which made 
such an impress upon their souls and 
led them to anticipate His coming, 
causing them to surrender to the min- 
ions of Cortez because they were look- 
ing for the coming of the Redeemer, 
mav be realized more fully and more 
correctly in the future than it was re- 
alized in that experience of theirs. 

My brothers and my sisters, I feel it 
would be unwise upon my part to take 
more of your time. I stand with my 
associates in the declaration of that 
eternal truth that the Father has es- 
tablished. I stand with them as a wit- 
ness for God and for the Redeemer of 
the world, as a witness for Josenh 
Smith and the men who stood with him, 
and who have made successful the work 
established through him on the earth. 
I trust that in future, at no time or 
place, shall my voice ever be raised 
in condemnation of His work or of its 
continuance among the children of men. 
While I thus speak of the work of the 
Lord itself, I speak also of my country 
and its glorious constitution. I pray 
for its continuance and for the princi- 
ples enunciated by it. I trust that in 
the future, as in ihe past, we may be 
ready to maintain the liberties of all 
men to the utmost limit, and never be-

tray a trust, nor turn back upon those 
principles, while God shall give us 
breath. May peace and love abound 
in your hearts and homes. May the 
songs of praise that come from the lips 
of the sons and daughters of God be 
heard in every land and clime, and may 
the choice spirit that He bestows in the 
Holy Ghost lighten your souls and lift 
you up to obey His will and keep His 
commandments during time and all 
eternity, is my prayer in the name of 
Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER JESSE W. KNIGHT. 

(2nd Counselor in Presidency of Taylor 
Stake.) 

My dear brothers and sisters, this is 
the first time in my life I ever stood 
before an audience in this house to 
sneak, and I trust I may be able to 
make you hear. It gives me pleasure 
at this time to stand before you as a 
representative of Taylor Stake in the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-dav 
Saints, and to speak in behalf of the 
people of that stake of Zion. We have 
held ward conferences in the Stake, and 
they have been well attended. We 
have also unanimously sustained all 
the general authorities of the Church. 
I do not believe there ever was a time 
when I felt better than at the present 
in regard to the truthfulness and the 
onward progress of this work. I re- 
joice to know- that the authorities of 
this Church have all our interests at 
heart. They do not forget any of us, 
not even the people that are far off. 
The people in the north country last 
year suffered somewhat from drouth, 
and this season the Church has come to 
rescue by advancing means to help 
some of the people to get seed grain. 
I mention this to show the interest and 
the anxiety that the authorities of the 
Church have for the Latter-day Saints 
wherever they are, and that no matter 
how far we get away from headquar- 
ters, we are not forgotten. I wish to 
say, we appreciate these things, and I 
know that those who live near by do 
not feel that they are being robbed 
when we are helped in this way. This 



66 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



community has grown out of toil, labor, 
industry, and the mutual support of one 
another: and we feel that without the 
support we get from our fellow-men 
it would be hard to carry on this gi eat 
■work. I rejoice to know that the La:- 
ter-day Saints are writing their history 
upon the soil, by industrious toil, and 
by the building up of new settlements 
and towns, and in branching out into 
various parts of the world. I can see 
what this is cooing for the Latter-dav 
Saints. If we were left in crowded 
cities, we would soon have the ;lums 
and the beggars; but as it is, throug'i 
the counsel and the wisdom of those 
who are nlaced at the head of the 
Church, when they have seen young men 
crowding the streets with nothing to 
do, they start some industry in some 
new country, and enable these young 
men to make homes for them- 
selves. I rejoice to say that the 
Latter-dav Saints in Canada are 
building up many new homes and es- 
tablishing themselves there: and many 
young people who, if they had remained 
in this country would possibly be work- 
ing for small wages, or perhaps loaf- 
ing their time away, have gone into a 
new country, taken advantage of the 
opportunities placed before them, and 
have become factors in building up a 
community. I do not think the people 
should feel to mourn when their sons 
and daughters desire to launch out for 
themselves, when they have not suf- 
ficient means and property to keep 
them at home. I think it is a good 
thing for them to go out into these new 
countries and establish homes for them- 
selves. This is only one phase of the 
Church of God; but I think it spea*B 
well for the wisdom which has been 
manifest from the beginning of this 
Church when the leaders do these 
things. We rejoice to know that we 
have established in our country, through 
the advice of the President of the 
Church, an industry which is furnish- 
ing employment for the people, and 
which is building up that community. 

I feel to bear my testimony at th»s 
time. I do not think it would be wise 
for me to speak long, but I trust that 
the spirit which has been with us this 



conference will continue. I know that 
this work is true, and that the Lord is 
blessing His people, especially those 
who are sustaining the authorities and 
helping to spread this nvork rather than 
to tear it down. I hope that the time 
will never come when I will feel that 
my voice is more potent than the voices 
of ten thousand people, and that I will 
never see the time when I will think 
I am so smart, and that the leaders of 
the Church have lost all their wisdom 
and are such terrible hypocrites and 
robbers, that my hand will be lifted 
against any of them. I say that we 
have the right to vote as we feel, but 
we should also exercise wisdom and 
judgment. I do not think that one man 
can have all the wisdom and brains for 
such a large community as the Latter- 
day Saints. I pray God to bless us all, 
in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER ANDREW KIMBALL. 
(President of St. Joseph Sjtake.) 

This suspense is painful, in waiting 
and facing this immense congregation. 
The worst experience of this kind I 
ever had was before I went on my 
mission. The mission was not half so 
bad as the suspense. Another time I 
suffered was before I went to Arizona. 

I come from the St. Joseph Stake 
of Zion, where we were cutting lucern 
hay when I left, and wheat was in 
head, roses in bloom, and the country 
covered with beautiful grass and flow- 
ers. The California poppy was to be 
seen ;n acres on the hillside, and so 
beautiful that we could even out-do 
California in growing the flower em- 
blem of their state. The Lord has 
been very kind to us in one way, and 
I presume has been very cautious in 
another way, not to give us too much. 
We suffered from drouth for several- 
years, until many of our people became 
discouraged and went into the wet 
country of Oregon; but now the rains 
have come to Arizona, and the people 
are coming back again, inasmuch as 
they have had drouth in that usually 
rainy country. We have had a large 
amount of rain during the greater part 
of this year; but it has been disastrous

to us m the great floods that followed. 
I presume we have lost over 3,000 acres 
ot choice farming land along the river 
banks. The heavier floods did not do 
sr> much harm as those that have con- 
tinued in steady grinding agains't the 
bank 1 ?. The heavy floods in January 
covered many acres of ground that had 
been planted, and where the crops were 
up and doing well. After that had 
dried, the brethren planted again. Then 
in February the floods came again and 
covered that over. They planted the 
third time; and if it gets covered up 
any more they will plant corn, because 
we can plant something every month 
in the year. 

It won't do for me to undertake to tell 
any stories, because when I told about 
a 37 pound sweet potato they would not 
believe me; and when I tell about those 
melons that Brother Clawson, Brother 
MeMurrin and Sister Aggie Campbell 
helped to eat down there, weighing 
from 40 to 60 pounds, and that we 
raise from Ave to seven crops of al- 
falfa hay, and two crops of field prod- 
ucts, people won't believe that. Now I 
will tell you a modest story about the 
l'avages of the terrible old Gila river. 
It was kind to some people and very- 
severe to others. There was a widow- 
woman, who paid her honest tithing, 
that had 50 acres of soil added to her 
farm; while on the other side of the 
river it took 65 acres away from an- 
other party. Then there was another 
widow lady that Imd her farm washed 
away, wire fences and all, and the next 
siorm that came along planted back on 
that foundation the same number of 
acres of soil, .but it did not give back 
the wire fences, and the land was not 
level, nor were there any weeds on it. 
Down on the Imperial — a new country 
that is being established at the mouth 
of the Colorado river—it is very low, 
and the water is apt to cover it up; 
so we sent some soil on down the Gila 
river to try and accommodate them, 
and make the land higher. We are not 
dwouraged, if we have lost 3,000 acres 
of land. We are going to where there 
are higher lands; and we can repair our 



canals. There have been 22 canals in- 
jured in these floods; the heads of the 
canals and sometimes miles of them 
have been torn away. Our people have 
to go to work and rebuild. The rains 
have continued, and we are going to 
raise our crops this year almost with- 
out irrigation, at least one crop of grain 
and two of alfalfa. As the flood waters 
soften the banks along the river, the 
soil being of a rich sandy loam, it 
crumbles and caves in, the water be- 
comes so thick with sediment that it 
rolls and tumbles in its rush, and 
finally forms a levee or sand bar, this 
diverts the stream and causes it to 
leave its natural channel, if it ever 
had one, and as it shoots across to the 
opposite bank it cuts out farm land 
and carries the soil and deposits it 
again on another sand bar or cape be- 
low. This makes it reasonable to under- 
stand how farms can be shifted from 
one place to another. 

This is only the temporal side. The 
ptople of God in that section of the 
country are a good people. I think they 
are about the best in the world. I love 
them, and I believe they love me, be- 
cause I champion their cause every op- 
portunity I have. My counselors are 
good, stalwart men. We are united. 
We meet every Monday night in our 
council meetings. The first Saturday in 
every month we meet with the Saints 
in our Priesthood meetings. The 
Sunday school union assembles in 
the chapel of our Academy building at 
10 a. m. The High Council meet the 
same hour in the new building that has 
been constructed by the Bishop of 
Thatcher ward. At 12:15 all the Priest- 
hood come together, and after the open- 
ing exercises they disperse to the dif- 
ferent rooms, the High Priests in one 
room, the Seventies in another, the El- 
ders in another, and they enter upon a 
consideration of principles of the Gos- 
pel. We do not have sufficient material 
in any one ward to organize the Priests 
of the Lesser Priesthood, so we have 
made a stake organization of the 
Priests, and at 1 o'clock they meet in 
the academy. They are taking up the

study of the principles of the Gospel, 
so that as they go from house to house, 
holding block meetings, they will be 
prepared to teach the people those prin- 
ciples, and be qualified to act as block 
teachers. The Deacons collect the fast 
offerings in the wards. 

During the last winter the presidency 
and High Council divided the stake into 
districts, and we have gone on mis- 
sions from house to house, without 
purse or scrip. In this way we are 
warming the people up. Some of my 
brethren have stayed with luke-warm 
members for three months, more or 
less, and have never let up until they 
got them converted back unto the Gos- 
pel. I am indeed pleased with the la- 
bors of my brethren. It may not be 
considered any credit vo our stake that 
we are not troubled with High Council 
trials; we win the people unto the Gos- 
pel by loving kindness, rather than by 
coercion and unkind driving. Our High 
Council meet in the spirit of love, and 
kindness, and union, discuss the prin- 
ciples of the Gospel, and keep in touch 
with the authorities, and thus prepare 
themselves to do good work. I do not 
suppose that down in that far off land 
we are going to set any pattern, but it 
may be that, after six years of ex- 
perience, we are able to offer some 
suggestions that will help new stake 
presidents. We invite the sisters into 
our Priesthood meeting; and at 2 
o'clock promptly we commence. The 
sisters join in the opening exercises, 
singing, -etc., then we have the roll 
call, and each order of the Priesthood 
stands up to be counted, followed by 
the auxiliary organizations. The breth- 
ren and sisters are there also to re- 
ceive the word of God as it comes from 
those who preside. After these in- 
structions of a general character, the 
women withdraw and meet by them- 
selves. The president of the stake is 
in touch with the Presidency of the 
Church and presiding Bishopric, and 
the presidency of the stake meet in 
council from week to week, and are 
prepared to counsel the people, so that 
when they come together they are fed, 
and when they go back home they say 



to their neighbors, "You ought to have 
been at the Priesthood meeting, for in- 
deed it was a feast of fat things." Our 
Priesthood meetings seem better than 
conferences, they are so representative 
in character. The spirit is so good that 
pervades them and the work that is 
accomplished makes it appear like hav- 
ing a conference every 30 days. In 
those meetings we try to get expres- 
sions from the different sections, re- 
cognizing all. 

It is not my purpose to do much 
preaching there, but rather to be the 
general, if possible, directing the labors 
in the stake, and dividing the responsi- 
bilities among the people. Myself and 
counselors have apportioned between 
us the supervision of the auxiliary or- 
ganizations. My younger counselor 
takes the Young Men's and Young La- 
dies' associations; President Johnson, 
the old pioneer, takes care of the Re- 
lief society and the Primary, and I look 
after the Sunday school, which I am 
very much interested in, and the Re- 
ligion class. Then we are in competi- 
tion to see which can make our or- 
ganizations the best. Of course, I look 
after all of them in a general way. 
The senior members of the High Coun- 
cil gives special attention to the home 
missionaries. The third Sunday in the 
month we meet together and discuss 
current events and principles, so that 
when we go out among the people we 
are prepared to give them something to 
enlighten their minds, under the in- 
spiration of the Spirit of God. We are 
united, and the people's hearts are 
melted in kindness. The kindergar- 
ten department of our academy, desir- 
ing to make a little means, proffered to 
have a lunch at noon for our Priest- 
hood meetings. It went on for a little 
while, and finally we established the 
Priests' meetings, and in order to help 
it out the presidency met with the boys. 
The meetings became so interesting 
that as soon as the High Priests and 
the Seventies and Elders got out of 
their meetings, instead of them going to 
get something to eat, they came in to 
get a little more spiritual food, and 
listen to the delineation of the princi-

pies of the Gospel. It was no par, 
ticuiar compliment to ourselves, but it 
was one of the greatest evidences of 
the devotion of the people in that 
stake of Zion, that they hungered after 
the Gospel and preferred it to some- 
thing to eat. Ward conference is also 
"record day." When we go out to at- 
tend these gatherings we invite repre- 
sentatives of each of the auxiliary or- 
ganizations, and the Priesthood, to ac- 
company us. During the noon hour we 
examine the records and by this means 
we stir the ward organizations up, and 
there is an incentive for these organiza- 
tions to take care of their records. 

I realize, my brethren and sisters, 
that there are those whom we all desire 
to hear. You have not come from a 
lcng distance to hear me; but it may be 
that in the exchange of ideas we can 
all be benefitted. I have often thought 
that if the presidents of stakes could 
get together in a convention for the 
purpose of exchanging ideas about how 
best to succeed, we might possibly 
elicit some ideas by which each could 
be benefited. Our Bishops also might 
get together and converse upon their 
duties, and get at the best ideas to 
accomplish the greatest amount of good 
to the greatest number of people. 

We are indeed greatly blessed, and I 
know - this is the work of God. We 
have heard much about revelation in 
the last few months. My counselors 
and myself sit in council for the wel- 
fare of our stake, and determine upon 
some policy. We start upon that policy 
for the good of the people, and often- 
times we no more than get started 
than we receive a letter from the Presi- 
■ dency of the Church outlining the same 
policy, and we found we had been 
sitting in council on that question at 
the very same time as the Presidency 
in Sa'lt Lake. I will venture that if 1 
were to ask my brethren away up in 
- Canada, and throughout Zion, and those 
on missions all over the world, I would 
no doubt find that these brethren are 
inspired at the same time and on the 
same subjects that are for the inter- 
ests of the people of God. We do en- 
joy the spirit of revelation. We do 



enjoy that inspiration which guides 
and directs us for the welfare of the 
people. Notwithstanding that we live 
away off, with only a visit now and 
then from the Apostles, and once in a 
great while representatives from the 
auxiliary organizations, we do not get 
off on some ism or schism and false 
doctrine, as is the case with the gen- 
tile world. We are on good terms with 
our brethren not of our faith. Just re- 
cently I have stood on the platform 
with a Methodist minister two different 
times and preached funeral sermons 
ever Gentile ladies. They keep sending 
for me. Over in Safford not long ago 
the people said, "What a pity Brother 
Kimball is a 'Mormon,' the doctrines 
he teaches are so comforting." 

Brethren and sisters, this is the work 
of God. I know that Joseph Smith 
was a Prophet of God, and was raised 
up in this the dispensation of the ful- 
ness of times, to establish this work. 
And these men who have been called 
to preside are indeed leaders of the 
Church, and God is leading and direct- 
ing them and taking care of this work. 
God bless you, in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 

Elder Charles Kent sang effectively 
the hymn which begins with the line, 
"The Seer, the Seer, Joseph the Seer."

My brethren and sisters, I have great- 
ly enjoyed every meeting we have held 
during this conference. I never en- 
joyed a conference better in my life, 
and I have attended a great many. 
I never saw more unanimity of feeling 
among the Latter-day Saints than I 
have witnessed during our gatherings 
in this anniversary of the organization 
of the Church. I have never seen 
more power and influence among the 
■ Priesthood in their assemblies than I 
have witnessed during our gathering 
here. There has not been a jar; there 
has not been an ill feeling. All the 



70

brethren in the priesthood assembled 
have with one heart and mind en- 
dorsed and approved the course that 
has been pursued by the President of 
the Church and his counselors in all 
the affairs pertaining to the Church, 
both spiritually and temporally, as we 
divide them, although with the Lord 
they are all spiritual. There has been 
a wonderful expression of confidence 
and good will, love and affection to- 
wards the man who stands at the 
head of the Church today, and who is 
endowed with all the authority, keys, 
gifts and blessings to lead the Church 
that were conferred upon the mar- 
tyred Seer, about whom we have just 
heard in the song. I bear my testi- 
mony, in association with my breth- 
ren, that I know that God is with 
His people; that the power of His 
Spirit, which is the spirit of revela- 
tion, rests down upon the President 
of the Church today, and is with his 
associates, and that all things in the 
Church are being conducted for the in- 
terest of the people, for the kingdom of 
God, and for the benefit of humanity. 

The religion you and I have em- 
braced, my brethren and sisters, is 
not a mere psalm-singing, praying and 
preaching religion. It is a religion that 
comes to us as we are, as men and 
women, as beings living on the earth 
in the flesh, as persons who have to do 
with the things of time as well as the 
things of eternity. In the Doctrine and 
Covenants, on page 307, you will read 
these words: 

"The spirit and the body is the soul of 
man. And the resurrection from the 
dead is the redemption of the soul." 

I call your attention to the fact that 
we are not only spiritual beings, who 
have received our origin as such from 
our Eternal Father, but we also have 
bodies, fashioned out of the elements 
that compose this earth, which God has 
made for that purpose. And the relig- 
ion that God has sent down out of 
heaven in the last days is a religion 
for man as he is, for the souls of men. 
In the Book of Genesis, 1st chap., we 
read that God made man in his own 
image; that He made them male and 



female, and gave him the great com- 
mandment, the first which was that 
he should "increase and multiply and 
inherit the earth and subdue it and 
have dominion over all things" upon 
the face of the earth and in the: firma- 
ment around. We are told in the sec- 
ond chapter of Genesis that He formed 
the body of man out of the dust. God 
did that. He made the body of man 
as well as his spirit, and He gave 
him commandments in relation to his 
body. He gave him commandments 
in regard to the fruits that grew up- 
on the trees in the Eden that God had 
planted. He gave him laws in relation 
to the present as well as those that 
pertained to the future. 

"We should understand that God has 
something to do with earthly things 
as well as those things that we call 
heavenly. It was He that made this 
globe on which you and I live. God 
called the elements together — these 
elements that He says are eternal. 
You will read that in the Doctrine and 
Covenants, page 331. The Lord says 
that the elements— that is, the essence 
of things that we call material, and 
that scientists call matter — are eternal; 
and He called the elementary particles 
together that now compose this globe, 
which at first was covered with water. 
Water is composed of gases, as scien- 
tists tell us, and they are beginning 
to understand that the gases which in 
certain proportions appear in the form 
of water, are themselves composite; 
that these elements, as they were once 
called, are not elementary ; but that you 
can go back of the water to the gases 
of which it is composed, and then you 
can dissolve these gases into still near- 
er primary elements. And you may 
go on until you come to the real es- 
sence or atoms of elementary exist- 
ence. The Lord says they are eternal. 
They were not created, in the sense 
that some people use the term. Now, 
the Lord says that these elements are 
eternal, and that "spirit and element, 
inseparably connected, receiveth a full- 
ness of joy, and when separated man 
cannot receive a fullness of joy." So 
we shall find that not only in time, but

In eternity, when the soul is re- 
deemed, when the spirit and the body, 
which are the soul of man, are 
joined together in the resurrection of 
the dead and are made eternal and im- 
mortal, the body as well as the spirit, 
that there Is something to do in regard 
to the material elements in the uni- 
verse of God. God is a being that 
takes cognizance of us as We are, and 
the religion He has given us is not 
merely what is called a spiritual re- 
ligion, but it is also a temporal religion, 
using the term as men use it. 

In the twenty-ninth section of the 
Doctrine and Covenants, God says that 
He made all things. He speaks there 
of the earth and the animals upon it, 
and the vegetation that grows out of the 
ground, and of the material things 
which men handle. The Lord says He 
created them all by the word of His 
power, "firstly spiritual, and secondly 
temporal;" and the last of His works 
will be "firstly temporal, and secondly 
spiritual." But He explains further, 
that to Him all these things are spirit- 
ual, because they are eternal. The ele- 
ments are eternal, and therefore God 
calls them spiritual; for the things tlrSt 
are temporal are those that pass away, 
and the things that are spiritual are 
those that remain. So we will find by 
and by, when we understand things as 
God understands them, that they are 
all eternal in His sight; for His eyes 
penetrate to the essence of things, 
while we can only see things on the 
surface. The things that pass away 
from our gaze, caught up as it were fn 
the air and passing out of sight, like 
the vapors of the sea drawn up by the 
sun— the elements of these things re- 
main and abide, and cannot be annihi- 
lated. Not one particle of matter can 
be annihilated; not one particle of spirit 
can be annihilated; for they are eter- 
nal. They always were, in their essen- 
tial particles, in their primary elements, 
and they always will abide, though 
their forms may be changed by the 
power of the great Creator. The Lord 
tells us in His revelations, as you will 
find in the 131st section of the Doctrine 
and Covenants, that we shall find some 



time, when we can see things properly, 
that all are to that extent material 
that they exist and do not pass away; 
that spirit is matter of a refined and 
purified nature, different from that which 
•we call matter. There are two primary 
divisions, we may say, in the universe 
—spirt and matter; or, as the Lord 
calls them, spirit and element. God has 
to do with both. He organized both, 
He rules over both, and gives laws in 
relation to both. And it is only by the 
eternal, inseparable union of the spirit' 
ual and the material, or elementary, 
that perfect happiness can come. So 
God our heavenly Father, who is the 
Father of our spirits with whom we 
dwelt, with Jesus Christ our Eldei 
Brother, before the foundations of 
this earth were laid is the 
Father of our spirits and the framer 
and former of our bodies. He prepared 
this earth for our abode. He brought 
together the chaotic particles, which 
now are a solid globe governed by His 
laws. He brought forth the earth at 
the right time and in the right place, 
that it might keep up the equilibrium 
necessary to be maintained in the 
worlds that He created before. He 
formed this earth for us, His children, 
that we might come here and obtain a 
portion of it, organized according to 
the laws of generation, which we will 
find also are eternal; that we might 
have a portion of the elements of this 
globe to fashion these bodies, in which 
our eternal, immortal spirits might en- 
ter, and that we might claim ttiem as 
ours, when the great change that w* 
call death that must pass upon all peo- 
ple shall come. It is necessary for our 
education, for our experience, that we 
might know what it is. When that 
change comes, and the spirit of man is 
separated from the body, that is not 
the end of the body, any more than it^s 
the end of the spirit; but at the wor3 
of the Lord, whose word formed this 
organized globe out of chaos, our bodies 
shall be brought forth again, and Oi8 
particles that belong to each other and 
which are essential to the organization 
of these bodies, will be brought from 
the dust, and the spirit and the body

will be reunited. We will then stand in 
the presence of God, and all he rele- 
gated to our respective spheres— the 
places we have prepared ourselves fui 
by our earthly acts. 

New, I want to emphasize the point 
and make it clear to your minds, if 1 
can, that these bodies that God has giv- 
en iis, fashioned though they be out of 
dust, and to all appearances are merely 
temporal, are bodies which we shall 
have in the world to come. Our inheri- 
tance will be with them. Therefore, 
God gives us laws for their government 
now. He gives laws for the govern- 
ment of each individual as an entity. 
He gives laws for the government 
of His Church, as a collective body. 
He places at the head of it a man to 
receive His word, whenever He de- 
signs to give His word to the people; 
and we have a man now who is capable, 
ready and willing, and who has the 
authority, the keys and the power to 
receive the word of God, whether by 
His own voice, by the voice of angels, 
by the manifestation of visions, or by 
the power and gift of the Holy Ghost, 
by which holy men of old spoke and 
wrote. God will give us laws for our 
government, not only in relation to 
these things that people call spiritual, 
but also in relation to what we call 
temporalities; for He recognizes us as 
we are. We are His children, and we 
need to be guided and directed in all 
our works and ways. The silver and 
the gold, the metals of every kind, the 
wheat and the fine flour, the cattle on 
a thousand hills, and all things 
that the earth produces, the 
Lord says are His. And they 
are; for He made them, and He 
has care over them all. To think that 
God cares for nothing but singing and 
praying, and that some time we will 
sit on the corner of a cloud twanging 
a harp through all eternity, and that is 
to be our heaven, is an absurdity to 
my mind. We will be living beings, 
with a body as well as a spirit, in the 
image of our God. As the Apostle John 
said, "Beloved, now are we the sons 
of God; and it doth not yet appear what 
we shall be, but we know that when 



he appears we shall be like him; for 
we shall see him as he is. And every 
man that hath this hope, purifieth him- 
self, even as he is pure." That is the 
lesson. God has given these bodies to 
us to be preserved in purity, according 
to the laws He has given us by revela- 
tion and in nature. We are to govern 
ourselves by the laws of God, revealed 
ficm on high, and by the laws of na- 
ture, and make ourselves just as happy 
and as comfortable as we can under 
the circumstances in which we are 
placed. Do right to one another. Let 
no man infringe upon the rights of his 
neighbor; regard every man's rights as 
sacred, understanding that we are all 
the children of our heavenly Father, 
all brethren and sisters, whether we are 
Latter-day Saints or latter-day sinners; 
but more especially should our love and 
affection and help be extended to the 
household of faith, to those who have 
been baptized into Christ, and have put 
on Christ, and have become part of 
Him. 

Now, my brethren and sisters, the 
Lord has given us a law in regard to 
the management of the temporalities 
of the Church, which is the law of tith- 
ing. It is not a new law. It was not 
invented by Joseph F. Smith, nor by 
Joseph the Seer. It existed in the days 
of Christ. It existed in the days of 
Moses. It existed in the days of Abra- 
ham. Abraham paid tithes. To whom? 
To Melchisedek, the priest of the Most 
High God. And we have no account 
anywhere of Abraham demanding an 
account of how Melchisedek handled 
the tithes. In the days of Moses, you 
will. read in the 14th chapter of Num- 
bers (I have not time to turn to these 
passages; you can read them when you 
go home) what the tithes were for. 
They were given to the sons of Levi. 
You can read about it also in the New 
Testament, in the Vth chapter of He- 
brews. If you want to know the bless- 
ings that came when the people paid 
their tithes, read the 30th chapter of II 
Chronicles. These tithes were given 
to the men that God appointed, arid 
they handled them as sacred things, 
and they had the power and authority 



ELDER C. W. PENROSE. 



73 



to administer them as the Lord decreed. 
In the last chapter of Malachi, as 
you are well aware, the Lord reproach- 
ed the people in that day because they 
had neglected to pay their tithes. He 
said they had robbed Him. "Will a 
man rob God? Yet ye have robbed me. 
Wherein have we robbed thee? In 
tithes and in offerings. Bring ye all 
the tithes into my storehouse, that 
there may be meat therein, and I will 
open the windows of heaven, and I will 
pour you out a blessing, that there 
shall not be room enough to receive it. 
And I will rebuke the devourer for your 
sakes; and it shall no longer destroy 
the fruits of your ground, and all na- 
tions shall call you a delightsome peo- 
pe; for ye shall be a blessed people, 
saith the Lord of hosts." 

In the last days, the Lord in the be- 
ginning gave the law of consecration, 
and the people of Israel in the last 
days were slow to hearken to the com- 
mandments of God, as Israel was in the 
days of Moses; so the Lord introduced 
afterwards the law of tithing, which 
you will find in the 119th section of the 
Doctrine and Covenants. And the Lord 
tells us what it is for. For the laying 
•of the foundations of Zion, and also to 
pay the debts of my Priesthood, the 
Presidency, saith the Lord. You read it 
now, and find out what the Lord says 
tithing is for. Read the 120th section, 
and you will see how the Lord said it 
should be disbursed at that time. That 
was in Zion, Jackson county, when they 
first went there. Of late years, the_ 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints, in conference assembled, has/ 
voted for the power to handle the funds 
of the Church and the properties of 
the Church by the Trustee-in-trust for 
the Church. You have done that dur- 
ing this conference. We did it years 
and years ago. We have done it every 
conference from the time we came into 
• these vales of the mountains. Now let 
me say that the authority is given of 
God to the man that stands at the 
head of this Church, to preside over the 
whole Church, and to be like unto 
Moses. He is a prophet, and a seer, 
and a revelator, and everything in the 



Church is under his direction. The 
Bishops receive the tithing. The Pre- 
siding bishopric handle and keep an ac- 
count of it. But the Trustee-in-Trust 
is voted upon by the people to have 
the control and direction and to be 
responsible for all the funds and prop- 
erties of the Church. We have en- 
dorsed that authority during this con- 
ference, as we always have done. It 
is no new thing. Now, I bear my tes- 
timony, from what I know, that the 
man who stands at the head of this 
Church is honest, honorable, upric;* 
careful, full of tenderness and kind- 
ness to the poor. Thousands and 
thousands of dollars out of the tith- 
ing are expended for the benefit of the 
poor; but you cannot find a com- 
mand anywhere in the revelations of 
God to the Church that says the tun- 
ings are for that purpose. The Lord 
says that the rich are to be humbled 
for the benefit of the poor. He says 
also that the people are to fast and 
to bestow their offerings for the poor. 
You can read about that in the Book 
of Isaiah, 58th chap. But thousands 
of dollars from the tithing are ex- 
pended for the sustenance of the poor, 
as well as the fast offerings and the 
Relief society gatherings. We want 
to understand these things and look 
into them, and not be led away by any 
will-o'-the-wisp or jack-o'-lantern that 
may come along. Get the true light. 
Let that day star arise in your hearts 
that the Apostle Peter spoke of. We 
have also a more sure word of proph- 
ecy, he says, "which is like unto a 
light shining in a dark place, where- 
unto ye would do well that ye take 
heed, until the day dawn, and the day 
star arise in your hearts; knowing this 
first, that no prophecy of the scrip 
ture is of private interpretation, an-' 
that holy men of old spoke as thev 
were moved upon by the Holy Ghost." 

Now, my brethren and sisters, the 
power of God, the Spirit of the Lord, 
which declares His mind and His will, 
has been with us during this confer- 
ence. Every man who holds the 
Priesthood has a right to its inspira- 
tions, if he will listen to them. Every 



74 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



man and woman in Israel, every soul 
baptized into the Church, has the right 
to the guidance of that Spirit. And I 
will say for this congregation, that 
during our conference that Holy Spirit 
has rested down upon our souls and 
borne witness to the truth of the 
things we have heard, and we feel in 
our hearts thankful to God that we 
have a man to stand at the head of 
the Church who is imbued with the 
spirit of his office and calling, who has 
power with God and power with man, 
and in whom we can repose the utmost 
confidence. There is no need for me to 
dwell further on that point. 

My soul is full of rejoicing; not ray 
spirit merely, but my whole soul is 
imbued with the spirit of this work. 
I love it with all my heart. I have 
done so from my boyhood. I desire to 
spend the rest of my days, as in the 
past, in the service of this Church. T 
know it is true. I know it has come 
from God. I know it will prevail, and 
the opposition that may come against 
it will only accelerate its progress. 
It will bind and knit the Saints of God 
together as one. The power and bless- 
ing of the Lord will be upon us, if we 
will pursue the right course. Let us 
remember that we are the children of 
God, in body as well as in spirit; that 
God expects usi to preserve ourselves 
in purity of life and holiness of charac- 
ter and conduct; that we will put away 
from us as fast as we can the weak- 
nesses and frailties that we have inher- 
ited from our ancestors, and every- 
thing contrary to His mind and will; 
that we will dwell together in love, that 
we will serve Him with our might, 
mind and strength, and love our neigh- 
bora as ourselves, and pursue the 
course that He marks out, whether in 
temporal or in spiritual things; for 
they arel all spiritual with Him. As 
for me, I will endeavor with all my 
might to serve the Lord, and help 
others to do so, if I can. I feel full of 
love and confidence and kindness to- 
wards my brethren and sisters. I know 
these Latter-day Saints are a good 
people. I know they want to serve the 
Lord and abide in the covenant where- 



with God has made them free. And 
God will bless you, my brethren and 
sisters, in your basket and in your 
store, in your homes, in your fields and 
farms. Your flocks and herds will in- 
crease, your substance will increase, 
and God will bless you in the payment 
of your tithes and your offerings, 
which are voluntary and a free will 
offering, as your receipts show; and 
when they are made they are under 
the direction of the authorities of the 
Church, and the responsible person is 
the Trustee-in-Trust, whom God has 
appointed and whom you have sus- 
tained. 

Now, may the peace and blessing of 
God, which passeth all understanding, 
rest down upon you. May we be true 
and faithful in all things. May we 
serve the Lord with our bodies and our 
spirits, which are His. And may we 
endure and overcome and be prepared 
for the great day when the veil of the 
covering shall be taken away and we 
will see our Savior and our Father in 
heaven, and recognize them again, al- 
though we have for some time been 
from their presence. And the Lord 
will glorify the earth, and purify it. 
and purge out all that is evil by fire, 
and make a new heaven and a new 
earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness. 
But the temporal and the spiritual will 
be joined together, and they will be so 
eternally. Then we will receive a ful- 
ness of joy, and be crowned at His 
right hand with all things that have 
been promised unto us, and many 
things that we have never heard of 
and that we cannot conceive of. God 
help us to be worthy of these blessings, 
through Jesus Christ. Amen. 

President Smith, in announcing the 
closing hymn, said: 

"It is proposed that this is the end of 
one of the best conferences ever held in 
the Church, so far as we have any rec- 
ord, and that it now be adjourned for 
six months." He called for a vote, 
which was eagerly and enthusiastically 
given by the thousands composing the 
congregation. 

The choir sang the hymn, "Peace, 
be still."

The Ogden Tabernacle choir sang "O, 
Italia," Elder James E. Talmage then 
spoke as follows on 

THEOLOGY AND RELIGION. 

The topic just announced appears in 
the published list of prescribed subjects 
on which papers are to be prepared for 
presentation at the appointed district 
conventions of Sunday school workers. 
Already many questions and general 
inquiries have come up in connection 
with the listing of this subject, and it 
may be the consideration of this fact 
that has caused the committee in 
charge to give place on the program for 
this brief comment. 

The terms "theology" and "religion" 
are admittedly used in varied applica- 
tions and with meaning ranging from 
that of synonyms to that of complete 
contrast and difference. 

By derivation, "theology" is the name 
of a science — the science dealing with 
man's knowledge of God and necessari- 
ly comprising consideration of the re- 
lationship existing between God and 
His offspring — man. 

In this connection let it be remem- 
bered that the term "science" is not in- 
frequently misapplied. It does not mean 
mere knowledge; discriminated facts 
though bearing on the same subject, 
and perhaps each of great importance, 
do not constitute a science. By way 
of illustration: The uncivilized Indian 
has much knowledge of the plants and 
animals with which his mode of life 
insures him a close acquaintance. He 
is able to tell you just where. the early 
flowers are most likely to be found; 
he knows the habitat and properties 
of his medicinal herbs; the haunts of 
the different kinds of birds, and the 
habits of the wild beasts. Yet he can- 
not be credited with skill as a bot- 
anist or zoologist. 

Take a further analogy: A house is 
more than a simple collection of build- 
ing stuff. Though stone and brick, 
wood, iron and glass, mortar and plas- 
ter, and all else required in the way of 
actual material were brought together 
and piled or stacked on the selected 
site, there yet would be no house. First, 
the ground must be prepared, then the 



foundation stones are to be set, each 
in its place, true to square and com- 
pass; the bricks are laid course on 
course, then the roof is placed on the 
supportiag walls, and other operations 
follow in their order. 

Demonstrated facts — the substance of 
knowledge— are the building blocks of 
which the particular science comprising 
them is constructed. A science there- 
fore implies a collated collection of 
facts — knowledge that is so classified 
and arranged as to show forth the re- 
lation of part to part and of all the 
parts to the whole. 

Theology, then, regarded as a sep- 
arate and distinct science, comprises 
our collated and classified knowledge 
as to "the being and attributes of God, 
His relations to us, the dispensations of 
His providence, His will in respect to 
our actions, and His purposes with re- 
spect to our end." 

Through the prevalent disregard of 
this relationship between facts and 
truths the power to see things in their 
proper perspective is weakened or lost; 
and the man of a single idea magnifies 
to distortion a fragment of a great 
truth, and darkens his vision to alL 
else. 

The acceptance of theological truths 
implies, of course, a belief that they are 
what they are claimed to be; but such 
belief may be little more than mental 
assent or acceptance, having to do 
therefore with the intellect rather than 
with the heart of man. 

Religion is the actual living in ac- 
cordance with the laws of God, whether 
those laws have been studied as theo- 
logical propositions or not. Religion 
is primarily based on faith and abiding 
trust in Deity, not on mere belief such 
as may spring from the intellect and 
be wholly lacking in the conviction of 
the heart. 

The jurist or the statesman may have 
given long and mature study to the 
science of the law; he may have become 
conversant with the codes of every na- 
tion, existing and ancient; he may be 
intellectually strong as an authority on 
intricacies of legal construction, an ac- 
cepted arbiter on difficult questions in, 
controversy, nevertheless he may be a 



78 



DESERET SUNDAY SCHOOL UNION. 



wanton, wilful violator of the very laws 
he helped to frame. It is not enough 
that he win triumph in polemic dis- 
cussion as to the philosophy of the laws 
against theft, licentiousness homi- 
cide, for in spite of such skill and abil- 
ity, he may yet be a robber, a liber- 
tine, a murderer. Indeed, I have not 
learned that lawyers and statesmen 
have won for themselves a distinctive 
position of supremacy among law-abid- 
ing citizens, nor am I convinced that 
only by conning the tomes of legal lore 
or by graduating from a law school, can 
I hope to live in accordance with the 
laws of my country. 

So, too, the objective study of the- 
ology, the investigation of theological 
principles by the effort of' the mind 
alone may fail to warm the heart with 
even the faintest glow of religious fer- 
vor, and may never enlighten the soul 
with the purifying, germ-destroying 
beams from the source divine. 

Satan himself has shown much craft 
as a theologian, and has established 
a reputation as an arch accuser. He 
quoted Scripture to the Christ in the 
hour of physical weakness following 
the long weeks of fasting in the wilder- 
ness, and sought by misapplication to 
cite argument and reason in his attempt 
to thwart the purposes of the Father. 

Religion, I repeat, is more than 
knowledge, though that knowledge be 
classified and codified, and annotated to 
perfection. Religion is the application 
of the laws of God in our lives, the 
living up to all we have learned as to 
our duty, and it entails the obligation 
to so live until right life is a part of 
our natures and calls not for rule and 
rote at every turn. The religious man, 
with the love of God in his soul, pursues 
his life of service and righteousness 
without stopping to ask by what rule 
or law each act is prescribed or for- 
bidden. 

Now a word as to the teaching of 
theology and the inculcation of the 
spirit of true religion in our Sunday 
school work. Remember that the pur- 
pose of the great causd we represent 
in this organization is to develop in 
every soul the testimony of eternal 
truth, and the spirit of true religion. 



Under that influence the subject-mat- 
ter of our theology may be investigat- 
ed to the fullest possible extent, for 
the application of every added truth 
will follow as the student advances. 
The subjects to be studied in a course 
in theology are of themselves sa- 
cked to the religiously-inclined, and 
will be treated with the sanctity they 
deserve. While plainly proper sub- 
jects for earnest, truth seeking investi- 
gation, the laws of God are not to be 
made topics of acrimonious debate and 
ill-Snspired discussion, in which the 
struggle is for triumph rather than 
truth. Let culture in theology and 
nurture in religion be given together. 
" Theology may develop strength, re- 
ligion insures health of soul. Consider 
the definition written by the inspira- 
tion of olden times: "Pure religion and 
undeflled before God and the Father is 
this, — to visit the fatherless and widows 
in their affliction, and to keep himself 
unspotted fi'om thef world]." (James 
.1:27). 

The religion professed by tire Latter- 
day Saints is distinctly practical. Our 
profession demands thai we be honest, 
true, chaste, benevolent, virtuous, and 
that we seek to do good to all; that we 
shall strive after all that is virtuous, 
lovely, of good report and praiseworthy. 

Among the questions that have al- 
ready risen from the presentation of 
this subject to Sunday school workers, 
is one upon which I am asked specifi- 
cally to speak. It is this: Is it not 
true that our religion does not differ 
materially from that of any other de- 
nomination, while our theology does? 
My personal answer to this direct 
question is simple and terse: No! such 
is not true. To me the religion taught 
by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints is essentially different from 
that professed by other sects, even the 
other sects that are called Christian. 
True, we in common with them recog- 
nize the uSual requirements as to the 
morals of life, and denounce immor- 
ality as wholly inconsistent with re- 
ligious profession, but morality is but a 
part of our religion, though as such a 



DESERET SUNDAY SCHOOL UNION. 



7!) 



part strict morality is essential and 
imperative. 

Our religion embraces more than the 
codified moral law as usually under- 
stood, it comprises right living accord- 
ing to the intuitions of righteousness 
inborn, and the added active, positive 
compliance with the revealed law of 
God. And by one of the most prom- 
inent declarations of our doctrine and 
practise we hold ourselves ready to re- 
ceive other revelations as to the will of 
God respecting us. "We claim that our 
Church is the only church on earth 
authorized to bear the title "The 
Church of Jesus Cnrist," that it is the 
sole repository of the holy Priesthood, 
and therfore the one Church through 
which the gifts and blessings of the 
Priesthood are manifested. 

But, the questioner may yet ask — is 
this not a distinction between our the- 
ology and the theologies of other so- 
called churches rather than a differ- 
ence between our religion and the re- 
ligions of other people? The difference 
is a vital one, both in theological sys- 
tem and religious practice. The man 
who accepts the distinction between 
this people and other sects as one of 
cold theologic law alone and not as 
one entering into his practise as a pro- 
fessed member of this Church is not 
imbued with the spirit of this latter-day 
gospel, the spirit of the new and ever- 
lasting covenant; and to him I would 
answer the question personally — there 
may not be much to distinguish your 
religion from that of others who pro- 
fess less. 

There is a dangerous tendency mani- 
fested by ' a few of our people to regard 
their religion less and less as a distinc- 
tive system, their Church as but one 
among many churches, and their re- 
sponsibilities as not different from 
those of people in no wise claiming to 
be children of the covenant. Tolera- 
tion of the beliefs of others is a car- 
dinal feature of our profession; we 
claim the rights of worship and re- 
ligious practise for ourselves, and ac- 
cord such to others freely and without 
discrimination. But however I may 
strive to secure religious freedom for 



myself and others, I cannot lose sight 
of the fact that to me my Church is the 
one and only Church offering- the bless- 
ings of the Priesthood of God and the 
promise of continued tuition and in- 
struction by increasing revelation of 
His truth. 

May the unhindered progress of our 
Sunday school work speedily develop 
such a system of instruction, both by 
precept and example, that the youth of 
Zion shall become learned in the law 
of the gospel and valiant in the prac- 
tise thereof the working out of goodly 
lives in the flesh, and to the securing 
of eternal lives in the celestial home.

THE SPIRIT IN SUNDAY SCHOOL 
WORK. 

By Assistant Superintendent J. M. 
Tanner. 

I am very much gratified to see so 
many present tonight. Brother Tal- 
mage has been asking you to consider 
the marked and important difference 
between religiojj and theology. The sub- 
ject assigned to me is akin to that 
upon which he has been discoursing; 
and one of the reasons for making this 
subject prominent is the fear that in 
the highly organized condition of our 
■Sabbath schools at the present time, 
our workers may misunderstand our 
purposes. We are now on the third 
year of the Outlines, which call for 
study, for technical consideration, and 
which require preparation at the hands 
of both teachers and students; and 
we may become very proficient in our 
knowledge of the scriptures, and yet it 
is possible that some may lose some 
of the purposes or results of the scrip- 
tural teachings in our Sabbath school 
by losing sight of the spirit of its cul- 
tivation. Then again, we have our 
prayer meetings at nine forty-five 
o'clock, and these are intended to create 
a spirit of devotion and worship in 
the hearts of the teachers before they 
begin the lessons of the morning. And 
yet these prayer meetings and these 



80 



DESERET SUNDAY SCHOOL UNION. 



Outlines may not result in the spiritual 
growth of our children as we would like 
to have them. And the question nat- 
urally arises, how shall we use them 
so as to promote the spiritual life that 
our children need, and plant in their 
hearts the love of God? 

There is danger even in the Outline 
studies. I think I may say that the 
general tendency of modern teaching 
is towards skepticism, even in the very 
subjects that are taught in the class 
rooms. And why? Because the atti- 
tude that the student takes is a criti- 
cal one. The process is analytical— he is 
dissecting the subject to find out its 
weak points, to bring up questions that 
may be discussed and give opportunity 
for controversy; and that method of 
treating secular subjects in the great 
institutions of learning the the world 
gives rise to skepticism, and I dare 
venture the /statement that a very 
small per cent of our young people in 
the land come from these institutions 
free from disbelief in divine things. 

Now, very much depends in our theo- 
logical studies upon the attitude that 
we take toward them. Anything that 
colors of controversy in our classes in 
the Sabbath school, anything that tends 
to argument has in it a tendency to 
destroy the spiritual life of the class, 
so we must be careful about the at- 
titude that we take toward the sub- 
jects that we are discusing. What at- 
titude should we asume? It should 
be one of admiration. We should see 
beauty and love and goodness in the 
things that we teach, and we should 
magnify these divine qualities before 
our students. You will pardon me if 
I call your attention to that great; 
teacher, who was so greatly loved by 
the students of this people, Brother 
Karl G. Maeser. His attitude in the 
school room was always one of admir- 
ation; even when he was teaching 
secular subjects he aimed to reach the 
feeling of the students. You know it 
was a favorite expression of his,' that 
no man could teach successfully, not 
even arithmetic, without the Spirit of 
God. Those who have studied any sub- 
ject under him will testify that he pos- 



sessed that peculiar quality of a teach- 
er, that he always reached the feelings 
in discussing the subject. There were 
pleasing sensations brought to the feel- 
ings of the students in whatever he 
taught. And whenever he taught his- 
tory, it was always a pleasure, be- 
cause he showed in the great charac- 
ters of history the purposes of Heaven 
in the history of the human race and 
the fulfilling of God's purposes. He al- 
ways made his students "feel good," 
and if we cultivate the feelings, we are 
cultivating the hearts — we are cultivat- 
ing the spirituality of man, and for 
that reason the spirit of admiration 
should always be cultivated by the 
teacher before his class. Indeed that 
is very important as an educational 
principle, because the teacher who is 
to be successful in the school room, 
must first create felings of admiration 
in the minds of the students toward all 
the subjects that are to be taught; 
and I have known young people to 
miss it very seriously in life because 
their attitude in the outset of their 
school career was a false one; it was 
a critical attitude; it was that analyti- 
cal attitude that is taken by scholars of 
the world, and results in the destruc- 
tion of faith. 

It may seem anomalous to you to 
state tonight that the ministers of the 
world have less religion, less spiritual- 
ity than the very congregations that 
they speak to. Why? Because these 
ministers go into schools of training. 
They commence by annalyzing the 
scriptures. They criticize the scrip- 
tures. We have an educated ministry 
that Has gone over to those who call 
themselves "the higher critics;" and 
the ministers of the world while 
they may be theologians in their 
sense of the term are not religionists. 
They have a very little of religion. Now 
can you imagine the results of religious 
teaching done by men who have evi- 
dently far less religion, far less spirit- 
uality, far less love of God and devo- 
tion to Him and His cause in their 
hearts that the people whom they are 
addressing — than their congregations? 

If you were to take the trouble to 
study the decline of religion among 



DESEKET SUNDAY SCHOOL UNION. 



81 



the people of the world, you would 
find that it always went hand in hand 
with education, and the consequent 
critical attitude of the religious teach- 
ers of the age. We must not take this 
wrong attitude. No, we want to culti- 
vate the art. We want our young peo- 
ple to love the truth; we w-ant them to 
feel that they are in the presence of their 
Heavenly Father by day and by night. 
There is an old German adage that 
says, "When two men say the same 
thing, it is not the same thing." If 
you have heard some of the recent 
discussions about the religion of Budd- 
ha, and Zoroaster and Bramah, you 
have noticed that they have produced 
sayings that are almost equal with the 
sayings pf our Master; and yet those 
things were said hundreds and thou- 
sands of| years before Jesus is reported 
to have said them. But the value of 
what out Master said does not depend 
upon its beauty, upon its poetic form, 
upon its force, but upon the authority 
that stands behind it — the authority 
of truth, the authority of the purity 
and righteousness of His life. 

And so, when our -teachers enter 
the schoolroom they are authorities; 
and religion, if it is ever to become 
successful and reach the hearts of the 
children of men, must be a religion of 
authority. Not only that men hold the 
priesthood, not alone that they have 
been called of God, but behind them is 
an authority of righteousness, of truth, 
of integrity; and so our teachers must 
bear in mind that they should culti- 
vate that spiritual life that comes from 
the highest degree of integrity. There 
are places in the scripture that afford 
us warning, that show us the results of 
sin and error; but in our study the 
great value of the scriptures will be 
found in the admiration that they 
create in the hearts of our children for 
the nobJe characters that lived in an- 
cient days. 

Now, I want to say another thing, 
and that is in regard to the attitude 
that our young people should take and 
the feelings that should be cultivated 
within them respecting the leaders of 
the Church in this dispensation — the 



feeling of admiration. It makes all 
the difference in the world to the faith 
and the spiritual life of the boy what 
his attitude is toward his bishop, to- 
ward the president of his stake, his at- 
titude toward the President of the 
Church, and those other leading char- 
acters whose lives are familiar to our 
young people. If our youth are taught 
to admire them, to love them, to have 
confidence in them, their religious life 
will be sweeter and purer and their 
spiritual life will be all the better as 
a consequence. 

So I implore you, fathers and moth- 
ers, let not the spirit of criticism enter 
your homes. Never permit yourselves 
to criticise your brethren in the pres- 
ence of your children. You can tell a 
child that comes into the schoolroom 
if he comes with a critical attitude, es- 
pecially if he has a critical attitude to 
the teacher. Children with this spirit 
show it. They never make great prog- 
ress in study. Children have a right to 
confidence and they should have en- 
couraged within them the most per- 
fect confidence, because love cannot 
exist without confidence. You may 
criticise, you may think you have de- 
tected some weakness, you may find 
fault, but, when you do so, you de- 
stroy confidence and you can never 
have love where there is no confidence. 
There must be perfect confidence, of the 
teacher in the child as well as of the 
pupils in the teacher, and in the au- 
thorities of the Church. Now I hope 
that you will not think that these 
Outlines are to afford you opportuni- 
ties for excellent discussion, I hope 
you will not think that you cani get up 
some good arguments to present knotty 
questions that are difficult to solve, be- 
cause such discussions not only waste 
time, but they do that which is infinite- 
ly worse, they create a critical attitude 
in the mind of the child; and when that 
feeling of criticism is encouraged in 
the child, it is difficult in after life to 
overcome it. We can hear criticisms 
in our older years and throw them aside 
very much easier than we can throw 
the criticisms aside that we heard in 
our youth; and so I say that it is one 



S-2 



DESERET SUNDAY SCHOOL UNION. 



of the sacred rights of childhood to 
enjoy confidence to enjoy love; 
and we should refrain scrupu- 
lously from ever doing or saying 
anything that will destroy the confi- 
dence of our youth in humanity in their 
brethren and sisters, in the presiding 
authority. They will find in later years 
enough to criticise. I remember once in 
the law school listening to one of the 
great lawyers of this country. He 
said that often the boy in 
the schoolroom who was the 
most competent in discussing 
subjects of law made the poorest lawyer 
in after life; because he who is to be 
the great lawyer is the lawyer that sees 
in the law equity and justice; it is the 
•lawyer whose feelings are strengthened 
and deepened by his knowledge of the 
law. And so in our schools let us edu- 
cate the feelings of our children. And 
I want to say this: here are two teach- 
ers coming before the class; one teach- 
er will send his students away with a 
considerable' fund of information; the 
other teacher may not -give so much 
infomiatioin, will not have imparted 
so many facts, but will send the ehil- 
-dren away feeling good. "What: did 
he tell yo«u?" "Well, I do not know 
particularly, only 1 know that it made 
•me feel nice, it made me feel happy." 
Now then with what feeUsgs do you 
send your children out of the Sabbath 
School? Are they sweet feelings? Do 
you appeal to the -feelings of your chil- 
dren, for- in the feelings are, to be 
found the religious life of man and they 
should be scrupulously and carefully 
cultivated. But you must have that 
which you give; theremust be a back- 
gBOsUtBd to your teachings, the back- 
ground of purity, of integrity, of devo- 
tion, of love -and you should have happy 
and cheerful natures and impart the 
quality of happiness and love to the 
children with whom you are associated. 
In this way our children will learn to 
love the work, they will learn to- admire 
it, and so when they leave the school- 
room and go out into life they go out 
men and women full of confidence and 
consequently of faith and Jove. And 
when we see in our fellows, in our stu- 
dents, a tendency towards criticism, 



we may always be certain that it is 
not a religious tendency, because it will 
destroy their religious life. 

Bear your testimony to your children, 
let them know what you know, let 
them feel what you feel, let them en- 
joy the assurances that you have that 
this work is the work of God, that we 
have an especial calling that we are to 
do a particular work, that whatever 
else we may be doing the Lord has 
something for us to do; that is dis- 
tinctly our mission and when our young 
people can feel that they are thus call- 
ed, that they are the salt of the earth, 
then they will realize more than ever 
the importance of their religion. 

One desire I have to express to you 
tonight, and that is that you teach' our 
children loyalty, loyalty to this people, 
loyalty to the Church. Create the spirit 
of loyalty within them, because loyalty 
is love. Create a spirit Of loyalty to 
the servants of God, and do not let 
many Sabbaths go by without holding 
up the examples in modern Israel. 

God bless our leader «who preside* 
over the Sabbath Schools of Zion. May 
he live long in the enjoyment, of health 
and may his spirit extend to. -all the 
workers in the Sabbath School. I have 
been testifying about Brother Maeser. 
Brother Maeser is dead and I wnt to 
testify about the living. Whenever our 
General Superintendent talks to us it 
makes us feel good, does it iicft? Does 
he ever talk to you when you do not 
feel good, when it does not make you 
happy, when it does notcueate within 
you assurances and fortify you with the 
determination to do better? Aye, that 
is it; it is the man that can speak most 
to our feelings, in our religious life that 
has most to cdo with our spirituality. 
And I take this pleasure in. adding this 
testimony of the living, to that which 
we bear concerning the dead. 

God bless you all: I ask it in the 
name of Jesus. Amen. 

Singing by the Ogden Tabernacle 
choir, "O Lord, in Thee do I put my 
trust." 

ELDER JOSEPH W. SUMMERHAYS. 

The question I have been asked to 
answer is: "Is it a requirement from 



DBSERET SUNDAY SCHOOL UNION.

the general board or from the Church 
that all ladies remove their hats in 
Sunday schools?" 

The position of the Church upon this 
matter I am not prepared to state, but 
it is not a requirement of the Sunday 
school board; but it is a recommenda- 
tion of that board. The board recom- 
mends that in Sunday school the ladies 
remove their hats. But, in this con- 
nection, we wish to say to the brethren 
of the superintendencies, that you 
should adopt some means of taking- 
care of the hats of the little ladies, so 
that when they remove them from then- 
heads they are not compelled to retain 
them in their hands, which induces a 
temptation to twist them all out of 
shape and destroy them. They are too 
hard to get; that is, I find it so. But 
we do recommend where that is possi- 
ble, that the sisters in Sunday school 
remove their hats and keep them oft 
until after the benediction, as we trust 
you. will tonight. 

Religion and Theology — Some of the 
Fruits of the Spirit. 

PRESIDENT JOSEPH P. SMITH. 

I shall not attempt, particularly, to 
dwell upon any subject. I shall per- 
haps make but a few remarks. 

I desire to say a word or two in praise 
and commendation of the Ogden Taber- 
nacle choir. In looking at the faces, es- 
pecially of the brethren, I find that the 
choir is largely composed of young men, 
of youths; and this has made an im- 
pression upon my mind which is highly 
commendable to the people of Ogden 
and to the Ogden Tabernacle choir. I 
wish I could say as much for the Salt 
Lake Tabernacle choir, although we 
have a number of young men connected 
with the Tabernacle choir; yet we have 
a very heavy sprinkling of the good old 
fathers and stand-bys who have been 
associated with it almost from time 
immemorable. I am glad to see them 
there, but I would . like to see a greater 
interest manifested in the art of singing 
by our young men, and I am glad to 
see the example that is set before us 
thiss evening in the choir from Ogden. 
I have not looked at the ladies so much. 



I am naturally a little timid about look- 
ing at the ladies, but I notice that there 
is a large number of them tnat are also 
quite young, and I am proud of it, and 
I am proud to say that I discover that I 
have a few kinswomen myself in the 
choir from Ogden. I recollect on one 
occasion attending a conference, and 
we had a nice choir, in fact, I think 
about one of the nicest choirs I ever 
did see, because they were all ladies 
except one. There was one middle- 
aged man connected with the choir, who 
was present during a portion of the 
conference, but he wasn't there all the 
time. And the choir was led by a lady, 
and the singing was all done by the 
sisters, and it was very beautiful, very 
delightful and enjoyable indeed. But 1 
happened to inquire why it was that we 
did not have some of the young men 
in the choir, and I was informed that 
the young men of the community 
thought it beneath their dignity to sing, 
and it reminded me of a saying of Dr. 
Talmage (not our Dr. Talmage, but 
the wonderful Dr. Talmage of New 
York)— a particular friend of the "Mor- 
mon" people, you know. (Laughter.) 
The gentleman who was going to herd 
all the "Mormon" people in to the 
Tabernacle and Temple and then open 
the guns of Port Douglas and put an 
end to them. Nevertheless, he said one 
good thing while he was lecturing here 
in the Theater. He said something like 
this, that a man that could sing and 
wouldn't sing ought to go to Sing Sing, 
and I always remembered it. And I 
am greatly pleased to see our young 
people taking an interest in choir sing- 
ing, and I congratulate Brother Ballan- 
tyne in having the beautiful voices that 
he has to assist him in his choir. Cer- 
tainly not only the citizens of Ogden 
have occasion to be proud of the Ogden 
Tabernacle choir, but all the Latter-day 
Saints have; and I need not repeat here 
what I have said many times before, 
that all Israel have reason to be proud 
of the Salt Lakfe Tabternacle choir. 
And then there are a great many more 
choirs among the Latter-day Saints 
who deserve the praise and the' pride of 
the Latter-day Saints. 
I am sorry to be under the necessity

of expressing my deep regrets at the 
departure from among us, since the last 
meeting of this conference six months 
ago, of one of our most faithful, ener~ 
getic and intelligent laborers in the 
Sunday school cause. We have been 
called upon to part with one of our best 
men, one of our truest men, a man in 
whom all men could place confidence 
and have no fear that they would ever 
be deceived or feel that they had mis- 
placed their confidence. It is but 
recently that we have carried to his 
last resting place our beloved brother, 
Leonard John Nuttall, who was one of 
the most faithful workers in the Sab- 
bath school. I sincerely hope that we 
shall not be called upon to part with 
any others that are still here among 
us until we shall have the pleasure of 
meeting again in this building six 
months hence. 

The attendance at this conference and 
the attendance at this meeting is phe- 
nomenal. I do not remember ever be- 
fore seeing so many people together on 
an occasion like this. The body of the 
hall is almost filled, besides the great 
numbers in the gallery. 

I sincerely hope that the instructions 
that have been given us by Dr. Tal- 
ntage and by Brother Joseph M. Tan- 
ner, will sink deep into our hearts, and 
that we may be able to draw the dis- 
tinctions that have been so clearly de- 
fined by these able speakers, that we 
may understand the difference, the real 
difference, between true religion and 
undefiled before God, the Father, which 
is "to visit the fatherless and the 
widow in their affliction and to keep 
oneself unspotted from the world" and 
the theology of the world; theology, 
speaking of it in words used by the 
learned divines of the present day, in 
which they profess their faith in that 
which they call energy, and call it God. 
Now, surprising as this may be to you, 
and surprising as it was to me to learn 
this fact, I had an opportunity of sit- 
ting in the tabernacle of Henry Ward 
Beecher in Brooklyn — since his death — 
and listening to the Rev. Lyman Ab- 
bott deliver one of the most eloquent 
discourses I ever listened to, eloquent 



in words, eloquent in figure, and very 
beautiful in expression; and the sum- 
ming up of the whole discourse was, 
that the thing that he worshiped and 
the thing that he called God was noth- 
ing more and nothing less than energy. 
Now that may be theology, but it is 
not true religion. It is false religion, 
if you can call it religion at all. Then 
the difference between the practical re- 
ligion of Jesus Christ, based upon the 
doctrine, "Whosoever heareth these 
words of mine and doeth them, I will 
liken him unto a man who built his 
house upon a rock, and when the 
storms descended and the winds blew 
and beat upon the house it fell not, 
for it was founded upon a rock." This 
is true religon, and it is very different 
indeed from the religion of the people 
of the world, who worship the Lord 
only knows what, for they themselves 
do not know. The fact of the matter 
is, they have confessed it as a part 
of their religious belief, that to know 
God would be to destroy God. God, in 
order to be God, must be incomprehen- 
sible to man, and therefore the moment 
that a man could comprehend Deity, 
He would cease to be God. I read 
that many years ago as being the 
thought of some very learned theolo- 
gians. And yet it is said in the scrip- 
tures, "To know Thee, the only true and 
living God and Jesus Christ whom Thou 
hast sent, is life eternal." And if we 
can only attain life eternal by knowing 
and understanding the only true and 
living God and Jesus Christ whom He 
hath sent into the world, we must not 
worship energy. Neither must we come 
to the conclusion to rest on the idea 
that God is something incomprehensi- 
ble, not describable, something that fills 
the immensity of space, without form 
or fashion, and yet so small that He 
can dance a jig on the point of a cam- 
bric needle. Now that may be theology, 
but it is not reliigon. 

Just a word or two in relation to our 
children and to their training at home, 
as also the training that they should 
receive carefully in the Sabbath schools. 

Parents, in the first place, whether 
.they do it or not, should love and re- 



DESERET SUNDAY SCHOOL UNION.

aspect each other, and treat each other 
-with respectful decorum and kindly 
regard all the time. The husband 
should treat his wife with the utmost 
courtesy and respect. The husband 
should never insult her, he should never 
speak slightingly of her, but should al- 
ways hold her in highest esteem in- the 
home, in the presence of their chil- 
dren. We do not always do it, per- 
haps; some of us, perhaps, do not do it 
at all. But nevertheless it is true 
that we ought to do it. The wife, also 
should treat the husband with the 
greatest respect and courtesy. Her 
words to him should not be keen and 
cutting and sarcastic. She should not 
cast slurs or insinuations at him. She 
should not nag him. She should not try 
to arouse his anger or to make things 
unpleasant about the home. The wife 
should be a joy to her husband; and 
she should live and conduct herself at 
home so that the home will be the most 
joyous, the most blessed place on earth 
to her husband. This should be the 
condition of the husband and the wife, 
the father and the mother within 
the sacred precincts of that holy 
place, the home. Then it will be 
easy for the parents to instil into the 
hearts of their little children, oiot only 
love for their fathers and their mothers, 
not only respect and courtesy toward 
their parents, but love and courtesy 
and deference between the children at 
home. The little brothers will respect 
their little sisters. The little boys will 
respect one another. The little girls 
will respect each other, and the girls 
and boys will respect each other, and 
treat each other with that love, that 
deference and respect that should be 
observed in the home on the part of the 
little children. Then it will be easy 
for the Sunday School teacher to con- 
tinue the training of the child under the 
hallowed influence of the Sabbath 
school; and the child will be tractable 
and easily led, because the foundation 
of a correct education has been laid 
in the heart and mind of the child at 
home. The teacher can then help the 
little children brought up under these 
proper influences, to render respect and 



courtesy to all men and especially to 
the unfortunate, the aged and the in- 
firm. If we could only bring up our 
children in this way at home, and this 
home influence be extended in the 
Sabbath schools as well as in the day 
schools, it would not be long before 
children would meet a cripple in the 
street with reverence and pity. They 
would express the very picture of sym- 
pathy In their faces, and their souls full 
of love and sympathy would go out 
for the unfortunate. How is it to- 
day? Too often it is the case that we 
see a poor half-demented person, the 
poor cripple, the aged and infirm, per- 
haps the ill-clad and uncanny pass- 
ing along and the boys in the street are 
abusing them, throwing snow balls at 
them, perchance throwing stones at 
them, and doing anything in their pow- 
er to annoy and make their miserable 
lives still more miserable; and this be- 
cause of the want of respect, of sym- 
pathy and love that they should feel 
for the unfortunate. 

We have too much of such conduct 
amongst us; there is too much of it in 
the world, and there is too little train- 
ing of children toward respecting all 
men. 

I believe in the example that was set 
by the illustrious father of our country. 
On one occasion, it is told of him, as ho 
was passing along with some of his 
aides, dressed in his uniform as gen- 
eral of the armies of the United States, 
that he met a colored man. The col- 
ored man, most reverently and courte- 
ously took off his hat and made a low 
bow to the general. The general took 
off his hat and bowed as courteously to 
the colored man. His associate generals 
.'remonstrated with him. They said, 
"General, it is beneath your dignity to 
bow to a negro." General Washington 
turned to them and said, "Gentlemen, I 
cannot afford to have a negro outdo 
me in courtesy." So it would be well 
for us as Latter-day Saints, and as the 
children of the Latter-day Saints, and 
as the teachers of the children of this 
people, to teach courtesy and respect 
toward all mankind, and implant kind- 
ness in the hearts of our children to- 



so

wards the unfortunate especially. There 
is too little of it. I go along the street 
here and I see little boys with 
cigarettes in their mouths; I actually 
see young men, just budding into man- 
hood with nasty stinking old pipes in 
their mouths, or with cigars between 
their teeth, as they walk along the 
streets. I see boys walk with beautiful 
young ladies on the sidewalks, smoking 
their cigars. I think it is contemptible 
to see boys with cigarettes and pipes and 
cigars in their mouths, puffing their in- 
famous smudge into the faces of beau- 
tiful women. It is abominable. And 
when I see a man, a boy especially, 
with a cigar or a pipe in his mouth— 
the pipe is the worse, it stinks worse 
and it is. more poisonous, a great deal, 
than the cigar is, although I have never 
tried either of them very much; but 
when I meet a. youth with these at- 
tachments, I feel that if I could be jus- 
tified under any circumstances in pass- 
ing anyone by with contempt, they are 
the fellows that I would pass with con- 
tempt. I never like to bow or take off 
my hat to a boy or a young man with 
a cigar or a cigarette in his mouth. I 
don't like to bow to a cigarette. I don't 
like to bow and pay deference to a nas- 
ty old stinking tobacco pipe. 1 thin is 
that is more condescending by far than 
to bow to a courteous gentlemanly man 
who is unfortunate enough to be col- 
ored with a black skin. I have seen 
many polished gentlemen in my life who 
have been unfortunate enough not to tt 
white, that is in their skin; but in their 
hearts and in their manners, in their 
courtesy and conduct, they were far 
superior to many of their boasting 
white brothers. 

Teach your children not to smoke. 
Persuade them not to do it. Watch 
and look after them, and try to teach 
them better, and to be courteous ana 
kind. 

May the Lord bless you, my brethren 
and sisters, in your most important du- 
ties as teachers in the Sabbath Schools 



of the youth of Zion. May the Lord 
guide you by His Spirit. Remember 
this, that the great difference between 
the theology that we have been hearing 
of and true religion is this, that the 
fruits of the Spirit of God— the fruits 
of the spirit of true religion — are peace 
and love, virtue and honesty, and in- 
tegrity, and fidelity to every virtue 
known in the law of God, while the 
spirit of the world is vicious. Read the 
fifth chapter of Galatians, and ther« 
you will discover the difference between 
the fruits of the Spirit of God and the 
fruits of the spirit of the world. That 
is one of the great and chief differences 
between "Mormonism," so called, ana 
the theology of the world. If "Mormon- 
ism" is anything at all more than other 
religions, it is that it is practical, that 
the results of obedience to it are prac- 
tical, that it makes good men better men, 
and that it takes even bad men and 
makes good ones of them. That is what 
"Mormonism" will do, if we will oni.v 
permit it; to do it, if we will bow to its 
mandates and adopt its precepts in our 
lives it will make us the sons and the 
daughters of God, worthy eventually, to 
dwell in the presence of the Almighty in 
the heavens. God bless us and help us 
to become so ; worthy, is my prayer, in 
the name of Jesus. Amen. 

President Smith then added, "It ts 
moved and seconded that we offer a 
sincere and hearty vote of thanks to 
Brother Joseph Ballantyne and the Og- 
den choir for the pleasure of their visit 
amongst us, and for the enjoyment 
they have given us tonight in their 
beautiful singing." The motion was 
carried unanimously. 

Conference concluded by the Ogden 
Tabernacle choir singing "Closing Chor- 
us," and benediction by President 
Francis M. Lyman.

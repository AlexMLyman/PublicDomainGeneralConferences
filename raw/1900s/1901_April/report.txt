OF LATTER-DAY SAINTS. 



FIRST DAY. 



The Seventy-first Annual Conference 
of the Church of Jesus Christ of Lat- 
ter-day Saints convened in the Taber- 
nacle, Salt Lake City, on Friday, April 
5, at 10 a. m., President Lorenzo Snow 
presiding.

(President George Q. Cannon was ab- 
sent on account of severe illness,) of 
the quorum of the Twelve Apostles— 
Brigham Young, Francis M. Lyman,

Smith; of the First Seven Presidents of 
Seventies — Seymour B. Toung, George 
Reynolds, Brigham H. Roberts, Jona- 
than G. Kimball, Rulon S. Wells and

The services opened by the choir and 
congregation singing the hymn which 
begins: 

"Come let us anew, our journey pur- 
sue." 

Opening prayer was offered by Elder 
John Nicholson. 

"All hail the glorious day, 
By prophets long foretold." 

Was sung by the choir. 



PRESIDENT LORENZO SNOW. 

OPENING ADDnlSS. 

Prosperity due to the blessings of God— Our lives 
immortal and progressive — Glorious future 
prospects— Pu> pose of our earthly existence — 
Reluctance of the world to receive the truth— 
Exhoitation to faithfulness. 

My brethren and sisters and friends, 
through the assistance of your pray- 
ers and the exercise of your faith, we 
expect that the Lord will bestow upon 
us His choice blessings during this 
conference. This work in which you 
and I are engaged can only prosper 
and be forwarded through the blessings 
of God upon our faithful and honest 
exertions and our determination to ac- 
complish the labors for which we have 
come into this existence. When we look 
back upon the experiences through 
which we have passed, we easily un- 
derstand that our prosperity has been 
dependent upon our honest endeavors 
to accomplish the work of God, to la- 
bor in the interest of the people, and 
to rid ourselves as far as possible of 
selfishness. This having been so in the 
past, we can well believe that our fu- 
ture progress will depend upon our de- 
termination to do the will of God under 
all circumstances and the aid which 
He shall give to us. 

You will have the privilege of hearing 
quite a number of speeches during this 
conference from the brethren sitting 
upon the stand, and perhaps from oth- 
ers; and you having come here, no 
doubt, for the purpose of receiving

something that will reward you for the 
sacrifice which some of you may have 
made in coming, I hope that you will 
be well repaid for all the inconveni- 
ences which you may have suffered in 
coming to this conference. 

There are many things worthy of our 
consideration as we move along in the 
pathway to exaltation and glory. There 
are some points we may think about 
that are of superior consequence. In 
considering ourselves and how we have 
been organized and what we are doing, 
we discover that there is immortality 
connected with us. We are immortal be- 
ings. That which dwells in this body of 
ours is immortal, and will always exist. 
Our individuality will always continue. 
Eternities may begin, eternities may 
end, and still we shall have our individ- 
uality. Our identity is insured. We 
will be ourselves, and nobody else. 
Whatever changes may arise, whatever 
worlds may be made or pass away, our 
identity will always remain the same; 
and we will continue on improving, ad- 
vancing and increasing in wisdom, in- 
telligence, power and dominion, worlds 
without end. Our present advancement 
is simply a starting out, as it were, on 
this path of immortality. Whatever 
may have been our past, how long we 
may have existed before this, or wheth- 
er there ever was a time when we did 
not exist, there is one thing sure— our 
being in the future will never be anni- 
hilated, never destroyed. When we look 
upon the beauties of the world many 
things that we see and experience are of 
a grand and glorious nature; they fill 
us with reverence; we feel and realize 
their grandeur; and the idea that the 
time will ever come when we will cease 
to have these experiences would cer- 
tainly produce a feeling of sadness in 
our hearts. But there is no such thing 
a s our passing out of existence. 

I feel thankful that the Lord has re- 
vealed unto us the glorious prospects 
which are before us. The Savior once 
compared the kingdom of God to a man 
■who found a rich treasure in a field, and 
he went and sold all that he possessed 
to secure that treasure; and again, like 
a man seeking valuable pearls, and 
finding one of immense value he went 
and sold all that he had to secure that 
pearl. 



Now, the Lord having manifested to 
the Latter-day Saints this principle oj: 
immortality and continuance of ad- 
vancement, in the past they have shown 
most clearly and fully that they have 
been willing to sacrifice whatever 
they might possess and to go 
through the most undesirable 
experiences rather than turn aside from 
the path of exaltation and glory and 
give up the hopes God had inspired 
within them. Having had these grand 
and glorious prospects, which no lan- 
guage can express, unfolded to our view, 
we ought to be the best, the most vir- 
tuous and the most self-sacrificing peo- 
ple on the face of the globe. And we 
certainly are. If it were not for these 
hopes which the Lord Almighty has 
inspired us with, if it were not for the 
revelations of the Lord Jesus in re- 
gard to our future, we would be the 
most unhappy people in the world; all 
our past sacrifices, all that we have en- 
dured, would go as for nothing. The 
Savior might well compare the kingdom 
of God to a man that had discovered 
something for which he was willing to 
make great sacrfice. 

We are in the world for a purpose. 
We are not here accidentally. We came 
here because we were willing to come, 
and because it was the wish of our 
Father in heaven that we should come. 

We undoubtedly saw very clearly 
that there was no other way for us to 
secure what the Father had in store for 
us. We send missionaries among the 
children of men. When appointed they 
feel strangely. Their feelings are not 
always the most pleasurable, either. 
There are things about a mission 
which are not altogether agreeable to 
our young Elders. They realize that they 
have to sacrifice the pleasures of home, 
and they understand that they are go- 
ing among people who will not always 
feel gratified at what they have to say 
to them; yet, on the other hand, they 
feel that they have the seeds of life in 
their possession.and that if they can 
find an honest man or woman, the 
Spirit of the Lord will operate upon 
their hearts and they will perchance re- 
ceive this glorious message which they 
have to deliver. This affords them 
pleasure and satisfaction. Another 
thing, they see in this experience a

chance for them to secure that which 
will be of great value to them in their 
future duties. It is a strange thing 
that among the thousands of letters 
which I have received from those who 
have been called to go upon missions 
— mostly young men — I do not think of 
but one case where a refusal was given. 
Why is this? It is because the spirit of 
love and of immortality, the Spirit of 
the Almighty, is upon these young El- 
ders, and they have received manifes- 
tations which inspire them to do that 
which otherwise no inducement could 
prompt them to do. 

We are but a few people compared 
with the multitudes that dwell upon the 
face of the earth; and our system of 
thought is not believed in by many. 
When we go out into the world and 
testify of the kingdom of God, and that 
the fulness of the Gospel has been in- 
troduced for the purpose of saving 
mankind, there are but few who will 
receive the testimony. It has always 
been so, strange to say. In the days 
of Noah very few indeed received the 
truth which God revealed. In the days 
of the Son of God very few would re- 
ceive His testimony. In these days very 
few receive the testimony that God has 
revealed His Gospel and has required 
His servants to declare it to the world. 
It is strange indeed — and yet perhaps 
not so strange, when we consider the 
circumstances. When Jesus lay in the 
manger, a helpless infant. He knew 
not that He was the Son of God, and 
that formerly He created the earth. 
When the edict of Herod was issued, He 
knew nothing of it; He had not power 
to save Himself; and His father and 
mother had to take Him and fly into 
Egypt to preserve Him from the effects 
of that edict. Well, He grew up to man- 
hood, and during His progress it was re- 
vealed unto Him who He was, and for 
what purpose He was in the world. The 
glory and power He possessed before 
He came into the world was made 
known unto Him. It was not a very 
pleasurable thing to be placed upon the 
cross and to suffer the excruciating 
torture that He bore for hours, in or- 
der to accomplish the work for which 
He had come upon the earth. It has 
not been with the Latter-day Saints 
the most delightful thing that could be 



imagined to suffer as they have suf- 
fered — and what for? For the same as 
Jesus suffered, to a certain extent — 
for the salvation of the world. And 
although in this life very many of them 
may not receive that which we offer 
to them, the day will come, through 
the progress of things in eternity, when 
they will receive it, and they will be 
thankful that we came into the world 
and suffered in their interests as we 
have. 

What shall we say about these mat- 
ters, brethren and sisters? This: Do 
not falter; continue to do your duty, 
whatever it may be, whether pleasing 
or displeasing; be the servants and 
handmaidens of God to the very ut- 
most. In the past his blessings have 
been upon us just so far as we have 
served Him in faithfulness; they will 
be so in the future. There is no occa- 
sion for any man who has the manifes- 
tation of the Lord in this line to be 
discouraged. When our surroundings 
are not so agreeable as might be 
wished, think how much worse they 
might be. Be contented with our con- 
ditions. Improve them when oppor- 
tunity arises, but do not worry about 
them. If we are poor, and have not as 
much as our neighbor possesses, do not 
envy him, and do not worry about it. 
As I said in the beginning of my re- 
marks, there is an eternity before us, 
and we shall always be ourselves, and 
nobody else, and what we do not gain 
today we will gain tomorrow, or some 
other time. The antediluvians rejected 
the word of God; but they were the 
sons and daughters of God, and He did 
not reject them, only for a time. Af- 
ter twenty-five hundred years had 
passed away the Lord revealed himself 
to them again and gave them another 
opportunity. Then they no doubt ac- 
cepted, generally if not altogether, 
that which they refused in the days of 
Noah. The people of this generation 
may not receive our testimony here, 
but they will receive it at some future 
time, from us or from some other ser- 
vants of God. 

Brethren and sisters, God bless you; 
and I say to you, in the name of the 
Lord, if you will be faithful in your 
prayers and in the exercise of your

faith, this will be as other conferences 
have been, the very best — better than 
that which has preceded it; and we will 
all be abundantly blessed and filled 
with the Spirit of God, our faith will be 
increased, and we will be better pre- 
pared to endure what the Lord shall re- 
quire at our hands. God bless you. 
Amen. 

ELDER REED SMOOT. 

The course 1 1 pursue in cases of sickness — Organ- 
ization and ordinances of the Church being 
imitated— The Gospel to be carried to all 
lands. 

I can hardly realize, my brethren and 
sisters, that it is nearly one year since 
I was called to this stand and my name 
presented to the congregation to be sus- 
tained as one of the Apostles of the 
Lord Jesus Christ. I desire to say to 
you this day that 1 have enjoyed my 
labors among the people of this Church 
for the last twelve months as I never 
expected to do. I have at all times 
asked my Heavenly Father to give me 
His Spirit, to give me humility, and 
to favor me with the love, confidence, 
respect and fellowship of the Latter- 
day Saints; and I thank you my breth- 
ren and sisters, for yqur faith and 
prayers in my behalf, and I thank the 
Lord for all He has vouchsafed unto 
me. I begin to realize, at least in a 
small degree, \yhat it is to be a teacher 
among the Latter-day Saints, and the 
great responsibilities attached there- 
to; and I feel my weakness, aye, more 
than any of your realize, and I trust 
and pray that the Lord will give me 
wisdom and judgment, that the instruc- 
tion which I give to the people as an 
Apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ will be 
approved of Him, and that the people 
will receive them in the same spirit in 
which they are given. 

I know, my brethren and sisters, that 
this is the Church and Kingdom of God. 
I know that He can fit and qualify men 
for the offices to which He calls them. 
If they are humble, prayerful and dili- 
gent in seeking His Spirit, I know that 
God will magnify them in their office 
and calling. 

There is a tendency exhibited by 
some of the brethren and sisters 
in some of the Stakes of Zion to 
add to the form of our simple 



ordinances, and cast about them 
a degree of mystery and to depart from 
the method laid down by revelation 
from God through the Prophet Joseph 
Smith; and I think it proper to call the 
attention of the members of this Church 
to one of these deviations. 

The Apostle James, upon one 
occasion, asked the question, "Is 
any sick among you?" and his advice 
to the Saints then was: "Let him call 
for the Elders of the Church; and let 
them pray over him, anointing him 
with oil in the name of the Lord; and 
the prayer of faith shall save the sick, 
and the Lord shall raise him up." 

This doctrine is believed in by the 
Latter-day Saints. It is one of the 
beautiful ordinances in the Church of 
Jesus Christ in this dispensation. It is 
one whose benefits and blessings all 
the people enjoy who have the Spirit 
of God. And there is no need to deviate 
from the simple form of administering 
to the sick as laid down by the Apostle 
James and by the Prophets of this dis- 
pensation. There is, however, a ten- 
dency among some of the members of 
the Church in performing this ordinance 
to add to the form and mode as re- 
vealed, thinking that by so doing great- 
er power accompanies the administra- 
tion. But I want to call your attention 
to the fact that in the healing- of the 
sick in this Church the power comes 
■from the Lord, and not from man. It is 
by the prayer of faith that the sick 
are healed: and, as I look at it, there is 
no need of having this simple ordinance 
of administering to the sick enshrouded 
in mystery, or any addition whatever 
to the simple form given by the Apostle 
James or revealed to the Prophet Jo- 
seph Smith. 

Let me say also that every Latter-day 
Saint has a perfect right to ask the 
Bishop of their ward to present the 
name of any who are sick to the fast 
meeting which is held each month in 
every ward in the Church, where the 
people meet together in fasting and 
prayer. I believe that the faith and 
power which can be made manifest in 
those meetings in behalf of the sick 
will be acknowledged by God; and the 
people have a right to ask the Bishop 
of their ward to have a sick one prayed 
for in any fast meeting. 



ELDER REED SMOOT. 



In this connection I may say that we 
have prayer circles in this Church. 
Every Bishop has a right to have a 
prayer circle in his ward, and I sin- 
cerely hope that there is no 
Stake in Zion without one, 
and if there is, my advice is to organize 
one as soon as possible. There is not a 
week passes but these circles meet, and 
they are composed of men of God, who 
hold the Priesthood, and who are sup- 
posed to be clean in every respect, hav- 
ing a knowledge that God lives, obeying 
all His commandments, and observing 
the Word of Wisdom; and the Saints 
should have the privilege of having 
their sick remembered in these circles. 
At the same time, I believe that where 
the humblest servant of God is called 
upon to administer to one who is sick 
in this Church, if he have faith, and 
the afflicted one also, God will grant 
unto them the righteous desires of their 
hearts. And it seems to me that there 
is no need of holding special fast meet- 
ings, or special testimony meetings, or 
special meetings of any kind in the 
wards or Stakes of Zion, in connection 
with or making them a part of the 
simple ordinances of administering to 
the sick. 

I believe, my brethren and sisters, 
that the time will come when every or- 
dinance of the Gospel will be imitated 
in some form or another by the world, 
and this should be a testimony to every 
soul that Mormonism is from God.. If 
our testimony were based only upon 
our belief in administering to the sick 
and the healing of the sick by that 
means, we should be in danger; for 
since that ordinance has been revealed 
to this Church other denominations 
have arisen believing the same thing. 
There is now a denomination in exist- 
ence which believes in the administer- 
ing of oil. By and by there will be 
other denominations formed that will, 
by reading the Bible, conclude that 
there should be Apostles in the Church, 
and they will have men-made Apostles. 
Only a few days ago I read of a sect 
which had risen up in the East claiming 
that there should be Apostles, and some 
of the members had appointed them- 
selves as Apostles of that denomina- 
tion. I think that sooner or later the 
evil one will try to imitate everything 



in the Church of God. I sometimes 
think I can see into the future and see 
many denominations accepting parts of 
the revealed truth and trying to imitate 
perhaps one or more of the ordinances 
of the true Church, and I believe the 
world will have to ultimately acknowl- 
edge that Mormonism, as they call it, 
is exactly the same as the Church that 
Christ placed upon the earth, and that 
it is from God. 

I believe all that God has revealed; 
I believe all that He does now reveal; 
and I believe that He will yet reveal 
many great and important things per- 
taining to the Kingdom of God. You, 
my brethren and sisters, believe the 
same. Not only do we believe, but we 
know that the blessings of God come to 
us when we keep the commandments of 
God. In visiting the Stakes since Bro- 
ther Heber J. Grant was called to open 
a new mission in Japan, and Brother 
Lyman to preside over the European 
Mission, I have had some of the breth- 
ren say to me, "Why I thought the 
time had come when the Apostles 
would be kept at home, and not sent 
abroad;" and they expressed them- 
selves as not knowing how they could 
possibly be spared from here. I want 
to say to the people that if the voice 
of the Lord calls an Apostle, and he 
is wanted in any part of this world, as 
soon as the Prophet of the Lord men- 
tions the fact to him, there is not an 
Apostle in this Church but would go to 
the farthest ends of the earth upon 
a mission — go to any country, or any 
people, and sacrifice if necessary, all 
that he has, even to life itself. What 
more can men do for the Gospel's sake. 

My brethren and sisters, I hope that 
such a feeling of respect for the word 
of God and of confidence in His all- 
ruling power will be instilled into the 
hearts of the people that whenever 
the time comes or whatever the call 
may be from the servants of God, you 
will freely say, "Thy will, O Father, 
not mine, be done." Brother Heber J. 
Grant is called to open a new mission- 
open the door of the great Eastern 
country and introduce the Gospel to a 
new people; and it is my belief that it 
is only the beginning; for as sure as the 
Lord has spoken the word, this Gos- 
pel must be preached to all peoples on 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



th"e earth. It rests upon this people to 
do that work before the coming of the 
Son of Man, and I take it that when- 
ever the call comes and to whomso- 
ever it comes, he will have 
sufficient of the testimony of Jesus in 
his heart to respond to the call and ful- 
fil the mission as God gives him 
strength and judgment. I know that 
our prayers have been with Brother 
Grant ever since it has been known that 
he was called. I know that the Father 
has been supplicated in his behalf, that 
he may have success in opening that 
mission. There is not a question but 
that he goes clothed with all the power, 
all the keys and all the authority neces- 
sary to introduce the Gospel to that 
people. I feel that he will have success, 
even as much as God shall grant he 
should have. 

The hearts of the people have been 
drawn out also for Brother George Q. 
Cannon, who is seriously ill at the pres- 
ent time in California. We hope, we 
pray, we ask our Heavenly Father to 
restore him to us; but if he lives he 
lives unto the Lord, and if he dies he 
dies unto the Lord. Whether he lives or 
whether he dies, he is the Lord's. 

It seems to me that there can be no 
people upon the face of the earth who 
have reason to be more thankful to 
their Heavenly Father for the blessings 
which they receive than the Latter-day 
Saints; for I do not believe there is a 
people living who have more blessings 
showered upon them. I want to bear 
testimony also to what President Snow 
said, that there is not a people living, 
in my opinion, who are more virtuous, 
self-sacrificing and more the lovers of 
God than the people who have accepted 
the name of Latter-day Saints. It 
rests with us, my brethren and sisters, 
whether or not we shall have increased 
blessings. The Prophet of the Lord has 
promised us here today that if we ara 
faithful unto God glorious blessings 
shall be given unto us and it rests with 
us whether or not we shall obtain them. 

My testimony to you, my brethren 
and sisters, is that God lives that Jesus 
is the Christ, that this is the Church 
and Kingdom of God, and that this 
people will not falter, but whenever the 
call is made upon them they will answer 
that call to the best of the ability God 



has given them and with all the 
strength and means they are endowed 
with. May God bless us to this end; 
may His peace be upon us as a people; 
may the Spirit of the Lord be with us 
during this Conference; may the in- 
structions given during this Conference 
be carried from here to every nook and 
corner of the Church; may He bless us 
with a testimony that this is His work, 
and increase that testimony within us 
every day, js my prayer in the name of 
Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER RUGDER CLAWSON. 

Souls precious in the sight of God — That which is 
of greatest worth to a seiva> t oi the. Lord— To 
save othei s a man must put himself in the way 
or salvation — The Gospel to goto the nations- 
Necessity for repentance. 

Brethren and sisters, it is certainly 
a very inspiring sight to see so many 
L;uter-day Saints assembled this morn- 
ing' from all parts of Zion to worship 
the Lord and to receive His word as it 
may be given by His Spirit through 
the Elders of Israel. I greatly rejoice 
jn being present, and I appreciate the 
opportunity of expressing to you brief- 
ly some of my views and feelings in re- 
gard to this great latter-day work. I 
rejoice in the testimony of President 
Snow, in the strength of voice which 
he exhibited, and in . the glorious 
views he presented before us. I have 
had pleasure also in the testimony of 
my brother who preceded me. 

A few words were spoken in relation 
to mjia&ionary work, first by President 
Snow, and then by Brother Smoot, and 
their remarks wi!l harmonize with 
what I would like to read to you this 
morning from the Book of Doctrine and 
Covenants. In a short revelation given 
to John Whitmer, in June, 1829. the 
Lord said unto him: 

"Hearken, my servant John, and lis- 
ten tc the words of Jesus Christ, your 
Lord and jour Redeemer, 

"For. tehold, I speak unto you with 
sharpness and with power, for mine 
aim is over all the earth, 

"And I will tell you that which no 
man knoweth save me and thee alone; 

"For many times you have desired of 
me to know that which would be of the 
most worth unto you. 

"Behold, blessed are you for this 
thing, and for speaking my words 
winch I have given you according to 
my commandments. 

"And now, behold,. I say unto you. 



ELDER RUDGER CLAWSON. 



that the thing which will be of the most 
worth unto you, will be to declare re- 
pentance unto this people, that you 
may bring sou's unto me, that you 
may rest with them in the kindgom of 
my Father."— Section 15. 

In another revelation given shortly 
after, these words occur: 

"And now, Oliver Cowdery, I speak 
unto you, and also unto David 
Whitmer, by the way of command- 
ment; for, behold, I command all men 
everywhere to repent, and I speak unto 
you, even as unto Paul mine Apostle, 
for you are called even with that same 
calling with which he was called. 

"Remember the worth of souls is 
great in the sight of God; 

"For, behold, the Lord your Redeem- 
er, suffered death in the flesh; where- 
fore He suffered the pain of all men, 
that all men might repent and come 
unto Him. 

"And He hath risen again from the 
dead, that he might bring all men unto 
him, on condition of repentance; 

"And how great is His joy in the soul 
that repenteth. 

"Wherefore, you are called to cry re- 
pentance unto this people; 

"And if it so be that you should labor 
all your days in crying repen lance un- 
to this people, and bring, save it be one 
soul unto Me, how great shall be your 
joy with him in the kingdom of My 
Father! 

"And now, if your joy will be great 
with one soul that you have brought 
unto me into the kingdom of my Fath- 
er, how great will be your joy if you 
should bring many souls unto me!" — 
Sec. xviii, 9-16. 

Again : 

"And you must preach unto the 
world, saying, you must repent and be 
bantized. in the name of Jesus Christ; 

"For all men must repent and be bap- 
tized, and not only men, but women and 
children who have arrived to the years 
of accountability." — Sec. xviii; 41-42. 

Brethren and sisters, the matters that 
are brought to our attention in these 
words of revelation are most glorious 
for contemplation. Cast your minds 
back to the early days of this Church, 
and there stood this man John Whit- 
mer, recently come into the Church of 
Christ. Various occupations in which 
he might engage were before him. He 
had the opportunity to labor upon the 
farm, to engage in merchandising, to 
follow mining, to study the profession 
of medicine or law, or to adopt one of 
the many other occupations in which 
men employ themselves. The question 
he asked himself at that time was, 
What would be of the most worth to 



him? By his industry and thrift he 
might acquire the wealth of a 
Gould or a Vanderbilt; he might 
obtain a beautiful home, well 
furnished in every detail, and most de- 
sirable for the comfort and convenience 
of himself and family; he might 
obtain worldly renown in one of the 
professions, and by study and reflection 
become a skillful practitioner in medi- 
cine or a wise and able laywer. I say, 
these opportunities were before him, 
because the country was before him, 
and this country is full of opportuni- 
ties, which are within the reach of all. 
We live in a free country, and the way 
is open to you and to me, as it was to 
this man. He stood there in this situ- 
ation, not having been trained long in 
the Gospel of Christ, and I say to you— 
for it is on record here — that a voice 
came to that man from the eternal 
worlds, and that voice set at rest in 
him every doubt, every dubiety, every 
fearful anticipation. At a critical 
time in his life, when he must choose 
which way to go, that voice said unto 
him that that which would be of most 
worth unto him was to declare repent- 
ance unto the people and bring souls 
unto Christ. The message was of such 
importance that it came to him with 
"sharpness and with power." It was 
the voice of Jesus Christ. It was a 
revelation, given in this day and gener- 
ation, when it is supposed by the peo- 
ple of the world that revelation is done 
away with, that there is no longer com- 
munication between the heavens and 
the earth, that the heavens are sealed 
as brass. The voice of revelation 
comes from heaven and enters into the 
soul of this man and declares unto 
him the right way. Glorious thought! 

And how are we to determine the 
value of souls? This matter has been 
determined for us also by revelation. 
The souls of men are so precious in the 
sight of God that He gave to the world 
His Only Begotten Son, that by the 
shedding of His blood He might draw 
all men unto Him. That is why the 
great Prophet of this dispensation, 
Joseph Smith, and these others. John 
Whitmer, Oliver Cowdery, David 
Whitmer, and the rest, were called to 
bring souls unto Christ. And if one of 
these men should labor all his 



8 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



days, and bring save it be but 
one soul unto Christ, and that one 
should be his wife, what great joy he 
would have with his wife in heaven. 
Then if he should labor all his days 
and bring unto Christ the souls of 
his wife and his children, and none 
else perchance, how great would be his 
joy in heaven with his wife and child- 
ren. 

So the matter is clear in my mind 
that in this kingdom a man must first 
begin at home. He must start with 
himself. He must place himself in the 
way of salvation, and obtain the Priest- 
hood. Then he must set in order his 
own household, and labor for the sal- 
vation of his family. He must not 
ignore his own home, and forget those 
who are near and dear to him. A man 
who cannot save himself through the 
power of God; a man who cannot save 
his wife and children, cannot bring to 
Christ the souls of men in the world. 
I rejoice in this power and authority 
which has been conferred upon man. A 
man must have it before he can go out 
into the world and bring souls unto 
Christ. It is with the Church. The 
Prophet, Seer and Revelator holds the 
keys of this authority, and from him 
it comes to the Elders of Israel. This 
great missionary work that is to be ac- 
complished must first begin at home. 
It must be found in the families of the 
Saints, and in the quorums of the 
Priesthood. Then it must be carried 
bv the Priesthood, as it will be and is 
being carried, to the nations of the 
earth. It is now being carried to most 
of the countries of Europe, and will be 
to all of them, and it is about to be 
taken to the great nation of Japan; for 
I want to say to you that Japan is 
getting to be a great nation. Its peo- 
ple are progressive, and no doubt the 
Gospel will find a foothold in that land. 
But I am impressed with the thought, 
when new missions are to be opened 
up, that then is a time when we must 
feel humble before God. We know not 
what is in store for this Church in the 
Empire of Japan. If the Gospel is to 
find a place in their hearts, and they 
shall give heed to his voice of revela- 
tion from eternity, then the angel of 
God must go before our brother, who 



is charged with this responsibility, and 
the Lord must prepare a people to re- 
ceive the word, else his preaching and 
ministry in that land will be unfruit- 
ful. Therefore, as we look upon this 
question, we see how utterly helpless is 
the man who relies upon his own 
strength, his own experience and learn- 
ing. This is the work of God. He 
goes before His servants, and is their 
rearward. He speaks through them to 
the world; and woe unto that people, 
woe unto that nation, and woe unto 
that family that rejects the testimony 
of Jesus! 

Brethren and sisters, in speaking up- 
on this subject we have taken but one 
view of it. There is another view, and 
that is, that no soul can come unto 
the Father and be accepted of Him, ex- 
cept upon the principle of repentance. 
I fancy I hear some of the Saints say- 
ing, Yts, the principle of repentance is 
very good, but it is mostly intended 
for the nations of the earth that sit in 
darkness and are without a knowledge 
of the Gospel. Yes, take this princi- 
ple of repentance to them. Let the El- 
ders of the Church declare unto them 
that they must repent, that they must 
forsake their sins, and turn unto the 
Lord with a broken heart and a con- 
trite spirit, and He will bless and ex- 
alt them. But let me tell you brethren 
and sisters, that we must not stop here. 
The piinciple of repentance is not only 
intended for the world, but it belongs 
to ire Latter-day Saints. It is a 
principle that should come into our 
lives and be before us continually. 
Have we not need of repentance? Cast 
your eye over this Church; go into the 
wards and Stakes of the Church; visit 
among this people. They are without 
doubt the best people upon the earth, 
but go among them, and then ask your- 
selves if this people have not need of 
repentance. We have need of it. You 
n ust admit it when you learn that 50 
per cent of those who bear th& "Priest- 
hood of God fail to attend their quorum 
meetings. One-half of the bearers of 
the Priesthood attend to this duty, and 
when called upon will arise and bear 
testimony; but the other half, fail. 
Oh! you will say, perhaps, that is not 
so bad; it is only a quorum meeting 



ELDER RUDGER CLAWSON.

you know; they meet once or twice a 
month, and the time between meetings 
is so long that the brethren forget 
about it. But I wish to remind you, 
brethren and sisters, (for the sisters 
should take an interest in this matter 
with their husbands) that the quorums 
of the Priesthood have been established 
by the authority of God, and their 
times and seasons and bounds have 
been set. The duties pertaining to the 
Priesthood are set forth in the Book of 
Doctrine and Covenants with great 
force and clearness. And I say, if the 
meetings of these quorums are of no 
consequence in the church, let them be 
done away with. If they are not worth 
the sacrifice needed in coming together 
for an hour or so once or twice a month, 
let us dispense with them. God will not 
be mocked. If He says such organiza- 
tions in (he Church are necessary, if He 
inspires the organization of a quorum, 
then we must give heed to His word. 
When we make sacred covenants before 
the Lord, as many of our young men 
do, in order to obtain the Priesthood, 
and secure blessings through the Priest- 
hood, and we ignore those covenants, I 
fear the disfavor of the Lord will be 
upon us, and He will hold us to a 
strict accountability. I believe that 
there is need for the application of this 
great principle of repentance to the 
men of the Priesthood. Yet we have 
many faithful ones among us. There 
are various associations in the Church, 
all instituted by the authority of God 
for the benefit and blessing of the 
Latter-day Saints, and this same condi- 
tion prevails more or less throughout all 
of them— about fifty per cent, respond, 
and about fifty per cent do not respond. 

While I speak thus I am reminded of 
the parable of the ten virgins, five of 
whom were wise and five foolish. A 
time came when the five foolish virgins 
needed some oil, and needed it badly. Oh, 
if they could only have gone to the store 
and got a little oil for their lamps. 
But there was not sufficient time. The 
bridegroom was coming suddenly, and 
they must respond at once to the call 
and meet him with oil in their lamps. 
The five wise were ready, the Ave fool- 
ish were not ready, and they could not 
go in to the marriage supper with the 



bridegroom, their Lord and Master. If 
the Master were to come to this Church 
today, there would be five wise and five 
foolish. There would be great conster- 
nation among the people. Men of the 
Priesthood would no doubt be rushing 
about looking up their record, going to 
the quorum meetings and seeing if they 
did not have sufficient credit on the 
.books to go and meet the Master; and 
the clerk would have to say to them 
that they had not been to a meeting for 
two years, or for one year, or for six 
months, as the case might be. They 
could not be given any credit; and if 
they met the Master at all, they would 
have to meet him without it. Oh, how 
sorrowful it would be! What a troub- 
led expression would be seen on the 
countenances of such men! It would 
be the same with the sisters and others 
who have not been faithful to duty in 
the organizations of this Church. And 
it is the same in other directions. 

I grant you, my brethren and sisters, 
there has been a marvelous improve- 
ment in the payment of tithes. A won- 
derful step in advance has been taken 
by the Latter-day Saints in this glori- 
ous principle, which has come to us 
from President Snow almost as a new 
revelation. A special word of warning 
it was to these Latter-day Saints — 
these ten virgins. The word came, Do 
you pay your tithing? Have you oil 
in your lamps? Do you observe this 
law which will sanctify the land of 
Zion? I say great progress has been 
made in this; and yet there are some 
foolish virgins among the people with 
respect to the law of tithing. There 
are many who come short of paying 
what Bishop Preston calls a tithing — 
ten per cent. The Lord has defined the 
percentage that should be paid. I 
am not preaching to you any- 
thing that men have devised. No 
man in this Church instituted the 
principle of tithing. It is as old 
as the Gospel. It was had in the days 
of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. It was 
had in the days of Solomon. It was 
had in the days of Christ. It was had 
upon this continent in the days of the 
Nephites. Yet there are hundreds of 
Latter-day Saints who come short of 
observing it. Many will perhaps pay a 
tenth of a tenth, or an eighth of a 



10 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



tenth, a fifth of a tenth, a sixth of a 
tenth, or a seventh of a tenth. They 
fail to meet the requirement fully. 
Where shall we place them? What 
shall we say of the man who is highly 
blessed of the Lord in temporal mat- 
ters, who has been multiplied exceed- 
ingly in his substance, and whose barns 
are not large enough to hold that which 
the Lord has blessed him with? Is he 
a tithepayer? Well, he thinks he is. 
How much does he pay? Why, he pays 
one-half of one-tenth per cent. Shall 
we say that he is a foolish virgin? I 
think we might be justified in taking 
that view, because I do not understand 
that the Lord is going to be satisfied 
with anything short of the full observ- 
ance of the law. If the Lord intended 
that it should* only be one-half of ten 
per cent, or one-fourth of ten per cent, 
He would have said so. When we fail 
to meet the law exactly, then I appre- 
hend that we are appropriating to our- 
selves something that belongs to the 
Lord, and I do not know what right I 
have to use property or means that 
belongs to Him. I have no way of bor- 
rowing from Him personally. If I am 
going to use any part of the ten per 
cent, I must go to His Prophet and see 
whether my application will be ac- 
ceptable to the Lord; and if the 
Prophet says, No, it is the Lord's means 
and must come into His storehouse, 
then I have no choice left. But you 
see, brethren and sisters, how, because 
the Lord has blessed us with ability to 
gather means and we have it in our 
hands, we infringe upon His rights by 
taking some part of that which belongs 
to him and using it for our own pur- 
poses. 

I speak of this because, while there 
are a number in this Church who do 
not pay any tithing, there are many 
who make an effort in this direction, 
and who perhaps imagine they are ac- 
complishing the thing required because 
they do not entirely reject the law of 
tithing. They pay something, they get 
a credit on the books, and then they 
say to themselves, Soul, sit thou here in 
ease and be satisfied. Let it not be so 
with us, my brethren and sisters. Let 
no man who has the privilege of paying 



tithing be satisfied with the payment 
of less than that which is required. If 
we are going to strive for a blessing, let 
us be sure that we shall obtain it. Let 
us not occupy a position of uncertainty, 
doing something, but not knowing 
whether or not we are doing sufficient 
to secure the blessing. 

Brethren and sisters, there are many 
other things that need to be repented of 
by the people of God. One is that God 
will be sought after, and we do not seek 
after Him as we should. We neglect 
our family prayers; we neglect our se- 
cret prayers, and God is not pleased 
with it. We should come to him in 
mighty faith, ask for His Spirit and 
blessing, and acknowledge His hand in 
our behalf, that we may have His 
Spirit to be with us constantly. Now 
that I am about to sit down, I do not 
know of any theme in the Gospel that 
opens up such a wide field for contem- 
plation and thought as this great and 
glorious principle of repentance. No 
man on the earth in the Church or out 
of it, and, I imagine, no man in 
heaven, can come unto the Lord or be 
received into His favor, except upon 
the principle of repentance — daily, 
hourly repentance, which should mean 
to us daily, hourly improvement, 
growth and progress. God bless you. 
Amen.

"Hail to the brightness of Zion's glad 
morning, 

Joy to the land which in darkness hath

Adv ntages of fasting and bearing teslimony to the 
truth— Obedience to rightful authority — Ne- 
cessity of diligence on the part of the Priest- 
hood. 

My brethren and sisters, I feel blessed 
in being- numbered with the Latter-day 
Saints, and am happy to share in the 
blessings which the Saints enjoy. I 
feel extremely weak in standing be- 
fore you here, and I earnestly pray that 
the Lord may sustain me, and that I 
may enjoy your faith and good will 
while I occupy this position. I feel that 
the Latter-day Saints today have more 
reason to be encouraged than they have 
ever had. The Stakes of Zion are more 
numerous and stronger today than they 
have ever been, and I believe that the 
people as a rule are living their religion 
a little better than they have done here- 
tofore. In traveling among the Saints 
of God in the different Stakes of Zion I 
have been led to feel that there is as 
great union among them as there ever 
has been, and that the outlook for the 
people is most encouraging. We get ex- 
cellent reports, too, from the Elders 
who are preaching the Gospel in the 
nations of the earth. I doubt, however, 
whether we fully appreciate many of 
the blessings which we enjoy. I know 
that some of the Saints do not appre- 
ciate all the privileges within their 
reach. 

The Lord has placed in Zion different 
institutions, every one of which has 
some end to accomplish. As every 
creature which the Lord has placed up- 
on the earth has been created for some 
purpose, so every quorum and organiza- 
tion in the Church has been created for 
some great and grand purpose. We as 
a people have the privilege of fasting 
once a month, and donating that which 
we otherwise would consume for the 
benefit of the poor and the needy among 
us. This is pretty generally observed by 
the Latter-day Saints. But in our fast 
meetings I have felt sometimes as 
though we did not always appreciate 
the blessings that we enjoy. I have at- 
tended fast meetings where the Bishops 
have felt very ill at ease on account of 
the people not responding to 
the invitation to bear their 
testimony. There seems to be 
too much backwardness on the 



part of the Saints in taking advantage 
of this blessing when it is placed within 
their reach; and some of those who do 
arise to testify of the goodness of God 
are looked upon as putting themselves* 
forward a little too much. Jesus said 
that those who would do the will of the 
Father should know of the doctrine, 
and according to my view there is not 
one who has accepted the Gospel of 
Christ and received this knowledge but 
could arise to his feet on the fast day 
and tell of some intervention of Provi- 
dence in his behalf, of some manifesta- 
tion of the gifts of the Gospel, or of 
some blessing received by him from 
the Father. I feel that it is a mistake 
for us to go to fast meetings, and al- 
low the time to pass without utilizing 
it in the manner designated of the 
Lord; and I know that in failing to do 
our duty in this regard we are not 
obedient to the promptings of the Spirit 
of God. The Saints should heed the 
promptings of the spirit at all times; 
for if they do not the voice of the Spirit 
becomes less distinct within them and 
they do not experience it in such power 
as it comes to them when they are obe- 
dient to its teachings. The Apostles 
and Elders in the Church of Christ, in 
this day as in former days, have had as 
their especial guide the whisperings of 
the "still small voice" within them. 
Why, therefore, should we not be obe- 
dient to this Spirit when it prompts us 
in our fast meetings to bear testimony 
of the goodness of God to us? I say, 
there is not one in the Church who can- 
not bear testimony to the presence of 
the gifts of the Gospel in the Church, 
or to having received some of the bless- 
ings of the Gospel. It is this knowledge, 
which is so general throughout the 
Church, that brings about the union 
that there is among the people of God. 
We believe in revelation. We believe 
in having the dictates of the Spirit of 
God individually, so that we do not al- 
ways have to go to someone else to 
know what our duty is. We are oft- 
times prompted by the Spirit of God to 
do many good things. But the trouble 
is, we too frequently quench 
the Spirit, and afterwards we feel 
condemned on account of our disobedi- 
ence to it. In this way we drive 
the Spirit from us, and do not enjoy 



12 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



it in that degree which we would if 
we would always be obedient unto it. 

There can be no order in the things 
of God or the things of man unless 
there is obedience. We all have to be 
obedient to someone. It is necessary 
for us to be obedient to the laws and 
regulations of the state government of 
which we form a part, else harmony 
cannct exist between us and the state. 
It is just so in the Church of Christ. 
We must be obedient to the leadership 
of the Holy Spirit and the man whom 
God ha u called to be His mouthpiece 
in the Church. Had it not been for the 
dictates of this Spirit — this personal 
revelation — how many are there in the 
Church today who would have been 
missed by the Elders in their searches 
abroad for the honest in heart? for 
many Elders have bean prompted to 
enter certain houses, where they have 
met people whose hearts were prepared 
for the seed of the Gospel of the Lord 
Jesus Christ. I feel that the Lord is not 
pleased with the Saints when they 
meet together in fast meeting and fail 
to make use of the opportunity which 
is given them to bear testimony to the 
goodness of God. This is not done for 
show. We fast not to please men. We 
do not believe in that kind of fasting 
which some people indulge in — going 
arcund with disfigured faces, and look- 
ing sorrowful, in order that men may 
know we are fasting. We believe that 
we should go about with cheerful 
countenances, and rejoice exceedingly 
before the Lord, because He has given 
us the privilege of abstaining from 
food one day in a month and contrib- 
uting of our substance for the benefit 
of our fellows who are less fortunate. 
If the Latter-day Saints would sense 
this as I do, our fast meetings would 
be exceedingly interesting. Not that 
we should give way to any great dem- 
onstration; that is not the proper 
thing; but we should enjoy the peaceful 
.nfluence of the Spirit of God, and there 
should never be one, two or Ave min- 
utes wasted in our fast meeings. You, 
no doubt, have all experienced a dif- 
ference in attending fast meetings. 
Sometimes the people will respond 
readily; there is a rich outpouring of 



the Spirit of God; our faith is increased, 
and we feel to thank the Lord for the 
privilege of being present. At other 
times the people show reluctance in 
responding and telling what God has 
done for them; then we go home feel- 
ing that we have not taken advantage 
of our opportunities and have not lis- 
tened to the promptings of the Spirit. 
It rests with the people to make these 
meetings interesting. The measure of 
the Spirit enjoyed depends more or less 
upon the faithfulness of the people in 
performing their duties, in paying their 
fast offerings, and in preparing their 
hearts. The Lord has given this day to 
be a blessing to the people, wherein we 
can enjoy His Spirit and the gifts of 
the Gospel. The people of God do en- 
joy the gift of prophecv. the gift of 
healing, the gift of tongues; and pro- 
bably the latter gift has been taken 
advantage of by the evil one more than 
any other gift in the Church. The 
Saints should be guided by the Spirit of 
God, and subject to those who preside 
in the meetings. If the Bishop, who is 
a common judge in Israel, tells a per- 
son to restrain this gift, or any other 
gift, it is the duty of that person to do 
it. The Bishop has a right to the gift 
of discernment, whereby he may tell 
whether these spirits are of God or not, 
and if they are not they should not 
have place in the congregations of the 
Saints. No man or woman has a right 
to find fault with the Bishop for re- 
straining him or her in any of these 
matters. The Bishop is the responsible 
party, and it is his privilege to say 
what shall be done under his presi- 
dency. I desired to make these remarks 
in connection with our observance of 
the fast day. 

Brethren and sisters, we ought 
to be obedient to our Bishops. 
We are amenable to them in the 
wards, no matter what priesthood we 
hold. We owe respect to them; for 
any man who has not enough of 
the Spirit of humility to be governed is 
not fit to govern. A man who cannot 
be led is not fit to lead. We ought to 
be humble, and submissive to the Spirit 
of God. We exercise our free agency 
as to whether we shall be members of 
this Church or not; but if we become 



ELDER ABRAHAM O. WOODRUFF. 



13 



members of the Church we must be 
obedient to the dictates of the Spirit 
and to him who holds the keys of this 
dispensation at the present time. It is 
expected that we will sustain him and 
stand by him. I cannot think of any- 
thing that is more valuable to me than 
to enjoy the confidence of the Prophet 
of God. I prize this more than anything 
else in this world. To me it is the rich- 
est blessing that men and women can 
enjoy, to have the favor of God's ser- 
vants who are called to preside over the 
Church and over the different Stakes 
and wards in the Church. There is an 
order in the Church of Christ. It is not 
possible for the Presidency and the 
Apostles to go into every ward and into 
every house; therefore there are Stake 
and ward organizations. Three High 
Priests are called to preside over a 
Stake, just as three High Priests are 
called of God to preside over the whole 
Church. Then we have a High Council 
in the Stake, after the pattern of the 
Twelve Apostles. These men labor in 
the Stakes and wards, and they ought 
to be respected wherever they visit, as 
the Presidency and the Apostles are 
respected in the different Stakes when 
they visit them. They are the leading 
men of the stake, and they are respon- 
sible for the affairs in that Stake. If 
there is an unsatisfactory condition ex- 
isting in the Stake, we do not first go 
to the lay members to enquire concern- 
ing it, but we go to the men who bear 
the responsibility, and demand of them 
to know why there is an unsatisfactory 
condition there. And I wish, my breth- 
ren and sisters, that every Stake Presi- 
dency and High Council would be as 
zealous and as faithful in trying to keep 
the people in the line of duty as the 
First Presidency and Twelve Apostles 
strive to be. I wish they would be as 
united, and sense the responsibility 
which rests upon them as much 
as these men do. If they would do 
this, the matter of the payment of our 
tithes would not be a reformation 
started only to die out in a little while, 
but the interest would be kept up all 
the time; and this cannot be done un- 
less the Presidents and High Councils 
of the different Stakes sense the respon- 



sibility which rests upon them. This 
is not a spasmodic movement. It was 
not begun to last one or two years. It 
was intended to last for all time; and 
that after the labor was begun by the 
Presidency of the Church and the Apos- 
tles, every Stake presidency, every 
High Council and every Bishorpic 
throughout the Church would continue 
the work and labor as long as there was, 
one non-tithepayer left in the Church. 
Have they done this? If they have, 
then there are not many non-tithe- 
payers in the Church today. But I fear 
that some of the brethren have thought 
that this was a temporary movement: 
that it was needed just at that par- 
ticular time, but that after the one 
effort had been made there was no 
need of carrying it on. There is still, 
I am storry to say, a great list of non- 
tithepayers in the Church; and it is 
evident in some instances that the 
presidency of the Stake and the High 
Council and the Bishoprics have not 
labored quite as hard as they might 
have done. We could not expect that 
they would convert all these non-tithe- 
payers in one year, or two years, or three 
years; but more of them might have 
been converted if every man in the 
Church who is a tithepayer sensed the 
responsibility of this as keenly as 
President Snow does. I feel that this 
is a matter that ought to receive the 
at'enticn of Stake and ward officers, 
and they ought to realize that our 
Eternal Father will hold them respon- 
sible for the use of the^r influence and 
talents, just as much in their positions 
as He will the President of the Church 
in his position. President Snow be- 
lieves, his counselors believe, and these 
Apostles believe that it is possible for 
these Stake and ward officers to con- 
vert the big majority of the non-tithe- 
payers, as well as those who are negli- 
gent in other respects. We believe 
that most of the people prize their 
standing in the Church sufficiently to 
induce them to repent and do better, 
provided they are labored with and 
their condition placed before them in 
its true light. The trouble has been 
in some cases, that officers have not 
regarded this as an important move-

ment, or that it was not essential to 
continue it; and, of course, wherever 
this spirit is manifested by a Bishop or 
a Stake officer, what can be expected 
of the people? We expect that every 
officer in this Church will set a good ex- 
ample, and say to the people, Follow 
me; that he will not require anything 
of his people that he is not willing to 
do himself. We expect this to be the 
case in every organization of the 
Church, among the sisters as well as 
the brethren. 

My brethren and sisters, I rejoice in 
the work in which we are engaged. I 
thank God that I am permitted to live 
in this day and time, and to do my small 
and humble part in connection with the 
upbuilding of His kingdom. I rejoice 
that my labor becomes sweeter and 
dearer to me every day that I live. 
Instead of it becoming burdensome, it 
becomes more of a joy and satisfaction. 
I thank God for His Priesthood. I 
honor it, and I honor my brethren with 
whom I am connected in this Priest- 
hood. I pray for God's blessings upon 
the people, that they may be filled with 
His Spirit. I pray that we may be 
faithful all the day long; that we may 
not simply run well for a time, but that 
we may labor continually, until we 
shall have brought about a greater de- 
gree of perfection in ourselves and the 
Church of God than exists today. Those 
who are trying to keep the command- 
ments of God and are measurably suc- 
cessful, let them labor with their fel- 
lows until there shall not be a non- 
tithepayer left in the Church — at least, 
until there is a much more satisfactory 
condition that there is today. Let us 
do our part, my brethren and sisters, 
to bring joy to the heart of God's 
Prophet, in having his desires accom- 
plished and seeing the people respond 
as he would have them to this and other 
commandments which the Lord has 
given. May God's peace and blessings 
be upon His people. May He bless us 
in all our undertakings and labors, and 
may we go forth from this Conference 
with renewed determination to do His 
will and to serve Him all our days. May 
God help us all to be faithful to the 
end. I ask it in the name of Jesus. 
Amen. 



ELDER MATTHIAS F. COWLEY. 

I nprovements in financial afiairs of the Church — 
Organization of new Stakes of Zion — Neces- 
sary official changes in uhe Pri> sttiood— Dif- 
ferences among brethren should be avoided — 
President of the Church and other authorities 
should be sustained. 

My brethren and sisters: I suppose 
that I need not ask for your faith and 
prayers. I always need them, and I 
understand it to be our duty to con- 
sider ourselves responsible as well as 
the speaker for the measure of the Holy 
Spirit that we enjoy. It is our duty 
also to pay the strictest attention to all 
that is said, and to be imbued with a 
determination to carry out the instruc- 
tions which are given unto us. 

The Latter-day Saints are under- 
stood to be a practical people. Paul 
said concerning the former-day Saints 
that the Lord would "purify unto him- 
self a peculiar people, zealous of good 
works." I read in the newspaper re- 
cently a statement made by a man 
holding a legislative office, to the effect 
that he desired to see the wiping out of 
the peculiarity which characterized the 
Latter-day Saints. I say, God grant 
that it never shall be wiped out, that 
the Spirit of the Gospel shall never de- 
part from us, that the principles which 
that Spirit has implanted in our hearts 
shall never be obliterated, and that we 
shall never cease to teach our children 
and our children's children that Joseph 
Smith was a prophet of the living God, 
that every principle which God revealed 
to him was divine, and that he laid his 
life upon the altar to establish the truth 
of those principles which he enunciated 
to the world. I hope that this peculiar- 
ity will always attach to the Latter-day 
Saints, and that it will become more 
distinct and pronounced as the years 
roll by. As the work of God progresses 
we ought to progress. 

It has been now two years and a half 
since we first sustained President Lo- 
renzo Snow as the successor of Presi- 
dent Wilford Woodruff, as the Prophet, 
Seer and Revelator unto this Church. 
I want to bear my testimony to the 
Latter-day Saints that the work of God 
has always prospered, and that it has 
prospered most remarkably during the 
last two years and a half. Through 
a combination of circumstances that 



ELDER MATTHIAS F. COWLEY. 



15 



possibly could not be avoided, and that, 
have been met by the servants of God 
to the very best of their ability, the 
Church has been involved financially ; 
but under the direction of the Spirit of 
God in President Snow this financial 
obligation has been greatly reduced. 
The hand of the Lord has been mani- 
fest in his administration to a remark- 
able extent. He has blessed the Lat- 
ter-day Saints with the spirit to re- 
spond to the call that was made by 
President Snow some two years ago for 
the people to come to a higher standard 
in the observance of the law of tithing. 
The Latter-day Saints quite generally 
have responded to this call, and God 
has blessed them for so doing. The spir- 
it of this principle has been more gener- 
ally disseminated among the Saints than 
it ever has been. The presiding Coun- 
cil of Seventies have done a remarkably 
good work in presenting this subject to 
the quorums of Seventies throughout 
the Stakes of Zion. The Seventies 
constitute one of the most substantial, 
energetic and faithful bodies of men ex- 
isting in the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints, and the preaching 
and labors of this Council are to be 
commended. Their visits to the Stake 
conferences are but a small part of 
their work. They are constantly con- 
sidering the obligation and responsi- 
bility that God has placed upon the 
Seventies of this Church, namely, to be 
messengers of God to the inhabitants 
of the earth; and they are all the time 
seeking to more thoroughly effect the 
organization of these quorums and to 
indoctrinate them in the principles of 
the everlasting Gospel. I believe that 
the authorities of the Church generally 
have sought to perform the duties of 
their calling. We have, however, our 
w( aknesses, and we do not feel superior 
to our brethren who occupy different 
stations throughout the Stakes 
of Zion. The Presidency of this Church, 
the Twelve Apostles, the First Seven 
Presidents of Seventies, the Presid 
ing Bishorpic, the Patriarch — I want 
to testify that they are humble 
men; that they desire to know and un- 
derstand the will of God in the per- 
formance of their duty; and that, 
though we entertain individual views 



in regard to various matters, we 
generally come to a unity of faith in 
regard to all propositions which effect 
the work of God here upon the earth. 

Another thing I will say, as it occurs 
to my mind. During the last two years 
and a half there has been an increase 
in the Stakes of Zion, possibly a greater 
increase proportionately in the number 
of the Stakes than in the population. 
This has been an essential step, because 
many of the Stakes of Zion were so 
large that the Presidency of the Stakes 
could not possibly give that personal 
administration which the people need- 
ed. God moved upon His servant to 
divide these Stakes, and it has resulted 
in calling into activity a great body of 
men and women, some of whom were 
previously comparatively inactive, and 
they have manifested a marked degree 
of interest and energy in the work of 
God. We still have other Stakes of 
Zion to organize; for they are extending 
to the east and the west, to the north 
and the south; and after a while we will 
organize Zion, as it is called, and the 
Stakes of Zion, as it extends from the 
Atlantic to the Pacific. 

But there is great need, in all the 
Stakes of Zion, of a reformation in the 
activity of those who bear the responsi- 
bility of the bishopric, and other lead- 
ing officers in the Priesthood. Some 
brethren have been very neglectful of 
their duties. Others have manifested 
an incapacity to perform the duties of 
their respective offices in the holy 
Priesthood. It is necessary that this 
should be rectified. It is not necessary, 
in order to obtain salvation in the 
kingdom of God, that a man 
should preside over a ward as 
a Bishop. When he becomes, through 
age, sickness or any other cause, 
unable to perform the duties of that 
high calling, it is no discredit for him 
to resign and give place to another 
man; in fact, it is a credit to him, and 
he ought to do it. The same may be 
said of the President of a Stake. 
Why, President Lorenzo Snow and 
President Franklin D. Richards — two of 
the humblest and most energetic men in 
the Church— on one occasion went to 
President Brigham Young and told him 
that if he considered that they were in- 



16 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



efficient, incapable or inactive in their 
Apostleship, they were willing to step 
aside and let their Apostleship be con- 
ferred upon other men. So great was 
their humility and their love for the 
work of God that they offered to do 
this. In this, my brethren, there is a 
great principle. Every man and woman 
should esteem the work of God first and 
foremost. I have always had a joy in 
my heart that this was the work of 
the Lord. Though I have felt my own 
inefficiency to a marked extent, I have 
always had the feeling, This is the work 
of God, and whether I stand or fall, 
whether I am worthy to maintain the 
responsibility that I bear or not, the 
work of God will be maintained just 
the same. The work of God is not de- 
pendent upon us as individuals. It is 
His work, and He will maintain it. 

There is another thing I want to say 
to my brethren in connection with our 
labors and associations in the Priest- 
hood. We all have our individuality 
and our peculiar characteristics. It is 
perfectly right that it should be so; for 
God so designed it. He organized this 
earth, and He did it in such a way as 
to give variety. He placed thereon 
the mountains, the valleys, the lakes, 
the rivers, the seas, the vegetation and 
all the rest to beautify it and make it 
suitable for the abode of man. The 
Latter-day Saints have come from al- 
most all the civilized nations under 
the sun, and after awhile Japan nd oth- 
er parts of the Orient will 
yield forth Latter-day Saints; 
for God "will say to the north, 
give up; and to the south, keep not 
back: bring my sons from far, and my 
daughters from the ends of the earth." 
They will come, and I say, in the name 
of the Lord, that no power under the 
sun can hinder it. No power can re- 
tard the work of God. It is the duty 
of the Latter-day Saints to understand 
this work, and to esteem the Spirit of 
the Gospel as the best associate that 
we can have. 

Now I want to say that the brethren 
do not always dwell together in peace. 
David said, "Behold, how good and 
how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell 
together in Unity! It is like, the pre- 
cious ointment upon the head, that ran 



down upon the beard, even Aaron's 
beard." I know that some Bishoprics 
do not labor as unitedly as they ought 
to do; and the reason is because they 
do not enjoy the spirit of their calling 
to the extent that they should, and 
that is the result of their not getting 
together and holding council meetings. 
They do not bring themselves in sub- 
jection to the will of the Holy Spirit, 
and as a consequence there is differ- 
ence among them. Now, when the 
presiding authorities of a ward or a 
Stake are disunited and they do not 
enjoy the Spirit of God in their call- 
ing, it will effect the entire ward or 
Stake. The result is, in some Stakes of 
Zion, we need a change and a reforma- 
tion, to bring about a condition that is 
more in harmony with the progress of 
the work of God. In meeting the re- 
sponsibility of the Priesthood that we 
bear we should not allow our personal 
objections to our brethren to inter- 
fere with our relationship to them in 
the offices and labars of the holy Priest- 
hood. I remember Brother Clawson 
stated here last conference that he had 
found one brother who did not pay his 
tithing because he had some per- 
sonal antipathy to the Bishop. Another 
man did not pay his tithing because he 
had a personal objection to the Presi- 
dent of the Stake. I want to say to 
you, my brethren, that this is all wrong. 
We are the servants of God. If God 
has entrusted a man with the responsi- 
bilities of the Priesthood, and that 
man from his boyhood up has honored 
that Priesthood, has been ready to go 
on missions abroad, willing to submit 
to the counsel of the Priesthood on all 
subjects, and on hand to perform the 
will of God in every direction, I say to 
you that notwithstanding the weak- 
nesses of such a man, he is a servant of 
God, whom God has honored, and there 
ought not to be anybody in his ward 
or in his Stake who would entertain 
such antipathy to him as to cause, him 
to refrain from performing the duties 
of his calling. At the same time every 
Bishop and every Stake President ought 
to put his arms around the people and 
make them feel that he is indeed their 
father. He should not rule with a rod 
of iron, nor with the determination to 



ELDER MATTHIAS F. COWLEY. 



17 



llways have his own way; but he 
should rule in the spirit of love and 
kindness for his brethren. 

I believe, my brethren and sisters, 
that there are but few men and women 
In this Church who cannot be saved 
and kept from departing from the per- 
formance of their duty, if they are 
properly taught and a spirit of love is 
manifested for them by the shepherds 
of the flock of Christ; but where there 
is disunion and difference of opinion, 
and where wrong influences have as- 
serted themselves through financial or 
political affairs, the effects are injuri- 
ous. If we do not belong to the same 
political party, or if perchance we may 
engage in a competitive business finan- 
cially, we ought not to let that divide 
us in spirit or place us at variance with 
our brethren. We cannot afford to do 
this, because men at times, though they 
may feel they have been wronged, if 
they are not careful they will be wrong 
themselves by fighting against their 
brethren who bear the Priesthood of 
the Son of God and who are appointed 
to preside as Bishops or Presidents, or 
as general authorities. I am reminded 
in this connection of a statement 
made to the Prophet Joseph Smith. 
As you know, in the early 
history of the Church they had 
a great many difficulties. At one 
time they sought to establish Zion, 
In Jackson county. Oliver Cowdery 
and W. W. Phelps were placed in 
charge, I believe. The Lord revealed 
unto the Prophet Joseph Smith the 
principle of the United Order, and He 
thowed him how to establish this prin- 
ciple. But there was jealousy and envy 
Hmong the brethren; there was a dis- 
position to find fault one with another. 
The result was that the enemy came 
upon them and drove them from their 
inheritances; and the Lord uttered a 
flecree that but few of those, if any, 
tvho were- driven out should live to re- 
turn. I do not know of scarcely any 
that are alive today of those who oc- 
cupied Jackson county when that reve- 
lation was given. The Lord revealed to 
them how they should live. He said it 
was not pleasing to Him that one man 
should possess that which was above 
another. He declared that the earth 
was full of His bounties, and He de- 
signed that all should have enough. 



He asked them to consecrate all that 
they had to the establishment and 
beautifying of Zion, and that every 
man and woman should be made re- 
sponsible for the stewardship whicbi 
their gifts and capacities fitted them 
for. They should have all that they 
needed to eat, to wear, to house them- 
selves, and to educate and bring up 
their children in the ways of the Lord; 
but all the surplus should be conse- 
crated for the redemption of Zion. This 
was the principle revealed at that time, 
and we shall yet have to come to that. 
In this connection the Lord said to the 
Prophet Joseph Smith; 

"Behold, thus saith the Lord your 
God unto you, O ye Elders of My Church 
hearken ye and hear, and receive My 
will concerning you; 

"For verily I say unto you, I will 
that ye should overcome the world; 
wherefore I will have compassion upon 
you." 

Let me say that this revelation and 
voice of warning is unto the Latter- 
day Saints today, -and it is our duty to 
overcome the world. There is a 
constant effort being made to des- 
troy our young people by the in- 
fluences and powers of darkness, 
and we should set our faces as 
flint against it. I want to raise my 
voice to the young people of the 
Latter-day Saints and ask them to at- 
tend their Sunday schools and their Im- 
provement associations. I want to en- 
courage them to attend to their Dray- 
ers night and morning. I want to en- 
courage them to go on missions, both 
young men and young women, when 
the Lord shall so indicate, and lift up> 
their voices in defense of the work of: 
God. If they will do this and be obedi- 
ent to the counsel of the holy Priest- 
hood, they will never turn aside from 
the work of God. Young people, guard 
your virtue; esteem it as dearer than 
the blood which flows in your veins; 
for God has placed a premium upora 
honor and chastity, and he or she who 
loses that gem loses something thai 
cannot be restored in this life, if It caa 
in the life to come. 

The revelation continues: 

"There are those amonsr you wlu 
have sinned." 

That is true today. There are thosi 
among us who have sinned. There ara 



18 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



those among us who have sat in coun- 
cil with the ungodly, and who have 
sought to overturn the counsel of the 
holy Priesthood, and who have set 
themselves up as superior in judgment 
and wisdom to those who hear the 
Priesthood of the Son of God. In this 
they have sinned. Woe unto them that 
seek deep to hide their counsel from the 
Lord, and their works are in the dark! 
Wherefore, repent, and do so no more. 

"But verily I say, for this once, for 
mine own glory, and for the salvation 
of souls, I have forgiven you your sins. 

"I will be merciful unto you. for I 
have given unto you the kingdom: 

"And the keys of the mysteries of 
the kingdom shall not be taken from 
my servant Joseph Smith. Jr.. through 
the means I have appointed, while he 
liveth, inasmuch as he obeyeth mine 
ordinances. 

"There are those who have sought 
occasion against him without cause." 

My brethren, there are those who 
have sought occasion against the 
servants of God without cause. 
They have sought occasion against 
the man who has stood at the head of 
the Church, and whom God has said we 
should look upon as His representative 
upon the earth. He said concerning the 
Prophet Joseph Smith, "Ye shall re- 
ceive his words as if from mine own 
mouth;" and the same authority and 
power to lead the Church was conferred 
upon the Prophet Brigham Young, 
and was extended to President John 
Taylor, and to President Wilford Wood- 
ruff, and now rests upon President Lor- 
enzo Snow, who holds the keys of the 
-work of God at the present time. There 
are those who have sought occasion 
against him without cause. Now, it is 
not only the man who stands at the 
head, and his counselors, and the 
Twelve Apostles, the presiding Council 
of Seventies and the Presiding Bishopric 
-who bear this great ' responsibility of 
representing God, but every man who 
Tjears the holy Priesthood is a repre- 
sentative of God; and in his sphere 
and calling it is understood that he 
■shall have the mind and will of God to 
administer unto the people. The Bishop 
of a ward, the President of a Stake, 
the presiding Elder of a quorum, or a 
presiding council of Seventies, may en- 
joy the revelations of the Holy Ghost 
to guide them in the duties of their 



office. It is, therefore, not only our 
duty to avoid sinning against our breth- 
ren who bear the Apostleship, but it is 
our duty to be exceedingly kind and 
charitable to and assist in upholding 
and sustaining every officer in the 
Church, whether he be the Bishop of 
a ward, the President of a Stake, or the 
holder of any other position in the 
Priesthood. We have no right to tear 
down his influence among the people 
of God. And we are not injured by re- 
fraining from it; for there is no man, 
from the head of the Church down to 
the last ordained Deacon, who will have 
power to lead the people of God astray 
or to work any permanent injury to the 
cause of Christ. There is authority 
and power in the Church to bring every 
man to justice in the due time of the 
Lord, and it is not our business to find 
fault and to tear down. The Lord is no 
respecter of persons, and when His 
Prophet sinned He told him of 
it, according to this revelation. 

"Nevertheless he has sinned, but 
verily I say unto you, I, the Lord, for- 
give sins unto those who confess their 
sins before me and ask forgiveness, 
who have not sinned unto death. 

"My disciples, in days of old, sought 
occasion against one another, and for- 
gave not one another in their hearts, 
and for this evil they were afflicted, 
and sorely chastened; 

"Wherefore I say unto you, that ye 
ought to forgive one another, for he 
that forgiveth not his brother his tres- 
passes, standeth condemned before the 
Lord, for there remaineth in him the 
greater sin. 

"I, the Lord, will forgive whom I will 
forgive, but of you it is required to 
forgive all men." 

No Latter-day Saint has any right 
or title to the fellowship of the Spirit 
of God if he entertains an acrimoni- 
ous spirit against any living man or 
woman. God has sacrificed for our sal- 
vation. How often has President Snow 
told us that He required men to make 
sacrifices for the benefit of the whole 
people. He sacrificed His own beloved 
Son, that we might have redemption 
from the bonds of death, and also from 
our individual sins. He suffered His 
Son to die a most ignominious death, 
that the resurrection might be brought 
to pass. The Prophet Joseph Smith was 
raised up in this dispensation to stand 
at the head thereof, and he suffered 
all kinds of ignominy and scorn at the 



ELDER MATTHIAS F. COWLEY.

hands of men outside the Church, and 
treachery and perfidy at the hands of 
apostates inside the Church; and final- 
ly, commensurate with the importance 
of the great message which he bore, he 
gave the last evidence that can be 
given by man upon earth to establish the 
divine authenticity of any principle- 
he gave his life. His blood was shed in 
Carthage jail. He was an innocent man, 
free from sin; for God had forgiven his 
little trespasses and imperfections. He 
was a man of God, a pure, upright man; 
a man that not only honored God, but 
he loved his fellow man and honored 
the nation that gave him birth. He laid 
it down by the revelations of the 
Holy Spirit that God founded 
this government by inspiration, which 
rested upon the patriotic fathers, 
who gave their blood to establish lib- 
erty upon this land. Such was the 
Prophet Joseph Smith. But he was not 
a perfect being; he i(a.s not free from 
weakness; neither are we. I was go- 
ing to say, I thank God that my breth- 
ren are not; for if they were free from 
imperfections I would not be with them. 
They say misery likes company, and I 
am glad they have imperfections; for I 
feel at times as though I was exceed- 
ingly imperfect. When I see the stand- 
ard of righteousness that belongs to 
the Gospel of the Son of God, I feel 
so immeasurably below it that I feel 
almost unworthy to be a member of the 
Church, to say nothing of being an 
Apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ. It 
scarcely ever enters my head that I am 
one, only I remember that I have been 
ordained, and I am constantly stirred 
up with a feeling that I must do my 
duty, I must declare this Gospel, or I 
will be damned; but the thought of be- 
ing superior to any Elder, or Seventy, 
or Priest, Teacher, or Deacon, has 
never entered my heart; nor do I be- 
lieve it enters the hearts of my breth- 
ren who bear the Apostleship, for they 
are humble men. They have not 
chosen themselves; God has chosen 
them by the voice of inspiration 
through the Prophet who stands at the 
head of the Church. 

Remember, my brethren and sisters, 
these few verses that I have read from 
Section 64 of the Doctrine and Coven- 
ants. There is also another statement 



in it in connection with the authorities 
of the Church, and it will not only ap- 
ply to a Bishop or to the presiding au- 
thority of any Stake in Zion, but also 
to the Apostleship and to every man 
who bears responsibility in the holy 
Priesthood. It says: 

"And even the Bishop who is a 
judge, and his counselors, if they are 
not faithful in their stewardships, shall 
be condemned, and others shall be 
planted in their stead; 

"For, behold, I say unto you that 
Zion shall flourish, and the glory of the 
Lord shall be <upon her, 

"And she shall be an ensign unto the 
people, and there shall come unto her 
out of every nation under heaven. 

"And the day shall come when the 
nations of the earth shall tremble be- 
cause of her, and shall fear because of 
her terrible ones. The Lord hath 
spoken it. Amen." 

Now I want to say a word in regard 
to the people of the world adopting the 
ordinances of the Gospel, alluded to this 
morning by Elder Reed Smoot. I be- 
lieve I sat upon the stump of a tree in 
the State of "Virginia and read a pro- 
phecy by President Joseph P. Smith 
that the day would come when the min- 
isters of sectarianism would teach the 
doctrines of this Church, and it would 
be a strong delusion among the people. 
The sects of the day, my brethren and 
sisters, have a greater knowledge re- 
specting the strength and force of this 
work than they admit to the people. 
They keep the people of the world in 
the dark in regard to the truth, and 
they are afraid to open their doors and 
let the people come in and hear the 
truth enunciated by the servants of 
God. I recently visited every State in 
the Eastern States mission. President 
E. H. Snow took great pains to see that 
I had the opportunity of bearing my 
testimony in every State of his Mission, 
In a prominent little city of one State 
the Elders circulated handbills from 
house to house, and after it was done, 
the sectarian ministers visited from 
house to house and gathered up the 
handbills, and asked the people not to 
go and hear us.. I want to say that I 
am not afraid to hear the representa- 
tives of any denomination on earth, nor 
to give them the opportunity of pre- 
senting their views. But the adversary 
is at work. He has understood the work 
of God from the beginning. He sought

to destroy the Prophet Joseph Smith in 
the very outset. He sought to destroy 
the Son of God when He was on earth; 
and when he could not do that he 
Bought to tempt Him,, promising Him 
that if He would worship him he would 
give Him all the kingdoms of this 
world. He also sought to tempt the 
Prophet Joseph Smith to use the 
Book of Mormon for financial gain; but 
God had given him commandment 
that he should not make merchandise 
of sacred things, and he did not yield to 
the tempter. When the ministers found 
that they could not overturn the work 
by their arguments, they incited the 
people to resort to mobocracy. The 
Baints were hounded from place to place, 
Apostle David Patten and others were 
slaughtered; and finally the Prophet 
Joseph Smith and his brother Hyrum 
were cruelly assassinated in Carthage 
jail, sealing their testimony with their 
blood, and the Saints of God were driv- 
en to these mountain valleys. And now 
they have come to realize that it is 
useless to try to mob the work out of 
existence, and they cannot overturn it 
by fair and open combat from the Bible, 
so they are adopting the method of 
teaching the doctrines that we teach. 
Now, I want to say to the Latter-day 
Saints that there is no need of going 
outside of this Church for the healing 
of your sick by Christian Science or by 
any other institution in the land which 
seeks to counterfeit the power of God. 
that there are good people among them 
all is true; but their doctrines are not 
of God. God has revealed this work. 
He has given us a testimony of the 
truth, and He expects that we will use 
the authority of the Priesthood and the 
faith He has planted in our beings to 
heal the sick and to accomplish the 
work which He has assigned unto us, 
s,nd that we will not fellowship these 
Dther institutions by giving them our 
patronage. It is contrary to the mind 
and will of the Lord that we should do 
>o. 

In conclusion, my brethren and sis- 
ters, I want to bear my testimony. I 
feel well in the work of God. I love 
President Lorenzo Snow; I love his 
counselors, President Cannon and Presi- 
dent Smith. I ask God to heal Presi- 
dent Cannon and return him home in 



safety. I ask the Latter-day Saints 
to pray for him with the intensity of 
their souls, and pray for others who 
are afflicted. I love my brethren of the 
Twelve Apostles, and our most vener- 
able brother, President Brigham Young, 
who has spent his life in the ministry, 
and who has been on hand for the work 
of God, whether to preach the Gospel 
or to shoulder his musket in defense of 
the people against the Indians, as had 
to be done in the early history of the 
Territory. I love the Seventies, the 
Bishopric, the Patriarch, and all my 
brethren and sisters. I am glad to ex- 
press this love and fellowship for you. 
I pray for you night and morning, and 
I ask you to remember me in your faith 
and prayers. God will vindicate this 
work, and we must have faith in it. Out 
of Israel, says Isaiah, I will gather Is- 
rael. It is not everyone that will stand 
and be faithful; As Elder Clawson said 
this morning, of the ten virgins five 
were wise and five were foolish. Let us 
try and not be numbered among the 
foolish ones. Let every Bishop, when 
he returns home, endeavor to straight- 
en up his ward; let every' President of a 
Stake do likewise with his Stake; and 
let every man, woman and child infuse 
the spirit of this conference into their 
families, that the power of God may 
be among the people, and that we may 
not be as trifling children, quarreling 
over fences, or over politics, or thosa 
things that canker the heart and de- 
stroy the fellowship of the brethren and 
sisters one for the other. Do not for- 
get that this is the work of God, and 
not of man. God bless you. In the E.am« 
of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER ANTHON H. LUND. 

Humility, union and and true greatness. 

I am happy to see so many of the 
Saints present on the first day of oui 
Conference, and I have rejoiced in the 
instructions given by the brethren wlM 
have addressed us. I was much Im- 
pressed with the remarks of the last 
speaker. He bore testimony that th« 
leading brethren In the Church ari 
humble men. The Apostles have jus! 
concluded their quarterly conference, 
and one of the subjects dwelt upon 
was this principle of humility. It was 



ELDER ANTHON H. LUND. 



21 



shown that it is absolutely necessaiT 
to cultivate humility, if we shall make 
progress in the kingdom of God. J 
can also bear testimony to the fact that 
the Twelve Apostles are one, and seek 
to be one with the Presidency of the 
Church. When Brother Cowley read 
the words of the revelation in which 
we are told that the disciples of old 
had feelings against one another, I felt 
to rejoice that it could be said of the 
Twelve today that they are a unit; and 
it is desirable that this oneness of feel- 
ing should pervade all Israel. We know 
that it is required of us to be one. If 
we are not one, Jesus will not acknowl- 
edge us. In one of the revelations He 
makes this statement: 

"But, verily, I say unto you, teach 
one another according to the office 
wherewith I have appointed you, 

"And let every man esteem his broth- 
er as himself, and practice virtue and 
holiness before me. 

"And again I say unto you, let 
every man esteem his brother as him- 
self; 

"For what man among you having 
twelve sons, and is no respecter of 
them, and they serve him obediently, 
and he saith unto the one, be thou 
clothed in robes and sit thou here; 
and to the other, be thou clothed in 
rags, and sit thou here, and looketh 
upon his sons and saith I am just. 

"Behold, this I have given unto you 
a parable, and it is even as I am: I 
say unto you, be one; and if you are not 
one, ye are not mine." — Doc. and Cov., 
Sec. 38: 23—27. 

This requirement is made, not only 
of the Twelve, but of all the Saints. 
If we shall be recognized and acknowl- 
edged by our Master, we must 
prove unto Him that we are one— 
not only one in our belief, 
but one in our acts, and one in our 
conduct and in the treatment of one 
another. We have heard it read that 
one should not have above another. 
The Lord has always laid stress upon 
unity. In the last teachings of our 
Savior to His disciples, - during the 
week before He left them, how impres- 
sive are His words upon this princi- 
ple! He wanted them to be one. as 
He and the Father were one; and He 
asked in His prayer that this might 
be. Unity is the distinguishing charac- 
teristic of Saints in every age. As Lat- 
ter-day Saints, we want to try to be 



united with one another and with th« 
Presidency. Let us carry out the coun. 
sels that come to us through them, and 
let us not feel one above another. 

If one man shall acquire more of thia 
world's goods than another, let it not 
lift him up and make him feel that 
that makes him better than his brother. 
Remember that the Lord withstands 
the proud; and purse-pride I think is 
meaner than any other pride. Yet it is 
natural to us. There should not arise 
class distinctions among the Latter-das 
Saints. I do not believe there is much 
of this; but at certain times there 
seems to be a little more of it in our 
midst than there ought to be. The 
other day I had the pleasure of attend- 
ing a reception given our President on 
his birthday by the workers in the 
Temple. I was pleased to be present 
and feel the spirit there. In talking 
with one of our Bishops, I remarked 
how pleasant it was to see those who 
had not any of this world's goods min- 
gling with those who had, as brethren 
and sisters, and he said, "I have heard 
some say that we have class distinc- 
tions in our midst, and men who have 
riches are accused of feeling above 
their brethren; but I have never fell 
anything of that kind." Now, that man 
has plenty of this world's goods, but he 
did not feel that wealth exalted him 
above his brethren. I believe that as a 
general thing the possession of wealth 
has a tendency to lift men up. If the 
Lord blesses us with temporal riches, 
they should not have this effect upon 
us. It may not be the fault al- 
together of those who have 
means that there sometimes arise 
lines of distinction between them and 
their poorer brethren. We who have not 
much of this world's goods are not en- 
tirely free from pride; if for instance, 
our brother with whom we have been 
well acquainted, and who has acquired 
more means than we have, happens to 
pass us without noticing us, though he 
does it unthinkingly, we are apt to 
judge him harshly and say to ourselves 
that because he has a little more means 
than we have he will not notice us now. 
He may be entirely innocent, yet we 
nurture this feeling, and we become 
estranged from one another. Thia 



22 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



should not be. We should love one an- 
other, and be one. You do not see any 
class distinction between those who la- 
bor in the Temples. The Temple is a 
place where the atmosphere is entirely 
free from a feeling of one being above 
another. When our missionaries go out 
to preach the Gospel, sometimes a 
young man of rich parents will be as- 
sociated with the son of poor parents, 
but they do not feel that there is any 
distinction between them. They go out 
tracting and holding meetings together, 
they pray together, and live together as 
brethren. The difference between them 
in worldly means is forgotten, and they 
try to be united on the work they have 
in hand. Now, as the missionaries feel 
abroad, as you feel when you go into 
the Temples of God, so you should feel 
in your everyday lives. 

Let us not forget the injunctions given 
to us in regard to humility. Do not 
think that humility is opposed to 
greatness. On the pontrary, no man 
ever became great who was not humble.- 
In the history of the world, we have 
called men great, who did not deserve 
the title. For a man to be great there 
must be originality about him; he must 
be above the common, and the differ- 
ence between him and the common 
must be something that is beneficial to 
men. It is the benefit that flows from 
his personality that makes him great— 
his influence on the world for good. 
Take our Savior, as was alluded to so 
beautifully this morning by our Presi- 
dent. Born at Bethlehem, in a manger! 
He went below all things, both in rank 
and wealth. He did not seek for wealth. 
He had come to fulfil a mission. He 
was humble in all his acts, and yet He 
was the greatest being that has lived 
upon the earth. Humility and greatness 
were combined in His character. The 
same was reflected in the character of 
our Prophet, Joseph Smith. He was a 
man without cant, a humble man, a 
great man. Of all men that lived in the 
nineteenth century I look upon him as 
the greatest. There was something be- 
yond the common in this man, which 
will have a beneficial influence upon 
the whole mass of humanity. The 
truths which he brought forth by the 
power of God will be studied by men 



and their worth recognized. Men will 
not credit the source, but the truth will 
win its way. He was a great man, and 
at the same time a humble man. His 
successors have been the same. If we 
want to attain greatness, we must not 
forget this virtue of humility. Perhaps 
many of those who feel so self-righ- 
teous will find that to cultivate humil- 
ity is a hard task; still it is necessary. 
We look forward to exaltation, but to 
obtain this we must go through the 
valley of humility. We must go down 
into it, and then ascend, and before us 
is a destiny so bright that we cannot 
conceive it. 

Brethren and sisters, let us cultivate 
these virtues. Let us be one. Let us 
not regard one another on account of 
wealth and rank; but let us esteem 
men for the good works they do, and 
for their humility in living before the 
Lord. Let this be the rank which we 
all shall seek for. The Twelve received 
the call of the Lord, not feeling elated 
because they were to receive a higher 
seat in the synagogue, but with fear 
and trembling, hoping that they might 
be able to perform their duties. In re- 
ceiving the call they felt that it made 
them indeed the servants of their breth- 
ren and sisters, and they are trying to 
live so that they can serve them, and 
serve their Heavenly Father. 

I do not feel to take up more of your 
time, only I would like to impress upon 
all, the necessity of unity; with that we 
shall be strong and able to fight the 
battles that are before us, and we shall 
come out victorious. My testimony is 
that this is the kingdom of God — the 
stone that Daniel saw. Now, if we 
are to be that stone, and to have its 
force, we must be solid and united. 
We do not want the stones to be a 
conglomerate that in its speed will 
break to pieces. We want to be a unit- 
ed people, that can stand together, and 
then the Lord will fulfill His promise — 
He will give the dominion unto His 
Saints. God bless you all. Amen. 
The choir sang: 

High on the mountain top 

A banner is unfurled; 
Ye nations, now look up, 

It waves to all the world.

ELDER M. W. MERRILL. 

Evidence of progress — Temples and vicarious 
work for the dead — Duties of Presidencies of 
Stakes, High Councilors and Bishops— Effec- 
tive methods of settling difficulties. 

I am gratified to see so many in at- 
tendance at this conference. We are 
here from different parts of this State 
and from other States to receive coun- 
sel and advice and to partake of the 
spirit of the conference. 

While sitting here yesterday I was 
thinking that is is forty-seven years 
this spring since I first attended confer- 
ence in this city, and I have been con- 
trasting in my mind the changes that 
have occurred from that time until 
now. At that time none of these beauti- 
ful buildings on this block were here. 
We met, I think, in the old tabernacle, 
and the congregation was small com- 
pared to what it is today. Since that 
time many of our dear brethren and 
leaders of the Church have been called 
to labor in another sphere, and others 
have taken their places; this beauti- 
ful Tabernacle has been erected; and 
four Temples have been reared in this 
State to the name of the Lord, at a 
cost of some millions of dollars. It is 
wonderful to contemplate the progress 
and advancement that the people of 
God have made. The Lord has surely 
blessed their labors, and multiplied 
them in the good things of the earth. 
He has also increased them in faith and 
in every blessing that makes life desir- 
able. We certainly ought to be a good 
people, and very humble. We ought to

acknowledge God, and in the earnest- 
ness of our souls seek Him for a con- 
tinuation of His mercies. 

Yesterday, in thinking about the 
Temples which have been built, I won- 
dered how many among us appreciate 
the privilege of entering into the house 
of the Lord and performing a vicarious 
work for our kindred who have passed 
away. The doctrine of salvation for 
the dead was revealed to the Church at 
an early day. From the very beginning 
of the work the Church has been com- 
manded to build Temples. It 
was so with the Nephites. 
They had only been upon this 
continent a few years before they com- 
menced the erection of a temple. The 
work in this dispensation had only been 
inaugurated a few years when the 
building of a temple commenced. This 
shows the importance of the work, and 
the necessity of the Latter-day Saints 
laboring in the interest of their kindred 
dead. There are many brethren and 
sisters who can bear testimony that 
numbers of those who have been offi- 
ciated for in the temples of the Lord 
have approved of the work done for 
them by their friends. In the midst of 
all our other cares and labors, this 
principle of redeeming our kindred 
should not be lost sight of. Our Elders, 
when they go abroad, especially if they 
go to the land of their fathers, should 
be diligent in searching out the rec- 
ords of their forefathers, so that after 
their return they may officiate in the 
temples of the Lord for them. We only 
have this short life — but a few days — in 
which to engage in this work and to 
manifest to our kindred on the other 
side that we have interest in them, and 
we ought to avail ourselves of the op- 
portunity. We without them cannot be 
made perfect; neither can they without 
us be made perfect. This work of the 
redemption of the dead will go on. 
President Taylor once remarked that it 
would go on in our lifetime, and in the 
lifetime of our children, and in the 
lifetime of our children's children, and 



24 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



throughout the Millennium, and I do 
mot know how much longer. The small 
fceginning we have made is as a drop 
in the ocean compared to that which 
has to be done; for it is the design of 
the Father to save and redeem His 
children. 

The Saints have done pretty well, 
considering their circumstances; hut 
the spirit of temple-work has not yet 
permeated the hearts of the people as a 
whole. A number have done a good 
work, and have sought diligently the 
records of their fathers; while others 
have been indifferent. I feel in my 
heart that there should be an awaken- 
ing among the people in regard to this 
matter. While we have the opportunity 
- — while the day lasts — let us avail our- 
selves of this privilege. Some are 
putting it off because they have 
only got a small record, and they say 
to themselves, "I guess I'll wait a lit- 
tle longer until I can increase my rec- 
ord, so that when I do commence I can 
continue." I do not think that is a good 
idea. If you have the record of but few, 
those few ought to be officiated for; and 
when you have attended to them, if 
you are diligent, the way will be open- 
ed up whereby you may obtain 
other records. This has been the case 
frequently. We cannot afford to wait 
when we have the opportunity. 

I suggest these things because I am 
engaged in this work, and I feel the im- 
portance of it. It is just as important 
to redeem our kindred as it is to go 
abroad and bring souls into the Church. 
The houses of the Lord have been 
erected, their doors are open to those 
who are worthy, and we ought to at- 
tend to this. Furthermore, associated 
with the Temples of the Lord are bless- 
ings that cannot be found in other 
places. The power of God is frequently 
manifested there to individuals. The 
■visions of their minds are opened, and 
they see the things of God. Of course, 
these things are not for the public, nor 
to be heralded abroad; they are sacred, 
and given of the Lord for the comfort 
and consolation of His faithful servants 
and handmaidens. Hence I urge the 
importance of the Saints considering 
these things in their homes. Families 
should arrange their affairs so that this 
work can be attended to in their life- 



time; for the evidence is manifest on 
every hand that it will only be a little 
while before you and I will be among 
those that were; we will be gone to the 
other side, our labors, so far as mortal- 
ity is concerned, finished. Now is the 
accepted time; now is the day of salva- 
tion. 

Many things were brought to my 
mind yesterday relative to the growth 
and sanctiflcation of the people. I 
have found in my experience that it ia 
a constant labor to obey the precepts 
of the Gospel. We have a perfect 
Church organization. Nothing like it 
can be found anywhere. It 
has come from the Lord. We have Stake 
and ward organizations. One of the 
Stake organizations is the High Coun- 
cil. Now, it has been considered in days 
gone by that the office of High Coun- 
cilor was a nominal one, and that 
there was not much for the High Coun- 
cil to do. This is a mistaken idea. They 
should be one with the Presidency of 
the Stake, as the Twelve Apostles aie 
one with the Presidency of the Church; 
and it would be an excellent thing if 
the presidents of Stakes would follow 
the lead of the Presidency of the 
Church. We find that the Presidency 
cf the Church have their regular meet- 
ings. They meet one day each week, 
and as many of the Twelve meet with 
;,hem as are able. It would be well li 
this were followed in the Stakes. Let 
the Presidency of the Stake meet every 
week, and the High Council meet with 
them, and talk over matters pertain- 
ing to the welfare of the people of the 
Stake. Let them sing and pray to- 
gether, and ask the Lord to direct them 
in their ministry. I know this is a good 
thing. I will tell you what is needed 
in the whole Church, and that is, that 
every ward in the Church be labored 
with by the officials of the ward and of 
the Stake, that it may be said one year 
from now that every non-tithepayer in 
the Church has been converted. Some- 
body has to do this labor, why not the 
Presidency of the Stake and the High 
Council take it up and see what good 
they can accomplish the coming years. 
Let them see if they cannot bring about 
a reformation, that the report may not 
come to the President of the Church 
that there are ten thousand, or any 



ELDER M. W. MERRILL. 



oilier number of non-tithepayers in the 
Church. 

This law of tithing was not insti- 
tuted by man; it is the word of the 
Lord to the people, and those who do 
not comply with it will certainly meet 
with loss. Hence the importance of 
every member of the Church being- en- 
lightened, that they may be brought 
to realize their position and the neces- 
sity of reforming and doing better. And 
how can a man be converted without 
somebody to convert him? How can he 
hear without a preacher? If this labor 
were to devolve upon the Presidency 
and High Council, it would give the 
High Council something to do besides 
sitting on trials. While the High Coun- 
cils are organized and prepared to hear 
and adjudicate difficulties between 
brethren, their labors should be direct- 
ed in other channels, and those who 
have difficulties should be advised to 
settle them themselves. 

I will tell you how I have done in 
Cache Stake. For the past year we 
have not had one High Council trial. 
We have selected brethren and sent 
them to parties having difficulty and 
trouble, and I have said to the breth- 
ren, Go and sing the songs of Zion to 
them. "Well, how many times shall 
we sing?" "Well, sing once, and then 
pray; sing again, and continue to sing 
until the Spirit of the Lord is there, 
and you can feel that there is a soften- 
ing." I tell you, it has had excellent 
results. The difficulties have been set- 
tled by the parties themselves. Their 
hearts have been softened, and they 
have concluded to arrange their own 
troubles. That i= the only way they 
can be settled. The High Council can- 
not do it; the Bishop's court cannot 
do it. They may pass decisions, but 
does that settle it? There is only one 
way to settle it, and that is set forth in 
the scriptures: Go to thy brother, and 
between him and thee alone make re- 
conciliation. Let us settle our difficul- 
ties ourselves, and let the High Council 
be employed in preaching the Gospel 
and in conversing by the fireside, just 
as our Elders do in the world. Our 
Elders make more converts by the fire- 
side than they do in the pulpit. They 
go to the homes of the people and talk 



with them. That is just what is needed 
in Zion. Let our brethren who have 
authority go to the firesides of the 
people, and convert them to attending 
their meetings and doing their duty. 

Especial comolaint is made that tha 
Elders do not attend their quorum 
meetings. They need converting. They 
are good men, but careless and incon- 
siderate. Their minds need to ba 
touched by the Spirit of the Lord, and 
there needs to be an awakening in their 
hearts. There is no trouble about the 
sisters; if the brethren will only do 
right, lead and counsel, and sing 
and pray in the family circle, the sis- 
ters will be all right. The difficulty lies 
with the heads of families and with 
the bearers of the holy Priesthood, who 
have agreed to do their duty, because 
when we ordain people now we ask 
them if they will be faithful in their 
calling and ministry. We need an 
awakening. 

While it is proper for the Presidency 
and High Council to meet, and to sing 
and pray together, the same rule will 
apply to the Bishopric of every ward. 
Have these meetings weekly; and do 
not let some trifling thing keep you 
from them. One Bishopric said to me 
that not one of them could sing. I sug- 
gested that they call in somebody who 
could sing; and if they could not get 
anybody let them sing the best they 
could themselves. Do the best you can, 
and the Lord will accept it. Sing and 
pray, and talk over the affairs of the 
ward. Just as sure as you will adopt 
this policy and carry it out, you will be 
benefactors to the ward and a blessing 
to the people. Your minds will be led 
out in the interest of the people; and 
when they see you have their welfare at 
heart they will be willing to come to 
you for counsel. President Snow says 
there are many Bishops who do not do 
their duty. I know that is true, and I 
know the Lord inspired him to say it, 
for he could not make a personal visit 
to each ward and find out its condi- 
tion. The Lord inspired him to say 
this, and it ought to sink into our 
hearts. We want to save men and wo- 
men; we want to save families. We go 
abroad and spend our time and means 
to preach the Gospel and gather people

into the Church, while in many in- 
stances we are neglecting those right at 
our doors. Everybody is not alike, and 
it is a good thing we are not. President 
Snow says we each have our individ- 
uality, and we always will. I suppose 
we will always be .just what we are, 
and if we make progress in ourselves, 
so much the better. It is expected that 
we will make progress, and that we will 
spread abroad. 

It is designed in the heavens that this 
people shall be at the head, and that 
the great men of the nation will come 
by and by to Zion for counsel and wis- 
dom. Where are we going to get it? 
What are our opportunities above oth- 
er people? Why, we commune with the 
heavens. There is where we are in ad- 
vance of the world. We not only have 
the advantages of their learning, but 
we have divine inspiration, by which 
our minds are enlightened. The Presi- 
dency of t!» Church have the heavens 
opened to them by the Spirit and power 
of God, and they will be able to counsel 
the wisest of the nations. This time 
will come; nor is it far off. 

My brethren and sisters, I feel the 
importance of having an awakening 
among the saints. Do not think to at- 
tain to great things by peculiar mea- 
sures, as Brother Smoot referred to 
yesterday, such as having special fast 
meetings for the benefit of somebody. 
Take the order of the Church as it is, 
and do not seek to bring in side issues 
and change the ordinances of the Gos- 
pel. If we change the ordinances of the 
Gospel, we will soon break the covenant 
we have entered into. The Lord com- 
plained to ancient Israel that they 
transgressed His laws, changed the or- 
dinances and broke the everlasting 
covenant; and He chastised them be- 
cause of their iniquities. On another 
occasion He told them that they had 
robbed Him. They wanted to know 
wherein they had robbed Him. "In 
tithes and offerings." How many of us 
have robbed the Lord in tithes and of- 
ferings? While there has been a very 
commendable increase in this direction, 
I feel in my heart that we have not yet 
fully come up to the mark and satis- 
fied the feelings of our beloved Presi- 



dent, because he comprehends these 
things, and God is with him to inspire 
ana direct him in his counsels to the 
Latter-day Saints. Let us see if we 
cannot improve this present year. But if 
a reformation is brought about, it must 
be by effort and labor. If it is effective 
in ourselves and in our families, it will 
need labor. This devolves upon the Pres- 
idents of Stakes, upon High Councils, and 
Bishops, and all the Priesthood, and 
the Lord will not justify us if we 
seek to shirk the responsibility. Hence, 
my brethren and sisters, I think the 
best thing we can do is to make new 
resolutions in our hearts; and where- 
in we have failed in the past, let us try 
to make up for it in the future. So 
sure as we do, the Lord will be with 
us, and the manifestations of His pow ■ 
er will be felt in every Stake and ward 
of Zion. It is the rule, the discipline 
of the Church, and we must seek to 
carry it out in our lives, that it may 
be said of us when we pass away, as 
it can be of a number of good people, 
"Well done, good and faithful servant; 
you have done well in your lifetime: 
you have filled the measure of your 
creation in usefulness before the Lord, 
and have labored unselfishly in the 
interest of His work." If we could di- 
vest ourselves of selfishness and trust 
implicitly in our Father, how grand 
would be our history. 

I suppose I have occupied all the time 
that belongs to me. I feel well. I 
know that this is the work of God. I 
bear record to you that it is. The Gos- 
pel has been revealed in our day and 
time, and we have been privileged to 
have our eyes opened a little to com- 
prehend the great truths God has re- 
vealed. These brethren at the head are 
the right men in the right place. The 
Presidency of the Church are filled with 
inspiration; they are clothed with the 
power of, God, to the extent that their 
administration is successful, and will 
continue to be successful. Let our ad- 
ministrations continue to be successful, 
and the Church will triumph; the king- 
dom and the greatness of the king- 
dom will be given to the Saints of the 
Most High) by and by, and shall never 
more be taken from them. Amen.

ELDER JOHN W. TAYLOR. 

The Church built upon new and continuous revela- 
tion — Divine authority conferred upon and 
through Joseph Smith— Time of the gathering 
of Israel at hand— Gospel of the kingdom 
restored and all nations shall hear it— Coming 
of Christ is near. 

My brethren and sisters, I trust that 
our Father in heaven will bless me with 
a portion of His Holy Spirit this morn- 
ing, that I may say that which shall be 
in accordance with His mind and will, 
for I realize that except the Lord is 
with us we can accomplish nothing. 

When I behold this vast concourse 
of people gathered together in this 
large building, I naturally ask myself 
the question, What brings them to- 
gether? And as I am familiar with 
the fact that you have gathered from 
the four corners of the earth, and are 
building up a great commonwealth in 
western America, I ask myself, What 
is the great moving force among this 
people? Elder Merrill has just re- 
ferred to the great temples that the 
Latter-day Saints have built in this 
State, and I am aware that this people 
are dwelling in upwards of four hun- 
dred cities, towns and villages in the 
Rocky Mountain region. It is truly a 
remarkable work that is being accom- 
plished by the Latter-day Saints, and 
I naturally enquire, What is this great 
work founded upon? I passed a build- 
ing the other day, and it had poles 
sticking up against the east and south 
walls. I looked for a moment at the 
building, and I discovered that it was 
going to fall, because the foundation 
was not good. It was evident, from the 
appearance of the house, that the more 
you built upon the walls the greater 
would be the fall when it should come. 
In the early history of the Salt Lake 
Temple there were spme large stones 
put in the foundation which were not 
sound. President Young discovered 
this; and although it had cost a great 
deal to put the foundation in, he or- 
dered it all taken out. What was his 
object in doing this? It was that there 
might be a good, solid foundation un- 
der that structure, so that when the 
temple was completed, the foundation 
would not crack and give way by rea- 
son of the immense weight resting upon 



it. Now that it is completed we can see 
the wisdom exhibited by President 
Young at that time. 

I desire to compare our Church to a 
house; and I say unto you that if you 
are not building your foundation strong 
and of good material, the greater the 
house you put upon it the greater will 
be the fall when it shall come. What 
kind of a foundation have you? Is it 
laid correctly? As I understand it, the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints is built upon the foundation of 
revelation from God the Eternal Father 
— not upon revelation given eighteen 
hundred years ago; for we would be 
slow to build a house with stones that 
had been in a building eighteen hun- 
dred years; but upon revelation given 
in the nineteenth century. In using 
this word "revelation," I do not refer to 
it as it is understood by the sectarian 
world; but I mean new and continued 
revelation from God the Eternal Father, 
to guide His people. Are we justified 
in taking this view of the situation? 
Let me ask this congregation, What 
was the Church of Christ built upon in 
the days of Jesus? This can best be 
answered by Jesus himself. On one oc- 
casion He asked His Apostles. "Whom 
do men say that I the Son of man am?" 
They replied, "Some say that thou art 
John the Baptist; some, Elias; and 
others, Jeremias, or one of the proph- 
ets." He said, "But whom say ye that 
I am?" Peter, who was the President 
of the Apostles, answered him saying. 
"Thou art the Christ, the Son of the 
living God." Jesus then blessed Peter, 
saying, "Blessed art thou, Simon Bar- 
jona; for flesh and blood hath not re- 
vealed it unto thee, but my Father 
which is in heaven. And I say also un- 
to thee, That thou art Peter, and upon 
this rock I will build my Church; and 
the gates of hell shall not prevail 
against it." From this we can see that 
the Church of Christ in His day was 
built upon the principle of revelation 
from God the Eternal Father — the same 
principle that made known unto Peter 
that Jesus was the Christ. 

"There was a man of the Pharisees, 
named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews; 

"The same came to Jesus by night, 
and said unto him, Rabbi, we know 
that thou art a teacher come from God: 



'is 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



for no nvan can do these miracles that 
thou doest, except God be with him. 

"Jesus answered and said unto him, 
Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except 
a man be born again, he cannot see 
the kingdom of God. 

"Nicodemus said unto him, How can a 
man be born when he is old? can he 
enter the second time into his mother's 
womb, and be born? 

"Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say 
unto thee. Except a man be born of 
water and of the Spirit, he cannot en- 
ter into the kingdom of God." 

There are many people today exactly 
in the same position as Nicodemus was. 
They will have to be born again be- 
fore they can understand the things of 
God. But the Apostle Peter had been 
born of the Spirit. And how did this 
come upon him? It came by revelation 
from God; and Jesus told him that up- 
on this rock of revelation He would 
build His Church. That is the kind of 
foundation which underlies the struc- 
ture of the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints. 

Jesus went still further in blessing 
Peter. He said: 

"And I will give unto thee the keys 
of the kingdom of heaven: and what- 
soever thou shalt bind on earth shall 
be bound in heaven: and whatsoever 
thou shalt loose on earth shall be 
loosed in heaven." 

Here was divine authority conferred 
upon the children of men to act in the 
name of the Lord Jesus Christ; "for 
there is none other name under heav- 
en given among men, whereby we must 
be saved." 

In this day the keys of the kingdom 
of God were conferred upon the 
Prophet Joseph Smith. John the Bap- 
tist came and conferred the Aaronic 
Priesthood upon him, and Peter, James 
and John conferred the Melchisedek 
Priesthood. Was Joseph Smith au- 
thorized to go forth and administer in 
the ordinances of life and salvation, 
because God the Eternal Father and 
His Son Jesus Christ had appeared un- 
to him? Oh, no! Before he could do 
that it was necessary that the keys of 
the kingdom of heaven should be con- 
ferred upon him. After Peter, James 
and John appeared unto him, Elijah 
came and gave unto him the 
keys for the redemption of the 
dead: and Moses came and de- 
livered unto him the keys of the 



gathering of Israel in the last days. 
For behold, my brethren and sisters, 
that day is at hand which was spoken 
of by the Prophet Jeremiah: 

"Therefore, behold, the days come, 
saith the Lord, that it shall no more be 
said, the Lord liveth that brought up 
the children of Israel out of the land of 
Egypt; 

"But the Lord liveth that brought up 
the children of Israel from the land of 
the north, and from all the lands 
whither he had driven them: and I will 
bring them again into their land that 
I gave unto their fathers. 

"Behold, I will send for many fishers, 
saith the Lord, and they shall fish 
them and after will I send for many 
hunters and they shall hunt them 
from every mountain, and from 
every hill, and out of the holes of the 
rocks." 

This day is at hand. The fishers and 
the hunters are going from nation to 
nation, declaring the Gospel of the 
kingdom of God; for it has been re- 
vealed in its fulness in this our day 
by an angel from God. After the 
Prophet Joseph Smith had been or- 
dained and set apart to preach the 
everlasting Gospel and administer in 
the ordinances thereof, he ordained 
others according to the commandment 
of God; and today we have hundreds 
and thousands of the Elders of Israel 
going forth to the various nations of 
the earth, lifting up their voices and 
crying, "Repent ye, repent ye, for the 
kingdom of heaven is at hand." Jesus 
tried to gather the people together in 
His day, but they would not. He 
wept over the city of Jerusalem, and 
said: 

"O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that 
killest the prophets, and stonest them 
which are sent unto thee, how often 
would I have gathered thy children to- 
gether, even as a hen gathereth her 
chickens under her wings, and ye would 
not!" 

On another occasion He told the 
Jews, because they had rejected Him: 

"Therefore say I unto you, the king- 
dom of God shall be taken from you, 
and given to a nation bringing forth 
the fruits thereof." 

After His resurrection, His disciples 
asked .Him, "Lord, wilt thou at 
this time restore the kingdom 
again to Israel?" He answered, 
"It is not for you to know the times 
or the seasons which the Father hath 



ELDER JOHN W. TAYLOR. 



29 



put in His own power." There was a 
certain way in which the kingdom 
Bhould he restored to Israel; the Pro- 
phets had written about it, and Jesus 
recognized that. He had told His dis- 
ciples previously that He came not to 
do away with the law and the prophets, 
but to fulfil. "Verily I say unto you, 
till heaven and earth pass, one jot or 
one tittle shall in no wise pass from 
the law, till all be fulfilled." Jesus also 
prophesied that they would persecute 
His disciples and cast them out of their 
synagogues, and that the time would 
come when they who killed them would 
think they were doing God's service. 
Did this come to pass? Yes. All the 
Apostles were put to death, excepting 
one man, and he remained on the earth 
according to the promise of the Savior 
as recorded in the sixteenth chapter of 
Matthew. Who was that? John the 
Revelator. But it seemed like he was 
destined to suffer; for he was a slave 
on the Isle of Patmos, working in the 
lead mines. While there the angels of 
God ministered unto him, and he was 
shown many great and glorious things 
pertaining to the history of the people 
who should live upon this earth. He 
described the way in which this king- 
dom, which Jesus said should be taken 
from among the Jews, should be re- 
stored again to Israel. In the four- 
teenth chapter of Revelation, he says. 

"And I saw another angel fly in the 
midst of heaven, having the everlast- 
ing Gospel to preach unto them that 
dwell on the earth, and to. every nation, 
and kindred, and tongue, and people, 

"Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, 
End give glory to him; for the hour of 
His judgment is come: and worship 
Him that made heaven, and earth, and 
the sea, and the fountains of waters." 

We testify to you here today that this 
has been literally fulfilled. The angel 
Moroni came unto the Prophet Joseph 
Smith and declared unto him the ful- 
ness of the everlasting Gospel, and 
commanded him to go into all the 
world and preach the Gospel to every 
creature. "He that believeth and is 
baptized shall be saved; and he that 
believeth not shall be damned." 

Some of you have heard that Elder 
Grant is going to Japan, and you be- 
(;in to query in your minds, Is this na- 
tion of the house of Israel? Is it a 
proper thing for Elder Grant to go to 



Japan? I want to tell you that there is 
no nation on the face of the earth but 
will hear the everlasting Gospel; for 
the word of God has gone forth that 
the Gospel shall be proclaimed unto all 
nations for a witness; and this was to 
be a sign of His coming and of the end 
of the world. Then our minds may be 
set at rest in regard to Elder Grant 
going to Japan. 

How beautiful is this! We begin now 
to understand why the Savior instruct- 
ed His disciples to pray, "Our Father, 
which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy 
name. Thy kingdom come." The sec- 
tarian world todav are all praying for 
the kingdom of God to come. Let me 
say to them and to all the world, that 
God has revealed himself from the 
heavens in this our day. He has or- 
ganized His Church and Kingdom upon 
the earth, for the redemption of the 
children of men. And it is no longer 
necessary for you, my brethren and 
sisters, to ask God the Eternal Father 
that the kingdom of God may come; 
but pray that He will prepare you for 
the coming of the King— our Lord and 
Savior Jesus Christ. For, behold, that 
day is at our doors. As the Prophet 
Malachi has said: 

"Behold, I will send my messenger, 
and he shall prepare ■ the way before 
me; and the Lord, whom ye seek, shall 
suddenly come to His temple, even the 
messenger of the covenant, whom ye 
delight in: behold, he shall come, saith 
the Lord of hosts." 

Some will say that this messengef 
sent to prepare the way was John the 
Baptist; but I say unto you that Jesua 
Christ did not come suddenly unto Hia 
temple in that day. He grew up as a 
child, and they said, "Are not these hia 
brothers and His sisters." It was th« 
second coming of Christ that Malachi 
referred to, as the following- will prov« 
to you: 

"But who may abide the day of Hia 
coming? and who shall stand when H« 
appeareth? for he is like a refiner's 
Are, and like fuller's soap: 

"And He shall sit as a refiner and puri- 
fier of silver; and He shall purify th« 
sons of Levi, and purge them as gold 
and silver, that they may offer unto the 
Lord an offering in righteousness." 

All the children of men abided th« 
day of His first coming. They lived 
with Him, talked with Him. and list-

GENERAL conference. 



ened to His instructions; but I say un- 
to you that when He comes the second 
time, following the testimony of His 
servants, He will come as a refiner's 
Are and as fullers' soap. "For, behold, 
the day cometh, that shall burn as an 
oven; and all the proud, yea, all that 
do wickedly, shall be stubble; and the 
day that cometh shall burn them up, 
saith the Lord of hosts, that it shall 
leave them neither root nor branch." 

My testimony unto you is that the 
coming of our Lord and Savior Jesus 
Christ is nigh at hand. I testify that 
we have Prophets, Seers and Revela- 
tors among this people .and that Loren- 
zo Snow is the man who has been called 
upon to be the mouthpiece of God unto 
this people. It is as Jesus said, "Man 
shall not live by bread alone, but by 
every word that proceedeth out of the 
mouth of God." This principle of revel- 
ation is the foundation of the Church 
of Christ. It is the rock that Christ 
told Peter He would build His Church 
upon; and upon that rock the Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is 
built. How beautiful is this principle! 

How nicely this corresponds with the 
words of Jesus: 

"It is expedient for you that I go 
away; for if I go not away, the Com- 
forter will not come unto you; but if I 
depart I will send him unto you. 

"Howbeit when He, the Spirit of 
truth, is come, He will guide you into 
all truth; for He shall not speak of 
Himself; but whatsoever He shall hear, 
that shall He speak: and He will show 
you things to come." 

This is revelation. This is the power 
of God unto salvation. This is 
the principles by which God guid- 
eth His Church in every age of 
the world. I rejoice, my brethren and 
sisters, that this Church is built upon 
revelation. I can go further, and say 
that it is built "upon the foundation of 
apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ. 
Himself being the chief corner stone." 

I pray the Lord to lengthen out the 
life of President Lorenzo Snow, that he 
may live to fully satisfy his desires up- 
on the earth and the mind and will of 
God concerning him; that He will also 
bless his counselors, according as they 
need at this very hour, and bless and 
qualify every one of us to perform our 
duties in the Church and Kingdom of 



God. For I say unto you, my brethren 
and sisters 1 , it is not he that has the 
gift of prophecy, or the gift of tongues; 
it is not he that has received the 
ministration of angels, that will be 
saved in the Kingdom of God; but it 
is he that endureth unto the end. 
Speaking of the time when He should 
sit on the throne of His glory and judge 
the children of men, Jesus says: 

"Many will say unto me in that day, 
Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in 
thy name? and in thy name have cast 
out devils? and in thy name done many 
wonderful works? 

"And then will I profess unto them. 
I never knew you: depart from me. ye 
that work iniquity. 

"Not every one that saith unto me, 
Lord, Lord, shall enter into the king- 
dom of heaven; but he that doeth the 
will of my Father which is in heaven." 

When the Savior came upon the 
earth, there were men living who held 
the Priesthood; but would thev re- 
ceive new revelation? No, they 
would not; but they said. "We have 
Abraham to our father." John the Bap- 
tist rebuked them for their hypocrisy, 
and said, "Think not to say within 
yourself, We have Abraham to our fa- 
ther; for I say unto you. that God it, 
able of these stones to raise up children 
unto Abraham." Jesus said to His 
disciples, "Ye are the salt of the earth: 
but if the salt hath lost his savor, 
wherewith shall it be salted? it is 
thenceforth good for nothing, 
but to be cast out. and to 
be trodden under the foot of men" 
I say unto you that we have men in 
this day holding the Priesthood after 
the order of the Son of God, who have 
lost their savor, and they are good for 
nothing, but to be cast out. For I tell 
you, the Lord will not justify any man, 
no matter what Priesthood he holds, 
except he hold himself ready to keep 
the commandments of God, to be hum- 
ble, and to be obedient to his seniors 
in the Priesthood. It is an eternal 
principle, that he that humbleth himself 
shall be exalted, and he that exalteth 
himself shall be abased. Jesus descend- 
ed below all things, that He might rise 
above all things; and the only way we 
can be justified in the sight of God is 
to be humble and obedient. Instead of 
being determined to have our own will, 



ELDER HEBER J. GRANT.

let us bring- our will, our passions and 
our ambitions into subjection to the 
mind and will of God as manifested 
through His servants who preside over 
us, and we will be saved in the day 
of the Lord Jesus. But if we determine 
to have our own way and work out our 
own will, we will stand condemned; for 
the Lord will not justify any man in 
becoming a law unto himself. 

God bless you and fill you with His 
Holy Spirit, and help us all to keep His 
commandments, that we may be saved 
and exalted in His kingdom, which is 
my prayer in the name of Jesus. Amen. 



ELDER HEBER J. GRANT. 

Recognition of the fidelity of the Saints— Actlors 
the best evidence of sincerity— An exhibition 
ot true friendship — A testimony to the truth. 

I am pleased to have the opportunity 
of standing before the Latter-day 
Saints and addressing them in this 
conference. 1 have rejoiced in the 
spirit and inspiration of the confer- 
ence thus far, and I desire that the re- 
marks which I may make may be under 
the inspiration of the same good Spirit. 
As I have often said in occupying this 
position, I desire only to ' say those 
things that shall be beneficial to those 
who listen as well as to myself. If 1 
know my heart, I believe I can in all 
truth testify that it is set upon the 
building up of the Church and Kingdom 
of God upon the earth. I desire above 
all things to know the mind and will 
of God concerning me as an individual; 
and after having learned that, I want 
the strength and the determination to 
carry the same out in my life. 

I was particularly impressed with 
the remarks of President Snow in the 
opening of our conference, referring to 
the man who, when he found a great 
treasure in the field, went and sold all 
he had that he might obtain it; or, 
when he discovered a pearl of great 
value, he sold all he had to secure it. 
While listening to his remarks I re- 
membered a letter which I have read 
in many of the wards and Stakes of 
Zion, and I may have read it in this 
building; but if I have, the sentiments 
therein contained, one sentence in par- 
ticular, have made such a profound im- 
pression upon my mind that I do not 



know that I can do better than to again 
read an extract from the letter, with 
the sincere prayer that it may find lodg- 
ment in your hearts. It was written 
to me by a gentleman with whom I 
have been acquainted from my child- 
hood. It is something over thirty 
years since I first knew him, and 
he has been a very dear friend 
of mine. I may say that, with 
the exception of my associates in the 
Church of Christ and my own relatives, 
there is no man living upon the earth 
today that has as warm a place in my 
heart and that I love as dearly as the 
man who wrote this letter. I do not know 
that he would care to have me mention 
his name; therefore I shall not do so; 
but I will state that at the time he 
wrote this letter he was the general 
manager for the United Kingdom of a 
corporation of over two hundred mil- 
lions of dollars; so you may know that 
he was a man of considerable experi- 
ence and importance in the business 
world. The letter was written to me 
from London: 

"My Dear Heber: 

"Tour very nice long letter of the 
10th came duly to hand. Of course, you 
know, aside from the long and intimate 
personal friendship we have had to- 
gether, how much I have always been 
impressed with the genuineness and 
sincerity of the religious feeling among 
the men and women who hold your 
faith. Many times and oft I have said, 
in conversation, that the only religious 
people I ever knew who lived up to 
their professions, were the Mormons of 
Utah. And this is true." 

I am indeed grateful that my friend 
has not access to the list of non-tithe- 
payers, amounting to ten thousand, be- 
cause I doubt very much if then he 
could say "that the only religious peo- 
ple I ever knew who lived up to their 
professions, were the Mormons of Utah." 
I am grateful that the Mormons with 
whom this man became acquainted were 
not only Mormons in name, but that 
they were in very deedLatter-day Saints. 
He gained his opinion of all "Mormons" 
by those with whom he became ac- 
quainted; and I have often said in pub- 
lic that I regard it as the duty of every 
Latter-day Saint to so order his life 
that his conduct will inspire all people 
with respect for him, and thereby cre- 
ate respect for the entire people. It is 



i-2 



GENERAL, CONFERENCE. 



In keeping with the teachings of our 
Savior to let our light so shine, that 
men, seeing our good works, will glori- 
fy God and be led to embrace the Gos- 
pel of Jesus Christ. 

"This it is that inspires respect, 
even when there is a total absence 
of a belief in the doctrines. Your peo- 
ple carry their beliefs into daily life, 
and act as if they think there is some- 
thing in them. If I had the belief to 
start with, I cannot see how as a sen- 
sible person I could do otherwise." 

Now, here is the sentence that I de- 
sire impressed upon your minds indel- 
libly: 

"If there is anything [and my friend 
draws a big black line under 'anything'] 
in a belief which involves an eternity 
of future existence, there is everything 
[and my friend draws another black 
line under 'everything.']" 

Do we as Latter-day Saints believe 
this? Do we appreciate the force of 
my friend's remark? "If there is any- 
thing in a belief which involves an 
eternity of future existence, there is 
everything." Are we convinced that 
there is everything in this belief that 
involves an eternity of future exis- 
tence? And do we, as our friend says 
we do, carry our beliefs into daily life, 
and act as if we do think there is 
something in them? Or are we making 
pretensions? Are we like the salt that 
has lost its savor, that is henceforth 
good for nothing, but to be cast out and 
trodden under foot of men. My friend 
continues: 

"Now, I have given you my own sin- 
cere thought. The fact that I have no 
Buch conviction is evidenced by the fact 
that I am agnostic on such questions, 
as shown by my own actions." 

[f we are to take that standard — what 
Is shown by the actions — then there 
are thousands of Latter-day Saints who 
are agnostics. And that is the standard 
of Jesus Christ. It is the only stand- 
trd by which we will stand or fall. 

"Still I never attempt to proselyte on 
behalf of non-belief; and the last thing 
[ would do, is to disturb those who be- 
lieve in a theory which I don't; and I 
wont argue In defense of my own lack 
of believing. 

"I think, Heber, I have expressed 
about these views to your mother 
many years ago." 

This man, as I have said, is a 
friend of mine, and he has shown 



his friendship by his actions— 
a friendship which I doubt very 
much I could have experienced from 
many of the Latter-day Saints, if they 
had been put to the test. In the panic 
of 1893, this man, learning of my fi- 
nancial distress, wrote me a letter and 
announced that it was impossible to 
borrow any money in San Francisco 
(where he was then located) upon ordi- 
nary securities, but that money was 
there to he loaned upon real estate. He 
said tuat he had no real estate except 
his home, but if the money from a 
mortgage piaced upon his home would 
save my financial life, he said, "tele- 
graph me upon receipt of this letter; 
do not wait to write, because delays 
are dangerous, and the money shall 
ccme to you by the first mail." I could 
not restrain my tears when I read that 
letter, lo think that God had given me 
sufficient of His Spirit whereby I had 
been enabled to so live that a man who 
was an agnostic, ana who had no hope 
beyond the grave, had been so im- 
pressed with the genuineness of my 
character and integrity that he was 
willing to risk his home to save my 
"financial life." What called forth this 
letter? My friend wrote to me from 
London, inquiring about my mother, 
about her sister, and about a number 
of other people with whom he was ac- 
quainted when he was a boarder in my 
mother's home, and wanting to know 
how they were getting along. Among 
others, he inquired regarding my cou- 
sin, Anthony W. Ivins; and I wrote 
and told him of the sacrifices that he 
had made, in selling his property and 
moving to a foreign country. With re- 
gard to those sacrifices, I remarked that 
he had gone because of a call he had 
received, without any earthly hope of 
reward, and I said; "You see that we 
Mormons go where we are sent, with- 
out regard to the profits that may 
come to us." This called forth the let- 
ter I have read in your hearing. Thai 
man, to my knowledge, many yean 
ago, was the instrument in the hand! 
of God, in connection with anothei 
friend of mine, of making for this peo. 
pie a friend of a man who was choser 
to govern this Territory, namely, Gov 
Axtell. He wrote to me that he caret

here imbued — "filled full," is the ex- 
pression in the letter — with his ideas of 
the "Mormons." He said: "He is my 
friend, and I know what kind of a peo- 
ple you are, and he comes there be- 
lieving as I believe." 

I maintain that it is the duty of 
every Latter-day Saint to so order his 
life that every man will believe he is 
honest and sincere. I was in Phoenix, 
Arizona, some years ago, with Apostle 
John Henry Smith. We were preach- 
ing, by request, in the opera house 
there, and one of the good sisters over- 
heard the following compliment 
(though some might consider it very 
doubtful) paid me while I was speak- 
ing. A man said, "Well, that man is a 
pretty red hot talker, and seems quite 
earnest." Pretty soon he exclaimed, 
"I'll be damned if that fellow don't 
talk earnest." Not many minutes 
passed, and he said, "I'll be damned if 
I don't believe that fellow believes what 
he is saying." Now, if we can impress 
every person with whom we come in 
contact that we are honest, then we 
have done something towards impres- 
sing them with the honesty of all the 
people. I prize very highly a letter 
that I got from a friend that was man- 
aging a large corporation when I was 
made an Apostle. He said, "Well, I al- 
ways thought that the Mormon leaders 
were frauds, but now that they have 
chosen you I have changed my opin- 
ion; for I know you are honest, and 
they must be, or they would not dare 
have you in their counsels." 

You will pardon me, I trust, for these 
personal allusions. They say that per- 
sonalities sometimes are calculated to 
impress a lesson more vividly upon the 
hearts of the people than any other 
kind of teaching. I do know that God 
lives. I do know that Jesus is the 
Christ. I do know that Joseph Smith 
was a Prophet of God. I do know that 
we are engaged in the work of God. I 
do know that there is an eternity of 
future happiness in store for every Lat- 
ter-day Saint that keeps the command- 
ments of God. The Savior said: 

"He that hath my commandments, 
and keepeth them, he it is that loveth 
me: and he that loveth me shall be 
loved of my Father, and I will love 
him, and will manifest myself to 
him." 



This promise is not made to us, only* 
upon the condition of keeping the com- 
mandments of God. The Savior also 
said: 

"Whosoever heareth these sayings of 
mine, and doeth them, I will liken him 
unto a wise man, which built his house 
upon a rock: 

"And the rain descended, and the 
floods came, and the winds blew, and 
beat upon that house; and it fell not: 
for it was founded upon a rock. 

"And everyone that heareth these 
sayings of mine, and doeth them not, 
shall be likened unto a foolish man, 
which built his house upon the sand: 

"And the rain descended, and the 
floods came, and the winds blew, and 
beat upon that house; and it fell: and 
great was. the fall of it." 

We find here in the very first sec- 
tion of the Book of Doctrine 
and Covenants teachings to us as 
Latter-day Saints, and many of us do 
not remember them. 

"And the arm of the Lord shall be 
revealed; and the day cometh that they 
who will not hear the voice of the 
Lord, neither the voice of his servants 
neither give heed to the words of the 
prophets and apostles, shall be cut off 
from among the people; 

"For they have strayed from mine or- 
dinances, and have broken mine ever- 
lasting covenant; 

"They seek not the Lord to establish 
his righteousness, but every man 
walketh in his own way, and after the 
image of his own God, whose image is 
in the likeness of the world, and whose 
substance is that of an idol, which 
waxeth old and shall perish in Baby- 
lon, even Babylon the great, which shall 
fall." 

Are we seeking our own mind and 
will? Do we believe as Apostle Tay- 
lor said, that we should subject our 
mind and will to the will of God? Are 
we breaking the everlasting covenant? 
In this same revelation the Lord also 
says: 

"And verily I say unto you, that they 
who go forth bearing these tidings 
unto the inhabitants of the earth, to 
them is power given to seal both on 
earth and in heaven, the unbelieving 
and rebellious; 

"Yea, verily, to seal them up unto 
the day when the wrath of God shall be 
poured out upon the wicked without 
measure; 

"Unto the day when the Lord shall 
come to recompense unto every man 
according to his work, and measure to 
every man according to the measure 
which he has measured to his fellow 
man." 

"For I, the Lord, cannot look upon

sin with the least degree of allowance; 

"Nevertheless, he that repents and 
does the commandments of the Lord 
shall be forgiven; 

"And he that repents not, from him 
shall be taken even the light which he 
has received, for my Spirit shall not 
always strive with man, saith the Lord 
of Hosts." 

"Search these commandments, for 
they are true and faithful, and the 
prophecies and promises which are in 
them shall all be fulfilled. 

"What I the Lord have spoken, I 
have spoken, and I excuse not myself; 
and though the heavens and the earth 
pass way, my word shall not pass 
away, but shall all be fulfilled, whether 
by mine own voice or by the voice of 
my servants, it is the same; 

"For behold, and lo, the Lord is God, 
and the Spirit beareth record, and the 
record is true, and the truth abideth 
forever and ever." 

As Latter-day Saints we are told lo 
search these commandments, for they 
are true and faithful. 

My friends, my brethren and my sis- 
ters, I leave with you my testimony 
that God lives, that Jesus is the Christ, 
that Joseph Smith was a Prophet of 
God. I leave with you my testimony 
that only by keeping the command- 
ments of God will you be saved. I say 
unto you, be honest with God. Never 
make a dollar in the world but you pay 
your tithing on it. Observe the Word 
of Wisdom. Keep the commandments 
of Almighty God, and you will be 
raved. In bidding you good-bye to go 
to a foreign land to preach the Gospel, 
I wish to go with your faith. I desire 
to be remembered in your homes night 
and morning. I love the Latter-day 
Saints. I love to labor for the ad- 
vancement of the kingdom of God. I 
know that He lives. I have reached 
out my hand and plucked the fruit of 
the Gospel, and I know that the Gospel 
tree is alive and bears fruit. I de- 
light to labor for the spread of the Gos- 
pel, and I thank God for the privilege 
of going to introduce the Gospel to a 
nation that has been in darkness. I 
nope and pray that in the providence 
of God there is a great labor to be ac- 
complished. I pray in humility that I 
may go forth with the faith and the 
prayers of the Saints to accomplish all 
that God desires I should do. I leave 
my blessing with the Latter-day Saints, 
and I do it in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen.

AFTERNOON SESSION. 
The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn which begins: 

"Our God we raise to Thee, 
Thanks for Thy blessings free." 

Prayer was offered by Elder Angus 
M. Cannon. 
Singing by the choir: 

"Softly beams the sacred dawning, 
Of the great millennial morn, 

And to Saints gives welcome warning', 
That the day is hastning on." 

ELDER GEORGE TEASDALE. 

The world seems to prefer falsehood to truth— 
The testimony of Jesus— Necessity for moial 
courage— T.ie law of tithing— The Saints a 
loyal people. 

I have rejoiced exceedingly at this 
Conference in the testimony of my 
brethren, and I have thought, What 
are the people of the world think- 
ing of? Have they eyes, but see. 
not; ears, but hear not; and hearts, 
but understand not? I wonder 
why it is that the inhabitants 
of the earth prefer falsehood to light 
and truth. I remember that, in England, 
they had a play at one of the theaters, 
called "The Danites" — a most infamous 
thing, calculated to prejudice the minds 
of the people against the unpopular 
Latter-day Saints. I noticed the other 
day that in the refined, aristocratic city 
of Boston they are enjoying a play 
termed "The Mormon Wife." Is any- 
body justified in rejecting the truth 
because of the scandals circulated 
against the Latter-day Saints? I under- 
stand that all men and women are 
their own agents; and I do not know 
a worse degree of slavery than to be 
afraid to think for yourself and speak 
what you believe. I wonder how many 
of this congregation would be present 
today if the Latter-day Saints had been 
moral cowards. But they are men and 
women who desire to think for them- 
selves. Many were raised in the pop-

ular religions of the day, and came 
out of them and took up the cross of 
Christ.by obeying the doctrine of Christ 
as taught in His Church. They turned 
from the worship of the unknown God 
to the worship of the true and living 
God. They acknowledged the atone- 
ment of Christ, repented of their sins, 
were buried with Christ in baptism, 
thereby obtaining the efficacy of the 
sanctifying power of the precious blood 
of Christ, and received the Holy Ghost, 
through the laying on of hands. 

Every Conference where the Twelve 
Apostles have been they have 
borne their testimony that they know 
Joseph Smith was a true Prophet sent 
of God. How do they know it? Be- 
cause they have accepted the doctrine 
of the Savior, taught by His authority. 
We bear testimony that the authority 
of God is restored to the earth. The 
Priesthood of Melchisedek, after the 
order of the Son of God, and the Priest- 
hood after the order of Aaron have 
been restored; and the Gospel is be- 
ing preached in all the world for a wit- 
ness, by divine authority. The word 
of the Lord is unto all people, Repent 
and be baptized, and obgy the Gospel, 
worship the living and the true God, 
and you shall have a living witness that 
He lives, and that Jesus is the Christ. 
That was the message which came unto 
me years ago. I accepted it. I sought 
the Lord, and He answered me; and 
from the day I obeyed this Gospel down 
to the present time I have had a living 
witness concerning the truth of this 
work. 

Now, what is the. use of being an 
idolater? What is the use of being led 
by priestcraft and false tradition? 
What will be the outcome of all such, 
when men have the opportunity to obey 
the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ, to 
become the children of the Father by 
adoption, and to be taught of Him? Our 
beloved brother, John W. Taylor, this 
morning spoke of the necessity of reve- 
lation. Why, "the things of God know- 
eth no man, but the Spirit of God." 
"Neither knoweth any man the Father, 
save the Son, and he to whomsoever 
the Son will reveal Him." "I am not 
ashamed of the Gospel of Christ," said 
the ancient Apostle, "for it is the pow- 
■er of God unto salvation. * * For 



therein is the righteousness of God re- 
vealed from faith to faith." If it were 
essential for Peter to have a revela- 
tion from Almighty God to know that 
Jesus was the Christ, is it not essential 
that every man and woman should have 
the same opportunity, we all being the 
children of God, and He being no re- 
specter of persons? I often wonder 
what excuse men and women will give 
the Almighty when they pass behind 
the vail, who have lived in the midst 
of the Latter-day Saints, who have 
heard the doctrine of Christ as 
taught by the Latter-day Saints, and 
have seen the temples of God, in which 
the ordinances of the Gospel are per- 
formed for the living and the dead by 
the authority of God and the power of 
an everlasting priesthood. My friends, 
what excuse are you going to give to 
the Almighty? His ears are open to 
your cry, as they have been to ours, if 
you are honest and desire to know the 
truth. The Lord has said, Look unto 
me. What is to hinder you from doing 
so? "If any of you lack wisdom, let 
him ask of God, that giveth to all men 
liberally, and upbraideth not; and it 
shall be given him." Is it possible that 
you have no faith in the living and true 
God, your Creator, and in the principle 
of revelation? If so, it is a bad condi- 
tion to be in. That is my private opin- 
ion, publicly expressed. I am afraid it 
is like I once heard a gentleman say in 
Virginia. We had been preaching the 
Gospel and bearing a faithful testimony 
to the people, under the power and in- 
fluence of the Holy Spirit; and at the 
close a gentleman said, "There is no 
doubt that these men have the scrip- 
tures on their side, but it would never 
do to belong to them, for they are so 
dreadfully unpopular." But what ex- 
cuse will you give to the Lord for not 
receiving the message of the Gospel 
that we declare unto you? Will you say 
that you were moral cowards? 

We want no cowards in our band 
Who will their colors fly; 
We call for valiant-hearted men, 
Who are not afraid to die. 

Do you not sing that? Are they not 
your sentiments? If not, how came you 
to be Latter-day Saints? When I heard 
this Gospel it was threatenings, threat- 
enings all the time. I was told what

calamities would come upon me, and 
maybe death, if I associated with these 
unpopular people. Thank God for the 
courage He gave me to embrace the 
Gospel, contrary to the counsel of all 
my friends'. Why, our Master was un- 
popular. He was an innovator, be- 
cause He told the truth; and we are 
innovators, because we tell the truth. 
Our testimony is true, and those who 
accept the Gospel at our hands bear 
witness that it is true, because they re- 
ceive the recompense of reward. No 
man ever embraced the Gospel of 
Christ with a broken heart and con- 
trite spirit, and lived its principles, 
who was disappointed or found fault 
with it; but the closer he lived to its 
principles the more of the power of God 
he had. 

Now, our beloved brother, George Q. 
Cannon, is lying sick unto death per. 
haps. He is an object lesson to the 
nations. He has traveled extensive- 
ly. He took these glad tidings of great 
joy to the house of Israel in the Sand- 
wich Islands. He went down "below 
all things." Then he has represented 
the people in the halls of Congress. And 
no man or woman could ever say of 
George Q. Cannon that he was any- 
thing but a gentleman. Take all our 
leaders — President Joseph Smith. 
President Brigham Young, President 
John Taylor, President Wilford Wood- 
ruff, President Lorenzo Snow — and they 
are the highest type of intelligence; 
men who have known no fear. God has 
given them a testimony, and that testi- 
mony is before the world. Because the 
people are unpopular is no excuse foi 
not embracing the Gospel. The Lord 
Jesus Christ said, "In me ye shall have 
peace; but in the world, tribulation." 
We have had plenty of tribulation; but 
the Lord has sustained us through it all 
the time. I know He has sustained me 
in my weakness, and has made me 
strong when I have been weak. He has 
come to my aid and enabled me to 
discharge my duty. So with my breth- 
ren. I remember, in 1868, when I was 
called upon a mission to the British 
Isles, I had an impression that I would 
never return. I remember speaking to 
President Heber C. Kimball. He made 
some remark to me, and said. "Boy, 



do you hear that?" I said, "Yes, sir." 
"Well," he said, " I want you to re- 
member it, for you will not see me 
again." That confirmed the impression 
I had, (I never thought of him dy- 
ing), and the agony I passed through 
when I left my wife and three chil- 
dren to go on that mission, no 
man knows, except he has gone through 
it himself; but by the grace of 
God I was enabled to say, "It does not 
matter to me whether I ever come back 
or not; the Lord has called me on this 
mission, and by His grace I am going 
to fulfill it." I never could have done it 
only by the grace of God, and to Him 
be all the glory. In other circum- 
stances and at other times, when my 
life has been in danger, He has sus- 
tained me so that I did not flinch. 
Glory be to Him, not to His weak, un- 
worthy servant! 

These are evidences to me that it is 
the Lord's work, and no man-made 
system. It is the "Marvelous work and 
a wonder" that is being performed by 
our Father in heaven. All glory to His 
holy name that we have the privilege 
of being associated with it! I am 
thankful beyond expression. Our lead- 
ers are just men, upright and honest 
men. They are devoted to the estab- 
lishment of the righteousness of God 
upon the earth. They are natural gen- 
tlemen and gentlewomen, who have the 
spirit of this work, and who labor for 
the accomplishment of the purposes of 
the Almighty, that His righteousness 
may be established upon the earth. O 
my beloved brethren and sisters, how 
much we owe to our Father in heaven, 
that in our lowly condition He brought 
us to these glorious vales of the moun- 
tains, as predicted by the Psalmist: 

"O that men would praise the Lord 
for his goodness, and for his wonderful 
works to the children of men! 

"Let the redeemed of the Lord say 
so, whom He hath redeemed from the 
hand of the enemy; 

"And gathered them out of the lands 
from the east, and from the west, from 
the north, and from the south." 

Just think of it! that we should live 
to fulfil that, and to be associated witn 
this "marvelous work and a wonder." 
Then there are so many opportunities 
given unto us to assist in this work. 
There is plenty of room for all, male 



ELDER GEORGE TEASDALE. 



37 



and female, who desire to labor for the 
glory of God. But the Lord has said 
that those who assist in this work 
should be full of love, having faith, 
hope and charity, being temperate 
in all things, trusting in the Lord, and 
doing good. 

I have noticed that since we have been 
more faithful in the payment of our 
tithes and offerings the Spirit of the 
Lord has increased in the hearts of the 
people. This is a very light thing that 
He requires of us — one in ten. I some- 
times ask a little boy, if his father 
should give him ten apples and then 
ask for one-tenth to be returned to him, 
how many would he give. Why 5 one, he 
says. Then do you mean to tell me that 
grown people do not know what a 
tenth means? "Of all that thou shalt 
give me," said Jacob of old, "I will sure- 
ly give the tenth unto thee." Are we 
doing it? If we are not, what is our 
justification? The Lord requires it of 
the widow as of the millionaire. He re- 
quires of His people one-tenth of all that 
He blesses them with, and also that 
they should be considerate to the widow 
and the fatherless. "Pure religion and 
undeflled before God and the Father is 
this, To visit the fatherless and widows 
in their affliction, and to keep himself 
unspotted from the world." We have 
nothing to do with the world, except to 
preach the Gospel to them. When you 
desire to pattern after the world and 
come under their influence and domin- 
ion, you are on the wrong side. "Come 
out of her, my people, that ye be not 
partakers of her sins, and that ye re- 
ceive not of her plagues." Do we want 
to be plagued? Do we want to be con- 
sumed with the brightness of the com- 
ing of the Son of God? The Lord hath 
said that those who are tithed shall not 
be burned at His coming. Those that 
rob Him in tithes and offerings shall 
become as ashes under his feet. Do you 
want to be in that condition? 

I would like to encourage all men to 
be kind to themselves, and to worship 
the living and true God. Come out of 
your broken cisterns, that hold no wa- 
ter; cease your idolatrous practices and 
the worship of an imaginary God, with- 
out body, parts or passions; and come 
to the light of the glorious Gospel of the 
Son of God. We have done this, 



and I tell you it is glorious. 
There is nothing under the hea- 
vens more valuable than the 
fellowship of the Spirit of God. Do you 
not want it? Humble yourselves be- 
fore the Lord. "Blessed are the meek, 
for they shall inherit the earth. 
Blessed are they that hunger and 
thirst after righteousness; for they shall 
be filled." The Lord has made it pos- 
sible for us to assist in the establish- 
ment of His righteousness upon the 
earth, and to enjoy the pure happiness 
there is in the practice of righteous- 
ness. There is nothing that gives great- 
er happiness than the doing of the will 
of God. And who is to judge us? Who 
can tell whether we have these princi- 
ples or whether we have not? Only 
those who embrace them; only those 
who hear the word of God and do it. That 
is the only way in which you can ob- 
tain a testimony. I am frequently 
asked why it is that tourists and visi- 
tors to this city cannot go into the 
temple of the Lord; for they are so 
curious to know what is done there. 
Why, you can all obtain admission into 
that temple. How? By obeying the 
Gospel, worshipping the living and true 
God and being worthy, through keep- 
ing His commandments, to enter there. 
What is it you do there? We perform 
ordinances for the living and the dead, 
we learn the ways of the Lord. It is 
all summed up in the covenant we made 
when we went down into the waters 
of baptism, that we would serve God 
and keep His commandments. That 
covenant covers all our after life. Then 
we should be what we profess. I say 
to our friends, Repent, and obey the 
Gospel; for Jesus Christ became the 
author of eternal salvation to all that 
obey him. It is decreed in the heaven 
of heavens that you must be born 
again. You must be born of water and 
of the Spirit, and you must be adopted 
into the Church of Christ by His au- 
thority. This is not difficult to under- 
stand, if you want to understand it. I 
knew a man who was engaged in the 
Liverpool office of the Church for 
twenty or thirty years, but never 
embraced the Gospel. He would 
talk about it, but never seemed 
to sense the necessity of doing 
the will of the Father. Well, I sup-

pose there are reasons why some people 
reject the Gospel, and why others ac- 
cept it. But those who accept it cer- 
tainly have the advantage, to the glory 
of God our eternal Father. We love 
Him. We are not hypocrites. "We do 
not teach false doctrine. We do not be- 
guile the people. At the same time we 
sustain our government, though we 
have been accused of not doing th:s. I 
think when a people are willing to give 
up one of the highest and most holy of 
their principles at the dictation of the 
government, it bears a testimony that 
cannot be impeached. More than that, 
when the government wanted our boys 
to help them defend or subdue, they 
were on hand. We believe in the gov- 
ernment; we believe in the Constitu- 
tion. Our lawyers, if they want to be 
loyal to God, should stand by that 
Constitution. Let this be a State that 
is under the blessing of Cod, and a firm 
supporter of the Constitution, that we 
may be an example to all people in jus- 
tice, truth, righteousness, and the pro- 
tection of life and property. The Lord 
did not inspire the fathers that wrote 
the Constitution for nothing. He knew 
that He was going to establish His 
Church upon this land. Had the inhab- 
itants of this land stood by that Con- 
stitution, the nation today would be 
much more prosperous than it is. The 
Lord has said that those who love Him 
and keep His commandments shall 
prosper, and it is the same with na- 
tions as with individuals. 

My beloved brethren and sisters, I 
praise the Lord that I have the privi- 
lege of being with you, an Elder in the 
Church, having a living testimony con- 
cerning this work. I love my associ- 
ates. We know the value of President 
Snow. Ten years he presided over the 
quorum of Apostles. He schooled us, 
and made us better men through his 
glorious administration. If you Latter- 
day Saints will listen to the voice of 
the Lord, I will promise you, in the 
name of my Master, that you shall 
prosper in the land, your enemies shall 
never overcome you, and you shall be 
able to establish the righteousness of 
God in the earth, to the glory of the 
Father, through Jesus Christ. Amen. 



ELDER JOHN HENRT SMITH. 

Failure to fulfil the law is in the nature of a re- 
volt — The way of deliverance and prosperity — 
Necessity of self-examination. 

Thus far in the conference the breth- 
ren who have spoken have received a 
most liberal portion of the Holy Spirit, 
and some absorbing thought has been 
expressed by each one, which has af- 
forded food for reflection. The wit- 
ness of the Spirit has followed their 
utterances. The manifest strength of 
President Snow in the opening of the 
conference, the clearness of his voice, 
the fulness of his words, gave to every 
person present an assurance that the 
head of this great organization, (the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints), was receiving help from the 
proper source. As each one of the 
brethren has taken his place upon this 
platform and --given utterance to the 
words suggested by the Spirit of the 
Lord, there has been a renewal of that 
Spirit which rested upon our chief as 
he placed before us his thoughts, and 
congratulated the people upon the 
measure of improvement that had been 
exhibited in their efforts to apply in a 
practical way the principles of the 
Gospel. 

The words of truth as they have 
fallen from the lips of our brethren 
have pointed out very clearly to our 
minds the fact that our Father was not 
afraid to tell us the truth, to give us 
credit for the efforts we have legitim- 
ately made, and to clearly expose to 
our own view our lack of fidelity and 
faithfulness in the performance of our 
part. The Spirit has portrayed before 
our minds the necessity that exists for 
testing each one of us. We have been 
informed that there are many who have 
been registered with the Latter-day 
Saints through the waters of baptism, 
and in many instances have been or- 
dained to the Priesthood and been made 
partakers of the various callings and 
obligations that attach thereto, have 
been unmindful of their sacred coven- 
ants. 

It has not been the weakness 
of the flesh alone that has stood 
in the way of their development. 
All of us are possessed of many weak- 
nesses: we have received an assur-

ance that they would be forgiven us if 
our fidelity to the Gospel should be 
fixed and established. It cannot be 
charged as a weakness that men and 
women to whom the truth has come 
are not tithepayers in the Church of 
Christ. It may be through a weakness 
that a man may sometimes tell that 
which is untrue? It may be weakness 
that exhibits itself in our lives when 
sometimes we drink ardent spirits and 
by that means lose our judgment, and 
possibly are drawn away from our 
moorings? But the continued and per- 
sistent neglect of a requirement such 
as is placed upon those that have been 
made partakers of the Gospel in its 
fulness, to pay their tithing, ceases 
to be a weakness. It becomes in its 
nature a direct revolt against an ab- 
solute commandment of God, designed 
to establish us in the generous and 
considerate fulfillment of providing for 
the development of the work of God 
and our own well being, and registering 
ourselves as willing to utilize that 
which Providence shall place in our 
hands as worldy means for the better- 
ment of our fellow creatures and the 
dispensing of the word of God among 
the children of men, in the building up 
and beautifying of Zion, in the extend- 
ing of her borders, and in carrying for- 
ward that work of His in the way de- 
signed by Him, as well as in an ex- 
hibition on our part that we hold no 
worldly goods above His work. While 
we may fall down under the tempta- 
tion of the moment, passion may gov- 
ern us briefly, and we may make this 
error, yet when the years come and 
go and Elders of the Church, holding 
the Priesthood of the Son of God, are 
not enrolled upon His records — upon 
the record of the Lamb's book of life, 
if you please— it is an evidence, not of 
a weakness, but of revolt against an 
absolute requirement of heaven. 

President Snow, in his efforts to 
maintain the dignity and honor of the 
work of the Lord in the world, when 
he came to the forefront as the 
chosen leader of the Saints, un- 
der the direct revelations of our 
heavenly Father, pointed out to us as a 
people that there had been upon our part 
a fearful lack of earnestness and devo- 
tion, as written in the books. He 



pointed the way of freedom from the 
trammels that were holding us down. 
He pointed to us the way, not alone of 
the avoidance of dishonor and disgrace 

by unpaid bills on the part of the 
Church itself, "_| t the way of freedom 
also for the Elders of the Church who 
had gone beyond the proper limits in 
their own business concerns. He said 

that their liberty, their hope lay in 
turning to the Lord, and seeking by 
earnestness and devotion to utilize their 
powers, by paying their just dues and 
being placed upon that record from 
which every member of this Church its 
to be judged. By fixing in their own 
souls the thought that this is the test 
law which the Almighty has estab- 
lished, and if you will fulfill that obliga. 
tion rightly, your own trammels will 
be relieved, your own burdens will be 
lightened, the sunlight of the Spirit 
shall descend in richness upon you. The 
efforts of those who would retard your 
progress and bar the advancement of 
the cause of Christ will be futile. The 
hands of your enemies will be weak- 
ened, the light and inspiration of truth 
will mark the way for you to indeed 
become that conquering host which our 
Father in heaven has decreed you shall. 
This is not to be done in the spirit of 
hate, nor in malice directed against any 
of our fellow creatures, but in the spir- 
it of independence and love, tempered 
by that legitimate humility that would 
lead every man and woman conversant 
with the principles of the Gospel and 
the spirit of this work to sense fully 
the nature of the great mission that is 
theirs. We should not fail to sense that 
this world is before us, with the design 
of God who sent us here; that it is our 
world, if you please; not a world 
to be conquered by the sword, not a 
world to be conquered by the spirit of 
hate, not a world to be subdued simply 
to satisfy the ambitions of men and 
give them place in connection with it 
and its development, but a world to be 
brought into subjection to Almighty 
God through the cross of Christ and 
through the principles of love enunciat- 
ed by Him and revealed anew in the 
day and age in which we live; that no 
matter what may come, our own hearts 
purged by the requirements of our God, 
we would indeed utilize the worldly

means that that Father gave us to pro- 
vide for the accomplishment of His 
purpose, as far as we had the power; 
that the hand which He chose to hold 
within its grasp the elements of power 
should not be paralyzed by our failure 
to place within that hand, so far as we 
possess the capability, the sinews of 
war that should enable him in any and 
every field where His purposes required 
a work to be done, to accomplish that 
work. He congratulated you upon the 
wonders that have been accomplished, 
and yet there are wonders still to be 
accomplished. 

You have been flattered that you 
were the best people in the world. I 
hope, my brethren and sisters, that 
each man and each woman will look in- 
to the inmost recesses of their own 
hearts, weigh the conditions of the duty 
imposed by the Almighty upon them, 
and ask themselves the question, as the 
cold investigation is made, Is this 
statement of our brethren correct, so 
far as we are concerned? Words of 
flattery, it is true, sometimes drop 
sweeter upon our ears than words of 
reproof. We bear illy sometimes the 
words of reproof, and especially if we 
have been in violation of some require- 
ment or law of God. But when we look 
into the recesses of our own hearts, or 
examine the record of our own deeds, 
are the words of commendation that 
are spoken to us as a body merited by 
each one of us? As I have sat in the 
presence of my associates and listened 
to their good words of coun- 
sel and commendation, their 
words of censure, I have 
sought to put myself on the rack, to 
examine myself. I wish that I could 
feel that I had fulfilled as thoroughly 
the work the Almighty has given me to 
do in connection with you as I should 
have done? But while I was examining 
myself I wondered if all of us were un- 
dergoing the same examination, and if 
so, we had determined that with the 
help of God under the inspiration of His 
Spirit as it came from the lips of His 
servant, we would be tithepayers, we 
would be exemplars in every walk of 
life, so far as we had the power. While 
some little weakness might overtake 
us, we would not register ourselves as 
in revolt against any proposition that 



Almighty God had laid upon us as a 
duty that we should discharge. We 
might miss for a brief season the pay- 
ment of tithes, but the years should 
not come and go and our names not be 
found on the records of the judge of the 
house of Israel; that the days and the 
months should not pass by and we 
utilize our means with which Provi- 
dence blesses us without being mindful 
of that aid that we should give for the 
furtherance of the purposes of that 
Father who had given us the right to 
the receipt of His Priesthood, or who 
had permitted us, if we had not at- 
tained this, to enter the sacred door 
of the waters of baptism and receive 
the baptism of water and of fire and 
the Holy Ghost, while hundreds and 
thousands around us as good as we, 
so far as their lives are concerned, as 
earnest as we in that which they deem 
right, and in many instances much 
more liberal than we, and yet by some 
condition that can scarcely be explained 
remain aloof from the consoling and 
convincing influence of that Spirit that 
comes from on high. 

But yesterday in passing from this 
building to my own home, I met a gen- 
tleman whose friendship I appreciate 
very highly, not a member of our 
Church; a man that I believe to be in 
the business world a man of perfect 
honor and integrity, a moral man. I 
met him upon the sidewalk. I put my 
arm around his shoulders, and said to 
him, "My friend, I believe I have the 
prize of prizes, that has been given of 
God to our Father's children. You and 
I have met in the business world for 
years and years; your treatment of me 
has been the treatment of a gentleman; 
I have respected and do respect you as 
a man of honor." "He says, "I have 
been a moral man, Mr. Smith, but I 
have not been a religious man, in the 
sense in which you religious men some- 
times speak." Said I, "Look here, by 
and by this race will be run, and you 
and I will be on the other side. I do not 
want you to say to me on the other 
side, 'Mr. Smith, in that sphere yonder, 
you had the prize of prizes, and you 
never offered me an understanding of 
it.' I want to ask you as a matter of 
friendship — for I believe that I have the 
truth— that you will make it in your

way to visit the religious services of the 
Latter-day Saints. Seek to receive of 
their spirit and to comprehend that 
which they are engaged in." He prom- 
ised me that he would, and I believe he 
will. As to the impressions that the 
Almighty may make upon his mind as 
he shall listen to the words that may 
be spoken by the Elders of the Church, 
it is not for me to determine. His spirit 
must be in that condition that the 
spirits of some of you were in in times 
past when you drank in of the truth; 
but if his spirit does drink in of the 
truth, I believe him to be of that mould 
that means and abilities would be util- 
ized by him for the accomplishment of 
that which in his honor he believed was 
true. I think that many of the Latter- 
day Saints are discrediting themselves 
in their neglect of that which the Mas- 
ter has placed within their reach by a 
failure to meet these obligations and to 
have their names registered by the com- 
mon judge upon the records designated 
by the Almighty for preserving the evi- 
dence of the goodness of their hearts 
and their conversion to His truth. 

I see, my brethren and sisters, that 
my proportion of the time is gone, but 
standing before you with the full 
knowledge of the responsibility that at- 
taches to my chief as well as to my 
associates in connection with this 
work, I say to you, write your names 
in the Lamb's book of life; for it is 
the Lamb's book of life when you reg- 
ister yourself as a bestower of that 
which Providence places in your hands 
and give it into the hands of the par- 
ties designated by the Almighty to 
utilize that means for the extension and 
upbuilding of the Zion of our God. 
There is no requirement resting upon 
you to pay tithes upon somebody else's 
property or earnings; but the law of 
God to His people is that that which is 
yours, which comes into your hands 
each year, shall be tithed. He requires 
of His people that that witness for His 
truth shall be registered by the pay- 
ment of tithes and offerings; and no 
man or woman that fails and continues 
to fail in this duty can be in any other 
condition in connection w'ith the work 
of God except in open revolt. The miss- 
ing for a season may be a lack of judg- 
ment, maybe a fault, but when it con- 



tinues without limit, that man or thai 
woman has rejected in his or her soul 
the law that God has given. Theit 
names will disappear in connection with 
our Father's work. 

Brethren and sisters, let us obey the 
commandments of our Father in 
heaven, register our names in His book, 
register our name in words of com- 
fort and advice, guiding, as far as we 
may have the power, our fellow man to 
an understanding of the truth. Let us 
ever remember that these sons and 
daughters of His, scattered throughout 
the world or mingling with us 
in our own homes, though not 
of our own faith, are His children, 
created in His likeness and in 
His image; and that while the 
truth has come to us, the responsi- 
bility in the receipt of that truth 
upon us is indeed great. Every word 
that can be spoken, every deed that 
shall turn the hearts of our fellows to 
our Maker, should be performed by us. 
That which we have embraced is in- 
deed the Gospel of the Lord Jesus 
Christ. We are indeed in the Church of 
Jesus Christ. Our mission is the puri- 
fying of God's children in all the world. 
He who fails to perform his part in this 
ministry, after having been made a par- 
taker of the heavenly gifts, will find 
himself outside of the holy communion, 
and the blessings in store for our Fath- 
er's children. I pray for our country 
and its good; for the development of 
that truth which our Father has given 
us; for the spirit of hate to be ban- 
ished; for the spirit of love to reign su- 
preme among this people; and that in 
their love of mankind they shall be en- 
abled to turn indeed "the hearts of the 
fathers to the children and the hearts 
of the children to the fathers," extend- 
ing not alone unto that future time, but 
encompassing all the good that will be 
saved upon this earth in the flesh in the 
day and time we are acting among 
them. I know that the Gospel is true; 
that His Priesthood and power is 
among the children of men; that it has 
been given to man, "never again to be 
taken from the earth nor given to an- 
other people," but to be established, 
carried from land to land, from clime to 
clime, to be preached to every nation,

to every kindred, to every tongue, and 
to every people, that they to whom the 
message comes through the ministra- 
tions; of God the Father and His Holy 
Son may fulfill their destiny and be 
crowned with His approval, because 
they obeyed His laws. Amen. 

ELDER C. W. PENROSE. 

Mankind in the image of God-Every soul is im- 
mortal—Obedience to law essential to salva- 
tion -.Universal redemption — Glory to be 
regulated by merit. 

This is a most magnificent sight to 
me. When I looked upon the congre- 
gation this afternoon and saw the un- 
covered heads of both brethren and 
sisters, I thought of the saying of 
Scripture, that God made man in his 
own image, "in the image of God creat- 
ed He him; male and female created He 
them." I also thought of one remark 
made by President Snow in his open- 
ing address, that every one of us is 
immortal, that the spiritual part of 
our being is the offspring of God, and 
no matter how long we may have ex- 
isted before we came into the world, or 
what is the mystery of our origin, we 
are immortal beings, and while ages 
go and come and changes will take 
place in the worlds that God has creat- 
ed and in the beings who inhabit them, 
that we shall live on forever and ever, 
and there will be no end to our exis- 
tence and to the development of the 
powers that exist within us as the sons 
and daughters of God. What a grand 
and ennobling thought this is! that 
though we now are weak, clothed 
around with mortality, and subject to 
the infirmities of the flesh and the 
weaknesses that we have inherited 
through a long line of ancestry, who 
in many respects have transgressed the 
commandments of God — notwithstand- 
ing our frailties, and that with which 
we have to contend through our en- 
vironment and the influences of the 
past, all eternity is before us. There 
is no end to our existence, and there 
will be no end to our advancement. 
Every person upon whim I look in the 
congregation this afternoon is immort- 
al. There will be an opportunity in 
the ages to come, if we do not avail 
ourselves of them in the present, to 
learn the mind and will of our Eternal 



Father and to come into harmony with 
Him and with His divine purposes. But 
those who receive the truth in this life, 
who avail themselves of those oppor- 
tunities about which we have heard this 
afternoon, who receive the truth as it 
is in Christ Jesus, enlist under 
His banner, fight the good fight ,of 
faith and overcome, will obtain the 
crown in the kingdom of the Father, 
and forever and ever they will be in 
the advance of those who fail to ob- 
tain these blessings, who fail to be 
obedient to' the Lord and are not found 
worthy to inherit this "far more and 
eternal and exceeding weight of glo- 
ry" which those can attain to who 
obey the Gospel. That is the advantage 
of receiving the truth in this present 
state of existence. We obtain that 
much of a step in advance of those who 
do not receive the Gospel. 

It is very gratifying to us who de- 
sire the salvation of mankind, and 
whose work it is to labor for their up- 
lifting, who have been specially called 
of God and appointed to work under 
the Captain of our salvation for the re- 
demption of the whole human race, to 
know by the revelations of God that the 
time will come, in some future state of 
existence if not in this, when every soul 
that can be redeemed will be brought 
out of darkness and sorrow, and hell, 
and death, and be placed where they 
can enjoy existence, to glorify God and 
obey His commandments. We do not 
know how long it will take for some 
people to obtain this redemption. It 
is certain, however, that justice will 
claim its own. Our God is a merciful 
Being. His name is love. He is full 
of longsuffering, kindness and charity, 
and He desires the salvation of His 
children. But He governs Himself by 
law. His word is law. He lives by 
the precepts which He administers and 
reveals to others. We shall find that 
He sets the example, as Jesus Christ, 
His Son, our Elder Brother, did. 
Therefore there can be no salvation for 
the transgressor until he shall repent 
and be willing to be obedient. The 
laws of God are eternal; they are for- 
ever and ever; they are inflexible; and 
it is only by obedience to law that ex- 
altation can be secured. In this con- 
dition we are learning to be obedient to 



ELDER .CHARLES W. PENROSE.

law — such law as God has revealed; 
also to the wholesome rules and regu- 
lations that are established in the gov- 
ernments under which we may live. 

We have been divinely charged with 
the duty of obeying the law of the land 
as well as the laws of God. All 
peop'e must eventually be brought into 
obedience to law, in order to be saved; 
and their exaltation, their glory, their 
power and dominion, if they have any, 
will be in proportion to their obedience 
to those things that God reveals. He 
that cannot abide and obey the celes- 
tial law, cannot abide a celestial glory. 
That is written. It is the word of the 
Lord. If we desire to obtain the great 
salvation, if we desire to obtain the 
crown, in the presence of the Father, 
if we desire to have the gift of eternal 
lives (which means endless increase in 
power, dominion and glory forever), we 
must abide the conditions on which tlrs 
glory is predicated; we must be obe- 
dient to the divine commandments, and 
devoted to God. We must not only be 
baptized in water, but baptized into His 
Spirit, and into the spirit of obedience 
to Him in all things. He that is obe- 
dient in all things and overcometh all 
things, shall inherit. all things. All that 
the Father hath shall be given unto 
him. But if he will not be obedient, if 
he will not bow to the laws which en- 
title him to celestial glory, he must re- 
ceive that condition and that measure 
of glory in that kingdom the laws of 
which he is willing to obey. Therefore, 
we are told that there is also a ter- 
restrial glory and a telestial glory, and 
there is a kingdom that is not a king- 
dom of glory; and he that will not 
abide law, he that will not bow in 
obedience to the commandments of God, 
but seeks to become a law unto him- 
self, and altogether abideth in sin, can- 
not receive a kingdom of glory at all. 
There will be some who, because they 
are so self-willed and rebellious and 
stubborn in their acts, and will not 
yield to God or man, will be ban- 
ished from the presence of the Lord and 
the glory of His power. They will go 
into "outer darkness, where there is 
weeping and wailing and gnashing of 
teeth." How long? Until they learn 
obedience by the things which they 
suffer. 



Thanks be to God, the old crude idea 
of an everlasting hell of fire and brim- 
stone and torment, out of which there is 
no redemption, has been dispelled 
like the clouds of night by the light 
of the millennial morn which has shone 
forth from the presence of our Lord 
Jesus Christ, the Sun of righteousness. 
There will be an opportunity for all the 
sons and daughters of God— for they are 
immortal — at some time to come out 
of darkness, disobedience, sorrow, sin 
and suffering, and find some place 
where they can advance, and that ad- 
vancement will be forever; for they are 
the sons and daughters of God, and 
there is no end to their existence. They 
will all have life in some degree. But 
that promise of eternal life which Jesus 
Christ said should be given to those 
who are His at His coming— those who 
obey His commandments, those who en- 
list under His banner, those that are 
baptized into Christ and put on Christ 
will be fulfilled in every particular 
—they will inherit that glory which He 
promised, and the gift of eternal life, 
or eternal lives, will be given unto them. 

What is that, different from immor- 
tality? Mere existence is not "life," in 
its full significance. There are people 
who have an existence here, but some 
parts of their being are not developed. 
Some people live only for that which 
they eat and drink and wear, and that 
is the end of it with them. Others have 
their mental faculties and their intel- 
lectual powers developed; and some 
whose physical and intellectual powers 
are measurably developed are dead or 
asleep spiritually. They do not live 
fully, unless the spiritual part of their 
being is awakened and aroused apd is 
alive, susceptible to the influences that 
come from the Father. So in the eter- 
nal worlds. There will be immortality 
to all the sons and daughters of God, 
whether they are suffering for sin or 
have been redeemed; whether they are 
in the celestial, terrestrial or telestial 
worlds; but only those who attain to the 
celestial glory, and the power and do- 
minion and exaltation, and the gift of 
everlasting increase, wherein their pos- 
terity will be multiplied worlds without 
end, have the real gift of eternal life. 
All their powers will be developed to 
the full. They will pattern after the

works of their Eternal Father 
and their Elder Brother, while 
eternal ages roll along, and 
they will be in harmony and in 
communion with them, and will partici- 
pate with them in the glorious work 
of the extension of the universe and 
dominion of God throughout the vast 
domains of space; and while eternal 
ages go and come they will increase 
and multiply in light, in wisdom, in in- 
telligence, in knowledge, in power, and 
in glory, and the extent of their pos- 
sessions and dominions in the worlds 
that will be created will be from ever- 
lasting to everlasting. This is what 
you and I are striving to obtain, my 
brethren and sisters. One of the things 
to aid us in attaining to this great sal- 
vation is to labor for the salvation of 
others. 

I cannot prolong my remarks. The 
time has expired. I did not expect to 
be called upon to speak for a moment; 
but I can say this afternoon that I re- 
joice in this great work. In it are 
all my aims and ambitions, if I have 
any. I love it with all my soul. I de- 
sire to labor in it while I dwell on the 
earth, and when I pass away into the 
other world. I rejoice in the knowledge

that God has enlightened my soul and 
given me to understand the truth, to 
some extent at least, as it is in Him. I 
know this work is His, and that it will 
prevail. I know it will overcome all 
opposition, and stand and endure. I 
know it will bring about the salvation 
of the living and the redemption of the 
dead, and that all who are faithful and 
abide the conditions, by the power of 
God will be raised from the dead, and 
be clothed with the gift and power of

my brethren and sisters to treasure up 
in their hearts continually the words 
of eternal life, and to live by them, 
and bring these things down to the

ELDER F. M. LYMAN. 

The Spirit of God vs. the spirit of the world— The 
true aim and object in life — Remember the 
Lord in prosperous as well as adverse con- 
ditions— Kighteous character of the teachings 
of tue tlders— Greatness of the leaders of 
the Church. 

I may have some difficulty, my breth- 
ren and sisters, in making you hear, 
but trust you will be patient with me, 
and that the Lord will assist me in my 
effort. I have very greatly enjoyed 
the services in this conference, and I 
hope that the same good Spirit that 
has moved my brethren may be with 
us this morning. 

It is an inspiring sight to look upon 
the faces of ten thousand people, near- 
ly all of whom are of one faith. The 
Spirit of the Lord that accompanies 
this work accomplishes marvelous 
things in the hearts of the people. It 
gives to us new and addition- 
al sight, hearing and under- 
standing, so that we see, hear 
and understand as people in the 
world are unable to do. This work is of 
the Lord, and it is only understood and 
accomplished by the Spirit of the Lord. 
The natural man is unable to compre- 
hend it. It looks foolish and unreason- 
able to him, because it is beyond his 
comprehension. But to the simplest one 
who has repented and been baptized 
with water and with fire and the Holy 
Ghost, this work appears quite reason- 
able and natural. The hearts of the 



Latter-day Saints are becoming es- 
tablished and fixed in the service of the 
Lord, just in proportion to their de- 
votion and faithfulness in keeping the 
commandments of the Lord. It is the 
keeping of His commandments that de- 
termines that we are His followers and 
disciples. Unless we do keep His com- 
mandments, we are not His disciples, 
though we may bear the name. The 
only reason that there can be found to- 
day among the Latter-day Saints 
people who are not quite set- 
tled and established, not quite 
converted to all the princi- 
ples of the Gospel, is because after their 
repentance and baptism they have be- 
come backsliders, more or less indif- 
ferent, and have returned measurably 
to the ways and fashions of the world, 
so that they see and understand as the 
world does. 

It would be well for us who are here to- 
day, professing to be Latter-day Saints, 
to examine our own hearts, to discov- 
er whether we have really been work- 
ing as the Lord has required, or wheth- 
er we have been indifferent; whether 
our hearts have been set upon the 
things of the world, and whether we 
love the ways and the wealth of the 
world more than we love to serve the 
Lord. In partaking of the Sacrament 
we are enjoined, as the former-day 
Saints were, to examine ourselves. I 
would like to add to that the injunction 
that when we are about to pray night 
and morning, or secretly, and when we 
gather together in council and in wor- 
ship, we should examine ourselves, and 
never put our faces toward our heav- 
enly Father, in council or in worship, 
until we can do so with a firm deter- 
mination in our souls that we will serve 
Him with all our hearts. I would like 
us to be impressed with this earnest 
devotion and feeling in regard to the 
service of the Lord; for we are here for 
the purpose of serving Him, doing His 
bidding, and sustaining His servants 
who preside over us. It is a hard work 
that we have to perform. Therefore, it 
should be the object of our lives to have 
whatever we do tend to strengthen our 
own faith, and the faith of our families 
and kindred, to uphold the hands of the 
servants of the Lord, and to sustain 



46 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



and advocate the work of the Lord 
among men. It should be our aim to 
be that peculiar people which the Lord 
is determined to have in the earth — 
peculiar because we waive our own will 
for the will of the Lord, and hold our 
own selfish desires and personal prefer- 
ences subject to His requirements. Ev- 
ery Latter-day Saint should be just 
such a person as this, so that when we 
come together in a congregation of ten 
thousand, as we have this morning, we 
can be looked upon as a very peculiar 
company of people, united as no people 
' could possibly be united, only under 
the inspiration of the Holy Ghost. Here 
is a congregation whose hearts beat 
as a unit, with fai h in God, with 
one pulsation, and filled with the 
inspiration of the Lord. We see alike 
in regard to the authority of the Priest- 
hood and in regard to the ordinances 
of the Gospel. We are upright and con- 
scientious, and we are not weak in the 
faith. This is a congregation of men 
and women who are strong in the faith, 
who are devoted to the Lord, who live 
in the light of His countenance, and 
who attend to the law which the Lord 
has given requiring one-tenth of our 
interest annually. If Latter-day Saints 
neglect this law of tithing, they are 
faulty, and lack oil in their lamps. The 
Lord requires His people to bow the 
knee before Him every night and morn- 
ing, and to remember Him in their se- 
cret prayers. Every Latter-day Saint 
who neglects this requirement has not 
that supply of oil which is necessary to 
prepare him for the coming of the Son 
of man. . The Lord requires us to be 
obedient to the counsels of the Priest- 
hood, and to look to them for counsel. 
Every Latter-day Saint who is obdur- 
ate in his feelings and will not listen to 
the counsels of the servants of the Lord 
shows a lack of oil. The Lord requires 
that we shall meet together on the fast 
day, fasting, praying, and remembering 
our offerings for the relief of the poor. 
Every Latter-day Saint who follows his 
daily avocation and neglects this duty 
shows a lack of oil. The Lord requires 
us to love our wives, our husbands, our 
children, and to love our neighbors. The 
Latter-day Saint who does not do this 
shows a dearth of that oil that is neces- 
sary to enable him to stand and be pre- 



pared for the coming of the Son of man. 
The Lord requires us to preach the Gos- 
pel to all the world, and for this reason 
above all others He has endowed us 
with His divine authority. If we neg- 
lect to honor and magnify the Priest- 
hood, as we ought to do every day of 
our lives, we evidence a lack of oil. 

I would utter this simple word of 
warning to my brethren and sisters. I 
wish that we would repent, and remem- 
ber the Lord. We always remember 
him when we are sick and in trouble. 
When we are cast down and humiliated, 
we fly to the Lord in our distress. I 
want to advise this congregation, who 
are not sickly or invalids, to remem- 
ber the Lord while they are healthy. 
The sick ones remember the Lord. They 
receive the ordinance of anointing 
with oil and the laying on of hands, 
and the prayer of faith is offered up 
that they may be healed. But when 
we are strong and well I fear that we 
are inclined to forget the Lord. When 
we are fairly independent and success- 
ful financially, I wonder if we do not 
think that we are able to walk alone 
and to take care of ourselves. When our 
sight and our hearing are good, when 
we are not palsied, or disordered in any 
way, I wonder if we do not lie down 
at night and get up in the morning, 
work hard all day and attend strictly 
to our own affairs, and forget the Lord. 
Who should remember the Lord? The 
hearty, the healthy, the vigorous. Why? 
Because their favors from the Lord are 
superior to the favors of others. When 
a man can see, he should never forget 
to thank the Lord for the sight of 
his eyes. A man should never forget 
to thank the Lord for the judgment and 
wisdom He endows him with. His 
heart should go out in gratitude to the 
Father that he is so abundantly 
blessed. His sympathies, too, should 
go out, as a strong, able man, to those 
who are less fortunate than himself. 

We are fairly faithful, but we should 
be more faithful and more devoted to 
the Lord. We should be more careful 
and conscientious in the performance 
of our duties, so that nothing that is 
required of us shall be overlooked. Let 
every man who has received the Priest- 
hood, let every woman who has a hus- 
band bearing the Priesthood, let every 



ELDER FRANCIS M. LYMAN 



47 



family that is presided over by a man 
bearing the Priesthood, rejoice and 
thank the Lord and sing praises to His 
name every day, for the blessings He 
bestows upon them. If there are sick 
among us, let them call for the Elders 
of the Church, as we read in the scrip- 
tures, and let the Elders pray over 
them, anointing them with oil, and 
the prayer of faith shall heal the sick. 
How simple these ordinances are! 
How simple the ordinance of 
baptism, of confirmation, of ordina- 
tion to the holy Priesthood! 
How simple the prayers that we 
are directed to offer, and how pleased 
the Lord is when we approach Him in 
the simplest forms of speech! How 
pleased the Lord is when we remember 
Him in our thoughts and feelings; and 
when our hearts go out to the Father 
in gratitude, how the inspiration of the 
Lord vibrates in our souls! How grate- 
ful we ought to be to the Lord that 
He has planted in our souls a knowl- 
edge of the truth; that we have been 
enabled to understand that He is indeed 
our Father, that we are His children, 
and that our Elder Brother' Jesus is 
the Son of God, the Savior and Redeem- 
er of the world! How grateful we ought 
to be that we were permitted to come 
upon the earth in this last dispensation 
of the fulness of times! What a won- 
derful favor this has been to us, that 
we were preserved and held in reserve 
until this auspicious time, when we 
could labor for our own salvation and 
for the salvation of our dead kindred! 
What a wonderful blessing that we 
could be the builders of temples; that 
we could come in the day when the 
Prophet came, when the Lord appeared 
and made Himself known to the world, 
as He had not been known for eighteen 
hundred years! How necessary it was 
that the peoples of the world should 
have a living witness, the witness of a 
man who had been permitted to see 
the Father and the Son, and who had 
the testimony in his heart in regard to 
the Father and the Son by the inspira- 
tion of the Holy Ghost. We may not 
all be allowed to see the Father, yet we 
are all enjoined to know the Father 
and the Son, and to have the testimony 
of the Holy Ghost abiding in our hearts 
in regard to the Father and the Son; 



for when we know them we can rely 
confidently upon the doctrines that are 
taught us and upon the promises that 
have been made to us, and the more 
we become acquainted with the Spirit 
of the Lord the more we become es- 
tablished, and the more we comprehend 
the things of God. Governors, judges, 
kings and queens, and the great 
philosophers of the world do not 
know these things. The simplest 
Latter-day Saint in the Church has in- 
spiration and light that the philoso- 
phers and the greatest among men 
have not tasted. There is a measure of 
light and inspiration that comes 
through the Holy Ghost to those who 
serve the Lord that the natural man, 
independent of the Holy Ghost, is not 
endowed with. It is the possession of 
this Spirit that makes us a peculiar 
people; and the reason we are not more 
different from the rest of the world 
than we are is because we do not live 
according to the light and inspiration 
of the Holy Ghost as we ought to do. 
Our fallen natures have too great 
power over us, and our weaknesses re- 
strain us and turn us aside from keep- 
ing the commandments of the Lord as 
we ought to do. We hardly expect to 
be perfect in this life; but we do want 
to be perfect. That is the object of our 
being — to be perfect as our Father in 
heaven is perfect; to do as the Son of 
God has done, to live as He lives, in the 
light and inspiration of the Lord, to 
serve the Lord, to be His sons and 
daughters, to keep His commandments, 
to know Him as He is, and have thj 
inspiration and light of His counten- 
ance always in our hearts, in our 
homes, and in all our operations and la- 
bors of life. We are not here simply to 
exist, simply to provide bread and but- 
ter, to eat and drink, to wear clothing, 
to be comfortable, to sleep and to arise, 
to labor, and the like — that is not the 
sole object of our coming here; but we 
come here to be developed, to be en- 
larged, and to become like our Father, 
following the example set by the Son of 
God; to not set up our own wills, and 
determine to have our own way and do 
as we please, but to do the will of the 
Lord, and to obtain the inspiration of 
the Spirit of the Lord, that we may not 
be led astray, and that the evil influ-

GENERAL, CONFERENCE. 



erices and spirits which move among 
the children of men may not take hold 
of us, but that we may know the spirits 
and not be deceived by them. There is 
an endless variety of spirits in the 
world today, and we have need to be 
very cautious that we be not overcome; 
for Satan would like to> destroy us and 
this work in which we are engaged:. He 
uses agencies to blind the eyes of the 
people, and good men are led to op- 
pose this Church and its doctrines be- 
cause they do not comprehend them. 
There are thousands of people pitted 
against this work who, if they but knew 
that they were persecuting the Saints 
of God, would rather sacrifice their 
lives than continue to do so. They are 
conscientious and honest people, but 
blinded by the insinuations of Satan, 
who has made them to feel that if this 
Church is allowed to prosper the world 
will be demoralized and brought into 
wickedness and corruption, and for that 
reason they work against us. 

You Latter-day Saints here, ten 
thousand strong, have you ever been 
taught by the Elders of Israel to be 
wicked? Have you ever been led by 
them into wickedness, and encouraged 
in any kind of corruption? Have you 
been taught that you should be enemies 
to the world, or enemies to your neigh- 
bors? Do you persecute your neigh- 
bors? Are you disturbing their peace? 
Are you trying to rob and injure them? 
Or are you taught to be conscientious 
and honest, and to treat your brother, 
though he does not believe as you do, 
kindly? Have you not been taught to 
deal honestly with all men, to love all 
men, and to seek their salvation? You 
are my witnesses here today that we 
have not taught you to be wicked. You 
have not been led into wickedness. But 
you have been taught and exhorted all 
the day long in harmony with the doc- 
trines that are published to the world 
by the Latter-day Saints, in harmony 
with the Gospel as laid down in the Bi- 
ble. In obedience to the principles of 
that Gospel the testimony of the Lord 
Jesus has been planted in your hearts; 
and while that abides, you love your 
neighbor, you love your enemies, and 
would do them good, and not injury; 
you would seek for their salvation, for 
their happiness and peace, and you 



could not be persuaded to do a thing: 
that was wrong. You could not be led 
into stealing, into thieving, into lying, 
into deception and fraud. You. 
would not tolerate it in the lead- 
ers of Israel. If you detected 
dishonesty in them; you would expose 
it in a moment; for you have been too 
well trained and instructed under your 
local authorities as well as under the 
general authorities of the Church, and 
you know that it is necessary for you 
to live lives of purity and righteous- 
ness. You know that your mission in 
the world is for the salvation of the 
souls of the children of men, including 
your own souls. You are not allowed 
to be wicked and corrupt. If you are a 
thief we deal with you for your fel- 
lowship. Dishonesty, unvirtuous con- 
duct, lying and thieving are not toU 
erated among the Latter-day Saints. 
We have not gone into the world to 
gather people who indulge in such evil 
practices; but we have labored all the 
time to gather the honest, the con- 
scientious, the upright, and those who 
would be obedient and pure in their 
lives. If they are not willing to sub- 
mit to these requirements, we do not 
want them. We cannot save them in 
their sins; they must repent and re- 
form. If they do not do this, the Gospel 
has no chance to save them. The 
atonement wrought out by the Savior 
has relieved us of the sin of our first 
parents, and has brought us into com- 
munion with the Lord; but we are re- 
sponsible for our own transgressions. 
We must repent of them. Baptism is 
unavailing without repentance. Faith , 
that does not produce repentance is un- 
availing. But the faith that has been 
restored to us through the mission of 
the Prophet Joseph Smith is a vital 
faith. It moves men to repentance and 
reformation, and to keeping the com- 
mandments of the Lord. It opens the- 
way that we may know the Father and 
the Son; that we may know the Proph- 
ets, and that we may comprehend the 
principles of the Gospel. Having this 
faith, this congregation could not be de- 
ceived. No man could stand here and 
teach falsehood without being detected. 
The Latter-day Saints are as sensitive 
to the movements and operations of 
the Spirit of the Lord as the- 



ELDER FRANCIS M. LYMAN.

thermometer is to the presence 
of heat and cold. You know in a mo- 
ment when the Spirit of the Lord is 
coming- upon you. If the power of Satan 
were to he manifested in this congrega- 
tion, it would be felt in a moment. 
Every person in the house would sense 
it from crown to toe. 

The Lord has thus been training and 
schooling us since the days of the 
Prophet. The Prophet Joseph Smith 
fulfilled his mission most grandly, and 
he laid down his life for the testimony 
of Jesus. The Prophet Brigham 
built upon the foundation that the 
Prophet Joseph laid, under the direction 
of the Lord. The Prophet Brigham was 
the servant and lion of the Lord in 
the midst of His people. The Lord 
counseled and led him; and the result of 
his labors and the inspiration and great 
power which God gave him is seen on 
every hand. President John Taylor and 
President Wilford Woodruff were men 
of God — men who never showed the 
white feather, who were always true 
and devoted to the Lord in every im- 
pulse of their souls. President Snow, 
who is with us today, is a worthy suc- 
cessor to those who have gone before. 
The Lord has been with President 
Snow. His mission has been a remark- 
able one. The mission of each of the 
chiefs of this Church has been empha- 
sized by some very important work. 
President Snow is to live to see this 
people made free, and relieved of their 
embarrassments, financial and other- 
wise. There is a stride being made by 
this Church today that has never he- 
fore been made in its history. We are 
advancing, we are improving and gain- 
ing strength and power day by day. 
The Lord is with His people. The Gos- 
pel is being preached as never before. 
Nations that have not heard the Gos- 
pel are to hear it. And this adminis- 
tration of President Snow shall be made 
remarkable, as all the others have been. 
What peculiar strength and power have 
we noticed in any one of the leaders of 
Israel? Have they been uncommon 
men? No, except as the Lord has made 
them uncommon. A remarkable work 
was accomplished by the Prophet Jo- 
s ph, though he died before he was forty 
years of age. He laid the foundation of 



this great work, which is to cover 
the earth, in a few years. He was a. 
young and inexperienced man; but the 
Lord was with him. He saw the Father 
and the Son; he was inspired of the 
Holy Ghost, and was among the great- 
est of Prophets; in fact, there has been 
none greater on this earth, save the Son 
of God himself. The greatest dispensa- 
tion ever committed to man upon the 
earth was opened up by the Prophet 
Joseph in 1830. The Lord was with him, 
and He has been with his successors. 
Not a man will ever stand in his exalt- 
ed place and station, as President Lo- 
renzo Snow does today, who is not most 
thoroughly proven, and who has not 
demonstrated by his life that he loves 
the Lord in preference to all else, so> 
that God can handle and direct him in 
leading Israel. That is what the Lord 
can do with President Lorenzo Snow. 
It is what the Lord can do with Presi- 
dent George Q. Cannon. It is what the 
Lord can do with President Joseph F. 
Smith. It is what the Lord can do with 
these Apostles whom you have voted 
for today to be prophets, seers and 
revelators. This Church will never be 
without prophets, seers and revelators, 
to stand at its head, and the 
vicegerent will stand as the representa- 
tive of the Lord and speak for the 
whole Church. The Apostles hold the 
keys of the power of God in the earth, 
and the Lord enables them to turn 
those keys and give authority to men to 
open the door of the Gospel to the na- 
tions of the earth, that the purposes of 
the Lord may be fulfilled in the earth 
preparatory to the coming of the Son 
of man. Not only these Apostles, but 
these presiding Seventies, the presid- 
ing High Priests in the Stakes of Zion, 
and the Bishops of wards — these men 
are all endowed with Priesthood and 
authority from God for the ministry en- 
trusted to them. Blessed be the Bishop 
that takes care of his little ward, for 
his glory and exaltation shall be equal 
to any man's. A man who labors and is 
successful in saving souls, and who 
by his example encourages, strength- 
ens and stimulates them and leads 
them back into the presence of God, 
oh, what honor will be conferred upon 
that man! The posterity of those souls 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



will rise up and call him blessed before 
the Lord. 

My brethren and sisters, can we af- 
ford to be indifferent and neglectful, 
listless and foolish, so late in the day 
as this? for it is announced to us that 
the coming of the Son of Man is near 
at hand. O! that we will serve and 
honor the Lord and be ready at His 
coming; that the door shall not be shut 
against us, but that there shall be oil 
in our lamps, and we be well pre- 
pared. But not a man or woman can 
have the necessary oil and preparation 
who hath not earned it by his or her 
own devoted service to the Lord. And 
we have not a moment to be careless. 
Seek the Lcrd and serve Him every 
day of your lives. Then if you die be- 
fore the coming of the Son of Man you 
shall see Him when you go to the other 
side, and you shall be welcome there. 
Let us be ready all the time, and let 
us labor with devotion and faithfulness. 
Never mind what others do; for me, I 
must serve the Lord, I must honor and 
serve Him with all my might and 
strength, in order that I may be re- 
deemed and saved in His presence. 

God bless all Israel. I thank you, my 
brethren and sisters, that you have 
come to this conference. It is a blessed 
conference! The word of the Lord has 
been freely given; the Spirit of the 
Lord has been upon the brethren; it 
has been rich upon you, and it will in- 
crease upon you in your homes, the 
Lord will sustain and strengthen you. 
Zion will triumph, her numbers will in- 
crease, and where she now has five or 
six hundred wards, towns and villages, 
there shall be five or six thousand 
towns and villages; where there are 
four temples now being occupied by the 
Latter-day Saints, marking them as a 
people unlike any other people in the 
world, there will be forty temples, fifty 
temples, hundreds of temples all over 
the land, that shall occupy the labors of 
the faithful through the Millennium. 
That God may grant us to live to see 
these things accomplished — or, if we go 
before, that we may go to Him ap- 
proved, that it may be said of us. 
"Well, done, good and faithful servant, 
enter into the joy of thy Lord," is my 
prayer, through Jesus Christ. Amen. 



ELDER EDWARD H. SNOW. 

My brethern and sisters, I appreci- 
ate very much the privilege which 
President Snow has offorded me of 
addressing you at this conference for 
a few moments. I have greatly en- 
joyed the spirit of the conference, and 
perhaps can appreciate more than the 
great majority of you the opportunity 
of once more associating with Latter- 
day Saints and partaking of the feel- 
ing of fraternity and unity which is 
so characteristic of the Saints of God 
wherever they may be. 

I have been reflecting upon the great 
fundamental truths which Apostle 
Lyman has just been expounding to the 
saints. I am afraid that we hear them so 
often that their true import and great 
significance to us is somewhat blunted; 
but I desire to testify, that it is these 
great truths and a living faith in them 
that make of Mormonism the great, 
potent factor which it is in the religious 
world today. As a sclent force the 
truths of the Gospel are permeating 
society and finding an abiding place in 
the hearts of many honest people. The 
freedom of intelligent obedience to law 
to order, to progress, is something that 
is startling to the world; and as they 
begin to comprehend that we are not a 
race of slaves, but a free, highminded 
and noble people, who fear God only 
and honor the priesthood and those who 
hold it, their regard for us as a people 
increases. To my mind, the Latter-day 
Saints ought to strive for this freedom 
We ought to live above the law; to en- 
joy its benefits and blessings, and not 
be enslaved to any law of the Gospel, 
but to render to it an intelligent obed- 
ience, testing it for ourselves by prac- 
ticing it; for the day is coming when 
the civilization of the w r orld, with all 
its allurements and fascinations, will be 
upon us, and we must be able to resist 
it. We must be able to let radiate 
from our souls the principles of the 
Gospel, and instead of being over- 
come, overcome ourselves, and our en- 
vironments, and be a living well of wa- 
ter, so to speak, springing up unto ever- 
lasting life, impressing all those with 
whom we come in contact that we do 
verily know, and we are living expo- 
nents of, the fundamental truths of the 



ELDER LOUIS A. KEL.SCH. 



51 



Gospel of our Lord and Savior Jesus 
Christ. Then we will be individually a 
force for good, and as a unit of the 
great aggregation composing this 
Church, will reflect these truths. In 
this way we will become missionaries in 
very deed. The Elders of Israel who 
go forth into the world are, by 
way of contrast, as a light upon a hill; 
but when they return the stimulus to 
action is removed, and they become 
lost, as it were, in the great body of the 
Church. Bishops and Presidents of 
Stakes can do much to alleviate this 
condition that is so much complained 
of, if they will keep these young men 
"in the harness," and let them know 
that they are not lost sight of, and that 
their mission is not ended. I desire to 
testify that the Eastern States mission 
has produced young men who are cap- 
able of good work. There they have 
been made considerable of; they have 
been placed in position; and when they 
return, if their services are not sought 
after by the local authorities, they 
sometimes become indifferent, and re- 
sults that are to be deplored follow. 

I pray God's blessing upon all Israel, 
and especially upon the youth, that 
they may not prove a disappointment 
to their noble sires who have done so 
much to establish the work and make 
possible the progress that characterizes 
the Church today. Amen. 

ELDER LOUIS A. KELSCH. 

My heart rejoices this morning in 
having the privilege of standing before 
you, my brethren and sisters, and bear- 
ing testimony of the great work which 
our Father in heaven has established 
upon the earth. I thank Him from the 
bottom of my heart that He has per- 
mitted me to be associated with you, 
and that I have been counted worthy to 
receive the Gospel of Jesus Christ in 
these the last days. I thank Him for 
the Holy Priesthood which He has giv- 
en unto me, and that I have had the 
privilege of going forth among the chil- 
dren of men and declaring unto them 
this great and glorious message which 
God has again restored to the earth. I 
thank Him for the knowledge of this 
work which He has given me; for I can 
testify unto you truthfully that I do 



know that this work is of God, and not 
of man. Every man who has not sinned 
too much can find out this truth for 
himself. Our Master, the Savior, has 
said that he that will do the will of 
His Father shall know of the doctrine, 
whether it be of God or of man. So I 
can say, my brethren and sisters, that 
every man and woman can know for 
tnemselves in these last days whether 
Joseph Smith was a Prophet or not. I 
know that he was from the abundance 
of evidence and testimonies which I 
have received during the time of my 
ministry among the nations of the 
earth. I rejoice exceedingly in having 
the privilege of being numbered 
among the humble servants of God who 
have been sent forth and are being sent 
forth to the nations of the earth. I de- 
sire to do my duty, to serve God and 
to keep His commandments all the 
days of my life; and I can do it with 
His heip. 

I am pleased to report to you that the 
Northern States mission is in a very 
prosperous condition at the present 
time. Tour sons who are laboring 
with us are humble; they are 
men c£ God; they are seeking to do 
His will; their labors are being 
blessed and made fruitful; and at the 
present time it looks as if this season 
will be more prosperous than any 
other season, notwithstanding the num- 
ber of the Elders has been greatly re- 
duced. I thank my Heavenly Father 
that, notwithstanding I have spent a 
few years in the Northern States mis- 
sion, I now have the privilege of ac- 
companying my brethren who have 
been called to Japan. I consider it a 
great honor. I am by no means tired 
of the work. I rejoice in it. I want 
to increase in knowledge and wisdom. 
All of us should seek for knowledge, 
and to have it increased within us, that 
we may be strengthened in our faith 
and prepared for the great changes 
that will come upon us. We must learn, 
my brethren and sisters, to be obedient 
unto God the Eternal Father and His 
Son Jesus Christ. We must learn to 
be one, even as He and the Father are 
one. Jesus prayed, "Holy Father, keep 
through thine own name those whom 
thou hast given me, that they may be 
one, as we are." "Neither pray I for 



52

these alone, but for them also which 
shall believe on me through their word; 
that they all may be one." Now, we 
believe the words of Jesus, and also 
the words of His Apostles who were 
with Him in His ministry. We also 
believe in the words of the servants of 
God who have been raised up in these 
last days; for they are just as true 
and faithful. We are commanded to 
live by every word that proceedeth 
from the mouths of the servants of 
God, and I believe in them. I intend, 
with the help of the Lord, to keep eve- 
ry commandment which God has 
given. May the Lord bless us in our 
endeavors to spread righteousness in 
the earth, and may we have power to 
save men and women, is my prayer 
in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The choir and congregation sang a 
portion of the hymn which begins: 

"The Spirit of God like a Are is burn- 
ing." 

Benediction by Elder Heber J. Grant. 



AT THE ASSEMBLY HALL. 

The Tabernacle being insufficient to 
accommodate the great mass of people 
in attendance, an overflow meeting was 
held in the Assembly hall. Elder Heber 
J. Grant, of the quorum of Apostles, 
presiding, at 2 p. m. 

The choir sang the hymn which com- 
mences: 

"Come, come, ye Saints." 

Opening prayer by Elder Edward 
Woolley. 

Singing: 

"To Him who made the world." 

ELDER FRANK Y. TAYLOR. 

I have seldom, if ever, listened to ad- 
dresses that so impressed me as have 
the words given through the servants 
of the Lord during this conference. It 
teaches that when brethren are called 
to important positions in the Church 
and Kingdom of God, by authority of 
our Heavenly Father they truly 
are clothed with the spirit of their mis- 



sion and calling. To illustrate this 
thought: A number of years ago I was 
on a trip with one of the younger 
Apostles who had been ordained quite 
recently to that position. I thought he 
was quite a good man, but when he 
was called, the idea ran through my 
mind: "I wonder if he is the right 
man in the right place to fill this most 
important calling?" However, I ac- 
cepted the will of our Heavenly Father 
in the matter, and sustained him in my 
heart. When I went off on this trip, 
there came an occasion where it re- 
quired the best kind of judgment, and 
where it seemed like the spirit of the 
Lord alone could remove the difficulty 
that seemed to be in the way of this 
young man, and the query ran through 
my mind, when the question came up, 
as to how th~! matter was to be de- 
cided, how he would be able to do it. 
But when he stood up and decided that 
question, and I observed the manner in 
which he decided it, the wisdom used 
and how he maintained the dignity of 
the position he occupied, then I said, 
"truly the Lord does clothe His people 
with the spirit of their calling when 
they are called by the authority of our 
Heavenly Father. I have learned to re- 
spect and to love that young man be- 
cause of the spirit with which he mag- 
nifies the position he occupies." 

I frequently think that we look a long 
way for the teachings of the Spirit of 
the Lord. We forget that God has 
given us Prophets and Apostles to be in 
our own midst. We sometimes think 
comparatively too much of the Prophets 
of ancient times. While they are good 
and of great value to us, yet we have 
Apostles and Prophets in our day just 
as worthy of our appreciation. We 
have men inspired to give us the word 
of the Lord when we seek for it. The 
truths these brethren express are in- 
spired of our Heavenly Father. We 
should be careful not to reject the word 
of God which comes to us through such 
men. I testify that I know that Joseph 
Smith is a Prophet of God, and that 
the Prophets who have followed after 
him were his legal successors, and that 
we have in our midst today Prophets 
and Apostles with the same authority 
that existed in ancient times. 



ELDER WILLIAM H. SMART.

ELDER WILLIAM H. SMART. 

I feel honored of the Lord, as His 
servant, in having this great privilege 
of addressing you in this conference 
overflow meeting. 

I will read these words of the Lord 
to the Prophet Joseph Smith, which are 
found in the 64th section of the Book 
of Doctrine & Covenants: 

'Behold, the Lord requireth the heart 
snd the willing mind, and the willing 
and obedient shall eat the good of the 
land if Zion in these last days, and the 
rebellious shall be cut off out of the 
land of Zion and shall be sent away 
and shall not inherit the land; for ver- 
ily I tay that the rebellious are not of 
the blood of Ephraim, wherefore they 
shall be plucked out." * * * "For be- 
hold, I say unto you that Zion shall 
flourish and the glory of the Lord shall 
be upon her, and she shall be an ensign 
unto the people, and there shall come 
unto her out of every nation under 
heaven, and the day shall come when 
the nations of the earth shall tremble 
because of her and shall fear because 
of her terrible ones." 

I felt impressed with this which has 
been given unto us of the Lord, dur- 
ing the time which the brethren have 
been speaking to us. They have borne 
very heavily upon the subject of obedi- 
ence and giving ourselves wholly un- 
to the Lord. My mind goes back when 
I contemplate this principle of obedi- 
ence, to that which we learn in the 
Pearl of Gieat Price, when in the coun- 
cils of heaven the foundations 
of the earth and the building 
thereof were taken into considera- 
tion. Two plans were laid before the 
councils, and because of the humble 
and obedient spirit that was shown 
in Jesus Christ, He was chosen to carry 
out that plan, which His Father ap- 
proved, and Satan rebelled because the 
trust was given unto his more meek 
brother Jesus. When this earth was 
formed and Adam was placed thereon 
with his wife Eve, we find that in their 
children there were two spirits that 
were exemplified in the children — obe- 
dience and disobedience; the giving of 
the heart unto God on the one side and 
on the other side the individual becom- 
ing a law unto himself. Abel offered 
up unto God a sacrifice in righteous- 
ness, while his brother Cain did not so. 
Abel's sacrifice was accepted of . the 



Lord, while Cain's was rejected; and 
as we come down in the stream of 
time, no mor' beautiful example of 
perfect and simple faith can be found 
than that in the history of our father 
Abraha.-.. Although a land was given 
unto him and his posterity, although he 
had been told that through him and his 
seed the earth should be blessed, yet 
God required at his hand his son Issac, 
and told him to go into the hill Moriah 
and there offer him up unto the Lord 
as a sacrifice. He bound together the 
sticks of wood, took the young man, 
and journeyed to the mountain, where 
he left his servants and bound the 
sticks upon the back of his son; and 
the little boy, as he trudged along by 
the side of his father, said: "Father, 
father?" Abraham answered: "Here am 
I." Then said the child: "Here are the 
sticks, where is the Lamb for sacri- 
fice?" The father answered: "the Lord 
will raise up a lamb for sacrifice." 

So they went on to the hill. The fa- 
ther built an altar, laid the sticks 
thereon, and then placed his beloved 
son Isaac upon the altar. As he went 
to offer him up an angel of the Lord 
stayed his hand, and there was a ram 
found in the thicket for the sacrifice. 
It was enough. God had proven his 
heart, and he had proven his soul; 
he had ascertained that Abraham had 
given unto him his whole heart, wholly 
and unreservedly. And because of this, 
the angel of the Lord said unto him: 
"Because thou hast not withheld thy 
son, thine only son from me, behold, in 
blessing I will bless thee until thv pos- 
terity shall be as the sands upon the 
sea shore and as the stars in the fir- 
mament of heaven." And He said 
further: "In thee, and in thy seed, 
shall all the nations of the earth be 
blessed." 

Abraham gave unto God his heart 
unstintedly, and God promised that He 
would pay him back. He had faith 
and power to give his own flesh and 
blood as a sacrifice to God; and in of- 
fering up his flesh and blood, God 
promised to him that his seed, his 
flesh and bl^-d, should become as 
numerous as the sands of the sea shore 
and as the stars in the firmament of 
the heavens. 
God has said that every blessing that 



54 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



is in the Church of Christ is predicat- 
ed upon the observance of law. He 
has instituted the law of sacrifice, the 
law of tithing-, for the temporal salva- 
tion of the people of God. We learn 
in the history of the Jews that Adam 
and Eve were given of the fruits of 
all the trees in the garden, and were 
given all the cattle upon the earth, the 
fishes of the sea and the fowls of the 
air for food and for succor; but of 
one tree God required that they should 
not touch the fruit thereof, but that 
they should render unto Him a sacrifice 
of the fruit of that tree, and that by 
doing so, by not breaking the law of 
their temporal salvation, the garden 
of Eden would be vouchsafed unto 
them, but if they broke it they would 
lose their home and would be driven 
out from that land even into the lone 
and dreary world. By observing the 
temporal law they would receive tem- 
poral blessings; by the breaking of 
law they would lose their home. They 
broke the law, the angel of the Lord 
drove them out, and the earth brought 
forth briars, thistles and noxious weeds 
instead of the lucious fruits that it was 
bringing forth ' e that time. They 
transgressed the law, and their own 
lives, and the lives of their own chil- 
dren, brought forth briars and thistles 
and noxious weeds in the flesh. After 
awhile was a people under the leader- 
ship of Enoch, who applied the prin- 
ciples of sacrifice to a portion of the 
earth's surface, and they brought that 
portion of the earth up to a sanctified 
condition. As fast as they applied the 
principles of sanctification, the law of 
sacrifice, to that portion of the earth's 
surface, and applied it unto their own 
lives, they redeemed their home and 
they redeemed themselves, until finally 
it is written that the City of Enoch 
"was not, because God took it." 

This, my brethren and sisters, has 
been impressed upon my mind as the 
manner in which this earth is to be 
redeemed. God blessed that peo- 
ple to redeem that portion of 
the earth's surface, and we 
have their example before us. In our 
day, God told our fathers and our moth- 
ers before they came to this land, if 
they would keep the law of sanctifica- 



tion it should be a land of Zion unto 
them, and they should not be overcome 
of their enemies. It was beyond them 
to keep that law; and as God took the 
Melchisedek Priesthood and Moses from 
ancient Israel, so in His mercy He took 
the higher law of redemption, temporal, 
from the people, and He left with them 
the lower law, that of tithing. Now we 
are all wandering in the wilderness of 
the Western States of America with 
this lower, temporal law among us, 
given us in the mercy of God to redeem 
us and bring us back unto that condi- 
tion where we may observe the higher 
law. And God is pleading with us, 
through His Prophet today, and it is 
one of the signs of the times. When 
we can observe this law, then the com- 
ing of Christ is near, even at our doors, 
Zion will be rebuilt, and it will be re- 
deemed as the City of Enoch was re- 
deemed, and the law shall go forth and 
Zion shall increase and flourish as I 
have given you here — "For, behold, I 
say unto you, that Zion shall flourish 
and the glory of God shall be upon her." 

I bear you my testimony that God has 
renewed unto us that principle of sacri- 
fice through President Lorenzo Snow. 
He gave us a blessing so that we may 
have the privilege of renewing this 
land, and we are to redeem this earth; 
and we are to redeem ourselves by this 
law of sacrifice, and we will gain it 
inch by inch, by the blessings of the 
Lord, as we apply this principle of sac- 
rifice unto this earth of ours. The man 
who does not pay his tithing is the man 
who has his eyes closed against this 
principle. We should pray that God 
will bless us with His spirit that we 
may do His bidding in this regard, and 
thus receive a blessing which is pre- 
dicated upon obedience. 

I desire to say unto the Latter-day 
Saints one thing that I had in my heart 
to say last evening at the Priesthood 
meeting. One year ago during our 
conference I went to the Sunday School 
Union and heard Apostle Heber J. 
Grant attempt to sing, and I heard 
some parties after I left the room state 
that he had made a scene of himself. 
He had stood up there and endeavored 
to sing a song of Zion, "O, my Fath- 
er, Thou that dwellest." He talked to 



ELDER BEN E. RICH. 



55 



us a little while before that, and then 
he attempted to sing one of the verses, 
and did not get the right key; but he 
said that he would try it again as 
Brother Goddard used to when he got 
off the right key, and he sang it again 
in the same old way. He wanted to 
sing that because Eliza R. Snow had 
composed it. She exerted a great in- 
fluence over his heart, and prophesied 
in tongues that he would yet be one 
of the leaders of this people. He de- 
sired to learn to sing, "God moves in a 
mysterious way," because it was the 
hymn that was the most loved by our 
beloved President Woodruff. I say un- 
to 3'ou, young men and women, before 
me, that I feel in my heart that God 
inspired that man to take up singing. 
He quoteu to us that night that God 
delighteth in the song of the heart; 
yea, the song of the righteous is a 
prayer unto Him, and it shall be an- 
swered with a blessing on their head. 
My little boy was sitting with me when 
Brother Giant said that, and his eyes 
danced with joy and the muscles of 
his face played with excitement. I no- 
ticed him, and I said to myself: "I 
wonder if an Apostle of the Lord Jesus 
Christ will be robbed of some of his 
power and his glory because he makes 
a scene of himself before Latter- 
d.-ty Saints." Two weeks after there 
was a conference in Ogden. The speak- 
ers mentioned to be there included 
Brother Heber J. Grant. My little boy 
said, "i want to go to that conference, 
papa, if Heber J. Grant is to be there." 

i was then here for the Eastern 
States mission, and I was wondering 
what I could do to assist that mission. 
It is a hard and a cold mission, and 
our Elders were almost desponding in 
some places because they could not 
thaw the people out sufficiently to get 
them to lend an ear to the Gospel. They 
were not preaching as much as they 
ought to have done; and as I sat in 
my beat that night there was a feel- 
ing came to me that God has brought 
to me an inspiration through Brother 
Grant. I went back to that mission 
and went to every conference and ev- 
ery part of it. and acted on the idea 
that perseverance overcometh many 
difficulties. God bless you. Amen. 



ELDER BEN E. RICH. 

It has been my privilege to represent 
the Gospel of Jesus Christ upon more 
than one mission and in more than one 
nation; and I feel that God has blessed 
me in the labor in which I am engaged. 
The longer I live the more fully and 
thoroughly do I understand the great 
and mighty things which are being 
done in the earth in this the greatest 
dispensation that the earth ever saw. 
The Latter-day Saints are looked upon 
as a peculiar people, and they are the 
most peculiar people to be found upon 
the face of the earth. In standing be- 
fore this congregation, I see people be- 
fore me who came from a great many 
different nations of the earth and the 
blood of the different nationalities Is 
being blended together in the people 
growing up in these mountains that 
will yet be acknowledged as the great- 
est in strength, in wisdom and in the 
knowledge of the affairs of God of any 
people who ever lived upon the earth. 

I say to the young men and young 
ladies, Does it ever dawn upon you how 
much you owe to the Gospel of Jesus 
Christ? Does it ever come to your mind 
where the Gospel found your mother, 
where it found your father, where the 
Gospel of Christ made them acquainted 
with each other, and the faith in that 
Gospel gave you a lovely or a happy 
home in these valleys of the mountains .' 
And yet the Gospel has done this; and 
if there is a people upon the earth who 
should realize that they are not of the 
world, and therefore should love one 
another, it is the people called Latter- 
day Saints. No matter what your as- 
sociations may be with others, I would 
have you understand that as a people 
you are a distinct people in and of 
yourselves, that you have been brought 
out of the world, that you are not of 
the world; and if the words and prom- 
ises of Christ can be relied upon, you 
are not beloved by the world. 

The people of the earth at the pres- 
sent time occupy the same position 
that the people have in various 
ages of the world when God has had 
Prophets upon the earth. In fact, the 
sin, the condemnation of the people of 
this earth always has been that they 
stood ready to revere the memory of 



56 



GENERAL, CONFERENCE. 



dead Prophets, to worship the memory 
of the people of God who were in their 
silent graves, and who had lived in for- 
mer dispensations, while they refused 
to listen to Prophets of God who were 
sent unto them. In the days of Noah, 
the people rejected the revelation that 
God gave to them through that great 
Prophet, and it was to their condemna- 
tion that they rejected the revelation 
of God which was sent to them. In 
the days of our Master and His Apos- 
tles, it was the condemnation of the 
people who lived then, that they re- 
jected Christ, that they turned a deaf 
ear to Peter, James and John although 
they were willing to worship the mem- 
ory of a Moses, of a Noah, or an Abra- 
ham, or any of the other Prophets who 
lived in former dispensations Yet 
they rejected the message sent to them 

Manki Tf th6ir co »<Jemnation. 

Mankind has always believed in ancient 
revelation, and in every dispensation 
they have rejected, and reject now, im- 
mediate revelation, which alone can 
bring eternal life and salvation in the 
presence of God to any people who lives 
«Pon the earth, or who have ever lived 
upon the face of the earth. Belief in 
former revelation never did and never 
will save an individual; but belief in 
modern revelation has always been the 
test of life and salvation when God has 
had a people upon the earth 

Not long ago it was my privilege to 
spend an evening with a Rabbi, a very 
learned man who had read something in 
an interview in a newspaper which had 
attracted his attention, and I received 
an invitation to go to him; a nd during 
the evening he began to talk about the 
God of Abraham, of Isaac and of Jacob 

asked him what his idea of God was 
and to my surprise he defined the deity 
very much in the same way. in fact in 
the same way, as He is looked upon by 
modern Christianity today, that He was 
a being without a body, without parts 
without passions; that He did not exist 
in any shape, that He was found in 
everything. And when he was through 
I ask him the difference between that 
God and the God of an Ingersoll.who be- 
lieved that nature was the only God. 
And I said to him that it seemed to me 
that the only difference between the 
Jews of today and modern Christi- 



anity of today, concerning a belief in 
God, and the followers of an 
Ingersoll or a Bradlaugh, was that one 
of them called it God and the other 
called it Nature. And then I opened 
the Bible, and I said, "Now you believe 
in the prophecies of Moses?" "Yes." 
"Well," said I, "here is a prophecy ut- 
tered by Moses, found in one of the 
books of Moses, which says that Israel 
will be scattered among the nations of 
the earth, that they will degenerate to 
such an extent that they will not be- 
lieve in a God who can eat or speak or 
smell." "Now," said I, "after the defin- 
ition that you have given me, that the 
Supreme Being in your estimation and 
in the estimation of the Jews, which is 
the same as the estimation of modern 
Christianity, that He has no body, no 
parts, no passions, seems to me as 
though we saw that day when Israel 
has not only been scattered among the 
nations of the earth but that they have 
actually degenerated to such an extent 
that they do not believe in a God who 
can eat or speak or smell; and it also 
seems to me as though that Being be- 
lieved in by Moses, by Abraham, by 
Isaac and by Jacob, your fathers — that 
in Him they did believe in a God who 
could eat, who could speak, and who 
could smell, and in whose being and 
presence and likeness we, His children, 
were created when we were placed upon 
the earth. I do not believe I ever had 
a greater illustration of the fulfillment 
of a prophecy than came to my mind 
that night, when I was talking to that 
Rabbi, supposed to be a minister of the 
Gospel of ancient Judah, through which 
source has come to us the mighty reve- 
lations of God as He gave them to His 
children upon the earth, which have 
been permitted to come down through 
the stream of time unto us. 

Now the Gospel of Christ has been 
restored to the earth, in fulfillment of 
prophecy. Once more mankind is 
clothed with authority, and those bear- 
ing that authority are sent out to all 
the nations of the earth, and their busi- 
ness is to gather Israel from where they 
have been scattered, bring them here 
and teach them how to worship the God 
of Abraham, the God of Isaac and of 
Jacob, that they may once more stand 
upon the earth as their fathers stood, 



ELDER ANTHONY W. IVINS.

and say that they believe in ' s a God 
who can eat and speak and smell," and 
who does speak to His children upon 
the earth, and believe in modern reve- 
lation as their fathers did. May God 
bless you, in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 

Singing by the choir: 

"Great is the Lord." 

ELDER ANTHONY W. IVINS. 

My brethren and sisters, a very un- 
expected privilege is afforded me this 
afternoon of standing before you and 
bearing my testimony concerning the 
principles of the Gospel of Christ. 

The last words of the hymn which 
was so beautifully sung here, the sec- 
ond hymn, by Brother Thomas and 
the choir, shall furnish me a text for 
the very few remarks that I expect to 
make: "God is with us, and we with 
Him." I ask myself the question, 
when I see these lines, if we are justi- 
fied in asserting that God is with this 
people and we with Him? It is now 
71 years since the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints was or- 
ganized, and what has been the result? 
The Gospel has been preached in al- 
most every civilized country in the 
world, and the thing that brings great- 
est joy to me greatest consolation, 
greatest assurance, is the fact that 
God, in His mercy, has not only given 
me a testimony of the truth of the 
message that He commanded the boy 
Prophet to send out into all the world, 
but that He has given it to all of you! 
and I know that, if the opportunity 
were offered, hundreds of you would 
rise up and bear this same testimony 
with me this afternoon. And that is 
not all. We know that away up in 
ice-locked Norway and Sweden, in Ger- 
many, in Prance, in the British Isles, 
and in the islands of the sea, people are 
gathered together— people with whom 
we never associated, people who are 
strangers to us, people who represent 
many different nations and kindreds 
and tongues, and that they are all 
bearing witness today that Jesus is the 
Christ, and that through His mercy the 
Latter-day dispensation has been 
ushered in through the instru- 
mentality of the Prophet Jo- 
seph Smith. They are all bearing tes- 



timony that there are prophets on 
the earth today. The revelations of 
God are made known for the redemp- 
tion of mankind, and that today the 
gathering of scattered Israel has begun. 
This is a strong evidence that God has 
been with us from the very inception 
of this Church until the present time. 
Has he blessed us in the gathering of 
the people? Why, we extend from 
Canada in the north to Mexico in the 
south. I bring you greeting from Lat- 
ter-day Saints who are laying the 
foundations of Zion securely, firmly and 
well in the lands of the Lamanites upon 
the south; for whatever joy we may 
have in contemplating the great mani- 
festations of God toward us in the past, 
we know that the greater work is yet 
in the future. We know that the re- 
demption of Zion has not yet come. We 
know that before the great day of the 
Lord shall come, that "Jacob will flour- 
ish in the wilderness and the Laman- 
ites blossom as the rose." In 1884, I 
think it was, the Lord revealed to Presi- 
dent Taylor, in a revelation that was 
given to him, that the time had come 
to establish and maintain the Gospel 
among the Lamanites. 

About that time the first Latter-day 
Saint, through force of circumstances, 
crossed the line which divides the 
United States of America from the 
United States of Mexico, and a few- 
straggling colonists, went into that 
country. I am pleased to be able to re- 
port to you now that the blessings of 
the Lord have continued with our la- 
bors there, and we have maintained 
ourselves, that our colonies are prosper- 
ing; that we rejoice because of the con- 
stant manifestations of God's kindness 
and care and blessing to us, that we see 
from day to day. And in that provi- 
dential move we see the beginning of 
the great work which the prophets in- 
dicate must be performed among the 
remnant of Jacob upon this continent 
before Zion shall be redeemed. 

I rejoice in the Gospel of Jesus Christ 
and bear testimony to you that His Gos- 
pel has been restored to the earth not to 
be taken from it again. Jesus sent his 
disciples into all the world to preach 
the Gospel to every creature, but he 
made no promise to them that they 
should prevail. On the other hand, 
when the Gospel was restored in this

GENERAL, CONFERENCE 



dispensation, when John the Baptist 
laid his hands upon the head 
of Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery, 
as he did lay his hands upon 
their heads and bestowed upon them 
the Aaronic Priesthood, he said: 
"Upon you, my fellow servants, in the 
name of the Messiah, I confer the 
Priesthood of Aaron, which holds the 
keys of the ministration of angels, of 
baptism by immersion for the remis- 
sion of sins, and this Priesthood shall 
never be taken from the earth until 
the sons of Levi do offer again an 
offering in righteousness unto the 
Lord." 

We should feel grateful for these 
assurances, that the time has come for 
the consummation of all the promises 
made through the holy Prophets. The 
time of the redemption of Israel, the 
gathering together of His scattered 
people, the redemption of hundreds of 
thousand..-, yes millions of the remnant 
who occupy this country south of us, 
for there are probably 100,000,000 from 
Mexico to. Cape Horn whose blood has 
not been contaminated by admixture 
w T ith any other race. The Gospel is 
about to be preached to them. A mis- 
sion is about to be established in the 
City of Mexico, indicating to us the 
consummation of things that we have 
long desired. The Lord tells us here in 
the Book of Mormon that "Whenever 
you see these things beginning to be 
made known to the remnant of your 
seed, then know that the time is nigh 
when I the Lord will fulfill all my 
promises which I have made to my peo- 
ple. O house of Israel." 

May God strengthen our faith, and 
bless us with fortitude and faith to 
continue until Zion shall triumph, is 
my prayer in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER ELIAS S. KIMBALL. 
Brothers and sisters, about the first 
thing that I want to say is this, that I 
was startled when Brother Taylor 
walked down the aisle and called me to 
the stand. I want to say further that 
I was obedient to the call and I am now 
obedient to the voice of Brother Grant, 
in standing before you to bear my tes- 
timony to the truth of this Gospel. I 
always want to be obedient to the coun- 
sel of the servants of the Lord and al- 



ways to- be willing to listen to the voice 
of the Spirit of God. I want to be 
humble, I want to be meek, I want to 
be lowly in heart; and I want to be 
saved. 

I testify that the Gospel of Jesus 
Christ is true, that it has been revealed 
in the latter-days by God, the Eternal 
Father, through His Spirit, or directly, 
to the Prophet Joseph Smith. His 
Church has been organized with Apos- 
tles, prophets, pastors, evangelists, pas- 
tors and teachers and with other offi- 
cers. There are in the Church the gifts 
and blessings that have been spoken ot 
in the scriptures, and they are true, 
and calculated for the blessing and sal- 
vation of the human family; and I am 
willing to labor with the rest of the 
people in making sacrifices that will be 
necessary for the redemption of the hu- 
man family. I pray God to bless us 
and to bless the people, and to make 
them realize who they are, that they 
are not what some of us sometimes 
think we are, "the blue blood." When 
I think of the origin of our people, think 
of Joseph Smith, Brigham Young, my 
father, and all of the early leaders of 
our people, where they came from, I am 
led to reflect upon the story related by 
our Savior in the parable of the great 
feast. When he sent out his servants 
to invite the r'ch and the wealthv to 
partake of the feast they would not 
come; but nh n he sent out his ser- 
vants pgfin to the highways and by- 
ways, then the poor and the unlearned 
and the low'y among men came and 
partook of the feast. Our people are of 
that class. I believe they are from the 
class of people who are honest and vir- 
tuous and who, with all their imper- 
fections, desire to serve God and keep 
His commandments. 

My heart is full of blessings for our 
people, I desire to see them prosper and 
grow and increase in the earth and to 
be willing to make such sacrifices as 
will be necessary on their part to build 
up the kingdom of God and carry the 
Gospel to the nations of the earth, that 
the honest in heart among all people 
may have the same great blessings and 
privileges that we now enjoy and all 
that the Lord has in store for His peo- 
ple. I feel to bless you, my brothers 
and sisters, in the name of Jesus. Amen. 



ELDER EPHRAIM H. NYE.

ELDER EPHRAIM H. NYE. 

I have great joy, my brethren and sis- 
ters, in being in your midst this day. 1 
rejoice in the knowledge of the Gospel 
of the Son of God, and I am grateful 
that I have the privilege of coming up 
to Zion to listen to the precious truths 
that have been taught during this con- 
ference. It has been food to my soul. I 
have feasted at the fountain of light in 
listening to the instructions that have 
been given up to the present time. You 
have been hearing from many of the 
missions, and I will say that I have 
been laboring in the California mis- 
sion for some length of time, and I take 
pleasure in saying that the spirit of the 
Lord has been with us. We have had 
many good, faithful Elders laboring 
there, and a goodly number of people 
have listened to their testimonies. We 
have good branches in different parts 
of the State, and the Lord is with us 
manifesting His presence by the power 
that He pours out upon His servants in 
the healing of the- sick and the blessing 
and comforting and instructing of the 
Saints. 

One thing struck me very forcibly 
while hearing the instructions of this 
conference — the reference made to the 
necessity of respecting the Priesthood. 
From my earliest childhood, and long 
before my parents ever heard the Gos- 
pel — when, in fact, I was a little boy of 
eight years, my mother taught me to 
read the Scriptures, sitting upon a little 
stool at her feet, while she would be do- 
ing the family sewing. And I learned 
to read the wonderful works of the 
Apostles and of our Savior. I remember 
in that early day of my life my feelings 
when I read of those wonderful things, 
and I thought in my heart, "O, what 
would I not give if I could have lived in 
the days of the Apostles!" When I read 
of our Savior taking little children in 
his arms and blessing them, I thought, 
"O, what would I not give to have been 
one of those little children!" And when 
I read the great works of the Apostles 
in ancient times and the wonderful 
healings that they performed by the 
pow-er of God, I thought, "O, what 
would I not give to have lived in the 
days of the Apostles." I was perhaps 
about 11 years of age when my parents 
found the Gospel. 



A poor, straggling Elder ran against 
the family by some means or other, 
and they all came into the fold, and 
finally all reached Zion. And now I 
"look to the pit" from which "I was 
digged" and the "rock from which I 
was hewn." Far away to the ends of 
the earth, the Lord sent for me, as He 
did for many others. I have from 
that day to this continued to thank 
and to praise and to bless His holy 
name, that He had that love for me, 
a poor, weak mortal, to gather me home 
to His fold; and my soul goes out in 
thanksgiving and praise continually 
that I have been accounted w"orthy, 
amidst the millions of the inhabitants 
of the earth, to be gathered and 
brought to see and permitted to re- 
joice in the knowledge, of the truth. 
And it is a source of gratitude in my 
soul to be permitted to stand in the 
presence of Apostles of the Lord Jesus 
Christ. 

Recently Apostle Grant and Brother 
J. Golden Kimball have been out with 
us in the California mission. It was a 
pleasure, indeed, to me to introduce 
them in that mission; it was a pleas- 
ure greater 'than I can express to in- 
troduce Apostle Grant as one of the 
Apostles of Almighty God. It has been 
a satisfaction to me that I have been 
permitted occasionally to see one of 
the Apostles of the Lord Jesus. What 
other people experience when they 
come into their presence, I do not know; 
but I do know that I never come into 
the presence of one of the Apostles of 
Jesus Christ but I feel the influence 
that surrounds them, and my soul goes 
out in gratitude to the Almighty that 
I am permitted to associate with such 
men, and, in fact, to live in the day 
when they live, and to listen to their 
instructions, that I have the privilege 
to receive the words of the Almighty 
and of eternal truth as they flow from 
their lips, and that I am permitted to 
bow in obedience to their words and 
the requirements they make of me. It 
is a joy to me to be accounted worthy 
to go forth and preach the Gospel to 
the wicked. It is a satisfaction that I 
have never gained in any of the avoca- 
tions in life— and I suppose that I have 
had my share of pleasure in human 
life — but none have ever risen to the 
height of extreme satisfaction that I 



60 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



have enjoyed in preaching the Gospel 
to this generation, lifting up my voice 
to those who know not God. 

I will tell of an instance that oc- 
curred in Los Angeles. There is a cor- 
ner there where they permit us occa- 
sionally to preach upon the street, and 
we often go there to preach. It is the 
lowest down spot in Los Angeles. It is 
where the saloons and the rif-raff of 
that community gather. It is a fact 
that oftentimes when w T e have been 
holding meeting upon those corners, we 
could hardly hear ourselves for the 
lewd songs that were being sung inside 
of the saloons upon each corner of the 
street. 

One night I was there with the breth- 
ren, and we were holding a meeting 
upon that corner. One of the other 
brethren was speaking, and I expected 
to follow him. I was looking at the 
motley crowd that had gathered around 
us. There were negroes, half-breeds, 
Mexicans, Indians, Chinamen and some 
whites. It was about the hardest look- 
ing lot that I ever gazed upon as lis- 
tening to a religious sermon; and as I 
looked at them I thought to myself, 
"Why, if we could baptize this whole 
lot they are not worth having." My 
soul sank clear down to my boots, as it 
seemed, and I felt that I hadn't the 
courage to speak to such a congrega- 
tion. I fairly dreaded the very thoughts 
of the ordeal immediately before me, 
and dreaded the brother stopping that 
was then speaking. Finally every bit of 
courage had oozed out of me when he 
did stop. But I stepped forward, and in 
the weak, humble way that I felt, began 
to speak. I felt so disheartened, so dis- 
couraged to think that there was one 
of the great cities of the country and a 
fine people, but the rules of the city 
councilors were such that we could not 
go upon the better streets; we had to 
take that corner, and here we had to 
stand and speak to such a lot of people. 
However, I began to speak, and as I 
proceeded it seemed to me that the 
Spirit of the Lord came upon me, and 
those old, dark, swarthy visages took 
on a different hue in my mind. Every 
one was leaning forward as far as his 
balance would let him to listen to what 
I said. The most profound attention 
was being given by that hard-looking 
congregation; and as I proceeded to 



speak the Spirit of the Lord rested upon 
me more and more, and it seemed as 
though they became beautiful before me. 
It seemed to me as though, instead 
of having the thought that I wouldn't 
do anything for them, that I could 
not only preach the Gospel to them, 
but if necessary I could lay down my 
life for them. I continued on 
until the Spirit of the Lord rested up- 
on me so abundantly that it seemed as 
though I did not stand upon the 
ground. It seemed as though a mighty 
power surrounded me and caused me 
to see the value of their souls to the 
Lord. The attention they gave was 
wonderful, and I spoke on, filled with 
the Spirit overcome with the joy that 
I had known under no other circum- 
stances in human life. I say to you 
that never, under any conditions in life, 
have I had such joy as I had in preach- 
ir.g to that congregation. They gath- 
ered around in immense numbers until 
they stood all around me. They dou- 
bled and quadrupled in numbers. The 
otner meetings that were being held on 
the opposite corners of the street had 
dismissed, and all their congregations 
had come and gathered around us. and 
we had a grand and a splendid meet- 
irg. We spoke as long as we had pow- 
er to speak. We rejoiced in the knowl- 
edge of the truth; and I wish to state 
that many of our best members in the 
State of California have been caught 
by hearing preaching on the streets. 
No one can tell, as he preaches the 
Gospel upon the street what word he 
says is going to sink down into the 
hearts of his hearers. He does not 
know what sentence he utters or what 
passage of scripture he quotes that is 
going to have its effect upon some- 
body; and so we will be able to stand 
as witnesses against thosa people in 
the great day of judgment, that we 
have preached the Gospel unto them. 
We do gather many, too. Many of 
them become investigators and come 
to our hall meetings which are adver- 
tised, and good, honest souls come out; 
and we are building up branches in that 
mission, and we rejoice with them. 

I wish to say that it seems to me that 
we dc not appreciate fully and to the 
extent we ought the blessings the Al- 
mighty pours out upon us. It seems to 



ELDER J. GOLDEN KIMBALL. 



(il 



me that we do not appreciate the fact 
that we are not groping as the blind 
for the wall upon the grand question of 
religion. Do we appreciate the fact 
that every one of us can commune 
with the Almighty whenever we please 
if we will get down upon our knees 
and do it? Do we appreciate the fact 
that we have men standing in our 
midst who can reach the Lord and 
obtain His mind and will at any time 
under all circumstances; that we, His 
people, need not be in the dark? 

During the whole of this conference 
the great principle of tithing is kept be- 
fore us. The Saints of California pay a 
good tithing. The mission is self-sup- 
porting; and this is one of the things 
that we preach. Not openly; we say 
but very little oi tithing openly; very 
little indeed. But, it is a rule that we 
have in the mission that no one shall be 
baptized until he or she understands the 
principle of tithing perfectly; no one 
shall be led into the waters of baptism 
by any Elder until this grand question 
is laid before him or her. They shall 
not have the privilege of coming up and 
saying, "You have deceived me; you ad- 
vertise that the seats are free and there 
are no collections, but you have some- 
thing you bring forward afterwards in 
the form of tithing." The principle of 
tithing is carefully laid before them be- 
fore they are baptized, and we have 
many there who have paid tithes before 
they were baptized. I regard this prin- 
ciple of tithing as one of the grandest, 
ind it is indeed the touch-stone. He 
vho pays his tithes will not be far out 
of the way on every other question, 

I rejoice in the Gospel? I rejoice that 
I am accounted worthy to bear a por- 
tion of the ministry to the nations of 
the earth, and feel in my soul that it is 
the greatest joy that we can have and 
the grandest work we can perform, and 
I am ready and willing, and gladly will 
I spend the residue of my days in 
preaching the Gospel to the unbelieving 
world. It is my determination to be 
obedient to every requirement that is 
made of me, to live by every word 
that proceedeth forth from the mouth 
of God through His servants, whom He 
has placed and appointed to direct all 
things here upon the earth. This is my 
determination, to live in such a way 
that I can claim the blessings of the 



Lord, and do everything that is re- 
quired of me from this day forth, in all 
my life. God bless you. Amen. 

Elder Heber J. Grant sang the "Holy 
City." 

ELDER J. GOLDEN KIMBALL. 

You have listened to the testimony 
and the preaching of the Apostles and 
Prophets of this Church during this 
conference; but, as Scripture puts it, 
'Are all Apostles, are all Prophets, 
are all Evangelists, Pastors or Teach- 
ers?" I bear my testimony that I thank 
the Lord that, notwithstanding the fact 
that I recognize that the Apostles have 
gifts, powers, appointments and labors 
that it is beyond our prerogatives and 
rights to infringe upon, I thank God, 
the Eternal Father, that we have young 
men, honored of the Lord, that they can 
preach and testify just as well as 
Apostles and Prophets. I desire to say 
to the rising generation, You do not 
have to be Apostles, you do not have 
to be Presidents of Stakes, nor Bishops 
to enjoy the gifts and blessings per- 
taining to the Gospel of the Lord Jesus 
Christ. And I .say to you that some of 
you — and I may be among that num- 
ber—place too much stress upon the 
positions that men hold in the Church, 
and we fancy in our weakness that we 
cannot be saved, that we cannot serve 
God, that we cannot be faithful and 
true and enjoy revelation from God, 
unless we have high office in the 
Church. There is danger in exalted 
position, and where "much is given 
much is required." The poorest man in 
all Israel, though he may carry a hod 
and be dressed like a pauper, is en- 
titled to revelation from God, and he is 
entitled to lay hands on the sick, and 
they shall recover through the prayer 
of faith. I realize a great object les- 
son has been set us by Apostle Grant. 
I have watched this matter carefully, 
and I am able to testify that out of it 
will come great good, that no great ad- 
vancement has ever taken place except 
as a result of faithful and persevering 
effort. I will say that many of the 
young men that have gone east and 
spent fortunes to learn to sing came 
back to this country unappreciated, 
and some of them would be 
in penury were it not for their 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



relatives; for our people are not as 
appreciative as they ought to be, or 
at least they have not been. I admire 
our young people that have learned 
to sing the songs of Zion. I stood on 
that street in Los Angeles, referred to 
by Brother Nye, and listened to our 
young men preach. It was the first 
time in all my labors I had ever heard 
an Elder preach upon the streets. And 
when I asked two Elders why they did 
not commence, they said, "We are un- 
able to begin our meeting until the 
other Elders come, for we cannot 
sing." No meetings can be held in 
California upon the streets unless the 
Elders can sing. It is, in fact, the key 
to the situation. Lots of men can 
sing that are mighty poor preachers. 

Judgment comes with age, as a rule, 
not always. We young men that have 
responsibilities placed upon us often- 
times have a great deal of courage, 
but may lack judgment. The point I 
want to get at is this: we must have 
some very brave and courageous men. 
Apostle Grant with the assistants that 
will go with him, may open up a mis- 
sion in Japan. Some Apostle may be 
sent to Russia, to open the door in 
that great nation, and it may be the 
privilege of some of us to go and get 
killed after the doors are opened. The 
Gospel will never be preached to every 
nation, kindred, tongue and people 
without lives being lost, nor without 
your eating "the bread of adversity 
and drinking the water of affliction." 
And we may not all be successful, but 
when a man is willing to lay down his 
life, and takes his life in his hands and 
labors for the kingdom of God, he can 
do no more. He might make mistakes, 
and he might err in judgment. David, 
that boy as he was, went out and 
killed Goliath. If he had not all Israel 
would have pointed the finger of scorn 
at David. Dewey succeeded; but had 
Dewey failed, he would have been in 
ignominy and disgrace before the 
American people. So I wonder if it is 
only the man that succeeds that gets 
the praise. I have heard or read of a 
man that went to the World's Parlia- 
ment of Religions. He did not 
succeed, because they would not 
hear him. I read of another 
man that went to Congress, and 
it took 7,000,000 signatures to get rid of 



him. And I tell you that great good 
will come out of it. I admire courage 
and bravery as well as judgment and 
wisdom. We have to have brave men 
and courageous men, and we young 
men have to learn, and the only way 
we can learn is by trying, like Brother 
Grant. My heart swelled within me 
when I heard him sing today. My 
heart swelled with joy when I heard 
him sing at President Snow's birthday 
party, for I knew he sang with the 
Spirit of God; and the Lord will an- 
swer his prayers for he has an object 
in view. And I know what that object 
is. and it is a righteous object. 

As iong as a man has a righteous ob- 
ject he has a right to make an effort; 
and if he makes any mistakes, it is my 
duty to reach out to him my hand, 
even the hand of charity. And if you 
Latter-day Saints do not do it. and 
some of us young men fail because of 
your severe criticisms and your unkind 
statements, God will hold you responsi- 
ble. We have seen men handled be- 
cause they waded into mysteries, and, 
of course, it was proper and right 
when they waded into mysteries and 
preached false doctrines that they 
should be handled. I can see the 
righteousness of it, but I wonder if any 
man has ever been handled in the 
kingdom of God for not knowing any- 
thing. I am in favor of some of them 
being handled right away. I pray the 
Lord to bless you. Amen. 

ELDER HEBER J. GRANT. 

Brother Taylor desires that, inasmuch 
as I am about to leave for a foreign 
country, and this is about the last 
chance I will have to meet with the 
Saints for many years, that I should 
occupy the rest of the time. I would 
have been perfectly willing to divide the 
time with him, because a person can 
bear a testimony at any time in a very 
few minutes, and the only thing I in- 
tended tJ do today was simply to bear 
my testimony and leave it with you 
before departing upon my mission. 

I regret that I failed in my object 
lesson. I would have been glad had I 
been able to sing that song through 
without a mistake. I have only sung 
it through five times today without a 
mistake, but when I tried it the sixth 



ELDER HEBER J. GRANT.

time I got an error in it. But I haven't 
got over my nervousness when stand- 
ing before the assembled people to sing. 
I suppose the reason is, I don't know 
"where I am at." I am like a boat 
without a rudder, so to speak, when I 
try to sing. To give you an illustra- 
tion: I was a short time ago at a 
dinner party at Brother Cannon's and 
one of the people present requested me 
to sing "O, My Father," and simul- 
taneously another one of the company 
asked me to sing, "God moves in a 
mysterious way." I asked Sister Snow 
if she would kindly play that in the 
key of F. She had heard one of the 
parties ask me to sing one piece and I 
had heard the other ask me for the 
other one, and she played "O, My Fath- 
er," and I sang "God moves in a mys- 
terious way." As good fortune would 
have it, the first three notes of these 
songs are identically the same, and 
Sister Snow discovered what I was 
trying to do, and therefore played, 
"Gcd moves in a mysterious way," and 
we got through all right. I thought the 
music sounded a little strange, although 
I had heard it a great many times be- 
fore; but it hadn't made any such im- 
pression upon me that I was able to 
tell ti:e difference. 

I have a letter clear from the Philip- 
pine Islands, in which I was told, 
among other things, "Don't try to 
sing." The writer says: "I am in earn- 
est." He is one of my nearest friends 
too, Major Young; in fact, he and I 
grew up together, almost. And he tells 
his reason he says, "Because you will 
be subjected to ridicule, and there will 
be a great deal of criticism." I have 
had a great many of my friends come 
to me and beg me not to sing. Six 
months ago one of my fellow Apostles 
said to me, "Come in, Heber. but don't 
sing." The same Apostle last night 
asked me to sing "God moves in a mys- 
terious way," and after I got through 
complimented me upon it. I said after- 
ward, "I noted your remarks in the 
Priesthood meeting, when you told men 
who had been ordained to the office of 
Patriarch, that they could not enjoy 
the spirit of the office unless they gave 
patriarchial blessings; and now," said 
I. "if you will tell me how I will learn 
to sing without singing, I will thank 



you." He said, "Sing every chance 
you get, Brother Grant, but do your 
first singing down in Mexico or Arizona 
or somewhere a long way off." I said, 
"I have already tried that," and I have 
tried it at home, and I sang this same 
song the other night at home. But I 
will never learn to sing before a large 
audience until I try. I prop-se to sing 
the "Holy City" in the big Tabernacle 
before I get through with it, and I pro- 
pose to sing it without a mistake. I 
do not say this boastingly, because I 
believe what Alma of old said, in the 
29th chapter of his book, that "God 
granteth unto men according to their 
desires, whether they be for good or for 
evil, for joy or remorse of conscience." 
I desire to sing, and I expect to work 
at it and to stay right with it until I 
learn. The most I ever worked was to 
sing 400 songs in four days; that is the 
biggest amount of work I have ever 
done in the singing line. There are a 
great many people that can learn to 
sing very easily. When I started to 
learn to sing it took me four months 
to learn a couple of simple hymns and 
recently I learned one in three hours by 
the watch and then sang it without a 
mistake. 

"That which we persist in doing be- 
comes easier for us to do; not that the 
nature of the thing itself is changed, 
but that our power to do is increased." 
I propose to keep at it until my power 
to do is increased to the extent that I 
can sing the songs of Zion. Nobody 
knows the joy I have taken in 
standing up in the Tabernacle and 
other places and joining in the singing, 
because it used to be a perfect annoy- 
ance to me to try and to fail, besides 
annoying those around me; because I 
would sing, because I loved the words 
of the songs of Zion. 

I am very sorry now for having per- 
secuted people as I used to. In our 
meetings in the Temple the brethren 
would say "That is as impossible as it 
is for Brother Grant to carry a tune," 
and that settled it; everybody ac- 
knowledged that was one of the im- 
possibilities. I believe what the Lord 
says, "My soul delighteth in the song 
of the heart, yea, the song of the 
righteous is a prayer unto me, and it 
shall be answered with a blessing upon

their head." I desire to serve the Lord, 
and pray unto him in the songs of Zion; 
and I know that it produces a good in- 
fluence. 

Now I wish to say something on an- 
other subject. In the providences of the 
Lord I may be one of those that Brother 
Kimball referred to; I may go to Japan 
and never come back. I have never 
been guilty, I believe, of preaching be- 
yond the prescribed time of two hours, 
only when I have been out in Mexico, 
or so far away from home that they 
didn't see me very often. Why? Be- 
cause I knew how they would go out 
and complain about it. But as this 
will be the last chance to speak to you 
for a few years, I desire to say a few 
words more. I give you fair warning. 
I am going to talk as long as I want to, 
and there are lots of doors, and any- 
body that gets tired can go out and it 
won't hurt my feelings at all. 

I rejoice in the Gospel, I rejoice in 
the rich outpourings of the Holy Spirit 
that have been given in the instructions 
imparted during this conference. I re- 
joice with Brother Kimball, that every 
Latter-day Saint, every humble son 
and daughter of God that has embraced 
the Gospel and become a member of the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints has received the witness of the 
Holy Spirit, that the gift of tongues, the 
gift of prophecy, of healing, and other 
gifts and blessings, are found in the 
Church, and are not confined to men 
that hold responsible positions in the 
Church. I have listened to some of the 
most spirited, and able, and some 
of the finest sermons of my life from 
men who held no official position. I 
remember in the Thirteenth ward lis- 
tening to a very gifted sermon by a 
finely educated man who had a mar- 
velous command of language. After- 
wards Brother Millen Atwood, who at 
that time was not holding any posi- 
tion of an official character, stood up 
as a home missionary in that ward, 
and if that man had been hired to mur- 
der the Queen's English he couldn't 
have done it more perfectly. I had 
just been studying grammar, and, there- 
fore, it grated on my ears, as I sup- 
pose my singing would grate upon the 
ear^ of a person that understood fine 
music. But my heart was touched, and 



tears welled up in my eyes because of 
the rich outpourings of the Holy Spirit 
upon that man, and there was an im- 
pression made upon my heart of the di- 
vinity of this work and the fact that 
Joseph Smith is a Prophet of God that 
to this day I ha.\ e not forgotten. It is 
not position, it is not education that 
gives the Spirit of God; but it is keep- 
ing the commandments of Almighty 
Geo and being lowly in heart and desir- 
ing to fulfill the commandments of God 
in our daily walk and conversation. I 
bear witness to you here today that no 
man has ever fallen in this Church, and 
no man ever will fall in this Church, 
who is honest in his heart, honest in 
the payment of his tithes and offer- 
ings, who obeys the "Word of Wisdom, 
who attends to his family pray- 
ers and his secret prayers, and 
who attends to his quorum meetings; 
no man will fall who is doing his duty 
in this Church. But Satan has power 
over those who become selfish and sor_ 
did and set their hearts upon the things 
of this earth and fail to render thanks 
in all things unto God. 

I bear testimony to you today that 
God lives; that I know that Jesus is 
the Christ; that I know that Joseph 
Smith was a Prophet of the true and 
living God; that I know that we will 
live forever if we keep the command- 
ments of God. I know that we have 
Apostles, Prophets, Patriarchs or 
Evangelists in the Church. I know that 
they have the inspiration of their offices 
and calling's. I know that the Gospel 
tree is alive, that fruit grows upon the 
tree, as I have reached out my hand 
and plucked the fruit thereof, and have 
eaten it. I have sat by the death-bed 
of my last living son, a boy upon 
whom I had set my heart and whom I 
expected to grow up and labor for the 
interests of God's kingdom; standing 
up, as it were, in my place; I have 
seen that child die without shedding a 
tear, and I know that the comforting 
Spirit from God was in my home when 
I saw him die. I love God and I love 
the Latter-day Saints, and I ask for 
your prayers in my behalf during my 
absence. May God grant His blessings 
upon us at all times, I ask in the name 
of Jesus. Amen.

ELDER BRIGHAM YOUNG. 

The Saints the victims of misrepresentation— The 
gathering of Israel— Enemies of truth injure 
the nation— Saints will save it from destruction. 

It is very gratifying to me to behold 
this vast audience assembled for the 
purpose of hearing the servants of the 
Lord speak of His goodness' and mercy, 
and showing the gratitude which we 
owe to Him for the blessings of this 
day. I would like the attention of the 
people, for it will be difficult to make 
all hear my voice in this building in its 
present crowded condition. 

I desire to add my testimony to that 
of my brethren who have addressed 
you during the conference. If there 
ever was a people upon the earth who 
had occasion to manifest gratitude, 
thanksgiving and praise to Almighty 
God, this people certainly have. It has 
been a year since our last annual con- 
ference, and six months since we met 
in semi-annual conference. If we have 
come with prayer in our hearts and 
blessings for our fellow men, the Lord 
will be with us. We need a vast amount 
of teaching. Frequently we feel in- 
capable of sustaining the weight rest- 
ing upon us, and the vicissitudes of life 
are more than we can bear sometimes, 
and if it were not for the overruling 
providences of our Father we could not 
endure the pressure that is brought to 
bear, sometimes by friends and often 
by foes, upon the work of God. 



I wish that the people of the world, 
especially the United States, could 
know us as we are. I remember a re- 
mark that my father made to a certain. 
United States official who had served 
his time as a Territorial officer here and 
was about to take his departure. Af- 
ter this official had remarked that he 
had been well treated and he was glad 
to know the people, my father turned 
to him and said, "I am glad to hear 
you express your feelings in that 
way. If you will be good enough 
to tell the truth about us when you 
go hence, that is all we ask." What 
is the reason that our neighbors 
are not of our faith. Here we have men 
in our midst who cling to honor as they 
cling to life — honorable men in almost 
everything — and yet they hesitate no 
more to lie about us than they do to 
take their salary for what they do. It 
is a little mysterious to me. If they 
would only tell the truth, and give the 
people of the United States a fair 
chance, I would be glad. The people in 
the East and West labor under disad- 
vantages that the people who are 
among us do not; and it seems to me 
that if those who mingle so freely with 
the Latter-day Saints, and who traduce 
them more freely, would only represent 
us to the people at large just as we are, 
we would be better and more favorably 
known. But individuals stand in the 
way, and villify, malign and bear false 
witness against the people who compose 
the Church of Christ upon the earth. 
It is possible that they do not know 
what they are doing. It seems to me, 
though, that they are working for a 
purpose, and nothing will satisfy them 
except we destroy the God we worship 
and adopt the God (?) that they pre- 
tend to worship. 

I want to read a little about the con- 
dition of things today, from the Book 
of Mormon. Jesus Christ was on this 
land about two thousand years ago, 
and He gave the people His doctrine. 
In speaking of the future of this land 
and of the people who should dwell on 
it. He said: 

"And, verily, I say unto you, I give 
unto you a sign, that ye may know the 
time when these things shall be about 
to take place, that I shall gather in 
from their long dispersion, my people.

of the house of Israel, and shall estab- 
lish again among them my Zion. 

"And behold, this is the thing which 
I will give unto you for a sign, for 
verily I say unto you, that when these 
things which I declare unto you, and 
which I shall declare unto you here- 
after of myself, and by the power of 
the Holy Ghost, which shall be given 
unto you of the Father, shall be made 
known unto the Gentiles; that they may 
know concerning this people who are a 
remnant of the house of Jacob.; and 
concerning this my people who shall be 
scattered by them. 

"Verily, verily, I say unto you, when 
these things shall be made known unto 
them of the Father, and shall come 
forth of the Father, from them unto 
you: 

"For it is wisdom in the Father that 
they should be established in this land, 
and be set up as a free people by the 
power of the Father, that these things 
might come forth from them unto a 
remnant of your seed, that the cove- 
nant of the Father may be fulfilled 
which he hath covenanted with His 
people, O house of Israel; 

"Therefore, when these works, and 
the works which shall be wrought 
among you hereafter, shall come forth 
from the Gentiles unto your seed, which 
■ shall dwindle in unbelief because of 
iniquity; 

"For thus it behoveth the Father that 
it should come forth from the Gentiles, 
that he may show forth His power 
unto the Gentiles, for this cause, that 
the Gentiles, if they will not harden 
their hearts, that they may repent and 
come unto me, and be baptized in my 
name, and know of the true points of 
my doctrine, that they may be num- 
bered among my people, O house of 
Israel; 

"And when these things come to 
pass, that thy seed shall begin to know 
these things, it shall be a sign unto 
them, that they may know that the 
"work of the Father hath already com- 
menced unto the fulfilling of the cove- 
nant which he hath made unto the peo- 
ple who are of the house of Israel. 

"And when that day shall come, it 
shall come to pass that kings shall shut 
their mouths; for that which had not 
been told them they shall see; and that 
which they had not heard shall they 
consider. 

"For in that day, for my sake shall 
the Father work a work, which shall 
be a great and marvelous work among 
them; and there shall be among them 
who will not believe it, although a man 
shall declare it unto them. 

"But behold the life of my servant 
shall be in my hand; therefore they 
shall not hurt him, although he shall 
be marred because of them. Yet I will 
heal him, for I will show unto them 
that my wisdom is greater than the 
cunning of the devil. 

"Therefore it shall come to pass, that 



whosoever will not believe in my words, 
who am Jesus Christ, whom the Father 
shall cause him to bring forth unto 
the Gentiles, and shall give unto him 
power that he shall bring them forth 
unto the Gentiles, (it shall be done even 
as Moses said,) they shall be cut off 
from among my people who are of the 
covenant. 

"And my people who are a remnant 
of Jacob, shall be among the Gentiles, 
yea, in the midst of them as a lion 
among the beasts of the forest, as a 
young lion among the flocks of sheep, 
who, if he go through both treadeth 
down and teareth in pieces, and none 
can deliver. 

"Their hand shall be lifted up upon 
their adversaries, and all their enemies 
shall be cut off. 

"Tea, wo be unto the Gentiles, ex- 
cept they repent, for it shall come to 
pass in that day, saith the Father that 
I will cut off thy horses out of the 
midst of thee, and I will destroy thy 
chariots. 

"And I will cut off the cities of thy 
land, and throw down all thy strong- 
holds; 

"And I will cut off witchcrafts out of 
thy hand, and thou shalt have no more 
soothsayers; 

"Thy graven images I will also cut 
off, and thy standing images out of the 
midst of thee, and thou shalt no more 
worship the works of thy hands; 

"And I will pluck up thy groves out 
of the midst of thee; so will I destroy 
thy cities. 

"And it shall come to pass that all 
lyings, and deceivings, and envyings, 
and strifes, and priestcrafts, and 
whoredoms, shall be done away. 

"For it shall come to pass, saith the 
Father, that at that day whosoever will 
not repent and come unto my beloved 
Son, them will I cut off from among 
my people, O house of Israel; 

"And I will execute vengeance and 
fury upon them, even as upon the 
heathen, such as they have not heard. 

"But if they will repent, and hearken 
unto my words, and harden not their 
hearts, I will establish my church 
among them, and they shall come in 
unto the covenant, and be numbered 
among this the remnant of Jacob, unto 
whom I have given this land for their 
inheritance, 

"And they shall assist my people, the 
remnant of Jacob, and also, as many 
of the house of Israel as shall come, 
that they may build a city, which shall 
be called the New Jerusalem; 

"And then shall they assist my people 
that they may be gathered in, who are 
scattered upon all the face of the 
land, in unto the New Jerusalem. 

"And then shall the power of heaven 
come down among them; and I also will 
be in the midst; 

"And then shall the work of the Fa- 
ther commence at that day, even when 
this Gospel shall be preached among

the remnant of this people. Verily I 
say unto you, at that day shall the 
work of the Father commence among 
all the dispersed of my people; yea, 
even the tribes which have been lost, 
which the Father hath led away out of 
Jerusalem. 

"Yea, the work shall commence 
among: all the dispersed of my people, 
with the Father, to prepare the way 
whereby they may come unto me, that 
they may call on the Father in my 
name; 

"Yea, and then shall the work com- 
mence, with the Father, among- all na- 
tions in preparing the way whereby 
His people ma- be gathered home to 
the land of their inheritance. 

"And they shall go out from all na- 
tions; and they shall not go out in 
haste, nor go by flight, for I will go 
before them, saith the Father, and I 
will be their rearward." 

Chap. 21st of III Nephi. 

The indications to me are that the 
adversary is doing all in his power to 
destroy the work which God has es- 
tablished. Christ Himself, looking to 
this day, and to this nation, the glory 
and unity of which has been preserved 
up to the present day, said that if the 
Gentiles would receive His Gospel, and 
not harden their hearts against His 
word, which should come through His 
Prophet, He would gather them in and 
number them among His people of the 
house of Israel, and they would be- 
come a chosen seed. These are the 
conditions which exist today. The Lord 
raised up the Prophet Joseph Smith 
and restored His Gospel. That Gospel 
has been and is being declared unto 
the people of this nation, and if they 
receive it, it will be well with them. 
Perhaps I am a little uncharitable, but 
today I look upon every effort that is 
made to misrepresent this people as an 
injury to this nation. These men who 
are doing all in their power against 
the work of God, which has been es- 
tablished for the benefit and bless- 
ing of this nation, are in reali- 
ty, though they may not know 
it, seeking to destroy the great 
United States as a nation. By their 
misrepresentations of the Church of 
Christ, they are preventing good, hon- 
est people from even listening to the 
principles we have to present to them. 
They wont receive it themselves, and 
they prevent others from receiving it. 
Men who are seeking to lift themselves 
into place and power stand in the way 



and prevent the honest in heart of this 
nation taking advantage of the promise 
of the Savior and coming into the fold, 
so that we may perpetuate this glorious 
nation and those constitutional princi- 
ples which have made it one of the 
foremost nations of the world. This 
nation is classed along with the oldest, 
although it has sprung up within a cen- 
tury and a quarter; it is looked upon as 
a nation that is full of intelligence.pow- 
er and patriotism, and it is respected 
throughout the civilized world. Yet, ac- 
cording to the words of Christ in this 
book, if the people of this nation are 
so blinded that they will not consider 
what He has to offer them by H ; s ser- 
vant — if they will not receive the Gos- 
pel, then fhall their horses be cut off 
out of their midst, their cities shall be 
destroyed, (heir strongholds shall be 
thrown down, and their strength shall 
become weakness. I want to add, if that 
day shall come, through the rejection of 
this Gospel by the people of these Unit- 
ed Stats, t ie Latter-day Saints will 
rise up in the power and majesty of the 
priesthood, and they will bear off the 
Ccnst'tut on of the United States. That 
was given by revelation, and we will 
defend it with the last drop of blood we 
have in our bodies and the last dollar 
in our pockets; God will reject those 
wicked men and women who have 
sought to blind the minds of the hon- 
est and thereby brought trouble and 
woe upon this nation. 

Those who will stand up for the rights 
of men will combine with us, and we 
will form a nucleus that shall uphold 
and sustain, by our patriotism, our 
acts, our means and our lives, the glori- 
ous institutions which God has founded 
for the express purpose of having this 
a free land, where His sons and daugh- 
ters can come and rejoice in the plenti- 
tude of His mercies. 

Who is there among the Latter-day 
Saints that will not live for this glori- 
ous end? Who is there that cannot see 
the condition of things and what we 
have before us? If he has the Spirit of 
God in his heart, his soul is lifted to his 
Creator; and knowing that his Father 
looks upon the inmost recesses of his 
boul, he realizes that he must bear him- 
self valiantly in the sight of heaven. 
May God help us to be valiant Latter- 
day Saints, and never to be recreant 



OS

to those principles which the Lord has 
established, upon this continent. If 
men will not receive them, let us live 
them the more closely and thoroughly, 
and fill our mission acceptably. I say 
to you — and I feel it in every fibre of my 
body — that this land will never be given 
to another people and Israel, together 
with the virtuous, the honest, the God- 
fearing will hold the reins of govern- 
ment upon this land, and the people of 
every nation will rejoice, because God 
will bring it to pass. 

May God bless us, brethren and sis- 
ters. Let us hold fast to that which is 
pure and upright, eschew evil, and put 
away our follies from among us. A 
young man said to me, "I can't go to 
my quorum meeting tonight." "What 
is the matter?" "I have been smoking, 
and they will smell my breath." That 
is one of the evils. What is that young 
man doing? He is cutting himself off 
from the presence of the Spirit of God, 
which he must have in him to enable 
him to perform his duty. Another one 
said, "I can't go to the quorum meet- 
ing tonight." Why? "I have been 
drinking some beer and smoking an old 
pipe, and I dare not go." For the sake 
of gratifying his appetite he cannot at- 
tend his duties as a Latter-day Saint. 
This is a little thing to mention in com- 
parison with the glorious things that 
we have to think of; but these are the 
small foxes that spoil the vines. God 
help us to sweep away these things, and 
do away with wickedness. Let the 
glorious truth triumph in our hearts. 
God help us that we may reach out, 
with all the strength and power He 
gives us, unto that end which we are 
destined to attain to, and finally be 
saved in His kingdom, is my prayer in 
the name of Jesus. Amen.

entitled, "Eternal Rest." 

PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 

The assembly a grand sight to gaze upon — The 
Saints prominent before the nations — The 
Lord has wonderfully blessed them— Facilities 
for progress — Importance of obedtf nee to the 
law o f tithing — Duties of officers of Ihe Priest 
hood— Folly of setting aside the counsels of 
God — A powerful testimony to the truth. 

My brethren and sisters, I arise be- 
fore you feeling very dependent upon 
the Lord for what I shall say. I have 



thought over and over again, while lis- 
tening to my brethren, what subject I 
might dwell upon, if called to speak, 
and for the life of me I could not fix in 
my mind a single subject on which to 
speak. I am therefore entirely in the 
hands of the Lord, to speak as the Spirit 
shall direct. I have had delight in hear- 
ing the testimonies and counsels of the 
brethren who have spoken to us during 
the Conference. They have all enjoj-ed 
the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, and 
each one has given to us meat in due 
season, so that if our minds were capa- 
ble of retaining that which has been 
said to us during the Conference, we 
would go away from here richly in- 
structed. I trust that the good Spirit 
may remain with us to the end of our 
meetings, that at the conclusion we 
may feel that it has been good to wait 
upon the Lord and to be present at this 
seventy-first anniversary of the organ- 
ization of the Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints. 

It is a grand sight to look upon this 
vast assemblage of people. I wonder if 
at any previous time in the history of 
God's dealings with the children of men 
there was ever such a sight as we be- 
hold here today — this large Tabernacle 
filled to overflowing, every seat occu- 
pied, and people standing in the aisles 
and along the walls; and just over the 
way, in the Assembly Hall, another 
gathering of Latter-day Saints, unable 
to gain admittance to this building, are 
worshipping the Lord, and celebrating 
this day of prosperity, joy and happi- 
ness for the people of the kingdom of 
God; for notwithstanding our individ- 
ual deprivations and afflictions, and the 
absence from us of one of our beloved 
leaders (President George Q. Cannon), 
there never was a time in the history 
of this Church when the people were 
more blessed of the Lord, temporally 
and spiritually, than they are today. I 
do not think there ever has been a time 
in the history of this Church when our 
people occupied a more prominent posi- 
tion before the gaze of the nation of 
which we form a part and before the 
eyes of the nations of the earth, than 
they do today. The Lord Almighty is 
with His people, and He has poured out 
His Spirit upon those that have been 
willing and prepared to receive it. I 



PRESIDENT JOSEPH P. SMITH.

feel in my heart that the time has come 
when the Lord is not only willing, but 
desirous to pour out upon His people 
every blessing- that they are prepared 
to receive; and I sometimes feel that 
He is already bestowing upon us bles- 
sings of which we are, to some extent, 
unworthy. I believe that the Lord is 
willing to bestow light, intelligence and 
a knowledge of His truth, by the inspi- 
ration of His Holy Spirit, upon all His 
sons and daughters who are living in 
such a manner as to be worthy to re- 
ceive it. It is our privilege to obtain 
revelation, not only concerning our own 
duty, but also with regard to our kin- 
dred who have gone behind the veil, 
and whose hearts are turned unto their 
children, to whom they are looking for 
deliverance and for the benefits of the 
ordinances of the Gospel of Jesus 
Christ, which we are privileged to ad- 
minister in their behalf. There never 
was a time, until within the last few 
years, when the Latter-day Saints had 
access to four temples in which to ad- 
minister the ordinances of the Gospel 
for the living and for the dead; and 
those four are becoming too distant — at 
least, the people are becoming so nu- 
merous in distant parts of the country 
that even though we have four temples 
in which to administer the ordinances 
of the Gospel, there are thousands of 
our people who are practically deprived 
of the privilege of enjoying them, be- 
cause they are so far removed from 
them. Under these circumstances, I 
foresee the necessity arising for other 
temples or places consecrated to the 
Lord for the performance of the or- 
dinances of God's house, so that the 
people may have the benefits 
of the house of the Lord 
without having to travel hun- 
dreds of miles for that purpose. 

Now, are we coming to a knowledge 
of the truth? Or are we like those of 
whom Paul spoke, ever learning, but 
never coming to the knowledge of the 
truth? With the efforts of the Apos- 
tles, of the First Presidents of Seven- 
ties, the Seventies, the Elders, the 
Presidents of Stakes, the High Coun- 
cilors and the Bishops, whose duty it 
is to instruct the people in relation to 
the principles of life and salvation, 
there certainly ought to be a thorough 



performance of duty; but notwithstand- 
ing the labors of those who have been 
and who are teachers among us, it 
would seem as though there was still 
a great lack, and that many come far 
short of performing their duties. We 
have every facility for receiving in- 
struction, and we have the Bible, the 
Book of Mormon and the Doctrine and 
Covenants, which we can read by the 
spirit in which they were written; yet 
many of us are lacking in faith and 
in the knowledge of the truth. Not 
long ago the Presiding Bishop came to 
the President's office and brought with 
him a large volume containing ten 
thousand names of reputed members of 
the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints. He placed it before Presi- 
dent Snow and said, "President Snow, 
here is a list of ten thousand members 
of the Church who are non-tithe pay- 
ers." Just think of it! With all the 
facilities we have of coming to an un- 
derstanding of the truth, with the doc- 
trines of Christ before us in the in- 
spired books which we have— the Bible, 
which speaks so plainly in relation to 
the principle of tithing; the Book of 
Mormon, which repeats the law of tith- 
ing; and the book of Doctrine and Cov- 
enants, which contains the revelations 
the Lord gave through the Prophet 
Joseph Smith— and professing as we do 
to be Latter-day Saints, yet there are 
ten thousand non-tithepayers among 
us! We meet together from Sabbath to 
Sabbath, partake of the Sacrament of 
the Lord's Supper, belong to various 
quorums of the Priesthood, and not- 
withstanding all this there are -so many 
who have not yet learned this 
one principle, and who do not seem to 
understand that it Is a command of God! 
unto this people. It is not only a com- 
mand, but it is given as the word of 
the Lord with promise; for by obedience 
to it we are to be delivered. When the 
earth shall be burned, and when the 
proud and they that do wickedly shall 
become as stubble under the feet of 
men, the Lord has declared that those 
who are tithed shall not be burned. 
Furthermore, the promise is that if we 
will observe this law this land which 
He has given to us shall be a land of 
Zion unto us, a land of promise, a land 
that shall be blessed of the Lord, a land! 



GENERAL, CONFERENCE. 



that the curse shall be removed from, 
that shall be blessed unto the husband- 
man, and that shall become fertile and 
fruitful. Notwithstanding this glori- 
ous promise, it is said there are amongst 
us ten thousand whose names are not 
inscribed upon the roll of honor nor 
written in the book of the law of the 
Lord. For them, according to the word 
of God, there will be non-inheritance 
in Zion when He shall choose those who 
shall be worthy to go there and build 
up the center Stake; neither will their 
children have inheritance there, nor 
their posterity after them; for their 
names will not be found enrolled in the 
book of the law of the Lord. 

We may think this a very simple 
thing. Let us look at it for a moment. 
It is claimed that there are sixty-nine 
thousand tithepayers in the Church, 
who have paid all the way from one dol- 
lar to hundreds of dollars a year. Sup- 
pose that there had been only ten thou- 
sand tithepayers, and fifty-nine thou- 
sand had refrained from paying tith- 
ing. How would you build temples 
and tabernacles? How would you 
maintain the ministry of the Church, 
feed and clothe the poor, and aid and 
educate the fatherless and the orphan? 
What would be your resources to build 
up Zion and to establish the kingdom 
of God in the earth? You would not 
have enough to do it. Where would 
be the revenue of the Church if 
all the people were as negligent of 
their duty and as thoughtless in 
regard to the necessities of the cause 
of Zion as the ten thousand non-tithe- 
payers have been? How would we ac- 
complish anything of a material char- 
acter? We would be like the sec- 
tarian world — powerless; and even 
more so, for while other denominations 
do not have the law of tithing, yet they 
have enthusiastic, wealthy men and 
women who from time to time turn 
over their thousands — in some cases 
fifty to a hundred thousand at a time — 
for the building of their churches and 
for the accomplishment of the work 
they desire to perform. I am extreme- 
ly thankful that there are sixty-nine 
thousand tithepayers in the Church, 
and I wish that all of them were so 
prosperous that they could and would 
pay large amounts of means and prod- 



ucts into the storehouse of the Lord, 
that there might be wherewith to meet 
all the necessities of the cause of Zion. 

I want to state here that which is in 
my heart. You may call it a prophecy if 
you will. Those who are and con- 
tinue to be enrolled in the book of the 
law of the Lord — on the tithing records 
of the Church — will continue to prosper,, 
their substance will increase, and they 
will have added unto them in greater 
abundance everything that they need; 
while those whose names are not re- 
corded in the book of the law of the 
Lord will begin to diminish in that 
which they possess, until they will feel 
sorely the chastening hand of God. I 
do not predict that as a threat. I do 
not do it to scare the non-tithepayers 
in the least. You know, we are great 
American citizens. Every member of 
the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints, who has come to the United 
States and lived here long enough to 
become a citizen, is a citizen of this 
great Republic, and we are exceedingly 
independent; we do not scare worth a 
cent, to use a slang phrase. I do not 
make this prediction to scare anybody, 
or with a view to working on anybody's 
superstitious feelings. I merely state 
it as a Bible truth, as a 
declaration of the Prophets, 
recorded in holy writ. I can 
read it to you from the Book of Mor- 
mon, in substance; I can read it to you 
from the Bible; for in ancient times the 
people of God robbed Him in their 
tithes and offerings, until He came out 
against them, until their land became 
dust under their feet and refused to 
yield in its strength unto them, they 
were afflicted, with mildew, with the 
rust and with the devouring insect, 
until they were wasted, impoverished 
and brought down low, because of their 
disobedience to the command of God. 
So it is not inconsistent for me to re- 
peat in principle that which has been 
declared by the mouths of Prophets in 
ancient times respecting the obedience 
of the people of God to this important 
principle upon which we are dependent 
for the means of progress, increase ana 
building up. 

The tithings of the people are not 
used for the aggrandizement of rnen. 
They are not used to enrich individuals. 



PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH.

Some few. whose time is entirely en- 
grossed in the labors of the ministry, 
and who have not time to look out for 
themselves, are allowed a pittance, to 
keep the wolf from their doors. They 
are permitted to have bread to eat, and 
simple clothing to wear. But they are 
not allowed great salaries, by which 
they can build themselves up and be- 
come enriched at the expense of the 
people. I want to tell you that if I 
were dependent upon what I receive 
from the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints for the support of 
myself and family, and I had nothing 
else to rely upon, my family would go 
hungry; we would go without many of 
the very necessary things of life. I 
have to pay hundreds of dollars every 
year for taxes. We have to provide 
homes for our families, and we are 
bound to take care of them. Not only 
are we bound to do this by our own 
honor and covenants, and by the natur- 
al obligations which rest upon us; but 
we are bound to do it even by the .senti- 
ment of our enemies. They would con- 
demn us if we did not provide for our 
families. Moreover, the Bible says 
that he who will not provide 
for his own household is worse than 
an infidel. The result is, I have a num- 
ber of homes in Salt Lake, on which I 
have to pay taxes; and when I pay my 
taxes, my tithing, and my donations to 
this, that, and the other, I find little 
left to support my family with. Hence 
I say, jf I were entirely dependent upon 
that which I receive from the Church, 
we would go to bed hungry. But the 
Lord has blessed me otherwise. I have 
been prospered in engaging in certain 
enterprises; and from such sources I 
am able to derive some assistance. I 
mention this simply to show that these 
men whose whole time is occupied in 
the ministry are only drawing their 
necessary support from the Church. 
They must have that. You would not 
begrudge them that. Men who are 
faithful, valiant, instant in season and' 
out of season, and constantly engaged 
in the work of the ministry, you surely 
would not say that they should not 
have food to eat, raiment to wear, and 
where to lay their heads; and that is all 
these men get from the Church. The 
laborer is certainly worthy of his hire. 



So that your tithing is not enriching 
your brethren of the ministry. It is be- 
ing used to keep up the ordinances of 
the house of God in these four temples. 
Thousands and thousands of dollars 
of it are being used in educating the 
youth of Zion and in maintaining the 
Church schools. Thousands of dollars 
are being expended to feed and clothe 
the poor, and to take care of those who 
are dependent upon the Church. They 
look to their "mother" for succor and 
support, and it is right and proper that 
the Church should provide for its own 
poor and indigent, feeble and helpless 
so far as possible. 

I hope to see the day when these ten 
thousand non-tithepayers will add their 
mite to the tithes and offerings of the 
Church, in order that there may be 
more substance in the storehouse of 
God with which to meet the necessities 
of the work, and give the servants of 
the Lord an opportunity to do far more 
good than they have means to do with 
today. If these ten thousand do not do 
it, I say to you that they will 
not share in the blessings of the 
day of the Lord, and when the burning 
comes they will get scorched. A pas- 
sage of Scripture comes to my mind, 
and I will read it to you. The same 
thing in substance is in the Bible: but 
the words I shall read are to be found 
in the Book of Mormon. They are the 
words of Christ Himself; therefore they 
are true, for His word is truth. There 
is power in His word, especially to 
those who obey it. When the Lord 
visited this continent, after His res- 
urrection from the dead, He gave in- 
struction after this manner: 

"Therefore, if ye do these things, bless- 
ed are ye, for ye shall be lifted up at 
the last day. 

"Write the things which ye have 
seen and heard, save it be those which 
are forbidden; 

"Write the works of this people, 
which shall be, even as hath been writ- 
ten, of that which hath been; 

"For behold, out of the books which 
have been written, and which shall be 
written, shall this people be judged, for 
by them shall their works be known 
unto men. 

"And behold, all things are written, 
by the Father; therefore out of th.> 
books which shall be written, shall the 
world be judged. 

"And know ye that ye shall be judges 
of this people, according to the judg- 



72 



GENERAL, CONFERENCE 



ment which I shall give unto you, which 
shall be just; therefore what manner 
of men had ye ought to be? Verily I 
say unto you, even as I am." 

These are the words of Jesus Christ. 
Out of the things which have been writ- 
ten in the books, this people shall be 
judged, according to their works. The 
Lord shall make a record also, and out 
of that shall the whole world be judged. 
And you men of the holy Priesthood— 
you Apostles, Presidents, Bishops and 
High Priests in Zion— will be called 
upon to be the judges of the people. 
Therefore, it is expected that you shall 
set the standard for them to attain to, 
and see that they shall live according 
to the spirit of the Gospel, do their 
duty, and keep the commandments of 
the Lord. You shall make a record of 
their acts. You shall record when 
they are baptized, when they are con- 
firmed, and when they receive the 
Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands. 
You shall record, when they come to 
Zion, their membership in the Church. 
You shall record whether they attend 
to their duties as Priests, Teachers, 
or Deacons, as Elders, Seventies, or 
High Priests. You shall write their 
-works, as the Lord says here. You shall 
record their tithings, and give them 
credit for that which they do; and the 
Lord will determine the difference be- 
tween the credit which they make for 
themselves and the credit which they 
should make. The Lord will judge be- 
tween us in that respect; but we shall 
judge the people, first requiring them 
to do their duty. In order to do that, 
those who stand at the head must set 
the example. They must walk in the 
right path, and invite the people, to 
follow them. They should not seek to 
drive the people; they should not seek 
to become rulers; but they should be 
brethren arid leaders of the people. 

It is a strange tl^ng to me that some 
people do not or will not see the truth. 
This brings to my mind another pas- 
sage of scripture. I will take the lib- 
erty of reading a few more words from 
the Book of Mormon; 

"O that cunning plan of the evil one! 
O the vainness, and the frailties, and 
the foolishness of men! When the> 
are learned, they think they are wise, 
and they hearken not unto the coun- 
sel of God, for they set it aside, sup- 



posing they know of themselves; 
wherefore, their wisdom is foolishness, 
and it profiteth them not. And they 
shall perish." 

Here is a reason why many people 
do not and will not allow themselves to 
see the truth. They depend upon their 
own knol wedge and wisdom; therefore 
they set aside the things of God, and 
lift themselves up in the pride of their 
own hearts. But the Lord hath said, 
they shall perish; and I will not con- 
tradict it. The Prophet continues; 

"But to be learned is good, if they 
hearken unto the counsels of God." 

There is the difficulty. If you can 
get learned men that will hearken un- 
to the counsels of God, they are all 
right; but if they will not hearken unto 
the counsels of God, their learning is 
foolishness in the sight of the Lord; 
and with all their learning and cunning 
they will perish. 

"But wo unto the rich, who are rich 
as to the things of the world. For be- 
cause they are rich, they despise the 
poor, and they persecute the meek, and 
their hearts are upon their treasures; 
wherefore their treasure is their god. 
And behold, their treasure shall perish 
with them also." 

Here follows a key: 

"And wo unto the deaf, that will not 
hear; for they shall perish. 

"Wo unto the blind, that will not see; 
for they shall perish also. 

We pity the blind who cannot see; 
God will extend mercy and forgiveness 
to them; but wo unto the blind who 
WILL not see! 

"Wo unto the uncircumcised of heart; 
for a knowledge of their iniquities shall 
smite them at the last day. 

"Wo unto the liar; for he shall be 
thrust down to hell. 

"Wo unto the murderer, who deliber- 
ately killeth; for he shall die. 

"Wo unto them who commit whore- 
doms; for they shall be thrust down to 
hell. I 

"Yea, wo unto those that worship 
idols; for the devil of all devils delight- 
eth in them. 

"And, in fine, wo unto all those who 
die in their sins; for they shall return 
toi God, and behold his face, and remain 
in their sins." 

My brethren and sisters, I desire to 
bear my testimony to you; for I have 
received an assurance which has taken 
possession of my whole being. It has 
sunk deep into my heart: it fills every 
fibre of my soul; so that I feel to say 



PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH.

before this people, and would be pleased 
to have the privilege of saying it before 
the whole world, that God has revealed 
unto me that Jesus is the Christ, the 
Son of the living God, the Redeemer of 
the world; that Joseph Smith, is, was, 
and always will be a prophet of God, 
ordained and chosen to stand at the 
head of the dispensation of the fulness 
of times, the keys of which were given 
to him, and he will hold them until the 
winding-up scene — keys which will un- 
lock the door into the kingdom of God 
to every man who is worthy to enter, 
and which will close that door against 
every soul that will not obey the law of 
God. I know, as I live, that this is true, 
and I bear my testimony to its 
truth. If it were the last words 
I should ever say on earth, I 
would glory before God my Father that 
I possess this knowledge in my soul, 
which I declare unto you as I would 
the simplest truths of heaven. I know 
that this is the kingdom of God, and 
that God is at the helm. He presides 
over His people. He presides over the 
President of this Church, and has done 
from the Prophet Joseph down to the 
Prophet Lorenzo; and He will continue 
to preside over the leaders of this 
Church until the winding-up scene. He 
will not suffer it to be given to another 
people, nor to be left to men. He will 
hold the reins in His own hands; for 
He has stretched out His arm to do His 
work, and He will do it, and have the 
honor of it. At the same time God will 
honor and magnify His servants in the 
sight of the people. He will sustain 
them in righteousness; He will lift them 
on high, exalt them into His presence, 
and they will partake of His glory for- 
ever and ever. It is the Lord's work, 
and I plead with you not to forget it. 
I implore you not to disbelieve it; for 
it is true. All that the Lord has said 
concerning this latter-day work will 
come to pass. The world cannot pre- 
vent it. The blind that will not see, 
the deaf that will not hear, cannot pre- 
vent the work from going on. They 
may throw blocks before the wheels, 
they may ridicule, they may malign, 
they may stir up the spirit of persecu- 
tion and bitterness against the Saints, 
they may do all in their power to de- 
ceive the people and lead them astray; 



but God is at the helm, and He will 
lead His people to victory. Men and 
women may be deceived by the crafti- 
ness of the adversary and by the spirit 
of darkness that is in the world; they 
may be deceived with Christian Science, 
with hypnotism, with animal magnet- 
ism, with mesmerism, with spiritualism, 
and with all the other man-made and 
demon-stimulated isms which exist in 
the world; but the elect of God shall 
see and know the truth. They will not 
be blind, because they will see; they 
will not be deaf, because they will hear; 
and they will walk in the light, as God 
is in the light, that they may 
have fellowship with Jesus Christ, and 
that His blood may cleanse them 
from all their sins. May God help us to 
do this. May He deliver us from se- 
cret combinations, and from the snares 
that are set to entrap our feet and to 
win our affections from the kingdom of 
God. I repeat what I have said scores 
of times, the Kingdom of God is good 
enough for me. This organization of the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints meets all my wants, and I have 
no need to fly to organizations that are 
gotten up by men for the purpose of 
making money. I pray God that His 
kingdom may be sufficient for you, that 
you may abide in the truth, and not 
be led away by these deceptive spirits 
that have gone forth in the world to 
lead men astray. Spiritualism started 
in the United States about the time that 
Joseph Smith received his visions from 
the heavens. What more natural than 
that Lucifer should begin revealing 
himself to men in his cunning way, in 
order to deceive them and to distract 
their minds from the truth that God 
was revealing? And he has kept it up 
pretty well ever since. May God bless 
Israel, and preserve us in the truth. 
May He bless our President, prolong his 
years, and continue unto him the 
strength of body and mind that he pos- 
sesses this day, and even more vigor as 
the years roll on. May the Lord have 
mercy upon our beloved brother, Presi- 
dent Cannon, who is absent from us, 
and return him once more to his home 
and to the bosom of the Church, if He 
has not willed otherwise. This is my 
humble prayer, in the name of Jesus. 
Amen.

The choir sang, "Welcome, Welcome, 
Sabbath Morning." 

ASSISTANT GENERAL SUPERIN- 
TENDENT GEORGE REYNOLDS. 

The sickness of our beloved Superin- 
tendent, and the death of our First As- 
sistant, Dr. Karl G. Maeser, leaves it 
with me to welcome you this evening. 
I am gratified to see so many present, 
and trust that all will endeavor to be- 
come instructed and edified by what 
they may hear and see this evening. 
We have come here as representatives 
and students of the great Sunday 
School cause, a cause which Brother 
Goddard often used to remind us was 
the largest of all the auxilliary organi- 
zations in the midst of God's people in 
these latter days. And we are still 
growing, though I regret to say, (owing 
perhaps more than anything else to the 
prevailing epidemics), our increase dur- 
ing the last year has not been as large 
proportionately as in some former 
years. This I trust will receive the 
consideration of our brethren who 
locally preside in our Sunday Schools, 
that none of the children in our midst 



who should be at Sunday School may be" 
absent, but that they be looked after. 
We want them all, we are working for 
them all. We desire to have them all 
come within the influence of our 
schools. In comparing the statistics 
found in the Church reports, showing 
the total number of souls in the various 
Stakes of Zion and then comparing 
these numbers with the average 
attendance at the Sunday Schools 
each Sabbath morning, we discover 
that in quite a number of the Stakes 
more than one-third of the entire popu- 
lation is to be found in the Sunday 
School each Sabbath morning, and in 
the great majority of the stakes be- 
tween one-third and one-fourth. Only 
in one Stake is less than one-fifth to be 
found. This speaks well for our prog- 
ress and I think that as in several 
Stakes more than one-third of the en- 
tire number of the people of God, grown 
up and children, manage to be in at- 
tendance each Sunday, that this should 
be an incentive to others that as large 
a proportion may be found in all. 

PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 

My brethren and sisters, speaking in 
reference to our beloved general super- 
intendent, President George Q. Cannon. 
I am happy to inform you that I re- 
ceived a telephone message from the 
President's office a short time ago, stat- 
ing that President Snow had received a 
telegraphic message in which it was 
stated that those in attendance upon 
Brother Cannon think that his condi- 
tion this afternoon has somewhat im- 
proved, and we feel very grateful fc«r 
this good news. 

ELDER SEYMOUR B. YOUNG. 

My beloved brethren and sisters, and 
young people of the Sunday schools, my 
remarks as already announced will per- 
tain more particularly and especially to 
Dr. Karl G. Maeser, our late first as- 



7tj 



DESEEET SUNDAY SCHOOL UNION 



sistant superintendent of Sunday 
Schools. Dr. Maeser was born, as many 
of you are aware, in Saxony, Germany, 
on January 16, 1828, and died in this 
city on the morning of February 15, 
1901. He emigrated to Utah in the 
early sixties, and became acquainted 
with the Prophet Brigham Young soon 
after his arrival in Salt Lake City. 
President Brigham Young had in his 
• heart and mind for a number of years 
the starting of an educational institu- 
tion that would be a lasting benefit to 
the Latter-day Saints, and he chose the 
city of Provo as the place at which this 
institution should be located, and se- 
lected Elder Karl G. Maeser, 
to be the chief instructor. While in 
Salt Lake City it is said that Brother 
Maeser's circumstances were very poor, 
and the following story is told illus- 
trating his condition. One afternoon he 
was invited by a family whose children 
were attending the school taught by 
Brother Maeser, to dine with them. 
When Brother Maeser had partaken of 
the good things set before him. he said 
to the good sister of the hous?. "Sis- 
ter So and So, I was very hungry when 
I came here, but I have eaten of the 
good thing's of your table till I am sat- 
isfied, but my family at home are hun- 
gry too, and I would like very much 
to have your consent to take some of 
the choice viands from the table and 
carry them home to my wife and child- 
ren." And the request I need not say. 
was gladly granted. Brother Maeser 
went home glad in his heart that he 
could share the feast of that afternoon 
with his own familv. I recite this to 
you, my brethren and sisters, to show 
you the humility of the man. and 
wherever he hps been known since that 
day, whether in good circumstances or 
in poverty, it has made no difference 
to him, his life record has gone on all 
the same. He has been the same devot- 
ed, earnest worker in the cause that he 
loved so well, namely, the teaching of 
the children of Zion. Finally, President 
Young established him in the institu- 
tion at Provo, as I have before men- 
tioned. While he was engaged in teach- 
ing, in the early years of that institu- 
tion, in the old brick building that was 
formerly the property of Brother Lewis, 
and was at one time used as a 



storehouse, I was witness to a cir- 
cumstance that I have never for- 
gotten, and that I would 1 like to 
repeat. In the recitation room, a 
class was reciting under one of the in- 
structors whom Brother Maeser had 
chosen from his monitors to instruct 
the class in elocution. In the instruc- 
tions they were reading the poem that 
is termed "The Epaminondas of Mod- 
ern Greece," and in that poem there are 
lines something like this: 

"Strike, till the last armed foe expires, 
Strike, for your altars and your flres, 
Strike, for the green graves of your 
sires, 

God, and your native land." 

The young man who was teaching the 
class was doing it with but very little 
spirit; in a lackadaisical sort of way he 
was saying to the class — 

"Strike, till the last armed foe expires, 
Strike, 

Brother Maeser listened a moment, 
sprang from his seat at the other end 
of the room, rushed across to the class 
and, snatchinp- the book from the 
"oung man, said: "This will never do. 
You must get some spirit in your les- 
sons or you will never succeed. When 
you read this," he said, " you must 
not say— "S t r i k e," you must say 
"S T R I K E." The result was, the 
entire school w r as electrified, and every- 
one from that moment drank into the 
spirit of their leader. 

It was said he was approached many 
times in the early days of the Brig- 
ham Young Academy, with of- 
fers of a larger salary if he 
would remove from Utah to the 
Eastern States, where he could have 
a greater and wider field for his labors 
with better pay, for his fame began to 
go abroad, and people commenced 
to learn, of his worth as a teacher and 
an instructor among the young. But 
Brother Maeser's invariable reply was, 
like that of Dr. Agassiz. Said he: "I 
have no time to devote to making 
money, and no time to waste upon that 
thought." He remained faithful and 
true to the institution that he was en- 
gaged, to instruct and to be a father to 
by President Brigham Young, and he 
made it a grand success by his per- 
sonality, bringing it to be one of the 
leading institutions of this great West, 
stamping upon it a name and a fame

that shall never die, and bringing into 
culture the minds of thousands of 
young Latter-day Saints who will re- 
member Karl G. Maeser while life, and 
thought, and being last, or immortality 
endures. Brother Maeser was faithful 
to his trust. He was true in every- 
thing committed to his hand; he was 
a father to the children that he taught, 
he was one of the leaders in the Sun- 
day School and the religion class causes, 
and his constant teachings and example 
will be long remembered by the youth 
of Zion. Of Karl G. Maeser it may be 
truly said, 

"We tell of his death without a sigh, 
For he is freedom's now and fame's; 
One of the few immortal names, 

That were not born to die." 

The General Secretary, Elder Horace 
S. Ensign, then called the roll of Stakes; 
read the annual report for the year end- 
ing December 31st, 1900; and then pre- 
sented the Sunday School authorities, 
which were unanimously sustained. 

Elder George Reynolds, as Treasurer, 
reported the amount of nickel fund re- 
cenved for 1900. 

The Salt Lake Stake Sunday school 
choir then sang "The Holy City." 

ELDER JOSEPH M. TANNER. 
As all our Sabbath school workers are 
aware, we have already held our sec- 
ond Sunday school convention. Both 
conventions were held in the Assembly 
Hall in this city. The second indicated 
an increase in numbers over the first, 
and in both instances a program had 
been carefully arranged so that instruc- 
tion and inspiration were afforded to all 
those who took part. The second con- 
vention, of which I am to speak tonight, 
clearly indicated the wisdom of these 
gatherings, and the minutes of that 
convention, as published in the Juvenile 
Instructor, give you some idea of the 
character of the instructions, even 
though you may not feel or sense the 
spirit of the gathering. I have no doubt 
that those who were present at this 
convention were the foremost workers 
in the Sunday school cause. The spirit 
of the occasion was marked and the in- 
fluence upon the Sunday school work 
has been very strong, and I take it 
that we all feel that the Sunday school 
convention has now become, in a man- 



ner, a permanent part of the organiza- 
tion of this department of the Lord's 
vineyard. 

I could not this evening more than 
mention the great number of topics that 
were discussed. Some of these topics, 
however, are of far reaching conse- 
quence to our schools, and one or two 
may be called to the attention of the 
Sabbath school workers tonight with 
the thought that their importance may 
be emphasized in your future labors. 
The Union Board had had for some 
time under discussion the text books 
to be used In our schools, and after due 
deliberation, under the guidance of 
President Cannon, it was decided that 
the Bible, the Book of Mormon, the 
Doctrine and Covenants, and the Pearl 
of Great Price should be our text books 
in the Sabbath schools. President Can- 
non himself spoke at some length upon 
this subject, and answered questions 
that were propounded by those present. 
And this calls to our mind at this time, 
especially those of us who have been- 
engaged for some years in the Sunday 
school work, something of a change that 
has come over us. You will many of 
you remember that in earlier times it 
was the custom to memorize a great 
many passages from the Scriptures. 
We issued tickets with verses from 
the Bible upon them, and these 
tickets were collected by the students, 
who memorized the passages and kept 
until a certain number was received, 
and then a prize was given therefor. It 
may be true that in those days we went 
to extremes in the way of memorizing. 
Now in our efforts to teach the word of 
the Lord we perhaps overlook the 
spirit, and we gradually begin to draw 
away from the language of the scrip- 
tures and give our instructions in our 
own language, any language which we 
believe will be most suitable to the un- 
derstanding of the children, until now 
we have ceased almost wholly to mem- 
orize important passages of holy writ: 
and I suspect that we have gone al- 
ready too far in the other direction. We 
are too greatly substituting or have 
been substituting explanations of the 
scriptures for the scriptures them- 
selves; and one idea that the brethren 
have is that the children and also the 
older members in the theological class 



78 



DESERET SUNDAY SCHOOL UNION 



should drink from the fountain head of 
inspiration as it comes to us direct 
from holy writ, and not depart entire- 
ly from the original text for the infor- 
mation which we desire to impart to 
the children. And we take it that it is 
-desirable that our children should 
learn to memorize important passages; 
such that will leave a strong impres- 
sion upon their lives; scriptural pas- 
sages that they will use as their guid- 
ing star; scriptural passages that will 
help to form convictions in their minds 
of right and wrong; scriptural passages 
that will bring conviction to their 
hearts. In view of the fact that we 
could not hear the voice of Christ and 
His disciples, we may read their words 
measurably as they uttered them, in so 
far as they have been translated for 
us correctly, and I trust, therefore, my 
brethren and sisters, that in our Sun- 
day schools we will in the future place 
more importance upon this branch of 
the work, which it is believed for some 
time has been in some measure neg- 
lected. We are likely to go to extremes, 
either one way or the other, and this 
the convention had in view in the dis- 
cussion of the best methods of instruc- 
tion, and the best means of presenting 
the subjects to our children. But we 
have also kept in mind, what is an im- 
portant matter, something that may be 
repeated again and again, that it is the 
mission of the Sabbath school to teach 
the children how to feel as well as how 
to think. If we can fill their minds 
with pure thoughts, and their hearts 
with pure feelings, we are sure that 
they will have a more certain guidance 
in their lives than they could other- 
wise have. In concluding, I desire to 
commend to all the Sabbath schools 
everywhere the importance in the fu- 
ture of attending these conventions. 
Bring with you the spirit of your work, 
ask those questions that convey the 
ideas upon which you desire more light 
and help, in order that the Sabbath 
School may grow in numbers, grow in 
the strength of its spirit until it shall 
be the glory of Zion, for I know of no 
work that is more pleasant and satis- 
factory than to labor among the chil- 
dren. I know that it is of God. I re- 
joice that such an organization is in 
the midst of Israel, with its high, ele- 



vated and inspiring aims; and may God 
grant us His blessings in our labors 
of love is my prayer in the name of 
Jesus Christ. Amen. 

Apostle Heber J. Grant sang "O My 
Father." 

ELDER HORACE S. ENSIGN. 

My dear brethren and sisters, I as- 
sure you that it is with a feeling of 
much timidity that I stand before you 
this evening, and I trust that for the 
few moments that I may stand here 
that I may have your attention, and 
that I may be blessed with the Spirit of 
God. I am truly thankful that I live 
in this day and age, when God has es- 
tablished His Church and Kingdom up- 
on the earth, and His Sunday schools 
have been organized, whereby the youth 
of Zion may be taught the principles ot 
the Gospel, that they may grow up in a 
knowledge of the truth; that they may 
gain a knowledge of God and Jesus 
Christ whom He sent. I am thankful 
that I am associated with the Sunday 
schools and I regret that my labors will 
soon terminate, at least here at home, 
amongst them. Not that I regret that 
I have been called upon another mis- 
sion, for I assure you that I consider 
that I have been honored among men 
to feel and to know that I have the 
esteem, the love, and the confidence of 
one of the true witnesses of Jesus 
Christ, even one of our Apostles, and 
that he is desirous of taking me into 
the nations of the earth to assist him in 
preaching the Gospel unto those who 
lie in darkness. I am not going into the 
world without a testimony of the Gos- 
pel, and I am not going into the land of 
the Mikado without realizing that a 
great responsibility is resting upon 
those who have been called to open 
up the Gospel in that land. The Gospel 
has never been preached to those peo- 
ple, and I doubt if they have ever 
heard anything about it except a few 
who may have been in the United 
States. I realize that we will have to 
teach the people of this land that Jesus 
is the Christ, and that God is His 
Father. We will also have to teach 
them to believe in the Holy Scriptures. 
I trust, my brethren and sisters, that 
while we sojourn in that land that we 
may be blessed with an interest in your 



DESERET SUNDAY SCHOOL UNION 



faith and prayers, for I assure you that 
I feel humble, I feel weak, and I have 
no other desire in my heart than to 
do all the good I can, and I know that 
without an interest in your faith and 
prayers that it will be impossible for me 
to be of service to God in the land 
where I have been sent, and where I 
expect to go. I assure you that I shall 
always remember my experience and 
my labors in the Sabbath schools, and I 
only hope that it may be my privilege 
to take up my labors again in this ca- 
pacity when I return, for I realize that 
the Sunday School is the soil where the 
Gospel seed is first planted, where it is 
nourished, and where we And it natural- 
ly reaches its maturity. My brethren 
and sisters, I desire to bear my testi- 
mony unto you, tonight, that I know 
that this is the Gospel of Jesus Christ, 
I know that it is true, and I know that 
if I am steadfast and serve God and 
keep His commandments that I shall be 
saved and exalted in His kingdom. It 
is not because I have seen the sick 
healed, because I have seen devils cast 
out, or that I have been inspired of Al- 
mighty God that I know this, it is be- 
cause that still small voice says unto 
me, "Elder Ensign, this is truth, this 
is the straight and narrow way, walk 
ye in it, and ye will be saved and ex- 
alted in the kingdom of God." May 
we all be saved is my prayer, and I 
ask it in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

APOSTLE HEBER J. GRANT. 

I have been appointed tonight to 
speak upon the subject , of the purchase 
of the Juvenile Instructor, and also up- 
on the plan for its payment. The fol- 
lowing circular with regard to the pur- 
chase of the Juvenile will be sent to 
each ward Sunday School Superintend- 
ent in all the Stakes of Zion: 

THE PURCHASE OF THE JUVE- 
NILE INSTRUCTOR. 

Salt Lake City, Utah, April 10, 1901. 

Superintendency of Ward 

Sunday School, 

Stake. 

Dear Brethren: — You are doubtless 
aware that at a special meeting of the 



General Sunday School Union Board, 
Stake Superintendents and Sunday 
School officers, held in Salt Lake City, 
October 5th, 1900, the purchase of the 
"Juvenile Instructor" from President 
George y. Cannon by the Deseret Sun- 
day School Union was favorably enter- 
tained and a committee of three was 
appointed to consummate negotiations 
to that end. This was accomplished and 
on January 1st, 1901, the ownership of 
the "Juvenile Instructor," held by Pres- 
ident Cannon for thirty-five years, 
passed, for a consideration of five thou- 
sand dollars to the Deseret Sunday 
School Union. By giving our note 
bearing 6 per cent interest for that 
amount, the money was obtained and 
the transaction was closed. 

The extended growth of the Union 
made it very desirable that it should 
have an organ of its own, and it seemed 
eminently fitting that the "Juvenile In- 
structor," so long and favorably known 
in the community, and so great a fac- 
tor in the development of the Sunday 
School work of the Church, should be 
that organ, hence the purchase. To 
meet the obligations thus incurred, and 
end the outlay for interest thereon, it 
has been decided by the Deseret Sunday 
School Union Board, which recommen- 
dation was accepted by the vote of the 
General Conference of the Sunday 
Schools held in Salt Lake City, April 
7th, 1901, to ask each Sunday School to 
contribute on Sunday, April 28th, 1901, 
or as soon after that date as practica- 
ble, an amount equal to not less than 
five cents each for every officer, teacher 
and pupil enrolled on the school record 
December 31st, 1900. To facilitate this 
collection we herewith enclose suitable 
prepared blanks, suggesting that the 
Secretary enter on the list printed in 
red ink the names of every officer and 
teacher on the school roll and on the 
others the names of every pupil in the 
several departments; then place or have 
placed opposite the names of all who 
donate the amount of their subscription. 
While no contribution of more than 
five cents is asked from any one per- 
son, yet if any, out of the kindness of 
their hearts, feel to give more it should 
not be declined. If the total collected 
be equal to five cents each for the en- 
tire enrollment, or a little in excess 
thereof, it will be ample. When the 
contributions have been received send 
the funds promptly by check or money 
order in the enclosed envelope, prop- 
erly stamped, together with the lists, 
to Elder George Reynolds, Box B, Salt 
Lake City, Utah. The lists when re- 
turned to us will be preserved, thus 
affording the first entire roll of our 
Sunday schools ever collected. The 
name of the school and Stake, with 
amount subscribed, will at an early 
date be published in the "Juvenile In- 
structor." Trusting this step may com- 
mend itself to your hearty approval and 



80

effort, and that of those over whom 
you preside, we remain. 

Your Brethren, 
THE DESERET SUNDAY SCHOOL 
UNION BOARD. 

GEORGE Q. CANNON, 

General Superintendent. 
HORACE S. ENSIGN, 
Secretary. 

It is proposed, That we as the 
Deseret Sunday School Union, in con- 
ference assembled, sustain the recom- 
mendation made by the Deseret Sun- 
day School Union Board, that on Sun- 
day, April 28th, 1901, or as soon after 
that date as possible, each and every 
school in the Union, embraced in our 
Stake organizations, do collect an 
amount equal to at least 5 cents for 
every member enrolled therein, as per 
the report of their total enrollment De- 
cember 31st, 1900. The funds thus col- 
lected to be applied in the payment of 
the purchase price of the "Juvenile In- 
structor," and that we will use our best 
endeavors to that end. 

All in favor of endorsing this motion, 
and this circular letter, as per the un- 
derstanding in our convention, will 
make it manifest by showing the right 
hand. (The vote was unanimous). 

I wish to say that I myself will take 
pride in contributing my nickel, and I 
shall try to contribute more than one 
nickel, at least two, and perhaps sev- 
eral hundred of them. I believe that 
the "Juvenile" will be of very great 
value, in fact I not only believe it, but 
I know that it will be. I think that we, 
as parents, should have that magazine 
in our homes, and that we should give 
it our unqualified support and encour- 
age our children in reading the very 
good articles that are in it. I look back 
to my boyhood days and remember 
reading many things in the "Juvenile" 
that made a lasting impression on my 
mind for good. The Deseret Sunday 
School Union Board are not publishing 
this magazine for any personal advan- 
tage. They are simply publishing it to 
benefit your children and mine, and I 
urge upon the Latter-day Saints, one 
and all, to be liberal in their subscrip- 
tions, and to see that this most valu- 
able magazine is in their homes, be- 
cause it is worth to the Latter-day 
Saints many times more than the pal- 
try price of the magazine to have in- 



stilled into the hearts and minds of 
their children the noble teachings that 
are to be found therein. Now I find 
that I am down on the program in ad- 
dition to these remarks on the "Juve- 
nile," to give a valedictory. 

Inasmuch as you are all aware that 
I am about to leave upon a mission, I 
will say in bidding goodbye to the 
Sunday school workers, that some of 
the happiest times in my life have been 
spent in laboring in the Sunday school 
cause since I was called a few years 
ago, in connection with Apostle Ly- 
man, to occupy a position on the board 
of the Sunday School Union. I do not 
believe that I have ever been associ- 
ated with a more patriotic, a more 
loyal, and a more faithful body of men 
than those to be found upon this Sun- 
day School Union board. We meet reg- 
ularly once a week whenever we are not 
engaged in some other Church duties or 
responsibilities, and report our labors 
and converse and plan together for the 
advancement of the Sunday school 
cause, and there is always a very nice, 
a very enjoyable and a very sweet 
spirit in our meetings. I have en- 
joyed all of those meetings, and I have 
enjoyed my labors in the Sunday school, 
although on account of my duties in 
connection with the Young Men's Mu- 
tual Improvement associations I have 
not had as great an opportunity to la- 
bor among the Sunday schools r I 
would like to have had. I was inti- 
mately associated from my boyhood 
days with Brother George Goddard, 
and I loved him with all my heart. I 
was associated in the Sunday school 
work with Brother Maeser. and I 
learned to love him, and I say to the 
young men and to the young ladies 
within the sound of my voice, that the 
lives of these two noble men that have 
passed away from us w r ithin the past 
two years, that their lives, their labors, 
are worthy of our emulation, that they 
are bright and shining lights, that the 
testimony of their labors is beyond any 
words that I might utter. In going 
forth to proclaim the Gospel of Jesus 
Christ, the plan of life and salvation, I 
go with joy; I go with gratitude to God 
that I have been considered worthy to 
be sent to open the doors of the Gos- 
pel to a nation that has never heard the 



DESERET SUNDAY SCHOOL UNION 



81 



sound of the tidings of great joy. I go 
to bear my testimony that I know that 
God lives, that Jesus is the Christ, that 
I know that Joseph Smith was a 
Prophet of the true and living God. I 
go forth with this testimony in my 
heart. I go forth rejoicing, thanking 
God that my life has been spared, that 
I am permitted to go. It is only a 
little over two years ago that I was 
very heavily involved, and it looked as 
though it would take not one year, not 
five, not ten, not twenty years of my 
life, but even more, to extricate my- 
self from the bondage of debt. I was 
lying in the hospital at the point of 
death, and God saw fit to raise me up, 
and while I was there, I told Him that 
if He would assist me in paying my 
obligations, that I would gladly go to 
the ends of the earth and proclaim the 
Gospel, and I desired His aid that I 
might go as a free man, and I testify to 
you that God has blessed me beyond 
my most sanguine expectations; that 
He has multiplied my substance in my 
hands, and I can go upon this mission 
practically a free man. And I testi- 
fy that I know that God lives, that 
Jesus is the Christ, that Joseph Smith 
was a Prophet of God, that Lorenzo 
Snow is one. I leave my blessing upon 
the Latter-day Saints and upon the 
Sunday school cause, and I ask for your 
blessing to attend me and Brother 
Kelsch and Brother Ensign and others 
that we may choose to labor with us, 
and I say, may God bless you again, 
in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

Elder George D. Pyper sang, "The 
Children's Friend." 

APOSTLE P. M. LYMAN. 

I presume that there is no more in- 
spiring sight to be found in the world 
in connection with Sunday school work 
than we have before us tonight. I 
wonder if there is any spot on earth 
where there is anything in this line to 
compare with what we see tonight.and 
such as we see twice a year. It be- 
comes quite common to us, such a gath- 
ering of children as we have here to 
make music, and the choice singing by 
others. I have been wondering what 
percentage of the congregation present 
are not really workers and interested 
in the Sunday schools. I notice that 



our Sunday schools have the presence- 
of our leaders — the members of the- 
Presidency of the Church and the chief 
men in the Stakes of Zion; and in the- 
wards the presiding authorities are al- 
ways attentive and give encourage- 
ment to this cause. It embraces al- 
most every department of the Church; 
men and women, old and young, middle- 
aged, all are interested in this great 
and important cause, and no one can be- 
too thoroughly devoted to it, for it is; 
particularly and entirely devoted to the 
salvation of the souls of the children,, 
and if we can save the children, there 
will be no trouble with the older peo- 
ple, for if the children he saved the old: 
people cannot help but be saved after 
a while. And the impressions that are 
made upon them in the Sunday schools: 
will never be forgotten. Listening to- 
Dr. Tanner urging us to commit to 
memory passages of scripture, I do not 
think that we can give too much 
thought to this splendid suggestion. It . 
is not new, it is rather in the ancient 
line, for we have no doubt among us -. 
today many of the older people of the 
Church who were trained in Sunday 
schools in early times when almost the 
entire work was devoted to committing 
to memory scripture passages, scripture 
chapters, and almost all have some of 
the books of the scripture, and I be- 
lieve that we have drifted, as the doc- 
tor says, in the other direction, and 
that we should return and give greater 
attention to memorizing scripture 
passages. This evening I was; ; 
thinking as we were about to., 
come to this gathering, that 
Brother George Goddard has passed : 
away. Brother Maeser has passed away. 
These two great assistants to the gen- 
eral superintendent have passed away,, 
and tonight our hearts are sad with the* 
fact that the general superintendent - 
himself is in a precarious condition, and " 
I want to suggest to these Sunday 
school workers that we exercise in be- 
half of our general superintendent, 
President George Q. Cannon, all the 
faith that we can muster, and that we 
do not lie down tonight until we have 
in humility and in faith asked the Lore? 
that his life may be preserved to us and 
to His Church. I ask it as a favor of 
this body of Sunday school workers,

these seven or eight thousand people 
that are here. Brother Reynolds re- 
mains with us here, the others are away 
from us, two of them permanently and 
President Cannon unable to be with us. 
I have known these men since I was a 
■child. President Cannon, seventy-four 
years old. I can remember well when 
lie was as modest and blushing as a 
maiden, although I am so much younger 
than he is, but I can remember when 
he was a young man, remember him 
■well. Brother Maeser, I learned to 
known him early in life and experi- 
ence here. Was connected with him 
in school matters. Brother Goddard I 
■can remember almost as long as I can 
remember anyone in these valleys. 
Elder George Reynolds, who is with us 
tonight, a little younger than I am, 
came to the ministry when I was a 
traveling Elder in the London confer- 
ence forty years ago, and we have 
traveled side by side from then till 
mow. Our integrity is known to each 
other. We know each others' hearts; 
and these men that I have spoken of are 
being succeeded and associated with by 
men of the same type. I thank the 
Lord that this splendid body of men, 
■who stand to the Sunday school cause 
as the Presidency and the Twelve stand 
to the Church of Christ, the leaders 
and chiefs, and as devoted and as 
■earnest and faithful in this cause as 
'the Presidency and the Apostles are in 
the Church, and just as sweet, and 
•clean, and devoted. This is my testi- 
mony in regard to these men. God 
bless the Sunday school cause. I de- 
light in it, I enjoy it; and as I have said 
before, I never received an appoint- 
ment in the Church that brought me 
greater pride, satisfaction and pleasure 
than to know that I could be associated 
'with this body of men, and in this cause 
iin the Church of Christ. That we may 
toe faithful and devoted, and accom- 
plish all the good that lies in our power 
for the salvation of the souls of the 
•children that the Lord has entrusted to 
us, I humbly ask in the name of Jesus. 
Amen. ■' ; j ;

PROF. EVAN STEPHENS. 
I will comfort you first of all by tell- 
ing you that I will not speak many 
aninutes. I would not dare to attempt 



to say what I have on my mind to say 
to you, for I know it would take at 
least ten minutes or more to do it, in 
fact I have most of it written down, 
and it was my intention to read it to 
you; but with my little restless family 
here behind me, who have been sitting 
here about two hours now. I will not 
attempt it. I want to say without 
meaning to offend or to find fault, that 
I am really sorry that I have brought 
them here this evening, for you have 
set them a very bad example in good 
order. I love them very much, and I 
am accustomed to them in their sweeter, 
nicer mood at our rehearsals, where we 
do not have any talking, or 
confusion. There was so much 
confusion during the first half hour of 
our meeting that it would be useless 
to impress upon the children's minds 
the necessity of keeping still in the 
Tabernacle, and I am sorry that I 
brought them here to get a bad example 
from you late comers. 

The matter that I desire to speak of 
is musical training for the Church 
members from childhood up; the result 
would be that when our boys go on 
missions they would not si'ng their first 
hymn when they arrive in the field, as 
hundreds of them do today, I am sorry 
to say. The training should be taken 
up and continued from childhood to 
boyhood, to manhood and womanhood, 
under the auspices of either the Sunday 
school or the Mutual Improvement asso- 
ciation. I will say more about it in a pa- 
per that I will write. Will you please look 
for it, read it, and see if it is not practi- 
cable. You do not need a Brother Ste- 
phens around in order to have a sing- 
ing class. Do not make this mistake. I 
will take this much time now to try 
and disabuse your minds of that idea 
for I have been told so many times — 
"O yes, if we had a Brother Stephens 
in our Stake we could do thus and so." 

That is all nonsense. Brother 
Ballantyne, a young man in Ogden, 
is doing just as good work as I 
am; Brother Christopherson, a young 
man of very little educational training, 
who has not graduated anywhere, ex- 
cept out of my choir and classes, is just 
making Sanpete ring with musical im- 
provement today. I mention this be- 
cause some time ago it was re-

ported that about the only ones who 
did singing there were a few sisters. 
Today Sanpete is wide awake in music- 
al matters through the efforts of Broth- 
er Christopherson, who is making a 
splendid success of it. Brother Bassett 
at Nephi is doing the same thing. I 
mention this so that jou will not think 
you have to wait until some young col- 
lege graduate comes to your Stake. Do 
not be stingey with the music teachers. 
Do not be like a sister I heard of, living 
within a few miles of Ogden. She had 
taken her children to the class and 
when she got to Ogden she learned 
that the teacher was going to have 
something for his work, so she said, 
"Rather than to pay anything for a 
teacher to teach them music, I will 
take them home again." Tou must not 
think a music teacher does not have to 
■eat or wear anything or wants to live 
on charity. It is a hard oc- 
cupation at best, and you should en- 
courage him. Look around and see 
If you do not have two or three young 
men in your Stake who are making a 
success of choirs in Sunday schools or 
■elsewhere; then have them take it upon 
a larger scale, and organize training 
classes. This is a training class that be r 
longs to the Salt Lake Stake. They pay 
a tuition fee of a dollar a year for their 
training. They get four concert tickets 
that they can sell at 25 cents each and 
get their dollar back, and that makes 
their tuition practically free, and still 
the teacher is paid for his work. If 
something of this kind is taken hold of, 
the education of your children will cost 
next to nothing, and the music teacher 
•can live. There ought not to be a child 
whose musical training is neglected in 
our community, for we are a com- 
munity that make practical use of 
music. I glory in Brother Grant's pluck 
in learning to sing, and especially be- 
cause he had no talent at all. I do 
not think it was a matter of laughter 
at all this evening to hear him. I 
have heard worse singing than that 
from professionals. There is one thing 
Brother Grant does that I wish the 
•community would pattern after, and 
that is, he means what he sings. He 
•does not sing a lot of senseless rub- 
bish that is not Mormonism, and lots 



of our singers do that today. Let us 
sing what we mean and no more; do 
not let us sing so much frivolous stuff. 
Let us banish from our ward entertain- 
ments all things that are ridiculous. Let 
us take up music in a serious way, or 
else our musical progress will become a 
farce. Let us do away with comic songs 
more and more, and do not let them be 
mixed up with sermons and prayers 
and hymns. Our programs would bring 
us into ridicule if they were published 
anywhere in the world. It is the place 
of the Sunday school to look after this 
as much as anything. I wish they 
would take hold of our musical prog- 
ress. I can assure you that I would be 
only too glad to write you an article 
every week, to help you to carry on 
this work. I cannot visit you, not at 
present; I have too large a musical 
family to attend to at home. I have 
said a great deal more than I intended, 
and I only hope that this work will be 
taken up in real earnest and in a prac- 
tical way, for I feel that we are going 
to be a musical people, a peoplt 
with a taste for music, and who in- 
tend to elevate that taste above that 
which is prevailing. If we are not care- 
ful we will be in the same position as a 
race of people today who are perhaps 
among the most musical on the earth, 
but who never rise to the higher ranks 
of music. I do not want our community 
to dwindle into mediocrity. When a tal- 
ent is developing itself we must take 
hold of it and guide it right, or else it 
will become a means of evil instead of 
good, in our midst. That is why I would 
like to see music under the auspices of 
the Sunday schools, because then I think 
it could be turned into account. I wish to 
do the unusual thing, and that is, to 
sing our first song over, for I do not 
believe anybody heard it before; I 
could hardly hear it myself for the 
noise of people coming in. I do not 
like anything to go to waste. 

The choir then sang "The Cause of 
Truth."

Ere long the resurrection clay 
Will spread its life and light abroad.

2 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Historic places in U .S., and reminis- 
cences concerning same. — Be true to 
the faith, and unite in defense and up- 
building of Zion. 

I feel very grateful this morning 
for the privilege I have of behold- 
ing the faces of my brethren and 
sisters assembled here at the open- 
ing of our Seventy-seventh Semi- 
annual Conference, and as on all 
past occasions when we have met 
in our conferences I sincerely hope 
that the spirit of peace, the love of 
truth, and the desire for good may 
be paramount in all that may be 
said or done during this conference. 
It is gratifying also to see the num- 
ber assembled at this first meeting. 
It shows an interest in our work 
and in the cause of Zion which 
speaks well for those who are pres- 
ent ; and I sincerely believe that the 
faith of the Latter-day Saints is in- 
creasing, together with their 
knowledge and their love for the 
truth, and the people are becoming 
more and more established in their 
convictions of the truth of the Gos- 
pel which has been restored in these 
latter days. 

Everything seems to point to the 
continued advancement of the cause 
of Zion. The earth has been blessed 
to a very great extent by the favor 
of the Lord during the last season, 
and the most of our people have 
reaped bountiful harvests and have 
been prospered not only spiritually 
but also temporally. I think we 
possess the evidence that the good 
works of the Latter-day Saints are 
not diminishing, but that they are 
indeed increasing and we — with 
but very few exceptions — are as de- 
termined today as we ever were, or 
as ever any members of the Church 
were, to continue to fight the good 
fight and keep the faith. 

I desire to express my feelings of 



welcome to the Latter-day Saints 
who are here today, and to those 
who shall attend this conference, 
and say to you, my brethren and 
sisters, that we love the truth and 
the work of the Lord today even 
more than ever before. We are not 
disheartened, we are not discour- 
aged, we are not fainthearted. We 
believe in the Lord, and we know 
that He is mighty to save that He 
has guided the destinies of this peo- 
ple from the first moment until the 
present, and that it is not in conse- 
quence of the wisdom of men that 
we have escaped the plots, schemes 
and machinations of our enemies, 
and that we have been permitted to 
live and grow in the land, to become 
what we are, but it is through the 
wisdom, mercy and blessing of Him 
who rules the destinies not only of 
men but of nations. We owe all 
to God ; we extend our thankfulness 
and gratitude to Him for the mani- 
festations of His love and care and 
protection. 

I was going to say that we did 
not owe anything to our enemies ; 
that was the first thought that 
sprang up in my mind, but I will 
'^old that back. I think we owe 
something to our enemies too for 
the advancement of the cause of 
Zion ; for up to date everything that 
.has been done or attempted to be 
done to thwart the purposes of God 
and to frustrate His designs has 
been overruled for the good of Zion 
and for the spread of truth. And 
that will continue to be the case un- 
til the end, for thej are fighting 
God's work, and not mine nor that 
of any man. 

Very recently, with the approval 
of some of my brethren who were 
present when the thought occurred 
to me — and it did not occur to me 
until just a few hours before I 



PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 



■A 



■came to the conclusion — I started 
with a friend to visit in the eastern 
-countries a little. The thought first 
..arose in my mind on Saturday 
•evening, and was matured, so far 
.as my determination to leave home 
for a little while was concerned, on 
the following day. I left home for 
;a rest — not that I expected to ob- 
tain physical rest, but a change 
sometimes is rest to men who are 
constantly engaged in duties that 
are strenuous and at times very 
burdensome. As it may be inter- 
esting to some of my brethren and 
sisters I would like to briefly out- 
line my visit. When we left here 
we first stopped at Omaha, and as I 
traveled the plains in the clays of 
my childhood, again in the days of 
my youth, with ox teams, mule 
teams and so forth. I concluded it 
would be interesting to make a 
visit to the old camp ground of Is- 
rael at Winter Quarters on the bank 
-of the Missouri river, which we did 
on the 24th of July, Pioneer day. 

We had the privilege of meeting 
"with some of the Elders engaged in 
the mission work there, and the 
few saints who are living about 
Omaha and vicinity, and had a 
royal good celebration of Pioneer 
day. We met under the old his- 
toric tree said to have been plant- 
ed by the hand of President Brig- 
ham Young, and which now is one 
of the largest trees in the vicinity, 
and there our friends spread their 
feast, which we partook of with 
them. We associated with them 
with great pleasure, answering in- 
quiries made of us. 

We next made a little halt at Chi- 
cago and had a very pleasant visit 
with some of our children who are 
going to school there, although our 
stay was very brief. We were not 
long in New York, as we reached 
ihere only a few hours before the 



sailing of the vessel. Our voyage 
across the Atlantic was never so 
pleasant before — not a ripple on the 
ocean nor anything to make the 
voyage more unpleasant than sail- 
ing upon a lake — a placid, calm sea. 

We landed in Antwerp on the 7th 
day of August, and from there vis- 
ited the city of Rotterdam, and the 
next day the city of Amsterdam, in 
Holland. In Amsterdam we at- 
tended a conference of Latter-day 
Saints, and found there a lively 
branch of the Church. We had the 
pleasure of meeting with the young 
men who have gone out from Zion 
to proclaim the Gospel to that peo- 
ple, and as some of their parents 
may be present here today, I desire 
to say to them that they have great 
reason to be proud of their boys. I 
do not think — speaking now of the 
meeting that we had with all the 
Elders in the missionary fields that 
we visited — I do not think there can 
be found in all the world a like 
number of equally noble, excellent- 
spirited young men, as are your 
boys who are at present out in the 
missionary field, and I think this 
can be said of them almost as a 
whole — extiremely few exceptions 
at the most. 

From Amsterdam we returned to 
Rotterdam and held another confer- 
ence with the Latter-day Saints, 
and some strangers and friends who 
were invited in, and who availed 
themselves of the opportunity. We 
had a most excellent time with them 
there. Here we found another 
flourishing branch of the Church, 
and the Elders, (all of them young 
men, active, energetic, faithful, vir- 
tuous and noble,) are doing all in 
their power by example as well as 
by precept, to spread the word of 
truth among that people. From 
here we visited G.ermany, stopping 
a few days at the city of Berlin.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Here again we met with the Lat- 
ter-day Saints and with the Elders, 
as many as could get together in 
that mission, and we had another 
very enjoyable time. Here we 
found some excellent conditions ex- 
isting, but some conditions that 
were not favorable, which I regret- 
ted to find. I will briefly say : 
Some of our young people who 
have gone to Berlin to study music 
or to follow other pursuits, by their 
negligence to perform their duties, 
by their neglect to go to the meet- 
ings of the Saints, by their holding 
themselves apart from the Latter- 
day Saints, they are not wielding a 
wholesome or good influence upon 
the people of that country. I want 
to tell you that, and I say it with 
regret. They make the excuse that 
they have to study and practice ev- 
ery day and when Sunday comes, 
if they do not have to continue their 
practice, they are so fatigued that 
they cannot go to meeting. Now if 
any of you have children in that 
condition I would advise you to 
stimulate them to do their whole 
duty and set a good example before 
the people of the world in this di- 
rection. T really think that the 
sending of our children to Berlin to 
study for years is considerably 
overdone, and I do not believe that 
as a rule very much good will ever 
accrue to our children who go 
there. 

From Berlin we went to Zurich 
in Switzerland and held a confer- 
ence. From there we went to Lu- 
cerne, and from there to Berne, 
where we again met with the Saints 
in conference and had a most ex- 
cellent and interesting visit, not 
only with our people in general, but 
with strangers who visited us. We 
also held meetings with the Elders, 
in some instances having as many 
as 50 or 75 present with us at one 



time. From there we returned to 
England, landing at Dover on the 
return, by way of Paris, France, 
where we remained a couple of 
days. In London we again met 
with our people in conference. We 
also met with many of the Elders of 
that mission, all of whom, so far as 
I could judge, seemed to be in ex- 
cellent spirits and faith, willing, 
ready and active in the perform- 
ance of their missionary labors. We 
had a good conference in London, 
and we afterwards had a most ex- 
cellent meeting with the Elders of 
the mission. From London we 
visited Scotland and attended con- 
ference in Edinburgh and Glasgow, 
where we also had an enjoyable 
time with the people and with the 
Elders of that portion of the British 
mission. Returning south from 
Scotland we called at Liverpool, 
and attended another conference of 
our people at Blackburn, in Lan- 
cashire, and also held a priesthood 
meeting there. Here we found the 
same conditions as far as our El- 
ders were concerned — a noble lot 
of young men, bright, intelligent, 
active, honorable, upright, clean, 
pure, and sweet as were ever found 
in anv part of the world. 

After a short visit at Liverpool 
we returned to London. We spent 
a few days visiting in that great city 
the places of interest. From there 
we returned to Dover and took 
steamer again for our native land. 

On reaching New York, the 18th 
of September, we made arrange- 
ments as hastily as possible and vis- 
ited Vermont, the birthplace of the 
Prophet Joseph Smith, and spent a 
couple of days there. We found 
that great improvement had been 
made under the direction of Broth- 
er Tunius F. Wells. The grounds 
have been laid off beautifully, the 
memorial cottage completed and

made ready for occupancy, and 
everything is looking beautiful and 
attractive there. Quite a large 
number of our neighbors who at- 
tended the dedication services on 
the 23rd of December last, hearing 
that I was there, did me the honor 
to call upon me and shake hands. 
They made us a very pleasant little 
visit. The burden of their conver- 
sation was : "Don't take Mr. Wells 
away from us." They want Mr. 
Wells to remain with them. 

From here we visited the historic 
Hill Cumorah, and the old home- 
stead of the Patriarch Joseph Smith 
and his. family. We also visited the 
grove where the first childhood 
prayer of the Prophet Joseph Smith 
was offered up, and where the first 
manifestations of the approval of 
Heaven were made to man in these 
latter days, with reference to the 
opening of the dispensation in 
which the fulness of the Gospel of 
Jesus should be restored to the 
world, and the authority of the 
Holy Priesthood again conferred 
upon man. To say that the visiting 
of such places as these does not in- 
spire serious thought and peculiar 
feelings, at least in' my breast, 
would not be true. 

There is something hallowed 
about those places, to me and to all, 
I think, who have accepted the di- 
vine mission of Joseph Smith, the 
Prophet, and who are imbued with 
the spirit of the Gospel that he was 
instrumental, in the hands of the 
Lord, in restoring to the earth. To 
me it is pleasing and inspiring to 
visit the haunts of that great and 
good* man, and his associates in the 
early days of the Church, and even 
before the Church was organized. 
We visited Palmyra, near the hill 
where the plates of the Book of 
Mormon were found and shown to 
the Prophet Joseph by the angel 



Moroni, and where they were giv- 
en to Joseph by him; which is a 
truth that all Latter-day Saints will 
have to accept in order to acknowl- 
edge the divine authority of the 
man who has borne this testimony 
to the world, and who was instru- 
mental in revealing the fulness of 
the Gospel to the children of men. 

From Palmyra we visited Kirt- 
land, Ohio, and looked again over 
the ground once occupied as a 
dwelling place of the Latter-day 
Saints. Where many years ago a 
prosperous, thrifty people dwelt in 
somewhat large numbers, today we 
find a little scattered village. The 
country is almost deserted. The 
population at present approximates 
about 400, or 500 people. The temple 
still stands as a monument of the 
sacrifice of this once poor but 
faithful people, who in that early 
day sacrcificed not only their means 
and their time, but their comfort 
and the comfort of their families, 
for the purpose of building that 
house in obedience to the command 
of God. Those who possess it now 
comprehend little of the objects 
and purposes for which the tem- 
ples of God are built. They little 
understand the main principle, main 
doctrine, or main reason and cause 
making it necessary to erect temples 
unto God. Those principles are re- 
jected by those who are today in 
possession of the building. It is 
simply used by them as an ordinary 
meetinghouse and a place for Sim- 
day school. So long as it is used 
for even this purpose, we have no 
reason to complain, and we do not 
complain. We have gone beyond 
it ; we have outgrown that building. 
Today we have no use for it, as the 
Lord has shown us even a better 
and a greater way, and so far as I 
am concerned, those who possess it 
are perfectly welcome to it, al- 



6 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



though the manner in which they 
came in possession of it, to my 
mind, is exceedingly questionable. 

From Ohio we did not follow 
down the course of the Church into 
Missouri and from Missouri into 
the state of Illinois. We passed 
over that part of the migrations of 
the Saints, going direct to Car- 
thage, the scene of the martyrdom. 
I had a desire to see that place, as I 
had never seen it before; and I felt 
that I would like to see the spot 
where the blood of those innocent 
men was shed for the testimony 
they bore to the world of the divine 
mission to which they were called — - 
a command from God to restore the 
fulness of the Gospel and the way 
of life and salvation to the world. 
I will not attempt to express to you 
in the least degree how I felt on 
that ground. We did not remain 
there long, but came to Nauvoo, the 
last resting place of the Latter-day 
Saints in the eastern part of our 
land, at the time near the western 
frontier of the United States. 

It was a source of great delight 
and pleasure to visit the scenes of 
my childhood, and to go around the 
deserted city and see the various 
houses which I remembered from 
my childhood. We visited the place 
that was once called the "Mansion," 
the home of the Prophet Joseph 
Smith, so altered and changed to- 
day, internally at least, and so old 
and dilapidated outside, that one 
familiar with it in the early days 
could scarcely recognize it as the 
same place. The old homesttead 
that was first built on the bank of 
the river, occupied by the Patriarch 
Joseph (the father of the Prophet 
Joseph) and his family in the early 
days, still stands, but in a most neg- 
lected condition, almost ready to 
crumble to the earth. 

We visited the spot where the 



bodies of the Prophet Joseph and 
his brother were buried, after their 
martyrdom, and also their brothers,. 
Don Carlos and Samuel. We recog- 
nized as nearly as might be the spot 
in which their sacred remains were 
deposited after their death, the 
bodies of the Prophet and the Patri- 
arch having been removed two or 
three times in order to satisfy a. 
fancy of somebody, in order to pre- 
vent their w T hereabouts being known; 
— the history of which I am thank- 
ful to have, as I received it from 
an eye-witness. 

We also visited the Nauvoo- 
House, the place where the orig- 
inal manuscript of the P>ook of 
Mormon was placed by the hand 
of the Prophet Joseph Smith, to- 
gether with a bound copy of the 
Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and 
Covenants and other Church pub- 
lications extant at that time ; and 
with petitions to the governors of' 
the various states, on the part of 
the Latter-day Saints, for redress 
for the wrongs they had sustained 
at the hand of Missouri. These 
and other relics were deposited 
there and in after years exhumed 
and removed by Mr. Bidamon, who- 
was then in possession of the prop- 
erty. 

We likewise visited the spot 
where once stood the house in- 
which the revelation on plural 
marriage was first written by Wm. 
Clayton, by dictation of the Prophet 
Joseph Smith; and also where the 
Endowments were first revealed' 
and given by him. We also visited 
the place where the revelation on- 
plural marriage, given through the 
Prophet Joseph Smith, was first: 
read to the high council of the stake 
of Zion, at Nauvoo, by Hyrum 
Smith, and recalled some of the 
historical facts that occurred within 
those walls. I pointed out to my 



PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH.

friends the spot on the shore of the 
Mississippi river where the Prophet 
landed with his brother, from a 
skiff, when they gave themselves 
up into the hands of the mob to go 
to their martyrdom at Carthage. 
We visited other places of interest, 
but it would be too much for me to 
attempt to express my feelings in 
visiting these ancient, now almost 
obliterated places of interest. We 
found in Nauvoo a very kindly feel- 
ing existing on the part of the peo- 
ple whom we met. They all seemed 
to be friendly to us, pleased to meet 
us, and we felt very much delighted 
with the spirit that we found in that 
once favored and flourishing place. 
After our visit there we returned 
by rail home. 

I want to say to my brethren and 
sisters that I have returned home 
physically very much improved over 
what I was when I went away. 
Now, I realize of course, this is a 
very trivial affair and of but very 
little interest to you. At the same 
time, it has been a voyage and a 
trip that has been fraught with very 
great interest to myself, and has 
been I think profitable to me, not 
only physically but spiritually. I 
return to you, to my home, to my 
duties and to my labors ' with the 
people of the Latter-day Saints, de- 
termined as ever I was to be true 
to the people of God, to my cov- 
enants and to all men ; to honor the 
Holy Priesthood that has been con- 
ferred upon me ; and I do not care 
for and don't want to pay any heed 
to the ridiculous nonsense, the fool- 
ish twaddle, and the impious slurs 
that are being cast at me and my 
people, by wicked hearts and per- 
verted minds. Let God deal with 
them as seemeth Him good. Don't 
you allow yourselves to be troubled 
over these things in the least. 

Now, my brethren and sisters, I 



did not anticipate occupying so 
much time, when I arose, and I 
hope you will pardon me for tres- 
passing so long upon your patience. 
I rejoice in the testimony that I 
have received and in the assurance 
I feel in my soul that God is pleased 
with the most of His people. There 
may be some who are foolish 
amongst us, shallow persons who< 
look only to the surface, who do not 
go down into the truth — into the 
facts. There may be those who are- 
swayed for a little while by the 
popular clamor, who may give way 
to some extent, to the things that 
seem to pervade certain quarters, 
but when they wake up to their 
condition and to the real truth, 
many of the few that are thus in- 
fluenced and swayed against the 
truth and against reason and right- 
eousness, will be willing to repent 
in sackcloth and ashes. It is not 
my purpose to stand here and try to 
make any apology or to offer any 
defense of my own course, of my 
own life and labors.. I am willing 
to leave myself and my labors and 
my life in the hands of God, and to 
the judgment of my friends and the 
people of God. If I have wronged 
any man spiritually or temporally, 
in any sense or in any form, I pray 
him to come to me and let me 
know wherein I have wronged him 
or done him any harm, and I will 
go more than half way — I will go 
the whole distance if necessary to 
make it right with him. 

I am for the kingdom of God. My 
brethren and I, I trust, are united 
in this, and if need be I think we 
can put aside any difference that 
may exist between us, and unite in 
that which is good and right and 
proper for the defense of the people 
of Zion and for the continuance of 
the upbuilding thereof. I do not 
think that there is any serious 



8 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



breach or any serious difficulty ex- 
isting among the Latter-day Saints 
anywhere. I think that all that is 
necessary is for us to see the light 
and we will walk in the light ; to 
understand our duties and we will 
do them, no matter what our private 
feelings may be. The Lord bless 
you, peace be unto you. 

I want to say to these presidents 
■of stakes who are present : you have 
any confidence ; you have my love. 
I pray for you every day of my 
life, and I trust that you remember 
me and my brethren in your pray- 
ers. We understand the responsi- 
bilities that rest upon you in the 
discharge of your duties. You are 
fathers to the people ; that great re- 
sponsibility rests upon you; your 
labors are manifold and sometimes 
very difficult. We realize the bur- 
dens that you have to bear, the pa- 
tience that you have to exercise and 
exhibit in the discharge of your 
duty, in order that you may avoid 
giving offense, and that you may 
reconcile the people, over whom you 
preside, to that which is right with- 
out using drastic measures. We 
understand this, and you have our 
sympathy, our fellowship, our love, 
and what strength you may derive 
from our faith and prayers, that 
you may preside in righteousness 
over your different stakes of Zion. 
and that your brethren associated 
with you may be united with you, 
and that vpu may pull together in 
that which is right and proper for 
the upbuilding of Zion and the de- 
fense of the people of God. 

I see before me a number of 
young men who bave been entrust- 
ed with the presidency of missions 
abroad, and I want to say to you 
that so far as I have been acquaint- 
ed with these men, they are men 
after my own heart, true men, faith- 
ful, diligent in the performance of 



their duties, acceptable and honor- 
able in the sight of God and man. 
We love them and we admire their 
courage in absenting themselves 
from their homes for years at a 
time, making sacrifices of their per- 
sonal interests and enjoyment, for 
the good of the people abroad in the 
world and for Zion. We admire 
them and say to them as to the pres- 
idents of stakes on whom so much 
depends, God bless you one and all 
and strengthen you in the perform- 
ance of your duties. We look upon 
the counselors of these men in the 
same way and we would say to 
them, one and all, stand together 
with your presiding officers, be 
united in whatever will tend to 
build up Zion and defeat the pur- 
pose of her enemies, whatever that 
purpose may be. 

Above all things let me say to 
the counselors of the presidents of 
stakes and of missions and to the 
Bishops and their counselors, — let 
me say to you all, live exemplary 
lives, so that you can each say to 
the people: "Come and follow me; 
follow my example ; obey my pre- 
cepts ; be in union with me, and fol- 
low me as I am appointed to lead, 
advise and counsel, as I follow 
Christ." 

Let every man live so that his 
character will bear the closest in- 
spection, and that it may be seen 
as an open book, so that he will have 
nothing to shrink from or be 
ashamed of. Let all men who are 
elevated to positions of trust in the 
Church live so that no man can 
point to their faults, because they 
will have no faults ; so that no man 
can justly accuse them of wrong- 
doing, because they do j \) wrong ; 
that no man can point out their de- 
fects as "human" and as "weak 
mortals." because they are living 
up to the principles of the Gospel,

and are not merely "weak human 
creatures" devoid of the Spirit of 
God and the power to live above sin. 
That is the way for all men to live 
in the kingdom of God. 

We should set an example ; we 
should be true to the faith, as 
Brother Stephens sings to us ; true 
to the faith ! We should be true to 
our covenants, true to our God, and 
true to one another and to the inter- 
ests of Zion, no matter what the 
consequences may be, no matter 
what may result. I can tell you 
that the man who is not true to 
Zion and to the interests of the peo- 
ple will be the man who will be 
found bye and bye, left out and 
in a pitiable spiritual condition. 
' The man who stays with the king- 
dom of God, the man that is true to 
this people, the man that keeps him- 
self pure and unspotted from the 
world, is the man that God will ac- 

- cept, that God will uphold, that He 
will sustain and that will prosper in 

' the land, whether he be in the en- 
joyment of his liberty or be con- 
fined in prison cells ; it makes no 
difference where he is, he will come 

- out all right. 

May the Lord bless my brethren 

- and my sisters who are engaged in 
the work of the ministry. Here are 
our sisters engaged in the Relief 
Society work, with whom I had the 
pleasure of meeting last evening. 
Here are sisters who are connected 
with the Mutual Improvement as- 
sociations, and those also connected 
with the Primary work and our 

' Sunday school interests, as well as 
the brethren associated with these 
organizations. They all have our 
blessings, because we have confi- 
dence in them. We believe that 
they know the truth themselves and 
do not have to borrow light from 
somebody else. We know that 
their integrity is unimpeachable; 



we know they love God and the 
truth and that they love the work 
more than their own personal in- 
terest. We know many of them 
and we know these are their feel- 
ings. We love them ; they have our 
respect, our full confidence ; the 
blessings of the Lord will attend 
them. He has done so in the past 
and He will continue to bless them 
so long as they continue to sustain 
the Priesthood of God that has been 
placed in the earth to guide the 
Church and to counsel in the affairs 
of the kingdom of God. 

What I mean by the Kingdom of 
God is the organization of the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints, over which the Son of 
God presides, and not man. That is 
what I mean. I mean the Kingdom 
of which Christ is the King and not 
man. If any men object to Christ, 
the Son of God, being King of Is- 
rael, let them object and go to hell 
just as quick as they please. 

Let us sustain Christ, His people, 
and His cause of righteousness and 
redemption ; let us sustain one an- 
other in the right, and kindly ad- 
monish one another in regard to 
wrong-doing, that we may be 
friends and saviors on Mount Zion, 
one for another, and that we may 
help the weak and strengthen them, 
encourage the doubtful and bring 
light to their right understandings 
as far as it is possible, that we may 
be instrumental in the hands of God 
of being saviors among men. Not 
that we have power to save men. 
We have not ; but we have power to 
show them how they can obtain sal- 
vation through obedience to the 
laws of God. We can show them 
ho 1 " walk in order to be saved, 
for we have the right to do that, we 
have knowledge and understanding 
as to how to do it, and it is our 
privilege to teach it and to enforce

it by example as well as by precept 
among our associates wherever we 
are in the world. 

I want to say of my Counselors 
in the Presidency, there are no bet- 
ter men in the world today ; and 
they are loyal to you ; they are loyal 
to the people of God ; they are loyal 
to their covenants and to the inter- 
ests of Zion, and they are laboring 
faithfully for the accomplishment 
of all the good that it is possible to 
accomplish through their influence 
and through their agency and faith- 
ful labors. I can say the same of 
my brethren the Twelve, and others 
associated with us in the Holy 
Priesthood. The Lord bless them 
and sustain them in right doing and 
in upholding and sustaining God's 
work and the authority that He has 
revealed and restored to His chil- 
dren in the world. Now, may the 
Lord Mess you, and may peace 
abound in your hearts and homes ; 
may the blessing of prosperity at- 
tend you in vour outgoings and in- 
comings and all you put your 
hands to in righteousness, is my 
prayer in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

The choir 'sang the anthem, 
"Song of the Redeemed." 



PRESIDENT JOHN R. WINDER. 

Good results of President Smith's recent 
extensive journey. — Assurance of the 
triumph of the Lord's work. — Grati- 
fying unity of the Church authorities 
and the Saints. 

My heart is filled with gratitude, 
praise and thanksgiving to my 
Heavenly Father that He has ex- 
tended my days until the present 
time, and that I have one more op- 
portunity of meeting with you, my 
brethren and sisters, in conference. 
I have been delighted in listening 



to the remarks that have been made 
by our beloved President. We re- 
joice to see him back again. We 
missed him while he was absent,, 
but we are glad to know that it has 
been beneficial to his health, and. 
pleased to hear of the good he has. 
accomplished while he has been 
visiting various missions of out 
Church in the nations of the earth.. 

I assure you, my brethren and. 
sisters, that his brethren are one 
with him in all matters that pertain 
to the best interests and building up- 
of the kingdom of God upon the 
earth. We are united in every ef- 
fort that is put forth for the welfare 
of the Church and people of the 
Lord, and I am grateful to be en- 
abled to bear testimony to what he 
has said in relation to this matter. 
I realize also that if we live near to* 
the Lord, this testimony will con- 
tinue to abide with us. This is the 
Lord's work that we are engaged 
in. The nearer- 1 live to the Lord 
the more strength He gives me, and 
my faith in His promises is in- 
creased. The work is growing and 
spreading. It is upward and on- 
ward, at home and abroad. 

We are glad to be able to bear 
this testimony. Rest assured, my 
brethren and sisters, there is no 
need to be alarmed. There is noth- 
ing that will transpire that can hin- 
der the progress of the work of the 
Lord. We put our trust in Him. It 
is His work, and we are endeavor- 
ing to carfy it forward here upon 
the earth. Although we may be 
feeble in our efforts, yet we know 
that when we are sustained by Him 
the work will progress. 

I am thankful, my brethren and 
sisters, for the health and strength 
the Lord has blessed me with, and 
that He has extended my life until 
the present time. I am fifteen years 
past what is termed the allotted age 



PRESIDENT ANT HON H. LUND.

of man — three score years and ten. 
Don't you think I ought to be 
thankful to the Lord for His good- 
ness and mercies to me ? I think so, 
above all men upon the earth. 

I am gratified to have the oppor- 
tunity of bearing testimony to the 
truth of the statements we have 
heard this morning related by our 
President. I desire to emphasize 
one remark of his, that he and his 
brethren are united, and repeat em- 
phatically that his brethren are 
united with him, and they propose 
to stand by him till the end. 

May God help us all to be faith- 
ful and true to the covenants we 
have made, to stand by each other, 
to be faithful, true, and united in 
furthering the interests of the king- 
dom of God, is my prayer in the 
name of Jesus. Amen. 



PRESIDENT ANTHON H. LUND. 

Beneficial effects of the Church confer- 
ence meetings. — Commendable dili- 
gence and self-denial of missionaries. 
— Mission of the Prophet Joseph 
Smith. — Heroic sacrifice of Joseph 
and Hyrum. 

I also can say that I have been 
delighted this morning to hear our 
President give a report of his trav- 
els in our missions abroad. I know 
how the Saints would rejoice to lis- 
ten to their beloved leader, and have 
the privilege in foreign lands to 
hear his voice. I am glad that he 
returns to us in improved health; 
for the work at home was hard on 
him and his health was not the best 
when he left us. I wish he had had 
a little more time when he was in 
Europe, so that he could have vis- 
ited the Scandinavian missions as 
well. I know that there are thou- 
sands of Saints there who would 
have rejoiced to have had him with 



them. Sometime, maybe, they will 
have this privilege. I believe the 
President's visit to different mis- 
sions has been productive of much 
good. It has strengthened the faith 
of the Saints and encouraged them 
in the good work. I also bear testi- 
mony to the fact that we are united 
with him ; that the Twelve and the 
brethren who labor in the ministry 
are united, and feel to do all in their 
power to build up_ God's cause upon 
the earth. 

These conferences are productive 
of much good. The Saints come 
together; they listen to the men 
whom they look up to as leaders in 
Zion, and they rejoice in hearing 
the instructions given, which they 
take with them to their homes. I 
believe those who come to the con- 
ferences really love the work and 
want to carry out the instructions 
given. Of course, the great ma- 
jority of the Saints cannot attend 
these conferences ; but they can at- 
tend their stake conferences, and 
these also are productive of great 
good. The Twelve, the Seven 
Presidents of Seventies, the Patri- 
arch, and other leading men visit 
these conferences, mingle with the 
Saints, feel the influence of their 
spirit, and give them such encour- 
agement and instructions as the 
spirit leads them to give and as the 
people are in need of. 

The work is progressing both at 
home and abroad. The reports 
from foreign missions, and from 
the missions in the United States, 
show that our Elders have never 
been more industrious and zealous 
in their labors than they are today. 
They try to perform their duty as 
messengers of salvation unto the 
people. They labor early and late, 
and though not rewarded with 
worldly honor, nor in many cases 
made very welcome, still they feel 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



it their duty to let others know 
what they themselves have received, 
to let them understand if they will 
the beauty of the Gospel, and tbf 
great necessity of obeying the prin- 
ciples which have been laid down 
by Him who is the author of our 
salvation. 

This work is bound to triumph in 
the earth, because the Lord has 
established it, and He has prom- 
ised that it shall not be given to 
another people. This dispensation 
is one in which the Lord will bring 
into one all things, and it will be 
connected with the dispensations 
that have passed. All will be 
brought under one head, and that 
head is Christ. We are laboring 
for this. We look upon the whole 
world as our brotherhood. We do 
not look down upon those who are 
not . of us ; for the Lord has re- 
vealed unto us that we all belong to 
the same family. We are thankful 
to the Lord that He has made us to 
understand the Gospel. We under- 
stand the great importance of obey- 
ing its principles, and we feel the 
necessity of letting others know 
this. Upon us rests this great re- 
sponsibility. 

I was pleased to hear our Presi- 
dent bear such a good testimony of 
our young men — sons, brothers and 
husbands — who are out in the 
world preaching the Gospel. Think 
of these young men obeying the call 
to preach the Gospel ! It shows the 
love there is in them, both for the 
Gospel and for their fellowmen. 
Unselfishly they go to the different 
nations of the earth and labor to 
spread the glad tidings restored 
unto the earth. The Lord is with 
them. He gives them a testimony 
that cannot be shaken, and they 
bear it unto men. In this they 
themselves are blessed. The experi- 
ence of the missionaries is that the 



years spent in preaching the Gospel 
are the happiest years of their 
lives. It needs self-denial, sacrci- 
fice, unselfishness, to perform this 
work, and in doing it joy comes to 
their souls. They leave worldly 
cares and thoughts of business at 
home, and put their whole heart in- 
to the work. They go from house 
to house spreading the word, deliv- 
ering tracts, and trying to get into 
conversation with men ; and though 
they are often rebuffed and have 
doors slammed in their faces, still 
thej' rejoice in their labors ; and 
when at night they kneel before the 
Lord they feel to thank Him for the 
exoeriences of the day, and prom- 
ise Him to continue in their labors, 
if He will give them strength. And 
how much joy comes to their hearts 
when they have been able to sow the 
Gospel seed in good soil and they 
see it springing forth, giving them 
hope that it will bear good fruit ! 

My testimony to you, my breth- 
ren and sisters, is that this is the 
work of God, and that Joseph 
Smith was a prophet of the Lord, 
raised up to usher in this last dis- 
pensation. He was called to be an 
instrument in the hands of the 
Lord to lr' 'in unto man the 

Gospel which had been taken from 
the earth. He performed his mis- 
sion well; he was faithful and true; 
and he was willing even to give his 
life for the truth. I was touched 
when the President said he saw the 
very place where the Prophet Jo- 
seph and his noble brother landed 
on their return to Nauvoo. Thev 
knew that bitter enemies were in 
their beloved city, seeking their 
lives; but undaunted they came 
back. Brother Joseph F. Smith 
was on the bank of the river and 
saw them land. W T hen he recently 
stood there and looked at the same 
spot, peculiar emotions must ha- ^ 



PRESIDENT FRANCIS M. LYMAN. 



come to his heart in thinking of that 
incident. It was about the last 
time he saw his beloved father and 
his uncle alive. They went to Car- 
thage. We know what took place. 
They suffered martyrdom for the 
cause which they knew was of God. 
Joseph Smith knew for himself that 
this was the work of God, and he 
often told others that they could 
know it also through the Spirit of 
God. He was willing to go, as he 
said himself, "like a lamb to the 
slaughter." He understood what 
was coming ; but he submitted 
willingly. He did not shrink, he 
did not leave his people and try to 
save his own life, but he sealed his 
testimony with his blood. And so 
did his brother Hyrum, the Patri- 
arch. Their integrity, love and de- 
votion come to us as their testa- 
ment. To us is also given the 
great boon of having an assurance 
of the truth, a knowledge for our- 
selves that this is the' work of God. 

Let us so live, brethren and sis- 
ters, that this testimony shall not 
leave us, that light may continue 
with us, that we may see the way 
in which we should walk, and, see- 
ing it, walk in it, that the gates of 
hell shall not prevail against us. 
God bless you all. Amen. 

The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn : 

Do what is right, the day-dawn is 
breaking, 

Hailing a future of freedom and 
light ; • 
Angels above us are silent notes tak- 
ing 

Of every action ; do what is right. 

Conference was adjourned till 2 
p. m. 

Benediction was pronounced by 
Patriarch Angus M. Cannon. 



AFTERNOON SESSION. 

Conference was resumed at 2- 
p. m. 

The choir and congregation sang, 
the hymn commencing : 

Come, come, ye Saints, no toil nor la- 
bor ' fear, 
Hut with joy wend your way; 
Though hard to you this journey may 
appear, 
Grace shall be as your day. 

Prayer was offered by Elder An- 
thony W. Ivins. 

The choir sang the hymn : 

I Tark, listen to the trumpeters ! 

They sound for volunteers, 
On Zion's bright and flower" mount: 

Behold the officers. 



PRESIDENT FKANCIS M. LYMAN. 

The Lord will take care of His Church 
and people. — The Gospel to be heard 
by all the world. — Its power to cor- 
rect evil and improve its devotees. — : 
Joy attained only by doing good. — All 
nations represented in the United 
States. — Confide in the Lord for guid- 
ance in all things. — The Lord pleas- 
ed with all His priesthood and peo- 
ple who do their duty. — Perpetuitv 
of the Church. 

I shall be very pleased if I can: 
make you hear. This congregation 
is much larger than we are used to' 
speaking to, and this house is so 
much larger than our meeting- 
places generally that it is with diffi- 
culty some of the brethren make 
themselves heard, while others seem 
to have voices that are penetrating 
and clear, and are easily heard from 
the start. 

I rejoiced exceedingly this morn- 
ing to see so generous an attend- 
ance upon the first meeting of the 
conference, and in being favored 
with a report from our President 



14 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



concerning his two months' ab- 
sence from home, from which we 
can realize the extent of travel and 
amount of labor he performed in 
that length of time. I wonder if any 
brother beside him has gone abroad 
to recuperate and rest and has met 
so many of the Saints and Elders, 
preached so many discourses and 
comforted the hearts of so many 
people in two months' time as he 
has. While he was gone we were 
laboring at home in the ministry ; 
but he traveled and labored more 
than any of us who stayed at home, 
and yet he has come home rested, 
refreshed, invigorated, and almost 
new physically, for which we thank 
the Lord. 

The work that we are engaged in, 
my brethren and sisters, is the work 
■of the Lord, as we heard this morn - 
ing; and it will be the Lord's busi- 
ness, as it always has been, to take 
care of His Church and people, 
whom He has brought together, 
converted, and convinced of the 
truth. He has established in our 
hearts that spirit which makes us 
•one, and which makes us a little 
different from any other people in 
the world ; for the Spirit of the 
Lord which we enjov differs in de- 
gree from that possessed by other 
people. The Gospel that we have 
received, the doctrines and prin- 
ciples that have been revealed from 
the Lord are a little different from 
those entertained and embraced by 
other people. The Lord has re- 
vealed the true plan of life and sal- 
vation in these days, in addition to 
what we find in the ancient scrip- 
tures ; that is, He has made plain to 
-us by modern revelation, and in the 
Nephite scriptures, doctrines that 
are not easily picked out by men 
from the Jewish scriptures. The 
-ordinances of the Gospel,the way of 
life and salvation, have been point- 



ed out to us in our own day, direct- 
ly from the Lord through His 
Prophet, Joseph Smith, and 
through the living oracles who 
have succeeded that Prophet. So 
that today there is quite a handful 
of people, approaching half a mil- 
lion possibly in all the world, who 
believe in the Gospel as revealed 
through the Prophet Joseph. It has 
been revealed, it has been published 
abroad, it has been preached, it has 
been received and comprehended 
by this little handful of people. 
And we are increasing in numbers, 
spreading abroad as well as being 
gathered from the world. It is de- 
signed by the Lord that the leaven 
shall leaven the whole lump; that- 
all the world shall have the privilege 
of hearing this Gospel, and shall be 
brought within reach of its spirit 
and ordinances, so that all the chil- 
dren of men, as well as the few who 
are Latter-day Saints, may have the 
privilege of hearing the Gospel and 
judging for themselves. 

I love the Gospel because it is 
the truth; because it corrects our 
errors and reproves us for our sins. 
The spirit of this work always con- 
demns our transgressions. We are 
so trained and schooled under the 
influence of the Spirit of the Lord 
that we cannot do wrong with im- 
punity. We cannot steal, nor lie, 
nor be immoral, impure or intem- 
perate, nor in any manner trespass 
upon the rights of men or women, 
without feeling the condemnation 
which comes to our souls at the of- 
fense, and the departure of the 
Spirit of the Lord from us. We 
realize this individually ; every per- 
son knows it. It is not necessary 
for us to be told by our Bishop, or 
President, or anyone else ; we know 
ourselves, for we have entered into 
a personal agreement and compact 
with our Father in heaven to serve 



PRESIDENT FRANCIS M. LYMAN. 



lb 



Him and keep His commandments, 
and He has consented to forgive 
our sins, to cleanse us, and to free 
us from the load of wickedness. 
Through our faith, obedience, re- 
pentance and works of righteous- 
ness we have entered into a cove- 
nant with Him to serve Him, and 
to obtain forgiveness of sins by our 
•devotion and service to Him, not 
for a few years, not for a certain 
term, but for our natural lives and 
throughout eternity ; for what the 
Lord does is with reference to eter- 
nity. So that, when we enter into 
covenant with Him, it is not only 
for our natural lives, but it is for 
eternity. We undertake to serve 
Him, to honor Him, to keep His 
commandments, and to walk up- 
rightly before Him. Then, by 
faithful service in this life, we are 
assured that the power of Satan 
with which we are assailed in this 
world shall cease in the world to 
come. It is not alone that we may 
•conquer and have advantages while 
we live this short time in the world, 
but that hereafter we shall be set 
free, have absolute liberty, unlimit- 
ed freedom, and that Satan cannot 
interfere with us. Now, what a 
splendid thing it is for us to have 
the guarantee of the Lord that if 
we will serve Him while we live in 
the flesh we shall thus baffle Satan, 
and he will not have power to 
"tempt us hereafter. We shall be 
free from him, and his right over 
-us will not pursue us in the world 
to come. Bad enough to be tor- 
mented here; but if we will resist 
•Satan and serve God He will give 
us freedom hereafter, and will re- 
deem us from our sins and trans- 
gressions, from the effects of the 
fall, and exalt us in His presence, 
free from the power of Satan who 
reigns so generally in this fallen 
•world. That is one of the great 



blessings we are to receive from the 
Lord. 

These are important things that 
the Lord guarantees to us through 
our faithfulness ; but we are ex- 
pected to devote our lives to His 
service and to works of righteous- 
ness, in which there is joy, happi- 
ness and safety, physically, morally 
and spiritually. By doing right we 
are absolutely safe, free and fear- 
less. We do not fear when we do 
right, we are afraid only when we 
transgress the law, when we break 
the ordinances, and when we dis- 
obey what is required of us ; for 
sin makes cowards of us all. As 
long as we work righteousness and 
serve the Lord we have no fear of 
any power in the earth. We may 
meet with hardships and trials in 
this life, which we are very likely 
to do, for it seems to be the lot of 
fallen man to have trials and diffi- 
culties, but if faithful there is re- 
demption and salvation for us. Ev- 
ery man that works righteousness 
today is favored and blessed of the 
Lord. And that should be the ef- 
fort of all Latter-day Saints ; for 
there is no profit in doing wrong. 
There is no reason why we should 
do wrong. There is no reason why 
we should be dishonest, immoral, 
intemperate, or corrupt in any de- 
gree; there is no profit in it. I 
wonder at myself and my brethren 
sometimes, when I discover our 
weaknesses, why it is that we 
should do wrong. Why should I 
wrong my brother? I never did 
wrong a brother in my life but I 
was ashamed of it and sorry for it. 
I have never done a wrong that I 
pride myself of. I have never glor- 
ied in wrongdoing ; but I have tak- 
en joy and felt happy in doing good, 
and in dealing by others as I would 
like them to deal by me, not only

towards the household of faith, but 
everybody else. 

We are all the children of God; 
all men are 1 1 is descendants. Some 
are Latter-day Saints, and some 
are not ; some believe in Deity, and 
some do not ; there are infidels, and 
there are heathen ; there are Chris- 
tians who believe in the Lord Jesus, 
and there are others who do not be- 
lieve in Him ; nevertheless, we are 
all the children of the Lord. We 
are one great family, having one 
common parent, who is our Father 
and the Father of our Lord and 
Savior Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ 
is also our Redeemer and Savior. 
He shed His blood for us ; made 
that supreme offering, which has 
never been made by anyone else. 
He trod the winepress alone. He 
shed His blood that you and I 
might be redeemed, that our sins 
should be blotted out, and that we 
should be washed clean, pure and 
free from every stain that is upon 
us. We can very profitably serve 
the Lord and keep His command- 
ments, for we know that this is the 
work of the Lord, that this is His 
Church and people, that this land 
has been kept for the gathering of 
His people, for their home, and to 
remain so, where they shall be 
trained and taught in the ways of 
the Lord and walk in His paths. 
We realize that this mountain coun- 
try has been preserved and opened 
up at just the right time by the 
Lord for the gathering of His peo- 
ple from all the world. We can 
realize that we are just where the 
Lord wants us to be, and where He 
wants us to stay ; where He wants 
us to build up His kingdom ; where 
we have built temples; and from 
whence we have sent the Gospel to 
the world, and will continue to do 
so, for that is our ministry and mis- 
sion. There shall not be a nation 



nor a section that shall not hear the 
Gospel. The way will be prepared 
among all the nations of the earth ;, 
religious liberty will be established. 
This great nation of the United 
States is made up of pieces of other 
nations. We have invited every- 
body to come, and they have come. 
I suppose there is not a nation in 
the world that is not represented- 
among the people of this republic. 
All the blood that flows in human 
veins upon this earth is represented 
among the people of the United 
States. And the Lord has done 
this; He has brought these people 
together ; He has prepared the way. 
He allowed this side of the world to 
be hidden for many centuries. It 
was lost to the knowledge of man ; 
but finally it was discovered. It 
has always been here since it was 
organized and created — and that is 
a long time ago, but it was lost 
sight of. At the right time, how- 
ever, the Lord led men to discover 
this country. He led people to 
come and settle it, and He has con- 
trolled their settlements and the or- 
ganization of the government, and 
has arranged that there should be 
liberty upon this side of the world. 
He has laid the foundations of a 
very great nation, a nation of great 
power, strength, wealth and wis- 
dom. In this nation the Lord ar- 
ranged to lay the foundations of 
His Church, and it is growing. It 
grows just as fast as all the mem- 
bership do their duty faithfully and 
well. 

The Lord will take care of and 
preserve us if we will do right. It 
is the right of every Latter-day 
Saint to know the truth, and to- 
know what is required of him or 
her, in business, in literature, in art,, 
in science, in music, in politics, and 
in everything else. Let the Spirit 
of the Lord manifest to us in these

matters. Let us be in such com- 
munication with the Lord that we 
may know just exactly what to do. 
Tell the Lord about our temporal- 
ities, what we desire to accomplish, 
and obtain the inspiration of the 
Lord. The Lord knows everyone 
of us ; He knows our feelings and 
our weaknesses. He comprehends 
us ; knows our necessities, our in- 
tegrity, our faith. If not a hair of 
our heads can fall to the ground 
without His notice, how easy it is 
for Him to know our nature, our 
condition, our weaknesses, and oar 
strong points. If we have intelli- 
gence, skill, wisdom. He discovers 
it. He knows our status exactly , 
therefore, let us be free with the 
Lord. Let us be familiar with Him 
in conversation and in conduct, and 
deport ourselves as in His presence ; 
for we are there. My brethren and 
my sisters, you never speak, you 
never think, you are never in- 
spired, there is not an ambition in 
your heart, not a thought, either of 
virtue or of wickedness, that is not 
open before the Lord ; Lie compre- 
hends these things. It is our duty 
therefore to so train ourselves day 
by day that it will be an easy mat- 
ter for us to do right in the morn- 
ing, at noon, and all through the 
day, so that when we retire at night 
we may be able to represent our- 
selves to our Father as having 
walked uprightly before Him all 
the day ; that we have not done 
wrong, but have been sober, tem- 
perate, conscientious and upright. 
"Father, I have kept the command- 
ments of the Lord this day, be 
pleased to hear me. I have sick- 
ness in my family, I have weakness- 
es, I need assistance financially, I 
am in trouble, my heart is afflicted 
and tender, give me comfort, give 
me joy and consolation. In these 
hours of trial, when difficulty and 



darkness rise before us, when the 
clouds threaten us, Father, give us 
to know that we are in the line of 
our duty, that we have served Thee 
and are worthy of Thy favor and 
blessing, and that Thou wilt take 
care of us." 

That is the condition we should 
be in, my brethren and sisters, as 
the followers of the Lord Jesus 
Christ. Having entered into cove- 
nant with the Lord, having received 
His favor and His anointing, the 
unction of His Spirit, we should 
cultivate that Spirit until we can 
dwell in its light and inspiration all 
the day long and be guided by it in 
the performance of our duties, in 
the care of our families, in business 
and in everything else that legiti- 
mately occupies any share of our 
attention. The Lord will lead His 
people as a whole : He will lead 
President Joseph F. Smith : He will 
not let him go astray. I am under 
no obligation to take care of Presi- 
dent Smith, or to correct him for 
fear he will go astray ; that is the 
business of the Lord, He has that 
work in hand. He has His servant 
in training, and He directs and 
counsels him. He leads him by His 
Spirit, and will always do so. You 
cannot do better than to sustain 
those whom the Lord sustains and 
has appointed. He has led us, He 
has called us forth, Lie has ordained 
and inspired us, and He has not in- 
spired us any more than He has in- 
spired you. Every member of this 
Church is entitled to the inspiration 
of the Lord. When a soul is 
brought unto a knowledge of the 
truth and baptized into the fold, 
that soul is just as precious in the 
sight of the Lord as is a Prophet, 
an Apostle, a President, or anv 
other man, for he is a son of Cod. 
How we love our little children! 
You tender-hearted mothers, you 



18 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



fathers that are tender-hearted — I 
learn that fathers are tender-heart- 
ed. Down at Provo a couple of 
weeks ago I discovered that tender- 
heartedness is not alone with the 
mothers. There is a tender-hearted 
father also in Salt Lake City, and 
he is not alone, not an exception to 
the rule. I believe that fathers 
generally are tender-hearted as well 
as mothers. Now, do we love our 
children? Don't we feel a pride in 
the development and growth of our 
sons and daughters? Don't we re- 
joice exceedingly when they do 
right? Are we not grieved when 
they do wrong, when they are neg- 
lectful and careless, and when they 
are indifferent to God? Oh, how 
sorrowful and terrible it is when the 
fear of God is not before their eyes ! 
For we learn that the fear of God 
is the beginning of wisdom. If a 
man fears to offend his Maker, if 
he loves the Lord, he will under- 
take to do just exactly what the 
Lord wants him to do. He will 
seek after the Lord ; and every man 
who seeks after the Lord, with a 
pure heart and a repentant spirit, 
will find Him. The Lord will come 
to him, He will listen to him, will 
direct him, and open the way for 
him to find the truth and the way 
of escape from the troubles of this 
world. 

The Lord has this people in His 
care. He is looking after them, is 
pushing them together, and is mul- 
tiplying them on every hand. They 
have their trials, hardships and 
difficulties; but the Lord will al- 
ways be present to take care of 
them, for He loves them. This 
work must be built up, and the Lord 
■ will build it up with His people — 
our parents, our brothers and sis- 
ters, our descendants. He will con- 
tinue to gather people from all the 
world, and the work will increase 



and spread abroad until it shall cov- 
er the earth. The Lord has set His 
hand the last time; He will finish 
His work in due time, and He will 
do it in a rational manner. Its 
growth and development will be 
legitimate, and we will comprehend 
it as it develops. We know the 
work, and also the people, because 
we have been associated with them 
almost from the beginning. The 
Lord's hand is over His people in 
all that is righteous ; not to save us 
in our sins, not to encourage or tol- 
erate us in sin, but to bring us to 
repentance and reformation. That 
is the work the Lord is doing with 
His people today. He is pleased 
with His servant, President T oseph 
F. Smith, and with his counselors. 
He is pleased with the Twelve 
Apostles, the Seven Presidents of 
Seventies, and with the Presiding 
Patriarch. He is pleased with the 
Hio-h Priests, the Seventies, the 
Patriarchs, and with all the Priest- 
hood who are laboring faithfully in 
the world doing their duty. 

As we heard from President 
Smith this morning, it is delightful 
to know that our boys go out into 
the world and preach the Gospel as 
they are doing. The Lord magni- 
fies them and fills them with His 
Spirit, and it is marvelous what 
they are accomplishing. I appeal to 
this congregation today in behalf of 
our Elders in the field. I was with 
them a few years ago. I have spent 
a number of years in the field 
abroad as well as at home, and have 
labored with the Elders to some ex- 
tent. I do not know that I did my 
full duty, but I endeavored to train 
your boys who were with rne by 
thousands in the European Mission. 
I labored with every one of them, 
and entered into a compact with 
those young men that when we re- 
turned home we would serve the

Lord and keep His commandments, 
Ave would sustain the authorities 
of the Church, and be true and 
faithful. We hear now that there 
are some brethren who, when they 
return home, forget what mannei 
of men they have been. They for- 
get what ministers and representa- 
tives of the Lord they have been in 
the earth, and return sometimes to 
their foolishness, and are not as de - 
voted and faithful as they ought to 
be. Sometimes they may be neg- 
lected, and occasionally I wonder if 
they are properly taught in the mis- 
sionary field. I hope they are. 
They should be thoroughly trained 
there ; in fact, they should be 
trained before they go, like the edu- 
cation of a child should begin be- 
fore it is born. They ought to be 
taught at home, by fathers, by Bish- 
ops, by High Priests and Seventies ; 
not a boy should escape our atten- 
tion. He should receive considera- 
tion at our hands, be encouraged, 
strengthened, stimulated, restrained 
if necessaray, and warned of his 
waywardness, and be made a gen- 
tleman, a manly man, prepared to 
go out into the world with strength 
of character and the determination 
to do what is right, to represent the 
people of God, and to represent 
the Savior. We represent the 
Savior in that we go out clothed 
with His authority and with power 
to minister and officiate in His 
name, to preach the Gospel to the 
world, to call men to repentance 
and reformation, and to teach them 
the way of life and salvation, that 
the Spirit of the Lord may dwell in 
them, that they may be gathered 
and assist in the establishment of 
Zion and the accomplishment of the 
purposes of the Lord on this side of 
the world. 

The place of gathering for the 
present seems to be here; but the 



Lord's work will no doubt spread 
until finally it covers the earth as 
the waters cover the great deep. 
The design of the Lord is that His 
children shall be saved, and for that 
we labor. Our labors should not 
only be for the salvation of our 
boys when they return home, but 
also for the salvation of the people 
who gather. Our examples before 
them should be good. When they 
come from the various parts of the 
earth they should find Zion ; they 
expect to find Zion. They do not 
expect to find us following after 
the fashions and ways of the world. 
They understand that we have 
gathered out from the world, and 
are separated from the world, as we 
ought to be. We should be a pecu- 
liar people right here in Salt Lake 
City, and in all other cities, in every 
part of our state, and the other 
States where our people are found. 
We ought not to indulge in the 
things which are forbidden by the 
Lord. We should not be intemper- 
ate, profane. Not a Sabbath-break- 
er should be among the Latter-day 
Saints, nor a gambler. It is not 
necessary for us to be gamblers; it 
is not profitable; it is not a good 
business ; it is immoral, degrading 
and humiliating. The use of liquor, 
of tea, coffee and tobacco, is for- 
bidden of the Lord ; He says they 
are not good for the people ; they 
defile and poison the system. Not 
a liar should be among the Latter- 
day Saints ; every man should 
speak the truth. Every man 
should do right by his neighbor; 
never wrong him, whether he is a 
Latter-day Saint or otherwise. Men 
may wrong us sometimes, but we 
should not retaliate; we should do 
good for evil. 

These are some sentiments en- 
tertained by the Latter-day Saints. 
Without multiplying words and 



20 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



taking more of your time, I desire 
to let you know that I realize that 
this Gospel of the Kingdom is here 
among the children of men for the 
last time, and that it is never to de- 
part. The people will always have 
inspired men among them ; there 
will be Prophets and Apostles ; 
there will be men holding the Holy 
Priesthood, with authority to min- 
ister in the name of the Lord, now 
and forever upon this earth. This 
work will spread abroad and be- 
come more important in the world 
than it is today. It ma}' meet with 
reverses, and evil influences and 
powers may be pitted against it, as 
in the past, but the triumph of the 
work is as certain as that we stand 
on this earth today. It cannot be 
otherwise for it is the Lord's work, 
not the work of Joseph Smith, nor 
of any man. He has set His hand 
to accomplish it, and He has made 
no mistake. lie knows the people 
of the world, He knows the preci- 
ous souls there are on the earth to- 
day, and He knows the precious 
souls that are coming right along 
to our communities. He knows 
exactly the nature of those who 
will be born among our neighbors, 
and He is prepared to take care of 
those that come into the world. The 
Gospel will be preached, religious 
liberty established, and everything 
prepared for the advancement of 
the Church of Christ. We need not 
be disturbed or distressed about the 
Church ; we need not fear the 
clouds that gather, for they have 
always gathered and always will 
gather, from time to time, until the 
work is accomplished. The Lord 
will redeem His people and raise up 
friends unto them in all nations. 
He will control the hearts of the 
children of men, as He will control 
us for our salvation, if we 



will listen to Him and let 
Him help us. If not, we will go 
to destruction, just like anybody 
else that is wicked ; and when we 
leave this world and go to the next 
we will be under the power of 
Satan still, unless we serve God 
with full purpose of heart while we 
are here. If we will do that, our 
salvation and eternal liberty is se- 
cure. That is a consolation to me, 
it should be to all Latter-day Saints. 

I pray the Lord to bless you, my 
brethren and sisters, and that His 
Spirit may attend upon us most 
generously during the remainder of 
this conference, in the name of 
Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The choir sang an Anthem. 
"Come, let us go to the Mountain 
of the Lord." 



ELDEK JOHN HENRY SMITH. 

An inspirational hymn — Necessit" for 
inculcating faith and love of the 
Gospel in the children. — Blessings in- 
yoked upon the good and oppressed 
of all creeds and lands. — Admonitions 
to the young. — Gratitude for th; 
freedom guaranteed by American in- 
stitutions. 

I picked up the hymn book and 
opened to a hymn that has strongly 
impressed my mind, and although 
I am not a very good reader, I be- 
lieve I will endeavor to read it. It 
is found on page 127: 

Up ! arouse thee, O beautiful Zion, 
Wake, awake, hear the warder's deep 
cry, 

For the season of slumber hath ended. 

And the spoiler is watchful and nigh.. 
With courage elate, and heart to be 
great. 

All deadly incumbrance cast down. 
Gird on for the fight, your armor so 
bright, 

For the prize Is a glorious crown. 



ELDER JOHN HENRY SMITH. 



21 



Up ! arouse thee, O beautiful Zion, 
Give the mammon care-clouds to the 
wind, 

When the bugle's shrill summons is — 
Rally! 

They are cowards that linger behind. 
You've foes to o'ercome in each heart 

and home, 
Then fixed be your purpose, and 

high, 

With God at vour head, O feel not dis- 
mayed, 

But go forward to conquer, or die. 

Who would shrink from the glorious 
battle. 

With so dazzling a guerdon in view? 
If so base as to herd with the traitor, 
It is, dastard! not sparkling for you. 
With nerve strong as steel, and soul 
that can feel, 
Stand firm for the pure and the 
brave ; 

Be foremost in right, and trust in 
God's might — 
'Tis such heroes that heaven will 
save. 

Lo ! destruction hangs over the na- 
tions, 

Though not seen by the unholy 
throng ; 

And death will be heard in the echoes 

Of the gathering, ominous storm ! 
Then arouse thee, O beautiful Zion, 
Wake, awake, 'tis the warder's deep 
cry, 

For the season of slumber hath ended, 
And the spoiler is watchful and nigh. 

My brothers and sisters, it is a 
joy indeed for me to be with you 
in this conference today, and to 
have listened to the good words 
that have fallen from the lips of 
our brethren who have spoken unto 
us. We live in the day and time 
when the word of the Lord is to be 
carried to every nation, kindred, 
tongue and people, before the com- 
ing of that great and dreadful day 
when the judgments of our God arc 
to be poured out upon the na- 
tions of the earth. What a sacred 
mission is ours in fulfillment of 
the obligation that he who has been 
warned is to warn his neighbor; 
that upon his shoulders rests in 
great degree the salvation of his 



fellowmen, at least to the extent of 
his ability to herald the Gospel 
among the children of men and de- 
clare its restoration. Not one of 
us, to whom the glad message of 
eternal truth has come, should fail 
to remember that upon us rests the 
responsibility of calling to repent- 
ance the children of our Father, 
our brothers and sisters in every 
land and clime. We cannot escape 
the effects of this requirement, only 
by discharging it to the best of out- 
ability ; not alone in carrying the 
glad tidings of great joy to the 
world, or in entering the sacred 
temples of God and opening the 
doorway of salvation to the human 
race who have gone behind the veil, 
through the administration of the 
ordinances of the Lord's house, but 
also in the character of that sacred 
guardianship that we should throw 
around our sons and daughters. 
How shall we feel, as we stand in 
the presence of the Great Judge of 
the quick and the dead, when our 
ministry in life is done, if any of 
our children shall say to the 
Father, "In our household the mor- 
al obligations of the Gospel of Jesus 
Christ were unknown and un- 
taught ; the principles and doctrines 
essential for salvation, and seeking 
the impress of the Spirit from on 
high, were unthought of and un- 
taught in the household where it 
was my privilege to be reared." 

1 trust that the words of the 
hymn I have read in your hearing 
will arouse you with gladness and 
joy, and will awaken in your souls 
the thought that the battle is on, 
that the banner of our Christ has 
been thrown to the breeze ; that it is 
our mission and ministry to preach 
repentance in our own homes, in 
our own neighborhoods, among the 
men and women with whom we 
mingle, as well as carrying the 



22 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



seeds of the Gospel to the children 
of the world, and pleading with 
them to turn from the evils that 
stalk abroad, and learn the way of 
life and salvation. My brothers 
and sisters, I ask you to remember 
these words : 

Wake, awake, 'tis the warder's deep 
cry, 

For the season of slumber hath ended, 
And the spoiler is watchful and nigh. 

I have nothing in the world but 
blessings for every one of you who 
honor God and the truth. I have 
nought but blessing for every 
Christian man and woman who is 
discharging the duties and obliga- 
tions of a Christian according to the 
best light and knowledge he or she 
may possess. I have nothing but 
sympathy for the thoughtless, the 
wayward and the reckless. I love 
all the children of my heavenly 
Father. I feel that there is on our 
part a necessity for an awakening 
such as we have possibly never 
known before, in seeking to implant 
in the hearts of those whom God 
has entrusted to us an understand- 
ing of His great work, and such 
faith as was exhibited by the men 
and women who crossed the plains 
with hand-carts in 1856, amid the 
deep and falling snows, and who 
buried their loved ones in the drifts, 
determined upon doing the bidding 
of the Master. Is that spirit of 
heroism, of the love of right, and 
that determination to follow the 
commandments of God, being en- 
gendered in the souls of these sons 
and daughters that our Father has 
entrusted to us ? Are they ready to 
rise up and say, I glorify God for 
the mother that bore me, and the 
faith she displayed in leaving her 
fatherland to have part in the estab- 
lishment of God's work? Are they 
in the spirit to say, I will stand by 



the father that begot me, who min- 
istered and labored midst tribula- 
tion and trial to provide the bless- 
ings and comforts of life, and I wilt 
see that his last days shall be hon- 
ored in an upright son, in a consist- 
ent, virtuous and true daughter, and 
in the fulfillment of my mission for" 
the betterment and blessing of the 
people with whom I mingle? Or 
shall we forget ourselves to the ex- 
tent that the drunkard, the whore- 
master, the villain that plots and 
schemes the destruction and over- 
throw of honest men, shall be the 
companions of our children and 
seek to lead them to destruction?" 
Shall not our voices be heard de- 
claring God's word, proclaiming 
His truth, pointing the way of life, 
seeking to establish in men that 
fortitude that shall enable them to- 
resist the evils that are leading to 
destruction so many of our fellows- 
in various parts of the world? 

May heaven's peace attend every 
good man and woman in every land 
who are following the propositions- 
involved in the religious faith they 
have espoused, and are seeking to- 
better themselves and their fellow- 
creatures. May heaven's blessing 
be upon those who are oppressed in 
all lands, that the opportunity may 
come to them to find a home under 
the starry flag we love. May the 
principles involved in that govern- 
ment under which most of us, pos- 
sibly, have been born and reared 
be established and written in our 
souls, — the love of God, of country, 
of liberty, of justice and mercy, of 
purity and truth, and a detesta- 
tion and hatred of the immorality, 
crime and wickedness that stalk 
abroad. May the God of heaven- 
write it in your souls, you "Mor- 
mon" boys and girls, that He has 
called you to repentance, has point- 
ed to you the way of life, has given-

to you fathers and mothers whose 
hearts have been in His keeping. I 
trust that, though storms shall beat 
and tempests come, you will honor 
the father and mother that survived 
the dreadful experiences on the 
plains in 1856, or the fathers and 
mothers of other years who left 
fatherland, or those upon our own 
land whose feet were blistered and 
frozen as they fled from the 
schemes and machinations of foul 
and cowardly wretches who sought 
to destroy their liberties. 

My friends, I have this feeling in 
my soul today, and if I could write 
it in the minds of the "Mormon" 
boys and girls, I would write this 
•motto there : "The flag that the 
Divine One permitted to be thrown 
to the breeze, as the stars and 
stripes, should never be lowered by 
human hand." The principles of 
liberty involved in the constitution 
of this country of ours should never 
be trampled beneath the feet of any 
man ; but every principle of honor, 
of justice, of purity, mercy and 
right, should be guarded by the 
men and women reared in some 
understanding of the principles of 
that faith which we ourselves have 
become acquainted with. 

A few years ago the President of 
the United States made an appeal 
to the descendants of that old Norse 
stock found in the Northwest. He 
said: "Your fathers and mothers 
located on these little farms; they 
built their cabins, they opened up 
and made prosperous the land they 
had adopted as their home. What 
are you, their descendants, doing 
in connection with this matter? 
Are you better citizens, more sturdy 
and true than your fathers and 
mothers were? Have you fulfilled 
and are you fulfilling your part in 
the citizenship of this land with the 
same industry, the same persever- 



ance and the same determination 
that characterized them?" This 
was the question put by the Chief 
Executive of our nation to the de- 
scendants of those people who had 
come from another land. It is a 
question that well might be asked! 
of the descendants of the French 
Huguenots, and the descendants of 
those who fled from the oppressions 
and tribulations of England, or 
other parts of the earth, and found 
a home under this flag we love. It 
is a question that I might ask the 
boys and girls of the Latter-day 
Saints today. For, while the Norse- 
men in coming from the old world 
to establish homes in the North- 
west were led under the inspiration 
of a spirit and desire for greater 
liberty, and for better opportuni- 
ties than could possibly be found 
in fatherland, such was not alto- 
gether the inspiration that led your 
parents to adopt this flag of ours 
and decide to live beneath its folds. 
To them this was God's own land — 
the land of Zion. It was their hope 
and ambition that upon this soil no 
tongue would wag to their hurt; 
that they would be secure here in 
every human right, so long as they 
interfered not with the rights and 
liberties of others. They loved it as 
a land of liberty, and desired its 
citizenship. They loved the pros- 
pects of the latter-day Zion, and 
looked to it as the only place where 
the great work they had become as- 
sociated with, looking to the bless- 
ing of our heavenly Father's chil- 
dren, could be fully accomplished. 
Their ideals were ideals of honor; 
their course of conduct in keeping 
with the highest moral principles. 
No matter what the world may say 
or think, your father and mine, 
when they planted their feet upon 
the soil of the United States, adopt- 
ed this nation as their own, and the 



24 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



land as the Zion of God, where the 
liberties of the human race were as- 
sured, where men could bow in 
reverence and respect to the Su- 
preme Being, and where no man 
need ask whether they prayed to 
liuddha, or to Christ Jesus, or to 
the Unknown God, or to a stick or 
stone. Here under the flag of this 
•country the great God of heaven 
had guaranteed, in the blood of the 
sons of the soil, the rights of lib- 
erty and conscience, and the priv- 
ilge to perform their duties and dis- 
charge their obligations unto Him. 

Young men and maidens, it is 
the joy of my heart that I can look 
back over the past and note from 
the record that my first ancestor 
upon the soil of the United States 
loved this country and loved liber- 
ty. It is the pride of my heart chat 
his descendants, as they have come 
down the line of citizenship, have 
stood upon that fair ground of lib- 
erty ; and one by one, as the con- 
ditions have arisen and the oppor- 
tunities have been theirs, they have 
maintained and stood by the prop- 
ositions involving human rights, 
showing that they would worship 
( lod and obey His commandments 
as they pleased, and not bow and 
cringe, or ask their fellows what 
they should believe. 

I believe in God the Eternal 
Father. 1 believe in His Son Jesus 
Christ as the Redeemer of the 
world. I believe in the doctrine of 
burial in the water as typical of the 
grave, and the coming forth to a 
newness of life. I believe in the 
baptism of fire and the Holy Ghost. 
I believe in the moral doctrines as 
presented by the Redeemer of the 
world. I believe in the keys and 
rights essential to the establish- 
ment, beyond the peradventure of a 
doubt, of the Father's children in 



His grace, and in the enjoyment of 
His gifts. I believe in the heaven- 
ly covenant, in the turning of the 
key of knowledge, in the announce- 
ment of the Patriarch of the past 
that he would turn the hearts of 
the fathers to the children and the 
hearts of the children to the fathers, 
that the earth might not be smitten 
with a curse. I believe in the ful- 
fillment of the prophecies. I be- 
lieve in the instance recently re- 
corded in the experience of this na- 
tion, when our sister city to the 
west of us was destroyed by earth- 
quake and flame, that it was a 
warning to the children of men. [ 
believe that when Valparaiso was 
shaken and many people lost their 
lives, it was the fulfillment of the 
Master's announcement to this peo- 
ple that, after their warning went 
forth to the world and the way of 
life was pointed out, if they re- 
jected the message, then He would 
teach the world lessons that they 
would remember. I trust that an 
awakening may come among our 
fellowmen everywhere, that they 
may love righteousness more than 
unrighteousness, justice more than 
injustice, morality more than- im- 
morality, charity and forbearance 
more than harshness and intoler- 
ance ; that they may seek to implant 
within themselves that which makes 
the noblest manhood and the purest 
womanhood to be found in all the 
world. T say to this body of peo- 
ple, without fear of successful con- 
tradiction, that the man who will 
obey God's law as revealed in this 
dispensation will stand before his 
Maker accepted ; while the men 
who become its arch-enemies and 
whose lives are devoted to its hurt 
will be condemned. Look into their 
inner lives and you will find writ- 
ten in their souls the blackness of

hell, the evidence of immorality, a 
rejoicing in the overthrow and de- 
struction of pure womanhood, 
while vaunting their love for the 
gentler sex. Oh ! I wish that ev- 
ery man in the world could say 
what I heard a Lutheran gentle- 
man once say to me in conversation 
with him. As he stood by his 
mother's side, impressed with the 
nature of true womanhood and the 
principles of faith, she extorted 
from him the pledge that under no 
circumstances would he dishonor 
one of her sex. O my Father, let 
it be written in the hearts of these 
mothers of ours that, as their sons 
shall go into the world to preach 
Christ and Him crucified, they shall 
go with the same admonition and 
prayer. No son of a Latter-day 
Saint should fail to have impressed 
upon his soul the feeling that wo- 
men should be sacred to him. They 
are in the likeness of their mothers, 
and motherhood should be esteemed 
and honored by every man. No 
girl is likely to be cast down in sin 
and crime, and have wrong written 
upon her brow, by a man whose 
mother had fully done her duty. 

Now, my brothers and my sis- 
ters, I am happy to be with you. 
Thank God for "Mormonism," as 
the world calls it. Thank the Lord 
for a father and a mother who be- 
lieved in the Redeemer of the 
world, and in the moral rules that 
purpose the best development of 
mankind. Thank Heaven for the 
faith that points out the possibili- 
ties of men and women standing in 
the presence of the Divine One, if 
they will be true to themselves and 
the laws Pie has revealed. Thank 
Heaven for a land where liberty 
exists, where the rights of men 
can be guarded. May we be pre- 
served from the attacks of the 



vicious and the impure. May just 
and honorable men, of all creeds 
and classes, be chosen as the gov- 
erning powers in the world, and be 
honored and esteemed in the dis- 
charge of the civic duties of life, 
that this land may be glorious in 
its development and growth ; and 
that the people of all lands who find 
a home here shall bow in respect 
and reverence, and regard with 
honor and esteem, the propositions 
involved in the Constitution which 
gives to them the right of con- 
science. 

May heaven's blessing attend 
you. The faith that has been de- 
livered to you has come from the 
Lord Himself. It was the Father 
and the Son that ushered in this 
dispensation of the fulness of times. 
It was the Father and the Son that 
turned the key of knowledge, the 
light of heaven let in on the human 
race. And the charge laid upon 
you was to see to it that in your 
homes this faith was taught, that 
at your own firesides the principles 
of morality should be fully estab- 
lished, that from those homes the 
sons and daughters who went forth 
should go as soldiers of the cross, 
without fear of the frowns or the 
favors of mankind, declaring the 
truth, pointing out the possibilities 
within the reach of every repentant 
sinner — that his sins mights be for- 
given, and that he should thereby 
be led to walk in the way that 
would bring him back into the pres- 
ence of his Maker. The Gospel, 
my brothers and sisters, is true in 
its entirety. May heaven bless you. 
May the spirit of cowardice, fear 
and trembling never come to you. 
May you stand up in the majesty of 
the cleanest, sweetest manhood, 
not blushing in the presence of youi 
mothers, sisters or wives, nor even

in the presence of the Lord, but be 
confident of His mercy. 

Again I say to you young men, 
be not afraid of the enemies of 
Zion, bow not in fear and trem- 
bling before any hand that may be 
raised. Accept the responsibilities 
that may be imposed upon you by 
the Divine Master, and preach His 
Gospel in the world. Stand for 
right, not only for your own house 
hold and those of your own faith, 
but see to it that the Catholic, the 
Jew, the Methodist, the Presbyter- 
ian, the atheist and the pagan shall 
enjoy that right of conscience 
which you yourself wish to enjoy, 
and that you with them shall stand 
up and maintain it with your lives, 
if necessary. May the spirit of 
heroism, faith, love, charity, for- 
bearance, kindness and considera- 
tion, without fear or trembling, 
characterize the lives of all of you, 
that wherever you go you may 
mingle among men as honorable 
men or women, understanding 
yourselves, resolved upon the main- 
tenance of purity of life, that the 
finger of God, if it should touch 
you, would not cause you to shrink 
with fear because of wrongdoing. 
May the Divine One bless our 
President with the health and 
strength necessary to the discharge 
of the arduous duties resting upon 
him, and his asociates also that their 
hearts may be united and that they 
may continue to hold the keys of 
the eternal Priesthood which the 
Lord himself has given them; and 
that the same noble manhood which 
characterized the men of the past 
may be theirs even to death itself, 
that the love of right may abide in 
them, that all needful blessings may 
come to them, as well as to you and 
to every right-thinking man and 



woman within the confines of thij. 
great Republic, and throughout the 
world. This is my prayer, in the 
name of Jesus. Amen. 



PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 

The reading of the hymn by 
Brother John Henry Smith brought 
to my mind another hymn, which is- 
something of a sermon in itself; 
and although I fear I am not as 
good a reader of hymns as he is, 1 
thought I would take the liberty of 
reading this one and commending it 
to the Latter-day Saints, that when 
they return home, if they are not 
familiar with it, they may turn to- 
their hymn books and read it welL 
You will find it in the Latter-day 
Saints hymn book, on page 434. 

Uphold the right, tho' fierce the fight, 

And pow'rful is the foe ; 
As freedom's friend, her cause defend,. 

Nor fear nor favor show. 
No coward can be called a man — ■ 

No friend will friends betray ; 
''Who would be free" alert must be ; 

Indifference will not pay. 



Note how they toil whose aim is spoil,. 

Who plundering plots devise ; 
Yet time will teach, that fools o'er- 
reach 

The mark and lose the prize. 
Can justice deign to wrong maintain, 

Whoever wills it so? 
Can honor mate with treach'rous hate? 

Can figs on thistles grow? 



Dare to be true, and hopeful, too ; 
Be watchful, brave and shrewd ; 

Weigh every act ; be wise, in fact, 
To serve the general good. 

Nor basely yield, nor quit a field- 
Important is the fray; 

Scorn to recede, there is no need 
To give our rights away. 



PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH.

Left-handed fraud let those applaud 

Who would by fraud prevail ; 
In freedom's name, contest their claim, 

Use no such word as fail; 
Honor we must each sacred trust, 

And rightful zeal display; 
Our part fulfil, then, come what will, 

High heaven will clear the way. 

The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn beginning: 



Our God, we raise to Thee, 
Thanks for Thy blessings free, 

We here enjoy; 
In this far western land, 
A true and chosen band, 
Led hither by Thy hand, 

We sing for joy. 

Benediction was pronounced by 
Elder Charles F. Middleton. 

Conference adjourned till Satur- 
day morning. 



SECOND DAY. 



Saturday, October 6, 10 a. m. 

Conference was called to order 
by President Joseph F. Smith. 

The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn : 

How firm a foundation, ye Saints of the 
Lord. 

Is laid for your faith in His excellent 
word ! 

What more can He say than to you He 
hath said. 

You who unto Jesus for refuge have 
(led ? 

Trayer was offered by Patriarch 
David McKay. 

The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn commencing : 

Praise to the man who communed 
with Jehovah ! 
Jesus anointed that Prophet and 
Seer — 

Blessed to open the last dispensation ; 
Kings shall extol him and nations 
revere. 



ELDER GEORGE TEASDALE. 

"A marvelous work and a wonder." — 
Integrity and heroism of the 19th cen- 
tury martyrs. — Possibility of commu- 
nion with Heaven. — Rewards for 
faithfulness. — "Who's on the Lord's 
side ?" 

In looking upon this vast congre- 
gation, my soul is filled with 
thanksgiving and praise to Al- 
mighty God that I have the priv- 
ilege of being numbered among 
you, my beloved brethren and sis- 
ters, — members of the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 
which He, in His wonderful provi- 
dence, has established upon the 
earth in these last days. 



I do not know that I can express 
the feelings of joy that are in my 
bosom occasioned by having this 
privilege of gazing upon the fea- 
tures of my beloved fellow labor- 
ers. I realize the truth of the say- 
ing- of the Apostle : "We know that 
we have passed from death unto 
life, because we love the brethren." 
J have an inexpressible affection 
for you, my brethren and sisters, es- 
pecially those who have been 
through the tribulations and diffi- 
culties that have been endured by 
so many of this people. After ovei 
fifty-three years experience in tins 
Church, J can solemnly bear my 
testimony that this work in which 
we are engaged is indeed the 
"marvelous ■ work and a wonder" 
that was spoken of by the prophet 
Isaiah in these words: "Forasmuch 
as this people draw near me with 
their mouth, and with their lips do 
honor me, but have removed their 
hearts far from me, and their fear 
toward me is taught by the precept 
of men ; therefore, behold I will 
proceed to do a marvelous work 
among this people, even a marvel- 
ous work and a wonder; for the 
wisdom of their wise men shall 
perish, and the understanding of 
their prudent men shall be hid." I 
bear my testimony that we are en- 
gaged in that wonderful work, that 
marvelous work. It has come to 
us in our individual lives and his- 
tory. Tt commenced with the 
Prophet Joseph and Oliver Cow- 
dery, the two first Apostles of this 
last dispensation. And now to see 
this vast congregation and to think 
of the numbers that are in the

world who have been brought into 
covenant with God, through the 
waters of baptism, to serve Him 
and keep His commandments, we 
realize what a glorious blessing this 
everlasting Gospel is to us individ- 
ually. The Lord has gathered us 
from the various nations where we 
were born; He sent the Gospel to 
us, and by His power we were con- 
verted. He brought us into His 
Church; He opened up the way for 
our gathering to Zion ; and He has 
taught us the principles of ever- 
lasting life. He gave us a living 
testimony ; and has sustained us by 
His matchless love. Individually 
we can say this, and praise the Lou! 
for His goodness unto the children 
of men. I thank God for the 
Prophet Joseph, and for the Patri- 
arch Hyrum. When I think of 
their integrity, their nobility of 
character, how true and faithful 
they were to the principles of eter- 
nal life, and how true to each other, 
I say in my heart : thank God for 
such men. In my mind's eye I cai: 
see the glorious benefits that have 
been brought to pass through these 
servants of God. They were filica 
with integrity, and although they 
preached an unpopular doctrine, 
were persecuted on every hand, 
were found fault with, ridiculed 
and derided, and were looked upon 
as deceivers of the people, yet the 
truth really is that God raised them 
up to usher in the dispensation of 
the fulness of times. I think of 
the time when they were cruelly 
martyred because of their love for 
God and the principles of eternal 
life. I think of them as their spirits 
left their bodies, clasped in each 
other's arms in the holy and pure 
affection of everlasting brother- 
hood. They attained the highest 
honor which man can secure in this 
life, for they had been true and 



faithful to God, and finally laici 
down their lives for their testimony, 
and hence was insured to them 
eternal life and happiness, even the 
highest degree of glory possible for' 
man to attain. They stood by ev- 
ery principle that the Lord had re- 
vealed from the Heavens, and were 
true and faithful at all times. But 
their murderers, what of them ? 
While they had exalted the mar- 
tyrs to an endless crown, they had 
consigned themselves to an ever- 
lasting hell, for they had shed the 
blood of innocence, for which there 
is no forgiveness. 

I am thankful that I have had 
the privilege of being acquainted 
with some of the prophets. I have 
enjoyed the acquaintance of Brig- 
ham Young. John Taylor, Wilfora 
Woodruff. Lorenzo Snow, and our 
present beloved President, Joseph 
F. Smith. 1 have had the privilege 
of being associated with these men, 
and I know most assuredly that 
they were and are men of God ; 
that they were chosen by the Lord 
before the foundation of the earth 
for the fulfilment of His purposes ; 
for known unto God arc all things 
from the beginning. He is doing 
His own work and accomplishing 
His own purposes in our redemp- 
tion. He has given us the privilege 
of worshiping Him according to- 
the. dictates of our conscience. Un- 
der the government established 
through the most glorious constitu- 
tion that was ever given to mortal 
man, we have the privilege and 
right to worship God according to- 
the dictates of our own conscience, 
allowing everyone else to do the 
same. 

I often think how highly I am fa- 
vored as an individual in being a 
member of the Church of Christ : 
that I am called by His name, and" 
that I have taken up my cross to-

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



work out my salvation, in connec- 
tion with those who are gathered 
together at this conference and 
throughout the world. I wish I 
'could express my feelings fully this 
morning, but it has not been given 
unto me to have power to express 
my gratitude to God for the school- 
ing and experience He has giver 
me since I was born in the flesh. I 
am deeply grateful for that school- 
ing and experience, for it has deliv- 
ered me from the enemy, it has 
given me eyes to see and ears to 
hear, and an understanding heart. 
I do know most assuredly that the 
promise of the Son of God is true, 
wherein He says : "He who will 
do the will of the Father shall 
know of the doctrine." I know of 
the doctrine, for the Lord has re- 
vealed it unto me, and I also know 
that when he said: "Ask and you 
shall receive, seek and ye shall find, 
knock and it shall be opened unto 
you" He declared true and correct 
principles. 

It is possible for us to commune 
with the Heavens. You who are 
faithful know that God lives, be- 
cause you have cbmmuned with 
Him ; you know that He hears your 
prayers and petitions; you know 
that He sustains you and that He 
•overrules things for your benefit. 
I prize this testimony because it has 
delivered me from the darkness that 
covers the earth, and the gross 
darkless that characterizes the 
minds of the people generally. Mv 
•eyes have been opened to see the 
glory of the principles of eternal 
life, and likewise to see the false- 
hood, the superstition and vain tra- 
ditions of man-made systems. Why 
I should have been chosen out of 
my father's house, and been per- 
mitted to enjoy the experiences and 
"blessings that have come to me, I 
•can hardly understand. I believe, 



however, that I am one of the de- 
scendants of the patriarchs of the 
house of Israel, unto whom prom- 
ises were made. A promise was 
given unto the ancient servants of 
God that the word of the Lord 
shall ever be given unto them and 
to their seed and their seed's seed. 
This promise is given unto all who 
are faithful in magnifying the Mel- 
chisedek and Aaronic Priesthoods. 
In the restoration of the Aaronic 
Priesthood we have the opportunity 
of magnifying our callings as Dea- 
cons, Teachers, Priests, Bishops, or 
Bishops' Counselors. In the res- 
toration of the higher Priesthood, 
we have the privilege of magnify- 
ing the Melchisedek Priesthood, as 
Elders. Seventies, High Priests, 
Patriarchs, or Apostles, as the case 
may be. This is what the Lord has 
done for us, and for all the world 
if they will accept of His doctrine 
as we have done. We have come 
out of the world, however, and ac- 
cepted the doctrine of the Father, 
and the efficacy of the precious 
blood of Christ ; we believe that the 
observance of these principles of 
the everlasting Gospel will sane- 
tifv us and give us fellowship with 
God. 

I am thankful that I have the 
privilege of being a member of the 
church of Christ. I live in a cer- 
tain ward and I am subject to my 
Bishop, like all other members of 
the ward ; and I trust that I am in 
good standing, in full fellowship. 
I realize that if I am in good stand- 
ing and full fellowship in the 
Church of Christ, T am entitled to 
certain privileges that those who 
are not in good standing do not 
have. If we are not,_then it is time 
that we repent and turn unto the 
Lord with full purpose of heart, 
and love Him, our Creator, with all 
our might, mind and strength. I

^understand there are two vital 
principles in the everlasting Gos- 
pel, one is faith and the other is 
love. I believe that if we will live 
up to the principles of the Gospel : i 
will increase and develop our af- 
fection, and that we will grow in 
grace, in "faith, and in the knowl- 
edge of God, whom to know is 
eternal life. Now all may attain to 
this. As a member of the Church 
I have this privilege, and if I ac- 
cept of His doctrine I belong to 
Him, and I will be one of the 
Lord's own because I have accept- 
ed His message. What is His 
message? His message to all the 
world is to worship the living and 
true God and Jesus Christ whom 
He has sent. We should repent 
and turn from the error of our 
ways, overcome our weaknesses, 
•cease to do evil and learn to do 
well. Then we have the privilege 
of baptism by immersion for the re- 
mission of sins, for the fulfilment 
of all righteousness, that we may 
"be born of the water; and having 
submitted to this principle we are 
sanctified through the precious 
"blood of Christ ; and having become 
thus sanctified our bodies are tem- 
ples for the Holy Ghost. It is a 
curious thing to me that the inhab- 
itants of the world reject these 
principles. Is there anything bet- 
ter under the Heavens? These 
principles, however, should be man- 
ifest in our faithfulness in perform- 
ing every duty devolving upon us. 
We should always attend our sac- 
rament meetings, our quorum 
meetings, etc. We should strive to 
work out our own salvation and, 
make our calling and election sure. 
That is how I understand it, and it 
seems to me that it is very simple. 
It is a straight and narrow path 
that leads to eternal life, and it is 
made plain to the comprehension 



of every son and daughter of God 
who desires to walk therein. The 
question is : Do we want these 
principles? Do we want the estab- 
lishment of righteousness on the 
earth? Do we want to be filled 
with the love of God ? Do we want 
to make a record that shall give us 
satisfaction when we have passed 
through this probationary stage? 

My beloved brethren and sisters, 
I rejoice in these principles be- 
cause I know they are true; they 
are simple and easy to be under- 
stood. The Lord has given us un- 
derstanding, and we hear from this 
pulpit the reason why we should 
love God and keep His command- 
ments is that we may attain to a 
glorious resurrection and eternal 
life; that when the Lord Jesus 
Christ shall appear we shall be 
prepared to meet Him, and asso- 
ciate with Him. I would say to my 
beloved brethren and sisters, let us 
repent of all our evil doing, and 
fault finding ; let us mind our own 
business ; let us seek to work out 
our own salvation ; let us be very 
careful of this precious soul that 
God is striving to redeem. He has 
given us our agency, and we can 
accept just what we please; if we 
choose to accept righteousness it is 
open for us ; if we choose to accept 
unrighteousness, we can do so. 
Now, my brethren and sisters, 
whose side are we on? You know 
we sing sometimes : "Who's on 
the Lord's side?" As a member of 
this Church I hope I am, and I 
hope I have sense enough to per- 
form my duty. • I hope to have the 
fellowship of the Spirit to instruct 
me, to show me what is necessary 
for me to do and accomplish in all 
the affairs of life, whether spiritual 
or temporal. 

There is to be a certain routine in 
which the Kingdom will be estab-

lished. We are preaching the Gos- 
pel of the Kingdom, and preparing 
the people for the coming of the 
Lord Jesus Christ, our glorious 
King in Zion. I hope that, during 
the few remaining years I have to 
live to fill up the daws of my pro- 
bation, that I may possess the same 
Spirit and blessings 1 have enjoyed 
ever since I embraced this Gospel. 
The Lord has blessed me, and filled 
my soul with unspeakable joy. He 
has blessed me in the opportunities 
that I have of being associated with 
the highest order of intelligences 
that dwell upon His footstool, men 
who are devoted to the establish- 
ment of His Kingdom on the 
earth. The Lord knows their 
hearts, and He will bless and pro- 
tect them. He has set His hand to 
establish His Church and Kingdom 
upon the earth, and He is going to 
do it. His work is rolling on in its 
majesty, accomplishing the pur- 
poses for which it was instituted, 
and it will continue to do so until 
the wicked are overthrown, and the 
righteous shall dwell upon the earth 
in that glorious Millennium of a 
thousand years. Amen. 

ELDER RTIDGER CLAWSON. 

Utah fulfills the prophecy of Isaiah. — 
A striking example of transformation. 
— Zion will continue to flourish. — The 
Lord's favored people should lie 
faithful. 

Brethren and Sisters : T desire to 
make myself heard by this large 
congregation and to increase the 
volume of my voice, possibly, as I 
progress in my remarks. 

Are we not a blessed people, and 
is there any member of the Church 
that is so blind as not to be able to 
recognize the providences of the 
Lord in His hand-dealing with this 



people ? What do we witness this 
morning? Why, the hosts of Israel 
have come up to worship the Lord. 
For this purpose they have come 
from the most distant corners and 
recesses of Zion, — that beautiful 
Zion of which we have heard dur- 
ing this conference, and of which 
we hear at all our conferences. 
You will remember, brethren and 
sisters, that Isaiah, that mighty 
prophet of Israel, looking down 
through the centuries twenty-six 
hundred years, makes use of lan- 
guage something like this: (speak- 
ing of Zion) "And the wilderness 
and the solitary place shall be glad 
for them ; and the desert shall re- 
joice, and blossom as the rose. It 
shall blossom abundantly, and re- 
joice even with joy and singing. . . 
for in the wilderness shall waters 
break out, and streams in the des- 
ert; and the parched ground shall 
become a pool, and the thirsty land 
springs of water." Speaking of the 
same thing in a little different lan- 
guage, he says: "For the Lord 
shall comfort Zion ; He will com- 
fort her waste places ; and he will 
make her vvilderness like Eden, and 
her desert like the garden of the 
Lord ; joy and gladness shall be 
found therein, thanksgiving and the 
voice of melody." Now, I submit 
that anybody who is looking for 
Zion must expect to find at least 
two very essential features : first, 
he must look for a wilderness and a 
solitary place, which shall after- 
wards become like the garden of 
Eden, and shall blossom as the 
rose. Tn the year 1847, a small 
band of pilgrims, headed by Brig- 
ham Young and consisting of 143. 
men, three women, and two chil- 
dren, entered the Salt Lake valley. 
They stood at that time upon the 
soil of Mexico, but they took pos- 
session of the country for and ill

the name of the United States ; and 
later the "Stars and Stripes" were 
unfurled upon Ensign Peak, as an 
expression of their loyalty to the 
government, notwithstanding the 
fact that they had recently been 
driven out of three states of the re- 
public, by mobs inspired by the 
spirit of persecution. This land 
was designated as the land of 
Zion, and as they increased in num- 
bers and spread out over the lana, 
it was divided into ecclesiastical dis- 
tricts, which were called '"Stakes of 
Zion," but the great central stake 
of Zion was located in the Salt 
Lake Valley, including Salt Lake 
City, and was known as Salt Lake 
Stake for many years, but after- 
wards it was divided into other 
stakes — into four great central 
stakes of Zion: the Salt Lake, En- 
sign, Liberty, and Pioneer stakes, — 
all very suggestive names. As the 
people grew stronger in population 
and branched out, the number of 
stakes increased until at present 
there are fifty-five stakes of Zion. 
One member of that little band of 
pioneers wrote his impressions of 
the surrounding country at thai 
time, and he used language some- 
thing like this: "The first impres- 
sions of the Salt Lake valley were 
very disheartening, and but foi two 
or three cotton-wood trees, not a 
green thing was in sight, and there 
was nothing to vary the s'-cnery 
except rugged mountains, the sage 
brush and the sunflower." Me fur- 
ther states that the whole country 
was covered with millions of black 
crickets which the Indians were 
gathering and harvesting for their 
winter food. Here was a fea^t of 
fat things, but it was a feast of 
crickets for the Indians, nothing 
whatever for the Pioneers. And as 
it was in the Salt Lake valley so it 
was in all this mountain country. 



Perhaps I can give you an exam- 
ple : Away back in the year 185 1, 
a few people settled on Box Kider 
creek, a little stream of water that 
came out of the mountains and 
threaded its way through the can- 
yon down into the valleys. The 
soil, it was said, was of the poorest 
quality. 

There were two or three spots of 
meadow and farming land which by 
irrigation could be made to yield a 
fair crop but otherwise it was a 
desert place. Two years later an- 
other site was laid out at Box 
Elder, under the direction of Apos- 
tle Lorenzo Snow, who went there 
with about fifty families, and the 
new town as laid out was after- 
wards known as Brigham City, 
named after the great Prophet and 
pioneer of this people. Now, when 
the new colony came in, the older 
colonists were very much disturbed 
in their feelings, claiming that 
there was not sufficient water there 
to furnish the new-comers, and that 
they would go short; and so there 
was some dissatisfaction and some 
discontent and complaint upon this 
score. That was about fifty-five 
vears ag;o. An effort was made at 
once to establish orchards at Brig- 
ham City, but it was a failure. They 
planted the peach tree, but it would 
not grow ; the early and late frosts 
came and cut it down, their fruit 
trees were destroyed. But how 
changed is the scene after fifty-five 
years. Today that city and the sur- 
rounding country is covered with 
orchards and beautiful farms, sus- 
taining in the city a population of 
about seven hundred families or 
3,500 souls. 

Let me give you an idea, my 
brethren and sisters, of what was 
accomplished during the past sea- 
son in Brigham City; and when I 
speak of Brigham City I speak of

other places — other cities and set- 
tlements of the Saints in the moun- 
tains, this is only a sample you 
might say. There was shipped out 
of Brigham City, during the past 
summer, small fruit, such as straw- 
berries, raspberries, dewberries, 
etc., amounting to about $50,000. 
There were shipped 95 full carloads 
of peaches ; and then there were 
sold, in small orders, at least ten 
carloads of peaches, making 105 
carloads, representing 140 thou- 
sand cases of peaches shipped from 
that little town to large cities of 
the East, to Minneapolis, Chicago, 
New York, and Boston ; to Winni- 
peg, Canada, on the North, and to 
many cities in the South. As many 
as fifteen carloads of peaches were 
shipped out in one clay. This you 
can readily see would furnish work 
as well as revenue for the people of 
the city. They realized about $50,- 
000 for their peaches, making 
$100,000 for their crops of fruit. 
There were about one hundred chil- 
dren, between the ages of fouiteen 
and sixteen, employed to wiap the 
peaches for shipment. The peaches 
were put up sixty in a box, and 
they were paid one cent a box ioi 
wrapping. These children earned 
on an average $1 a day. One little 
fellow, fourteen years of age, 
wrapped 240 boxes in a single day, 
earning $2.40, and wrapping some- 
thing like 14,400 peaches. Thus 
employment was furnished not only 
to the growers and shippers, but 
also to the little children of the peo- 
ple who' were employed and their 
time was well paid for. Altogether, 
the children of Brigham City 
earned, during the short season of 
gathering and shipping fruit, some- 
thing like $1,200.00, which of 
course is a very creditable show- 
ing. 

And all this, brethren and sis- 



ters, in fulfilment of prophecy. 
Are not the words of Isaiah ful- 
filled literally? Did not that baud 
of pioneers find a "wilderness" and 
a "solitary place?" and later on, as 
the years rolled by, did not ti.is 
wilderness blossom as the rose? 
Take Salt Lake City and the Salt 
Lake valley, Provo and the Utah 
valley, Ogden and the Weber val- 
ley, Logan and the Cache valley, 
and Brigham City and the Bear 
River valley. Are not these places 
like Eden ? Are they not fruitful 
as the garden of the Lord? Again, 
think of Davis County. Is it not 
the very garden spot of the world? 
Is there any soil anywhere that pro- 
duces more abundantly and richly 
than the soil of our neighboring 
county? And never upon Mother 
Earth has there been raised and 
matured such beautiful, such lus- 
cious fruit as will be found oti ex - 
hibition today at the Davis County 
Eair, — this verv day! At the liti- 
gation Congress which was held at 
Boise, when the fruits of Utah, 
Idaho, Washington, and oilier 
western states, were brought into 
competition, the fruits from Utah, 
the fruits of Zion, took the first 
prize and justly so. 

Brethren and sisters, Zion is 
here and Zion will continue to 
stand. No power under Heaven 
will overthrow this mighty work ; 
it may not be, it cannot be. Think 
of the wonderful progress of this 
work; Joseph Smith, the piophet, 
who organized the church, presid- 
ed over a few thousand souls. 
Think of it. In his lifetime he pre- 
sided over a few thousand while 
today our present leader, Presi- 
dent Joseph F. Smith, presides 
over about 400,000, who are scat- 
tered over the waste places of Zion, 
which waste places have become a 
fruitful garden, and are blossom-

ing as the rose. My brethren and 
sisters, since the Lord has so great- 
ly and abundantly blessed us, and 
since we can recognize the fulfil 
ment of prophecies to the very let- 
ter, concerning this latter-day work, 
shall we not be faithful ? Shall we 
not honor the Lord, and remember 
our covenants that we have made 
with Him ? Shall we not pay our 
tithes and offerings, and remember 
our prayers ? Shall we not remem- 
ber the Word of Wisdom which 
has been given for our deliverance 
and for our escape from many 
evils? Shall we not stand together 
as one united band, honoring the 
Lord and keeping His command- 
ments? Shall we not be true to 
Him and true to every righteous 
cause upon the earth? And, in the 
words of Isaiah, shall we not 
"cease to do evil ; learn to do well ; 
seek judgment, relieve the op- 
pressed, judge the fatherless, 
plead for the widow ?" Shall we 
not seek to establish justice in the 
earth, and be charitable to the 
widows and fatherless? Shall we 
not maintain just and righteous 
laws, and uphold and support and 
sustain righteous and good men in 
our midst ? 

We stand for Zion ; we stand for 
the cause of righteousness. May 
the Lord bless us and guide us , 
may His spirit abound in out- 
hearts, and may it be poured out 
abundantly upon the congregations 
of Israel, is my prayer in the name 
of Jesus, Amen.

My dear brethren and sisters : 
The feeling that is in my heart at 
the present time I fear I cannot ex- 
press to you just as I would like to 
do. I have partaken of the spirit 
of this conference; I have enjoyed 
every word that has been uttered ; 
I endorse the testimonies of the 
faithful brothers who have spoken ; 
and I hope and trust that the same 
spirit may guide my remarks that 
attended them. 

"I am not ashamed of the Gospel 
of the Lord Jesus Christ, for it is 
the power of God unto salvation." 
I am not ashamed of my brethren 
and sisters, and I am proud of the 
achievements of this people in the 
past, in establishing themselves here 
and building up this common- 
wealth. I am not ashamed of my 
country, nor her institutions, and I 
love the Stars and Stripes. I am 
not ashamed of dear Utah, nor of 
Salt Lake City. I am not ashamed, 
of the principles that have been re- 
vealed by God to His people in this 
dispensation. I hope and trust 
that so long as I have breath I 
never shall do aught to bring re- 
proach either upon the people of 
God or the state in which I was 
born. While I acknowledge that 
my first duty is to God, I also ac- 
knowledge that my allegiance and 
duty to my country and to my 
State is paramount over all earthly 
affairs. I wish to say that my 
duty to God, my love for Him, does 
not conflict with my love for and 
duty to my country. It does not 
conflict with the love I have for the 
brethren here ; nor with the love 
that is in my heart for the people 
of God. It only gives me greater 
power, strength, and a desire to 
love all mankind. I have no desire

in my heart other than to do the 
will of God, keep His command- 
ments, uphold, and sustain my 
country and her institutions. 

My brethren and sisters, it seems 
to me that this is a time when we 
should place our homes in order. 
We cannot, by public speaking, al- 
ways reach the boys and girls. 
Those who preach and teach in the 
Sunday School, in the wards and 
stakes, or even at the general con- 
ferences, reach but a limited num- 
ber of them ; and I plead with you, 
you fathers and mothers who are 
here, to watch closely the children 
God has given you. Commence at 
home and be yourselves their in- 
structors. You have a power over 
your children for good, I hope. I 
assure you that if you do not teach 
your children properly yourselves, 
others will teach them, and more 
than likely it will be by an influence 
that will bring sorrow to them and 
disgrace to you. 

In the early history o"f the 
Church, when it had been organ- 
ized scarcely two years, God gave 
a revelation to His prophet Joseph 
Smith, to which I desire to call 
special attention. It was given to 
the Latter-day Saints, and is com- 
monly known as the Word of Wis- 
dom. It has been referred to here 
by Brothers Lyman and Clawson, 
and I wish to add some comments 
on the same subject. It is a simple 
law, revealed for the temporal wel- 
fare of the people, given for the 
weakest as well as the strongest of 
God's children. I want to read it 
to the people here today, and then 
perhaps submit some remarks. It 
is found in Section 89 of the Doc- 
trine and Covenants : 

"A Word of Wisdom for the benefit 
of the Council of High Priests, assem- 
bled in Kirtland, and Church ; and also 
the saints in Zion. To be sent greeting 



— not by commandment or constraint- 
but by revelation and the word of 
wisdom, showing forth the order ancE 
will of God in the temporal salvation; 
of all saints in the last days. 

"Given for a principle with promise,, 
adapted to the capacity of the weak 
and the weakest of all saints, who are 
or can be called saints. 

"Behold verily, thus saith the Lord 
unto you, in consequence of evils and 
designs which do and will exist in the- 
hearts of conspiring men in the last 
days, I have warned you, and forewarn 
you, by giving unto you this \vord of 
wisdom by revelation. 

"That inasmuch as any man drinketli 
wine or strong drink among you, be- 
hold it is not good, neither meet in the 
sight of your Father, only in assem- 
bling yourselves together to offer up 
your sacraments before Him. 

"And behold, this should be wine, 
yea, pure wine of the grape of the- 
vine, of your own make. 

"And again, strong drinks are not for 
the belly, but for the washing of your 
bodies. 

"And again, tobacco is not for the 
body, neither for the belly, and is not 
good for man, but is an herb for 
bruises and all sick cattle, to be used 
with judgment and skill. 

"And again, hot drinks are not for 
the body or belly. 

"And again, verily I say unto you, alt' 
wholesome herbs God hath ordained for 
the constitution, nature, and use of man. 

"Every herb in the season thereof , 
and every fruit in the season thereof ; 
all these to be used with prudence and 
thanksgiving. 

"Yea, flesh also of beasts and of the 
fowls of the air, I, the Lord, have or- 
dained for the use of man with thanks- 
giving; nevertheless they are to be used' 
sparingly. 

"And it is pleasing unto me that thcy~ 
should not be used only in times of win- 
ter, or of cold, or famine. 

"All grain is ordained for the use of 
man and of beasts, to be the staff of 
life, not only for man, but for the 
beasts of the field, and the fowls of 
heaven, and for wild animals that run 
or creep on the earth. 

"And these hath God made for the- 
use of man only in times of famine and 
excess of hunger. 

"All grain is good for the food of 
man, as also the fruit of the vine, that 
which yieldeth fruit, whether in the 
ground or above the ground. 



ELDER REED SMOOT.

"Nevertheless, wheat for man, and 
•corn for the ox, and oats for the horse, 
.and rye for the fowls and for swine, 
.and for all beasts of the field, and bar- 
ley for all useful animals, and for 
mild drinks, as also other grain. 

"And all saints who remember to 
keep and do these sayings, walking in 
■obedience to the commandments, shall 
receive health in their navel, and mar- 
row in their bones. 

"And shall find wisdom and great 
treasures of knowledge, even hidden 
treasures ; 

"And shall run and not be weary, and 
shall walk and not faint; 

"And I, the Lord, give unto them a 
promise, that the destroying angel 
shall nass by them, as the children of 
Israel, and not slay them. Amen." 

My brethren and sisters, I have 
been traveling in many parts of 
our state during- the last few 
months, and I have listened to re- 
ports made at our quarterly con- 
ferences that indicate to me that 
this simple law, which was given as 
a means of temporal salvation to 
the people — for the very weakest 
of the saints — is certainly not be- 
ing obeyed as fully as it should be. 
It is reported that some of the 
men in our communities indulge in 
smoking and drinking. If a man 
visits saloons, how can he expect 
to exert an influence that will keep 
boys, who may be a little wayward 
perhaps, from such places. I think 
it is very foolish indeed, and shows 
great weakness of character, for 
men to say that they are induced 
to go to those degrading places ; 
men generally go where thev want 
to, and where they feel at home. 
If a man wants to attend confer- 
ence and has a desire in his heart 
to do so, he generally finds some 
way to accomplish it, and attends 
because he feels that it is the prop- 
ter place; the instructions and in- 
fluences are what he enjoys. On 
the other hand, a man who goes to 
a saloon and spends any of the 



means God has provided him with 
for the support of his wife and 
children, wrongs himself and 
them. The man who follows such 
a course cannot retain the confi- 
dence and respect of the people. 

My brethren and sisters, I hope 
and trust that every one of you 
will watch over the children that 
God has given you, teach them to 
love their home. Make it truly a 
home and not simply a stopping 
place, and see that the influence 
therein is such that your children 
would rather spend their leisure 
time at home than anywhere else 
on earth. Make it so pleasant that 
their companions are anxious to 
come there, because when they do 
come they feel an influence of love 
and peace, and consequently have 
a desire to return and associate 
with the children who live in such 
agreeable surroundings. 

Teach your children how to 
pray, and urge them to never neg- 
lect their prayers. Teach them 
to be kind and considerate. Find 
out whether or not they are truth- 
ful, and if they are trying to live 
according to the laws of God. It 
is difficult for the mother or father 
to do these things unless they 
themselves are living up to the 
principles they advocate. There- 
fore, my brethren and sisters, I 
pray you that you will begin im- 
mediately — if have not done 
so in the past — to exert such an 
influence over your children, and 
all the youth of Zion, that they 
will become honorable, truthful 
and God-fearing men and women. 

While attending a conference in 
Box Elder County.the other day, 
I heard a report from one of the 
bishops that gave me a great deal 
of joy, and I heard a similar report 
in one of our southern counties. It 
was this : that not a boy between 



38 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



the ages of twelve and twenty-one 
used tobacco or liquor in any form. 
I would to God that such a report 
could be made concerning every 
boy and man in every ward in all 
the Church ! 

I had a man come to me, the 
other day, and complain of how 
hard it was for him to maintain his 
family. When Brother Clawson 
was speaking of the bounteous har- 
vest in Box Elder County, I did not 
know but we would all feel like 
moving to Brigham City, to share 
in the wonderful prosperity attendr 
ing the people there. Brigham 
City is only one of the many pros- 
perous communities in the State. 
The other night, going home on 
the train, I met the man who sup- 
plies boxes for the packing of 
fruit, and I did not realize, until 
then, that Provo was shipping more 
fruit than Brigham City. He told 
me he had just sold four car-loads 
of boxes, making a total of twen- 
ty-five car-loads for Provo alone. I 
asked him how many car-loads of 
fruit is represented by a car-load 
of boxes, and he said ten, which 
would make 250 car-loads of fruit 
shipped from that point alone. 
Again, in the same County, nearly 
one hundred thousand tons of 
beets are ready to be harvested and 
shipped to the sugar factory. Most 
of these great productions of or- 
chard and farm are raised by the 
people and the children of the Lat- 
ter-day Saints. As I thought of these 
conditions, I could not understand 
how it was that this man, whom 
I mentioned first, could complain 
that it was hard for him to get 
along. Why, there is work on all 
sides. But, I soon learned the rea- 
son of his difficultv in supporting 
his family ; and I said to him : 
"John, you will never get along 
while you spend the time and 



money that you do in sucking ci- 
garettes," for this was his pas- 
time, from morning until night. I 
asked him how much he smoked 
each day. He said he smoked a 
number of cigarettes, not mention- 
ing the number, and a few cigars, 
and told me it cost him twenty-five 
cents each day. Here was a poor 
man smoking, and wasting the 
money that should go to provide 
for his family ; aye, worse, he was 
also wasting and weakening his 
Dhvsical strength. f advised him 
to stop smoking, and take that 25 
cents daily and use it for the ben- 
efit of his wife and children. Twen- 
ty-five cents a day means $1.75 a 
week, enough to buy a pair of 
* shoes for a child each week in the 
year. I went on and figured with 
him what it would amount to each 
year if he would save it, and what 
the interest would be, and how 
easy it would be for him, or any- 
one else, while the prosperous times 
are on, to put a little monev away 
for a rainy day. 

T want every Latter-day Saint 
to own and keep his home. If 
you have no home, get one ; have a 
roof over your head, and then don't 
mortgage it ; don't sell it. You 
brethren who live in the southern 
section of the State, where there 
are large tracts of arid land unap- 
propriated — called the waste lands 
of the State — secure what you can 
of this land. If you own a farm 
of this character now, hold it ; the 
time will come when the granary 
of our State will be in locations 
now uncultivated. Today dry 
farming is only just begun. What 
was the condition, a few years ago, 
in Juab county. I see Brother 
Grace of Nephi before me ; ask 
him what success he has had with 
dry farming. There is no one in 
Juab County today but would say 



ELDER REED SMOOT. 



39 



that God has blessed them, and 
blessed that soil ; yet it was only a 
few years ago that the people were 
trying to get away from there. 
They wanted to sell their homes be- 
cause there were not sufficient ir- 
rigated farming lands to sustain 
them and their families ; but today 
what do we find? Fields of hun- 
dreds of acres of the very choicest 
kinds of grain, yielding last year — 
one of the dryest seasons — 35 bush- 
els to the acre, and this year al- 
most the same amount, all grown 
on dry farm land. Scientific dry 
farming, with the different modes 
of properly treating the soil, #nd 
the various processes that are be- 
ing adopted, will make the waste 
places of today blossom and bring 
forth grain to feed the people of 
this State hereafter. Now, breth- 
ren, I want you to go home and 
tell your people to hold their land. 
Don't sell your inheritance in Zion. 

I wish to say that while the good 
times are here, and men can obtain 
good wages, save some of your 
earnings ; for good times are like 
the ebb and flow of the ocean — they 
come and go. You mark my word, 
just as sure as the Lord lives there 
will be a change, and f hope and 
trust that the people of the Latter- 
day Saints will be prepared for the 
change when it comes. Prosper- 
ous times are when the foundation 
of failures are laid. During' pros- 
perous times men reach out fur- 
ther than they ought to ; they go 
beyond safe investments, and bor- 
row money for all kinds of wild- 
cat ventures. I say to you, now 
that money is plentiful, and your 
credit is so good that you can bor- 
row money on your own signature, 
or with the signature of a friend 
added, f hope and trust you will 
use judgment and not go beyond 
your ability to pay. Keep out of 



debt. Don't go into debt at all, 
unless you have absolute security 
back of it, and unless it is for the 
purpose of controlling some land 
purchase, or some business that 
you know you are absolutely safe 
in going into. I wanted to say 
that much, my brethren and sisters, 
in relation to debt. I desire to say 
also that one very good way to 
save and keep out of debt — for the 
Latter-day Saints at least — is to 
obey that simple law of God before 
alluded to, the Word of Wisdom. 

I have been reading lately some 
statistics showing the amount of to- 
bacco, cigars, and liquors of all 
kinds, that came into this State 
last year, and I was dumbfounded 
to note the amount. I have not 
the time this morning to read them 
to you ; but think of fifty carloads 
of tobacco coming into the State of 
Utah in one year ! Of course, the 
great bulk of it is consumed by 
other people ; but I hope and trust 
that I may live to see the day when 
it will all be consumed by others 
than the Latter-day Saints. I have 
heard men say : "Well, it doesn't 
hurt me to smoke, and I have 
plenty of money to pay for it." 
There is not a man in the world 
that ever did use it who was not 
hurt physically, and, do you know, 
I have an idea that it weakens a 
man morally. Yield to the viola- 
tion of this simple law, and it will 
be easier to yield to the violation 
of other laws. The first step tak- 
en in the path of error is not gen- 
erally serious, and is commonly 
called folly; but if you take the 
first steps, you are liable to go far- 
ther and be overtaken in greater 
wrongs. That is not all, think of 
the example you set. Even if you 
have no children yourselves, you 
should not set a bad example be- 
fore the children of the Latter-day 



40 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Saints. I ask of you, my brethren 
and sisters, to think of this, study 
it. 

Now, my brethren and sisters, 
I pray you to guard and teach your 
children, and while all the influ- 
ences from the outside are trying to 
■win them away from the Gospel of 
Jesus Christ, let your loving care 
and example be exercised to keep 
them steadfast in the faith. There 
are men whose hearts are filled 
with hatred, who try to influence 
our children, and embitter them 
against the leaders of the Church. 
If they are successful in getting 
even a doubt implanted in their 
minds, if you fathers and moth- 
ers do not bring an influence to 
bear that will overcome it, it will 
bring sorrow to you and a spirit- 
ual death and sorrow to them. But, 
I have faith in the children of the 
Latter-day Saints ; in the boys and 
girls who have been born under the 
everlasting covenant. I feel con- 
fident they will tread the path that 
has been followed by their fathers 
and their mothers. I love the fath- 
er and mother that gave me life, 
and I marvel at times at the sacri- 
fices they made for the sake of the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ. I pray God 
that He will give me strength, and 
that He will give every boy and 
girl, born of mothers and fathers 
who have been true and loyal mem- 
bers of the Church, the strength 
to stand nobly by them and by the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ, and I have 
faith that they will do so. If you 
will call the attention of your 
boys and girls to the character of 
the men who are sustained as the 
authorities of this Church, how 
they live, what their aims are, and 
the love they have for mankind, 
and then direct their attention to 
the lives of those who are trying 
to bring disgrace upon this people, 



they cannot help but note the con- 
trast I know that if our young 
people were informed of the true 
character and lives of many of 
those who are striving to tear 
down this work, they would not 
follow them. It seems to be the 
rule that, when a man becomes 
immoral and corrupt, he also be- 
comes a bitter enemy of the 
Church, and the lower he gets the 
more bitterness he develops. 

My brethren and sisters, let us 
be loyal and true to the covenants 
we have made with God, and to His 
Church. Let us uphold and sus- 
tain the men who preside over the 
Church, and be loyal and true to 
them. In like manner let us be 
loyal and true to our State, and her 
interests, to our country and its in- 
stitutions, and, above all, to God 
who gave us life; it is He whose 
hand is steadying the ark of Zion. 
God bless you, in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 

The choir and congregation sang, 

We thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet, 
To guide us in these latter days ; 

We thank Thee for sending the Gospel 
To lighten our minds with its rays. 

Benediction was pronounced by 
Elder Lewis W. Shurtliff, and con- 
ference adjourned till 2 p. m. 

AFTERNOON SESSION. 

The meeting was called to order 
at 2 o'clock. 

The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn beginning : 

Now let us rejoice in the day of salva- 
tion ; 

No longer as strangers on earth need 
we roam, 

Good tidings are sounding to us and 
each nation, 
And shortly the hour of redemption 
will come.

Prayer was offered by Patriarch 
SLorin Farr. 

The choir and congregation sang, 

•Come, let us anew our journey pur- 
sue, 

Roll round with the year, 
And never stand still till the Master 
appear. 

His adorable will, let us gladly fulfil, 

And our talents improve, 
iBy the patience of hope and the labor 
of love.

The Ten Commandments applicable to 
the Latter-day Saints. 

I am under considerable anxi- 
ety this afternoon in regard to what 
I shall be led to say, as there ap- 
pears to be, on the part of some, a 
fear that I might say something not 
•entirely complimentary to the tra- 
ducers of the brethren and of our 
people. But I desire to be conserva- 
tive, if possible, and in order to 
be so I will read a little scripture, 
judging that by reading the scrip- 
tures no one will take offense; and 
I will endeavor to studiously avoid 
reading the 23rd chapter of Mat- 
thew. I was reading a little while 
ago a story which contained a cer- 
tain sentence put, by the author, in- 
to the mouth of one of the charac- 
ters of the story, by which it would 
seem he endeavored to justify him- 
self in wrongdoing. The sentence 
was as follows : "Everybody 
knows the Ten Commandments, 
"but nobody keeps them." Now, 
that sentence impressed me with 
considerable force, and I could not 
instantly dismiss it. I thought 
■over it considerably, and I won- 
dered in my heart how true it was, 
or if it were true, at all or not. The 
more I thought of it the more I 
'.became convinced that, if it were 



not true, still it approached very 
nearly to being the truth; and I 
have in mind this afternoon to 
read the Ten Commandments, as 
delivered by the Lord to Moses, in 
the mountain, and which were writ- 
ten by the Lord upon the tablets 
of stone : 

"Thou shalt have no other gods 
before me." I reviewed that com- 
mandment and applied it to the 
Latter-day Saints. I felt in my 
heart that most of the Latter-day 
Saints kept that commandment ; 
that there were no other gods that 
the Latter-day Saints worshiped, 
but that they worshiped the true 
and the living God, the God of 
Abraham, of Isaac; and Jacob — 
the Creator of the heavens and 
the earth, and all things that in 
them are. We, as Latterday 
Saints, worship God, and we have 
no other god , ; if we worship at all, 
it is our p£.;r.. " in Heaven whom 
we worship. 

"Thou shalt not make unto thee 
any graven image or any likeness 
of anything that is in the heaven 
above, or that is in the earth be- 
neath, or that is in the water un- 
der the earth." That also, I am 
constrained to believe, is a com- 
mandment kept by the Latter-day 
Saints. They have not bowed 
down to other gods ; they have 
not raised up to themselves 
gods of stone or of brass ; 
they have not worshiped any- 
thing in the heavens or in the 
earth, or which is under the earth ; 
but this same God, the Father of 
our spirits, do we worship, and 
none other. I believe we are not 
guilty of the charge of not keep- 
ing this comandment. "Thou shalt 
not bow down thyself to them, nor 
serve them ; for I the Lord thy 
God, am a jealous God, visiting 
the iniquity of the fathers upon the 



42 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



children unto the third and fourth 
generation of them that hate me, 
and showing mercy unto thousands 
of them that love me, and keep my 
commandments." The Lord has 
manifested Himself very plainly to 
the Latter-day Saints, [n our day 
He has manifested Himself in per- 
son, in as great or greater plain- 
ness than He was manifest to 
Moses in the mountain, during the 
time that these commandments 
were given ; and therefore we know 
Him. We have received His Spirit ; 
we have become acquainted with 
some of His works and also with 
some of His purposes concerning 
us, and concerning all men who 
have inhabited this earth, as well as 
those who now inhabit it or shall 
do so in the future. Him do we 
worship, and we love Him ; and 
here we might couple that other 
commandment, or that emphasis 
of this comandment, which was 
given by the Lord Jesus Christ, 
when He was asked which was the 
greatest commandment, and He 
replied that we should love the 
Lord with all our might, mind, and 
strength, for that was the great- 
est commandment. I believe as a 
general thing the Latter-day 
Saints observe this law, that they 
do love the Lord with all their 
might, mind, and strength ; yet I 
know there are some who do not 
love Him as fully as they should. 
A man who spends nine-tenths of 
his working time, striving to ac- 
cumulate wealth, to store up and 
hoard money, and spends but little 
of his time in worshiping the true 
and living God, does not give full 
evidence that he loves the Lord, 
first and foremost, but he does ev- 
idence that his love is devoted, to 
a greater extent, to the material 
wealth and accumulations he is 
striving to gain, which are perish- 



ing things. Such individuals have 
learned to worship other gods, I 
fear — the god of gold, the god of 
money — at least they have grown 
to forget, in a great degree, the 
Father of all. In their craving af- 
ter the things of this world, they 
overlook the things of eternal 
worth. Brethren and sisters, I hope 
very few of us belong to that 
class, hive minutes prayer a day, 
and all the rest of our thoughts 
centered on the things of the world 
is not what should characterize our 
lives. We should more fully ob- 
serve the commandments of the 
Lord, wherein we are told to pray- 
always, without ceasing, for this is 
the law of God in Christ Jesus, con- 
cerning us. We should cry, in 
prayer, over all things pertaining 
to our welfare, and the welfare of 
our fellowmen, and the welfare of 
the Kingdom of God and the work 
of the Lord. When not engaged in 
crying aloud in prayer, we are 
taught to have in our hearts always 
a prayer of remembrance to our 
Father in heaven, petitioning Him 
for the continuation of His mer- 
cies and blessings, day after day. 

"Thou shalt not take the name 
of the Lord thy God in vain." 
When I read this commandment, 
I am instantly aware of the fact 
that there are some in our own 
midst, who know this command- 
ment, yet who do not keep it ; 
but it is not a frequent thing to 
hear from the mouths of men pro- 
fessing to be members of the 
Church and believers in God, the 
profanation of the Lord's name — 
blasphemy in the midst of Israel, 
taking lightly and in a profane 
way, the name of God the eternal 
Father. It ought not to be ; and 
wherever it is, it should be correct- 
ed — corrected by the individuals 
themselves ; and a strong effort 



ELDER HYRUM M. SMITH. 



should be made by all the leading 
brethren in the Church, and sisters, 
and presiding officers therein, to 
stamp out of the midst of Zion this 
terrible sin. It ought not to be 
among us ; it is a polluting crime 
that befouls a man and shows the 
condition of his heart when such 
evil proceeds from it. We know 
it is wrong; we know this com- 
mandment ; we know the Lord has 
said that He will not hold a man 
guiltless when, in his thoughtless- 
ness or wilful disobedience, he 
breaks that commandment. We 
know this, yet some men and boys 
in the midst of Zion disregard this 
commandment — thoughtlessly per 1 
haps, not realizing the extent of 
the punishment that shall be meted 
out to the guilty — nevertheless con- 
scious of the fact that it is a sin 
and ought not to be done. 

"Remember the Sabbath day, to 
keep it holy. Six days shalt thou 
labor, and do all thy work ; but the 
seventh day is the Sabbath of the 
Lord thy God : in it thou shalt not 
do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor 
thv daughter, thy manservant, nor 
thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, 
nor thy stranger that is within thy 
gates ; for in six days the Lord 
made heaven and earth, the sea, 
and all that in them is, and rested 
on the seventh day ; wherefore the 
Lord blessed the Sabbath day, and 
hallowed it." I am fully aware 
that this glorious day, which the 
Lord had set apart and hallowed, 
was desecrated by many in Israel. 
There are those among us who do 
not heed it as a holy day, but in- 
stead the Sabbath is turned by 
them into an unholy day, a day of 
recreation, of sinful pleasure, a 
day of desecration, of following 
after their own wills, a day where- 
in they strive as far as' possible to 
forget God rather than to remem- 



ber Him, a day in which they 
wend their way from the house 
of the Lord rather than towards it : 
seeking pleasure and forgetting 
God ; and this ought not to be. 
Brethren and sisters, we ought to 
keep this law. While written by 
the finger of God many centuries 
ago, and p-iven to the people, it has 
never been repealed. It was given 
by the same God who in later times, 
on the mount, delivered to the peo- 
ple the glorious beatitudes, and 
has never been rescinded, but is of 
force today ; and those who dese- 
crate the Sabbath, and do not heed 
this commandment will not be held 
guiltless before the Father, any 
more than the breaking of the 
other law, in the profanation of the 
name of the Lord. It is said that 
our sacrament meetings and Sab- 
bath meetings are not as well at- 
tended as they should be. We al- 
ways have a fair congregation of 
faithful saints in atendance, but 
there are many who, seeminglv, 
have forgotten the Sabbath day, 
who know the commandment but 
do not keep it. We should cor- 
rect this. Fathers and mothers are 
held responsible in this command- 
ment. They are not only com- 
manded to keep the Sabbath day 
holy themselves, and do no work 
therein, but to see to it that their 
sons and their daughters, the men 
servants and women servants, and 
even their cattle, shall not do any 
work on this holy day. If we have 
forgotten this, brethren and sisters, 
we should repent and turn unto the 
Loid. I find 't ^ very eas/ to fh 1 
things to preach about which 
should be a benefit to the saints, 
which apply and have to 'In villi 
them more particularly ; and now 
we ex ho "i yc.i to keep the Sab- 
bath clay holy and cease to dese- 
crate it.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



"Honor thy father and thy njoth- 
cr : that thy days may be long up- 
on the land which the Lord thy 
God giveth thee." Another com- 
mandment with which we are fa- 
miliar, and have heard frequently. 
How closely do we, sons and daugh- 
ters of faithful fathers and moth- 
ers, observe this commandment; 
Do we return unto them the hom- 
age that is their due, the honor 
they are entitled to ? Do we heed 
their counsel, and take their ad- 
vice ? When they tell us : "My 
son, honor the Sabbath day and 
keep it holy ; go to the meeting 
house and worship God, and par- 
take of the sacrament," do we hon- 
or that counsel, or do we treat it 
as something pertaining to fogy- 
ism — something for the aged, 
something good for the old but not 
• for the young? Do we dishonor our 
fathers and mothers by disobeying 
them in this case? If we do dis- 
obey them, do we realize that we 
are cutting ourselves off from the 
promise of long life in the land, 
this glorious land, of which so 
much has been spoken in this con- 
ference — the land which the Lord 
our God has given us ? How many 
of us speak lightly and disrespect- 
fully of father and mother, or any 
aged man or woman ? There may 
be some amoncr us who do this, per- 
haps only thoughtlessly, but never- 
theless it is a violation of one of 
the comandments of the Lord, for 
which, of course, all men must an- 
swer, if thev will not repent. On 
the other hand, fathers and moth- 
ers oueht to live such lives that 
they will be worthy of honor from 
sons and daughters. The man, the 
father, who breaks the command- 
ments of God, the man who violates 
this and other commandments, is 
he worthy of honor? Can he rea- 
sonably expect that his children 



will honor him, if he himself is a 
lawbreaker, violating the command- 
ments of God yet expecting his 
sons and daughters to honor him? 
Is there a dishonorable mother who 
can reasonably expect a daughter 
to honor her? Let fathers and 
mothers throughout Israel set an 
example before their families ; let 
them keep the comandments of the 
Lord, observe the Word of Wis- 
dom, remember their prayers, re- 
member God and love Him with 
all their heart, might, mind and 
strength, so that the children, all 
the clays of their lives, shall look 
upon father and mother with love 
and respect, and say in their 
hearts : We have the noblest 
father and the grandest mother 
that ever lived in the world ; they 
are honorable, truthful, faithful — 
fearing God and serving Him all 
their days, and how glad I am to 
honor such parents. Fathers and 
mothers, be worthy, so that your 
sons and daughters may devotedly 
keep this commandment. 

"Thou shalt not kill." There is 
a commandment we may say is uni- 
versally observed by the saints. 
They not only do not kill, but they 
have no desire in their hearts to kill 
their fellowmen or shed blood ; that 
is far from them ; they know the 
sinfulness of it; they know, as 
has been said, that it is a crime for 
which there is no forgiveness, and 
the uttermost farthing must be 
naid. We keep that command- 
ment as a people. 

"Thou shalt not commit adul- 
tery." Another soul destroying 
crime which is very rare among 
the Latter-day Saints. There is 
no other sin, save murder only, 
that will so soon destroy the spir- 
itual and moral life of men — why, 
it is spiritual suicide to participate 
in any such deadly crime. We do 



ELDER HYRUM M. SMITH. 



45- 



not sustain it; we do not suffer it; 
we do not tolerate it ; and we do 
not commit it, as a people. So far 
as I am concerned I will not sup- 
port any man or any set of men 
who are seducers and who commit 
this deadly sin, be they whom they 
may, within or without the Church 
of God ; neither will I sustain the 
men, or the publications, or the 
party that protect or sustain such 
corruption. 

"Thou shalt not steal." I hope 
none of us are given to this sin — 
the taking of that which does not 
belong to us, but which belongs to 
another. We should preserve ev- 
ery man in the possession of his 
own ; we should not take that which 
belongs to him, neither appropriate 
to ourselves any of his goods or 
property. My brethren and sisters, 
it is writen by the poet : "He that 
steals my purse steals trash." This 
comandment may be carried fur- 
ther than the stealing of the mate- 
rial or temporal possessions of 
men. We can carry it, as did the 
poet, to the good name of one an- 
other. We must not filch from 
men their good names ; we must 
not steal from them reputa- 
tion, but in all things we should 
be honest, truthful, upright, never 
stealing or taking that which does 
not belong to us. 

"Thou shalt not bear false wit- 
ness against thy neighbor." Al- 
ways speak the truth. We know 
that commandment, but there are 
some who apparently cannot keep 
it; who have grown accustomed to 
back-biting occasionally, speaking 
evil of one another, or accusing 
one another falsely. As Latter-day 
Saints, it seems to me that, of all 
persons in the world, we should be 
most free from that sin. By rea- 
son of what we have had to suffer 
because of the false witness that 



has been borne against us by our 
enemies, all the days of our lives — 
from the beginning until now 
have we suffered because our en- 
emies have been guilty of the sin 
of bearing false witness against us 
— we should not indulge in the 
same crime, even towards our ene- 
mies, to say nothing of indulging 
in it, in relation to one another. 

"Thou shalt not covet thy neigh- 
bor's house, thou shalt not covet 
thy neighbor's wife, nor his man- 
servant, nor his maidservant, nor 
. his ox, nor his ass, nor anything 
that is thy neighbor's." There is- 
no need to covet, if we will get the 
spirit of charity, and of industry 
and labor. There is no need to 
covet if we are willing to work, for 
we can then surround ourselves 
with the blessings of life, as we 
were told by Brother Smoot this 
morning. All these things are 
within our reach ; all we need to' 
do is to wisely proceed to surround 
ourselves with them, honestly. We 
do not need to covet that which 
is another's, for we may go for- 
ward and acquire these blessings 
for ourselves — honor, reputation,, 
character, wives, children, homes 
houses, lands, and all the blessings 
and gifts of the Holy Ghost; the- 
glorious principles of the ever- 
lasting gospel, and in the end eter- 
nal life ; all may be ours, and there- 
fore we ought not to covet that 
which others possess. All things 
shall be given to the man and the 
woman who will faithfully keep the- 
commandments of God. 

May the Lord bless you, and 
may it not be said of us, that we 
know the Ten Commandments or 
any other commandments, given by 
God or His servants, in early or 
later times, but we do not keep 
them ; but let it be said that the 
Latter-day Saints know God and 



46

know His commandments ; that 
they know the truth, and they 
are keeping all these things sacred- 
ly. God sanctify this condition to 
His people, in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 



ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH. 

The fruits of Mormonism. — Evil men 
the greatest opponents of the 
Church. — Obligations of parents. — 
Faith of Latter-day Saint children. 

I feel to praise my Maker this 
day for the blessing of being per- 
mitted to meet with you in this con- 
ference of the Church. I have been 
edified and rejoiced in the remarks 
that have been made by our breth- 
ren, and I crave the same Spirit 
that they have had to direct my ut- 
terance, that what I say may be in- 
spired of our Father and that we 
may be profited. I am reminded 
that we are a people who receive 
much instruction, and I rejoice, as 
I visit among the Stakes of Zion, 
to see the improvement that is 
made along many lines. From 
this stand I have heard the ser- 
vants of the Lord advise us to pat- 
ronize home industries, and I am 
constrained to ask myself the ques- 
tion. How many Latter-day Saints 
have remembered that wise coun- 
sel? We have been taught to keep 
the Word of Wisdom. How many 
of us who are here today are ful- 
filling that law of our Heavenly 
Father? I take pleasure in one 
thing I will name. It has only 
been a few years since the sisters 
were invited to uncover their heads 
in public worship, and I see there 
are only a few today who have for- 
gotten it. So I think we are mak- 
ing some progress along that line, 
and I desire to commend our sis- 
ters who remember this admoni- 



tion, very much to the comfort of 
those who are around them and to 
the blessing of themselves because 
of their obedience. 

Our Father in heaven has 
blessed us as a people in a remark- 
able way. We have been gather- 
ed out from the nations of the 
earth, and have been brought to 
dwell in this section of His vine- 
yard. As one of those who have 
been born of Latter-day Saint par- 
entage, I rejoice that I can* look 
all men in the face and say that 
the teachings of Mormonism have 
produced blessing to me in this life, 
and given me promise of eternal 
life. There are many in the world 
who misunderstand the mission of 
the Church of Christ. To such I 
desire to say that, as far as I am 
concerned, if there is anything good 
in life, any virtue, honesty, integ- 
rity, fearlessness to do right; if 
there is a disposition in me to hon- 
or my father and my mother, and 
a desire to sustain the Priesthood 
of the living God ; if I am disposed 
to sustain the constitution of this 
great country that we live in ; if 
there is in my heart a desire to 
uphold the great man whom God 
has honored to preside over the 
destinies of this nation ; if there is 
within me love for my fellowmen, 
and a desire to serve God and 
keep His commandments, these 
characteristics have come to me, 
my friends, by reason of "Mor- 
monism.'' From childhood, I 
have never been taught to do any- 
thing improper, or that would 
harm one of my heavenly Father's 
children ; but from infancy I have 
been taught to acquire industry, so- 
briety, honesty, integrity, and all 
virtues possessed by men and wom- 
en whom God delights to honor 
and bless. I thank my heavenly 
Father this day that these teach- 



ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH. 



47 



Ings have come to me from Him 
through His faithful servants. 

We have listened to instructions 
from our brethren, and I wonder 
how many of us will remember to 
put them into practice. Referring 
to the 7th chapter of Matthew and 
the 24th verse, I find the follow- 
ing: 

"Therefore, whosoever heareth these 
sayings of mine, and doeth them, I 
will liken him unto a wise man, which 
built his house upon a rock : 

"And the rain descended, and the 
floods came, and the winds blew, and 
beat upon that house ; and it fell not ; 
for it was founded upon a rock. 

"And everyone that heareth these 
sayings of mine and doeth them not, 
shall be likened unto a foolish man, 
which built his house upon the sand : 

"And the rain descended, and the 
floods came, and the winds blew, and 
beat upon that house ; and it fell : and 
great was the fall of it." 

How many of us, learning the 
will of the Father, are doing it? 
How many of us day by day are 
laying a foundation and building a 
structure that shall conform to the 
dignity of the stature of our Mas- 
ter? "Yea, man is the tabernacle 
of God, even temples ; and whatso- 
ever temple is defiled, God shall de- 
stroy that temple." He has given 
us intelligence and wisdom above 
our fellowmen. A knowledge of 
pre-existence has been given to the 
Latter-day Saints ; a knowledge 
that we are here because we kept 
our first estate, and that we have 
been given the opportunity of gain- 
ing eternal life in the presence of 
our heavenly Father, by keeping 
our second estate. We will not be 
judged as our brothers and sisters 
of the world are judged, but ac- 
cording to the greater opportuni- 
ties -ilaced in our keeping. We will 
"be among those who have received 
the word of the Lord, who have 



heard His sayings, and if we do 
them it will be to us eternal life, 
but if we fail condemnation will 
result. 

Speaking of the virtues that the 
Church of Jesus Christ is endeav- 
oring to inculcate in its devotees, I 
am reminded that up to this mo- 
ment I have never known any re- 
ally good man or woman in my day 
to lead a vicious crusade against 
the followers of our Lord and Mas- 
ter. The Church of Christ is not 
usually assailed from without by 
those who are moral in their 
lives. One of the best evidences 
to me of the lack of morality in 
men and women is that the adver- 
sary is able to put into their hearts 
a disposition to tear down the work 
of our heavenly Father. I say to 
the boys and girls .of Israel, keep 
yourselves pure and unspotted 
from the sins of the world. Be an 
example of what the Master de- 
sired we should be in the midst of 
the children of men. Magnify the 
opportunities that our Father has 
placed in your keeping'. If men 
among us shall try to lead you from 
the faith of your fathers, examine 
their lives and you will find mis- 
takes they have made whereby they 
have been led captive by the evil 
one. To my mind this is one of the 
strongest testimonies of the divin- 
ity of this work, that evil men con- 
stantly oppose it. Good men, and 
truly great men, possess the Spirit 
of our Father wherever they may 
be in the world. They are desir- 
ous to build up, and not to tear 
down, and that should be our mis- 
sion and labor while we remain up- 
on the earth. Let us so conduct 
ourselves that men, seeing our 
good works, may be constrained to 
glorify our Father which is in 
heaven. Our missionaries labor 
day by day among the people of 



4S 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



the world. They receive the con- 
tumely and hatred of those who 
misunderstand their mission, and 
many good people mistakenly drive 
them from their doors ; but when it 
comes to outside oppression, vin- 
dictiveness and maliciousness, and 
to wicked, unrelenting persecution 
of the Latter-day Saints, from the 
beginning it has been by those who 
serve the devil, and not those who 
seek to serve the Lord. So, I raise 
my warning voice this day to the 
youth of Zion. Be not deceived 
when storms of persecution break 
over your heads. There will be un- 
kind things said in the future as 
there have been in the past. See 
that your feet are planted upon the 
rock. See that you learn the de- 
sires of the Master toward you, 
and, knowing those desires, see to 
it that you keep His laws and com- 
mands. See to it that the purity 
of your lives shall entitle you to 
the companionship of the Holv 
Spirit, because if you are pure and 
virtuous and upright, the evil one 
will have no power to destroy you. 
Bear in mind, my young friends, 
that this is a serious matter. This 
life is not given to us as a pastime. 
There was a solemn purpose in our 
creation, in the life that God has 
given to us. Let us study what 
that purpose is, that we may pro- 
gress and obtain eternal life. 

I find much in the 93rd section 
of the Doctrine and Covenants that 
gives me joy, and I believe I will 
read a portion of it. It shows how 
generous our Father in heaven is 
to the children of men, that there 
are no favorites. It indicates that 
every man and woman who will 
strive to do the will of the Lord 
may receive His blessing, whether 
he be in one portion of our Father's 
vineyard or another. I read as 
follows : 



"Verily, thus saith the Lord, it shall 
come to pass that every soul who for- 
saketh their sins and cometh unto me, 
and calleth on my name, and obeyethi 
mv voice, and keepeth my command- 
ments, shall see my face and know that. 
I am." 

This is the word of our Father- 
in heaven to His children in the- 
world. Your mission and mine,, 
my brethren and sisters, is to so- 
teach that doctrine, that our broth- 
ers and sisters of the world may be 
induced to depart from the mis- 
takes they are making, and accept 
the nure Gospel of our Lord and' 
Master. We find in the same sec- 
tion the information that the Savior 
did not receive a fulness at once,, 
but grace was given Him for 
grace. As He overcame He de- 
veloped and progressed. We as- 
certain that not only was the Sa- 
vior in the beginning with the- 
Father, but also that you and I were- 
there. We dwelt there, and by rea- 
son of faithfulness, having kept our 
first estate, we have been permit- 
ted to come into this world and re- 
ceive tabernacles of flesh. The fact 
that we are living in the flesh is 
evidence that we did keep our first: 
estate. Now, realizing , that there- 
is a great purpose in life, let us- 
learn our duty and do it. Our boys 
and girls go out among the people- 
of the world, and they labor in 
kindness and in love to teach the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ. We have 
not striven to force it upon the hu- 
man family, but upon us is laid the 
obligation to teach it in sincerity 
and in devotion. 

Fathers and mothers, are you' 
teaching your children this Gospel ?' 
Or do vou wait until they grow to- 
manhood and womanhood, only to- 
find that they do not comprehend 
it? Are you preparing the sons, 
and daughters God has blessed you 
with to become messengers of life

and salvation among the children 
of men? Or are you neglecting 
that sacred opportunity, and per- 
mitting them to grow up thought- 
less and indifferent regarding these 
things? I am persuaded that, if 
there are any children of Latter-day 
Saint parentage who depart from 
the faith, they are those who have 
not understood the meaning of the 
doctrines of Christ, who have not 
had instilled into their hearts faith 
in our heavenly Father, and who 
do not comprehend that it means 
eternal life to them to keep His 
commandments. So I Say we 
should be imbued with the desire 
to labor and teach our sons and 
daughters those things that will 
save them in the presence of our 
Father. We need not feel anxious 
about the progress of Zion, for the 
good old ship will sail proudly on, 
and those who are faithful and 
true will land with her safely in 
the harbor of God, crowned with 
glory, immortality and eternal 
life. I have no fear for these aged 
men and women that have kept the 
faith. I have no fear for the boys 
and girls who are walking in obe- 
dience to the comandments of the 
Lord. I have no fear for those not 
of our faith who are living up to 
the light that God has blessed them 
with, because according to the law 
received so will we be judged and 
held accountable ; but the Latter- 
day Saints who knowing the will of 
our Father have not done it, those 
who hear the teachings of the Lord 
from time to time and turn their 
backs upon them, I fear they will 
not reach the goal unless they turn 
and repent with all their hearts. 

I feel this afternoon that I look 
into the faces of a body of men and 
women who are devoted to the 
cause of the Master. The question 
has been asked, Is it possible that 



the boys and girls that have been 
reared in these valleys of the 
mountains would be willing to suf- 
fer the hardships, privations and 
trials that their fathers and moth- 
ers endured for the Gospel's sake? 
Would they leave their homes of 
comfort to people a new country in 
the interest of their faith? I say 
unto you that if our Father has 
planted in their hearts a knowledge 
of the divinity of this work as you 
know it; if faith has been given 
them by reason of patience and de- 
votion in keeping the command- 
ments of the Lord; if they have 
been educated to know that Jesus 
is the Christ and that Joseph Smith 
was a prophet of the Lord, then I 
say unto you, Yes ! they would do 
what their fathers and mothers 
have done, take their place in the 
ranks of latter-day Israel, and if 
it means privation, if it means sick- 
ness and distress, or even expatri- 
ation from home, there are hun- 
dreds and thousands of your sons 
and daughters who, knowing that 
this is the Gospel of Christ, would, 
if need be, seal their testimony with 
their blood. I am grateful that I 
have this belief and feeling in re- 
gard to the sons and daughters of 
the Latter-day Saints. President 
Smith, who stands at our head, is 
an example to us. All the days of 
his life he has been faithful and 
true. No one can put his finger 
upon an instance where he has 
wronged any man. The Lord has 
blessed him, and he has been ex- 
alted among men. We would do 
well to watch his life, and emulate 
the splendid traits of character 
that have been manifest in him to 
so large a degree. He need not feel 
that the youth are recreant; for I 
say, as one of the sons of Zion, one 
of the weakest among you, I believe 
we stand ready at any time with 



50 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



our faith, our devotion, and all 
that God has blessed us with, to do 
His will and keep His command- 
ments, and to sustain those whom 
He calls to preside over His 
Church. My belief is strengthened 
in this by the fact that, as a rule, 
the boys and girls of the Latter- 
day Saints go willingly to the mis- 
sion field. They leave comforta- 
ble homes, father and mother, and 
all that is near and dear to them ; 
they turn their backs upon creature 
comforts, and go out into the world 
to nreach Christ and Him crucified. 
They are ready whenever the call 
comes, if they have been taught 
the principles of the Gospel. Are 
your sons and daughters among 
those who are thus ready? If they 
are not, then it behooves you to be- 
gin at once the teaching of your 
children, that they may be willing 
to magnify this call when it shall 
come to them. 

The Lord is abundantly blessing 
us in these mountain fastnesses. 
Our cattle and sheep are upon a 
thousand hills. The grain crop this 
year has been bounteous. Our sons 
and daughters live in more com- 
fortable homes than did their par- 
ents. All over this land the good 
word goes out that Zion prospers, 
all is well ! But let us not be lulled 
to sleep, let us not be deceived by 
the abundance of good things of 
this world ; for what doth it profit 
a man though he should gain the 
whole world and lose his own soul ? 
Let not the object of our creation 
be overlooked ; but let us labor for 
the salvation of our souls while 
we are blessed with creature co m- 
forts. Let us put forth our energy 
to save those who do not under- 
stand the truth. Let us live togeth- 
er in an undivided bond of love 
and union, that those who live in 
the world may look to Zion and see 



there men and women who serve 
the Lord and keep His command- 
ments. While we have weaknesses, 
and make mistakes, while some 
transgress the laws of the Lord 
from time to time, I have never 
seen a people (and I have travel- 
ed through the world considerably ) 
that I thought lived so near to our 
heavenly Father as the Latter-day 
Saints do. I have never seen a peo- 
ple willing to make so many sacri- 
fices for the Gospel's sake. So I 
am grateful to my heavenly Father 
that I was born of Latter-day Saint 
parentage. I am thankful that my 
ancestors were honored of the 
Lord by being inspired to accept 
the Gospel of Jesus Christ. I an-, 
grateful that your ancestors also 
received light and blessings from 
our Father ;for it is indeed a bless- 
ing to receive that inspiration. 

Now, while we live and labor let 
us magnify our calling. Let no 
man be found recreant to his op- 
portunities. Let us not turn our 
backs upon the blessings of the. 
Lord, but day by day go faithfully 
on blessing our father's children. 
We have no hard feelings toward 
any of our fellowmen ; we have no 
occasion to. If they misunderstand 
us, misquote us, and persecute us, 
we should remember they are in 
the hands of the Lord, who has 
said,"V engeance is mine, I will re- 
pay," and who further has said, "I 
will forgive whom I will forgive, 
but of you it is expected to forgive 
all men." So when we partake of 
the sacrament of the Lord's sup- 
per, as we do from time to time, 
let us purge from our hearts all 
feeling of unkindness toward one 
another and toward our brothers 
and sisters who are not of our 
faith. Let us labor clay by day 
that our Father may bless us. If 
we have His Holy Spirit, the peo- 



ELDER CHARLES W. PENROSE. 



51 



pie with whom we come in contact 
will feel it, because it will perme- 
ate the atmosphere in which we 
live, and they will partake of it and 
drink it in, even though they may 
not desire so to do. Let us mag- 
nify the Lord by keeping His com- 
mandments. Let us popularize His 
work by laboring to build it up and 
extend it among the children of 
men. Let us magnify one another 
by speaking good only, and by 
strengthening the hands of those 
who are weak, and assisting those 
who are less patient than ourselves. 

I rejoice this day that there are 
so many of the general authorities 
here, and that our Father has pour- 
ed out His blessings upon us so 
abundantly in this conference. I 
pray that the influence and spirit 
•of this gathering may go to the 
furthermost stakes of Zion, that 
it may be from one end of the land 
to the other, that there may be an 
awakening among the Latter-day 
Saints ; that we may not take it for 
granted that those who live among 
us understand the Gospel of Jesus 
Christ, but that we may teach it to 
them, and teaching it, that we our- 
selves may receive a strengthening 
of our testimony. 

I know this is the work of the 
Lord, that Jesus was indeed our 
Savior, and that Joseph Smith was 
a Prophet of the Lord. I know 
those who have succeeded him have 
been men of God, who have hon- 
ored the calling placed upon them. 
I know that our Father is blessing 
Zion at this time, and the man who 
holds the keys today is honored 
by all good men and women, wher- 
ever they may be in the wide world, 
who understand him. I feel this 
•day to say to you, my brethren and 
sisters, that we will do well to live 
so that other men and women see- 



ing us may feel to compliment the 
work of our Father, realizing by 
our conduct that we are members 
of the Church of Christ, they may 
feel to say, there is a good people. 
If we live up to the teachings of 
the Church, if we will keep all the 
commandments of our Father, men 
and women can say nothing else of 
us, because we will be the best peo- 
ple that live upon the earth. I be- 
lieve we are that ahead)'', but there 
is room for improvement. Let us 
make this improvement ; let us hon- 
or the Lord, honor the principles 
and opoprtunities He has granted 
us, and be a blessing to His chil- 
dren wheresoever they may be. I 
pray that His blessing may be in 
your hearts and in your homes, 
that your sons and daughters may 
be worshipers of the living God, 
that they may keep His command- 
ments, and grow up to bear the 
names you have given them in hon- 
or among the children of men ; that 
wherever they may go the light of 
the Spirit of the Lord may beam 
from their faces, bearing evidence 
of their integrity, their virtue and 
their worth. That this may be 
your privilege and mine, that we 
may work here to prepare for that 
great future life, and receive in 
the end from our heavenly Father 
that welcome plaudit, "Well done, 
good and faithful servant," is the 
prayer of your co-laborer, in the 
name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

I hope, my brethren and sisters, 
that I shall obtain the same atten- 
tion and be led by the same good 
spirit which the brethren who have 
preceded me have enjoyed, not 
only this afternoon, but in all the 
meetings of this conference. I 
have seen it in print that the at- 
tendance at this conference was not 
so large as on some former occa- 
sions. I could not help marveling 
at that statement ; for from the first 
meeting of the conference we have 
had a most splendid attendance. 
Not only has the lower part of this 
tabernacle been filled, with the ex- 
ception of a few seats in the north- 
eastern part, but the galleries also 
have been crowded with attentive 
Latter-day Saints, desiring to wor- 
ship God and to be instructed in 
the things of His kingdom. The 
Spirit of the Lord has been poured 
out upon those who have spoken 
to us, from the opening remarks 
by President Joseph F. Smith down 
to the present time. I have enjoyed 
the sessions of this conference ex- 
ceedingly. I have been pleased 
to see the desire manifest by the 
Latter-day Saints in their attend- 
ance and in their attention, and in 
the spirit which surrounds them 
and which they breathe. I have 
seen in this a token of the spread 
of the work of God and of the 
growth of His kingdom — His spir- 
itual kingdom — in the hearts of the 
people, as well as the spreading 
forth of the visible Church of 
Christ among the nations of the 
earth. 

I hope that our children have 
been taught to learn the Ten Com- 
mandments, read to us this after- 



noon by Brother Hyrum M. Smith,, 
also the precepts of the New Testa- 
ment, that they may be familiar 
with them. I notice that our chil- 
dren in the Sunday schools are 
taught these precepts and these 
commandments, and they will grow 
up with a knowledge of them if 
they do not merely learn by rote- 
the lessons that are given to them,, 
and if they are also instructed in 
their homes in relation to these 
important things. I remember a 
story told of a man who made a 
bet that a friend of his did not 
know the Lord's Prayer, and the 
bet was taken up, the money was 
deposited, and the man who laid 
the money down was very confi- 
dent. When he was asked to re- 
peat the Lord's Prayer he said : 

"Now I lay me down to sleep, 
I pray the Lord my soul to keep; 
And if I die before I wake, 
I pray the Lord my soul to take." 

The other man said, "Well, the 
money is yours ; but I didn't be- 
lieve you could do it." (Laughter). 
It is alleged that this was a United 
States senator, but I consider that 
scandal. It may be true, however. 
What we need, my brethren and 
sisters, is to have these principles 
and precepts impressed upon our 
own minds, and also upon the 
minds of the rising generation. 
There is a spirit prevailing among 
a portion of the Latter-day Saints 
— young men — not the young la- 
dies very much, but some of our 
young men, who are being led 
astray by a spirit and influence 
which does not proceed from God,, 
but from the Evil One, and I am: 
afraid that they have not been suf- 
ficiently indoctrinated in the prin- 
ciples and precepts of the Gospel 
of Jesus Christ so that they have 
grown up with them implanted iru

their souls. This part of the work 
-devolves upon the parents in Zion. 
The Lord revealed in the begin- 
ning that inasmuch as parents hav- 
ing children in Zion did not teach 
them to understand the doctrines 
of faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, 
repentance and baptism for the re- 
mission of sins, and the laying on 
•of hands for the gift of the Holy- 
Ghost, when eight years old, the 
sin should be on the heads of the 
parents ; and the inhabitants of 
Zion were to teach their children 
to pray, to observe the Sabbath 
-day, and to walk in all holiness be- 
fore the Lord. They should teach 
them the precepts that we have 
"heard taught in this conference. I 
do not believe that so many of our 
young men would run wild, and 
<lrink into the spirit of the world, 
use intoxicants, and befoul their 
systems with tobacco and other 
things that the Lord has said are 
not good for man, if a proper ex- 
ample had been always set before 
them in the home and these prin- 
ciples had been instilled into their 
minds by their parents. They may 
learn these things in the Sunday 
school and easily forget them ; but 
the force of examole in the home 
and the impressions made upon lit- 
tle children by their mothers are 
lasting, and will be upon their souls 
as long as they live in the flesh, and 
throughout all eternity. 

We have heard today that the 
Latter-day Saints do not desire to 
•do evil to anyone. They do not 
seek to bring injury upon anyone. 
They do not attack the creeds of 
men. They do not go forth to 
fight. They do not wish to take 
up carnal weapons. But they have 
had to stand on the defensive from 
the beginning of tnis work. From 
the rise of the Church of Jesus 



Christ of Latter-day Saints it has 
been assailed. Generally speaking, 
the movements against it have orig- 
inated among people of different 
religious faiths. It has been from 
persons professing to hold the 
Christian religion and to be teach- 
ers of it that the falsehoods and 
misrepresentations concerning us, 
our acts, our motives, our princi- 
ples, have emanated ; and they have 
been taken up by corrupt, wicked 
and evil-minded persons. And so 
the warfare has continued. We 
have stood in self-defense. Some- 
times we have been a little vigor- 
ous in taking up these weapons, 
not the weapons that are called car- 
nal, but polemics, arguments, state- 
ments of the truth, references to 
the scripture and to the lives and 
works of our leaders, whom we 
have held up as honorable men who 
desired to keep the commandments 
of God and to live in peace with 
their fellowmen. But a mission 
has been entrusted to the people of 
this Church, and that is, to pub- 
lish the gospel of peace to the ends 
of the earth, to declare the truth, 
to bear witness that God has spoken 
again from the heavens, that He 
has restored the authority of the 
holy Apostleship and Priesthod, 
that He has placed the power and 
authority upon men on the earth, 
to represent Him and to act for 
Him, and that what they do by His 
authority and in the way He has 
appointed will not only be sealed 
and recorded on earth, but will be 
sealed and recorded in the heavens, 
and that this Gospel is "a savor of 
life unto life or of death unto 
death" to all that hear it. This 
mission is given to us. We are re- 
quired to bear this Gospel abroad, 
or help to send it, until every na- 
tion, and kindred, and tongue and 



54 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



people under the whole heavens 
shall hear the sound of the Gos- 
pel and shall have an opportunity 
of receiving or rejecting it; and the 
consequences will be on their own 
heads. 

Now, in this great work in which 
we are engaged, as I have said, we 
do not expect to use carnal weap- 
ons. God has declared that He will 
fight our battles. He has told us 
not to be afraid of our enemies. I 
do not believe that the spirit of 
fear is among the Latter-day 
Saints. I know it is not among 
their leaders. We are not to be 
afraid of our enemies ; for God has 
declared that He will fight our bat- 
tles. It is true, He has permitted 
the Church to be driven from place 
to place. He has allowed the wick- 
ed to rise in their anger and wratn 
and slay some of the saints of God ; 
and Joseph and Hyrum, those two 
noble brothers who lived toeerhe' 
in love and who died at the same 
time and went into the presence of 
their Maker, were martyrs for the 
word of God and for the testimony 
of Jesus. But so it was of old ; so 
it has been from the beginning. 
And while the Lord may permit 
these things to occur, out of all 
these seeming evils He will bring 
out good. The work of God has 
rolled forth, the principles of the 
Gospel have been preached, and the 
world has been roused up by the 
light that the Lord has sent into it, 
which has scintillated from the 
teachings of His servants. But 
the spirit and power of darkness 
are here, too, and there will be a 
great struggle until they are ovei 
come. 

I want to read two or three 
verses which have occurred to me 
while our brethren have been read- 
ing scripture. They are from the 



epistle of Paul to the Ephesians, 
in the 6th chapter, commencing at 
the 12th verse : 

"For we wrestle not against flesh and 
blood, but against principalities, against 
powers, against the rulers of the dark- 
ness of this world, against spiritual 
wickedness in high places. 

"Wherefore take unto you the whole 
armor of God, that ye may be able to- 
withstand in the evil day, and having 
done all, to stand." 

This is a real warfare that is tak- 
ing place on this planet where you 
and I live. It commenced in the- 
beginning. It was made possible 
through transgression. Our par- 
ents in the Garden broke a law 
that God gave them, and by the 
breaking of that law the power of 
evil entered into this world. It is 
stated that in the beginning Satan 
entered the serpent, and Satan was 
the serpent;" that he was more 
subtle than any of the beasts of 
the field. That is his character. We 
learn a little about his character by 
that which he did before this globe 
was framed as a dwellingplace for 
the children of the Lord. He was 
in the beginning with the Father, 
as Jesus was. Jesus said, "I also 
was in the beginning with the 
Father, and am the firstborn." I 
know that some of our people have 
obtained a notion that Lucifer was 
the firstborn, and that he lost his 
place and birthright through trans- 
gression. But Jesus is the Christ, 
the firstborn among the sons of 
God, ''the firstborn of every crea- 
ture." In that 93rd section of the 
Doctrine and Covenants, from 
which Brother George Albert 
Smith read just now, Jesus Christ, 
who was crucified on Mount Cal- 
vary, and who rose from the dead, 
and who sat at the right hand of 
the Father, and who in these last 



ELDER CHARLES W. PENROSE. 



55 



days has appeared with the Father 
and revealed the everlasting Gos- 
pel, makes the declaration that He 
was in the beginning with the 
Father, and was the firstborn. "Ye 
also," He says, "were in the begin- 
ning with the Father." "Man was 
in the beginning with the Father." 
We are the sons and daughters of 
God, and were in the beginning 
with Christ. When we speak about 
"the beginning" we mean the be- 
ginning as it relates to this earth on 
which we live. When the plan 
was formed for the formation of 
this globe, to go into its right place 
at the right time and in the right 
way, that it might revolve in its 
orbit and not interfere with the 
revolutions of any of the planets 
and stars that God our Father had 
made, that was "the beginning" 
spoken of in scripture. But with 
God there is no beginning, and 
there is no end. With intelligence 
which is the light of truth, there is 
no beginning, and there can be no 
end. The nature of our spiritual 
existence is on a par with that. But 
in our beginning as the sons and 
daughters of God we were there 
with the Father and with the 
Savior; and according to the reve- 
lations that God has given in these 
last days, the being who is called 
Lucifer, or Satan, or Beelzebub, or 
the serpent, or the adversary, or 
the accuser of the brethren, he also 
was there and led away "a third 
part of the hosts of heaven, be- 
cause of their agency," and was in- 
deed a subtle intelligence, but he 
prostituted the intelligence he had 
to an evil purpose. Through the 
transgressions of our first parents 
he obtained power on this globe, 
and he has held it from that time 
to the present. He has aided in 
setting up kings ana casting down 
kings. He is "the prince of the 



power of the air." He is that Evil 
One whom Christ will bind at His 
coming, that he may not any more 
have .power upon the face of this 
earth. But he is here now, and 
his hosts are here; and they have 
been from the beginning. 

I have not time to take up the 
scriptures and show the influences 
that he and his associates have ex- 
ercised over nations and kingdoms,, 
princes and peoples; but suffice it 
to say that when Christ Jesus our 
Lord was baptized of John in the 
River Jordan, when He was thirty 
years of age, He was led by the 
Spirit into the wilderness that He 
might be confronted with that evil 
power which has been on the earth 
from the beginning. Light came 
upon the world, and there was also 
darkness. The conditions of this 
globe are typical of this spiritual 
condition. Light is here, and men 
may receive light. Darkness is 
here, and men may go into the 
deeds of darkness. When light 
comes into the world and they re- 
ject it, they do so because their 
deeds are evil, as Christ pointed 
out. Jesus was taken up into the 
mount that the spirit and power of 
darkness might be confronted with 
Him. He was shown the king- 
doms of this world, with all their 
pomp and might, riches and glory 
and strength. That Evil One tempt- 
ed Him, and said, If you will bow 
down and worship me, I will give 
you these ; for they are mine. Of 
course, when he works he general- 
ly has a little truth mixed up with 
a great deal of falsehood. That is 
the way with that wicked one. 
There was this much truth in what 
he said to Jesus ; he had obtained 
control, temporarily, over' the na- 
tions of the earth, he influenced 
them and their rulers, and they 
were under his dominion, but that 



56 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



dominion was only for a time. Still 
he promised Jesus that if He would 
worship him, he would give Him 
all these kingdoms and their glo- 
ries. But Jesus told him to get 
behind. He understood better; He 
comprehended that that was the 
spirit of darkness. So it was when 
the same being confronted Moses, 
as we read in the Pearl of Great 
Price. 

I merely refer to that to show the 
attitude of this being. According 
to the Book of Mormon, he is an 
individual. According to the Doc- 
trine and Covenants, he is a person- 
age. According to the Bible, he is 
a spiritual person. He is here on 
the earth, as Paul says, going about 
"like a roaring lion, seeking whom 
he may devour," or as a serpent, 
trying to tempt and lead mankind 
from God. Now, that spirit is in 
the world — the spirit of the power 
of darkness, the spirit of that wick- 
ed one. After Jesus Christ had 
been in His ministry for some time 
He declared, "The prince of this 
world cometh, but he hath nothing 
in me." Jesus had been tried and 
tempted by him; all kinds of arts 
had been brought to bear upon our 
Savior; but they utterly and com- 
pletely failed, and Jesus was with- 
out blemish or spot. He knew no 
sin. Guile was not found in His 
mouth. He kept every command- 
ment ; and He came, not to do His 
own will, but the will of Him that 
sent Him. So when the prince of 
this world came along, there was 
nothing in Christ that he could 
touch ; for He was sinless and spot- 
less. 

Now, if we will keep the com- 
mandments of Christ and walk in 
the spirit of our Redeemer, there 
will be no place for Satan in our 
hearts nor in our homes. But 
these powers of evil are on the 



earth, and they have come down, 
as John saw them in the vision, 
just before the time of the end, 
"having great wrath ; for they know 
that their time is short." How 
do they work? Why, if they can, 
they work through the children of 
the kingdom. If they can, they 
move upon you, upon me, upon ev- 
ery man and woman in the Church 
that can be tempted or drawn aside. 
But after we have resisted, again, 
and again, the time will come when 
they will cease their personal ef- 
forts upon us; but they will attack 
us through our children, or our 
companions in the home — the man 
or the woman in the home who 
does not keep the commandments 
of God. Snares are laid particu- 
larly for the rising generation. 
These spirits are here in this city. 
They are throughout the land. 
They are measurably over all the 
earth ; but they are concentrated in 
their efforts to a large degree right 
here where we live. Now, we have 
no personal warfare against even 
our enemies. Those who slander 
and abuse, • who try to irritate us 
to make us respond and retaliate, 
let them do that and fail. Let them 
go on with their evil works. Daniel 
saw in the vision of the last times, 
that "the wicked should do wick- 
ly, and none of the wicked should 
understand ;" but the wise shall un- 
derstand, he says, "and they that 
turn many unto righteousness shall 
shine like the stars and like the 
sun forever and ever." Let them 
go on, therefore, with their evil 
work. But let us do our work of 
light and truth and righteousness. 

I am sorry to hear remarks that 
come sometimes from some of our 
young men, showing that they have 
drunk into this evil spirit of slan- 
der and reproach against men who 
are pure in their lives, who are

-serving God, who are serving their 
country, and who are doing their 
duty. I will say here for myself, 
that I think every man in this 
Church, no matter what authority 
he may have in the priesthood, has 
just as many civil rights as any 
other American citizen. I do not 
•claim for him any more, and I do 
not concede that he has any less. 
Every man who is an America?i 
citizen stands, according to the 
theory, equal before the law. It is 
not true that we are all born equal 
in size or in physical stature or 
strength, or in wealth, or in intel- 
lect, or in some opportunities ; but 
every person born in the United 
States, or legally naturalized, is a 
citizen on an equal plane with 
other citizens, so far as the rights 
and privileges of a citizen are con- 
cerned. I have heard some of our 
young men talk in a way that 
shows they do not appreciate that, 
and they are drinking into the spirit 
of opposition which comes from 
that Evil One. I have no doubt 
that there are some people oppos- 
ing this Church who are mistaken, 
and who are not corrupt or wicked 
in their intentions, but their eyes 
are blinded by the powers of dark- 
ness. But the root of this opposi- 
tion is in iniquity, in darkness, in 
corruption, in evil. Scan the lives 
of many of those who speak, and 
particularly fight, against the 
Church of God and against His 
Zion, and you will find that they 
are of the character that has been 
mentioned here today. But we do 
not want to bring that up against 
them. We are not fighting against 
them as individuals. Our warfare 
is with these powers that are be- 
hind the veil ; and the only way to 
fight them effectually is to bar 
them from our souls, and to teach 
•our children the principles of eter- 



nal life, that they may not become 
subject to these evil powers. If 
we yield to them, they will become 
the masters. Satan cannot obtain 
the mastery over any human being, 
except by yielding to him. We are 
his whom we list to obey. "Resist 
the devil and he will flee from 
you," the Lord says. 

Now, my brethren and sisters, 
we are in one of those tests that 
have occurred frequently— one of 
those trials that come upon this 
Church; and it remains to be seen 
what we will do. The Lord allows 
these periods to come upon us that 
we may be tested, tried and proved, 
to see if we will stand firm, as we 
are exhorted to do in what I have 
read to you. Shall we stand firm, 
or shall we yield? Shall we give 
place to the devil and his works, 
or shall we stand as a united body 
of the saints of the living God, to 
serve our heavenly Father, keep 
His commandments, and preserve 
the rights and privileges which we 
should enioy in common with all 
other people upon this goodly land ? 
We love the Constitution of our 
country, as we have heard today. 
We love the institutions which se- 
cure to mankind that liberty which 
all the sons and daughters of God 
should enjoy; and we hope to see 
the principles of liberty spread 
throughout the world, and the flag 
of liberty floating in every breeze, 
and that the time will soon come 
when all people shall be free to 
serve God and keep His command- 
ments, or to take that course which 
pleases them, the consequences be- 
ing in the hands of the Lord, and 
will be dealt out to them according 
to justice and mercy. But we do 
not want to fight with any carnal 
weapons. We do not want to de- 
scend to the measures and plans 
and methods of the ungodly and

the wicked and corrupt. We do 
not want to be brought under their 
dominion, either. And I will tell 
you that if we will stand firm in the 
liberty with which God has made 
us free — in the Gospel, which is the 
perfect law of liberty — God will 
take care that out of all the seem- 
ing evil good will come, as He 
brought light out of darkness in 
the beginning of this globe. He is 
above all ; He is over all. His pow- 
er and dominion stretch out 
through the vast domains of space, 
on this earth and all others that He 
has created. He has purposes in 
regard to us as well as to them, 
and He has sent us down here on 
the earth for a time and a season, 
that we may be proven, tested and 
tried, to see what we are worthy of, 
so that in the future we mav be 
placed where we belong, and have 
glory, immortality and endless in- 
crease, with dominions, and king- 
doms, and principalities and powers 
forever, if we are fit to have them ; 
and if not, that we may go !.o our 
own place, receive the judgment 
which we ought to have, and enter 
into that degree of glory for which 
we fit ourselves. 

Now, shall we stand firm in the 
Gospel of Christ? Shall we resist 
the powers of evil? Shall we take 
care that in our own personal con- 
duct and lives we shall be worthy 
of the Spirit of the Lord, that Sa- 
tan can have no dominion over us, 
in body or in spirit? Shall we 
stand by the servants of the living 
God whom He has called and ap- 
pointed to lead His people in the 
last days ? Shall our hearts go out 
to them? Shall we stand by them 
under every circumstance, in every 
condition? Shall we be true to 
the Priesthood that God has re- 
stored? Shall we be true to the 
Gospel which He has revealed? 



Shall we teach our children the 
things of the kingdom, and train 
them up in the fear of the Lord? 
Shall we check our boys and our 
girls when they would depart from 
the right and from the straight 
and narrow way? Teach them tr> 
keep the Sabbath holy. Teach them 
to come out from the wicked, and 
be not unclean as they are. Teach 
them to shun the very appearance- 
of evil. Teach them to be pure in 
heart, in spirit, in word, and in act, 
as well as in body. Teach them to 
observe the preceots that are con- 
tinually being presented. Then 
the blessing of God will be upon 
Zion, and she will arise and shine ; 
and though the wicked may look 
upon her and say, Let her be de- 
filed, God shall deliver her out of 
all her afflictions in the future as 
He has done in the past, and bring 
her off more than conqueror. 
Christ Jesus, our King, shall come 
and bind Satan with the chain of 
the Holy Priesthood, that he may 
be banished from the earth, and 
the earth delivered from his influ- 
ence and his bondage, and prepared 
for the coming of our Eternal 
Father, whose tabernacle will be 
with men, and He will dwell with 
them and be their Father and 
their God, wipe away all tears 
from their eyes, and there shall 
be no more sorrow and no more 
pain and no more death. God has- 
ten Jhe day, through Jesus Christ. 
Amen.

THIRD DAY. 



Sunday, October 7, 10 a. m. 

The Tabernacle was excessively 
crowded, and it was announced that 
an overflow meeting, would be held 
in the Assembly Hall. 

Conference was called to order 
by President Joseph F. Smith. 

The choir sang the hymn, 

Glorious things of thee are spoken, 

Zion, city of our God ! 
He whose word cannot be broken, 

Chose thee for His own abode. 

Prayer was offered by Elder By- 
ron Sessions. 

The choir sang the anthem, 

From afar, gracious Lord, 
Thou didst gather Thy flock. 

ELDER CHARLES W. NIBLEY. 

It is an inspiring sight, my 
brethren and sisters, to face a con- 
gregation such as this. I rejoice 
with you, this morning, in assem- 
bling for worship. I am thankful 
and I am sure you all are, for the 
excellent weather with which we 
are favored. I think that is one 
thing that all classes of people in 
Salt Lake can unite in praising. 
Surely we can all agree that we 
are having fine conference weath- 
er. 

I rejoice in being connected 
with this great work, the work of 
the Lord. I was born of parents 
who belonged to this Church; I 
may say I was born in the Church ; 
I have grown, so far as I have 



grown, in it in every way. I am, 
I hooe, a part of it ; it is to me the 
choicest thing in life. I know that 
the Lord established this work, that 
He raised up the prophet Joseph 
Smith to lay the foundations of this 
great cause, an institution which is 
destined to work a revolution in 
the world, a revolution in the in- 
terests of peace and blessings, good 
order, good government, good citi- 
zenship, and all that will tend to 
the uplifting of humanity. That 
is the mission of "Mormonism." 
I rejoice to be connected with such 
a Church. True, it is small now in 
comparison, but it will ptow and 
continue to extend until it becomes 
world-wide in its effects. The ef- 
fects are to be seen on every hand 
where the believing soul accepts 
and devotes itself to the work and 
the will of the Lord. 

The Latter-day Saints are much 
misunderstood in the world, and 
even at home. Our mission is a 
mission of love. The work that 
the Lord has inaugurated is one 
that will tend to make poverty be- 
come extinct in the world. All 
that men struggle for in socialism 
— that is, all that is best in what 
they call socialism — is to be found 
here, a perfect equality, the same 
ordinances, blessings, and gifts of 
the Gospel for rich and poor alike. 
Men and women are equal in it. 
It has a tendency, therefore, to 
make us a brotherhood, acknowl- 
edging, at all times, our common 
Father. We are — as the children 
of the world are — children of God. 
They are our brothers and sisters; 



ELDER CHARLES W. NIBLEY

and there is that spirit In Mormon - 
ism which teaches us to love and 
to help them. When the Savior 
was on the cross, in the midst of 
His agony, He said, "Father, for- 
give them, for they know not what 
they do." Saint Paul's sentiment 
was : "Alexander, the copper- 
smith, did me much evil ; I hope the 
Lord will reward him according 
to his deeds." I like the Savior's 
sentiment the better, to return good 
for evil, and exalt our souls in the 
spirit of forgiveness, love and 
mercy. I know that there is in 
this religion that which makes for 
salvation in every respect, tempor- 
al as well as spiritual. 

There is a feeling of safety, of 
peace, in this community that I 
find nowhere else in the world. Not 
only do we who are Latter-day 
Saints find it so, but others who 
are not of us appreciate to some 
extent this feeling of security and 
safety. There is a greater respec: 
for law and order in this com- 
munity than, I believe, there is 
among the same number of people 
anywhere else in the world; and 
a respect for the rights of men, 
not only for those who are mem- 
bers of our Church, but for every 
man and woman. I believe firmly 
that men who have large interests 
here, men who own railroads, 
mines, smelters, and other property 
of extensive and valuable charac- 
ter, they feel, and know to a very 
considerable extent, that their in- 
terests are more secure, and better 
safeguarded in this community of 
Latter-day Saints than the same 
would be anywhere else in the 
world today. There is not the dan- 
ger of disorder among this peonle 
that there is elsewhere ; not the 
likelihood of mob-law, nor the evils 
arising from strikes. This Church 
takes the position that every man 



is free, in the proper sense of the 
word ; he is free to labor, and he 
ought to labor, of course, for "the 
idler," the Lord says, "shall not eat 
the bread of the laborer." Every 
man and woman, every boy and 
girl ought to be proud to labor. 
This Church and people declares 
that every man is free ; lie can work 
or quit work, or he can go on 
strike if he chooses ; he can join 
one association or another, ana he 
has the right to persuade others to 
join with him, if he can persuade 
them peaceably ; but, when he un- 
dertakes to kill the man who wants 
to work, then there is a sentiment 
in this community which stepj in 
and says — and "Mormonism" 
teaches it — "Thus far shalt thou 
go and no farther. You must not 
interfere with the man who wants 
to work, even though you may not 
want to work vourself." 

We had an experience here a 
year or two ago, and it is to our 
credit that I recall it. I refer to 
the strike which occurred in the 
coal regions of eastern Utah. 
Through the influence and efforts 
of strong, good, and righteous men 
in this community, and to a very 
great extent through their efforts 
alone — I do not think I need to 
mince words — largely, I will say, 
throueh the efforts of the presid- 
ing officers of this Church, peace 
was maintained here, and anarchy 
was averted, while across the line, 
in the neighboring state of Colo- 
rado, there was a labor war car- 
ried on for two years, that all but 
wrecked the business interests of 
the people of that state. I say 
again that men who have made 
large investments here, (some of 
them, I regret to say, are using 
their money today to assail the 
very people who constitute this 
safeguard to their interests), feel 



64 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



and know that they are safer right 
here among the Latter-day Saints, 
than their money would be invested 
anywhere else in the world. You 
know this; every thinking man 
knows it. Because of the teach- 
ings of "Mormonism," this feeling 
will grow and increase among men 
who are not of our faith, and your 
good works in this direction will be 
known and appreciated. 

I wish we could get from those 
capitalists a reciprocity of like 
spirit. In settling that coal strike, 
the then governor of the State, 
Heber M. Wells, and those who 
aided him, with the assistance of 
moral force, righteously exercised 
by the Presidency of the Church, 
order was restored and maintain- 
ed. The only return, that I ever 
heard of, that was made for this 
good work done in that connection 
by the people, was that the price of 
coal was raised 25 cents a ton. I 
wish that those who are in control 
of these large interests would man- 
ifest that they appreciate, a little 
bit, that which is done in their be- 
half. Perhaps I ought not to com- 
plain, and I do not complain, but 
I call your attention to the facts. 

I rejoice in the prosperity of our 
country and our Church. This 
part of the country, it would seem, 
is almost too prosperous ; it is dif- 
ficult to hire men anywhere to la- 
bor; there seems to be four or five 
opportunities to work where there 
is one man for the job. 

This Church, my brethren and 
sisters, is growing, and becoming 
a little better understood. Every 
day when the sun goes down, this 
work called "Mormonism" is a lit- 
tle expanded, a little greater, a lit- 
tle stronger than it was when the 
sun rose in the morning. It is 
improving every day; it does not 
take a back seat; it is developing, 



and increasing. The Elders are 
abroad in the world doing a good 
work ; they are faithful, devoted, 
self-sacrificing young men, as you 
heard from President Smith at the 
ooening of our conference; they 
are a credit to you. Everywhere I 
find there is a call for more labor- 
ers in the missionary field; they 
need more. As you know, I had 
the privilege — the great privilege, 
as I esteem it — of traveling with- 
President Smith on his trip to Eu- 
rope, and everywhere we went 
there was the same cry, "We could 
use more young men, more El- 
ders." I returned from that trip 
with this conviction strongly im- 
pressed on my soul, that the noblest 
work, the greatest and best work 
to which I could devote myself and 
my means — and my sons, if thev 
would listen to me — would be the 
preaching of this Gospel, the scat- 
tering of this seed, furthering in 
that way the interests of the cause 
of God, for is it not written that 
"he that will turn many to right- 
eousness shall shine as the stars 
forever and ever." This missionary 
work certainly is one of the most 
important that we can be engaged 
in. 

I have returned impressed with 
the feeling that the Lord, having 
determined to call the attention of 
the world to His work, He will not 
fail ; and if the people will not give 
heed unto Him, as the prophets of 
old have declared, they will have 
to hearken to the voice of "clouds, 
and fire, and vapors of smoke." 
Said the old prophet, speaking for 
the Lord, "They that will not 
hearken unto me shall hearken un- 
to the whirlwind, unto the earth- 
quake, clouds, and fire, and vapors 
of smoke." I am not pessimistic; 
on the contrary, I am naturally 
sanguine and optimistic, but I as-

sert that, just as sure as we are 
here, the Lord will not be mocked. 
Evidences of His displeasure will 
come upon the people. Probably 
you have wished sometimes that 
there might come upon your own 
sons and daughters who were way- 
ward, who though not entirely evil, 
would not listen to your counsel 
concerning what you know is 
best for them ; something- that 
would turn them from their 
waywardness, that would in- 
cline their hearts to the Lord, 
even though it brought suf- 
fering and sorrow upon them, for 
the time being. So also the great 
Father, in His kindness and mercy 
to His earthly children, will bring 
to pass those providences, whether 
it be by fire and cloud, and vapor 
of smoke, or by earthquakes, or 
by the sea heaving itself beyond 
its bounds, by tornados, or other 
calamities of various descriptions, 
■ — or what are seeming calamities, 
but which in reality may turn to 
be blessings. He will call atten- 
tion to His Gospel, and will turn 
the hearts of the people, more and 
more, to this great work. I believe 
it will increase more rapidly from 
this time forward, in fact, I feel 
sure of that. 

I rejoice in the testimony of the 
truth, and the knowledge that God 
lives. I know that Joseph Smith 
was raised up a Prophet of the 
Lord to lay the foundations of this 
work, and that it is being carried 
on by the power of God. Never in 
the history of this Church was 
there a more united feeling than 
there is today among the members, 
a feeling that they will sustain their 
leaders, the First Presidency, the 
Apostles, the Seventies, and all the 
presiding authorities. There is 
more stability today in the souls of 



the Latter-day Saints the world 
over, than has been the case be- 
fore in the history of the Church. 
I believe, from all the information 
I can get, that the people are as 
well satisfied, if not better satis- 
fied — many of them, I will say, are 
better satisfied — with the adminis- 
tration of the affairs of the Church 
today than ever before in our his- 
tory. We know these men whom 
the Lord has called to preside over 
the Church ; we know their devo- 
tion, their self-sacrifice, and that 
their only aim, object and interest 
is to further the work of God. I 
sustain them, I believe you sustain 
them ; and I propose, my breth- 
ren and sisters, that we continue to 
stand by them. God bless you, one 
and all, through Jesus Christ, 
Amen. 



ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS. 

The Gospel a perfect plan of salvation, 
when its precepts are obeyed. — A per- 
fect condition made possible in this 
life by obedience to Gospel laws.— 
Evil-doing denounced. 

I rejoice with you, my beloved 
brethren and sisters, in the privil- 
eges and blessings of this confer- 
ence. I rejoice in seeing the multi- 
tude of Latter-day Saints gathered 
together this beautiful Sabbath 
morning, in conference capacity, to 
worship the Lord. While it is 
somewhat embarrassing to stand 
here, the object of the gaze of ten 
or twelve thousand people, I am 
pleased to have this opportunity, as 
it affords a means of introduction 
to the Latter-day Saints. 

During the past six months I 
have had the privilege of visiting 
eighteen stakes of Zion, and at- 
tending their quarterly confer-

ences ; some of those stakes I have 
visited a second time. I have 
thus formed the acquaintance of 
many valiant Latter-day Saints, 
and have learned somewhat of 
their faithfulness. I love the peo- 
ple as I learn to know their true 
character. It is my desire and 
hope that I may, in the near future, 
have the privilege of visiting the 
other stakes of Zion. I want to in- 
crease my acquaintances among the 
faithful Latter-day Saints, for I 
love the men and the women who 
worship God, and love the religion 
we have mutually embraced. I de- 
sire to know the Latter-day Saints 
better and more extensively than 
hitherto, and I wish the Latter-day 
Saints to know me. I desire to 
have their confidence, their prayers, 
and their support, so that if, by 
the help of the Lord, I may be able 
to give them some good counsel 
occasionally they will not hesitate 
to accept it. 

The Lord has very generously 
blessed us during the meetings of 
this conference ; His Spirit has 
been poured out upon us in great 
abundance, in great richness and 
power ; and those who have spoken 
have been led by Its influence. We 
have been edified, comforted and 
encouraged by what we have heard, 
and the Spirit of the Lord has im- 
pressed upon our minds and hearts 
the truths which have been spoken. 
We have also been edified by the 
thoughts which have arisen in our 
minds, as a result of what we have 
heard from those who have spoken 
under the promptings of the Spirit 
of the Lord. I firmly believe that 
one of the most fruitful sources 
of spiritual education lies in the 
thoughts which arise in our own 
hearts, perhaps apart and inde- 



pendent of that which we are lis- 
tening to. We are fed upon the 
bread of life by the Spirit of the 
Lord, and I feel that we have been 
so fed at this conference. 

The Gospel presents to us a 
most beautiful picture, and it seems 
to me that the picture was never 
quite so beautiful before, as it has 
presented itself to my mind during 
the meetings of this conference. 
The moral and religious code em- 
braced in the Gospel of the Lord 
Jesus Christ, as taught by the Lat- 
ter-day Saints, is of the highest 
character ; it emanated from God 
Himself, from the heavens above, 
and Jesus Christ our Savior was 
the Great Exponent. The Gospel 
is without defect, it is a perfect 
plan ; it is God's own guide to a 
perfect life ; and there is infinite 
power within it, the power to save 
those who will yield obedience to 
its precepts, ordinances, laws and 
doctrines. It is the plan by which 
our Savior lived, by which He 
reached perfection, through which 
He ascended to the Father, and is 
now enjoying the glories of His 
kingdom. It is the plan that 
through obedience thereto, will 
bring us back into His presence, 
and crown us heirs to His glory. 
This is what it can do for every- 
one of our Heavenly Father's 
children. It is offered for our sal- 
vation, but it is left with us to ac- 
cept or reject it. The law is given ; 
the plan is offered, but it will profit 
us nothing unless we accept it. The 
great mission work of our Savior, 
His atonement, will not profit us 
anything if we do not live the law, 
except that we are brought forth 
from the grave, as are all our 
Father's children, for "as in Adam 
all die, so in Christ are all made 
alive." We cannot hope to be ben- 



ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS. 



67 



efited in any other way ; neither can 
we hope to be benefited by what we 
hear from the servants of the Lord, 
if we do not practice the precepts 
in our lives, that is the only way 
we can be profited by what we 
hear. We are not now so much in 
need of being taught the Gospel, 
and our duties as members of the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints, as we are in need of 
being impressed with the necessity 
of living the law, according to the 
light and knowledge we have al- 
ready received. Some of us may 
be disposed to be hearers of the 
word alone, and not doers of it ; 
and in this we are deceiving our- 
selves. When the Savior preached 
that famous sermon upon the 
mount, the greatest ever preached 
upon the earth, He thought it nec- 
essary to warn the people, that 
those who hear those sayings and 
do them not, are like unto a fool- 
ish man who built his house upon 
the sand, and when the rains de- 
scended, and the winds blew, and 
the floods came, and beat upon the 
house, it fell because it was built 
upon sand ; but all those who hear 
those sayings and do them, are like 
unto a wise man who built his 
house upon a rock, and when the 
storms came, and the winds blew, 
and the floods beat upon the house 
it fell not, for it was built upon a 
firm foundation. The Savior could 
see the weakness of the people, that 
thev were disposed xo imagine it 
proper for their neighbors to live 
according to the doctrine that was 
taught, but considered that it was 
not aoplicable to themselves. 

It is a fact today, that many are 
not living according to the light 
which God has imparted. If all 
were living up to the light which 
the Gospel gives there would be 



a great change ; a great reforma- 
tion would be wrought. Those 
who would do this would become 
stronger and more vigorous in 
body and mind; their intelligence 
would be quickened, their minds 
enlightened to comprehend the 
truth ; and they would transmit to 
their children qualities and virtues 
that would tend to regenerate the 
race, restoring former conditions, 
when the life of a man was as the 
life of a tree. If all were living up 
to that standard today, there would 
be no grog-shops and saloons in 
our cities. They would be forced 
to close their doors for want of pat- 
ronage. There would be no sale 
for tobacco, for tea, or coffee, and 
all the evil effects that result from 
using these obnoxious things would 
be eliminated. The summer re- 
sorts would have to close on the 
Sabbath day, for the people would 
be found in houses of worship, and 
the meeting houses would be too 
small to accommodate them. 

If all who profess to be Latter- 
day Saints would live in conform- 
ity to the Gospel, in all respects, 
we would have to build larger 
stake tabernacles, to accommodate 
the people who would come to at- 
tend the stake conferences to hear 
the word of the "Lord, to worship 
Him in His appointed way, to par- 
take of the sacrament, the emblems 
of the body and blood of Christ 
who died for us. The temples, also, 
would be too small to accommodate 
the people who would gather there 
to work vicariously for the re- 
demption of their kindred dead. If 
all were living up to the high stand- 
ard of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, 
we would have to build more tem- 
ples ; and our people would be go- 
ing to the ends of the earth, spend- 
ing their means liberally to gather 



68 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



the genealogies of their kindred. 
There would be less difficulty in 
getting Elders to go abroad and 
preach the gospel, under these con- 
ditions, for the love that men 
would have in their hearts for their 
fellow men would lead them, in 
greater numbers, to volunteer their 
services. We love the God we 
worship, and give evidence of that 
love by assembling in our meeting 
houses and worshiping Him with 
full purpose of heart. We evidence 
our love by keeping' His command- 
ments, and by loving one another, 
indulging in no back-biting, nor 
evil speaking of each other, no 
bearing of false witness against 
our neighbors. 

If all of us were living up to 
the high standard of the Gospel, 
even our enemies — those who fight 
against us — would have our love 
and prayers, for the Gospel of 
Jesus Christ teaches us to love our 
enemies, to pray for those who 
hate us and who despitefully use 
us. Though they were to perse- 
cute, rob and plunder, mob and 
drive, bind us in chains and cast 
us into dungeons, we would not 
feel to curse them, but under the 
Gospel law, we would pity them, 
realizing that, when the judgment 
of God is poured out, they will in- 
deed need our pity. Even if they 
should put us to death for the 
Gospel's sake, if we were living up 
to this high standard our last 
words would be, as with the Sa- 
vior: "Father forgive them, for 
they know not what they do." 

God has been most gracious and 
generous to us ; He has borne tes- 
timony to us, through His Spirit, 
that this Gospel is true. We have 
learned, and know for a surety, 
that the promises which the Lord 
has made us will never fail. If 



we were to call upon this congre- 
gation and ask those who have re- 
ceived this testimony to rise to their 
feet and say so, there would be a 
host who could rise and respond. 
There are some, however, I am sor- 
ry to say, who profess to know 
these things, who do not live up to- 
them as they ought. In their lives 
there is a degree of inconsistency, 
and when the enemies of this work 
declare that among us there is hy- 
pocrisy and deceit, lying and 
wrong-doing, that we are not true 
to what we profess, there is per- 
haps a grain of truth in the charge. 
The lives of everyone enrolled on 
the records of the Church should 
be such that every act would give 
the lie to all such calumnies ; but 
reproach rests upon the Church to- 
day because of infirmities, incon- 
sistency, lack of faith and integrity 
to the truth, manifest by some ; 
this to their shame. May the Lord 
be merciful unto those whom He 
has so abundantly blessed, and who 
are yet so ungrateful for His mer- 
cies and blessings. 

It is a source of much regret that 
among the stakes of Zion we occa- 
sionally find a man of experience, 
who has lived years in the Church, 
and seen the trials through which 
this people has passed, how the 
arm of Jehovah has been made 
bare in their behalf, yet who 
will stoop to the use of tobacco, 
and indulge in habits that are un- 
clean, that render him impure be- 
fore the Lord, and his tabernacle, 
consequently, an unfit receptacle for 
the Spirit of God. Our heavenly 
Father has designed that His Spirit 
should dwell in us to comfort and 
cheer us in our onward march 
through life, in times of adversity, 
to give us strength and courage to 
bear up faithfully under all trials 



ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS.

that may be brought upon us, that 
we ma}' maintain our integrity to 
the end. This is the purpose of 
the Lord, who desires our salva- 
tion. He would lead us unto 
eternal life, but there are some re- 
bellious, and will not be led, who 
break His commandments, disre- 
gard His wishes ; and render them- 
selves unfit receptacles for the Spir- 
it of God. They plod along through 
life in darkness, subject to the 
powers of evil which are about us, 
subject to the influences of those 
who would lead us astray. 

What a responsibility rests upon 
parents in Israel, whose duty it is 
to train and teach their children 
the principles of eternal life, and 
set before them examples worthy 
of imitation, to be as watchmen 
over their homes — as shepherds 
watch their flocks — to see that the 
evil one does not enter and poison 
the minds of those whom God 
has given them. These responsi- 
bilities weigh heavily upon us, and 
if we disregard them it will prove 
to our sorrow. If we lose these 
children whom the Lord has given 
us, we lose one by one the jewels 
from the crown the Lord has pre- 
pared for us if we are faithful and 
true. If we neglect our duties we 
deprive ourselves of blessings in 
this life and in the life to come. 

We should be on guard against 
the influences that come among us, 
from Babylon. The Lord has said : 
"Come out of her my people, that 
ye be not partakers of her sins, that 
ye receive not of her plagues." 
Notwithstanding this requirement 
and the knowledge that in coming 
out of Babylon we acquire her en- 
mity, that those who are not of us 
are constantly fighting against us, 
yet there is danger if too closely 
.affiliated with them, some may be 



induced to accept their theories, 
and adopt their fashions. There 
are foolish ones eagerly looking 
forward to ascertain what Baby- 
lon — "the mother of harlots, the 
whore of all the earth" — is going 
to introduce next among us, and 
they want to be the first to adopt 
it. The Latter-day Saints should 
remember they are to be the salt of 
the earth, the leaven with which 
the whole lump is to be leavened — 
the whole lump of humanity ; that 
is the design and purpose of the 
Lord concerning us. We should 
adopt proper fashions for ourselves, 
and not follow the fashions that are 
brought among us from Babylon. 

Some of the Babylonish fashions 
of today are of a most deadly na- 
ture, and are aiding Lucifer in his 
purpose to thwart the purposes of 
the Almighty. When you go into 
the homes of some fashionable peo- 
ple of the world today, instead of 
finding children there, as you find 
in the homes of Latter-day Saints 
you see poodle dogs, pussy cats, 
canary birds, things which can be 
tethered to a string and left in a 
corner. Not having children to 
care for, the ladies are at liberty 
to attend clubs and society meet- 
ings, and go to the resorts and 
public places of pleasure as often 
as they wish. Such people ignore 
the great commandment that we 
should unite in honorable wedlock 
for time and for eternity, that we 
should multiply and increase in the 
land, and replenish the earth. There 
is no greater commandment — a dis- 
regard of it would thwart the whole 
plan and purpose of Jehovah. I 
regard with horror the thought of 
falling into this fashion, or adopt- 
ing any of the customs which are 
set before us by Babylon, and 
which would result in our over- 



70 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



throw and destruction. Oh surely 
we cannot be so unwise, so indif- 
ferent to the counsels of the Holy 
Priesthood. 

I testify to you today, my breth- 
ren and sisters, that this Gospel is 
true, that it is the saving power 
and that those who will yield obe- 
dience to its principles will be sav- 
ed and exalted in the presence of 
God. There is nothing truer, there 
can be nothing truer. This Gospel 
is as true as the stars of heaven, 
as true as the sun which shines in 
midday, as enduring as the ever- 
lasting hills, and is without defect; 
it is suited to the conditions of all 
men in all ages, in all circumstances 
and conditions of life, and it needs 
not to be modified, amended or 
changed. I testify that Joseph 
Smith was a Prophet of God; I 
know that, although I never saw 
him. I know it as Peter knew that 
Jesus was the Christ — because God 
revealed it unto him. Who can 
see the mighty results of the proc- 
lamation of Gospel truths, the 
fruits that have come forth from 
the tree and then condemn the 
tree? He is a disbeliever in the 
word of God who can do so. 

I pray the blessings of the Lord 
to be with you, my brethren and 
sisters. May His peace abide with 
you in your homes. May God's 
blessings attend us in the continu- 
ance of this conference, I humbly 
pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 

The choir sang the anthem, 
"Rouse, O ye Mortals."

The spirit of poesy seems to 
have pervaded this conference to- 
some extent, and perhaps that will 
account for a little stanza that is 
now floating through my mind : 

"Break! Break! Break! 

On thy cold gray stones, O sea! 
And I would that my heart could utter 

The thoughts that arise in me." 

Many good things have been said 
by the various speakers who have 
addressed the congregations, and 
it would be difficult indeed to de- 
cide which are the most important 
or the most edifying. The main 
difficulty with a speaker at 
conference time is not to- 
find a subject, but rather 
to select one from the many 
that are presented to the mind, and 
to so condense his thoughts and his 
words as to come within the allot- 
ted time. I hope that I may have 
the good Spirit to inspire me, that I 
may speak the things most needful 
to be spoken. I have no other desire 
than to declare the truth, as God 
shall give me utterance. 

I was very much impressed, upon 
the opening day, with the address 
of President Joseph F. Smith, and 
particularly with what he said in 
relation to the kingdom whose king 
is Jesus Christ. I have also been 
impressed with what Brother Nib- 
ley has said regarding the purpose, 
spirit, and mission of what the 
world terms "Mormonism ;" and I 
marvel, in the light of such utter- 
ances, and in the light of what I 
know to be true concerning this 
people and this religion, that the

grossest of misunderstandings and 
misconceptions can and do exist in 
relation to them. It was alleged dur- 
ing the life-time of the Prophet 
Joseph Smith, that he wished to 
make himself a king, to possess 
himself of the properties of both 
Mormons and Gentiles, as his sub- 
jects, and to ride roughshod over 
their liberties. It has been assert- 
ed from the beginning that "Mor- 
monism" seeks to overthrow free 
institutions, to overturn the gov- 
ernment of the United States, and 
to set up, in this land of the free, an 
Asiatic despotism. I marvel at 
such charges as these. It is diffi- 
cult for me — anxious as I am to 
credit all men with honesty and 
sincerity, wherever I can — to be- 
lieve that such charges are made in 
sincerity. 

What is this thing called "Mor- 
monism ?" You have heard during 
this conference that it is what Paul, 
the apostle, declared the Gospel of 
Christ to be: "the power of God 
unto salvation." Paul also main- 
tained that the Gospel is "the per- 
fect law of liberty." What he said ' 
of the gospel of Christ is true of 
"Mormonism," for they are one 
and the same thing under different 
names. Hence, "Mormonism" is 
"the perfect law of liberty," and is 
itself a free institution. Why then 
should it be charged with seeking 
its own overthrow? 

Joseph Smith taught that the 
Gospel was of heavenly origin. He 
said that God, in the beginning, 
finding Himself in the midst of 
spirits and glory, and being the 
most intelligent of them all, saw 
fit to institute laws whereby the 
rest might advance like Himself. 
Here was the first exhibition of 
tyranny, of despotism, in the his- 
tory of "Mormonism," when God 
decreed that laws should be insti- 



tuted whereby the blessings en- 
joyed by Him might be extended 
to and enjoyed by those around 
Him — the lesser intelligences who 
looked up to Him for guidance. 
He, as their God, ordained a way 
whereby they might advance and 
become like Him, making possible 
the final attainment of a glory de- 
scribed as the fulness of the pres- 
ence of the Father, where He 
makes us equal with Himself, and 
places in our hands the possession 
of all things. Joseph Smith taught 
that before the world was, this plan 
of salvation, known as the Gospel— 
and now nick-named "Mormonism" 
— was instituted and ordained as 
the means of saving the world, of' 
doing for man that which he could 
not do for himself, redeeming him 
from the bondage of sin and death, 
and restoring him to the presence 
of God, from which he fell through 
transgression. Does this look 'like 
tyranny? Does it bear any sem- 
blance of despotism? Is there ap- 
parent in this great plan, having 
such an object, any design to over- 
throw the freedom of man ? No ! 
My brethren and sisters, you know, 
as I know, that Jesus Christ is the 
author of liberty, that He is the 
great champion of human freedom, 
and that He laid down His life that 
the world might be free. 

It is Lucifer, on the other hand 
who seeks the overthrow of free 
institutions, free churches, free 
government, and who saps wher- 
ever he can the foundation of the 
rights of man. That same fallen 
being, once called the Morning 
Star, presented himself before the 
Father, at the beginning, and of- 
fered himself as a candidate for the 
saviorship of this world. He de- 
clared — had the audacity to de- 
clare — that his purpose was to save 
man in his sins. "Not one soul

shall be lost." ' He proposed to 
compel all to be saved, and sought 
to destroy the free agency of man. 
But his plan was rejected, and he 
and all who followed him were cast 
out of heaven, because they were 
the enemies of freedom and sought 
the overthrow of that freest of in- 
stitutions, the Gospel of salvation. 
Therefore they were rejected, and 
one was chosen -as the Redeemer 
who avowed it to be His purpose 
to maintain the free agency of man. 
This One sought not His own hon- 
or, his own glory, as Lucifer had 
done — who demanded as a reward 
for his proposed service that he 
might dethrone the Father and 
reign as God in his stead, but that 
other Being said : "Father, let me 
be thy Son ; I will go down ; I will 
die for the world, and thine be the 
honor and the glory." He propos- 
ed to save man from his sins to 
make salvation a free gift, to 
leave all men at liberty to accept 
or reject the Gospel, and the pur- 
pose of his mission was to break the 
bands of death, to redeem man 
from bondage, and therefore His 
plan is known, and truly known, 
as the perfect law of liberty. 

The Gospel was revealed first to 
our father Adam, whom it re- 
deemed from the fall and restored 
to the presence of God. After his 
descendants became degenerate, it 
was revealed to Enoch, whose city 
was taken into the heavens. Later 
in another dispensation, it came to 
Noah, who preached it to the world 
and succeeded in saving eight souls, 
including his own. After his day, 
Abraham had the Gospel ; Abra- 
ham, the head of the house of Is- 
rael, through whom the Savior 
came in the flesh, and by means of 
whose descendants the blood of 
faith was sprinkled over many na- 
tions ; a scattering of Israel prepar- 



atory to the great gathering of 
Israel in the last days. Then Moses 
had the Gospel, and sought by 
means of it and the powers 
of the Holy Priesthood, to 
bring his people into a con- 
dition where they could look, as 
he had looked, upon the face of 
God; but they would not have it. 
That generation would not accept 
the Gospel, and it was taken away, 
as it had been taken many times 
before, and the powers of the Mel- 
chisedek priesthood went back into 
the heavens, and Israel was left 
with the Aaronic priesthood and 
the law of carnal commandments, 
to whip him as a schoolmaster un- 
til the days of Christ. Then came 
our Savior, restoring the ancient 
faith, the everlasting and un- 
changeable plan of salvation, 
framed in the heavens, Himself be- 
ing the author of it ; for He was 
no other than the king of heaven, 
Jehovah, the God of Israel. He 
came as a babe into the world, and 
grew to manhood without sin, un- 
to salvation, showing what man can 
*do if he will, even in this mortal 
state. He laid down His life to 
break the bands of death, to re- 
deem man from the effects of the 
fall of Adam and Eve. He chose 
twelve apostles to establish his 
Church upon the eastern hemi- 
sphere, and then came in His res- 
urrected body to the western hemi- 
sphere, where He also selected 
twelve disciples to establish his 
Church upon this chosen land. But 
the world again departed from the 
faith, and in the last days God 
raised up another prophet, another 
champion of truth and liberty, and 
he,stancling at the head of the great- 
est and last of the gospel dispensa- 
tions, preaching no new doctrine, 
but proclaiming the old-time prin- 
ciples, the eternal principles of

freedom ; he, Joseph Smith, was ac- 
cused of seeking to make himself 
a king. 

I say of all these prophets, these 
apostles, these patriarchs, who 
have stood at the head of or fig- 
ured in the dispensations of the 
past, that they are the friends of 
freedom, the champions of liberty, 
reflecting the light and power of 
Jesus Christ. And I say also that 
a measure of that same light and 
power, has rested upon other men, 
upon poets and philosophers, upon 
warriors and reformers, upon sci- 
entists, inventors and discoverers ; 
who have played their parts ac- 
cording to the light given 
them, and have helped to 
prepare the way for the great 
consummation of the latter-days, 
when the restitution of all things is 
in prospect and in progress ; when 
God has decreed to pour out His 
spirit upon all flesh, and gather into 
one all things in Christenings in the 
heavens and things upon the earth. 

Luther had a portion of this spirit 
when he stood before the Diet of 
Worms, and being asked to recant 
what he had uttered, laid his hand 
upon the open Bible, faced a 
frowning tyrant, and exclaimed : 
"Here I stand ; I cannot do other- 
wise; God help me!" Cromwell 
and his Ironsides were animated 
by a portion of this spirit when 
they arrayed themselves against a 
despot king, and ended by cutting 
off his head. William of Orange 
was inspired by it, when he suc- 
ces fully met the encroachments of 
the Spanish invader, and battled 
for the freedom of the Netherlands. 
Columbus had this spirit when he 
"pushed his prows into the setting 
sun, made west east," and uncov- 
ered this long hidden hemisphere, 
the land of Zion, the land of Jos- 
• eph, where the house of Joseph is 



to assemble and the New Jerusalem 
to rise. Washington had this spirit 
when he carved out with the sword 
of patriotism the independence of 
his country; "the embattled farm- 
ers" had it when they poured their 
patriot volleys into the ranks of 
the British regulars on the slopes of 
Bunker Hill. Jefferson had this 
spirit when he wrote with pen of 
flame, "All men are created equal, 
and to secure the rights of life, lib- 
erty and the pursuit of happiness, 
governments are instituted among 
men, deriving their just powers 
from the consent of the governed." 
Joseph Smith, in far greater meas- 
ure, possessed this spirit of liberty, 
this love of freedom, and there is 
nothing in his life, in his character, 
nor in the whole history of the 
Mormon people that is contrary 
thereto. 

Who was this man Joseph 
Smith? He was a native Ameri- 
can ; a descendant of the pilgrims, 
and of the patriots whom God in- 
spired to found this nation. He lov- 
ed his country ; drank in the spirit 
of liberty with his mother's milk, 
and was taught its principles at his 
mother's knee. Why should he 
seek to be a king, to overthrow 
free institutions, to plot for the 
ruin of his country? On the con- 
trary, he sought the glory of his 
country. The last and crowning 
act of his life, politically, was an 
endeavor to become president of 
the United States ; and in the plat- 
form of principles by him enunci- 
ated, he favored the extension of 
the Union, with the consent of the 
red man — yes, he even thought of 
the poor Indian and his rights — 
with the consent of the red man, 
he favored the extension of the 
Union from sea to sea. He also fa- 
vored the annexation of Texas, of 
Mexico, of Canada, whenever they

should'desire it — so anxious was he 
to spread the benefits and blessings 
of free government. And yet this 
man could be falsely accused of 
seeking to make himself a king. 

The institutions of the Church 
that Joseph founded breathe the 
same spirit of liberty, the same re- 
spect for the rights of man, that 
characterize the government of 
the United States, also God-in- 
spired. You saw an exhibition of 
this fact yesterday. You saw sub- 
mitted the names of men who bear 
the Holy Priesthood, who have 
held sacred positions in the midst 
of this people for a lifetime ; you 
saw their names submitted here, for 
the people to manifest whether or 
not they would still accept them as 
their leaders, their spiritual teach- 
ers. That practice has prevailed 
in this Church from the beginning. 
Joseph Smith, who had looked up- 
on the face of God ; Oliver Cow- 
dery, who with Joseph had seen an- 
gels and been ordained by them to 
the Aaronic and Melchisedek 
priesthoods — they, after all, were 
required by the will and the 
word of God to submit their names 
to the little flock which they had 
converted, to see whether or not 
they would sustain them as the first 
and second Elders of the Church. 
The doctrine of common consent, 
"the consent of the governed," 
which Thomas Jefferson proclaim- 
ed in the Declaration of Independ- 
ence, and which is practiced in all 
the electoral concerns of the Amer- 
ican people — this same doctrine is 
practiced in the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints; and 
yet this Church is charged with 
seeking the overthrow of free insti- 
tutions. 

Joseph Smith wrote with his own 
hand the Articles of Faith for this 



Church, and the 11th and 12th arti- 
cles read as follows : 

"We claim the privilege of worship- 
ing Almighty God according to the dic- 
tates of our conscience, and allow all 
men the same privilege, let them wor- 
ship how, where, or what they may." 

"We believe in being subject to 
kings, presidents, rulers, and magistrates, 
in obeying, honoring and sustaining the 
law." 

Let me now read a notable utter- 
ance of Joseph Smith's, showing 
what he thought of tyranny and 
unrighteous dominion : 

"Behold, there arc many called, but 
few are chosen. And why are they not 
chosen ? 

"Because their hearts are set so much 
upon 'the things of this world, and aspire 
to the honors of men, that they do 
not learn this one lesson — 

'That the rights of the Priesthood 
are inseparably connected with the pow- 
ers of heaven, and that the powers of 
heaven cannot be controlled nor handled 
only upon the principles of righteous- 
ness. 

"That they may be conferred upon us, 
it is true; but when we undertake to 
cover our sins, or to gratify our pride, 
our vain ambition, or to exercise con- 
trol, or dominion, or compulsion, upon 
the souls of the children of men, in any 
degree of unrighteousness, behold, the 
heavens withdraw themselves; the Spirit 
of the Lord is grieved ; and when it is 
withdrawn. Amen to the Priesthood, or 
the authority of that man. 

"Behold! ere he is aware, he is left 
unto himself, to kick against the pricks; 
to persecute the saints, and to fight 
against God. 

"We have learned, by sad experience, 
that it is the nature and disposition of 
almost all men, as soon as they get a 
little authority, as they suppose, they 
will immediately begin to exercise un- 
righteous dominion. 

"Hence many are called, but few are 
chosen. 

"No power or influence can or ought 
to be maintained by virtue of the 
Priesthood, only by persuasion, by long: 
suffering, by gentleness, and meekness, 
and by love unfeigned ; 

"By kindness, and pure knowledge, .

which shall greatly enlarge the soul 
without hypocrisy, and without guile, 

"Reproving betimes with sharpness, 
when moved upon by the Holy Ghost, 
and then showing forth afterwards an 
increase of love toward him whom 
thou hast reproved, lest he esteem thee 
to be his enemy ; 

"That he may know that thy faithful- 
ness is stronger than the cords of death ; 

"Let thy bowels also be full of charity 
towards all men, and to the household 
of faith, and let virtue garnish thy 
thoughts unceasingly, then shall thy con- 
fidence wax strong in the presence of 
God, and the doctrine of the Priesthood 
shall distil upon thy soul as the dews 
from heaven. 

"The Holy Ghost shall be thy con- 
stant companion, and thy sceptre an un- 
changing sceptre of righteousness and 
truth, and thy dominion shall be an 
everlasting dominion, and without com- 
pulsory means it shall flow unto thee 
for ever and ever." — Doctrine and Cove- 
nants, 121: 34-46. 

Another brief selection from the 
same book: 

"Therefore, it is not right that any 
man should be in bondage one to an- 
other. 

"And for this purpose have I estab- 
lished the constitution of this land, by 
the hands of wise men whom I raised 
up unto this very purpose, and redeem- 
ed the land by the shedding of blood." 
—Doctrine and Covenants, 101 : 79, 80. 

These are among the principles 
taught by Joseph Smith. The Doc- 
trine and Covenants, the Book of 
Mormon, every record that ema- 
nated from the mind of that great 
man, bears testimony to the divin- 
ity of the principle of liberty and 
declares for the free agency of man. 
From the Book of Mormon I will 
read one paragraph, to show the 
spirit of that ancient record, and 
the spirit of the man who trans- 
lated it. I will say here that the 
entire Book of Mormon is one 
great plea for liberty, one mighty 
protest against tyranny and wrong. 
Here is a promise of the Lord to an 



ancient prophet among the Ne- 
phites, regarding this land, North 
and South America, which Joseph 
Smith declared to be the land of 
Zion : 

"And this land shall be a land of lib- 
erty unto the Gentiles, and there shall 
be no kings upon this land, who shall 
raise up unto the Gentiles ; 

"And I will fortify this land against 
all other nations ; 

"And he that fighteth against Zion 
shall perish, saith God, 

"For he that raiseth up a king against 
me shall perish, for I, the Lord, the 
King of Heaven, will be their king, and 
I will be a light unto them forever, that 
hear my words." — II Nephi, 10: 11-14. 

Does any sane man believe that 
Joseph Smith would have sent 
forth such a proclamation, would 
have published it to the world, 
and then have sought in this land 
of liberty to make himself a king? 

Perhaps this is sufficient. Pres- 
ident Smith was speaking by the 
record when he declared that Jesus 
Christ is the king of this kingdom ; 
it is not Joseph the Prophet, it is 
not Brigham Young, nor John 
Taylor, nor Wilford Woodruff, 
nor Lorenzo Snow ; it is not Jos- 
eph F. Smith ; it is not any man. 
There shall come no king upon 
this land until Christ, the king of 
heaven, comes in power and glory 
to reign over the earth. He is our 
king, the only king we recognize,, 
the only king we serve, and these 
men are servants of the King, for 
whose coming we are here to pre- 
pare. 

This theme is interminable ; I 
could go on for hours and tell you 
of the feelings and sentiments that 
animated Brigham Young and his 
successors, but let this one fact 
suffice; that all who have led this 
Church from the days of Joseph 
Smith down to this day, have only 
built upon Joseph's foundation and

reiterated the principles that were 
near and dear to his heart, princi- 
ples revealed to him by the God of 
Heaven, Jesus Christ, the King. 

There is only one element of 
compulsion in the dealings of God 
with man, and it will never coerce 
the human mind. It is illustrated 
in the word of God spoken to the 
early Elders of this Church, in ful- 
filment of a parable of our Savior, 
the one in which He likened the 
kingdom of heaven unto a feast : 

"A certain man made a great sup- 
per, and bade many : 

"And sent his servant at supper time 
to say to them that were bidden, Come ; 
for all things are now ready. 

"And they all with one consent be- 
gan to make excuse. The first said 
unto him, I have bought a piece of 
ground, and I must needs go and see it : 
I pray thee have me excused. 

"And another said, I have bought 
five yoke of oxen, and I go to prove 
them: I pray thee have me excused. 

"And another said, I have married 
a wife, and therefore I cannot come. 

"So that servant came, and showed 
his lord these things. Then the master 
of the house being angry said to his 
servant, Go out quickly into the streets 
and lanes of the city, and bring in hither 
the poor, and the maimed, and the halt, 
and the blind. 

"And the servant said, Lord, it is done 
as thou hast commanded, and yet there 
is room. 

"And the lord said unto the servant, 
Go out into the highways and hedges, 
and comoel them to come in, that my 
house may be filled." — Luke, 14: 16-23. 

What ! Compel men to be saved ? 
God coerce the human mind? Nev- 
er ! And yet they were compelled 
to come. The literal meaning of 
this parable is embodied in a com- 
mandment to the Elders of the 
Church in these days, repeating the 
great command of our Lord to His 
servants two thousand years ago . 

"Go ye into all the world and preach 
the gospel to every creature. 

"He that believeth and is baptized 



shall be saved, but he that believeth not 
shall be damned. 

"And these signs shall follow them 
that believe: In my name shall they 
cast out devils ; they shall speak with 
new tongues ; 

"They shall take up serpents ; and if 
they drink any deadly thing it shall not 
hurt them; they shall lay hands on the 
sick and they shall recover." — Mark, 16: 
15-18. 

These words were repeated 
through Joseph the Seer, and then 
followed other words, not spoken 
aforetime, but reserved unto the 
latter days, when the judgments 
of God should supplement the tes- 
timony of the Elders. "And after 
your testimony cometh the testi- 
mony of earthquakes, and tempests, 
and wars, and famines, and pesti- 
lences, and the voice of the waves 
of the sea heaving themselves be- 
yond their bounds." "All things 
shall be in commotion," and "not 
only the earth shall shake, but the 
starry heavens shall tremble." 

That is how God will compel 
men to listen to Him, if they turn 
a deaf ear to the voice of kind per- 
suasion. Lie will not coerce the 
mind, but will create conditions and 
shape circumstances that will in- 
duce men to come unto Him and of 
their own accord bow in obedience 
to His holy will. Meanwhile, 
it is for this people to abide 
in the liberty wherewith they 
are made free, to lift up 
an ensign of peace to all nations, 
to return good for evil, blessings 
for cursings, and leave their cause 
in the hands of that God who in- 
spired an American poet to write : 

"Truth forever on the scaffold; 

Wrong forever on the throne; 
Yet that scaffold sways the future, 

And behind the dim unknown 
Standeth God within the shadow, 

Keeping watch above His own."

Apostle George Teasdale presided. 
Prof. Charles J. Thomas conducted 
the singing. 

The congregation sang the hymn, 

On the mountain's top appearing, 
Lo, the sacred herald stands ! 

Welcome news to Zion bearing, 
Zion, long in hostile lands. 

Prayer was offered by Elder Hy-

Hailing a future of freedom and 
light ; 

Angels above us are silent notes tak-

Of every actoin ; do what is right ! 



ELDER JAMES Gr. DUFFIN. 

(President of Central States 
Mission.) 

I feel grateful, my brothers and 
sisters, for the blessings I have en- 
joyed during this conference, in 
meeting with you in Zion, 
and in listening to the words 
of counsel, instruction and in- 
spiration, as they have fallen 
from the lips of the servants of the 



Lord. We, who have spent many 
years in the world as missionaries, 
separated from the body of the 
Church, can fully appreciate, I be- 
lieve, the association of our breth- 
ren and sisters, when we come to 
attend these general conferences 
of the Church. The words that 
were uttered by our beloved Pres- 
ident, Joseph F. Smith, at the be- 
ginning of this conference, cer- 
tainly must have inspired the souls 
of everyone who loves the work of 
the Lord, with a determination that 
they will be more true, if possible, 
and more devoted to the eternal 
principles that God has revealed 
for the salvation of His children. 
I felt, this morning that I should 
like to read to you a few words 
from a revelation given to Isaiah 
the Prophet concerning this great 
latter-day work, and the joy and 
satisfaction that it would bring into 
the souls of those who .would re- 
ceive God's word, humble them- 
selves before Him, and render obe- 
dience unto the sacred ordinances 
He has revealed from heaven. I 
read from the twenty-ninth chap- 
ter of Isaiah : "And in that day," 
(speaking of the time when God 
was to do a marvelous work and 
a wonder among the people of the 
world) "shall the deaf hear the 
words of the book, and the eyes 
of the blind shall see out of ob- 
scurity, and out of darknes. The 
meek also shall increase their joy 
in the Lord, and the poor among 
men shall rejoice in the Holy One 
of Israel. For the terrible one is 
brought to nought, and the scorner 
is consumed, and all that watch for 
iniquity are cut off : That make a 
man an offender for a word, and 
lay a snare for him that reproveth 
in the gate, and turn aside the just 
for a thing of nought." 



78 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Upon those who would receive 
the Gospel that God was to estab- 
lish upon this earth, to them it was 
to bring joy and peace. They were 
to rejoice in the Holy One of Is- 
rael, their minds should be enlight- 
ened, their ears unstopped to hear, 
so that they might understand the 
principles God should reveal, and 
because of this, joy and peace 
should enter into their souls. To 
those who love lies rather than the 
truth, because their deeds are evil, 
it should bring hatred into their 
hearts, their voices and their hands 
should be raised against the doc- 
trines of righteousness and against 
God's anointed. But He left on 
record the prediction that they 
would not prosper in their evil 
ways, neither should the wicked- 
ness of their hearts prevail over 
these eternal principles of truth, 
which He had revealed, nor should 
they prevail over those who render 
obedience unto those principles. 

Now, I want to call your atten- 
tion to another promise that the 
Lord made through another one of 
His servants, who lived many hun- 
dreds of years after the time that 
He gave this revelation unto His 
servant Isaiah. I will not stop to 
read it to you, but will quote from 
the revelation given to the beloved 
disciple of our Lord and Master 
while a prisoner upon the Isle of 
Patmos. He says, "And I saw an- 
other angel flying in the midst of 
heaven, having the everlasting gos- 
pel to preach unto them that dwell 
on the earth, and to every nation, 
and kindred, and tonsme, and peo- 
ple, saying with a loud voice, Fear 
God and give glory to him ; for the 
hour of His judgment is come ; and 
worship Him that made heaven, 
and earth, and the sea, and the 
fountains of waters." 



Now, my brothers and sisters, 
here are two promises that our 
Father in heaven authorized His 
servant to record concerning the 
great work that He was to do in the 
latter days. It was to be restored 
to the earth by an angel — a mes- 
senger sent from the courts of 
glory. When this message should 
come to the earth, it was to bring 
joy and peace unto the souls of 
those who would receive it. Our 
Father in heaven has always sent 
His messengers to men whom He 
has chosen, because of their pre- 
existent faithfulness, and they come 
to the earth in the time that God 
had appointed for them to be here. 
These messengers had to come to 
the chosen instruments of the Lord, 
to deliver their messages and be- 
stow authority from heaven, and 
by this authority has this message 
gone forth among the nations of 
the earth, in these latter days. 
In fulfillment of these promises 
God has sent messengers in these 
days, first preceded by His own 
glorious appearance, and that of 
His beloved Son, Jesus Christ. 
These messengers have brought the 
Gospel of eternal life. They aopear- 
ed unto Joseph Smith, the Prophet, 
and his fellow-servant, Oliver Cow- 
dery, laid, their hands upon the 
heads of those men and conferred 
upon them the authority of the 
Holy Priesthood. Thus endowed 
with power from on high, these 
men went out among the people ; 
they taught the ways of life ; they 
administered sacred ordinances un- 
to those who would receive this glo- 
rious blessing, by which they were 
brought into the Church and be- 
came members of the kingdom of 
God. And others were called to the 
work of the ministry, and they also 
went out with this message of a re-

-stored Gospel; and from that day 
to this, the work of proclaiming the 
truth has never ceased. But it has 
not yet been fully accomplished, for 
He said it should go "to every na- 
tion, and kindred and tongue, and 
people," and the principles of eter- 
nal life should be taught to them, 
and they should be warned of the 
judgments to come. 

Now, my brethren and sisters, 
since I was twenty-six years of age, 
I have spent nine years as a mis- 
sionary unto the people of this 
country in which we live. The 
Lord has seen fit to call me to pre- 
side during the past seven years, 
and I thought perhaps it might be 
•of interest if I should give you sta- 
tistics of some of the work we have 
been doing in the Central States 
Mission, where I am now laboring. 
These statistics that I shall quote 
cover a period of six years and a 
half, beginning with January 1, 
1900, and ending with July 1, 1906. 
During this time there have been 
laboring in that mision 515 Elders, 
and nine sisters, choice spirits 
whom God has sent to assist in this 
work of the latter days. During 
this six years and a half the mis- 
sionaries have visited 709,314 fam- 
ilies of strangers; aoout 15 times 
the number of families that there 
are in the state of Utah. They 
have re-visited 55,226 of those fam- 
ilies. They have paid visits to 
members of the Church, 65,994; 
have had 738,879 Gospel conver- 
sations, and distributed 1,146,848 
tracts. These humble servants of 
God, and pure sisters assisting 
them, have sold 54,349 books, and 
loaned 14,807; and have held 43,- 
036 meetings with an attendance of 
944,798, nearly one million of peo- 
ple to whom they have preached 
•the Gospel in public meetings, and 



in the street and cottage meetings. 
They have performed during this 
period of time 1,808 baptisms, and 
blessed 1,576 children. Now I 
want to call attention to the num- 
ber of pages of literature that this 
represents. Of tracts we have used 
none of less than 16 pages. One of 
them was written by Apostle 
Charles W. Penrose, entitled, 
"What the Mormons Believe," of 
which we have distributed about 
50,000. The other tracts we have 
used have been mostly 32 and 44 
pages. Multiplying the number of 
tracts by the number of pages con- 
tained in each, we find a total of 
35,949,000 pages of reading matter 
that have been distributed in this 
form during the period referred to. 
There were 24,500,000 pages of 
reading matter in the books that 
have been sold and loaned, making 
a grand total of sixty millions, four 
hundred and forty-nine thousand 
pages of reading matter distributed 
in that one mission during six years 
and a half. 

My brothers and sisters, the 
Lord said that this Gospel should 
go to every nation, kindred, tongue 
and people, and here is a specimen 
of the work that is being done by 
the servants of the Lord, and by 
our lady missionaries, in fulfilling 
the promise that God made when 
He gave a revelation to His ser- 
vant John, upon the Isle of Patmos. 
If you will go among these mis- 
sionaries and ask them what the 
effect of this labor has been upon 
themselves they will say that it has 
brought peace into our families, it 
has given us joy, it has brought 
satisfaction to our souls, and we do 
indeed rejoice in the Holy One of 
Israel. You see then that, through 
the work that your sons, husbands, 
and daughters are doing, the prom- 



80

ises left on record by our Father 
in heaven are being fulfilled in this 
great latter-day work. 

I want to say a word about the 
integrity of these young brethren 
among whom I have labored with 
so much satisfaction. This will tell 
the whole tale that I am going to 
read to you now: "Of the 515 
missionaries over whom I have pre- 
sided during this period of time, 
two remained in the mission one 
month ; one remained two months ; 
three served three months ; three 
others six months ; two, four 
months ; and three, ten months ; all 
the other missionaries remained in 
the field from sixteen to thirty 
months each. Out of the whole 
number, there were only two who 
deserted the cause of the Master. 
They came to us and ex- 
pressed their intention to aban- 
don the mission work assigned 
to them, and returned home with- 
out being released. Twelve others 
had good cause for returning home 
after they had been only one to ten 
months time in the mission, be- 
cause of sickness contracted in their 
mission' work, or death, or extreme 
illness of near relatives at home, 
therefore they were given honor- 
able releases, by request of the 
Priesthood at home or for other 
good reasons. Think of these mis- 
sionaries serving without any hope 
of earthly recompense, looking only 
to their Father in heaven for re- 
ward, paying their own expenses, 
most of them traveling without 
purse or scrip, leaving home and 
business ' affairs, going out and 
cheerfully doing this arduous la- 
bor ! When you consider that only 
two of them deserted the cause of 
the Master, can you find such a rec- 
ord anywhere on the pages of his- 



tory outside the work of our Father 
in heaven ? 

Another thing I want to say : not 
one of these young men has defiled 
himself ; not one of them. They 
retained their virtue. When they 
came home, and the arms of be- 
loved wives, mothers and fathers, 
and sisters clasped them, they knew 
that those husbands, sons and 
brothers came into their arms pure 
as they left the fireside at home. 

My brothers and sisters, the 
time is nearing when I shall leave 
that mission, and I want to say to- 
you that there never has been a 
moment of time since I went into 
the Central States Mission, seven 
years ago this fall, that I have not 
enjoyed my labor, every day and 
moment has been a joy and satis- 
faction to me. When I leave there it 
will be with gratitude in my heart 
to my Father in heaven that He 
gave me the privilege of going into- 
that mission and remaining there 
these many years. Death has come 
into my family during that time. A 
sweet little child, two years and a. 
half old, died ; and my dear mother 
laid down her worn out body while 
I was there. I want to say one 
word concerning that noble mother 
of mine. Though her body was 
racked with pain, though she would 
have loved to see her son ere her 
body was laid in the grave, yet, 
what was her message? "My boy, 
stay at your post of duty." The 
same sentiment has been expressed 
by my noble wife and each of my 
children. Three or four years ago, 
when my home was in southern 
Utah, my eldest boy, who had been 
faithful and true during this mis- 
sionary work, wanted to go to- 
school. He desired to get an edu- 
cation in one of the higher institu- 
tions of learning, but he said, writ-

ing to me about some of his com- 
panions who were going, "I feel 
badly that I cannot go with them," 
but, said he, "I have made up my 
mind that I am going to stay here 
at home until we have finished this 
mission that God has given unto 
us." He is now twenty-four years 
of age, and is still at home, faith- 
ful and true to this work that God 
has given us to do, and so has ev- 
ery child I have, and every member 
of my family. Inasmuch as I shall, 
in a few weeks, return to my home 
permanently, and a man of God has 
been chosen to take my place, I felt 
it was proper that I should present 
some of these matters to you Lat- 
ter-day Saints, that you might 
know what has been done by your 
sons and daughters in that mission. 

Another point before I 
close. We have published in 
that mission it, 500 copies of 
the Book of Mormon, which 
have all been disposed of ex- 
cept about 200. We have published 
20,000 of the Voice of Warning; 
also 6,980 Cowley's Talks, and 
nearly 2,000,000 of tracts. Many 
of these have been sent to other 
missions, and have been purchased 
by the Saints. This is a little more 
of the work that is being done in 
fulfillment of the promises and 
prophecies of God, left on record 
through the writings and utter- 
ances of His servants in former 
as well as in later times. 

May the peace of heaven be with 
you, my brethren and sisters. May 
the Holy Spirit be in your souls. 
May you be faithful and true unto 
this work of God and the Holy 
Priesthood. I rejoice that your 
sons and daughters have returned 
from that mission true and faithful. 

While there they have been in- 
structed in the truth and encour- 



aged to maintain virtue, and they 
have been admonished that they 
should continue true and diligent 
when they return home. I feel it 
is my desire to continue to work in 
the service of my Master all the 
days of my life. God bless you. 
Amen. 

ELDER JAMES DVCKW0RTH. 

(Late President of Australian Mis- 
sion.) 

My brethren and sisters, I am 
deeply grateful for the privilege 
which I enjoy of meeting with you 
upon this occasion. During the 
short time that I speak, I sincerely 
trust that the Good Spirit which 
has been with us during conference 
may direct my remarks, that they 
may be of such a character that all 
may be instructed and benefited by 
our meeting together upon this oc- 
casion. This is the first general 
conference of the Church which it 
has been my privilege to attend dur- 
ing the past five years, for nearly 
the whole of that period I have 
been away from home, presiding 
over our work in Australia. When 
you realize the length of time I 
have been deprived of the privileges 
that we are enjoying today you 
may understand, to a certain ex- 
tent, at least, how much I appreci- 
ate this opportunity of meeting 
with the Saints in general confer- 
ence. I have enjoyed the spirit of 
this conference just as much as the 
remarks which that spirit has ac- 
tuated. 

No doubt all the Latter-day 
Saints who have been present dur- 
ing the sessions which have passed 
have enjoyed the conference, the 
remarks and the spirit thereof, 
quite as much as I have done, and 



82 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



doubtless great good will result 
therefrom. There are no other 
people in the world today who are 
blessed as are the Latter-day 
Saints. They have received the 
truth, and by reason of that fact 
they ought to be the best people 
upon the face of the earth. Our 
lives should be in keeping with the 
good instructions imparted, for 
only so far as these instructions are 
exemplified in our lives are they of 
lasting benefit to us. If our lives do 
not conform to the instructions, 
then, instead of their being a ben- 
efit to us, they will result in sor- 
row, for in the great day of the 
Lord we shall all be judged by the 
light which has been extended unto 
us. The question all Latter-day 
Saints should ask at the close of 
this conference should be this, How 
much of the instructions which 
have been imparted unto me will I 
carry out in my life? We are bless- 
ed in listening to the words of the 
inspired servants of God. There 
is no people in the world today who 
are blessed with the presence of 
Prophets, Seers and Revelators ex- 
cept the Latter-day Saints, and this 
privilege should be fully appreci- 
ated by us. But, in carrying out 
the instructions which these good 
men have given us, the Lord leaves 
us free to exercise our agency. 
There has never been any compul- 
sion exercised upon the Latter-day 
Saints regarding obedience to the 
counsels which are given unto 
them. We are asked to abide by 
these counsels, but we are not com- 
pelled. No other people in the 
world are more free in this respect 
than are the Latter-day Saints, 
whatever may be said to the con- 
trary. 

I remember upon more than one 
occasion, while I have been away 



from home, in speaking of the calls 
which are made upon our mission- 
aries to go to the nations of the 
earth, the question was asked, "Are 
your young men compelled to go 
upon these missions upon which 
they are called?" I have said to 
those who have asked me that 
question that we are just as free to 
acceot that call, and discharge the 
responsibilities pertaining thereto, 
as we are to remain at home. There 
is no need of compulsion to be ex- 
ercised upon the minds of the Lat- 
ter-day Saints to induce them to do 
right. We have good and evil pre- 
sented unto us, but whether we ac- 
cept the good and refuse the evil, or 
follow the opposite course, is left to 
ourselves. The Lord will assist us 
to do good ; He will assist us to re- 
frain from that which is evil, but 
He compels no man to do good, or 
to refrain from that which is evil. 
This has been the course pursued 
by the Lord in every age of the 
world even before the world 
upon which you and I live 
was created, and we enjoy that 
freedom of agency just as well to- 
day as we did before we came upon 
the earth. 

I find a few words recorded in 
the Book of Mormon that I will 
read. They are found on page 164, 
27th verse, chapter 2, second book 
of Nephi : 

"Wherefore men are created free ac- 
cording to the flesh, and all things are 
given which are expedient unto men. 
and they are free to choose liberty and 
eternal life through the great mediation 
of all men, or to choose captivity and 
death according to the captivity and 
power of the devil, for he seeketh that 
all men might be miserable like unto 
himself." 

You will observe that in the age 
when these words were penned the 



ELDER JAMES DUCKWORTH. 



83 



principle of free agency was extant, 
and men were just as free to choose 
the path which led to death as they 
were to choose that which leads to 
life eternal. The same principle is 
taught in other pages of the Book 
of Mormon. I will read now from 
page 319 of the Book of Alma : 

"I ought not to harrow up in my de- 
sires the firm decrees of a just God, for 
I know that He granteth unto men ac- 
cording to their desire, whether it be 
unto death or unto life. Yea, I know 
that He alloweth unto men according to 
their wills, whether they be unto salva- 
tion or unto destruction. Yea, and I 
know that good and evil have come be- 
fore all men, for he that knoweth not 
good from evil is blameless, but 
he that knoweth good from 
evil, it is given according to his desires, 
whether he desireth good or evil or 
death and remorse of conscience." 

Now that is the status of the 
Latter-day Saints today. They 
are free to choose that path which 
leads down to destruction and 
death, and become miserable like 
unto Satan himself. We, as Lat- 
ter-day Saints, can exercise our 
agency to pursue that course which 
is pleasing in the eyes of our heav- 
enly Father; when this conference 
shall be closed, therefore, let us car- 
rw with us to our homes, to our fire- 
sides, the grand instructions which 
have been given unto us, and let 
us carry the spirit by which they 
have been imparted, and then in- 
deed may we expect them to be ef- 
fective in our lives. We may rest 
assured of this fact that, if we want 
to enjoy true happiness in this life 
and in the life to come, there is 
but one course for us to pursue, 
and that is the path of righteous- 
ness, for the path of righteousness 
has in every age of the world been 
the path of happiness ; on the other 
hand, the path of wickedness has, 
in all ages of the world, led to 



misery and wretchedness. No man, 
nor woman, can live a life of un- 
righteousness and enjoy happiness, 
for happiness and unrighteousness 
never did go together, and they 
never will. 

We may think at times that the 
counsels given by the servants of 
the Lord run counter to our happi- 
ness in life, but that is entirely a 
false idea, and wrong impression. 
If you want to be happy in this 
life and in the life to come, live in 
harmony with the counsels of the 
Lord as they are given to us by 
His servants, then indeed shall we 
enjov the greatest measure of hap- 
piness possible in mortality. Our 
Savior said upon one occasion, 
"Not every one that saith unto me, 
Lord, Lord, shall enter into the 
kingdom of heaven, but he that 
doeth the will of my Father 
which is in heaven." In this re- 
spect the Latter-day Saints are ex- 
actly upon the same level as are 
the people of the world. It is not 
what we profess that will save us 
in the kingdom of God; it is what 
we do that will insure us the sal- 
vation which God desires to give 
unto all of His sons and daugh- 
ters. We should show our faith by 
our works. The religion we have 
espoused is the grandest of all re- 
ligions, and the organization to 
which we belong is the greatest, 
therefore, we ought to be the best 
people upon the face of the earth, 
and we are. But even for the Lat- 
ter-day Saints there is much room 
for improvement. I believe that 
all of the Latter-day Saints are 
more or less in this condition, 
therefore we have need to put into 
oractice the grand teachings which 
have been delivered to us during 
this conference. 

We have with us a Prophet of

the living- God, ; ust as much en- 
dowed with authority as any man 
that ever lived upon the face of 
the earth, having just as much of 
the Priesthood of God as had 
Moses, Paul or Isaiah. We have 
the Twelve Apostles also, as well 
as the First Presidency, men en- 
dowed with power from on high, 
with all the rights pertaining to 
the Melchisedek priesthood, and 
the words of these men should be 
prized by the Latter-day Saints. 
Their inspired utterances should be 
above the price of jewels, and we 
should endeavor to profit by their 
teachings in our daily walk and 
conversation. The measure of our 
happiness, as I have said, depends 
uoon our allegiance to the laws 
and comandments of God. Speak- 
ing of the missionaries who have 
gone abroad, in nearly every in- 
stance — I know of no exceptions — 
they will tell you that the happiest 
years of their lives have been 
when they were in the nations of 
the earth proclaiming the princi- 
ples of life and salvation. And 
why is this. Because they were 
then living closer to God than they 
have been at home. 

My missionary experiences have 
been the grandest I have yet enjoy- 
ed upon the earth. Twelve years 
and a half ago I went on my first 
mission, and during those twelve 
years and a half, I have been ab- 
sent from home eight and a half 
years, laboring in the ministry, and 
that time has been the happiest of 
my life. When I have been releas- 
ed it has been with feelings of re- 
gret that I have taken my departure 
for home. I believe that this is, al- 
most without exception, the expe- 
rience of all our missionaries. But, 
need we go abroad to experience 
that feeling of happiness? God is 



no respecter of persons, and He is 
just as willing to bless us at home 
as in the nations of the earth; His 
blessings are not confined to any 
particular locality. It is true that 
there are blessings which can be 
obtained only in the land of Zion, 
but that happiness which comes 
from doing good is within the 
reach of every man, whether in 
Zion or in the nations of the earth. 
There is no reason why we may 
not enjoy the same Good Spirit at 
home, around our firesides, in our 
wards and stakes throughout the 
whole Church, that the mission- 
aries enjoy in the nations of the 
earth. There should be no hap- 
pier people upon the face of the 
earth than the Latter-day Saints. 
We should be the most satisfied 
people in the world, because we 
know that we have the truth. The 
people in the world generally are 
not in that enviable condition. They 
hope they are on the right road to 
salvation, but I have talked with 
many of them, and they cannot say 
they know they are right. Where- 
as, of the Latter-day Saints, there 
is hardly one amongst them who is 
devoid of the testimony of the di- 
vinity of the great latter-day work, 
they know this is not the work of 
man. We have had great men in 
the Church, and we have today as 
grand men as ever lived upon the 
face of the earth, but this is not 
the work of any man, it is the 
work of Jesus Christ, and I know 
it, and all Latter-day Saints may 
know it for themselves. There 
need be no dubiety upon this Ques- 
tion in the minds and hearts of the 
Latter-day Saints. The Lord is 
willing to bless all of us with that 
testimony, and without it we can 
never feel absolutely secure. Trials- 
will come, trouble will overshadow 



ELDER GERMAN E. ELLSWORTH. 



85 



us, and the time will come, sooner 
or later, when that testimony will 
be needed by every Latter-day 
Saint; and when trials come it will 
be an anchor to them in the hour 
of darkness and adversity. So long 
as they remain true to that testi- 
mony, to that knowledge, they will 
never be shaken from the Church, 
never if they are faithful because 
their testimony will enable them to 
endure, and we are not safe with- 
out it. As I said, we can all have 
that testimony, and we may know 
for ourselves that this is indeed the 
Church of Jesus Christ, that Being 
who came in the meridian of time, 
the Savior of the world, the Re- 
deemer; it is His Church and net 
the church of any man, and v.e 
should have faith in Him and live 
in harmony with His laws and 
commandments. 

I t>ray God to bless you. I kno w 
that Joseph Smith was a Prophet 
of God, and that all of his succes- 
sors have been equally Prophets of 
God. May the Lord bless us, may 
we serve Him and keep His com- 
mandments during our lives, that 
we may have happiness in this life 
and increased joy in the world to 
come, is my prayer in the name of 
Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER GERMAN E. ELLSWORTH. 

(President of Northern States Mis- 
sion.) 

My brethren and sisters, I am 
very grateful for the opportunity of 
attending this conference, and par- 
taking with you of the Spirit of 
the Lord that has been poured out 
upon the Latter-day Saints assem- 
bled. It has been my earnest 
prayer, and I feel it has been yours, 
that we may practice in our lives 



the food instructions we have re- 
ceived, and make them part of our 
conduct; that our thoughts may be 
changed, if they have gone astray 
in any particular; that our words 
may be guided by inspiration, and 
our actions in life be in harmony 
with the Spirit of God, the spirit 
of the Gospel that has been re- 
stored in this day. Some man has 
said that "We sow in life a thought 
and for that thought we reap a 
word, and sowing a word, we reap 
an action, our actions make habits, 
our habits make our life and when 
this life is sown destiny or eternal 
life is our reward." In other 
words, our destiny in the world to 
come will depend upon the 
thoughts, words, actions, and hab- 
its that permeate our lives while we 
sojourn upon this earth. It is my 
earnest desire that my thoughts will 
be guided, that my actions result- 
ing therefrom, and my words, shall 
aid in the establishing of righteous- 
ness, and in sustaining and uphold- 
ing the Priesthood of God, which 
has been placed on the earth. I 
have learned that we cannot har- 
bor feelings against those who pre- 
side over us in any position, from 
a block teacher to the highest in 
authority, without the risk of ex- 
pressing some of these thoughts; 
and if we give utterance to evil 
sentiments that are in our hearts, 
our actions are likely to be corre- 
spondingly shaped, and we will 
reap a harvest of sin in this life, 
and sorrow in the life to come. Men 
magnifying positions in the Priest- 
hood are honored of God, and as 
long as God honors them, you and 
I, if we desire the happiness for 
which we pray, must carefully 
guard our thoughts, words and ac- 
tions. 

I have had great joy in being a

messenger of life and salvation to 
the children of men, and I have 
often thought, said and prayed that 
God would grant unto me the priv- 
ilege of continuing in that good 
work throughout all my days on 
the earth. In my childhood I prayed 
many times for education, for 
lands, for riches, and other gifts 
of this earth; but, after thinking 
it all over, the last prayer in my 
soul is that my Father, above all 
the blessings of earth, would grant 
me the privilege of being a witness 
of the Gospel to the honest in 
heart. I have shaped my affairs 
twice to go away and study in the. 
colleges of the land, but each time 
when I was ready to go a call ha<; 
come from the authorities of God 
for me to go and preach the Gos- 
pel, and I have willingly gone, and 
acknowledged that God's overrul- 
ing oower has guided my life in a 
way that will bring the greatest 
happiness, and I have striven to do 
that to which God has called me. 

It has given me happiness to have 
the privilege of laboring in the 
Northern States with the many that 
have been called there to preach 
and search out the honest in heart. 
I can say for those who labor there, 
that there are no better men on the 
earth than the young missionaries 
who have come to the Northern 
States, and there are none laboring 
any harder to advance the cause 
of truth, none praying more earn- 
estly that God will give them His 
Spirit, that they may have power 
over the hearts of the honest, in 
righteousness ; and that they may 
be led to those who are prepared to 
receive the Gospel. Most of the 
Elders who labor in the Northern 
States mission are boys only, but 
under the Spirit of God they have 
become powerful in bearing testi- 



mony of the Gospel of the Lord 
Jesus Christ, and fearless in their 
declaration that Joseph Smith is a 
Prophet of God, sent to establish 
righteousness in the earth. They 
tell the people that this Gospel will 
not be taken from the earth ; that 
God has been with His servants 
from the time of the re-establish- 
ment and organization of His 
Church to the present day ; that the 
proclamation of the truth of the 
Gospel plan of salvation will con- 
tinue in the earth, and that the peo- 
ple who have received the truth 
and proven faithful have had their 
souls filled with the deepest happi- 
ness and strong assurance of eter- 
nal life. During the past two years 
we were very much impressed con- 
cerning the distribution of the 
Book of Mormon Scripture in the 
earth, feeling that God requires us 
in this age and generation to dis- 
seminate this book as another wit- 
ness for the Lord Jesus Christ. The 
Bible has been pretty well received 
among the Christian world as the 
word of God ; and upon the Latter- 
day Saints, from the days of the 
Prophet Joseph Smith until now, 
has been laid the responsibility of 
establishing the Book of Mormon 
also as the word of the Lord. We 
have felt that responsibility very 
keenly, and have endeavored with 
all the means that God has given 
us to put this work in the hands of 
the people, trusting that the Spirit 
of the Lord may move upon them, 
and that they will read and learn 
wisdom through this New Witness, 
which is as potent as the Bible in 
declaring the word of God in the 
earth. Through the Prophet Jos- 
eph Smith this record was given. 
It was translated by the gift and 
power of God, and as he translated 
it he acquired wisdom, and learned 



ELDER GERMAN E. ELLSWORTH.

that this book contained the ful- 
ness of the Everlasting Gospel. He 
ascertained that it has in it a prom- 
ise that all who would read it with 
a prayerful heart should know of 
its truthfulness. 

Last year the Latter-day Saints 
missions in the United States com- 
bined and published in the city of 
Chicago, 10,000 copies of that 
work; the Northern States mission 
taking something over 3,000. This 
year, early in the spring, we began 
to urge the Elders to sell and dis- 
tribute the Book of Mormon as 
much as possible, telling them that 
the first Elders of the Church were 
sent abroad with that Book, and 
no other except the Bible. There 
was no tracts written at that time, 
and the Voice of Warning was not 
^et published, so the first Elders 
of the Church were sent abroad 
with this new witness for God. It 
contained the fulness of the Ever- 
lasting Gospel, and in many of the 
homes where it was read, the fruits 
of the Gospel followed, and hun- 
dreds were enabled to bear testi- 
mony to the fact that Joseph Smith 
was a Prophet, and that the Book 
of Mormon was the word of God, 
the history of God's dealings with 
the people who lived upon this con- 
tinent. The Elders in the North- 
ern States mission commenced the 
active campaign of selling the Book 
of Mormon in April last, and in- 
creased their energv in this direc- 
tion until in the month of Tune, 
they sold 1,232 copies, and at the 
end of that month we found our- 
selves without a Book of Mormon 
in the office. Another edition of 
10,000 was published in August, 
and since then we have sold about 
2,000. 

I bear testimony that more of 
the Spirit of God has been enjoyed 



b" the Elders who have striven to 
distribute that book than they have 
experienced in the distributing of 
any other literature that has been 
put into their hands. More people 
have inquired at our office concern- 
ing the Book of Mormon and the 
Prophet Joseph Smith than at any 
other period during the three and 
a half years we have had the priv- 
ilege of laboring in that mission. 
We have found, too, that while sell- 
ing large quantities of the Book of: 
Mormon at 50 cents a copy, we- 
have also increased our distribution: 
of Cowley's Talks, the Voice of: 
Warning, and the Durrant pamph- 
let, all of which are disposed of at 
ten cents per copy. During this 
time baptisms have not decreased, 
neither the tithings of the people, 
nor have we diminished in any 
other mission work that has been 
carried on heretofore in that part 
of the earth. The Spirit of the 
Lord has increased in the hearts of 
the Elders and the people, and they 
have received additional testimony 
concerning the truth of the Book of 
Mormon and the mission of the 
Prophet Joseph Smith. Several 
Elders have stated that this book 
sells itself, that all they have to do 
is to get the people to- read it. If 
on the street, or in a store, or an 
office, or in the home, thev can get 
people to read a few passages, the 
Spirit of the Lord accompanies 
the reading, and in almost every 
instance where people read it they 
purchased a copy. 

I believe President Brigham 
Young said that no man had ever 
heard the name of the Prophet Jos- 
eph Smith, but what the Spirit 
of the Lord whispered to him-, 
that he was a servant of God,,

Mormon but what he was impress- 
ed that it was of the Lord. Evi- 
dences of the authenticity of the 
Book of Mormon are being dis- 
covered all the time, which lead the 
people of the world to inquire con- 
cerning it. In time it will be found 
in thousands of libraries, and prove 
a mighty witness for the Lord 
Jesus. We feel that we have been 
very successful, and that God has 
blessed our efforts. 

We are privileged in the city of 
Chicago to have a large number of 
students who are members of the 
Church, and I am proud of every 
one of them. They are a strong 
support; they teach in our Sunday 
school, help administer the Sacra- 
ment, and do much of the preach- 
ing. They are willing to help us 
on every hand to spread the Gospel, 
and hundreds of their fellow stu- 
dents have heard their testimony, 
because our students are not 
ashamed of God nor the revealed 
truth. They are entitled to praise 
from the Latter-day Saints for 
their support to the missionaries in 
that part of the earth. 

Two of our Elders, two years 
ago this winter, were turned out of 
the settlement known as Zion City, 
forty miles -north of Chicago, a 
place founded by John Alexander 
Dowie. When they were thus ban- 
ished, we told the Elders to be of 
eood cheer, for the time would 
come when we would have the 
privilege of preaching the Gospel 
to them. The people there believe 
in the doctrines of faith, repent- 
ance, baptism, and in many cases 
the laying on of hands for the gift 
of the Holy Ghost. They acknowl- 
edge the truth of the principles of 
tithing, offerings, fasting and the 
building of temples ; in fact almost 
all the principles that are taught 



by the Latter-day Saints have been 
incorporated in the doctrines advo- 
cated by John Alexander Dowie. 
One exception is the principle of 
authority, or the restoration of the 
Presthood of the Son of God. This 
summer that community has practi- 
cally gone to pieces, and upon the 
streets of their city, everywhere, 
for the past two or three weeks, 
our Elders have been distributing 
tracts and preaching the Gospel, 
declaring the plan of life and sal- 
vation. We have found among 
that people a goodly number who 
have heard the Gospel from the El- 
ders in years gone by, but who had 
not the courage to accept it because 
of persecution, but when the Dowie 
oeople came along preaching sim- 
ilar doctrines thev accepted his 
counterfeit. Now thev have had 
their lands and property taken from 
them, and in their poverty some 
are willing to receive the truth 
that came to them at first. One 
lady told me that fifteen years ago 
she heard the Elders in Germany, 
but she then lacked the courage to 
become a member of the Church. 
Three or four years ago the Dowie- 
ites came along preaching the 
same principles, and she glad- 
ly received them. She then 
moved to Zion City, and turned 
over her property to the corpora- 
tion, and today she is a widow 
without anything in the world, but 
sad experience. She is glad to 
have the Mormon Elders come to 
her door and preach the Gospel to 
her again — the truth that she once 
turned her back upon. 

We recently held another confer- 
ence in Nauvoo, the city the mem- 
ory of which is dear to the heart of 
every Latter-dav Saint. The peo- 
ple there again gave us a warm 
welcome, displaying as much kind-

ness as if they were Latter-day 
Saints. They are glad to open their 
houses to us, and bid us God-speed. 
We thank the Lord that He has 
moved upon that people, so that the 
Elders have been enabled to peace- 
fully visit that country. The peo- 
ple sing our songs, and seem glad 
to have us come among them and 
teach them the truth. They believe 
we have the true Gospel, and say 
we have an influence that has never 
been experienced in their lives be- 
fore. They give us the freedom of 
their city, and bid all the Elders 
of the Church of Jesus Christ wel- 
come. Their children attend our 
Sunday school, sing our songs, and 
receive instruction just as if they 
were Latter-day Saint children. We 
are pleased with the success that 
has attended the labor that has 
been done in Hancock county, es- 
pecially in Nauvoo, where we have 
a flourishing Sunday school. We 
have a congregation of honest peo- 
ple there who willingly come and 
listen to the Elders, and help us 
pay the rent, although they have 
not yet applied for baptism. 

I am happy to have the privilege 
of attending this conference. I am 
thankful to have received, through 
the Spirit of God, an understand- 
ing of the instructions given by our 
brethren. I pray God that we may 
have His assistance to enable us to 
live by all the good counsel we have 
heard. I desire this for myself, and 
pray that these things may be in- 
stilled into my life, and that I may 
have the power to similarly inspire 
the young men I have the honor to 
labor among, that when they come 
home they may, in their thoughts, 
words and actions prove true to 
God, true to His people, true to 
His servants. I pray that not one 
of us will ever turn away from the 



truth, and that we may work right- 
eousness in the earth throughout all 
our days, in the name of Jesus. 
Amen. 

The congregation sang the hymn, 

Reedeemer of Israel, our only delight, 

On whom for a blessing we call, 
Our shadow bv day, and our pillar by 
night, 

Our King, our Deliv'rer, our all! 

Benediction was pronounced by 
Elder Frank Y. Taylor. 



SECOND OVERFLOW 
MEETING. 

In the Assembly Hall at 2 p.m. 
Apostle Reed Smoot presiding. 

The Temple choir and congrega- 
tion sang: 

Now let us rejoice in the day of salva- 
tion, 

No longer as strangers on earth 

need we roam, 
Good tidings are sounding to us and 

each nation, 
And shortly the hour of redemption 

will come. 

Prayer was offered by Elder 
John R. Barnes. 

The choir sang a hymn, 

"Oh, what joy will be in heaven." 



ELDER SEYMOUR B. YOUNG. 

My dear friends and brethren : I 
have a very earnest desire that I 
wish to express, that is that I may 
have the aid of your faith and pray- 
ers, and your kindly attention, to 
assist me in what I shall say this 
afternoon. I deem it a high honor, 



90 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



and a great privilege, to stand be- 
fore you and see the goodly com- 
pany, the large numbers that have 
assembled at this meeting of the 
conference, to hear the word of the 
Lord, and I trust that the speak- 
ers this afternoon will not disap- 
point you. The beautiful sacred 
song to which we have just listened 
is very inspiring, and touches a 
tender chord in my heart. It is of 
a character that draws our thoughts 
and hearts to our Heavenly Father, 
and leads us to think of him and 
unite in His praise in song and 
prayer, and will probably influence 
the utterances of those who speak 
unto us. A song of that character 
is a very good beginning, it opens 
the mind to sacred thoughts. 

I will read a short revelation 
from the Doctrine and Covenants, 
found in section No. 4. This rev- 
elation was given in Susquehannah 
County, Pennsylvania, February, 
1829, the year before the organiza- 
tion of the Church. The Lord said 
to the Prophet and Seer, Joseph 
Smith : 

"Now behold, a marvelous work is 
about to come forth among the children 
of men ; therefore, O ve that embark in 
the service of God, see that ye serve 
Him with all your heart, might, mind 
and strength, that ye may stand blame- 
less before God at the last day; there- 
fore, if ye have desires to serve God, ye 
are called to the work , for behold the 
field is white already to harvest, and lo, 
he that thrusteth in his sickle with his 
might, the same layeth up in store that 
he perish not, but bringeth salvation to 
his soul; and faith, hope, charity and 
love, with an eye single to the glory of 
God, qualifv him for the work. Re- 
member faith, virtue, knowledge, tem- 
perance, patience, brotherly kindness, 
godliness, charity, humility, diligence. 
Ask and ye shall receive, knock and it 
shall be opened unto you. Amen." 

Such was the revelation given to 
the Prophet in the early history of 



the Church. Before its organiza- 
tion the Lord proclaimed unto him 
that He was about to do a marvel- 
ous work and a wonder, and that 
revelation has been emphasized and 
we are seeing the fulfillment there- 
of in our day, although the fulfill- 
ment began and our fathers saw 
it in the early days of the Church. 
The marvel among observing men 
and women at that time was that 
a poor farmer's boy, unlettered, un- 
sophisticated, unlearned, could pro- 
duce any wonderful impression up- 
on the people among whom he 
dwelt, and upon others farther 
from his home. Such was the 
spirit of his message that it drew 
around him men like Brigham 
Young, the great Prophet-pioneer 
of this mountain region, whose in- 
spiration and energy made it possi- 
ble for the Saints to make homes 
here where they have been pros- 
pered and blessed. Such men also 
us the brothers of Brigham Young, 
together with Heber C. Kimball, 
John Taylor, Wilford Woodruff, 
Lorenzo Snow, and others of the 
Twelve who constituted the first or- 
ganization of that quorum. Those 
stalwart men who remained true to 
the Prophet, to the Church, and to 
their convictions. Those leaders, 
and the hundreds and thousands of 
others that have followed in the 
same belief, under the same inspira- 
tion, have testified that the Lord 
has set His hand to bring to pass a 
marvelous work and a wonder. 
When we consider that, notwith- 
standing the opposition that was 
arrayed against this little handful 
of people, the Lord fulfilled this 
promise through them. In that day, 
a few years after the organization 
of the Church, in the early history 
of Kirtland, where the Church was 
organized, there was a very small 



ELDER SEYMOUR B. YOUNG. 



gathering of Latter-day Saints. 
They were in poverty and in want, 
compelled constantly to stand in de- 
fense of their rights, not only of 
their rights, but also their lives,to 
maintain the possibility of living 
and testifying to the truth. Despite 
all the adverse circumstances that 
our pioneer fathers had to meet, the 
work that the Lord decreed should 
come to pass, that should be a mar- 
vel and a wonder to the world, has 
indeed been a success; it has been 
established by the power of the 
Lord, through His faithful mes- 
sengers and servants. When the 
Latter-day Saints, in their poverty 
and limited numbers, assumed to 
build a temple in the town of Kirt- 
land, and dedicated that house to 
the Lord, and when it was declar- 
ed by revelation that the Temple 
was accepted by Him, then there 
was more astonishment among 
those who were opposed to this 
work. The bitterness of their ha- 
tred increased as the work grew, 
and as it was demonstrated that the 
power of the Lord was with His 
Prophet and with those who stood 
shoulder to shoulder with him. But 
the "marvelous work and a won- 
der" could not be confined to the 
little town of Kirtland ; it must 
have greater breadth and greater 
opportunities for its development, 
so the immigration or the move- 
ment into the State of Missouri was 
begun. The Lord designated a por- 
tion of that land to be the great cen- 
tral stake of Zion, where a Temple 
should be erected, which will have 
the glory of His presence resting 
upon it as a cloud by day, and a pil- 
lar of fire by night. But the time 
was not yet for the fulfillment of 
this grand purpose and promise, 
greater scope was still needed for 
the development of this marvelous 



work and wonder that the Lord 
was going to establish, so the 
Saints began to gather in the State 
of Illinois. After a while, the pre- 
judices of the people of Illinois be- 
came too great. The surroundings 
there were not propitious for the 
spread of truth and the gathering 
of Israel. After the martyrdom of 
the Prophets Joseph and Hyrum, 
the Lord inspired Brigham Young, 
and those who stood faithful with 
him, to lead the people out from 
Nauvoo. This exodus was a ful- 
fillment of a prediction made by the 
Prophet Joseph Smith about two 
years before his martyrdom, where- 
wherein he declared that the Saints 
would gather in the midst of the 
Rocky Mountains and become 
great and mighty there. So Brig- 
ham Young led the people into 
these valleys ; and we have "grown 
some" since coming here. 

I appeal to you today to say if 
you have not witnessed a growth 
and development here that has ful- 
filled in a great degree the predic- 
tion and word of the Lord that was 
given to the Prophet in 1829. The 
wonderful part of it is, to those 
who do not see as we do, from a 
religious standpoint, that the work 
has prospered, that it has grown 
and strengthened notwithstanding 
the opposition that has always been 
brought to bear upon it, I will not 
say by our enemies, but by those 
who have misunderstood us, by 
those who have not comprehended 
the mission of the Church, and have 
not believed in the divine calling of 
the Prophet Joseph Smith, or of 
those brethren who have stood at 
the head of the Church since his 
martyrdom. Those people who, in 
their ignorance, have lifted their 
arms and their voices against the 
Latter-day Saints have not under- 



GENERAL CONFERENCE, 



stood our mission ; nor the pur- 
poses of the Lord, for He declared 
that He would bring to pass this 
marvelous work and wonder. He 
also declared to the Prophet Joseph 
that this Church that He was about 
to establish should never again be 
taken from the earth, but that 
Apostles, Evangelists, and Teach- 
ers should continue their pleading 
with the people in the nations of 
the earth, asking them to forsake 
their sinful ways, arrive at a knowl- 
edge of 'the truth, and come to the 
gathering places of the Saints who 
were appointed to establish this 
marvelous work and wonder in the 
land of Zion. Today, my brothers 
and sisters, we see the grand results 
of the gathering, the building of 
homes and the organization of 
wards and stakes of Zion through- 
out this inter-mountain region, 
combining the wealth and 
spirit and power of a unit- 
ed people to bring .to pass 
the purposes of the Almighty 
in establishing His work in the 
latter days. 

I am reminded now of the won- 
derful prosperity that is attending 
this people, both financially and in 
other respects. Let me express my 
views as to their conditions, spir- 
itually as well as temporally. I 
never have known the people to be 
so united, so strong, so firm in the 
faith as they are today. I never 
have known the membership of the 
Church numerically so high in 
unity, power and strength, 
and the hearts of the peo- 
ple so willing to receive the teach- 
ings of their leaders. I know there 
is a decided advancement over and 
above other years along the line 
of faith, diligence and good works. 
A few years ago, President Lo- 
renzo Snow called a few of his 
brethren to go on a journey with 



him to St. George, and there the 
Lord showed to him, as he after- 
wards declared in our conferences, 
the reason for the journey. He 
said that the mission he was to per- 
form among the people was to call 
them to repentance, and remind 
them of the duty that they owed to 
God in regard to tithes and offer- 
ings. These visits were continued 
throughout all the stakes of Zion, 
and the spirit of that mission and 
calling that rested upon the Pres- 
ident of the Church was wide- 
spread; it had the effect to bring 
■ the people to a remembrance of an 
almost forgotten duty. The promise 
was made to the Saints that if they 
would respond to the call, earnest- 
ly and sincerely, that the windows 
of heaven would be opened, as pre- 
dicted by Malachi, and there would 
hardly be found room to contain 
the blessings that the Lord would 
shower upon His people through 
their obedience to this command- 
ment. Now we see the effects of 
that preaching and the inspiration 
which President Snow had. It has 
continued from that time to the 
present, and the people are more 
faithful in the line of this and other 
sacred duties than I have ever 
known them before ; the results are 
apparent everywhere. The win- 
dows of- heaven have indeed been 
opened. From one end of the land 
to the other the cry comes, We can- 
not find men to harvest our grain 
and cereals, to put into our gran- 
aries and places of storage the 
bounties of earth that the Lord has 
showered upon us ; the blessings of 
heaven and of earth are indeed 
ours. I believe we are advancing 
on spiritual lines, and there is a dis- 
position to serve the Lord more 
faithfully than ever before. This is 
gratifying to me. When I see these 
great gatherings I want to say to 



ELDER SEYMOUR B. YOUNG. 



my brethren and sisters, let us re- 
joice in the blessings we have re- 
ceived, in the testimonies that we 
have in our hearts. Let us not ex- 
ult; in the very humility of our 
souls let us rejoice that we have a 
testimony of the truth. 

I feel that we are dependent up- 
on the mercies of our Father, and 
upon the blessings that the Lord 
will bestow upon us only through 
our faithfulness and humility, and 
our trust in Him. 

In the 107th section of the Book 
of Doctrine and Covenants, I will 
read a few words that may impress 
upon you exactly what I mean : 

"Verily I say unto you, concerning 
your brethren who have been afflicted 
and persecuted and cast out from the 
land of their inheritance, I, the Lord, 
have suffered the affliction to come up- 
on them, wherewith they have been af- 
flicted, in consequence of their trans- 
gression." 

Now the Lord further declared, 
in section 119, in regard to the law 
of tithing, and in regard to other 
laws, that "If my people will keep 
my law and keep my command- 
ments, this shall be a land of Zion 
unto them always ; but if they keep 
not my law, and disobey my com- 
mands," then the other conditions 
would follow, and it will not be a 
land of Zion unto His people. Now, 
let us rejoice in the truth which has 
made us free, that we have had all 
doubts dispelled in regard to the 
truth of the Gospel, and in regard 
to the divine calling of the Proph- 
et Joseph Smith and of those who 
preside over us today. Let us real- 
ize that through the blessings and 
mercy of our Father, we are per- 
mitted to have a testimony that 
this is indeed the work of the Lord, 
and that we are engaged in build- 
in<y up and establishing His Church. 



In the year 1887 a great Jubilee 
was held in old England, the British 
kingdom, on the 50th anniversary 
of the crowning of Queen Victoria. 
In that wonderful gathering history 
says that the chiefs of all the col- 
onies, and the dukes, and lords, and 
nobles from every part of the Brit- 
ish empire were present, and kings 
and rulers from other countries 
were also present, and great was 
the display of joy, rejoicing, and 
exultation by the people. The pros- 
perity of that nation, I believe, is 
in part due to the fact of the Brit- 
ish people being, largely descend- 
ants of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob ; 
they are of Israel. Heber C. Kim- 
ball, in 1840, lifted up his hands on 
the streets of Manchester, when 
Queen Victoria was passing, and 
asked the blessings of heaven upon 
her, and upon her people. I am 
satisfied that from that time the 
spirit of faith in the Gospel began 
to increase in that nation. We have 
gathered strong representatives of 
Israel from Great Britain, equally 
as strong, and in greater numbers, 
than from any other nation. They 
are of Ephraim, and have accepted 
the Gospel and have been highly fa- 
vored of the Lord. And so in the 
Scandinavian nations and missions 
abroad, where the Elders have gain- 
ed a foothold, this Gospel is being 
preached and the leaven of it is be- 
ing felt among scattered Israel ev- 
erywhere. Israel is thus being 
gathered by the efforts of our hum- 
ble Elders, who go abroad to the 
nations, taking their lives in their 
hands, sacrificing their time and 
giving the ability of their young 
manhood to disseminate the princi- 
ples of the Gospel. While this is 
going on, this, marvelous work and 
wonder is being established in the 
land. We humbly rejoice, and

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



honor our Father and God, and 
the Priesthood, and love those who 
preside over us, unite in the faith, 
and assist to spread the Gospel in 
every way possible. We are indeed 
a prosperous people, and have be- 
come the wonder of the world, be- 
cause we exist and increase in pow- 
er and strength, notwithstanding 
the world is arrayed against us. 

Now, my brethren and sisters, I 
rejoice today. I ask the blessing 
of the Lord to be upon you, that 
we may rely upon the promises of 
the Lord, in the future as in the 
past. When you go from this con- 
ference, may you - go in peace, re- 
joicing, and may no accident befall 
you on the way. May the choicest 
blessings of heaven always be with 
you, is my earnest prayer in the 
name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 



ELDER ANDREW JENSON. 

My brethren and sisters, the 
subject that I shall touch upon will 
perhaps be unique in its nature, and 
may differ somewhat from the prin- 
ciples touched upon by the other 
speakers, and yet it will be a part of 
the great whole, and I think you 
will be pleased to be reminded of 
one of the many little duties that 
devolves upon every individual in 
the Church. 

We have been called to occupy 
different positions in the Church 
and appointed to labor in different 
callings ; but if we only do that 
which the Lord wants us to do, and 
go to with all our heart, mind and 
strength, the Lord will be pleased 
with us and our efforts, and bless 
us accordingly. It is so with the 
Twelve Apostles, whose duty it is 
to preach the Gospel in all the 



world ; it is so with the Seventies 
who are assistants to the Twelve. 
And the same can be said of the 
High Priests and other officers 
who preside at home, and those who 
are engaged in other labors. We 
all work for the upbuilding of 
Zion. 

Your humble servant has for 
many years been engaged in rec- 
ord-making — in culling from the 
old records and gathering from 
original sources the history of this 
people. I hold in my hand a copy 
of a little work, entitled the Pearl 
of Great Price,which among other 
things, contains the Book of Abra- 
ham. In that book I find it record- 
ed that Abraham was in possession 
of certain records, and that by the 
perusal of these records he learned 
that he was entitled to the Holy 
Priesthood. With this understand- 
ing he sought diligently the God of 
his fathers, so that he might be or- 
dained to that Priesthood. And he 
did not seek in vain, because Abra- 
ham was a righteous man, and the 
Lord was pleased to take him away 
from his father's country (where 
the people, including his own kin- 
dred, had sunk into idolatry) and 
make him a stranger in a land that 
afterwards became the inheritance 
of his descendants. This item of 
history is one of the first we have 
on record in regard to the Holy 
Priesthood. Abraham found from 
the record in his possession that he 
was entitled to that priesthood 
which had been given to the earth 
through Father Adam, and which 
had come down in a direct line from 
the father of all mankind to Abra- 
ham's own day, and Abraham was 
entitled to receive it, and he did re- 
ceive it, as we find recorded. 

According to a revelation con- 
tained in the Book of Doctrine and 



ELDER ANDREW JENSON. 



95 



Covenants, the Lord, in speaking of 
the Patriarchial Priesthood, says : 

"This order was instituted in the days 
of Adam and came down by lineage in 
the following manner : 

"From Adam to Seth, who was or- 
dained by Adam at the age of 69 years, 
and was blessed by him three years pre- 
vious to his (Adam's) death, and re- 
ceived the promise of God by his father, 
that his posterity should be the chosen 
of the Lord, and that they should be 
preserved unto the end of the earth, 

"Because he (Seth )was a perfect 
man, and his likeness was the express 
likeness of his father's, insomuch that 
he seemed to be like unto his father in 
all things, and could be distinguished 
from him only by his age. 

"Enos was ordained at the age of 134 
years and four months, by the hand of 
Adam. 

"God called upon Cainan in the wil- 
derness, in the fortieth year of his age, 
and he met Adam in journeying to the 
place Shedolamak. He was 87 years old 
when he received his ordination. 

"Mahalaleel was 496 years and seven 
days old when he was ordained by the 
hand of Adam, who also blessed him. 

"Jared was 200 years old when he was 
ordained under the hand of Adam, who 
also blessed him. 

"Enoch was 25 years old when he was 
ordained under the hand of Adam, and 
he was 65 and Adam blessed him. 

"And he saw the Lord, and he walked 
with him, and was before his face con- 
tinually ; and he walked with God 365 
years, making him 430 years old when 
he was translated. 

"Methuselah was 100 years old when 
he was ordained under the hand of 
Adam. 

"Lamech was 32 years old when he 
was ordained under the hand of Seth. 

"Noah was 10 years old when he was 
ordained under the hand of Methuse- 
lah."— (Doc. & Cov., 106 : 41-52.) 

Shem, the son of Noah, was co- 
temporary with Abraham ; hence, 
the ordination of Abraham to the 
Priesthood that his fathers held 
could easily take place, according to 
the order which had been ordained 
by God from the beginning. 



By way of further illustration I 
will refer you to another item of 
record. I find in the history of the 
Jews, as recorded in the Bible, a 
passage that I desire to read; for I 
would like to make a deep and last- 
ing impression upon you in regard 
to the importance of keeping rec- 
ords. Here is a brief history of the 
return of the children of Israel 
from the Babylonian captivity. It 
describes how and when they re- 
turned, and how many there were 
in each tribe or family who came 
back to their homes from which 
they had been absent for seventy 
years. But there were some of 
them, who, on their return, found 
themselves in a peculiar dilemma, 
and if you will listen to this — the 
2nd chapter of Ezra, the 61st and 
62nd verses — you will understand 
what that dilemma was : 

"And of the children of the Priests ; 
the children of Habaiah, the children of 
Koz, the children of Barzillai (which 
took a wife of the daughters of Barzillai, 
and was called after their name) : These 
sought their register among those who 
were recorded by genealogy, but they 
were not found ; therefore were they, as 
polluted, put from the priesthood." 

You will find the same statement 
in the 7th chapter of Nehemiah, 
63rd and 64th verses. 

I now refer you to the 128th sec- 
tion of the Doctrine and Covenants, 
paragraph 8. There you will find 
a rather extraordinary statement in 
a modern revelation, or rather in a 
communication that was sent to the 
Saints in Nauvoo, written by the 
Prophet Joseph Smith, who gives a 
new interpretation of the loosing 
and the binding power. After 
quoting the words, "Whatsoever 
you bind on earth, shall be bound 
in heaven, and whatsoever you 
loose on earth, shall be loosed in

heaven," he says, "or in other 
words, taking a different view of 
the translation, whatsoever you re- 
cord on earth, shall be recorded in 
heaven, and whatsoever you do not 
record on earth, shall not be re- 
corded in heaven." 

My brethren and sisters, I would 
like to impress your minds with 
this fact : Records have been kept 
by and histories have been written 
of the people of God in all the dis- 
pensations that have ever been 
opened on the earth, and we, like 
the saints of former dispensations, 
need to keep records, so that we, 
like them, may be able to prove the 
genealogy of our Priesthood, and 
that we are members of the Church 
of Christ. It is required of us as a 
duty that we do this. 

It is true what President Sey- 
mour B. Younp- said in reference 
to the Prophet Joseph Smith, the 
founder of the work of God in 
these last days that every- 
thing we possess today to 
rejoice in we have attained 
through Joseph Smith ; the 
Gospel in its purity was restored to 
him, and the Priesthood which en- 
ables men to act in the name of 
Christ was given to him first; then 
others were called by the Lord 
through him, and in that manner, 
they obtained the Priesthood also. 
But it was all done through the in- 
strumentality of Joseph Smith. 
Many years have already passed 
away since that Priesthood was 
thus restored. It is true that we do 
not have to go back many genera- 
tions, like the Roman Catholic 
church, which endeavors to prove 
its right to the Priesthood that Pe- 
ter possesed, through the lineage of 
some 273 Bishops and Popes. For 
we know something about the great 
"falling away, "and we know, too, 
that the Priesthood was taken away 



from the earth and restored again 
in these last days, which restora- 
tion took place over seventy-seven 
years ago. But all the Latter-day 
Saints who hold that Priesthood to- 
day have received it, in consequence 
of the fact that it was restored by 
heavenly messengers to the Prophet 
Joseph Smith in 1829. 

We have no power in and of our- 
selves to officiate in the ordinances 
of the House of God; we have no 
right to baptize ; we have no right 
to lay on hands for the reception 
of the Holy Ghost; we can not 
make an officer in the Church of 
any description, be it Deacon or 
Teacher, Priest or Elder, Seventy 
or High Priest, or Apostle, ex- 
cept by virtue of that authority giv- 
en to this Church through Joseph 
Smith. Therefore, I want to say 
this : We desire all men and all 
women who are members of the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints to place themselves in 
such a condition that they can prove 
by records that they are members 
of the Church ; and those who hold 
the Holy Priesthood should be able 
to prove how and when that Priest- 
hood was conferred upon them. 
This may to some seem a simple 
matter, but it is really of great im- 
portance. It has been agitated in 
your midst for the last sixteen 
years, at least, that documentary ev- 
idence is required of every man 
who claims to hold a portion of the 
Holy Priesthood, and of every 
member who claims to have been 
baptized by divine authority. They 
should -orove by records that they 
are properly and legally called and 
ordained. W e expect, therefore, 
that every family in the Church 
will keep a record, in which such 
entries will be made, that every 
male member, who is ordained, can

trace his Priesthood the same as 
Abraham of old did, and that every 
one who has been blessed as a child, 
or who has been baptized and con- 
firmed, can prove that fact by docu- 
mentary evidence. 

In order to guide you in this mat- 
ter, I will give you an example of 
how the Priesthood we hold should 
be traced to its source. Here is 
Seymour B. Young, who has just 
addressed this meeting ; he ranks 
now as the first Seventy in the 
Church, he being the senior Presi- 
dent of all the Seventies. He is 
universally known by the Saints 
throughout the Stakes of Zion, but 
we have a right to know how 
Brother Young became possessed of 
the Priesthood, which makes him 
what he is today. I could as well 
illustrate my point with some other 
man, but I happen to know the facts 
in this particular case, and I will 
quote from Church Chronology, a 
work that was compiled some 
years ago by your humble servant. 
We want to prove that Seymour B. 
Young is a Seventy, and that he 
has a right to administer in the 
calling pertaining to that particular 
office in the Priesthood ; and if we 
can prove that he has a legitimate 
right to his present position, we 
can, on the same principle, prove 
that every other Elder in the 
Church is a legitimate officer, pro- 
vided the necessary records are at 
hand. I find it recorded here that 
Brother Seymour B. Young was or- 
dained a Seventy Feb. 18, 1857, by 
Edmund Ellsworth, who was or- 
dained a Seventy Mar. 8, 1843, by 
Joseph Young, who was ordained a 
Seventy Feb. 28. 1835, bv Joseph 
Smith the Prophet, who was or- 
dained an Apostle in June, 1829, by 
Peter, James and John, who were 
ordained by the Savior Himself. 



Whenever we perform an official 
act in this Church, we do it in the 
name of Jesus Christ, and by vir- 
tue of the Holy Priesthood. When 
we baptize anybody, we use these 
words : "Having been commission- 
ed of Jesus Christ, I baptize you in 
the name of the Father and of the 
Son and of the Holy Ghost ;" and in 
laying on hands for the reception of 
the Holy Ghost, we also refer to 
the Priesthood we hold, and per- 
form the ordinance in the name of 
Jesus Christ. We do not refer to 
our own power, because we have 
no power as human beings to con- 
fer heavenly gifts or blessings of 
any kind upon anybody, but in the 
name of Jesus Christ and by vir- 
tue of the Holy Priesthood that has 
been conferred upon us we go out 
into all the world to preach the 
Gospel to every creature, like the 
servants of God did in ancient days. 
We can baptize people for the re- 
mission of their sins, if we possess 
the priesthood, which is the power 
or authority of God. The Lord 
recognizes the act, because He rec- 
ognizes His own authority, and 
thus sins are forgiven by baptism. 
By placing hands upon the heads 
of those who have been baptized, 
we can confer upon them the Holy 
Ghost, because we do it in the name 
of Jesus Christ, and because we 
have the Priesthood. In this man- 
ner the Holy Ghost has been con- 
ferred in thousands and tens of 
thousands of instances by the El- 
ders of this Church. In fact, ev- 
ery man and woman who has been 
baptized into this Church has had 
hands laid upon him or her for the 
reception of the Holy Ghost, and 
that is how they became members 
of the Church. It must be plain 
then to all Saints, that these ordi- 
nances are of the greatest impor-

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



tance to every individual member 
of the Church, and I. trust that 
hereafter a record will be kept in 
every family in which these ordi- 
nances will be properly recorded. 
Do not rely upon the public rec- 
ords alone, for they are sometimes 
destroyed or lost, but keep your 
own records. 

To the heads of families who 
have children that are being blessed, 
baptized, confirmed and ordained 
to the different grades and offices 
of the Priesthood, let me say: As 
long as your sons and daughters 
are members of your households, 
keep their records, for as a rule they 
do not, young and inexperienced as 
they are, understand the importance 
of keeping their own records. En- 
ter upon your family records when 
and by whom blessings and ordina- 
tions are conferred upon any and 
all members of your households, so 
that when your boys and girls leave 
the parental roof, to establish fam- 
ilies of their own, you can give 
them this important data. Then 
they will be able to prove, wher- 
ever they go, how and when they 
became members of the Church of 
Christ, or were blessed with a por- 
tion of the Holy Priesthood. 

My time is nearlv spent, and I do 
not want to exceed it, as there are 
still other speakers to be heard from 
in this meeting. I had in my mind, 
when I arose to address you, that 
I wanted to impress upon you the 
necessity of record-keeping and this 
I have now endeavored to do. I 
have traveled in all the Stakes of 
Zion. I have visited nearly all the 
settlements of the saints twice, and 
some of them many times, to ob- 
tain historical data, f have also 
visited the different missionary 
fields throughout the world, some 
of them several times, in the inter- 



est of Church Records, and I am 
pleased to say here that we are get- 
ting the public records in a pretty 
good shape. The records of the 
Church are being kept better now 
than they ever were before in the 
history of this people ; and yet these 
public records are not sufficient for 
the individual member. We want 
to make you all historians. We de- 
sire that everyone who has a fam- 
ily — every head of a family — should 
see to it that some record is being 
kept in the family, independent and 
aside from the public records. 

Had I time to give you more rea- 
sons for my earnest injunctions, I 
could give you a great many such. 
There are indeed numerous rea- 
sons why you should keep these rec- 
ords, but I do not think it is neces- 
sary for me to reiterate them here, 
for I feel impressed that you do not 
doubt the correctness of my coun- 
sel. In conclusion, let me once 
more remind you of the words of 
the Prophet Joseph Smith : "What- 
soever you record on earth, shall be 
recorded in heaven, and whatsoever 
you do not record on earth shall not 
be recorded in heaven." If you will 
keep records according to my coun- 
sel, brethren and sisters, you will 
at some future day be well pleased 
with your actions. You will then 
always be able to establish your 
fenealogy, and when you move 
from one place to another and be- 
come members of some other Ward 
or branch of the Church, you can 
always present a truthful and ac- 
ceptable record, and no question can 
then arise about the validity of 
your priesthood or the validity of 
your membership in the Church, 
because you carry your own records 
or documentary evidence with you. 
Amen. 



BISHOP ORRIN P. MILLER. 



<J9 



The Temple choir sang: "There 
is sunshine in my soul today." 

BISHOP ORRIN P. MILLER. 

It is with peculiar feelings, my 
brethren and sisters, I arise to ad- 
dress you for a few minutes this 
afternoon. It is quite a surprise to 
me, because I am unaccustomed to 
addressing such large congrega- 
tions as this. The labor in the Pre- 
siding Bishop's office is entirely of 
a temporal character, and my mind 
is so much engrossed in the tem- 
poral affairs of the kingdom that it 
is a hard matter for me to speak 
about spiritual matters. We re- 
ceive considerable mail every day in 
the week, and in all this corre- 
spondence we very seldom get a let- 
ter that is of a spiritual character. 
Once in a while we receive through 
the mail something contributed in 
the way of charity, or a request for 
assistance in behalf of those who 
are afflicted, and of course this na- 
turally touches our heart a little, 
and causes us to feel charitable, and 
our sympathies go out toward those 
who are in distress. If it were not 
for these letters coming occasional- 
ly, I am afraid we might have but 
very little of the spiritual nature in 
ns. 

I desire to report to you this af- 
ternoon that, from a financial point 
of view, I don't think the Church 
was ever in so prosperous a condi- 
tion as it is today ; and I don't be- 
lieve there was ever a time in the 
history of the Church when the Lat- 
ter-day Saints were more faithful 
in the observance of the principles 
of the Gospel, or when they had 
more faith than they are manifest- 
ing today. This is shown by their 
willing obedience to the law of tith- 



ing, which provides the President 
of the Church with the revenue 
whereby he can meet the demands 
that are made upon him from time 
to time in establishing missions 
abroad in the earth, lengthening the 
cords of Zion, and strengthening 
her stakes. It gives me great pleas- 
ure and satisfaction, to know that 
the people have faith in the Lord, 
because He has made great prom- 
ises unto us in regard to this 
one particular law. He says, "Prove 
me and see if I will not open the 
windows of heaven and pour out 
upon you a blessing that you are 
unable to contain." And has not 
this been realized this season, my 
brethren and sisters ? The win- 
dows of heaven have been opened, 
and the beautiful rains have made 
the land teem with plenty, bounti- 
ful harvests are seen on every hand, 
in fact hundreds of bushels of fruit 
that the people have been unable 
to market have ripened and fallen 
off the trees. There has been an 
abundance of grain, and plenty of 
food in' the land for everybody. 

While listening to the remarks of 
our brethren during this confer- 
ence, my mind has rested upon a 
revelation found in the Doctrine 
and Covenants, and I will read a 
portion of it : 

"Let thy bowels also be full of 
charity toward all men and to the 
household of faith, and let virtue 
garnish thy, thoughts unceasingly. 
Then shall thy confidence wax 
strong in the precious things of 
God and the doctrine of the priest- 
hood" — that priesthood which has 
been portrayed to us bv Elder Jen- 
son this afternoon — "The doctrine 
of the priesthood shall distil upon 
thy soul as the dews from heaven." 
Now you all know how the dews 
from heaven come, they come gent-

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



ly in the stillness of the night, they 
come when we least expect them 
sometimes when we are asleep and 
do not know it; so it is with "the 
doctrines of the priesthood." "The 
Holy Ghost, the Comforter, shall 
be thy constant companion, thy 
scepter an unchanging scepter of 
righteousness and truth, and thy 
dominion shall be an everlasting do- 
minion, and without compulsory 
means it shall flow unto thee for- 
ever and ever." 

Is not this a glorious promise 
made unto us in these latter days, 
and has not the doctrine of the 
priesthood, the spirit of it, been dis- 
tilled on our brethren throughout 
all this conference? They have 
been filled with the Holy Ghost, and 
spoke as if they were filled with in- 
spirational fire. 

It has been my privilege, my 
brethren and sisters to be born in 
these valleys, and I have attended 
the general conferences of the 
Church from my earliest childhood 
as far back as I can remember, but 
I cannot recall an instance when the 
Holv Ghost has been more manifest 
in the discourses of our brethren 
than during this conference. May 
we orofit by what we have heard, 
and be imbued with this Spirit; 
may it enter into our souls and 
become part of us, that when we go 
home we may be strengthened in 
our determination to do the will of 
the Father and keep His command- 
ments, that we may be strong and 
mighty in the defense of Israel, is 
my orayer, and I ask it in the name 
of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER RICHARD W. YOUNG. 

(President of Ensign Stake.) 

My brothers and sisters, I sin- 
cerely pray that the spirit that has 



so far characterized this meeting, 
as well as the other meetings of 
this glorious conference, may at- 
tend me during the few minutes 
that I shall address you. 

There has been considerable said 
during the sessions of this confer- 
ence pertaining to the belief of the 
Latter-day Saints in what has been 
called the "oerfect law of liberty." 
Several of the Apostles have refer- 
red to our belief in this principle. 
Those of us who had the privilege 
of hearing Apostle Whitney this 
morning listened to a discourse re- 
plete with instances and quotations 
from the Scriptures, the ancient 
Scriptures and those which origi- 
nated in this day, showing that 
the Latter-day Saints, while claim- 
ing the right to worship God as 
they may choose, concede to all 
other men the same privilege, and 
equal right. We have also heard 
that charity and long-suffering are 
characteristics of the Gospel. 

With reference to the law of lib- 
erty, Apostle Whitney pointed out 
that in the very beginning, that is 
in the Councils of Heaven, which 
considered the formation of this 
world and the plan of salvation 
which has been established here, 
two propositions were made, one 
advocated the compelling of people 
to be saved, the taking away from 
them of their free agency — which 
plan was rejected. The second, or 
alternative plan proposed, and 
which prevailed, as we learn from 
the revelations God has given in 
this day, involved the absolute free 
agency of every son and daughter 
of God that should be born upon 
the earth. That belief, I venture to 
say, is the very cornerstone of the 
Gospel we have received. We know, 
also, it has been taught in this day 
that when Christ comes, and the 



ELDER RICHARD W. YOUNG. 



101 



millennium shall be established, all 
men shall even then have the right 
to worship as they see fit. 

Christ taught that we should be 
charitable and not be influenced by 
a spirit of persecution. We are re- 
minded that our Savior, in the 
throes of expiration, prayed God 
that His enemies might be forgiven, 
upon the plea that they did not 
know what they were doing. Now 
these, in very brief outline, are 
some doctrines of the Church per- 
taining to very important subjects. 

We believe in extending to all 
people the rights of conscience to 
the fullest extent. We believe that 
the Declaration of Independence 
was inspired of God, in declaring 
that all men have the right to es- 
tablish their own governments 
along such lines as they may see fit. 
These are likewise doctrines of the 
Church. It is interesting to turn 
for a moment to consider what has 
heen the practice and history of the 
Church, with reference to these vi- 
tal prooositions. 

We have been sufferers, it is true, 
all the days of our lives from slan- 
der and persecution. I need not 
point out to this congregation, for 
you are familiar with the fact, that 
in the very inception of the work, 
the Prophet Joseph Smith was dis- 
couraged, slandered, and waylaid; 
and that, soon after the Church was 
organized, mobs endeavored to pre- 
vent the people from being bap- 
tized. I need not remind you that 
soon after the Church was estab- 
lished in Kirtland, Ohio, some of 
our Elders were tarred and feath- 
ered, and that public sentiment was 
strong against the people. You are 
also familiar with the fact that, 
when our people went to Jackson 
County, Missouri, under charges 
that were baseless, they were driv- 



en out, and made to sacrifice their 
property, both real and personal. I 
may say here, that perhaps the chief 
charge made against our people at 
that time was that they were aboli- 
tionists, that they did not believe in 
the enforced slavery of the negro 
race; and it was largely upon that 
ground our people were compelled 
to suffer. When they moved into 
Clay, Daviess, Caldwell and some 
other counties in Missouri, there 
was a land agitation. Their new 
neighbors, taking courage from the 
example of their brethren over in 
Jackson county, combined in their 
selfishness and demanded that our 
people should leave, and sacrifice 
again their real property and per- 
sonal belongings. And you will re- 
member that the same charges as 
before were made against them. 
You will recall that a governor, of 
infamous memory, made an order 
which is recorded in the archives of 
the history of that state, that the 
"Mormons" should at once leave 
the State or be exterminated, and 
this without any offense on their 
part against God or man. When 
our people went over into the State 
of Illinois, they were at first re- 
ceived with open arms, but, owing 
to the fact that they were united — 
I make this assertion on the author- 
ity of a statement of Governor 
Ford, in his history of the State of 
Illinois, ascribing the difficulties of 
the Mormon Church in that state, 
as well as in other states, to their 
unity. Owing to the fact that, con- 
trary to the custom of the various 
churches of the day, our people 
were united in various other re- 
spects, in which they had a perfect 
right to unite, they were again 
driven from their homes and com- 
pelled to sacrifice their property. 
Charges were made against our 



102 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



people that they were thieves, that 
they were counterfeiters, together 
with other charges of a similar false 
character. 

It was my pleasure a few months 
since to have a conversation with 
Mr. Cooper of Dubuque, Iowa, one 
of the manufacturers of the famous 
Cooper wagons, in which he stated 
that, on the very day the Prophets 
Joseph and Hyrum were martyred, 
he, being then a deck hand on a 
Mississippi steamer, on arriving at 
the wharf at Nauvoo with his com- 
panions, were afraid of their lives, 
by reason of what had happened 
and the rumors afloat. We spoke 
of those Nauvoo days, and I found 
he was very conversant with condi- 
tions on the Mississippi River at 
that time, as he has been since, and 
his testimony to me was that those 
charges against the morality and 
uprightness of the Mormon people 
were totally false, that, in fact, the 
people were driven out of that 
State by reason of religious intol- 
erance. In like fashion, after com- 
ing here, untruthful charges were 
made, resulting in repressive laws 
being formulated against us. At 
one time, we were practi- 
cally deprived of the right of 
trial by jury. Congress, led by as- 
persions falsely made against our 
characters, spurred by malicious 
statements that came from here, 
enacted a law that the district clerk 
and the probate judge should have 
the selection of all jurors, in viola- 
tion of the right of jury trial, as it 
is known among the Anglo-Saxon 
race, under conditions as they ex- 
isted here. There came an army 
against us, sent out as a result of 
lying statements made by a mail 
contractor, who had an axe to 
grind ; absolutely without any justi- 
fication for such action by the gov- 



ernment. And so, throughout the 
whole breadth and length of our 
history, we have been the objects 
of bitter slander, misrepresentation, 
vile abuse, and persecution to a 
large extent. 

And have we returned this char- 
acter of treatment? I would ask 
anyone to point to any law passed 
in the legislative history of this peo- 
ple and this state wherein we have 
returned injustice for injustice, or 
persecution for persecution. Away 
back in the early days of the his- 
tory of this Territory when our 
people were in the majority, when 
there were very few non-"Mor- 
mons," in fact, when we made all 
the laws, and the whole public sen- 
timent was our way, there was not 
passed, and there is not to be found 
in the statutes of the Territory of 
Utah, one law that in any way dis- 
criminated against those who were 
not of our faith and in favor of our 
co-religionists. There has never 
been any intolerance toward such 
as were not of our faith or belief. 
So far as religion is concerned, 
they have even been encouraged ; 
they have at least been treated with 
perfect toleration ; and their 
schools have not been molested. It 
is possible that occasionally win- 
dows of their churches have been 
broken, by mischievous urchins, but 
I doubt if this has happened more 
frequently than with the meeting- 
houses of our own people. Outside 
of such trivialities as this, non- 
"Mormons" have been treated with 
a true spirit of charity. So far as 
political rights are concerned, con- 
sider those who in olden days made 
fierce attacks against us, with vitu- 
peration and determination, some of 
them unscrupulously — since the di- 
vision upon party lines was made, 
what has been the treatment of 



ELDER NEPHI PRATT. 



103 



those men? They have been given 
many of the chief political positions 
within the gift of the "Mormon" 
people. Thus have we returned 
good for evil ; and I desire to say 
that, in the whole line of our minis- 
trations, politically, morally, and 
every other way, we have accorded 
those not of our faith fair, just and 
square treatment. We do believe, 
then, my brothers and sisters, in the 
perfect law of liberty, and our lives 
prove it. 

We demand for ourselves the 
right to worship God as we see fit, 
as guaranteed by the Constitution. 
This sentiment is a fundamental 
characteristic of Mormonism; and 
it is to our credit and honor that 
we have always been willing to ex- 
tend this privilege to others, and 
defend their right thereto, though 
very often we have been made the 
objects of intolerance and vitupera- 
tion. 

God grant that we may continue 
true to the truth, true to the glo- 
rious principles we have espoused. 
We do not contemplate yielding or 
relinquishing our religious belief, 
for, thank God, there is room un- 
der the broad aegis of the American 
Flag to worship as we see fit, and 
we ought to be and are inspired 
with a disposition to concede to all 
others, the God-given privilege of 
worshiping as they see fit. God 
bless us. Amen. 

Sister Edith Grant and the choir 
sang, "Sometime we'll understand." 

ELDER NEPHI PRATT. 

(President of Northwestern States 
Mission.) 
Brethren and sisters, the joy that 
I have felt in the teaching of my 
brethren in this conference is be- 



yond my ability to express. I came 
down from the Northwestern 
States mission on purpose to be fed 
with the bread of life, to have my 
faith encouraged, built up and 
strengthened, and to hear the 
Prophet of the Lord and his coun- 
selors, and the Apostles that the 
Lord has chosen, that I may feel 
the influence of the spirit that is 
upon them. How thankful I am 
that I am accounted worthy to be 
numbered among this people. Could 
there be any grief so great as that 
which would come to us if we knew 
that we should be cast away from 
the associations of this people, 
either in time or eternity? I feel 
like the disciples of the Lord did 
when He said unto them, "Will ye 
leave me also," and they replied, 
"Lord, if we leave Thee, where 
shall we go?" I believe that God 
has blessed us in this day, in mel- 
lowing our hearts and preparing 
our souls for the Gospel of Jesus 
Christ, more than He has blessed 
any other people that ever lived 
upon the face of the earth. He has 
poured down knowledge upon us, 
such as the world has never seen, 
except the very few Prophets He 
raised up throughout the ages. Let 
us, then, my brethren and sisters, 
hold fast to that which God has 
entrusted to us. How shall we an- 
swer to the Lord if we are unfaith- 
ful to the doctrines, principles and 
covenants that we have made and 
have learned from God? 

Repentance of sins, and forsak- 
ing weaknesses, has been a theme 
of the servants of God at this con- 
ference. It has rested upon me of 
late that I need to repent of the 
weaknesses and follies of which I 
am guilty, that I need to command 
my family after me, and to plead 
with them, that when I set them a

good example they should follow 
in my footsteps, and cease to fritter 
away the great opportunities of sal- 
vation that God has given them in 
this day. 

I believe in the doctrine that has 
been proclaimed from this stand 
this afternoon, that man has the 
greatest gift and blessing in hav- 
ing the right to be an agent unto 
himself ; that he must stand upon . 
the merits and worthiness of his 
own character, and not lean upon 
anybody else. We believe that free 
agency was given to man in the 
beginning, and that .all the spirits 
that God created had their agency 
to do as they would in the spiritual 
world and in this world, wherever 
they are placed. We believe that 
there were righteous people, spirits, 
sons and daughters of God, that 
lived in accordance with the words 
of the Father and His Son Jesus 
Christ, in the world of spirits. We 
believe also that there were rebels 
among the children of the Lord in 
the world of spirits, and that be- 
cause of their agency they made 
trouble in the eternal world, until 
the wickedness of Lucifer, the son 
of the morning, rendered it neces- 
sary that the heavens should be rid 
of him, and he was then cast out 
and hurled to the earth. The dis- 
ciples in speaking to the Lord con- 
cerning the man who had been born 
blind, said : "Who did sin, this man 
or his parents, that he should be 
born blind?" If there had not been 
such a principle as free agency in the 
spirit world, it would have been a 
very foolish question on the part 
of the disciples of the Lord to ask, 
"did this man sin before he was 
born?" There could have been no 
sin if there was no agency. It is my 
belief that our Father's children, 
having been nurtured and taught 



by Him (through how many ages 
no one knows), the diligent and 
faithful, those who loved to hear 
His voice, and that took upon them- 
selves to be subject and accept the 
teachings of their divine Father 
and of His beloved Son, were bless- 
ed of the Lord in being permitted 
to come to the earth. God made 
no mistake when He chose Abra- 
ham to be the great ancestor of Is- 
rael. He lived with the Lord, and 
the Lord beheld that he was one of 
the noblest and most splendid char- 
acters, and He chose him to be the 
father of Israel, to the increase of 
whose kingdom there should be no 
end; and in blessing He blessed 
him, and in multiplying He multi- 
plied him. The blessing of Abra- 
ham has rested upon this people. 
They are His children, and have 
heard the voice of the Good Shep- 
herd. They were born in different 
parts of the earth, and came 
through the loins of righteous men 
and women who had lived up to the 
best knowledge and wisdom they 
had. The Latter-day Saints are 
descendants of those great men. 
We believe that when their fore- 
fathers were taken by the Lord 
through the countries of Europe, 
Ephraim was stubborn and refused 
to proceed. By hundreds and thous- 
ands the tribe of Ephraim stayed, 
and through the providence of God 
were preserved, so that the blood of 
Ephraim is found among the coun- 
tries of Europe, and on the islands 
of the sea, greatly predominating 
in England and the Scandinavian 
countries. When these children of 
Abraham, through Jacob's son Jos- 
eph, and Joseph's son Ephraim, 
heard the Gospel, it entered into 
their hearts ; they loved it and they 
have embraced it, many of them. 
The Lord has favored us, and

lias redemed us as far as we are 
pure in His sight, and lived the law 
of the Gospel. I know, my breth- 
ren and sisters that these things are 
true, and I know that the blessings 
of God rest upon His people ; that 
the Gospel is here now for the last 
time, and the Prophets and Apos- 
tles of the Lord Jesus Christ are 
here, and they shall stand. The ma- 
chinations of the wicked shall fail, 
the hand of God shall be against 
them. In His own time we will tri- 
umph in the world by righteous- 
ness, and mercy, and the love of 
God that we have, and the love of 
His children that we exhibit. The 
names of our oppressors, and those 
who seek to bring destruction up- 
on God's people, shall be remem- 
bered only for the infamies they 
have committed. "Mormonism" will 
be here a thousand years from now, 
when righteousness shall reign, but 
the wicked shall sleep in the dust 
until the time when the Lord will 
bring salvation to them. 

May the Lord bless us and 
strengthen us, that we may endure 
to the end, I ask in the name of 
Jesus Christ. Amen.

(President of Eastern States Mis- 
sion.) 

I suppose we have all been 
taught to say, "Thy kingdom 
come, thy will be done on earth 
as in heaven." For eighteen 
hundred years this prayer has 
been offered by those who have 
known something of the Gospel, 
by those who have read the 
teachings of our Master. If you 
comprehend the responsibility 
connected with receiving the 
Gospel, you realize that before 



any truth is established in the 
world, whether it be a religious, 
political or scientific truth, it is 
sure to run counter to some creed, 
custom or condition. It requires 
effort, study and sacrifice upon 
the part of those who are en- 
trusted to make known any God- 
given truths to the world. The 
Jews sought after light. All Israel 
has been looking forward for ages, 
you may say, to the time when 
the Messiah would come, when 
the millenium would be ushered 
in, when the. kingdom of God 
would be established upon the 
earth, yet, when the Master came, 
and the attempt was made 
to introduce those principles 
which will tend to per- 
fect the individual, and institute 
a social system to unite them as 
one, that would establish the per- 
fect law of liberty, how few there 
were willing to enlist with Him 
and assist in the promulgation 
of those great truths, and how 
many were filled with envy and 
jealousy, determined to resist the 
Gospel, because they felt or, 
thought it run counter to those 
things already accepted, and to 
which they clung. How many 
schemes were resorted to in or- 
der to entrap the Son of God, get 
Him to commit Himself, or be- 
tray Himself in some way. How 
hard they sought to find occasion 
against Him. After the Phari- 
sees had tried many times, they 
selected a party of Herodians. 
This was a party who clustered 
around Herod, and the center of 
their political faith was that no 
tribute should be paid other than 
to Israel, because in paying trib- 
ute to heathen nations it was, in 
a way.acknowledging the heathen 
gods and decreasing reverence for 
the God of Abraham, Isaac and 



106 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Jacob. Hence they selected 
some of those Herodians to go to 
the Savior, because they thought 
He would imagine it was the most 
natural thing in the world for 
them to come to him and ask if 
they should pay tribute to Caesar, 
and they used nattering words, 
saying, We know that thou art 
true and carest for no man, tell 
us whether we should pay tribute 
unto Caesar or not. Thus they 
used smooth simulation to ac- 
complish their purpose. But the 
Savior could see through their 
cunning intent, and He said: Give 
me a coin. And when He had 
looked at it He asked, Whose 
image and superscription is 
thereon? They said to Him, 
Caesar's." Then He said, Ren- 
der to Caesar that which is 
Caesar's and unto God that which 
is God's. Some of them thought 
that this saying was a kind of 
subterfuge, used to put them off. 
But I do not believe that Jesus 
ever used subterfuge. I believe 
that in this is stated a great prin- 
ciple, that it is our duty to ren- 
der to Caesar that which is 
Caesar's, and even more our duty 
to render to God that which is 
God's. I believe it is possible 
to be loyal to the governments 
that are established among men, 
and also be loyal to the Kingdom 
of Heaven. , 

There are two systems of gov- 
ernment, or two powers by which 
men can be governed in the 
world ; one is the power of force, 
the other is the power of love. 
One operates from without, the 
other governs from within. The 
one is seen operating through the 
civil power of the world, and the 
other should be manifest through 
the Church' and Kingdom of God. 
These two powers can be exer- 



cised in the world without con- 
flicting with each other. When- 
ever men are controlled from 
above, whenever their hearts 
beat loyally to Jesus Christ, and 
they feel to obey the command- 
ments of God,whenever they give 
ear to His Holy Spirit, that Spirit 
changes their carnal nature into 
its divine character, and they ex- 
hibit kindness meekness, gentle- 
ness, longsuffering. charity and 
toleration that have been spoken 
of. They are lifted above mun- 
dane law. When all men are 
converted to the truth, and come 
in possession of the Holy Spirit,, 
and are actuated by it, and their 
souls are filled with that divine 
love which is an attribute of 
Deity, then force will be removed 
from the world, and bv the nower 
of love, and by it alone, can the 
kingdoms of the world be broken- 
to pieces. 

The world has suffered much 
from priestcraft uniting with 
kingcraft, and people have be- 
come fearful of the combination. 
I bear testimony to you, my 
brethren and sisters, and all his- 
tory will bear me out in the as- 
sertion that while men have suf- 
fered from priestcraft the world 
has never suffered from Priest- 
hood. The world has received 
all its blessings, and its idea of 
liberty through the Holy Priest- 
hood — the idea that all are born 
free and equal. You will remem- 
ber that it was under the leader- 
ship of a Prophet of God under 
and bv virtue of the authority of 
the Holv Priesthood, that the 
first grand movement for liberty 
was instituted, that it was 
through Him it was conducted, 
and under His teachings that the 
first representative government 
in history was established. The

economics established by Moses 
are the greatest in the world to- 
day. The laws which we have 
received through him are the, 
foundation of the moral and the 
civil laws of today. I will call 
your attention to some of the 
economics of Moses. He gave 
instructions that when the chil- 
dren of Israel went and inhabited 
the land of Canaan that the land 
should be divided, not according 
to the serivces that any man had 
rendered in the army, not because 
of any position that he occupied, 
but that it should be divided ac- 
cording to the number in each 
tribe or family. Probably that 
is the only case in history of that 
kind. Even in" England, the 
land was divided to the warriors 
according to their service in the 
army, and according to their pow- 
er and influence over the people, 
and for the very purpose of con- 
trolling those civil governments. 
So too in ancient Greece, the land 
was divided according to their 
services and their strength. But 
not so in Israel, for among them 
the land was divided according 
to the number in the respective 
families, and the laws were such 
that those lands would remain in 
the possession of each family, and 
could not be taken from them by 
chicanery or fraud. There was 
no such thing as the eternity 
clause in any deed that was writ- 
ten in Israel, which had to do 
with the lands of the people. And 
so too I could call your attention 
to the administration of just 
judgment by the Priesthood in 
this day and age of the world. 
Who has suffered from Priest- 
hood? Those who have trusted 
the leaders in this Church, the 
men whom God has honored with 
authority from on hisrh,know that 



in the settlement of any lands 
that the Saints have occupied, in 
Missouri, Illinois, and in the set- 
tlement of these beautiful valleys, 
every effort was put forth, so far 
as the influence of President 
Young and those associated with 
him was concerned, that the land 
should be divided into small por- 
tions, that every man should re- 
ceive according to the size of his 
family, according to his needs, and 
that no man should hold large 
tracts of land to keep others from • 
it. 

My brethren and sisters, and 
friends, I want to say, in conclu- 
sion, that I feel we ought to have 
confidence in the Holy Priest- 
hood, and that we should abide 
by their counsels, and continue 
to trust them. I bear my testi- 
mony to you that I know the Gos- 
pel is true, that has been restored 
in this day and age. If we will 
be faithful to it we will secure 
hardiness in this world and eter- 
nal life in the world to come. I 
ask God's blessings to rest upon 
each and every one of us in the 
name of Jesus. Amen. 



ELDER REED SMOOT. 

I wish, in behalf of my brethren 
of the Apostles, and of President 
Smith and his counselors, to thank 
you for attendance at this session 
of the conference. We greatly ap- 
preciate the same, and say unto you, 
May God bless you in your labors. 
May He inspire all the people with 
the desire to keep His command- 
ments. Mav He lead you by the 
inspiration of His Holy Spirit to 
understand the call of the True 
Shepherd, that you may not in any 
way, shape, or form be deceived or 
drawn away from the path of truth

and righteousness by the sophistry 
of wicked men. We love all men, 
and our mission is to save souls, ev- 
ery one of the souls of the sons and 
daughters of our heavenly Father. 
It is also our mission to protect the 
Church and her interests in all the 
world. My prayer and hope, and 
desire is that God will give us the 
strength and determination to 
serve Him and walk in His ways. 
I pray you, my brethren and sisters, 
to not be discouraged. I testify to 
you, in the name of Jesus Christ, 
that God, the Father, is at the head 
of this work, and all will be well in 
Zion if we are true and loyal unto 
Him. 

Peace be in the homes of the 
Latter-day Saints, peace in your 
hearts, my brethren and sisters ; and 
God grant that His blessings, the 
choicest blessings of heaven, and 
eternal life, which is the greatest 
gift of God, may come to you. I 
ask it in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 

The choir sang the anthem, "God 
is My Song." 

Benediction was pronounced by 
Elder Horace H. Cummings. 



OUTDOOR MEETING. 

A large and attentive congrega- 
tion assembled on the lawns ad- 
joining the Bureau of Information 
building at 2 p. m. Elder Benja- 
min Goddard presided. The volun- 
teer choir and congregation, under 
the direction of Prof. Charles Kent, 
sang the hymn beginning, "O, ye 
mountains high." 

Prayer was offered by Elder A. 
L. Booth. 



Continued by singing, "The time 
is far spent." 

Elder Benjamin Goddard wel- 
comed the saints and asked for the 
Spirit of God to assist all who 
should take part in the meeting. 
He rejoiced in the spirit of harmony 
and good will that exists among the 
people, and said he had never met 
with the saints in general confer- 
ence when they felt happier and 
more united or manifested more 
faith in the work of God than they 
do today, and he felt that this con- 
dition should be regarded as a suf- 
ficient answer to all who may as- 
sail us. 

ELDER ELIAS S. KIMBALL. 

(pres't of blackfoot stake.) 

Said that only on a few occasions 
in the Southern States mission had 
he preached to the people in the 
open air, and he. had often won- 
dered if he should be able to meet 
the task of proclaiming the gospel 
to a traveling congregation, as our 
elders often do when they are 
preaching to the people in the 
world. He bore testimony to the 
truth of the work in which the Lat- 
ter-day Saints are engaged and 
spoke of his faith in the people. 
He said that when a man is under 
the influence of the Spirit of God he 
has perfect faith and confidence in 
the work of the Lord. The Saints 
will be successful in carrying the 
gospel to every nation, kindred, 
tongue and people and in building 
up the kingdom of God in the 
earth. 

ELDER JOSEPH E. ROBINSON. 

(PRESET OF CALIFORNIA MISSION.) 

Said he was grateful to have the 
privilege of attending this confer-

ence, and felt that it is a good thing 
amidst the conflicting affairs of 
mankind to know that you belong- 
to the Church and kingdom of God. 

Elder Robinson read from Matt. 
x;ii, 44-46, in which the kingdom of 
God is likened unto a pearl of great 
price. He related some of his ex- 
periences and those of the saints, 
during the destruction of the city of 
San Francisco by earthquake and 
fire, and said he felt assured of the 
wondrous value of this pearl that 
made men rich in the knowledge of 
God and in the knowledge that Je- 
sus is the Christ, and that through 
the gate of baptism men may be- 
come initiated into the kingdom of 
God, and if they live, they live unto 
Christ, or whether they die, they 
die unto Christ. 

When the forces of nature were 
rent asunder there was no fear in 
the hearts of the Latter-day Saints. 
They possessed their souls in pa- 
tience. They recognized the pro- 
tecting hand of God, while others 
seemed to be sunk in deep apathy, 
beside themselves, distraught, pray- 
ing to the Lord to deliver them and 
lost to all regard for that which was 
humane. Burglary, plunder, loot 
and murder were indulged in dur- 
ing the first hours of that terrible 
catastrophe, and many came to the 
Latter-day Saints for piotection. 
When the flames drew near one 
man came to us and said, "I trust 
my wife and cfeild into your keep- 
ing. If anything happens to me I 
want, you to protect them as you 
would your own life. If it becomes 
necessary I want you to take her 
life to save her honor." 

"God had His hand over His 
children. Some who had departed 
from the parental roof and were in 
that great city were preserved. Not 



one who bore the name of Saint 
was hurt or even received a scratch. 
The property of our people was 
saved by insurance, or by being in 
that district which was not devas- 
tated by fire. 

"Six years ago this month Presi- 
dent Brigham Young, of the quor- 
um of the Twelve, visited in that 
state and I heard him warn the peo- 
ple and tell them it was not far dis- 
tant when that great city should be 
destroyed by earthquake and fire, 
and it made such an impression up- 
on some of the saints that they 
wanted to leave the city at once. 

"I had been promised by another 
Apostle, along with some boys in 
St. George, that if faithful we 
would be sent into the world to 
preach the Gospel, and that we 
would see cities shaken to pieces, 
burnt and sunk, after we had de- 
livered our message. 

"We had gathered in a confer- 
ence capacity, and some visiting 
brethren going to the South Sea 
Islands were present. Tuesday 
night, after having met with some 
opposition on the streets of the city, 
23 of us bowed in prayer in the mis- 
sion home at midnight, and I re- 
member the fervor of the Elder who 
prayed. He prayed earnestly that 
God would shake the city, for we 
had been preaching to the inhab- 
itants year after year and not mak- 
ing any particular impression upon 
them. When the quake came he 
rushed into my room and asked me 
if this was an answer to his prayer." 

President Robinson expressed 
his thankfulness for a knowledge 
of the Gospel, which is the power 
of God unto salvation. It has with- 
in it that which will save and up- 
lift all mankind and solve every 
problem of humanity.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Prof. Charles Kent sang feeling- 
ly the hymn entitled, "Kind words 
are sweet tones of the heart." 

ELDER WILLIAM T. JACK. 

(pres't of cassia stake) 

Said he felt to rejoice that his heart 
was in full accord with the spirit 
and teachings that we have listened 
to at this session of conference. His 
parents had been converted by the 
Gospel sound, and had emigrated to 
these valleys of the mountains, and 
he had been privileged to carry the 
word of the Lord to his fellowmen 
in the missionary field where he had 
labored. Rejoiced in the possession 
in his soul of that peace which the 
Gospel alone can bring to us. 

He exhorted the young, upon 
whom the enemies of this Church 
are endeavoring to exercise in- 
fluence to lead them astray, to re- 
member their fathers, and mothers 
and the sacrcifices they have made 
for them, that they might be 
brought up under the principles of 
the Gospel ; to be true to God, to 
neighbors and friends, the members 
and authorities of the Church. 

Elder Jack reverted to the pat- 
riotism and splendid citizenship 
manifested by the early Saints, the 
pioneers, when they left their wives 
and families to fight the battles of 
this nation ; and prayed God to bless 
the memory of those, true patriots, 
and bless their descendants and 
keep them in the faith that they may 
be inspired by the lives of their 
fathers. 

"Let us return to our homes with 
an increased determination to do 
our duty, and if you will, I prom- 
ise you that the Spirit of God will 
rest upon you and cause you to re- 
joice even in the midst of adverse 
circumstances." 



A violin solo, "Nearer my God to 
Thee," was rendered in a most feel- 
ing manner by Prof. W. C. Clive, 
assisted by Organist Clifford Clive. 

ELDER THOMAS E. BASSETT. 

(PRES'T OF FREMONT STAKE) , 

Contrasted the teachings accepted 
by the world a few hundreds of 
years ago with those doctrines be- 
lieved in by the world today, to 
show how thankful we should be 
for the privilege of living in this 
dispensation when the human fam- 
ily is emerging from darkness into 
the rays of everlasting light. The 
glorious truths of the Gospel coin- 
cide exactly with the true learning 
that is given to man in this century. 
Fie bore testimony that the princi- 
ples of the Gospel as revealed to the 
Prophet Joseph Smith, are the 
truths of Heaven. As well may the 
puny hand of man try to stop the 
flow of the Mississippi as the ene- 
mies of truth attempt to stop the 
onward progress of the work of the 
Lord. 

Singing by the congregation, 
"Guide us O Thou great Jehovah." 

Benediction was pronounced by 
Elder Geo. H. Brimhall. 



CLOSING SESSION. 

In the Tabernacle, at 2 p. m. 

President Joseph F. Smith called 
the meeting to order. 

The choir sang, "True to the 
Faith." 

Prayer was offered by Bishop 
Robert T. Burton. 

The choir sang a selection en- 
titled "With sheathed swords."

Individual responsibility in Church af- 
fairs. — Be loval and true because it is 
right. — The Holy Spirit a more sure 
guide than reason. — Who fails to per- 
form dutv is untrue to self. 

Along with the enjoyment of the 
spirit of this conference my soul 
has had a struggle with a feeling of 
■dread of this moment, and if I am 
not able to make you hear, my 
brethren and sisters, it is because 
a great deal of my energy has been 
-expended in suspense. I pray for 
your sympathy, and for your faith 
and prayers, that the words which 
I utter may conform to the spirit 
•of this conference. If you have been 
affected as I am by that spirit, then 
you are each stronglv impressed 
with your individual responsibility. 
Probably you more strongly appre- 
ciate than ever before that this 
Church organization depends upon 
all the people, not upon just a few ; 
and that those members who fail 
to carry their share of responsibil- 
ity are not wholly true to their 
brethren. 

President Toseph F. Smith, in 
"his opening address, expressed this 
sentiment, and nearly in these 
words : "I come home now to the 
Latter-day Saints determined to 
keep my covenants, to be true to 
my duty and loyal to my God." I 
wondered how many, bearing the 
Priesthood, would say the same 
thing, and will go home to their 
fellow-workers with that same de- 
termination in their hearts. How 
.many Patriarchs here assembled 
have said to themselves, I am de- 
termined to be true to my cove- 
nants, true to my brethren, true to 
God? How many of the High 
Priests throughout the Church 
have that same feeling within them? 
It burns into the heart of how many 



Seventies? How many of the 
thousands of Elders who have par- 
taken of the spirit of this conference 
have expressed this feeling? How 
many of the Lesser Priesthood? 
Into the hearts of how many of 
the Latter-day Saints has that sen- 
timent penetrated? It means that, 
into as many hearts as that feeling 
enters, there are as many members 
and officers in this Church who are 
determined to carry out their indi- 
vidual responsibility; that not be- 
cause it has been urged upon them 
by someone else ; no, that is not the 
true spirit of the Latter-day Saint. 
I believe we ought to be influenced 
in this as a crowd of sailors was 
governed by one of their number 
many years ago. It was during the 
anti-slavery agitation, and a meet- 
ing was called in Fanueil Hall, Bos- 
ton. Some sailors had been hired 
to break up the meeting. They went 
there in a body, danced around on 
the floor, sang, yelled, and in every 
way possible tried to prevent the 
orators, from addressing the meet- 
ing. In vain were they appealed 
to. Their love of liberty, the mem- 
ory of their old home, the honor of 
Massachusetts, all were invoked ; 
but still they continued their dis- 
turbance and refused to be quiet. 
Suddenly a man, evidently one of 
their number, arose. Quieted for a 
moment by his appearance, thinking 
they had found a champion, the 
mob ceased its noise. The man 
said, "Boys, I would not be quiet 
unless I had a mind to." Encour- 
aged by this remark, the mob burst 
into loud applause, which lasted 
probably five minutes. When it 
ceased, because of the men's desire 
to hear more, the man continued : 
"No, I would not be quiet if I didn't 
have a mind to : but, if I were you 
/ would have a mind to, not because 
of the memory of this hall, not for 



GENERAL- CONFERENCE. 



the honor of Massachusetts, not for . 
loyalty to her government only, but 
because you are men ; and honor- 
able men always stand up for the 
liberty of right, justice and free 
speech." They were quieted ; their 
manhood had been touched. As 
members of the Church in confer- 
ence assembled, I believe that we 
ought to go home determined to 
carry out the responsibility that is 
upon us, not merely because these 
brethren have urged us to do so, but 
because we have it in our souls to 
do it. 

And what is this responsibility 
that rests upon every member of the 
Church? I turn to the 107th sec- 
tion of the Doctrine and Covenants, 
and there find enumerated the du- 
ties of the various organizations of 
the priesthood, and I read in the 
99th paragraph the following : 

"Wherefore now let every man learn 
his duty, and to act in the office in which 
he is appointed, in all diligence." 

Two principles in that admoni- 
tion stand out as the duty of the 
officers to whom this revelation was 
given. First, the learning, the 
knowing what one's duty is ; sec- 
ond, to act in all diligence in the 
performance of that duty. To know 
one's duty, to learn the truth, is the 
duty of every Latter-day Saint, of 
every man and woman in the world, 
including those outside of this 
Church. All mankind, I believe, 
are being impelled, lifted upward 
by that Spirit which makes them 
desire the truth. In the political 
world even, you find great men who 
have been searching for political 
truth, for truths that would relieve 
political situations. In the world 
of morality you find great reform- 
ers reaching out for truths that will 
alleviate harmful social conditions. 



The same sentiment is found in the- 
financial world. Scientific men are 
among the foremost searchers af- 
ter truth. We were told this morn- 
ing about that Power which im- 
pelled Columbus to go out into the 
ocean. In response to that feeling 
inspired within him to demonstrate 
a truth of which he felt confident, 
he could not content himself; he 
had to give expression to it. There 
is a natural feeling which urges 
men and women towards truth ; it 
is a responsibility placed upon man- 
kind. That responsibility rests up- 
on the Latter-day Saints in a great- 
er degree than upon their fellow- 
men. If you turn to the 88th sec- 
tion you will find the following ad- 
monition : And as all have not 
faith, seek ye diligently and teach 
one another words of wisdom ; yea,, 
seek ye out of the best books words 
of wisdom. Seek learning" — how? 
"even by study," but not alone by 
study, as the world searches for it, 
"and also by faith." 

The Latter-day Saints have 
learned the truth that the everlast- 
ing Gospel has been restored. And 
what does this knowledge bring to 
them? It brings to all, who have 
honestly and sincerely obeyed the 
principles of repentance and bap- 
tism, the gift of the Holy Ghost, 
which enlightens their minds, 
quickens their understandings, and 
imparts unto them a knowledge of 
Christ. The Latter-day Saints 
have a guide, a help, a means to as- 
sist in their acquisition of truth, in 
their desire to know what their 
duty is, that the world does not- 
possess. And this guide is neces- 
sary ; man cannot find out truth ; he 
cannot find out God by intellect 
alone. It has been said that no 
man can find out God by a miscro- 
scope. Reason alone is not a suf- 



ELDER DAVID 0. McKAY. 



113 



ficient guide in searching for truth. 
There is another, higher, more sure 
guide than reason even. Dryden, 
I believe it is, who says : 

"Dim as the borrowed rays of moon and 
stars 

To lonely, weary, wandering travelers, 
Is Reason to the soul; and as on high 
Those rolling fires discover but the sky, 
Not light us here, so Reason's glim- 
mering ray 
Was lent, not to assure our doubtful 
way, 

But guide us uoward to a better day." 

Leads us to what day? To the 
sunlight of faith — that principle 
which draws our spirit into com- 
munion with the Higher Spirit 
which will bring all things to our 
remembrance, show us things to 
come, and teach us all things. To 
acquire that Spirit is the responsi- 
bility of the Latter-day Saint who 
would know truth. 

But knowing a thing, or merely 
feeling an assurance of the truth, is 
not sufficient. "To him who know- 
eth to do good and doeth it not, to 
him it is sin." Now, where are we? 
Think of the instructions that have 
been given during this conference. 
You and I know now, as probably 
we have never realized before, 
what the duty of the individual Lat- 
ter-day Saint is, and what the duty 
of the various organizations is. "To 
him who knoweth to do good and 
doeth it not, to him it is sin." 

This thought brings us to con- 
sider the second duty mentioned 
in this revelation by the Prophet 
Joseph Smith: "Wherefore now 
let every man learn his duty, and 
to act in the office in which he is 
appointed, in all diligence." The 
man who knows what his duty is 
and fails to perform it, is not true 
to himself ; he is not true to his 
brethren ; he is not living in the 



light which God and conscience 
provides. That is where we stand, 
and it comes right home to you ; it 
means me. When my conscience 
tells me that it is right to go along 
in a specified line, I am not true to 
myself if I do not follow that. Oh ! 
I know we are swayed by our 
weaknesses, and by influences from 
without; but it is our duty to walk 
in the straight and narrow path in 
the performance of every duty. And 
mark this : Every time we have op- 
portunity and fail to live up to 
that truth which is within us, ev- 
ery time we fail to express a good 
thought, every time we fail to per- 
form a good act, we weaken our- 
selves, and make it more difficult to 
express that thought or perform 
that act in the future. Every time 
we perform a good act, every time 
we express a noble feelinc we 
make it the more easy to perform 
that act or express that feeling an- 
other time. 

I am reminded of a circumstance 
of the Russian woman who felt 
sympathy ; she knew how to sympa- 
thize with the poor heroine on the 
theatre stage. This Russian lady 
sat in her box, comfortable in her 
furs and silks, and as she looked at 
the performance she wept in sym- 
pathy with the heroine who was 
suffering imaginary torments ; and 
while that Russian woman was 
sympathizing with the stage hero- 
ine, her own coachman froze to 
death on the carriage seat ouside, 
because of insufficient clothing. It is 
not enough to feel; we must act, so 
that it will benefit somebody. 

We have been reminded of our 
personal duties in regard to the 
Word of Wisdom, in regard to the 
Priesthood ; and we have been re- 
minded also of unity, of loyalty, of 
love for our enemies. Nearly every 
duty of the Latter-day Saint has 



114 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



been mentioned in this conference; 
there is one more which I wish to 
emphasize, as an application of this 
principle of individual responsibil- 
ity. When you go home to your 
ward, look around next Sunday and 
try to estimate how many of the 
Latter-day Saints are absent from 
the Sacrament meeting. It may be 
that there are twenty per cent, or 
fifty per cent absent. Suppose your 
estimate is fifty per cent ; then 
there are that many people in the 
Ward who are neglecting one of 
the duties of a Latter-day Saint. 
Upon whom does the responsibility 
of fetching in these brethren and 
sisters rest? First, in my opinion, 
it rests upon the Bishopric. As 
the Bishop sits there, let him look 
around, and notice if all the Presi- 
dents of the various organizations 
in the ward are present. If the presi- 
dents of the Priesthood quorums 
be absent, it is the duty of the Bish- 
opric, I think, to visit those offi- 
cers and bring them. They may 
go farther ; it is their duty to visit 
the various families and members 
who are absent and endeavor to 
bring them in. But it is not the 
Bishopric's meeting; this Church 
rests upon all, and not upon a few. 
If one of the Seven Presidents of 
the Seventies quorum in that ward 
is present, and he finds that some of 
the Seventies are absent, the re- 
sponsibility of bringing them to 
meeting rests upon him. If presi- 
dents of the various quorums of 
Deacons are present, they sboiild 
note what quorum members have 
absented themselves from that 
meeting, and let them assume the 
responsibility of visiting those 
members. And so throughout the 
various organizations in that Ward. 
Where is the responsibility, then? 
It is divided as it should be, as God 



intends it to be, among the people 
composing the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints ; the re- 
sponsibility does not rest upon the 
officers alone, it rests upon the 
members also. God has blessed 
them with — what? Wealth? No, 
probably not. With intellectual su- 
periority? Possibly not; but He 
has blessed them with moral 
strength, and with a knowledge of 
the Gospel, or else they were not 
true to themselves when they 
went down into the waters of bap- 
tism. He has blessed them with a 
knowledge of the truth ; and the 
knowledge of the truth is not 
enough unless it is expressed, un- 
less it is bringing others to that 
knowledge. That is the spirit and 
responsibility of the Latter-day 
Saint, and it rests upon all. Said 
the poet : 

"Admire the goodness of Almightv God ! 
He riches gave, He intellectual strength 
To few, and therefore now commands to 

be, 

Or rich or learned, or promises reward 
Of peace to these. On all He moral 
worth 

Bestowed ; and moral tribute asked from 
all. 

And who that could not pay? Who born 
so poor 

Of intellect so mean, as not to know 
What seemed the best : and knowing, 

might not do? 
As not to know that God and conscience 

bade? 

And what they bade not able to obey? 
And he who acted thus obeyed the law 
Eternal and its promises reaped of 
peace ; 

Found peace this way alone : who sought 
else, 

Sought mellow grapes beneath the icy 

pole ; 

Sought blooming roses on the cheek of 
death ; 

Sought substance in a world of fleeting 
shades.'' 

"Wherefore let every man learn hi? 
duty, and act in all diligence in the per- 
formance of it. He that is slothful shall 



ELDER DAVID 0. McKAY. 



115 



not be counted worthy to stand, and he 
that learns not his duty and shows him- 
self not approved, shall not be counted 
worthy to stand." 

I do not know whether I have 
succeeded in expressing the feelings 
of my heart so that you under- 
stand them ; but I wish to leave this 
thought: that every man, every 
woman, must bear a part of the 
rseponsibility of this Church. Feel- 
ing that, does not necessarily make 
him imagine that it is resting upon 
him only. There is no man so im- 
portant who cannot sink without 
making even a bubble, not a ripple 
in the great ocean of life; at the 
same time his importance is so 
great that his actions go a long 
way towards establishing the pow- 
er, the dignity, the advancement of 
God's kingdom on earth. Then, no 
matter where we are, if we are in 
the hills one week from today or 
tomorrow, wherever circumstances 
or business affairs may call us, be it 
in the canyon or elsewhere, and we 
are tempted, on a cold morning, to 
break the Word of Wisdom by 
drinking two or three cups of tea 
or coffee, let us feel then the re- 
sponsibility of right. Let each one 
say to himself, "The responsibil- 
ity of membership in the Church 
is upon me ; I will not yield. What 
though nobody sees me, I know 
and God knows when I yield, and 
every time I yield to a weakness I 
become weaker myself and do not 
respect myself." If you are in busi- 
ness, and your companions say, 
"Come, let us go in and have a 
drink on this bargain, or this sale," 
let your answer be, No, no! What 
though your thirsty appetite makes 
you long; for it, be men, be Latter- 
day Saints, and say, "No; the re- 



sponsibility of membership in the 
Church rests upon me." When 
you are tempted to stay away from 
that Seventies' meeting, from that 
Elders' meeting, from that Dea- 
cons' quorum, and you shrink from 
going there, because you feel you 
will not be interested, say, "I will 
go; the duty of a Latter-day Saint 
is upon me ; the responsibility of 
membership in that quorum is upon 
me, and I must go and help make 
that meeting interesting." And so, 
if you carry that feeling in all the 
duties of a Latter-day Saint, you 
will come to the conclusion that 
every time you stand by the truth, 
you are more of a man, you are 
more in harmony with God's Spirit. 
He loves to dwell in such taber- 
nacles ; He will guide you into all 
truth ; He will make your soul to 
reioice, and you will know this Gos- 
pel is true. "He that heareth these 
sayings of mine and doeth them" is 
the one that is likened unto the wise 
man. "It is not everyone that say- 
eth Lord, Lord, that shall enter into 
the kingdom of heaven ; but he that 
doeth the will of my Father which 
is in heaven." "Therefore, be ye 
doers of the word, and not hearers 
only." 

God bless you and all of us, that 
we may be Latter-day Saints in 
deed, children of our Father, stand- 
ing always, everywhere, in all con- 
ditions, for the right, for virtue, fur 
purity, and for the duty that rests 
upon us in our various quorums. 
This is my prayer, and I ask it in 
the name of Jesus. Amen. 

Sister Emma Lucy Gates sang 
very effectively the beautiful sa- 
cred solo, "Angels ever bright and 
fair."

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



ELDER GEORGE REYNOLDS. 

It is a great surprise to me, my 
brethren and sisters, to be called 
upon to address this congregation, 
and I trust you will give me your 
sympathy and your faith and 
prayers. I hope that all through my 
life I shall ever consider the King- 
dom of God and His righteousness 
first, last, and all the time. To me, 
this is the Kingdom of God or 
nothing; and the nothing is an im- 
possibility to my mind. I realize 
with every fibre of my being that 
God has established in this genera- 
tion His work, never more to be 
overthrown. I also understand, 
perhaps only partially, that great 
truth which Brother McKay has 
just endeavored to impress upon 
us,- that we all have an individual 
responsibility to see that the work 
is done which God requires at our 
hands ; that we do it by His help 
and through His grace to the best 
of our ability; and that we must 
not leave to others the work that 
God has placed upon our shoulders. 
I believe most thoroughly that a 
man to be his best, as a father, as a 
husband, or as a citizen of the na- 
tion to which he belongs, must be a 
man who tries to serve God, who 
endeavors to keep the law of the 
Lord, who believes in God and in 
rewards and punishments, who lis- 
tens to and cultivates the voice of 
his conscience, and who seeks with 
all his powers of heart and mind, 
body and soul to do that which he 
believes to be true and righteous. 
I do not believe for a moment that 
a man is better prepared to help his 
fellows who is an unbeliever in God 
and in our Redeemer, and in the 
work of the atonement that He ac- 
complished here. In my opinion, he 
is the highest type of man, the best 



citizen, the strongest, the bravest 
and the best in every relationship of 
life, who is in deed and in truth a 
Christian, or, as I would rather put 
it, a Saint, a servant of God. There 
may sometimes thoughts arise in 
our minds with regard to policy; 
time serving ideas that may afflict 
us for a short time; but I believe 
the sober, second thought of every 
man and every woman who has re- 
ceived a portion of the Spirit of 
God, is that it pays to serve God. It 
pays to do the best we can, and to 
learn to do better. It pays to keep 
our covenants. It pays now, and 
will pay eternally. God grant that 
we all may see the truth in this 
light ; that we may use all the ener- 
gies and faculties that God has 
blessed us with to His service. And 
while I am saying this I am aware 
of the truth taught by the Prophet 
Nephi, that it is by grace we are 
saved, after all that we can do. But 
grace having performed its work, 
and we having received the benefits 
of the atonement of our Lord and 
Savior, Jesus Christ, we should en- 
deavor to do our part by serving 
God with all the strength we have 
received- from Him. 

I want to bear my testimony that 
I have been acquainted with the 
Presidents of this Church intimate- 
ly for many years — with Presidents 
Brigham Young, John Taylor, Wil- 
t ford Woodruff, Lorenzo Snow and" 
Joseph F. Smith; and though in 
minor particulars and characteris- 
tics they differed very materially, 
yet they were all the men of God's 
choice, the men for the hour, the 
men whom God selected as the lead- 
ers of His people, and they all did 
the work that God required at their 
hands. They were His mouth- 
pieces, and they accomplished that 
which He placed them in the oosi- 



ELDER J. GOLDEN KIMBALL. 



117 



tion to fulfill, every one of them. 
They were all prepared of God to 
■do the work assigned them, and 
they all did it, and did it well. Not- 
withstanding the differences and 
peculiarities of their minor charac- 
teristics, there were some certain 
things in which they were all alike, 
namely, their love for the truth, 
their faith in God, their willingness 
to listen to His word, their uncom- 
promising devotion and integrity to 
God and His work, their full belief 
in the divine calling of the Prophet 
Joseph. These characterized them 
all, and God was with them, 
and He enabled them to accomplish 
the work which He called them to 
do. I want to bear this testimony 
and I do so because I know it is 
true. I know further, that God will 
remain with us if we will be true to 
Him ; and more than this, I know 
that He is abundantly capable of 
taking care of His work. At the 
same time we must do our part ; do 
it in love, in faith, in zeal, and then 
the blessing of God will follow and 
His purposes will be accomplished. 
We none of us need to be afraid, 
my brethren and sisters, for God's 
work will prevail. The truth is 
mighty, and it will prevail. May 
we all remember this and act as 
though we believed it, and consci- 
entiously do our part, bearing the 
portion of the responsibility that 
rightly belongs to us, all to the 
glory of God, as He will have it, for 
it belongs to Him. This is mv 
prayer, through Jesus our Re- 
deemer. Amen. 



ELDER J. GOLDEN KIMBALL. 

My brethren and sisters, I hope 
you have confidence in me, and 
that I can hold your attention for 



a few moments. I feel happy, just 
as happy as a man can feel with 
the rheumatism. 

I have been thinking, not only 
today, but during this conference 
of a testimony that my father bore 
when he was fifty-four years old, 
and it gives me a great deal of 
pleasure to know that I am now 
fifty-three years of age and have 
the same testimony that he had — - 
not one whit's difference ; that I 
have a knowledge of the truth of 
the Gospel. I have been taught it 
from my youth, just as I was 
taught in early days that a peach 
grew on a peach tree. I believe I 
have just as much knowledge of a 
peach now as the most scientific 
man in the world. I can tell a peach 
when I see it, and a peach tree ; but 
I cannot for the life of me tell how 
that peach grows on a peach tree, 
and neither can you. Now, there 
are many things about this work 
that I do not comprehend, but be- 
cause I cannot tell it all it does not 
prove that it is not true. I have 
studied the history of this Church, 
and I testify that this is the Lord's 
work, that He has given unto us 
Proohets and Apostles, the Holy 
Ghost, and all the gifts and bless- 
ings of the Gospel, and that we 
have been led' by inspired men. 

I now want to ask you Latter- 
day Saints if you have counted the 
cost of establishing this Church? 
Have you considered what it has 
cost thousands of men and women 
who have been valiant in the truth 
and died in the faith ? The country 
is fairly strewn with the bodies of 
our people from Salt Lake City to 
the east. Construction is very dif- 
ficult, destruction is easy. Ordinary 
men can criticize and destroy. It 
has required much sacrifice to es- 
tablish this Church. 



US 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



I feel grateful this day, my 
brethren and sisters, that I have 
the confidence of my brethren ; I 
must have it or I would not have 
been called to address you. I want 
also the confidence of the Saints. 
I say, God save the people; what 
can we do without them ? The Lord 
can accomplish great things, but 
He wants the people, and He will 
never be satisfied till He secures the 
hearts of the children of men. 

I desire to call attention to a 
thought that is in my mind; it is 
not new, however. I desire to ad- 
vise the Latter-day Saints to stop 
selling their inheritances. I call 
your atention to the fact that this 
earth is your habitation ; that this 
earth is your heaven, or will be. 
This earth is hell too, and there is 
a big lot of people in this hell now ; 
their lives are such that this earth 
is of that character to them. They 
have no peace of mind, no rest of 
body, and I pity them. This earth 
is your habitation while you are in 
the flesh. If this earth is to be 
your heaven, I think you had bet- 
ter have an inheritance here, don't 
you ? I do not believe the doctrine 
for one minute that you people, or 
myself (and I think I am as good 
as some of you), are going immedi- 
ately after death to the arms of Je- 
hovah. It will take some of us a 
long time to get there. You had 
better be very good and take care of 
this earth. 

My father had an inheritance in 
Independence, Missouri, and it has 
never been sold by him or his heirs 
to any living man. The time will 
come, as sure as the Lord reigns, 
when father will claim that inheri- 
tance. He had an inheritance in 
Salt Lake City, on the hill, a whole 
block, including where the Lafay- 
ette school is now built. I was born 



ir me Kimball mansion which now 
i 'mds on the same locality. I have 
a small place on that block, at least 
large enough to bury me in, and it 
is about all I can do to hold it. 
Why ? Because they tax me almost 
more than human nature can en- 
dure ; and the end is not yet ! Are 
you going to get frightened and 
run away somewhere? Are you 
going to sell out your inheritance 
every time you meet a difficulty? 
If the pioneers had done that they 
would have been going yet ; but 
they stopped in this barren waste, 
and they made it habitable for you 
and me. I tell you, God is not 
pleased with some of this people, 
because they are selling their inher- 
itances for a mess of pottage. I 
sold part of mine, and I confess 
that the money went through my 
fingers like water through a sieve. 
I don't know where it went, but I 
know I haven't got it. That is ex- 
actly what will happen to every Lat- 
ter-day Saint who sells his inheri- 
tance. The Lord wants you to stay 
in this country ; He does not want 
you to break for the woods. You 
have a right to every particle of 
land that you can secure legiti- 
mately and pay the taxes on. 

Now, I am going to give you a 
little fatherly advice, and I believe 
you won't take it. I advise the Lat- 
ter-day Saints, as Brother Smoot 
did, to take up and secure the waste 
land throughout the State of Utah, 
and other sections where Latter-day 
Saints reside. If the Saints will 
keep the commandments of God, if 
they will raise grain enough, build 
up cities, and emigrate the people 
we are converting in the world, 
eliminate selfishness and avaricious- 
ness, and divide up the land and 
make homes for the people ; if they 
will bless the land and dedicate it 



ELDER RULON S. WELLS.

to the Lord, let our friends come 
in here, and leave our gates open 
to the strangers, the bowels of the 
earth will be opened, and there will 
be produced therefrom riches more 
than we can contain. The time will 
come when the strangers will have 
little use for their money, they will 
come to this people for bread, and 
we will feed them and treat them 
kindly, notwithstanding some of 
them have acted miserably mean. 
Do you believe that doctrine? My 
father predicted it years ago, and 
some people are laughing over it 
now. I have heard some of them 
pooh-pooh it; but I stand as a son 
of my father, as a witness of the 
Lord, and testify to you that the 
time will come among this people 
when it will be fulfilled. 

Don't you go off in wild specu- 
lation, or have part in wildcat 
schemes. You are advised to raise 
grain. .You had better secure an 
inheritance ; get your titles and pay 
for the land. I say to you, in the 
language of the Prophet Joseph (\ 
suppose I dare quote his words) : 
"Be honest, be frank, and stop bow- 
ing and scraping to Gentile sophis- 
try." Go along and do your duty; 
follow counsel, and preach the 
Gospel to the nations of the earth. 
See that this Gospel is preached to 
every creature under heaven. I re- 
peat to you the words of a prom- 
ise made to my father, "Trouble not 
thyself about thy families, for the 
Lord will give them food and rai- 
ment, houses and lands, fathers and 
mothers, brothers and sisters, if you 
will preach this word." God bless 
you. Amen.

ELDER RTJLON S. WELLS. 

I have been deeply impressed, 
more than ever before, it seems to 
me, with the magnitude of this 
great work that we are engaged in 
as Latter-day Saints, and I am filled 
with wonder when I contemplate 
the great army of workers who are- 
engaged in this wonderful work 
which our Father has set His hand 
to do among the children of men. 
When I view this great con- 
gregation of Latter-day- Saints, 
I am also filled with wonder and as- 
tonishment at the enthusiasm that 
seems to fill the hearts of the Lat- 
ter-day Saints. I rejoice in that 
work every day of my life, and I re- 
joice in the companionship and 
fellowship of the Latter-day 
Saints ; for I feel proud that 
I am numbered among them, as one 
of those who have yielded obedi- 
ence to the Gospel of Jesus Christ. 

We read in the Holy Scriptures 
that, "Obedience is better than sac- 
rifice, and to hearken than the fat 
of rams." In this connection I am 
led to review in my own mind the 
great sacrifices that have been of- 
fered by this people; how when the 
Gospel first came to them and they 
received the same, they were willing 
to accept the testimony of humble 
Elders of the Church, and in doing 
so they, in many instances, ostra- 
cized themselves from their com- 
panions, from their fathers and 
mothers, and others that were near 
and dear to them, and ofttimes 
made sacrifice of all their earthly 
possessions. It meant that they 
were broken up in their business af- 
fairs ; it cost them their standing in 
society, and they lost the good will 
of their comoanions. And here at 
home we are sometimes called upon 
to make what might be termed sac-

rifices. We have a wonderful or- 
ganization. Not only have we the 
various organizations of the Church 
as it has been divided into Statkes 
and Wards, but we have also many 
auxiliary organizations, all of 
which give plenty of occupation to 
the laborers in Zion. We are called 
upon to attend many meetings, and 
to engage in many labors that seem 
to be very irksome and tiring. 
Sometimes we hear complaints 
among the Latter-day Saints that 
we have too many organizations, 
too many meetings to attend, re- 
quiring. too much of our time. We 
have to do this and that, or neglect 
those things that have been assign- 
ed to us. Yet our brethren and sis- 
ters willingly perform these' ser- 
vices. There are some, however, 
who do not do their duty willingly. 
Frequently calls are made upon us 
to go out into the world. Our sons 
are called and sent out to preach the 
Gospel to the nations of the earth. 
This involves a great expenditure of 
means. It involves a sacrifice, if it 
is regarded from the worldly stand- 
point. Yet our young men go will- 
ingly, and their parents are proud 
to have sons in the mission field. 
They are proud to know that their 
sons are laboring for the salvation 
of the souls of the children of men. 
I ask the question, Where in all the 
world will vou find a people that 
are willing to make these sacrifices 
and render this service without pay, 
present it as an offering unto the 
Lord whom they adore ? I say they 
are not to be found in all the world, 
outside of the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints. 

I wish to call attention to the fact 
that the laborer is worthy of his 
hire, and those that labor for Zion 
do not go without their reward. 
They are the best paid of all men 



and women upon t; .is earth, because 
they have enlisted in the service of 
the Most High, and He is the best 
paymaster of all. You nor I can do 
any service in the kingdom of 
God without being amply paid. 
What if we have forsaken father 
and mother? What if we have giv- 
en of our substance ? It matters not. 
The Savior said that He that would 
not forsake father and mother, 
wives and children, houses and 
lands, for His name's sake, was not 
worthy of Him; but he that will 
forsake father and mother, houses 
and lands, for His sake, shall re- 
ceive in this world an hundred fold, 
and in the world to come life ever- 
lasting. So that those who do labor 
for Zion should feel encouraged 
that in doing so they will receive an 
hundred fold. It matters not what 
you may be called to do, whether it 
be to preach this Gospel to the na- 
tions of the earth or to labor at 
home, God will reward you for your 
labor. If you are called upon to 
minister to the sick in the ward in 
which you live, God will reward 
you. If you are called upon to go 
from house to house and teach the 
Latter-day Saints, God will reward 
you an hundredfold. You cannot 
do anything for the kingdom of 
God without receiving a reward, be- 
cause sacrifice brings blessings, and 
blessings are dependent upon that 
which we do in the service of our 
Master. 

I was asked a question a short 
time ago, I think it was in the 
Woodruff stake of Zion, by one of 
the brethren there. He had been 
reading the Scriptures, and he 
found the saying of James the 
Apostle where it reads, "If any 
among you are sick, let him call in 
the Elders, and they will anoint 
with oil, and the prayer of faith

shall heal the sick. And if any 
have sinned, their sins shall be for- 
given them." He asked me the 
■question, "Whose sins w ; ll be for- 
given?" I had never thought of 
that before. The ordinance for the. 
healing 1 of the sick has not been in- 
stituted in the Church for the re- 
mission of sins, but for the healing 
of the sick. The ordinance which 
has been instituted for the purpose 
•of obtaining remission of sins is 
baptism, as we all understand. But 
here is a promise that if any have 
sinned, their sins shall be forgiven 
them. At first I did not know how 
to answer that question ; but after a 
moment's reflection it came to r^ie 
that anyone who received the Spirit 
of God, their sins would be for- 
given them. If we receive a remis- 
sion of sins it will qualify us to 
have the Spirit of God with us, and 
the very fact that we do obtain it 
is evidence that our sins have been 
forgiven. It is for that reason that 
"baptism has been instituted in the 
Church, in order that we may. by 
the laying 'on of hands, obtain the 
Spirit of God, because that Spirit 
cannot dwell in an unclean taber- 
nacle. The one that is administer- 
ed to, if he has the Spirit of the 
Lord resting upon him so that he 
may be healed by that ordinance, 
his sins have been forgiven, and 
the presence of God's Holy Spirit 
bears witness of it. 

My brethren and sisters, let us 
labor for Zion ; for you cannot do 
anything in the kingdom of God, 
magnifying your calling, enjoying 
the Spirit which issues forth from 
His divine presence, without haviur,' 
your sins remitted. And what a 
blessing that is ! It is better than 
gold ; it is better than the riches of 
this world. It is God's pay: it is 
the best pay that any man can get. 



God help us to be worthy of our 
hire, is my prayer in the name of 
Jesus Christ. Amen. 



ELDER JOSEPH W. M'MTIRRIN. 

My brethren and sisters, I cer- 
tainly feel that I am very highly 
honored to have the opportunity in 
this great gathering of the Latter- 
day Saints to lift up my voice, in 
connection with my brethren, in 
testimony of the glorious Gospel 
of the Lord Jesus Christ. I am 
impressed with a remark frequent- 
ly made by the president of a mis- 
sion under whom I at one time la- 
bored, wherein he declared that no 
one could do anything against the 
work of God, but for it. This dec- 
laration is in harmony with the 
statement made by President 
Smith at the opening of our con- 
ference, that our Father in heaven, 
in His loving kindness and mercy 
frequently overturned the plans and 
schemes of those who were opposed 
to His work, and their thwarted ef- 
forts result in the uplifting of the 
Church, and the advancement of 
His purposes among the children of 
men. It is very remarkable how 
futile have been the efforts of those 
who have been arrayed against the 
purposes of our Father in heaven. 
Despite their opposition, advance- 
ment has been made, growth day 
by day, extension in power and 
numbers, and, as we have heard al- 
ready in this conference, we are 
greater now than ever before. One 
of the brethren made the declara- 
tion that the close of each day 
found the work of God stronger 
than it was at the opening of the 
day. This is true, and this will 
continue to be our history. 

A few years ago I was laboring 



122 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



as a missionary in the City of Bris- 
tol, England, and at the invitation 
of a Mr. White, a freethinker, who 
had been very kind to the mission- 
aries, I attended a lecture that was 
delivered by the great English 
freethinker, Mr. Charles Brad- 
laugh. The title of his lecture was, 
"Is Christianity a persecuting re- 
ligion?" and he made a very dismal 
showing of what had been done in 
the name of Christian religion. I 
felt at the conclusion of his lecture 
that he had demonstrated beyond 
any question that dreadful per- 
secutions had been carried _ on 
by sects professing to be Christian. 
He did not show from the teach- 
ings of the Lord Jesus Christ that 
there was aught in the words which 
had fallen from His lips that taught 
any soul to persecute his fellows; 
but he gave the history of various 
denominations which, contrary to 
the teachings and example of the 
Redeemer, had engaged in persecu- 
tion. An opportunity was given at 
the close of the lecture to ask ques- 
tions, and a young man arose in 
the audience and presented a num- 
ber of queries to this effect : "Were 
not the early Christians very few 
in number and of but slight influ- 
ence and power in the world?" Mr. 
Bradlaugh answered, "Yes." "Was 
not the might, the power and the 
wisdom of the great government 
of Rome arrayed against that hand- 
ful of Christians; and, in connec- 
tion with the opposition of the gov- 
ernment and its soldiery, were not 
the religious prejudices of the age 
arrayed in much bitterness and de- 
termination against those early 
Christians ?" Mr. Bradlaugh again 
answered, "Yes." "Then," asked 
the young man, "if you do not be- 
lieve that Christianity is the religion 
of the Lord Jesus, and that it was 



founded and sustained by the mar- 
velous power of God, how do you 
account for the failure of the men 
who were arrayed in such over- 
whelming numbers against this lit- 
tle handful of Christians? How can 
you explain the continuation of 
Christianity and its spread among 
the children of men?" I was very 
much interested in that question, 
and wondered what manner of an- 
swer could be given by the great 
infidel ; for I knew that the power 
of God had been manifested in the 
preservation of the early Christians. 
Mr. Bradlaugh made this answer: 
"The Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints has had a more 
wonderful growth than the early 
Christians, and that in the face of 
the same manner of bitter hatred 
and opposition; do you believe that 
God Almighty is answerable for 
their preservation?" I did not feet 
that this was any answer to the 
question, but evidence that Mr. 
Bradlaugh was unable to answer. 
I felt that the young man might 
have asked, had he been a member 
of the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints, Why has not the 
Mormon Church been destroyed, 
inasmuch as a similar power and 
might has been arrayed against it, 
and the decree, made time and 
again, that its advancement should 
be stayed? What answer can be 
given ? 

You who may have doubt con- 
cerning the power of God in His 
protection of the Latter-day Saints 
and their wonderful preservation, 
or concerning His hand dealings 
with the early Christians, what an- 
swer can be given to the query, 
Why were not those early Chris- 
tians destroyed? Why was not 
the Church planted by the Redeem- 
er Himself uprooted in the days of 



ELDER CHARLES H. HART, 



its infancy? And the same ques- 
tion concerning the Latter-day 
Saints, why do we live? How is it 
that, long before this present day, 
"Mormonism" has not been de- 
stroyed from the earth root and 
branch? If we will study over the 
matter, the answer will be made 
clear to us, by the power and in- 
spiration of the Holy Spirit, be- 
cause God has organized this 
Church ; because He is fulfilling 
the promises that have been made 
through the mouths of ancient 
Prophets, that a work should be es- 
tablished among men in the latter 
days that never would be over- 
thrown, nor be given to another 
people. 

We need not marvel or wonder 
that we meet opposition, and mis- 
representation, and that we are evil- 
ly-spoken of, if God has establish- 
ed us ; for the Savior Himself 
taught the doctrine to His disciples, 
"Ye are not of the world ; but I 
have chosen you out of the world ; 
therefore the world hateth you." 
That is the only explanation that 
can be given in truth to the opposi- 
tion, the evil speaking, and hatred 
that has followed this work. In 
the same chapter of John's Gospel, 
where the passage above is given, 
we read, "But this cometh to pass, 
that the word might be fulfilled that 
is written in their law, They , hated 
me without a cause." That has al- 
ways been the condition when the 
truth of God has been assailed. 
When men have tried to destroy 
the work that He has planted it has 
been without a cause in justice or 
right. We ought to thank God ev- 
ery day that in our own hearts we 
know, if we are living in the light, 
that this hatred and evil speaking 
against us is without a just cause. 
Thank God, truth will always live 



and never can be destroyed. We 
ought to be grateful, my brethren 
and sisters, that this is the case, and 
that we have been drawn into this 
work, which is in very deed the 
Gospel of the Son of God, the pow- 
er of salvation to every soul who> 
will receive it. 

This is my testimony, and I know 
that I speak the truth and lie not. 
God bless you, my brethren and sis- 
ters, in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 

ELDER CHARLES H. HART. 

My brethren and sisters, this is 
entirely a new experience for me to 
stand before so many people and 
try to feed them the bread of life. 
I have rejoiced with you in the 
spirit and instruction of this con- 
ference. I was particularly thrilled 
by the narrative of President 
Smith, in connection with his visit 
to Carthage jail. Did you, my 
brethren and sisters, ever visit for 
the first time, or after the lapse of 
many years, a spot where some 
dearly beloved relative of yours 
was buried? If you have, you can 
realize how sacred and hallowed 
those memories are which come to 
a person in standing, after a long 
absence, or for the first time, upon 
such ground. And so with Presi- 
dent Smith in standing, after an 
interval of more than fifty years, 
upon the spot where his beloved 
uncle and father shed their blood 
as a testimony to the divinity of 
this work. 

It occurred to me, in connection 
with the account of the condition 
of some of our young people in the 
City of Berlin, that something of 
the same condition exists here at 
home. How many young profes-

sional brethren are there who feel 
that their labors are such during 
the week that when the Sabbath day 
comes they want to rest ? They rea- 
son that, being engaged in intellec- 
tual pursuits during the week, they 
need rest on the Sabbath day. I 
labored myself under a similar de- 
lusion for several years ; but I dis- 
covered afterwards that a person 
can truly rest upon the Sabbath day 
and still participate in religious 
work ; that it is a change and actual 
rest to be engaged in the service of 
our Master upon the Sabbath day. 

We have had comprehensive dis- 
courses upon the principles of the 
Gospel during this conference. 
Brother Hyrum M. Smith referred 
to the great Decalogue, which has 
been called "The Autograph of the 
Eternal." Do we realize that the 
Ten Commandments stand at the 
very basis of the criminal code of 
all civilized nations? 

In connection with the remarks 
of Brother Nibley this morning, my 
mind recalled an article written in 
The North American Review, for 
August, by the Rev. Philip S. Mox- 
om, his subject was "The Trial of 
Christianity." He lays down the 
proposition that the supreme test 
of any religion, or of any religious 
system, is its ability to produce good 
men and good women, and a wise 
and beneficent social order. Tersely 
expressed by our Savior, "By their 
fruits ye shall know them." This 
is the test by which we as Latter- 
day Saints will be judged. This is 
the test by which we are willing to 
be judged. It is true that the Gos- 
pel is not doing as much for all of 
us as it could do, or as it is calcu- 
lated to do if we would put our- 
selves in a position to receive its 



blessings. That was the class re- 
ferred to by Brother Richards this 
morning, who are neglectful of 
their duties, and who are not plac- 
ing themselves in a position to re- 
ceive blessings. 

I see growing up in these valleys 
of the mountains a superior class of 
young neople. Preston W. Search, 
an educator of some interstate repu- 
tation, in a work of his called "The 
Ideal School" goes out of his way 
to say this : "It sems to me I never 
saw a finer lot of school children, 
than in Salt Lake City." We have 
young men and young women 
growing up who are willing to go 
out into the sagebrush regions and 
redeem the country, and raise a 
family in pioneer life; and I have 
all respect and esteem for the in- 
tegrity of ) r oung men and young 
women who are able to do that; 
they are altogether more worthy of 
praise than the young women who 
can preside with grace at a pink 
tea, or fondle a lap dog as she rides 
in an automobile. There is a 
worthy class of citizenship growing 
up in this mountain country. I am 
proud of the young people of Zion. 

I am proud to be associated with 
these my brethren. I know that 
they are true men, true citizens; 
and those who think to the contrary 
are not acquainted with their lives 
and motives. The time for dismis- 
sal is past, and I realize that I am 
trespassing now. I pray that the 
blessings of the Lord may be with 
us, that we may each be able to re- 
ceive in our lives all the blessings 
that the Priesthood and the princi- 
ples of the Gospel are designed to 
confer upon us. I ask this in the 
name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 



PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 



PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 

(closing remarks.) 

The time will not permit further 
delay; but I would like to say just 
a word. You have listened to the 
Presidency and to each member of 
the Council of the Apostles, and to 
nearly all of the Seven Presidents 
of Seventies ; and we regret exceed- 
ingly that we do not have more 
time, that you might hear others. I 
need not ask you, after hearing 
those who have spoken during this 
conference, if you are satisfied that 
these men who have borne testi- 
mony and who have exhorted and 
admonished you, are in possession 
of the spirit of their calling. We 
leave this to your judgment and 
the inspiration you have received 
during the sessions of this seventy- 
seventh semi-annual conference of 
the Church of Jesus Christ of Lat- 
ter-day Saints. I have been strong- 
ly impressed, in listening to all that 
my brethren have said, that the 
Lord, who chose them, made no 
mistake. They possess the spirit of 
their offices. The testimony of 
Jesus is in their hearts. They have 
borne record of that spirit to you, 
and they stand before you as ap- 
proved ministers of the Gospel of 
the Son of God, and as true wit- 
nesses of Him to all the world. 
From the depths of my heart I 
bless these my brethren who bear 
this Priesthood, and who enjoy to 
this extent the power and spirit of 
their high and glorious callings. 
The Lord accepts them, and He will 
bless them ; and the spirit and pow- 
er of their calling will continue with 
them so long as they live and main- 
tain the integrity that they exhibit 
before the people this moment. The 
people of Zion may rejoice in their 



instructions and ministrations 
among them; for they will minis- 
ter in righteousness, and the Lord 
will accept their labors, and the peo- 
ple who will not — it will be the 
worse for them. 

The Lord bless Zion. May peace 
abide with you, my brethren and 
my sisters. God bless you in ev- 
ery capacity in which you are call- 
ed to act in life, and be with you 
bv the presence and power of His 
Spirit, guide you into all truth, put 
into your hearts the spirit of prayer 
and true devotion, and that faith 
which cannot be moved. God lives, 
and Jesus is the Christ, the Savior 
of the world. Joseph Smith is a 
Prophet of God — living, not dead; 
for his name will never perish. The 
angel that visited him and declared 
God's message unto him, told him 
that his name should be held for 
good and for evil throughout the 
world. This prediction was made 
in the days of his youth, before the 
Church was organized, and before 
there was any prospect of that which 
has since been accomplished. The 
declaration was made, notwith- 
standing it then seemed an abso- 
lute impossibility; but from the 
day it was spoken until this mo- 
ment, and from now on until the 
winding-up scene, the name of Jos- 
eph Smith, the Prophet of the nine- 
teenth century, has been, is being 
and will be heralded abroad to the 
nations of the earth, and will be 
held in honor or contempt by the 
people of the world. But the honor 
in which it is now held by a few 
will by and by be so increased that 
his name shall be held in reverence 
and honor among the children of 
men as universally as the name of 
the Son of God is held today; for 
he did and is doing the work of 
the Master. He laid the founda-

tions in this dispensation for the 
restoration of the principles that 
were taught by the Son of God, who 
for these principles lived, and 
taught, and died, and rose from 
the dead. Therefore I say, as the 
name of the Son of God shall be 
held in reverence and honor, and 
in the faith and love of men, so 
will the name of Joseph Smith 
eventually be held among the chil- 
dren of men, gaining prestige, in- 
creasing in honor, and command- 
ing respect, and reverence until the 
world shall say that he was a ser- 
vant and Prophet of God. The 
Lord God Omnipotent reigneth. 
Peace on earth, goodwill to man, 
is the proclamation that Joseph the 
Prophet made, and that is the same 
as his Master, the Lord Jesus 
Christ, made to the world. That is 
the mission we are trying to fulfill, 
and the proclamat'on we are seek- 
ing to make to the world today. It 
is the mission that these young 
men have been chosen to proclaim, 
and be witnesses of to the nations 
of the earth. It is their duty to see 
to it that this proclamation and this 



Gospel of peace and goodwill shall 
be sent to every nation, and kin- 
dred, and tongue, and people un- 
der the whole heavens. God bless 
Israel, is my earnest prayer in the 
name of Jesus. Amen. 

The choir sang, "There's a sound 
from the vale." 

Benediction was pronounced by 
President John R. Winder, and 
conference was adjourned for six 
months. 



Prof. Evan Stephens conducted 
the singing of the choir and congre- 
gation at all the conference meet- 
ings in the Tabernacle, and Prof. 
John J. McClellan played the ac- 
companiments and voluntaries on 
the great organ. 

The stenographic reports of the 
discourses were taken by Elders 
Arthur Winter, Franklin W. Ot- 
terstrom and Frederick E. Barker.

Christ of Latter-day Saints con- 
vened in the Tabernacle, Salt Lake 
City, at 10 a. m. on Sunday, October 
3, 1909, President Joseph F. Smith 
presiding.

There were present of the First

President Joseph F. Smith called 
the assembly to order, and an- 
nounced that, if necessary, overflow 
meetings will be held this afternoon 
in the Assembly Hall, to be presid- 
ed over by Elder Hyrum M. Smith, 
and outdoors, in the vicinity of the 
Bureau of Information building, 
under direction of Elder Benjamin 
Goddard. The brethren and sisters 
who can furnish lodgings to visitors 
were invited to give their residence 
addresses to the entertainment com- 
mittee. 

The conference services were 
commenced by the choir and con- 
gregation singing the hymn : 

Now let us rejoice in the day of salva- 
tion; 
No longer as strangers on earth need 
we roam, 
Good tidinsrs are sounding to us and 
each nation, 
And shortly the hour of redemption 
will come. 

The opening prayer was offered 
by Elder Seymour B. Young. 
The choir sang the hymn : 

An angel from on high, 

The long, long silence broke; 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Descending from the sky, 

These gracious words he spoke: 
Lo! in Cumorah's lonely hill 
A sacred record lies concealed. 

PEESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 

OPENING ADDRESS. 

That God has spoken is an irrefutable 
truth. — Parents censurable for un- 
wise indulgence of children. — Rev- 
erence for sacred things should be 
inculcated. — Men and women should 
marry those of their own faith. — ■ 
Prosperity retarded by neglect to 
foster home manufactures. — Oopor- 
tunities needed for manual training of 
boys and girls. — A knowledge of 
God and Truth gives rest to the 
soul. 

(After a few preliminary re- 
marks, urging the brethren and sis- 
ters occupying seats to close up to- 
gether and make room for as many 
as possible of those standing, the 
president continued) : 

It is always a source of regret to 
me to see our sisters — sometimes 
aged sisters — under the necessity of 
standing at our meetings. I do not 
think that I ever saw the time when 
it would not be far greater pleasure 
to me to occupy a "standing seat" 
if, by so doing, I could give to a 
sister, a mother perhaps, the chance 
to sit down. I suppose the time will 
not come — we do not look for it to 
come, at least — when we shall be 
able to build large enough to accom- 
modate all the Latter-day Saints. 

The feeling that is in my heart, 
at this moment, is that of gratitude, 
of pleasure, and of hearty welcome 
to all the Latter-day Saints who 
have assembled here this morning 
to attend the opening session of 
our eightieth semi-annual confer- 
ence. We welcome you, brethren 
and sisters, with all our hearts, and 
we sincerely pray and hope that the 
blessings of the Spirit of the Lord 



may rest upon those, individually 
and collectively, who have left their 
homes and gathered here for the 
purpose of attending this general 
conference of the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints. We 
thank you, and I know that the 
Lord will bless you, for the inter- 
est you manifest in coming togeth- 
er. We hope that our coming to- 
gether in this capacity, throughout 
this conference, may be attended 
with rich blessings and with abund- 
ant our-pourings of the Spirit of the 
Lord upon all the people; that our 
faith may be strengthened ; that our 
earnest desire to keep the faith may 
be increased in our souls; and that 
an overpowering desire may pre- 
vail, over all other thoughts and 
all other desires, to serve God and 
keep His commandments, that, by 
His blessing and assistance, we may 
be able as parents, as fathers and 
mothers in Israel, to bring up our 
children in the way they should go ; 
instilling into their minds a knowl- 
edge of the truth, a love of the truth 
and for the truth, and an earnest 
desire, also, in their hearts to serve 
God and keep His commandments. 
We wish our children not only 
to believe but to acquire the -knowl- 
edge, which comes through obed- 
ience to the truth, that the Lord 
God Almighty has spoken from the 
heavens in the day in which we live 
and has revealed to man the true 
way of life everlasting. There is 
no mistake about it; this fact is not 
based upon the judgment or opin- 
ion of men; it is based upon the 
truth — truth that cannot be denied 
intelligently. Men may deny truth, 
through a wilful desire to do it, or 
through ignorance on their part, 
and they may reject the truth; but 
no man that lives can say of a truth 
that God has not spoken from the 



PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 



heavens to men in this latter day 
as He spoke to ancient prophets 
and inspired men, and revealed un- 
to them anciently, and also in our 
present time, His mind and will, 
and His law. Men may say they 
do not believe it; but that does not 
make the truth of non-effect. Men 
may express their doubts about it; 
but the truth remains. Men may re- 
ject it; still the foundation of the 
truth is unshaken. Men may array 
themselves against it ; they may fight 
it bitterly, as many have done from 
its incipiency ; but still the truth re- 
mains unshaken and undisturbed — 
the truth that God did speak to His 
servant Joseph Smith, and did re- 
veal Himself unto him ; not only the 
Father, but the Son also. They did 
reveal themselves unto him, and 
they gave him commandments and 
their law, their Gospel and their 
plan of life eternal ; salvation tem- 
poral and salvation spiritual, salva- 
tion for the present and salvation 
throughout the countless ages of 
eternity. This plan contemplated 
not only salvation from sin and 
from the effects of sin here and 
hereafter, but exaltation, glory, 
power and dominion, that will come 
to the children of God through their 
obedience to the laws and princi- 
ples of the gospel, that the Lord 
has truly revealed through the 
Prophet Joseph Smith. 

I want to bear my testimony to 
this, and I would say to this vast 
congregation, that as I believe in 
my own existence, I believe in the 
divinity of this latter-day work; as 
I know, and as I have reason to 
know, that I am here and that I 
live, so I believe and I have reason 
to know that God, my Father, lives, 
that Jesus lives and that Joseph 
Smith was raised up of God to lay 
the foundations of this work. My 



whole hope of life, my all is staked 
upon this proposition, and I accept 
it, with all my soul. Having ac- 
cepted it, I want, first of all — 
which is natural, and for entertain- 
ing which feeling I think you and 
all men will forgive me — first of 
all, I want those that are immedi- 
ately associated with me, those who 
are bound to me by the ties of kin- 
dred love, to know the truth as 
I know it; I want them to feel it 
as I feel it; to love it as I love it. 
And I want to take that course in 
my life that, at last, I can be count- 
ed free from the responsibility of 
any of those associated with me in 
life going astray, falling by the 
way, turning from the light into 
the darkness, denying the truth or 
falling into transgression, or- wan- 
dering from the right path. I have 
a fervent prayer in my soul, an 
earnest desire, that when I shall be 
called to give my last account, to 
the Judge of the quick and the 
dead, I may not be chargeable for 
the misdeeds of my children, for 
their wandering away from the 
truth, or for the falling into trans- 
gression, if they should do so, of 
any of my family. I do not want 
to be charged with it; I want to be 
free from this possibility. Next 
to them, I want my associates in 
life, my friends, my fellow-mem- 
bers in the Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints, to so live that 
they may love God with all their 
hearts — for that is the greatest of 
all the commandments — and that 
they shall love their neighbor as 
they love themselves, as far as it 
i s possible for men, with the help 
of God, to overcome their selfish- 
ness, and extend their love, their 
forgiveness, their interest and their 
charity to their fellowman. I want 
to see the people of God obedient 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



to the Lord, obedient to the Gospel, 
true to the faith, true to their cove- 
nants, true to mankind, true to one 
another and to the gospel of life 
and salvation; and in order that 
they may be true to these things, 
that they will prove it, and show 
forth their faith, their devotion and 
love for the principles of the gos- 
pel, by the manner in which they 
will rear their children and bring 
them up in the faith. 

The Lord has blest me wonder- 
fully. Sometimes, indeed almost 
always, I feel that no man in all the 
world has been blest more than I 
have been. I cannot express the 
gratitude I feel to God my Father, 
the giver of every good and perfect 
gift, for the inestimable and bound- 
less mercies and blessings He has 
vouchsafed to me, His humble ser- 
vant. So far, through my journey 
of life, I have had the joy and sat- 
isfaction of knowing, as far as it 
is possible for me to know, that the 
Lord has put into the hearts of my 
children the love of God and the 
love of truth, as He has put it into 
my heart, and I thank the Lord for 
it with all my soul. I would to the 
Lord that every man, who is a f atti- 
re in Israel, could say as much for 
his children ; and why can't they 
say so much? I want to tell you 
one reason why a few of them, at 
least, cannot do it, and tell the 
truth. It is because they love their 
children with a shallow and unrea- 
sonable love. They indulge them 
to the utmost limit, and they car- 
ry it to such an extent that, if a 
child of theirs should ask them, 
while it was incapable of protect- 
ing itself, for a razor or a deadly 
instrument, figuratively speaking, 
rather than disappoint the child or 
deny its request, they would put 
into its hand an instrument of de- 



struction. That is what they do, 
and that is what they are doing 
when they weakly yield to their 
foolish whims, and you mark my 
word, my brethren and sisters. 
There may not be many, God for- 
bid that there should be many of 
us so unwisely Indulgent, so 
thoughtless and so shallow in our 
affection for our children that we 
dare not check them in a wayward 
course, in wrong-doing and in their 
foolish love for the things of the 
world more than for the things of 
righteousness, for fear of offending 
them. I want to say this : Some 
people have grown to possess such 
unlimited confidence in their chil- 
dren that they do not believe it pos- 
sible for them to be led astray or 
to do wrong. They do not believe 
they could do wrong, because they 
have such confidence in them. The 
result is, they turn them loose, 
morning, noon, and night, to attend 
all kinds of entertainments and 
amusements, often in company with 
those whom they know not and do 
not understand. Some of our chil- 
dren are so innocent that they do 
not suspect evil, and therefore, they 
are off their guard and are trapped 
into evil. I do not like, and it isn't 
pleasant for me, to throw chips, so 
to speak; for I do not know what 
may come to me in the future, 1 
do not know what sorrows may 
await me, in my children or in their 
children. I cannot tell what the fu- 
ture may bring forth ; but I would 
feel, today as though my life had 
been, in part, a failure if, at this 
moment, any one of my children 
had thrown off their allgiance to 
their father or to their mother and 
taken the bits in their own teeth, 
so to speak, to do as they pleased 
in the world without regard to 
their parents. 



PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 



There are things, in connection 
with this subject, that would not, 
perhaps, be proper to speak of here, 
before a large and mixed congrega- 
tion; but I want to sound a note of 
warning to the Latter-day Saints. 
The time has come for them to look 
after their children. Every device 
possible to the understanding and 
ingenuity of cunning men, is being 
used for the purpose of diverting 
our children from the faith of the 
gospel and from the love of the 
truth. Every species of organiza- 
tion is being formed, both in our 
midst and abroad, having for its 
object the express purpose of lead- 
ing astray the children of the Lat- 
ter-day Saints, because they can't 
reach their parents. This is their 
argument : "We cannot convert the 
adult Mormon people, but we may, 
perhaps, convert their children ; we 
may lead away their children; we 
do not hope to lead away the old 
people." They can't do it, except 
it may be, now and then, a man 
or woman who never did know any- 
thing particularly about the gospel. 
These, only, are they who can be 
led away from the truth; and our 
children can be led away from their 
parents and from the faith of the 
Gospel, only when they are in a con- 
dition that they know not the truth 
for themselves, not having had a 
proper example before them to im- 
press it upon their minds. 

Sometimes good hearted people 
are in the habit of joking a good 
deal about sacred things, and there 
is scarcely anything that is held, 
by them, too sacred to speak lightly 
of in some form. They do this in 
the presence of their children, and 
their children take advantage of it; 
and while they go but an inch, so 
to speak, their children go the full 
length. They see that their parents 



do not hold sacred things which 
are sacred; they joke about them 
and speak lightly of them in the 
presence of their children, at the 
very fireside of their own home. 
The children grow up to feel that 
even their parents, when under the 
influence of a jocular spirit, do not 
hold sacred those things that they 
call sacred. The parents joke about 
these things and speak lightly of 
them, and the children take ad- 
vantage of it. 

I may be pardoned, since it is 
pretty well known everywhere, I be- 
lieve, that I speak my mind if I 
speak at all, if I say to you, Mor- 
mon, Jew, and Gentile, believer and 
unbeliever, present in this congre- 
gation, I would rather take one of 
my children to the grave than I 
would see him turn away from this 
gospel. I would rather follow their 
bodies to the cemetery, and see 
them buried in innocence, than I 
would see them corrupted by the 
ways of the world. I would rather 
go myself to the grave than to be 
associated with a wife outside of 
the bonds of the new and everlast- 
ing covenant. Now, I hold it just 
-so sacred; but some members of 
the Church do not so regard the 
matter. Some people feel that it 
does not make very much differ- 
ence whether a girl marries a man 
ir. the Church, full of the faith of 
the gospel, or an unbeliever.- Some 
of our young people have married 
outside the Church ; but very few of 
those who have done it have failed 
to come to grief. I would like to 
see Latter-day Saint women marry 
Latter-day Saint men, and Latter- 
day Saint men marry Latter-day 
Saint women ; and let Methodists 
marry Methodists, Catholics marry 
Catholics, and Presbyterians marry 
Presbyterians, and so on to the lim- 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



it. Let them keep within the pale 
of their own faith and church, and 
marry and intermarry there, and 
let the Latter-day Saints do the 
same thing in their Church ; then 
we will see who comes out best in 
the end. This is the way I feel 
about it. There is nothing that I 
can think of, in a religious way, 
that would grieve me more intense- 
ly that to see one of my boys marry 
an unbelieving girl, or one of my 
girls marry an unbelieving man. 
While I live, and they will listen to 
my voice, you can depend upon it 
none of them will ever do it, and 
I would to God that every father 
in Israel saw it just as I do, and 
would carry it out just as I intend 
to do. Yet, we do not know what 
the future may bring forth. We 
know the past, and the Spirit of 
the Lord may manifest to men, and 
does manifest to us, to some extent, 
what the future will be. We can 
in part judge of things that will 
come to pass by the things we see 
and understand, for we can trace 
the effect or result from the cause. 
When we see that laxity prevails 
in the family circle, when men do 
not pray at home, when they do 
not ask their wives nor their chil- 
dren to pray with them, when they 
treat lightly sacred things, when 
they joke and laugh about that 
which is most sacred, holy and most 
important to the welfare and hap- 
piness of men, when they do this 
before their children we may fore- 
tell what will be the result of it, 
eventually, with those children. 
You may foretell it almost as sure- 
ly as you can tell that which has 
passed. The same causes, if pur- 
sued on the same lines, will produce 
the same effects in the future as in 
the past. We know what the past 
has done, and we may judge from 



the past what the future will bring 
forth. 

Some of our people living else- 
where are in the habit of letting 
their daughters come to this city 
unprotected, to get employment, 
and it would be pitiable indeed, to 
relate the consequences which 
sometimes result from tnat prac- 
tice. 

I did not expect to occupy very 
much time when I rose before you. 
My voice is not in very good trim 
for speaking as I have been suffer- 
ing for a short time with a cold ; 
and I presume I am not doing my- 
self any good, physically, by speak- 
ing as I am doing. 

The brethren who will follow, 
through the conference, will be led 
by the Spirit of the Lord, I trust, 
in advancing and speaking upon 
those principles that will be profit- 
able to the people. We expect them 
to talk about morality, about obed- 
ience to the laws of God and to 
the laws of men. We expect them 
to speak about home industry, for 
if any people in the world should be- 
lieve in the propriety and necessity 
of home industry, it is the Latter- 
day Saints. On the back of that, 
if there is a people anywhere in the 
intermountain region, or anywhere 
else, who have failed more com- 
pletely in maintaining and support- 
ing some kinds of home industry, 
than we have, I do not know them. 
However much we may believe in 
it, we have not patronized it as we 
should; we have neglected it and 
let it go to the wall. President 
Young started up industries, home 
manufactures, and urged this mat- 
ter upon the brethren. Factories 
were started under the administra- 
tion of President Young in this val- 
ley and to the north of us in Weber 
county, and in Provo, Springville, 



PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 



in Washington county — this side of 
St. George, and in Beaver. He 
was earnest about it; he saw the 
necessity for it, but nearly every 
one of those enterprises, which he 
inaugurated, even to the manufac- 
ture of nails, in that early day, has 
gone to the wall. What for? Of 
course, eliminating the manufacture 
of nails, (for a factory was estab- 
lished for that purpose) die indus- 
try of raising cotton, of spining 
cotton, of manufacturing our wool 
products into cloth and into other 
things that are needful, every one 
of these institutions has gone by 
the board; because labor was a lit- 
tle higher here, and cloth could not 
be produced here quite as cheap, 
within a few cents per yard, as the 
shoddy that is produced in the east 
could be made and sent here. We 
preferred the shoddy to the real 
goods, and we bought the shoddy 
and wore it, and let home manu- 
facture go to the wall, and yet we 
believe in home manufacture ! I 
wish we could produce here every- 
thing that is essential to our well- 
being — both for food and raiment 
and everything else, and I hope that 
the spirit of it will come upon us. 
I do not want to boast, but I want 
to tell you that I have the honor of 
wearing part of the last piece of 
home-made goods produced in 
Utah. I look about as well as 
some of you in your shoddy. 
(Laughter). Of course, I may not 
be a judge of my own appearance. 
You can judge of my appearance, 
and I can judge of yours ; but if 
I may judge of my own appear- 
ance and my apparel, I have the 
opinion that my coat and vest look 
just about as well as some that 
you wear, and mine are home- 
made. For the last 40 years I have 
worn home-made goods, and I have 



paid just a little more than I could 
get shoddy for, I would have been 
glad to have done this right along, 
year after year, rather than to see 
this home industry fall to the 
ground for want of patronage. 
Here is Brother Smoot, who has 
been engaged in the manufacture 
of woolen goods ; he can speak 
from the figures, for he is more 
familiar with figures than I am. 

We want to make these valleys 
of the mountains teem with the 
products of our own labor, and 
skill, and intelligence. I believe it 
to be suicidal for us to patronize 
those who are at a distance from 
us, when we should and could go to 
work and organize our labor and 
produce everything at home; we 
might thereby give employment to 
everybody at home, develop the in- 
telligence and the skill of our chil- 
dren, instead of letting them hunt 
after these fancy occupations that 
r.o many young people desire above 
manual labor. The schools of the 
Latter-day Saints and some of the 
state schools are beginning to in- 
troduce manual labor. Some of 
our boys are learning how to make 
tables, chairs, sofas, bookcases, 
bureaus and all that sort of thing 
— all good as far as it goes ; but if 
we want a mason to lay brick, we 
have got to look mostly to some 
man that has come from England 
or Germany or somewhere else to 
lay our brick. Why? Because our 
boys do not like to lay brick. If 
we want a good blacksmith, we 
must hunt up some foreigner who 
has learned the trade in his mother 
country, and who has come here 
with a knowledge of blacksmith- 
ing; we must find such a man be- 
fore we can get blacksmithing done, 
because bovs do not like to be black- 
smiths. They don't like even to be

farmers; they would rather be 
lawyers or doctors than to be farm- 
ers. This is the case with too many 
of our boys, and it is a great mis- 
take. I hope the time will come 
when the children of the Latter- 
day Saints will learn that all labor 
that is necessary for the happiness 
of themselves and of their neigh- 
bors, or of mankind in general, is 
honorable ; and that no man is de- 
grading himself because he can lay 
brick, or carry on carpentry or 
blacksmithing, or any kind of mech- 
anism, no matter what it is, but 
that all these things are honorable, 
and are necessary for the welfare of 
man and for the building up of the 
commonwealth. 

I feel that I should not trespass 
much longer upon your time. The 
Lord bless this vast congregation. 
May peace dwell in your hearts;, 
may you, indeed, find the rest in the 
gospel of Jesus Christ that will re- 
lieve you from the necessity of 
hunting for or longing to obtain 
something more than that which 
you have. The ancient prophets 
speak of "entering into God's rest ;" 
what does it mean? To my mind, 
it means entering into the knowl- 
edge and love of God, having faith 
in His purposes and in His plans to 
such an extent that we know we are 
right, and that we are nor hunting 
for something else ; we are not dis- 
turbed by every wind of doctrine, 
or by the cunning and craftiness of 
men who lay in wait to deceive. We 
know of the doctrine, that it is of 
God, and we do not ask any ques- 
tions of anybody about it; they are 
welcome to their opinions, to their 
ideas and- to their vagaries. The 
man who has reached that degree 
of faith in God that all doubt and 
fear have been cast from him, he 
has entered into "God's rest," and 



he need not fear the vagaries of 
men, nor their cunning and craft- 
iness, by which they seek to deceive 
him and mislead him from the 
truth. I pray that we may all en- 
ter into God's rest — rest from 
doubt, from fear, from apprehen- 
sion of danger, rest from the re- 
ligious turmoil of the world; from 
the cry that is going forth, here 
and there — lo, here is Christ; lo, 
there is Christ; lo, He is in the 
desert, come ye out to meet Him. 
The man who has found God's rest 
will not be disturbed by these vag- 
aries of men, for the Lord has told 
him, and does tell us: "Go not 
out to seek them. Go not out to 
hunt them : for when Christ shall 
come, He will come with the army 
of heaven with Him in the clouds 
of glory, and all eyes shall see 
Him." We do not need to be hunt- 
ing for Christ here, or Christ there, 
or prophets here and prophets 
there. 

There never was a time, perhaps, 
when there were more false proph- 
ets than there are today, when there 
were more visionary men or more 
false Christs than there are today. 
We get letters from them, and com- 
mands and threats from them, and 
admonitions and warnings and rev- 
elations from them, nearly every 
day. Our table is frequented by rev- 
elations from false prophets, from 
cranks and from crazy men — some 
calling themselves Christ, some call- 
ing themselves "deliverers of Israel," 
some calling themselves "the one 
mighty and strong, who is to de- 
liver Israel out of bondage." Some 
sa> , "I am Christ ; come unto me." 
We have these letters — those that 
we have not destroyed — stacked up 
a'tnost by the cord. Some of these 
false prophets, these men to "de- 
liver Israel," and these foolish, un-

wise, unstable creatures, led about 
by every wind of doctrine have ris- 
en right in our own midst. There is 
no one that can get up some foolish 
idea, or start out proposing to or- 
ganize a church of some kind, no 
matter what the inconsistency of his 
claims may be, but what he will 
find some one to follow him, some- 
body as foolish as he is, and who 
knows as little. To the faithful 
Latter-day Saint is given the right 
to know the truth, as God knows 
it ; and no power beneath the celes- 
tial kingdom can lead him astray, 
darken his understanding, becloud 
his mind or dim his faith or his 
knowledge of the principles of the 
gospel of Jesus Christ. It can't be 
done, for the light of God shines 
brighter than the illumination of 
falsehood and error, therefore, 
those who possess the light of 
Christ, the spirit of revelation and 
the knowledge of God, rise above 
all these vagaries in the world ; they 
know of this doctrine, that it is of 
God and not of man. 

The Lord bless you. Peace abide 
with you ; and, oh, may the fathers 
in Israel live as they should live; 
treat their wives as thev should 
treat them; make their homes as 
comfortable as they possibly can ; 
lighten the burdens upon their com- 
panions as much as possible ; set a 
proper example before their chil- 
dren ; teach them to meet with them 
in prayer, morning, and night, and 
whenever they sit down to par- 
take of food, to acknowledge the 
mercy of God in giving them the 
food that they eat and the raiment 
that they wear, and acknowledge 
the hand of God in all things. This 
is our duty, and if we do not do it 
the Lord will be displeased for He 
has said so. He is oniy pleased 
with those who acknowledge His 



hand in all things. Now, God bless 
you, is my prayer, in the name of 
Jesus. Amen. 

The choir sang the anthem, "O 
Beauty of Holiness." 



PRESIDENT JOHN R. WINDER. 

Grateful for the blessings of the Lord. 
— Sixty years' experience in the 
Church. — Joseoh Smith a true 
Prophet of God. — In favor of home 
industries. — Endorsement of Presi- 
dent Smith's teaching. 

I scarcely know how to express 
my gratitude to God, our eternal 
Father, for this privilege that I 
have of once more meeting with 
you, my brethren and sisters, in 
general conference. As I looked 
over this congregation this morn- 
ing, I thought of the time when I 
first heard the Gospel in a far off 
land, from an elder of the Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints. I was convinced of the 
truth when I first heard it, and I 
knew that Joseph Smith was a 
prophet of God. I am thankful to 
say, this morning, that faith has 
grown and increased with me as the 
years have passed along; and every 
day that I live I see new evidences 
of the truth of this work. I testi- 
fy to you, my brethren and sisters, 
that I know that Joseph Smith is 
a prophet of God. I am thankful 
that this testimony has never left 
me since I first heard the Gospel, 
more than sixty years ago. 

I have rejoiced in listening to the 
words of the President, this morn- 
ing, and I fully and heartily in- 
dorse every principle that he has 
spoken of. I hope that we will all 
be so impressed with the truth that 
we will seek to carry out these in- 



10 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



structions in our lives ; that when 
we go home, from this conference, 
we will all put forth our best efforts 
to improve, and live in accordance 
with these principles. I wish to 
say here, this morning, before this 
vast congregation, that I endorse 
with all my heart every sentiment 
expressed, and to the best of my 
humble ability, I will stand by the 
President and put forth my best 
efforts to aid and assist him in car- 
rying out these principles. 

I was delighted to hear him 
speak of home manufactures. For 
many years I was engaged in the 
business, myself, manufacturing 
various articles, and I have regret- 
ted many times to see the negli- 
gence and carelessness among our 
people in relation to this principle. 
I am proud to say, my brethren and 
sisters, without boasting at all, that 
I have the honor and the pleasure 
of wearing a coat, this morning, 
made from the same piece of cloth 
that the President's coat was made 
from, (laughter), and I leave you 
to judge as to how I look. 

You know pretty well my age 
and how the Lord has blest and 
preserved me until the present time. 
I am almost eight-eight years of 
age; consequently, you do not ex- 
pect that I am going to stand here 
and preach to you. I merely wish, 
this morning, to bear my testimony 
to the truth, and to tell you, from 
the bottom of my heart, that I pro- 
pose to stand by the President and 
aid and assist him in every way that 
I can, and to carry out the princi- 
ples of the Gospel. 

May the Lord bless you all and 
help us to be true and faithful to 
our covenants that we make in the 
house of the Lord, and everywhere 
else, is my prayer, in the name of 
Jesus. Amen. 



PRESIDENT ANTHON H. LUND. 

Children are a blessing, and a respon- 
sibility. — Every available agency for 
children's betterment should be util- 
ized. — Important results from Bu- 
reau of Information. — Splendid 
record made by our missionaries. — 
"Truth will prevail;" the Church 
can not be destroyed. 

I feel very humble in presenting 
myself before this large congrega- 
tion after you have heard the splen- 
did instructions and the strong test- 
imonies borne of the truth. I know 
that you, with me, feel happy in the 
knowledge that we are not in doubt, 
but have a testimony of the truth. 
The Lord has given us an assur- 
ance that He has established this 
work, and that it points out the 
way which leads to eternal life. I 
feel very thankful for this testi- 
mony. 

The subjects that have been treat- 
ed upon are very timely. Our chil- 
dren are our most precious posses- 
sion. The Psalmist says : "Chil- 
dren are an heritage of the Lord, 
and the fruit of the womb is his 
reward. As arrows in the hand 
of a mighty man, so are the chil- 
dren of youth. Happy is the man 
who hath his quiver full of them." 
Such was the way that that inspired 
man looked upon children. Do we 
look upon them in the same way? 
Of all the people upon the earth 
we ought to feel blest in the pos- 
session of children. We should re- 
gard it as a sacred duty to train 
them aright while they are young, 
for we are assured that if children 
are trained in the way they should 
go, when they grow old they will 
not depart therefrom. This duty, 
then, rests upon all the Latter-day 
Saints, and it is not a duty 
alone — we should look upon it as 



PRESIDENT ANTHON H. LUND. 



11 



a privilege that God has given us 
to train their young minds, that 
they may grow up and be an hon- 
or to us and become useful mem- 
bers of the Church and Kingdom 
of God. Good children are among 
the greatest blessings ; but we must 
remember that every blessing that 
God bestows upon us brings also 
responsibility, and the responsibil- 
ity of raising our children aright, 
of guarding them against evil in- 
fluences, is a great one. With the 
growing wealth in our community, 
we find als'o the growth of evil in- 
fluences around us. There is much 
to draw our children away from 
the right path. Hence, Latter-day 
Saints we must be on our guard. 
Do not let us neglect our children. 
Let us encourage them in their at- 
tendance at the sessions of the dif- 
ferent institutions in our midst. Let 
the little ones go to the Primaries. 
I will say here that our sisters who 
take such an interest in attending 
the Primaries will be blest of the 
Lord, and we feel to bless them; 
likewise the workers in the Relig- 
ion Classes. We want our chil- 
dren to learn practical religion, and 
in these classes is where our breth- 
ren and sisters are training them in 
this direction. We have institutions 
in our midst that are hardly known, 
but which are doing a great work 
in protecting our children from the 
evil that surrounds them. I refer to 
the Betterment Committees, com- 
posed of men who have been ap- 
pointed in the different wards to 
look after the children. They have 
saved many a one from going 
astray. I do not believe that the 
parents are really as much in har- 
mony with them as they ought to 
be. As the President said, we have 
such unbounded confidence in our 
children that we do not think they 



could do anything wrong; and if 
one of our brethren should warn 
us that, perhaps, a boy or a girl of 
ours is in bad company, some of us 
are ready to repudiate such a 
charge ; and the one who speaks 
to us, and who does it out of the 
goodness of his heart, we look up- 
on almost as an enemy. We ought 
not to do this. These men are try- 
ing their best to work for the good 
of our young people. I would say, 
brethren and sisters, let us all be 
awake, let us all be on the watch- 
tower ; because if the adversary 
ever sought to destroy us and our 
children, he is at the present time ; 
and what a sorrow it must be to 
the hearts of parents to see their 
children leave the faith or go astray. 
By taking hold of this matter in 
time, and by devoting more time 
to our children, much of this could 
be averted. 

The Bureau of Information, here 
upon this block, is doing an impor- 
tant missionary work. Hundreds 
of thousands of people come here, 
and when they see what tne Latter- 
day Saints have accomplished they 
want to know something concern- 
ing this peculiar people — what are 
their motives? and what are they 
doing? Our brethren and sisters 
who labor so unselfishly here, from 
day to day, are doing a splendid 
work in enlightening men and wom- 
en concerning us and our religion. 
Our missionaries abroad are feel- 
ing the result of this work. They 
go into the houses of strangers, and 
commence to talk to them about the 
Gospel, and often they tell the el- 
ders that they have been in Salt 
Lake, and add : "We have been 
treated kindly by your people ; can 
we do anything for you ?" Many 
missionaries have been told, "Come 
and stay with us ; make our homes 



12 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



your homes, while you are laboring 
in this district." This has been 
brought about by these people 
learning the truth concerning us, 
while in our midst ; and so I say, 
Blessed be our workers on the 
block here, who labor in the ser- 
vice of the Bureau of Information. 
They are simply telling the truth to 
those who come here ; and the trav- 
elers who visit us, feel that our peo- 
ple are telling what they feel and 
know, themselves, to be true in re- 
gard to their religion. We do not 
know how much good a word may 
do. It may open up the way for 
missionary work in districts of our 
country where we have not before 
been able to gain access. It may 
likewise open the way into foreign 
lands, for foreigners come here al- 
so. When I was at Stockholm this 
summer, I met one of our mission- 
aries. This young man was once 
traveling to Denver. On the train 
he met with, a gentleman who had 
visited Salt Lake, and when he 
found out that the young man was 
a Mormon, he wanted to learn all 
he could about our people. When 
he left he gave his address and 
wanted the young man to corres- 
pond with him. The young man 
was called to go on a mission to 
Germany. He corresponded with 
this man, and found out that he was 
a baron from Finland, and before 
the missionary went hcne, this 
man invited him to take a sail with 
him in his yacht, around Scandi- 
navia ; but the brother did not have 
time to do this. I mention this to 
show you what influence a few 
words had on a man, even of such 
standing. He loved the young man, 
and when he bade him farewell, he 
was moved to tears. "Now," said 
he, "send missionaries over to our 
country, and they will be protect- 



ed there." We have tried to send 
missionaries to Finland, bat on ac- 
count of the strict rule of Russia, 
our elders have not been able to 
stay there long at a time. How- 
ever, we have had excel 1 ent men 
and women join the Church there, 
who have come up here to live with 
us. This man was moved by what 
he had heard. He thought there 
was freedom enough in Finland for 
men and women to worship God 
according to the dictates of their 
conscience, but he did not know 
how much the Elders had been per- 
secuted there. 

I want to say to our brethren 
and sisters, that during my visit to 
the different missions of Europe, 
this summer, I have rejoiced in see- 
ing our missionaries, and the work 
they are doing. They are rilled with 
holy zeal for the spread of the 
truth. They are men of whom you 
can be proud, men that are gain- 
ing the love and esteem of all good 
men with whom they come in con- 
tact. As the people of the world 
see their pure lives and upright 
conduct, their love for men and 
their unselfishness in devoting 
themselves, their time and means, 
to convert souls unto Christ, they 
realize that our missionaiies could 
not do this, except they were sin- 
cere and had a firm conviction of 
the truth of the Gospel they pro- 
claim. 

The work is progressing, and I 
hope the time will soon come when 
those countries where there is no 
freedom to worship God, as men 
feel to do, may be given such lib- 
erty. I am astonished that an en- 
lightened nation like Germany 
should still banish men who have 
done no wrong, who have only tried 
to show others the way that they 
know for themselves leads to God. 



PRESIDENT FRANCIS M. LYMAN.

Not many days ago, a young man 
studying in Berlin — not a mission- 
ary — went into our meeting. He 
was a splendid singer, and sung 
the songs of Zion to encourage his 
brethren and sisters; and for this 
offense he was banished. I think 
that when this is put in the right 
light before the government, this 
policy may be changed, for I can- 
not believe that judges and men of 
understanding can look upon it as 
a just thing. However, persecution 
has never stopped the work of the 
Lord. Banishment, arrests and im- 
prisonment will not stop our el- 
ders from working among the peo- 
ple. 

This work has been established 
by our heavenly Father, and no 
opposition can stop it. When there 
were only six or ten members in 
the Church, it might have been 
thought that the adversary could 
have stopped it, but not even then. 
It has grown. The influence of 
the Gospel, as brought forth by the 
Prophet Joseph Smith, is making 
its way and is being felt through- 
out all nations ; the truths revealed 
through him will yet be accepted 
by the world. Many there are to- 
day who believe in them, though 
they know not the source whence 
they came. Truth will prevail, and 
we look forward to the time when 
it shall cover the whole earth, and 
make men free in Christ. Then 
Christ will come and reign upon the 
earth ; bring peace unto men ; bind 
the influences of evil, and introduce 
a reign of peace. I feel thankful 
that this faith and hope has been 
given me, and I know you have it 
also. May the Lord bless the Lat- 
ter-day Saints ; bless this work, that 
it may prosper ; bless His servants 
with the spirit of their calling, that 
what they do may further the in- 



terests of the Church of Christ, I 
ask it, in the name of Jesus, Amen. 

The choir sang the anthem, "The 
Guiding Star." 

Benediction was pronounced by 
Elder Andrew Kimball. 

Conference adjourned until 2 



AFTERNOON SESSION. 

Conference was resumed at 2 p. 
m., in the Tabernacle. 

President Joseph F. Smith called 
the congregation to order, and an- 
nounced the convening of overflow 
meetings at this hour, in the Assem- 
bly Hall, and outdoors near the 
Bureau of Information building. 

The choir sang the anthem, "Ho- 
sannah !" ( Stephens. ) 

Prayer was offered by Elder Wil- 
liam H. Smart. 

The choir sang the anthem, "Gos- 
pel Restoration." 



PRESIDENT FRANCIS M. LYMAN 

Mormonism the work of God. — Our 
splendid Church organizations. — 
General improvement 'among the 
Saints. — Advice to parents. — The sa- 
credness of marriage. — Reward of 
a faithful and well-spent life. — Con- 
cerning children being kept em- 
ployed. — Home industries. — The de- 
velopment of the State's resources. 

This is a very interesting occa- 
sion for the Latter-day Saints. We 
meet together twice a year, in gen- 
eral conference, to transact the gen- 
eral business of the Church and to 
receive such instructions as the 
Lord may have for our profit and 
learning. All the stakes and many 



14 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



of the missions of the United States 
are represented in this great as- 
sembly. 

The Lord has established this 
work ; He has maintained it, and ' 
will do, I have no doubt, to the end. 
We have embraced the Gospel in 
our faith and in our works. Paul 
declared, anciently, that he was "not 
ashamed of the Gospel of Christ, 
for it is the power of God unto sal- 
vation, to all those who believe." 
No doubt, he meant, that it is the 
power of God unto salvat'on to all 
those who believe and obey it. The 
Latter-day Saints have been occu- 
pied with the Gospel for a great 
many years, and the results are 
seen in the great number of stakes 
that are established, the great num- 
ber of wards, and the very perfect 
organizations that now exist in Zi- 
on. A great work is being accom- 
plished in the world. Quite a little 
army of elders, two thousand of 
them, are abroad preaching the 
Gospel, and other elders are at 
home preaching the Gospel — in that 
eloquent discourse of example, at 
least. I believe that is the case with 
a very large majority, of all those 
who have received the priesthood — 
they are preaching by example. 

Under the direction of the Presi- 
dency of the Church, the Council 
of the Twelve and the First Coun- 
cil of Seventies are constantly em- 
ployed in preaching and ir. writing, 
in organizing and re-organizing, 
setting in order and keeping in or- 
der this great army of people, in 
their stakes, in their wards, in their 
quorums, and in all their associa- 
tions; and a great work is being 
accomplished. Very much atten- 
tion is being given to the rising 
generation in the splendid Sunday 
School system, so thoroughly es- 
tablished and developed, the Mutual 



Improvement Associations of young 
men and young women, the Pri- 
mary Associations, and the Relig- 
ion Class organizations, besides all 
the quorums of the priesthood ; in- 
deed all Israel seems to be thor- 
oughly occupied. 

I presume that sometimes we feel 
we are taxed in our attention to 
spiritual matters, church matters, 
more than we are able to meet ; but 
the Lord will bring forth the fruit. 
We plant, we labor, we exhort and 
do our duty, bearing the priesthood ; 
but it is the Lord that gives the re- 
sult, that causes the convictions and 
brings about the conversions and 
the reformations. He finds the 
hearts of the people and controls 
them and endows them with faith, 
with the spirit of repentance and 
reformation. As a result of our ob- 
servation, which is quite general — 
for we keep fairly in close touch 
with the missions throughout the 
world, with all the stakes in Zion, 
with all the wards, with all the as- 
sociations and organizations that 
pertain to this splendidly organized 
Church — I feel to say a word in 
favor of our efforts. We are not 
perfect, but I believe that we are 
doing better, that we are get- 
ting more thoroughly acquainted 
with doctrines and principles ; I be- 
lieve that we are making improve- 
ment and that the Gospel of re- 
demption and of salvation and of 
restoration is producing fruit that 
can be measured in the conditions 
of the people, can be measured in 
the conditions of individuals. I be- 
lieve that every member of this 
Church can readily discover and de- 
termine just how far. he is redeemed 
and reformed, and just how far 
he has become established upon a 
good, safe foundation of faith, of 
repentance, and of good works. 



PRESIDENT FRANCIS M. LYMAN. 



15 



I believe it is highly necessary 
for every man to take stock of him- 
self, every family, every quorum, 
every ward and every stake ; to take 
stock of ourselves and determine 
just how far the Gospel has pro- 
duced fruit in us, how far we are 
redeemed, how much reformation 
we have accomplished, while con- 
nected with this Church. Thus we 
can demonstrate or determine the 
power that is connected with the 
Gospel, the measure of the power 
of God; for, if we have wrought 
righteousness, if we are redeemed, 
so that we do not want to do wrong 
any more, so that we do not want' 
to be wicked, that we do not want 
to indulge in falsehood, intemper- 
ance, in profanity, or in any other 
measure of wickedness ; if we are in 
that condition, we will know the 
virtue and the power of this Gos- 
pel. Let each man take stock of 
himself, ask himself the question, 
"What reformation have I made?" 
What reformation have we made? 
How well and thoroughly are we 
established now in the principles of 
the Gospel of the Lord Jesus, and 
how well has the power of God been 
demonstrated in us individually. 

As the leading and presiding 
councils in the Church, it falls to 
our lot to visit all the departments 
of the Church, to give attention 
thereto, as directed by the Presi- 
dency of the Church; so that we 
go to your homes, we go to your 
wards, to your stakes, and we vis- 
it with the priesthood. We exam- 
ine , and weigh the brethren, look 
them over. We have occasion to 
do-this whenever it is necessary to 
regulate and set in order any or- 
ganization within the Church. That 
keeps us fairly well occupied, for 
changes are occurring constantly, 
and we find it necessary to examine 



the pieces of material, the timber 
at our disposal, in organizing stakes 
and wards and quorums and the 
like, in all the details of Church 
work. I want to say that we have 
discovered this — starting with the 
brethren who are charged with car- 
ing for stakes and wards, quorums 
and missions, — that quite generally, 
almost universally, these presiding 
men, and the presiding brethren 
and sisters in all the associations 
and organizations of the Church, 
are found to be doing good work, 
and they are fairly faithful and ex- 
emplary. We hardly hope to be 
perfect just yet; but we find these 
leading and presiding brethren and 
sisters, in their several positions, 
making very great improvement. 
That is our testimony; and that 
good condition is spreading and in- 
creasing, though evils exist and no 
doubt will do to the end, for some 
may never fully repent and reform, 
I fear. But, generally, it will be 
found that the Latter-day Saints 
are becoming more faithful and bet- 
ter established in their faith — more 
reliable, more spiritually-minded, 
giving greater attention to 'their 
ministry, and having matters of the 
Church better in hand than hereto- 
fore. We find that a very large 
percentage of all the Lattelr-day 
Saints are prayerful. They remem- 
ber the Lord ; a large percentage 
of them remember Him in their fast- 
ings, every month, and in their of- 
ferings for the poor. The law of 
tithing is fairly well and generally 
observed. The Sabbath day is be- 
ing better observed. Yet, along all 
these lines there is opportunity for 
improvement. 

Our children have been taken 
care of, and are being taken care of, 
by the associations, I believe, better 
than by their parents. Hence I 



16 



GENERAL CONFERENCE, 



thought the injunction of the Pres- 
ident this morning — that we should 
give attention to our children — was 
very timely. I believe the Presi- 
dent understands that the associa- 
tions are doing their duty well ; but 
it is your duty and my duty, our 
duty as fathers and mothers, to take 
greater pains with our children, to 
work with them more earnestly and 
consistently and wisely, to seek to 
have influence and weight with 
them; not only to teach them by 
word of mouth, but by our example. 
We should see to it that our ex- 
ample, our conversation, shall be 
proper, and that their faith shall 
never be weakened by our example, 
nor by our precepts, but that every- 
thing that we do as parents shall 
tend to strengthen faith in the 
hearts of our children. For we 
have an army of them, an immense 
army of children in this Church, 
thank the Lord; they are very nu- 
merous ; they are bright and intel- 
ligent; they are very choice spirits, 
and are worthy of our care. They 
are entitled to the care of elders, 
as well as their mothers, and of 
seventies and high-priests, for every 
child properly, and well-born in 
this Church is entitled to be the 
child of a man bearing the Mel- 
chisedek Priesthood. 

The suggestion upon marriage 
should receive our consideration. 
This principle cannot be too thor- 
oughly taught in our families at 
home, not leaving these instruc- 
tions for public consideration alto- 
gether, or to be given in public by 
our presiding officers. Every father 
should feel and realize the impor- 
tance of the proper marriage of his 
son, the proper marriage of his 
daughter, and the proper legiti- 
macy, in the eyes of the Lord, for 
our grandchildren and great-grand- 



children, so that our posterity shall 
never have occasion to look us in 
the face and say that their progen- 
itors were indifferent and careless. 
They are entitled to be born heirs 
of God, legitimate in the eyes of 
the Lord, and what a serious thing 
it would be and will be for us, my 
brethren and sisters, if we neglect 
to have the suitable and proper 
kind of marriage that is required 
in this Church : marriage for eter- 
nity, legal marriage in the eyes of 
the Lord, so that our children and 
our children's children may in- 
herit this blessing, that they may 
'be heirs of the Lord and joint 
heirs with Jesus Christ. If we neg- 
lect our duty in this regard, what 
a serious thing it will be for our 
posterity. They are not responsible 
for their birth ; but they will be 
responsible for the birth of their 
own posterity. 

I would like to suggest to the 
Latter-day Saints that it is a re- 
proach to parents who do not insure 
to their children legitimacy in the 
eyes of the Lord. Marriages for 
time are all right and proper in the 
world, and are satisfactory to the 
world, I suppose, as a rule; that is 
the only form they have ; but it is 
not sufficient for Latter-day Saints. 
For that reason, I take it, our Pres- 
ident enjoins upon us the impor- 
tance of Latter-day Saints marry- 
ing with Latter-day Saints and not 
marrying with those who are not of 
our faith. This does not mean that 
the other children .of God are not 
just as choice as we are, if they will 
open their hearts to receive the 
truth, and are willing to be taught 
and receive faith, and do the works 
that are required of us ; but as long 
as they remain careless and indiffer- 
ent and are satisfied with forms of 
religion, without the power there- 



PRESIDENT FRANCIS M. LYMAN.

of, the power of God, then they de- 
prive themselves of many blessings. 
There is but one true religion. That 
Paul referred to; it is the religion 
that he came to be partial to. At 
first he had a religion that was not 
the true religion of the Lord Jesus 
Christ ; but when he had corrected 
himself, when he had embraced the 
truth and had undertaken to serve 
the Lord Jesus Christ and to be His 
follower, he discovered that the re- 
ligion of the Pharisees was not suf- 
ficient for salvation. He had been 
reared in the strictest form of the 
religion of the Pharisees. He was 
a conscientious and an honest man. 
He felt as though he was doing his 
duty when he was persecuting the 
Saints, and he rejoiced at the ston- 
ing of Stephen, at the gate of Je- 
rusalem; but he found out later 
that he was persecuting the Lord 
Jesus Christ. He discovered that 
fact, because the Lord revealed it to 
him. He repented, he reformed and 
he was baptized for the remission 
of his sins and received the Holy 
Ghost which enlightened his mind 
and prepared him and qualified him 
to make that immortal saying, "I 
am not ashamed of the Gospel of 
Christ, for it is the power of God 
unto salvation." That was a new 
religion for him; he had not had 
that before in all his life. He had 
not been trained in the religion of 
the Lord Jesus Christ ; but when he 
discovered it, and found it out, he 
became enlightened; the Holy 
Ghost inspired his heart and bore 
testimony to him of the Father and 
of the Son, and he discovered that 
the Gospel of the Lord Jesus was 
the power of God unto salvation. 
Now, we can determine this ques- 
tion, every one of us. We do not 
need to go to the bishop to find out, 
or to the president of the Church, 



or the president of the stake ; but 
every member of this Church can 
determine just exactly where he 
stands and what measure of re- 
demption and of restoration he has 
reached, where he is at the present 
time. Have we ceased to steal? 
We do not want to steal any more. 
Latter-day Saints do not want to 
steal. We do not want to lie any 
more, because we have reformed 
and repented. We have ceased to 
deceive., to cheat, to rob, or to do 
anything that is wicked. We have 
stood thus for many years, and ex- 
pect to continue to the end; we 
must be faithful to the end if we 
want the blessing, finally, for it is 
not enough for us to be honest to- 
day and conscientious today and for 
a week or a month ; our contract or 
compact with the Lord is that we 
will serve Him to the end of our 
mortal lives. If we do this, the 
Lord will receive us into His fel- 
lowship and make good His prom- 
ise of forgiveness of our sins. We 
will attain to a remission of our 
sins if we serve Him faithfully to 
the end of our mortal lives. That 
is a very important place, so that 
when we get there, if we have kept 
the commandments, fought a good 
fight, and endured to the end, how 
blessed it will be for us to come in- 
to the presence of God and receive 
the welcome plaudit, "Well done." 
If we have done well, that will 
thrill us from the crown of our head 
to the soles of our feet; we will re- 
joice exceedingly, and there will, 
no doubt, be a great change in us 
when our sins are finally forgiven, 
when they are blotted out and are 
not remembered against us any 
more ; then we will have no cause to 
be ashamed. 

Now, we have discovered that 
this Gospel is having its due weight 



18 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



among the people. When we come 
to examine them, and they are 
looked over by the bishops in the 
wards, or by the presidencies of the 
stakes, as well as these general au- 
thorities that travel among them, I 
believe it is the general opinion and 
understanding among us that the 
Latter-day Saints are improving, 
growing stronger, growing better 
in faith, and we are becoming more 
popular. Stakes are increasing, 
wards are increasing, and we are 
spreading abroad and hav'ng great- 
er influence and accomplishing 
greater good in the earth. The Lord 
is blessing and redeeming His peo- 
ple. We see before us here one of 
the beautiful sights we see twice a 
year. I don't know of any other 
spot on earth, or any other people 
on earth where there is anything 
superior to this, or equal to it. We 
come together as parents. We are 
here today, and we will be togeth- 
er in great numbers again tonight 
in the Sunday School gathering. 
This house will be filled, for every- 
body is invited and everybody is 
expected to come, in the interest 
of the Sunday Schools. This is a 
work that engages much of our at- 
tention at home. 

We have strangers on our bord- 
ers, who need to hear the Gospel; 
and there are many among us who 
should hear the Gospel ; not only 
do the Latter-day Saints gather 
from abroad, but our friends and 
neighbors gather ; they come here 
in great numbers, until they almost 
outnumber us here in Salt Lake 
City. If we could only convert 
them, if they would come and listen 
and embrace the Gospel and help 
us in the building up of the king- 
dom, we would rejoice exceedingly. 
We go to the extremities of the 
earth, to the islands of the sea and 



all over the continents, and expect 
to go to the very ends of the earth 
and preach the gospel to every crea- 
ture. This obligation rests upon us ; 
this responsibility has been placed 
in our hands. 

My testimony, my brethren and 
sisters, is that the Latter-day Saints 
are improving; they are increasing 
in strength, in faith, in power, and 
they desire to be faithful in the 
work of the ministry. I believe 
we feel that way, and that we will 
be successful if we just unite our- 
selves. You can determine the con- 
dition of the Latter-day Saints by 
the spirit they enjoy, for there is 
happiness and peace among us, and 
a foretaste of heaven fills the souls 
of the Latter-day Saints. We have 
no occasion to go on the outside ; 
we have no occasion to go to any 
other religious denomination. They 
certainly ought to enjoy what they 
possess. We are satisfied with what 
we possess, for we have heard ; we 
have seen; we have believed; we 
have repented; we have been bap- 
tized for the remission of our sins, 
by competent authority; and we 
have received the Holy Ghost, for 
it is that Spirit that has borne rec- 
ord to our souls. It is that Spirit 
that so establishes us that the world 
have concluded that they can't do 
very much with the Mormon peo- 
ple, at least the older people. They 
may catch some of the children ; but 
if they do, we will catch some of 
theirs in turn, because we will be 
laboring to convert them while they 
are laboring to convert us. 

This Gospel, with which Paul 
was so pleased, requires us to serve 
the Lord all the time, so that we 
may have joy and happiness in our 
souls, and that we may be prepared 
to live and be prepared to go to our 
reward when mortality closes and 



PRESIDENT FRANCIS M. LYMAN.

we lay down these mortal taber- 
nacles of ours, for we will lay them 
in the dust after a little while — 
just a little while. All the time there 
are changes. Many are being born, 
and many are passing away. We 
mourn, we sorrow for our loved 
ones that go — our wives, our hus- 
bands, our children, our parents ; 
we sorrow for them ; and it is well 
and proper that we should mourn 
for them and shed tears for the loss, 
for it is our loss ; but it is their gain, 
for it is in the march of progress, 
advancement and development. It 
will be all right when our time 
comes, when we have finished our 
work and accomplished what the 
Lord requires of us. If we are pre- 
pared, we need not be afraid to go, 
for it will be one of the most pleas- 
ant sensations that ever comes to 
the soul of man, whenever he de- 
parts, if he can go with a clear 
conscience into the presence of the 
Lord and receive that welcome I 
have mentioned. We will be full 
of joy and happiness, and we will 
enter into a place of rest, of peace, 
of joy, rest from every sorrow. 
What a blessed thing that will be! 
We will never be tired any more. 
We will not get tired, for we will 
be in a condition that we can en- 
dure and enjoy our work: for we 
shall be occupied and employed on 
the other side as we are on this 
side ; we shall have plenty to oc- 
cupy our attention right along. 

Now, in closing, I want to say a 
word in regard to the children. I 
want to give you my thoughts in 
regard to one phase of child labor. 
I want to impress upon my breth- 
ren and sisters here, who have fam- 
ilies, those who are raising families, 
who have children and will have 
children right along: I believe that 
there is nothing more important in 



the handling of children than to see 
that they are occupied, that they are 
employed, that they have something 
to do, that the mind is not left idle 
to study mischief or to do mischief. 
We should see that the little hands 
are suitably occupied ; we should see 
that the little minds are constantly 
engaged. They should not be idle ; 
boys should not be idle ; girls should 
not be idle; they should have em- 
ployment. It should be the effort 
of parents to provide their children 
with occupation. I know of nothing 
that is so degenerating and so dan- 
gerous as idleness, for the brain will 
seek out mischief. Satan is just 
as ready to tempt and to lead astray 
as the Spirit of the Lord is willing 
to lead us in ways of righteousness. 
Try to find employment for your 
little ones ; keep them occupied. I 
do not want little children to do 
men's work ; they should not do 
hard work; but their little hands 
should be occupied, for they can't 
be still a minute while they are 
awake. They cannot sit still, and 
they cannot lie still; if you place 
them upon their backs, they will 
kick and scramble and make a good 
deal of noise, too. They must be 
occupied. The brain is active just 
as well as the body, from the very 
beginning; they must have some- 
thing to do. I believe that is one 
of the secrets of success : that the 
children should be occupied; we 
should make use of them in such 
way that they will be learning to 
be useful in their lives, and not be 
idle and waste their time, 

In regard to home industries : I 
thought I had the last suit myself, 
President. (Laughter). I thought, 
I had the last silk that was pro- 
duced in Utah; and I thought I 
had the last cloth made at Provo; 
but I do not know how many last 



20 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



pieces have been made. (Laughter.) 
But here is the last silk ever made 
in Utah, (displaying a handker- 
chief.) In regard to home-made 
cloth, I have never worn anything, 
since I can remember, but goods 
made at Provo, until Provo stopped 
making the goods; since that time 
I have had to do the best I could, 
and I have been wearing shoddy 
ever since. I believe in sustain- 
ing home industry, the protection of 
everything that can be produced in 
our land. It has been said that, 
with some people, it is not consid- 
ered very fashionable to be farm- 
ers, to cultivate the earth. As sug- 
gested, our boys want something 
easier, something smoother and 
cleaner ; they don't want to get dirt 
on their hands, and the like. The 
cultivation of the earth, agriculture 
and horticulture, will be among the 
most profitable enterprises, and it 
will be found that the land here 
will be very valuable and precious ; 
but it wants to be occupied and sub- 
dued. We want to produce good 
crops upon it, instead of weeds. We 
have been looking over the country 
— not only looking over the people 
and the organizations, but we have 
looked over the fields in the south, 
in the north, as far as we go in the 
north, up into Canada — the finest 
country I ever saw for weeds, ex- 
cept the south. The south is pret- 
ty good, a warm country, and pro- 
duces many weeds. Now, if we 
would only take from the earth all 
that can be brought out in good 
profitable crops, instead of produc- 
ing weeds, we would become pros- 
perous. We should subdivide the 
earth, as much as we can handle, 
making it profitable to us, that it 
be made to grow flowers and fruits 
and. vegetables — everything that is 



necessary for the use and comfort 
of man. The mines, of course, will 
be developed; they will produce, as 
they should do, gold and silver, lead 
and copper, and iron. If I had in- 
fluence with the railroads, I would 
have them put a railroad into the 
iron-fields here, and the gold-fields 
here, and develop industries that 
would employ men by the thou- 
sands. The railroads have done 
wonders in the state of Colorado, as 
well as in Utah and in the north, and 
in all directions. They have done 
wonders, but we want them to do 
more. I guess they will never be 
able to do all we want them to do. 
We want them to help develop the 
resources. The Latter-day Saints 
are industrious, and are increasing 
in numbers. There are many peo- 
ple, not of this faith, in Latter-day 
Saint communities, and we live to- 
gether as friends and neighbors. We 
meet them in business transactions ; 
we have the same reservoirs, the 
same mines, the same interests ; we 
live together, side by side, in the 
same cities and towns ; and we 
ought to live in peace and labor for 
the welfare of the people of our 
state, help each other and not tear 
each other to pieces. 

May the Lord bless you, my breth- 
ren and sisters, in all your wards 
and stakes. May He bless you as 
individuals, in your homes. God 
bless the Latter-day Saints, that 
they may keep the faith, that their 
children may grow up in the faith, 
strong and determined in keeping 
the commandments of the Lord, so 
that they will have life now and life 
forever more, that they may dwell 
in the presence and favor and fel- 
lowship of God, our eternal Father, 
I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ, 
Amen.

PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 

I don't want Brother Lyman to 
think he has the last silk handker- 
chief; (laughter) I have a number 
of them at home, which I intend to 
keep as long as I can. 

There is a very modest lady in 
the congregation, who is clothed in 
home-made silk. The mulberry 
leaves were grown here, and the 
very worms that spun the silk into 
threads, were bred in Utah. I wish 
that more of the good sisters were 
clad in home-made silk. 

A quartette, "The Floweret's 
Sleep," was rendered by Elders Sid- 
doway, Winter, Robinson, and Pe- 
terson." 



ELDER JOHN HENRY SMITH. 

More care needed in the cultivation of 
the soil. — Beautifying of towns and 
villages. — Brethren advised to pur- 
chase land and to make homes in 
the vales of Utah. — Idleness dis- 
countenanced, Industry encouraged. 
— Praise for Utah and her people- 
Parents exhorted to safeguard their 
offspring. — Home Industries recom- 
mended. 

I have enjoyed very much, in- 
deed, the remarks that have been 
made by all of the brethren who 
have spoken to us in our confer- 
ence today. The instructions and 
advice they have given us, on the 
various themes that have been dwelt 
upon, should encourage us in the 
more faithful discharge of the du- 
ties that rest upon us. 

The closing suggestions present- 
ed by President Lyman, in which 
he called our attention to the fact 
that there is a considerable growth 
of weeds throughout the land, is a 
matter upon which 1 believe, as a 



whole, we require something of an 
awakening. It has been my priv- 
ilege, in recent times, to attend 
quite a number of congresses that 
have been held in various sections 
of the country. There was a time, 
in my earlier mingling in these con- 
gresses, when Utah was most con- 
stantly and frequently quoted as an 
example to her sister states and 
territories, in the character of her 
productions, and the results of our 
irrigation system. But, I am sorry 
to say, that in more recent times, we 
are not quoted so frequently, if at 
all, in regard to these matters. 

Many of our neighbors have tak- 
en steps in advance of us, and much 
greater care is being bestowed up- 
on the productions of the soil than 
has been the case with ourselves. I 
believe that an awakening is neces- 
sary concerning the products of our 
farms; that an awakening of great 
moment is necessary in the upbuild- 
ing of our villages and towns, in 
the bestowal of greater care, more 
thought and industry on the beau- 
tifying of them. I am sanguine that 
it is necessary for an upward and 
onward movement to take place 
among the Latter-day Saints, look- 
ing to the accomplishment of this 
matter. I note, in many of the vil- 
lages where it is my privilege to 
go, that there is not enough evi- 
dence of attention and labor and 
taste in the building of the cottage 
homes, in the selection of their pos- 
ition upon the lots, in the improve- 
ment of the sidewalks in front of 
the homes, in the planting of shade 
trees, in regular form. In thou- 
sands of the orchards of this coun- 
try, peach trees and apple trees are 
gradually growing so old and look- 
ing so dead, that the condition of 
the neighborhood is to be regretted. 
I believe it would be a most wise 



22 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



effort upon the part of the presi- 
dency of each stake of Zion, backed 
by their high councils, the bishop's 
of their wards, and the leading el- 
ders of their sections, to look into 
and seek to improve the conditions 
of our villages. In the erection of 
cottage homes, the buildings should 
be put a sufficient distance from the 
sidewalk, so that the ground in 
front can be improved, that flower 
gardens may be made to grow up 
around the homes. If it were pos- 
sible it would be well to secure the 
labors, in each district, of some 
young man who has a taste for 
architecture, in the drawing up of 
small plans, or plans that would 
reach the means of the now marry- 
ing young men and women of our 
communities; that in the laying of 
their home foundations, it would be 
upon a basis that would afford op- 
portunity for culture and improve- 
ment, and would awaken in the 
minds of the young men and women 
of our communities an ambition to 
make the spot that they purpose to 
occupy the most pleasing and satis- 
factory upon which it would be pos- 
sible for them to live. 

I believe there should also be an 
awakening in our own minds in re- 
gard to the securing of lands that 
are within our reach, that are with- 
in the confines of our own states and 
neighborhoods. We need an awak- 
ing that will check the tendency to 
wander afar off, to virtually pass 
around the circle — leaving Salt 
Lake, going to the southland, into 
Mexico ; stopping a short time, pos- 
sibly, in Arizona, in New Mexico, 
in old Mexico, then proceeding into 
Colorado, thence into Wyoming, 
thence into Canada; remaining in 
Canada a few months, or a year or 
so, then making a break for Ore- 
gon, from Oregon into northern 



California ; and eventually dropping 
down, possibly, into southern Cal- 
ifornia ; becoming dissatisfied with 
conditions in that section of the 
country, and wandering back into 
the vales of Utah. As I have trav- 
led in the discharge of my duty, in 
the preaching of the Gospel, I have 
found men who, with their families, 
had been living in almost every 
state and territory of the western 
part of the United States, as well 
as in Canada and Mexico ; dragging 
their families "from pillar to post," 
living almost constantly in wagons. 
Many such have died without a 
home over the heads of their chil- 
dren. 

I recognize that there is some- 
thing essential, in regard to this 
matter, in the development and im- 
provement of this God-given land. 
No choicer locations can be found 
upon the globe than are found be- 
neath the shades of these grand old 
mountains. No finer opportunities 
can be found, in which men can se- 
cure the comforts and blessings of 
life, than can be found within the 
confines of this state — this pioneer 
state of the western lands. It is not 
creditable to us that there should 
have existed so much of this chang- 
ing and moving, this unsettled feel- 
ing that has caused some men to 
move about till they have lived in 
almost every state and territory of 
the western part of this republic. 
Some such have returned to their 
former homes almost naked, and, 
at an advanced time of their lives, 
been compelled, possibly, to go out 
upon the streets and engage in dig- 
ging and toiling, when their frames 
are bent with age. I believe that 
the effort should be made, devot- 
edly and earnestly, and with un- 
yielding courage, to uplift and up- 
build this state, that it may be main-

tained in the vanguard, and merit 
the honor and continued respect of 
our neighbors, who have looked to 
us in the past and recognized our 
worth as colonizers and builders of 
commonwealths. 

The suggestions and views ex- 
pressed in the remarks of President 
Lyman, along the line of giving 
employment to the children, and 
keeping them in touch with an in- 
dustrious and prudent life, should 
be remembered by every father and 
mother. They should carefully 
weigh these matters, and lay their 
plans in accordance therewith. That 
old saying, "An idle brain is the 
devil's workshop," is as true now as 
when it was first uttered. No man 
that is idle can be honest and vir- 
tuous and of use in the community. 
No woman that is an idler can be 
clean and sweet. No boy or girl 
left without employment "can, by 
any manner of means, make a mark 
in life or accomplish good for him- 
self or herself. Wherever they are 
found in idleness, simply employing 
themselves briefly, for a few mo- 
ments, possibly,.each day, putting on 
the clothes they may have, and then 
wandering the streets, they will, in 
a very brief period of time, be found 
with the mark of evil upon their 
faces. Therefore, we should make 
every effort that is possible for us 
to make in safeguarding, training 
and providing suitable employment 
for our children. Every father and 
every mother among us should be 
devoting considerable of his and 
her talents to the establishing of 
something that will keep the hands 
of their children fully engaged. 
How easily and how nicely, nearly 
every home within the confines of 
this state could be made desirable 
by the labor of the boys and girls 
at home — in the making of a flow- 



er-garden, in the cultivation of the 
trees, in the care of the side-walk 
in front of the house, in improving 
the fence, and in working out plans 
that would bring results in the gen- 
eral improvement of the home. The 
idle hours that are spent, upon every 
hand, would make each farm with- 
in the confines of the state of Utah 
a garden spot. 

There are some men whose lives 
of toil are continuous, but there are 
many whose lives are comparatively 
idle, and the result of that idle- 
ness goes far to overturn and de- 
stroy the effects of the industry of 
the prudent and thoughtful ones. 
The honey-bee and the bee-hive 
were taken to designate the char- 
acter of the people who established 
themselves in these -mountains in 
that earlier day. Are the sons and 
the daughters of those honored 
pioneers worthy today of that ances- 
try? Are the boys as inJustrious, 
as prudent, as frugal, as determined, 
and as thorough, as a rule, as their 
fathers were? Are the daughters 
of our communities as fully alive 
to the accomplishment of their life 
mission, legitimately and properly, 
as many or most of their mothers 
were? These are questions that we 
must consider. In no sense of the 
word do I desire to reflect upon the 
honor and integrity, the worth, the 
industry and devotion of the people 
of communities I love, and with 
whom it has been my privilege to 
spend my life ; but when, in my ex- 
periences among men from afar, 
whose voices are heard in commen- 
dation of the grand work of the 
pioneers of this people, I note their 
criticism of conditions today, I re- 
alize that there is need for improve- 
ment among us. Some of these men 
visit our communities, and upon 
leaving they say : "In some localities 



24 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



the canals are filled with weeds ; 
the orchards are old ; dead trees are 
seen ; the fruits are wormy and un- 
fit for use; the farms are without 
legitimate and proper cultivation; 
the evidences of lack of thrift, 
push, and industry are seen upon 
the right hand and upon the left. 
The prestige of the past is waning, 
speaking of your communities." 
Such remarks have been made to 
me by men who have passed 
through some sections of our coun- 
try. Some sections are doing fair- 
ly well in producing fruits. Other 
sections are holding their own in 
producing potatoes ; but there was a 
time when all Utah potatoes com- 
manded the best prices everywhere 
in the land, and were looked upon 
as a luxury. "But now some of the 
neighbors of Utah are taking away 
from us the opportunities that were 
ours, in this field, advantages which 
were gained by those who entered 
in the start, and to which we had 
acquired a right in the estimation 
of many people. 

I have an especial pride in the 
development of this goodly land. I 
recognize the Bee Hive State as the 
best in the world; her sons and 
daughters are among the most in- 
dustrious, the most unflinching and 
determined of men and women in 
the accomplishment of the responsi- 
bilities and duties of life. As a rule, 
their homes are homes of peace, and 
of love and comfort. Around them 
are the evidences of thrift and 
worth, in every detail; whether in 
the garden, or on the farm, or in 
the orchard; whether in the char- 
acter of the stock that they possess, 
in the nature of their buildings, or 
in the care they bestow in the de- 
velopment and improvement of their 
public places, and erection of good 
schoolhouses and good meeting- 



houses. In all these they are ex- 
amples to the boys and girls in their 
respective districts, examples that 
shall lead the youth to active and 
determined purpose in the better- 
ment and improvement of the com- 
munity, and above all in the devel- 
opment of such manhood and wom- 
anhood that, wherever found in the 
world, the Mormon boys and girls 
shall be recognized for their moral 
virtues, their devotion, their faith, 
their determination to aid in the ad- 
vancement and uplifting of man- 
kind. Our young people should be 
so trained and taught that they may 
be free from that condition which 
affects many of our religious friends 
in the world, moving "from pillar 
to post," so far as religious faith is 
concerned. I trust that they will 
not be anxious to change and move 
about constantly, but that they will 
secure some permanent abiding 
place, lay a foundation and build 
upon it in a manner that shall be 
creditable to them in the fullest 
sense of the word. 

My brothers and sisters, the ad- 
monitions that have been given to 
you by the brethren are worthy of 
your serious consideration. Our 
boys and girls are among the 
brightest and best that can be found. 
Their improvement and advance- 
ment is necessary, that not one of 
them may stray from the paths of 
right and of rectitude. We preach 
the Gospel unto them, but too of- 
ten it happens with us that our con- 
fidence in them is greater than it 
should be. Those of you who have 
been students will remember how 
strictly the people of the Latin rac- 
es guard their homes. Their girls 
are never allowed that liberty that 
is found among people of other rac- 
es ; they exercise great thoughtful- 
ness and prudence in this matter.

I am satisfied that the degree of 
liberty, that is gradually increasing 
among us in regard to these mat- 
ters is likely to give us, in due time, 
very great regrets. We should 
wisely guard our children, as far 
as it is possible for us to do so, 
that the proper development of 
those that are entrusted to us may 
not be hampered, but that they may 
be rightly guarded and instructed, 
that heartaches may not come to us 
and our homes, through our over- 
confidence and neglect, as suggest- 
ed in the remarks of President 
Smith, this morning., 

To us has been given the grand- 
est religious system in the world. 
To us has been given the greatest 
hopes that have ever been present- 
ed to mortals — the possibilties of 
eternal companionship, the associa- 
tion of husbands and wives, parents 
and children, in the eternities, based 
upon the laws of God, the laws of 
life, of morality, of temperance. 
Ours is a system based upon the 
proposition of industrious, thought- 
ful and prudent conduct, based upon 
continued and industrious effort up- 
on our part to seek to bring those 
that may be entrusted to our watch- 
care, to an understanding of all that 
is good. 

I want to indorse every sentiment 
that has been expressed looking to 
improvement in the establishment 
of industries, in the development of 
resources, in the opening of every 
door to the utilization of every good 
business enterprise that comes with- 
in our reach. I look around, upon 
the right hand and the left, I note 
that our friends, not of our faith, 
are gradually moving along the 
lines of the securing of the business 
concerns of our country; and I ask 
myself the question, Are we lack- 
ing in business tact, in skill, in in- 



dustry, in perseverence, in the un- 
derstanding of business, as com- 
pared with our neighbors, that their 
success and our failure should be 
so manifest? I ask the men who 
are under the sound of my voice, 
and our sisters as well, to look into 
these problems of the development 
of business interests, and secure to 
themselves a part in the coming tide 
of prosperity, in the development of 
some business that shall be a credit 
to themselves, and upon which their 
children may continue to build af- 
ter them. 

May the Lord bless and prosper 
the honorable and the good, those 
who seek the uplifting and better- 
ment of their kind, of all creeds 
and conditions. May that spirit 
spread, which was so manifest in 
the utterances of that grand man 
who, as President of the United 
States, stood on this stand, a few 
days ago, and made an appeal to 
his countrymen, that they cease 
their bickerings ; that they love their 
country ; that they seek its improve- 
ment and its advancement ; that they 
maintain the law in honor ; that they 
guide themselves in keeping with 
the principles of righteousness ; that 
they honor the Lord their God ; that 
they honor their country; that they 
honor each other's rights, and strive 
to uplift and make better the condi- 
tion of their fellowmen. That was 
his spirit, and these were the senti- 
ments that fell from his lips as he 
stood here, and they were, I believe, 
a joy to every right thinking man 
and woman under the sound of his 
voice, as he made that appeal to his 
fellowmen. 

That the Lord may inspire us 
with determination to be among the 
foremost in righteous works ; and 
finally, when our missions are 
done, that we may be crowned. with

everlasting life, in. the kingdom of 
our God, is my prayer, Amen. 



ELDER HEBER J. GRANT. 

Employment for the young a moral ne- 
cessity. — $5.00 paid for home-made 
goods pays $25.00 debts ! — Provo mills 
all wool goods four-fold better than 
eastern shoddy. — Vicious stories form- 
ulated here by enemies becoming 
harmless. — Admonition to retain land. 

' I am pleased to have the oppor- 
tunity of again meeting with the 
Latter-day Saints in general con- 
ference, and I hope that the same 
liberty of utterance, which has been 
granted to those who have already 
spoken, may be given to me ; that 
I may be able to say something 
here today which shall be for our 
mutual benefit. 

I have been deeply interested in 
all that has been said. One of the 
greatest desires of my life has been 
to live worthy of the father and 
the mother I have had; and one 
other of the greatest desires of my 
life is to rear my children in the 
nurture and admonition of the 
Gospel. One of the favorite themes 
I have ever had in preaching to 
the Latter-day Saints is derived 
from that revelation of the Lord 
which tells us that it is our duty to 
preach to our children and teach 
them the Gospel of Jesus Christ, 
inspire them with faith in the 
Lord and Savior of the world, and 
teach them to pray and walk up- 
rightly before the Lord. T believe 
this commandment has been much 
neglected, and I rejoiced exceed- 
ingly in the remarks of our Pres- 
ident today, urging the Latter-day 
Saints to do their duty in this re- 
spect. I have endeavored to do it, 
but I have made a resolution to 



be more faithful in doing so in the 
future. I believe there is oppor- 
tunity for improvement upon the 
part of all of us in this direction. 

I rejoiced to hear the remarks re- 
garding home manufacture. I 
have been considered a "crank," as 
enthusiastic advocates are called, 
on this subject all my life. From 
a boy of sixteen I have worn home- 
made clothes, and continued to do 
so until the Provo factory closed. 
I have believed in home industry, 
not only because I have listened to 
the inspired words of President 
Brigham Young, and of all his suc- 
cessors, on this theme, but because,, 
from a practical every-day stand- 
point, I know that it is beneficial 
to any community to raise and man- 
ufacture those things which they 
use. I believe it is a disgrace to 
us, as a people, that we are import- 
ing chickens, turkeys and butter by 
the carload. This community ought 
to produce all of these things, and 
it is a reflection on us that we bring 
them from abroad. I believe that 
no greater benefit, or moral up- 
lift, can come to a people than the 
establishment of industries where- 
by the young can have employ- 
ment. It has been my good for- 
tune, in connection with the breth- 
ren who originally started the first 
sugar factory in this community, to 
not only watch the progress of this 
industry but to find in many sec- 
tions where beets are raised, a won- 
derful growth in industry and an 
improvement in morals among the 
young people. I can remember, 
very distinctly, that we had to gw 
down — figuratively speaking — on 
our knees and crawl to the farmer 
to get him to raise beets enough to 
start the first factory. I can remem- 
ber that the farmers cuuld not get 
their boys to go out and weed and 



ELDER HEBER J. GRANT. 



thin the beets. They would say, "I 
don't have to." Now the boys have 
learned to grasp the opportunity for 
them to earn a little money and they 
are doing it, instead of being idle, 
and the communities, wherever 
there are industries of this kind, are 
benefited morally, to say nothing of 
the financial uplift. If we would 
study and reflect upon the actual 
benefits to a community by man- 
ufacturing at home the tilings that 
are used, and keeping our money 
here, we would realize that we 
would benefit ourselves every way 
in the long run. 

I have preached many times and 
quoted Bishop Farrell on this sub- 
ject. He remarked, here in the 
Assembly Hall, that one of the rea- 
sons he bought home-made goods 
was to keep the money in the coun- 
try so he would have a chance to 
get hold of it again. Now, there is 
a great deal in that statement. Our 
home manufactures give us increas- 
ed opportunities. Somebody has 
said that opportunity has a very 
large lock of hair on his forehead, 
and, as he comes along, you will 
have to grab him by the hair, be- 
cause, if you don't do it, he will 
get by, and as the back of his head 
is bald, your hand will slip off. 
Brother Farrell said he had been 
coming to conferences here, twice a 
year, for the past twenty years, and 
that during all this time, when he 
paid for his railroad ticket, he had 
endeavored to do so with a gold 
piece which he marked, as he knew 
the railroads were owned by east- 
ern capitalists, and he wondered if 
he would ever see any of this money 
again, and he never did. "But," he 
says, "I have marked many and 
many a five-dollar bill or gold 
piece that I have paid out for home- 
made goods, and I have got them 



back again, time and time again, 
because the money stayed in the 
community. Now, to give you a 
practical illustration," he said, "as 
I was leaving, on this identical trip, 
there was a crowd at the Smithfield 
depot. I saw a man who had made 
some shoes for my children, and I 
gave him five dollars in payment of 
those home-made shoes. He saw 
a man to whom he owed five dol- 
lars, and he gave him the money. 
This man saw somebody he was 
owing, and he handed him the 
money. This man saw another 
man to whom he was owing five 
dollars, and he gave it to him. So 
the five dollars went from one to 
another until it came to the fourth 
man, and he gave it back to me, say- 
ing, "I owe you six dollars, and 
here are five dollars on account.' 
That five dollar Dill cancelled 
twenty-five dollars of debts just as 
quick as it takes to tell it, and I 
put my 'home-made shoes/ figur- 
atively speaking, back in my own 
pocket." 

Now, if we had wisdom enough 
to look ahead of our noses — of 
course, mine is so long I can't look 
ahead of it. (Laughter.) But, if 
the people would only stop and take 
time to think of the ultimate bene- 
fits of sustaining home institutions, 
they would do it. It has been said 
that the tenderest part of 'the hu- 
man anatomy is a man's pocket ; 
and therefore the reason a man 
buys shoddy goods is that he thinks 
he is benefiting himself and saving 
money; but he is doing nothing of 
the kind. There is an old saying, 
and a true one — I used to have it 
on my letterheads, years ago — that 
"the best is always the cheapest." 
There is truth in it: I can buy a 
suit of clothes considerably cheaper 
since they quit manufacturing cloth 



28 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



at Provo; but I can wear it out in 
just about one-quarter of the time 
that I did a Provo suit. I can re- 
member wearing one suit of clothes, 
of Provo goods, for three years, and 
all I had to do was to clean them 
occasionally and have them pressed. 
Finally I gave them away and they 
lasted two years more. I have never 
struck a shoddy suit of clothes that 
I could wear more than a year. 

I believe, with all my heart, that 
there is a moral uplift in furnish- 
ing employment to our young peo- 
ple, and we make a mistake when 
we are not willing to follow the ad- 
vice and counsel of those whom God 
has placed to guide ihis people. I 
give the credit for the inspiration 
of Almighty God to that humble, 
faithful, meek man, Wilford Wood- 
ruff, for the establishment of the 
sugar industry in Utah, which has 
been worth millions of dollars to 
our, communities. The men of 
means, of large wealth, did not be- 
lieve that it could be established 
here. I know what I am talking 
about, because President Wilford 
Woodruff appointed me, in connec- 
tion with others, to get means — to 
solicit people to invest in that fac- 
tory. At first, men with large means 
would not put a dollar in it, but 
some of the same men have tens of 
thousands of dollars in this indus- 
try today. One of the strongest, 
if not the strongest, financial man 
in the community, in response to 
the request of the committee, put 
some money in the first factory, and 
as we were leaving, he asked me 
laughingly, if I knew where he 
could sell the stock for fifty cents 
on the dollar. The men who had 
the contract for building the first 
factory left the community, after 
running it a year or two, believing 
it would be a failure ; but it did not 



fail, and I want to tell you that 
when the inspiration of the Lord 
prompts our leaders to do anything, 
and the people back them up, there 
will be no failure. 

T have just returned from a trip 
to the east, and I rejoiced as I 
mingled among the people to find 
the good feeling there regarding 
the Latter-day Saints. I was im- 
pressed with the contrast between 
the feeling now and what it was 
some twenty years ago, when it fell 
to my lot to travel a good deal, and 
to mingle with business men. The 
change in sentiment toward the 
Latter-day Saints is very marked 
indeed, and I thank the Lord for it. 
I thank the Lord that the prejudice 
and the hatred that there used to 
be in the hearts of the people, from 
New York to San Francisco, has 
disappeared, and I will thank the 
Lord when it disappears at home. 
This is about the only place today, 
thank the Lord, that there is any 
hatred toward the Latter-day Saints. 
It has been said that the reputation 
of a man is what the world thinks 
of him, but character is what he is. 
Because of the vicious stories 
which have been told of us, the rep- 
utation of the Latter-day Saints has 
been bad ; but, thank the Lord, there 
is no Latter-day Saint who is liv- 
ing up to the Gospel of Jesus Christ, 
but what his character is absolutely 
above reproach. The people of the 
world are beginning to find this 
out. They are beginning to find 
that we are temperate, that we are 
industrious and virtuous, that we 
are honest, that we are patriotic, 
that we are godfearing; and when 
people find these things to be true 
of us, they are bound to respect us. 
I believe that we are making a 
very great mistake, many of us, es- 
pecially those who are farmers, in 



ELDER HEBER J. GRANT. 



29 



disposing of our lands. Much of 
the land on the Provo bench, and in 
other sections of the country, adapt- 
ed to fruit raising, is being sold to 
people who are coming in here from 
Colorado. The same identical class 
of land which they are buying here 
for $200 and $300 an acre, they 
have sold in Colorado for two, 
three and four thousand dollars an 
acre. They have sold their orch- 
ards in the East, and are coming 
here and buying just as good land 
for about ten per cent of what they 
got for their lands in the East. Let 
us keep our own lands, which are 
really gold mines. The great trou- 
ble with us is that we do not know 
their value. We do not know how 
much they will produce. We have 
not learned that, by intense cultiva- 
tion, by raising fruits, and by being 
careful to see that we get rid of 
the worms, and do our full duty by 
the soil, we can make it worth 
three and four times its present 
value. 

Now, I rejoice, as I said, in the 
good feeling which I have found 
in the East. I rejoiced to meet with 
the missionaries in Chicago, and in 
attending meetings with them in 
New York. I rejoice in the Spirit 
of the Lord which I find among 
those who are laboring for the 
spread of the Gospel of Jesus 
Christ. I rejoice in feeling that the 
Gospel satisfies every desire of the 
human heart, and in knowing that 
it is in very deed the truth. 

As I was coming home, I read a 
little book which I have read a 
number of times, and one passage 
impressed me more this time than 
at any former reading; it is as fol- 
lows : 

"Which of the religions of the world 
is the real, the final, the absolute truth?" 



After asking that question, the 
author says : 

"We must make our individual choice, 
and live by it as best we can. Every 
new sect, every new cult, has in it a 
grain of truth at least; it is this that at- 
tracts attention and wins adherents. This 
mustard-seed of truth is often over-esti- 
mated, darkening the eyes of man to the 
untrue parts or phases of the varying 
religious faiths. But in exact propor- 
tion to the basic truth they contain do 
religions last, become permanent and 
growing, and satisfy and inspire the 
hearts of men. Mushrooms of error 
have a quick growth, but they exhaust 
their vitality and die ; but truth still 
lives." 

I wish to say that I endorse, with 
all my heart, this statement, "But 
in exact proportion to the basic 
truth they contain do religions last, 
become permanent and growing, 
and satisfy and inspire the hearts 
of men." There is no Latter-day 
Saint living who is keeping the 
commandments of God, but what 
the truth of Almighty God, revealed 
through the Prophet Joseph Smith, 
satisfies and inspires him. It satis- 
fies all the yearnings of his heart ; 
there is nothing to desire in time or 
eternity, that the Gospel of Jesus 
Christ does not give. This work 
has grown in the face of all oppo- 
sition, in the face of all that has 
been said against it. In my judg- 
ment we are better, and we are do- 
ing more for the building up of the 
kingdom of God today, and living 
our religion better than ever before. 
I rejoice in this fact, and I rejoice 
in the peace and the happiness that 
each and every one, who is keeping 
the commandments of God, feels 
on every occasion. 

"The man who makes the acquisition 
of wealth the goal and ultimatum of his 
life, seeing it as an end rather than a 
means to an end, is not true. Why does 



30 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



the world usually make wealth the cri- 
terion of success, and riches the syn- 
onym of attainment? Real success in 
life means the individual's conquest of 
himself; it means 'how he has bettered 
himself,' not 'how has he bettered his 
fortune?' The great question of life is 
not, 'What have I ? but 'What am I ?' " 

Every Latter-day Saint who is 
loyal to the principles of the Gos- 
pel, is not seeking wealth ; he is not 
asking himself the question, "What 
have I," and "What can I gain?" 
The true Latter-day Saint is asking, 
"What can I do to better myself, to 
encourage those with whom I am 
associated, and to uplift the children 
of God?" That is the inspiration 
that comes to every Latter-day 
Saint who realizes the force of 
this Gospel that we have espoused. 
It is in very deed the Gospel of 
Jesus Christ. It is in very deed the 
plan of life and salvation. God 
lives; Jesus is the Christ, and He 
is the chief corner stone of this 
great work — He is directing it, and 
He will continue to direct it. He 
chose His prophet, and He gave 
him instructions and authority to 
establish this work; and the power 
and the influence of Joseph Smith 
are now being felt as the angel 
promised. His name is known for 
good or for evil all over the world ; 
but it is not known for evil except 
by those who malign him. Those 
who know him, those who know of 
his teachings, know that his life was 
pure and that his teachings were, in 
very deed, God's law. I rejoiced in 
bowing down, in the cottage erected 
in memory of him and in seeing the 
beautiful monument, and I shed 
tears of joy while supplicating God, 
in that cottage, and thanking Him 
that this monument had been built 
to the Prophet Joseph Smith. I 
thank God that I know he was a 
Prophet of God ; and I pray that 



every Latter-day Saint who has this 
knowledge may live up to it; I ask 
that we may have the power to do 
so. in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

The choir sang the anthem, 
"Worthy is the Lamb that was 
Slain." 

Benediction was pronounced by 
Patriarch John Smith. 

Conference adjourned until 10 a. 
m. Monday, Oct. 4th. 



OVERFLOW MEETING. 

An overflow session of the Con- 
ference was held in the Assembly 
Hall at 2 p. m., Elder Hyrum M. 
Smith presiding. Prof. Charles J. 
Thomas conducted the singing ex- 
ercises,assisted by the Temple choir. 

The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn, "An Angel from on 
High." 

Prayer was offered by Elder As- 
ahel H. Woodruff. 

The choir sang the hymn, "Come, 
thou glorious day of promise." 



ELDER ANDREW KIMBALL. 

(President of St. Joseph Stake.) 

I esteem it a great privilege, my 
brethren and sisters, to be called up- 
on to occupy this important posi- 
tion. It is not possible for me to 
attend all of these conferences. It 
has been something like eighteen 
months since I was here, and en- 
joyed such a privilege. It may be 
well in the few minutes allotted me 
to speak, to tell you of conditions 
as they exist in the southern part 
of Zion. 

In Arizona we have in the neigh- 



ELDER ANDREW KIMBALL. 



31 



borhood of 10,000 Latter-day 
Saints, in four stakes of Zion. There 
are 5,000 of these in the St. Jos- 
eph stake, over which I have the 
honor to preside, and these are 
scattered over a distance of nearly 
600 miles, which we have to travel 
to associate with them. Our stake 
work is different from that in most 
of the stakes of Zion, in that we do 
missionary work among those who 
are not of our faith, in the mining 
camps surrounding us, where there 
is a large number of Gentile peo- 
ple, ranging from 700 to 1,500 in- 
habitants. In these cities and towns 
we have gone out amongst the peo- 
ple and preached the Gospel, and 
assembled together the scattered 
Saints who have gone into those 
sections to seek employment. We 
have organized so that we have in 
operation all the various auxiliary 
organizations of the Church, and 
are drawing together those who, in 
many instances, were careless in 
their old home settlements. Boys 
and girls who did not take part in 
their home wards are put to work, 
and we are accomplishing a splen- 
did mission in this direction. 

I want to say to you that while it 
is a fact that we are far separated 
from the body of the Church, and 
do not enjoy many of those great 
privileges that are within your 
reach, we are in sympathy with 
you, and are permitted, by the bless- 
ings of the Lord, to enjoy the spir- 
it of the Gospel. And it comes to 
me as one of the strongest testi- 
monies that this is, indeed, the work 
of God in which we are engaged, 
in that the Lord does not forget us, 
and that we are in touch with and 
are permitted to enjoy the inspira- 
tion of the Lord which character- 
izes His work throughout all the 
world. 



I believe there are about ten ot 
our young men here, during this 
conference season, preparing to go 
on missions. Two of them left yes- 
terday. There are about fifty of our 
people who have come up to con- 
ference. When we realize that we 
come 1,400 miles the shortest route 
to attend this conference, there is 
an exhibition of faith, to say noth- 
ing of the expenditure of means. 
It costs us not less than $100 a 
head ; so there is an expenditure of 
$5,000 from our stake alone, ex- 
clusive of the missionaries, and the 
number that may have come from 
other stakes in our Territory, and 
also from Old Mexico, where the 
people are under similar conditions. 

I am pleased to report associated 
with me some splendid, stalwart 
men, my counselors and the high 
councilors, men who are united and 
whose hearts are in the work of 
God. The presidents of the differ- 
ent organizations and of the 
Priesthood are faithful in the dis- 
charge of their duties, so far as 
circumstances and conditions will 
allow them to attend to those du- 
ties. The Lord has held in reserve 
certain sections of the 'country, it 
seems to me, for the good of His 
people, and 1 recognize the hand of 
the Lord in that He has so reserved 
that choice section of the country 
lying east of Los Angeles in Ari- 
zona, a section very much like 
southern California and producing 
very much the same kind of pro- 
ducts. While we are yet in our 
youth as to home industries, our 
people are practically self-sustain- 
ing and independent. 

I desire to say a few words in 
regard to home industries, as sug- 
gested by our worthy President this 
morning, for nearly all my life I 
have advocated home industry. My 



32 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



father, Heber C. Kimball, was an 
advocate of home industries, and 
entered upon one of the first la- 
bors in that direction in Utah, op- 
erating mills for the making of 
linseed oil, the first that was ever 
made in the Territory. He also 
had a carding mill, which later de- 
veloped into a woolen mill. Do you 
know, my brethren and sisters, un- 
til I was sixteen years of age I 
never wore anything but homespun, 
made in that factory and the work- 
manship of my dear mother, who 
made my clothing until I was a 
young man. And I have never de- 
parted from those teachings ; I have 
always worn home-made goods 
when it was possible for me to do 
so; and I have patronized, and 
advocated, loud and long, the sus- 
taining of home industries in our 
western settlements. 

My brethren and sisters, I think 
I have discovered one of the se- 
crets of why we do not succeed 
with our home industries ; I be- 
lieve that it is jealousy, at least in 
part. Whenever one of our breth- 
ren, or a few of them, start out with 
a good desire in their hearts to 
build up a home industry, and keep 
at home the means of the people, 
and they commence to succeed, and 
it looks as though they were going 
to make a little, then some envious 
individuals are ready to pull them 
down; and they fail as a conse- 
quence of their jealousies. I do 
not, however, find this feeling pre- 
vailing in the section that I travel 
in. I am familiar with conditions 
in California ; during the past eleven 
years I have had to travel back and 
forth, through the great state of 
California, and I say to you, my 
brethren and sisters, that Califor- 
nia is for California. The City of 
Los Angeles is for Los Angeles, 



and the people there are always 
working for their own city, with 
the result that they have built up a 
great commonwealth there. They 
are sustaining their neighbors, and 
their own industries, and you da 
not find them buying goods made in 
other cities as long as they can get 
some of their own manufacture. So 
we find it elsewhere ; San Francisco 
is for San Francisco; and it was 
my pleasure also to notice the spirit 
of patriotism that was manifested in 
Portland while I was there recent- 
ly. In the great state of Oregon I 
found the same feeling of local pa- 
triotism. Everybody that says 
anything in that state, speaks for 
Oregon. I found that same spirit 
everywhere as I was riding up and 
down that state — everybody was 
partial to speak a good word for 
their own home industries, the fur- 
nishing of employment for their 
own people, and building up their 
own commonwealth. So I found it 
in the State of Washington, as it 
was my business to attend the irri- 
gation congress at Spokane recent- 
ly, and also witness the display in 
the fair, at Seattle of the products* 
of that great state. I never heard 
them talk about any other state. 
No, it was Washington, first, last 
and all the time — building up 
Washington, improving the pro- 
ducts, developing its resources and 
means of home production, that they 
might become wealthy. So I found 
it in Idaho also. They had a splen- 
did exhibition of their products in 
the Idaho building at the Fair. I 
found the same spirit, to a large ex- 
tent, throughout all these western 
states, where it has been my priv- 
ilege to travel. 

Arizona is only a babe yet, com- 
paratively speaking; but Arizona 
stands second in the production of

mineral. The greatest copper fields 
in the world are in Arizona. Ari- 
zona, too, is for Arizona. I am 
pleased to say also, that there is a 
fraternal feeling in Arizona. Those 
in that Territory who are not Lat- 
ter-day Saints recognize the Mor- 
mons as benefactors to their coun- 
try. They respect us, from the gov- 
ernor down, and treat us with every 
consideration that the Mormon peo- 
ple could expect or are worthy of. 
I am glad to say, too, that the 
spirit of jealousy I have mentioned 
does not exist in Arizona. We are 
always building up Arizona, and 
our neighbors who are not of us 
recognize in the Mormon people 
that we have been the means of do- 
ing something that they could net 
do, and that is, that we have, 
through our co-operative system of 
establishing settlements in Arizona, 
redeemed the deserts until today 
they are fertile" fields. We have 
built up towns and cities, and are 
establishing conditions in Arizona, 
through that co-operative system, 
and under the counsels of the 
priesthood, that are conducive of 
great good to our Territory, and 
the people of Arizona recognize 
this. 

Sometimes ministers of other de- 
nominations from the east, who are 
biased and prejudiced, knowing no 
better (God pity them) come into 
Arizona to look after some little 
congregation ; and, before they re- 
alize the folly of it, they fire a 
fusilade of abuse upon the Mormon 
people. The result is, they are dis • 
charged from their pastorates al- 
most immediately, and sent back to 
the non-progressive part of the 
world they came from. Not long 
ago a Methodist minister came into 
one of our towns, a county seat, 
where with a few exceptions, the 



population is non-Mormon. There 
was one young man, a son of one 
of our people, from Thatcher, a 
Mormon boy, who was employed 
there. He was waiting on a young 
lady there who was not of our faith, 
and they attended service at this 
place. This devout Methodist broth- 
er, not knowing any better, I pre- 
sume, began telling some of the 
old 'stories about the Prophet Jos- 
eph Smith, belittling the Mormon 
faith, and undertaking to abuse and 
deride out people. Now this coy 
from Thatcher hardly knew wheth- 
er he was himself a Latter-day 
Saint or not. When he was in 
Thatcher among "Mormons" he was 
called a Gentile; when he was 
among the Gentiles they called him 
a Mormon. He sat there on that 
occasion until he could stand it no 
longer, and, in the rough way char- 
acteristic of many of our western 
boys, he called this minister a liar. 
The result was that this rather 
strong expression was sustained by 
the people at the meeting. At the 
close of the service the minister 
came up to the boy and challenged 
him to a debate. The boy did not 
know anything scarcely about his 
religion, so he came down and 
asked me for some information to 
enable him to cope with the rev- 
erend gentleman ; and I believe it 
has made a complete "Mormon" of 
the boy. 

I am pleased to say, as I have re- 
ferred to it before, that the govern- 
or, the federal and Territorial of- 
ficials, prominent men and women 
throughout the Territory of Ari- 
zona, are all respectful, kind and 
considerate, so far as I know, to 
the "Mormon" people, and we are 
increasing in numbers, are friendly 
with our neighbors, and are united 
for the better Arizona. We are

building up its resources, and I 
hope in the immediate future we 
will get statehood, that Arizona 
may shine forth as one of the bril- 
liant stars in these United States. 

I am often reminded, in the in- 
difference of our people to sustain- 
ing home industries, of a certain 
picture caricature. You have often 
seen it, I have no doubt. It is the 
likeness of a big cow, with her f font 
quarters in the west and her hind 
quarters in the east, and she being 
milked at our expense. That is 
what is being done with reference 
to our material resources, of which 
the east is getting the benefit, and 
we are sustaining its manufactures. 
So I say to you, my brethren and 
sisters, I want to stand with the 
president of this Church in this 
matter of home industries. As I 
have said, I have always stood for 
them, in Utah, in Arizona, and else- 
where. Everybody that knows me 
knows that I proclaimed home in- 
dustries up and down this entire ter- 
ritory, trying to sell home products, 
and urging the people to patronize 
them. Now I belong to Arizona; 
my heart is in Arizona; I am for 
better Arizona ; I want to work for 
that territory, to bring it into state- 
hood, and make it shine brightly, 
and help to build it up, develop its 
resources, and locate homes for 
thousands of our people under the 
Reclamation act, that it may be a 
benefit to them. Such are the 
counsels that I give as I travel and 
labor for the good of Arizona and 
of this people. 

May the Lord bless us and help 
us to be loyal to the principles we 
have espoused and the Priesthood 
which He has given for our up- 
building, and instruction. May the 
Lord bless and preserve us, and 
bless and preserve our boys and 



girls, and enable us to keep them at 
home, keep them in of evenings and 
give them something to do. My 
confidence is that the boys and 
girls, if they are kept employed, 
and if we teach them and set them 
proper examples, will not go astray. 
Employment is one of the great 
potencies, if you please, for over- 
coming evil in young people ; keep 
them at work. 

Pardon me for one thought which 
occurs to me right at this time. 
My father, rather than allow his 
boys to go unemployed, made them 
go and wheel rocks in a barrow, 
and pile them up; when they were 
done with that, if he had nothing 
more for them to do, he would get 
them to wheel the rocks back again. 
An old gentleman came to him, 
soon after he came over from the 
old country, and wanted employ- 
ment. Father gave him a job 
wheeling rocks to a certain place 
and after he had got them all piled 
up nicely he came and reported. 
Father said, "Now, dear brother, 
wheel them back again." He said 
he wouldn't do that. Said he, "I 
was taught to try and accomplish 
something with my work." Father 
replied, "Didn't you want employ- 
ment? I hadn't any, and I didn't 
want to give you means for noth- 
ing. You will earn your wages by 
what I want you to do." I say to 
you, according to my observation 
and experience throughout the 
stakes of Zion and my own home 
work, that employment is the great 
secret of success. Let us give our 
boys and girls work. It seems to 
me that every hat and every dress 
should be made by our girls. Let 
our boys grow up to become me- 
chanics and good workmen. If we 
are going to patronize the east fo\

everything, we cannot accomplish 
this. 

May the Lord help us to accom 
plish our duty in all things, is m>

Amen. 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD. 

(President of Northwestern States 
Mission). 

I rejoice, my brethren and sisters, 
in this glorious privilege which I 
have as a missionary to return, oc- 
casionally, to the bosom of the 
Church and participate in these as- 
semblies of our general conference. 
The providences of God are daily 
manifest in our welfare, as Elders 
traveling in the missionary field. We 
appreciate that we have your confi- 
dence, and your faith and prayers in 
our behalf; but it does our hearts 
good to come and see you, face to 
face, and to feel that we are indorsed 
and appreciated in the course we are 
pursuing in our labors abroad in the 
world. I am sure the letters which 
come from the fatheis and mothers, 
wives and sisters of the Elders who 
are laboring in the missionary field, 
are a great source of comfort and 
inspiration to them. It gives them 
courage to perform their labors 
when, as sometimes, clouds lower 
down before them and the way 
looks dark and discouraging. Of- 
ten you are able, by the cheering 
words that you send, to lift their 
spirits and buoy them up, for then 
they feel that, no matter what their 
circumstances may be, at home 
there are hosts of friends and dear 
ones standing behind them, who are 
expecting each Elder to do his full 
duty ; and it spurs the Elders on. I 
am sure that it inspires and 



strengthens those who are absent 
from their dear ones, laboring in 
the great cause, for which they are 
sacrificing the comforts and society 
of home ; and I hope, as you are an 
inspiration to us, that our labors 
shall prove an inspiration to you, 
and that we shall be able, when we 
return from time to time, to show 
forth by the improvement we have 
made that the time and means have 
been well and profitably spent, that, 
if we have not been able to save 
many souls, we have most certain- 
ly benefited ourselves. I want to 
say to you that we are delighted 
to be able to accomplish the work 
for which we are sent, and for 
your encouragement and that it 
may be, perhaps, a source of inspir- 
ation to you, I will give you a brief 
comparative report for the four 
months of May, June, July, and 
August of 1908 as compared with 
the same months of this year, show- 
ing the progress in the Northwest- 
ern States Mission with an average 
of eight more Elders than there 
were last year. We do not give 
this in a spirit of boasting but in 
one of gratefulness to our Heavenly 
Father that we have been able to 
accomplish the labors we have per- 
formed.

Of books sold, 833 were Books 
of Mormon, while only 412 were 
sold in the mission for the entire 
year of 1908. 

In the matter of baptisms there is 
an increase of 25 per cent, and from 
the increased seed sown there are 
splendid indications of an increased 
harvest. 

So we feel glad to be in the field, 
and in the fight, and each man has 
expressed himself as feeling eager 
to push the work. We are deter- 
mined to keep the banners waving 
wherever they have been planted, 
and to carry them to other places, 
until every soul in that land shall 
have heard the truth, and have an 
opportunity to receive the same; 
and we shall endeavor to set exam- 
ples as worthy servants of our Mas- 
ter. 

If there is one thing that has giv- 
en us sorrow it is finding so many 
of our girls who have married out- 
side of the Church and located in 
the northwest country. I could re- 
late stories from their experiences 
that would occupy hours, telling of 
the disappointment and sorrow they 
have known through disobeying the 
counsel of their parents in this mat- 
ter. I remember one told by a Mor- 
mon girl, a grand-daughter of one 
of the prominent brethren of this 
Church, and I give it as a testimony 
to support the advice of President 
Smith on this matter. She married 
outside of the Church to her sor- 
row as shown by her life today. 



Her husband was bitter toward the 
Church and laughed at the men and 
things she held sacred. He was not 
a moral man, but rather seemed to 
delight in the sorrow he caused his 
wife, as she learned of his infidel- 
ity to her. No pleading could in- 
duce him to change his manner of 
life, while she was compelled to 
endure terrible mental torture. In 
the midst of strangers, there was 
only one being whom she could 
trust, from whom she derived any 
comfort or consolation ; it was her 
only child, a little six-year-old girl 
upon whom she lavished her heart's 
affections. A few weeks before I 
met her, the little girl sickened and 
died. It seemed then that her only 
comfort, her hope, her all had gone, 
and, under this terrible strain, she 
was so beside herself that she even 
thought seriously of taking her own 
life. She said to me, shaking her 
sorrowing head, "If Mormon girls 
could only profit by my experience, 
they would gladly accept their fath- 
er's advice and their fond mother's 
wishes, and marry within the 
Church men whom they could trust, 
whose sympathies would be with 
them." 

I want to say to you, my brothers 
and sisters, that I sustain the advice 
and counsel that was given along 
this line by President Smith, be- 
cause of the experiences that have 
come within my observation. While 
there are honorable Gentiles who 
marry Mormon girls, every girl 
who is thus married is risking her 
happiness here and hereafter. I 
believe that marriage is one of the 
most serious and important steps in 
life. Whatever we may accumu- 
late in life, we will leave when we 
die, but the woman who is sealed 
to a man according to the law of 
God is his for time and all eternity,

and the children that are born to 
them in that covenant will be theirs 
eternally. There is nothing else 
that we can gain in this world, out- 
side of our resurrected bodies, and 
experiences, that will cling to us 
and stand with us forever. I be- 
lieve that every girl should feel the 
importance of that step. She should 
realize its far reaching conse- 
quences, and satisfy herself, by a 
testimony through the Spirit of 
God, that her decision is a right 
one, just as thoroughly as she may 
know that God lives and that the 
• Gospel is true. If she would take 
this course and listen to the advice 
of her parents, she would be spared 
much trouble and sorrow. After 
all, they come back to the counsel 
of father and mother, after years 
of distress, with stripes and scars 
upon them. We are doing what 
we can to comfort these girls. We 
encourage them to raise their chil- 
dren in the Church, and we are 
teaching them to set an example to 
the community where they reside 
that shall reflect credit upon the 
work of the Lord, and assist to 
redeem them, so far as can be, from 
the errors into which they have fall- 
en. God is helping us in this di- 
rection. 

I want to speak of the fair at 
Seattle, and of the Church exhibit 
in the Government building. We 
think this has been one of the most 
important events in the history of 
our Church, because, unsolicited by 
us, we were extended an invitation, 
by the Smithsonian Institute, to 
make an exhibit showing the influ- 
ence of the Church in developing 
the west. You who were there saw 
the fine representation we had in the 
models of the tabernacle and the 
temple ; maps showing the route of 
the pioneers and the Mormon Bat- 



talion, and others indicating the 
hundreds of towns and cities which 
the Latter-day Saints have found- 
ed; the press upon which the Book 
of Mormon was printed, and the 
one on which the first issue of the 
Deseret News was printed ; the od- 
ometer with which the mileage was 
measured and recorded as the pio- 
neers traveled to these valleys ; 
portraits of some thirty leaders of 
this great latter day movement, and 
other things of great interest and 
historical importance. These were 
in the Government building, the 
most interesting one at the fair, 
and most of the people visited it. 
There have been in attendance at 
the fair nearly 3,250,000 people, and 
it is expected by the close of the 
fair that 4,000,000 will have visited 
it; without doubt 90 per cent of 
those who visit the fair go into the 
Government building anu see our 
exhibits there. It has been our priv- 
ilege to have some of the brethren 
located in that section to give in- 
formation concerning the exhibits. 
We have by this means corrected 
many stories that would have been 
told by those who pretend to be 
well informed, and who would have 
related the old falsehoods. In this 
too we have enjoyed the friendship 
and good feelings of the crowds, 
and those in authority at the build- 
ing, and they have told the truth 
with reference to our people. It has 
certainly done my heart gjod to see 
after long years of waiting, due 
appreciation of the Mormon pio- 
neers, and though most of them 
have passed away and did not hear 
these words of praise, but were 
under constant misrepresentation by 
the world, to"see them come to their 
own, and receive the credit which 
is due them, I say, does my heart 
good. I am pleased that their chil- 



38

dren can listen to just eulogies, as 
they come from the thousands who 
now witness in its true light the 
work of the Latter-day Saints. One 
of the officials of the fair, in a re- 
ception given to the governor of 
this state, said that Oregon and 
Washington, and the other great 
states of the Western country, 
would never have been what they 
are today had it not been for the la- 
bors of the Mormon pioneers. I be- 
lieve that is true, and I rejoice that, 
after all these years, recognition 
comes, and that it comes from our 
great government in the invitation 
proffered to our Church to present 
these exhibitions of facts to the 
people of this country. 

The choir also visited the fair, 
and I know that they accomplished 
an immense amount of good. In 
Portland, Tacoma, and Seattle, the 
houses were crowded, and I have a 
mind to read you two brief ex- 
tracts from a leading paper in Se- 
attle, showing how well they were 
received, because it remained for 
the Salt Lake Tabernacle Choir to 
establish the highest mark in the 
matter of attracting the largest 
number of people in one place dur- 
ing the fair, and perhaps in the his- 
tory of the northwest. Even the 
visit of the president of the United 
States, a few days ago, did not at- 
tract as large a crowd to the Natur- 
al Amphitheatre, by several thou- 
sands, as did the choir in that place 
at their Sunday evening concert. 
Their first concert in Seattle was 
given in the Auditorium building, 
on the fair grounds, on Thursday 
evening, August 16th. I have at- 
tended numerous entertainments in 
this building, some of them grand 
musical events, when the doors 
were thrown open to the public, and 
no admission charged, but in no in- 



stance was the building filled, and, 
so far as I know, only once has 
it been filled to overflowing, and 
that was upon the occasion of the 
concert given by our choir. Al- 
though an admission of 75c and $1 
was charged, every seat was sold, 
and hundreds paid to stand, while 
more than five hundred people were 
turned away. I stood on the steps, 
and actually saw people shed tears 
because they could not gain admis- 
sion. 

The Post Intelligencer of Seattle 
said of this entertainment : 

"Three thousand people were enrap- 
tured by three hundred voices in the 
exposition auditorium last night when 
the famous Mormon Tabernacle Choir 
gave a concert. . The audience tired 
itself with encoring the numbers. 
Many musical treats have been of- 
fered the people attending the fair 
and others are to come, but there has 
not been, so far, any program, vocal 
or instrumental, that seemed to be re- 
ceived with the same satisfaction as 
that caused by the Tabernacle Choir." 

We all regret that the choir did 
not enter the contest, for every- 
body conceded that it would have 
taken the prize, but I believe that 
it was justified in declining. The 
prize money was furnished by the 
fair officials to the Welsh Associa- 
tion, who were to make their own 
arrangements for the contest. They 
seemed to have taken an extra dose 
of the "Seattle Spirit" and em- 
ployed methods unheard of to 
charge each singer 75c admission, 
notwithstanding they had paid their 
own way from distant homes. 
There was no provision for seats 
for the singers. On eleven other 
occasions when the choir has sung 
in contests they were not charged 
admission, and so were not prepared 
for this surprise. The officials in 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD. 



39 



charge of this entertainment were 
not as civil to the singers as they 
should have been, and as you know, 
singers are sensitive, they felt that 
this was adding insult to injury. 
And who were their opponents in 
this contest? A local company of 
singers with little reputation in this 
line, not in the same class, not "a foe 
worthy of their steel;" after all to 
win the prize would only be an 
empty honor. The choir committee, 
however, sought the management 
of the association, and were pre- 
pared to pay the unjust admission 
fee asked, but a determination was 
evinced to keep them out, and furth- 
er insulting and abusive language 
was used. The committee, therefore, 
decided that the choir should with- 
draw, feeling that the matter of this 
contest was only a disagreeable in- 
cident of their trip, and that they 
would not humiliate themselves be- 
fore such intolerance. 

The shabby treatment of the 
choir by the Welsh association was 
resented by the fair officials, who 
immediately offered $500, and ad- 
mission for two days, if they would 
give a sacred concert in the Na- 
tural Amphitheatre on the follow- 
ing Sunday evening. This was 
agreed to. And a great majority 
of the people also resented this 
treatment was manifest, by their 
large attendance at this sacred con- 
cert. The grand ovation given the 
choir marked the largest gathering, 
as I have said before, in the history 
of the fair. Of this event the paper 
before quoted had this to say : 

"Seattle's tribute to the grand con- 
cert of high class music last evening, 
by the Tabernacle Choir of Salt Lake 
City, under the direction of Evan 
Stephens, assisted by Ellery's band, 
in the Natural Amphitheatre on 
the Alaska- Yukon-Pacific Exposition 
grounds, was a crowd numbering be- 



tween 20,000 and 25,000 persons. Noth- 
ing like it has ever been seen in the 
history of the city. Distinguished 
persons have come and gone, have had 
their hearing and been cheered by as- 
sembled thousands, but all these trib- 
utes sink into insignificance in com- 
parison with the spectacle of last 
night." 

We are enjoying the most friend- 
ly relations with leading men of 
that section ; some of them have said 
to us "We want you Mormons to 
come out into our country, we have 
seen what you can do. We want 
you to come and establish your- 
selves with us." I will state just 
one instance to show the favor with 
which we are received, and the lack 
of interest that is shown toward 
those who are trying to raise funds 
to "convert" the Mormons. One of 
our distinguished ministers of Salt 
Lake City attempted to hold a meet- 
ing in the city of Seattle on the 23rd 
of September. I speak with due re- 
gard for the gentleman ; I wish that 
all ministers were as fair and hon- 
orable. He was engaged in the 
business of securing means with 
which to establish missions for the 
conversion of the Mormons in Utah, 
and was trying to interest the peo- 
ple in this matter. I have nothing 
to say regarding what he said, but 
only concerning the response that 
was given to his appeal. Several 
articles appeared in the papers, ad- 
vertising his meeting to be held in 
a building that would seat at least 
3,000 people, a magnificent church, 
one of the finest I have ever seen. 
Two rectors appeared with him, and 
tracts were distributed on all of the 
seats for the thousands who were 
expected to attend, but only fifteen 
persons gathered in the building to 
hear his address, and three of these 
were Utah people who came out of 
curiosity. As a contrast to this, a 



40

few days before we held a confer- 
ence in that city, and though we 
have only about 150 members in 
Seattle, and we did not get much 
•newspaper notice, yet at our humble 
gathering there were 350 present. 
I felt in my heart to say that God 
has turned the tide in favor of Zion, 
and we feel fired with a holy zeal 
to seek to establish the truth. We 
know we have the interest and sym- 
pathy of the Latter-day Saints, and 
also of thousands of honorable men 
and women of the earth. 

God bless the Latter-day Saints, 
that they may continue to live 
worthy lives, that more than ever 
we may be able to point with pride 
to them and their glorious achieve- 
ments. We thank God for the in- 
tegrity of the men and women of 
Zion, who abide in the faith, and for 
the young men and women who 
are determined to take the same 
stand that their fathers have taken. 
May God increase our efficiency to 
do the work He has placed upon 
our shoulders; may we be valiant 
for the truth; and may the Lord 
bless us that we may establish the 
standard of truth, and keep it wav- 
ing until all men everywhere may 
learn to love it, that they may re- 
ceive the reward of the righteous, 
which may God grant in the name 
of Jesus. ' Amen.

ELDER JOSEPH W. M'MTJKRIN. 

I have rejoiced, my brethren and 
sisters, in listening to the words 
that have been spoken by the breth- 



ren who have occupied this position 
this afternoon. I pray that the 
words that may fall from my lips 
may be directed by the Spirit of the 
Lord, that I may have the same 
Spirit of instruction that has im- 
pressed the brethren in the words 
that have already been uttered in 
our hearing. 

A great variety of thoughts have 
passed through my mind in listen- 
ing to the testimonies that have 
been borne in this meeting, and also 
in listening to the musical exercises. 
We commenced our services by 
singing the hymn, "An Angel from 
on High, the long, long silence 
broke." I suppose the great major- 
ity of those who are gathered to- 
gether in this holy house this after- 
noon believe that the words I have 
quoted, — relative to the coming of 
an angel, — have had a fulfillment ; 
that at last, after- a long silence be- 
tween the heavens and the eart:i, 
in the age in which we are living 
the silence has been broken, and an 
angel, clothed with power and au- 
thority from- our Father in heaven, 
has wended his way to earth, bring- 
ing the fulness of the everlasting 
Gospel, and giving a commandment 
that it should be preached to all 
who are dwelling upon the earth. 
That is the belief of the Latter-day 
Saints. Their declaration among 
all peoples in all the earth is, that 
they are operating, by virtue of this 
commandment of our Father in 
heaven. The ministry in which we 
are engaged is by Divine appoint- 
ment, an authority such as was ex- 
ercised by the holy apostles an- 
ciently, and which had been lost 
from among men, in fulfillment of 
predictions of the inspired servants 
of God, who, when under the in- 
spiration of the Lord, were enabled 
to look into the future history of 



ELDER JOSEPH W. McMURRIN.

the world and discover that there 
would come a period when men 
would be without authority. 

There are a very great many peo- 
ple who do not believe in the res- 
toration of the authority of which 
I am speaking. I could not, how- 
ever, help but feel, while listening 
to the words that have been spoken 
in our hearing, that many of the 
very precious promises that have 
been made by our Father in heaven 
are having- an actual and remark- 
able fulfillment. 

I will read a few words from the 
revelations that have been given by 
the Lord in relation to His work as 
it was to be established among men 
in this great dispensation. I read 
from a revelation given at a very 
early period, in the year 1829, 
which was before there was any 
such an organization among men as 
the Church of Jesus Christ of Lat- 
ter-day Saints. The Lord says : 

"Now, behold, a marvelous work is 
about to come forth among the chil- 
dren of men; therefore, O ye that em- 
bark in the service of God, see that 
ye serve Him with all your heart, 
might, mind and strength, that ye 
may stand blameless before God at 
the last day." 

I consider, my brethren and sis- 
ters, that this is a very marvelous 
declaration. It is a declaration that 
was made over and over again by 
the Lord, through the mouth of the 
Prophet Joseph Smith, in the reve- 
lations that were given to him at 
the opening of this dispensation. 
When one stops to analyze, for a 
few moments, the lowly condition 
of Joseph Smith, the founder, by 
Divine appointment, of this great 
work of the Latter-days, and at- 
tempts to weigh and consider the 
unpreparedness of his condition, 
from a purely human point of view, 



one could scarcely believe — I sup- 
pose no one did believe, at the in- 
ception of the work, unless it were 
revealed to him by the Spirit and 
power of God — that there would 
ever be any fulfilment of the words 
I have read in this opening para- 
graph, that a marvelous work and 
a wonder was about to come forth 
among the children of men. 

My brethren and sisters, when 
we take time to look into the his- 
tory of this people the Latter-day 
Saints we find abundant evidence 
it seems to me, to justify us in the 
belief we entertain, that Joseph 
Smith was an inspired man. I 
wonder, sometimes, how it is possi- 
ble for those who are not of us, to 
fail in discovering the Divinity of 
the work he was instrumental in 
establishing among men. 

You all know there is a passage 
of scripture in the Old Testament 
wherein the Lord says : 

"When a prophet speaketh in the 
name of the Lord, if the thing follow 
not, nor come to pass, that is the 
thing which the Lord hath not spok- 
en, but the prophet hath spoken it 
presumptuously; thou shalt not be 
afraid of him." 

But, on the other hand, what are 
we to understand when one speaks 
in the name of the Lord, and the 
thing that is spoken comes to pass, 
particularly when the things that 
are spoken are beyond the power of 
man to foresee, naturally, and ap- 
pear to be impossible of fulfilment? 
My understanding is we are then to 
know the man is sent of God, and 
we should be afraid to turn a deaf 
ear to his warning. 

I am of the opinion that the 
clause I have read from the revela- 
tion concerning the marvelous char- 
acter of the work that was to be 



42 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



introduced by the Prophet Joseph, 
at the time it was given, was en- 
tirely beyond the power of man, of 
Joseph himself, to foresee; it ap- 
peared to be impossible of accom- 
plishment. We have listened this 
afternoon to some of the evidences 
bearing upon the fulfillment of pre- 
dictions that have been made. Are 
we impressed with what we have 
heard, and do we give praise to 
God, or do we become so accus- 
tomed to such testimonies that we 
allow them to pass without serious 
consideration, as a mere matter of 
history, and think nothing more 
about them? One brother, Elder 
Andrew Kimball, president of the 
St. Joseph stake, told us a story this 
afternoon of ten thousand Latter- 
day Saints in Arizona, and incident- 
ally mentioned the fact that there 
are other thousands over the line in 
the Republic of Mexico, who also 
are identified with the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 
Then another brother, President 
Melvin J. Ballard of the North- 
western States Mission, stood up 
and told of the Latter-day Saints 
who are in Oregon, and who are in 
Washington, and who are in other 
districts of the country in these 
great United States of America, 
where he is called to labor, all of 
whom have given allegiance to the 
work that was planted, about eighty 
years ago, by the boy Joseph Smith. 
If the whole story were told in 
its completeness, we would discover 
that in every part of the civilized 
world there are hosts of men and 
women who have been convinced of 
the truth of what the world has 
nicknamed Mormonism, and have 
been made to feel, in their whole 
beings, that it is not the delusion 
it is thought by some to be, but 
that it is the power of God unto sal- 



vation. These converts to Mor- 
monism have given every possible 
evidence that they have been born 
of the Holy Spirit, by doing all that 
mortal men could do in attestation 
of their faith, and their confidence 
in the great work that has been es- 
tablished. 

The Lord God of heaven made 
the announcement as a preface to 
this Book of Commandments, to all 
the inhabitants of the earth, that 
His work would prevail. This thing 
has not been done in a corner. It 
has not been hidden up by the 
works of men, but it has been like 
a city set upon a hill that all the 
world might see it. That has been 
the manner and the character of 
the establishment of the work of 
the Lord in the latter times. Hear 
what the Lord has said : 

"And the voice of warning shall be 
unto all people, by the mouths of my 
disciples, whom I have chosen in 
these last days. And they shall go 
forth and none shall stay them, for I, 
the Lord have commanded them." 

That is not written like it came 
from the Scribes or Pharisees. The 
spirit of these words as one reads 
them, has the ring and sound of 
one speaking by authority. This 
proclamation was to all the inhab- 
itants of the earth. The language 
is: 

"Behold, this is mine authority, and 
the authority of my servants, and my 
preface unto the Book of my com- 
mandments, which I have given them 
to publish unto you, O inhabitants, of 
the earth. Wherefore, fear and trem- 
ble, O ye people, for what I the Lord 
have decreed in them shall be ful- 
filled." 

I believe it. My brethren and 
sisters, I feel the truth of this an- 
nouncement, in my whole being. 



ELDER JOSEPH E. ROBINSON.

This is not like what an imposter 
would write. Think of Joseph 
Smith who then stood alone, and 
without any following. Joseph 
Smith, the youth, in his loneliness 
and ostracism, and in his lack of 
training and power of leadership, 
from a human point of view, tell- 
ing the inhabitants of the earth to 
"fear and tremble." My brethren 
and sisters, it was not Joseph Smith 
it was the Lord of heaven, crying 
to the people to hearken to His 
voice, and to His proclamation. 
The promise of the Lord is : 

"And again, verily, I say unto you, 
O inhabitants of the earth, I the Lord 
am willing to make these things 
known unto all flesh. * * Search 
these commandments for they are 
true and faithful, and the prophecies 
and promises which are in them shall 
all be fulfilled." 

That was the declaration of 
Mormonism in the very commence- 
ment. Every soul who has hon- 
estly and prayerfully tested the 
promise couched in the words I 
have just read has been made to 
know that the promise is of God, 
and not of man. Efforts have been 
made in every land and clime, and 
among every people where the mis- 
sionaries have carried these glad 
tidings, to stop the advancement of 
Mormonism, and yet we have heard 
from this missionary, as we will 
probably hear from other mission- 
aries during this conference—for the 
story is the same from every land 
— that Mormonism is working its 
way among honest, thoughtful men, 
and they are yielding obedience to 
its principles, and are willing to 
sacrifice everything they have upon 
the earth, if need be, for its success. 
That is the story of Mormonism. It 
has been so from the very begin- 
ning. The word of the Lord God 



has been fulfilled, and this work 
has not halted, and it never will 
halt, worlds without end, for God, 
the Ruler and Creator, has made 
the promise, and He is able to ful- 
fill it. We need have no anxiety 
about the onslaughts that are made 
against us by the ungodly. The 
concern of every member of the 
Church should be as to whether or 
not his full duty is being performed. 
Let me again read one of the par- 
agraphs from the Book of Com- 
mandments : 

"Therefore, O ye that embark in 
the service of God, see that ye serve 
Him with all »our heart, might, 
mind and strength, that ye may stand 
blameless before God at the last day." 

My brethren and sisters, if we 
are serving the Lord in this manner 
all is well. I commend this par- 
agraph to the earnest consideration 
of all who are assembled here to- 
day. When we consider how the 
promises of God are being fulfilled, 
we ought to be able and willing to 
put our trust in Him, and follow 
where He leads, for when the finish 
comes it will be found that victory 
has perched upon the banners of 
Israel, and upon all who have been 
willing to keep the commandments 
of God. 

May the Lord help us to be with 
that victorious number, is my hum- 
ble prayer, in the name of Jesus ^ 
Christ. Amen. 



ELDER JOSEPH E. ROBINSON. 

(President of California Mission.) 

"How beautiful upon the mountains 
are the feet of him that bringeth 
good tidings, that publisheth peace, 
that bringeth good tidings of good, 
that publisheth salvation, that sayeth 
unto Zion, Thy God reigneth! Thy

watchmen shall lift up the voice; 
with the voice together shall they 
sing; for they shall see eye to eye, 
when the Lord shall bring again 
Zion." 

These words, spoken over two 
thousand years ago by the poet- 
prophet Isaiah, came to my mind 
while listening to the words of tes- 
timony and encouragement spoken 
by Elder McMurrin. I desire very 
much to enjoy the spirit of truth 
and to be assisted by your faith and 
prayers that what I say may be of 
mutual worth and advantage. I re- 
joice in the Gospel ; I rejoice in the 
work that is being done at home and 
abroad. 

I have the honor of laboring with 
some thirty men of worth and in- 
tegrity, your husbands and your 
sons, who are preaching the Gos- 
pel to the people of California, Ne- 
vada and Arizona, or some parts of 
those two latter states. You know 
them, you who are acquainted with 
them. You know their worth and 
their integrity, and you know the 
sacrifices that you are making in or- 
der that they may stay in the field. 
How good it is to know that they 
are soldiers of the cross, and that 
the same spirit with which David 
went out to meet Goliath and the 
Philistines is on these men — some 
of them hardly men as yet — boys 
you may call them. So do they go 
forth in the strength of the God of 
Israel to declare His word, that the 
hour of His judgment is come, and 
that His kingdom has been estab- 
lished again in the earth. Because 
of the courage, and unselfishness of 
these men, because of their holiness 
and virtue, because of the words of 
wisdom they speak, because of your 
prayers, Decause they are magni- 
fied in the eyes of men, by the eter- 
nal Father, they have not feared 



the world, and are winning souls to 
Christ. 

One of the most successful years 
thus far that we have had in the 
California mission is the present 
one, in the work of preaching the 
Gospel, baptizing converts, the dis- 
position of books, and in giving 
away tracts. In fact, we have been 
sufficiently successful to arouse the 
active antagonism of some of the 
so-called teachers of peace, who are 
contending for dogma and the 
creeds of men, but who are far re- 
moved from the mighty principles 
of truth, and the example, labors 
and life of the Master, who estab- 
lished His word and His work 
anciently, as He has established it 
in these days, by revelation, through 
the voice of prophets, and by the 
vision of seers. » 

A week ago, in the city of San 
Diego, there was gathered together 
a group of representatives of one 
of the great, so-called "Christian" 
churches of the day. They were in 
conference assembled, but I could 
not help marking the difference in 
the spirit manifested there and the 
Spirit we enjoy today. They met 
and sang, as we have done; they 
prayed, as we have prayed, to God, 
the Eternal Father, and they par- 
took of the Holy Communion. They 
then asked for a statement or reck- 
oning of the funds of the mission 
society. After this, one of the rev- 
erend gentlemen who has spent long 
years in Utah in the interest of that 
society, and who claims to be fa- 
miliar with this people and their 
teachings, arose and edified the 
body with a dissertation along all 
the lines of meanness that has ever 
been spoken or written about our 
people. Then they were prepared 
to pass the plate, so that the mis- 
sionary society can be sustained in

this land. Charges were made that 
we are teaching the dogmas of 
Joseph Smith and Brigham Young, 
and that our hearts and lives are far 
removed from anything that savors 
of Christianity, or of the principles 
of republicanism, that obtains in 
our government. 

In the northern parts of the state, 
they became so exercised that they 
formed a concerted plan of on- 
slaught upon our people, and for 
some few weeks a battle with some 
of our brethren occurred in the 
newspapers, in the press of the 
country in that locality, and they 
were helped and abetted by the ful- 
some press of this city, and by some 
of the satellites- of disappointed pol- 
iticians and apostate Latter-day 
Saints. We could not help but ad- 
mire our brethren for the courage 
and calmness with which they an- 
swered the slanders and calumnies 
heaped upon our people, for they 
answered them, though in the spirit 
of kindness, with such force and 
philosophy that the enemy was put 
to rout. Then our brethren turned 
somewhat aggressive. They asked 
those ministers to state by whom 
they were authorized to preach ; 
by what right they administered in 
the ordinances of the Gospel ; by 
what right they preached and ad- 
ministered in the name of Christ for 
hire, instead of serving the people 
and preaching the word of God, 
conducting their work upon the 
lines instituted by the Master? Re- 
minding them that the Lord said: 
"Freely ye have received, freely 
give," and declared that His Gospel 
was for the poor and the oppressed, 
for all who would come and par- 
take of the waters of life, that His 
word and His Gospel were without 
money and without price. 

These men said they would make 



no answer to any such contention 
as this, and signed their last article 
and withdrew from the field. Then 
one of the papers, in an editorial, 
arraigned them most severely for 
the manner in which they treated 
us, saying their methods were char- 
acterized by no traits of gentility, 
let alone the Christian character, 
which they professed. The editor 
wanted to know why they did not 
answer the questions propounded 
by our brethren ; and it has resulted 
in much good. So our hearts are 
filled with joy, because we have 
been able to get the attention and 
active consideration of the people. 
It is the indifference of the people 
in any missionary field that is hurt- 
ful to our feelings. If we can 
arouse the people sufficiently that 
they become interested enough even 
to oppose us, we then feel assured 
of this fact: that if we have their 
ears in this cause we can divest 
their minds of prejudice that they 
have imbibed and, perhaps, through 
the grace of God, impart unto them 
some of the principles of eternal 
life, that they may enter into the 
joy of the Lord. They may then 
taste some of the peace of the gos- 
pel of Christ ; peace that does away 
with error and superstition, that 
enters into the souls of men and 
elevates them far beyond the tri- 
fling things of earth ; that relieves 
them of distrust and fear and trem- 
bling that belong to the wicked. 
That peace of which President 
Smith spoke in his remarks, that 
lifts the Latter-day Saint above the 
vagaries of men, above their bick- 
erings, strifes and jealousies; the 
peace that is spoken of in the olden 
scriptures by the Master Himself, 
when He speaks of the kingdom of 
heaven, as we read it in the 13th 
chapter of St. Matthew. Jesus said : 



46 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



"The kingdom of heaven is likened 
unto a treasure hid in a field; the 
which, when a man hath found, he 
hideth, and for joy thereof goeth 
and selleth all that he hath, and 
buyeth that field. Again, the king- 
dom of heaven is like unto a mer- 
chantman seeking goodly pearls ; 
who, when he had found one pearl 
of great price, went and sold all 
that he had, and bought it." The 
lesson that we draw from these 
two parables is this : that in the pos- 
session of this pearl of great price 
he came into God's peace ; he came 
to the peace of the kingdom of 
heaven and into the possession of 
joy and truth far above the riches 
of the kings and princes of the 
earth, richer than one would be 
with all the untold wealth of the 
Indies. 

Men who possess this peace re- 
joice. Such men, President Smith 
said, are lifted above the mundane 
things of this sphere and its petty 
strifes. Such men stand, as it were, 
above the clouds, like some great 
mountain capped with snow; whilst 
at its base there may be thunder 
and lightnings, floods and earth- 
quakes, and all below is hidden from 
the light of the sun, and there is 
darkness, clouds and gloom, upon 
its head shines the rays of the efful- 
gent sun. All is serene with such 
a man ; he is in possession of peace 
that is above the earth. So it was 
with Joseph Smith when, persuad- 
ed to retrace the steps he had taken 
toward the peaceful abode he had 
foreseen for his people in the val- 
leys of the mountains, he said to his 
brethren: "I go like a lamb to the 
slaughter, yet my conscience is void 
of offense towards God and all men. 
I am calm as a summer's morning, 
and it shall yet be said of me, 'He 
was murdered in cold blood.' " No 



man could have that peace and pos- 
sess such equanimity of soul unless 
God was with him and he in God's 
peace; unless he was in possession 
of the "pearl of great price" that 
the nusbandman sold all his posses- 
sions for, and then felt that joy that 
is unsurpassable. 

So the Latter-day Saints should 
comfort themselves with this assur- 
ance that, whilst they are compelled 
to meet contumely and strife in the 
world, they possets the pearl of 
great price. They, too, stand upon 
Mount Zion, publishing peace and 
good tidings, and bringing joy to. 
the inhabitants of the earth. Whilst 
great men are condemning the 
creeds of men, and stating the ne- 
cessity of a new gospel, and that 
such new gospel should be without 
the dogmas of men, we know that 
the Gospel we preach, which we 
have received, is from the Lord, it 
has His authority, it is not what 
men have brought down from the 
dead past, but that it is character- 
ized by newness of life, revealed 
from God in our own day, dealing 
with the past, present and future. 
Had President Eliot and others who 
find fault with existing religions, 
investigated "Mormonism," they 
could not have claimed the neces- 
sity of greater light, of greater 
truth, of greater freedom, than that 
which characterizes the religion of 
the Latter-day Saints. Christian 
men and women can not find in any 
one of the other churches all of that 
which they recognize as the religion 
of Christ. Feeling narrowed with- 
in the confines of the creeds, they 
have tried to find outside of their 
churches the fullness of the Gospel 
of Jesus. They are debating such 
matters as this in their colleges, 
such a one as I read some time 
ago at Stanford University, Cali- 



ELDER JOSEPH E. ROBINSON.

fornia : "Resolved, that a new re- 
ligion suited for all men and all 
times should be brought forth to 
meet the intellectual conditions of 
each nation, and to meet the re- 
quirements of all people, and of all 
kindreds of the earth." They are 
running to and fro for the word of 
God. I trust some shall find it. 
They recognize the fact that there 
is a famine in the land, "not a 
famine for bread nor a thirst for 
water," but for the truth. 

Is it not a glorious thought, my 
brethren and sisters, and something 
to be most thankful for, that we 
have in our possession this very 
thing that the learned and the wise 
and the mighty of the earth are 
seeking for? Is it not a consolation 
to know that this Gospel ( good 
news, it means) answers every call 
of the human mind, responds to 
every emotion of the human soul, 
and answers fully and completely 
every requirement of intelligence 
and reason? There is a philosophy 
and a logic in it that appeals to the 
minds of men that cannot be con- 
troverted or contradicted. This 
Gospel which we preach, when they 
hear it or when they read it, and 
especially when they live it, has that 
quality that gives something more 
than a passive belief in some code 
of morals, it means more than a 
belief in the written word of God, 
for the letter killeth, the spirit is 
necessary to give it. life. Men can 
see and feel that our faith is bright- 
er, more perfect and heavenly than 
the churches or religions they have 
been acquainted with in the world. 
They can see, when they find it, 
that faith is an incentive to all in- 
telligent action, that it is necessary 
for men and women to render that 
which is just and true to them- 
selves, to their own families, to tht 



citizens of our commonwealth and 
to God. Faith has prompted every 
great man in the world. It, was 
faith in the theory that the world 
was round that gave courage and 
inspiration to Columbus, when he 
steered his vessels into the rays of 
the western sun and discovered a 
new world. It was faith that led 
Watts and Stephenson in the line of 
work they respectively followed, 
that evolved the locomotive and en- 
gine of today. It was faith that 
led Franklin into the field with kite 
and key, and it is faith that is over- 
coming that which seemed a few 
years ago to be impossible, the dif- 
ficulties in aerial navigation, so that 
machines heavier than air are fly- 
ing, as Isaiah said, "like a cloud and 
as doves to their windows." 

When they see and appreciate all 
this, they can see how logical is the 
principle maintained by the Latter- 
day Saints as a part of revealed re- 
ligion, of the natural and rational 
law of the Gospel, that faith is the 
great first principle of revealed 
truth. No wonder, my brethren 
and sisters, that the Prophet Joseph 
Smith, under the inspiration of Al- 
mighty God, said that "faith is the 
foundation of all revealed religion." 
You will remember, perhaps, that 
some of the leading churches con- 
tend still that faith follows repent- 
ance, and that repentance is the first 
awakening of religious thought or 
belief. We had this contention not 
long since with a doctor of divin- 
ity, who was speaking to the peo- 
ple of San Diego about us and the 
tenets of Mormonism. So some of 
these men, who seem to know all 
about us, have not learned this one 
principle yet, that faith is the 
foundation truth of all intelligent 
thought and action, and that re- 
pentance comes as a natural sc

quence to it, and is true develop- 
ment and true education. All men 
have made mistakes, and all suc- 
cessful men have repented and 
turned from them ; they have turned 
to a better theory, to a better plan. 
The housewife exercises faith in 
her household duties; for instance: 
in making bread, she knows that 
the proper ingredients will pro- 
duce the proper and desired re- 
sult ; and if she makes a mistake in 
it, she repents of it, and then she 
sees that her bread is more care- 
fully and more perfectly prepared. 
So that faith, you see, is used in 
the smallest as well as in the great- 
est things in life. If a banker, or a 
railroad magnate, makes a mistake, 
he repents of it, and sees that it 
does not occur again. So we might 
go on, and show that repentance is 
necessary in the development, and 
intelligent action, and operation of 
all things, and is the handmaid of 
faith, going hand in hand with it. 

It is most gratifying to know 
that we have this divine type of a 
message, this eternal character of 
a Gospel to preach. We have no 
apologies to make for it ; we preach 
the Gospel of Jesus Christ, His 
message which, if men will receive 
it in their hearts, they shall be 
thereby prepared for the advent of 
the Son of Man when He comes 
to earth to reign as King of kings 
and Lord of lords. 

May the Father grant that this 
time shall not be far away, but that 
we shall do well our part, that the 
coming of the Son of Man may be 
hastened, and the time soon arrive 
when men shall study war no more, 
that every man shall render that 
which is just and true to all his fel- 
lows, come into God's peace, and be 
able to say, as did our Prophet and 
Seer, the martyred President of our 



Church, "My conscience is void of 
offense towards God and all men." 
In possession of this peace we shall 
be "as calm as a summer's morn- 
ing." May God bless you, my 
brethren and sisters, and give us of 
His Spirit, to know, to feel, and to 
live these Gospel truths, is my 
prayer, in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

The choir sang the anthem, "Our 
God Shall be Glorified." 

Benediction was pronounced by 
Elder Andrew G. Bowman. 



OUTDOOR MEETING. 

To gratify the multitude unable 
to find sitting or standing room in 
the Tabernacle, or Assembly Hall, 
an outdoor meeting was held, at 2 
p. m., in front of the Bureau of In- 
formation building. Elder Benja- 
min Goddard presided. Oscar 
Kirkman conducted the singing, 
and William C. Clive played violin 
accompaniments. 

The congregation sang the hymn r 
"High on the Mountain Top." 

Prayer was offered by Elder 
George Shorten. 

Prof. Wm. C. Clive rendered a 
violin solo. 



ELDER BENJAMIN GODDAED. 

We are glad to meet you, my 
brothers, sisters, and friends, in this 
gathering, realizing that you are un- 
able to obtain entrance to the Tab- 
ernacle or the Assembly Hall, and 
that you are so desirous of learning 
something with regard to the work 
in which we are all interested, that 
you are willing to come to this open

air gathering and remain standing, 
until the close. 

In the official position J now oc- 
cupy upon this block, every day in 
the year, I am asked questions with 
regard to Mormonism. The words 
of the prophets have been literally 
fulfilled, as indicated in the hymn 
that you have just sung: 

"High on the mountain top 

A banner is unfurled ; 
Ye nations now look up, 

It waves to all the world. 
In Deseret's sweet peaceful land — 
On Zion's mount behold it stand!" 

I think sometimes we ought to 
read the words of our hymns as 
well as sing them, and understand 
how forcible they are with regard 
to the Latter-day work. At times 
we give too much attention to the 
music and too little to the spirit 
of the song, and I am therefore go- 
ing to read, perhaps as an inspira- 
tion unto those who may follow, 
the next few lines. 

"For God remembers still 

His promise made of old, 
That He on Zion's hill 

Truth's standard would unfold; 
Her light should there attract the gaze 
Of all the world in latter days. 

"His house shall there be rear'd, 

His glory to display; 
And people shall be heard 

In distant lands to say, 
We'll now go up and serve the Lord, 
Obey His truth, and learn His word." 

The truth of the words that I 
read can be testified to by many 
who now stand before me. Many 
of you have come from foreign 
lands. Your presence here indicates 
the fulfillment of this prophecy; 
and, as I stated before, upon this 
block, within the vicinity in which 
you are now standing, thousands 



of people come from every nation, 
kindred, tongue, and people, to 
learn what Mormonism means. To 
the strangers that come amongst us, 
we declare that Mormonism means 
the salvation of the human family. 
Mormonism has a message to the 
world, that message having been 
introduced by the direct ministra- 
tion of the Father and the Son, re- 
peated through the ministrations of 
the Angel Moroni, (whose fig- 
ure is upon the summit of our Tem- 
ple), who revealed the sacred rec- 
ord, the Book of Mormon, from 
which we teach, together with the 
Bible, the word of God. And, furth- 
er, we declare that Mormonism is 
the revealed truth of the Almighty, 
given through a prophet in the lat- 
ter days, that prophet having been 
ministered unto by resurrected be- 
ings : John the Baptist having come 
unto him and clothed him with the 
power of the Aaronic Priesthood; 
and Peter, James, and John having 
appeared unto him and given unto 
him the authority of the Melchis- 
edek Priesthood ; and these reve- 
lations of God, (the Doctrine and 
Covenants) we present unto the 
world as another sacred volume, 
which we commend as worthy of 
consideration. We therefore have 
before us today, the word of God 
contained in the Bible (for "we be- 
lieve the Bible to be the word of 
God"), and the Book of Mormon, 
which we believe also to be the word 
of God : ancient scriptures treating 
of God's dealings with His people 
upon the Eastern continent, and al- 
so upon the Western continent ; and 
we declare that we have now the 
living orades amongst us ; and rev- 
elations given through the Prophet 
Joseph Smith, equally binding, 
equally sacred, equally divine. We 
commend unto the world these sa-

cred volumes. I trust that the breth- 
ren will have your attention, and 
that God will bless us in this open 
air gathering equally with those 
who have been privileged to meet 
in the Tabernacle and the Assem- 
bly Hall ; and may the Spirit of the 
Lord fill your hearts, and interpret 
unto you every truth that is uttered, 
I ask in the name of Jesus. Amen. 



ELDEK SAMUEL 0. BENNION. 

(President of Central States Mis- 
sion). 

My brothers and sisters and 
friends, I can say that I am pleased 
to have this opportunity of address- 
ing you a short time this afternoon, 
and I trust that while I occupy this 
position, I may be aided by the Spir- 
it of the Lord, and that you will 
assist me by your faith ani prayers. 
I am pleased to see so many peo- 
ple out here to this open air meet- 
ing. I have never had the priv- 
ilege of attending an open air meet- 
ing in this city before, although I 
understand such meetings have been 
held during several conferences. It 
is an indication of the growth and 
development of the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 
which has been going steadily on 
ever since the appearance of God 
the eternal Father and His Son 
Jesus Christ to the boy prophet 
some eighty odd years ago. , 

The Latter-day Saints have been 
taking great interest in the salva- 
tion of the souls of men, having 
received the testimony that Joseph 
the prophet received through the 
visitation of the Father and the Son. 
And it has come unto you and unto 
me with such force that we have 
rejoiced at the privilege of preach- 
ing it unto the children of men, both 



at home and abroad. It has become 
a knowledge with us, and we know 
absolutely that God lives, that Mor- 
monism is true, that Joseph Smith 
was a prophet of, God, and that He 
has His authority upon the earth in 
this day in which we live, and that 
the Gospel of Jesus Christ is in full 
force and effect for my benefit and 
for yours. By the piinciples which 
God, the eternal Father, has estab- 
lished, you and I may gain an exal- 
tation in His kingdom, where He 
and His Son dwell. We know it 
so well that it has become a part of 
our lives. 

I was very much impressed this 
morning with the remarks of Presi- 
dent Joseph F. Smith, a prophet of 
the living God, who declared unto 
Israel today that the work of God 
in the world is here to stay; that 
there are men who have the author- 
ity to preach it upon the face of 
the earth, and that there is nothing 
that can stop the Almighty from 
revealing His principles unto the 
children of men. 

Christ, the Lord, while He was 
upon the earth, said, "My doctrine 
is not mine, but His that sent me." 
This doctrine, the doctrine which 
we call "Mormonism," does not be- 
long to the people: it is God's law. 
He has established it upon the earth. 
It is His system by which you and 
I may gain an exaltation in His 
kingdom, using the agency that God 
gave us when He created us and 
sent us forth in the world, that we 
might use this agencv to receive or 
to reject, to acknowledge, or not 
to acknowledge, his goodness in all 
things. 

To me it is the greatest thing that 
could come into my life to know 
that the Gospel is in full force and 
effect here upon the earth, and that 
a man does not have to spend his 



ELDER SAMUEL 0. BENNION. 



51 



time and his life and accomplish 
nothing; that he will not have to 
go back into the eternities bank- 
rupt, but that he can go back there 
into a house filled with treasures, 
where nothing can take them from 
him, and where the experience that 
he has earned in this life will be of 
assistance to him in the life to come. 
When we think of the millions of 
people that have passed from the 
earth, that have not had a knowledge 
of the Gospel we recognize that there 
is plenty for the missionaries to do 
after they leave this stage of proba- 
tion. The Gospel has to be preached 
unto every creature. Joseph the 
prophet gave .us to understand that 
no man could be saved in ignorance, 
and whether in life or in death, this 
system, this law, these ordinances 
of the Gospel, will have to be giv- 
en unto the children of men. Christ 
opened the way, liberated the cap- 
tives that lived in the days of No- 
ah. Peter testified that this was the 
case, that the Gospel was preached 
to the dead that they might "live ac- 
cording to God in the spirit, but be 
judged according to man in the 
flesh ;" for a man must obey the 
principles and doctrines of Christ. 
He has given us to understand that 
"every knee shall bow, and every 
tongue confess that Jesus is the 
Christ." 

While the Savior was upon the 
earth, He said to His apostles, "Go 
ye into all the world, and preach 
the Gospel unto every creature : he 
that believeth and is baptized shall 
be saved, but he that believeth not 
shall be damned; and these signs 
shall follow them that believe : in 
my name shall they cast out devils, 
they shall speak with new tongues, 
they shall take up serpents, and if 
they drink any deadly thing, it shall 
not hurt them. They shall lay hands 



on the sick, and they shall recover.'' 
These are the words of Jesus Christ, 
who opened up the Gospel dispen- 
sation in His days, and brought 
light into the world. And who has 
the right to change an ordinance of 
the Gospel? What man under the 
sun has the right to say that the 
signs shall not follow the true be- 
liever when Christ plainly said that 
they would? I want to say unto 
}0U that no man has a right to 
change it, and that the principle up- 
on which the Lord said that He 
would build His Church when He 
was talking to Peter — that of reve- 
lation — is in full force and effect 
here upon the earth. We have men 
who are appointed and chosen by 
God to represent Him here in the 
earth ; and this knowledge can come 
unto you and to me, and unto every 
individual under the son ; for He that 
said "My doctrine is not mine, but 
His that sent me" also said, "If any 
man will do His will, he shall know 
of the doctrine." If any man will 
put Him to the test ; if any man will 
search the scriptures, as Christ, the 
Lord, said for him to do. he may 
know absolutely that this is the 
work of the Lord; that the angel 
which John the Revelator saw, has 
flown again through the midst of 
the heavens, and that the Gospel is 
here. 

I am thankful that I have had the 
privilege of going into the world 
and declaring unto the children of 
men that I know this to be the truth, 
for I want to tell you, brothers and 
sisters, that there are millions upon 
millions of people in the world to- 
day that are honest in their hearts, 
that have been led astray by the 
cunning craftiness of men. They 
do not know what the Lord requires 
of them ; and when you look into 
their faces, and know, as surely as 



52 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



you stand there, that they are hon- 
orable men and women, it gives you 
joy and satisfaction, and it is a priv- 
ilege to open the way for them. It 
is not our doctrine, it is not our 
Gospel, but it is the word of the 
Lord unto His children on the 
earth, that they should obey His 
commandments ; that they should go 
.down into the waters of baptism; 
that they should obey His laws, just 
as He said they should be obeyed ; 
and no one has the right to change 
them. 

The result of all this missionary 
work is that thousands of people 
every year are going down into the 
waters of baptism, having listened 
to some humble Elder as he stood 
perhaps upon the streets of some 
city, without purse or scrip, a 
stranger in a strange land, with the 
Lord inspiring him, testifying, 
preaching the Gospel of the risen 
Redeemer. Hundreds of people 
have heard these Mormon Elders 
speak. As I look upon this congre- 
gation this afternoon, I see faces 
that I know, faces of men who have 
borne the testimony which they have 
received unto the children of men 
in foreign lands. Many have been 
brought to a knowledge of the 
truth, and to the world, the strange 
thing about it is this : that just as 
soon as a member of a family em- 
braces Mormonism, he or she wants 
their whole family to accept it. 
Every convert becomes a missionary 
in the world, because they know 
positively that there is salvation for 
them in the doctrines taught by the 
Latter-day Saints. They know 
this, and they cannot deny it, and if 
a wife first embraces it — for quite 
frequently a wife joins the Church 
before the husband does, — she nev- 
er rests until she has converted her 
husband. Then she starts with her 



family : she starts with her moth- 
er, or with some of her friends, or 
invites the Elders to help her, nev- 
er relenting until she has accom- 
plished her purpose. 

The work of the Lord is growing. 
The work is not like it was in the 
early history of the Church. In 
every county, or at least in every 
state of the Union, and especially 
in the Central States Mission, we 
have bodies of Latter-day Saints or- 
ganized into branches, building up 
the Church of Christ ; and people 
around them are becoming ac- 
quainted with the principles of the 
Gospel that have been sent out from 
the tops of these mountains by 
those who have faith in God. 

I want to say to the young men 
in Israel : take care of your means, 
that you may have the privilege 
of going into the world and preach- 
ing the Gospel; that you may not 
be curtailed for lack of funds : that 
you may go there and bear unto 
the children of men your testimony, 
and show them by scripture and by 
example that you know absolutely 
that this is the work of the Lord. 
I think that no apostate can ever say 
that he knew that he was wrong. 
Apostates say they know absolutely 
that the Gospel is right, that it is 
the Church that has gone astray. 
A man who had apostatized told 
me upon one occasion that he had 
joined other churches, a good many 
of them, but he never saw a peace- 
ful day. His mind was never in a 
situation of contentment until he 
had got back into the Church again. 
He never could deny what he had 
received. The Gospel is so simple, 
and so plain that we cannot help 
but understand it. 

This privilege of coming up here 
to attend the conferences is an in- 
spiration to the Latter-day Saints. 



ELDER JOHN L. HERRICK. 



53 



It helps you and me in our faith : it 
strengthens us. I wish to repeat 
again that I enjoyed the remarks 
made by the President of our 
Church this morning, and I wish 
that the Latter-day Saints would 
read them, and that they would give 
them to their friends, and that our 
newspapers would print them just 
as he spoke them, that they might 
go out into the world, for they were 
the words of the Lord unto this 
people. That is the way He speaks 
— by His servants, the prophets. 

My brothers and sisters, I do not 
care to speak longer to you this af- 
ternoon, except that I with to say, 
in conclusion, that your sons and 
your daughters in the mission field, 
so far as I am able to find out in 
the Cehtral States Mission — and I 
am traveling nearly all the time — 
are enjoying themselves and their 
work, and are meeting the people 
upon the street corners, in their 
work-shops, and in their homes. 

We have four Elders, in one of 
the cities, who are meeting with the 
men who work in one of the great 
railway company's workshops. 
Every day, at twenty minutes past 
twelve, they preach to those men — 
something like three hundred of 
them — until one o'clock. They are 
making friends everywhere. 

Write unto your sons and unto 
your daughters words of encour- 
agement. Preach the Gospel unto 
them when you write them letters, 
and do not write them anything that 
will disturb their minds. There is 
no question but that we pray for 
the Elders of Israel, thousands of 
us every night; but not only in 
your prayers, but when you write 
them letters, fill them with inspira- 
tion, that the Elders may become 
strengthened, and that there may be 
nothing in a letter that will detract 



from an Elder's labors. I ask the 
Lord to bless all Israel, in the name 
of Jesus, Amen. 



ELDER JOHN L. HERRICK. 

(President of Northwestern States 
Mission). 

I read from Section 68 of the 
Doctrine and Covenants, "And 
again, inasmuch as parents have 
children in Zion, or in any of her 
stakes which are organized, that 
teach them not to understand the 
doctrine of repentance, faith in 
Christ, the Son of the living God, 
and of baptism, and the gift of the 
Holy Ghost by the laying on of 
hands when eight years old, the sin 
be upon the heads of the parents ; 
for this shall be a law unto the in- 
habitants of Zion, or in any of her 
stakes which are organized." 

One of the keynotes given to the 
great audience assembled in the Tab- 
ernacle this morning, by President 
Smith, was that the parents of chil- 
dren throughout the Church should 
give heed to them, should give more 
attention to their sons and daugh- 
ters, and should see to it that they 
are guarded and directed aright. In 
the mission field we meet with so 
many classes of people, that the 
questions are involuntarily forced 
upon us time and time again : 
"What is our duty to those who are 
in the world?" and, "Who are we 
to consider our neighbor?" 

It seems to me that this revela- 
tion which was given in our day for 
the guidance and direction of this 
people meant that our children 
should not be properly trained sim- 
oly for our own good or for our 
immediate neighbor's good ; but that 
they might be examples abroad 



54 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



wherever they went in whatever 
city or county, or state or nation. 
And so I say to you, my brothers 
and sisters, that this question of 
our neighbor is a very serious one 
for us to consider, because this work 
is broad. It comprehends all truth. 
We cannot afford to be narrow and 
contracted in our views, for our 
work and our duty extends to every 
one in the world who is in need of 
light, and who is seeking the truth 
pertaining to the salvation of the 
human family. 

Christ told His followers upon 
one occasion, that at the last day 
it would be said to certain people, 
"Come, ye blessed of my Father, in- 
herit the kingdom prepared for you 
from the foundation of the world : 
For I was an hungered, and ye gave 
me meat : I was thirsty, and ye gave 
me drink: I was a stranger, and 
ye took me in; naked, and ye 
clothed me. * * * " And the 
people would wonder at this be- 
cause they could not remember any 
particular time they had given Him 
such entertainment; and so they 
would say to Him, "When saw we 
Thee an hungered, and fed Thee? 
or thirsty, and gave Thee drink? 
when saw we Thee a stranger, and 
took Thee in? or naked, and 
clothed Thee?" And He would 
say, "Inasmuch as ye have done it 
unto the least of these, My breth- 
ren, ye have done it unto Me." 

That is the spirit of this work. 
It means that it must go to all the 
world, to every man, woman, and 
child; that everyone must have a 
chance to hear this great plan of 
salvation. So our duty is not to 
our individual neighbor, to him that 
lives next door to us, but we are 
held responsible if our children go 
into another city, and come in con-. 
tact with other people, and do not 



set them proper examples. I think 
we shall be held accountable, just 
as this scripture says, if we do not 
provide them the means and the 
ways, and do not set them proper 
examples. Condemnation will 
come upon us if we fail in this mat- 
ter. 

[Quoting again from the Doc- 
trine and Covenants :] "Now, I the 
Lord, am not well pleased with the 
inhabitants of Zion, for there are 
idlers among them ; and their chil- 
dren are also growing up in wick- 
edness ; and they also seek not earn- 
estly the riches of eternity, but their 
eyes are full of greediness." 

So, if our young men, and our 
young women go to the neighbor- 
ing towns, to the neighboring coun- 
ty, or state, or wherever they go, 
and carry not this spirit, this in- 
spiration of the Gospel with them, 
condemnation will rest upon us, 
their parents. 

A few months ago, I read of a 
sad event which happened in this 
city, which very much impressed 
me at the time. I do not think I 
shall forget it. A man who was 
very popular here, both in a busi- 
ness and a political way a few years 
ago, was led into temptation, and 
he became a defaulter in the bank 
with which he was connected. He 
was sentenced to a term of impris- 
onment, and had served quite a 
number of years of his time, but 
had a longer time to serve, when 
an outbreak occurred in the peniten- 
tiary. It seemed that a general jail, 
outbreak was planned, and that the 
execution of it would have been 
carried out had it not been for the 
prompt action of this man. He 
took it into his head to hide the 
keys from the jailbreakers and did 
so. Then he hid himself; but it 
was soon discovered that he was the 



ELDER JOHN L. HERRICK. 



55 



man that had frustrated the plan 
of the desperadoes. So when the 
matter was brought before the 
Board of Pardons of this state, it 
was thought well to release him, to 
give him his freedom, because he 
had earned it. 

This man began here, among the 
people who knew of his disgrace, 
among those who knew thiat he 
had defaulted from his bank, 
among those who knew that he 
had worn the prison garb, to start 
out among neighbors and friends, 
to make over his life, to live it anew. 
A great number of difficulties and 
trials and tribulations came in his 
way, and he was about to give up, 
and yet he thought, "I want to suc- 
ceed here, and show these people 
that I am a man." So he kept on 
in this line of thought and action. 
But one day, as he was passing 
along the street, and as he turned 
a corner, two men who stood there 
were heard to remark, one of them 
to the other, "There goes an ex- 
convict: there goes ;" he said 

it loud enough for the unfortunate 
man to hear, and he was crushed 
beyond endurance. He had borne 
many indignities that had been 
heaped upon him by those who were 
opposite to him in business; but 
this was the final blow. .On the 
way to his office he purchased a 
revolver ; as he entered he said, "If 
anyone calls for me, say that I am 
not in." Then he stepped into an- 
other room, and in a moment the 
report of a gun was heard. The 
poor fellow had blown out his 
brains. He left a letter to his in- 
timate friends, in which he said, 
"My competitors would not let me 
live. They were jealous of me be- 
cause I was trying to make a name 
fcr myself and live down my shame. 
They would not let me live." 



I say to you, my friends, that that 
man's death is chargeable to some 
individual in this world. I believe 
also that we are chargeable, we are 
accountable, for what we do and 
say, no matter who is our neighbor. 
Everyone who is in trouble, who is 
in distress, who needs our help, is 
cur neighbor; not our own family, 
not only those whom we mingle 
with from day to day, but every 
man and woman who is in distress 
in this world. 

The words of one of the poets 
come to my mind in this connection, 
and I will try and repeat a few stan- 
zas to you. 

"Some there are who seek 'twixt cov- 
ers 

For their knowledge of mankind. 
In whatever each discovers 

May he satisfaction find ; 
But for me no book is needed, 

As I ponder day by day 
On the humor and the oathos 

In the flats across the way. 

"Mornings, as the children sally, 

And a goodly score appear, 
Forth to school or mimic warfare, 

Boyhood's fancies reappear. 
Life is short, and time is fleeting, 

I repeat, as day by day, 
Children change to youths and maid- 
ens 

In the flats across the way. 

"From a window just above me 

Oft there leans a maiden fair, 
Playing with her favored canine, 

Tall is she, with golden hair. 
I'll admit my heart, distracted, 

Grows with envy day by day, 
As she clasps that brindled bull pup, 

In the flats across the way. 

"Just across the nice young couple 

Have been sent a son and heir, 
But the way they treat that baby 

Sets on end my every hair. 
My conviction, though unpleasant, 

Grows more certain day by day 
That they'll kill that "kid" with kind- 
ness 

In the flats across the way.

Once a thought there came to me, 
For it straight imposed upon me 

Great responsibility; 
For this thought, and 'tis a true one, 

Guides my action day by day, 
To those opposite I'm living, 

In the flats across the way." 

And so I say to you, my brothers 
and sisters, we are living to those 
who are looking upon our acts 
every day, every hour, and every 
minute of our lives, and we should 
be cautious in every act, thought, 
and deed, no matter where we are. 
God grant that His blessing may be 
with you, that He may lead you 
aright in the paths of truth and 
righteousness, is my humble desire, 
in the name of Jesus, Amen. 

The hymn, "I know that my Re- 
deemer lives," was rendered as a 
solo, by Elder Oscar Kirkham. 



ELDER CHARLES H. HART. 

We are informed by the poet 
that "the groves were God's first 
temples." We are enjoying the 
privilege of standing under the 
shade of trees upon this historic 
square this afternoon, and listening 
to the music and the instructions of 
the Elders. 

My mind was impressed this 
morning with that part of the re- 
marks of President Smith concern- 
ing the responsibility we are under 
of saving souls. At the A. Y. P. 
Exposition at Seattle, in the Alas- 



kan building there is a glass cage, 
surrounded by very strong iron 
bars. There is a treasure within 
that glass house that attracts the at- 
tention of passers-by at all hours of 
the day. They stand about the glass 
cage, longingly looking in upon the 
golden treasure, the gold bricks, and 
the gold nuggets within; but if all 
of those golden treasures were mul- 
tiplied a thousand times, they would 
not equal the value of a human soul. 
In visiting Arizona a few months 
ago, I was told the story of the 
search for the body of a man who 
was supposed to have been drowned 
in the Little Colorado River. His 
friends and neighbors turned out 
and searched day by day in those 
turbid waters to recover the re- 
mains, but without success up to 
the time of my visit. Just before 
that I was in Summit County, and 
■ heard narrated the search for a 
poor old lady, who, in her declining 
years, had wandered off in the 
snows of winter, and the search was 
going on for her body, for it was 
believed that shortly after sTie had 
been out in the snow and the cold 
she had perished. The search went 
on day after day in a systematic 
manner. Horsemen rode a few 
rods apart so that they might know 
that every rod had been carefully 
searched. And so the hunt went on 
from day to day ; not in the hope of 
saving a human soul, but simply to 
administer to the comfort of loved 
ones in recovering the body. A 
year or two ago a half dozen of my 
friends and associates went into a 
steam launch upon the Bear River, 
and as they were gliding swiftly, at 
the twilight of a summer's day, sud- 
denly the boat struck a submerged 
pile, and they were precipitated into 
the water, and two of them, the best 
swimmers, never reached the shore

alive. In Logan the stores were 
closed; men in all vocations went 
from that town, from Smithfield, 
from Newton, Clarkston — went in 
large numbers, and dragged the 
river. Expert divers were sum- 
moned from a distance of a hundred 
miles to dive in the water to recover 
the bodies. Every known means 
of dragging the stream was put into 
effect. When darkness prevented 
the search to advantage, men rolled 
themselves in their blankets near 
the stream, in order to be at hand 
when daylight should come ; and so 
the search went on day after day. 
I remember after the lapse of a day 
or two, the bishop of Wellsville tel- 
ephoned to me to know if the bodies 
had been found, and he concluded 
by saying, "Wellsville stands ready 
to send one hundred men, if neces- 
sary, to participate in the search." 
Not for the purpose, I say. of sav- 
ing a human soul, or even of sav- 
ing life, because life, of course, was 
long since extinct; but for the pur- 
pose, merely, of recovering the ten- 
aments of clay, to minister to the 
sentiment of their friends in giving 
them a Christian burial, instead of 
having the bodies remain in a wat- 
ery grave. If we will make that 
sort of an effort, my friends, in or- 
der to recover mere bodies, mere 
tenaments of clay, what snould we 
do when a human life, or a human 
soul is in peril ? What price can we 
place upon a human soul ? The 
Psalmist has given us some words 
bearing on that question. "They 
that trust in their wealth, and boast 
themselves in the multitude of their 
riches; none of them can by any 
means redeem his brother, nor give 
God a ransom for him." 

The Savior has also given us 
some idea of the value of a soul 
when He says, "For what shall it 



profit a man if he shall gain the 
whole world and lose his own soul?" 
I once saw a young man shortly 
after a drowning, in which he had 
endeavored to save those who had 
perished, and, as the tears streamed 
down his cheeks, the thought that 
was uppermost in his mind was 
whether he had done the very best 
he could to save his drowning com- 
panions. It was true that nothing 
had been left undone by him, but 
in his anxiety as to whether he had 
fulfilled his full duty that thought 
was uppermost in his mind. As I 
understand it, there is a responsibil- 
ity upon each one of us in reference 
to the welfare of his fellow man. 
Ezekiel, in the third chapter, dis- 
cusses the question in this way : 

"Son of man, 1 have made thee a 
watchman unto the House of Israel : 
therefore hear the word at my mouth, 
and give them warning from me. When I 
say unto the wicked, 'Thou shalt surely 
die; and thou givest him not warning 
nor speakest to warn the w ; cked from 
his wicked way, to save his life; the 
same wicked man shall die in his in- 
iquity; but his blood will I require at 
thine hand. Yet if thou warn the 
wicked, and he turn not from his 
wickedness, nor from his wicked way, 
he shall die in his iniquity; but thou 
hast delivered thy soul. Again, when 
a righteous man doth turn from his 
righteousness, and commit iniquity, 
and I lay a stumbling block before 
him. he shall die; because thou hast 
not given him warning, he shall die in 
his sin, and his righteousness which 
he hath done shall not be remem- 
bered; but his blood will I require at 
thine hand. Nevertheless, if thou 
warn the righteous man, that the 
righteous sin not, and he doth not sin, 
he shall surely live, because he is 
warned; also thou hast delivered thy 
soul." 

So that here is a duty, not only 
to warn those who are in sin, but 
also to warn the righteous who may 
wander into sin, for we know full

well that though a man today may 
be justified through the grace of 
Jesus Christ, his salvation is not 
sure, and he may fall from grace. 
Although he may be classified as a 
righteous man, still he may fall. 
And there may be a responsibility 
upon someone within warning dis- 
tance of him for not warning him 
of some false step that he has taken, 
some by and forbidden path that he 
has entered upon. 

It is the sense of this responsibil- 
ity that enables these missionaries, 
these with whom I have the honor 
of speaking this afternoon, to re- 
main abroad, as they do, for so 
many long years, gratuitously giving 
the best years of their lives in order 
to warn others. Brother Ellsworth 
who shall follow me, has been out, 
I suppose, some eight or ten years 
now. Brother Bennion has been in 
the missionary field for a number 
of years and Brother Herrick is 
just entering upon what will prob- 
ably be a long missionary career 
for him. They do it gratuitously, 
and for the love they have for their 
fellow-men, to discharge this re- 
sponsibility; for they know that a 
soul is precious in the sight of God ; 
that Mormonism is the science and 
art of life, and that it will have a 
saving effect upon those who will 
give heed to its teachings, just in 
proportion as they understand that 
great system of truth, and will put 
it into practice and into effect in 
their lives. 

It is on account of a realization 
of the sense of the impoitance of 
saving souls that there is such joy 
at the return of the prodigal. I 
confess that I do not like to hear the 
story of the prodigal son presented 
with a view of impressing, perhaps, 
a license to sow wild oats, or any- 
thing of that sort, but I like to hear 



it presented for the forgiveness 
manifested by the father in taking 
back to him his wayward son. 

I was impressed the other day 
with the thought of an aged sister 
who was about to make her will. 
She had forgotten at first that there 
was an additional consideration due 
one of her children, the wayward 
■-on. She said, "You know he and 
his father had some friction, and he 
wandered away from home, and it 
is my desire, if I can, to make up 
to him, in a small way, by showing 
a greater interest in him than in 
the other children." 

It was a realization of this prin- 
ciple of saving souls that gave joy 
to the shepherd in the parable of 
the lost sheep, in leaving the ninety 
and nine that were safe, and going 
after the one lost sheep, and in 
bringing it safely within the fold. 
I feel that the words of President 
Smith this morning were timely, 
and of great, importance to us all, 
of doing all we can for the salva- 
tion, first of those of our own house- 
hold, and then of all mankind. 

May the Lord bless us, and en- 
able us to put into practice these 
principles of warning and saving 
others, doing our full duty to them, 
that we may not stand under con- 
demnation, neither as to our chil- 
dren, nor as to our Father's chil- 
dren in general. May the Lord 
bless us and help us to endure true 
'and faithful to the end, I ask in the 
name of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER GERMAN E. ELLSWORTH 

(President of Northern States Mis- 
sion). 

I rejoice in meeting you. I know 
you have gathered here, each and 
every one of you, to receive light, 
and to be encouraged in the princi- 



ELDER G. E. ELLSWORTH.

pies of the Gospel that you have es- 
poused ; and as you have come seek- 
ing, so ye shall go away filled. 

I enjoyed the spirit of our ser- 
vices this morning, and I have en- 
joyed the spirit of the service this 
afternoon. The song that: was just 
rendered by Elder Kirkhain ever in- 
spires me. It arouses within me 
a feeling, a knowledge of God and 
His works, that is impossible for me 
to express, for I know that my 
Redeemer lives. This %iorning I 
was thrilled in every fibre of my be- 
ing while listening to the prophet 
of the Lord. I was reminded of 
the song, 

"Come, listen to a prophet's voice 
And hear the word of God, 

And in the way of truth rejoice, 
And sing for joy aloud." 

How many of us will listen to the 
voice of the prophet of God and go 
home singing and rejoicing because 
of the teachings that he has given 
us this day concerning our duty to 
ourselves and our children? 

I am proud, my brothers and sis- 
ters, to feel that I am representing 
the Northern States and the mis- 
sionaries laboring there. I have en- 
joyed every minute of the time I 
have been in that part of the world, 
because of the association I have 
with so many men and women who 
love the Lord — men and women 
who are strugging to keep the com- 
mandments of the Lord and magni- 
fy His holy name in their walks and 
conversations among the people. It 
has been my privilege to labor with 
about eight hundred Elders and a 
dozen lady missionaries in that mis- 
sion. Out of that eight hundred, 
we have had only one man go astray 
so far, in the field, as to lose the 
spirit of his calling. We think this 
a wonderful record compared with 



hundreds of big men of the world, 
who confess the looseness of their 
morals both before and after mar- 
riage. 

We have a most sacred duty to 
discharge to the children who have 
been given to us by our Father in 
heaven. They are an heritage from 
the Lord, and we have b. j en given 
the privilege of being their fathers 
in the flesh. The scriptures say that 
we correct them and they give us 
reverence. I wonder if all the Lat- 
ter-day Saints correct their children 
and their children give them rever- 
ence, so that they are growing up to 
be worthy sons and worthy daugh- 
ters of our Father in heaven, able 
to stand before the world pure and 
clean and nobly represent His cause. 
Upon that principle alone we ought 
to be, and will be, if we can re- 
main true to our covenants, the salt 
of the earth ; for there are no people 
living upon the earth today who 
have made more sacred covenants 
concerning their virtuous actions 
than have the Latter-day Saints, 
and none ought to be more clean 
and pure. I am very proud of the 
young men who have been sent to 
th.e Northern States Mission. They 
may have neglected their opportu- 
nities for education ; they may not 
have reverenced the name of Deity, 
as they should ; they may have neg- 
lected to give honor to their par- 
ents, but they have listened to the 
promptings of the Spirit pnd given 
sufficient heed to parents that they 
are clean and pure before God con- 
cerning their morality. And when 
the Spirit of God fires the souls of 
such men it is life giving to the 
people who listen to them, and the 
heads of thousands are bowed be- 
cause of the virtue of t^e young 
men and women of Zion. 

We sing and pray, and thank 



60 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



God every day of our lives for a 
prophet to guide us ; we thank Him 
for the Gospel to enlighten our 
minds, and I think, my brethren and 
sisters, that we ought to take seri- 
ously the warning concerning our 
children, and concerning our own 
lives. We ought never to forget 
with what a pleading voice our 
President declared that be would 
sooner bury his children or die him- 
self, and be taken to the cemetery 
than to have them lose their virtue 
or lose their testimony, and wander 
away from the truth that God has 
given him and enabled him thus far 
to teach his children. 

How many of you, my brothers 
and sisters, have sought in kind- 
ness and in love to so teach your 
children, and gather them around 
you so closely that they will not be 
tempted to go astray. To so teach 
them that they will love their homes 
and love their surroundings, and 
honor their parents in their lives 
when they go out from the parental 
roof? It is, indeed, an inspiration 
to me to see the sons and daughters 
of President Smith greet him with 
a kiss as they meet each day and 
receive in turn his fatherly greet- 
ing. How many of us, as parents, 
have so taught our children or have 
kept so close to them that the first 
time they meet us each day they 
feel like coming up and putting 
their arms around us and giving us 
a child's kiss, and we in turn kiss- 
ing them? I wonder how many of 
us are so near to our sons that we 
can sit down by their side as they 
are budding into manhood and put 
our arms around them, and warn 
them against the vices of the world, 
and teach them, if they have not 
been taught, to lose every limb of 
their body, before they lose their 
virtue. Teach them that it will 



bring the deepest sorrow ; teach 
them that it will bring a sting to 
them forever to lose the greatest 
gift that God has given us. During 
the past year, strong, hearty, big 
business men, have shed tears in 
confessing to me that they have not 
formed in early manhood the stand- 
ard of morality that they under- 
stand the Latter-day Saints to have, 
and they were sorry to say that they 
deceived j&eir wives. I say to 
mothers and fathers in Israel, that 
Joseph F. Smith meant purity and 
morality and clean living as strong- 
ly as anything else in the world ; for 
if we can keep our children pure 
and clean, they will not go far away 
from the Gospel of Jesus Christ, 
as restored to us through the 
Prophet Joseph. 

Should our Elders in the field sin 
they would never have the heart to 
face the world, and call them to re- 
pentance, because Satan will whis- 
per, "Why are you out here? You 
ought to go home. You have done 
wrong. You have violated the sa- 
cred covenants that you made. You 
have no right to call the world to 
repentance," etc. And so, my broth- 
ers and sisters, on this score alone 
we ought to gather our sons and 
daughters around us and teach them 
the great strength of bemg clean 
and uncontaminated from the wick- 
ed ways of the world. 

We, as a rule, guard our daugh- 
ters, and we are able to rear them 
so that they are clean and pure be- 
fore God ; but I am afraid we are 
not as careful with our sons. If 
they associate with evil companions, 
perhaps a few years older than 
themselves ; they hear things that 
are wrong; they receive a wrong 
conception of the most important 
things of life, and ere we are aware 
they may have done many things 



ELDER G. E. ELLSWORTH. 



61 



they are sorry for. Had their fath- 
ers begun teaching these vital truths 
to their boys of fourteen and fifteen, 
had they put their arms around 
them and made companions of 
them, they could send them out 
in the world, and in to life so 
strong they would come back, no 
matter how long the time, as clean 
as when they left their mother's 
arms. 

I rejoice in the Gospel of the 
Lord Jesus Christ. I rejoice in the 
testimony I have that God lives, and 
that Jesus Christ is His son and the 
Savior of the world. I rejoice that 
the Latter-day Saints believe in God 
and in His Son, Jesus Christ, and 
believe that He actually lived, and 
lives today, and is able to counsel 
them, and render unto the world 
His Father's mind and will concern- 
ing the walks and conversations of 
men and women in the earth. It 
gives me pleasure, beyond my pow- 
er to express, to have the privilege 
of laboring with men and women 
who night and morning kneel down 
and in humility pray for me as well 
as for those who are at home, men 
and women who earnestly desire to 
be guided and directed to teach and 
say and do the things ihat will 
build up the kingdom of God and 
magnify His name, in the earth. 

We, as Latter-day Saints, pray 
for Joseph F. Smith every day of 
our lives, and in our hearts we sus- 
tain him and uphold him, as our 
leader and as the man to whom our 
Father gives ability to proclaim the 
things we need. He has given us 
this day instructions concerning our 
children ; and I say it behooves us 
to go home and find some way to 
reach our sons and daughters who 
may be careless, and estranged from 
us ; if there are any such. I venture 
the assertion that there are fathers 



in Israel who have never had their 
arms around their sons for many 
days and years, and in consequence 
there is a barrier between them. 
We should have the power to break 
that barrier down that keeps us 
from loving and counseling and 
helping our own flesh as we should. 
We sustain Joseph F. Smith, and 
we ought to heed his counsel and 
example and take the first oppor- 
tunity to bring about conditions that 
there may be love between father 
and son such as should exist. 

We ought to sustain each other 
with our faith and prayers ; and by 
our daily actions we ought to sus- 
tain each other in business. We 
ought to look after each other's in- 
terests, that we shall not be crowd- 
ed out of our place. We ought first 
to remember our brother, that he in 
return may remember us, and by so 
doing grow strong together. We 
are told to love our enemies, and I 
believe the Latter-day Saints, of all 
the people of the world, have loved 
their enemies, have builded them up 
when they have come in among us 
in such a way that they are strong- 
er and more prosperous than our- 
selves. 

We have something like two hun- 
dred students in Chicago, studying 
medicine, dentistry, mining, law, 
architecture, and other things. 
When they come back here, if they 
were known as John or Bill or Dick, 
they still are frequently dubbed 
John or Bill or Dick. They may 
have taken first honors in their col- 
lege work; they may have stood 
head and shoulders above some oth- 
er men, still it makes no difference. 
But when some common boy from 
some other state comes here to lo- 
cate among us, it is "Dr." So and 
So, it is "Prof." So and So; it is 
this and that and the other with 



62 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



never a thought of who they used 
to be or what their present attitude 
toward our welfare is. I say, my 
brothers and sisters, we should give 
our boys a fair chance, we ought 
at least to give them an equal op- 
portunity with those we know noth- 
ing of. If I were to be operated up- 
on, I should like to have the knife 
in the hand of a man who knows 
that my spirit came from God, who 
has a prayer in his heart that I may 
recover, and who will do everything 
in his power, and do it in a better 
way because my life is more sacred 
to him than to those who know not 
what life is, neither know God or 
keep His commandments. 

I know some of the men who 
came here from other towns and 
states, I know their lives, and I tell 
you that it will pay you to stand by 
Bill and John and Dick when they 
come home. When these profes- 
sional men to whom I refer 
go into other places they seek mem- 
bership and fellowship with the 
churches in order to get their pat- 
ronage but here they join our en- 
emies ; they take sides with those 
who seek to destroy our faith and 
sacred honor, yet we love and sup- 
port and build up these very men. I 
would like our own to have a little 
more chance after being away for 
years. We need to love our ene- 
mies, but not so much that we turn 
our own out of house and home 
and out of the country that our par- 
ents and grand-parents have made. 
I love the students that labor with 
us as missionaries, students who 
stand well with their professors and 
college students worthy of your pat- 
ronage. Some of the presidents of 
graduating classes in different col- 
leges have been nothing more than 
returned Mormon Elders, men who 
have filled 'missions, and gone back 



to school, and because of their 
leadership, are honored by their fel- 
lowmen ; but when they come home, 
in some instances they find they 
have not a bit more or not an even 
chance with those who believe that 
when we die we are gone forever. 

We ought and do pray for the 
President of the Church; we pray 
for the Twelve, and we sustain 
them, and we ought also to pray 
for every individual member of the 
Church, and we ought to sustain 
them too, that they may leceive an 
inheritance in Zion, that through 
their lives and works and suc- 
cesses, this kingdom may be built up. 
When we need men in any line, we 
ought to call men who have the Spir- 
it of God in their bosom, and who 
would do everything to save our 
lives or property, or that which is 
entrusted into their care, and in turn 
use their substance to the building 
up of this great cause instead of 
spending it in trying to undo what 
God has set us to do. 

I rejoice in the Gospel of the 
Lord Jesus Christ. I rejoice in the 
achievements of the past, and I hope 
most earnestly that we shall sustain 
each other so well that we in the 
future, as young men and young 
women, will build well upon the 
foundations that have been laid by 
our noble sires. We will never.be 
able to do it if we sO love our en- 
emies that we give them preference 
in our business life and associations 
and companionship over those who 
bow the knee with us. 

Some colleges of the east so rec- 
ognize our people that numbers of 
our students who have come there 
to enter college have received en- 
trance credit for woik done as mis- 
sionaries. They regard the training 
of young men who have done mis- 
sionary work as qualifying them 



ELDER G. E. ELLSWORTH.

mentally to go on with college work 
more than had they been doing la- 
bor in other lines. 

The Lord bless us, and help us to 
"listen to a prophet's voice, and 
hear the words of God," and in the 
way of truth abide, that we may sing 
for joy aloud. God bless the moth- 
ers and fathers of the missionaries 
and answer your prayers upon their 
heads-, and in turn answer their 
prayers upon your heads, that Zion 



may grow and prosper until the hon- 
est in the earth shall sing praises 
unto the Master, until all shall know 
that our Redeemer lives, is my 
prayer in the name of Jesus Christ. 

The congregation sang the hymn, 
"We thank Thee, O God, for a 
Prophet." 

Benediction was pronounced by 
Elder Heber C. Jex. 



SECOND DAY. 



In the Tabernacle, Monday, Oc- 
tober 4th, 10 a. m. 

Conference was called to order 
by President Joseph F. Smith. 

The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn : 

Praise to the man who communed 
with Jehovah! 
Jesus anointed that "Prophet and 
Seer"— 
Blessed to open the last dispensation; 
Kings shall extol him and nations 
revere. 

Prayer was offered by Elder Ben- 
jamin Goddard. 

The choir sang the hymn : 

Lo! the mighty God appearing, 
From on high Jehovah speaks! 

Eastern lands the summons hearing, 
O'er the west His thunder breaks. 



ELDER RUDGER CLAWSON. 

A profitable cyclone. — History and 
powers of the Priesthood. — Bene- 
fits of class instruction in Priest- 
hood duties. 

Brethren and sisters, the Lord is 
very good to us and orders all 
things well. Last evening He sent 
a beautiful shower which cooled the 
air and laid the dust, and today it 
is bright and beautiful for the hold- 
ing of our conference and for the 
movement of the people upon the 
streets of our city, and, later in the 
day, for the State Fair which is 
now open. Speaking of the weath- 
er reminds me of a story that is 
told of a capitalist who went from 



the eastern states into one of the 
western states — Kansas, I think — 
to look at a large farm, with a view 
to investment. In speaKing with 
the farmer, he inquired very care- 
fully as to the quality of the soil of 
the farm ; the farmer replied that it 
was very rich and productive. The 
capitalist said, "How is the weath- 
er here, how is your climate?" "O," 
he says, "we have a very fine cli- 
mate here — very fine. I will give 
you an example : Sometime ago- 
I had two or three hundred chick- 
ens that I wanted to put upon the 
market. Being very busy, I did 
not know what to do to prepare 
these chickens and get them to the 
market. I was very much worried 
in regard to the matter. About: 
that time a cyclone came along,, 
caught up the chickens, twisted 
their necks, stripped them of all 
their feathers, and transported them: 
to the town, ten miles distant, and 
put them on the market, all ready 
for sale the next morning.." 
(Laughter). 

Now, my brethren and sisters, I 
don't know where you would go, in 
all the world, to find a better cli- 
mate, a climate more beautiful and 
satisfactory than our own. Of 
course, we have a few severe blows 
occasionally — notably in Davis 
County — but nothing to compare 
with those nice, convenient, gentle, 
cyclone zephyrs of Kansas. 

I would like to say a few words, 
this morning, upon the subject of 
the priesthood, inasmuch as this is 
n. matter that always vitally con-

cerns us. There is a vast differ- 
ence, brethren and sisters, between 
priesthood and priestcraft. Priest- 
hood, as I understand it, is the au- 
thority of God delegated to men, 
by which they can build up His 
Church and kingdom upon the 
earth. Priestcraft is the assumed 
authority of God, by which men 
claim that they are building up the 
Church and kingdom of God. Now, 
if this be true, wherever you find 
the people of Godvupon the earth, 
there you will find the priesthood. 
We are borne out in this claim by 
the scriptures, also by the revela- 
t'ons of God given to Joseph Smith, 
which throw a flood of light upon 
this important question. It is said, 
in one of the revelations, that the 
priesthood continueth in the Church 
of God, in all generations, and is 
without beginning of days or end 
of years. It is referred to, in the 
holy scriptures, as a holy priest- 
hood, a royal priesthood, an un- 
changeable priesthood, and an ever- 
lasting priesthood. You will find 
in section 84, these very important 
words recorded. The order of the 
priesthood was instituted in the 
days of Adam, and was handed 
clown from father to son, and right- 
ly belongs to the descendants of the 
chosen seed. Adam ordamed Seth, 
Enos, Canaan, Mahalaleel, Jared, 
Enoch and Methuselah to the priest- 
hood, and Methuselah ordained 
Noah. Abraham was ordained to 
the priesthood by Melchizedek who 
received it through the lineage of 
his father, back to and until the 
time of Noah. Moses received the 
priesthood under the hand of his 
father-in-law, Jethro, who received 
it through a line of prophets back 
to Esaias, who received it under 
the hand of God. Esaias lived also 
in the days of Abraham and was 



I). 1 est of him. Now, we read in the 
revelation, that Moses sought to 
sanctify the children of Israel, that 
they might behold the face of God ; 
but they hardened their hearts and 
they could not endure His presence, 
and God swore in His wrath — for 
His anger was kindled against 
them — that they should not enter 
into His rest while in the wilder- 
ness, which rest was the fulness of 
His glory. Moses and the high 
priesthood was taken out of their 
midst, and the lesser priesthood 
was continued among the children 
of Israel until the time of John the 
Baptist, who was raised up of God 
to overthrow the kingdom of the 
Jews, and to prepare the way of 
the Lord and make His way 
straight. John received the Holy 
Ghost from his mother's womb, and 
he was baptized and ordained to 
the priesthood, by an angel, when 
he was eight days old. Now, breth- 
ren and sisters, we also have every 
reason to believe that the Lord 
Jesus Christ held the priesthood, 
for is it not said of Him that He 
was a great high priest, and does 
He not say of Himself that He had 
received all power both in the heav- 
ens and upon the earth; and did 
He not also say to His apostles, 
"You have not chosen me, but I 
have chosen you and ordained you." 
It follows that the Savior would 
not have ordained His disciples had 
He not received the power to or- 
dain. We know, and we have 
learned by revelation, by the word 
of the Lord, that Joseph Smith re- 
ceived the priesthood under the 
hands of Peter, James and John. 
He received it in the year 1 829, and 
in the following year, in Septem- 
ber, 1830, this matter is referred 
to in a revelation given to the 
, Prophet Joseph Smith, in which the 



66 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Lord says, beginning with the 12th 
verse : 

"And also with Peter, and James, 
and John, whom I have sent unto 
you, by whom I have ordained you 
and confirmed you to be apostles, and 
especial witnesses of my name, and 
bear the keys of your ministry, and of 
the same things which I revealed unto 
them." 

Also John the Baptist appeared 
to Joseph Smith the Prophet, in 
May, 1829, and laying his hands 
upon his head and the head of Oli- 
ver Cowdery, he used these words : 

"Upon you, my fellow servants, in 
the name of the Messiah, I confer 
the Priesthood of Aaron, which holds 
the keys of the ministering of angels, 
and of the gospel of repentance, and 
of baptism by immersion for the re- 
mission of sins; and this shall never 
be taken again from the earth until 
the sons of Levi do offer again an of- 
fering unto the Lord in righteous- 
ness." 

Thus, brethren and sisters, it is 
very easily shown that the priest- 
hood was handed down from Adam 
to Joseph Smith the Prophet, and 
from Joseph Smith to us who are 
assembled here this day. I have 
only referred to the priesthood in 
the abstract. When you come into 
a little closer range, you will find 
it a most interesting and instruc- 
tive study. This matter of priest- 
hood is treated, very fully indeed, 
in section 84 and also in section 107 
of the Doctrine and Covenants. We 
learn that there are two priest- 
hoods ; one is called the High 
Priesthood, the Melchizedek Priest- 
hood, and the other is called the 
Lesser Priesthood, or the Priest- 
hood of Aaron. In these priest- 
hoods there are various offices and 
orders. In the High Priesthood we 
have High Priests, Seventies, El- 



ders ; and in the Lesser Priest- 
hood, Bishops, Priests, Teachers, and 
Deacons. The High Priesthood is de- 
fined as the power and authority 
to hold the keys of all the spirit- 
ual blessings of the Church, to have- 
the privilege of receiving the mys- 
teries of the Kingdom of Heaven, 
to have the heavens opened unto 
them, to commune with the gener- 
al assembly of the Church of the 
First Born, and to hold communion 
with God the Father and Jesus the 
Mediator of the new covenant. The 
Lesser Priesthood is defii.ed as the 
power and authority that holds the 
keys of the ministering of angels, 
and of the Gospel of repentance, 
and baptism for the remission of 
sins, agreeable to the covenants and 
commandments. You see what a 
very important bearing this priest- 
hood has upon the Church and 
Kingdom of God. If you should 
separate the priesthood and the 
power of the priesthood from those 
who are gathered in this great as- 
sembly today, we would be weak in- 
deed. It is said in the revelations 
that in the ordinances of the priest- 
hood is the power of godliness 
manifested ; and without this, 
the power of godliness is not man- 
ifested ; and without the ordinances 
of the priesthood and the authority 
thereof, the power of godliness is 
not manifest; and without this au- 
thority no man can see the face of 
God and live. Again, these very 
impressive words are recored in sec- 
tion 84 of the Doctrine and Cove- 
nants : 

"For whoso is faithful unto the ob- 
taining these two priesthoods, of 
which I have spoken, and the magni- 
fying their calling, are sanctified by 
the Spirit unto the renewing of their 
bodies; 

"They become the sons of Moses 
and of Aaron and the seed of Abra-

ham, and the church and kingdom, 
and the elect of God; 

"And also all they who receive this 
Priesthood receiveth me, saith the 
Lord; 

"For he that receiveth my servants 
receiveth me; 

"And he that receiveth me receiv- 
eth my Father; 

"And he that receiveth my Father 
receiveth my Father's kingdom; there- 
fore all that my Father hath shall be 
given unto him; 

"And this is according to the oath 
and covenant which belongeth to the 
Priesthood. 

"Therefore, all those who receive 
the Priesthood, receive this oath and 
covenant of my Father, which he can- 
not break, neither can it be moved; 

"But whoso breaketh this covenant, 
after he hath received it, and alto- 
gether turneth therefrom, shall not 
have forgiveness of sins in this world 

nor in the world to come." 

Now, from this we get some un- 
derstanding of the character and 
importance of the priesthood. It 
is a matter so sacred and concerns 
us so deeply, brethren and sisters, 
that it has been thought wise by 
the general authorities to establish 
classes in the priesthood, that the 
brethren of the priesthood may be- 
come acquainted with the doctrines 
of the Gospel and may learn their 
duty in their quorums. To me this 
seems beautiful; it seems consist- 
ent and right, that thereby they 
might acquire a love for it, and a 
spirit of devotion and of loyalty 
to their quorums ; that no man need, 
necessarily, go outside or away 
from his quorum to learn his dutv, 
and to become acquainted with the 
importance of the priesthood. A 
committee on priesthood quorums 
was appointed, and this committee 
prepared outlines of a course of 
study for the last year, which course 
was received joyfully by the 
Church, and has been followed. This 
course of lessons was studied in the 



quorums during the past winter and 
into the spring. Now, we have 
some difficulties to meet; there are 
some obstacles in the way. One of 
the most serious of them is the fact 
that most of the classes were com- 
pelled, through circumstances, be- 
cause of their work and conditions 
that surrounded them, to adjourn 
during the summer months. Thus 
they were broken up, and the mem- 
bers have been scattered. Now it 
will be necessary to gather them to- 
gether again, and arouse in them a 
spirit of interest in this work. I 
look upon said adjournment as very 
unfortunate. I do not know that it 
is possible, but if it is possible, it 
seems to me, that we ought to de- 
vise some means by which these 
classes of the priesthood can pursue 
their studies, without interruption, 
through the entire year ; if we 
would be successful in this thing, 
it must be so, brethren and sisters, 
I think it must be so. 

Now, in conclusion, let me say 
this : Think what it means to the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints, when the fathers in sixty 
stakes of Zion, and in seven or 
eight hundred wards of the Church, 
can say to their boys : Boys, come, 
let us go to the priesthood meeting. 
And the father takes his boys, gath- 
ers them around him, and they go 
with the father to the priesthood 
meeting. How beautiful that is. 
The father goes into his class to be 
instructed in the duties of the priest- 
hood, the deacon goes into his class, 
the teacher into his class, and the 
priest into his class. They follow 
their lessons and obtain their in- 
struction, and at the close the fath- 
er gathers his sons around him, 
they accompany him home again. 
Thus they are brought into an in- 
timacy, a closeness of acquaintance 



68 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



and of friendship and love that has, 
possibly, never been known in the 
Church. Think what it means, 
brethren and sisters, to the Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints, when an elder in Israel shall 
have nine years of training in the 
priesthood before he is permitted 
and found worthy to receive the 
high-priesthood. For instance, he 
has three years training as a deacon, 
three years training as a teacher, 
three years training as a priest ; 
then he is ready and, generally I 
think, would be found worthy, and 
would have sufficient knowledge, to 
entitle him to receive the office of 
an Elder; and even then the good 
work continues. He gets his train- 
ing as an Elder, and he will receive 
his training as a Seventy, and even 
if he goes beyond and higher up, 
he will still be instructed and taught 
his duty in the Church, as a High 
Priest. Think what it means to the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints, brethren and sisters, 
when a boy in this Church shall re- 
ceive nine years training in the art 
of singing- — we know what the val- 
ue of singing is to our boys — think 
what it will mean when the boy has 
nine years training in his quorum, 
besides other opportunities in the 
Church, to prepare him for mis- 
sionary work, that when he shall go 
into the field he is prepared and 
qualified not only to preach the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ but to sing 
it into the hearts of the people. In 
my humble opinion, we do not be- 
gin to comprehend the possibilities 
of this great movement in the 
Church, for I regard it as one of 
the greatest movements that has 
been inauguarated in recent times. 
I believe that the Lord Almighty 
will work wonders with His peo- 
ple, through this study and train- 



ing in the priesthood and in the 
priesthood classes. I hope the pres- 
idents of stakes and bishops of 
wards and all the authorities of Zion 
will appreciate this great step in 
advance, this opportunity that is 
now thrown open for the training 
of the youth of Zion in a knowl- 
edge of eternal things. 

May the Lord bless us and help 
us and strengthen us in every good 
work, is my prayer, in the name 
of Jesus Christ, Amen.

may continue with us until the end. 
I, for one, never get tired of thank- 
ing my Heavenly Father that I was 
born in these valleys of the moun-

every one of them, should thank 
God every day of their lives, that 
they are permitted to live here un- 
der such favorable circumstances.

We see prosperity on all hands, it 
is so universal, we take it for grant- 
eel that it is but natural, and forget 
that it is God's blessings showered 
upon us. I tell you, my brethren 
and sisters, we live in a blessed part 
of this country. God has blest this 
inter-mountain country with so 
many of the material blessings of 
this world, that there is n" place to 
compare with it. I hope and trust 
that the brethren and sisters will 
realize this and that they will be 
contented and thankful; that they 
will keep their sons and their 
daughters around them ; that they 
will cultivate their farms a little bet- 
ter, and by cultivating them better, 
be able to increase their produc- 
tiveness, thus enabling them to di- 
vide it with their children and pre- 
vent them from leaving the state to 
establish new homes elsewhere. In 
this way we will have more homes 
in all of our communities and a bet- 
ter chance of our children having a 
God-fearing home. 

There has been considerable said 
during this conference, about home 
industry, the necessity o', proper 
home-life, the improvement of 
home-surroundings. I wish to em- 
phasize all those good instructions, 
and I want also to call the attention 
of the people here to the fact that 
there are many successful homes 
that, perhaps, would not be looked 
upon as successful homes by many 
who do not know what constitutes 
a home of that character. Every 
home in Zion should be a home of 
order, a home of contentment, a 
home of hospitality, and a home of 
godliness ; for it is said : "The 
beauty of a home is order; the 
blessing of a home is contentment; 
the glory of a home is hospitality ; 
the crown of a* home is godliness." 
My brethren and sisters, I wonder 



if our homes are such. I wonder 
if we, as heads of homes, have built 
upon these truths and taught our 
children the same. What greater 
truth than that the crown of the 
home is godliness. My brethren 
and sisters, the fear that I have of 
Christianity today, in my beloved 
country, is that the spirit of pray- 
er, of godliness, if you please, is 
fast vanishing from the homes of 
the people. In many parts of 
America the best of people, as they 
are called, • do not even ask God's 
blessing upon the food that they eat. 
They never think of praying to 
God, in private or as families; and 
it seems to me that this is a menace 
to Christianity, and reformation is 
needed in a great majority of homes 
in this our beloved country. 

All manner of isms are arising. 
There is a feeling, from one end of 
the country to the other, of throw- 
ing off the yoke of what people call 
Christianity. I care not for the 
cranks that may arise from time to 
time, for their lives are short; but 
it seems to me that when a man 
like Dr. Charles R. Eliot, of the 
great Harvard University, comes 
out and announces as a new doc- 
trine a faith that denies the Divin- 
ity of Jesus Christ, that denies that 
man is made in God's image, that 
denies the authenticity of all bibli- 
cal miracles, the efficacy of pray- 
er, the supernatural value of the 
sacrament, the merit of self-sacri- 
fice, and even denies the immortal- 
ity of the soul — it strikes me, my 
brethren and sisters, that there is 
danger for Christianity among the 
people. He is a man who has been 
honored with the greatest of posi- 
tions, and even, within a short time, 
offered a position as the American 
ambassador to one of. the greatest 
countries on this earth. While I 



70 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



haven't the time, this morning, to 
analyze these denials of his, I am 
going to content myself by saying, 
today, that such teaching has a ten- 
dency to bring into the homes of the 
American people a disregard for 
Christ and His teachings. When 
that is accomplished, when the spir- 
it of anti-Christ enters the home, I 
want to say to the good people here 
assembled, and to the people of this 
country, there is a condition in the 
home that cannot be too strongly 
condemned, and can only be over- 
come by the acquisition of a knowl- 
edge of Christ and our Heavenly 
Father. 

I hope our homes are homes of 
order ; I hope that our homes are 
homes of contentment — and when I 
say "home," I mean a pk-.ce where 
the father, the mother and every 
child loves one another and fears 
God. It is not necessarily a man- 
sion. A successful, contented home 
may be one within only four sim- 
ple walls ; it may be of the humblest 
proportions and of the poorest con- 
struction; but if in that home there 
is the love of God ; if there is love 
and contentment ; if all the family 
are laboring to one end, I know that 
it is a home that God is pleased 
with. Let me impress this fact up- 
on the people here, that the fore- 
most of all things to bring content- 
ment into a home is the faithful 
practice of prayer. Let the father 
pray ; let the mother pray ; let every 
child pray; let them take their 
turns, and let the heaithstone be the 
place where the desires of your 
hearts are poured out to your Heav- 
enly Father. 

I think about the meanest being 
on this earth is a lazy man. I have 
met a few men, and I rhank the 
Lord they are few, whom I consid- 
er absolutely lazy, so lazy they al- 



low their wives to do all the work 
at home, and earn the living for the 
family, including the head of the 
household. I remember, on one oc- 
casion, meeting one of these men. 
I asked him why he didn't get 
work ? I knew he was always look- 
ing for it, but hoping and praying 
that he would not find it. I could 
see him upon the street all times of 
day 'and all seasons of the year, and 
I asked him how he made a living? 
"Well," he said, "my wife is still 
washing." I said to him, "If you 
can't find a job, why on earth don't 
you go and help the wifc wash?" 
"Why, that is beneath the dignity 
of a man," was his answei . I say, 
God pity such a being — I hardly 
like to call him a man. I ask the 
brethren and sisters here today, to 
begin with each one of your chil- 
dren, when they are young; instil 
into them a desire to work. I thank 
God that I have a trade at my fin- 
gers' ends ; and that it is a great 
joy to me, for I know I can go and 
earn my living any time as a wool- 
en goods manufacturer. I want 
every daughter of mine to learn 
how to work. I want her, when 
she is married, to be capable of tak- 
ing care of a home. I care not 
whether she has to do it or not; I 
want her to know how to do it. I 
was reading, in a magazine last 
night, an article on Laziness, by Dr. 
Albert Von Bergmann, of Berlin, 
who is acknowledged as the one 
man of the world who has made the 
greatest study of this question ; and 
this is what he says about laziness : 

"No one is born naturally lazy. 
One born indolent and inactive is al- 
ready diseased by some other cause 
than laziness. The chronically lazy 

boy is at the start as healthy as the 
average child, but, as- he continues to 
refuse to do his work in school, his 



ELDER REED SMOOT. 



71 



duties at home, his labor in shop and 
field, a great physical change takes 
place in him. He physically becomes 
so that he cannot help being k.zy ex- 
cept under powerful, curative treat- 
ment. 

"The motor muscles and points of 
his feet soften as do those of tie legs 
and hands. The powers of perception 
of the brain are dull, and thought be- 
comes sluggish and non-creative. The 
eye is dulled and only performs about 
half of the functions it should. The 
ear misses many sounds, and thus 
weakens the strength of its possessor. 
Although slower in its develcpment, 
there is as much disintegration in a 
lazy boy's body as in the frame of 
one attacked with a malignant dis- 
ease. 

"Gradually this physical change 
passes into the soul, and the beauti- 
ful inspirations given by God to all 
new-born beings change under human 
influence into criminal instincts. So- 
ciety receives then the boy aeggar, 
the boy thief, the boy sloth. Nothing 
is left to do with him but lo;k him 
up, or drive him from town t3 town 
until death releases him from his use- 
lessness." 

I would like to see every father 
have a desire in his heart to see his 
boy become proficient in whatever 
line of work is mapped out for him, 
or the boy may choose. We talk 
about home manufactures — why, I 
gave almost twenty years of my 
life, to the Woolen Mills at Provo ; 
and I want to say that one of the 
hardest things that I had to contend 
with was to get boys and girls, and 
even men, and women to stay long 
enough at a job to learn how to do 
the work well. My brethren and 
sisters, it seems to me that if the 
Manufacturers' Association, or the 
Chambers of Commerce cf our 
state, would like to do a splendid 
thing for this state, in developing 
home manufacturers, they would 
have a committee appointed from 
their body to go and visit some of 
the great manufacturing centers, as 



well as the smaller ones, of this 
country, and pick out from among 
the thousands of different articles 
manufactured east, those that could 
be made here, and then secure the 
formation of companies to make 
them here. Why, take little New 
Jersey, a state no larger than one 
of our counties, I never realized 
that any one little spot could be so 
interested in everything that was 
affected by the tariff. There was 
scarcely an item in all of the eight 
hundred paragraphs of the bill, that 
New Jersey was not interested in — 
not all large concerns, but little con- 
cerns, the manufacturing of little 
things. I believe that a committee 
could go east and look up hundreds 
of these little things, that would not 
take very much money to manufac- 
ture here, and I have no doubt, 
could be made successfully. Sup- 
pose there were only a hundred of 
them ; and suppose that there were 
only twenty men or boys required in 
each one of them, there would be two 
thousand men or boys engaged in 
useful work. Every industry that 
can be started here, that will give 
your boys employment is, as has 
been said here, a blessing to the 
whole community. 

I hope that the fathers will take 
an interest in the work at home; I 
hope they will lighten the burden 
of mothers just as much as possible. 
I once heard a man speak in pub- 
lic, and he said that he had not 
kissed his wife since he was mar- 
ried to her. Brethren and sisters, 
I thought that a strange remark 
and a confession of wrong doing. 
I do not believe in that doctrine or 
practice. I have never left my 
home, when my wife was there, 
from the day that I had a home, up 
till this very morning, without kiss- 
ing my wife goodbye. I never left 



11 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



her at noon-time, in my life, unless 
I kissed her goodbye. And I wish 
that every Latter-day Saint would 
follow this practice — not to kiss my 
wife, but his own. (Laughter). 
Start married life and continue it, 
by making the wife feel that you 
are interested in her labors and love 
her. Lift as much of the burden 
from her tired shoulders as it is 
possible to do ; for you know it is 
said, "Man's work is from sun to 
sun ; but woman's work is never 
clone." No successful home can be 
made by the father alone ; no suc- 
cessful home can be made by the 
mother, alone ; it takes a united 
family to make a perfect Latter- 
day Saint home. . 

May God give us strength and a 
determination to make every home 
in Zion a perfect home and, above 
all, a prayerful home, a godlike 
home, an industrious home, a con- 
tented home, a hospitable home, and 
a home of order, I ask, in the name 
of Jesus Christ. Amen.

For some time prior to our an-

experience a good deal of anxiety, 
as I contemplate the probability of 
my having to address the confer- 
ence. The Elders of the Church are 
not in the habit of making set dis- 
courses, but rely upon the Lord and 
His inspiration, and the inspiration 
they can gather from the people of 
God, for what they shall say. I al- 
ways have more or less fear that 



I shall be unable to collect my 
thoughts and put them in an order 
that shall be profitable and interest- 
ing to the Latter-da> Saints. As a 
general thing, however, when a man 
puts his trust in the Lord, the Lord 
sustains him. While, as I have said, 
I have anxiety prior to these con- 
ferences because of having to speak 
at them, I have usually had great 
cause for thankfulness, when the 
ordeal is over. The remarks of 
Brother Clawson and Brother 
Smoot have given me an opening, 
however ; and I desire to say a few 
words along similar lines. 

I know that this is the work of 
God, this latter-da)' work, that is be- 
ing performed by the people known 
as the Latter-day Saints. This 
knowledge has come to me through 
my own observation, through my 
own study, as also by the inspiration 
and impression, upon my heart, of 
the Holy Ghost. I am satisfied that 
the work that has been so well start- 
ed and has made such wonderful 
progress in the world, will continue 
until the principles embraced in the 
Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ, as 
understood by the Latter-day 
Saints, and as revealed to us of the 
Lord, through His servant Joseph 
Smith, the Prophet, shall fill the 
whole earth and be understood and 
accepted by all the children of God. 
Such is my hope and my faith, and 
I have no doubt whatsoever in this 
regard. 

While Brother Smoot was speak- 
ing of this new religion — if you may 
call it a religion — of which Doctor 
Eliot has assumed the head, I 
thought to myself that it is not any- 
thing new. It is but a crystalliza- 
tion, on the part of Doctor Eliot, of 
the beliefs of the Christian clergy 
throughout the whole country. It 
is what they have been believing and 



ELDER HYRUM M. SMITH. 



73 



preaching all along. As a result of 
this belief and of this preaching, the 
Christian churches have been almost 
depleted of their membership ; there 
lias at least been a great falling off 
in attendance at Divine worship ; 
and I think that Doctor Eliot's crys- 
tallization of these beliefs into a sort 
of creed, will accomplish, perhaps, 
the entire depletion of the churches 
of the various Christian denomina- 
tions. 

But, my brethren and sisters, 
Brother Smoot saw danger in this, 
and perhaps there is danger in 
it to the Christian churches ; but 
as he was speaking, I asked my- 
self the question, is not the hand 
of God in it? I believe, in all 
these movements which take upon 
themselves the nature of being 
world-wide, the hand of the Lord is 
in them. Mankind have been go- 
ing to these various churches in 
search of God, their heavenly Fath- 
er ; they have been going for the 
purpose of receiving solace to their 
souls ; they have desired consolation, 
instruction, information and guid- 
ance; and they have not found it. 
Hence, multitudes have turned 
away from these places and have 
lost interest in the so-called relig- 
ions extant among modern Chris- 
tianity. But there is something in 
man, and it has been demonstrated 
to be in man from the beginning un- 
til now, that cries out for support, 
for help, for comfort, for consola- 
tion, for knowledge of some su- 
preme being. Man is naturally a 
worshipful creature. He believes in 
a power greater than his own. He 
sees all around him the workings of 
a greater power than that of man, 
he sees the handiwork of Deity, 
both in the heavens and in the earth. 
It is natural for men to be religious 
and to seek after God. But they 
have not found Him in the church- 



es; hence they have abandoned 
them, largely. Now comes Doctor 
Eliot with his crystallization of 
these ideas referred to by Elder 
Smoot. Well, it will be popular 
with some; but do you think that 
mankind are going to be satisfied 
with that kind of husk? I don't 
think so, not for a moment. The 
Latter-day Saints, have struggled 
and have worked, since the incep- 
tion of the Church, to spread a 
knowledge of the truth among the 
children of men. We have preached 
the Gospel ; we have proclaimed the 
restoration of it; we have declared 
Joseph Smith a prophet; we have 
preached that God is, as He revealed 
Himself, a person, and that man 
was created in His image ; that as 
Christ, the Redeemer, His Being 
was like unto man, so wa»- He like 
unto His Father, and His Father 
like unto Him and to the children 
of men. We have made wonderful 
success in convincing many of the 
truth of these revelations from the 
Lord. Yet the great majority are 
still unconvinced. I believe the 
Lord is now using their ministers 
and learned men to destroy the faith 
of the people in these faise creeds 
which have erroneously been called 
the churches of Christ. Let men go 
on and do their work ; let them per- 
suade mankind that there is no 
God ; that there is no such thing as 
the immortality of the soul ; that 
there is no revelation ; nor proph- 
ecy ; that there is no such thing as 
authority — only that authority 
which men themselves assume. Let 
them go on and do this until men 
have lost faith in all these false re- 
ligions in which they have had faith, 
heretofore. I see in it the workings 
of the hand of God, for they will 
be less satisfied then than before 
they were undeceived. And they 
will look elsewhere to satisfy that 



74 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



which within them cries out for 
something that they know not of; 
and where will they look? They 
will look here and there; they will 
run to and fro, and, as predicted, 
they will not find it among the or- 
ganizations which have been estab- 
lished by men and which have been 
perpetuated by the authority of 
man. But they will continue to 
look, to search and to seek for the 
truth, and the Lord will influence 
and guide them, and they will, in 
time, discover the truth where the 
truth is, and that is in the Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints, — the Church of God, found- 
ed by the power of God, which en- 
joys the authority of the Lord, 
namely, the Priesthood, conferred 
upon man to act and speak in the 
stead of God, in behalf of those 
who seek knowledge and salvation. 
Here they will find it. I cannot 
blame President Eliot for reaching 
the conclusion that hundreds and 
thousands have reached before him, 
and that many are reaching today : 
that there is no such thing as au- 
thority in the Christian churches. 
He has arrived at the tiuth con- 
cerning the Christian churches — be- 
cause there is no such thing as di- 
vine authority in them. Now, if 
these men who have reached this 
state will continue to search for the 
truth, they will discover it in the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day-Saints. They will find within 
it all the pure principles of the Gos- 
pel of salvation, they will become 
familiar with and receive the glor- 
ious gifts of the Holy Ghost; they 
will become acquainted with the 
true doctrines of the kingdom of 
God, and will find also all that the 
soul of man yearns for, and in the 
end life eternal. They will under- 
stand what the Priesthood is and 



comprehend the authority thereof, 
which authority is Divine, and pow- 
erful, and which accomplishes the 
work that authority ought to ac- 
complish among the children of 
men. 

This brings me to the main thing 
I wanted to speak about this morn- 
ing, in connection with the remarks 
of Elder Clawson concerning the 
Priesthood. He spoke of the Priest- 
hood itself ; I desire to make a few 
remarks with respect to the officers 
in the Priesthood. 

The Church is a wonderful or- 
ganization. The terms "wonderful," 
''marvelous" and "remarkable" are 
the only terms that we can find with 
which to express our admiration for 
the organization of the Church in 
these latter days. While wonder- 
ful and marvelous in the perfection 
of its organization, it is also won- 
derful in its simplicity. The Church 
is divided and sub-divided into 
stakes, and wards, and organiza- 
tions. Over these divisions and or- 
ganizations are placed men to pre- 
side and to direct the affa'rs of the 
same, men who hold the Priesthood 
that has been restored by the ser- 
vants of God, under the direction of 
the Father, as explained by Elder 
Clawson this morning. Now, the 
Lord has provided that the Church 
shall be so divided in organization, 
in stakes and wards with men called 
to preside over them, so that this 
most wonderful and mighty work 
may be the more easily accom- 
plished. Every man who holds this 
Priesthood, and is an officer in it, 
has a duty to perform; and if all 
men would get a full understanding 
of their duties and conscientiously 
perform them, then the labor of car- 
rying on the work of God' in the 
world would be a joy to those en- 
gaged in it. If every man had his 



ELDER HYRUM M. SMITH. 



75 



work, and did the work, then, it 
would be easy; but when there are 
some of these officers who are more 
or less indifferent, or careless in the 
performance of their duties, that in- 
creases — in just the proportion of 
the numbers who are thus indiffer- 
ent — the labors of those who are dil- 
igent and faithful. I believe, when 
a man is ordained to the Priesthood, 
and called to ah office therein, he 
ought to seek for the spiiit of that 
calling, and the full understanding 
of what it means to bear the Priest- 
hood, what his duties are ; and then, 
with mighty prayer unto the Lord 
for assistance, set his hand to labor 
in that calling and office to the very 
best of his ability, even unto the 
end, or as long as the Lord wants 
him and does not release him there- 
from. 

The special feature that I desire 
to bring to the attention of the offi- 
cers in the Church is this, that in 
my opinion the freedom with which 
men who hold office in the Church, 
resign that office, is altogether out 
of keeping with the responsibility of 
their calling, and with the work that 
the Lord has for them to do, and 
which He has called them to do, in 
giving them the office and the au- 
thority. This applies more especi- 
ally to the bishops in the Church. It 
was not so formerly, as now, that 
men upon this whim or that whim, 
would resign their positions. Some 
feel that they are at liberty to re- 
sign and get out from under the re- 
sponsibility and authority the very 
moment they find their duties be- 
. coming a little irksome or strenu- 
ous, or troublesome. I ttiink that 
disposition and that spirit altogeth- 
er wrong, brethren. I think it is 
wrong with respect to presidents of 
stakes ; I think it is wrong with the 
bishops ; I think it is wrong when it 



is found among superintendents or 
presiding officers, in any capacity 
whatsoever, who have been called 
and placed in their positions by the 
inspiration of God through His ser- 
vants who preside over them. They 
ought to accept these offices with a 
determination to remain in them un- 
til such time as those who place 
them there say it is enough. There 
are times, of course, when changes 
are necessary and have to be made, 
when men in office,, because of neg- 
lect and indifference, prove them- 
selves incompetent to carry on the 
work of the Lord. But, as a gen- 
eral rule, in such cases the officer 
never resigns ; it is the man who has 
the ability, and who could do the 
work if he would, he is the one who 
may want to resign. If his church 
duties interfere with some desire, or 
some business interests, or he finds 
difficulties arising, that are burden- 
some; perhaps someone has criti- 
cised or found fault with h ; m; why, N 
for these and other unworthy rea- 
sons, he resigns his most sacred and 
holy office in the Church. There 
are some Bishops who have gone 
so far as to deliberately remove 
from one ward to another, or from 
one stake to another, in order to be 
relieved of their duties in the Bish- 
opric. That is not the proper spir- 
it that a Bishop ought to have. Dur- 
ing this year, sixty-eight re-organi- 
zations among the Bishoprics in that 
many wards of the Church have 
taken place. There are six hundred 
and eighty-five wards in the Church. 
That means that ten per cent of 
them have had a re-organization in 
their Bishoprics during tnis year — ■ 
altogether too many resignations. I 
may say that most of these re-or- 
ganizations have been made neces- 
sary because the Bishops had re- 
signed. Very few of them were 



76 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



brought about or found necessary 
because of the death of the Bishop. 
I fear many of these Bbhops re- 
signed because they wanted to get 
out from under the responsibility of 
the Bishopric. I say, brethren, this 
is not right ; it ought not to be. You 
never hear — at least I have never 
heard, and I don't think you have 
heard — of the presidents in the mis- 
sion field sending in their resigna- 
tions, because they find seme diffi- 
culties in the preaching of the Gos- 
pel. The Elders sent abroad rarely 
resign from their missions before 
they are released. I think this same 
loyalty should be found among us 
who hold general and local offices 
and authority in the Priesthood, in 
the stakes and wards of the Church. 
I f a ward is suffering because of its 
liishopric, the president of that 
stake ought to know it ; and if it is 
advisable that a re-organization 
should be made, then the president 
should bring that condition to the 
attention of those whose right and 
duty it is to make the re-organiza- 
tion. If a president of a stake is in- 
competent, or cannot perform his 
duty because of business interests 
and other inclinations on his part, 
and he desires to be relieved of his 
presidency and wants to get out of 
it. the Twelve will very likely dis- 
cover it, and when they receive the 
proper inspiration from the Lord, 
will make the change. Men in this 
Church ought not to feel that they 
are free to resign at their own will 
the positions that the Lord God 
of Heaven has called them to occu- 
py, and in which He has for them a 
work to perform, in the carrying on 
of this great latter- day work, in 
this dispensation. The Lord's will 
rather than man's should be done. 

I would like to say, in connection 
with these remarks, to the people of 



the Church, you ought to make the 
office of the Bishop a pleasant one 
by giving him your undivided sup- 
port, as long as he h worthy of it. 
You ought to withhold your crit- 
icisms and not find fault with him 
when he is doing the best he can. 
Some wards have boasted of their 
ability to "kill off" the Bishops. 
Well, that is wrong on the part of 
the people. The people should love 
the Bishop ; they should delight to 
honor him ; they should sustain him, 
pray for him, and magnify him. 
Much of his strength to bear and to 
perform his duty depends On how 
the saints uphold and sustain him. 
We ought to help these brethren in 
their positions. And to the brethren 
I wish to say again, we should not 
feel that we can lay down these offi- 
ces in the Priesthood, as some have 
felt they could. We should feel 
more, with reference to our offices 
in the Priesthood as we feel toward 
the Priesthood itself. You can't 
find any of the officers of the 
Church, who still retain a love of 
the truth and a knowledge thereof, 
who have a desire to resign from 
holding the Priesthood itself. O 
no ! We don't want the office of 
Bishop : we don't want the trouble 
of being Bishop ; we don't want all 
this labor and responsibility, but we 
want the Priesthood ; we will not 
yield that; we value fhat most high- 
ly, and we are determined to keep 
it. If we would feel this way to- 
ward the offices in the Priesthood, 
it would be better fo r us and better 
for the Church at large, by far ; for 
every time a ward is re-organized, 
it is disturbed from center to cir- 
cumference and the new men have 
to be trained. We are halted in our 
progress as a general thing, mo- 
mentarily at least, when these 
changes have to be made. I hope 



ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH.

in the future the brethren will not 
resign except under the most urgent 
necessity. 

Speaking oj home industries — 
brethren and sisters, I believe in 
home manufacture ; and, as sug- 
gested by President Smitn, yester- 
day morning, I think that along a 
certain line of manufacture the Lat- 
ter-day Saints, every one of them, 
ought to be most industriously en- 
gaged, and that is in the manufac- 
ture, out of their children, material 
for good Bishops and good officers 
of the Church ; giving special care 
and training to the children who 
will in time become the officers in 
the Priesthood and in the Church, 
that when they grow up they will be 
polished and finished articles, fully 
understanding and irealizing that 
when the Lord calls them to posi- 
tions of responsibility, He wants 
them until He releases them from 
their calling. And among our girls, 
we ought to be manufacturing no- 
ble women, true and virtuous, who 
shall be worthy and devout mothers 
in Israel, and keepers of these 
homes that Brother Smcot spoke 
of. I tell you these boys and girls, 
born under the new and everlasting 
covenant, in the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints, are the 
very best and most genuine material 
that can be found among all human 
kind ; and if we do our duty toward 
them, if they are properly taught, 
and if they are industrious in their 
training, as we ought to be, they 
will become men and women of 
whom God Himself shall be proud, 
and glad to bless and magnify in 
our own eyes, and in the eyes of all 
the children of the earth. The Lord 
help us to be true in all things, that 
we may be able to carry on this 
great latter-day work, is my prayer, 
in the name o ( Jesus. Amen. 



A baritone solo, "Oh shining light 
Divine," was sung by Brother Mel- 
vin Peterson. 

The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn : 

O ye mountains high, where the clear 
blue sky 
Arches over the vales of the free, 
Where the pure breezes blow and the 
clear streamlets flow, 
How I've longed to your bosom to 
flee. 

Benediction was pronounced by 
Patriarch Angus M. Cannon. 

Conference adjourned until 2 
p. m. 



AFTERNOON SESSION. 

Conference was resumed at 2 
p. m. 

President Joseph F. Smith called 
the meeting to order. 

The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn: 

Redeemer of Israel, our only delight, 
On whom for a blessing we call. 

Our shadow by day, and bur pillar by 
night, 
Our King, our Deliv'rer,our all! 

Prayer was offered by Elder D. 
M. McAllister. 

The choir sang the anthem,"From 
afar, gracious Lord, Thou hast 
gathered Thy flock." 

ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH. 

Testimonies concerning Christ and the 
Pronhet Joseph Smith — No break in 
the Priesthood. — Setting our homes 
in order. — Should strive after the 
best in life. 

I believe there is no one here to- 
day more gratful than I am for the 
privilege of being here. It is a 



78 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



joy to me to look into the faces of 
my brethren and sisters, whom it 
has been my privilege to visit in 
their homes. 

I realize that you are here be- 
cause you believe it is our Father's 
will that you should be; and you 
have come for the eternal blessings 
of our Father, rather than remain 
at home to seek those things that 
perish in this life. 

I am grateful for the testimony 
God has given me that this is His 
work. I know that He lives. I 
know that Jesus Christ is His Son 
and the Redeemer of the world. I 
know that Joseph Smith was the 
instrument in the hands of our 
Father, to bring again the Gospel 
of salvation to the children of men. 
The Lord has continued His priest- 
hood in the Church, since the days 
of the Prophet and his presiding 
authority, until the present time. 
We are now presided over by a 
faithful servant of our Heavenly 
Father, one of His children whom 
He has chosen to declare unto us 
His mind and will. 

I hope that the words which we 
have heard, in this conference, will 
he taken home by each of us. "Have 
I set my house in order?" This 
should be the query in every heart. 
Not, Has my neighbor done so ? but, 
have I done what the Lord has re- 
quired of me? 

Brethren and sisters, we may 
have given to us, in this life, a few 
things that will give us satisfaction, 
temporally; but the things that are 
eternal, the things that are "worth 
while," are those eternal things that 
we reach out for, and prepare our- 
sevles to receive, and lay hold of 
by the effort that we individually 
make. 

This is God's work ; it is the pow- 
er of God unto salvation, unto every 



man and every woman that will re- 
ceive and obey its precepts ; and I 
bear you witness of it, in the name 
of Jesus Christ, Amen. 



ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS. 

Unity among all the Presiding Quo- 
rums. — Prophecies ' fulfilled. — Re- 
sponsibility resting upon the Saints. 
— Elders laboring under Divine ap- 
pointment. — Work at home: con- 
versions among the Gentiles. — 
Duty of the Priesthood Quorums. — 
Work enough for all. 

I have been trying to take stock 
of myself and of my faith, since 
coming into this meeting, this after- 
noon ; and I have concluded that the 
harmony which exists in the testi- 
monies of my brethren, which have 
been borne during the meetings of 
this conference, and my own 
thoughts and feelings, h an evi- 
dence to me that my- faith is about 
right. I indorse, with all my heart, 
the testimonies which have been 
borne, the instructions which have 
been given to us during the confer- 
ence. I uphold and sustain, with 
all my heart, the President of the 
Church, as such, and as the Proph- 
et, Seer, and Revelator and mouth- 
piece of God unto this people ; and 
I thank the Lord for him, for his 
integrity, for his love of the truth, 
for his administration of the affairs 
of the Church of our Master. I up- 
hold and sustain with him his coun- 
selors. These as men of God, ap- 
proved of Him, sustained with will- 
ing hearts by the people who know 
them, and know that their deepest 
interest is for the welfare and tri- 
umph of the work of the Lord. I 
sustain, with all my heart, the mem- 
bers of the Council of the Twelve. 
I know these men from association

with them, day after day, in counsel 
and in our administrations among 
the people, and I know that they 
have the love of the work at heart. 
I know of their unity — for they are 
united, to a man, in every question 
that has come before us, pertaining 
to the welfare of this work and of 
the people. I sustain them, pray 
. for them, and I know that the Lord 
is with them and blessing their ad- 
ministrations. I uphold and sustain 
the Council of the Seventy, and I 
know that this council is in har- 
mony with the Council of the 
Twelve and the First Presidency. 
The Presiding Bishopric and the 
Patriarch are one with these coun- 
cils. I believe I can say in truth 
that all the council? of the holy 
priesthood, throughout the length 
and breadth of this Church, uphold 
and sustain the general authorities, 
and are one with them ir. interest 
and labor for the progress of the 
work of the Lord. 

In witnessing the great concourse 
of people that we had here in this 
building yesterday, and upon the 
grounds surrounding this building 
— knowing that at ihe same time 
there was an overflow meeting be- 
ing held in the Assembly Hall — 
my thoughts were directed to a rev- 
elation found in the eleventh sec- 
tion of the book of Covenants, 
where the Lord, speaking to the 
Prophet in the year 1829, before 
the organization of the Church, 
said : "A marvelous work is about 
to come forth upon the earth." 
When I think of the conditions at 
that time — (there was no organiza- 
tion of the Church then, but the 
Lord told the Prophet clearly what 
He had in mind to accomplish; Jo- 
seph was to be the instrument in 
His hands, the chief of all instru- 
ments, in bring it about) — and then 



when I see what has been accom- 
plished, knowing that all ihese peo- 
ple are but a small representation 
of the Latter-day Saints, I saw, and 
was impressed with the fulfillment 
of that promise unto Joseph. I re- 
joice in it, and it makes me more 
satisfied, better assured that all 
those other promises that have been 
made by the Lord through His 
prophets, pertaining to the ultimate 
triumph of His work in the last 
days, will be fulfilled. 

In connection with these 
thoughts, I thought of the wonder- 
ful responsibility that rests upon 
us. Numerous as we are, in the 
sense that I have spoken of, we 
are but a handful of our Father's 
children. The Lord, through His 
prophet John, upon the Isle of Pat- 
mos, referred to a time when the 
everlasting Gospel would be re- 
stored by an angel from heaven. It 
was to be preached to every nation, 
kindred, tongue and people. We 
accept the visitation of the angel 
Moroni, the message which he 
brought, the Book of Mormon 
which contains the everlasting Gos- 
pel, and the revelations of the Lord 
to us since, as a fulfillment of that' 
prediction, and we have accepted 
the great responsibility of preach- 
ing this Gospel to every nation, 
kindred, tongue and people, 
throughout the world. We have 
made efforts to this end. I hope 
that our efforts are accepted of the 
Lord. I sometimes wonder if we 
are doing all that He requires of 
us in this connection. We aim to 
maintain, at the present time, in the 
mission-field, from the stakes of Zi- 
on, about two thousand missionar- 
ies. They are maintained at a cost 
of time and money to the elders 
and to the Church, together with 
other expenses connected with the 



80 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



mission fields, in the neighborhood 
of two million dollars per annum, 
or more closely figuring, $150,000.- 
00 per month. When we think of 
it in this sense, it is indeed a wond- 
erful work that we are doing in 
the preaching of the Gospel abroad. 
Now, there is another point in 
connection with this responsibility, 
that I desire to speak of for a few 
moments ; and that we may be im- 
pressed with the greatness of this 
responsibility, I desire to read a few 
paragraphs from the third chapter 
of the Book of Ezekiel. The Lord 
said to Ezekiel : 

"Son of man, I have made thee a 
watchman unto the house of Israel: 
therefore hear the word at my mouth, 
and give them warning from me. 

"When I say unto the wicked, Thou 
shalt surely die; and thou giveth him 
not warning, nor speakest to warn 
the wicked from his wicked way, to 
save h*s life; the same wicked man 
shall die in his iniquity; but his blood 
will I require at thine hand. 

"Yet if thou warn the wicked, and 
he turn not from his wickedness, nor 
from his wicked way, he shall die in 
his iniquity; but thou hast delivered 
thy soul. 

"Again, When a righteous man doth 
turn from his righteousness, and com- 
mit iniquity, and I lay a stumbling 
block before him, he shall die: be- 
cause thou hast not given him warn- 
ing, he shall die in his sin, and his 
righteousness which he hath done 
shall not be remembered, but his 
blood will I require at thine hand." 

This is a responsibility — the Lord 
placed it upon Ezekiel, as a watch- 
man upon the towers of Israel; 
and we have been commissioned 
with like authority and with like 
responsibility. It extends to the 
preaching of the Gospel in the na- 
tions of the earth; and that same 
responsibility, if I understand cor- 
rectly, rests upon those of us who 
remain at home. 



Just a few verses from the elev- 
enth section of the book of Cove- 
nants. The Lord says, m a reve- 
lation given in May, 1829 : 

"A great and marvelous work is 
about to come forth among the chil- 
dren of men. 

"Behold, I am God, and give heed 
to my word, which is quick and pow- 
erful, sharper than a two-edged sword 
to the dividing asunder of both joints 
and marrow; therefore give heed unto 
my word. 

"Behold, the field is white already 
to harvest, therefore, whoso desireth 
to reap, let him thrust in his sickle 
with his might, and reap while the 
day lasts, that he may treasure up for 
his soul everlasting salvation in the 
kingdom of God; 

"Yea, whosoever will thrust in his 
sickle and reap, the same is called of 
God". 

And reading from the 15th para- 
graph : 

"Behold, I command you, that you 
need not suppose that you are called 
to preach until you are called." 

We read from the scriptures,, 
with reference to authority, that no 
man taketh the honor upon himself, 
but he that is called of God as was 
Aaron. Aaron was called by the 
voice of the Lord, through His 
prophet Moses. This is a principle 
observed in this Church. One of 
the articles of our faith reads, "We 
believe that a man must be called 
of God by 'prophecy and by the lay- 
ing on of hands,' by those who are 
in authority, to preach the Gospel 
and administer in the ordinances 
thereof." 

There are many rnen in Zion who 
have been thus called by the voice 
of the Lord, through His servants 
— the way the Lord has appointed, 
and they have had the hands of the 
servants of the Lord laid upon 
them. They have been blest and

set apart for their particuiar minis- 
try. Take for example the presi- 
dencies of the various stakes of Zi- 
on, the Bishops, and their counsel- 
ors in the various wards throughout 
the Church, and the visiting ward 
Teachers in the labor which they 
are called to perform : they have 
all been called, appointed, ordained, 
blest and set apart for their par- 
ticular labors ; and this responsibil- 
ity rests heavily upon them, and 
many other responsibilities not 
mentioned. 

There are today many of Israel 
being gathered up, coming up to 
Zion of their own accord. We find 
them purchasing homes, farms, and 
business of our people, from one 
end, I was going to say, of this 
state to the other ; yes, an I in other 
states where our people are locat- 
ed. We are selling them our in- 
heritances, in many instances ; and 
some of these people have proven 
to be of the blood of Israel. We 
have converted many of them, but 
I fear that we are not doing our 
full duty in that regard. And it is 
that point that I have in mind to 
impress upon all the people gath- 
ered here this afternoon — not alone 
those whom I have mentioned, these 
officers, but upon all men and wom- 
en in the Church, for the Lord ex- 
empts no one, as I understand the 
reading of the revelation. He ex- 
pects us to find something to do, if 
we have not been specially called. 
I wish now to read a few verses 
from the 58th section of the Book 
of Covenants : 

"For behold, it is not meet that I 
should command in all things, for he 
that is compelled in all things, the 
same is a slothful and not a wise serv- 
ant; wherefore he receiveth no re- 
ward. 

"Verily I say, men should be anx- 



iously engaged in a good cause, and 
do many things of their own free will, 
and bring to pass much righteous- 
ness; 

"For the power is in them, where- 
in they are agents unto themselves. 
And inasmuch as men do good they 
shall in nowise lose their reward. 

"But he that doeth not anything 
until he is commanded, and receiveth 
a commandment with doubtful heart, 
and keepeth it with slothfulness, the 
same is damned." 

The Lord expects us to look 
around and see what can be done 
of our own accord, and devote our- 
selves to such work as we are ca- 
pable and have opportunity of do- 
ing for the salvation of the chil- 
dren of men. Now, one more pas- 
sage, from the 38th section : 

"And again, I say unto you, I give 
unto you a commandment, that every 
man, both elder, priest, teacher, and 
also member, go to with his might, 
with the labor of his hands, to pre- 
pare and accomplish the things which 
I have commanded. 

"And let your preaching be the 
warning voice, every man to his 
neighbor, in mildness and in meek- 
ness." 

Of course, "no power or influ- 
ence can or ought to be maintained 
by virtue of the Priesthood, only 
by persuasion, by long-suffering, 
by gentleness, and meekness, and 
love unfeigned; by kindness, and 
pure knowledge, which shall great- 
ly enlarge the soul without hypoc- 
risy, and without guile." That is 
the spirit in which we are to ex- 
ercise our priesthood and our au- 
thority, and discharge this obliga- 
tion, whether it be abroad, or at 
home. It does seem to me that we 
have here the voice of the Lord, 
all that is necessary in the way of 
authority to justify and place re- 
sponsibility upon every man, be he 
Elder, Priest, Teacher, Deacon, or 
member, to lift his voice in defense

of truth and of righteousness, seek- 
ing opportunity where he can do 
good, allaying prejudice, bringing 
to the knowledge of thos 2 -. who are 
uninformed the revealed word and 
will of the Lord. There are many 
of our people who are diligently 
engaged in this work. When trav- 
eling among them, we discover this 
fact. I would call attention to sev- 
eral instances that have come under 
my observation, and the observa- 
tion of my brethren, in their trav- 
els, which have been reported to us. 
Some few months ago, while I 
was in the Fremont stake of Zion, 
visiting one of the wards, the Bish- 
op reported that during the three 
years of his administration, in con- 
nection with his counselors, the 
ward teachers, and such help as he 
had in that ward, they had been the 
means of bringing into the Church 
twenty adult members. In one of 
the wards in Davis stake, it is re- 
ported that in nine months time, 
by organized, systematic, diligent 
effort, the brethren there had been 
the means of bringing thirteen out 
of the twenty-two non-Mormons in 
that ward into the Church, and oth- 
ers are investigating. And they 
propose to continue their labors. 
President Lyman recently visited 
the Bingham stake, and one of the 
Bishops of a small ward in that 
stake reported that, during the past 
three months, six adults had been 
baptized into the Church. Visiting 
in the Morgan stake, a few weeks 
ago, it was reported by a member 
of the bishopric of one of vhe wards 
that during the past three months 
twenty-one people over ten years of 
age, ranging from fifteen, to thirty, 
several of them married — heads of 
families — had been brought into the 
Church. So these instances might 
be multiplied. 



The thought occurs to me, breth- 
ren and sisters, Bishops and ward 
teachers : If in these wards, by sys- 
tematic, faithful, devoted effort, 
these have been converted and 
brought into the Church, is it not 
possible that there are some of the 
blood of Israel within the limits of 
your wards, of your districts, who 
could be brought, also, to see the 
truth, if you were to do your full 
duty by them? The quorums of 
the Priesthod have all the author- 
ity necessary. Every presidency of 
a quorum have been called, ap- 
pointed, ordained, set apart for 
their labors — not alone to preach 
the Gospel in the world but to min- 
ister at home and in their quorums. 
Do the presidencies of High Priests' 
quorums, or the Presidencies of the 
Seventies' quorums, or the Elders' 
quorums require more authority 
than has been given to them, to en- 
able them to take up the work in 
their own quorums? I think not; 
they have all the authority that is 
necessary; and the responsibility 
accompanies the authority. Yet, 
we find no field, anywhere, that 
might be more fruitful, through the 
diligent labors of faithful men, than 
in these quorums of Priesthood. 
Therein are men who have repent- 
ed of their sins, who have come 
forth and embraced the Gospel ; but 
some have slackened in their ef- 
forts; have neglected to labor, the 
spirit of the Gospel seems to be 
withdrawn from them, <hey are 
without the Spirit of the Lord, and 
are in darkness. We should labor 
with these men. They may have 
indulged in habits which are for- 
bidden, and have acquired these 
habits right under the noses, so to 
speak, and in the presence of the 
presidencies of these quorums. I 
think that these men ought, indeed, 



ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS.

of all men to be watchmen upon 
the towers in Zion, especially to 
the quorums of Priesthood' over 
which they preside. They should 
be so familiar with every member 
of the quorum, by frequent contact 
with them, in conversation, inter- 
viewing them as to their faith and 
their faithfulness in the discharge 
of their duties as quorum members, 
that those members could not devi- 
ate far from the narrow way, the 
path of duty, without being dis- 
covered. And when the discovery 
is made, in the very incipiency of 
these habits, this labor should be 
taken up by those who are in the 
presidency over them, for upon 
them rests responsibility concern- 
ing the life, the faithfulness of their 
members. 

Inasmuch as the Seventies and 
Elders form the foreign ministry 
to a very great extent, they ought 
to be practicing their profession 
while they are at home, for they 
have an ample field in the quorums 
of Priesthood. But, we are told 
in what I have just read, that the 
members, as well, have this respon- 
sibility. They also should preach, 
and their preaching should be the 
warning voice, every man to his 
neighbor. The requirement of this 
Gospel, in respect to the preaching 
of the word, is: "Let every man 
that is warned, warn his neighbor." 
There should be no cowards among 
us. I sometimes think that we neg- 
lect our duty as teachers to our 
fellow men at home, because of 
cowardice. We are not as bold and 
courageous as we might be. There 
may be a cause for this. Perhaps, 
in some of us the testimony of the 
truth is not sufficiently grounded 
into our souls, and, perhaps, our 
course of life is not what it ought 
to be, and this condition closes our 



mouths; it humiliates and embar- 
rasses us when we undertake the 
performance of our duties. So we 
ought to remain as faithful, at 
least, as we were when we came 
into the Church. Our lives should 
be worthy the emulation of all men, 
and thus bring glory to the name 
of the Lord and to His work. If 
we were living thus, the Spirit of 
the Lord would rest upon us, the 
spirit of our callings would attend 
us, and we would be fearless in the 
discharge of our duties, we would 
have love in our hearts for our 
fellowmen, and, if the sense of re- 
sponsibility would not force us to 
do our duty, the love we would 
have burning in our souls for our 
brethren and our sisters, and those 
who come among us, would cause 
us to reach out a helping hand and 
lead thern into the narrow way 
which leads to safety, to salvation 
and to eternal life. 

But notwithstanding all these 
reasons why we ought to be active, 
there is too small a percentage, I 
believe, of the Latter-day Saints, 
who have the true, real missionary 
spirit, even among those who have 
been out in the world and have 
spent two or three years, and later, 
perhaps, duplicated it, in the mis- 
sion field. They come home, and 
some even forget what manner of 
men they ought to be as preachers 
of righteousness, and lose the spir- 
it of missionary work, a thing to 
be regretted. Why, their talents, 
their ability, their memory, every- 
thing sharpened by that missionary 
work, qualifies and equips them to 
do this most necessary work of in- 
dividual missionary labor. There 
is a field broad enough, no one is 
without excuse, and no man, or 
woman, need be jealous of the op- 
portunities afforded his or her

neighbor, for he has all the op- 
portunity of doing good that is 
necessary. 

Now, I would like to impress one 
thought upon your minds, my 
brethren and sisters who preside 
in the stakes and in the wards, in 
the ' quorums and in the auxiliary 
associations : that we be chaper- 
ones, that we be guardians of the 
people, that we, indeed, be fathers 
unto the people, and give unto them 
that which they most need. Let 
us cultivate in ourselves this spir- 
it, a desire to teach, to encourage, 
counsel and advise wherever we 
have opportunity, wherever we see 
that it is needful. I promise you, 
if you engage in this work, it will 
increase your own faith ; it will be 
an anchor to your souls; it will 
bring joy and satisfaction to you, 
and your hope of eternal life will 
be greatly augmented. Thus en- 
gaged, our confidence in the Lord 
will be increased, and also our as- 
surance that our lives will not be 
spent in vain, but that we will ob- 
tain, in the end, the promised bless- 
ing of eternal life. God bless us 
to this end, I pray, in Jesus' name. 
Amen.

The President of the Church and the 
President of the Nation. — God finds 
and qualifies His servants. — The 
power of Presidency. — No officer 
chosen for personal reasons. — An 
abundance of material for the Lord's 
work. — President Taft's "sermon." 
— Christ's doctrine. — A mission of 
Salvation. 

"Our President." I see these 
words confronting me, in letters of 
colossal size ; and I can think of 
no better text for the few remarks 
that I shall make on this occasion. 



The motto hung in the eastern end 
of the Tabernacle was placed there 
in honor of the President of the 
United States, who recently paid 
Utah a visit, and spoke to the as- 
sembled citizens from this stand. 
I desire to refer to him before I 
complete my discourse ; but for the 
present I wish to speak of our oth- 
er President, if he will pardon me 
for being personal in his direction 
— I mean President Joseph F. 
Smith, the leader of the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 

While President Smith "was 
speaking, yesterday morning, with 
such earnestness and power— a 
greater power than any of his breth- 
ren can hope to command and ex- 
ercise — I was reminded of some 
conversations that I had not long 
ago with two of the brethien num- 
bered among the general authori- 
ties of the Church. Each one said, 
in substance, "I would not know 
where to look to find another man 
to lead this Church ; if I should 
survey the land from one end to 
the other, I do not believe I could 
find as good a man, a man as well 
qualified for that position, as Presi- 
dent Joseph F. Smith." I agreed 
with my brethren ; but I thought 
then, and the thought has recurred 
to me now : it is not my business 
to find the President of the Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints ; that is the Lord's business. 
I have full confidence that the Lord 
could find a man to preside over 
this Church at any time, and that 
He would qualify him and equip 
him to the performance of his duty 
to that degree that the people would 
feel, as they feel now towards our 
honored President, that he is the 
right man for his time and place. 

I presume this question arose 
during the lifetime of the Prophet 



ELDER ORSON F. WHITNEY. 



>6 



Joseph Smith,, the first President 
of the Church. Doubtless many of 
the Latter-day Saints the.n asked 
themselves the question: What 
would we do if the Prophet were 
taken away? Where would we find 
another president, another leader? 
The Prophet seemed absolutely in- 
dispensable to his generation; but 
when the Lord saw fit to take him, 
another man arose — up to that time 
not noted, any more tha.i several 
of the brethren with whom he was 
associated. He was a mighty man, 
and they were mighty men. But 
when the mantle of Joseph fell upon 
him, when God had chosen Brig- 
him Young to be His prophet, and 
the Saints had sustained him with 
the uplifted hand and with the 
power of their faith and prayers, 
as their president, where was the 
man in all Israel who could com- 
pare with President Brigham 
Young? He had all the natural 
gifts before he was President that 
he had after he became President; 
but it was not his right, not his pre- 
rogative to exercise the power of 
presidency until it had been duly 
placed upon him, until the people 
had sustained him in that position 
and signified, by their uplifted 
hands, that they proposed to be 
loyal to him, to uphold him and 
make him strong. God chose Brig- 
ham Young and placed the power 
of presidency upon him. That was 
the secret of his might — the secret 
of his success. This is the Lord's 
work, and it is the Lord who makes 
His servants mighty. When Pres- 
ident Young drew near to his end, 
many were asking themselves the 
question : who will take his place ? 
Where is there another man of his 
sagacity, his wisdom, his executive 
ability ? Brigham Young had made 
himself almost indispensable to the 



Latter-day Saints, and in the world, 
among the Gentiles, speculation was 
rife, and predictions were numerous 
to the effect that when Brigham 
Young died Mormonism would be 
at an end. I remember an utter- 
ance of one reverend gentleman 
who never bore the Latter-day 
Saints any good will — Dr. T. De- 
Witt Talmage. In the Brooklyn 
Tabernacle, just after President 
Young died, this reverend gentle- 
man called upon the government to 
strike at Mormonism. "Now is the 
time," he said, "while they are 
scattered and confused, while they 
are without leadership. Now is the ' 
time for the government of the 
United States to strike." On an- 
other occasion he said, "Thunder 
into them the seventh command- 
ment, with shot and shell and can- 
non of the biggest bore." But the 
"confusion" that the reverend gen- 
tleman imagined, did not exist. 
There was no confusion. There 
may have been some question 
as to who was qualified to take 
the place of Brigham Young at the 
head of the Church ; but when John 
Taylor had been sustained as Pres- 
ident, when the people had united 
their prayers in his behalf, and 
God had clothed him with the pow- 
er of the presidency, it was perfect- 
ly apparent to the Latter-day Saints 
that another leader had been pro- 
vided, and that he, from that time, 
would be the strongest and might- 
iest man among them. 

It was the same when President 
Taylor died; it was the same when 
President Woodruff died ; and when 
President Snow passed away, the 
man for the time and place was 
found ; as he always will be. It is 
the Lord's business to find him and 
to qualify him for His work ; and 
the Lord has never failed. This is 



86

my testimony concerning all the 
leaders, of Israel including our hon- 
ored and beloved President Joseph 
F. Smith. 

I remember when the Salt Lake 
Temple was dedicated — Wilford 
Woodruff was then President of 
the Church — Wilford Woodruff, 
that humble man, who did not deem 
himself fitted, if I am correctly in- 
formed, scarcely believed himself 
worthy to be the President, and 
shrunk, in native modesty and hu- 
mility, from presenting himself to 
his brethren as their leader, and 
would fain have retired and had 
some one else hold the reins of 
power. But, when his brethren 
united upon him and sustained him, 
and the people gave their prayers 
and their votes in his behalf, who 
could compare with President Wil- 
ford Woodruff, the Prophet of 
God? I saw him arise, day after 
day, in the dedication services of 
the Temple. There were gifted 
men around him — mighty men, 
strong and capable — but none could 
approach him in power and maj- 
esty. There were times when he 
towered like a mountain among 
hills ; because God was with him, 
and it was not the prerogative of 
any man, while he lived and held 
the reins of authority, to exercise 
the same degree of spiritual power. 

I do not believe, brethren and 
sisters, that the Lord ever exalts 
any man or woman to office for his 
or her own sake. I do not believe 
that I am standing where I stand 
today because of any desire on the 
part of our Heavenly Father to glo- 
rify me, or to glorify my father's 
family; and I do not believe it of 
any of these men, my brethren. I do 
not believe it of President Smith. 
I do not believe it of the Lord — 
that He has pets and favorities, and 



that He is interested in advancing 
the private fortunes of any man. 
He is thinking of His people, of the 
general good, of the salvation of the 
world. When He chooses men and 
women and places His power upon 
them it is because they can better 
be used in the places where He 
puts them, than anywhere else, for 
the general welfare. The reason 
President Smith presides over us, 
and exercises greater power than 
any other man can hope to exercise, 
is because the Lord wants him 
where he is, and can work through 
him there to better advantage than 
through any other man at the pres- 
ent time. I believe this is the prin- 
ciple of promotion in the Church 
of Christ. 

I believe there are just as good 
men down in the ranks as occupy 
high positions — and some strong 
men are needed in the ranks. They 
cannot all be Apostles ; they cannot 
all be High Councilors; they can- 
not all be Bishops; but they can 
all be men of God. I have never 
believed that the all-wise Being 
who made this earth — and who had 
made millions of earths like it, and 
had peopled them, redeemed them, 
and glorified them — would fail to 
provide Himself with enough ma- 
terial to carry on His work. I 
believe there is an abundance of 
material, in the various quorums of 
the Priesthood, and scattered 
through the twelve tribes of Israel 
— an abundance of material out of 
which to make Bishops and Stake 
Presidents and Apostles in the due 
rime of the Lord, according to His 
will. When an ax-handle breaks, 
there is a forest of timber from 
which to select a new one. I do 
not believe that our Heavenly Fath- 
er is impoverished ; that He has left 
Himself without men and without

resources to carry out His great 
and beneficent designs. Therefore, 
we can be comforted , we can afford 
to take an optimistic view, and face 
fhe future with hope and confi- 
dence, knowing that God is at the 
helm, that the right man is at our 
h"ad, and that the right man will 
always be found at the proper time 
and in the proper place. 

I believe, also, that the right man 
is now at the head of this nation. 
I felt honored in being one of the 
congregation that assembled here, 
a week ago yesterday morning, to 
hear our other President deliver his 
so-called sermon to the citizens of 
Utah — Mormon, Jew, and Gentile. 
I rejoice that I have lived to see 
the day when the President of the 
United States could come here as 
the guest of the whole people, and 
speak to the whole people, and be 
the friend to all the people. I be- 
lieve President Taft is the right 
man for the place he occupies, and 
that he is entitled to our friendship 
and sympathy. He has more pow- 
er and more prestige, at this time, 
than any other man throughout the 
nation, — and he has a right to have 
it. There are eighty or ninety mil- 
lions of people praying for him — 
such of them as do pray, at least — 
Democrats as well as Republicans, 
and all others. They are loyal to 
the head of the nation ; and that 
loyalty and love and sympathy can- 
not fail to contribute much toward 
making him our wisest and strong- 
est man in civic affairs. It ought 
to be so, and it is so. I rejoice that 
he is a friend to Utah and to all 
her people, and that Mormons, 
Jews, and Gentiles could assemble 
here on that notable occasion, to 
honor him and receive instructions 
at his hands. 

Now I wish to read two short 



paragraphs of President Taft's so- 
called sermon, based upon the text 
which he chose from Proverbs : "A 
soft answer turneth away wrath, 
but grievous words stir up anger." 
In the course of his remarks, the 
President said : 

"My dear friends, this matter of 
hatred and resentment which ac- 
companies the attributing of bad 
motives to those who differ with 
you, is a source of a waste of nerv- 
ous strength, of time, of worry, 
without accomplishing one single 
good thing. I don't know how it 
has been with you, but it has hap- 
pened, time and time again, with 
me, that some man has done some- 
thing that I didn't like, which I 
thought had a personal bearing, 
and that I have said in my heart, 
'Times will change, and I will get 
even with that gentleman ;' — O, I 
don't profess to be free from those 
feelings at all — but it has frequent- 
ly happened, I may say generally, 
that the time did come when I could 
get even with that man, and when 
that time came, it seemed to me that 
I would demean myself and that it 
would show me no man at all, if I 
took advantage." 

Later on he said : 

"So, my friends, what I am urg- 
ing is less acrimony in public dis- 
cussion, more charity with respect 
to each other, as to what moves 
each man to do what he does do, 
and not to charge dishonesty and 
corruption until you have a real 
reason for doing so. I am the last 
man to pardon or mitigate wrongs 
against the public or against the in- 
dividual. I believe, and I regret to 
say, that throughout this country 
the administration of the criminal 
law, and the prosecution of crime, 
is a disgrace to our civilization. 
But it is one thing to prosecute a

criminal when you have the evi- 
dence, and it is another thing "to 
ascribe motives to an act of a man, 
when you have not any evidence 
and are just living in your imag- 
ination in respect to what you say." 
I am not going to waste time in 
any speculations as to how much 
of this sermon was intended for the 
Mormons and how much of it for 
the Gentiles. I think it was in- 
tended for me; I think President 
Taft meant me — I saw him look- 
ing at me when he said it. (Laugh- 
ter) ; and I saw him loking at you, 
too; and he meant you, every one 
of you that was here, and a great 
many more that were not here. 
Speaking for myself, brethren and 
sisters, I want to say that I am in 
full and hearty sympathy with these 
noble sentiments uttered by the 
Chief Magistrate of the Republic. 
I desire {o be charitable to my 
brethren and sisters and to my fel- 
low-men. I don't want to live in 
my imagination as to their motives 
and their acts. I don't want to 
think my neighbor a worse man 
than he is ; I want to be just to him, 
and I desire, also, to be merciful. I 
believe this to be in consonance 
with the principles that our Savior 
died to introduce. The mission of 
Christ would have been a failure if 
it had not been a mission of love, of 
forgiveness, of charity to all man- 
kind; and Mormonism, as it is 
called, is no more nor less than the 
Gospel of Christ. It teaches us to 
be charitable to all men. It teach- 
es us to return good for evil — not 
to retaliate. If we get a man into 
a corner who has injured us, we 
cannot afford to condescend to his 
level, and treat him as he has treat- 
ed us. We ought to do unto others 
as we would that they should do 
unto us. That is Christ's doctrine. 



President Taft was but paraphras-. 
ing the Savior's teachings upon this 
point. To love God with all our 
might, mind, and strength, and to 
love our neighbor as ourselves — 
upon these two commandments 
hang all the law and the prophets; 
and that man or woman who can- 
not forgive, who seeks revenge and 
has no higher conception of duty 
than to cherish hatred and practice 
retaliation — has a small soul and 
needs to have it expanded and en- 
larged by the Spirit of Christ. We 
cannot afford to descend to base 
levels. We are here to save men ; 
we have been chosen and sent into 
the world for this purpose, and we 
must show men that we love them 
— not their wickedness ; God does 
not love the wickedness of the 
world, but He loves His sons and 
daughters, and is anxious to save 
them. He is not trying to damn a 
single soul. Our mission is a mis- 
sion of peace, of charity, of for- 
giveness, and love; and the Gospel 
that we preach and try to practice 
is the power of God unto salvation. 
Amen.

Yesterday morning when our 
President suggested to this vast as- 
semblage that they move nearer to- 
gether in their seats, in order to 
give brethren and sisters who were 
standing a little room to sit down, 
there was a universal movement 
throughout this tabernacle. It was 
surprising to those who could look

over the audience, to see how just 
a little one-sixteenth of an inch, 
multiplied by probably ten thou- 
sand, made room for so many peo- 
ple. There was a universal re- 
sponse to that suggestion. Some 
were unable to give even the six- 
teenth of an inch, but they wiggled 
all the same. (Laughter). I 
thought, why cannot all Israel re- 
spond as readily to his suggestion 
to guard well their children. We 
can move ever so little, perhaps; 
but let us move and do something 
to improve the environment into 
which our children are thrown. 

"Suffer little children, and forbid 
them not, to come unto me: for of 
such is the kingdom of heaven." 
How many times, dear parents, has 
God visited your homes and given 
into your charge one of these prec- 
ious souls? Did you hear, at each 
visit, the Savior's words : Suffer 
this little babe to come back to me, 
and forbid him not; for of such is 
the kingdom of heaven ? 

Last evening, about five o'clock, 
four brethren were riding down 
Main Street in an automobile. Just 
as they passed First South Street, 
they heard a little plaintive cry, 
"Papa ! papa ! papa ! wait." The 
father was the chauffeur, and his 
ready ear recognized his son's voice. 
He brought the machine instantly to 
a standstill. As the men looked 
out the}' saw coming out of that 
bustling, jostling crowd of human- 
ity, a little nine-year-old boy, out of 
breath, panting, crying, because of 
his effort to overtake the machine, 
which he had spied going along 
Main Street, to get to h's father. 
The father said, "Why, where have 
you been, my son?" "I have been 
looking for you." "Well did you 
leave the place where we appointed 
to meet?" "Yes, I went up to see 



where you were." He understood 
that he was to meet up here, in front 
of the tabernacle. The father evi- 
dently meant to meet the child 
farther down the street. Through a 
misunderstanding, however, the son 
had become separated from his par- 
ent, and the little child was thrown 
into that vast throng, unprotected. 
He knew his way home ; he was 
safe. If he had missed his father, 
he would have taken the street car 
and, probably before the shades of 
night closed in upon him, he would 
be safely nestled with father and 
mother and brothers and sisters in 
one of the most cheerful homes in 
this city. 

I believe that illustrates the key- 
note of warning that was sounded 
to us Sunday morning. Fathers, is 
there a misunderstanding between 
you and your sons? Is there one 
wandering amidst the throngs of 
life, surrounded with all kinds of 
temptations, and you expecting to 
meet him at an appointed place 
which he does not know? He may 
not come out from that throng and 
cry, "Father, father!" and if he 
should, your ears might be deaf to 
that call, because of the concentra- 
tion of your mind upon the affairs 
of life. So you might speed by him 
and leave him in the midst of evil, 
to find his own way home. Take 
your sons with you along this road 
of life, that you may have them 
with you in that eternal home where 
there is everlasting peace and con- 
tentment. When our children are 
given us, and that admonition "Suf- 
fer them to come back to Me" is 
given, three means of developing 
them are at hand : The first is 
home influence; the second, activ- 
ities — avenues of action, including 
vocations and avocations; and third, 
social environment. In all three of 



90 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



these there must be the predomin- 
ating element of salvation — I mean, 
now, physically, intellectually, spir- 
itually. And what is it? Work. 
Work in the- home. Work; legiti- 
mate work, in the avenues of life. 
Work, legitimate work in the so- 
cial world. 

Of work in the home I shall say 
nothing this afternoon. We have 
had excellent sermons on home life ; 
and we shall hear more. The im- 
portance of home, as. a saving influ- 
ence, not only of children but of 
communities and of the nation, we 
fully realize, I believe ; and it is 
well we do, for today some edu- 
cators in our leading universities 
are saying that the home, as an in- 
stitution, is doomed. Put that doc- 
trine with some of the doctrines 
that we heard this morning edu- 
cators are preaching, and see if 
we had better not guard well our 
children from some of the so-called 
educational theories of the day. Our 
homes are homes of salvation. 
Home is the safeguard of the na- 
tion. 

I desire to say a word about work 
as a means, I say, of salvation to 
the individual. Work! O how of- 
ten do we read in the scriptures 
about the blessings that come from 
doing. Eternal life rests upon the 
knowledge of God and His Son 
Jesus Christ. Now, note it, "This 
is life eternal, to know Thee the 
only true God and Jesus Christ 
whom Thou hast sent." How do 
you get that knowledge? In an- 
other place He says, "If any man 
will do His will, he shall know of 
the doctrine, whether it be of God, 
or whether I speak of myself." 
There you have the doing, the work, 
associated with the knowledge, and 
knowledge bringing eternal life — 



"To know Thee is eternal life." To 
do is to know. 

In our physical being there is no 
development, there is no growth, 
without activity; in the intellectual 
world there is no advancement 
without effort, work; and in the 
spiritual world, in the development 
of our spirits, there is no growth 
without effort. There is no salva- 
tion without work. I do not mean, 
now, redemption from death — 
Christ has done that; He has given 
us all that we need to get by way 
of salvation. The doctrine of work 
does not rob Him of any of His 
glory. "By grace are ye saved, 
through faith, and that not of your- 
selves, it is a gift of God." But 
aside from that, the individual 
growth and advancement, the indi- 
vidual knowledge, the advancement 
in God's truth, depends upon the 
doing of God's will. Let us teach 
ourselves that; let us teach our 
children and give them something 
to do ; let them know the sin of idle- 
ness. 

Joseph Smith, the prophet, has 
repeatedly given us the assurance 
that God will not support the idler, 
that the idler has no place in this 
Church. The children should know 
it — O these young men, some of 
whom belong to us, who are look- 
ing forward to a life of ease, to 
clean clothes, soft white hands — the 
result, they think of leisure or of 
wealth ! I say, these young men 
should be warned of the danger of 
that kind of life. I have here an 
admonition from Hugo, given by a 
supposed reformed criminal to a 
young man who had just started out 
on a criminal career. I will read 
it: 

"My boy, you are entering, by sloth, 
into the most laborious of existences. 
Ah! You declare yourself an idler; 



ELDER DAVID 0. McKAY. 



91 



then prepare yourself for labor. Have 
you ever seen a formidable machine 
which is called a flatting-press? You 
must be on your guard against it, for 
it is a crafty and ferocious thing, and 
if it catch you by the skirt of the coat 
it drags you under it entirely. This 
machine is indolence. Stop while there 
is yet time, and save yourself. Other- 
wise, it is all over with you, and ere 
long you will be among the cog- 
wheels. Once caught, hope for noth- 
ing more. You will be forced to fa- 
tigue yourself, idler, ana no rest will 
be allowed you, for the iron hand of 
implacable toil has seized you. You 
refuse to earn your livelihood, — have 
a calling and accomplish' a duty; it 
bores you to be like the rest: well, you 
will be different. Labor is the law, 
and whoever repulses it as a bore 
must have it as a punishment: You 
do not wish to be a laborer, and you 
will be a slave; toil only lets you loose 
on one side to seize you again on the 
other; you do not wish to be its 
friend, and you will be its negro. Ah, 
you did not care for the honest fa- 
tigue of men, and you are about to 
know the sweat of the damned; while 
others sing you will groan. You will 
see other men working in the dis- 
tance, and they will seem to you to be 
resting. The laborer, the reaper, the 
sailor, the blacksmith, will appear to 
you in the light, like the blessed in- 
mates of a paradise. What a radiance 
there is in the anv : l! What a joy it is 
to guide the plow, and tie up the 
sheaf! What a holiday to fly before 
the wind in a boat! But you, idler, 
will have to dig and rag, and roll and 
walk! Pull at your halter, for you are 
a beast of burden in the service of 
hell! So your desire is to do nothing? 
Well, you will not have a week, a day, 
an hour without feeling crushed. You 
will not be able to lift anything with- 
out agony, and every passing minute 
will make your muscles crack. What 
is a feather for others will be a rock 
for you, and the most simple things 
will grow seamed. Life will become 
a monster around you, and coming, 
going, breathing, will be so many ter- 
rible tasks for you. 

"What precipices are sloth and 
pleasure! To do nothing is a melan- 
choly resolution, are you aware of 
that? To live ; n indolence on the so- 
cial substance! to be useless, that is to 



say, injurious! This leads straight to 
the bottom of misery. 

"Woe to the man who wishes to be 
a parasite, for he will be a vermin! 
Ah! it does not please you to work! 
Ah! you have only one thought, to 
drink well, eat well, and sleep well. 
You will drink water; you will eat 
black bread; you will sleep on a plank, 
with fetters riveted to your limbs, and 
feel their coldness at night in your 
flesh! You will break these fetters 
and fly; very good. You will drag 
yourself on your stomach into the 
shrubs and eat grass like the beasts of 
the field, and you will pass years in a 
dungeon, chained to the wall, groping 
in the dark for your water jug, biting 
at frightful black bread which dogs 
would refuse, and eating beans which 
maggots have eaten before you. .You 
will be a woodlouse in a cellar. Ah! 
Ah! take a pity on yourself, wretched 
boy, still so young, who were at your 
nurse's breast not twenty years ago, 
and have doubtless a mother still! I 
implore you to listen to me. You will 
want fine black cloth, polished shoes, 
to scent your head with fragrant oil, 
to please creatures, and be a pretty 
fellow; you will have your hair close 
shaven and wear a red jacket and 
wooden shoes. You want a ring on 
your finger, and will wear a collar on 
your neck, and if you look at a woman 
you will be beaten. And you will go 
in there at twenty and come out at 
fifty years of age. You will go in 
young, red-cheeked, healthy, with 
your sparkling eyes, and all your 
white teeth, and your curly locks, and 
you will come out again broken, bent, 
wrinkled, toothless, horrible, and 
gray-headed! Ah! my poor boy, you 
are on the wrong road, and indolence 
is a bad adviser, for robbery is the 
hardest of labors. Take my advice and 
do not undertake the laborious task 
of being an idler. To become a rogue 
is inconvenient, and it is not nearly so 
hard to be an honest man. Now go 
and think over what I have said to 
you." 

In social environment may be in- 
cluded all our Church influences. 
As I look at the orzanization, given 
through the Prophet Joseph Smith 
to the world in this dispensation; 



92 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



as I occasionally catch a glimpse of 
the possibilities of the quorums and 
organizations in this Church, I feel 
to exclaim, O Lord, my God, how 
marvelous are Thy works ! "Great 
is Thy wisdom, marvelous are Thy 
ways ! and the extent of Thy do- 
ings none can find out I" The or- 
ganization of the Church is so per- 
fect that every man, woman and 
child within the Church can find 
something to do ; and therein de- 
pends the advancement of the per- 
son's spiritual welfare. He has a 
chance to work in the Church of 
Christ, no matter how young a boy 
or how old a man. Now, think, 
what that means. You go over, in 
your minds, the organizations as 
revealed to us in this dispensation. 
Go first from the First Presidency, 
down through the Twelve, the High 
Priests, the Seventy, Elders, Priests, 
Teachers, and Deacons, all that line 
of Priesthood. See that mighty 
army of men, ready to do — what? 
Called upon to do what? To work 
for the Lord. We heard, this after- 
noon, that not one of those men 
have been called to the position to 
honor him, but he has been called 
into the service of the Lord. What 
does it mean ? It means work ; 
work means knowledge ; knowledge 
means eternal life. O, brethren and 
sisters, shall we not, as parents, put 
our boys and girls into that envir- 
onment? If we do not, are we not 
unmindful of the call of Christ to 
suffer the children to come back to 
Him? Are we negligent as par- 
ents, in seeing that our boys as 
deacons go to these quorum meet- 
ings? Are we negligent, as par- 
ents, and fail to see that our daugh- 
ters get to their auxiliary meetings ? 
Think of it. The note has been 
sounded; are we going to move? 
Presidents of quorums : The Lord 



has said to you, as you will read 
in the 107th section of the Doctrine 
and Covenants, that it is your duty 
to meet with your quorum. If you 
are the president of a deacon's quor- 
um, you are to meet with twelve 
deacons, and preside over them, to 
sit in counsel with them, and to 
teach them their duties. O, dea- 
cons, throughout the world! re- 
spond to that call. Do your duty, 
Bishops, you who hold the presi- 
dency of the Aaronic Priesthood ; 
guide the young men in this activ- 
ity. Are they slothful? Are they 
inactive? If they are, some of the 
results of inactivity mentioned be- 
fore as befalling the idle individual 
will afflict the quorum in your ward. 
Mark it, it will not fulfill its place 
in the councils of the Church, un- 
less it be active as a council, as a 
quorum. This is true of the Teach- 
ers, of the Priests, the Elders, the 
Seventies, the High Priests, and all. 
I remember visiting, recently, the 
sugar factory, in Sugar City, Idaho. 
Brother Austin took me through it 
when every wheel was quiet ; the 
engine was cold ; the chimneys 
stood like specters ; the wheels were 
dry and covered with dust ; the spar- 
rows were building their nests in 
wheels that a few months before 
hummed with industry. Men had 
to be hired to keep the dust off the 
machinery, to make repairs, to keep 
the factory from going into decay. 
I thought, that is always the result 
of inactivity. No sugar was manu- 
factured in that inactivity. There 
were no laborers employed, except 
those hired to keep the factory from 
going into absolute decay. But 
when the power was turned on, then 
raw products were changed to use- 
ful articles, which are carried into 
the homes, throughout the world. 
Sometimes part of the machinery is 



ELDER DAVID 0. McKAY. 



93 



shut up, closed down, and only one 
part — that of refining — used. I 
sometimes think that in our Church 
we are using just part of the mach- 
inery that God has placed in our 
hands. So many of these quorums 
are lying in inactivity; dust is ac- 
cumulating. Shall we not work and 
get them into prominence, bring 
them into operation ? As presidents 
of quorums, let us meet in council; 
let us think over what men in our 
quorums are neglecting their duty. 
In 1899, in one of the Elders quor- 
ums in this city, three young men 
were called to preside. At their 
first meeting there were only six 
men present in the Elders quorum. 
"Well," they said, "this will not do ; 
let us institute systematic visiting." 
And so they did. Those men, as 
presidents, carrying the responsibil- 
ity, went out to visit the Elders of 
that quorum. They went into one 
house, and asked the man to take 
up Elder's work, but he said, "No, 
I will not go to Elders meeting." 
"May we have a meeting here to- 
night?" was asked. "Yes." They 
sang, prayed, spent ah hour or so 
with the man and his wife. At the 
conclusion of it, the man promised 
that he would attend Elders' meet- 
ing. The wife, who was uncon- 
verted, and who knew little or noth- 
ing of the workings of the Church, 
who lacked a knowledge of it, be- 
cause of inactivity, began to cry be- 
cause her husband's going to meet- 
ing would take him away from 
home. "A mission will be next," 
she said. However, that young 
man promised to go to meeting on 
this condition ; that he would not 
be asked to take part. "All right," 
said the brethren. But it was not 
long before he was willing to take 
part on the program. They as- 
signed him a subject, and the broth- 



er who told me of this incident, said 
it was painful to see what that poor 
man suffered the first time he stood 
up before his brethren. Those in 
the meeting deeply sympathized 
with the man who was making his 
first effort in public. At the conclu- 
sion of it the brother said, "You 
did well. "No," said the man, "I 
want another chance ; I believe I can 
do better." He did do better, and 
he became a strong power in influ- 
encing other Elders of his crowd 
to come out to their meetings. 

They went into another home and 
met a similar spirit of indifference. 
They asked permission to pray, and 
were told "No." They talked to the 
man a little while, and finally he 
said, "Well, you may kneel down 
and pray, if you want to." "Will 
you kneel with us?" "No." After 
a little kind persuasion, he knelt 
down. At the conclusion of the 
meeting in that home, this second 
Elder, following the brethren to 
the door, broke down and cried, 
confessed that he had been out away 
from the influence of the Church, 
had been in another environment, 
and said, "Keep with me, work with 
me, and help me to get back into 
Church environment." The presi- 
dent of that Elder's quorum is now 
siting on this stand, a member of 
the presiding bishopric. He and his 
fellow-workers increased the atten- 
dance of the quorum from six to 
over one hundred during that year. 

There is a practical example of 
doing. What was accomplished in 
this Elder's quorum in this city can 
be done throughout the entire 
Church. My brethren and sisters, 
the quorums and organizations are 
means put into our hands whereby 
we may bring our children back to 
Christ. "Suffer them to come." 
God help us in guiding chem, and

may He keep us true; that we may 
increase our own testimonies in this 
work; that we may know of its eter- 
nal application to our needs; that 
we may know what happiness comes 
through living virtuous, pure lives. 
Let us take up our children and 
carry them with us, along this road 
of life. No other purpose of life is 
more worthy, more admirable. Let 
us teach them to work, and to rea- 
lize that the privilege to work is a 
gift, that power to work is a bless- 
ing, that love to work is success. 
Amen. 



The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn : 

Our God, we raise to Thee 
Thanks for Thy blessings free 

We here enjoy; 
In this far western land, 
A true and chosen band, 
Led hither by Thy hand, 

We sing for joy. 

Benediction was pronounced by 
Patriarch Joseph E. Taylor. 

Conference adjourned until 10 a. 
m. Wednesday, October 6th. 



THIRD DAY. 



Wednesday, Oct. 6th, 10 a. m. 

Conference was called to order by 
President Joseph F. Smith. 

The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn: 

Come, let us anew our journey pursue, 

Roll round with the year, 
And never stand still till the Master 

appear. 
His adorable will let us gladly fulfil, 

And our talents improve, 
By the patience of hooe and the labor 
of love. 

Prayer was offered by Elder 
Samuel E. Woolley. 

The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn: 

'Guide us, O Thou great Jehovah, 
Lead us to the promised land, 
We are weak, but Thou art able — 
Hold us with Thy powerful hand. 

Holy Spirit, , 
Feed us till the Savior comes. 



ELDER ANTHONY W. IVINS. 

Fulfillment of the Lord's promises. — 
Saints should love and serve the 
Lord with all their heart. — The sec- 
ond great commandment. — Other 
commandments. — Proper observance 
of the Sabbath. — Evils should be up- 
rooted. 

"Behold, blessed, saith the Lord, 
are they who have come up unto 
this land with an eye single to my 
glory, according to my command- 
ments." 

The proceedings of this confer- 
ence, this large congregation of 



Latter-day Saints who are assem- 
bled here this morning, have 
brought very forcibly to my mind 
the word of the Lord as it is con- 
tained in this 59th section of the 
book of Doctrine and Covenants, 
from which I have read ; and I feel 
like re-iterating those words : 

"Behold, blessed, saith the Lord, are 
they who have come up unto this land 
with an eye single to my glory, ac- 
cording to my commandments; 

"For they that live shall inherit the 
earth, and they that die shall rest 
from all their labors, and their works 
shall follow them, and they shall re- 
ceive a crown in the mansions of ray 
Father, which I have prepared for 
them." 

These are promises of very great 
value to us, my brethren and sis- 
ters; and I want to ask you, this 
morning, if you and I are not living 
witnesses of the fulfillment of this 
word of the Lord, so far as it ap- 
plies to us who live? We are here 
in the enjoyment of the blessings 
which have been showered upon us 
in this goodly land, and it is of 
great importance to us to know, as 
we do know, because of the revela- 
tions of the Lord to the Church, 
that those who are not here, those 
who have died, having kept invio- 
late the covenants that they entered 
into with the Lord, do rest from 
their labors, that their works do fol- 
low them, and that they have gone 
to those mansions prepared for the 
righteous by our Father who is in 
heaven.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



"Yea, blessed are they whose feet 
stand upon the land of Zion, who have 
obeyed my gospel, for they shall re- 
ceive for their reward the good things 
of the earth; and it shall bring forth 
in its strength; 

"And they shall also be crowned 
with blessings from above, yea, and 
with commandments not a few ; and 
with revelations in their time: they 
that are faithful and diligent before 
me." 

My brethren and sisters, you 
Latter-day Saints who have gath- 
ered up here to the valleys of these 
mountains, from among the differ- 
ent nations of the earth — you peo- 
ple from Scandinavia, from Eng- 
land, from Ireland, from Wales, 
and from Scotland, you German 
saints, you people from the moun- 
tains of Switzerland — I want to 
ask you if the Lord has not made 
good these promises, if He has not 
blest you with the good things of 
the earth ; if you have not received 
revelations in their time ; if your 
faith has not been strengthened, 
your confidence waxed strong in 
the Lord, and if you do not now 
stand firmly convinced that every 
word spoken by the mouths of His 
servants, the prophets, will be veri- 
fied and fulfilled? 

It seems to me that I see so clear- 
ly the verification of this word of 
the Lord, that there can be no doubt 
but that He has gathered this peo- 
ple together. Nothing like it has 
ever been undertaken before in the 
history of the world. Nothing will 
ever be accomplished like it again ; 
for this is a day of restoration, a 
day for the redemption of Israel, 
a day when the Lord's people are 
to be gathered together, a day when 
He will manifest His power among 
them, a day when He will consum- 
mate all things spoken by His ser- 
vants, the prophets ; and we see the 
verification of these things. Now, 



there is something more attached 
to this : these promises do not come 
to us except that we fulfill the re- 
quirements of the law. These bless- 
ings to which I have referred, 
promised by the Lord, are given 
to us upon these conditions : 
"Wherefore I give unto them a 
commandment," (as the Lord al- 
ways commands, and as there are 
always conditions incident to every 
blessings that emanates from Him) 
"I give unto them a commandment, 
thou shalt love the Lord thy God 
with all thy heart, with all thy 
might, mind, and strength ; and in 
the name of Jesus Christ thou shalt 
serve Him." This is the first great 
commandment. It applies to every 
one of us. The Lord expects us — ■ 
because of His blessings, because 
of the great and marvelous work 
which He has set His hand to ac- 
complish, and which He is accom- 
plishing — to recognize Him, to love 
Him with all our hearts. And if 
we love the Lord, we will serve 
Him. It is not they who say "Lord, ' 
Lord," who shall enter into the 
kingdom of heaven ; but they who 
do the will of the Father ; they are 
they who shall enter into His rest. 
It is not sufficient that we acknowl- 
edge allegiance to the Lord, but 
that we give Him our hearts; and 
if we give Him our hearts, we 
keep His commandments ; we show 
our love, we show our appreciation 
by yielding homage, obedience and 
service to Him whom we acknowl- 
edge as our Creator. We do this 
in the name of Jesus Christ His 
Son, the Redeemer of the world, 
our advocate with the Father, He 
who came in the meridian of time 
and took upon Him the sins of the 
world ; whose blood was shed that 
we might be redeemed and thus 
brought back into the presence of 



ELDER ANTHONY W. IV1NS. '

God. Because of the sacrifice which 
He made, He became the first fruits 
of the resurrection from the dead ; 
and He made that sacrifice that we, 
likewise, might be heirs not only to 
eternal life in the presence of God, 
our Heavenly Father, but of physi- 
cal resurrected life, through the re- 
demption which He wrought out. 
Thus He is our advocate with the 
Father ; through Him the blessings 
of the Father come to us ; and if we 
please the Lord we not only love 
Him with all our hearts, we not 
only keep His commandments, we 
not only worship Him, but we rec- 
ognize His Son as our advocate 
with the Father, and through Him 
we approach the throne of grace. 
Christ was asked what was the first 
great commandment. He said : 
"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God, 
with all thy heart, and with all thy 
soul, and with all thy mind." Then 
He said that there is another great 
commandment which is very nigh 
unto it, which approaches chat, the 
most important of all command- 
ments, which is that you shall love 
your neighbor as you love yourself. 
So the Lord has reiterated to us 
this other great commandment, 
"Thou shalt love thy neighbor as 
thyself." It is frequently suggest- 
ed that this — in our condition, 
clothed upon with mortality, as we 
are — is not possible. I believe, my 
brethren and sisters, that the Lord 
has made no requirements of us, 
no requirement of any of His chil- 
dren, which is not possible of ac- 
complishment; and so I fully be- 
lieve that it is just as empty for a 
man to say that he loves God, and 
manifest in his life his utter lack 
of affection, his lack of love, his 
lack of consideration for his fellow- 
man, as it is to say that he loves 
God and then violate His command- 



ments. If the love of God is in 
our hearts, if we have been born 
again, we love human kind; we 
love our neighbor; and if we love 
our neighbor, we seek to do to him 
as we would that he shouid do unto 
us. Upon this hangs the law and 
the prophets. 

I believe that this doctrine may 
be better understood by the Latter-- 
day Saints ; I believe that greater 
consideration may be had for our 
fellow ; I believe that we can show 
greater interest in his welfare, 
greater love for him, greater re- 
spect for him in his place and in 
his station. But, mark you, there 
is nothing in the word of the Lord 
which indicates that this love of 
our feHow, of our neighbor, shall 
extend to the extent that we justify 
him in wrong-doing, that we join 
with him in that which is evil. We 
stand squarely opposed to this, for 
it is not love that prompts one to in- 
dulge his fellow, his brother, his 
sister, his wife, his son or daughter 
in that which is wrong. Love may 
be as destructive, when it leads to 
indulgence, as it may be beneficial 
when its restraining influence is ex- 
ercised over those with whom we 
are surrounded. So, while I would 
respect my neighbor in his rights, 
in his opinions, the Lord does not 
require me to in any way indorse, 
to in any way approve of the evil 
that may be in his life. On the 
contrary I am expected to use my 
influence, my example, my words 
for his reformation. For to love 
mankind, or to love God, or to love 
righteousness is to adhere to that 
which is right and refrain from do- 
ing that which is evil. I would that 
this love for our fellows might be 
established in the heart of every 
Latter-day Saint. 

Now, there are some other things 



98 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



here which the Lord requires of 
us : "Thou shalt not lie" — a very 
important admonition ; for what can 
be more disreputable than a liar. 
To lie is not simply to speak that 
which is untrue ; it is not to say 
"yes" when we mean "no," and 
"no" when we mean "yes." A man 
may conscientiously, be in error ; he 
may adhere to that which is wrong ; 
but if he does it with the thought 
that it is right, he is true before 
the Lord. Better such a man than 
he who for his own personal gain 
or interest, and against his own 
conscience, adheres to the right — 
a hypocrite before the Lord, and 
untruthful in his life before the peo- 
ple. 

"Thou shalt not steal" — not take 
that which belongs to another. The 
Lord requires that we should live 
by the sweat of our brow ; that with 
the labor of our own hands we 
should acquire the necessities of 
life. Men may steal by other means 
than by going in the dark hours 
of the night and appropriating that 
which belongs to their neighbors ; 
they may steal by other means than 
holding one up upon the public 
highway. Whenever we take that 
which belongs to another, by un- 
fair means, by misrepresentation 
of facts, we take that which does 
not belong to us ; and the Lord is 
not pleased with us. He is not 
pleased with that which we acquire 
by any other means except those 
honest, honorable, truthful means 
that are provided, by which we have 
clear conscience before Got 1 and be- 
fore the world. I wish this truth 
could be impressed upon the heart 
of every Latter-day Saint. We are 
living in an age when — you will all 
agree with me — to a certain extent, 
it is regarded as honorable to ac- 
quire means by methods which, crit- 



ically examined, cannot be approved 
of; they are not honest. No man 
has a right to promote any enter- 
prise, any industry that is not based 
upon principles which give reason- 
able hope and success. A man who 
goes out canvassing for things that 
he knows to be without value, tak- 
ing away from the people their 
hard-earned means, places himself 
very nearly, I will say, upon a level 
with the man who goes in the dark- 
ness of the night and appropriates 
to his own use that which belongs 
to his neighbor. 

"You shall not commit adultery." 
The Lord requires the Latter-day 
Saints — you people whom He has 
blest, in your coming up here to 
these valleys of the mountains — 
to be pure in your lives ; that your 
morality may be above reproach ; 
that you may keep yourselves un- 
spotted from the sins of the world. 
This is one of the conditions which 
He imposes, in this revelation, and 
upon which He predicates the 
abundance of His blessings to the 
Latter-day Saints. 

Now, my brethren ind sisters, I 
come to that portion c* this reve- 
lation, to which I desire, more par- 
ticularly, to call your attention : 

"And that thou ma"-\~.t .nore fully 
keep thyself unspottej . rom tl.s world, 
thou shalt •"- to the house of prayer 
and offer up thy sacraments upon my 
holy day; 

"For verily this is a day appointed 
unto you to rest from your labors, 
and to pa->r thy devotions unto the 
Most High; 

"Nevertheless thy vows shall be of- 
fered up in righteousness on all days 
and at all times; 

"But remember that on this the 
Lord's day, thou shalt offer thine ob- 
lations and thy sacraments unto the 
Most High, confessing thy sins un- 
to thy brethren, and before the Lord." 

My brethren and sisters, if there

is one thing more than another that 
these presidents need to take back 
into the different stakes, over which 
they preside ; that these Bishops 
need to teach in the wards over 
which they preside; that you El- 
ders of Israel need to teach by pre- 
cept and example in the communi- 
ties of Latter-day Saints, it is a 
righteous observance of the Sab- 
bath day — a day hallowed and 
made sacred and holy by the Lord, 
for His worship, not a day of pleas- 
ure, not a day for excursions into 
the canyons, not a day for automo- 
bile rides into the country, not a 
day for baseball games on the pub- 
lic square, not a day for horse- 
races in the park, not a day when 
the Lord is forgotten and the pleas- 
ures of the world sought ; but a day 
when God requires His people to 
gather together and partake of the 
sacrament, acknowledging their al- 
legiance to Him and His Son, and 
entering into covenants with Him 
that they will keep His command- 
ments. It is not a day when repre- 
sentative men of the Church, who 
may be in New York, or in Chi- 
cago, or in Los Angeles, shall seek 
pleasure while the Latter-day 
Saints, who are there, are met to- 
gether to partake of the sacrament 
and bear testimony to each other 
of the goodness of the Lord. They 
ought to be there in the congre- 
gations of the Latter-day Saints, at 
home or abroad, or wherever a 
branch of the Church exists ; and 
if no branch at all exists, we may 
still pay our devotions to the Lord, 
remembering Him, acknowledging 
our allegiance to Him, upon this 
sacred day. 

Now, my brethren and sisters, 
these are fundamental doctrines of 
the Church, every one of them, un- 
changeable. We cannot please the 



Lord except we observe them. We 
must acknowledge the Lord; we 
must acknowledge His Son as the 
Savior of the world; we must love 
our neighbor; we must be truth- 
ful ; we must be honest ; we must be 
virtuous. We have been preaching 
these doctrines from the very incep- 
tion of the Church; and, thank the 
Lord, we have made headway in 
this work ; thank the Lord, the great 
majority of the people believe and 
practice these doctrines ; but there 
is still room for reform. Now, we 
are taught these things by two 
methods : in the first place, the 
Gospel of Christ admonishes us to 
serve the Lord because we love Him 
— to do it without coercion, to do 
it voluntarily. This is His law to 
us. He loves every one of us, but 
He wishes us to exercise our own 
judgment, to follow after our own 
consciences in these things ; He 
does not restrain us. We wish that 
every man and woman in the world 
were converted to well-doing, and 
voluntarily and without coercion 
yield allegiance to these eternal 
laws, but they will not do it. Know- 
ing this, and realizing the import- 
ance of restraining men in the will- 
ful exercise of their passions, which 
are evil, civil laws are provided 
which do restrain us, which do gov- 
ern these things. I stand here this 
morning and advocate the right- 
eousness of these laws. I believe 
that it is the right of the people to 
frame such laws in civil govern- 
ment, as will restrain crime, re- 
strain that which is evil ; and if men 
and women will not, of their own 
volition, adhere to the word of the 
Lord, they must be restrained. So, 
if it were in my power, I would see 
today that these evils which menace 
us are struck down, in the proper 
spirit, by the hand of the law. Down

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



upon the table-lands of northern 
Mexico, where I have lived, scat- 
tered here and there among the 
luxurious grasses which grow, 
there is a noxious weed, a weed 
which, ordinarily, a horse will not 
touch. At first he shuns it, but 
after a while, having grazed near 
it, having rubbed his nose against 
it and become better acquainted 
with it, he tastes it. Later he ac- 
quires an appetite for it, and it saps 
his strength ; it affects his intellect ; 
it makes him crazy — we say in 
Spanish "loco;" he becomes a lo- 
coed horse. Well, we found out 
that by keeping our horses in the 
stable all the time, we could keep 
them away from that weed ; they 
did not get it ; but it is a very diffi- 
cult and inconvenient thing to al- 
ways keep horses in the stable. They 
want the open air ; they want the 
green grass which grows upon the 
hills ; and we had to deprive them 
of all this, just simply because here 
and there on the hill, grew this 
noxious weed. We found a rem- 
edy; we turned out with hoes. We 
traveled over the hills, and we dug 
up the weed by the roots ; then 
we turned out our horses and they 
grazed, and no harm came to them. 
I am strongly of the opinion, my 
brethren and sisters, that we may 
talk of home and home influence ; 
we may throw protection around 
our children, which we know to be 
proper ; but the moment they go 
out of the house, evil is staring 
them in the face. So long as, un- 
der the law, men and women are 
permitted to desecrate the Sabbath 
day ; so long as places of amuse- 
ment and pleasure are wide open 
before them; so long as saloons 
throw open their doors, and music 
and pleasure invite them to come 
in ; so long as houses of ill fame 



stand upon the corners of our 
streets, — just so long the evil will 
exist. Just as long as the horses 
continue to get out of the barn and 
on to the plains, they will eat the 
noxious weed that at first they re- 
fused and resented. After the ap- 
petite becomes acquired, the only 
way you can get rid of it is to go 
out and hoe up the weeds. Well, 
you will say, is that in accordance 
with the spirit of love, the spirit of 
tolerance which you advocate, that 
shall be exercised towards your 
brother ? It is. I am willing to go 
just as far as God, our eternal 
Father is willing to go. No one 
can be more merciful than He ; no 
one more tolerant ; and yet He nev- 
er compromises with that which is 
wrong. His laws are as inevitable 
as fate itself. John told us that 
the books were opened, and anoth- 
er book was opened which was the 
Book of Life ; and the dead were 
judged out of the things written in 
the books, according to the deeds 
done in the body. Men cannot 
escape that judgment; all will be 
judged according to the deeds done 
in the body ; and so I say that mer- 
cy and tolerance cannot and ought 
not to rob justice. President Taft, 
in his recent remarks from this 
pulpit, referred to the administra- 
tion of the criminal law of our 
country. He did not criticise the 
laiv; he stands for the law, for 
its vindication ; he upholds it ; but 
he advocated that it be administered 
in charity, that it be administered 
with mercy — just as we advocate 
that all law should and ought to be 
administered. So, I do not want 
to be intolerant ; I do not want to 
be unjust; I do not want to ask of 
my fellowman that which I am 
not willing and ready to concede 
to him ; but I do believe this, my 



ELDER BRIGHAM H. ROBERTS.

brethren and sisters, that reforms 
will never be accomplished until 
you strike at the root of the evil, 
and make it impossible, under the 
law, for these things to exist. 

God bless you ; keep us in the 
way of virtue, rectitude and right- 
eousness, I ask, through Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 



PATRIARCH JOHN SMITH. 

My brethren and sisters : I am 
pleased to be with you on this oc- 
casion. I always feel best when in 
the line and discharge of duty, but 
it is with peculiar feelings that I 
stand before you here today, be- 
cause, as I have said so often, 
preaching is not my forte. 

I bear testimony that I have list- 
ened attentively to all that has been 
said during the conference thus far, 
and I can indorse every word that 
has been uttered. I ask God our 
Father to let His blessings rest up- 
on us, His people ; that we may 
profit by what we have learned dur- 
ing this conference ; that when we 
return to our homes we shall go in 
peace, remembering the instructions 
and striving diligently to carry out 
the same ; that we may live accord- 
ing to the laws of our heavenly 
^ather and keep His command- 
ments, that we may be worthy of 
lis blessings. 

All Latter-day Saints have cer- 
tain duties to perform ; and, in so 
doing, if they will follow the 
promptings of that still small voice, 
they will never err in their judg- 
ments, but will be able to fulfill 
their missions in that way and man- 
ner that shall be pleasing to our 
heavenly Father. 

I ask God that His blessings may 
rest upon us, that He may guide us 



in the true path, qualify us for every 
duty, that when we have finished 
our course here we may be worthy 
of the blessings which He has prom- 
ised us, is my prayer, in the name 
of Jesus. Amen.

ELDER BRIGHAM H. ROBERTS. 

These conference days are rath- 
er anxious times, I believe, for at 
least two classes of people : those 
who, in the ordinary course of 
things, may be expected to address 
the conference, and those who have 
to listen to them. I am sure I do 
not know which suffers most. A 
very long time ago we had a Bish- 
opric in the ward where I lived, and 
the Bishop, as perhaps is fitting for 
a Bishop, was not particularly gift- 
ed in giving expression to his 
thought — he was not a "preaching 
Bishop;" and he had a counselor 
who had pretty much the same kind 
of a gift. However, there were oc- 
casions when both of them were 
under the necessity of speaking in 
the ward meeting; and one clay, in 
conversation with the counselor up- 
on this subject, he confidentially 
imparted to me the information that 
he really did not know which dis- 
tressed him most — to try to say 
something himself or listen to the 
Bishop try to say it. I have been 
living, the past few days, in the 
fancied security that it was not 
likely that I would be called upon 
to speak during this conference ; 
but since the brethren have desired 
it, I feel honored in being called up- 
on to address you. I most earnestly 
pray that I may be given right in- 
spirations, and may say only those 



102 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



things that will be proper to say, 
and that ought to be said ; for I 
have no desire in my heart other 
than to help in this great latter-day 
work to which, up to the present 
time, I have given my life and 
thought and my love— although I 
may not always be equal to the task 
of expressing my love for this work 
in a perfectly ordered life, yet I 
love it. 

There have been many interesting 
things brought to our attention dur- 
ing this conference, and especially 
the references that have been made 
to the remarks of the President of 
the United States, who recently 
was Utah's most honored and wel- 
come guest. I listened to his so- 
called "sermon" from this stand, 
with a very great deal of pleasure, 
and I thought that he presented to 
the community here in Utah — non- 
Mormon as well as Mormon — a 
most excellent thought and sound 
advice. For my own part, how- 
ever, I feared that it was a sermon 
that would fall on stony ground, 
and I doubted a little in my heart 
as to whether it would achieve the 
good the executive of the nation 
hoped to achieve by it, because — as 
remarked by Elder Whitney in his 
discourse a day or two ago — each 
of the parties to the controversy, 
the President had in mind, would 
most likely think he meant the 
"other fellow." You know we are 
all anxious for reform — in the 
"other fellow !" and we overlook 
the great principle that in any com- 
mon need for reform, if each would 
reform one, then all would be re- 
formed. I was sitting near Elder 
Whitney, on the occassion referred 
to, and with him I thought the 
President meant me ; and so far as 
he meant me, in his advice, the mat- 
ter is perfectly easy, because I am 



a man of peace. When it really 
does become necessary to say things 
that seem harsh, I always believe in 
saying them in the very pleasantest 
manner possible — not that it gives 
one the same degree of satisfaction 
that might come to one if he "let 
himself go" in the matter, but it 
pleases the other fellow so much to 
have the harsh things said pleas- 
antly. But now, I do not believe 
that the President addressed him- 
self to me as an individual, but he 
addressed himself to a condition 
that exists here, a controversy that 
is on, and to which there are two 
parties — "Mormon" and non-"Mor- 
mon." Now, I have been wonder- 
ing whether those who represent 
the "Mormons" in that controversy 
are willing to sit down and serious- 
ly take into account the question 
whether or not there is any fault in 
us ; whether in any respect we give 
color of justification for the con- 
troversy that is on ; and if there is 
fault in our methods of conducting 
the controversy, or if there exists 
real faults on our part that give in 
any degree justification for the op- 
position we experience — in that 
event — are we ready to make such 
corrections as may be necessary on 
our part to reduce, somewhat, the 
bitterness of the strife ? Of course, 
I do not expect the "other fellows" 
to do anything of that kind; but I 
am wondering if we ought not to 
do it, and trust that the example 
we might set in that direction shall 
at least sweep out of existence every 
vestige of excuse for the bitterness 
with which warfare is waged upon 
us. 

I may not lay claim to the title 
of historian, because that is a very 
high title, a very honorable one; it 
ranks with artist, with poet, with 
philosopher ; and I may not pre- 



ELDER BRIGHAM H. ROBERTS. 



103 



sume in my halting and narrow 
and imperfect labors in that kind, 
to think of myself as a historian. 
Yet, as you know, my labors have 
fallen into historical work to a lim- 
ited extent, and that begets the hab- 
it of considering all the factors that 
enter into an event or series of 
events. Necessarily the critical 
sense is cultivated, and one forms 
the habit of balancing one fact 
against another, with a view of ar- 
riving at the exact truth. Follow- 
ing this line of work in connection 
with the history of the Church, 
truth would compel me to say, as to 
events in the past, that our people 
have not always been blameless in 
their attitude as a community as to 
the things we have done. God has 
given us a system of truth that con- 
stitutes the Gospel of Jesus Christ 
■ — to my mind this Gospel is invul- 
nerable ; it is perfect, and unassail- 
able with truth and reason. To 
defend it is a joy, and always a 
success. But our history — which 
is but another name for our con- 
duct — is not always defensible at 
all points. While the Church in 
Missouri and Illinois never did any- 
thing that warranted the cruelty 
practiced upon them by the people 
of those states; and in the course 
of which there were violations of 
constitutions and the infringement 
of law — while all that was and is 
absolutely unjustifiable — yet there 
was much of fanaticism, much of 
narrowness, and bigotry, and un- 
wisdom on the part of individuals 
among the Latter-day Saints. It 
has become a truism that some men 
cannot endure prosperity. A hun- 
dred men fall away from the ser- 
vice of God when they are pros- 
perous, as against one when they 
have to struggle with adversity. As 
the Lord says : "In the day of their 



peace they esteem lightly my coun- 
sel ; but in the day of their trouble, 
of necessity, they feel after me." 
(Doc. and Cov., Sec. 101). We 
overlook the fact, sometimes, that 
we need the Lord in the day of our 
prosperity. A sectarian hymn rec- 
ognizes this truth, wherein it says : 

"Come near me, O my Savior, 

I need Thee in my joys, 
No less than when the direst ills 

My happiness destroys ; 
For when the sun shines o'er me 

And pleasures throng my way, 
Without Thy wise and guiding hand, 
,More easily I stray." 

It is a dangerous thing, almost, 
for a people to feel that they are 
the especial favorities of heaven, 
and that God has marked them off 
from the rest of mankind by giving 
to them a special mission, and ex- 
alts them by making them the de- 
pository of His law, of His truth, 
and the executors of His will in the 
earth, in relation to the Gospel of 
Jesus Christ. For a people to sense 
this is to have them feel that they 
are all powerful, within the law 
of God, and that God wdl support 
them against all opposition. In the 
state of Missouri, for example, 
some of our brethren under the sense 
of being the chosen of God, gave 
way to fanatical expressions and 
boastfulness, as to what God was 
going to do as to giving them the 
land of Missouri for an inheritance. 
Their boastfulness angered the peo- 
ple by whom they were surrounded. 
If you analyze strictly all the causes 
that led to the disasters that befell 
our community in Missouri, you 
will find that over-zeal, fanaticism, 
unwisdom on their part, was among 
the factors ; and if you are not dis- 
posed to take my statements in re- 
lation to it, you have only to re- 
view our own history and the reve-

lations of our Doctrine and Cove- 
nants and hear the word of the Lord 
in reproof of His people for these 
things; and because of them, He 
declares that He permitted' their 
enemies to prevail against them ; be- 
cause by their not adhering strict- 
ly unto the law of God as He de- 
livered it unto them, He was not 
bound to give them the victory over 
their enemies. It is well to be 
frank with ourselves, and make a 
little introspection; indulge in a lit- 
tle self analysis, and put ourselves 
right in respect to these things, not 
only as individuals but as a 'com- 
munity, also. 

Let me read to you from a reve- 
lation, a passage connected with a 
little history that it may be well to 
remind you of. In his early ex- 
periences the Prophet Joseph Smith 
made his mistakes and was several 
times reproved of the Lord because 
of them. When the Lord delivered 
to Joseph by the hand of Moroni 
the Nephite records, He gave him 
a strict injunction that they were 
not to be exhibited to any but those 
whom the Lord would designate, 
the translation of the record was to 
be a sacred transaction. However, 
when with the help of Martin Har- 
ris, Joseph had succeeded in trans- 
lating enough of the plates to make 
about one hundred and sixteen 
pages of manuscript, Martin Har- 
ris began to be over-anxious to 
exhibit the manuscript to his 
friends. He was so convinced by 
this translation that the Prophet 
had the record, that he desired to 
show his friends, members of his 
family especially, the product of 
their labors. The matter was re- 
ferred to the Lord, and the Lord 
said, No. But Martin Harris con- 
tinued his importunity, and Joseph 
continued to inquire of the Lord, 



until at last the plates were taken 
fro-M Joseph as were also the asso- 
ciated sacred things. After this 
was done, then permission was giv- 
en to Martin Harris to take the 
manuscript of the translated part 
under a very sacred covenant, to 
keep it secure, and naming those 
to whom he was to show the trans- 
lation. Martin Harris broke his 
covenant with the Prophet and the 
result was that this precious docu- 
ment was lost to the Prophet and 
to the Church, and remains so lost 
up to this day. The Prophet lost 
possession of the sacred things as 
well as the record. The LJrim and 
Thummim was gone, and the dis- • 
tress of that man, under these cir- 
cumstances, it would be difficult to 
appreciate. He was bowed down 
in humiliation and the most poig- 
nant grief. Finally, however, the 
angel appeared to him and present- 
ed him, once more, with the Urim 
and Thummim ; and the Prophet 
made immediate use of it to inquire 
of the Lord, and this was the op- 
ening of the revelation unto the 
Prophet, namely : 

"The works and designs and the pur- 
poses of God cannot be frustrated, neith- 
er can they come to naught; for God 
doth not walk in crooked paths, neith- 
er doth He turn to the right hand nor 
to the left ; neither doth He vary from 
thtit which He hath said ; therefore His 
paths are straight, and His course is 
one eternal round. Remember, remem- 
ber that it is not the work of God that 
is frustrated but the work of men." 

Now, I pray you, hold that dec- 
laration in your thought. Let me 
emphasize it, if I can, — "God does 
not walk in crooked paths ;" and 
when men represent Him as vary- 
ing from truth, or as walking in 
crooked paths, they blaspheme His 
name. And what the Lord Him-

105 



self declares He will not do, He 
does not inspire men to do; there- 
fore, God and His Church are an- 
chored to the truth. The angel 
took the Urim and Thummim again 
into his possession. In a few days 
the angel appeared, brought with 
him the records and the sacred as- 
sociated things, and the Prophet 
was reinstated in the full favor and 
acceptance of the Lord ; but He re- 
fers again, in the revelation, to this 
matter of adhering to the truth. 
After explaining to the young 
Prophet the plot that had been laid 
by his enemies to destroy the work, 
and the justification they urged for 
their attempts at destroying it, He 
said : 

"Satan stirreth them up, that he may 
lead their souls to destruction. 

"And thus he has laid a cunning 
plan, thinking to destroy the work of 
God, but I will require this at their 
hands, and it shall turn to their shame 
and condemnation in the day of judg- 
ment. 

"Yea, he stirreth up their hearts to 
anger against this work. 

"Yea, he saith unto them, deceive and 
lie in wait to catch, that ye may destroy : 
behold, this is no harm, and thus he 
flattereth them, and telleth them that 
it is no sin to lie, that they may catch a 
man in a lie, that they may destroy him. 

"And thus he flattereth them, and 
leadeth them along until he draggeth 
their souls down to hell; and thus he 
causeth them to catch themselves in 
their own snare. 

"And thus he goeth up and down, to 
and fro in the earth, seeking to destroy 
the souls of men. 

"Verily, verily, I say unto you, wo be 
unto him that lieth to deceive, because 
he supposeth that another lieth to de- 
ceive, for such are not exempt from the 
justice of God." 

That gives me to understand that 
though my enemy may lie, and de- 
ceive, and traduce and slander, that 
does not warrant me with using 
against him the same weapons. 



Neither God, nor His servants, nor 
His Church are out on a fencing 
match with Lucifer, using as weap- 
ons untruth, and chicanery. God 
is not going to win His victory 
over evil by such means. He is 
going to win by truth gaining a 
victory over falsehood. So that if 
a man tells us that God is varying 
from His own law, that He has 
spoken a word to the ear to break it 
to the hope, or that He has an- 
nounced a law for His Church and 
after that men may disregard it and 
practice falsehood — by acting con- 
trary to that law, or to the position 
that God's Church has taken, then 
we may know that that man is cer- 
tainly mistaken, because we have 
God's word for our warrant that 
He does not walk in crooked paths, 
nor justify lying to meet lying. 

How jealous we ought to be of 
the honor of God's Church — God's 
Church ! I wonder, sometimes, if 
we have the true vision of how 
magnificent that Church is. Paul, 
in the epistle to the Hebrews, tells 
us that the whole family of heaven 
and earth are named after Christ. 
The whole family of heaven and 
earth ! The Church of the living 
God ! At the head of it, the God- 
head ! After that all the worthies 
who have received dispensations of 
the Gospel for this earth, coming 
through the grand patriarch of the 
race — Adam, our honored patri- 
archal head ; and througn him to 
Enoch, and to Moses, and to the 
prophets in Israel, to John the Bap- 
tist, and to the Christ, in the merid- 
ian of time, who came to make the 
great sacrifice, and give che mani- 
festation of God's love for men, 
so that all men might know from 
thence forward, how great, in- 
deed was the love of God. Then 
came the dispensation to the apos-

ties and to the Saints of the early 
Christian centuries ; followed by the 
period of spiritual darkness ; and 
yet God, not willing that the truth 
should be all obscured, permitted 
fragments of it to live even through 
the dark ages in some of the doc- 
trines of men, even as- the clouds, 
sometimes, after the sun has sunk 
behind the western horizon, still 
reflect somewhat the glory of a de- 
parting day. Then, at last, came 
the dispensation of the fulness of 
times, with God's great Witness 
and Prophet of that dispensation, 
Joseph Smith. The Church of 
Christ then exists both in earth and 
in heaven, and its history includes 
all these great dispensations and 
the ages yet to come. Loyalty to the 
Church means loyalty to the God- 
head, to all the great prophets who 
have stood as God's representatives 
in the earth, through all ages; loy- 
alty to the truth ; loyalty to the his- 
tory of the truth and its consis- 
ency. You know how jealously men 
guard the honor of a kingdom — 
how much more binding is it up- 
on the members of this great spir- 
itual empire of the Church of Christ 
to be jealous of the honor of that 
institution! Earthly kingdoms have 
had their patriots : Richelieu loved 
France ; and Bulwer Lytton repre- 
sents him as saying, as he viewed 
the work which his hands and brain 
had achieved in bringing France 
from anarchy to the first rank of 
the nations of Europe, — "France, I 
love thee! Not all earth shall 
pluck thee from my heart. My 
mistress, France! My wedded 
wife ! who shall proclaim divorce 
for thee and me?" Frederick the 
Great loved Prussia; Bismark 
loved united Germany; Garibaldi 
loved Italy ; Cromwell and the Pitts, 
and Burke, and Disraeli, and Glad- 



stone loved England. In our own 
country, Washington loved the Un- 
ited States; so, too, did Jefferson, 
and Webster, and Lincoln. Worthy, 
indeed, was the patriotism of these 
men, but how petty, mean and 
small seems the things that chal- 
lenged their love, in comparison 
with this empire of the Christ, the 
Church of God. Men, I say, hold 
dear the honor of an earthly king- 
dom, how much more ought we to 
hold the honor of the spiritual em- 
pire of Christ. The archpatriot 
of this spiritual empire is the Christ 
Himself; and as His empire is 
more glorious than earthly king- 
doms, so too His patriotism ex- 
ceeds the patriotism of men ; for He 
not only died for His empire, He 
lived for it! and in addition to liv- 
ing for it and dying for it, He 
gathered up into His own soul all 
the sorrows of the members of the 
empire, and bore their sins Him- 
self, that they might not suffer 
for sin, if only they would observe 
His law, and keep His command- 
ments. (Doc. and Cov., Sec. xix). 

Such is the Church of Christ to 
me. Love it? Why, what man, 
who even in a small degree catches 
a glimpse of the glory of this king- 
dom of Christ can fail to love it? 
Who, seeing its excellence, would 
not love it, and desire to see it 
honored among the children of 
men? Its honor and its word, 
when pledged, is the most sacred 
thing that can be plighted. 

I fear I am trespassing upon the 
time, but there is just one other 
circumstance I would like to use 
as an illustration, exhibiting how 
sure the word of the Lord must 
stand, and how He regards an oath 
and covenant to which He or His 
people are pledged. It arises out of 
an experience of ancient Israel. 



ELDER BRIGHAM H. ROBERTS.

The Lord, as you remember, gave 
Palestine as an inheritance to anci- 
ent Israel, and a commandment was 
given to Joshua to go in and take 
possession of it. Of course, the 
taking possession of it meant a 
war of conquest. There was 
nothing else for it, and as the 
peoples that were to be displaced 
had filled to over-running the cup 
of their iniquity, there was nothing 
but the justice of God involved in 
moving them from their lands. So 
Joshua followed his war of con- 
quest. It was a cruel warfare in 
some respects, as all wars are ; and 
he won — so secular histoiy tells us 
— the title of the "Scourge of God." 
The Gibeonites were a people liv- 
ing just north of Jerusalem, and 
they desired to retain their pos- 
session in the land, and escape the 
severity of Joshua. They hit up- 
on this strategy: They took a cer- 
tain delegation, dressed them in old 
clothing, gave them worn out and 
fatigued animals; their tents and 
equipment were worn and travel- 
stained ; their wine bottles were old, 
and the wine sour and unwhole- 
some. This delegation came to the 
camps of Joshua, representing 
themselves as coming from a far 
country; from a people, how- 
ever, who had heard of Joshua 
and his conquest; and who 
feared that he might be tempt- 
ed even to take possession of their 
land, and hence they wanted to en- 
ter into a league of peace . with 
Israel that they might not be dis- 
turbed. So Joshua, in one of his 
'moments of mercy, I suppose, en- 
tered into covenant with them ; 
when, lo, the disguises were thrown 
off, and here were representatives 
of a people right at the door of his 
encampment, and who, doubtless, 
would have been the next victims 



of his war of conquest. But he 
had entered into covenant with 
them, and he remembered that from 
olden times in Israel the principle 
held good that though a man swear 
to his hurt, yet he should change 
not (Psalms 15:4); and so, the 
covenant being made, the Gibeon- 
ites lived in peace with Israel for 
a number of generations. In the 
days of Saul, however, we are in- 
formed by the Bible that the cove- 
nant was violated, and Saul broke 
loose upon this people and shed 
their blood, and went far towards 
destroying them. In the days of 
David, a famine occurred, and it 
persisted. The efforts of the priests, 
the efforts of the king to stay the 
famine, seemed to be all in vain. 
The famine continued year after 
year for three years; until finally 
the word of the Lord came to Dav- 
id, saying, "It is for Saul and for 
his bloody house, because he slew 
the Gibeonites." So David, know- 
ing the sacredness of a pledged 
word, sent for these Gibeonites, and 
said, "What shall I do for you ? and 
wherewith shall I make the atone- 
ment, that ye may bless the inherit- 
ance of the Lord?" They in reply, 
said : "We will have no silver nor 
gold of Saul, nor of his house; 
neither for us shalt thou kill any 
man in Israel. * * * The man 
that consumed us, and that devised 
against us that we should be de- 
stroyed from remaining in any of 
the coasts of Israel, let seven men 
of his sons be delivered unto us, 
and we will hang them up unto the 
Lord in Gibeah of Saul." Did Da- 
vid halt and say: You obtained 
your covenant by deceit and fraud, 
and by misrepresentation, and we 
are not bound by it? No, he did 
not, but he found among the family 
of Saul the required sacrifice, the

seven and they were brought forth 
and delivered into the hands of this 
wronged people, and they led them 
outside, upon a hill, and hung them 
before the Lord, says the historian ; 
and then, mark this language, "And 
after that God was entreated for 
the land," that is, the famine stayed. 
(II Samuel xxi). I am not respon- 
sible for this story; it is in the rec- 
ord that you accept as the word 
of God ; and it shows us how stern- 
ly God holds to the pledged word. 
But one will say, "was not this stern 
old law set aside — this law demand- 
ing an eye for an eye, and tooth 
for tooth ; this law that said thou 
shalt not foreswear they self, but 
thou shalt preform unto the Lord 
all thine oaths. Was not all this 
set aside by the Christ, saying, 
'swear not at all?' And does not 
this indicate that God, though hav- 
ing given a commandment, may 
change it or modify it?" Bless your 
heart, the Lord, so far as I am con- 
cerned, can and will do as He pleas- 
es, and I for one, if I know that 
will, shall do what I can to carry it 
out ; but, mark you, these examples 
I cite to you are taken at a time 
when one law was being displaced 
by another, when the law of Moses 
had completed its purpose and was 
put aside for the law of the gospel. 
I do not think you can find a place 
in holy writ where the Savior holds 
that while the law of Moses was 
yet in force, you could violate it 
with impunity. He may displace 
the law of Moses by the law of the 
gospel, as He did, but you cannot 
find Him counseling violation of the 
law of Moses while that law is in 
force. The Jehovah of the Jews, 
who gave the law unto Moses, is the 
Christ of the New Testament, and 
you could not imagine such an in- 
consistency as His giving a law and 



then permitting violations of it ; for 
God, we have seen, does not walk 
in crooked paths. 

Now, my brethren and sisters, 
perhaps these things are not proper 
for me to discourse upon ; but I 
cannot help thinking about them; 
and if called upon to speak, I must 
needs speak that which seems to 
me the most important thing to be 
considered. If I have overstepped 
any bounds of propriety, in refer- 
ring to these matters, most humbly 
I beg the pardon of the brethren ; 
for I assure you there is no desire 
in my heart to assume any function 
that does not properly belong to 
my ministry. I speak only because 
always before my vision is • the 
Church of God, as I have tried to 
present it in thought to you, an 
institution that I am sure will pre- 
vail ; and I am sure that God will 
inspire His servants to do that 
which is essential to the salvation 
of the people and to the honor of 
the Church of Christ. I have the 
fullest confidence that whatever 
may be erratic or sporadically 
wrong among us will be corrected ; 
and the presiding brethren will find 
me, heart and hand, with them in 
maintaining the honor and the glory 
of this great empire of the Christ. 

May the Lord bless you, is my 
prayer. Amen. 

The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn: 

O, say, what is truth? 'Tis the fairest 
gem 
That the riches of worlds can pro- 
duce; 
And priceless the value of truth will 

be when 
The proud monarch's costliest diadem 
Is counted but dross and refuse. 

Benediction was pronounced by 
Bishop David A. Smith. Confer- 
ence adjourned until 2 p. m.

CLOSING SESSION. 

In the Tabernacle, at 2 p. m. 

President Joseph F. Smith called 
the meeting to order. 

The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn : 

How firm a foundation, ye Saints of 

the Lord, 
Is laid for your faith in His excellent 

word! 
What more can He say than to you 

He hath said, 
You who unto Jesus for refuge have 

fled? 

Prayer was offered by Elder 
Charles F. Middleton. 

The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn : 

Come, come, ye Saints, no toil nor 
labor fear, 
Put with joy wend your way; 
Though hard to you this journey may 
appear, 
Grace shall be as your day. 



ELDER J. GOLDEN KIMBALL. 

I am reminded of one of the reve- 
lations found in the Doctrine and 
Covenants, in which the Lord, 
speaking to Oliver Cowdery, says : 

"Behold, you have not understood; 
you have supposed that I would give 
it unto you, when you took no 
thought, save it was to ask me; 

"But, behold, I say unto you, that 
you must study it out in your mind; 
then you must ask me if it be right, 
and if it is right I will cause that your 
bosom shall burn within you; there- 
fore, you shall feel that it is right." 

My father often said to this peo- 
ple, many years ago, "ever/ tub will 
have to stand upon its own bottom." 
He also said many times just be- 
fore his death — I think it was about 



the last thing he did say — 'Oh ! the 
test, the test, the test! Who will 
be able to stand?" He made that 
remark to mother, and she asked 
him what the test was. He -said, 
"I don't know ; but no one will be 
able to stand unless he knows that 
Jesus is the Christ." 

■At the age of fifty-six, and after 
a number of years of labor in the 
ministry* and among this people, I 
am able to testify in and of myself, 
under the influence of che Spirit 
of the Lord, that I believe all that 
God has revealed; and I believe 
every principle that the Lord has 
revealed through His servants. 

Now, I want to confess to the 
people that I have been thinking 
along certain lines, not with any 
knowledge or assurance that I 
would be called upon to speak at 
this conference, as I have per- 
formed very little labor among the 
people during the last year or more, 
owing to the condition of my health. 
When thinking about the matter, I 
was wondering what the chief top- 
ic of this conference would be, and 
I came to the conclusion that if I 
were called upon, I would speak 
upon the temporal salvation of this 
people. I appreciate salvation ; I 
realize that eternal life is the great- 
est gift of God; but the temporal 
salvation of this people is also of 
vital importance. Some of us — I 
plead guilty — have sold our inher- 
itances for a "mess of pottage ;" and 
in doing so we are without excuse, 
for we were warned by the servants 
of the Lord to hold secure our in- 
heritances, as we were only stew- 
ards over the same. 

I will now read something I have 
copied. On August 5th, 1842, the 
Prophet Joseph Smith prophesied 
that the Saints would continue to 
suffer much affliction and would be 



110 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



driven to the Rocky Mountains; 
many would apostatize; others 
would be put to death by their per- 
secutors or lose their lives in con- 
sequence of exposure or disease ; 
but, he said, "Some of you will live 
to go and assist in making settle- 
ments and building cities and will 
see the Saints become a mighty peo- 
ple in the midst of the Rocky Moun- 
tains." They had not been here 
very long before the gold fever 
broke out in California, and some 
of our people were tinctured very 
badly with the spirit of money get- 
ting. Now listen to what President 
Brigham Young said — it was his 
admonition to the Saints who de- 
sired to go to California : "The 
true use of gold is for paving 
streets, covering houses and mak- 
ing culinary dishes. When the 
Saints shall have preached the Gos- 
pel, raised grain and built cities 
enough, the Lord will open up the 
way for a supply of gold to the sat- 
isfaction of the people." I am very 
glad that the Prophet Brigham 
Young, emphasized the true use of 
gold and silver. I have heard it 
preached hundreds of times — the ef- 
fects of speculation among this peo- 
ple; that it would tend to break 
them up and lead them from rais- 
ing grain, building cities, and mak- 
ing preparation for the tens of 
thousands of people who will desire 
to come to these mountains for safe- 

ty- 

We have our own people scat- 
tered all over the world, and which 
of you has land to divide . among 
them? Are we properly sup- 
plied with grain? I call the atten- 
tion of the people to a pamphlet 
written by Brother John Beck on a 
"Co-operative college" for Utah. 
There was a time in the history of 
Brother John Beck, when he had 



plenty of gold and silver. At that 
time his words would have resound- 
ed through all Israel , but he is now 
a poor man, and we don't read his 
pamphlet. I say to the Latter-day 
Saints, that we are not doing our 
duty in regard to temporal affairs. 
We are not looking after the 
streams of water ; we are not se- 
curing titles to land. On the con- 
trary, our sons are being educated, 
and probably half of them are hunt- 
ing for white-shirt jobs, and they 
don't want to secure the land. Yet 
there has never been a time in the 
history of this Church, or in the 
settling of this country, when there 
were such opportunities. I recently 
talked with one of our prominent 
brethren, a business man, a man for 
whom I have the greatesc regard. 
He was interested in representing 
our products at Seattle, and on his 
return to Utah, he felt inspired to 
go down to the Virgin River, and 
secure some of that water for the 
people. 

What did it cost to settle that 
country — the Saint George country? 
It cost the lives of hundreus of peo- 
ple. The last time I was in St. 
George there were ninety widows 
in that one settlement. Well, this 
good man went to the State Engi- 
neer ; he looked over the maps care- 
fully, and ascertained the facts in 
the case. He returned to the En- 
gineer's Office in the evening to 
file upon the water, but a stranger 
had been there between morning 
and evening, and secured over five 
hundred inches of the Virgin River 
water. So it is all over Utah ; we 
are sleeping in our trail, and we are 
in a sort of Rip Van Winkle condi- 
tion as to our rights, — some of us. 

My brethren, and sisters, I am a 
practical man, and I wish you to 
know that I have been a pioneer; I 



ELDER RULON S. WELLS. 



Ill 



know what it costs to make a home. 
I fought my battles years ago, in as 
hard a country as has ever been set- 
tled by our people. I know it re- 
quires ten years of hard labor, and 
economy, to succeed as a pioneer. 
I desire it to go down in history to 
my posterity, that, while I have 
made a number of failures, I did not 
fail as a pioneer. When I left that 
country, I could have bought out 
a dozen men who had been raised 
and remained in Salt Lake City; I 
mean young men who worked be- 
hind the counter. But I lost it all 
through speculation. That is what 
I want to talk to you about. Spec- 
ulation — there is nothing more dan- 
gerous to the people and to the 
Church of Latter-day Saints, un- 
less it be immorality and wicked- 
ness. I point you back to history, 
to Nauvoo. What did the spirit 
of speculation do, according to the 
history. It nearly destroyed the 
people there. 

Take Heber C. Kimball's family, 
as an illustration. My father died 
in 1868. When his administrators 
divided up the estate there was not 
a single silver dollar given to any 
of his children, to my knowledge, 
but there was some property. Our 
father selected land on the side hill, 
among the rocks— he wanted to get 
away from the center of the city. 
He owned what is known as the 
Capitol Hill. He left his children 
that real estate. There was one lot 
that was given to my mother's fam- 
ily, and I owned one third of it. 
I received twenty-five thousand dol- 
lars for my portion, and I have been 
sorry twenty-five thousand times 
that I ever sold it. (Laughter). 
I am thankful we had sense enough 
to keep sufficient ground to bury 
our posterity on. We have paid 
taxes on it ever since I was fifteen 



years old, and I still hold it. ■ What 
about the other property? There 
is now hardly a Kimball to be found 
on the Capitol Hill — unless it be 
those that are dead. Some of the 
Kimballs sold their lots at $50 each ; 
today the same lots are worth $4,- 
000.00. If Heber C. Kimball's fam- 
ily had kept their inheritance they 
would all be wealthy now. And 
what about the families of other pio- 
neers who came here and fought 
this great battle? Many of their 
children are in very nearly the same 
predicament. I predict to the Lat- 
ter-day Saints, as a watchman up- 
on the towers, if you follow that 
foolish example you will "hew stone 
and draw water :" vou can write 
that down. God bless you. Amen. 



ELDEK KTJL0N S. WELLS. 

I trust that the Spirit of the Lord 
will direct me while I stand before 
you. I have rejoiced in the meet- 
ings of this conference and the 
spirit of the instructions which have 
been given unto us. While our 
brethren have been talking to us 
many reflections have come to my 
mind, regarding the great plan of 
life and salvation. I was partic- 
ularly interested in the reference 
that was made to the "new religion" 
of Doctor Eliot, the ex-president of 
Harvard University ; and i thought, 
how vain men are, who will pre- 
sume to formulate a religion for 
the salvation of our Father's chil- 
dren. It lies only with God to. de- 
vise a plan whereby His children 
can be saved. The great trouble in 
the world is that we have too many 
man-made religions, and they do 
not possess the power of God unto 
salvation. Only that plan that was 
revealed from heaven, that was 



112

given and established before the 
foundations of this earth were laid, 
possesses this power. Eternal life 
is the goal for which we are striv- 
ing, and men may not attain to it 
except in the way which has been 
pointed out by the Savior of the 
world. In order for men to find out 
the true way, it is necessary that 
they shall be obedient unto the will 
of God, that they turn away from 
wickedness and sin, that the Spirit 
of the Lord may possess their souls 
and bring them to a knowledge of 
the truth and to a knowledge of 
God, for it is this knowledge of 
God that we understand to be eter- 
nal life, as was pointed out by 
Brother McKay: "This is eternal 
life, to know Thee the only true 
God and Jesus Christ whom Thou 
hast sent." But no man can ob- 
tain that knowledge of God through 
the wisdom of men. Men are un- 
able to devise the plan by which 
the children of men may attain to 
that knowledge. We read in the 
holy scriptures that when our first 
parents were placed in the Garden 
of Eden, the Lord had planted a 
garden in the east end thereof, and 
in the midst of the garden there 
stood a tree, which was the tree of 
knowledge of good and evil. The 
Lord told our father Adam that of 
the fruit of this tree he should not 
eat, for in the day that he ate there- 
of he should surely die. I wish to 
call attention to this particular in- 
stance which occurred in the be- 
ginning of the history of man, upon 
this earth. After having partaken 
of this fruit, Adam and Eve were 
cast out of the Garden of Eden and 
Cherubim, with flaming swords, 
were placed at the entrance to 
guard the way to the tree of life, 
which also stood in the midst of 
this garden, lest they might also 



partake of the fruit of that tree and 
live forever in their transgression. 
It is obvious, therefore, that in the 
great plan of the Almighty, men 
were not to obtain eternal life 
while in transgression; and a plan 
must be formed that would cleanse 
and purify men before they should 
be permitted to partake of that fruit 
which gave them eternal life. If it 
had been possible, or if it had been 
permitted that our first parents, in 
their transgression, could have also 
partaken of the fruit of this tree of 
life, we would not have attained to 
the eternal life that the Lord desires 
His children to obtain, because it 
would have been an eternal life of 
sin, and transgresion from the ways 
of the Lord, and the next world 
would have been no better than this 
one. The Lord desired that all 
those who should partake of the 
fruit of that tree and live forever, 
should first become purged and pu- 
rified and cleansed from all sin and 
from all unrighteousness ; therefore, 
He revealed from heaven a plan 
whereby men and women could ob- 
tain eternal life and come to the 
knowledge of God. Then, to know 
God is eternal life, and men can- 
not attain it only through faith and 
repentance from sin. Likewise, 
they must receive a remission of 
sin through baptism of the water, 
and Spirit, before they can know 
Him, for we can only know God 
and the things of God by the Spir- 
it of God. Men may endeavor by 
their sophistry and philosophy to 
find Him out, but they will fail. 
They may undertake, by logic and 
reason to uncover His hiding place, 
but they will not succeed only as 
they pass through the cleansing 
process of the Gospel ■ of Jesus 
Christ. Cherubim with flaming 
swords still guard the way to the

tree of life and knowledge of God, 
whom to know is life eternal. It 
is a wonderful plan. I wish to call 
attention to this fact, that the fear 
of the Lord is the beginning of wis- 
dom, and in reference to obtaining 
wisdom or knowledge, it must begin 
with the fear of God in our hearts. 
The Lord has given command- 
ments and, with these command- 
ments, this condition of fear is held 
up before the children of men. 
Sometimes there is a disposition to 
belittle this feeling of fear of God. 
Of course, it is not to be compared 
with the love of God, which is the 
greatest thing in the world; but 
the beginning is the fear of God. 
The beginning of knowledge, the 
beginning of wisdom ha,s its origin 
in the fear of God, because human 
nature is such that this apprehen- 
sion must continually be held up be- 
fore mankind. It is so in the family 
government ; it is so in our civil 
government. What would we be if 
it were not for the fact that laws are 
passed and penalties attached to the 
transgression of the lawsr Would 
we be as honest, as virtuous, as 
true, as we are today if there were 
no civil laws prescribing penalties? 
I do not believe we would be. I 
believe that it is necessary, in our 
civil government, that there should 
be laws passed that whosoever shed- 
deth the blood of man, by man shall 
his blood be shed ; and that whoso- 
ever shall steal must pay the pen- 
alty. The sentiment of fear must 
be held up before us. I believe that 
it is necessary for every one of us 
to have these things before us, that 
we may know the consequence of 
transgression is that we will be pun- 
ished. I rejoice that there is a code 
of laws in force by which society 
is protected, by which our children 
and we ourselves are protected 



from going the wrong way. We, 
too, are a covenant people, and this 
essential condition of fear is in- 
scribed in the law of God; it is al- 
ways held up before us. We are 
under holy and sacred covenants, 
penalties are attached to the trans- 
gression of the law of God; and, 
my brethren and sisters, in this fear 
of God I can find the beginning of 
wisdom and of knowledge. Men 
who wish to come to a knowledge 
of God may begin by having the 
fear in their hearts that they will 
not violate or transgress His laws, 
for they are wholesome and good, 
and we need them to keep us 
straight. As I advance in years, I 
find that I approve of every influ- 
ence that has a tendency to keep 
me in the right path. I delight in 
those restrictions that are placed 
upon society and upon me, that pre- 
vent us from going wrong. It will 
hurt no good man to have good and 
wholesome laws; furthermore, it 
will lead us to the love of God, be- 
cause if we are walking in this path, 
eschewing evil, turning away from 
it, each time that we govern our- 
selves in this way we will find we 
are coming nearer to obeying the 
will of God, and the great law of 
love will have an opportunity of 
controling us. 

I desire to read a few words from 
the eleventh chapter of the first 
book of Nephi. Those of you who 
are familiar with the Book of Mor- 
mon will remember the great dream 
that Lehi had, and how the Lord 
revealed to him, in that dream, won- 
derful things, and among other 
things that he saw was a tree, the 
fruit of which was very desirable. 
Afterwards Nephi received a vis- 
ion, and an angel of the Lord asked 
him a question, as to what he de- 
sired, and he said he desired to see 



114 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



the things which his father had seen 
in his dream : 

"And the angel said unto me (Nephi) 
Behold the Lamb of God, yea, even the 
Son of the Eternal Father! Knowest 
thou the meaning of the tree which thy 
father saw? 

"And I answered him saying, Yea, it 
is the love of God, which sheddeth it- 
self abroad in the hearts of the chil- 
dren of men ; wherefore, it is the most 
desirable above all things. 

"And he spake unto me saying, Yea, 
and the most joyous to the soul. 

"And after he had said these words, 
he said unto me, Look! and I looked, 
and I beheld the Son of God going forth 
among the children of men; and I saw 
many fall down at his feet and worship 
him. 

"And it came to pass that I beheld that 
the rod of iron which my father had 
seen, was the word of God, which led 
to the fountain of living waters, or to 
the tree of life; which waters are a rep- 
resentation of the love of God; and I 
also beheld that the tree of life was a 
representation of the love of God." 

The word of God was the iron 
rod which also led to the tree of 
life. That is the way to get to that 
tree and to partake of its fruit ; and 
it represents the love of God. Bless- 
ed are those who shall attain to the 
love of God, but let them not de- 
spise the necessity of fearing God, 
and keeping His commandments. 

In this the dispensation of the 
fulness of times, as it was predict- 
ed, an angel came flying through 
the midst of heaven, having the 
•everlasting Gospel to preach unto 
them that dwell upon the face of the 
earth, to every nation, kindred, 
tongue and people; and this was 
his cry : "Fear God and give glory 
to Him, for the hour of His judg- 
ment is come ; and worship Him 
that made the heavens and the 
earth, and the seas, and the foun- 
tains of water." Brethren and sis- 
ters, let the fear of God take hold 



of us, that we may obey His com- 
mandments, lest we have to pay the 
penalty; let us so live that we may 
avoid the punishment that comes to 
the evil-doer. If we will do so, 
clinging to the word of God, re- 
membering the penalties that come 
from transgressing and going 
against it, we will eventually ar- 
rive at the tree and partake of that 
love of God that will fill our hearts 
with joy that is beyond all descrip- 
tion. God bless us all. Amen. 



EIDER CHARLES H. HART. 

It is pleasing, and I think, indeed, 
fitting that this house of worship 
should be decorated with the Stars 
and Stripes, the colors and emblem 
of our country; for I know of no 
religion, except ours, that has as 
one of its religious beliefs or doc- 
trines, the fact that the Constitu- 
tion of the United States was di- 
vinely inspired. In Section 150 of 
the Doctrine and Covenants we 
have this language; 

"Therefore, it is not right that any 
man should be in bondage, one to an- 
other, and for this purpose have I es- 
tablished the Constitution of this land, 
by the hands of wise men whom I raised 
up unto this very purpose, and redeemed 
the land by the shedding of blood." 

The history of constitution mak- 
ing shows that there is good reason 
for a doctrine such as this. When 
we view the progress that had been 
made in constitution making up to 
the time of the adoption of the Con- 
stitution of the United States, and 
the great success of that instrument, 
we can readily believe that it was 
more than man's wisdom that es- 
tablished the balances, the divisions 
of government, and the harmony

and consistency existing in that 
great document. If we may pre- 
sume ourselves incompetent to pass 
an impartial judgment upon the 
value of that document, on account 
of being, ourselves, citizens and 
lovers of our own country, let us 
take the testimony of one of those 
distinguished statesmen mentioned 
this morning, a patriot and lover of 
the English government, the Eng- 
lish Premier, William Gladstone, 
who said of our Constitution, "So 
far as I am able to observe, it is 
the greatest instrument ever strick- 
en off at a given time, by the brain 
and purpose of man." I think one 
of the elements of distinction, in 
connection with that instrument, is 
the fact that it was a written con- 
stitution. England had made great 
progress in establishing the rights of 
freemen, during all the centuries of 
her history, that were so rich in the 
development of those principles 
guaranteeing the rights and liberties 
that Anglo-Saxons so dearly prize. 
But England did not have a writ- 
ten constitution, so-called; she had 
her various documents which were 
repositories of these great princi- 
ples that the English forefathers 
had contended for. She had her 
Magna Charta, that was wrested 
from King John, by the Barons, up- 
on the plains of Runnymede. She 
had her petition of Rights, her Bill 
of Rights, her Act of Settlement, 
the Habeas Corpus Act, and all of 
these great palladiums of English 
liberty; but none of them could 
compare with this remarkable doc- 
ument that was produced by these 
wise men, whom God raised up for 
the very purpose of making that 
constitution. 

The influence of the document 
has been contagious. It spread to 
Europe. Governments in Europe, 



in Asia, in Africa, and in the islands 
of the sea have patterned after it; 
and we may well be proud, it seems 
to me, of the position of our Church 
with reference to this great instru- 
ment, that is suitable to the needs 
of eighty or ninety millions of peo- 
ple as readily as it was suitable to 
some three millions; a document 
that is capable of being extended 
and expanded, and of growing in 
the right directions ; a document 
which secures unto us liberty and 
security that we, perhaps, do not 
realize or stop to think of, — sur- 
rounding us and protecting us, as 
the very air that we breathe. 

A missionary in Turkey, some 
years ago, when times were as trou- 
blesome and as dangerous to life, 
almost, then as they were recently, 
told me of his experience, showing 
the value to him of being an Amer- 
ican citizen. His life was in danger. 
Before that time he had made the 
friendship of the United States 
consul, and when the lines began to 
be drawn about him, so that it 
seemed his life was in great hazard 
and jeopardy, he got a communi- 
cation through to that United States 
consul, at a distant port. He re- 
sponded immediately by sending 
several American war vessels into 
the harbor where our missionary 
brother was located, and the Turk- 
ish government had served upon 
them, very vigorously, a notice 
which warned them that they would 
be held responsible for every hair 
on the head of that misionary that 
might be harmed. 

Now, while receiving protection 
such as makes it a great privilege to 
be a citizen of the United States, we 
owe a corresponding duty to our 
country; we owe the duty of per- 
petuation, of obedience to the first 
great command that was given our 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



first parents. The question of race 
suicide is agitating the minds of 
thinking people today. According 
to statistics given by Professor Ross 
of the Wisconsin University, in the 
American Journal of Sociology, the 
birthrate of all European nations 
declined, during the period that the 
statistics covered, the last quarter 
of the 19th century. The decline 
was from 2.2% to 6.8% births to 
the thousand population, making 
England's reduction of the birth- 
rate from 35.4 to 28 6 at about the 
close of the 19th century. There 
were evidences of the birthrate de- 
clining in all those nations, even in 
the vigorous young colonies of 
Great Britain, during that period 
and since. From statistics given 
by one of the brethren, sometime 
ago, the birthrate of the Mormon 
people, for the year 1908, I think, 
was 40.2 births, per annum, for the 
thousand population. We owe it to 
our government, in addition to the 
perpetuation of the race, to develop 
worthy citizens, men who have em- 
bodied in their lives those principles 
that have been taught during this 
conference, by the various speakers. 
We who went to the Fair, yester- 
day, admired the products of the 
soil. We paused for a moment, as 
we passed that group of squash 
weighing 1,370 pounds. We ad- 
mired the mammoth horses, fat cat- 
tle, beautiful birds, and the products 
of the shop and field ; but 1 am sure 
we would take greater pride in the 
growth and development of our 
sons and daughters, and in their 
virtue and integrity, rather than 
in these products of the held and of 
the farm. Emerson has said that 
the chief test of civilization is not 
in the census, nor the size of the 
cities, nor the crops — no, but far 
greater than these, the character of 



the men and women we are pro- 
ducing. If the doctrines and teach- 
ings of this conference shall be 
adhered to by the people, an im- 
provement will be made for the fu- 
ture, in this most important direc- 
tion of the proper care, growth, 
and development of our children. 

This doctrine of temporal salva- 
tion is really a spiritual doctrine, 
when you come to think of it. In 
the Doctrine and Covenants we are 
informed that at no time has the 
Lord given any temporal law, but 
they are all spiritual. These so- 
called temporal things are spiritual 
in a sense ; and that is in harmony 
with the doctrine of a modern phil- 
osopher who expresses it in the form 
of a question: "If we continue to 
progress, must there not come a 
time when we shall cease to dif- 
ferentiate and call some things sec- 
ular, and some things sacred?" All 
these things that tend to the growth, 
development and betterment of the 
people are sacred and spiritual. 

The soul of an individual is cer- 
tainly very precious in the sight of 
our Father. The words of the Sav- 
ior, according to Luke, referring to 
the value of a human soul, are as 
follows : "What is a man advan- 
taged, if he gain the whole world 
and lose himself, or is cast away?" 
For many years, and perhaps still, 
with some people, the doctrine ex- 
isted that man was made by our 
Father in Heaven for the purpose 
of giving him praise; but in the 
Pearl of Great Price we have the 
true doctrine in reference to that 
matter, as revealed from the Lord, 
"Behold, this is my work and my 
glory : to bring to pass the immor- 
tality and eternal life of man." Not 
the matter of singing praise unto 
Him, as the chief glory of God, as 
declared by some formal statements 



BISHOP CHARLES W. NIB LEY.

of creed ; but the glory of God is in 
bringing to pass the immortality 
and eternal life of us, His creatures. 
May the Lord help us, my breth- 
ren and sisters, to accept and put 
into practice the important doctrines 
and truths we have heard during 
this conference, that shall help to 
make us better citizens of this great 
country of ours, and better mem- 
bers of the Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints, I ask it, in the 
name of Jesus. Amen. 

Sister Judith Anderson Bird sang 
the contralto solo, "Lord hear us, 
we pray Thee." 



BISHOP CHAELES W. NIBLEY. 

The variety of instruction that 
we have had at this conference, 
and the kind of instruction, is cer- 
tainly to be commended. I do not 
see how any right-minded person, 
of whatever creed or persuasion, or 
of no creed, could object or find 
fault with the teachings that have 
been given to the Latter-day Saints 
during the sessions of our confer- 
ence. We have been taught to be 
good citizens, good fathers, good 
mothers, good children ; to love our 
neighbors; to pay our debts; to 
keep out of debt ; to love the Lord 
our God with all our heart, and 
many more items of instruction to 
which I have not time to call your 
attention. We have also heard of 
the work of the Betterment Com- 
mittee, in looking after our chil- 
dren, and this was emphasized by 
President Smith in the beginning 
of the conference. The work of the 
Bureau of Information, on this 
block, extending courtesy to strang- 
ers, has also been called to our at- 
tention. All of these things have 



been talked about, and many more, 
and everyone of them are good. 

Nor have we been wanting in 
manifestation of the spirit of pa- 
triotism and love of country. The 
remarks of Elder Hart, the previ- 
ous speaker, alluded to this matter. 
I thought as he was speaking, if 
we only knew and could sense al- 
ways what this priceless boon of lib- 
erty has cost the children of men, 
we would appreciate it perhaps 
more than we do; and if we only 
knew and could sense, always, that 
beyond the liberty of our country 
and its God-inspired Constitution, 
which we have for the government 
of the country, we have beyond 
that, and higher than that, a per- 
fect law of liberty in the Gospel of 
Jesus Christ. All other forms are 
naturally imperfect, being largely 
the product of man; but in the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ, Saint Paul 
tells us, we have a perfect law of 
liberty. Indeed, we have it record- 
ed here in the book of Doctrine and 
Covenants, which may be called the 
constitution of this Church, that no 
man should exercise his Priesthood, 
or the rights of the Priesthood in 
any degree of unrighteousness. The 
dominion, the control that is given 
through this organization must be 
on righteous principles. 

Mormonism holds a singular and 
unique position in the world, claim- 
ing as it does to be The Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 
It is a creed founded in righteous- 
ness, established, in this perfect 
law of liberty, and it challenges the 
world to produce anything like the 
organization which the Lord has 
revealed, and through which He 
makes manifest His righteousness 
and His purposes in the earth. 
Without this Priesthood, we are 
told, the power of godliness is not

made manifest to men in the flesh. 
We mistake greatly if we think 
that in the struggle for this liber- 
ty, in the fighting which began 
three hundred years ago, and con- 
tinued during two hundred years 
— we mistake greatly if we think 
that that contention and struggle 
was for the purpose of establishing 
any particular creed, or branch of 
the Church. The contention of the 
Protestants, who protested against 
the misrule of the Catholic Church, 
was not that they should establish 
any particular kind of a church, it 
was a contention and fight against 
tyranny ; it was a fight for liberty 
— liberty that they might establish 
a church, if they chose to do so, 
or do without one if they chose; 
but it was for liberty and against 
oppression. I say all honor to 
Protestantism. No man shall go 
before me in honoring that spirit 
of patriotism which was manifested 
all through the struggle in the 
Netherlands, in the low countries, 
in fighting that terrible oppressor 
the Duke of Alva, sent by the Span- 
ish government and the Pope — 
not in the interests of liberty but 
to crush out the spirit of liberty. 
But the little thing that the Lord 
had planted, this desire for liberty, 
grew in the hearts of the children 
of men, and it became the great 
thing in England, as well as in Hol- 
land, in Queen Elizabeth's time, 
with Sir Francis Drake scouring 
the seas and capturing the Spanish 
galleons, with their treasure loads 
of gold from Peru and Mexico. All 
that was not that any particular 
brand of church might be estab- 
lished; that is to say, that they 
wanted this chruch or the other 
church; the fight was — let me tell 
you again — that liberty should be 
established, so that men could wor- 



ship as they pleased, how they 
pleased, or not worship at all, if 
they so pleased. The time had not 
yet come for the Church of Jesus 
Christ to be established; and all 
honor, I say, to the Pi otestant coun- 
tries and Protestant peoples who 
caused liberty to become estab- 
lished. 

So, a little later, in our own 
country, the same fight, the same 
contention, the same struggle is on 
— not to establish one church or the 
other, but for liberty. In Wash- 
ington's time, the liberty 1 , which 
this flag [pointing to the national 
emblem], now represents was ful- 
ly accomplished, when there was 
enacted in our Constitution a full 
fruition of this fighting and strug- 
gling, — in these words : "Congress 
shall make no law respecting the 
establishment of religion or pro- 
hibiting the free exercise thereof, 
nor abridging the freedom of 
speech or of the press, nor the right 
of the people to peaceably assem- 
ble and petition the government for 
redress of grievances." That being 
enacted into law and becoming the 
law of the country, then the liberty 
that all these people had been fight- 
ing for was granted to our country, 
and became an accomplished fact. 
Now, when that was accomplished, 
God Almighty, in His own way, 
sends forth what? A more perfect 
law of liberty and righteousness, 
more perfect than the Constitution 
of the country itself, in the bring- 
ing forth of His Church in these last 
days, in raising up the Prophet Jo- 
seph Smith as He did and instruct- 
ing him how to prepare this won- 
derful organization, with the Priest- 
hood of the Son of God as its gov- 
erning power. 

Our contention is that the Priest- 
hood was taken from the earth in 



BISHOP CHARLES W. NIB LEY. 



119 



an early age of the Christian era. 
As soon as the Primitive Church 
dwindled into darkness and unbelief 
and the Church itself adopted rules 
and measures, regulations and or- 
dinances which were subversive 
and destructive of the spirit of lib- 
erty, then the Priesthood was with- 
drawn from the earth; so that the 
question as to when this Priesthood 
was taken from the earth is an- 
swered in the Book of Doctrine and 
Covenants itself in these words : 

"The rights of the priesthood are in- 
separably connected with the powers of 
heaven, and that the powers of heaven 
cannot be controlled nor handled only 
upon the principles of righteousness. 

"That they may be conferred upon us, 
it is true; but when we undertake to 
cover our sins, or to gratify our pride, 
our vain ambition, or to exercise control, 
or dominion, or compulsion, upon the 
souls of the children of men, in any de- 
gree of unrighteousness, behold, the 
heavens withdraw themselves; the Spirit 
of the Lord is grieved; and when it is 
withdrawn, Amen to the Priesthood, or 
the authority of that man." 

If that is true with respect to one 
man, it is true with respect to one 
million of men or any number of 
men. That shows when the Priest- 
hood was lost. That is why it needed 
restoring again. 

"No power or influence can or ought 
to be maintained by virtue of the priest- 
hood, only by persuasion, by long suffer- 
ering, by gentleness and meekness, and 
by love unfeigned ; 

"By kindness, and pure knowledge, 
which shall greatly enlarge the soul 
without hypocrisy, and without guile." 

So I say that of all people, in all 
this world, the Latter-day Saints 
stand for liberty and righteousness, 
and ought to stand, and must so 
stand, under this doctrine and con- 
stitution of our Church. If we 



maintain the Church of Christ iri 
the earth, and it will be maintained, 
it will be upon principles of right- 
eousness. No man will be put to 
death by this Church because he 
does not believe its doctrines — even 
if it were possible under the law 
that they could be compelled in any 
way. You can't maintain the rights 
and authority of the Priesthood n, 
that way. You can believe what 
you please, of course, this liberty 
exists. Anyone can establish a 
Church. Doctor Eliot? Yes, just 
as much right, under the law, as 
any man — just exactly — and no- 
body will say him nay. He hasn't 
any authority from God Almighty 
to bestow the Priesthood — that is 
a very different proposition; he 
does not claim it; neither do the 
other churches, except one, claim 
it. But Mormonism claims it; this 
church claims it. 

This is not a chinch established 
by some man, by man's wisdom — 
any old kind of a church, so to 
speak; it is The Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints. Here- 
in is the truth, and the light, and 
the way — a perfect law of liberty 
and of righteousness. All the coun- 
sel of this whole conference has 
been to that end, and makes for the 
establishment of that aim; makes 
for righteousnes ; makes for liber- 
ty, right-living and the well-being 
of the children of men upon the 
earth. You shall not oppress any 
one, nor attempt to oppress any 
one. Men may believe, as our 
Catholic brethren profess to believe, 
that the bread that is blest becomes 
into the living flesh of Christ. Of 
.course we do not believe that; we 
believe it is ridiculous, and know, 
in fact, that it is not true. But they 
have a right to believe it, if they 
want to; and I gloiy in the fact

that, through the fighting of the 
three hundred years that have 
passed, from the 16th to the 19th 
centuries, I glory in the fact that I 
cannot be put to death because I re- 
fuse to believe it ; that is where our 
liberty comes in. 

This is God's Church ; this is The 
Church, — the only Church that He 
acknowledges in the earth, as hav- 
ing His Priesthood — the only one 
in all the world. We chailenge the 
attention of the world on that prop- 
osition. It is guided by Him. I 
know as I live, that this is the 
Church of God, that Jesus is the 
Christ, that Joseph Smith is His 
prophet, sent of God to establish 
the Church whose law is a perfect 
law of liberty to all mankind. God 
bless you. Amen. 

ELDER HEBER J. GRANT. 

Appeal to increase membership of M. 
I. Associations, and subscribe for 
The Era. 

I have asked permission to say a 
few words in the interest of the Mu- 
tual Improvement Associations. As 
is known, the organization of class- 
es in the Priesthood has taken away 
{, om the Young Men's Mutual Im- 
provement Association regular re- 
ligious study, that is, regular scrip- 
tural study, and many people have 
expressed the .idea that there is now 
little or no use for the Young Men's 
Mutual Improvement Associations. 
We feel the exact opposite. The 
General Superintendency, and all 
the members of the General Board, 
feel that there is as much necessity 
for improvement of our young men 
in other lines as in ecclesiastical 
study. 

We have, at the present time, 
1,097 members of the Mutual Im- 



provement Association on missions. 
Fully one-half of all the mission- 
aries are members of our associa- 
tion. There are 685 wards in the 
Church, and 629 Young Men's Mu- 
tual Improvement associations ; so 
there are fifty-six wards that lack 
these associations. I appeal to the 
Bishops of these wards to see that 
at the next report there shall be 
none lacking this organization. We 
have over 3,500 officers, and 32,225 
members. There are 12,752 male 
members between the ages of 14 
and 45, in our Church, who are not 
enrolled. We appeal to the presi- 
dents of stakes, the High Council- 
ors and the Bishops to assist in de- 
creasing this number; we did de- 
crease it last year by 2,429. We 
have 1,400 teachers, and there are 
more than 1,200 classes. Twenty- 
five thousands Manuals are printed 
and sold each year. Many thou- 
sands of dollars are spent every 
year in educating the young people 
of the Latter-day Saints, in our 
Church schools, but all of the edu- 
cation that is given in the Young 
Men's and Young Ladies' Mutual 
Improvement Associations is given 
free of cost. There are over 32,000 
members in the Young Men's asso- 
ciations, and there are more mem- 
bers in the Young Ladies' Mutual 
Improvement Associations ; so there 
are over 60,000 young men and la- 
dies in these two associations. We 
appeal to each and every one. of you 
to take an interest in these associ- 
ations ; and now that the Improve- 
ment Era is the organ of the Priest- 
hood, we appeal to those holding 
the Priesthood to support it. We 
have, from the beginning of the 
magazine, supplied it free to all of 
the missionaries. Over two thou- 
sand copies are going out now to 
the missionaries, free of cost. That

121 



is one of the reasons that we main- 
tain the price at two dollars. We 
also appeal to the people to sustain 
the Young Ladies' Journal. These 
two magazines are doing an im- 
mense amount of good in the com- 
munity ; and every father and moth- 
er interested in the welfare of their 
children should do all that they pos- 
sibly can to increase the membership 
of our Mutual Improvement Associ- 
ations.

PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 

CLOSING REMARKS. 

An appeal for God's blessings upon His 
Church and people. — Admonition to 
exercise wisdom in public speaking. 

I desire to express my thanks and 
gratitude to all the Latter-day 
Saints who have attended this con- 
ference, for the excellent and peace- 
ful spirit that has pervaded our 
meetings and has given, I believe, 
to all who have been present a great 
deal of satisfaction and enjoyment. 

I have felt that, before closing 
the meeting, I would like to read a 
few words of the prayer that was. 
indicted by the Prophet Joseph 
Smith at the time of the dedication 
of the Kirtland temple, as I think 
the prayer and principles set forth 
apply to us at this time as mem- 
bers of the Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints. The prayer 
reads, in part, as follows : 

"Remember all thy Church, O Lord, 
with all their families, and all their im-t 
mediate connections, with all their sick 
and afflicted ones, with all the poor and- 
meek of the earth, that the kingdom 
which thou hast set up without hands, 
may become a great mountain, and fill 
the whole earth. 

"That thy church may come forth out 
of the wilderness of darkness, and shine- 
forth fair as the moon, clear as the sun, 
and terrible as an army with banners. 

"And be adorned as a bride for that 
day when thou shalt unvail the heavens, 
and cause the mountains to flow down 
at thy presence, and the valleys to be 
exalted, the rough places made smooth ; 
that thy glory may fill the earth. 



124 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



"That when the trump shall sound for 
the dead we shall be caught up in the 
cloud to meet thee, that we may ever be 
with the Lord. 

"That our garments may be pure, that 
we may be clothed upon with robes of 
righteousnes, with palms in our hands, 
and crowns of glory upon our heads, and 
reap eternal joy for all our sufferings. 

"O Lord God Almighty, hear us in 
these our petitions, and answer us from 
heaven, thy holy habitation, where thou 
sittest enthroned, with glory, honor, 
power, majesty, might, dominion, truth, 
justice, judgment, mercy, and an infinity 
of fullness, from everlasting to everlast- 
ing. 

"And also this church, to put upon it 
thy name; and help us by the power of 
thy Spirit, that we may mingle our voic- 
es with those bright, shining seraphs 
around thy throne, with acclamations of 
praise, singing, Hosanna to God and the 
Lamb. 

"And let these thine anointed ones be 
clothed with salvation, and thy saints 
shout aloud for joy. Amen." 

We have had a variety of teach- 
ing here during our conference. I 
want to say to the Latter-day Saints 
and to the Elders that have ad- 
dressed us, that, personally, I have 
rejoiced exceedingly in every word 
that has been spoken, wherein the 
proclamation of the Gospel of Jesus 
Christ has been made. I believe 
that the Elders of Israel, and the 
officers of the Church, should devote 
themselves to the proclamation of 
the Gospel of life everlasting, and 
that they should not dwell or seek 
to dwell upon trivial and nonsensi- 
cal things, or upon personal con- 
duct or extraneous affairs. I think 
they should be dignified and sin- 
cere in their spirit and utterances. 
I think they should be moved by 
the spirit of truth and of the in- 
spiration of the Gospel, and consid- 
er that it is their mission to bear 
record of Jesus Chiist, of Joseph 
Smith, and of the divinity of the 
great latter-day work, the founda- 



tions of which Joseph Smith was 
instrumental in the hand of God in 
establishing in the latter day. I be- 
lieve if our brethren will devote 
their thought, their minds and ef- 
forts in this direction, that they will 
please the Lord, they will satisfy 
the saints, and they will fulfill the 
object of their mission better than 
they can possibly do by criticising 
themselves or others, or dwelling 
on the faults and failings of men. 
There never, perhaps, was a time in 
the Church when there were not 
foolish ones amongst us. Some have 
been foolish through overzeal ; some 
have been still more foolish through 
lack of zeal, altogether, — some have 
been foolish in saying things they 
ought never to have said, and oth- 
ers have been guilty before the 
Lord in not saying that which they 
should have said. I presume that 
this condition will remain and con- 
tinue amongst us so long as men 
are imperfect and do not see clear- 
ly, as the Lord sees, and are not 
susceptible to the inspiration and 
promptings of the Holy Spirit, to 
which they are entitled for their 
guidance every day of their lives, 
if they will but live for it. I think 
it is not wise or prudent for me to 
proclaim the short-comings of the 
Church if it has any, or the defects, 
faults, or failings of its members. 
I do not think it is my right or pre- 
rogative to point out the supposed 
defects of the Prophet Joseph 
Smith, or Brigham Young, or any 
other of the leaders of the Church. 
Let the Lord God Almighty judge 
them and speak for or against them 
as it may seem Him good — but not 
I ; it is not for me, my brethren, to 
do this. Our enemies may have tak- 
en advantage of us, in times gone 
by, because of unwise things that 
may have been said. Some of us, 



PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 



125 



may now, give to the world the 
same opportunity to speak evil 
against us, because of that which 
we say which should not be spoken 
at all. 

I felt that it was my duty to say 
this much at the conclusion of this 
conference. When the Lord wants 
to reveal something new to us, He 
knows the channel through which 
to reveal it; He knows that He can 
do it, and He will do it in His own 
way and time, and through the 
proper channels of the Priesthood. 
Don't forget that! 

When this meeting concludes, 
our conference will be adjourned 
for six months, to meet, without 
further consideration, at this place. 

It was announced that John J. 
McClellan, and assistants, will* con- 
tinue to give recitals at 12 m. daily, 
on the great Tabernacle organ, to 
which the public will be admitted 
free, as heretofore. 

The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn : 



We thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet, 

To guide us in these latter days; 
We thank Thee for sending the Gospel 

To lighten our minds with its rays; 
We thank Thee fcr every blessing 

Bestowed by Thy bounteous hand; 
We feel it a pleasure to serve Thee, 

And love to obey Thy command. 

Benediction was pronounced by 
President John R. Winder. 

Conference was adjourned for 
six months. 



Prof. Evan Stephens conducted 
the singing of the choir and congre- 
gation at all the conference meet- 
ings in the Tabernacle, and Prof. 
John J. McClellan played the ac- 
companiments, interludes, etc., on 
the great organ. 

The stenographic reports of the 
discourses were taken by Elders 
Franklin W. Otterstrom, Frederick 
E. Barker, and Fred G. Barker.

Clerk of Conference.

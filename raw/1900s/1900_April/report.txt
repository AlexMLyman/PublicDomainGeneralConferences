DAY, 

PRESIDENT LORENZO SNOW. 
Opening Address. 

My brethren and sisters — I desire a 
deep interest in your faith and prayers. 
When I say this I express the feelings, 
I presume, of every Elder who arises to 
speak to the Latter-day Saints. So far 
as giving information and assisting the 
Latter-day Saints in their faith is con- 
cerned, we are dependent on the Spirit 
of the Lord and, in a measure, the ex- 
ercise of faith by the people of God. 

I am thankful for the blessings that 
have attended me in my endeavors to 
forward the interests of the Church 
and for the prayers and support that I 
have had from the people, who have 
listened to the requirements of the Lord 
and have conformed to them at least 
to a certain extent. 

Seventy years ago this Church was 
organized with six members. We com- 
menced, so to speak, as an infant. We 
had our prejudices to combat. Our ig- 
norance troubled us in regard to what 
the Lord intended to do and what He 
wanted us to do. Through the bless- 
ings of the Lord, however, we managed 
to move along in our stage of infancy, 
receiving support from the Lord as He 
saw proper to give it. We advanced 
into boyhood, and still we undoubtedly 
made some mistakes, which did not 
generally arise from a design to make 
them, but from a lack of experience. 
We understand very well, when we re- 
flect back upon our own lives, that we 
did many foolish things when we were

boys, because of our lack of experience 
and because we had not learned fully 
to obey the instructions of our fathers 
and mothers. "We could not then com- 
prehend that it was absolutely neces- 
sary, for our proper advancement, that 
we should observe the counsels of our 
parents. Many of us afterwards learned 
It, but too late perhaps to correct our- 
selves. Yet as we advanced the ex- 
perience of the past materially assist- 
ed us to avoid such mistakes as we 
had made in our boyhood. 

It has been so with the Church. Our 
errors have generally arisen from a lack 
of comprehending' what the Lord re- 
quired us to do. But now we are pret- 
ty well along to manhood; we are sev- 
enty years of age, and one would 
imagine that after a man had lived 
through his infancy, through his boy- 
hood, and on until he had arrived at 
the age of seventy years, he would be 
able, through his long experience, to do 
a great many things that seemed im- 
possible and in fact were impossible 
for him to do in his boyhood state. 
When we examine ourselves, however, 
we discover that we are still not doing 
exactly as we ought to do, notwith- 
standing all our experience. We dis- 
cern that there are things which we fail 
to do that the Lord expects us to per- 
form, some of which he required us to 
do in our boyhood. But we feel thank- 
ful and grateful that we are enabled 
now, through our past experience, to 
accomplish many things that we could 
not do in former times and that we are 
able to escape individual sins that have 
brought trouble upon us in times past. 
While we congratulate ourselves in this 
direction, we certainly ought to feel 
that we have not yet arrived at per- 
fection. There are many things for us 
to do yet. 

The Lord has prospered us amazingly, 
and we are doing large things at the 
present time. We are blessing the peo- 
ple of the world. We are sending well 
on towards two thousand Elders out 
into the missionary field, and we learn 
that they are having very good success; 
and notwithstanding all the difficulties 
that seemingly have arisen to make 
trouble for the Latter-day Saints, we 
are pleased to find that it has all tend- 
ed to good. Our Elders in the mission 



fields tell us that the excitement which 
has been created and carried on 
almost universally throughout the 
United States has caused people 
to become wonderfully interested to 
know what Mormonism is, and, in or- 
der to get an understanding of our 
principles, they flock to our meetings. 
Because of this the Elders feel very 
grateful. This is what we wish and 
what there has been a difficulty in ac- 
complishing, that is, in getting the peo- 
ple out to hear what we have to say, 
so that they might understand what 
Mormonism really is from those who 
understand what it is, instead of re- 
ceiving it from those who understand 
nothing at all about it, only as they 
hear stories concerning it. So this is 
going on all right and will work all 
right. We ought to be very grateful 
that this missionary work is being ac- 
complished so successfully by the 
many Elders that are now in the vari- 
ous missionary fields. 

We are also establishing colonies here 
and there. We are sending many fami- 
lies into Canada, and they are moving 
along very successfully. We are 
about to send a hundred families into 
the Big Horn region, in the State of 
Wyoming, and Latter-day Saints are 
moving into other places and building 
up the country. 

Now that we are approaching our 
seventy-first year.the Lord expects that 
we will do something — something that 
will cause the nations to marvel, as 
what we have done has caused them 
already to wonder. 

Now, Latter-day Saints, how is it 
with us? We have received the Gos- 
pel. We have received the kingdom 
of God, established on the earth. We 
have had trouble; we have been per- 
secuted. We. were driven from Ohio; 
we were driven from Missouri; we 
were driven from Nauvoo; and once 
we were driven for a time from this 
beautiful city. Many have lost thous- 
ands of dollars; lost their homes and 
all they had, and some of the brethren 
have seen their wives and children lay 
down their lives because of 
the hardships they had to ex- 
perience during these changes, these 
persecutions, these revolutions and 
these drivings. The people have

looked with astonishment at the 
willingness of the Latter-day Saints 
to suffer these things. Why do 
we do this? Why do we adhere to 
these principles that have caused us at 
times so much grief and sacrifice? 
What is it that enables us to endure 
these persecutions and still rejoice? It 
is because we have had revelations 
from the Almighty; because He has 
spoken to us in our souls and has given 
to us the Holy Ghost, which is a prin- 
ciple of revelation wherever it exists 
and is promised to every man, as in 
the days of the former Apostles, who 
will believe, repent of his sins and be 
immersed in water for the remission of 
them by those who have the authority 
from the Lord to administer this ordi- 
nance. Jesus, when he was among the 
children of men, said that He would 
build His Church upon this principle 
of revelation and the gates of hell should 
not prevail against it. When He was 
in Cesareea He asked His disciples 
"Whom do men say that I the Son of 
Man am?" He had been performing 
miracles and accomplishing the most 
astonishing wonders in the midst of the 
people. What did the people learn 
from these things and what did they 
think of Him? As the Apostles re- 
plied, some said that He was John the 
Baptist, risen from the dead; some 
thought He was one of the former 
Prophets, while others thought He was 
Elias. The Savior said to His dis- 
ciples "But whom say ye that I am?" 
Peter replied "Thou art the Christ, the 
Son of the Living God." How did he 
find it out? On the same principle 
that you and I have found out that 
Joseph Smith was a Prophet of God, 
who, like Noah, was sent into the 
world to give the people warning before 
the great burning should occur and to 
call upon them to repent of their sins. 
Peter had found it out by the principle 
of revelation. He had not learned 
this of man, nor by reading the an- 
cient Scriptures, but the Lord had re- 
vealed it unto him. Jesus said unto him, 
"Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-jona; 
for flesh and blood hath not re- 
vealed it unto thee, but my Father 
which is in heaven. And I say also unto 
thee, that thou art Peter; and upon this 
rock I will build my Church; and the 



gates of hell shall not prevail against 
it." The Church of Christ today is built 
upon this same principle, and the gates 
of hell shall not prevail against it. 
They did not prevail against us in our 
infancy; they did not in our boyhood; 
they did not in our early manhood; and 
I will assure you they will not now 
that we are seventy years old. 

This Church will stand, because it is 
upon a firm basis. It is not from man; 
it is not from the study of the New 
Testament or the Old Testament; it is 
not the result of the learning that we 
received in colleges nor seminaries, but 
it has come directly from the Lord. The 
Lord has shown it to us by the reveal- 
ing principle of 4;he Holy Spirit of light 
and every man can receive this same 
spirit. 

In the days of Noah the people of that 
generation had the privilege of knowing 
whether Noah spoke from the Lord and 
whether the message that he claimed to 
have from the Lord was genuine or not. 
They, could have had a revelation for 
themselves, because he preached the 
Gospel as you and I now preach it in 
the world, and they could have known 
that their salvation depended upon their 
receiving and obeying this message 
which Noah delivered unto them. In 
the days of Jesus it was the same. But 
no person can know that Jesus is the 
Son of God, except by revelation. That 
was the way Peter received it. The 
Lord is a consistent being. He does not 
require the people to do that which is 
improper, nor does he expect of them 
anything unreasonable. He gives us a 
knowledge of what we shall do, inas- 
much as we are willing to sacrifice our 
lives rather than go contrary to that 
knowledge. He opens to us the secrets 
of the celestial kingdom, and he is con- 
stantly communicating to us things 
that we never knew before. This knowl- 
edge and intelligence is growing upon 
us continually. 

Ought we not to be thankful, 
therefore, today? Every man and 
woman within the sound of my 
voice ought to be grateful 
that circumstances are as favorable 
as they are. Everything is for us and 
nothing can prevent our moving for- 
ward now in our seventy-first year. 
There is no power that can prevent us,

as there has been none in the past. We 
have received too much knowledge to 
be thwarted in our purposes. Those 
who desire to persecute and overthrow 
Mormonism, let them go on and do their 
work; that is for them to do. Our work 
is to grow in the knowledge of God, to 
keep the commandments of God, to be 
faithful and to continue to increase and 
to become more and more perfect as we 
advance in years. 

God bless you, brethren and sisters. 
We rejoice to see you here. You have 
come that you might be blessed that 
you might get information that will be 
of service to you and knowledge that 
will increase your intelligence; and 
there will be from fifteen to twenty 
speakers, I am sure that every person 
who has come here for the purpose of 
receiving information and being blessed 
will have the opportunity, through some 
of the speakers, to get something that 
will be very valuable to them for the 
future scenes through which they will 
be called to pass. 

God bless you, brethren and sisters, 
and may we have a glorious time and 
one of the best conferences that we 
have ever had, is my prayer, in the 
name of Jesus. Amen. 



ELDER BRIGHAM YOUNG. 

God has brought the Saints through every ordeal — 
Tithe-paying not a question of Monty, but of 
priuciple — The Redemption of Zion. 

I take great pleasure in bearing testi- 
mony to the remarks that have been 
made by President Snow this morning. 
I am thankful to God and to our Presi- 
dent for the testimony that he has giv- 
en us. It arouses in my mind many re- 
flections, brings before me the past his- 
tory of this Church and foreshadows 
the future destiny of this people. God 
has been merciful to the Latter-day 
Saints, and if there are any men oppos- 
ing us that have the idea that we do not 
pray for them, they are mistaken. We 
pray the Lord to soften the hearts of 
our enemies. We pray that they may 
be turned from their evil ways and not 
kick against the pricks, but seek to 
forsake the evil that is within them and 
to do good. They are, however, in the 
hands of God, as we are. 

We are glad to know that this people 
have gained victory after victory. They 



have marched on, conquering and to 
conquer. In our youth, as stated by our 
President, when struggling against 
fearful odds, we came out greater, no- 
bler, better soldiers of the cross than 
when we entered into this vortex of 
persecution; and now in our manhood, 
in our riper years, thank God that we 
have heard the voice of our leader say- 
ing that we are marching on to success 
and victory— to the time when men and 
nations will arise up and say, "Thou 
blessed people, that have fought the 
good fight, that have led the way and 
established righteousness in the land 
of our fathers." I expect to see this 
day. There is no power that can bat- 
tle successfully against our Father and 
God. If we are His people, we are sure 
to win. If we are not His, how is it 
that we have been so suc- 
cessful from the beginning? 
and have through His power, in which 
we have trusted, grown to be seventy 
years old, instead of being a mere 
child in swaddling clothes? God has 
done it; He has given us these rights 
and blessings. I felt in my heart while 
the President was talking that I could 
prophesy to those who fight against us. 
Do your worst; do your best; try to ac- 
complish all the evil that is in your 
hearts; but as true as God lives this 
kingdom will sweep on, this Church 
will progress, and the Kingdom of God 
will be as the stone cut out of the mouru 
tain without hands— it will crush all 
opposition. Now, that is not disloyal, 
because God will do it, not man. 

I am not opposed to any man who 
seeks to do right. I am not opposed 
to any government that seeks to give 
liberty to the people and the privilege 
to exercise that free agency which Go^ 
has given to all men. Every man an'; 
woman must have their agency. No 
man can take- it from the sons and 
daughters of our Father. 

It occurred to me this morning while 
sitting here that if I happened to be 
called upon to speak, I would read a 
part of the 29th chapter of Alma, in the 
Book of Mormon. 

"O, that I were an angel, and could 
have the wish of mine heart, that I 
might go forth and speak with the 
trump of God. with a voice to shrke 
the earth, and cry repentance unto 
every people; 



ELDER BRIG HAM YOUNG.

"Yea, I would declare unto every soul 
as with a voice of thunder, repentance, 
and the plan of redemption, that they 
should repent and- come unto our God, 
that there might not be more sorrow 
upon all the face of the earth. 

"But behold, I am a man, and do sin 
in my wish; for I ought to be content 
with the things which the Lord hath 
allotted unto .me. 

"I ought not to harrow up in my de- 
sires, the firm decree of a just God, 
for I know that he granteth unto men 
according to their desire, whether it be 
unto death or unto life; yea, I know 
that he alloteth unto men, according to 
their wills; whether they be unto sal- 
vation or unto destruction. 

"Tea, and I know that good and evil 
have come before all men; for he that 
knoweth not good from evil is 
blameless; but he that knoweth 
good and evil, to him it is 
given according to his desires; whether 
he desireth good or evil, to him it is 
given according to his desires; whether 
he desireth good or evil, life or death, 
joy or remorse of conscience. 

"Now seeing that I know these things, 
why should I desire more than to per- 
form the work to which I have been 
called. 

"Why should I desire that I was an 
angel, that I could speak unto all the 
ends of the earth. 

"For behold, the Lord doth grant unto 
all nations, of their own nation and 
tongue, to teach his word; yea, in wis- 
dom, all that he seeth fit that they 
should have; therefore we see that the 
Lord doth counsel in wisdom, accord- 
ing to that which is just and true." 

The Lord is with his people, and I 
know it. We have learned to know 
good from evil. Three score years and 
ten shall be the days of man on earth. 
We have arrived at the full stature of 
a man; for we are three score years' 
and ten this day, and if this people 
will arise in their manhood, as they 
have struggled to their feet in their 
childhood and youth, God will give them 
the strength of a man. They shall have 
the power to build up and inhabit, to 
sow and reap, and if the snows do not 
come in the mountains, God will send 
through the faith of the people, the 
pleasant rains to moisten the earth, that 
vegetation may spring forth and glad- 
den the hearts of all. Now I learn a 
good many lessons myself from what I 
read to you, though I have not reflected 
so much perhaps as 1 will on the words 
of Alma. 

I heard a man say in relation to tith- 
ing, "I don'.t want to pay my tithing, 
unless I can make a showing that will 



be a credit to me and really help to 
build up Zion. If I could put in ten 
thousand dollars, I would be glad to do 
it, but I have nothing. I could pay a 
little tithing, but the idea seems ridicu- 
lous for me to step forward and pay a 
dollar in tithing. It seems to me like 
I was making a mockery of this sacred 
principle." But I take the other view 
of this, and I said to him, "My friend, 
if you were a child and received five 
cents, I would caution you to remem- 
ber the fact that you owed half a cent 
tithing, and when you had received an- 
other and another five cents, until they 
amounted to fifty cents, I would advise 
you to go and pay your tithing on that, 
not for the sake of the money, but for 
the sake of principle." If it were a 
question of money, where would 
have been the salvation of 
this people? When President Snow 
was speaking this morning I felt that 
the power of God was manifest in our 
preservation, and that money had noth- 
ing to do with it. The everlasting pow- 
er of our Father has brought this peo- 
ple to see this auspicious day. If every 
man and woman would follow the ex- 
ample of the widow and cast in their 
mites, they would be acting upon prin- 
ciple. The amount of money paid has 
nothing to do with it. It is the principle 
which God has commanded us to ob- 
serve. This is the idea that we want to 
instill into the hearts of the people of 
this generation, especially at this time, 
when the servant of God has delivered 
unto you and me the message that the 
time has come when this revelation, 
given on the 8th day of July, 1838, in 
Far West, Caldwell county, Missouri, 
must be observed. That revelation has 
now come to the front. It is as if God 
had inspired His servant to write a new 
revelation to the people, which must be 
observed, because it lies at the founda- 
tion of our prosperity in these moun- 
tains. General Thomas L. Kane once 
said to me, "This land, on the back- 
bone of the American continent, from 
Mexico to Canada, it seems to me, be- 
longs to the "Mormon" people. They led 
the way into the Rocky mountains, and 
occupied these valleys, and they ought 
to have the land." Well, there are not 
many people that think that, but I am 
of the same opinion as General Kane. 
We ou^ht to have this land. But in 



8 



GENERAL CONFEREE CE. 



relation to our preservation upon this 
land, I have felt sometimes very inse- 
cure. Alma wished that he were an 
angel, that his voice could be heard by 
the whole world and that he could con- 
vert all the sons and daughters of 
Adam to the Gospel which he had re- 
ceived. I would that I had a hundred 
thousand dollars to pay in as tithing, 
because it would make a good showing 
and I would be talked about. And 
some have the ambition to be spoken of 
in the midst of Israel. But I want to 
say to you that tithing is a principle 
that God has established for the train- 
ing of men. It has been with us in 
our childhood and in our boy- 
hood and in our young manhood, 
and apparently it has almost been a 
dead letter at times. But the revela- 
tion has come to us in our manhood, 
when we have reached a stage wherein 
we know God, and having received this 
knowledge and being of the full stature 
of a man, we can rise up as one man 
and obey this commandment, which 
has come from God through His author- 
ized servant. I appeal to you on this 
point. Let every man and woman in 
this Church arise and do that which 
God has called upon them to do, that 
this land may be sanctified and be a 
land of safety unto us. I do not wish 
to utter a threat, but I do know this: 
every time we have disregarded and 
set at naught the commandments of 
Almighty God, we have paid for it. 
We must learn, if it must needs be by 
the things we suffer. By and by the 
Saints will prove to all concerned that 
this principle of tithing is dear to them, 
and they will surely fulfill to the very 
letter what God has called upon them 
to do. 

In a little time you will hear some- 
thing like this: "Well, the 'Mormons' 
are moving again. They are leaving 
Utah, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, 
Old Mexico, Wyoming, Idaho and all 
these places wherever they are located, 
and they are having another exodus." 
Where are they going? Why, you will 
find out that it will be a pretty strong 
company going down to Jackson coun- 
ty, Missouri, to redeem and build up 
Zion, but the word will go forth that 
the "Mormons" are having another 
exodus. The people will sav that we 



are going down to inhabit this land of 
Missouri, and "we are willing they 
should." Some that are afar off may 
howl, but the people mostly interested 
will be glad to see the "Mormons" re- 
turn to that land and build it up. 
Some will say "We have been upon 
that land and it has proved a land of 
death unto us." They will have suf- 
fered the full force of that desolating 
sickness which will cover the land, even 
in Jackson county, Missouri. But when 
our leader calls upon the Lat- 
ter-day Saints that are worthy 
to move down there, the land will be 
prepared for the Latter-day Saints— 
not "Mormons." Those who go to 
Jackson county in that day will be Lat- 
ter-day Saints. The "Mormons" will 
be left in Utah, with enough Latter-day 
Saints to control them. 

I will tell you what is in my heart. 
We are preparing this day in our man- 
hood for the most glorious epoch that 
has ever come to man upon the earth. 
If you do not feel in your hearts that 
this is the most glorious day that we 
ever witnessed on this earth, then you 
do not feel as I do. I feel that there is 
more of the spirit of God, more wisdom, 
more knowledge, more light, more in- 
telligence and a better union among 
those that are Latter-day Saints than 
I ever witnessed in my life. I bear 
you my testimony that the providences 
of God have been with this people, and 
the scenes that will come before us will 
be such that we will need all the power 
and all the union that, we can get to 
stand and accomplish His work. Now 
is the accepted time to thrust in our 
sickles and reap that which has been 
sown among us and which is now ripe. 
It was sown in 1838; it is ripe today. 
That revelation is ripe and the fulfill- 
ment of it is ripe. We are now in our 
manhood, when we can receive and act 
upon it without question. God will 
bear us off victorious and we can smile 
like Him who sits in the heavens and 
laughs, for we are told that He shall 
have the wicked in derision, and this 
people will smile to see the fruitless ef- 
forts of those who would retard the 
progress of the work. They may have 
been successful sometimes in the past 
for a little season, but through it all 
they have seen us grow until we have

now arrived to our full manhood. 
Thank God we see this day. God bless 
you and all who are interested 
in this work, is my humble prayer, in 
the name of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER F. M. LYMAN. 

The Spirit of God the source of Union— Why the 
Saints are a peculiar people— The coming of 
Christ and Redemption of Zion— Necessity for 
preparation. 

While I attempt to speak to you, my 
brethren and sisters, I trust I mav be 
able to make you hear, and that by the 
aid of the Spirit of the Lord we may 
feel encouraged and strengthened in our 
faith. We meet together frequently as 
a Church in general conference for the 
transaction of business and to receive 
the word of the Lord. We have the 
ancient Scriptures and we have the 
modern Scriptures, and scriptures are 
being made now, as has always been 
the case when the Lord has had His 
Church upon the earth, with the living 
oracles; for when they speak by the in- 
spiration of the Holy Ghost, what they 
say is scripture. We are entitled to 
know individually whether our brethren 
speak to us the truth, for it is our 
privilege to enjoy the same Spirit that 
they speak by. This is the power that 
binds the Latter-day Saints together, 
and that holds us to our obligations 
and covenants with the Lord and with 
each other. We are not held by threats, 
nor by fear, but by love — the love of 
the Gospel, which has been planted in 
our hearts and has been growing with 
the people for these seventy years. We 
have become a pretty well trained peo- 
ple, and four-fifths of the Latter- 
day Saints, I believe, are doing 
tolerably well, and I believe 
that the one-fifth that are care- 
less in some things, are perhaps labor- 
ing fairly well in others. There will 
no doubt be Quite a percentage of the 
people that will not be found num- 
bered among the wise. 

While listening to Brother Brigham 
Young and to President Snow, the para, 
ble put forth by our Savior, as re- 
corded in the 25th chapter of Matthew, 
was presented to my mind, and I 
thought to read it, that we might be 
brought to consider by its examination 
whether we are numbered among the 
wise or among the foolish. This 



is a very important matter; 
for if we travel along 
with this Church for twenty 
years, for thirty, forty or fifty years, 
and then at the last find that we have 
failed to save our souls and that we are 
among the foolish, it will be very un- 
profitable to us. As President Snow has 
said, we are gathered together for the 
building up of the kingdom of God up- 
on the earth, and there is some reason 
why we should be thus gathered; why 
we should take upon us the obligations 
that we have; why we should endure 
the hardships that we have; why we 
should, among all the denominations on 
the earth, be singled out for the despis- 
ing of all people, and why this condi- 
tion should stay with us and follow us 
in preference to any other people in 
the world. We are a small people, not 
very important in numbers nor in 
wealth, and yet every little while some- 
thing occurs that creates quite a furore 
in regard to the Latter-day Saints. The 
whole world becomes agitated and in a 
ferment over the Latter-day Saints, 
and there is trouble in the hearts of 
many people for fear the Latter-day 
Saints will do something very wrong. 
What is the matter? Are the Latter- 
day Saint© minding the business of any 
other denomination? Are we troubling 
ourselves particularly about our breth- 
ren who have other forms of religion? 
Are we excited and worried over them? 
Do we combine together with some 
other people in order to look after the 
morality and purity, or the immorality 
and corruption of other people? How 
carefully the Latter-day Saints attend 
to their own business! And is it not a 
proper thing for the Latter-day Saints 
to take care of themselves, their own 
morality and honesty? Shall we not 
give attention to our own affairs, and 
are we not just about of the same ma- 
terial, the same kind of people, as our 
other religious brethren? Have we not 
come from among other denominations? 
Have we not been gathered from among 
the Catholics, the Presbyterians, the 
Methodists, the Baptists, the Congrega- 
tionalists and the Christians, as well as 
the infidels? Now, have we gone 
to these various denominations 
and gathered the very worst of them? 
Have we ever advertised in our peri- 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



odicals and In our preaching and labors, 
publicly or privately — have we ever bid 
for the bad Methodists, the bad Presby- 
terians, the bad infidels? Have we 
ever promised them an easy way of sal- 
vation? Have we done any of these 
things, or have we gone to the world 
conscientiously and honestly and laid 
before them the offer of life and salva- 
tion on consistent and Christian terms? 
Have we ever promised anybody that 
they could be saved in their sins? Have 
we ever asked anybody to come into 
this Church without repentance, with- 
out reformation, without honesty, with- 
out virtue? Have we entered into a 
compact with anybody to be corrupt? 
Have we promised them immunity from 
the punishment of the law if they 
transgressed the law? Do we cover up 
their sins and hide them? Are we do- 
ing that? Are Bishops, Presidents of 
Stakes, Presidents of quorums, Elders, 
High Priests and Seventies asking the 
corrupt and wicked from among the 
nations of the earth to come to us and 
we will shield them in their corruption, 
in their adulteries, their fornications, 
their thieving and their dishonesty? 
"Why no. But we have presented to 
the world a very startling and re- 
markable work, a work that requires 
repentance and reformation. And when 
repentance has been complied with, in 
order that that repentance may be 
genuine and the forgiveness of sins con- 
tinue, it must be eternal. It is not 
enough for men to repent in order to 
come into the Church, and then do as 
they please, but their repentance must 
be perpetual; it must not need to be 
repented of. If a man has been a thief 
and ceases to steal, he must continue 
to refrain from his larcenies. If a man 
has been a liar, a deceiver, or currupt 
in any degree whatever, it is required of 
him m this Church that he must 
cease forever. If he should live 
a hundred years, he would not 
live long enough to have any de- 
gree of allowance shown to him for 
transgression because of his age, but 
the older men are the better they must 
be. I think that is reasonable; for the 
oldest of all whom we have ever heard 
of is said to be good and the only one 
that is entirely good — our Father who 
is in heaven. I say the father should 



be better than the son, the n. other 
should be better than the daughter, and 
this Church has now arrived at the 
full ripe age of three score and ten. 
What shall we do who have been en- 
trusted with the holy Priesthood? Can 
we afford to be indifferent and care- 
less? We are now seventy years near- 
er to the coming of the Son of Man 
than we were when the Prophet Jos- 
eph, under the inspiration of the Holy 
Ghost, organized this Church. After- 
this extended experience, can we not 
well afford to be good, conscientious 
and honest with the Lord. Can we not 
afford to make our repentance and re- 
formation genuine from this time forth, 
believing that the coming of the Son of 
Man, the redemption of Zion and the 
fulfillment of the purposes of the Lord 
are at our door? 

Can we not afford to do this now, so 
that when the Bridegroom comes we 
shall be prepared to meet Him; for 
He will come; he has always come 
when he has promised. He has visited 
the earth in this dispensation and has 
established his authority and power 
among men, and the Millennium, the 
reign of righteousness, is to be ushered 
in; and it is liable to come in our day. 
The redemption of Zion is also liable 
to come in our day. There is doubtless 
a set time for the redemption of Zion 
and for the coming of the Son of Man. 
The time has not been made known to 
us, and is not likely to be, until He 
comes. It would hardly be fair for the 
Presidency, the Twelve, and the presid- 
ing brethren to know the very time of 
His coming, so that they could be pre- 
pared, and let the people be indifferent 
and careless. The coming of the Son of 
Man will be as much ,of a surprise to 
the presiding brethren as to 
any others. That is, it will 
occur when they are not looking for it 
particularly. "We hope to be prepared, 
and we hope the people will be pre- 
pared, but it will come suddenly, and 
you will know it as soon as we know it. 
We have the Spirit of that coming, and 
the Spirit of the redemption of Zion. 
We have the Spirit that indicates that 
in the near future the Lord will appear. 

Hence, the Spirit of the Lord has been 
very powerfully upon President Snow 
and his brethren, and they have been

led to urge upon the people the import- 
ance of reformation, not alone in the 
law of tithing, but in every other prin- 
ciple of the Gospel. Tithing alone is 
not enough. It will yield its measure 
of oil and light, and of inspiration and 
power, to those who observe that law. 
But if we are non-prayers, non-partak- 
ers of the Sacrament; if we are not 
found doing by others that we would 
that others should do by us; if we are 
not honest and virtuous, the fact of 
our being tithe-payers will not be 
enough to save us. But it is pretty well 
discovered and understood that if men 
can stand the test of the law of tith- 
ing, which appeals to our wealth, they 
will be able to make other sacrifices as. 
well; for there is a strength and a' 
power which comes in answer to our 
fulfillment of this law that will enable 
us to do other things much less diffi- 
cult. There are many things less diffi- 
cult than the payment of tithing. In 
our fallen condition, being of the 
earth earthy, we love the things of this 
world, and it is a most difficult thing 
for some of us to meet this requirement 
of the Lord. There is quite a percen- 
tage of the brethren who have received 
the Priesthood, as well as members of 
the Church, who ought to be tithe- 
payers and are not. I want to ask any 
man upon whom I have ever laid my 
hands and conferred authority in the 
name of the Lord Jesus; I want to ask 
any brother who has ever had the 
hands of the servants of God 
laid upon his head, to con- 
fer the Priesthood of God 
upon him, can you reconcile your course 
of life, if you neglect to furnish the 
revenue necessary for the building up 
of the kingdom of God on the earth? 
Can you justify yourself in this? I 
want the High Priest, the Seventy and 
the Elder to come to me as an individ- 
ual and show to me his philosophy and 
reasoning as to how he can conscien- 
tiously hold the Priesthood of God and 
yet decline to meet the obligations that 
belong to that Priesthood. I believe 
that there is no man in this Church en- 
titled to the holy Priesthood who will 
not magnify it. I believe the Lord re- 
quires it of every Deacon, every Teach- 
er, every Priest, every Elder, every 
High Priest, every Seventy, every Pa- 



triarch, every Bishop, President, etc. 
And we .will not always be tolerated 
with the authority of God unless we do 
honor it. We will be found among the 
foolish, lacking oil in our lamps and be- 
ing unprepared for the coming of the 
Son of Man, unless we attend faithfully 
to these duties. 

Is a man justified in this church who 
fails to partake of the Sacrament when 
the opportunity is offered? Is a man 
justified who does not bow his knee be- 
fore the Lord daily, and who forgets the 
Lord in secret prayer? I think not. I 
believe that the Latter-day Saints are 
required to meet all these obligations 
and to be as honest with their brethren 
as they are required to be honest with 
the Lord. It is not enough for us to 
pretend to be honest with the Lord, and 
not be honest with our brethren. 
We cannot be honest enough 
with our Father in heaven to justify us 
in being dishonest with our brethren. 
We must meet our obligations to our 
brethren, to our families, to the world. 
We must deal honestly and conscien- 
tiously in all these things. If we do 
not.the spirit of the Lord will withdraw 
from us, and when the spirit of the 
Lord withdraws from us, we complain, 
we find fault, we are not happy, and we 
are not satisfied. We cannot afford 
to sacrifice the presence of the 
spirit of the Lord, because we cannot 
be Latter-day Saints unless we enjoy it 
and are directed by it constantly. It 
seems to be a difficult thing to do to 
meet our temporal obligations to the 
Lord. Our hearts are naturally set up- 
on the things of this world. We can 
see temporal blessings a little plainer 
than we can see the spiritualities of the 
kingdom, for they are here before us, 
and we enjoy them. We are inclined 
to gather the things of this world 
around us and to treasure them up, 
while the spiritual things, and eternal 
life with our families and friends here- 
after, pertain to the future. They are 
a little ahead of us, and if we do not 
have the spirit of the Lord strongly in 
our hearts, there is more or less a ques- 
tion of doubt and misgiving about 
them. All these things, however, van- 
ish when we discharge the duties that 
devolve upon us as Latter-day Saints. 
And we expect to look after every man,

through the Presidents, the Bishops, 
and the Apostles, and see to it that all 
who have been entrusted with the au- 
thority and power of God, shall come to 
the mark and do their duties faithfully 
and well, that they with their families 
may be saved. We want you to be 
saved; but if you do not want the sal- 
vation that is offered through the Gos- 
pel of the Lord Jesus Christ, why make 
the profession that you do? There is 
no salvation in professions alone, or in 
promises and covenants, nor is there 
any salvation in the blessings that are 
put upon us under the hands of the ser- 
vants of God, unless we do the will of 
God. I want to bear that testimony to 
this people, and ask that from this time 
forward we serve the Lord with all our 
hearts, so that when the Son of Man 
appears upon the earth, we will be 
numbered among the wise virgins of 
my text — which I have not read; you 
can hunt it for yourselves. 

We feel encouraged in our labors, al- 
though we are all the time trying to 
stir the people up. Yet in our coun- 
cils the Lord has manifested to us 
that the Latter-day Saints are 
improving, that they are gaining 
strength and power, increasing in num- 
bers, spreading abroad and becoming 
more firmly established on the earth, 
and that prosperity and success are at- 
tending upon them. The best days that 
we have ever had are the days in which 
we live now. The kingdom is the Lord's 
and He will take care of it. It is our 
business, my brethren and sisters, to 
see that we take care of ourselves. The 
Lord will take care of the Kingdom, 
and no power on earth can prevail 
against it. As suggested this morning, 
if it was secure when it was organized 
seventy years ago, with only six mem- 
bers, what shall we say of it when 
it numbers over a quarter of a million? 
We certainly feel encouraged. We feel 
as though we were on the Lord's side, 
and that the Lord is on our side. We 
know He is, for He talks to us and 
directs us in all things pertaining to 
this Kingdom. He sustains His ser- 
vant the Prophet, and magnifies him 
in the eyes of the people. The will of 
God is known, and the keys and au- 
thority of God are always present. The 
Lord has established His work, and 



He will preserve it.. God bless you, 
my brethren and sisters, and may Hi» 
Spirit fill >ur hearts, that we may re- 
joice exceedingly in this conference, is 
my prayer through Jesus Christ, our 
Lord. Amen. 

The choir sang the anthem: 
"Jesus, I my cross have taken."

PRESIDENT GEORGE Q. CANNON. 

Why Ihe Saints are interested in current events— 
Th"ir gathering a phenomenal movement — 
Kiv.^rence for the authority of God. 

The presence of such a large congre- 
gation makes one feel the necessity of 
having some aid other than human to 
enable the speaker to instruct and edi- 
fy so many souls. I have that feeling 
this afternoon. It is an impressive sight 
to look from this stand on this large 
body of people, all gathered here for the 
purpose of being fed and instructed in 
the ways of the Lord, many having left 
their homes probably hundreds of miles 
distant to come to this conference, and 
in so doing having the right to expect 
that they will receive something from 
the Lord to compensate them for the 
time and labor which they have ex- 
pended, in the journey. This being the 
case. I for one am deeply impressed 
with the importance of saying some- 
thing, by the help of the Lord, that will 
be a benefit to all of us. Without the 
spirit of God, I know it is useless to at- 
tempt to speak to the people; but we 
are promised that if we come together 
as we have done today, in faith, the 
Lord will give us that which shall be 
profitable. * Every conference that we

hold in this house seems more important 
than the preceding one. Our circum- 
stances are constantly changing; we 
are passing through different scenes, 
and the events which take place shape 
themselves in such a manner as to call 
forth deep reflections on our part. 

I suppose there is no community up- 
on the face of the earth that is so in- 
terested in that which is taking place 
in the world as the Latter-day Saints 
are. All the people take great inter- 
est in that which transpires in our 
own nation and in foreign 
nations. We are interested spec- 
tators of public events. The 
wars, the commotions, the revolutions 
among the inhabitants of the earth, and 
also the elemental disturbances that oc- 
cur, are -all noticed by us, because in 
our minds they have a bearing on the 
great future that lies before the earth 
and the inhabitants thereof. If there is 
an earthquake, if there is a famine, 
if there is a wave sweeping over some 
portion of the earth, if there are 
cyclones and disturbances in the at- 
mosphere, if there are pestilences and 
plagues, if there are wars and con- 
tentions, they all attract our atten- 
tion, because we are expecting calami- 
ties of this character. We have been 
gathered together from the nations of 
the earth, and for a definite purpose. 
The men and women who have left 
their native land and come to these 
mountains have not made the journey 
in vain. They would be very much 
surprised if there were not occurrences 
which would in their estimation justify 
them in having taken this journey. So 
far they have not been disappointed. 
There are very few Latter-day Saints 
who regret the step they took in leav- 
ing their native land. They see ample 
justification for their action. If they 
are true to their religion especially, 
they feel that they have been amply 
repaid for coming here by the blessings 
which they have received. No doubt 
this will be the case more and more, 
because Zion is to be a place of safety. 
The words of the prophets concerning 
Zion and the last days will be literally 
fulfilled, and all that has prompted this 
mighty movement among the different 
nations of the earth will be made plain. 
I think it one of the greatest phenome- 



na that has ever been witnessed among 
mankind, the gathering together of 
these hundreds of thousands of people 
from the far distant lands where they 
lived. It is unprecedented in history; 
it is marvelous in its execution, and it 
is one of the world's great movements. 
In years to come it will be regarded 
as one of the phenomenal movements 
of the inhabitants of the earth. 

We have come to this conference for 
the purpose of hearing the word of the 
Lord. I believe before we separate we 
shall be abundantly satisfied, and feel 
that the Lord has been with us. There 
are a great many subjects that may be 
talked about. The field is vast, because 
the instructions that we receive here are 
intended to cover the whole life of the 
Latter-day Saint. 

We have heard this morning a good 
many instructions that have been valu- 
able, and I can bear testimony to the 
truth of them. This is a mighty work, 
and it is achieving mighty results. The 
brethren spoke this morning about our 
union, and praised it. Well, we are very 
united in some things; but in my opin- 
ion we are far from being the united 
people we should be. My mind of late 
has dwelt considerably upon the want 
of reverence there is among us for the 
Priesthood of the Son of God. Now, I 
may say some things in this connection 
that may not be suitable in the opinion 
of some; but I have strong feelings on 
this subject. I have felt that too much 
reverence can not be shown to the 
Priesthood of the Son of God. I think it 
has been a characteristic^ of my life to 
entertain extreme reverence for the 
men who bear the Priesthood. I had 
this feeling when a boy, in the days of 
Joseph. To me Joseph was perfect. I 
could not see, and I did not hear any- 
thing that ever made any impression 
upon me to the contrary. It was so with 
my feeling for President Young. I 
was intimately associated with him the 
last twelve years of his life. I saw him 
in private and in public. I saw him 
when he laid aside, it might be said, 
his reserve and would unbend and talk 
with familiarity. There was one fea- 
ture in his character that won my ad- 
miration, and I have not lost it to this 
day — I never heard President Young 
utter an expression that would weaken 



♦ 

12 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



anybody's respect for the Prophet 
Joseph. He admired him; he looked 
upon him as the Prophet of God, as he 
was. I do not think that anyone else 
ever heard an expresssion from him 
that would tend in any manner to 
weaken respect, or reverence, or love 
for the Prophet Joseph Smith. I ad- 
mired that in his character. And 
though I was closely associat- 
ed with him, I never saw a fault 
in Brigham Young. I expect many 
would think this very foolish in me, and 
that I must have been very blind. Per- 
haps I was; at any rate, I wanted to 
be. I never wanted to see his faults. 
I think it was Pope who said: 

"Be to her faults a little blind, 
And to her virtues over kind." 

That was the feeling I had concerning 
President Young. I wanted to be blind 
to the faults of the man of God. I 
knew he was a fallible man, a human 
being; but I did not want to sit in 
judgment upon him, nor to criticise his 
words and acts. To me he was God's 
servant. God had chosen him out of 
all the men on earth to hold the keys — 
that power, awful in tsome respects, 
which God commits to one man on 
earth at a time. He had chosen him, 
and who was I that I should sit in 
judgment upon him and criticise him? 
I never felt as though I dared do it. 
I never had the disposition to do it. 

The Lord took him, and He gave us 
another man to hold the same authori- 
ty, to occupy the same position, to ex- 
ercise the same powers; and I felt to- 
wards him as I did towards Brother 
Brigham. I knew him intimately al- 
so; had known him, I may say, all my 
life; but during his presidency over the 
Church we were thrown very closely 
together, because we both had to go in 
to exile. I might repeat the same in 
regard to Wilford Woodruff, who suc- 
ceeded President Taylor. I knew these 
men as intimately as one man could 
know another, and I can only say this: 
more angelic characters, men of sweet- 
er dispositions, I do not believe ever 
lived. They were men who were as 
perfect as human beings could be. They 
loved God supremely. They loved their 
Priesthood and the cause of God with 
all their hearts. They would have 
been willing, if necessary, to have laid 



down their lives at any time for the 
truth. 

This is my testimony concerning these 
men. We have probably heard all 
sorts of stories about them dur- 
ing their lifetime, particularly 
about President Young. In his 
lifetime he was maligned, and perhaps 
many of the Latter-day Saints believed 
the malicious and malignant stories 
that were told concerning him; but this 
is my testimony this day in the pres- 
ence of these assembled thousands, that 
a more perfect man than President 
Young I never knew. So I may say of 
his two successors. 

Now we have a man who has taken 
the same place, by selection and ap- 
pointment of the Almighty — President 
Lorenzo Snow. He is a man who has 
proved himself through long years of 
fidelity to the work of God. He stands 
here in our midst as the Prophet of 
God, the man holding the keys, the man 
who can bind on earth and it will be 
bound in heaven, the man who can loose 
on earth and it will be loosed in 
heaven, the man who has the power 
(which, however, he exercises very 
rarely, if at all) to forgive sins, to curse 
and they shall be cursed, to bless and 
they shall be blessed. I have said it is 
an awful power. It is; and it ought to 
be and is exercised with the greatest 
care and discrimination. God has chos- 
en this man; He has delivered him 
from perils and from death, and has 
brought him at his present age to be 
the President of His Church. Had He 
a purpose in this? Undoubtedly He had. 
God foreknew who should hold the 
keys after Wilford Woodruff passed 
away, and he selected this man— as per- 
fect a man, as far as we know, as far 
as fidelity to the truth and willingness 
to submit to- anything, even to death 
if necessary for the truth— to hold the 
same posiion and to exercise the same 
authority. Are we as bearers of the 
holy Priesthood and as members of the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints aware of this? Are we con- 
scious that God has chosen this man to 
be His mouth-piece unto us, and to 
stand in the stead of the Lord Jesus to 
His Church upon the earth? Do we 
take this into consideration? I am 
sorry to say that I do not believe many 



PRESIDENT GEORGE Q. CANNON

of the Elders do this. I judge this by 
their conduct, by their want of rever- 
ence and respect, by their lack of obed- 
ience, and by an absence of a disposi- 
tion to ask for and to be governed by 
the counsel of God. 

I leave you my brethren and sisters 
to judge whether I am too severe in my 
expressions upon this point. I tell you' 
that there never was in this Church, 
within my recollection, such an absence 
of respect and reverence for the au- 
thority of God as there is now among 
this people. I believe I am justified in 
saying this by the facts, and that the 
proof of this statement is within reach. 
Why is it? Many men seem to think 
that their way is better than any one's 
else; and though we believe and testify 
that God has a Prophet in our midst, 
, through whom we can get the word of 
the Lord, we despise that word, so 
much so at least that we will not ask 
for it, for fear we should be told some- 
thing that does not agree with our feel- 
ings and with that which we desire to 
accomplish. I tell you, as sure as God 
lives, there will have to be a change 
in this respect, or some men will go to 
hell. God will not put up with it. 

We have come here today to hear the 
word of God, and I am going to tell you 
what I think, if I do offend you. As 
a servant of God, I want to warn you 
of the danger you are in and of the con- 
sequences of the spirit that is being 
yielded to. I would no more dare to do 
anything of an important character 
without consulting the man of God 
than I would think of putting my hand 
in the fire, especially to do something 
that I knew he felt differently about to 
what I did. As I have said, God has 
chosen him to stand where de does — not 
you or me; and He knows every secret 
thought of men's hearts. His all- 
piercing eye has penetrated the inner- 
most recesses of his heart, and 
he has seen all there is about 
him, inside and out. He knows him 
thoroughly, because he created him. He 
knew his past history, he knows his 
present history, He knows his fu- 
ture history. And knowing this, 
he has chosen him. What can 
we do better than to show respect to 
our God by listening to His servant, 
by treating him with reverence, asking 



his counsel and seeking for his guid- 
ance? I know we pray to God for him,, 
that he may be inspired from on high. 
Do you believe your prayers? Do you 
believe that God will and does inspire 
him? I hope you do; and I hope that 
having this feeling, you will be prompt- 
ed to different action. Men may talk 
as they please about one man power, 
and they may fight us and seek to des- 
troy us because we listen to the man 
of God, but the fact still remains that 
this whole people are dependent for 
guidance, when they are guided aright, 
upon the man who holds the keys. Our 
settlement in these valleys was due to 
the recognition of that authority; the 
building of these settlements through- 
out these valleys is due to that. And 
shall we say that in some things we 
are willing to be guided; we think it 
right to be guided in matters of doc- 
trine, etc.; but in other matters, just as 
important and necessary for the salva- 
tion and preservation of this people, 
we are not willing? Latter-day Saints, 
you cannot do it. You cannot get away 
from this authority and remain Latter- 
day Saints, for yon sever yourselves 
from the Church of God, because every- 
thing you have is based on the recogni- 
tion of this authority. 

I want to see us as a people open our 
eyes to behold our true position before 
God, and the relationship that we bear 
to the Priesthood of the Son of God. I 
have no doubt that you all can see 
the spirit growing in the many quarters 
to draw off and to say — -thev may not 
say it in these words, because Lorenzo 
Snow is an exceedingly modest man 
and does not assume anything, and 
therefore fault cannot justly be found 
with him; but it is tantamount to say- 
ing "we do not believe that you, Lo- 
renzo Snow, have any right to talk to 
us or to guide or counsel us in these 
matters. We think that we have a per- 
fect right to do as we please." 

Well, no one will ever question that. 
Brother Brigham Young spoke this 
morning about our free agency. Every 
man and woman enjoys this gift. But 
we have a right to exercise our free 
agency in doing right, in being obedi- 
ent, in listening to counsel and in doing 
that which God wants. I think that I 
am as much of a free agent when I

obey God as I would be in rebelling 
against Him and obeying Satan. 

I feel that this people should cultivate 
more reverence for the authority of the 
Priesthood— that authority which has 
proved so great a blessing to them. 
I would like to see them do it, and 
that is the burden of my remarks on 
this occasion. I do plead with you 
most earnestly to cultivate this feeling 
of reverence for the Priesthood of the 
Son of God. You cannot show rever- 
ence to the Priesthood without show- 
ing it to the men who bear it. Let us 
teach our children the same feeling, 
that they may have reverence and re- 
spect for the Priesthood, and be will- 
ing to obey, and not have a spirit of 
fault-finding, carping, and pointing out 
defects of character. Tou who have 
been in sacred places know one thing, 
that you cannot speak evil of the Lord's 
anointed and be justified, and if you 
break your covenants in that respect, 
you are of course incurring severe con- 
demnation. 

I pray God that during the remainder 
of this Conference we may be filled with 
His Holy Spirit, and that His power 
may be in our midst, resting upon all 
who speak unto us, and that we may 
go away enlightened and benefited by 
our services here during the three days 
we shall be together, which I humbly 
ask in the name of Jesus. Amen.

It gives me joy to have the privilege 
of meeting with you in conference and 
in listening to the brethren who have 
spoken unto lis. I trust that during the 
time that I may occupy I may enjoy 
your faith and good feelings, that the 
promptings of the Holy Spirit may at- 
tend the remarks that I may make. 

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints is seventy years of ase to- 
day. President Snow this morning in 
his remarks dwelt upon the 
fact that we had passed our 
infancy, our boyhood, our young 
manhood, and had had a taste at 
least of that age which in the olden 
times was fixed upon as the allotted age 
of man. In my reflections on his re- 



marks I was led to wonder whether It 
could be Dossible that in the reaching 
of that mature age there would any- 
thing occur which should cause weak- 
ness to appear in connection with the 
further development and accomplish- 
ment of the work assigned to men in 
this dispensation. Our experience hap 
developed that man sometimes work9 
with very great devotion for a period 
of his life in the accomplishment of 
some specific purpose, and he some- 
times reaches a condition of mind when 
he doubts the efficacy of his efforts to 
accomplish the purpose he has had in 
view. Others do not become impreg- 
nated with the Spirit that actuates him. 
They look in coldness upon the sugges- 
tions which he makes. They regard his 
efforts as visionary, and that the re- 
sults of his struggles cannot in any 
sense be what he himself would antici- 
pate; and after continued effort and 
perhaps failure sometimes, he stops and 
becomes seemingly discouraged and un- 
willing to proceed further. It is true, 
there have been some men whose 
hearts, in the midst of sunshine or 
storm, success or failure, have never 
cooled, and whose minds have never be- 
come disturbed under any circum- 
stance. It is after this type that I be- 
lieve the Elders of the Church of Jesua 
Christ should be made. That 
no matter what the conditions 
and circumstances are, no matter what 
the temptations may be, or what bar- 
riers may present themselves in the 
way of the accomplishment of a specific 
purpose, success must come. 

There is no such word as fail in con- 
nection with this work. Failure was not 
designed of the Father when he visited 
this earth in person, with His Son, and 
laid upon that child. Joseph Smith, the 
obligation _to teach the truth among 
the children of men. He gave him to 
understand that while discouragements 
might come in the way, while brethren 
might be false, while men and women 
might violate the ordinances of God's 
house and trample beneath their feet 
the requirements of heaven, there would 
be found a body of men in connection 
with this work and its development 
who never would sacrifice to Baal, but 
would stand in the midst of every 
storm and in every place where God 
Almighty required them to act, un-

flinchingly, and true if need be to the 
giving of life and all to the cause of 
truth as our Father had established it. 
And yet we are possessed, like the rest 
of the human race, of our weaknesses. 
We are tempted, we are tried, we imag- 
ine many vain things, but so far as 
concerns this work and its development 
and success in this world in the accom- 
plishment of the regeneration of the 
human race, it will not fail. "There is 
no such word as fail in the lexicon of 
our God." Men may fail; they may fail 
to read by the unerring counsels of the 
Holy Spirit the course that they should 
pursue; they may fail to be loyal sol- 
diers and to recognize the orders that 
high heaven shall give, looking to the 
development of our Father's cause in 
the world, but there will be found suffi- 
cient to meet the needs and responsi- 
bilities and to discharge the obligations 
that the Master has imposed upon those 
to whom the sacred message was deliv- 
ered by that angel who was to fly 
through the midst of heaven, having 
the everlasting Gospel to preach to them 
that dwell upon the earth, to every 
nation, kindred, tongue and people. 
Write it in your books, establish it 
in your hearts and fix it in every fibre 
of your being, that God will see its ac- 
complishment in the loyalty and devo- 
tion of those whom He shall gather, one 
at a time, and establish among His 
people in the Church of Christ. 

Our brothers and our sisters among 
the religious peoples of the world should 
become after a time, in my judgment, 
impregnated with this thought, and 
cease the expression of their illfeelings 
and the application of improper meth- 
ods, looking to the hurt of this work, 
for the promise is that "no weapon 
formed against this work shall succeed 
and they that arise in judgment against 
it shall be condemned." — not to. con- 
demnation that shall fall from my lips, 
or condemnation that may fall from the 
lips of any who are associated with the 
work in the same degree that I may be; 
but in that condemnation registered by 
the finger of God, which blights those 
who set their hand against this work 
and labor for its destruction. For as 
the sun shines at noonday and as the 
brightness of morning appears in the 
eastern horizon, this work must suc- 



ceed. It is the decree of Providence. 

While we thus speak in connection 
with the work, and while we feel our 
weaknesses and our littleness as aids 
in its accomplishment, we recognize 
the fact that the day of destruction and 
schooling has not gone by. Around us 
are armies of boys and girls develop- 
ing into young manhood and young wo- 
manhood, schooled under conditions 
somewhat different to those that have 
existed in former times, and yet not so 
different after all, only that we have al- 
lowed a great degree of laxity to grow 
up in connection with our government 
and association in our households that 
never should have existed. I have spok- 
en a number of times upon the question 
of a more cautious, careful and deter- 
mined purpose on the part of the head of 
every home, to see that he is in clos- 
er companionship with the members 
of his household than he has been wont 
to be in times past. I have received the 
Priesthood. It entails upon me a great 
obligation that takes my entire time in 
the missionary fields abroad, or in the 
discharge of duties in the ward or 
Stake. No matter about my own home 
circle, the wife and the children must 
look to their own interest there; but I 
must discharge this duty that leads me 
hence in the fulfillment or requirements 
that have been placed upon my shoul- 
ders, and to a degree that in my judg- 
ment is reprehensible. With this feel- 
ing in our hearts we have neglected 
one of the most sacred obligations in 
the world. I am wondering when that 
obligation shall be brought home to us 
which is laid down in the Scriptures, 
about the teaching of our children, how 
far you and I, holding the Priesthood 
of the Son of God, shall be found under 
the ban pronounced by the Savior of 
the world in the revelation of His holy 
will. The troubles and trials of this 
life are manifold, but there is no re- 
sponsibility placed upon us greater than 
the care of our own. The statement by 
one of old that he who does not pro- 
vide for his own is worse than an infidel 
and has already denied the faith, is one 
that will apply to a great many in our 
day and time. There must be a more 
systematic and thoughtful application 
of home government and home action 
upon the part of the Elders of the 



L6 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Church of Jesus Christ of L,ater-day 
Saints, or the ban pronounced in these 
words, which classes us with the infidel, 
will be manifest, and it will be written 
by the recording angel that our part 
has not been performed in the Spirit 
of that work which God has given us a 
share in establishing in the world. I 
do not believe that duty requires any 
one of you to be absent from your 
homes every night in the week, looking 
after somebody other than your own 
household. I do not believe that the ad- 
justment of the responsibilities placed 
upon us in this Priesthood that 
we hold reauires that the 
sons and daughters of the Elders of this 
Church shall not be in touch with their 
fathers in such spirit as shall render 
them susceptible to the influence of 
that Priesthood and the spirit of this 
work, which leads them to make the 
sacrifices, if they can be called sacri- 
fices, that has led them by hundreds 
and thousands into every part of the 
earth. It is an adjustment that is es- 
sential with these High Priests, these 
Seventies and these Elders in the 
Church, that the home and its interests 
shall be remembered, and that the men 
who sit down in their homes constantly 
and fail to perform their part in con- 
nection with the work outside of the 
home shall adjust their time upon legit- 
imate and proper lines, which shall so 
distribute the labors that my wives and 
my children and that my associates 
with their wives and children may en- 
joy that legitimate and proper com- 
panionship designed by our maker when 
he made us husbands and wives, par- 
ents and children. 

It has given me great concern to have 
many of my brethren tell me that they 
have not spent an evening at home in 
years. This duty, that duty and these 
appointments have taken them here 
and there, and their sons and daughters 
scarcely see them. If they do see them, 
it is simply in the morning, when break- 
fast is eaten, and then they depart to 
the various labors resting upon them. 
I hope that in the consideration of these 
questions affecting the home and the 
work of God, we will see to it in the 
future that each of these interests shall 
receive its proper care and attention, 
and that the wife shall rejoice in the 



companionship at the fireside of her 
husband, at least occasionally, and that 
the boys and girls shall feel themselves 
in duty bound to congregate there. 
Then in the love manifest in that home 
by the husband for the wife, and wife 
for the husband and the parents for the 
children, there shall be a witness of 
God's mercy in the establishment of that 
principle by which men and women are 
bound together for time and eternity. 
It seems to me there is no reason in the 
world why the acting Priesthood in a 
Stake or ward should be away from 
their families every night in the week; 
why these Elders, these Seventies, these 
High Priests and these Apostles should 
have so little of that companionship 
that was established when they plight- 
ed their faith to their companions. The 
devotion of husband and wife should 
not become cooled as age approaches, 
but we should be determined in our 
hearts to maintain under every condi- 
tion its warmth to the fullest, inas- 
much as we have covenanted with God, 
angels and witnesses that for time and 
eternity we. would fill in justice and 
propriety the duties and responsibilities 
of the sacred relationship of husband 
and wife. 

President Cannon, in his remarks 
this afternoon, bearing upon the spirit 
of insubordination and a failure to 
recognize counsels coming from the 
proper source in connection with the- 
work of God, has expressed very clear- 
ly and distinctly the feeling that is 
present with a great many people, the 
result of thoughtlessness upon the part 
of some, but largely attributable to the 
fact that that companionship which 
should exist in the home does not exist, 
and that our boys and girls get from 
under our control and we seem to lack 
the tact to draw them back under our 
influence. President Cannon gave to 
you his views in regard to the question 
of veneration. I am unlike him in a 
great degree, I lack in veneration. It 
has been necessary for me to cultivate 
it. While I respect my brethren and 
also the men and women whose hair 
has become *?ray, it is indeed an ex- 
treme effort for me to show that de- 
ference and respect which is due to 
the men with whom we mingle or who 
possess influence among the children

of men. But his suggestions in connec- 
tion with these matters are worthy of 
consideration. I have sought to im- 
press upon my own sons the necessity 
of being men among men, to seek to 
understand principle, to act up- 
on the basis of their consciences, 
and to fulfill the duties and 
responsibilities of life in the 
Priesthood which God has given to 
them, in such a way that the name they 
bear shall not be tainted. But we notice 
in connection with these matters that 
there is a spirit abroad that it is not 
right and proper to give ear to the 
counsels of wise and prudent men; that 
they are old fogies; that experience in 
the world counts for nothing, and that 
step by step we will brush their views 
out of the way. I presume it is an 
American idea that has developed itself 
in the world. Oh! how many will awak- 
en in time to the understanding that 
they have been deceiving themselves, 
that the experience of a gray-haired fa- 
ther and mother, and that the careful 
and considerate counsels of a High 
Priest in the Church of Christ would 
have been, if utilized, potent for their 
good. 

My brothers and sisters, I recognize 
the fact that Zion is going to grow. I 
would grow with it. I would have my 
children grow with it. My grandsires 
labored in connection with this work; 
my sires have labored in connection 
with it. They believed it was true. I 
believe they were right. I not only be- 
lieve, but I know that they were right; 
and if I can write this knowledge upon 
my wives and children and get them to 
understand the duty that they owe to 
God and their country in connection 
with the development of this work 
and its extension in all the world, I will 
indeed rejoice in every fibre of my be- 
ing. But should they lose respect for 
the truth which God has revealed or for 
the love of right presented in the prin- 
ciples of the government that has been 
established, under which this work has 
been developed, it shall seem to me 
that life has indeed been a failure. If, 
however, the husbands and the fathers, 
the wives and the mothers shall be in 
attune with each other; if they shall 
love the home and the home circle; if 



they shall impregnate their children 
with an understanding of the 
truth, and with the reverence due 
to our heavenly Father and 
His representatives here, as 
well as to the grey hairs of every hon- 
orable man and woman in the world, it 
will have been, indeed, an accomplish- 
ment that will lend strength and force 
to this work, and its spread will be 
manifest in every direction. 

May heaven's peace abound in your 
hearts and in your homes; may you 
love the truth, and lay the foundation 
of love so deeply and thoroughly in the 
circle that God has given you a stew- 
ardship over, that when manhood and 
womanhood shall be reached, and the 
children, and the children's children 
shall look homeward, there shall be joy 
abounding in their hearts, which noth- 
ing in the world can quench. If we will 
do the bidding of our Father; if we 
shall remember that as husbands and 
wives our obligations are eternal; if we 
shall remember as parents and children 
that our hope of the approval of our 
Father in heaven is linked together, 
and if we shall fulfill the duties that 
life requires at our hands, rendering to 
our family their share, all will be well. 
If we will see to it that some men are 
not required to take all the care and re- 
sponsibility, while others remain at 
home in idleness, all of us will be the 
better off, and the wives who have hus- 
bands lounging around the house will 
thank God for the privilege of their 
having something t'o do outside of their 
homes. We have received the truth. 
There is no mistake in regard to that. 
Mankind may just as well come to that 
conclusion first as last, and realize that 
every block placed by them in the way 
will but increase the impetus of the 
work. It is for us who have become its 
custodians to fulfill our mission and 
ministry. Our friends criticise us for 
the evils that are manifest among us. 
There are evils among the Latter-day 
Saints. There are boys unguarded, un- 
warned and untaught. There are girls 
left to the prey of the vicious and 
the impure. There are unwise 
mothers, who have never learned a 
single lesson from the experi- 
ence of their own lives, and 
men who seem to forget the tempta-

tions and trials that beset them in their 
youth, and turn loose to be destroyed 
the treasures that God has given them. 
Oh! that I could write upon the heart 
of every man and every woman the 
rememberance of their own lives, and 
the struggles that they have had to 
make to preserve themselves from the 
pitfalls of immorality; and write also 
upon their hearts and souls the sen- 
timent and feeling that our Father 
would inspire if they would open their 
hearts to him, that these pure spirits 
need the constant guidance, guardian- 
ship and care of their fathers and 
mothers. 

A^ain I say, may the Lord's peace 
abound with you. May the spirit of 
this conference resound to the ends of 
the earth with the declaration that 
Mormonism, as the world calls it, is a 
factor in the universe, come to stay, not 
to fade nor fail, but to increase and de- 
velop as long as there is a human being 
in sin; warning its own devotees that 
honesty, truthfulness, virtue and love 
and respect for everything that is 
noble and true is the foundation stone 
of the work.; calling upon everyone who 
has drifted into by and forbidden 
paths to repent and turn to the truth, 
and being to the world a light set upon 
a hill, that cannot be hid, which will in- 
crease in brightness and power until 
its light shall encompass the earth. 
God bless you. Amen.

The Saints (rust in the Lord— Caus^ of the opposi- 
tion of the world — Exhortation to faithfulness — 
A plea for liberty. 

I am very thankful to our Heavenly 
Father that I have the privilege of at- 
tending this conference and of rejoicing 
with my brethren that we are seventy 
years of age. I was very much im- 
pressed in listening to the instructions 
that have been given, how everything 
tends to establish the Scriptures. The 
37th Psalm says: 

"Fret not thyself because of evil-doers, 
neither be thou envious against the- 
workers of iniquity: 

"For they shall soon be cut down like 
the grass and wither as the green herb. 

"Trust in the Lord, and do good; so 
shalt thou dwell in the land, and verily 
thou shalt be fed. 

"Delight thyself also in the Lord; and 
he shall give thee the desires of thine 
heart. 



"Commit thy way unto the Lord; trust 
also in him, and he shall bring it to 
pass: 

"And he shall bring forth thy right- 
eousness as the light, and thy judg- 
ment as the noonday." 

From the testimonies that we have 
heard this seems to be the history of the 
Latter-day Saints. They are the most 
valiant and courageous people on the 
face of the earth, because they "Trust 
in the Lord and do good." It required 
a great deal of moral courage to ac- 
cept this Gospel, to come out of the 
world and take up the cross of Christ, 
and to advocate a doctrine that was 
everywhere spoken against. But it has 
established in us an everlasting char- 
acter. We know no fear. Our trust is 
in the Lord; and the exhortation to us, 
Learn the will of God and do it, brings 
forth and establishes within us a char- 
acter. We are always willing to do the 
will of God. We came into the Church 
for that express purpose. We found 
that it would be impossible for us to be 
delivered from death, hell and the 
grave, unless we accepted of the doc- 
trine of Christ as taught by the inspired 
servants of God; and being on the un- 
popular side we had to defend our- 
selves. We tested the principles of 
everlasting life, and we have discovered 
they are true. God has given unto us 
line upon line, precept upon precept, 
here a little and there a little, and we 
are growing in grace and in the knowl- 
edge of God. He has told us over and 
over again that if we will love him and 
keep his commandments we shall 
prosper in the land. The Scrip- 
trues are true. The Holy Spirit has 
come unto the sons and daughters of 
God in the day and age in which we 
live. We all realize that we have our 
individual mission; that when we seek 
unto the Lord and ask His guidance, 
He guides and directs us. He gives us 
the opportunity of being everything 
that we could wish to be, in fulfilling 
the mission He has appointed us, to 
His honor and glory. There is no need 
of our ever being deceived or being be- 
guiled by the influence of the adver- 
sary — who of course is adverse to God's 
will being done— if we will only ob- 
serve the will of the Lord and do it. 
We have a Father in heaven who loves 
us, and who has given unto us the

privilege of dwelling upon the earth 
in the dispensation of the fulness of 
times. We encourage the rising genera- 
tion to trust in the Lord and indi- 
vidually seek His counsel. The Lord 
does not require a blind obedience, but 
an intelligent obedience, and the Savior 
has exhorted us to ask and it shall 
be given us, to seek and we shall find, 
to knock and it shall be opened unto us. 
On one occasion he gave us the parable 
of the unjust judge, and told us to pray- 
without ceasing, to put our trust in 
the Lord, and He would give us every- 
thing necessary. 

The Church of Christ has a bad repu- 
tation. It always did have. "We de- 
sire to hear of thee what thou thinkest; 
for as concerning this sect, we know 
that everywhere it is spoken against," 
was said of old. It is a trick of the 
adversary that we should be evilly 
spoken of, and it is his disciples, who 
despise the commandment "thou shalt 
not bear false witness against thy 
neighbor," who have given us our bad 
reputation. But that matters very lit- 
tle. We know we are of God, and that 
the world lieth in the arms of the 
wicked one. We know that the princi- 
ples # of everlasting life, which we have 
subscribed to, are true, and it is to our 
best interest individually to accomplish 
that which the Father has given 
us to do. If those who fight 
against us, who despise us and 
who will not fellowship us would 
search for themselves individually as 
we have done, they would see as we 
see and have the same comprehension 
of the principles of everlasting life, be- 
cause they would have the same spirit, 
even the gift of the Holy Ghost, with- 
out which no man knowth the things of 
God. I have no faith in the wisdom of 
man, nor in doctors of divinity. They 
have made a mistake from the begin- 
ning. The history of the world tells 
us that mankind always accepted false 
prophets and slew and rejected those 
who were sent of God with the glad 
tidings of great joy. In the days of 
Noah, but eight persons out of the 
whole world accepted the Gospel of the 
Son of God, and were saved, while the 
others, under the dominion of the prince 
and power of the air, rejected light and 
truth and made their bet? where we 
would not like to go. 



I say to you, my .brethren and sisters, 
seek the counsel of the Almighty in 
your individuality, and when the Lord 
reveals to you what your mission is. 
fulfill it to the glory of God, no matter 
who else is pleased or displeased. The 
whole duty of man is to serve God and 
keep His commandments, and woe un- 
to us if we do not do it. We have been 
slothful; we have been indifferent; we 
have robbed the Lord in tithes and 
offerings; we have been self-sufficient 
and have despised the counsels of the 
Almighty, and He has called upon us to 
repent, to reform, and to consecrate 
unto Him that which is His due, ac- 
cording to His commandment, which 
is, that of everything He shall give to 
us, we will consecrate to Him one- 
tenth, and our ears shall be open to 
the cry of the widow and the father- 
less, and we shall visit them in their 
distress. The Lord has also commanded 
us to get out of debt, so that we may 
owe no man anything and be indepen- 
dent and keep the law of God. Unless 
we do so He cannot establish His 
statutes upon the land. I want to bear 
my testimony to the truth of these prin^ 
ciples. I know they are true. I know 
that God lives; I know that Jesus is 
the Christ. I know that Joseph 
Smith was a true prophet 
sent of God. All mankind can obtain 
this testimony, if they will seek for it. 
There was a time when I did not know 
it. I sought the Lord for it, and he 
gave it to me, to my perfect satisfac- 
tion. My exhortation to the people all 
the time is, for goodness sake be kind 
to yourselves; hear the word of the 
Lord and do it; stand in the dignity of 
your manhood and resist the influence 
of the world. Woe unto us if we are 
overcome of the world; woe unto us 
if we are excommunicated from the 
Church. We have a long list of men 
who should pay tithing and do not. I 
am sorry for them. I wish they had 
sense enough to be kinder to them- 
selves, for they are laboring under a 
curse who rob God in tithes, and offer- 
ings. They have no right to partake 
of the Sacrament, being unworthy. 
Every time they do it they eat and 
drink damnation; for they tell the Lord 
that they are willing to take upon them 
the name of Christ and to keep His 
commandments, yet they do not do it.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Hypocrites! Hypocrites! A great deal 
better if they should wake up to an un- 
derstanding of the dangerous position 
they occupy. If the Bishops are kind 
and considerate to hear with teem, to 
plead with them and to dig all around 
them and they reject it, when they pass 
behind the veil their record is made, 
the day has gone, the night has come, 
and their souls are not saved. Then 
comes the agony; but we have made it 
ourselves. We work out our salvation, 
or we work out our damnation. It is 
our own act. I know these Principles 
are true; they are common sense. There 
is no blessing, no eternal life promised 
to those who despise God and His com- 
mandments, and who prefer darkness 
to liRht It is a condemnation to reject 
ight and truth; and when the Lord 
Jesus Christ shall come in flaming 
to take vengeance upon them who know 
not God and keep not His command- 
ments those who love darkness rather 
than light will be punished with ever- 
lasting banishment from the presence 
of God and the Lamb. 

I rejoice very much in the instructions 
that have been given today. I am m 
harmony with every revealed principle. 
I say that the Latter-day Saints are 
the noblest people upon the face of the 
earth; and instead of governments < 
striving to stay their progress, they 
should do everything to enable them 
to progress in light and truth, and to 
develop principles and conditions which 
they know nothing at all about, 
know what we are doing, and we under- 
stand the science of life. We under- 
stand where we came from, what we 
are here for and what is our future 
destiny, because we are taught of God. 
We are in harmony with eternal prin- 
PiDl-s Our Elders go forth preaching 
the Gospel of the Son of God. They 
take their lives in their hands, leaving 
their families behind, and proclaim this 
glad message of great joy and that God 
has again spoken. They call the peo- 
ple to repentance, and warn them of 
judgments to come. We are told that 
judgment Will commence at the house 
of God It will fall upon this very class 
of people who despise God, and reject 
His commandments. We take our little 



children to our Sabbath schools, our 
primaries, our Mutual Improvement 
associations and quorums of Priest- 
hood for the express purpose of train- 
ing them that they may grow up with- 
out sin unto salvation. The Lord wants 
to establish His righteousness. That is 
what He has hired us for, and we 
should love truth and righteousness, 
and have our ears open to hear, our 
eyes to see and our hearts to under- 
stand, that we may be for God and His 
righteousness. 

Did you ever know this people so 
unpatriotic as to be petitioning the gov- 
ernment against any handfull of peo- 
ple ' No patriot was ever guilty of 
anything of the kind. A patriot is a 
man who sustains the Constitution of 
the United States and believes in re- 
ligious liberty. There are hypocrites 
among professed patriots, as well as 
other classes of people. I say God 
bless the patriots. God bless our gov- 
ernment, and give them wisdom, 
strength of character and moral cour- 
age to stand by the principles of the 
Constitution, and not be cowards. I 
would plead for this with all my heart. 
For of all people in the world, we are 
interested in having a righteous gov- 
ernment. We know how to appreciate 
libertv and freedom, and we never in- 
terfere with other people's doctrines or 
belief. We have enough to do to teach 
our own. We have the truth, the way 
and the Ufe and we have no time to 
find fault with others. It takes us all 
our time to publish the glad tidings of 
great joy. 

I pray God my eternal Father that 
He will establish the kingdom of God 
upon the earth in power; that the 
kingdom of heaven may come; that His 
will may be done on earth as it is done 
in heaven, and that we who have taken 
upon ourselves the name of Jesus 
Christ may be true and faithful to our 
covenants, and that we may have the 
grace of God to overcome and endure 
unto the end, in His glorious kingdom, 
through Jesus Christ. Amen.

SECOND DAY. 



April 7th, 10 a. m. — The choir and con- 
gregation sang the hymn beginning: 

Come let us anew our journey pursue, 
Roll round with the year, 
And never stand still till the Master ap- 
pear. 

Prayer by Elder Angus M. Cannon. 
Singing by the choir: 

Hark! listen to the gentle strain, 
O'er hill and valley, grove and plain! 
It echoes from the heights above 
The voice of freedom, peace and love. 

ELDER HEBER J. GRANT. 

Individual Progress in the work of God depends 
upon obedience t.> God's Commandments- To 
become great it is not necessary to behold 
Angels and have great spiritual manifestations 
— E^rnal life the tgreatest tjift of God to man 
— The Church organ should be sustained. 

I rejoice exceedingly in the opportun- 
ity of again meeting with the Latter- 
day Saints in general conference. I 
have enjoyed listening to the remarks 
which have thus far been made, and I 
desire, as was said here yesterday by 
President Snow, as all Elders with the 
proper spirit should desire, that I may 
be blessed of the Lord and that I may 
have the faith and prayers of the Lat- 
ter-day Saints, that what I may say. 
shall be beneficial to us and encourage 
us in performing the duties that de- 
volve upon us as Latter-day Saints. 

It has ever been a source of surprise 
to me that there are so many members 
of the Church, more particularly those 
who hold the holy Priesthood, who pro- 
fess to be Latter-day Saints, who testi- 
fy to a knowledge of the Gospel and 
to the divinity of the work in which 
we are engaged, and that Joseph 
Smith was a Prophet of God, and yet 
who fail to keep the commandments of 
our heavenly Father, and to prove by 
their lives that they are in very deed 
Latter-day Saints. I am surprised at 
this, because I cannot understand how 
people with a knowledge of the Gosoel 
and the testimony that Jesus is the 
Christ, that Joseph Smith was a 
Prophet of the true and living God, and 
that he has established on the earth, 
under the direction of our heavenly 
Father and his Son Jesus, the Gospel 



of everlasting life, and that it is in very 
deed the pearl of great price to each 
and every one of us — it is a surprise to 
me, I say, that men, holding the holy 
Priesthood and possessing this knowl- 
edge, should, year after year, neglect 
the duties and the obligations that rest 
upon them. The Savior told His fol- 
lowers that they were the salt of the 
earth, but that if the salt lost its savor, 
it was thenceforth good for nothing, but 
to be cast out and trodden under the 
feet of men. He told them also that they 
were the light of the world, a city 
set upon a hill which could 
not be hid; he told them that men did 
not light a candle and put it under a 
bushel, but upon a candlestick, that it 
might give light to all that were in the 
room, and he admonished them to let 
their light so shine that men seeing 
their good deeds might glorify God. 

This admonition applies to us. We are 
the light of the world. We have re- 
ceived the inspiration of Almighty God. 
We have received a testimony of the 
Gospel, and we do know that God lives, 
that Jesus is the Christ, that Joseph 
Smith was a Prophet of God, and that 
Brigham Young, John Taylor, and Wil- 
ford Woodruff were prophets of God, 
as is Lorenzo Snow. Every true Latter- 
day Saint has this testimony burning 
within his or her heart. Now, are we 
so living that the good deeds we per- 
form bring credit to the work of God? 
Are our examples worthy of the imita- 
tion of all men? Do we by our exam- 
ples show that we have faith in the 
Gospel? We are told that faith with- 
out works is dead; that as the body 
without the spirit is dead, so also is 
faith without works dead, and I am 
sorry to say that there are many pro- 
fessed Latter-day Saints who are spirit- 
ually dead. We many times ask our- 
selves the question, why does this man 
progress in the plan of life and salva- 
tion, while his neighbor, of equal in- 
telligence and ability, of apparently 
the same testimony and power, and 
perchance greater power, stands still? I 
will tell you why. One keeps the com- 



GENERAL C ONEERENCE. 



mandments of our Heavenly Father, 
and the other fails to keep them. The 
Savior says that he that keeps his com- 
mandments is the man that loves him, 
and he that keeps the commandments 
of God shall be loved of the Father, and 
the Savior says he will love him and he 
will manifest himself unto him. The 
Lord also tells us that those who hear 
His sayings and doeth them shall be 
likened unto the wise man who built 
his house upon the rock, and when the 
rains descended and the floods came 
and the winds blew and beat upon that 
house, it fell not, because it was found- 
ed UDon a rock. On the 
other hand, those who heard His say- 
ings and did them not, the Savior lik- 
ened unto a foolish man, who built his 
house on the sand, and when the rains 
descended and the floods came and the 
winds blew and beat upon that house, 
it fell, and great was the fall thereof. 
There are many Latter-day Saints who 
are building their houses upon the sand. 
They are failing to do the sayings of 
our Savior. They are failing to carry 
out the commandments of our Heav- 
enly Father that come to us from time 
to time through His inspired servants. 

Now, if we have the Gospel (and we 
know we have), I say to each and every 
Latter-day Saint, who desires to grow 
and enlarge in the Gospel, he must 
keep the commandments of God. As 
we keep the commandments of God and 
live god-like lives, we become full of 
charity, long-suffering and love for our 
fellows, and we grow and increase in 
all those things that go to make us no- 
ble and god -like. We also gain the 
love and confidence of those by whom 
we are surounded. It is by the per- 
formance of the plain, simple, every- 
day duties that devolve upon us that 
we will grow in the spirit of God. You 
find me a man that attends his quorum 
meetings, that performs his duties in 
the ward in which he lives, that hon~ 
estly pays his tithing, and I will find 
you a man full of the spirit of God and 
growing and increasing in the testimo- 
ny of the Gospel. On the other hand, 
you find me a man that has seen angels, 
that has had wonderful manifestations, 
that has seen devils cast out, that has 
gone to the ends of the earth and 
preached the Gospel, and yet who is 



failing to keep the commandments of 
God, and I will find you a man that is 
cirticising the Lord's anointed, and 
finding fault with what the President 
does, with where he goes, what he en- 
gages in and how he administers the 
affairs of the Church. There are many 
non-tithe-payers among the Latter-day 
Saints, and many of them say that 
the reason they don't pay tithing 
is because the tithing is 
not properly administered. See- 
ing, however, that they do not pay a 
dollar, it is none of their business how 
it is administered. But you will find 
that those who do not do their duty, are 
always complaining about somebody 
that does, and making excuses for 
themselves. I have never found a man 
who was keeping the commandments 
of God that had any criticism to offer 
concerning any administration of the 
affairs of the Church. Neglect of duty, 
failure to keep the commandments of 
God, darkens the mind of man and the 
Spirit of the Lord is withdrawn. We 
find it recorded in the Doctrine and 
Covenants "For although a man may 
have many revelations, and have power 
to do many mighty works, yet if he 
boasts in his own strength and sets at 
nought the counsels of God, and fol- 
lows after the dictates of his own will 
and carnal desires, he must fall." As 
recorded in the first section of the Doc- 
trine and Covenants, where men repent 
and turn from their misdeeds, the Lord 
will forgive them, but His Spirit will 
not always strive with them. 

I have met many young men who 
have said to me, "I do not know that 
the Gospel is true. I believe it. but I 
do not know it." I have invariably re- 
plied to them that our Lord and Master 
has said that he who will do the will 
of the Father shall know of the doc- 
trine, whether it be of God, or whether 
he spoke of himself, and if they would 
do the will of the Father, they should 
eventually have a knowledge of the 
Gospel. Some of them have said: "Oh, 
if I could only see an angel; if I could 
only hear speaking in tongues; if I 
could only see some great manifesta- 
tion, then I would believe." I wish to 
say to all within the sound of my 
voice that the seeing of angels and 
great manifestations do not make sjrea: 



ELDER HEBER J. GRANT.

men in the Church and kingdom of 
God. Think of the three witnesses to 
the Book of Mormon. What is their 
testimony? It is that an angel showed 
them the plates, and that they knew 
they had been translated by the 
gift and power of God. How 
did they claim to know this? 
Because "His voice hath de- 
clared it unto us." What else 
did they testify? "And we declare with 
words of soberness, that an angel of 
God came down from heaven, and he 
brought and laid before our eyes, that 
we beheld and saw the plates, and the 
engravings thereon; and we know that 
it is by the grace of God, the Father, 
and our Lord Jesus Christ, that we be- 
held and bear record that these things 
are true; and it is marvelous in our 
eyes, nevertheless the voice of the Lord 
commanded us that we should bear 
record of it; wherefore to be obedient 
unto the commandments of God, we 
bear testimony of these things." Yet 
these men fell by the wayside, though 
they remained true and steadfast to 
their testimony to the Book of Mormon. 

What is the testimony of Sidney 
Rigdon in connection with the Prophet 
Joseph Smith, as recorded in the 76th 
section of the Doctrine and Covenants. 

"And while we meditated upon these 
things the Lord touched the eyes of our 
understanding and they were opened, 
and the glory of the Lord shone round 
about; 

"And we beheld the glory of the Son, 
on the rierht hand of the Father, and re- 
ceived of his fullness; 

"And saw the holy angels, and they 
who are sanctified before His throne, 
worshiping God, and the Lamb, who 
worship Him for ever and ever. 

"And now, after the many testimonies 
which have been given of Him, this is 
the testimony last of all, which we give 
of Him, that he lives; 

"For we saw Him, even on the right 
hand of God, and we heard the voice 
bearing record that he is the only Be- 
gotten of the Father — 

"That by Him and through Him, and 
of Him the worlds are and were created 
and the inhabitants thereof are begot- 
ten sons and daughters unto God." 

Think of it, beholding the glory of the 
Son and receiving a fullness of that 



glory, and hearing the voice declare 
that he is the only Begotten of the 
Father, and yet this man, Sidney Rig- 
don, proved a traitor to the Prophet and 
fell by the wayside! 

There is no character of which we 
have any record in the Book of Mormon 
that I admire more than Nephi. The 
life of that man has been one of the 
guiding stars of my life. His faith, his 
determination, his spirit to do the will 
of God has inspired me with a desire to 
follow in his noble footsteps. 
We speak of seeing angels. What 
is the record of seeing angels? 
Those of us who are familiar 
with the Book of Mormon know that 
when God commanded Lehi to send to 
Jerusalem and get the plates from La- 
ban, some of his sons complained, but 
when Nephi came from the mountain 
to his father's tent, he said that he 
would go, because he knew "that the 
Lord giveth no commandments unto the 
children of men, save He should pre- 
pare a way for them that they may 
accomplish the thing which he com- 
mandeth them." They went up; they 
failed, and the brothers wanted to go 
back to their father in the wilderness. 
But Nephi said "We will not go down 
unto our father in the wilderness until 
we have accomplished the thing which 
the Lord hath commanded us." They 
went up again and they gave their 
wealth to Laban. but they were driven 
back again. Then the older brethren 
smote Nephi and his bi'other Sam with 
a rod, and while they were doing this, 
an angel of the Lord stood before them 
and chided them. But no sooner had 
he departed, after having told them 
to go up again and God would deliver 
Laban into their hands, than they com- 
menced once more to murmur. So it 
has been in all ages of the world, and 
so it will be with those who do not keep 
the commandments of God. Angels 
may visit them, they may see visions, 
they may have dreams, they may even 
see the Son of God, and yet the Spirit 
of God will not burn in their hearts. 
But those who do the will of God, and 
live God-like lives, they will grow and 
increase in the testimony of the Gospel 
and in power and ability to do God's 
will. 

After the angel had gone, these men

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



said, "How is it possible that the Lord 
Will deliver Laban into our hands? Be- 
hold, he is a mighty man, and he can 
command fifty, yea even he can slay 
fifty; then why not us?" What did Ne- 
phi, the younger brother say? He said 
"Let us go up again unto Jerusalem, 
and let us be faithful in keeping the 
commandments of the Lord; for be- 
hold he is mightier than all the earth, 
then why not mightier than Laban and 
his fifty, yea, or even than his tens of 
thousands?" 

Here is the key-note, Latter-daySaints. 
Let us realize that God is mightier 
than all the earth. Let us realize that 
if we are faithful in keeping the com- 
mandments of God His promises will 
be fulfilled to the very letter. For He 
has said that not one jot or tittle shall 
fall to the ground unfulfilled. The 
trouble is, the adversary of men's souls 
blinds their minds. He throws dust, 
so to speak, in their eyes, and they are 
blinded with the things of this world. 
Men do not lay up treasures in heaven, 
where moth and rust corrupt not,where 
thieves do not break through and steal, 
but they set their hearts upon the 
things of this world, and the adversary 
obtains power over them. 

I say to you, Latter-day Saints, that 
the pearl of great price is life eternal. 
God has told us that the greatest of all 
the gifts He can bestow upon man is 
life eternal. We are laboring for that 
great gift, and it will be ours if we keep 
the commandments of God. But it will 
not profit us to merely make profes- 
sions and to proclaim to the ends of 
the earth that this is the Gospel, but it 
will profit us if we do the will of God. 
As the inspired servant of God said, 
speaking of faith without works: 

"What doth it profit my brethren, 
though a man say he hath faith, and 
have not works? Can faith save him? 

"If a brother or sister be naked, and 
destitute of daily food, 

"And one of you say unto them, De- 
part in peace, be ye warmed and filled; 
notwithstanding ye give them not those 
things which are needful to the body; 
what doth it profit?" 

I say, what doth it profit to go to 
the end's of the earth and proclaim the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ, and yet fail to 
do vour duty here in laboring for the 



advancement of God's kingdom? I say 
to the Latter-day Saints, be honest 
with God, pay your tithes and your of- 
ferings, support every institution of 
Zion, build up the Church of Christ, 
pray for the authorities of the Church, 
and then sustain them in every labor 
and in all that they undertake to do. 

I see that my time has expired, but 
I want to just make one suggestion. I 
rejoice in the financial growth 
of the Church organ; I re- 
joice in the increase of seven thousand 
subscribers to our paper, which belongs 
to the Latter-day Saints. I say, con- 
tinue the good work. Subscribe for 
the Deseret News. Have it in your 
homes. Read the sermons that are 
published there; read the teachings of 
our Heavenly Father that come to us 
through His servants, that are pub- 
lished in that, paper. Do not allow 
your selfishness and your penuriousness 
to cause you, in order to save two dol- 
lars, to not have the inspiration of the 
Lord through His servants, as pub- 
lished in that paper. Sustain this pa- 
per. Why? Because it is yours. Be- 
cause the Prophet of God desires its 
success; because it is fighting for Zion, 
and because it desires the triumph of 
Zion. Sustain every other good insti- 
tution and God will bless you, which 
may He do, is my prayer, and I ask it 
in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 



ELDER JOHN W. TAYLOR. 

The gifts of God of great worth- Salvation conies 
through obedience— How a testimony of the 
truth can be obtained. 

My brethren and sisters, I pray that 
the spirit of our Father who is in 
heaven may rest upon me while I ad- 
dress you this morning. I have listened 
with much interest to the remarks that 
have bee"h made by the various speak- 
ers during this conference, and I feel 
that I can heartily bear testimony to 
all that has been said. No doubt the 
remarks of Elder Grant will be appre- 
ciated by the Latter-day Saints, and 
they have had the effect to draw my 
mind to another phase of the Church 
and Kingdom of God. 

I observe among the Latter-day 
Saints a very great improvement during 
the last twelve months in the payment 
of their tithing, in their attendance at 



ELDER JOHN Jf. TAYLOR. 



25 



meeting's, and in the performance of 
other duties. I have been a little in 
the world, and I find a great many 
good people among them. I notice that 
people pay their donations according 
to the covenants that they have made 
in their denomination, and they build 
vast churches, costing millions of dol- 
lars. I find organizations and charita- 
ble institutions that support thousands 
of people, and I find communities where 
they pour out their wealth in millions 
for the benefit of unfortunate and suf- 
fering humanity. I find thousands and 
millions of people who are thoroughly 
devoted to the faith they have espoused. 
I speak of this in order that I may 
draw to the attention of the young 
and rising generation a feature con- 
nected with this work that is spiritual. 
I want the young and all who are be- 
fore me to understand that the remarks 
of Elder Grant have not been intended 
to detract from the spiritual rights and 
privileges which the Latter-day Saints 
should enjoy. I am going to take the 
liberty to read to you a little from the 
holy Scriptures. I will read you the tes- 
timony of Moroni the Prophet. But be- 
fore doing so, I want to tell you this: 
There is only one difference - between 
the Latter-day Saints and the denom- 
inations of the world, as far as I have 
been able to observe, and that differ- 
ence lies in the fact that this people 
believe in continual revelation from God 
the Eternal Father, in the gifts and 
blessings of the Holy Spirit, and in 
various other blessings which 
the Lord has promised ' to the 
faithful in this generation. And let me 
tell you, whenever the absence of these 
gifts and blessings and the administra- 
tion of holy angels occurs among this 
people this is not the people of God. I 
speak this in order that the young may 
understand it. The children of men 
had not heard or seen God the Eternal 
Father or his Son Jesus Christ for 
eighteen hundred years, and this con- 
gregation before me today would never 
have come here had not God the Eter- 
nal Father and the holy angels visited 
the Prophet Joseph Smith. I want to 
bear testimony to one thing: Where 
one man who has had the privilege of 
the gift of the administration of angels, 



where one man who has enjoyed the 
gift of prophecy, or the gift of healing, 
or the gift of miracles, or any of these 
divine gifts, which God promised the 
believer in the last days — where one 
such man has left this Church, there 
have been fifty leave it who have not 
had these gifts. That is my testimony 
unto you, my brethren and sisters. 
When one of the sons or daughters of 
God is born of the water and spirit, 
he or she is chosen of God the Eternal 
Father, and while Satan, as Elder Grant 
has said, will make a ten-fold exertion 
to overcome such, nevertheless God has 
given them a testimony and it is burn- 
ing in their hearts; and you will find, 
if you reckon as between those who 
have received a gift of God and those 
who have not, that there will be fifty 
of the latter class to one of the former 
who will wander away from that 
straight and narrow path which Jesus 
Christ commanded the children of men 
to walk in. There are different phases 
to every question, and I feel strongly 
impressed to read the testimony of the 
Prophet Moroni: 

'•Behold I would exhort you that when 
ye shall read these things, if it be wis- 
dom in God that ye should read them, 
that ye would remember how merciful 
the Lord hath been unto the children 
of men, from the creation of Adam, 
even down until the time that ye shall 
receive these things, and ponder it in 
your hearts. 

"And when ye shall receive these 
things, T would exhort you that you 
would ask God, the Eternal Father, in 
the name of Christ, if these things are 
not true; and if ye shall ask with a 
sincere heart, with real intent, having 
faith in Christ, He will manifest the 
truth of it unto you, by the power of 
the Holy Ghost; 

"And by the power of the Holy Ghost 
ye may know the truth of all things. 

"And whatsoever thing is good, is 
just and true, wherefore, nothing that 
is good denieth the Christ, but ac- 
knowledged that He is. 

"And ye may know that He is, by the 
power of the Holy Ghost; wherefore I 
would exhort you, that ye deny not 
the power of God; for He worketh by 
power, according to the faith of the 
children of men, the same today and 
tomorrow, and forever. 

"And again .1 exhort you, my breth- 
ren, that ye deny not the gifts of God, 
for they are many; and they come from 



26 



GEAERAL CONFERENCE 



the same God. And there are different 
ways that these gifts are administered; 
but it is the same God that worketh 
all in all; and they are given by the 
manifestations of the Spirit of God unto 
men, to profit them. 

"For behold, to one is given by the 
Spirit of God, that he may teach the 
word of wisdom." 

What a great and glorious gift the 
gift of wisdom is. How nicely these 
subjects have been arranged, the Lord 
placing the gift of wisdom above all 
the other gifts. 

"And to another, that he may teach 
the word of knowledge by the same 
spirit." 

That knowledge which has been re- 
ferred to by Elder Grant, that we may 
know that God lives, not by the testi- 
mony of men, but by the power of the 
Holy Ghost, revealed unto us from God 
the Eternal Father, as referred to also 
by President Snow yesterday. 

"And to another, exceeding great 
faith; and to another, the gift of heal- 
ing by the same Spirit. 

"And again, to another, that he may 
work mighty miracles; 

"And again, to another, that he may 
prophesy concerning all things; 

"And again, to another, the beholding 
of angels and ministering spirits; 

"And again, to another, all kinds of 
tongues; 

"And again, to another, the interpre- 
tation of languages and of divers kinds 
of tongues. 

"And all these gifts come by the 
Spirit of Christ; and they come unto 
every man severally, according as he 
will. 

"And I would exhort you, my be- 
loved brethren, that ye remember that 
every good gift cometh of Christ. 

"And I would exhort you, my beloved 
brethren, that ye remember that He 
is the same yesterday, today and for- 
ever, and that all these gifts of 
which I have spoken, which 
are spiritual, never will be 
done away, even as long 
as the world shall stand, only accord- 
ing to the unbelief of the children of 
men. 

"Wherefore, there must be faith; and 
if there must be faith, there must also 
be hope; and if there must be hope, 
there must also be charity; 

"And except ye have charity, ye can 
in no wise be saved in the kingdom of 
God; neither can ye be saved in the 
kingdom of God. if ye have not faith; 
neither can ye if ye have no hope; 

"And if ye have no hope, ye must 
needs be in despair; and despair com- 
eth because of iniquity. 



"And Christ truly said upon our fath- 
ers, if ye have faith, ye can do all 
things which is expedient unto me. 

"And now I speak unto all the ends 
of the earth, that if the day cometh 
that the power and gifts of God shall 
be done away among you, it shall be 
because of unbelief. 

"And wo be unto the children of men, 
if this be the case; for there shall be 
none that doeth good among you, no 
not one. For if there be one among 
you that doeth good, he shall work by 
the power and gifts of God. 

"And wo unto them who shall do these 
things away and die, for they die in 
their sins, and they cannot be saved 
in the Kingdom of God; and I speak it 
according to the words of Christ, and 
I lie not. 

"And I exhort you to remember these 
things; for the time speedily cometh 
that ye shall know that I lie not, for 
ye shall see me at the bar of God, and 
the Lord God will say unto you, Did I 
not declare mv words unto you, which 
were written by this man, like as one 
crying from the dead? yea, even as 
one speaking out of the dust?" 

I have taken the liberty of reading 
this testimony of Moroni the Prophet. 
Joseph Smith the Prophet bore the 
same testimony, as recorded in the 
book of Doctrine and Covenants. Paul 
the Apostle bore the same testimony 
to the Corinthians and Ephesians in his 
day. I want to say, however, that 
while these gifts and blessings are the 
right and privilege of the Latter-day 
Saints, we should not depend upon them 
for our salvation in the kingdom of 
God. The gift of prophecy will not 
save any man. It is not a saving prin- 
ciple; it is a gift. It is to comfort our 
hearts. It is to give us the testimony 
of the mind and will of God concerning 
things which are to come. As Elder 
Grant has said, I may prophesy from 
now till the coming of the Son of Man, 
and if I fail to keep the commandments, 
I will not be saved in the kingdom of 
God. Neither do I believe that it is 
possible for a man to be saved in the 
kingdom of God without being born 
of the water and of the spirit. But this 
people can no more live spiritu- 
ally without these gifts and 
blessings and inspirations from 
our Father than you can live 
a month without eating. You 
will die a spiritual death, and there will 
be nothing left of you in the kingdom of 
God but a dead form. As the Prophet 



ELDER JOHN. W. TAYLOR 



has said, the letter killeth, but the spirit 
giveth light. 

Now the time will come when we will 
not need any of these gifts, but we do 
need them today very badly. I tell you 
that among the Latter-day Saints there 
is a famine for the spiritual gifts of 
God. That is my testimony unto you. 
These gifts and blessings are enjoyed 
among this people, but we do not enjoy 
them to that fullness that we will when 
we come up to the standard of keep- 
ing the commandments that Elder 
Grant has referred to. We will have 
to do these things little by little. We 
will receive line upon line, precept upon 
precept, here a little and there a little, 
until we can enjoy the fullness of the 
measure of the stature of Christ. I tes- 
tify to you, in corroboration of what 
Elder Grant has said, that just in pro- 
portion to the performance of your du- 
ties in the Church and Kingdom of God, 
you will enjoy the gifts and blessings 
of the Holy Spirit, if you desire them. 
These gifts and blessings will not come 
unto the children of men as an ordinary 
every-day affair. Any man that re- 
ceives a gift from God will have to get 
it by earnestly seeking after the Fa- 
ther. As Paul the Apostle says, "He 
that cometh to God must believe that 
He is and that He is a rewarder of them 
that diligently seek him." Paul also, 
in speaking of these gifts, says 
that "when that which is per- 
fect is come, that which is in part shall 
be done away." Bless your soul, when 
Jesus Christ comes to reign in right- 
eousness on the earth, we will not have 
to speak in other languages. Why? 
Because the original language will be 
given unto this people, and we will all 
speak in one tongue. We will not have 
to say to others, "Know ye the Lord; 
for all will know Him from the 
least unto the greatest." The gifts of 
God and the knowledge of Jesus Christ 
will be upon every man, woman and 
child. We will not need this gift of 
knowledge, so that we can testify that 
Jesus is the Christ, for He will be with 
us. The brightness and joy of His 
presence will be in our midst. We will 
not need the gift of the administration 
of angels, because the holy angels will 
be in our presence, and will be minis- 
tering servants unto the righteous that 
live either on this or some other world, 



as today they visit this earth from the 
throne of God the Eternal Father. You 
will not, my brethren and sisters, in 
that day, need the gift of the interpre- 
tation of tongues, because everybody 
will understand the same language. It 
will not be necessary to have the gift 
of healing, because we will not need to 
be healed, for we will be sound and per- 
fect. Thus I might go on and enumer- 
ate each of the gifts. They will all be 
done away with when that which is 
perfect is come. For these blessings 
are only in part. They are given to us 
now, — what for? Jesus said to His 
disciples that when He was gone He 
would send them the Comforter, which 
is the Holy Ghost, to comfort their 
hearts. Brethren and sisters, in our 
weak and feeble condition, with the 
vicissitudes of life upon us, when we 
come together in our fast meetings, 
does it not comfort our hearts to see a 
man or a woman enjoying a gift of God 
and getting up and exercising it? It 
fills our souls with joy, it renews our 
spirits, and we go forth with greater 
courage, power and determination to 
carry out all these commandments that 
Brother Grant has referred to. 

Now, my brethren and sisters, speak- 
ing about the various gifts of God, 
Joseph Smith the Prophet said that the 
greatest gift of God is the gift of salva- 
tion. Yes, and the way to be saved is to 
keep the commandments of God. I ex- 
hort you, my brethren and sisters, to 
seek for the best gifts, but not to put 
your dependence upon them. You may 
raise a man from the dead by the pow- 
er of God, and that will not save the 
man you raise up and it will not save 
you. You may prophesy concerning all 
things till the winding up scene, and if 
you do not keep the commandments of 
God the words of Jesus will be reiterat- 
ed unto you "not every one that saith 
unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into 
the kingdom of heaven; but he that 
doeth the will of my Father which is in 
heaven." For the Savior declared: 

"Many will say to me in that day.Lord 
Lord, have we not prophesied in thy 
name? and in thy name cast out devils? 
and in thy name done many wonderful 
works? 

"And then will I confess unto them, I 
never knew you: Depart from me, ye 
that work iniquity." 

I make this quotation in order that 



28 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



you may see the force and application 
of Elder Grant's remarks, for I desire 
to bear testimony to them. At the 
same time, my brethren and sisters, I 
desire that every son and daughter of 
God who is under the sound of my voice, 
should understand that the difference 
between the Latter-day Saints and the 
rest of the children of men is that God 
the Eternal Father does not bestow up- 
on them the power of His Holy Spirit 
and a knowledge of Jesus Christ as He 
has upon this people. We are the only 
people living on the race of this earth, 
out of fourteen hundred millions of peo- 
ple, upon whom the gift of knowledge 
has been poured out, to know that God 
lives, that Jesus Christ is His Son, and 
that we have inspired men in our midst. 

In the conclusion of my remarks, I 
desire to say unto the young men and 
young women, and to the strangers that 
may be in our midst, that all men, as 
Brother Grant has said, may know that 
God lives, if they will keep His 
commandments. This is a great and 
glorious privilege. Peter the Apostle 
says: 

"Add to your faith virtue; and to vir- 
tue knowledge; 

"And to knowledge temperance; and 
to temperance patience; and to patience 
godliness; 

"And to godliness brotherly kindness; 
and to brotherly kindness charity; 

"For if those things be in you, and 
abound, they make you that ye be 
neither barren nor unfruitful in the 
knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ." 

I promise you that if you will keep 
the commandments of God, repent of 
your sins, go into the waters of baptism 
and make covenant with the Father 
that you will obey him, you shall be 
born of water and of the spirit, and 
that spirit of revelation, so beautifully 
referred to here by our Prophet, Seer 
and Revelator yesterday, will come 
upon you, and you will know that God 
lives, that you are the creation of his 
hands, and that you shall have eternal 
life, if you will continue to keep his 
commandments. 

I feel to bless you all in the name of 
Jesus Christ, with every blessing that is 
for your good, and I pray that our 
hearts may be inclined to keep his 
commandments, that we may be saved 
and exalted in his kingdom. My breth- 
ren and sisters, there is nothing that is 



temporal in the sight of God. It is all 
spiritual in his sight. May God bless 
you, may we acknowledge his hand in 
all things, that we may be crowned 
heirs of glory, immortality and eternal 
life. My testimony unto you is that 
Joseph Smith was an inspired Prophet 
of the living God. I testify unto you 
that we have a prophet in our midst 
today, who receives the revelations of 
Jesus Christ for this people. I testify 
unto you that God the Eternal Father 
never will have a people upon the earth, 
excepting he has a Prophet, Seer and 
Revelator to reveal his mind and will 
unto them. For the Savior has said, 
"Thou shalt not live by bread , alone, 
but by every word that proceedeth from 
the mouth of God." My testimony is 
that God lives, that he has prophets 
here upon the earth, that he has 
bestowed the gifts and bless- 
ings upon this people, and all 
men are called upon to keep 
His commandments, or they cannot be 
saved and exalted in His kingdom. I 
rejoice to be in your presence. I re- 
joice in every blessing that I enjoy. 
I feel to acknowledge the hand of the 
Lord in the prosperity of this people. 
He has turned aside the shafts of the 
enemy, and every weapon that is 
formed against Zion does not prosper. 
Zion is going to rise and shine, and it 
will become the glory of the whole 
earth. The Gentiles will come from 
the ends of the earth, and kings 
to the brightness of her rising, and they 
will say, as the Prophet Jeremiah de- 
clared: "Surely our fathers have in- 
herited lies, vanity, and things where- 
in there is no profit." May we live to 
be faithful and be in readiness for the 
coming: of Jesus Christ, which is near 
our doors. For behold, he will come in 
the clouds of heaven, with ten thousand 
of His Saints, and to those who are 
righteous will he arise as with healing 
in His wings; but "all the proud, yea, 
and all that do wickedly shall be stub- 
ble: and the day that cometh shall burn 
them up, saith the Lord of hosts, that 
it shall leave them neither root nor 
branch." My testimony is that when 
you take all the proud and all they that 
do wickedly from among the children of 
men, there will not be many left. God 
bless you. Amen.

ELDER M. W. MERRILL. 

The preservation of families in the faith— The 
Counsels of the Priesthood should be regarded 
—Secret Societies shouH b" avoided— Unprofit- 
able amusements should not be indulged in — 
Further improvement in Tithe-paying needed. 

I think, my brethren and sisters, that 
I realize in part the responsibility of 
standing before you to say a few words. 
I have nothing particularly on my mind 
at this time, but depend for what I may 
say upon the Lord and your faith and 
attentic^i. 

I can testify that this work is true. I 
know it is from the Lord. I can tes- 
tify that the hand of the Lord has been 
over His people from the organization 
of the Church, seventy years ago, and 
when I reflect upon my own condition, 
I feel very grateful in my heart that I 
have been made to see the truth of this 
work and I have been able thus far 
to retain a membership in the Church 
and fellowship with my brethren and 
sisters. I feel that this is a great 
blessing. Where people can retain 
their fellowship in the Church and not 
be cut off it certainly is a great bless- 
ing. 

I appreciate the opportunity of meet- 
ing with you and testifying that this is 
the work of the Lord;, and thousands 
of you people know it just as well as 
I do. But this knowledge of the truth 
will not save us, unless we abide in it. 
If we let the cares of the world en- 
velop our minds to such an extent that 
we lose interest in the work of the Lord, 
we are in a pitiful condition. But if 
we place first and foremost our obliga- 
tions to the Church then we have a 
good chance to remain in the Church 
and to retain our fellowship with each 
other. And when we have fellowship 
with each other, we have fellowship 
with the Spirit of the Lord, which will 
direct us in all our ways, and we will 
be preserved in the truth with our fami- 
lies. Some of our families perhaps are 
wayward. They do not do as we would 
like them to do. Is not this the case 
in many families? There are sons and 



daughters whose 
give satisfaction 
and mothers, 
do about it? 
best we can. 
that we have 
cause of their 



course does not 
to their fathers 
What shall we 
Do the very 
but see to it 
not been the 
lack of integrity 



in the work of the Lord. I believe 
throug-n our faithfulness and our en- 
treaties with the Lord we may be the 
means not only of saving ourselves, 
but those the Lord has entrusted to us 
as sons and daughters. The Lord is 
merciful and He will hear our prayers 
and grant our desires through our in- 
tegrity for him and his work. And per- 
adventure, through our faithfulness, our 
children who are wayward and who 
perhaps have strayed away, will come 
back to the fold bye and bye, because 
the Lord will hear us in their behalf. 

Perhaps there are many things among 
the Latter-day Saints that ought not 
to exist. The indifference to the coun- 
sels of God that was treated upon yes- 
terday by President Cannon is a matter 
that is known to the whole people. We 
know that such conditions should not 
exist among the Latter-day Saints. 
There should be no necessity whatever 
for these things to be referred to by 
any Elders of the Church, because as 
Latter-day Saints we should live far 
above them. We should honor the Lord 
and His Priesthood and His work. We 
should set this example to our families, 
to our neighbors and to all with whom 
we associate. The lack of reverence to 
the Priesthood we may look upon as a 
trifling matter, but it is not. It is not 
the man particularly, it is the authority 
that God has bestowed upon the man. 
I am safe in saying, I believe, that 
there is no man who holds the author- 
ity of the Priesthood who has sought 
this position himself. He has not can- 
vassed for the support of the people, 
but he has been placed in his 
position because the Lord want- 
ed him there. Therefore men and 
women who trifle with these things and 
ignore the counsel of God, are treading 
upon dangerous ground and they will 
be brought into shame and disgrace 
before the people in the due time of the 
Lord, unless they repent. We cannot 
afford to do these things. Our duty is 
to sustain each other, sustain this work, 
to be in harmony with it, in all of its 
details, and to be in harmony with 
God's chosen servants in all the 
affairs of life. God will be with the 
men and women who will pursue this 
course, His Spirit and power will be 
with them, to sustain them through 
trying times.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



I know as well as I see you that Satan 
is abroad and his ministers are in the 
land by the thousands. They are per- 
haps in this tabernacle. At any rate, 
they are in our midst, and they are 
prompting individuals unknown to 
them, in the morning, at mid-day and 
in the evening, and trying to divert 
their minds from the truth and from 
the work of the Lord. They are trying 
to stir up division and discord among 
the Saints, and they succeed in a meas- 
ure. We feel sometimes that it is do- 
ing no particular wrong if we associate 
ourselves with secret societies. But it 
is drawing us away from the work of 
the Lord and from the Priesthood. Peo- 
ple who join these organizations will 
argue that it is important for them; 
it is a sort of insurance for their fami- 
lies; and they are not bad things be- 
cause there is nothing bad done there. 
Of course I do not know anything 
about that personally. I speak simply 
upon principle, and from that stand- 
point I know they are not productive of 
good to any Latter-day Saint. These 
secret organizations are what broke up 
the Nephite nation, and there is one 
society after another being organized 
in the midst of the Latter-day Saints. 
And whose work is it? Do the lead- 
ers of the Church advise it? Do they 
countenance it? I do not know that 
they do. I know that I do not person- 
ally endorse any of these things, be- 
cause I do not think they are productive 
of good. On the contrary, they will 
result in those who hold the Priesthood 
losing the spirit of that Priesthood and 
going into darkness. The Lord has 
given us the most complete organiza- 
tion there is in the world. You cannot 
find anything like it anywhere. It is 
a safe-guard and an insurance to 
the people. Who among all' the Latter- 
day Saints is allowed to suffer. 
If the husband should be 
taken away, if any of the family should 
be taken away, are those remaining not 
provided for? Why, tens of thousands 
of dollars of your tithes and offerings 
go to provide for the needy. Hence in 
the Church of God there is no necessity 
for any of its members being associat- 
ed with secret societies. There are peo- 
ple, of course, who do not belong to the 
Church living in our midst; they may 



associate with any society they please. 
But for Elders of Israel, some of whom 
have traversed the earth in preaching 
the Gospel, to lay down their Priesthood 
and join secret societies, it is different. 
Are there any cases of this kind in the 
midst of the people? I hope not, but I 
fear that there are such cases. Hence 
I warn my brethren and sisters, es- 
pecially the young, that these organiza- 
tions are not for the Latter-day Saints. 
They belong to the world and^I warn 
you against them. I would warn you 
mothers to teach your sons to live the 
Gospel and its principles and to identify 
themselves with the organizations of 
the Church. We have organizations that 
take in all the people, from the child to 
those who are a hundred years old, 
and in them we have all that we can 
possibly attend to. Some of the breth- 
ren spoke yesterday about people being 
away so much from their families. 
Well, I do not know, but if all our or- 
ganizations were attended to properly, 
it would take the fathers away a great 
deal. However, as Solomon said, there 
is a time for all things. There is time 
to instruct our children and to asso- 
ciate with our families, if we would 
divide our labors properly, * and not 
waste any of our time in associating 
ourselves with organizations wherein 
there is no rjrofit. 

There are a great many amusements 
introduced among the Latter-day Saints 
wherein there is no profit. People get 
together and indulge in card playing. I 
do not know personally that there is 
any particular wrong in playing 
cards, but it is the example and 
the fascination about it which 
leads to gambling, and this has ruined 
many men and families. It leads to 
drink and to many other evils. Hence, 
when I see published in the paper what 
a nice time so-and-so had at high five, 
or some other game, I wonder if there 
was any profit in the game to those peo- 
ple who assembled. I believe in social 
gatherings, such as family gatherings, 
and gatherings of the Saints, where 
they meet together and talk good things 
and rejoice together in the truth. I be- 
lieve such gatherings are profitable; 
but when the table is set with intoxi- 
cants, I do not think they result in 
good. We should not encourage our 



ELDER MARRINER IV. MERRILL. 



31 



families to engage in these things, be- 
cause they lead to evil and away from 
the Lord and the influence of His Spirit. 
There are plenty of good and profitable 
things to engage in; and these things 
that are not profitable, let us not par- 
ticipate in them. When we are invited 
here and there to sociables and gather- 
ings, we ought to consider, is there go- 
ing to be any profit in this for me. Oh, 
yes; it's going to be a grand thing; we 
are going to have a nice program. Well, 
I have thought sometimes that we are 
getting so much program that every- 
thing will be run by program by and by, 
if the Presidency of the Church will 
only sanction it. I heard not long ago 
of Relief Society meetings having pro- 
grams. I asked them what they had a 
program for. "Oh, we have a program 
so as to make it interesting:." "You 
leave the Lord out, then; you have ev- 
erything cut and dried, learned by 
heart, and you do not depend upon the 
Spirit of the Lord." I do not believe in 
too many programs. In some cases we 
might have programs, which would be 
very nice and profitable. But to carry 
this to the extreme, like we have our 
politics, I think will work an injury. I 
heard of a ward once where they were 
going to introduce programs into their 
ward meetings. I do not believe in that. 
I think we can have a ward meeting 
without a program, and we will depend 
upon the Spirit of the Lord to direct 
what shall be said and done. 

My brethren and sisters, there are 
many things that we can improve in. 
We can improve in our tithes and our 
offerings. Who is there in all Israel 
that cannot improve a little in this di- 
rection? Peradventm-e there may be a 
few that observe the law of the Lord 
strictly; but I tell you the large major- 
ity of the Latter-day Saints do not, al- 
though there has been great improve- 
ment made among the people. Further 
improvement is in order, and it will be 
well for us to do a little better this year 
than we did last year. If we cannot do 
any more ourselves, we might convert 
others to pay their tithing, if we will 
take pains to reason with them, that 
they might not be burned in the day of 
the Lord Almighty. It is said that they 
that are tithed shall not be burned, in- 
ferring that they that are not 
tithed may be burned. This is 



a law of the Lord. It was not insti- 
tuted by man. President Snow did not 
inaugurate this principle. The Lord 
revealed it to the Prophet Joseph and 
it is expected that all Latter-day Saints 
will observe this law of the Lord. I 
want to bear testimony that you who 
observe this law strictly will be blessed 
of the Lord. He will multiply you and 
your means shall be increased unto you, 
because you have obeyed the law of the 
Lord and you are entitled to have the 
windows of heaven opened unto you and 
blessings poured out upon you. But do 
not become faint-hearted or discour- 
aged because you do not receive every- 
thing today that you expect; but trust 
in the Lord, and so sure as you continue 
to trust in the Lord the way will be 
opened up from time to time and means 
will be multiplied upon you. Above all 
things, my brethren and sisters, let us 
resolve in our hearts that from this 
time forward we will observe the law of 
the Lord, we will be consistent in our 
lives as Latter-day Saints, and we will 
try to educate ourselves to love one 
another, to love the work of God, to love 
His Priesthood, to reverence and obey 
them, and to walk in the light that God 
may sustain us and give us the victory, 
which He will do, if we will only do 
these things. 

How many of you Latter-day Saints 
neglect your prayers? How many fail 
to call your families together in the 
morning and in the evening, or have 
you so much to do that you cannot at- 
tend to it? Do you have to go to some 
secret organization, and you have not 
time for family prayers? I want to 
advise you personally to drop all these 
organizations wherein there is no 
profit; associate yourselves with things 
wherein there is profit, wherein you 
may have more influence with your 
households, in persuading them to obey 
the laws of the Lord. There are a great 
many things for Latter-day Saints to 
do, and we know what is best to be 
done if we will only sit down and think 
about it. Let us consider our condi- 
tion before the Lord and place our- 
selves in the position of the Prophet 
who said, "Search me, O God, and know 
my heart; try me, and know my 
thoughts; and see if there be any wick- 
ed way in me, and lead me in the way 
everlasting." Why cannot we adopt 



32 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



that sentiment? If we will do so, and 
observe these things, we will be glad of 
it by and by. When we get through 
with this short career of ours, and we 
look back upon our lives, if we have 
kept the commandments of God, what 
joy and satisfaction it will be to us. 
We shall go in peace and associate with 
the just behind the veil. 

Brethren and sisters, attend to the 
duties that pertain to your calling in 
the ministry, and let everything else 
take care of itself. God bless you, and 
lead us all in the paths of life, is my 
prayer, in the name of Jesus. Amen.

ELDER ANTHON H. LUND. 

Spiritual gifts must exist in the Church <>f Christ — 
Thcdr absence an indication of unbelief. 

I hope, while I shall address you, that 
the same good spirit may guide me as 
has assisted my brethren who have al- 
ready spoken in the different meetings 
of this conference. I have enjoyed their 
remarks very much, and I believe all 
w r ho have been present have felt to 
rejoice in the good teachings that have 
been given us. 

This morning, when Brother John W. 
Taylor read the testimony of the 
Prophet Moroni to us, I was much 
struck with some of the words he read. 
We were told there that the spiritual 
gifts should always be found in the 
Church, and that if there ever came a 
time when these gifts were not in the 
Church it would be on account of un- 
belief; and a woe was pronounced upon 
the inhabitants of the earth if such 
should be the case. I thought how clear 
the Prophet Moroni made this; that the 
Church whenever it is upon the earth 



must have the Holy Spirit within it; 
the members of the Chuch must have 
this Spirit, and the spiritual gifts must 
be manifested; otherwise it would be a 
dead church. These words are record- 
ed in the Book of Mormon — this won- 
derful book that has been brought forth 
by the power of God in our age. This 
book was printed before there 
was a church organized, and yet we find 
these remarkable words in it, which at 
once furnish the world with a test 
whereby they can judge if this is the 
Church of Christ or not. It says that 
in the Church there must be found these 
gifts. Now, if Joseph Smith had not 
been an inspired man; if the Book of 
Mormon was not the word of God, but 
written by man, how careful such a 
man would have been not to furnish 
the world with a test like this where- 
by they could at once detect whether 
it was the Church of Christ or not. 
A man who should fraudulently give 
himself out to be an inspired man, would 
be careful that such words should not 
be given to the world. But these were 
not the words of Joseph; they were the 
words of a prophet that lived some 
fourteen hundred years before, and 
one who understood the Church of 
Christ. 

When we look back upon the history 
of the Church we find that the spirit- 
ual gifts were very abundant in the 
original Church, and that whenever the 
Saints met they were much blessed 
with the power of the spirit. They 
were so eager to attend their meetings 
and to speak, prophesy, and talk in 
tongues, that the Apostle Paul had to 
regulate their meetings and give them 
counsel in regard to the manner of con- 
ducting them, that order might prevail. 
The Saints were abundantly blessed 
with these manifestations of the spirit. 
But when the apostasy took place, the 
spirit of the Lord departed, its mani- 
festations were fewer, and at last they 
were not known in the Church. Then 
it was very convenient to teach -the 
people that revelations were no longer 
needed, that prophets were not needed; 
that these spiritual gifts were given 
only in the beginning of the Church, to 
convert men; but that they were not 
to continue with the members of the 
Church, and therefore they were done

away. When Jesus appeared to 
the Nephites, upon this continent, He 
taught them the pure Gospel and or- 
ganized His church. He left this power 
of the Priesthood with His servants 
here, the same as He had with His ser- 
vants upon the Eastern continent, and 
the spiritual blessings were enjoyed as 
long as the Church was in existence 
upon this continent. Moroni understood 
this so well that he said these gifts 
must always be found in the Church, 
and if not it would be a sign of unbe- 
lief. 

After the Book of Mormon was pub- 
lished, the Church was organized, and 
then men could read the book and test 
the words, and judge whether or not the 
Church that was afterwards organized 
corresponded with what the Prophet 
had said the Church should be. 

It was but a few days after the 
Church was organized before the spirit 
uttered itself in power, and spiritual 
manifestations were given and miracles 
performed, showing that the Church 
which had been recently 
organized was not an imita- 
tion, but that it was the 
Church itself, containing the same pow- 
er and spiritual blessings. In fact, 
this wonderful book itself was trans- 
lated by the power of God. Joseph 
Smith was an unlearned man; he had 
not studied at colleges; he was not 
much of a writer at that time, but had 
to employ others to write for him, and 
those who wrote for him wrote as he 
dictated. Now, you who have tried to 
dictate to a person know how hard it is 
to dictate, and to continue to do this, 
without altering or without having the 
last sentence repeated; but Joseph dic- 
tated to these men, and was not under 
the necessity of asking them where they 
had left off. because he translated by 
the power of God. The Urim and 
Thummim was in his possession, and 
with this instrument he was able to 
translate the characters that were en- 
graven upon the plates. This was a mir- 
acle in itself, and these men who wrote 
for him would soon have been able to 
detect whether he was inspired in the 
translation, or whether it was his own 
brain that furnished them the material 
to write. And let me say that no man 
could write such a work, if he were 



ever so gifted. He would be detected in 
some fault or other. 

The book has been given unto us by 
the Lord, and we find in it prophesies 
concerning our time and prophecies 
concerning the time that is already 
past, which have been fulfilled, proving 
the book to be an inspired one. These 
gifts which the book mentions should be 
found in the Church; my testimony to 
you is that they are found in the 
Church. Talking in tongues has been 
very common in the Church. Nearly all 
the members have at some time or an- 
other heard this gift, as well as the in- 
terpretation of tongues. Some may say, 
But how can we judge whether this is 
a true tongue or not? You can judge, 
by the Holy Spirit whether it is prompt- 
ed by that Spirit or not. There have 
been times when the proof of the tongue 
spoken has been overwhelming. 
When President Peterson of the Sanpete 
Stake was a young man he attended 
a meeting in Illinois. There were many 
present, and the spirit of the Lord was 
poured out upon the Saints in a great 
measure. He felt urged by the spirit to 
talk in tongues, and when he sat 
down a young girl arose and interpreted 
it. She was but seventeen years of age, 
perhaps younger, and she interpreted 
what Brother Peterson had spoken. 
Some of the brethren there, then in 
good standing but who afterwards left 
the Church, were told that if they did 
not take heed they would apostatize, 
and that the balance of the branch 
should emigrate to the West and travel 
in wagons like houses, across large 
plains. This was the interpretation of 
the tongue. They did not then know 
that there would come a time when 
they should travel in covered wagons 
and go to the west. But a remarkable 
thing happened at that meeting. Two 
young girls that had been stolen while 
children, by the Indians, and been 
brought back by the government, were 
present. They heard Brother Peterson 
speak in tongues, and they declared 
that he snoke in an Indian tongue, 
which they had heard before, and they 
understood most of it, though they said 
he spoke it better than they ever heard 
the chiefs speak it, and the young girl, 
they said, had translated what they un- 
derstood correctly. This is a great tes-

timony of the truth of that gift, and 
many other instances could be men- 
tioned, showing that this gift is in the 
Church. The gift of prophecy we know 
is in the Church. How many of the 
prophecies of our beloved Prophet 
Joseph Smith have not been fulfilled to 
the very letter? You take the book 
of Doctrine and Covenants, and you 
will find there many prophecies that 
have been fulfilled already, and many 
relating to time yet to come, which we 
believe will be fulfilled just as literally 
as have those that have already been 
fulfilled. Let me read a few words of 
a revelation given March, 1831, some 
eleven months after the Church 
was organized. In talking about 
what should come to pass, the Lord re- 
vealed to Joseph: 

"But before the great day of the Lord 
shall come, Jacob shall flourish in the 
wilderness, and the Lamanites shall 
blossom as the rose. 

"Zion shall flourish upon the hills and 
rejoice upon the mountains, and shall 
be assembled together unto the place 
which I have appointed." 

This was many years before the Lat- 
ter-day Saints were driven from the 
States, and it talks in such plain terms 
concerning the gathering. The gather- 
ing is a unique principle in this Church, 
one that is not found in other churches. 
It is referred to in the Book of Mormon, 
and in the early revelations to the 
Church it is given to the people in great 
plainness. We are told in some of the 
revelations that the people should be 
gathered from all nations unto this 
land, which should be the land of Zion. 
When we now read about this, it may 
not seem so remarkable. But let us put 
ourselves back to the time when the 
Church numbered but a few members 
and was hardly known outside of a few 
counties, and remember that then the 
Lord told the Prophet that the work 
should be known in other lands and 
that the people should be gathered from 
all nations, and it becomes, indeed, mar- 
velous unto us. Gradually our mission- 
aries are reaching the different nations 
of the earth, and we have people 
here from every part of the 
earth, if not yet from every na- 
tion. Our missionaries are going in 
faith, proclaiming the truth. They are 
reaching one people after another. 



Nearly every nation in Europe has had 
the Gospel offered to them. I was read- 
ing a letter last night which Brother 
Hintze had received from Athens. 
Greece, a country where we have not 
yet done much missionary labor. Bro- 
ther Hintze went there and preached 
the Gospel and the seed sown is ger- 
minating, and they want to be informed 
concerning the truth. Certain princi- 
ples have struck them as true: others 
they do not understand yet. In the 
Donaw principalities we have a man la 
boring, who has already baptized sev- 
eral persons, and it will not be long 
before it can be said that all nations in 
Europe have been informed concern- 
ing the Gospel. And the myriads in 
Asia and Africa will yet have to hear 
the Gospel. The Lord is in His mar- 
velous way preparing the way for the 
Gospel to be taught to men. I rejoice 
in contemplating the dealings of the 
Lord with this work of His, and my 
testimony to you is that God has es- 
tablished this work, and that He will 
see that it shall triumph in the earth. 
God bless you all, amen. 

ELDER M. F. COWLEY. 

The Church built on the foundation of Continuous 
Revelation— Each member entitled to an in- 
dividual testimony of the truth. 

My brethren and sisters, I am pleased 
to have the privilege of meeting with 
you at this Conference. I desire in 
the performance of my duty the kind 
assistance of your prayers of faith. I 
have been edified through the instruc- 
tions of my brethren. They have en- 
couraged me and also corrected me, for 
I find in them instructions which will 
enable me to improve wherein I lack, 
and encourage me in the enjoyment of 
the blessings resulting from the duties 
which perhaps I have performed more 
faithfully than others. In contemplat- 
ing the character of these instructions, 
it is a solemn testimony to me of the 
truth of which my brethren have 
spoken, that the Church is guided by 
the spirit of revelation. But we are 
not guided by the spirit of revelation 
as much as we ought to be. I think 
sometimes that we ha,ve not fully di- 
vested ourselves of the elements of sec- 
tarianism which some of us may have 
brought from the world and which oth- 
ers have imbibed because of their

weaknesses. Our Elders, in preaching 
the Gospel in the various nations of the 
earth, call attention to the fact that it 
has always been a characteristic of 
humanity to profess a belief in the 
revelations and the remarkable mani- 
festations of the power of God which 
have been exhibited before their day. 
But when confronted with the oppor- 
tunity or necessity of exercising the 
same faith, and enjoying immediate 
revelation, they have been weighed in 
the balance and found wanting. The 
Church of Christ never did exist on the 
earth, only as it existed by the spirit 
of revelation from God. The Jews, 
when the Gospel was presented to them 
by John the Baptist and also by the 
Savior, had just the same opportuni- 
ties that the Christian world of today 
have, that is, of reading from the Scrip- 
ture, which had been made by the 
Prophets preceding them, and 
receiving instructions from the 
doctors of the law and 
those whose pretended business 
it was to expound the Scriptures. But 
when one came to them and said that 
the kingdom of God was nigh at hand, 
they were not prepared to receive it. 
The Gospel then as now was a test to 
all institutions. John the Baptist said 
"The ax is laid unto the root of the 
tree, therefore ever-- tree which bring- 
eth not forth good fruit, is hewn down 
and cast into the fire." Jesus was de- 
siring to bring to the attention of His 
disciples the necessity of being built 
upon a solid foundation, and pro- 
pounded a question unto them as re- 
corded in Matthew, 16th chapter. He 
said: "Whom do men say that I, the 
Son of Man, am?" And His disciples 
said, "Some say that thou art John 
the Baptist; some, Elias: and others, 
Jeremiah or one of the Prophets." Thus 
we see that it was all guess work with 
them, so far as the general public were 
concerned. He turned to the Apostles 
and said: "But whom say ye that I 
am?" In response there came an em- 
phatic testimony, not from a doctor of 
the law, not from an educated man, 
who had built his faith upon a mere 
reading of the ancient scripture, but 
from a poor, unlettered man, who had 
been called by the voice of the Son of 
God from the fisherman's net, when 



the Messiah had said to him and his 
brother Andrew "Come and follow me 
and I will make you fishers of men." 
From Peter the testimony came in no 
uncertain tones, saying, "Thou are the 
Christ, the Son of the living God." 
And Jesus said to Peter: "Blessed art 
thou, Simon Barjona: for flesh and 
blood hath not revealed it unto thee, 
but My Father which is in heaven." 

I wish to bear my testimony that 
flesh and blood never did, because it 
never could, reveal unto man the iden- 
tity of the Son of God, or make plain 
to the understanding of the children of 
men the things of God in any respect; 
and if it required a revelation for the 
Apostle Peter to bear witness that 
Jesus was the Christ, it will require 
revelation for every man and woman 
in every dispensation of the Gos- 
pel, to bear the same testi- 
mony. Indeed, the Son of God 
enunciated this fact as an eternal doc- 
trine, when he sent the Seventies out 
to declare the Gospel. He had com- 
manded them to go without purse or 
scrip, just as the servants of God have 
been commanded in this dispensation, 
that the world may be tested and that 
the disciples of the Son of God may act 
upon the principle of faith and trust in 
God to provide for them the necessities 
and comforts of life. When the Seventy 
returned to the Savior with the report 
of their mission, they said that they 
lacked nothing: 

"In that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit, 
and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord 
of heaven and earth that thou hast hid 
these things from the wise and prudent, 
and hast revealed them unto babes; 
even so, Father, for so it seemed good 
in thy sight. 

"All things are delivered to me of 
my Father; and no man knoweth who 
the Son is, but the Father; and who 
the Father is, but the Son, and he to 
whom the Son will reveal Him." 

This is a plain and simple doctrine, 
and whatever may be the attainments 
of mankind, based upon the oppor- 
tunities of the age in which we live, 
augmented by the experience and the 
learning of the preceding generations, 
they cannot understand the things of 
God, without the spirit of revelation. 

I wish to bear my testimony that the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints was founded upon the principle 



36 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



of revelation, and that it has been guid- 
ed and controlled by the spirit of revela- 
tion from its inception to the present 
time. God designed to guide this 
Church by the voice of revelation. 
When I see any lack of confidence on 
the part of our people in the wisdom of 
the Prophet of God and his associates, 
I am impressed with the fact that we 
are lacking in that faith which belongs 
to the work of God. When the Prophet 
Joseph "Smith was instrumental in es- 
tablishing this work, he made certain 
promises, such as have been alluded to 
by my brethren today. These promises 
have been fulfilled to the very 
letter. They not only ex- 
tended to the remarkable mani- 
festation of the gifts and powers of the 
Holy Ghost, but they extended to a 
promise that every man and every wo- 
man in the Church should have a sub- 
stantial testimony concerning the pro- 
priety of every movement made by the 
Prophet of God, in advancing the in- 
terests of the work of God upon the 
earth. And it can be pointed out on 
the pages of history that neither the 
Prophet Joseph Smith nor any of his 
successors ever gave counsel unto the 
Saints of God that was not attended 
with blessings and prosperity to those 
who heeded and acted upon it. More- 
over, it cannbt be found upon the pages 
of history where any man has risen 
up in opposition to that counsel and has 
stretched forth his hand to steady the 
ark of God, but what that man has 
come to disappointment and his folly 
has been made manifest in the midst 
of the people of God. I can bear my tes- 
timony that these evidences, which 
have been recorded as a result of 
the experience of this Church, will con- 
tinue down to the latest period of time. 
God has established this work; He has 
maintained it; He has prospered it in 
the earth, and He will continue to do so 
from this time henceforth and forever. 
God bless you, in the name of Jesus. 
Amen.

ous evil. 

My brothers and sisters, I trust that I 
may have your support and the bless- 



ings of God to guide me in my utter- 
ances here this afternoon. I have no 
other desire in standing before you than 
to give you that which the Lord may 
reveal unto me. and I desire to so live 
that whenever I am called upon to oc- 
cupy a position of this kind, the Lord 
may be pleased to favor me with His 
Holy Spirit, that I may not be left to 
depend upon the wisdom of man. 

I have a desire this afternoon to say 
some words that may be stimulating 
and encouraging to those who hold the 
Priesthood, especially to those who are 
acting in the Lesser Priesthood. Presi- 
dent Snow has gone among the people 
and discharged the duties which our 
Heavenly Father has given him to 
perform, and after doing so, he unloads 
a great degree of this responsibility up- 
on the shoulders of the Priesthood in 
all its organizations. I know there is 
not that activity among many quorums 
of the Priesthood that there ought to 
be; and while it is true the Latter-day 
Saints during the past year have done 
exceedingly well in the payment of 
their tithes, they have not done as well 
as they would have done had the 
Teachers, and Priests and the Elders 
in Israel performed their duties as 
faithfully as President Snow has dis- 
charge his. True, most men who 
hold these positions are younger men 
than President Snow, but I regret to 
have to acknowledge that they have 
not been as diligent throughout the 
different Stakes and wards of Zion in 
regard to this message, which the 
Prophet of the Lord has given to the 
people, as they should have been. While 
visiting a Stake a short time ago, I 
learned by questioning the High Coun- 
cil, that some of them had not been 
visited by their Teachers for years; 
and while that Stake had increased 
about fifty per cent in the 
payment of their tithes dur- 
ing the past year, I thought to 
myself, what a showing they might 
have made, if the Priesthood in all its 
departments had been active and faith- 
ful. 

In order that I might bring before 
you what I desire. I will read a portion 
of the 12th chapter of First Corin- 
thians. 

"For by one spirit we are all baptized

unto one body, whether we be Jews or 
Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; 
and have all been made to drink into 
one spirit; 

"For the body is not one member but 
many. 

*'If the foot shall say, because I am 
not the hand, I am not of the body; is it 
therefore not of the body 

"And if the ear shall say, because I 
am not the eye I am not of the body; 
is it therefore not of the body? 

"If the whole body were an eye, where 
were the hearing? If the whole were 
hearing, where were the smelling? 

"But now hath the Lord set thee 
members every one of them in the body, 
as it has pleased Him. 

"And if they were all one member, 
where were the body? 

"And now are they many members, 
yet but one body, 

"And the eye cannot say unto the 
hand, I have no need of thee; nor again, 
the head to the feet, I have no need of 
you. 

"Nay, much more, those members of 
the body, which seem to be more feeble, 
are necessary; 

"And those members of the body, 
which Ave think to be less honorable, 
upon these we bestow more abundant 
honor; and our uncomely Darts have 
more abundant comliness. 

"For our comely parts have no need; 
but God hath tempered the body to- 
gether, having given more abundant 
honor to that part which lacked. 

"That there should be no schism in the 
body; but that the members should 
have the same care one for another. 

"And whether one member suffer, all 
the members suffer with it; or one 
member be honored, all the members re- 
joice with it. 

"Now ve are the body of Christ, and 
members in particular. 

"And God hath set some in the 
Church: first, Apostles; secondarily, 
prophets; thirdlv. teachers; after that 
miracles: then gifts of healing, helps, 
governments, diversities of tongues. 

"Are all Apostles? are all prophets? 
are all teachers? are all workers of 
miracles? 

"Have all the gifts of healing? do all 
speak with tongues? do all interpret? 

"But covet earnestly the best gifts: 
and yet shew I unto you a more excel- 
lent way." 

The Church of Christ was referred to 
here yesterday and compared to a man 
seventy years of age, The Apostle Paul 
also in his beautiful figure compared 
the Church of Christ to the body of a 
man. I wish to say a few words re- 
garding this figure which has been used, 
I have asked myself, what is the great- 
est cause for the difference between 
the Church of Christ and the 
churches that have been es- 



tablished by man, for there are many 
forms of religion, some patterning close- 
ly after the one founded by our Lord 
and Master Jesus Christ. And I have 
thought, is it not because these differ- 
ent bodies have not the Spirit? I com- 
pared this spirit to the Priesthood of 
the Son of God, and concluded in my 
own mind that this was the greatest 
cause of the difference which exists be- 
tween the Church which Christ has es- 
tablished and the churches which have 
been established by man. When the 
Prophet Joseph inquired of the Lord re- 
garding the divinity of the different de- 
nominations that then existed upon the 
earth, and many of which exist today, 
he was told that they had a' form of 
godliness, but denied the power thereof; 
that they drew near unto the Lord with 
their lips, but their hearts were far 
from Him. I thought to myself what 
a comparison there was between the 
true Church of God, with the Priest- 
hood and Spirit to enliven it, and the 
dead forms of religion, as they have 
been instituted by men. We might 
carry this comparison a little farther, 
and take the skeleton of this 
body, the organization of the 
Church of Christ, animated by the 
Spirit and Priesthood of God, and in 
connection with this skeleton we have 
the sinews, the helps in government, 
the muscles, the nerve system and the 
circulation of the blood from the heart 
into all parts of the body. And just 
as it is impossible for a human body to 
exist without the spirit, so is it im- 
possible for the Church of Christ to ex- 
ist without the Priesthood of the Son of 
God. Just as it is imposible for a body 
to be complete without the brain, the 
heart and the other organs of the sys- 
tem, so would it be impossible for the 
Church of Christ to exist in perfection 
without the Presidency, the Apostles, 
the Seventies, the High Priests, the El- 
ders, the Priests, Teachers and Dea- 
cons. All of them have their special work 
to perform, just as the organs of the hu- 
man system have their particu- 
lar part to do. I compared 
the circulation of the blood 
in the body to the active Priesthood, 
which goes about the whole body of 
the Church, imparting life and vigor 
and setting in order all of the parts 
that may be out of place. Whenever 



38 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



a member becomes injured, the blood 
assists in building it up. So with the 
workings of the Priesthood of the Son 
of God, in the great body which Christ 
has established. 

I believe that every organization of 
the Priesthood is just as important and 
vital to the Church of Christ as every 
organ is to the human system; and 
in Stakes or wards where the Deacons, 
the Teachers, the Priests and the El- 
ders have nothing to do, there will be a 
stagnation of blood. Our people have 
suffered the malady in neglecting to pay 
their tithes, but now this Priesthood is 
getting to work, this blood is circulat- 
ing more freely, and directing its at- 
tention especially in the direction of 
curing the body of this particular mala- 
dy. The Priesthood has labored ener- 
getically, but not as much so as we 
should have done. There are many 
Teachers and Priests that have not la- 
bored as faithfully as they should have 
done. Think of what a beautiful body 
this would be if every quorum was ac- 
tive; if the blood circulated through 
every part of the system and if every 
part was renovated and cleansed, so 
that it might be in a perfect state of 
health. God help us that we may be 
able to get this body, the Church of 
Christ, into this desirable condition; 
that the list containing thousands of 
names of persons who ought to be 
tithe-payers and are not, may be wiped 
out. I believe that one of the most 
practical ways of bringing about this 
condition is for the Presidents of 
Stakes, Bishops of wards and the Pres- 
idents of Quorums to see to it that they 
discharge their part of this responsi- 
bility. It is not expected that Presi- 
dent Snow will be able to reach all 
parts of the body and be able personal- 
ly to regulate and renovate the 
body of Christ, but there are 
members of the body that have 
been chosen to do this work, 
and if they do not do it, that condition 
which we desire will not exist. 

I hope, my brethren and sisters, that 
President Snow shall live to see the 
desires of his heart granted unto him. 
I pray for this and labor for it among 
the brethren in the Stakes where I go, 
so that confidence in the. Church of 
Christ in regard to financial affairs may 



be maintained. The Church is now 
upon a good financial basis; but we 
ought not to cease our labors as soon 
as we hear good news. We ought not 
to run well for awhile, and then tire 
out just when our assistance is most 
needed. It has taken considerable 
labor on the part of the Priesthood to 
stir the people up to a realization of 
their condition and their negligence in 
regard to the payment of tithing, and 
it will take a continual labor on our 
part to keep the people awakened to 
these things. Strange that we always 
have to belabored with in order to get us 
to do right; nevertheless we have to be 
labored with and we have to labor with 
each other that we may keep alive in 
the Church of Christ. If we are not 
brought in contact with this Priest- 
hood and its workings we soon die out, 
just like a member of the human body 
would die out if the blood did not circu- 
late to that part. Thus it is very nec- 
essary that the brethren who hold the 
Priesthood and the sisters who are en- 
gaged in the different organizations of 
this Church should carry their respon- 
sibility and feel that there is an individ- 
ual responsibility connected with this 
work which rests upon them, and that 
God will not justify them if they do not 
discharge their duties in their separate 
callings. 

I wish to read, for the benefit of those 
who hold the Priesthood, from the 
third chapter of Ezekiel, beginning at 
the 17th verse: 

'Son of Man, I have made thee a 
watchman unto the house of Israel: 
therefore ' hear the word at my mouth, 
and give them warning from me. 

"When I say unto the wicked. Thou 
shalt surely die; and thou givest him 
not warning, nor speakest to warn the 
wicked from- his wicked way, to save 
his life; the same wicked man shall die 
in his iniquity; but his blood will I re- 
quire at thine hand. 

"Yet if thou warn the wicked, and he 
turn not from his wickedness, nor from 
his wicked way, he shall die in his 
iniquity, but thou hast delivered thy 
soul. 

"Again, when a righteous man doth 
turn from his righteousness, and com- 
mit iniquity, and I lay a stumbling- 
block before him, he shall die; because 
thou hast not given him warning, he 
shall die in his sin, and his righteous- 
ness which he hath done shall not be 
remembered; but his blood will I re- 
quire at thine hand." 



I 



ELDER ABRAHAM O WOODRUFF. 



This, my brethren and sisters, may 
be applied to those of us who have re- 
ceived the Priesthood of the Son of God. 
We have not received it through man. 
The leaders of this dispensation re- 
ceived it from Peter, James and John 
and John the Baptist, the men who held 
the keys of this Priesthood and who re- 
ceived it from the Son of God Himself. 
Therefore, the responsibility that we 
are under has not been placed upon us 
br man; it has come to us 
from God; and when the head 
shall say to us, Do this, or 
that, we are under obligations to do 
it. We are under obligations to see that 
there is no stagnation in our part of 
the body; that there is no negligence 
in the payment of tithes or in the keep- 
ing of any of the commandments in 
our Stake or ward or association. It is 
my duty at the head of any association, 
ward or Stake to see that the people are 
doing their duty. If they are entirely 
negligent to the teachings of God that 
come to us through His mouthpiece, I 
want 10 tell you, my brethren and sis- 
ters, that those who stand at the head 
of these organizations will come under 
condemnation. The Presidency, the 
Twelve, or the Seventy cannot be in all 
the wards; but there are men placed 
there with equal responsibility in their 
callings, and they have to discharge 
these duties or the Lord will not hold 
them guiltless. He will not excuse them 
if they do not labdr diligently and 
delve into the dark corners and see that 
there are no cobwebs in their Stake or 
ward, but that everything is working 
as it should do; that there 
is ' no clog in the machinery 
of * this great body of Christ, 
but that each is doing' his part. If we 
will do this we will gain salvation and 
we will enter into the presence of God 
and hear the welcome plaudit, "Well 
dope, thou good and faithful servant." 
If we do not, we cannot expect, be- 
cause the Priesthood has been con- 
ferred upon us, that we will inherit the 
celestial kingdom of our God. The 
Lord will not reward the drone, nor 
the slothful; He will not reward the 
unjust steward, the one who has not 
taken advantage of the opportunities 
God has placed within his grasp. If 
our talents are great, we have that 



39 

much more need to use them than those 
who are not so greatly blessed. 

Before taking my seat there is an- 
other matter that occurs to me which I 
wish to speak upon. I have noticed 
that there is a spirit creeping in among 
a certain class of the Latter-day Saints 
which is not of God, but of the world. 
It has been popular, ever since Mor- 
monism was established, to have large 
families; for we understand that there 
are hundreds of thousands of spirits 
in the other world anxious to be taber- 
nacled by good fathers and mothers, 
that they may pass through this state 
of probation. But there is a certain 
class of Latter-day Saints that has 
come to think as the Gentile world 
does — that it is not stylish, not nice 
to have large families; and therefore we 
find, much to our sorrow, that in some 
instances steps are taken to prevent 
these spirits being tabernacled by 
them. I want to say that every Lat- 
ter-day Saint ought to feel that the, 
are not justified before God their Fath- 
er in pursuing a course of this kind. 
We want, so far as God will favor us, 
the privilege and blessing of posterity. 
And those who employ means to pre- 
vent this will find in the spirit world 
that they have lost the stars in their 
crown and have shut out a means of 
exaltation; that they have done a grieV- 
cus wrong which they may not be able 
to repair for many ages, if at all. Those 
who fought the system of plural mar- 
riage in years gone by were people who 
were, as a rule, opposed to the large 
families of the Latter-day Saints, and 
took steps themselves to prevent spirits 
coming to them to be tabernacled, in 
some cases going so far as to be guilty 
of murdering the unborn innocents. Up- 
on such the curse of God will rest. I 
greatly desire that this practice shall 
not creep in among the Latter-day 
Saints. I have prayed that the Spirit 
of this subject might be given to some 
of the older members of this quorum, or 
to the Presidency, that they might 
dwell upon it, because I know, from 
what I have heard from reliable 
sources, that this spirit which I have 
spoken of is in a slight degree at any 
rate creeping in among the Latter-day 
Saints. Thank God for posteritv. 
Thank God for the large families of the

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Latter-day Saints. I wish that we had 
millions more of them today, and that 
the world were full of this class of peo- 
ple, who fear God and who desire to 
serve Him and keep His command- 
ments, and whose sons and daughters 
are reared in the principles of the Gos- 
pel of the Lord Jesus Christ. 

I thank my heavenly Father for the 
testimony which He has given me that 
this is His work, that President Snow 
is a Prophet of the true and living God, 
that God is with him, that He has in- 
spired him, and that the changes which 
are being brought about in our financial 
conditions are due to the revelations of 
God through His Prophet. May God 
help us to be faithful, to be loyal. May 
He give us His Spirit, that we may not 
get into the dark, that we may not lose 
the Spirit of the Gospel of the Lord 
Jesus. Let us stand up to the rack and 
do our part. Let us see to it that the 
responsibility which is placed upon us 
is discharged, that we may enter into 
the presence of God our Father, and 
share the reward of the laborer and 
those who have been valiant for the 
testimony of Jesus, and receive eternal 
life. I ask it through Christ, our Re- 
deemer. Amen. 

PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 

Pfeseivatlon and Multiplication of life — Dangers 
of sign seeking — Man established in the truth 
by faithfulness and the spirit of G n d. 

It will give me great pleasure to re- 
ceive the spirit to bear testimony to 
that which we have heard today and 
yesterday. I think the true spirit of 
counsel and instruction has rested upon 
the Apostles who have spoken to us 
during this conference so far, and I de- 
sire to say that I endorse with all my 
heart the excellent counsel and blessed 
instruction which they have given to 
this people. I sincerely hope we will re- 
member these counsels, and remember- 
ing them, carry them out in our lives. 
It matters not how many good things 
we may hear, nor how much we may 
know, if we do not apply the instruc- 
tions we receive and the knowledge we 
possess to the accomplishment of the 
work that we have in hand. The para- 
mount duty is to labor for Zion, and 
work for our own salvation, that we 
may gain the victory over ourselves and 
over the powers of evil that are in the 



world. The Gospel has been preached 
to us, and we have essayed to obey it, 
that we might become the sons and 
daughters of God — heirs of God and 
joint-heirs with his Son. We can never 
attain to the blessings of the Gospel by 
merely becoming acquainted with it and 
then sitting down and doing nothing 
ourselves to stem the current of e^il 
that is preying upon us and upon the 
world. 

The remarks that have just been 
made by Brother Woodruff are worthy 
of attention and acceptation on the part 
of the young men and young women of 
Zion. Those who have taken upon 
themselves the responsibility of wedded 
life should see to it that they do not 
abuse the course of nature; that they 
do not destroy the principle of life with- 
in them, nor violate any of the com- 
mandments of God. The command 
which he gave in the beginning to mul- 
tiply and replenish the earth is still in 
force upon the children of men. 
Possibly no greater sin could 
be committed by the people who 
have embraced this Gospel than to pre- 
vent or to destroy life in the manner in- 
dicated. We are born into the world 
that we may have life, and we live that 
we may have a fulness of joy, and if 
we will obtain a fulness of joy, we must 
obey the law of our creation and the 
law by which we may obtain the con- 
summation of our righteous hopes and 
desires — life eternal. 

If the time will permit, I desire to en- 
dorse the sentiments that were ex- 
pressed bv Brother Grant. It is a 
wicked and adulterous generation that 
seeketh after a sign. Show me Latter- 
day Saints who have to feed upon mir- 
acles, signs and visions in order to keep 
them steadfast^ in the Church, and I 
will show you members of the Church 
who are not in good standing before 
God, and who are walking in slippery 
paths. It is not by marvelous mani- 
festations unto us that we shall be es- 
tablished in the truth, but it is by hu- 
mility and faithful obedience to the 
commandments and laws of God. When 
I as a boy first started out in the min- 
istry I would frequently go out and ask 
the Lord to show me some marvelous 
thing, in order that I might receive a 
testimony. But the Lord withheld 
marvels from me, and showed me the 



PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 



truth, line upon line, precept upon pre- 
cept, here a little and there a little, un- 
til he made me to know the truth from 
the crown of my head to the soles of 
my feet, and until doubt and fear had 
been absolutely purged from me. He 
did not have to send an angel from the 
heavens to do this, nor did He have to 
speak with the trump of an archangel. 
By the whisperings of the still small 
voice of the spirit of the living God, He 
gave to me the testimony I possess. 
And by this principle and power He 
will eive to all the children of men a 
knowledge of the truth that will stay 
with them, and it will make them to 
know the truth, as God knows it, and 
to do the will of the Father as Christ 
does it. And no amount of marvelous 
manifestations will ever accomplish this. 
It is obedience, humility and sub- 
mission to the requirements of heaven 
and to the order established in the 
kingdom of God upon the earth that will 
establish men in the truth. Men may 
receive the visitation .of angels; they 
may speak in tongues; they may in- 
terpret; they may prophesy; they may 
heal the sick by the laying on of hands; 
they may have visions and dreams; but 
except they are faithful and pure in 
heart, they become an easy prey to the 
adversary of their souls, and he will 
lead them into darkness and unbelief 
more easily than others. The devil him- 
self can appear like an angel of light. 
False prophets and false teachers have 
arisen in the world. There is perhaps 
no gift of the spirit of God more easily 
imitated by the devil than the gift of 
tongues. Where two men or women 
exercise the gift of tongues by the in- 
spiration of the spirit of God, there are 
a dozen perhaps that do it by the in- 
spiration of the devil. Bless your souls, 
apostates speak in tongues, apostates 
prophesy; apostates claim to have mar- 
velous manifestations. And what is 
that to us? The trouble is, we know 
so little of the truth ourselves and we 
live by it so poorly that almost any lit- 
tle jackanapes in the country may rise 
up and claim he has had a vision, or 
some marvelous dream, and however 
absurd or untrue it may be, he may find 
believers and followers among those 
who profess to be Latter-day Saints. 
I believe in the gifts of the Holy 



Spirit unto men, but I do not want the 
gift of tongues, except when I need it. 
I needed the gift of tongues once and 
the Lord gave it to me. I was in a 
foreign land, sent to preach the Gospel 
to a people whose language I could not 
understand. Then I sought earnestly 
for the gift of tongues, and by this gift 
and by study, in a hundred days after 
landing upon those islands I could talk 
to the people in their language as I now 
talk to you in my native tongue. This 
was a gift that was worthy of 
the Gospel. There was a purpose 
in it. There was something in it to 
strengthen my faith, to encourage me 
and to help me in my ministry. If you 
have need of this gift of tongues, seek 
for it and God will help you in it. But 
I do not ask you to be very hungry 
for the gift of tongues, for if you are 
not careful the devil will deceive you 
in it. He can talk by the gift of 
tongues as well as the Lord can. Paul 
did not seem to care much about the 
gift of tongues either. He said to the 
Corinthians: 

"I had rather speak five words with 
my understanding, that by my voice I 
might teach others also, than ten 
thousand words in an unknown 
tongue." 

So far as I am concerned, if the 
Lord will give me ability to teach the 
people in my native tongue, or in their 
own language to the understanding of 
those that hear me, that will be suffi- 
cient gift of tongues to me. . Yet if 
the Lord gives ^nu the gift of tongues, 
do not despise it, do not reject it. For 
if it comes from the Spirit of God, it 
will come to those who are worthy to 
receive it, and it is all right. But this 
idea of seeking it, desiring it, when you 
don't pay your tithing, when you don't 
pray in your families, when you don't 
pay your debts, when you desecrate the 
Sabbath day, and when you neglect 
other duties in the Church; I tell you 
the devil will take advantage of you 
bye and bye, if he does not at first. 

The time will not permit me. or I 
would like to take the Scriptures and 
read from them in relation to this 
subject. I love the truth; I love my 
brethren, and I know that the visiting 
of an angel alone will not keep one in 
the Church. The opening of the heav- 



42 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



ens to you in marvelous manifestations 
will not establish you in the truth. We 
have abundant proof of that in the 
history of the Church. But the 
men and the women who are 
honest before God, who humbly plod 
along, doing their dut-"- paying 
their tithing and exercising 
that pure religion and undefiled before 
God and the Father, which is to visit 
the fatherless and widows in their af- 
flictions and to keep ones self unspot- 
ted from the world and who help look 
after the poor; and who honor the 
holy Priesthood, who do not run into 
excesses, who are prayerful in their 
families and who acknowledge the Lord 
in their hearts, they will build up a 
foundation that the gates of hell can- 
not prevail against; and if the floods 
come and the storms beat upon their 
house, it shall not fall, for it will be 
built upon the rock of eternal truth. I 
pray that this vast congregation will 
build upon this imperishable foundation, 
upon the principle expressed by the 



words of Joshua, "as for me and my 
house, we will serve God," and as also 
expressed by Job, "Though he slay me, 
yet will I put my trust in Him." If you 
have that spirit toward God and His 
work in these latter days, you will 
build, steadily and, slowly it may be, 
but surely, upon a foundation that will 
endure throughout the countless ages of 
eternity. And if you do not get any 
great manifestations, you need not wor- 
ry about it. You will get the testimony 
of Jesus Christ in your hearts and you 
will know God and Jesus whom He has 
sent, whom to know is life eternal, just 
as well as those who receive visions. For 
those who do receive visions, the devil 
will try to make them believe that they 
were delusions, and if they commit sin, 
he will be sure to make them believe it. 
God bless you, is my prayer. Amen.

Far from the paths of truth.

Kimball. 



THIRD DAY. 



Sunday, April 6th, 10 a. m. 
The choir and congregation sang the 
hymn commencing: 

Redeemer of Israel, 
Our only delight, 

On whom for a blessing we call. 

Opening prayer by Elder Charles W. 
Penrose. 

Singing by the choir: 

All hail the glorious day, 

By Prophets long foretold, 
When, with harmonious lay, 
The sheep of Israel's fold 
On Zion's hill His praise proclaim, 
And shout hosanna to His name. 

ELDER RUDGER CLAWSON. 

A striking evidence of God's goodness— Tithing 
and consecration — Importance of Church 
records. 

Brethren and sisters, I can say that I 
have greatly rejoiced in the spirit of 
this conference. We have truly had a 
time of instruction and refreshing to 
our souls, and this conference, held in 
the seventieth year of our age as a 
Church, has this far been one of the 



best that we have ever had. What a 
great variety of instruction has been 
given to this people, and we can see 
the growth and progress that has been 
made since we were convened in con- 
ference one year ago. We rejoice in it, 
and our hearts are made glad. Notwith- 
standing this, however, we witness 
things in the Church that need atten- 
tion and correction, and we know that 
there is opportunity for still greater 
growth and progress. The Lord, as if 
in smiling approval of His Church 
(speaking of the Church as a whole) 
has sent a most glorious storm — a storm 
that was greatly needed and that gives 
promise of abundant crops in the year 
1900. So greatly needed was this storm 
that the Latter-day Saints can overlook 
the inconvenience of getting around, 
and can lift up their hearts in praise 
and thanksgiving to God. Truly we 
are a blessed people. 

I was very deeply impressed with the 
revelation that was read in part by 
President Snow at the Priesthood meet- 



ELDER RUDGER CLAW SON. 



ing last evening, and also the very in- 
structive comments made upon it. It is 
of such great and vital interest that I 
have thought to read the revelation to 
you this morning. It is recorded in 
section 85 of the Book of Doctrine and 
Covenants. The Lord says: 

"It is the duty of the Lord's clerk, 
whom He has appointed, to keep a his- 
tory, and a general Church record of 
all things that transpire in Zion, and 
of all those who consecrate properties, 
and receive inheritances legally from 
the Bishop; 

"And also their manner of life, their 
faith, and works; and also of the apos- 
tates who apostatize after receiving 
their inheritances. 

"It is contrary to the will and com- 
mandment of God, that those who re- 
ceive not their inheritance by consecra- 
tion, agreeably to His law, which He 
has given, that He may tithe His peo- 
ple, to prepare them against the day of 
vengeance and burning, should have 
their names enrolled with the people of 
God; 

"Neither is their genealogy to be kept, 
or to be had where it may be found on 
any records or history of the Church; 

"Their names shall not be found, 
neither the names of the fathers, nor 
the names of the children written in the 
book of the law of God, saith the Lord 
of Hosts. 

"Yea. thus said the still small voice, 
which whispereth through and pierceth 
all things, and often times it maketh 
my bones to auake while it maketh 
manifest, saying: 

"And it shall come to pass that I, 
the Lord God. will send one mighty 
and strong, holding the sceptre of pow- 
er in his hand, clothed with light for a 
covering - , whose mouth shall utter 
words, eternal words; while his bowels 
shall be a fountain of truth, to set 
in order the house of God, and to ar- 
range by lot the inheritances of the 
Saint s. whose names are found, and 
the names of their fathers, and of their 
children, enrolled in the book of the law 
of God: 

"While that man, who was called of 
God and appointed, that putteth forth 
his hand to steady the ark of God, shall 
fall by the shaft of death, like as a 
tree that is smitten by the vivid shaft 
of lightning; 

"And all they who are not found writ- 
ten in the book of remembrance, shall 
find nor>e inheritance in that day, but 
they shall be cut asunder, and their 
portion shall be appointed them among 
unbelievers, where are wailing and 
gnashing of teeth. 

"These things I say not of myself: 
therefore, as the Lord speaketh, He will 
also fulfill. 

"And they who are of the High 
Priesthood, whose names are not found 
written in the book of the law, or that 



are found to have apostatized, or to 
have been cut off from the Church; as 
well as the Lesser Priesthood, or the 
members, in that day, shall not find 
an inheritance among the Saints of the 
Most High; 

"Therefore it shall be done unto them 
as unto the children of the priest, as 
will be found recorded in the second 
chapter and sixty-first verse of Ezra." 

Brethren and sisters, the Lord in re- 
vealing to the Prophet Joseph that a 
day of vengeance and burning is com- 
ing upon the earth, did not desire, I 
think, to arouse any feelings of fear or 
anxiety in the minds of His people. 
It was simply that they should 
be made acauainted with the 
fact that such a day is coming upon 
the earth and also that there should be 
a preparation made by his people for 
that time, that they might be able to 
abide that great and dreadful day of 
the Lord. One peculiar feature of 
this revelation is that while the Lord 
speaks of this time of trouble and ca- 
lamity, he also comes down to the sim- 
ple matter as it might seem to some, of 
giving instructions to his clerk. He says 
that his clerk shall keep a 
history and a general Church 
record of all things that trans- 
pire in Zion, and in the manner of 
life and faith and works of His peo- 
ple, and especially that it should be 
recorded of His people that they pay 
their tithes and offerings, and later per- 
haps that they shall observe the law 
of consecration, that they may escape 
the day of vengeance and burning. We 
see that the Lord is very particular 
in this matter. In the early days of the 
Church, some baptisms for the dead that 
were not properly witnessed and record- 
ed, were rejected of the Lord, and the 
work had to be done over again. We 
know that great care and attention is 
given to this matter today in our Tem- 
ples, and that efficient help must be 
secured to do this. Let me tell you 
something in relation to this great 
Temple of the Lord in Salt Lake City. 
From the time that that Temple was de- 
dicated, in 1893, up to the year 1899, 
there were 475,662 ordinances performed 
therein, and for the year 1899, 68,871. 
making a grand total of 544,337 ordin- 
ances performed in the House of the 
Lord for the living and the dead, and 
this does not include the work that has 



44 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



been done in other temples of God. 
Truly it is a great and marvelous work, 
and not the least important thing about 
it is that these ordinances are all care- 
fully recorded in the books and are filed 
away in the archives of the Temple, to 
be brought forth in due time. From 
these records the people who have gone 
to that house will be judged. Nothing 
that is done in that Temple will be ac- 
cepted of the Lord, except 
it is properly witnessed and 
recorded. The Temple work 
is strictly looked after each day, so 
that nothing is neglected or omitted, 
much to the credit of those who labor 
in the Temples. The great work per- 
formed in the Salt Lake Temple, has 
thus far been accomplished under the 
Presidency of our Prophet and Seer, 
and we rejoice in it. 

I also want to say to you, my breth- 
ren and sisters, inasmuch as there is 
more or less anxiety at times among 
some of the Saints concerning the tith- 
ing, that the tithing records of this 
Church were never before in such good 
condition as they are today. I ask the 
Presidents of Stakes and the Bishops of 
wards to bear witness with me that the 
tithing is most strictly looked after, 
and that no mistakes occur, but which 
are readily detected. I was going to 
say that the "eagle eye" of the Presid- 
ing Bishop of this Church, through the 
very efficient help that he has, detects 
every inaccuracy and every neglect in 
the recording of the tithes. The Presid- 
ing Bishop is one of the Lord's clerks, 
and he of necessity must keep a strict 
and careful record. All of the tithing 
reports which come from the forty-two 
Stakes of Zion, covering Ave hundred 
and thirty-eight wards, are carefully 
tabulated and filed away in the Bishop's 
office, and you would be astonished, if 
you went there, to find how readily 
you could get any information pertain- 
ing to the tithing of this Church. There 
is no man, woman or child in this 
Church who has paid tithing, but whose 
name will be found upon the tithing 
records in the Bishop's office and the 
office of the First Presidency. It is all 
understood, and we are fast coming to 
that condition where nothing will be 
neglected or wasted. There are losses 
that occur in a natural and proper way, 
and that cannot be avoided, but the 



tithing is most carefully looked after. 
I have admired the system that is fol- 
lowed in the Presiding Bishop's office. 

There is another matter that I would 
like to speak of briefly, and that is 
this: God has inspired his ser- 
vant not only to look after the proper 
recording of the tithes of His people, 
but also to call for the names of the non- 
tithepayers of the Church. This is 
something that has never been done be- 
fore, so far as I know. A list most 
carefully prepared as to names, but not 
always as to explanations has been 
compiled and furnished the First Presi- 
dency of this Church. That action 
seems to have come to us through the 
inspiration of God, that it shall be 
known who are neglectful in the midst 
of His people. I do not know that I 
am authorized to tell you how many 
names there are in it, but I can say 
that it is a large book. It was pre- 
sented at the Priesthood meeting last 
night as a text book to talk upon. Presi- 
dent Snow talked from that text, and 
Presiding Bishop Preston talked on it. 
It was a big text, so large that he could 
hardly follow it. There is not a man 
or woman in this Church who ought to 
pay tithing and who does not, but 
whose name is recorded in that great 
book. It was designed that in each 
case a reason should be given why each 
person had not paid tithing. But this 
has not been fully done in all cases, 
owing no doubt to the fact that this is 
the first request of the kind that has 
been made of the Bishops of this 
Church; but there will be an improve- 
ment in this particular hereafter. The 
lines are being drawn. It must be 
known to the authorities of this Church 
and to the people who are faithful and 
who are not faithful. God requires it 
and it must be recorded, for the rea- 
son plainly set forth in the revelation, 
that those whose names are not found 
recorded in the book of the law of God 
shall have no inheritance in Zion in 
that day when our eternal inheritances 
shall be divided out to us. Therefore 
it is a matter of serious importance, 
and we appreciate the meaning of the 
great text that was given to us in our 
Priesthood meeting. I am sure that 
those who were present were 
deeply impressed by what 



ELDER RUDGER CLAW SON.

they saw and the instructions 
that were given. Notwithstanding this, 
I desire to say that if the Latter-day 
Saints shall make as much advance- 
ment in the year 1900 as they have done 
in the year 1899, it will be a bright and 
glorious day for Zion. I believe that 
God is well pleased with the efforts 
that have been made and with the 
faithful among His people. There is 
one reflection I had concerning the 
book of which I have spoken, and that 
is, it simply gives the names of non- 
tithe-payers in the Church. It does 
not give the names of those who have 
paid only fifteen per cent of what they 
should pay, or twenty per cent, or fifty 
per cent, or seventy-five per cent. There 
are doubtless many of the people who 
only paid a partial tithing, or as 
Bishop Preston says, "a little ten per 
cent," which he informs us is no ten 
per cent at all. Ten per cent is ten 
per cent, and a tithing is ten per cent, 
neither more nor less. When it is below 
that, the view has been held that it is 
simply an offering to the Lord. How- 
ever these partial payments have been 
accepted and recorded among the names 
of those who have paid tithing; for 
every man and woman in this Church 
shall have due credit for what they 
do. 

I had the permission of the President 
of the Church to look through that 
book, and I want to give you a very 
brief summary of what I found there 
as to why many people in this Church 
failed to pay their tithing last year. 
There are some people who will say: 
"Of course there were those among us 
who did not pay tithing last year; — 
some young men doubtless who have 
just come into their majority, or who 
have perhaps for the first time earned 
a little means and are not acquainted 
with this great law of tithing." In 
answer to that I want to say that it 
is a mistake. There may have been 
some such, but there were many High 
Priests, Seventies, and Elders, as well 
as members of the Lesser Priesthood, 
who failed to observe the law in 
1899. That is the most astonishing 
thing connected with it. And 
what is still more curious is some of 
the reasons that are given why these 
bearers of the Priesthood did not pay 



tithing. Let me say that in some cases 
no reasons were given at all, which in- 
dicated to me that the Bishops of those 
wards failed to see those who were 
derelict in their duty, failed to talk with 
them and get their reason for not pay- 
ing tithing, which shows a great neg- 
lect. In some cases the reason given 
was, carelessness; in others, indiffer- 
ence; in others, a lack of faith. A very 
large number come under these heads. 
One High Priest was not converted to 
the principle. I say one; there was 
quite a number of High Priests against 
whose names the reason s-iven was that 
they were not converted to the prin- 
ciple. In other words, they did not be- 
lieve the revelation of God, and yet they 
were High Priests in the Church. The 
reason given in the case of one Elder 
was that he hadn't thought enough 
about it to see the necessity of it. Is 
it not rather remarkable that we can 
find an Elder in this Church who has 
not thought enough about the law of 
God to see the necessity of obeying it? 
I wonder if he thought enough about 
the principle of baptism to be baptized, 
or about the principle of laying on of 
hands to have the hands of the Priest- 
hood laid upon him for the reception of 
the Holy Ghost? "We learned from 
President Cannon last night that the 
law of tithing is just as essential and as 
saving a principle as the principle of 
baptism or the laying on of hands. In 
another case an Elder, a member of one 
of the Stake boards of the Y. M. M. I. 
A., had never paid tithing, so I pre- 
sume that he had never been converted. 
In the case of several High Priests and 
a number of Seventies, the reason given 
was that though they were abundantly 
able to observe this law, they were not 
willing. In the case of a number of 
Seventies, the reason given was 
that' they did not believe 
in paying tithing. I presume 
that would probably be the case with all 
who wilfully neglected their duty. In 
the case of a High Priest, the reason 
given was that his wife paid a good 
tithing, but he did nothing. There may 
be a chance for that brother; his wife 
may be able to bring him into the 
kingdom. We hope so at least. Here, 
brethren and sisters, is a very remark- 
able explanation that was offered in 



46 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



the case of a Teacher in this Church. 
It does not say whether he was an 
active Teacher, or an ordained Teacher. 
The explanation is that he did not be- 
lieve in tithing or in a God. The great 
wonder is that he is in the Church at 
all. In the case of an Elder, it was ex- 
plained that he could not be persuaded 
to do anything in a Church capacity. 
This is not to be wondered at, for a 
man who fails to pay his tithing will 
lose the spirit of the work, and if he 
persists in that direction, he will apos- 
tatize and leave the Church, as sure as 
God lives. In the case of an Elder, the 
reason was given that he could not 
afford to pay tithing. Notwithstanding 
one-tenth of his earnings belonged to 
the Lord, he could not afford to pay to 
the Lord that which belonged to him, so 
he appropriated it and made use of it 
in other directions. In the case of a 
Seventy, it was said that he argued 
against the principle, and yet he is a 
Seventy in the Church ! In the case of 
another, he had no faith in the Gospel! 
Here is a very strange explanation 
given in the case of a Seventy: It 
states that he does not like the Bishop, 
consequently he ignores the law of God. 
I suppose that because he does not like 
the Bishop, he won't be saved. Of one 
Elder it was said that he was full of 
good intentions for the future. Of course 
we have no means of knowing whether 
these good intentions may be relied 
upon for the future, but we do know 
that these good intentions did not lead 
him to pay his tithing in the year 1899. 
Here is an explanation, which will be 
the last I shall give: The Bishop, in re- 
ferring to twelve non-tithe payers, says, 
"We think some of these would have 
paid tithing, had they been aroused im- 
mediately before the settlement of 
tithing." Well, confession is good for 
the soul, and that Bishop confesses that 
he failed entirely in his duty in not 
visiting these twelve non-tithe payers 
and arousing them to their duty. Of 
course, the great responsibility rests 
first upon the non-tithe payer, but after 
that there is a responsibility resting 
upon the Bishop and upon the president 
of the Stake. They should be familiar 
with the people in their Stake and in 
the ward who fail to pay tithing, and 
they should labor with them and try 



to bring them into a condition where 
they will keep the commandments of 
God. Now, in conclusion I want to bear 
testimony to the record that has been 
made by one ward in Salt Lake City — 
and perhaps the same may be said of 
others, for aught I know; but this ward 
has come to my attention through the 
Bishop. There were only four non- 
tithepayers in that ward, and the ward 
paid to this Church something like ten 
thousand dollars in tithing. I tell you 
I was gratified, and I said to that Bish- 
op, The reason to me is very apparent; 
you are interested in this matter of 
tithing, you are acquainted with your 
people. You know every tithe-payer in 
your ward, and you know every non- 
tithepayer, or you could not tell me that 
there were only four, and you are look- 
ing after them. The trouble, as shown 
by this great report, is that the Bishops 
and the authorities have been some- 
what derelict in their duty. In many 
cases the Bishop could not tell you how 
many non-tithepayers there were in his 
ward, let alone not being able to tell 
you who they were and why they 
failed in this duty. Now, brethren and 
sisters, if there are in this vast congre- 
gation of Israel, or in any of the Stakes, 
people whose names appear on the 
record that President Snow exhibited to 
us, I say it is to your interest to see 
to it that your names are taken from 
it, and that they appear, instead, in the 
book of the law of God, in order that, 
in due time, you may receive your eter- 
nal inheritance in the kingdom of God; 
which is my prayer in the name of 
Jesus. Amen. 

PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 

Importance of (he law of tithing — A source of rev- 
enue and a Means of distinguishing (he faithful 
from the unfaithful — None should be denied 
the privilege of obeying this law. 

My beloved brethren and sisters, I 
sincerely desire the presence and in- 
fluence of the good Spirit during the 
few moments that I shall stand before 
you. that I may be guided in my re- 
marks in wisdom, and that what may 
be said may be profitable. 

The subject that has been spoken of 
this morning is one of vital importance 
for the Church of Jesus Christ of Lat- 
ter-day Saints, not only to the body 



PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH.

of the Church, but to each individual 
member; for the law of tithing is a test 
by which the people as individuals shall 
be proven. Any man who fails to ob- 
serve this principle shall be known as 
a man who is indifferent to the wel- 
fare of Zion, who neglects his duty as 
a member of the Church, and who does 
nothing toward the accomplishment of 
the temporal advancement of the king- 
dom of God. He contributes nothing, 
either, towards the building of temples 
or maintaining them; he does nothing 
towards spreading the Gospel to the na- 
tions of the earth, and he neglects to do 
that which would entitle him to re- 
ceive the blessings and ordinances of 
the Gospel. Every member of the 
Church ought to possess that loyalty 
of feeling toward the cause that he 
would feel himself wronged if he were 
denied the privilege of contributing to 
the sustenance of the Church of Christ 
in the earth. The law of tithing is the 
law of revenue for the Church. There 
is no organization in the world having 
for its object the benefit of mankind, 
the building up of industries, or the 
protection of the rights of the people, 
but what must provide means with 
which to carry out these purposes. 

When the Lord restored the Gospel 
the spirit of gathering came with it. 
The Lord commanded the people to 
gather together, and that they should 
not only be organized as a 
Church, but that they should be 
organized under the laws of the land, so 
that they might not be helpless and de- 
pendent and without influence or power; 
but that by means of united effort and 
faith they should become a power for 
the accomplishment of righteousness in 
the earth (D. & C. Sec. 44; 4—5). In 
order that there might be means with 
which to accomplish every temporal 
good for the people, the Lord instituted 
this law of tithing in the place of the 
greater and more perfect law of Zion. 
The Lord revealed to his people in the 
incipiency of His work a law which was 
more perfect than the law of tithing. 
It comprehended larger things, greater 
power and a more speedy accomplish- 
ment of the purposes of the Lord. But 
the people were unprepared to live by 
it, and the Lord, out of mercy to the 
people, suspended the more perfect law, 



and gave the law of tithing, in order 
that there might be means in the store- 
house of the Lord for the carrying out 
of the purposes He had in view; for 
the gathering of the poor, for the 
spreading of the Gospel to the nations 
of the earth, for the maintenance of 
those who were required to give their 
constant attention, day in and day out, 
to the work of the Lord, and for whom 
it was necessary to make some pro- 
vision. Without this law these things 
could not be done, neither could Tem- 
ples be built and maintained, nor the 
poor fed and clothed. Therefore the 
law of tithing is necessary for the 
Church, so much so that the Lord has 
laid great stress upon it, as will be seen 
in these words: 

"And I say unto you, if my people 
observe not this law, to keep it holy, 
and by this law sanctify the land of 
Zion unto me, that my statutes and 
judgments may be kept thereon, that it 
may be most holy, behold, verily I say 
unto you, it shall not be a land of Zion 
unto you; 

'And this shall be an ensample unto 
all the Stakes of Zion. Even so. Amen." 

By this principle the loyalty of the 
people of this Church shall be put to 
the test. By this principle it shall be 
known who is for the kingdom of God 
and who is against it. By this 
principle it shall be seen whose 
hearts are set on doing the will of God 
and keeping His commandments, there- 
by sanctifying the land of Zion unto 
God, and who are opposed to this prin- 
ciple and have cut themselves off from 
the blessings of Zion. There is a great 
deal of importance connected with this 
principle, for by it it shall be known 
whether we are faithful or unfaithful. 
In this respect it is as essential as faith 
in God, as repentance of sin, as baptism 
for the remission of sin, or as the lay- 
ing on of hands for the gift of the Holy 
Ghost. For if a man keep all the law 
save in one point, and he offend in that, 
he is a. transgressor of the law, and he 
is not entitled to the fullness of the 
blessings of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. 
But when a man keeps all the law that 
is revealed, according to his strength, 
his substance and his ability, though 
what he does may be little, it is just 
as acceptable in the sight of God as 



4N

though he were able to do a thousand 
times more. 

While this matter of non-tithe-payers 
was beins talked over, I heard of a 
Bishop who refused to receive tithing 
from a person because that person was 
poor. I wondered what Bishop it was. 
What Bishop is there in the Church 
who would deny a woman, even though 
she was fed and clothed out of the 
tithings of the people, the privilege of 
having her name recorded in the books? 
I will read a few words out of the same 
revelation that Brother Clawson has 
read to us this morning: 

••It is contrary to the will and com- 
mandment of God, that those who re- 
ceive not their inheritance by consecra- 
tion, agreeably to this law, which He 
has given, that He may tithe His peo- 
ple, to prepare them against the day of 
vengeance and burning, should have 
their names enrolled with the people of 
God; 

"Neither is their genealogy to be kept, 
or to be had where it may be found on 
any of the records or history of the 
Church; 

"Their names shall not be found, 
neither the names of the fathers, nor 
the names of the children written in the 
book of the law of God, saith the Lord of 
hosts." 

Will you then deny the widow, be- 
cause she has only a mite to bestow? 
Because the tenth which she proposes 
to give in obedience to the command- 
ment of God is but a penny, are you 
going to deprive her of the privilege of 
having her name enrolled on the book 
:>f the law of the Lord, and of having 
her genealogy acknowledged and re- 
corded in the archives of the Church? 
And because her name is not found 
there, are you going to deny her the 
privileges of -the House of God and of 
the ordinances of the Gospel? I think 
it is time the Bishops understood this 
principle. The Bishop should encour- 
age every man, woman and child that 
earns and receives in return for his 
labor, to honor the Lord and to prove 
his obedience to the law of God by 
giving the one-tenth of that which he 
or she receives, as the Lord requires, 
so that they may have their names en- 
rolled on the book of the law of the 
Lord, that their genealogies may be 
had in the archives of the Church, and 
that they may be entitled to the priv- 



ileges and blessings of the house of 
God. 

I recollect most vividly a circum- 
stance that occurred in the days of 
my childhood. My mother was a wi- 
dow, with a large family to provide for. 
One spring when we opened our pota- 
to pits she had her boys get a load of 
the best potatoes, and she took them 
to the tithing office; potatoes were 
scarce that season. I was a little boy 
at the time, and drove the team. When 
we drove up to the steps of the tithing 
office, ready to unload the potatoes, one 
of the clerks came out and said to my 
mother, 'Widow Smith, it's a shame 
that you should have to pay tithing." 
He said a number of other things that 
I remember well, but they are not nec- 
essary for me to repeat here. The first 
two letters of the name of that tithing 
clerk was William Thompson, and hfe 
chided my mother for paying her tith- 
ing, called her anything but wise or 
prudent; and said there were 
others who were strong and 
able to work that were supported 
from the tithing office. My mother 
turned upon him and said: "William, 
you ought to be ashamed of yourself. 
Would you deny me a blessing? If I 
did not pay my tithing, I should expect 
the Lord to withhold His blessings from 
me. I pay my tithing, not only be- 
cause it is a law of God, but because I 
expect a blessing by doing it. By keep- 
ing this and other laws, I expect to 
prosper and to be able to provide for 
my family." Though she was a widow, 
you may turn to the records of the 
Church from the beginning unto the 
day of her death, and you will find 
that she never received a farthing from 
the Church to help her support herself 
and her famil-y; but she paid in thou- 
sands of dollars in wheat, potatoes, 
corn, vegetables, meat, etc. The tithes 
of her sheep and cattle, the tenth pound 
of her butter, her tenth chicken, the 
tenth of her eggs, the tenth pig, the 
tenth calf, the tenth colt — a tenth of 
everything she raised was paid. Here 
sits my brother, who can bear testi- 
mony to the truth of what I say, as can 
others who knew her. She prospered 
because she obeyed the laws of God. 
She had abundance to sustain her 
family. We never lacked so much as 



PRESIDENT JOSEPH F SMITH. 



many others did; for while we found 
nettle greens most acceptable when we 
first came to the valley; and while we 
enjoyed thistle roots, segoes and all that 
kind of thing, we were no worse off 
than thousands of others, and not so 
bad off as many, for we were never 
without corn-meal and milk or butter, 
to my knowledge. Then that widow 
had her name recorded in the book of 
the law of the Lord. That widow was 
entitled to the privileges of the house of 
God. No ordinance of the Gospel could 
be denied her, for she was obedient to 
the laws of God, and she would not fail 
in her duty when though discouraged 
from observing a commandment of God 
by one who was in an official position. 

This may be said to be per- 
sonal. By some it may be 
considered egotistical. But I do not 
speak of it in this light. When William 
Thompson told my mother that she 
ought not to pay tithing, I thought he 
was one of the finest fellows in the 
world. I believed every word he said. 
I had to work and dig and toil myself. 
I had to help plow the ground, plant the 
potatoes, hoe the potatoes, dig the pota- 
toes, and all that sort of thing, and 
then to load up a big wagon-box full of 
the very best we had, leaving out the 
poor ones, and bringing the load to the 
tithing office, I thought in my childish 
way that it looked a little hard, es- 
pecially when I saw certain of my play- 
mates and early associates of childhood, 
playing around, riding horses and hav- 
ing good times, and who scarcely ever 
did a lick of work in their lives, and yet 
were being fed from the public crib. 
Where are those boys today? Are they 
known in the Church? Are they prom- 
inent among the people of God? Are 
they or were they ever valiant in the 
testimony of Jesus Christ? Have they 
a clear testimony of the truth in their 
hearts? Are they diligent members of 
the Church? No, and never have been — 
as a rule — and most of them are dead 
or vanished out of sight. Well, after I 
got a few years of experience, I was 
converted, I found that my mother was 
right and that William Thompson was 
wrong. He denied the faith, aposta- 
tized, left the country and led away as 
many of his family as would go with 
him. I do not want you to deny me 



49 

the privilege of being numbered with 
those who have the interests of Zion at 
heart and who desire to contribute their 
proportion to the upbuilding of Zion 
and for the maintenance of the work of 
the Lord in the earth. It is a blessing 
that I enjoy, and I do not propose that 
anybody shall deprive me of that pleas- 
ure. 

This is the way I feel in relation to 
the principle of tithing. We must pro- 
vide revenue for the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints, and the- 
proper way to do it is by giving to the- 
Lord the one-tenth that he asks of us. 
Those who will do this, will receive the 
reward that he has promised. There 
is a promise of blessing attached 
to the observance of this law (Mai. 3: 
10 — 13.) If you will sanctify the land' 
of Zion unto the Lord through the 
observance of this law, it shall be a, 
land of Zion unto you. The Lord wilt 
bless the land and make it fruitful 
unto you, as He did the land of the 
children of Israel. In ancient times 
the Lord blessed the earth for those 
who observed the law of tithing (2 
Chron. 31: 5). This law was given to 
the children of Israel, and when they 
obeyed it they were prospered and 
had abundance; when they disobeyed 
it, they were afflicted with drough, with 
mildew, with rust, with the devouring 
insect, and they were impoverished and 
destroyed because they did not ob- 
serve the law. Now, it makes no dif- 
ference what happened to the ancients, 
or what the results may be to me. 
Though the Lord should try me by 
withholding His blessing from me and 
making me to drink to the very dregs 
the bitter cup of poverty, that should 
make no difference to me. The point is, 
what is the law of God? And if I know 
that law, it is my duty to obey it, 
though I suffer death in consequence. 
Many a man has gone to the stake in 
obedience, as he belteved, to the com- 
mandments of God. Not one of the 
ancient disciples who were chosen of 
Jesus Christ, escaped martyrdom, ex- 
cept Judas and John. Judas betrayed 
the Lord, and then sacrificed his own 
life; and John received the promise 
of the Lord that he should live until he 
came again to the earth. All the oth- 
ers were put to death, some crucified,.

some dragged in the streets of Rome, 
some thrown from pinnacles, and some 
stoned to death. What for? For obey- 
ing the law of God and bearing testi- 
mony to that which they knew to be 
true. So may it be today. But let the 
spirit of this Gospel be so imbedded in 
my soul that though I go through pov- 
erty, through tribulation, through per- 
secution, or to death, let me and my 
house serve God and keep His laws. 
However, the promise is that you 
shall be blessed through obedience. God 
will honor them that honor Him, and 
will remember them that remember 
Him. He will uphold and sustain all 
those who sustain truth and are faith- 
ful to it. God help us therefore to be 
faithful to the truth, now and forever, 
is my prayer in the name of Jesus, 
Amen. 

ELDER WM. H. SMART, 

president of the Eastern States mission, 
said: I take great pleasure in assem- 
bling with you in this conference and I 
am enjoying a spiritual feast, in lis- 
tening to the counsels that come to us 
from God through His Holy servants. 
The uppermost thought in my mind is 
that God has indited the counsels that 
have been given to us in our meetings 
thus far. I have been away from the 
body of the Church for two years, as 
a missionary to the Eastern States. 
While I have been absent when confer- 
ence time has rolled around my spirit 
has been here and I have longed to sit 
under the sanctuary and receive the 
word of God as it is given from time to 
time by His servants. I desire to bear 
my testimony to you, my co-laborers, 
" that God has inspired His Prophet in 
this day with regard to the law of tith- 
ing, and that this spirit is not only in 
Zion but that it has spread abroad into 
every part of the world where the 
Saints and Elders are living. A little 
less than a year • ago, after the word 
of the Lord had come through our 
Prophet with regard to this law of tith- 
ing, we caught up the spirit of it in the 
Eastern States mission. It electrified us. 
It was nothing but the power of God 
that did it. The spirit bore witness to 
us that that word was from God and 
that it was not of man. I do not feel 
that I have power to take up your val- 



uable time this morning, but I did want 
to bear this testimony unto you, and I 
do it in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 

ELDER E. H. NYE, 
president of the California mission: 
My brothers and sisters, it is a wonder- 
ful privilege to meet with you in this 
conference. It seems as though I am 
hardly able to control my feelings, I 
am so overcome with joy in meeting 
with the Saints of the Most High. The 
spirit that has prevailed throughout 
this conference thus far has been a joy 
to my soul. I thank the Lord my God 
and my brethren the Presidency that I 
have been permitted to come to Zion 
from the State of California, where I 
have been laboring for the last three 
years and a half as a missionary. This 
grand question of tithing has been with 
us, and I bear testimony with my 
brother, Elder Smart, who has just pre- 
ceded me, that the same spirit permeat- 
ed the hearts of the Saints throughout 
the State of California, so much so that 
they have come to the front, paid their 
tithes and their offerings and enabled 
us to carry on the mission in that part 
of the world. I rejoice in this and in 
the testimony that has been given and 
in the spirit that has actuated the ser- 
vants of God, who have spoken to us the 
words of life and salvation in these 
meetings. It seems to me that if we 
could comprehend the situation, every 
man and woman would rise in the 
strength of their manhood and 
womanhood and rejoice in the 
privilege of performing this won- 
derful work. We have in our own hands 
a key to the spiritual blessings of the 
Almighty. We meet together in our 
various wards and branches and par- 
take of the sacred emblems of the flesh 
and blood of our Lord and Master 
Jesus Christ. I am always impressed 
with the importance of that sacred or- 
dinance, for in that it seems to me we 
have a key to the spiritual blessings 
of the Almighty. Let me call your at- 
tention for a moment to what we do in 
partaking of that ordinance: 

"Witness unto thee. O God, the Eter- 
nal Father, that they are willing to take 
upon them the name of thy Son, and al- 
ways remember Him, and keep His 
commandments which he has given 
them."

What for? "That they may always 
have His spirit to be with them." Every 
time that we partake of that sacred 
ordinance we enter into a covenant 
with the Lord that we will keep the 
commandments He has given. What 
are the commandments? "Love one 
another," is one of them. "Thou shalt 
net lie," is another. And our brethren, 
the Presidency and the Twelve, have 
been impressing upon us in a most won- 
derful manner that there is a command- 
ment to pay our tithing. Now if we go 
to meeting, partake of this sacred or- 
dinance, enter into this covenant anew, 
and then ignore these commandments, 
do we not, my brethren and sisters, 
become covenant breakers before the 
Almighty? This is the way it strikes 
me. This ordinance is instituted that 
we may continually renew our obliga- 
tions unto the Lord, and the ordinance 
itself says what we do it for— that we 
may always have His spirit to be with 
us. Some of the brethren have quoted 
from the Book of Mormon. I 
will call attention to one pas- 
sage in it. On the occasion 
of our Lord and Master Jesus Christ 
visiting the people upon this continent, 
He called them to prayers. He prayed, 
and they prayed: 

"And they did pray for that which 
they most desired; and they desired 
that the Holy Ghost should be given 
unto them." 

And further on the Book of Mormon 
tells us, after enumerating the won- 
derful gifts and blessings that the Lord 
bestowed upon the people, that it was 
because the love of God did dwell in 
the hearts of the people. This is a key 
to the whole grand question. If we 
will keep the covenants that we make 
before the Almighty every time we par- 
take of this solemn ordinance, we shall 
come right up to the standard of per- 
fection that the brethren have been 
talking about, and that those old Ne- 
phite Saints arrived at when there was 
no wickedness of any kind among 
them, because the love of God did dwell 
in their midst, and the record declares 
that they were a most prosperous peo- 
ple in everything. Here is a lesson for 
us, if we can take it to ourselves. 

I rejoice in the great work as it is 
rolling along. In the law of tithing 



there is a key to the wealth and bless- 
ings of the earth; for the Lord makes 
a declaration that if we will pay our 
tithes and our offerings he will open the 
windows of heaven and pour forth such 
blessings as there shall not be room to 
receive. These things have been mani- 
fested time and time again in the Cali- 
fornia mission. I could enumerate in- 
stances where individuals through the 
payment of their tithes have received 
wonderful gifts and blessings; have 
been prospered in all that they set their 
hands to do, and have proved to their 
own satisfaction that the blessings of 
the Almighty do come unto them 
through obedience to this command. 
May God bless you. Amen. 

The choir and congregation sang: 

The Spirit of God like a fire is burning; 
The latter-day glory begins to come 
forth; 

The visions and blessings of old are re- 
turning, 

The angels are coming to visit the 
earth. 

Benediction by Elder Rulon S. Wells.

ELDER REED SMOOT, 

of the Council of the Twelve, said: 

"My dear brethren and sisters, I feel 
exceedingly weak in standing before 
this vast audience this afternoon. No 
doubt many of you are surprised at my 
being called to this position, but I can 
assure you that no one in this audience 
was more astonished than I. Five 
years ago I was called by the mouth- 
piece of God to occupy a position in the 
presidency of the Utah Stake. That was 
a surprise to me at that time and I 
thought then that the Lord moves in 
a mysterious way. This afternoon when 
the mouthpiece of the Lord told me it 
was the will of the Lord that I should 
occupy a position as one of the Twelve 
Apostles, I certainly felt a more humble 
and more weak instrument in his hands 
for doing good than ever I did in my 
life. I beg of the brethren of the 
Twelve to bear with me in my mistakes. 
I beseech of you, my brethren and sis- 
ters, to give me your faith and prayers 
for I need them, and to fulfill this posi- 
tion that I am called to, I must have 
them. If I can be humble and have the 
confidence of the people and of the 
Priesthood, as God has called me so will 
I receive it in the same spirit; and as 
He gives me wisdom and light and reve- 
lation, just so far can I do His will and 
serve Him in this calling. If I did not 
know that Jesus^ was the Christ and 
that the Church of Jesus Christ of Lat- 
ter-day Saints was His Church I can 
assure you that this calling that has 
been placed upon me would be the 
farthest from me to accept of any posi- 
tion that I could think of. 

My life in the past has been in a busi- 
ness direction more than in any other 
way, and now that this change has 
come and this call from God has been 
placed upon me, I hope and trust that 
I will do nothing — aye, I would rather 
lose my right arm than to betray the 



PRESIDENT GEORGE Q. CANNON.

confidence you have placed in me this 
day by voting for me in this position. 
My only desire is that God will give me 
power to perform the duties that shall 
devolve upon me acceptably in His 
sight, and acceptable to you, to the 
Apostles and to the mouthpiece of God 
upon this earth. To this end I beseech 
of you an interest in your faith and 
prayers that from now on I may be 
clothed with the Priesthood that will be 
some good to the children of men. 

I ask God's choicest blessings upon 
His Church and upon every member 
thereof, that unity, peace and strength 
may be with us continually until we 
become a light unto the whole world, 
as has been predicted. In the name of 
Jesus Christ I ask it. Amen. 

PRESIDENT GEORGE Q. CANNON. 

Future exaltation dependent upon obedience to 
law— Having kept our first estate, our present 
aim should be to keep well our second- 
Heavens filled with higher truths, which, as we 
progress, will be revealed. 

I arise, trusting that the remarks 
which I may be led to make may be in- 
spired by the Spirit of God. To this end 
I beseech you, my brethren and sisters, 
to give me the assistance of your faith 
and prayers, for I would like the time I 
occupy to be of profit to those who lis- 
ten. Time is precious, and this is a vast 
congregation, and they should not be 
kept here listening to something that is 
not of worth. I do not profess myself 
to be able to impart anything that is 
worthy of being listened to only as God 
shall give it through His Holy Spirit. 

I will read a few paragraphs of the 
88th section of the book of Doctrine and 
Covenants. 

"And again, verily I say unto you, 
the earth abideth the law of a celestial 
kingdom for it filleth the measure of its 
creation, and transgresseth not the law. 

'•Wherefore it shall be sanctified; yea, 
notwithstanding it shall die, it shall be 
quickened again, and shall abide the 
power by which it is quickened, and 
the righteous shall inherit it; 

"For notwithstanding they die, they 
also shall rise again a spiritual body; 
"They who are of a celestial spirit shall 
receive the same body which was a na- 
tural body, even ye shall receive your 
bodies, and your glory shall be that 
glory by which your bodies are quick- 
ened. 



"Ye who are quickened by a portion of 
the celestial glory shall then receive of 
the same, even a fulness; 

"And they who are quickened by a 
portion of the terrestrial glory, shall 
then receive of the same, even a full- 
ness: 

"And also they who are quickened by 
a portion of the telestial glory shall 
then receive of the same, even a full- 
ness; 

"And they who remain shall also 
be quickened; nevertheless they shall 
return again to their own place, to en- 
joy that which they are willing to re- 
ceive, because they were not willing to 
enjoy that which they might have re- 
ceived. 

"For what doth it profit a man if a 
gift is bestowed upon him, and he re- 
ceiveth not the gift? Behold he re- 
joices not in that which is given unto 
him, neither rejoices in Him who is 
the giver of the gift." 

I would like this next paragraph to be 
noticed by my hearers: 

"And again, verily, I say unto you, 
that which is governed by law is also 
preserved by law, and perfected and 
sanctified by the same. 

"That which breaketh a law, and abid- 
eth not by law, but seeketh to become 
a law unto itself, and willeth to abide 
in sin, and altogether abideth in sin, 
cannot be sanctified by law, neither by 
mercy, justice nor judgment. There- 
fore they must remain filthy still." 

There is to' my mind a great amount 
of importance in these words that I 
have read in your hearing, and they 
should be understood by us, because 
they pertain to our future exaltation. 
We have been taught by the Lord that 
this is a preparatory state, that we are 
here to be tested, to see whether we 
shall prove worthy of the promises that 
he has made unto his children. He 
has given unto all of us our free agency, 
and that agency is differently exercised. 
We see mankind divided into classes. 
Some exercise their agency in one direc- 
tion and some in another, and there is 
a great diversity of views and aims 
among the children of earth. But the 
Latter-day Saints have had revelation 
given to them, which places them, it 
may be said, in a position different to 
the rest of the world. We are not ig- 
norant of the purposes of God. We 
have been informed why we are here 
and what we should do to obtain the 
glory that God promises unto his faith- 
ful children. We have had pointed out 
to us the path to pursue <-o continue 
progression. 



51 



CEJSiERAL CONFERENCE. 



We all believe, I suppose, that we have 
kept our first estate, or we would not be 
here. The reward of our fidelity in our 
pre-existent state is manifest in the 
fact that we have received earthly tab- 
ernacles. We have taken a great step 
in advance by being permitted to come 
here. Now much depends upon our 
second estate and the manner in which 
we keep it. If we are faithful in our 
second estate, as we were in our first, 
then glory will be added to us, and we 
shall go on progressing eternally. 
Through the revelation of God's will 
and our observance of it, the oppor- 
tunitj" is given us to continue in the 
path of progress. The Lord has shown 
to us that there are differences of re- 
wards. Some of his children will at- 
tain to what is called celestial glory. 
Others of his children will not have 
faith enough nor exercise their agency 
in the direction to gain that glory; 
but they will gain terres- 
trial glory. There are others that will 
not progress that far; they will feel 
reluctant to obey the laws that pertain 
to the terrestrial, and they will ob- 
tain telestial glory. There are still 
others that will not attain even to the 
telestial glory. Why is it that there 
are these differences? Is it because 
God has chosen some of us for the teles- 
tial glory, some of us for the terres- 
trial glory, and some of us for the 
celestial glory? No, there is no such 
predestination as this. We are all 
born with our free agency; with the 
power within ourselves, aided by the 
blessing of God,to attain unto the high- 
est glory. How shall we attain unto 
the highest glory? There is only one 
way, and that is by observing the 
highest laws. The highest laws, when 
obeyed, bring as a reward the highest 
glory; and the man or woman who ex- 
pects to attain to the highest glory 
without obeying these laws, deceives 
himself or herself. It cannot be done. 
If I rise above the telestial glory, I 
must obey a law that will lift me above 
that. If I rise to the terrestrial glo- 
ry, it will be by obeying terrestrial 
law. If I do not obey laws higher than 
that, I cannot attain to a higher glory. 

I want to impress upon you, my 
brethren and sisters, that our exalta- 
tion, our future glory, depends entirely 



upon our obedience to law. We should 
not lose sight of this. A man will 
come along and say, "I believe in Je- 
sus; I am willing to repent of my sins; 
I want to be baptized for the remis- 
sions of my sins and I want to receive 
the laying on of hands and become 
a member of the Church." He obeys 
these requirements and ordinances. He 
then says, "I hear the Elders talk about 
gathering, and I do not see any 
necessity for it. I do not see why 
I cannot worship God in the 
place where I embraced the 
Gospel, as well as if I were 
to gather. I hear a good 
deal about Zion. Some of the Elders 
tell me what a glorious condition of 
existence there is there, while others 
say there are many evils in Zion, and I 
don't think I will gather there." Will 
that man attain unto celestial glory? I 
leave this question with you to answer. 
How can he? It is necessary that he 
should gather. Why? Because it is a 
command of God that His Saints shall 
gather, and a man cannot receive the 
reward of gathering without he obeys 
the law of God on that subject. There 
are many reasons for this, with which 
you are all familiar. In the first place 
he cannot receive his endowments. Can 
a man attain unto celestial glory with- 
out receiving his endowments? Under 
some circumstances he can. If he 
should die, as some of our faithful 
brethren have, before endowments were 
given, no doubt he would be judged by 
the Lord according to his opportunities 
and his willingness. But speaking gen- 
erally, men and women cannot receive 
celestial glory without having the ordi- 
nances that pertain to the endowments. 
Men and women cannot be united for 
eternity unless- they are united by the 
Priesthood of God in the place appoint- 
ed for the administration of that 
ordinance. The union of husband and 
wife, of parents and children depends 
upon obedience to law, and they cannot 
get into the celestial kingdom without 
they obey these laws. Other command- 
ments of the Lord might be mentioned 
in this connection. We are command- 
ed to live by every word that pro- 
ceedeth from the mouth of God. We 
must do this. The Lord reveals His 
word to His Church; that word must

be obeyed, if we expect to reach the 
celestial glory. Besides these precious 
records that we have— the Bible, the 
Book of Mormon, the Book of Doctrine 
and Covenants and the Pearl of Great 
Price— there must be some other power 
among the people of God. These books 
alone will never save this people. I ex- 
pect some of you may be shocked at 
this statement. It is neverthe- 
less true. All these works, 
divine as they are, pure as they are, 
cannot save this people. There must 
be something else; and God has placed 
in His Church the living oracles, to 
guide and govern the Church. We know 
by experience that unless we had had 
the living oracles, Ave would have been 
in the worst possible position. For 
instance, where is there a command- 
ment given concerning the migration 
of the Latter-day Saints to the valleys 
of the mountains. Of course, the 
Prophet Joseph prophesied concerning 
it, but there was no command given. 
The Lord, however, through His living 
oracles, revealed to the Church His 
will concerning it, and under the lead- 
ership of the living oracles the Church 
came to these valleys. Almost every 
day we are doing acts under the direc- 
tion of the living oracles which are es- 
sentially necessary for the people of 
God, but which are not commanded in 
any of these books. There is nothing 
foreshadowed in the records concerning 
many acts that are performed from 
time to time by the direction of the 
Lord through his living oracles. He 
has placed them in the Church to guide 
the Church. This book (pointing to 
the book of Doctrine and Covenants), 
divine as it is, is insufficient. It re- 
veals certain things, but does it reveal 
the polity of the work? Does it reveal 
the mind and will of God concerning 
His Church? Only so far as it goes. 
There must be a stream of living revel- 
ation flowing from God to His servants 
whom He has placed to preside over 
His Church. It was needed this after- 
noon to fill up the Quorum of the 
Twelve. We had to know the mind and 
will of the Lord concerning that im- 
portant thing. Is there anything in 
any of these books which says that 
George Q. Cannon should be an Apostle, 
or Joseph F. Smith, or any of these 



men who are Apostles? Not a word.. 
How is this determined then? It 
comes through the living oracles, the 
authority that God has placed in His 
Church to govern and dictate. 
Of course, these books, as I have 
said, are of inestimable value to us 
as a people, because they contain the 
word of God. And that which is written 
agrees with that which is unwritten. 
There is no clash; there never will be„ 
because they come from the same 
source. They are both true, and there 
is no conflict between two truths. That 
is our position. 

I think it is of great importance to us 
as a people to know what we shall do. 
Are we content to aim for telestial 
glory. I never heard a prayer offered, 
especially in the family circle, in which 
the family does not beseech God to give 
them celestial glory. Telestial glory 
is not in their thoughts. Terrestrial 
glory may be all right for honorable 
Gentiles, who have not faith enough to 
believe the Gospel and who do right 
according to the best knowledge they 
have; but celestial glory is our aim — I 
perhaps should not say it is the aim, 
for sometimes it is not, but it is the 
hope. If into a family that had 
just offered prayer, and had 
asked God to lead them into 
the celestial kingdom, an angel 
should enter and should say to them 
that their prayers were useless and that 
they would never attain unto celestial 
glory, what a feeling would be produced 
in the breasts of that family! How sor- 
rowful and afflicted they would feel! 
Yet, as I have said, while it is the aim 
of many, they do not act as if it were 
their true aim. They either misconceive 
the nature of the duties they have to 
perform to attain to celestial glory, or 
else they are very blind indeed. 

I ask again, what is your aim, or my 
aim? What do I desire? If I desire 
celestial glory, the highest law that God 
has revealed I will be willing to obey, 
and to observe every word that pro- 
ceedeth from His mouth. I do not want 
to speak of myself, but if there is a law 
that God has revealed and it is neces- 
sary to be obej'ed befoi'e celestial glory 
can be reached, I want to 
know it and obey it. All that 



56 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



I am this earth for 

is to get celestial glory. I do not want 
my second estate to be a failure. I 
want to keep it as valiantly and as 
correctly as I hope I did my first es- 
tate. I believe with all my heart that 
I kept my first estate. I believe that 
Satan, with all his blandishments and 
sophistry, had not the power to induce 
me to follow him. Now I am here on 
the earth, and God has revealed to me 
why I am here. He wants me to be 
true to Him in the midst of these trials 
and temptations, and in the midst of 
the darkness that prevails. He wants 
me to be unswerving in my integrity 
and in the keeping of His laws. He 
wants me to come back to Him as His 
loyal, faithful, obedient child. He not 
only wants me to do this, but He wants 
all of us to do so; to say to Satan, We 
will not be deceived by you, but we 
will endure all things for the sake of 
our Father and the glory that He has 
in store for us. This is my desire; 
and it is your desire, when you are 
aroused. You have shown it as far as 
you have gone. But something comes 
along that you hesitate about, and you 
say in effect, "that law is a little too 
high for me, my faith is not sufficient 
to obey it." We heard Brother Claw- 
son this morning repeat the expres- 
sions of some concerning the law of 
tithing, and those expressions illustrate 
what I am now dwelling upon. A 
commandment has been given, a law 
has been proclaimed, and some have 
not seen the necessity of obeying it. 
They seem to be content with what 
they have done. Brethren and sisters, 
when you know that your eternal exal- 
tation depends upon obeying ' law, 
will you hesitate and say "I have not 
faith enough for that; it's too high for 
me; it requires too great a sacrifice on 
my part, and I cannot receive it; the 
laws of the terrestrial kingdom are 
more suited to my faith and my de- 
sires, and I am willing to be content 
with that glory." Will you, I repeat, 
hesitate in rendering obedience, and 
argue thus to yourselves? 

I want to bring this home to your 
minds this afternoon, my brethren and 
sisters. Personally I have never 
felt to say what I would do in 
the midst of trial. I have heard 



brethren talk about their willingness 
to lay down their lives for this Gospel; 
but I have always been afraid to say 
much about this on my part, for fear if 
I should be put to the test I might not 
be able to stand it. At the same time 
the desire in my heart, although I may 
not express it, is to do everything that 
God requires at my hands. I would 
like to be valiant enough to die if the 
time ever came that I had to die for it. 
God help me at such an hour. I never 
yet have shrunk nor had fear in this 
respect; but I do not know how soon 
I may, for I am a poor human being. 
But I rejoice in the Gospel, and I feel 
that if there is anything of earth that 
the Lord has given me control of, I 
would like to put it where He wants it. 
I want to help forward His work in 
every possible way, not only by my 
means and my ability, but by whatever 
I have; for I want celestial glory. I 
crave that with all my heart. I feel as 
though, with God's help, I would make 
any sacrifice to obtain it, and obey any 
law, be it ever so high, so far revealed. 

We have not got all yet. I expect 
higher laws will be revealed to us as 
we ascend nearer and nearer to our 
Father in heaven. Therefore we should 
prepare ourselves for this, and as fast 
as we can be willing to obey the laws 
that God reveals to us. You have heard 
during this conference considerable on 
the subject of tithing. In one sense it 
is a small matter to pay tithing. I con- 
sider it like the A. B. C. of the Gospel. 
The promises concerning it are great, 
and it is such an easy matter to give 
one-tenth of all we have. Then why is 
it dwelt upon so much during this con- 
ference? Because this people called 
Latter-day Saints are default- 
ers, because they have utterly failed in 
keeping this law. It is just as neces- 
sary that we should warn you about 
tithing as it would be to warn you 
about the necessity of th'e laying on of 
hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost, if 
you had not received that ordinance. If 
this congregation had gone as far as 
baptism and then had settled down and 
not desired the laying on of hands, we 
would preach to you with all our might, 
and impress upon you the importance of 
being obedient to that ordinance. And 
you would not be surprised at that. If

you heard us talking- to people who 
were in that condition, you would say 
that we were doing perfectly right in 
impressing them with the solemnity of 
the holy ordinance of laying on of 
hands, for they could not have the Holy 
Ghost without it. Now what shall be 
said of tithing? I say to you that in 
your non-payment of tithing you have 
stopped your progress and you have 
disobeyed a command of God just as 
much as if you had refused, after you 
had been baptized, to have hands laid 
upon you; just as much as you would 
have done, after having received the 
Gospel, had you refused to gather to 
Zion; just as much as you would if you 
came to Zion and refused to go into the 
Temple and have saving ordinances ad- 
ministered to you there, such as the 
ordinance of marriage for time and 
eternity and other things. You may or 
may not think as I do, but I know I 
have taken the correct position in this 
matter. Here we have had the word of 
God through the Prophet Joseph for 
sixty-two years, and here President 
Snow, the man who now stands at the 
head, comes forward and tells the 
the Church that they are defaulters in 
this thing, that they have not obeyed 
this commandment, and that God re- 
quires obedience to it. Not only so, but 
he tells us that we are in danger of be- 
ing scourged of the Lord for this dis- 
obedience. I believe it with all my 
heart. I believe that this con- 
sequence will follow our neglect, 
and that the anger of God 
will be kindled against the people, un- 
less they obey this law. It is in our 
path of progress, and is to be obeyed, 
not evaded and taken advantage of. 
Men will take advantage of this law 
in many ways. They will pay a tithing 
that is not true. They will not do as 
Brother Joseph F. Smith said this 
morning his mother did, pick out the 
best; but they will pick out something 
that is practically worthless, as though 
they were making a bargain with a 
hard man and glad to get the advantage 
of him. That is not the spirit of tithing. 
No blessing will attend the payment of 
tithing under such circumstances. Men 
must feel that they are doing this to 
comply with the law of God, and that 
for complying with this law they will 
be rewarded. 



I hope that the Saints will take this 
view of this law and understand us 
aright. What do I care, what does 
President Snow care, what do any of us 
care, whether you pay money or not? 
We are able to live without getting 
anything from you. I thank God that 
this is the condition of most of us, and 
that we can live without being a bur- 
den to the people, and at the same time 
do our share in helping the work along. 
It is not for this that we talk like we 
do, but it is because of the importance 
of it to you, so that you may carry this 
out in your lives, and then get faith 
enough to do something higher. It 
has required faith to obey some 
laws that have been revealed 
in the past, and it will require 
faith to obey other laws that will yet 
be revealed. The heavens are full of 
truth and of everything that is good 
and noble, and many things are re- 
vealed to the servants of God which 
they are commanded not to reveal to 
the people. Why? Because it would 
try their faith. Joseph had things re- 
vealed to him that he did not make 
known. I heard him once say on the 
stand, that if he were to tell what the 
Lord had told him, there were certain 
persons, and he mentioned their names 
one of whom was an Apostle, 
that would go around the streets 
of Nauvoo seeking his life. I was a boy 
at that time and I wondered what it 
could possibly be that would prompt 
those men, one of them especially, to 
do such a thing. But there are things 
which God reveals pertaining to the 
celestial glory and to the higher worlds 
that the people are not yet prepared to 
receive. We will all have to grow in 
faith before these things can be made 
known. Paul, we are told, saw things 
that were unutterable. When the Lord 
visited the Nephites they had things 
shown to them and their little children 
spoke things which could not be writ- 
ten. So it is now. The heavens are full 
of knowledge. To God in his exalted 
condition, dwelling in the midst of eter- 
nal burnings, surrounded by concourses 
of holy angels, we are by comparison 
almost insects in his presence. But we 
are his children. We have within us 
the elements of Deity in their inchoate 
state, to be developed as time passes on 
and as we obey the laws of God. We

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



think we have taken a great stride 
when we have obeyed baptism and had 
hands laid upon us and received the 
Holy Ghost. We think, Oh! what a 
wonderful thing has come to us! Well, 
it is wonderful. But, my brethren and 
sisters, that is just the beginning of 
what there is in the future. The 
heavens are full of light and intelli- 
gence, and a little of it has been com- 
municated to us. 

We should live so as to keep in this 
path of progress, and not stop at tith- 
ing, feeling that that is too great an 
obstacle to get over, and therefore cease 
to progress. If you do, your faith will 
wither, the Spirit of God will withdraw 
from you, and you will be in the dark; 
and in the resurrection, as I have read, 
you will be quickened by that spirit a 
portion of which you have had here. If 
you have had only a portion of the ter- 
restrial spirit, you will get a fullness of 
it there. So with the telestial, and so 
with the celestial. You are all going to 
be resurrected. The earth is going to 
be resurrected. It will die; but it will 



be quickened again, and it will be ce- 
lestialized and glorified, as we will be. 
We ought to be numbered among the 
church of the first-born. I pray God 
that this may be our happy lot; that 
we all may live so that we shall be 
counted among the members of the ' 
church of the first-born, and that we 
shall receive a fullnes of celestial glory; 
which I humbly ask, in the name of 
Jesus. Amen. 

The choir sang the anthem: 

Heavenly Father we would worship 
thy Great Name this Hallowed Day. 

The solo parts were rendered by Sis- 
ters Lizzie Thomas Edward and Mabel 
Cooper. 

Benediction was pronounced by Elder 
Francis M. Lyman. 

Conference then adjourned for six 
months. 

The stenographic work in taking an 
account of the nroceedings of the Con- 
ference was done by Arthur Winter.

DESERET SUNDAY SCHOOL UNION. 



Its Semi-Annual General Conference. 



The general annual conference of the 
Sunday schools of the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints was held 
at the Tabernacle, Salt Lake City, Sun- 
day evening, April 8, 1900, at 7 o'clock. 
There were present of the general su- 
perintendency, George Q. Cannon and 
Karl G. Maeser, most of the members of 
the Deseret Sunday School Union 
Board, and aids, several of the Apos- 
tles, and many Stake superintendents, 
ward officers, and Sunday school work- 
ers. The conference was opened by the 
Tabernacle choir and congregation sing- 
ing, "Do What is Right." 

Prayer was offered by Elder George 
Teasdale. 

The choir sang, "Prayer is the Soul's 
sincere desire," 

General Secretary Horace S. Ensign 
called the roll, which was responded to 
by thirty-four Stakes. 

The secretary then read the annual 
financial and statistical report for year 
ending December 31st, 1899. After which 
he presented the general Sunday school 
authorities, and they were sustained as 
follows: Geo. Q. Cannon, general su- 
perintendent Karl G. Maeser, second 
assistant general superintendant; Hor- 
ace S. Ensign, general secretary; 
George Reynolds, general treasurer; Leo 
Hunsaker, assistant general secretary 
and stenographer. 

As members of the Deseret Sunday 
School Union board: George Q. Cannon, 
Karl G. Maeser, George Reynolds, 
Thomas C. Griggs, Joseph W. Summer- 
hays, Levi W. Richards, Francis M. 
Lyman, Heber J. Grant, Joseph M. Tan- 
ner, George Teasdale. Hugh J. Cannon, 
Andrew Kimball, Joseph P. Smith and 
John W. Taylor. 

As aids to the board: L. John Nut- 
tall. James W. Ure, John F. Bennett, 
John M. Mills,, W. B. Dougall, Wm. D. 



Owen, Jr., Seymour B. Young and Geo. 
D. Pyper. 

General Treasurer George Reynolds 
made a report of the nickel fund do- 
nation received during the last four 
years. 

A kindergarten class of eight little 
girls from the Eleventh ward, under the 
direction of Sister Louie B. Pelt, sang 
two selections very sweetly, which were 
greatly enjoyed by the audience. 

GENERAL SUPERINTENDENT GEO. 
Q. CANNON. 

From our statistical report it is seen 
that we number nearly 120,000, 
in the aggregate, but if we 
had all the reports in from 
the various schools there would 
be upwards of 121,000. The interest in 
the Sundav schools is growing. Every 
meeting that we have of this character 
shows the importance, the growing im- 
portance, of this institution among the 
people, and it is bearing abundant 
fruit. There are a great many reasons 
why we should be zealous in this di- 
rection. The reports that come to us 
from the presidents of missions con- 
cerning the ignorance of some of our 
young men who are sent out to help 
them ought to stir us all up to diligence 
in imparting a knowledge of our prin- 
ciples to the rising generation. There is 
a great field, notwithstanding we have 
labored for so manv vears in this di- 
rection, there is a great need that the 
children, the young people of this com- 
munity, be instructed thoroughly in the 
principles of our religion. I feel to con- 
gratulate you on your labors, and I can 
say truly that there is much cause to 
rejoice in what has been done. The 
publications of the Sunday School 
Union are of such a character as to be 
of great benefit. I wish to call attention, 
particularly, to the Leaflets. I do not 



60 



DESERET SUNDAY SCHOOL ONION. 



think there has been any publications 
in our Church that have exceeded in 
value the Leaflets as they have been 
issued from time to time by the Union. 
I think they are invaluable. I would 
like all the superintendents and teach- 
ers to take every pains in their power to 
have these Leaflets thoroughly studied 
and mastered by the young people. 

I do not wish to trespass upon your 
time, as there are many items of busi- 
ness that have to be attended to, but I 
say as I have said before, God bless you 
in your labors and give you great suc- 
cess and great joy in continuing your 
labor in this direction. I ask it in the 
name of Jesus. Amen. 

SECOND ASSISTANT SUPERIN- 
TENDENT KARL G. MAESER. 

The use of the Children's Sunday 
School Hymn Book. 

The Sunday school superintendents 
at the Stake Sunday school conferences 
sometimes report that the Sunday 
school hymn books are left at home by 
the children and have gradually gone 
out of use in their Sunday shools. Now, 
the Sunday School Union Board has 
spent considerable means in distribut- 
ing these hymn books amongst the 
schools. A great many thousands, 
included in several editions have been 
published. Why has this been done? 
There is a principle involved in the use 
of these hymn books to which I wish 
to call your attention. Look over the 
congregations of the Latter-day Saints 
in their public meetings and you will 
perhaps see some old brother or sister 
using the standard hymn books of the 
Church and following the choir in the 
singing, but by far the great majority 
of the congregation have no hymn 
books with them, and cannot, therefore, 
understand the words which the choir 
are singing. This is all wrong. Sing- 
ing is a part of the prayer— pleasing in 
the sight of our Heavenly Father. 
When there is a prayer being offered 
to my Heavenly Father, I for one al- 
ways want to share in it; I want to be 
counted in that prayer, whether it is of- 
fered on the stand by one of the 
brethren or whether it be in the form 
of a song. How can this be possible 
if I do not understand the words that 
are being sung? Well, I always have 



my book with me and follow the choir 
in the singing. Now, this is the point: 
We older Latter-day Saints have got 
into the habit of going to meeting with 
our hymn books, and we are going to 
endeavor to get the rising generation 
into the habit of going to meeting with 
their hymn books, and, in order to do 
this, we must train them in our Sun- 
day schools. Sunday school superin- 
tendents have come to me and said, 
"Well, brother Maeser, that is all very 
well, but how is it to be accomplished? 
We have talked, and talked and talked, 
but it has done no apparent good. What 
course would you advise us to pursue?" 
I have advised them as follows: "My 
brethren and sisters, if I were a 
Sunday school teacher and had been as - 
signed by the superintendent to take 
charge of a certain department, and I 
had found since my appointment that 
the children in my department were not 
in the habit of bringing their hymn 
books with them. I would say, "My 
dear pupils, I am going to ask you a 
question, and that question is, 
which of you have a hymn book' 
with you? Hold it up and let me see it. 
That is all. I am going to ask you this 
question again next Sunday. If any of 
you have a hymn book bring it along 
and let me see it." Next Sunday comes. 
I have sixty pupils in my department. 
My question comes. "What question did 
I say I would ask you today?" Some 
one says, "You was going to ask who 
had a hymn book." "Well, how many 
of you have them?" Four children have 
hymn books and are able to hold them 
up; the other fifty-six have none. I 
would not find fault or scold, or make 
any discouraging remark, but I would 
thank and bless these four. "Now next 
Sunday I shaH ask you this same ques- 
tion again. You four will please bring 
your hymn books, and if the rest of you 
will do so I will be obliged." Next Sun- 
day comes. "How many of you have 
hymn books with you today?" Seven. 
I have gained three now. I would con- 
tinue this from one Sunday to another. 
I have got eleven perhaps the next 
Sunday, then seventeen, and so on, un- 
til three or four months have passed. 
Never occupy too much time in asking 
these questions, only about two min- 
utes, no longer. After three or four

months there are just five boys with- 
out hymn books, now I will suppose 
myself one of these five boys. The oth- 
er fifty-five have their books, I cannot 
stand this any longer; I am getting 
ashamed of myself. All are beginning to 
hold up their hymn books but me and 
the other four. I cannot stand it. I 
go home and ask my father to give me 
ten cents with which to buy a hymn 
book. I get one and hold it up next 
Sunday with the rest, and then there 
are only four now without books. My 
brethren and sisters, it is not hard to 
do this, but we must persevere; we 
must never leave off asking this ques- 
tion. Neither must we think that our 
labor ends when all bring their hymn 
books, if we do the scholars will be- 
come discouraged that no one takes 
any notice of their books, and they will, 
by and by, leave their hymn books at 
home again. Before the year is ended 
we are in the same fix — the children 
have no books with them. We have to 
keep constantly at it. The children 
are as full of human nature as we are. 
They must be noticed, and they 
need some encouragement. We Sunday 
school workers, the grown up men 
and women, like a little encouragement 
in our labors, once in a while. So do 
the children. They must be noticed and 
encouraged in their work as much as we 
older ones. God bless you all is my 
prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 

ELDER HEBER J. GRANT. 

We find on the 137th page in the Doc- 
trine and Covenants, the following: 

"For my soul delighteth in the song of 
the heart, yea, the song of the righteous 
is a prayer unto me, and it shall be 
answered with a blessing upon their 
heads." 

I have, all the days of my life, en- 
joyed sinking very much. When I was 
a little boy ten years of age I joined 
a singing class, and the professor told 
me that I could never learn to sing. 
Some years ago I had my character 
read by a phrenologist and he told me 
that I could sing, but he said he would 
like to be fortv miles away while I 
was doing it. (Laughter.) I was prac- 
ticing singing a few weeks ago in the 
Templeton building-, and the room 



where I was doing so was next to that 
of a dentist. The people in the hall de- 
cided that some one was having his 
teeth extracted. (Laughter.) When I 
was a little boy Sister Eliza R. Snow 
exercised the gift of tongues, and the 
interpretation was given by Sister Zina 
D. Young; and therein I was promised 
that I should be chosen to be one of 
the leaders of the Church, and I stand 
here tonight in fulfillment of that pre- 
diction. All the days of my life I have 
tried to sing "O My Father," written 
by Sister Eliza R. Snow. When I was 
a child, next to my own mother, no 
woman that ever lived took as much in- 
terest in me, gave me as much mother- 
ly advice or seemed to love me more 
than did Sister Snow. I loved her with 
all my heart, and loved her hymn, "O 
My Father." I remarked some four 
months ago to Brother Horace S. En- 
sign that I would be willing to spend 
four or five months of my spare time 
if I could only iearn to sing that one 
hymn. He told me that any one could 
learn to sing that had perseverance. I 
said to him if there was anything that 
I had it was perseverance. So I sug- 
gested that we sit down and I would 
take my first lesson of two hours on that 
song. I have been continuing the les- 
sons on it ever since. (Laughter.) I 
have sung it as high as 115 times in one 
day. I have practiced on the "Doxolo- 
gy" between three and four hundred 
times, and there are only four lines, and I 
cannot sing it yet. (Laughter.) I 
traveled from Holbrook, Arizona, to St. 
John, with Brothers Clawson and Kim- 
ball, some months ago, and I sang one 
hundred times that day and gave them 
nervous prostration. (Laughter.) Now 
I tried to sing "O My Father" at Snow- 
flake, Arizona, and I only got as far as 
the "O," and I did not get that right. 
(Laughter.) I have been delighted to- 
night with the songs of these little chil- 
dren, and I am delighted with the sing- 
ing that we have in our Sunday schools. 
A few months before Brother Goddard 
died I asked him to let me copy the 
songs contained in his song book, and I 
told him that, though I could not sing, 
yet I would read them to the children 
and would perpetuate his memory by 
reading these songs. He made some 
excuse at the time, but shortly before 



62 



DESERE T SUNDA Y SCHOOL UN 10 JV. 



he died he presented me with a copy 
of his song book, written in his own 
hand-writing. I prize it more highly 
than money. I would not exchange it 
for its weight in gold. I intended to 
fulfil my promise, but when I learned, 
after five or six weeks of hard study, 
and after singing one hymn thousands 
of times, to sing a little I decided not 
to read these songs to the children, but 
to learn to sing them in the Sabbath 
schools. Professor Heber S. Goddard 
is now teaching me to sing, "Who's on 
the Lord's side, Who?" I do not know 
how many months it will take him, but 
I propose to learn it some day, whether 
it takes six months or six years. 
(Laughter.) When I do, if I get the op- 
portunity, I will sing it here. I make 
these remarks because I feel that we 
ought to encourage our young people to 
learn to sing. From the standpoint of 
a singer, I have lost thirty-three years 
of my life. I was told, when ten years 
old that I could never learn to sing. I 
did not learn until forty-three years of 
age, and I have spent four or five 
months trying to learn to sing the 
hymns, "God moves in a mysterious 
way," and "O My Father." I have 
learned one because of the sentiments 
and my love for the author, and the 
other because the late President Wil- 
ford Woodruff loved it better than any 
other hymn in the hymn book. Now all 
singers say it is a mistake to speak be- 
fore you sing, and therefore if I do not 
sing very well it is because I spoke 
first. (Laughter.) 

Brother Grant here sang two stanzas 
of "O My Father." 

Now, when Brother Goddard used to 
sing, when he got off he would try 
again. I have sung this two or 
three times with Brother Ensign, 
and I know that I am not singing it 
right; I have not pitched it right. 
Brother Goddard would try sometimes 
half a dozen times to pitch a song. I 
think I had better try and get this in 
a different key. (Laughter). 

Brother Grant then sang the conclud- 
ing stanzas. (In the same key.) 

Now I expect many of you would 
like to take a trip of thirty or forty 
miles when you leave here. (Laugh- 
ter) . Now some people will say Brother 
Grant has made an exhibition of him- 



self by singing here. I have but one 
object tonight in speaking and singing, 
and that is to encourage the young men 
and young ladies not to waste thirty 
or forty years of their lives before un- 
dertaking to sing. if i had told the 
congregation that I had learned to sing 
and had not tried they would not have 
believed it; and many do not believe it 
now. (Laughter.) But the fact re- 
mains that by continued effort one can 
learn to sing that has no knowledge 
of music whatever, as was the case 
with me. I did not know one note 
from another, and could barely distin- 
guish one tune from another. When 
I first began to learn to sing this song 
("O My Father") I would get off on 
nearly every line, and did not know it. 
I have learned to know when I am off. 
I have been off two or three times to- 
night. (Laughter). I have been 
troubled this evening with stage fright 
and have been very nervous. I have 
sung this song at least twenty times 
in this building. Brother Ensign has 
been behind me to help me tonight. 
Probably next time I will not have this 
stage fright. 

I want to repeat to the superintend- 
ents and teachers that the Lord says 
"the song of the heart" is a prayer to 
Him and that it shall be answered with 
a blessing upon our heads. I have a 
song in my home every morning, since 
I learned to sing, and I feel that it is a 
nice part of the family worship, and I 
feel that we can increase the capacity 
of our children to sing and to praise 
the Lord in the songs of Zion, if we will 
only teach them to sing over and over 
again. May the Lord bless you, I ask 
it in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

DR. J. M. TANNER. 

"All Sunday School lessons should 
have a bearing on the Gospel or its 
principles. 

We are engaged in the instruction of 
something like one hundred thousand 
children. When the population of the 
Latter-day Saints is taken into consid- 
eration, this is unquestionably the 
largest organization of children in the 
world, and our Sabbath school has its 
distinct objects, and, among the aims of 
our labors is the cultivation of the 
faith of the Latter-day Saints among 



DESERE1 SUNDAY SCHOOL UNION.

our children. It is our aim to teach 
them the principles of the Gospel as we 
have learned them, and to make of 
them followers of our Lord and Savior 
Jesus Christ, and to inculcate a love of 
that religion as it has been taught to 
us and as we understand it. It is 
therefore desirable that all of our Sun- 
day school lessons should have some di- 
rect bearing upon our faith. They 
should have those distinct qualities and 
characteristics that impress upon the 
little ones the thoughts and feelings 
associated with the religion of their 
parents. For that reason pamphlets 
have been prepared, courses of studies 
have been mapped out and instructions 
have been given in the methods of pre- 
sentation, and yet there is found, very 
frequently, a disposition to make this 
work in the Sunday schools purely an 
argumentative work, and it would be 
oftimes very difficult to discern any 
difference in the qualities of those les- 
sons as taught by us and those taught 
by other denominations in the world. 
It is distinctly our aim and purpose 
then, to give a direct quality and bear- 
ing to this work and make the lessons 
correspond with the spirit of the faith 
which we have. Naturally enough, 
therefore, we should adopt those means 
that will best aid us in this direction. 
We want to know, then, how to pre- 
sent a lesson from a "Mormon" point 
of view. We want to know how to give 
these lessons a direct application to our 
faith, and that is the object of my re- 
marks tonight. I cannot enter into the 
details, as time will not permit, but I 
can mention two means by which this 
may be brought about. The first, and 
perhaps most important one is that we 
understand at the outset that the pur- 
pose of religion, the purpose of teach- 
ing religion, is that our children may be 
taught to feel as well as to think; for 
religion is not a system of philosophy, 
however much scientists or revolution- 
ists may desire to reduce it to a scien- 
tific basis. Religion is the Gospel of 
correct living, thinking and feeling, of 
correct lives, if you please, including 
all that we are, including our feelings 
as well as our thoughts, and for that 
reason we ought to be instructed how 
to think correctly and how to feel 
correctly. It is particularly the duty of 



the Sabbath school teacher to rouse 
within the hearts of his children those 
intense feelings that are engendered by 
a strong conviction of the truth of the 
work as he has received a testimony of 
it. And how we can teach the children 
to feel— to feel as we feel? In the first 
place we. must have strong convictions 
ourselves, and we must be intensely in- 
terested. It must be a work of love 
and come from the heart. It must be 
with ourselves a question of correct 
living, and above all things we must 
be pure in heart, pure in our thoughts 
and undefiled in our feelings, constant- 
ly, within ourselves, dedicating our lives 
to God and to His work. The Sabbath 
school teacher has to deal with child- 
ren who are pure, who are pure from 
their infancy, whose lives have not been 
contaminated with the ways of the 
world, and he should be a man, or she 
should be a woman, qualified in every 
respect to come in contact with the pur- 
ity of youth, and for that reason there 
should be a constant effort on our part 
to so conduct our thoughts and feelings 
that they shall be pure and sanctified 
before God. Therein lies our safety; 
therein lies our success. Every man 
carries with him a certain influence. 
There is within his character those 
qualities that make up his general dis- 
position. We cannot always define that 
influence, but we know that every man 
carries with him an influence coming 
from his own individuality, and that in- 
dividuality comes from his own 
thoughts and feelings. Those subjects 
upon which his thoughts dwell are the 
subjects that reach, through the influ- 
ence of our presence, the feelings of 
others. Hence the necessity of correct 
living. If there is a Sabbath school 
teacher that is not constantly striving 
to better his life, to purify his thoughts 
and feelings, he is not fitted for the sub- 
lime work of a teacher in the Sabbath 
school. For that reason, therefore, we 
should constantly keep before us the 
thought, the idea, that we are directing 
the feelings of the children, and that 
convictions are forming within them 
that will carry them through life, that 
we are making impressions upon their 
young minds that will be lasting, and 
those impressions should be of the very 
purest and chastest kind. I hope, there-

DESERET SUNDAY SCHOOL (jNION. 



fore, that the teachers will feel, when 
they have their classes before them, that 
they are to carry convictions to the 
hearts of their listeners, that they will 
remember that it is an important part 
of our teaching to instruct the children 
how to feel as well as how to think, 
for both are necessary in a complete life. 
Then again the Sabbath school teacher 
should be familiar with the history of 
the Church. If the Sabbath school teacher 
has had experience as a missionary he 
will find striking comparisons between 
the sayings of the ancient Apostles and 
Prophets and the Apostles and Prophets 
of the present time. The missionary 
will find that the conditions of life 
amonj ancient Israel were very simi- 
lar to the conditions of life among 
us. He will find many striking 
peculiarities in the system of worship 
of the apostolic age that are also 
characteristic of our own system of 
worship at the present time. In other 
words, the Sabbath school teacher 
should be familiar with our own his- 
tory, with the history of the Church, its 
organization, the labors of the Elders 
abroad, and so on, that in bringing up 
these lesons either from the Old or 
New Testament he can point constantly 
to the parallel existing between ancient 
and modern Israel, and in this way he 
will have constant illustrations that 
will enable the scholars to understand 
how we are like ancient Israel, for if 
one thing has impressed the Elder in 
his labors it is the great similarity that 
exists between us and ancient Israel, 
the similarity of organization, teach- 
ings, etc. The student should under- 
stand that if persecution overtook us it 
also overtook them; that if we were 
unpopular, they were unpopular; that if 
they had Prophets and Apostles, we 
have them likewise. The children 
should understand that if they believed 
in continuous revelation, we believe in 
continuous revelation, and in this man- 
ner bring constantly to their attention 
the similarity that exists between them 
and us, between our methods and theirs, 
our lives and theirs, our missionary 
work and theirs. This similarity may 
also be shown forth in teaching them 
geography. The location of ancient 
Israel was among the mountain tops, as 
is the case with us; their lakes resem- 
ble our lakes; their lake Mermom our 



Sevier Lake, their Galilee our Utah 
Lake, their Dead Sea our Salt Lake, 
their River Jordan our River Jordan. 
The impressions and ideas that they 
imbibed and that grew up in them on 
account of their homes and surround- 
ings are peculiar to the Latter-day 
Saints today. All these things may be 
shown, and the constant comparisons 
that may be made in teaching these 
lessons to the Sabbath school children 
may reveal and will reveal to the minds 
of the children the great similarity be- 
tween us, and these evidences will 
actually carry with them a conviction 
of the truth of our religion, and they 
will be more firmly convinced of its 
truthfulness than ever before. I hold, 
then, that these two means may, and 
ought to be, adopted everywhere in 
promulgating our doctrines and faith 
among the children, whatever the sub- 
jects may be in the Sabbath school. We 
are teaching the Old and New Testa- 
ments as well as our Church works, and 
it is as necessary, therefore, that these 
books — the Old and New Testaments — 
should be as valuable in establishing 
the truth and the evidences of that we 
believe,, as those books known to us 
as the Doctrine and Covenants and the 
Book of Mormon. 

I take it that the purpose or aim in 
asking me to speak upon this subject 
tonight was to call your attention to 
the disposition, on the part of some of 
the tea,chers to make our exercises in 
the Sunday school argumentative rath- 
er than to keep them in the line of our 
faith, that we shall have a distinct pur- 
pose in view in the education of our 
children in the. Sunday school, and that 
purpose is to make every one of our 
Sunday school children firm in the faith 
of our fathers and faithful and lasting 
Saints. God bles's you. Amen.

If you remember, one year ago last 
November, we had a Sunday school con. 
vention which lasted two days. The

general superintendency of the Sunday- 
School Union board feel that it would 
be good policy to hold another conven- 
tion next fall similar to the one held 
last November, a year ago. The reason 
we mention it tonight is because there 
is considerable detail work connected 
with it, and if we hold a convention we 
must get to work immediately. We de- 
sire to ascertain the feelings of this 
meeting with regard to holding such a 
convention next fall. All in favor of 
holding another Sunday school conven- 
tion some time next fall similar to the 
one last held will please make it mani- 
fest by raising their right hand. 

The vote was unanimous. 

We wish to announce to the Stake and 
ward superintendents that we are still 
lacking the histories of some of the 
Stake Sunday school organizations, as 
well as those of some of the wards. If 
you remember, at the close of our fifty 
years last December it was proposed 
that we get up a history of our Sunday 
school movement, to cover that period. 
We have been working on this book, 
and it is now being delayed, waiting 
the histories of the Stake and ward or- 
ganizations that have not yet been sent 
in. We trust the lacking information 
will be forwarded immediately, that the 
work may not be delayed. 

ELDER THOMAS C. GRIGGS. 

Since coming to this meeting I have 
been requested to draw the attention of 
this conference to an item that per- 
tains to our growth and interests. 

It must be realized that, in the exist- 
ence, approximately, of the Sunday 
School Union of twenty-five years, from 
an enrollment of 30,000 it has increased 
to the number of 120,000, over a four- 
fold increase in twenty-five years. Our 
labors have been wonderfully blessed, 
and I trust that this growth will con- 
tinue, so that at the end of the next 
twenty-five years we may be able to 
show another four-fold growth, bring- 
ing it up to nearly half a million. 

The attention of the Union is drawn 
to the desirability of establishing 
branch Sunday schools. The rule of 
the Union Board is embodied in the fol- 
lowing: "Urge the desirability of es- 
tablishing branch Sunday schools in 
wards where there is need of it; where, 



for instance, the children have to come 
long distances, or the school is over- 
crowded. The Union Board favors, 
where the distance is great between the 
different parts of the ward, where two 
or more Sunday schools are established 
in the ward, that each be fully organ- 
ized with a separate superintendency." 
I will say but a few words with regard 
to this matter; many might be said. 
There are conditions existing in places, 
we find, where, through growth, the 
buildings have become so crowded that 
there is not room for more. Where 
these conditions exist it would be well 
for the superintendency to look abroad 
to provide means for establishing 
branch Sunday schools. This, of course, 
should be done with the consent and 
approval of the Bishop of the ward. 
Where children have to come a long 
distance also branch Sunday schools 
could be established with profit, in or- 
der to give them the advantages of our 
Sunday school teaching and training. 
It is not necessary in all cases that 
public halls or buildings should be 
provided. My experience has been 
that many profitable branch schools 
have been established, at the beginning, 
in private houses, where one or two 
rooms had been opened by some good 
brother or sister and the children of 
the vicinity have been gathered in, and 
in such instances, so far as I have ex- 
perienced, those branch Sunday schools 
have grown wonderfully. There is this 
pleasing feature also connected with 
the branch Sunday school, as it has 
been established, and that is 
that it is largely a missionary 
factor; for not only do those that are 
active in the Church become members 
of these schools, but the facilities being 
placed within the reach of those that 
have become somewhat indifferent and 
who have not attended fully to their 
meetings and duties, their feelings and 
interests become aroused and they will 
send their children to this new school, 
and in this manner a good work is ac- 
complished. Nor should we rest with 
this. There are the children of our 
friends, all brothers and sisters in the 
human family, to whom we should ex- 
tend the advantages and privileges of 
the Gospel, for these principles are as 
valuable to them as they are to us. The

Gospel word has been increased in the 
mission field by establishing Sunday 
schools; why should this be done only 
abroad when we have many opportuni- 
ties at home? It may, perhaps, become 
necessary, where deemed advisable, in 
the establishment of these branch 
schools, that the main school render 
them their support and aid. This as- 
sistance should be freely given by send- 
ing brethren and sisters, experienced 
if possible, to assist in the teaching and 
also by sending music books, class reg- 
isters, hymn books, etc., that they may 
have material to work with. We trust 
that the superintendents will be broad- 
minded in this matter and not become 
circumscribed in their feelings and ef- 
forts or think that their work should be 
confined to their own schools only. 

This, brethren and sisters, Stake and 
ward superintendents, is but the skele- 
ton of the idea in regard to this matter. 
I am satisfied that if we were to enter 
into the field in the Spirit of the Gospel 
as we should do, the skeleton army, 
mentioned by the Prophet Ezekiel, will 
stand upon its feet and be clothed with 
sinew and flesh and have a body pleas- 
ing to look upon. 

May the Lord bless us in these labors 
and in our efforts is my prayer in the 
name of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER GEORGE REYNOLDS.

Elder Reynolds, continuing, said: 
There are one or two items to which I 
desire to call your attention. One is 
with regard to the Leaflets. Some of 
the superintendents think that, because 
there is a date upon each, they should 
only be used on that date. This is a 
mistake. They can be used at any and 
at all tinies when desirable. We think 
that the length of the Leaflets now be- 
ing published, as well as their great 
importance, is such that it will take at 
least two Sundays to consider each one 
properly, that no teacher should at- 
tempt to go over all the matter con- 
tained in any one of these Leaflets in 
one single Sunday. We have already 
published twelve numbers this 
year, but no more will be pub- 
lished this month, to give those that 
are behind a chance to catch up. We 
shall again begin distributing them to 
the schools for the first of May. 

The general board of the Deseret Sun- 
day School Union issued, some time ago, 
another Bible chart, connected with the 
life of our Redeemer, known to us as 
number Ave, the superintendents and 
teachers have apparently not under- 
stood this, as our sales have been very 
small. A copy of this chart hangs on 
either side of the stand, giving a sample 
of the pictures contained therein. We 
wish to call the attention of the super- 
intendents to the fact that we have a 
large number on hand at the Sunday 
School Union office. 

The Sunday School Union has also 
just published a chronological chart of 
Nephite and Lamanite history, which 
they propose to give free to every Sun- 
day school which has an enrollment of 
more than seventy-five members. We 
have restricted it to this number for 
the reason that we thought a small 
Sunday school with less than seventv- 
five members would probably not have

contains a statement of the years of

other information which will aid our 
students in the understanding of Book

shall also send a copy to each Stake 
superintendent, and they can now be 
obtained at the office of the Deseret 
Sunday School Union. Any persons 
wishing to purchase a copy can do so. 
The price, mounted like the one I 
Tiave in my hand, backed with

here now nearly two hours. I am down 
for some closing remarks. I will not 
trespass upon your time but a minute, 
but I want to draw your attention to 
the remarks made by Dr. J. M. Tanner. 
I think there should be more attention 
paid to the character of the instruction 
given in our Sunday schools, and every 
effort should be made to give the chil- 
dren and the youth a knowledge of our 
principles. I think we cannot devote 
our time and attention in any better 
direction than in taking this subject to 
heart and carrying it out as well as 
we can in our schools. We feel proud, 
I think, of our progress, but I can see 
a large field stretching out before us 
yet to be occupied. The children and 
young people are not receiving, with 
all our efforts, the thorough training

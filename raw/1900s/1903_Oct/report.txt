OPENING ADDRESS. 

J attar-day Saints should work in harmony — Ol'edl- 
ence to the Gospel makes man free — Progress 
of the community — Instructions about coloni- 
zation — Division of Stakes — Prosperous Con- 
dition of missions — Recent prosperity — Trades 
versus professions for the young — Educational 
Interests — Suggestions to parents in the train- 
ing of children. 

I am gratified to see the large at- 
tendance present at the opening of this 
semi-annual conference, and I sincere- 
ly hope that throughout the sessions 
our people may continue to attend and 
participate in whatever duties or la- 
bors may be necessary to be performed 
during this conference . 

I would like all Latter-day Saints 
to feel in their hearts that the work in 
which they are engaged is not only the 
work that God has instituted in the lat- 
ter days, but that it is a work in which 
each individual member of the Church 
is deeply and vitally interested. Every 
man and every woman should feel a 
deep and abiding interest in the 
work of the Lord, in the growth and 
development of the great latter-day 
cause, which cause is intended for the 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



redemption of all men from the pow- 
ers of sin. from all its contaminating 
effects, for the redemption of man from 
his own weakness and ignorance, and 
from the grasp that Satan holds upon 
the world, that men may be made free; 
for no man is or can be made free 
without possessing a knowledge of the 
truth and obeying the same. It is only 
the possession and observance of the 
truth that can make men free, and all 
those who do not possess and obey it 
are slaves and not freemen. 

It is only by obedience to the laws 
of God. that men can rise above the 
petty weaknesses of mortality and exer- 
cise that breadth of affection, that 
charity and love, that should actuate 
the hearts and the motives of the chil- 
dren of men. The Gospel as it has been 
restored is intended to make men free 
indeed, free to choose the good and to 
forsake the evil, free to exercise that 
boldness in their choice of that which 
is good, by which they will not shrink 
from doing that which they are con- 
vinced is right, notwithstanding the 
great majority of the people of the 
world may point at them the finger 
of scorn and ridicule. It requires no 
especial bravery on the part of men 
to swim with the currents of the world. 
"When a man makes up his mind to 
forsake the world and its follies and 
sins, and identify himself with God's 
people, who are everywhere spoken 
evil of, it takes courage, manhood, in- 
dependence of character, superior in- 
telligence, and a determination that is 
not common among men; for men 
shrink from that which is unpopular, 
from that which will not bring them 
praise and adulation, from that which 
will in any degree tarnish that which 
they call honor or a good name. 

The Latter-day Saints are a people 
who have been and are still familiar 
with the ways of the world. They 
have been gathered from nearly all the 
nations of the earth, and were former- 
ly associated with the various religious 
denominations extant. Hence they are 
familiar with the various religious 
creeds existing in the world, and they 
have had the courage, in the face of 
all the opposition that they have had 



to meet, and the contumely that has 
been heaped upon them, to forsake 
their former creeds, to sever their for- 
mer ties and relationships, and to for- 
sake their kindred, their homes, and 
everything that they have held dear, 
for the Gospel's sake; and they are not 
cowards; they are not slaves; they are 
not bondsmen, but they are freemen, 
because the Gospel has made them 
free. It is a knowledge of these things 
that will make a member of the Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints an 
entity in the Church to which he be- 
longs — a living factor, an active partici- 
pator in the cause in which he is en- 
gaged; one who feels, deep down in his 
soul, the truth of the Gospel; and the 
love of it moves him to works of 
righteousness and causes him to desire 
to become more and more united with 
those who are seeking to bring to pass 
the establishment of the kingdom of 
God and a reign of righteousness, that 
wickedness may be destroyed and truth 
prevail from sea to sea. 

It was not and is not my intention 
to speak long this morning. I desired 
to make a few opening remarks at this 
conference, and the thought that seem- 
ed to be impressed upon my mind was 
that every Latter-day Saint here to- 
day should be here tomorrow, and 
should continue to attend this confer- 
ence until it shall conclude on the 6th 
of this month, which is the semi-anni- 
versary of the establishment of the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints in the latter days. I would like 
all to feel that interest in this work 
and the duties and responsibilities that 
rest upon them during this conference, 
that they will be prompt in attending 
here, as they have been today. I felt 
that it would be useless for me to speak 
of this tomorrow, when it is possible 
that many might be absent, attending 
to business or pleasure. I take this 
occasion, therefore, while all are here 
to hear my voice and the voices of those 
who shall follow me, that you may 
know what we desire, and that you 
may feel prompted in your hearts to 
carry out this desire. 

I desire to say to this congregation 
that the work of the Lord, to the best

of my knowledge, has continued to 
grow and spread since our conference 
last April. I can see no evidence of 
weakness, or of weakening among the 
Latter-day Saints. Everywhere that 
I have had the pleasure and opportun- 
ity of traveling to visit the people we 
have found them earnest in their work, 
earnest in their faith, earnest in their 
devotion to the cause of God in the 
earth, and living according to the 
knowledge that they possess, agree- 
able to the will of the Father, as it has 
been made known to them. 

There have been great improvements. 
We have built, completed and dedicat- 
ed many houses of worship throughout 
the various stakes of Zion during the 
six months that have passed. There 
are many more in course of erection, 
and many will no doubt be completed 
and dedicated and ready for the ser- 
vice of the people before we shall as- 
semble again six months hence. 

The stakes of Zion continue to in- 
crease in numbers and in strength, 
save, perhaps in the larger cities. We 
find that there is a disposition on the 
part of some of our people to desert 
the cities and those parts of the state 
that are more densely settled, and they 
arie spreading out into newer countries 
and building up other settlements and 
other stakes of Zion. While we feel 
that this is a necessity, to a great ex- 
tent, we also fetel that it is unwise 
for our people to scatter abroad or leave 
their present homes, except when it 
becomes absolutely necessary for them 
to do so for their own good and for the 
good of their increasing families. And 
yet, we would advise such as have no 
homes, say in Salt Lake, or in Ogden, 
or in the larger towns and cities of our 
state, and who have no prospects of 
ever being able to obtain homes for 
themselves in these more crowded cen- 
ters — to turn their eyes and their course 
toward the newer settlements, where 
they may have the privilege of obtain- 
ing homesteads and building up homes 
for themselves and their children. 
When you do this we would advise you 
to move under the direction and coun- 
sel of those who have these matters in 



charge, that instead of scattering 
abroad you may gather abroad and es- 
tablish yourselves in communities 
where you can have the advantages of 
schools, of meetings', of Mutual Im- 
provement associations, and of all the 
other auxiliary organizations of the 
Church, and where you will ble able to 
associate together in a community for 
self-protection and for self-culture and 
advancement in all that is good. We 
find that it is not those who desire the 
welfare of Zion who are disposed to 
scatter abroad; those who love the 
truth and who are interested in the 
work of the Lord are always desirous 
of being associated with the Saints, 
wherever they may choose to locate. 

We have been under the necessity of 
dividing the Alberta stake of Zion, be- 
cause it had grown to such dimensions 
that it was a very great burdjen upon 
the presidency of the stake, in its undi- 
vided condition, to attend to all the du- 
ties that devolved upon them and to 
visit all the people. Th(ey had grown 
until they had spread for a hundred 
miles or more from one point to the 
other. We divided it recently, making 
two stakes out of the one. There are 
other stakes that are growing, and we 
have already had appeals from the peo- 
ple and those who are in charge to es- 
tablish other stakes out of the present 
existing ones, because of the increase 
of the people and the extent of those 
stakes; and in the near future it will 
be necessary, no doubt, to make other 
divisions of stakes in order that the 
people may be visited by their presiding 
officers and all may be kept in touch 
with the spirit of the Gospel and the 
work of the Lord. 

Our missions are almost universally 
in a prosperous condition. The work is 
progressing in Europe and upon 
the islands of the sea. There has been 
some little difficulty in the German 
mission, of late, but matters there have 
quieted down and our Elders continue 
to prosecute their labors there as they 
are doing in other missionary fields. 
We have succeeded in completing and 
dedicating a very commodious and ap- 
propriate building in the city of Copen-

hagen, and also in Christiania, Norway, 
since the last conference, thus giving 
to these missions a permanency that 
they have not enjoyed to the same ex- 
tent in the years that have gone by. 
Other meetinghouses for our people in 
other missions are in contemplation, 
and, perhaps, in the near future we 
may have headquarters for our Elders, 
and a meetinghouse, or church, if you 
please to call it that, in other mission 
fields, where we can advertise our 
name and our principles, and where we 
can have a permanent foothold and ex- 
hibit our works to those who are in- 
quiring after the truth, and not leave 
the people, as in years gone by, under 
the impression that we are constantly 
on the wing' in these distant lands, 
having no permanent abiding places 
there. Our mission in Great Britain, 
for instance, has continued for the 
last 60 years or more, and yet we have 
never attempted to build houses of 
worship there, and many of the peo- 
ple have supposed that our work there 
was only temporary. But we desire it 
distinctly understood that "Mormon- 
ism," as it is called, has come to the 
world to stay. We expect to proclaim 
this Gospel to the nations of the earth 
until every nation, kindred, tongue and 
people shall have the privilege of hear- 
ing the sound thereof and the voices of 
the servants of God, lifted up in warn- 
ing and in testimony to them that 
judgments will come upon the world 
and that righteousness has been made 
known and proclaimed from the heav- 
ens in the latter day. 

We have unfortunately lost some 
three or four of our Elders, by the 
hand of death, in the mission field. 
We regret this very much, and we are 
impressed with the thought that it is 
largely due, in some instances at least, 
to the lack of caution and proper care 
on the part of the Elders themselves. 
I shall be most thankful and happy my- 
self if after I have done all that I have 
the power and wisdom to do for my 
own protection, the Lord will preserve 
me by His power. Still I will give to 
Him the honor and the glory for all. 
If a man receives wisdom to guard 



himself against evil and dangers, it is 
because God has bestowed the gift of 
wisdom upon him. It is said that faith 
is a gift of God, and so it is; but faith 
does not come without works; faith 
does not come without obedience to the 
commandments of God. Men do not 
receive the gift of faith, nor the gift of 
wisdom, nor the gift of understanding, 
nor a testimony of the Spirit of the 
Living God in their hearts, without 
they seek for it. The principle is: 
Thou shalt knock and it shall be opened 
unto thee; thou shalt ask and receive; 
thou shalt seek if thou wilt find; and 
if you want wisdom, ask for it, as 
Solomon did; if you want knowledge 
and the testimony of the spirit in your 
hearts, seek for it earnestly. Put your- 
self in a position whereby you will be 
worthy to receive it, then it will come 
to you as a gift of God, and His name 
should be praised for the same. 

I am grieved to say to this congre- 
gation—and yet perhaps I should not 
express myself so— that since our last 
conference we have been deprived of 
the presence, counsel and influence of 
one of our beloved brethren, one of 
the Twelve, President Brigham Young. 
Of course you are all aware of this, 
still I mention it here that you may 
know that we do not forget those with 
whom we have been associated in 
life from boyhood to old ag)e, those, 
especially who have been faithful in 
all their callings and in the missions to 
which they have been appointed. We 
revere thleir memory and we regret 
their absence from us today. 

I am delighted with the return and 
presence of Brother Heber J. Grant 
from Japan. He has been honorably 
released from that mission to return 
and to resume his labors here, or else- 
where, as he may be called and ap- 
pointed. Brother Horace S. Ensign 
has been placed in charge of the 
Japan mission. Those who were labor- 
ing with him there are faithful, devot- 
ed, young men; but Brother Heber can 
speak of them more fully than it is 
possible perhaps for me to do. 

There are many subjects, which 
should, perhaps, be dwelt upon and 



PRESIDENT JOSEPH P. SMITH.

thought of during this conference. I 
desire to renew, in brief, what I said 
to you six months ago. Notwithstand- 
ing we have had six months more of 
prosplerity in the land — our crops have 
been unusually good this year, and the 
labor of the husbandman has been 
crowned with abundant harvests — yet, 
while prosperity has abounded through- 
out the length and breadth of the land 
of Zion, I want to tell you that there 
has not been so much prosperity 
abroad. "We frequently hear of finan- 
cial failures and difficulties. We hear 
of labor troubles in various parts of 
our land, and of wars and rumors of 
wars; but here in the midst of these 
mountain valleys, inhabited by Latter- 
day Saints, the Lord has given us peace 
and has made us secure. Our business 
relations are healthy; our business in- 
stitutions arte prosperous, and every- 
thing looks promising for the future; 
but, notwithstanding the promising 
outlook that we behold, I desire that 
my brethren and sisters will not be- 
come over-confident in this condition 
of affairs. I tell you that it is better 
for us to bie out of debt, free from ob- 
ligations and mortgages, than it is for 
us to have mortgages plastered upon 
our homes, or upon our farms, or upon 
our stocks, or anything that we pos- 
sess in the shape of values. I again ad- 
monish the Latter-day Saints to aim 
and diligently endeavor to free them- 
selves from debt. Get out of debt and 
keep out of debt, and fhen you will be 
financially as well as spiritually free. 

I desire again to say that I would 
be pleased to see more of our young 
men learning trades instead of trying 
to learn professions, such as the pro- 
fession of the law, or of medicine or 
other professions. I would rather a 
man would become a good mechanic, 
a good builder, a good machinist, a 
good surveyor, a good farmer, a good 
blacksmith, or a good artisan of any 
kind than to see him follow these oth- 
er kinds of professions. We need, how- 
ever, those who are capable of teach- 
ing in the school, and I would like to 
see a greater interest manifested by our 
young men and women in normal train- 



ing, that they might become pro- 
ficient teachers and look forward to fol- 
lowing, this profession, because it is a 
most important one, and great results 
will follow the faithful performance of 
the duties and labors of those who are 
engaged in it. The training of our 
young, the giving of proper instruction 
to those who are seeking education, and 
creating facilities in our midst for all 
who desire not only the common 
branches of education, but the higher 
branches; that they may obtain these 
privileges and benefits at home instead 
of being compelled to go abroad to 
complete their education. 

Some of our friends took very griev- 
ous offense at what I said in respect to 
some of these things last April, I be- 
lieve. I was sorry to hear what they 
said in relation to this. Why, bless your 
soul, the counsel that I gave last April 
in relation to these matters was in the 
interest of all parties and of all pro- 
fessions. I did not speak a disrespect- 
ful word of any profession, i simply 
advised, and I still advise, the young 
men of Zion to become artisans rather 
than to become lawyers. I repeat It; 
and yet I would to God that every in- 
telligent man among the Latter-day 
Saints was able to read law and to be 
his own lawyer. I wish that every man 
could and would study and become 
familiar with the laws of his state and 
with the laws of his nation, and with 
the laws of other nations. Tou cannot 
learn too much in these directions; but 
I think there are too many trying to be 
lawyers, for the good of that profes- 
sion. They are eating one another up, 
to some extent. Not long ago a young 
man who had studied law and hung 
out his shingle here, after waiting for 
business, trying to stir up business, for 
some length of time, came so near 
starving himself and family that he 
came and wanted to know what to do. 
He could not make a living in the pro- 
fession of law. I asked him if he 
knew how to do anything else. He 
said yes, he was a good printer. Well, 
then, I said, abandon the profession 
of law and take up the profession of 
printing; do something that you can do 
and that you can make a liying at. If

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



he had any practise at all in law my 
counsel to him, if he had obeyed it — 
and he did — would have been, a benefit 
to those who remained in the profes- 
sion. There are some men, most hon- 
orable, most genuine and most intelli- 
gent who are following the profession 
of the law. I wish I could say that 
much of all. 

Then, my brethren and sisters, get 
•out of debt. My young friends, learn 
to become skilful in the arts and in 
mechanics and in something that will 
be material, useful in building up the 
commonwealth where we live and where 
all our interests are centered. 

O, my brethren and sisters, I ad- 
monish you to look after your children, 
that they may grow up with proper 
habits, keeping the Word of Wisdom, 
keeping themselves morally clean and 
pure, avoiding the temptations and the 
allurements that beset them on every 
hand, that they may grow up to be 
men and women without spot and with- 
out blemish. This is the great desid- 
eratum of life, almost, at least to me. 
For me to see my children following 
in the ways of sin, departing from the 
ways of uprightness, would be the most 
grievous affliction that could befall me. 
Death itself would be more tolerable. 

Now, I feel that it is not wise cr 
proper for me to occupy more of the 
time this morning. There are many 
other things that might be said, and 
probably will be said by those who will 
address us during this conference. I 
trust that proper attention may be giv- 
en to their counsels, and that we may 
be built up and strengthened in the 
faith and encouraged in our de- 
terminations to serve the Lord, to keep 
His commandments, work right- 
eousness and try to do good to all men, 
whether they be Latter-day Saints or 
latter-day sinners. Let us do good to 
all men; that is our mission. It is our 
especial business to lift up those who 
are drooping, to strengthen the weak, 
to encourage those who are in 
doubt, and to lead on and up in the 
path of righteousness and of useful- 
ness among men in the world, that we 
may be in deed and of a truth saviors 
upon Mount Zion. That God may grant 



this to every one of us is my prayer, 
in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

The hymn on the first page of the 
book, was sung with excellent effect, 
by Brothers Wood and Noall Pratt, 
both grandsons of Parley P. Pratt, the 
author. The first verse is as follows: 

The morning breaks, the shadows flee; 

Lo! Zion's standard is unfurled! 
The dawning of a brighter day 

Majestic rises on the world. 

ELDER HEBER J. GRANT. 

Joy in preaching the Gospel — The Japat ese mission 
— Productivity of land in that country — Advan- 
tages of thorough cultivation — Tie sugar in- 
dustry — Necessity of obedience to legitimate 
authority— Good words for Elders in Japan. 

It is needless for me to say to the 
Latter-day Saints that I rejoice in hav- 
ing the privilege of again standing be- 
fore you in this Tabernacle. It is in- 
deed a pleasure, to every man and wo- 
man who possess a testimony of the 
divinity of the work in which we are 
engaged, to go forth and bear that tes- 
timony to his or her fellows. There is 
no joy that comes to the human heart, 
so far as my experience in life goes, 
that equals that which we feel when 
we are engaged in the work of the Lord, 
at home or abroad. I believe, as a rule, 
when we are away from home, and re- 
lieved of the cares generally associated 
with the ordinary affairs of life, which 
engross most of our attention, we then 
draw nearer to the Lord, and receive 
more abundantly of the manifestations 
of His Holy Spirit, than we do while at 
home. It is because of this fact that 
the young returned Elder, and the 
Elder who has been on a second or third 
mission, who has been faithful, can 
arise before congregations of the Saints 
and testify that he greatly enjoyed his 
missionary labors, notwithstanding he 
has been separated from his friends 
and not pursuing the usual avocations 
of life. 

In case I may forget it, I want to 
say a word or two about the hymn we 
have just listened to — "The Morning 
Breaks, the Shadows Flee," etc. I 
will not take time to read it, but it is 
the first hymn in the book. It was 
written under the inspiration of the 
Lord, by one of the greatest of all 



ELDER HEBER J. GRANT.

the preachers and writers of the Gos- 
pel in his day— Parley P. Pratt. God be 
praised that he has a couple of grand- 
sons who can sing it so beautifully! 
Read the hymn, and treasure in your 
hearts the sentiments of it. It fills my 
heart with joy when I realize that men 
who gave their lives, and all their time 
and talents to God's work, who never 
sought the accumulation of wealth, have 
left soils and grandsons who are follow- 
ing in their footsteps. The "Voice of 
Warning" is as much alive today, as 
when Parley P. Pratt finished writing 
it. It is sent forth by the tens of 
thousands, and there is an inspiration 
and power attending that work wher- 
ever it is distributed. 

I know that the Latter-day Saints 
have been greatly interested in the mis- 
sion I was called to preside over, and I 
regret I am not able to tell you that we 
have done something wonderful over 
in Japan. To be perfectly frank with 
you, I acknowledge I have accomplished 
very little indeed, as the president of 
that mission; and very little has been 
accomplished— so far as conversions are 
concerned — by the few Elders sent there 
to labor, or by the sisters who were 
with me. At the same time, I have the 
assurance in my heart there will yet be 
a great and important labor accom- 
plished in that land. The inhabitants 
are a wonderful people. What they have 
accomplished during the past fifty 
years, since the country was opened to 
foreigners, is little less than marvelous. 
Verily, "a nation h a s been born in a 
day," in Japan! When I was coming 
home from that mission, as well as 
while I was on my way there, I was 
profoundly impressed with the great 
progress that has been made by that 
people. I traveled from Seattle to Ja- 
pan, in returning to that country, upon 
one of the vessels of the Japan Steam- 
ship company. It is a vessel of be- 
tween six and seven thousand tons ca- 
pacity. It wag built by the Japanese 
themselves. It is owned by Japanese 
capital, and it is competing in the mar- 
kets of the world, so to speak, against 
English and American ships, and is 
holding its own. That company also 
has a large line of steamers running to 



England, Australia, and New Zealand. 
It is one of the greatest companies hav- 
ing vessels on the Pacific ocean. When 
you think of several thousand tons of 
coal loaded into a vessel you can 
imagine that it is a pretty good 
sized boat. It is nearly twice 
as long as Zion's Co-operative Mer- 
cantile store on Main street, and has 
twice as many stories, counting decks 
under and above the water, though they 
are not quite so high; and it is about 
50 feet wide. It is certainly an im- 
mense vessel. I returned home by 
another vessel owned by the same 
company, just completed in Japan, aua 
commanded by the man who was in 
charge of the one I went to Japan on. 
To give you an idea of how steadily 
those large vessels travel, I will state, 
we left Japan for home in the midst 
of what is known as an Asiatic ty- 
phoon, and notwithstanding the water 
occasionally dashed over the forward 
deck, which was, perhaps, 25 to 40 feet 
above the sea, (it is very hard to judge 
the height looking over the side of a 
vessel), and notwithstanding the waves 
were rolling high, I do not believe that 
a tumbler of water, set on the floor, 
would have tipped over during the 
storm. 

While listening to President Smith's 
remarks, I was forcibly impressed with 
some lessons I have learned by going 
to Japan. One of them is that there is 
an abundance of opportunity in Utah 
for every wideawake, active man, and 
really he does not need to rustle around 
to try and find a better country t go 
to. In Utah, we cultivate about 15 per 
cent of the soil. In Japan, it is claim- 
ed, they cultivate only 12 per cent. 
Japan is about 25 per cent larger than 
our state, therefore, the area of the 
land under cultivation is about the 
same as here; yet they support between 
forty and fifty millions of people on 
that amount of land? We think we are 
cultivating the land, why, we are sim- 
ply scratching it over, my brethren and 
sisters. There has been a wonderful 
increase in the value of land in the vi- 
cinity of Lehi sugar factory, as well 
as land in the vicinity of Ogden, Lo- 
gan, and Garland factories, because of

superior cultivation and yielding larger 
crops. I know this is a problem that 
is before the Latter-day Saints. We 
should unitedly study to create im- 
provements whereby the land will pro- 
duce more, instead of trying to see 
where we can go to get a big piece of 
land. There are many men who, with 
a few acres properly looked after and 
cultv ivated, produce more than the men 
with large farms which they sim- 
ply scratch over. We should have 
chickens to do the scratching, but we 
should thoroughly cultivate our land. 
I call to mind a man who lives at Lehi, 
a little more than a stone's throw from 
the railroad station. One year that man 
raised, on a little less than four acres 
of ground, 128 tons of beets. He was a 
very honest man, and he realized that 
many of those beets were no good for 
sugar. Tou know, in the early history 
of the Lehi sugar factory, we had to 
take everything in the shape of beets 
that the farmer raised. It was not like 
wheat; if the farmer raised some wheat 
and it got frost-bitten, and was no 
good, the miller did not have to buy it; 
but when we started the sugar indus- 
try we, figuratively, got down on our 
knees to the farmer, and if that would 
not do, we almost lay down and 
crawled to him, and begged him to 
raise beets. We had to take all the 
beets they brought us, and pay $5 a ton 
for them, and then had to feed some of 
them to the pigs, because they were 
no earthly good, not having any sac- 
charine matter in them. The man of 
whom I speak, however, realizing that 
the large beets which had grown on the 
edge of his little garden farm, close 
to where the water ran, had but little 
sugar in them, and that they were not 
worth $5 a ton, picked out about eight 
tons of the large beets and kept them 
to feed his own stock, the rest he 
brought to us. and got $600 in cash for 
them — from four acres. Soon af- 
ter that I went to the Snake 
river valley. I found a man 
there with 360 acres (I was rath- 
er sorry he did not have 400 acres), 
and I asked him how much he had 
raised that year. He said, 
about $500. He had scratched, and 



worked, and plowed, and harrowed, 
his big farm, and had raised that little; 
whereas, my friend with the four acres 
— by the way, he had a flower garden, 
and raised vegetables for his family, so 
he did not have the entire four acres in 
beets — made $600 in cash. He also had 
the pleasure of living right there with 
his friends, having the benefit of schools 
and other advantages for his children, 
instead of living away off on a ranch, 
with no educational advantages, no so- 
ciety, no improvement associations, no- 
Sunday schools, and where he would 
have to scratch, walk, harrow, plow 
and wear himself out. Then, we gave 
prizes in those^ days (I do not know 
whether they still give them) for the 
best 10 acres, the best five acres, and 
the best two and a half acres; and 
this man's four acres were better than 
anybody else's two and a half, so he 
got a $50 prize. Consequently his land 
yielded him eight tons of beets, veg- 
etables for his family, furnished him a 
house to live in, and gave him $650 in 
cash. 

President Young tried to establish the 
silk industry, when I was a boy, and 
some of the people pooh-poohed and 
laughed at it They also pooh- 
poohed and laughed at the 
sugar industry. I remember that 
every farmer I talked with said 
we could not afford to raise beets; 
that it would cost more to plant them, 
dig them up and take the tops off 
than they were actually worth. They 
have found out better now. A whole lot 
of them have discovered that it pays 
reasonably well to plant beets. Before 
I went to Japan, I priced many and 
many a farm in the vicinity of Lehi, 
and the owners had simply doubled the 
prices from what they were before the 
factory was built. I tell you that the 
actual increase in value of land in 
Utah county is more than the cost of 
building that factory. So, I am in- 
clined to think it did benefit the farm- 
er, that it was beneficial to the peo- 
ple as well as to the stockholder — that 
is, those who became stockholders after 
it was started, and not some of us who 
got in at the commencement and "went 
broke" on it.

I find there are many oppor- 
tunities, if we will but take advantage 
of them, and constantly study to im- 
prove and increase the production of 
the soil, as well as make the best pos- 
sible use of our means. I am told 
that much of the land in some sections 
of Cache valley, which was considered 
cf but very little value, is today very 
valuable, because of the creamery in- 
dustry. I rejoice to hear of this in- 
crease in values because of the estab- 
lishment of manufactures. I have al- 
ways worn home-made clothes. (Of 
course, I am wearing Japanese clothes 
now, but they will soon be worn out, 
and if I stay here long enough I will 
be wearing Provo goods again.) I al- 
ways believed in wearing them. "Why? 
Because a suit of clothes made at home 
keeps $20 to $30 at home; whereas, by 
sending the wool away to be made up 
the community would be enriched by 
the bringing back of 75 cents! By keep- 
ing the $30 here, if I do not get it 
somebody else does; and I was always 
of the opinion that, if it floated around, 
perhaps I would get even by seizing 
some of it. In buying home-made 
clothes there is part patriotism, and 
part a desire for my own pocket. 

The people of Japan are industrious. 
They learn to economize, because they 
simply have to live on very little. I 
believe that if the Latter-day Saints 
would more generally practise economy, 
frugality, and increase the production 
of the soil, there would be greater op- 
portunities for not only the people who 
are here, but for many times 
the number. "We do not need to go 
to Mexico, Canada, "Wyoming or any 
other place, to improve our condition, 
as a rule. Mind you, there are excep- 
tions, and I do not want anybody 
to think I am not willing to 
see Canada, Wyoming, Colorado 
and Mexico built up. I rejoice to 
realize that Zion is spreading. 
But, in spreading, let the people try 
to improve. Do not get so much land 
that you will work yourself to death, 
and leave your children to quarrel over 
it. Be satisfied with a moderate size 
farm— one that you can culti- 
vate, and make produce to 



the fullest extent. As I say, 
seeing that nation of forty or fifty mil- 
lions of people being supported on prac- 
tically the same amount of soil that we 
cultivate, it has given me the idea that 
there are wonderful opportunities for 
us in establishing other industries in 
addition to the sugar industry. 

Now, I say to the Latter-day Saints, 
seek for the Spirit of the Lord. Pray 
to God for the desire and strength to 
carry out, to the full extent of the 
ability God has given you, the counsel 
and instruction of the servant of God 
and his counselors, who stand at the 
head of this people. I say to you that 
if Wilford Woodruff had leaned upon 
the Latter-day Saints, and the inspira- 
tion of the Latter-day Saints as indi- 
viduals, you never would have had a 
sugar industry in this country, at least 
for many years to come. The Presiden- 
cy of this Church, in the days of the 
"boom," and just beforei the collapse, 
wrote circular letters and sent them all 
over Israel, stating that they desired 
this industry established. They ap- 
pealed to the Latter-day Saints, from 
one end of Zion to the other, to invest 
their money in it; and men who would 
invest ten, twenty, thirty, fifty thous- 
and dollars in sheep, and then go in 
debt in addition, would not put more 
than fifty or sixty dollars in this in- 
dustry intended to create employment 
for the Latter-day Saints, and to benefit 
the farmers. Some rich sheep man, if 
you showed him a herd of sheep that 
was worth fifteen thousand dollars, and 
told him he could havje it for fourteen 
thousand, would go to the Deseret Na- 
tional bank, or the State bank, borrow 
the money, and take chances; but he 
would not borrow money to put into an 
industry that the man whom God had 
called to stand at the head 
of this people desired to have 
established. No; he would give 
the sixty dollars, and say he never ex- 
pected to see it again, because the busi- 
ness would not succeed. All Israel, in 
the greatest industry that has yet been 
established here, invested the enormous 
amount of ten thousand dollars at the 
time the first payment had to be made 



to

on that factory. Many wealthy men 
whom I went to, with a letter from the 
Presidency of the Church, asking them 
to help that industry— and they were 
abundantly able to do it— declined to do 
so, and said they did not believe the 
Church had any business to put money 
in a sugar factory, that it was not 
within the province of the Church to 
do such things. I tell you it is the 
duty of the Presidency of this Church 
to ask the people to do anything and 
everything that the inspiration of God 
tells them to do. But for the wisdom 
of Brigham Young, under the inspira- 
tion of Almighty God, the Latter-day 
Saints would not be in this country at 
all. We are here in fulfillment of the 
prediction of Josleph Smith, in which 
he stated that we would be driven from 
city to city, from county to county, and 
finally be driven to the Rocky Moun- 
tains and become a great and prosper- 
ous people. It has been by the inspira- 
tion of Joseph Smith and Brigham 
Young that the people have been plant- 
ed here; and it has been through the 
blessings of God and His watchcare over 
this people, that they have been pros- 
pered. Read in the Improvement 
Era (I believe it is in the first volume) 
an article entitled "A Voice from the 
Soil," by Professor Widtsoe; it shows 
the inspiration of God to these two 
men. We are in one of the greatest 
and finest producing countries on 
earth; and this scientist, Professor 
"Widtsoe, says that this country is 
able to sustain the people from 
all nations of the 'earth, when they 
shall flee to Zion for safety. Let us 
be ready and willing to follow our file 
leaders, and to sustain them. I say 
to you that the establishment of the 
sugar industry here is the result of the 
inspiration of God to Wilford Woodruff, 
that meek and lowly man who was en- 
titled to the inspiration of God, and 
who received it. Though business men, 
and others, criticised his action at the 
time, I have lived to see his wisdom 
prove superior to the critcism of the 
"wise" ones, and the people have been 
benefitted and blessed. You will al- 
ways be blessed and benefitted in fol- 



lowing the advice and counsel of those 
whom God has chosen to preside over 
the Church. By honoring the man 
God has chosen, God will honor and 
bless you; and as you individually do 
your duty, you will grow and increase 
in the light and inspiration of the 
Spirit of God. As we grow and in- 
crease individually, so will the Church 
grow and increase. I tell you, "obedi- 
ence is better than sacrifice, and to 
hearken than the fat of rams." I am 
willing to be utterly ruined financially, 
if that resulted from fulfilling the 
council and wishes of those whom God 
has placed to preside over me. This 
is the work of God. Joseph Smith was 
a prophet of God; we must remember 
that. We must "seek first the kingdom 
of God and His righteousness," and 
then shall all other things be added. 
Life eternal is what we are working 
for. Do not allow the wisdom, the 
riches or the education of the world, 
or anything else, to blind our eyes to 
the fact that this is God's work, and 
that the mouthpiece of God is on the 
earth; when he speaks, let us be ready 
and willing, with our time, our talents 
and all that has been given us, to la- 
bor to fulfill what God desires. I tell 
you, God will vindicate His mouthpiece, 
as He vindicated Wilford Woodruff and 
his counselors in the establishment of 
the sugar industry. 

I forgot all about the Japanese mis- 
sion, in preaching about the Lehi 
sugar factory. I rejoice to say we had 
a delightful trip to Japan; and a very 
pleasant trip home, except the first 
three days, when we were in the ty- 
phon. When we held a service, 
the captain paid us the compliment of 
coming to meeting. He had his seven- 
tieth birthday on the vessel as we 
were returning, and the passengers 
contributed a few dollars apiece, and 
gave it to a gentleman for the purpose 
of buying a very handsome silver lov- 
ing cup to present to the captain, on his 
arrival in Seattle. I held services on 
the boat during the voyage, and spoke 
40 or 50 minutes. The captain said he 
had been on the ocean from boyhood, 
but had seen so much hypocrisy in re- 
ligion that he would never go to any 



ELDER HEBER J. GRANT.

of the meetings that were held on his 
vessel. But, it seems he learned to 
like us, as we went with him to Japan, 
and he came to meeting and listened 
to us; and, said he, "I declare it's 
pretty good sound sense that you folks 
talk. Tours is a pretty good practical 
sort of a religion, I rather like the 
Mormons, and will always be glad to 
have them travel on my boat." 

In Japan we have many warm 
friends; and we rejoice to know that 
our Elders are all doing very well in- 
deed; and the two sisters there have 
an excellent spirit. There was a dozen 
of us there, and I do not believe I ever 
was associated with the same number 
of brethren and sisters, for the same 
length of time, whom I loved any 
dearer. They are very choice. Of 
course, they are young and inexperi- 
enced, but the Lord Is. blessing them, 
and the younger ones are learning the 
language very rapidly. I am well sat- 
isfied with the progress they are mak- 
ing. Brother Ensign, I feel, will be 
able to take charge of the affairs of 
that mission just as well as I could 
possibly do if I had remained. He has 
had missionary experience; he loves 
the work of the Lord, and he would be 
ready and willing, if need be, to give 
his life for the cause, and that is all 
any man can do. He has 
found it difficult to learn that 
language, and once or twice 
has been a little discouraged. I 
do not blame him for this. We all get 
discouraged at times; but if we repent 
of our discouragement, and labor with 
increased zeal, the Lord never holds any- 
thing of that kind against us, neither 
do our brethren. One reason perhaps 
why Brother Ensign got a bit discour- 
aged at times was, I think, necause he 
had had such an active, energetic life 
as a missionary in Colorado. There he 
was at it early and late, singing, pray- 
ing and preaching, outdoors and in- 
doors; then to go over to Japan, sit 
down and study what people call "that 
abominable language" day after day, 
with nothing else to do — well, I tell you 
it takes a whole lot more courage and 
endurance than it does to get out and 
do active work. It tests a man mor.e 



than it does to labor. It does not re- 
quire much courage for a man to knock 
another down who hits him; but it 
takes a great deal of courage to take 
it without hitting back. It becomes 
monotonous to do nothing. Lots of men 
are first class in a fight, but of no ac- 
count to guard. Brother Ensign is la- 
boring faithfully and diligently, and the 
Lord is blessing him. All the Elders 
there love him, and he has sufficient 
wisdom, and enough of the Spirit of the 
Lord, to preside there successfully. 

When I received my release, I 
felt I could not come home; that I must 
stay at least six months more; and the 
first night, instead of being happy, as 
one usually is when released to return 
home, I felt sad, for the first 
and only time in Japan. I did not go to 
sleep until three or four o'clock in the 
morning, and I felt I must cable home 
and ask permission to remain. But the 
next day I got to enquiring of myself, 
What good is there for you to stay 
here? How much more can you do than 
Brother Ensign? And I began to realize 
it was a desire to be able to come home 
and tell you I had done something which 
prompted my wish to stay there longer. 
It was a spirit of pride; I disliked to 
have to tell you that I had been there 15 
months and done nothing. I wanted to 
stay six month more, to get some re- 
sults from the active labor we had done 
there, so that I could come home and 
say I had done as well as other Apos- 
tles who had gone- out on missions. I 
concluded it was pride, and not the 
Spirit of the Lord, that prompted this 
feeling. Then, I thought I could come 
home and perhaps go somewhere else, 
if the Lord wanted me to do so; at 
least, I could do something more profit- 
able than sitting down in Japan, and 
everything would go along all right 
there; perhaps I could move one stone, 
if not more, if I came home. The min- 
ute I got the right spirit I was wonder- 
fully happy. Brothey Kelscn was hon- 
orably released to return home, and I 
think it was about the same with him 
as with me; but, no doubt, after he 
thought about it one night, as I did, he 
was very glad to come home. You can 
ask him when you see him. Brother

GENERAL. CONFERENCE. 



Kelsch and I, I am afraid, have got 
too far along in years to ever learn 
Japanese. I believe, as President Smith 
does, that the Lord will help us to do 
something if we try all We can to do it 
ourselves; but in this case the Lord 
would have to help Brother Grant and 
Brother Kelsch such a great deal, that I 
don't think either of us had the faith to 
believe He would do it. 

Of the four who originally went to 
Japan, there are left Brothers Ensign 
and Taylor. Brother Ensign is now the 
president, and he will do well. Brother 
Taylor has done remarkably well. The 
Lord has blessed him abundantly. He 
has studied diligently, and he is a won- 
derfully intelligent, bright young man. 
Contrar3' to the usual effect, when the 
Lord has endowed a young man with 
remarkable ability, instead of his head 
swelling, and his thinking he knows 
everything, he is just as humble and 
modest as he is bright. I have never 
been associated with a more diligent, 
energetic, faithful young man in all my 
life. He is an honor to his parents, and 
to the work of God; and as sure as 
he lives, he will become an instrument 
in the hands of God of accomplishing a 
great and noble work. The five young 
men who went with me later have all 
been diligent. Some of them have 
found it easier to learn the language 
than others. They are all choice spirits 
and are progressing constantly. Those 
who have found it most difficult to 
learn the language have been the most 
abundantly blessed by our Heavenly 
Father. They have been diligent, and 
the Lord has seemed to make up to 
them what they lacked in learning 
readily. Those who have found it 
most difficult to talk Japanese, on sev- 
eral occasions, when they have been ex- 
plaining the principles of the Gospel, 
the Lord has given them words to 
speak, and they have been enabled to 
talk beyond their knowledge of the 
language. We have rejoiced in this 
additional testimony of God's goodness 
unto us. The two sisters who are there 
have done remarkably well. My wife 
found it very difficult to learn the 
language, being more advanced in years 



than the othler sisters. She learned it 
much better than I did, however; still 
it was a hard task for her. My daugh- 
ter found it easier; and really I regret- 
ted exceedingly to come home on her 
account; for she was getting the mis- 
sionary spirit; she was able to bear 
testimony, and did it humbly, and with 
the blessing of God. I felt that, if she 
could stay ther'e a few more months, 
God would give her an increased testi- 
mony, and power and ability to do a re- 
markable labor in that land. I was 
sad to bring her home, because I felt 
she was gaining an experience, in her 
childhood, that would be of very great 
value to her. 

The people there were as kind and 
considerate of us as we could possibly 
ask them to be. We followed out the 
advice we received from the Presiden- 
cy, to the best of our ability. We have 
published two tracts. One of them was 
a short tract I wrote, containing a lit- 
tle information about the Church, 
which has been re-published in the 
"Era." The other was a tract written 
entirely by Brother Taylor, on God. 
He did not attempt to write on the 
Godhead, for fear of confusing that 
people. It is a very able tract. He 
first wrote one that would have been 
very satisfactory in any land where the 
people understood English; but it 
struck me that it would be too deep, 
and far beyond what the Japanese 
could understand; so I handed it to 
him and said, Brother Taylor, I wish 
you would ask the Lord to help you 
write this in a kind of second reader 
style. He wrote it again, and simpli- 
fied it; and, if you had not known the 
same man had written the two tracts, 
you could hardly have believed it. It 
delighted us all, and we praised the 
Lord for the ability He had given 
Brother Taylor to write this tract; we 
feel it will do great good. The people 
there are wonderfully interested In 
learning English. At one time there 
were ten young men who wanted to be 
baptized. We told them not to be in a 
hurry, but to come around and see us 
occasionally, and we would talk with 
them, and after awhile, when they un-

derstood the Gospel better, we would 
baptize them. Just as soon, however, 
as Brother Taylor and .others of the 
brethren got far enough along that 
when they would come there and talk 
English, the brethren would talk back 
in Japanese they commenced dropping 
off one by one. Nearly all our con- 
verts are of that kind. They love us 
very dearly, they know we have the 
truth, and they want to bfe baptized 
right away; but when we quit talking 
English to them they lose their love 
of the Gospel. It was very amusing to 
me to have an intelligent, bright Japa- 
nese sit down and talk a whole evening 
with Brother Taylor, determined to 
talk English and never a word of Japa- 
nese, and Brother Taylor, just as de- 
termined, to never say a word of Eng- 
lish, speaking to him in Japanese. 

We have baptized only three people 
so far, and two of them I am afraid, 
arte no good. The other one, I believe, 
is a converted man and a Latter-day 
Saint. The two who were baptized 
first were quite promising, and, when I 
came home before, I reported how good 
we felt over these two men. One of 
them could spleak English, and had 
read the Bible. Oh! he believed it all 
—ready to give his life for it. I found 
out afterwards that he wanted to bor- 
row some money from me to start a 
patent medicine establishment. The 
other man, a Shinto priest, I tried to 
persuade to wait awhile before being 
baptised, but he said he believed every 
word. I took Brother Kelsch's "Beady 
References," and went over it with him, 
through an interpreter, reference by 
reference, and he swallowed every one 
of them. Inside of a week after I first 
le'ft Japan, he wanted some money from 
the brethren, and as soon as I got back 
there he wanted fifteen hundred dollars 
from me to start a job printing office, 
and when he didn't get it, his faith 
oozed out. The last convert just "went 
for us" in the beginning. H|e had been 
taught English by a Christian minister, 
and he knew all the arguments of our 
Christian friends. He used to come 
regularly and have battles with Brother 
Taylor, and Brother Taylor beat him 



every time, until it began to dawn on 
his mind that we must have the truth, 
seeing that everything he advanced was 
overcome. He commenced studying 
our faith, and read the Book of Mor- 
mon. He was finally baptized, and has 
been true ever since, and we hope he 
will continue so. 

Now, I have not half told my story; 
but the time is past. God bless you. 
Amen. 

The choir and congregation sang the 
hymn which begins : 

Come, come, ye Saints, no toil nor labor 
fear, 

But with joy wend your way; 
Though hard to you this journey may 
appear, 
Grace shall be as your day. 

Benediction by Elder David McKen- 
zie. 

AFTERNOON SESSION. 
The choir sang the sacred hymn: 

"Peace Be Still." 
Prayer was offered by Elder Charles 
F. Middleton. 

The anthem "Hosanna" was sung by 
the choir.

I sincerely ask an interest in your 
faith and prayers. I desire to speak 
to you under the influence of the Holy 
Spirit, for anv other influence would 
not edify us. I rejoice in seeing this 
large attendance at our conference. It 
manifests to us that the Saints are 
desirous of coming together and receiv- 
ing the word of the Lord. 

I was very much interested this 
morning in the remarks of our breth- 
ren who spoke to us. President Smith 
told us to be free, and not to be the 
slaves of sin. On one occasion, our 
Savior, i,n addressing the Jews who be- 
lieved on Him, said to them, "If ye 
continue in my word, then are ye my 
disciples indeed; and ye shall know the 
truth, and the truth shall make you 
free." They said to Him, "We be

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Abraham's seed, and were never in 
bondage to any man: how sayest thou, 
Te shall be made free?" Jesus an- 
swered them, "Verily, verily, I say unto 
you, Whosoever committeth sin is the 
servant of sin." In other words, the 
slave of sin. Tho Lord has command- 
ed us that we shall loose the bands of 
wickedness and break every yoke. Now, 
we want to enjoy the blessing embodied 
in the words of Jesus: "The truth shall 
make you free." The Lord wants us 
to be free. In fact, one of the objects 
of our coming upon the earth was to 
be made free, and to learn the right 
use of freedom, or free agency. The 
Lord does net want us to be slaves, or 
even servants, in the sense of being 
in bondage; but He wants us to be His 
free sons and daughters. He wants us 
to learn the right use of free agency. 
The man who abstains from sin and 
from indulgence in sinful pleasures is 
not a servant or slave; he is a free man. 
Too many there are who do not under- 
stand this, and who lack the moral 
courage to use their free agency and 
do that which they know to be right. 
Too many there are who are afraid of 
what others shall say. Latter-day 
Saints, be not afraid of what others' 
may say; but be afraid of what He 
who knows the inmost thoughts of 
your hearts shall think and judge of 
you. The man who chooses to con- 
tinue in the word of Christ, not only in 
the hearing but in the doing of it, 
though it may deprive him of the good 
opinion of many, shall know the truth, 
and the truth shall make him free in- 
deed. We should examine ourselves, 
and find out whether the truth has 
made us free, or whether we be still 
slaves to those influences that we know 
are not of God. Are we doing the 
things which God has forbidden? If so, 
it is time for us to loose the bands of 
wickedness and break every yoke. It 
is time for us to get out of bondage, 
and feel within ourselves that we are 
free indeed. 

When the Gospel was first preached 
to us we were full of doubt and dark- 
ness. By obeying the word of God we 
received an assurance that we had 



made a covenant with Him, and that 
He had accepted us. Doubt and 
darkness left us. The light of the Holy 
Spirit filled our whole beings, and we 
felt that we were free. Have we con- 
tinued to be free like this? Have we 
not, in too many instances, yielded to 
temptation and indulged in that from 
which we had covenanted to keep our- 
selves free? I am afraid that too many 
of us will find this in our history. My 
exhortation is, Let us learn to know 
ourselves, and to know how we stand 
with our Heavenly Father; and, know- 
ing this, so shape our course that we 
can gain His favor. 

We rejoice in the fact that the work 
of God is growing in the earth, and 
that He has been with His servants in 
their labors to promulgate the glad tid- 
ings of salvation unto men. Our mis- 
sionaries have gone to nearly all lands, 
and are proclaiming the will of our 
Heavenly Father and telling men that 
the time is quickly approaching when 
Christ will come the second time. When 
He came the first time, He descended 
below all things that He might redeem 
mankind, but He will come in glo- 
ry to the earth, with His holy angels, 
to meet His Saints. That time is ap- 
proaching. Much will have to be done, 
no doubt, before Christ will come to 
reign upon the earth. How long it 
will be we do not know; but we know 
this: the work in which we are engaged 
is the preparatory work for His coming. 
We call upon the whole world to re- 
pent, to turn unto God, to have faith 
in Him, to keep His commandments, 
and do the things which He has or- 
dained for salvation; then lead such 
lives that they can say in truth that 
they havte taken upon them the name 
of Christ. 

We, the Latter-day Saints, partake 
of the Sacrament Sunday after Sun- 
day, and every time we do this we make 
a covenant with the Lord that we will 
take upon us the name of Christ, and 
always remember Him, and keep His 
commandments. This covenant should 
not be an idle one. We should not light- 
ly partake of the holy emblems of the 
flesh and blood of Christ; but in par-

taking we should form a strong re- 
solve in our minds that we will do 
these things which the one who blesses 
the bread and the contents of the cup 
pronouces. When we say amen to 
his words, we make them our own, and 
we should show in our lives that we 
mean to keep the covenant which we 
make. 

The Gospel of Christ as revealed un- 
to us is the same as formerly. "When 
John was shown that an angel should 
come with the Gospel, he was not told 
that it should be a new Gospel, but it 
was the "everlasting" Gospel — always 
new, and yet everlasting; the same 
Gospel, with no change in it. How 
thankful we are, brethren and sisters, 
that the Lord has been so gracious un- 
to us that we have heard the glad tid- 
ings of the Gospel and received a testi- 
mony of its truth- Let us show our 
gratefulness unto our Heavenly Father 
by keeping His commandments and 
performing every duty required of us. 
It is the surest way to happiness; in 
fact, there is no other way by which 
we can be happy than by keeping the 
comandments of God. Choose any oth- 
er way; feel in your hearts that you can 
do as you please — you have your free 
agency— and it will not be long till you 
find that the words of the Master are 
true when He said, "Whosoever com- 
mitteth sin is the servant of sin." There 
is nothing that grows quicker upon 
anyone than indulgence in sin. It shows 
a person how weak he is. Those who 
are sunk in degradation will at times 
remember when they were innocent and 
good, and then wish they were 
back in that state; but when they at- 
tempt to get there they feel how weak 
they are, for they have become the 
slaves of sin. This should not be the 
case with us. After we have made 
covenants with the Lord, we should 
show ourselves strong enough to carry 
them out. 

The Lord, through the Prophet Jo- 
seph Smith, instructed His people to 
abstain from certain things in their 
diet, and if they would do it, certain 
blessings were promised. If I should 
ask you, Do you believe the Prophet 



received that revelation from God? I 
know you would say, Yes; and yet, how 
many of us are there who do not keep 
it? I allude now to the Word of Wis- 
dom. Is it hard to keep? Yes, to those 
who have indulged in the things for- 
bidden. They have found that the bands 
have become so strong that they can 
hardly break them. But the Lord com- 
mands us to do this. Let us show 
that we have strength. If we have it 
not, let us pray our Heavenly Father 
for strength to withstand these things, 
so that we can feel in our hearts that 
we are trying to live according to the 
commandments of God. Science gives 
evidence that the counsels given in 
that revelation are true and for man's 
best good. Now, as we believe not on- 
ly that it is a word of wisdom, but that 
it is the will of God, let us resolve that 
we will keep it. Abstain from the use 
of tobacco, which is so hurtful to the 
constitution of man. Abstain from 
strong drinks, and from the use of tea 
and coffee and the excessive use of 
meat. Whatever there is in that com- 
mandment, let us make it the rule of 
our lives. Will we regret doing this? 
I remember my uncle said to me when 
I would not take these things — and he 
happened to offer me nearly every one 
of them — "It may be the best not to 
use them, but you are losing many 
pleasures in life by abstaining from 
them." I do not feel that this is the 
case. If we have not accustomed our- 
selves to them, we will not miss them. 
Those who have accustomed themselves 
to the use of such things and abstain 
from them will feel a greater self-re- 
spect and more strength to overcome 
other weaknesses. 

My counsel to the, Latter-day Saints 
is to keep the AVord of Wisdom, also to 
remember their covenants, lead holy 
and pure lives, and keep the command- 
ments as contained in the law and 
given in the Gospel. Remember the 
poor, keep the Sabbath day holy, pay 
your fast offerings, and let not your 
donations to sustain the poor be for- 
gotten. Remember your tithing, and 
every duty required at your hands; and 
if you do, you can approach our Heav-

ELDER LEWIS S. POND, 
(President of Bannock Stake.) 

My brethren and sisters, in reporting 
my labors and the condition of the 
Bannock stake of Zion, I sincerely trust 
I may be actuated by the Spirit of the 
Lord, that what I say may be directed 
thereby. In the stake of Zion where I 
preside, our numbers are not great. 
We have only 10 small wards, and 
about 2 ; 200 souls. In a general way, the 
people have been prosperous; but for 
years past one portion of the stake has 
been laboring under adverse circum- 
stances, on account of having to haul 
water from four to seven miles. Two 
or three years ago, however, the stake 
was called upon to assist the people to 
get a portion of the waters of Bear 
river, at a cost of about $60,000. That 
has been accomplished, and many peo- 
ple are enjoying the benefits therefrom, 
though there is still a great indebted- 
ness to meet. But that covers only a 
part of the arid lands in the stake, and 
the people in some instances have be- 
come discouraged. There has been a 
spirit of restlessness prevailing, and 
many in adverse circumstances, as well 
as some in better circumstances, have 
had this spirit. Some who have held 
stake and ward positions have felt they 
were at liberty to pull up and go to 
other lands just as they pleased, and 
the effects have been detrimental. Oth- 
ers have sought the counsel of those 
who presided over them, and have gone 
to seek better places, with the permis- 
sion and blessing of the Priesthood. 

The stake presidency have always 
been united in their labors, so far as the 
work of the stake is concerned; and 
the High Council have been assiduous 
workers in helping them carry the great 
responsibilities. They have been called 
to act also as home missionaries, and 
have done a good work in the midst of 
the people. The organizations in the 
Priesthood are complete, with the ex- 



ception of one or two vacancies, which 
will soon be filled. One ward is at 
present without a Bishop, on account of 
that officer resigning and moving to 
another place. The auxiliary organiza- 
tions are in a prosperous condition. 
Those who preside in them are ener- 
getic, and willing to do all that is pos- 
sible. They travel a great deal amongst 
the young people, and their labors are 
productive of good. Most of these or- 
ganizations hold sessions through the 
winter months only, as many of our 
young people go away from home dur- 
ing the summer season to earn a liveli- 
hood. 

In a general way, there is a splendid 
feeling in the stake. Of course, as in 
other stakes, I suppose, we have a few 
that seem to think they do not have 
time to serve the Lord; they are more 
willing to give their time and atten- 
tion to the things of this world. There 
is too much of a spirit of speculation 
prevalent in the stake; and those who 
visit the different wards complain that 
some of the people do not serve the 
Lord as they should do. Many have in- 
curred great debt, and I am sorry in- 
deed to report this condition. Many 
have been prosperous, and have sought 
to enlarge their possessions, the re- 
sult is you can hear them say, "what 
shall I do to meet my obligations?" The 
implement men, and other agents who 
pass through our settlements, seem to 
have greater influence over some of 
Ihe people, in a financial way, than do 
those who preside in the Priesthood. 
Many are buying far beyond their 
means, and in working to meet their 
obligations they are depriving them- 
selves of privileges they might have in 
serving the Lord. , 

I believe our numbers are increasing 
a little. The water is being secured 
for arid lands, and people have begun 
to come in and enquire for homes 
among us. Some who moved there to 
be on the outskirts, still want to be on 
the outskirts, and are selling their 
homes and moving again. A number of 
very desirable brethren and sisters have 
joined us recently, and we invite more 
to come and make their homes with 



ELDER JAMES E. STEELE.

us. Generally speaking, unity prevails 
in the priesthood. Those who are active 
and energetic are stronger in the faith, 
I believe, than they ever were. "We are 
striving hard to bring about a still 
better condition, both spiritually and 
temporally. Our wards are usually well 
represented in Priesthood meetings, as 
are the auxiliary organizations also; 
and in a general way the people take 
home the counsels that are given, and 
try to practise every principle that will 
make them better. 

I trust the Spirit of the Lord will 
continue with us during the sessions 
of this conference. I bear testimony 
that I know the work of the Lord is 
here. I testifi' to you, my brethren and 
sisters, that »in fulfillment of the Sav- 
ior's words 1 if we will draw near unto 
Him He will draw near unto us. I have 
proved this in my own experience; the 
freedom and joy which has been spoken 
of during the conference has come to 
every Latter-day Saint. The better we 
serve the Lord, and the more diligent 
we are in His service, the greater 
amount of the Spirit of the Lord we 
enjoy, and the easier it is for us to 
make necessary sacrifices. I pray that 
the Spirit of the Lord may be with us 
continually, and that Ave may take 
the spirit of this conference to our 
homes, so that the people in general 
may be benefitted thereby. I ask these 
blessings in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 

ELDER JAMES E. STEELE. 

(President of Bingham Stake.) 

This seems to me an awkward posi- 
tion to occupy, but although I feel 
somewhat out of place, I am very 
pleased to have the privilege of making 
a report of the Bingham Stake of Zion. 
The Bingham Stake is located in the 
southeastern part of Idaho, in what is 
known as the Snake river valley. It is 
a part of the old Bannock Stake, or, as 
it is known now, the Fremont Stake. 
We number about ten thousand souls. 
We have seven or eight hundred fam- 
ilies, scattered over a large area of 
country. We have twenty-four wards 



and seven branches. All of the wards 
are fully organized, and, so far as I 
know, all the ward organizations are 
complete. All the Stake offices are full, 
with the exception of one, and that is 
the President of the High Priests' quor- 
um; the President moved from our 
Stake, and the vacancy has not yet 
been filled. Our High Council is com- 
plete, and its members are do- 
ings a good work. The Presi- 
dency of the Stake have been 
united on every question that has come 
up for our deliberation since the Stake 
was organized, in 1895. We are united 
with the High Council, and with all our 
Bishops. We are also united with the 
presidencies of the Stake auxiliary or- 
ganizations. As far as I know, there 
is no contention but that can be read- 
ily settled between the members them- 
selves. We have had but one or two 
High Council trials since the Stake 
was organized. The Stake Presidency 
meet every Thursday, at 2 o'clock, and 
deliberite upon the things pertaining to 
the welfare of the Stake. The High 
Council and the Sltake Presidency 
meet once a month and counsel togeth- 
er for the good of the people. 

We hpve a very prosperous commun- 
ity and the people are doing exception- 
ally well. We were largely in debt a few 
years ago. Many people who moved 
into the Stake from Utah had formerly 
lived on a city lot or o«i a *>mall tract of 
land, possibly not to exceed five acres, 
and when they got into the Snake Riv- 
er valley and procured from 160 to 640 
acres, th -y thought they could buy all 
things they wanted, and more too, be- 
cause th^y had so much land at their 
command. But they soon found out 
their mistake, not, however, before 
many of them had to mortgage their 
homes to secure their indebtedness. I 
am very pleased to report today that 
these mortgages have largely been lift- 
ed. Our counsel tcy the people has al- 
ways been to keep out of debt. They 
are now trying to comply with it, and 
are relieving themselves of that bond- 
age. Our crops this year have been 
very good. We have the Snake river 
to draw from for our water supply. 
Our land is very productive, and con- 



18 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



sequently we are prosperous, as a rule. 
I feel that the Lord has blessed the 
country. The blessings that were peti- 
tioned for upon the land by President 
John Taylor, in 1884, have been realized 
by :he Saints of the Snake River val- 
ley; end I feel that the Lord will con- 
tinue to bless us if we will only keep 
His commandments. That He has done 
so is my testimony to you this after- 
noon. 

I have a testimony of this great lat- 
ter-day work; I know it is true. I 
know that Joseph Smith was a Prophet 
of the living- God, and those who have 
succeeded him in the Presidency have 
been men whom God nas recognized. 
They have been blessed and clothed 
with authority to lead and direct the 
affairs of His work from the beginning 
up to the present. I feel with all my 
heart to sustain them, to hold up their 
hands, and do my part so far as I have 
power. I ask God to bless us, to uless 
our President, to bless his associates, 
and to bless all Zion, in the name of 
Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER JOHN HENRY SMITH. 

Duties and responsibilities of the Saints — Word of 
Wisdom — Consistent treatment of strangers 
who come among us. 

My brethren and sisters, I am most 
happy in the privilege of being with you 
in this conference, and in listening to 
the words that have been spoken by 
our brethren of the Presidency, as well 
as the reports made by the brethren 
representing some of the Stakes of 
Zion. 

The duties and responsibilities that 
rest upon the Latter-day Saints are 
manifold. But no duty should be more 
sacred to them than a proper observ- 
ance in their own lives of the rules 
and regulations established by the Re- 
deemer of the world to maintain purity, 
uprightness and consistency in all the 
walks of life. If the claim we make be 
true, that the Father and the Son vis- 
ited the Prophet Joseph Smith and re- 
vealed to him the character of the mis- 
sion designed for His people, and that 
mission was to call the children of men 
to repentance; and if we have been 
made partakers of the truth, and sub- 



scribed to the conditions associated 
with our entrance into the waters of 
baptism, the consistency of our lives 
should be such that its impress will be 
made upon the minds of all with whom 
it may be our privilege to mingle. . No * 
matter how little they esteem the faith 
we represent; no matter what their 
prejudices have been, or how they may 
have been engendered; if it shall be 
found, in our companionship with them, 
that our lives are above reproach, and 
our course is in keeping with the dec- 
larations we send forth to the world, 
that impress will cause men and wo- 
men to change their views, and to re- 
gard with favor and consideration those 
of us who are obedient to the moral 
principles and doctrines of the Gospel 
of the Lord Jesus. It may be that 
many, forming their judgment without 
an understanding of the purpose and 
mission of the Latter-day Saints, may 
fail to appreciate the character of the 
ministry of the Saints; but it has been 
my experience.as I have mingled among 
the children of men, that the more 
thoughtful and prudent are deeply im- 
pressed with that proposition presented 
in the scriptures, "by their fruits ye 
shall know them." It is not difficult to 
lead thoughtful men and women to 
believe in the man whose life is morally 
correct, who by his actions and sayings 
shows himself to be temperate, upright 
and exemplary, wherever he goes and 
with whomsoever he mingles. I am 
led to believe that our mission in the 
world, as the chosen people of the Al- 
mighty, will be more perfectly accom- 
plished by the upright character of the 
lives we lead in our homes and social 
gatherings, in the impress made by the 
discharge of private obligations, and 
the fulfillment of such public duties as 
may be required at our hands, with 
highmindedness, and a determination 
to uplift and better the moral condi- 
tions of those with whom we mingle, 
than it can be in any other way. The 
world today presents thousands of 
openings for men who are strictly so- 
ber, who refuse to use intoxicants un- 
der any circumstances, and who, in 
the fulfillment of their duties in lift, 
have displayed a proper regard for the 



ELDER JOHN HENRY SMITH. 



19 



Tights and liberties of their fellows, and 
handled with consistency and honesty 
the trusts reposed in them. I believe 
that, in the providences of the Al- 
mighty, it is His purpose to equip and 
prepare His people to become the aids 
and helps in government, in all parts 
of the land. But we can never attain 
the place it is His purpose we should 
until we have thoroughly indoctrinated 
ourselves in an understanding of every 
moral principle, and have a full com- 
prehension of the great responsibility 
imposed upon us in the handling of 
obligations and trusts. Our lives 
must be in harmony with everything 
that is pure, honest and upright. 

The faith we have received covers 
every principle necessary to the equip- 
ment and preparation of men and wo- 
men for the duties and responsibilities 
of the temporal as well as the spiritual 
life. The doctrines of the Redeemer af- 
fect not only the spiritual wellbeing, 
they apply also to the moral and tem- 
poral welfare of mankind. He laid upon 
each one the obligation to observe the 
moral principles and doctrines of the 
Gospel, and that it is his duty to con- 
form to the ordinances of God's house, 
and walk in harmony with the rules 
laid down by Him. He also pointed the 
way to the great possibilitiese confront- 
ing our Father's children, sought 
to impress uport*them, in such form 
that there could be no misunderstand- 
ing His purpose, His wishes as af- 
fecting their conduct in life. "Thou 
shalt not lie," was the declaration of 
the Redeemer of the world. Are we 
obedient to the mandate? Have we 
followed this rule? Have we written 
upon our minds the thought that the 
duty is ours to guard against the pos- 
sibility of being a liar? "Thou shalt 
not steal," is the declaration of the 
same great leader of men. Are we 
mindful of that declaration? Has it 
truly found lodgment in our hearts? Is 
it written in the fibers of our being? 
Are we applying it as thoroughly in the 
discharge of the duties that rest upon 
us as we should do? Let eve';' man 
and woman ask themselves these ques- 
tions, and see if the answer can truth- 
fully come from their own lips, These 



requirements given by the Redeemer 
to the world have been accepted by me, 
and have been applied in my own life 
to the best of my ability. "Thou shalt 
not commit adultery." "Thou shalt not 
kill." "Though shalt not bear false 
witness against thy neighbor." Are 
these propositions with us in spirit and 
in truth? Have they riveted themselves 
upon our minds in such form that 
wherever we go, and with whomsoever 
we mingle, we maintain our- 
selves free from these griev- 
ous errors against which the 
warning voice of the Redeemer was 
uttered. I trust we have weighed these 
propositions rightly, thoroughly com- 
prehend their import, and are striving 
to comply with them, so that none can 
question the consistency of our utter- 
ances and examples. 

President Lund, in his remarks, 
touched upon the question of the ob- 
servance of the Word of Wisdom. It is 
a singlar thing that there should exist 
any necessity, among a people so fully 
taught in regard to the sacredness of 
that requirement of the Lord, for re- 
peated admonitions . concerning it. It 
was first given to us as instruction from 
the Lord, without constraint, and later 
more fully impressed upon our minds 
by the declaration of the prophet of 
God that it was in force upon us as a 
requirement. But little by little we 
drift with the stream, and it is dif- 
ficult to find among the Saints entire 
families that are truly seeking to be in 
harmony with that principle. What a 
work could be accomplished in the 
world today if every man, woman and 
child who have been baptized into the 
Church would truly practise that prin- 
ciple! What an influence in the world 
for good we would be if ourselves, our 
children, and our children's children, 
would follow the good example, in this 
respect, of the patriarchs of the past! 
Men and women say, sometimes, they 
are too old to do it. If the generations 
who were conversant with the restored 
work of God, in the early 
rise of the Church had as 
fully obeyed the requirements 
of the Gospel as they should 
have done, concerning the Word of 



20 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Wisdom, there would now be found but 
few of our sons recreant to their re- 
sponsibilities in the line of temperate 
and consistent lives; there would more 
rarely be found among our daughters 
those whose lives are rendered unhappy 
because of nervous troubles, superin- 
duced by the use of narcotics forbidden 
by the law of God; there would more 
seldom be found boys or old men shat- 
tered in their physical structures by 
the use of tobacco, and in large meas- 
ure unfit for the duties and responsibili- 
ties of life. There would be a still larg- 
er number of men and women so fully 
established in every moral principle, 
and every temperate thought and idea, 
that wherever they went in the world 
their conduct and example would write 
itself upon the minds of men and im- 
press them most favorably. , 

Upon one occasion it was my privilege 
to be in company with a large body 
of gentlemen, a number of whom were 
of our own faith. In this assembly was 
a man quite eminent in the sphere in 
which he moved. He had been an in- 
tense temperance orator and laborer 
in temperance interests. After study- 
ing and watching the character of the 
people who formed that association, he 
made this remark to me: "I have not 
discovered in this company a single 
man claiming to be of your faith who is 
a user of intoxicants or tobacco; and 
while I have been in their companion- 
ship I have not heard one of them pro- 
fane the name of Deity." This had 
made a wonderful impression upon his 
mind. If this so impressed one man, 
what would be the impression upon the 
world at large if, as a people, we would 
fully apply these laws in our lives as 
we mingle among the children of men? 

My brothers and my sisters, these are 
questions for our consideration. They 
are for us to weigh and study. Before 
us is the world, to whom the truth of 
the Gospel we have received is to be 
preached. It must be carried to every 
land, to every people. Its extension 
and spread can be brought about more 
successfully by the honesty, the truth- 
fulness, the temperance and the in- 
dustry of those who have received the 
Gospel of the Lord Jesus, than by all 



the words that we may speak. The 
conditions that surround the people, 
the efforts they make to hold them- 
selves in subjection to the divine will, 
impress those who come into their com- 
panionship. 

I say to you that the principles of the 
Gospel are true; every one that God 
has revealed is true. He has laid the 
foundation for the development of His 
great work upon legitimate lines. He 
knows the condition of His children in 
all the world. He has put upon us the 
responsibility of establishing in our 
own homes, so far as may lie within 
our power, the elements of truth in 
such form that its impress will continue 
to grow and spread until all shall come 
to an understanding of the Gospel and 
receive it. 

Standing here before you, I desire to 
bear witness to the correctness of the 
views presented by President Smith, in 
sending forth his warning voice against 
the tendency to get into debt. The 
growth of business, the enlargement of 
our own concerns, the hope of a suc- 
cessful issue as we step into the busi- 
ness world, lead us into further invest- 
ments, until perchance we And we have 
completely overreached ourselves. It 
is these matters that we want to 
guard against. Not that we should not 
take advantage of e^ery desirable op- 
portunity for legitimate business. We 
should seek to secure means as far as 
we can consistently tP a id in the de- 
velopment of our commonwealth, to 
provide for the needs and necessities of 
those who are dependent upon us, and 
to open the door by which they who are 
in need may be furnished employment. 
Nor should we forget those who come 
to us as strangers from strange lands, 
and are of our own faith. These are 
matters upon which ajl of us should re- 
flect. Another thought presents itself 
to my mind, it is this: I believe there 
is a degree of negligence upon our part 
in looking after, as fully as we should, 
the strangers that come into our midst. 
Men drop down among us who may be 
of our faith,, and who not 
being conversant with our lan- 
guage, find themselves in a 
trying situation. I am fearful that

the same thoughtful attention is not 
now given to this class of people that 
was extended to them in former day^: 
and that too frequently they pass into 
the society of persons who embitter 
their minds against the truth, causing 
them to regret their alliance with the 
Latter-day Saints. I hope you will 
think of these things, my brothers and 
my sisters, and that, so far as possible, 
all things will be done upon your part 
that shall tend to guide these new- 
comers along the pathway of truth and 
righteousness. People gather some- 
times on their own responsibility, and 
drop into neighborhoods without realiz- 
ing the character of their surroundings. 
Our thoughtlessness, perchance, per- 
mits them to pass beyond the pale of 
our communion into the hands of oth- 
ers who impress them with the thought 
that what they have come to receive 
is not here, and that they have been 
misled. 

My brothers <^nd my sisters, the Gos- 
pel of the Lord Jesus is indeed the 
power of God unto salvation. Every one 
of us should obey its requirements. The 
souls of our fellowmen should be most 
sacred to us; and, so far as lies within 
our power, we should put them in the 
way of the accomplishment of a life 
work that shall be creditable to them- 
selves and prove a blessing to us. The 
Gospel is true. May heaven enable us 
to obey its commandments, live in har- 
mony with its principles; fulfill the 
duties and responsibilities that rest Up- 
on us, being true to our obligations! 
guarding the rights and liberties of our- 
selves and of our fellowmen that the 
well-being of all our Father's chil- 
dren shall be, indeed, sacred to us; and 
that we shall not faij in the accom- 
plishment of the proclamation of His 
word, the establishment of His work, 
the betterment of the condition of His 
children; that when we shall march 
forward to our reward, He may say to 
us, "Thou hast performed thy part in 
Judgment and mercy, and hast blessed 
those with whom thou hast mingled, 
and iniured none." May heaven's bless- 
ings abound with you; and may the 
truth extend and spread until righteous- 
ness shall prevail among the children 



of men, and the Gospel of the Lord 
Jesus ameliorate the condition of the 
human family, causing them to glorify 
the name of the Savior of the world, 
and His truth as it has been revealed 
in the day and age in which we live, is 
my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 

The choir sang the anthem, "Unfold, 
Ye Portals Everlasting."

An era of opportunity — About indebtedness — Keal 
objects of mssionary work — Progress of aux-

spect for Church officei s. 

My dear brothers and sister, I trust 
that the Lord may inspire the words I 
shall speak to you. I feel deeply inter- 
ested in the work in which we are en- 
gaged, and in the general welfare of 
this people. I know that the Lord is 
accomplishing a great and a marvelous 
work through His servants and hand- 
maidens, who have been obedient to 
the principles of life and salvation as 
revealed, in these latter days, through 
the instrumentality of the Prophet Jo- 
seph Smith. It is .indeed, pleasing to 
hear of the growth of the stakes of 
Zion, and the splendid prospects there 
are before us at home. This is an era 
of opportunity for the Latter-day 
Saints. There never was a time I can 
remember when there were so many ex- 
cellent opportunities before this people 
for the development of their resources, 
for home building, for the cultivation of 
the soil, for the establishment of in- 
dustries, and for employment. Today 
men who want work can And it. The 
establishment of various industries has 
opened new avenues for the employ- 
ment of both young and old, and there 
need be no unemployed among us. If 
we can only keep busy, and retain the 
Spirit of the Lord, we will be able to 
maintain our standing as the people 
of God. 

While most of the reports have been 
very pleasing, it is lamentable to hear 
of the indebtedness existing among 
the Latter-day Saints, as reported by 
some of the brethren. How many have 
mortgages upon their homes today, not- 
withstanding we have been always

GENERAL, CONFERENCE. 



counseled not to go in debt? True, 
there may be conditions when men, in 
order to save their honor, are com- 
pelled to incur debt; but such cases are 
rare. We have been counseled all the 
time in regard to this, and also in re- 
gard to other things we have not been 
entirely obedient to. The result is, 
many of our Elders, when called to go 
into mission fields, and labor to spread 
the Gospel among those) who sit in dark- 
ness, have to excuse themselves, for 
the reason they are under an obligation 
of debt, and are therefore unable to re- 
spond to the call. This, indeed, is an 
unfortunate condition of affairs. We 
ought to be obedient to the counsels of 
the servants of God. We should be 
willing and prepared to go wherever and 
whenever we are sent, and perform 
whatever labor we are called to engage 
in. No matter how apparently insig- 
nificant the labor may be, if we are 
where the Lord wants us, we ought to 
be satisfied. In listening to Brother 
Grant, it occurred to me, that his report 
would at least be encouraging to some 
of our mission presidents, who probably 
feel they are not accomplishing as 
much in spreading the work as they 
would like to do, and who receive no 
encouragement but that which they 
get from the Lord. Here is Brother 
Grant, one of the best preachers we 
have in the Church, and eleven other 
missionaries who have been fifteen 
months in Japan and have baptized on- 
ly three souls, yet, no doubt, they have 
labored with as great diligence as any 
missionaries could do. Our mission is 
not to go out for the sole purpose of 
seeing how many we can baptize. Our 
mission is to convert people, and we 
want to be sure they are converted be- 
fore they are led into the waters of 
baptism. We do not want people to 
accept the Gospel and afterwards turn 
from it. Better that they had never 
received it. We should be satisfied they 
are thoroughly converted to the prin- 
ciples which God has revealed through 
the Prophet Joseph Smith before they 
are baptized. While, perhaps, conver- 
sions in the world have not been num- 
erous during the past year, yet the 



labors of the Elders have been assidu- 
ous and untiring; they have been de- 
termined that people should understand 
the Gospel before being encouraged to 
accept the ordinances of baptism, and 
the laying on of hands for the reception 
of the Holy Ghost. Some of our pessi- 
mistic friends entertain the idea that 
the work of the Lord is not advancing 
much, but that idea is not correct; there 
never was a tim|e when such excellent 
reports were received from the various 
auxiliary organizations as are being de- 
livered today. I am sure there never 
was anything like it in the history of 
Mutual Improvement and Sunday 
school work. It is encouraging to 
know that the young men and women 
born in the Church, and those who are 
being brought into thle Church today, 
have such a good understanding of the 
Gospel that they rarely apostatize, or 
place themselves in a condition that 
makes it necessary to excommunicate 
them. Of course, here and there we 
hear of apostasy, or transgression; and 
yet I know wards in this Church, that 
have beien organized fifteen or twenty 
years, where there has never been a 
case of immorality on the part of the 
members. Wte must bear in mind we 
are a large body of people, and, of 
course, we hear occasionally of cases of 
transgression; but I maintain that such 
things are becoming less and less fre- 
quent among us. I believe that, as a 
rule, the young men and young women 
feared in this Church will not permit 
it to be truthfully said of them that 
they have disregarded the faith of their 
fathers and mothers, and gone astray. 
When children go astray, and exhibit no 
faith in the Gospel, I believe that, In 
nine cases out of ten, they are from 
families wherein the parents have never 
taken the pains to gather their children 
around them, and teach them the word 
of God, morning and evening; where 
they have never taught them to pray, 
or where, in their children's presence, 
they have spoken evil against the 
Priesthood of the Son of God. They 
may not have wanted their children to 
become apostate, and yet they have, per- 
haps unconsciously, sown the seeds of 



ELDER ABRAHAM O. WOODRUFF, 



23 



apostasy in their hearts by speaking 
evil of those whom it was their duty to 
sustain and uphold. 

To make good Latter-day Saints, we 
must respect our ward teachers, and 
teach our children to do the samte. We 
must respect our ward and stake offi- 
cers, not ignore them and yet profess 
great devotion to. the president of the 
Church, or to the Twelve Apostles and 
other men in high standing. The man 
who in his heart is loyal to thte presi- 
dent of the Church is the man who 
honors his Deacon, his Teacher, his 
Bishop, and his stake officers; he does 
not jump over their heads, on the 
slightest excuse, and go to the president 
of the Church with little questions and 
troubles that ought to be settled at 
home. I know there are among the 
Latter-day Saints men who, if Presi- 
dent Smith should ask them to do any- 
thing, would get up and do it in a hur- 
ry; but if their Bishop or their ward 
teacher asked them to do anything they 
would think it too insignificant. I 
think they are insignificant, for 
the reason they have not learned to 
honor the order of the Priesthood of the 
Son of Cod. They have not learned to 
respect the men whom the Lord de- 
sires them to sustain. If I were choos- 
ing a body of men who could be depend- 
ed upon to always do the right thing 
in this kingdom, I would choose men 
who honor the Deacons, Teachers, and 
Bishops, who uphold the lesser as well 
as the higher Priesthood; and who are 
good, reliable men in their respective 
wards, not men who work only on dress 
parade. Almost any one will do 
that, but it is not every one who 
will get down and dig, who 
will work in the wards, and labor dili- 
gently for the upbuilding of the king- 
dom of God when probably they are 
seen only by the Lord. If I were pre- 
siding ovjer a mission, I would think 
very little of an Elder who would work 
only when I was with him, or who, if 
he were not told just what to do, would 
sit down at mission headquarters and 
do nothing. 

It is in these little affairs of life that 
we show our love for the work of God. 



If we really love the work, there is 
nothing, no matter how small it may 
be, that we will not be glad to do for 
the upbuilding of the kingdom, whether 
it be seen of men or not. God sees and 
knows our labors, and he will reward ua 
sooner or later, according to the 
deeds done in the flesh. There- 
fore, I pray that we may give more 
attention to the details of life. Let us 
take time to instruct our children in 
the principles of the Gospel, that they 
may grow up with faith in the Lord; 
and do not shift this responsibility on 
to the Sabbath school or the Mutual 
Improvement Association. Let us in- 
still into the hearts of those in our 
own homes the spirit of the Gospel, and 
through the consistency of our lives,, 
and the help of our Heavenly Father,, 
inspire others with faith in the work 
God has called us to represent. The 
Latter-day Saints are as a light set up- 
on a hill, which cannot be hid. Peo- 
ple watch our actions and note our 
lives. What a beautiful thing it would 
be if we were all living according to 
the laws of the Gospel, as we ought to 
do! How many more people would have 
their hearts touched by tne truth if we 
were living it in our homes, as we are 
taught to do. The trouble is, my 
brethren and sisters, we do not take 
seriously some of the principles of the 
Gospel that have been revealed. From 
their actions, many Latter-day Saints 
evidently think that wnen the Lord 
gave the Word of Wisdom He was not 
in earnest, that He did not mean what 
He said; for they have gone right along 
drinking tea and coffee, and smoking, 
as if not a word had been said. They 
have been telling their children all the 
time that these things are not good 
for them, and yet they themselves have 
been indulging in them continuously. 
What will such parents say if their 
children turn away from the truth, and 
point to them as the cause of it? What 
if a son or daughter- shall say, "The 
reason I have no faith in this latter- 
day work is because my father and 
mother were inconsistent in their lives, 
they taught me to do what they would 
not do themselves? Will parents seek 
to destroy faith in the hearts of their-

children in this way? Those who do, 
the sins of the children will be upon 
their heads, just as sure as the Lord 
lives. 

God bless you, my brothers and sis- 
ters. May He give us the spirit of 
this work. May we understand that the 
time has come when we must be Saints 
in the home as well as in public posi- 
tion; that we must honor the Priest- 
hood of the Son of God in the ward, as 
well as in the stake and in the Church. 
If we would be blessed, we must take 
the counsel that has been given here 
in regard to being free, temporally and 
spiritually — free from sin and free from 
debt. May God put it into our hearts 
to receive this counsel as it comes to 
us from time to time, and give us cour- 
age and strength to carry it out. I ask 
it in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

The choir and congregation sang the 
hymn which begins: 

Praise to the man who communed with 
Jehovah; 

Jesus anointed that "Prophet and 

Seer" — 

Blessed to open the last dispensation; 
Kings shall extol him and nations re- 
vere. 

Benediction by Presiding Patriarch 
John Smith. 



OVERFLOW MEETING. 

An overflow meeting was held in the 
Assembly hall, at 2 o'clock p. m., Elder 
Matthias F. Cowley, of the Council of 
the Twelve, presiding. The Temple 
choir sang, "Ere long the veil will rend 
in twain." Prayer by Elder Samuel 
Woolley. Sisters Owen and Clayton 
sang the duet, "In Thy Temple." Chor- 
us by the choir. 

ELDER JOSEPH W. M'MURRIN. 

It is very gratifying, my brethren and 
sisters, to see the hosts of Latter-day 
Saints who have assembled upon this 
the opening day of conference, to wor- 
ship the Lord. I have rejoiced, in com- 
mon with you ; in the excellent spirit 
that was present in the meeting this 
morning, and greatly enjoyed the in- 
structions that were imparted by the 
President, and by Apostle Grant. I 



sincerely hope that we may be blessed 
in this meeting with the same spirit, 
that our hearts may be made glad in 
the things of God, and that we may 
feel it is a blessed privilege we enjoy 
to be numbered among the Saints in 
this last dispensation. 

I cannot help but feel that there is, 
in this great assemblage, a remarkable 
evidence of the glorious fact that as a 
people, as a church, we are in existence 
by the appointment of our great Father 
and God; that our organization has not 
been produced by the wisdom of men, 
but has come from above. We are as- 
sembled in this house, which has been 
erected for worshiping purposes, and 
in the Tabernacle there is a vast con- 
course of people, but these two build- 
ings are not sufficient, and there is an 
open air meeting on the grounds of this 
block, that those who are out- 
side of these buildings may also have 
the opportunity of hearing the servants 
of the Lord. "When we think of the 
small beginning of the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints, and then 
view the host of people assembled upon 
this block today, we ought to feel that 
the words of the Lord, through the 
Prophet Joseph Smith, are verily com- 
ing to pass. We heard Elder Grant this 
morning refer to the fact that it had 
been predicted by the Prophet that 
there was to come a time when the Lat- 
ter-day Saints would no longer find an 
abiding place in the state of Illinois, 
or any other state in the east, but that 
it was their destiny, and the decree of 
our Father in heaven, that they should 
go to the Rocky mountains; and that 
the time was to come when they would 
be a great and mighty commonwealth. 
We truly witness the fulfillment of this 
prophecy in the conditions that prevail 
today in this state, and in the sur- 
icunding country; and yet we only wit- 
ness a fulfillment in part. It is easy 
to see that it is the destiny of this peo- 
ple to spread out, and become much 
greater than they are at the present 
time. • 

In some of the travels that I have 
made of late I have been impressed 
with the fulfillment of this prediction. 



ELDER JOSEPH W. McMURRIN.

It has fallen to my lot to visit the 
stakes that are established in Arizona, 
and the stake in Mexico, and also the 
stakes in Canada— or the stake there 
formerly that has been divided recent- 
ly — and to visit the people who have 
been established in the Big Horn ba- 
sin, in Wyoming. In making these 
journeys I have been greatly impressed 
with the feeling that the words of the 
Prophet of the Lord are having a re- 
markable fulfillment. I am confident 
that, in the future of this work, they 
will be completely fulfilled. We are 
not yet the mighty people we are to 
become in the midst of these mountains. 
It is the decree of our Father in heaven, 
it was His decree ages ago, before the 
Prophet Joseph had an existence upon 
the earth. It was the theme of the 
ancient prophets when they thought 
about Zion and the latter times; when 
. they were filled with the inspiration of 
the Almighty. At those times they 
wrote and spoke of the latter days, and 
they were 'filled with the inspiration of 
the Lord in talking of Mount Zion, in 
describing its barrenness; and in saying 
it was the destiny of the people of the 
Lord in the latter times to subdue the 
wilderness, and to make the barren 
places blossom and become beautiful. 
This has been our mission, as a people, 
to subdue barren land, to go out into 
new sections of country and open up 
locations for habitation, that the in- 
creasing multitudes might have 
place on which to dwell. While 
we hear from time to time, 
from the leaders of the people, 
that it is not profitable, nor in har- 
mony with the spirit and genius of the 
work in which we are engaged, for 
members of the Church to be running 
hither and thither in search of new 
places for homes, it has always been, 
and I suppose it always will be, neces- 
sary for locations to be selected, un- 
der the appointment of the Priesthood, 
that room may be made for the Israel 
of God. It gladdens my heart, and fills 
me with joy, when I witness the condi- 
tion of the people, and the growth and 
expansion that is and has been taking 
place. While there are many thousands 



of people assembled here, we are but a 
small multitude compared with the 
hosts assembled in the various wards 
of Zion in religious worship today. We 
are but as a drop in the bucket when 
compared with the tens and hundreds of 
thousands who know that God has 
spoken, that the words of the prophets 
are beginning to come to pass, and that 
Zion is being established in the tops of 
the mountains, in fulfillment of those 
prophecies. 

We are not only fulfilling the predic- 
tions of the prophets in relation to our 
location, but there is abundant evi- 
dence in the doctrines that are advo- 
cated, that were revealed through the 
Prophet Joseph Smith, to establish the 
fact that we have not been organized 
by the wisdom of men, and we are 
very thankful for it. It has not been 
in the power of man, in any age of the 
world, to give the children of men 
an organization such as we have today. 
There is nothing like it recorded in 
history from the beginning of time 
down to the present day. There can 
never be anything like it, unless it be 
revealed from God; it is above and be- 
yond the wisdom and power of men. 

In visiting the California mission re- 
cently, I was greatly impressed with 
the feeling that we should rejoice in 
the doctrines of the everlasting Gospel, 
and in the evidences that exist in the 
revelations that have been given 
through the Prophet Joseph Smith 
proving his divine inspiration. I desire 
to read a few words that were written 
by the Prophet Joseph: 

"Every spirit of man was innocent in 
the beginning, and God having redeem- 
ed man from the fall, men became 
again in their infant state, innocent 
before God." 

I thought of these words when I met 
with the Latter-day Saints in the city 
of Los Angeles. A few months ago a 
great gathering of ministers of the 
Presbyterian church, after discussing 
this doctrine for a long time, having 
believed and taught that infants who 
had not been baptized, or who had not 
been christened, were damned, decided 
that this doctrine should no longer be 
a part of their faith. How was it, I 



26 



GENERAL, CONFERENCE, 



would like to ask, that Joseph Smith, 
without any theological education, so 
far as the education given by men is 
concerned, could write these glorious 
words, "Every spirit of man was in- 
nocent in the beginning, and God hav- 
ing redeemed man from the fall, men 
became again in their infant state, in- 
nocent before God?" Who can consist- 
ently disbelieve this glorious doctrine 
announced by Joseph Smith? Every 
child, it matters not of what parentage, 
whether white or black, bond or free, 
Christian or pagan, through the atone- 
mtnt wrought by the Redeemer of men, 
is made innocent before our Father 
in heaven. This doctrine was announc- 
ed in another revelation, from which I 
desire to read: 

"But, behold, I say unto you, that lit- 
tle children are redeemed from before 
the foundation of the world, through 
mine Only Begotten; wherefore, they 
cannot sin, for power is not given unto 
Satan to tempt little children until they 
begin to become accountable before 
me." 

This revelation was given in 1S30, at 
the commencement of the wonderful 
work in which we are engaged. Inas- 
much as men of wisdom and education, 
from a worldly point of view, have 
been discussing this doctrine for many 
years, we might well ask the question, 
how was it that Joseph Smith received 
this knowledge so much in advance of 
his time? For it is a long time since 
Joseph Smith announced, in the name 
of the Redeemer, this truth that has 
recently been adopted by one of the 
greatest religious roganizations extant 
among men, and that is now believed 
by millions of others. 

It is too much to believe that Joseph 
Smith discovered this by his own wis- 
dom, that he studied it out himself. 
But it is very reasonable for us to 
assume that it was revealed to him by 
ouf Father in heaven, and accept 
its truth without any argument. 
He made the startling announce- 
ment — for it was startling in the day 
in which it was given — that all children 
are saved, through the atonement of 
our blessed Redeemer. There is a 
breadth, there is a depth, there is a 



glory to that doctrine that stamps it as= 
coming from a divine source. This same 
doctrine is stated, in positive language, 
in the Book of Mormon, in the writings 
of the Prophet Moroni, who lived on 
this continent many years ago. It has 
always been understood, and always 
been a doctrine of the Church, when- 
ever there has been an inspired Priest- 
hood among men. God never created 
His children to damn them, without 
giving them an opportunity to hear and 
understand His precious word. 

"Well, I say when I think of these 
things — and they are only one or two 
of the truths revealed to the prophet, it 
is burned upon my soul that Joseph 
Smith was called of God; that he was 
a prophet of God; that he did not es- 
tablish an organization according to the 
ideas of men; that he did not introduce 
as doctrines the ideas of men; that he 
gave to the peoples of the earth princi- 
ples of eternal truth, as they were re- 
vealed to him by our Heavenly Father. 

I do not feel that it would be proper 
for me to trespass longer upon the time. 
I rejoice in this glorious work. I thank 
God with all my soul, and I have never 
found words to express my gratitude, 
that my parents, in the long ago, away 
off in Scotland, in the great city of 
Glasgow, heard and believed the ever- 
lasting Gospel. O, I thank God their 
hearts were touched. I thank the Lord 
they were converted, and that they were 
drawn into the fold of the good Mas- 
ter, and that because of their faith, and 
their firmness, and their love of truth, 
they came to Zion, and I was born in 
these mountains of Israel and was 
reared in the midst of the Latter-day 
Saints. In traveling through the cities 
of the old world, especially in my fa- 
ther's native land, and witnessing some 
of the things that are to be seen there, 
and in thinking of what might have 
been, I felt as though I could fall down 
and worship my father and mother for 
my birth here, for their coming out of 
the world, and believing the truth of 
God, as revealed through the Prophet 
Joseph Smith. I am not a believer in 
Joseph Smith because of my birth. I 
know by investigation, I know through 
prayer, and I know through revelation

from the Almighty, that the doctrines 
given through Joseph Smith are the 
doctrines of the everlasting Gospel, the 
power of God unto salvation. It is the 
truth; it cannot he destroyed; it cannot 
be overturned; it cannot be stopped in 
its advancement, in penetrating the 
hearts of men, in gathering the honest 
from the nations of the earth. It can- 
not be stayed. God has so decreed it, 
and God has always fulfilled His de- 
crees, and will continue to do so. 

God help us to believe the truth and 
to sustain it. and to maintain and up- 
hold the authority that God has given 
us, that we may be blessed, is my 
prayer, through Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER EDWARD J. WOOD, 
(President of Alberta Stake.) 
I am very pleased, my brethren and 
sisters, to meet with so many of the 
Latter-day Saints. It is also a pleasure 
that we are favored with such a beau- 
tiful day, and that so many of the Lat- 
ter-day Saints have come together to 
worship. 

I feel honored in being requested to 
represent the Alberta Stake, in the far 
north. The people there are as good as 
can be found in any of the Stakes of 
Zion I have visited. I regard it as a 
privilege to live with the Latter-day 
Saints and to be associated with them. I 
will state, for the benefit of those who 
are not acquainted with our people in 
the north, that we are in a prosperous 
condition; that the stake is building up 
and increasing in numbers. Our people 
are prospering financially; and improv- 
ing spiritually. The wards are becom- 
ing numerous; and consequently our 
stake has been divided recently. We 
very much appreciated the presence of 
the First Presidency, and a number of 
the Twelve Apostles, at our last quar- 
terly conference, which was held in 
September at which time the Alberta 
Stake was divided, and a new Stake, 
known as the Taylor Stake, created. I 
am grateful to be associated with you 
in this conference, and to be a par- 
taker of the good things and the good 
Spirit that is felt by all of us. I have 
always been proud of bearing the name 



of Latter-day Saint. It is gratifying to 
know that the Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints stands for ad- 
vancement continually, that it teaches 
all of us to become better men and Wo- 
men, better boys and girls, better from 
the cradle to the grave. 

In listening to the remarks of Broth- 
er McMurrin, the object of our being 
here on earth, and the glorious privi- 
leges we have of being members of the 
Church of Christ, came to my mind 
forcibly. I see those present who have 
gathered from many nations of the 
earth, and who have a desire to learn 
what will be best for them to do in 
order that they may please their Hea- 
venly Father. It is sometimes a great 
sacrifice for our brethren and sisters to 
come from their homes in the different 
nations. I have been on a foreign mis- 
sion and know something about the 
difficulties they have to pass through; 
and I esteem a man or woman who ex- 
tends the hand of kindness to them 
when they emigrate to this country. 

I have been reading, while sitting 
here, a beautiful hymn on prayer, a 
subject which should receive considera- 
tion from all of us: 

"Prayer is the soul's sincere desire, 

Uttered or unexpressed; 
The motion of a hidden fire 

That trembles in the breast." 

How beautiful it is to come together 
and -engage in prayer. In listening to 
the appropriate prayer this morning by 
Brother Penrose, I thought what a de- 
sirable thing it is to know how to ex- 
press ourselves in prayer. Our children 
should be taught at home to pray, and 
in the different organizations for the 
training of youth. How gratifying it 
would be if all children knew how to 
pray, and properly understood what to 
ask for. 

"Prayer is the burden of a sigh, 

The falling of a tear, 
The upward glancing of an eye, 

When none but God is near." 

We should accustom ourselves to pr-ay 
in secret, and thus have communion 
with our Heavenly Father; and exercise 
faith that our prayers may be ans- 
wered. In my experience, I have never 



28

seen a prayerful member of the Church 
go astray. 

"Prayer is the simplest form of speech 

That infant lips can try, 
Prayer, the sublimest strains that 
reach 

The Majesty on high. 

This is a particular point to which I 
wish to call attention: Through prayer 
we are made one, a nd there is nothing 
impossible for us to accomplish when 
we become a united prayerful people. 
In that condition we would more fully 
appreciate th e authority of the Priest- 
hood here upon earth, and cheerfully 
carry out what the servants of God ask 
us to do. 

"The Saints in prayer appear as one 

In word, in deed, in mind, 
While with the Father and the Son 

Their fellowship they find. 

God bless you. Amen. 
"Trust in the Lord" was sung by a 
quartet of the Temple Choir. 

ELDER RULON S. WELLS. 

My brethren and sisters, it is very in- 
spiring to me to observe the congregat- 
ing of the Latter-day Saints at a general 
conference of the Church. It increases 
my faith and causes me to rejoice, be- 
cause it is an evidence of the fact that 
God is with His people. It is a mani- 
festation of the love that is in the 
hearts of the people for the precious 
truths of the everlasting Gospel. It is 
an evidence that the Gospel is bearing 
fruit among the Latter-day Saints, and 
that a people is being raised up with a 
desire to know the will and the mind 
of the Lord. They come from the far 
north and the far south, from the east 
and the west, and from all the Stakes 
of Zion. Representatives from all the 
settlements of the Latter-day Saints, 
have come up hither to worship the 
Lord our God, and to be taught in His 
ways. 

Of course there is plenty of room for 
improvement; but I do not know of a 
people who have so great a desire in 
their hearts to overcome their weak- 
nesses and imperfections, and to grow in 
the knowledge of God, as do the Lat- 
ter-day Saints. We are probably the 
only people who believe in immediate 



revelation from God; at least, I have 
never come in contact with any other 
community that so generally believes 
that God manifests His divine will to 
the individual man or woman, and that 
through the observance of the laws 
which have been revealed, and the com- 
mandments which have been given, we 
can grow in the knowledge of our Hea- 
venly Father. I do not know another 
community that is seeking to gain sal- 
vation by inculcating the doctrine that 
"this is eternal life; To know Thee, the 
only true and living God." We are the 
only people I am acquainted with who 
are endeavoring to come to a knowledge 
of God, in order that we might indeed 
obtain eternal life. In evidence of this 
desire, the people come up from all 
parts of Zion to hear the living oracles 
of God, those who have been called and 
ordained to stand at the head of this 
people and to deliver unto them the 
word of the Lord. When I observe the 
great concourse, not only in this build- 
ing, but in the larjje Tabernacle, and 
out in the open air on this block, as 
referred to by Brother McMurrin, and 
see our streets literally thronged with 
the multitudes who have come to the 
city of the center stake of Zion, that 
they might be taught in the ways of 
the Lord, I tell you, my brethren and 
sisters, it is an inspiring occasion to 
me; and it fills me with a desire and 
with an ambition to know more, and to 
advance and grow in the knowledge of 
God. It thrills my whole being, from 
the crown of my head to the soles of my 
feet, because I realize that these feel- 
ings not only fill my bosom, but they 
are in the hearts of this great multi- 
tude of Latter-day Saints. 

"By their fruits ye shall know them." 
What is the Gospel of Jesus Christ do- 
ing for us? In what manner are we be- 
ing bettered by yielding obedience to 
the laws of God, as contained in the 
principles of the Gospel, and as made 
known to us through His servants from 
time to time? Are we refraining from 
those things that are forbidden, and 
are we seeking to do works of right- 
eousness. I believe that a great and 
glorious work is being accomplished in 
this direction among the Latter-day 



ELDER RULON S. WELLS.

Saints, and that there is a desire in 
their hearts to overcome their petty 
weaknesses and faults. 

A short time ago I had occasion, 
which I frequently have, of talking to 
my own boys. I desired to show them 
the difference between an honest man 
and a thief. You know, of course, that 
there is a great deal of difference be- 
tween these two propositions, and how 
easy it is to learn to distinguish the 
two men. You may see a man walking 
along the street, a man who is known 
for his good works, and you know him 
by his every day conduct, and some will 
say, 'There goes an honest man." Now, 
how did they find out that he was an 
honest man? There are a great many 
men of whom we do not bear this tes- 
timony. We do not feel at liberty to 
speak of some men and say that they 
are honest men, simply from the fact 
that they have never been caught in do- 
ing a dishonest deed, not by any means. 
A great many thieves have not been 
detected. There are many men and 
women who are dishonest, and yet they 
have never been convicted, for it has 
never been found out by anyone; but, 
because of something in their conduct 
and lives, no one would ever say of 
them that they are honest. With the 
honest man it is different; there is 
something in his character that mani- 
fests itself. Honesty oozes out of his 
very being. You can see in every 
act of his life that he is hon- 
est and upright. He does not 
do anything in a stealthy manner; it 
is not born in him, and It does not 
manifest itself in his daily life. It is 
the Gospel that is developing these 
traits of character in the Latter-day 
Saints. It is the observance of the law 
of tithing that is helping to develop 
noble attributes in the children of men. 
We learn to overcome our selfishness 
and greed for gain, inasmucn as we live 
according to the laws of the Gospel. 
That is what the Gospel will do for us. 
By observing those principles which 
our Father has revealed to us we are 
enabled to show the positive features 
of honesty, and not the negative fea- 
tures of dishonesty. We live above the 
law when we manifest honesty, integ- 



rity and virtue; these attributes are 
characteristics of Latter-day Saints. 
That is the effect the Gospel is hav- 
ing upon all those who are striving to 
live up to its divine teachings. I re- 
joice in this Gospel that we have re- 
ceived, for the reason that it lifts us up 
and brings us nearer to our Father in 
heaven; and when these fruits are be- 
ing made manifest among" the Latter- 
day Saints we have cause to rejoice. 

There are many men who are dishon- 
est and many who are thieves. Now, I 
would not like to accuse a young man 
who works in a store of being a thief 
simply because he may put his hand in- 
to a barrel of nuts and take and eat one 
of them. If that young r.*an should ^do 
that in the presence of his employer, 
it might probably be said that he re- 
ceived the silent consent of his employ- 
er; but, if he waits for an opportunity 
when no one is looking, and takes and 
eats one of those nuts, that is the act 
of a thief. If a person, with the intent 
to deceive and to rob, ana with such 
thoughts in his heart, takes that which 
does not belong to him, it is a stealthy 
act, and he is a thief. Many persons 
have developed this quality, though 
they may not have been detected and 
arrested; they are thieves; everybody 
acquainted and familiar with such an 
individual will feel there is something 
in his nature that debars confidence. 
You cannot trust him. An employer 
would not entrust him with his money, 
or give him the control of his busi- 
ness. 

Now, we have been reading in the pa- 
pers recently of people called shoplift- 
ers, who enter into stores and, when no 
one is looking, will put an article un- 
der their cloak or secrete it in some 
manner and carry it off. One "lady" 
that I heard of took a beautiful and 
valuable hat, worth about $30 from a 
certain dry goods establishment, without 
being seen. The hat was missed the 
same night, and all the clerks were 
asked if they had sold it, but they 
said they had not. The following Sun- 
day one of the employes of the store 
discovered a lady at church with this 
identical hat upon her head. Next 
Monday morning it was reported, and a 



30 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



bill for $30 was sent to the lady, and a 
check came back very promptly indeed. 
I might mention the fact to the ladies 
that there are some advantages in tak- 
ing your hats off in church. (Laughter.) 
I would not like to infer, though, that 
there are ladies here who have on hats 
that do not belong to them. That is 
one instance in which a thief came to 
light. There are others who are sus- 
pected of doing the same thing. Why? 
Because there is something in their 
conduct that does not inspire confi- 
dence. 

Now, the Gospel teaches us to love 
honesty for honesty's sake;, to love 
virtue for virtue's sake, and to exhibit 
the positive qualities that go to make 
up our individual characters. A per- 
son who has this reputation and the 
confidence of the people, and in whom 
you can see the manifestations of hon- 
esty on every hand, will be trusted, and 
no one will suspect him of doing any- 
thing wrong; they would think it ab- 
solutely impossible for a person of that 
kind to be guilty of a dishonest act. 
That is what I like to see demonstrated 
and exhibited among the Latter-day 
Saints. 

I also have a testimony that this is 
the work of the Lord in which we are 
engaged. I know that Joseph Smith 
was a Prophet sent of God. Every 
where we see the evidence of his divine 
mission. A few of those evidences were 
pointed out by Elder McMurrin here, 
and I was very much pleased with the 
testimony he bore. Such a testimony 
can be enjoyed by all of us. How grate- 
ful we ought to feel to our Heavenly 
Father, we who have been born under 
the new and everlasting covenant, for 
the great privilege we have had, and 
for the blessings we enjoy. I, too, am 
grateful that my parents embraced the 
Gospel and came out to the land of 
Zion; and that they sacrificed 
all they had in the world 
and identified themselves with 
the people of God. I am proud 
of the fact that my father yielded obe- 
dience to the principles of the Gospel. 
I am proud of the heritage he has 
given to me. O how I wish I could 
make others feel the same as I do re- 



garding the privilege of being born in 
Zion. 

Have we obtained the testimonies 
that we have from our parents? No. 
The testimonies that we have gained 
have come through the inspiration of 
the Spirit of God, "For no man know- 
eth the things of God but by the 
Spirit of God that is in him." A few 
days ago I was conversing with a 
brother, a good Latter-day Saints, at 
least I had always considered him a 
good Latter-day Saint, and he is 
generally reputed to be one — and 
he told me, much to my astonishment, 
that he was rather skeptical as to the 
Latter-day Saints having a knowledge 
that this is the work of God. He said, 
"we get up and bear testimony that we 
know that this is the work of God, 
that we know Joseph Smith was a 
Prophet of God; but I arm a little skep- 
tical on that point." He further said, 
"When I went on my mission I made it 
a point never to say that I knew these 
things to be true." I said: Well, 
brother, some men have come to an 
absolute knowledge of those things. 
"Well, possibly," said he, "but I hardly 
think they have." We got to talking 
of the sons of perdition, and he said 
he did not believe that Judas knew that 
Jesus was the Christ. I said, Perhaps 
not; but Peter knew it, because our 
Father had revealed it to him, and if 
Peter had done what Judas did, there 
is no Question but what he would have 
become a son of perdition. Then, I 
said, there was also the Prophet 
Joseph Smith who saw the Father and 
the Son. He said, "I am a little skep- 
tical about that." I was astonished. 
This man, claiming to be a Latter-day 
Saint, felt that he could not believe that 
with all his heart. He said that when 
he was on his mission he only testified 
once that these things were true; he 
said he could not help himself on that 
occasion. He stated to me that he be- 
lieved with all his heart that this was 
the work of God; that he was willing to 
die for it, if necessary, and to do any- 
thing on earth to further it; but he said 
he would not say he knew the Gospel 
was true. On the occasion referred to 
he said he could not help it; he felt 



ELDER HEBER S. ALLEN. 



31 



in his whole being that if he did not 
declare that Joseph Smith was a Pro- 
phet of God he would be damned. I 
told him he would have been damned 
if he had not borne this testimony, and 
that the reason he felt and spoke as he 
did was because he had the Spirit of 
God, for no man could know that with- 
out he had the Spirit of God. I took it 
for granted he would thus learn that 
the reason he does*not know it now is 
because he has not the Spirit of God. 

My brethren and sisters, let us live 
in such a way and manner that we 
may enjoy the Spirit of God at all 
times, that we may have a testimony 
of the truth, and never doubt that the 
Father and the Son appeared to the 
Prophet Joseph at the beginning of 
this great latter-day work. We oaght 
to feel greatful in our hearts that this 
testimony is with us. May God help 
up to be faithful to the end, is my 
prayer, in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER HEBER S. ALLEN. 
(President of Taylor Stake). 

My brethren and sisters, I feel very 
much in need of your sympathy and 
the Spirit of the Lord while I stand be- 
fore you this afternoon, because I feel 
very weak indeed in addressing this 
vast audience. 

I certainly appreciate the privilege of 
meeting with the Saints in general con- 
ference, and I appreciate the friendship, 
love and confidence of the Latter-day 
Saints. 

"While I have never had the privilege 
of going abroad among the nations of 
the earth to promulgate the Gospel in 
which we are engage J, I have spent 
perhaps the best part of my life in a 
foreign land— or at least what is to the 
people of the United States a foreign 
land— in Canada. I am glad my lot 
has been cast in that land. A great 
many people in Utah and other places 
know but little about Canada; they feel 
we are away off on the outskirts, and 
that we do not have the advantages en- 
joyed here and elsewhere. Of course, 
there are many things you have and 
-"ojoy that we do not have. But we 



can say that the Lord's hand has been 
over us for good. President Card was 
called by President Taylor to go there. 
I remember that, about fifteen years 
ago, President Card related a dream he 
had. He said that when he first went 
to Canada everything looked forbid- 
ding, and only a few of our people 
accompanied him to that country the 
first season. He dreamed he saw a 
hive of bees, or at least a few bees, and 
more continued to come, until the hive 
they had entered became too full, and 
they swarmed and went out, and other 
colonies were formed. Now, that dream 
has been fulfilled, I have lived to see 
it. The beginning in that country was 
a very small one, but the Saints have 
kept "swarming," and new settlements 
have been formed, until they became 
so numerous that the stake had to be 
divided and a new one created. While 
we have had a great many difficulties 
to contend with, which are incidental 
to the establishment of homes in a new 
country, the hand of the Lord has been 
over the people. T presume the Taylor 
stake of Zion, which was organized 
about a month ago, is the smallest stake 
in the Church, that is as to 
the number of wards; we have but 
three at the present time. However, 
we have between 3,000 and 3,500 peo- 
ple in those three wards. . They are the 
newest settlements of our people in 
Canada, two of them having been found- 
ed about four years ago, under the di- 
rection of President Woodruff and 
President Snow, and the other is only 
about two years old. Now, while we 
are a very small stake in that country, 
we do not expect to remain thus long. 
I believe that within three years the 
Taylor stake will be larger than the 
whole of the Alberta stake was previ- 
ous to the division. We have a large 
country to grow in, and when the di- 
viding lines between the two stakes 
were set, Apostle Taylor said it would 
extend from the United States bound- 
ary line to the north pole; so we have 
much room in which to grow. 

I do not believe in people leaving 
their good homes in Utah to go to 
Canada. I believe the advice President 



32 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Smith gave in the morning meeting 
was good; I know it is, for I have had 
experience in that country, and I would 
not advise people who own comfortable 
homes to go to Canada. There is much 
room for good homes in that country; 
but we do not want people to emigrate 
to that land without the advice and 
consent of those who preside over them. 

There is a great gathering of young 
people in that land; the Lord has 
blessed us abundantly in that respect. 
The last census shows that one-third of 
the entire people are under eight years 
of age; so, within 25 years we will 
build up a great country there, without 
any more emigration to assist us. 

The Saints there have a good name. 
We are striving to build up the king- 
dom of God, and are interested in all 
the affairs of Zion. We like to mingle 
with the brethren and sisters of other 
stakes to learn how they are doing 
things. I was much gratified, on my 
way from Canada, to see the improve- 
ments in meetinghouses in Pocatello 
stake, and also in Utah stake, which I 
visited recently. We attended Priest- 
hood meeting in Provo yester- 
day and gained something there. 
The progress the Saints are mak- 
ing is gratifying to me. We in Canada 
hope to prove to the king, and his rep- 
resentatives who preside over the af- 
fairs of the Dominion, that the Latter- 
day Saints are what they profess to be, 
a God-fearing people. We desire to 
become a people who will be recog- 
nized as the most virtuous in all of the 
king's domains; that is what we are 
striving to be, and I believe we are at 
the present time. We aim to be the 
most honest and most law-abiding peo- 
ple that the king has. We desire to 
set an example in all of our settlements 
to all people who are looking for that 
which is good, noble and elevating. 

I believe ours is the only district in 
western Canada where prohibition pre- 
vails. The laws in Canada permit the 
people to decide whether liquor shall be 
sold in their settlements or not, and if 
three-lifths are in favor of its not be- 
ing sold, it is prohibited, so far as open 
saloons are concerned. The "Mor- 



mons" in western Canada have the 
name of being the only community that 
has taken advantage of this law; the 
saloons in our midst were abolished a 
little over a year ago, and we now have 
none. 

In all our organizations we are 
doing a good work; and, although 
we are a long way from head- 
quarters, I feel we are not be- 
hind some of "the other stakes 
in many things. Our Sunday schools 
are doing exceedingly well, as are also 
the Mutual Improvement associations; 
and, while we have but two stakes in 
that region today, I believe we will 
have many within a few years. 

The Lord has blessed us temporally, 
but we feel that the temporal blessings 
are" not those the Saints should seek for 
most. There are things more import- 
ant for the Latter-day Saints than tem- 
poral blessings — though if we can get 
the temporal along with the spiritual, 
so much the better— but we feel, as Lat- 
ter-day Saints, that the Gospel of the 
Lord Jesus Christ and the principles 
it teaches are dearer to us than any- 
thing else on earth. If all our people 
will continue to feel that way, honor 
the Priesthood and strive to magnify 
it in all the affairs of life, we will be- 
come a power for good in the king's do- 
minion. 

I presume there are hundreds here this 
afternoon who know the Gospel is true, 
that the Book of Mormon is true, and 
that the Prophet Joseph Smith estab- 
lished, through the help of the Lord, the 
work of God upon the earth. They know 
this and do not guess at it. I know 
that the Church and Kingdom of God 
is with us, the Lord has given that tes- 
timony to me by the power of the Holy 
Ghost, and I could not deny, it, for He 
has manifested the truth of this work 
to me on many occasions. 

If all the Latter-day Saints, and es- 
pecially those who hold the Priesthood, 
could fully understand the great re- 
sponsibilities they have taken upon 
themselves in receiving a portion of the 
Priesthood, and live up to their knowl- 
edge, we would be a much greater pow- 
er in the land than we are today. I have 



ELDER HYRUM M. SMITH. 



33 



noticed in the papers, that, in referring 
to the success and advancement of the 
Saints, they attribute it to various 
causes. Some say it is irrigation that 
has made the Latter-day Saints great; 
others say it is the cunning of the fi- 
nancier, because of the money accumu- 
lated through the tithes of the people. 
But we know these things are only a 
secondary consideration. We know that 
the Priesthood which the Lord has re- 
stored to the earth in this day and age 
of the world, and the power it gives to 
us, and our being baptized into one 
body and one spirit, is the foundation 
of the success of the great latter-day 
work. Take these away and we will be 
just as other men and women are. I 
wish that all the Latter-day Saints 
could realize and feel alike in relation 
to these things; and that every man 
who holds the Priethood, could realize 
that nearly everything depends upon 
how we magnify that Priesthood. 

The people of the nations of the earth, 
some of them, recognize that there is a 
power with the Latter-day Saints that 
they do not meet elsewhere. The people 
of Canada, those who have launched 
large colonization schemes, acknowl- 
edge there is a peculiar power with the 
Latter-day Saints .that has enabled 
them to become established in that 
land, and that has helped them to ac- 
complish all they have done. They can- 
not understand this, but they acknowl- 
edge it; and they know there is some 
characteristic of the Latter-day Saints, 
something in their communism that 
holds them together that is not found 
in other communities in the Northwest 
Territories. The Latter-day Saints in 
Canada have made greater progress 
than any other colonies have done in 
the same length of time. "We attribute 
this to the blessings of the Lord, to the 
power of the Holy Priesthood and to 
the Spirit we enjoy; and I rejoice in 
all these things. I wish that all men 
would be honest and sincere enough to 
investigate the principles of the Gospel 
that the Latter-day Saints are promul- 
gating in the world. 

I feel well, my brethren and sisters, 
and rejoice that my parents embraced 
the Gospel, and that. I have been born 



under the new and everlasting cove- 
nant; I fear if I had not been thus 
favored I would not now be a member 
of the Church. I am grateful for all 
these things, and for the progress the 
Latter-day Saints have made. I hope 
to see Zion arise and shine until she 
becomes the glory of the whole earth, 
and that all men and women shall feel 
to say, "Let us not go up to fight 
against Zion because of her terrible 
ones." May th"e Lord bless us, is my 
prayer, in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER HYRUM M. SMITH. 

To the Latter-day Saints these great 
gatherings are a source of strength and 
hope, and enjoyment. I believe that, 
through thus meeting together and par- 
taking of the Spirit that the Lord pours 
out upon His children, and by receiving 
the words which are spoken by the ser- 
vants of the Lord, we go home filled 
with a greater incentive to serve God 
and to keep His commandments. 

We should be impressed with the re- 
mark of President Smith this morning, 
that the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints is not a temporary 
organization, but that it is an organiza- 
tion which is permanent, 'which is and 
will be everlasting. It has been found- 
ed by God Almighty, and He has placed 
His stamp of approval upon. His peo- 
ple, and will ever do so, if they will 
keep His commandments and walk in 
His paths. To the Latter-day Saints, 
the walking in the paths of righteous- 
ness, the keeping of the commandments 
of God, and the enjoyment of the 
Holy Spirit, ought to be a source of 
satisfaction and gratification beyond 
the power of words to express. We 
ought to strive, individually, to make 
the Church of Christ stronger. The 
Church ought to be strong, because of 
the multitude of its members; and each 
member should take a particular pride 
in adding strength to the Church be- 
cause he or she is a member of it. 

We have the privilege of knowing of 
a surety that this is the work of God. 
It is no chance proposition with the 
Latter-day Saints; it is a surety. There 
is no doubt in the mind of a conscien-

tious and fully converted Latter-day 
Saint that God, the Father, and Jesus 
Christ, His Son, the Savior of the 
world, appeared in person to the Proph- 
et Joseph Smith. That is a knowledge 
that is possessed by tens of thousands 
of Latter-day Saints, and it is a knowl- 
edge, furthermore, that can be gained 
and possessed by every individual born 
into this world, if that individual will 
but follow the instructions given of the 
Lord whereby men can come to a 
knowledge of the truth. "Why, our chil- 
dren know it; the little boys and girls 
of the Sabbath schools know it. They 
are taught it, and learn .it in their as- 
sociations with one another and with 
the people of God; and the Spirit of the 
Lord which is upon and in them bears 
witness to them, even as children, that 
the things their parents teach, and 
which are taught by their Sunday 
school teachers, and by those who hold 
the Priesthood, are true. The Spirit of 
the Lord bears that witness, and 
there is no doubt in their minds; it is a 
knowledge; it is just as simple and easy 
to understand as the simplest proposi- 
tion that any child may learn. Not- 
withstanding this, there are those in 
our midst for the purpose, so they say, 
of reclaiming us, and converting us to 
the standard of Christ, as they term it. 

The Church of Jesus Christ of Lat- 
ter-day Saints stands in this world to- 
day for purity, for honesty, for right- 
eousness, for virtue, for truth, for no- 
bleness, and for every good, beautiful 
and glorious principle that has ever 
been made known to man. The Church 
of Christ stands for all these things, 
and it is the only organization in the 
world today that has the pure Gos- 
pel of Jesus Christ, as the Sa- 
vior Himself taught it when He was 
upon the earth. It is just as ridiculous 
for those not of us, who do 
not understand the Gospel of Christ, 
who have not a knowledge of it (ex- 
cept from a sectarian standpoint, which 
is not a knowledge,) to come among the 
Latter-day Saints and declare unto 
them that Joseph Smith was nor a Pro- 
phet of God, as it would be for 
a teacher to go among our school 
children who have passed through a 



number of grades and declare unto 
them that two plus two does not make 
four. It would be just as ridiculous for 
them to do that as to declare that the 
sun does not appear first in the morning 
in the east and that it does not disap- 
pear from view in the evening in the 
west. It would be just as ridiculous, 
and is, for men and women to declare 
to the Latter-day Saints, who have a 
knowledge of the truth, that they are 
mistaken as it would be to tell them 
that water will not seek its own level, 
or that it will of itself rise higher 
than its source. 

The Spirit of God has borne witness 
to the Latter-day Saints that these 
things are true, and we know they are 
true; therefore, it is foolishness for men 
to come into our midst and declare unto 
us that these things are false; we know 
better. It is God's truth revealed from 
heaven, confirmed in our souls by the 
Holy Ghost, which we have received by 
the laying on of hands by those who 
have been ordained of God and upon 
whom has been conferred the holy 
Priesthood. Consequently, that is the 
reason there are so very few ever con- 
verted from the Church of Christ into 
the churches of those who pretend to 
be of Christ. One of our friends here, a 
minister of the Gospel, complained bit- 
terly a short time since, because, said 
he, "After a man has been a Mormon, 
no matter what he does, if he can be 
converted and is won away from the 
Church, he is of no use to us anyway; 
he is of no use to anybody. We can 
do nothing with him, as those ideas 
hang to him while he lives and are al- 
ways cropping out to disturb the doc- 
trines which we have to teach him." 
If they only knew it, if they who fight 
the Gospel of Christ in anyway what- 
ever, from the pulpit or the press, only 
knew that all of their efforts in con- 
tending against the trutn and endeav- 
oring to bring the Latter-day Saints 
into a false light would be reactionary 
and would be overruled by an all-wise 
Providence for the good of His Church, 
they would perhaps not work so hard 
as they do. If they only knew that in 
converting an individual who has had 
a knowledge of the truth and has fallen 



ELDER HTRUM M. SMITH. 



35 



away,, or who has gotten into the dark, 
and doubts, through sin and trans- 
gression — for men can fall from a knowl- 
edge of the truth only through disobe- 
dience of some kind — if they knew th.*t 
in winning such persons from us they 
were but adding strength to the Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints 
and were weakening their own organi- 
zations in gaining such individuals, 
they, perhaps, would not be so anxious 
to get them. 

It is obvious that if you take from 
any proposition, from any mechanism, 
the weak parts, those parts that threat- 
en the rest of the machinery or the rest 
of the organization, you strengthen 
that organization; and if you take that 
weak portion and add it to yourself, 
you do not add strength to yourself, but 
weakness instead. Now, take those 
Latter-day Saints who are in trans- 
gression and who have joined other 
churches, some people think they are 
converted from the truth, but they are 
not; they have lost a knowledge of the 
truth through their transgression, and 
when they are cut off from 
the Church of Christ and join 
some other organization they 
weaken that organization, and it 
makes the Church of Christ stronger 
because of the absence of those persons 
in transgression. We would be pleased 
to have them repent; but some people, 
you know, will not repent; they cannot 
repent. On the other hand, take the 
ministry of the Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints, that Church 
which sends forth its ministers with 
divine authority to preach the Gospel 
of Jesus Christ and declare repentance 
to the world, whom do they convert? Is 
it those who have been ostracized and 
cast away from all religious doors? No. 
Is it those who are in transgression in 
the other churches, or in the world 
among men? No. Who is it? Why, it 
is the people who are most devout, who 
are most conscientious in serving God, 
so far as their knowledge and light 
goes. They want to serve the Lord, and 
they are striving to serve Him; they are 
prayerful; they are meeting-goers; in 
fact, those converted to the Church of 
Christ are the very best parishoners 



that are to be found in the churches 
of the world. In other words, they are 
the strongest individuals to be found in 
the various organizations of Christen- 
dom, and in gaining them we add 
strength to the true Churcn. We see 
the evidence of this fact when we look 
around at the hundreds and thousands 
of good, noble, conscientious, devout 
men and women who have been fathers 
and mothers of such men as Brother 
McMurrin and Brother Allen here, and 
tens of thousands of others who are 
making or have made their mark in 
this land, who are endeavoring to build 
up the Church of Christ on the earth, 
and who are a benefit to any commu- 
nity, wherever they may be. It is fa- 
thers and mothers of other young men 
who shall carry on the work of God in 
the world that our Elders are convert- 
ing in Christendom. In adding such 
people to the Church we add strength 
to it, and we make the sectarian 
churches weaker every time one is won 
from them and is brought to a know- 
ledge of the truth. 

We stand, as I said, for truth, for hon- 
esty, for honor, for integrity, for every- 
thing that is good, my brethren and 
sisters, and those who will not yield 
obedience to these principles and 
nvho will not serve God, must, 
sooner or later, be cast off 
from the true Church of Christ. 
People who are sinful and unrepent- 
ant, people who are in transgression, 
men and women who are wicked in 
their hearts and who will not repent, 
can never enter into the kingdom of 
God; and no man or woman who is 
full of iniquity and sin can stand in this 
Church very long; no, they will be 
weeded out. There are sins, my breth- 
ren and sisters, which may be commit- 
ted that cannot be repented of in this 
life, nor will they be forgiven in this 
life nor the life to come, and men and 
women who commit these sins cannot 
be retained in the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints. Show me 
another church in the world that in- 
variably excommunicates men or wo- 
men because of transgression or wick- 
edness: there are none. Murderers, 
whoremongers, keepers of saloons, 



36 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



gambling hells and brothels, the doers 
of all evil, may be members in the de- 
nominations of the world. Apparently 
there is no sin a person can commit 
that would cause other denominations 
to excommunicate one of their members 
from their churches. A member 
can repudiate the church, and 
then there is nothing else for the 
church to do than to cast him out. The 
Catholic church would not even do that 
in by gone years; they would burn them 
at the stake, and then pray 
for their salvation. As a gen- 
eral thing, no matter how wicked, 
or what the occupation of a man may 
be, he can occupy the very best pew in 
the church, if he will but sustain it 
with his means. That cannot be done 
in the true Church of Christ. We must 
serve God; we must keep His com- 
mandments; we must eschew the very 
appearance of evil and do that which 
is right to retain our standing in the 
Church, which has been founded in 
this earth by God, the Father, and by 
the Son, Jesus Christ. If your deeds 
are such as were mentioned by Brother 
Wells, that is, if they are not known 
by men, let me assure you that God 
knows them, and while you may con- 
tinue in this secret sin a member of 
the Church, a professed member of the 
Church, the day will come, my breth- 
ren and sisters, if those sins are not 
.repented of most sincerely, God, the 
Eternal Father will separate you from 
those who are faithful, and will cast 
you out from His presence and from 
His salvation, because of your sins. 
Therefore, we say, repent, ye Latter- 
day Saints; repent and call upon the 
world to repent. You wno are warned, 
warn your neighbors; you who have a 
knowledge of the truth, teach your chil- 
dren; you who know that God lives, 
bear your testimony to the world, that 
all may have the privilege of knowing 
that God lives and that this is His 
Church, and that the Latter-day Saints 
are God's people. 

Now, may the Lord bless you, my 
brethren and sisters. M,ay you be 
benefitted in this conference and go 
forth and serve the Lord with single- 
ness of purpose, and with an eye single 



to the glory of God and to the building 
up of His kingdom, that the earth may 
be prepared for Christ's reign as King 
of Kings and Lord of Lords, when we 
may bask in His approbation and smiles 
of approval because of our faithfulness 
in doing His will and carrying out the 
counsel given to us through His ser- 
vants. May the Lord bless us to this 
end, in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER MATTHIAS F. COWLEY. 

My brethren and sisters, I have no 
desire to prolong the meeting. We have 
had a good one, and very much excel- 
lent counsel and admonition, and I 
trust that each one of us will make 
it the business of our lives to carry 
them out. 

I wish to remind the brethren and sis- 
ters who are here of the counsel given 
by President Smith this morning, that 
just as far as possible you will attend 
the conference meetings tomorrow and 
the next day, until the conference ends. 

I have been very much impressed 
with the remarks of all the brethren, 
and especially the las* remarks of 
Brother Hyrum in regard to the teach- 
ing of our children, and I desire to 
say just a word or two on this subject. 
Recently I enjoyed the honor and priv- 
ilege of accompanying President Smith 
and his party to Canada, and the Big 
Horn. In the Big Horn Stake of Zion 
I had occasion to stop all night in va- 
rious places, and I believe that, at ev- 
ery place where I stayed, before they 
had prayer at night, the family was 
called together and sat down and sang 
a hymn, one of our sacred songs, and 
they were attended by the influence of 
the Holy Spirit. A chapter was read 
from the Book of Mormon or the Bi- 
ble, and, if time permitted, some re- 
marks were made upon it for the bene- 
fit of the children. The father, mother, 
and children, each in turn, from time to 
time offered the family prayer. Now, 
this is a very simple thing. I enquir- 
ed of the President of the Stake if that 
was the practice of every family in the 
Stake, and he said he believed it was; 
it had been counseled. I wish to say 
that this is a very good practice. It 
has been recommended to us time and 



ELDER MATTHIAS F. COWLEY.

time again, by the Presidency and oth- 
er brethren of the Church. It simply 
means this, my brethren and sisters: 
That it is establishing- the Church of 
God in our homes; it is establishing the 
worship of God around the family altar, 
and I believe if we try it we will find 
that good results from it. I desire to 
carry it out myself, in order that I 
may consistently recommend the same 
to others. I believe that the great 
cause, possibly in about nine cases out 
of ten, of the transgression of our chil- 
dren, and the cause of skepticism in 
some instances, is not that they natur- 
ally drift away, but because they have 
been neglected; we have not sat down 
and talked to them. We have got to 
establish the order of heaven in our 
families, in the spirit of prayer and sup- 
plication, and must teach our children 
the principles of divine truth. 

I want to say another thing to the 
Latter-day Saints: If you have any 
grievances against any of your neigh- 
bors or against the servants of God 
who stand in authority in this Church, 
do not talk about those grievances be- 
fore your children. I give that out as 
the word of the Lord. If you do, you 
will poison the minds of your children, 
and the day will come when you will 
regret it, when you would like to fill 
their souls with interest in the work 
of God and with the spirit of this Gos- 
pel, and then you will remember you 
have poisoned them. I give this coun- 
sel because I feel impressed with it. 

Now, just one more item occurs to 
my mind. I suggest to the brethren and 
sisters, and especially the Presidents 
of Stakes and Bishops of wards, that 
when they attend conference in Salt 
Lake City they should take advantage 
of every opportunity afforded at the 
meetings for informing their minds in 
regard to the work of God. I do not 
mean by this our attendance alone at 
the general assemblages, but also at 
the other meetings we are invited to 
attend. (The speaker here invited the 
Saints, especially those in authority, to 
attend the Religion Class meeting to 
be held at the close of this service.) 
God has established these auxiliary 
organizations in the Church for the ed- 



ucation and training of our children, 
and no man is justified in depreciating 
them, in casting any reflection upon 
them, nor in saying they are not nec- 
essary in the work of God. Every sound 
Latter-day Saint will welcome every 
institution in this Church as a help in 
the education of our children in the 
principles of the Gospel. 

I bear my testimony to the truth of 
this work, that Joseph Smith was a 
Prophet of God. This testimony comes 
to us by the Spirit of God; and, outside 
of this, they of the world are proving 
he was a Prophet of God. Brother Mc- 
Murrin, in speaking of the Presbyterian 
Church dogma regarding infant dam- 
nation, which they have taught for the 
last 250 years, might have added that 
the Methodist Church is adopting the 
law of tithing. The Epworth League 
also has made a covenant to give one- 
tenth of its income to the service of the 
Lord. The sectarians are now adopting 
what the Prophet Joseph Smith taught 
over seventy years ago. They are not 
doing it to sustain the Prophet, but it 
proves he was a Prophet, for he said 
the Gospel would revolutionize the 
world. God bless you. Amen. 

The choir sang: , 

"Now we'll sing with one accord, 
For a Prophet of the Lord," etc. 

The benediction was offered by Elder 
Stephen L. Chipman. 



OPEN AIR MEETING. 

At 2 o'clock in the afternoon an open- 
air meeting was held near the bureau 
of information building on the Temple 
block. The meeting was called to or- 
der by President Jos. E. Taylor and 
opened with the hymn: "High on the 
Mountain Top." Prayer was offered 
by Elder D. H. Grow, of Huntsville. 

Singing, "Praise to the Man." 

President Taylor then introduced El- 
der Ben E. Rich, president of the South- 
ern States mission, who gave an inter- 
esting and spirited address, touching 
upon the divine mission of Jos. Smith 
and the wonderful spread of his teach- 
ings throughout the world. 

Elder J. G. Duffin, president of the 



38 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Southwestern States mission, next 
spoke. He referred to the ancestry of 
the Prophet Joseph and said that his 
every act proved him to be a prophet 
of the living God. 

President Joseph E. Robinson, of the 
California mission, was then introduced. 
He showed from the Bible that proph- 
ets from the earliest days were perse- 



cuted, and believed in by but few, hence 
the treatment received by Joseph Smith 
and the rejection of his teacnings by so 
many, is but a repetition of sacred 
history. 

The meeting was attended by fully 
1,000 people, and closed with the sing- 
ing of "The Doxology," and benediction 
by Elder James Sharp. 



SECOND DAY. 



Monday, Oct. 5, 10 a. m. 

The choir and congregation sang: 

Our God, we raise to Thee 
Thanks for Thy blessings free 
"We here enjoy. 

The opening prayer was offered by 
Elder Jonathan G. Kimball. 

The choir sang the hymn which be- 
gins: 

High on the mountain top 
A banner is unfurled; 

Ye nations, now look up, 
It waves to all the world. 

ELDER JOHN W. TAYLOR. 

References to Christian Science and hypnotism — 
Clergymen seekiLg to rectify defei-ts in their 
religions— The revea'ed Gospel of Christ the 
only pathway to salvation. 

My dear brethren and sisters, I hum- 
bly pray that the Spirit of the Lord 
which is the spirit of truth and right- 
eousness, may prompt me in all that I 
shall say this morning, and I trust you 
will pray unto our Father for me, that 
He will enable me to talk in such a way 
as shall be pleasing in His sight. I am 
a firm believer in inspiration. I believe 
the statement in the Scriptures that 
the word of God "came not in old time 
by the will of man; but holy men of 
God spake as they were moved by the 
Holy Ghost." 

On my way to this meeting I met a 
neighbor of mine, and he said, "Broth- 
er Taylor, have you noticed any blight 
in your pear orchard?" I told him I 
had not noticed it particularly, and 
asked him what it was. "Why," said 
he, "if you will notice carefully, there 
will be a few limbs toward the top of 
the tree where the wood begins to with- 



er a little bit, and the leaves then 
wither and dry up." I asked him what 
the effect of this blight was upon the 
tree, for he seemed to be well posted on 
the subject. He replied that it had the 
effect, if the evil is not corrected in its 
incipiency, to kill out not only the tree 
affected, but the entire orcliard. What 
is the remedy? said I. He answered 
promptly, "The remedy is to cut off the 
blighted part about one foot below 
where it is dead, and be careful to 
gather all the leaves and branches, take 
them out of the orchard, and burn them 
up." I have since been thinking about 
the trees in my orchard, and I remem- 
ber that several of them have some 
dead limbs, and are evidently blighted 
a little. It would be well for us all to 
look after our orchards carefully. 

Now, my brethren and sisters, I have 
imagined I can see a blight, not only 
upon our orchards, but in some of the 
families of the Latter-day Saints, and 
that is much more serious than having 
our orchards blighted. Christ said: 
"Fear not them which kill the body, but 
are not able to kill the soul; but 
rather fear him which is able to 
destroy both soul and ibody in hell." 
If the families in Salt Lake City were 
an orchard, and each one represented 
a tree, I can imagine there are a few 
dead branches that may be likened un- 
to the blighted trees yferred to in my 
conversation this morning. The Apos- 
tle John, in writing to the Saints in his 
day, used this expression: 

"Whosoever transgresseth, and abid- 
eth not in the doctrine of Christ, hath 
not God. He that abideth in the doc- 



ELDER JOHN W. TAYLOR. 



39 



trine of Christ, he hath both the Father 
and the Son. 

"If there come any unto you, and 
bring not this doctrine, receive him 
not into your house, neither bid. him 
God-speed: 

"For he that biddeth him God-speed 
is partaker of his evil deeds." — II John, 
9-11. 

This is one of the best guides we 
have received from inspired men of 
olden times. "Whosoever transgresseth. 
and abideth not in the doctrine of 
Christ, hath not God. He that abideth 
in the doctrine of Christ, he hath both 
the Father and the S_on." We are also 
told: 

"And this is life eternal, that they 
might know Thee, the only true God, 
and Jesus Christ, whom Thou hast 
sent." — John, 17:3. 

"No man knoweth the Son, but the 
Father; neither knoweth any man the 
Father, save the Son, and he to whom- 
soever the Son •will reveal him." — Mat- 
thew, 11:27. 

"No man can sav that Jesus is the 
Lord, but by the Holy Ghost."— I Cor- 
inthians, 12:3. 

We learn, then, that if we abide in 
the doctrines of Christ we have both 
the Father and the Son, and being in 
fellowship with them and with the 
Holy Ghost, which constitute the God- 
head, we are heirs of glory, immortal- 
ity and eternal life. 

Various doctrines are being promul- 
gated among the Latter-day Saints at 
the present time that. I would like to 
refer to briefly. One of these is Chris- 
tian Science, which has spread to some 
extent in this city, and to my mind it 
is like the blight upon the orchard. If 
it is not "cut off about one foot be- 
low the dead branches," it may kill the 
tree and affect the whole orchard. Let 
us reason together a few moments up- 
on this. In olden times, certain gifts 
and blessings were promised the 
Saints. One was the gift of prophecy, 
another the gift of healing, another the 
gift of tongues, another the interpre- 
tation of tongues, another the gift ol 
wisdom, another the gift of knowledge, 
etc. Now, I say to you there is not one 
of these gifts that is a principle of sal- 
vation in and of itself. Though they 
were promised by the Savior, and exer- 
cised by His Apostles, and always exist 
in the true Church of Christ, there is 



not one of them that, of itself, will save 
and exalt the children of men in the 
kingdom of God; for they are not prin- 
ciples of salvation when segregated 
from the doctrines of Christ. 

Take Christian Science, as it is called, 
and it rests largely upon what they 
term "being happy," and the healing 
of their bodies when afflicted. I testi- 
fy to you, as a servant of the Lord, 
that you may lay hands on the dead 
and raise them to life again, as Christ 
did the widow's son, or you may heal 
the afflicted by the r>nwer of God, and 
the fact that they are healed or brought 
to life again »will not save them in the- 
kingdom of God; for they may after- 
wards go into transgression, and wan- 
der from the straight and narrow path 
which leadeth to the lives eternal. 
Therefore, I say it is not a principle 
of salvation apart from the Gospel. An- 
other thing: Is the fact that we may 
be temporarily happy going to save us 
in the kingdom of God? Have we not 
got to abide in the doctrines of Christ, 
or we have not the Father and the 
Son? What are the doctrines of Christ? 
Look at His example; He was the Re- 
deemer of the world. He said, "I am 
the life and the light of the world," 
and he invited all to follow Him. What 
did He do? He went unto John and 
requested baptism of him. At first, John 
forbade Him, saying, "I have need to 
be baptized of Thee, and comest Thou 
to me?" But the Redeemer of the 
world was not satisfied with that ex- 
pression of John's humility, for He 
knew that if He did not yield obedience 
to that principle of righteousness — one 
of His own doctrines — He could not 
fulfill the law of all righteousness and 
be the Redeemer of the world, to which 
He was ordained before He came into 
this world. Therefore, He said unto 
John: "Suffer it to be so now: for thus 
it becometh us to fulfill all righteous- 
ness." Then John suffered Him, and He 
went down into the water and was bap- 
tized. He came up out of the water, 
and the Holy Ghost descended upon 
Him in the form of a dove; "and lo a 
voice from heaven, saying. "This is My 
beloved Son, in whom I am well 
pleased." I would say to all the Chris-

— ihe kings and queens upon their 
thrones, and those who are in the hum- 
bler walks of life— to all nations, kin- 
dreds, tongues and people: Except you 
are born of the water and of the Spirit, 
you cannot enter the kingdom of heav- 
en. Except you abide in this doctrine 
which Christ taught and practised, you 
can never enter into His kingdom, 
worlds without end. You must abide in 
the doctrines of Christ. You may say, 
"I am happy in this religion." Bless 
your soul, is not the Mon- 
golian happy when he is ly- 
ing upon his couch smoking the 
deadly fumes of opium? In the hal- 
lucination of his mind, does he not 
imagine that he is having pleasure and 
joy? I tell you there is no true happi- 
ness except that which comes from a 
faithful performance of duty, under the 
gift and power of the Holy Ghost. The 
Lord hath said: 

"Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, 
neither have entered into the h^art of 
man. the things 'which Ond hnth pre- 
pared for them that love Him."— T Cor- 
inthians, 2:9. 

But they say. "we are so happy." and 
one woman will go to another, and to- 
gether they will go from house to house 
teaching these doctrines. What is the 
result? The result is. the blight be- 
gins to show upon another tree. Men 
and women who have been faithful in 
the Church of Christ begin to neglect 
their duty, forget their prayers, speak 
against the Holy Priesthood, and 
wander into by and forbidden paths 
which leadeth to destruction. Show me 
a man or woman who has adopted 
this single principle of faith, 
and has neglected the weightier 
things of the kindgom; show 
me any member of the Church 
who has joined any of these 
Christian Science associations, and I 
will show you a man or woman who 
has been finding fault with the author- 
ities of the Church, neglecting to pay 
tithing, and not praying unto God for 
light and wisdom. I ask how the Lord 
could ever have built up His Church in 
ancient days by somebody simply say- 
ing they felt happy? People with such 
ideas may be enjoying the happy hallu- 



cinations of dreamland, but they are 
sleeping the sleep of death. The 
Prophet Moroni spoke of the good gifts 
that God had placed in the Church of 
Christ, and then said, "Touch not the 
evil gift, nor the unclean thing." What 
is the evil gift and the unclean thing? 
It is any gift, or inspiration or inclina- 
tion that will lead men from the 
straight and narrow path, and from 
serving the trule and living God — the 
God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. 
Could Solomon have satisfied the Lord, 
when He commanded him to build a 
temple, by saying, "Lord, I am happy 
all day long; I am not sick, I am not in 
distress, and I do not need to build a 
temple? Certainly not. The Lord 
would undoubtedly have said to him 
that He wanted him to build a temple 
unto God, no matter whether he was 
happy or sad, and He would have re- 
proved him sharply. He does not ex- 
pect us merely to satisfy our own de- 
sires. "Man shall not live by bread 
alone, but by levery word that pro- 
ceedeth out of the mouth of God." 
Suppose Noah, when he was called 
upon to build an ark to save a few 
of the sons and daughters of God, that 
the human race might be perpetuated, 
had said, "I am happy, I am never af- 
flicted, and I enjoy myself;" would that 
have saved anybody from the flood? 
The Lord our God wants the children of 
men to do something. He wanted Noah 
to build on ark, and Noah built it. You 
cannot build arks and temples, you 
cannot gather Israel and establish the 
kingdom of God, on one principle of the 
Gospel alone. You cannot make a 
watch or clock go with only one of its 
wheels. You cannot make the human 
body active by separating the head or 
th\e feet from it. The body as created 
is perfect, in beautiful symmetry, and 
it cannot be complete if we take one 
part of it and reject the rest; it takes 
the whole to make the perfect man. It 
is so with the kingdom of God. 

Another thing that we have in our 
midst is what is called hypnotism. 
There is a sprinkling of Latter-day 
Saints tainted a little with this. You 
can see the blight and the wither of

hypnotism "on the tops of the trees." 
Men are being- carried away with it, and 
are beginning to exercise unrighteous 
dominion ovter the children of men, be- 
cause they have stronger wills than 
others. They try to charm others.and 
make them do as they please. Don't 
you know that, in th>e days of Moses 
and the prophets, charmers were put 
to death? The Lord so despised the 
idea of one man exercising unrighteous 
dominion and influence over another 
that he gave a law, commanding that 
charmers should be put to death. And 
He has . opened His mouth in this day 
and said: 

"The rights of the Priesthood are in- 
separably connected with the powers of 
heaven, and that the powers of heaven 
cannot be controlled nor handled only 
upon the principles of righteousness. 

"That they may be conferred upon 
us, it is true; but when we undertake 
to cover our sins, or to gratify our 
pride, our vain ambition, or to exercise 
control, or dominion, or compulsion, 
upon the souls of the children of men, 
in any degree of unrighteousness, be- 
hold, the heavens withdraw themselves; 
the Spirit of the Lord is grieved; and 
when it is withdrawn, Amen to the 
Priesthood or the authority of that 
man." 

This hypnotic power is not of God. 
It is an evil gift. A short time ago 
I was in the Malad stake of Zion, where 
a man had been studying this art 
of hypnotism, and he proposed to the 
Bishop of the ward that he take les- 
sons so that he could hypnotize the 
people to make them do as he pleased. 
My brethren and sisters, that is the 
doctrine the devil proposed in heaven, 
when the Lord our God was preparing 
to people this earth. He proposed to 
take away the agency of men, and to 
exercise unrighteous dominion over 
them. But the Lord rejected his plan, 
and chose His Son Jesus Christ to 
come into the world with the plan of 
life and salvation that we now tteach. 
The doctrines of Christ are plain and 
simple, and they do not sanction the 
use of unrighteous dominion upon the 
souls of the children of men. There- 
fore, 1 say unto you, hypnotism is not 
of God. 

Women go from house to house, and 



say they were healed, or their children 
were healed, by Christian Science; or 
they had been hypnotized and got such 
great relief from it, and "it would as- 
tonish you how happy I've been ever 
since." I say to you, my friends, we 
should not seek in this life to become 
happy by exercising evil gifts among 
the children of men. You can .read of 
the magicians in, ancient times casting 
down their rods, and, through the ex- 
ercise of the evil gift, their rods be- 
came serpents, as did the rods of Mo?es 
and Aaron. But, when it came to slay- 
ing the firstborn, the Lord said in ef- 
fect, Thus far shalt thou go, and no 
further. The first born of the children 
of Israel were saved, while the first- 
born of the children of Pharaoh and 
the other Egyptians were destroyed. I 
speak of this to show you that the wis- 
dom of the Lord is greater than the 
cunning of the devil, and the power of 
the Priesthood is pre-eminent over ev- 
ery other power on the earth. 

There are Latter-day Saints who ap- 
parently place their whole faith upon 
one of the gifts of the Gospel. Some 
may place their faith upon the gift of 
healing, others upon the gift of proph- 
ecy, others upon the gift of tongues or 
the interpretation of tongues. I say 
again that these gifts, in and of them- 
selves, are not principles of salvation. 
They are given for the temporary com- 
fort of the Saints. But the Holy Priest- 
hood is without beginning of days or 
end of years; it will remain with the 
Saints throughout the eternal ages to 
come. 

The Apostle Paul says: 

"Whether there be prophecies, they 
shall fail; whether there be tongues, 
they shall cease; whether there be 
knowledge, it shall vanish away. 

"For we know in part, and we proph- 
esy in part. 

"But when that which is perfect is 
come, then that which is in part shall 
be done away."— I Corinthians, 13: 
810. 

That is perfectly natural; for when 
that which is perfect is come, we shall 
see as we are seen, and know as we 
are known. There will be no need for 
men to prophesy what shall take place, 
for we shall all see and understand it. 
In that day it will not be necessary for 



42 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



one to say to another, Know ye the 
Lord; for all shall know Him. Perfect 
knowledge 'will be enjoyed by all. We 
shall see eye to eye, and be of one 
heart and mind in the kingdom of God. 
It will not be necessary for any to 
speak in an unknown tongue: for t">e 
original Adamic language will be re- 
stored, and all shall speak in the one 
tongue. Hence how consistent it is to 
say, "When that which is perfect is 
come, then that which is in part shall 
be done away." These gifts are now 
given to us as a lamp to lighten our 
pathway, to encourage us when our 
spirits are drooping, to heal our bodies 
when we are afflicted, and to give us 
knowledge of things to come, that we 
may be buoyed up and go on to per- 
fection. 

My brethren and sisters, this doctrine 
of Christian Science is not of God. Hyp- 
notism is displeasing in the sight of the 
Lord, and those who practise it may be 
likened unto the charmers, soothsayers, 
sorcerers, and idolaters of ancient 
times. They were so repugnant in the 
sight of the Lord that He gave special 
laws to Israel in relation to them. Now, 
shall we, who have come out of dark* 
ness into light, turn away as the sow to 
wallow in the mire, or like the dog to 
his vomit? Shall we go back to the 
beggarly elements of the world? I say 
unto you, as said the old prophet, Let 
those who bear the vessels of the Lord 
be clean. Jesus said, "No man. hav- 
ing put his hand to the plow, and look- 
ing back, is fit for the kingdom of 
God." 

I testify unto you, my friends, that 
the Lord our God has raised up Joseph 
Smith the Prophet in this our day. He 
has delivered unto the world the Book 
of Mormon, which is a history of the 
ancient inhabitants of this continent. It 
is the word of God to the people of the 
earth. It is the writings of prophets 
who have lived upon this land, just as 
the Bible is the writings of prophets in 
the land of Palestine, and a his- 
tory of the dealings of God with 
ancient Israel. The heavens have 
been opened in our day. The Father 
and the Son appeared unto Joseph 
Smith, and the Gospel has been restor- 
ed. This Gospel is being preached ac- 



cording to the commandment of the 
Savior. "He that believeth and is bap- 
tized shall be saved; but he that be- 
lieveth not shall be damned." How 
can we keep the commands of God? 
By listening to His voice and doing 
His will. There are those m the world 
who are blighted with the idea that if 
they only believe on the Lord Jesus 
Christ they can be saved. This is a con- 
venient and very popular doctrine. But 
Jesus said: 

"Many will say to me in that day„ 
Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in 
thy name? and in thy name have cast 
out devils? and in thy name done 
many wonderful works? 

"And then will I profess unto them, 
I never knew you: depart from me, 
ye that work iniquity." — Matthew 7: 
22 23 

"Not every one that saith unto me, 
Lord, Lord, shall enter into the king- 
dom of heaven; but he that doeth 
the will of my Father which is in 
heaven."— Matthew 7: 21. 

This is the true doctrine of Christ. 
The world today are adopting some of 
the principles revealed to the Prophet 
Joseph Smith. A short time ago a 
great conclave of ministers met at 
Los Angeles for the purpose of remod- 
eling their creed. Did yuu ever hear 
of the prophets of God in any age 
meeting to remodel the revelations of 
God, the Eternal Father, or His Son 
Jesus Christ? He is the same yester- 
day, today and forever. The word 
of God never changes. The Lord our 
God revealed unto His Prophet in this 
day the principle of infant salvation. 
What about infants? Why, it has been 
preached by sectarians for generations, 
that little infants who died without 
being baptized would be damned. Is 
there any man under the sound of my 
voice who can deny that this doctrine 
has been taught? You cannot deny it, 
because it is in the sectarian writings.' 
Yet Joseph Smith proclaimed the doc- 
trine that little children come into the 
world pure and innocent, and they are 
not responsible for sin until they arrive 
at the years of accountaoility. I am 
very glad to see these ministers be- 
ginning to receive a little light. I be- 
lieve there are no men so reluctant to 
get light into their heads as minis-

ters. That is why they have received 
so little during the last sixty years. 
But, they are gradually beginning to 
observe the light; and I am glad they 
have, in a measure, adopted in their 
creed the revelation of God to Joseph 
Smith concerning infants. Another 
thing: Joseph Smith, under the com- 
mand of God, taught the principle of 
tithing, and now some of our Chris- 
tian friends are beginning to recom- 
mend the payment of titning in their 
churches. I tell you the time will come 
when every principle that was revealed 
to Joseph Smith, the Prophet, in this 
last dispensation, will be adopted, one 
by one, until every knee shall bow and 
tevery tongue confess ;that Jesus is 
the Christ, and that Joseph Smith is a 
prophet of the living God. I have just 
had handed to me written evidence of 
what I have said regarding tithing. It 
is a card published by one of the 
churches, and reads as follows: 

GOD'S FINANCIAL PLAN. 

Believing that all Christians should 
systematically and sacredly set aside a 
certain porportion of their income for 
the cause of Christ; and furthermore, 
that it is the plain teaching of God's 
"Word, and His Financial Plan, that 
one-tenth of our income belongs to 
Him; 

Therefore, we hereby covenant with 
God and one another, that we will set 
aside one-tenth of our income, hold it 
as a sacred trust and give it for the 
cause of Christ; 

That we, who make this covenant, by 
attaching our names hereto shall be 
known as members of the Tithing Band 
of the Epworth League, First Methodist 
Episcopal Church of Los Angeles. 
Date Name 

If I had been printing it, I would 
have had it like this: 

"We hereby pledge ourselves, and 
sign our names, as members of Joseph 
Smith the Prophet Tithing League." 
Another thing: If I was going to do 
away with that wicked and corrupt 
doctrine of infant damnation, I would 
not get together a lot of ministers and 
learned men to make a iuss about it, 
as if they had made some wonderful 
discovery; but I would get up like a 
straightforward, honest man, and say, 
Joseph Smith the Prophet taught 
this years ago, I know it is 
true; therefore, let us adopt it. I say 
once more, my brethren and sisters, 



every principle which has been revealed 
to Joseph Smith the Prophet will have 
to be acknowledged by every man, wo- 
man and child who desire to enter into 
the kingdom of our God, or they will 
never get there. This is my testimony 
unto you; for the Lord has spoken. 
This is not the work of man. It is 
not the work of these men who sit 
upon this stand. It is the work of the 
great Jehovah. And that day is at hand 
which was spoken of by the ancient 
prophets, and emphasized by our Lord 
and Savior Jesus Christ, who said: 

"Think not that I am come to destroy 
the law, or the prophets; I am not 
come to destroy, but to fulfill. 

"For verily I say unto you, till heaven 
and earth pass, one jot or one tittle 
shall in no wise pass from the law, till 
all be fulfilled."— Matthew 5: 17, 18. 

There are some portions of the law, 
and some prophecies, that have not 
yet been fulfilled, while others are be- 
ing fulfilled; and the day is at hand 
when these words of the Savior will be 
fully verified. Jeremiah the Prophet, 
after speaking of the scattering of 
Israel, and the curse of David for the 
sin which he committed in the matter 
of the wife of Uriah the Hittite, writes 
these words of the Lord: 

"And I will gather the remnant of my 
flock out of all countries whither I 
have driven them, and will bring them 
again to their folds; and they shall be 
fruitful and increase. 

"And I will set up shepherds over 
them which shall feed them; and they 
shall fear no more, nor be dismayed, 
neither shall they be lacking, saith the 
Lord. 

"Behold, the days come, saith the 
Lord, that I will raise unto David, a 
righteous branch, and a king shall reign 
and prosper, and shall execute judg- 
ment and justice in the earth. 

"In his days Judah shall be saved, 
and Israel shall dwell safely: and this 
is his name whereby he shall be called, 
the Lord our Righteousness. 

"Therefore, behold, the days come, 
saith the Lord, that they shall no more 
say, The Lord liveth, which brought up 
the children of Israel out of the land of 
Egypt; 

"But, The Lord liveth, which brought 
up and which led the seed of the house 
of Israel out of the north country, and 
from all countries whither I had driv- 
en them; and they shall dwell in their 
own lands." — Jeremiah 23: 3-8. 

"Behold, I will send for many fishers, 
saith the Lord, and they shall fish 
them; and after will I send for many

hunters, and they shall hunt them from 
every mountain, and from every hill, 
and out of the holes of the rocks." — 
Jeremiah 16: 16. 

"I will take you one of a city, and 
two of a family, and I will bring you to 
Zion: 

"And I will give you pastors accord- 
ing to mine heart, which shall feed 
you with knowledge and understand- 
ing." — Jeremiah 3: 14, 15. 

My friends, this is the destiny God 
has in store for His people. 

"And it shall come to pass in the 
last days, that the mountain of the 
Lord's house shall be established in the 
top of the mountains, and shall be 
exalted above the hills; and all na- 
tions shall flow unto it. 

"And many people shall go and say, 
Come ye, and let us go up to the 
mountain of the Lord, to the house of 
the God of Jacob; and he will teach us 
of his ways, and we will walk in his 
paths; for out of Zion shall go forth 
the law, and the word of the Lord from 
Jerusalem." — Isaiah 2: 2, 3. 

This is the word of God, and the 
gathering is now taking place. Jesus 
would have gathered the people in His 
day, but they would not receive Him: 
He said: 

"O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that 
killest the prophets, and stonest them 
which are sent unto thee, how often 
would I have gathered thy children to- 
gether, even as a hen gathereth her 
chickens under her wings, and ye would 
not!"— Matthew 23: 37. 

The day, my friends, has arrived 
when Israel is being gathered from the 
four corners of the earth, and when 
Zion is arising and will shine, and 
will become the light and brightness of 
the whole earth. This is the work 
spoken of by the Prophet Daniel. He 
saw that "a stone was cut out of the 
mountain without hands," which "be- 
came a great mountain, and filled the 
whole earth." The proclamation of this 
work will go from nation to nation, 
until every soul that lives upon the 
earth will have the privilege of hear- 
ing the sound thereof, and every honest 
man and woman will have the privilege 
of embracing it and becoming heirs 
of God and joint heirs with Jesus 
Christ. The blood of our Lord and Sa- 
vior was split, that He might 
redeem mankind, and it is only 
through His name we can be saved. 



My brethren and sisters, the work is 
growing. We have still a great work 
to perform, and we should not waste 
our time on hypnotism, or Christian 
Science, or evolution, and such things. 
We have believers in evolution in our 
midst, and there is a little "blight upon 
the top of the trees" in this regard. As 
a servant of God I tell you mankind 
can not be redeemed, worlds without 
end; can not evolve, r crystalize, or 
get into the condition entitling them 
to become heirs of God and joint heirs 
with Jesus Christ, and to partake of 
the fulness of His glory; can not go 
on to perfection, and sit down in the 
councils of heaven with Abraham, 
Isaac and Jacob, and those bright in- 
telligences who created this world and 
others, only through the Gospel of 
the Lord Jesus Christ. All the evolu- 
tion in the world will not save a single 
soul; neither will all the Christian Sci- 
ence, neither will spiritualism, nor hyp- 
notism, nor any other ism that is not 
of God. The Gospel of Christ is so 
plain that a wayfaring man, though a 
fool, need not err therein. Do you 
think the Lord was mistaken when He 
said light had come into the world, and 
that the children of sin might be known 
by their rejection of the light? Some 
of them acknowledge the principle of 
infant salvation, and some will receive 
the principle of tithing; but what is 
the effect of it? Just like the Savior 
said— they put a new patch on an old 
garment, and it only makes it the 
more unsightly. W\en they begin to 
accept the principle of tithing, the ques- 
tion arises, Where is your Prophet, 
the mouthpiece of the Lord, to guide 
and direct the people in the use of 
tithing? Some of them, I suppose, will 
have to go to the Pope or someone else 
to get instructions. Let me say to 
you, these are matters which should be 
considered seriously. If you allow any 
man or woman to coi.ie into your house 
and teach false docrrme, you are re- 
sponsible. I do not want anyone to 
come into my house and teach doc- 
trines that are not of God. Just as soon 
as I hear of them coming I lift up my 
voice against them. The idea of peo- 



ELDER JOHN W. TAYLOR. 



45 



pie assuming to teach the Latter-day 
Saints principles of salvation is to me 
the very height of absurdity. "We are 
commanded to live by every word that 
proceedeth from the mouth of God. 
Then if I want the word of God con- 
cerning His kingdom, to whom shall I 
go? To His mouthpiece. I will go to 
President Joseph F. Smith and say, 
What is the word of the Lord con- 
cerning this matter? That is my duty, 
for he is the mouthpiece of the Lord, 
and it is his right to direct me, to 
bless me when I keep the command- 
ments of God, and to admonish and 
correct me when I do not. 

My brethren and sisters, let us walk 
in the ligh: o! the everlasting Gospel, 
and not be cherishing a dead faith. Let 
us not be haggling and talking about 
other religions, but be active members 
in the Church of Christ, doing our duty 
in all things, and setting examples be- 
fore the children of men that shall be 
worthy of their imitation. If we are 
called to go and build up a Stake of 
Zion, let us do it. If we are called to 
build a temple, let us be on hand to 
fulfill the requirement. If we are 
called upon to build a sugar factory, let 
us willingly respond. If we are called 
upon to build a city, town or village, 
let us do that. That is the Spirit of 
the Gospel, as I understand it. Joseph 
Smith the Prophet said: Show me a 
man or woman who has the spirit of 
the Gospel within them, and I will 
show you a man or woman whose 
greatest desire is to build up the king- 
dom of God upon the earth. Jesus ad- 
monished His disciples not to seek 
after houses and lands, gold and sil- 
ver, but to "seek first the kingdom of 
God, and His righteousness, and all 
these things shall be added unto you." 
Do we want anything more than that? 

There are some people among the 
Latter-day Saints who have a little- 
blight upon them in another way. When 
Lehi, in his vision, saw those who par- 
took of the fruit of the tree of life, he 
beheld that the great multitude point- 
ed the finger of scorn at them, inso- 
much that some turned their faces 
away and felt ashamed. I say, never 
let the blush of shame come upon your 



countenance on account of having kept 
the commandments of God. He will 
sustain you, and give you strength ac- 
cording to your day. 

I feel well in my labors in the 
Church of Christ. I am thankful I am 
considered worthy to be numbered 
amongst you; and I hope to be humble 
and diligent in the performance of 
my duty as an Apostle of the Lord. 
Jesus Christ. I trust there will be no 
duty required of me that I will not be 
able to respond to. We all should fftel 
alike in regard to these things. The 
Lord is no respecter of persons. He 
thinks just as much of you as He does 
of me. Which of you having children 
can justly say, I love this one, and 
hate the other? Neither is it so with 
our Father in heaven. He loves all 
His sons and daughters, and is willing 
to open the windows of heaven and 
pour out blessings upon our heads that 
we shall not have room to receive. But 
no blessing will come unto the children 
of men, except by obedience to law. 
"Blessed are they that hunger and 
thirst after righteousness; for they 
shall be filled with the Holy Ghost." 
'"Blessed are the peacemakers; for 
they shall be called the children of God." 
etc. Let us not attempt take any part 
of the Church of Christ away, nor 
add anything thereto. Let us accept 
it in all its beautiful symmetry; and 
then work in harmony with the author- 
ities whom God has placed in His 
Church. Who are they? There need 
be no question about that, the Apostle 
said: "God hath set some in the 
church.first apostles, secondarily proph- 
ets, thirdly teachers," etc. What for? 
"For the perfecting of the Saints, for 
the work of the ministry, for the edify- 
ing of the body of Christ." Our Lord 
and Savior Jesus Christ laid His hands 
upon Peter and said unto him: 

"And I say also unto thee, That thou 
art Peter, and upon this rock I will 
build my church; and the gates of hell 
shall not prevail against it. 

"And I will give unto thee the keys 
of the kingdom of heaven; and what- 
soever thou shalt bind on earth shall 
be bound in heaven; and whatsoever 
thou shalt loose on earth shall be 
loosed in heaven."

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



The other day I heard of a young 
man — an exemplary young man as far 
as I can understand — who was about 
to marry a wife, and he was so busy 
with his labors (he is a school teacher, 
I think) that he had not time to go 
to the temple — which was only half a 
days journey — to be sealed with an 
eternal union and bond that never 
should be broken; but he intended to 
pass by the temple, go to the court 
house, get out a license, and there be 
married for time. Do you not know 
that people married for time are among

times they were married for time and 
eternity. God bless you. Amen.

ELDER WILLIAM H. LEWIS. 
(President of Benson Stake.) 

I take pleasure in reporting the Ben- 
son Stake in this Conference, and I 
trust that my remarks may be dictated 
by the Spirit of Almighty God. 

The Benson stake of Zion is situated 
near the north boundary line of the 
state; and there are seven wards in it, 
which formerly belonged to Cache 
Stake. The population of the Stake is 
about six thousand. This season we 
have been blessed with a reasonably 
good harvest on the east side and in 
the center of the valley; but on the 
west side of the valley, which is an 
arid district without water, the crops 
have not been so good. We are endeav- 
oring to keep pace with the other 
Stakes of Zion, in observing the in- 
structions that ar e given by the ser- 
vants of God. At Richmond we have 
in course of erection, and nearing com- 
pletion, a condensed milk factory, which 
we anticipate will furnish employment 
for a large number of people, so that 
the young people need not have to go 
far to find work. We are mainly an 
agricultural community; farming and 
dairying constitute our chief occupa- 
tions. From a financial standpoint, the 



people are fairly prosperous. On the 
west side of the valley, we have in 
course of construction a canal, upon 
which has been expended $120,000, and 
we are still bending our efforts in that 
direction, that we may increase facili- 
ties to make successful and pleasant 
homes for the Latter-day Saints. There 
is a great deal of good farming coun- 
try that has not been brought to the 
state of high cultivation we hope to see 
it attain in the near future. We feel 
it our mission to do all the good we can 
for the people of whom we are a part; 
our united efforts are to build up Zion. 
In the north part of the valley, lands 
have been purchased with a view to 
the erection of a sugar factory. The 
project has not taken practical shape 
at the present time, but it is progress- 
ing in a fair way. We believe it is an 
enterprise that would help to develop 
the resources of the country. 

The people as a rule, have paid a good 
proportion of tithing; we cannot say 
yet what it will amount to this year. 

The presidency of the Stake meet to- 
gether once a week, on Thursday even- 
ings, and discuss matters pertaining to 
the spiritual and temporal interests of 
the people. The presiding authorities 
are united, and our efforts are to bene- 
fit the people over whom we preside. 
The High Counselors are good men, and 
we meet with them once a month. The 
members of the High Council visit 
among the people as home missionaries, 
and we aim to have return missionaries 
who come home filled with the spirit of 
their calling, act in this capacity also. 
We release them at the end of six 
months, and appoint others. The quor- 
ums and auxiliary organizations are in 
good working order, and the officers of 
the various societies visitthe settlements 
every week or two, in the interest of 
their respective organizations. They 
are endeavoring to carry out the in- 
structions given by the general boards. 
There has been and is a disposition on 
the part of some of the people, I have 
thought, to incur debt beyond their fin- 
ancial ability to make payment. We 
have warned them earnestly in regard 
to the bondage of debt, and advised 
them to extricate themselves. Where

their homes are mortgaged, they are 
urged to raise the mortgages as quickly 
as possible; a nd not get anything they 
cannot pay for, so that they may be 
free to go and preach the Gospel when 
called upon, either at home or abroad, 
We have a generally good people in the 
Ben s on Stake. The presidency, the mis- 
sionaries, and others who have to labor 
among the people, can go to the farthest 
settlement, hold two meetings, and re- 
turn the same day, the distance being 
only about IS miles. We think it not a 
great task to go that far. Before Cache 
Stake was divided, some of us had to 
go 20 miles to Logan. Whatever is 
necessary to do in the interest of our 
Stake, we hope to be able to do it. 

I bear my testimony that this is the 
work of Almighty God, and that it 
has come to stay. There is nothing of 
value to me outside of His kingdom. I 
know that Joseph Smith was truly a 
Prophet, and that Brigham Young, 'John 
Taylor, Wilford Woodruff, Lorenzo 
Snow and Joseph F. Smith are hi s law- 
ful successors. I pray that God m a y 
bless those who are endeavoring to roll 
on His work and to establish His pur- 
poses in the earth, and give them wis- 
dom and power to do so to their entire 
satisfaction, and to the approval of the 
Master. That this may be our happy 
lot, I a sk in the name of Jesus Christ 
our Lord. Amen. 

ELDER DAVID CAMERON, 
(President of Panguitch Stake.) 

My brethren and sisters, it is a lit- 
tle surprise to me to be called today to 
report the Panguitch stake, as I report- 
ed it at the last conference; but I am 
pleased and willing to do so again. In 
meeting with the people in general con- 
ference, and receiving the Spirit of the 
Lord, I always feel an increased deter- 
mination to do better in the future than 
I have in the past. 

The Panguitch stake is located in the 
southern part of Utah, adjoining Ari- 
zona. We have ten wards and one 
branch, and a little over 3,600 souls. 
The ward closest to the town of Pan- 
guitch is about 20 miles distant, the 
farthest one is about 70. It is a journey 



of about 200 miles to go around the 
Panguitch stake. We do not calculate 
on visiting all the wards on one trip; 
for we try to arrange to visit the peo- 
ple, as much as possible, on Sundays, 
consequently, it takes from two to four 
days to visit each ward. We have, in a 
general sense, a good people in Pan- 
guitch stake; nevertheless, there are 
some who are not living up to the re- 
quirements of the Gospel. There - are 
individuals on the records of the Church 
who take no interest whatever in the 
work; they pay no tithing, and do none 
of the works pertaining to the Gospel. 
The teachers visit them, but T hw- 
heard some of the teachers remark 
they were about tired visiting certain 
families or individuals. We are re- 
quired to visit every non-tithepayer in 
the stake. Some who are visited give 
reasons for not paying, and they are 
reported to the Presiding Bishop; oth- 
ers state they do not believe in the 
principle. I have wondered if such in- 
dividuals should be allowed to remain 
as members of the Church; apparently 
they cannot be converted. The stake 
report goes to the Presiding Bishop's 
office, with a record of tithepayers, part 
tithepayers, and non-tithepayers, and 
not only is every individual judged ac- 
cording to his works, but the stake is 
judged also. I have said to such people 
that if they do not propose to keep 
the laws of God, they should ask to be 
separated from the Church, because it 
is a detriment for them to remain mem- 
bers and do nothing. We have in our 
stake about 60 missionaries; they visit 
the various wards once a month. Every 
ward in the stake is visited on the same 
Sabbath; if any of the missionaries are 
unable to visit on the appointed Sab- 
bath, they notify the Bishop of the 
ward, and inform him when they will 
visit. As far as our tithing is con- 
cerned, we cannot tell anything about 
this year's payments. Last year's was 
a little less than usual. There were 
various reasons for this shortage, the 
principal one being the drouth. 

I remember many years ago, when I 
was a boy, hearing President Young 
state in Provo, where I lived, some- 
thing like this: "Some people may think

GENERAL, CONFERENCE. 



I am not leading the Church aright. 
Now, I will tell you how you may- 
know when I do not lead the Church 
aright. The Lord will just nip my wind; 
for He will never allow any man to 
lead this Church astray." I have had a 
great deal of confidence in that say- 
ing, and I have not been the least 
alarmed in regard to the leading of this 
Church. I know it is the Church of 
Christ; I know that Joseph Smith was 
a prophet; and I know, if we live ac- 
cording to the requirements of the Gos- 
pel, we will be saved and exalted. That 
God may bless us and give us His 
Spirit, that we may observe His laws 
and keep His commandments, is mj* 
prayer in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER GEORGE TEASDALE. 

Should be In harmony with divine teachings — 
, Promises to the faithful — A marvelous work — 
Obedient entiilcd to a testimony of the truth — 
Training in the family circle. 

While listening to the instructions 
given, especially this morning, with re- 
gard to the false influences that are in 
the world, it brought to my mind a 
revelation that was given in 1831. You 
will find it in the 46th section of the 
Book of Doctrine and Covenants; I will 
commence reading at the 7th verse: 

"But ye are commanded in all things 
to ask of God, who giveth liberally; and 
that which the Spirit testifies unto you, 
even so I would that ye should do in 
all holiness of heart, walking upright- 
ly before me, considering the end of 
your salvation, doing all things with 
prayer and thanksgiving, that we may 
not be seduced by evil spirits, or doc- 
trines of devils, or the commandments 
of men for some are of men, and others 
of devils. 

"Wherefore, beware lest ye be de- 
ceived; and that ye may not be de- 
ceived seek ye earnestly the best gifts, 
always remembering for what they are 
given." 

When the Lord commenced this "mar- 
velous work and a wonder," He gave 
some instruction to all who became 
members of His Church. You will find 
in the fourth section of the Book of 
Doctrine and Covenants, commencing 
at the 2nd verse, these words: 

"Therefore, O ye that embark in the 
service of God, see that ye serve Him 
with all your heart, might, mind and 



strength, that ye may stand blameless 
before God at the last day. 

"Therefore if ye have desires to serve 
God, ye are called to the work." 

What work? Why, this "marvelous 
work and a wonder" that the Lord 
said He was going to usher in among 
the children of men. This revelation 
was given in 1829, and the Lord said, 
"Now, behold, a marvelous work is 
about to come forth among the children 
of men." The revelation continues: 

"And faith hope, charity and love, 
with an eye single to the glory of 
God, qualify him for the work. 

"Remember faith, virtue, knowledge, 
temperance patience brotherly kindness, 
godliness, charity, humility, diligence. 

"Ask and ye shall receive knock and 
it shall be opened unto you." 

I regard these as precious instructions 
that have come unto the members of 
the Church of Christ, in order that by 
their observance they may make their 
calling and election sure. I fear we do 
not sufficiently value the blessing that 
has been bestowed upon us in having 
the privilege of living upon the earth 
in the dispensation of the fulness of 
times; nor fully realize the need of be- 
ing in harmony with these choice prin- 
ciples that the Lord has revealed; nor 
appreciate as we should the precious 
promises made to those who love Him 
and keep Hs commandments. In con- 
nection with this, I want to refer to the 
benefits resulting to us individually 
from keeping the commandments of 
God. I will now read from the 93rd 
section of the Doctrine and Covenants: 

"Verily, thus saith the Lord, it shall 
come to pass that every soul who for- 
saketh their sins and cometh unto me, 
and calleth on my name, and obeyeth 
my voice and keepeth my command- 
ments, shall see my face and know 
that I am." 

I consider this is a most precious 
promise. Of course, in the service of 
i we have something to do. We 
who have been warned, and have a 
living testimony, the Lord requires us 
to be faithful in bearing that testimony, 
so that the nations may be left without 
excuse. We need not say much more 
than state the results of our experience. 
We who were raised in the world, were 
subject to priestcraft, and false doc-

trine, and evil influences, but the Lord, 
in His loving kindness and tender 
mercy, and in the wonderful dispen- 
sations of His providence, brought us 
into His Church. He drew us into the 
fold. Very few of us would have had 
the moral courage to accept, the un- 
popular doctrine of Christ, under the 
circumstances in which we were placed, 
had we not been sustained by the power 
of God; for we are human, and it is 
natural to shrink from being on the 
unpopular side. We like to enjoy the 
good feeling and affection of our rela- 
tives and friends; but when we accept- 
ed the unpopular doctrine of Jesus 
Christ, they looked upon us as being 
deluded, deceived, and subject to 
priestcraft and false doctrine. Well, 
if we had been deceived, would it not 
have been better for them to have tried 
to lead us from the error of our ways, 
instead of condemning us so severely? 
But, we were convinced we had embrac- 
ed the everlasting Gospel,, which the Lord 
had restored to the earth. We en- 
quired of the Lord, and He heard and 
answered our prayers. 

We believe the revelations Joseph 
Smith received from the Almighty, and 
know they did not emanate from ignor- 
ance and superstition. I have read 
some of them to you; surely they can 
not impress anybody that they are false 
doctrines. God is the same yesterday, 
today and forever. Whenever He has 
had a people upon the earth He has 
communicated with them. That is the 
object of the oGspel. How could 
we seek the Lord if we did 
not believe that He lives, and 
that He is a rewarder of 
those who diligently seek Him? How 
could we ask of him if we did not be 
lieve He is our loving Father, our Crea- 
tor; that we ar e in His likeness, and 
are His children, eternal as He Himself 
is? The thought of having the privilege 
to communicate with our Creator 
should be an inspiration to any man or 
woman who desires to be kind to him- 
self or to herself. 

There is no misrepresentation about 
this; simple facts are what we deal 
with. When we declare to the inhabi- 
tants of th e earth that the Lord has 



spoken again from the heavens, has re- 
vealed Himself, and has restored to the 
earth His Church, as He promised, with 
apostles, .prophets, evangelists, pastors 
and teachers, we simply speak the 
truth. In this restoration the Lord 
gave to all the opportunity of obtaining 
redemption from death and hell, and of 
being associated with the "marvelous 
work and a wonder" spoken of by the 
Prophet Isaiah. The Lord said through 
that Prophet: 

"Forasmuch as this people draw near 
me with their mouth, and with their 
lips do honor me, but have removeu 
their heart far from me and their fear 
toward me, is taught by the precept of 
men: 

"Therefore, behold, I will proceed to 
do a marvelous work among this peo- 
ple, even a marvelous work and a won- 
der: for the wisdom of their wise men 
shall perish, and the understanding 
their prudent men shall be hid." — 
Isaiah, 29: 13, 14. 

The Apostle Paul said "the things oi 
God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of 
God," showing that it is necessary for 
us to be taught of God by His Spirit. 
Jesus promised that whoso would do 
the will of the Father should know ot 
th e doctrine. He also said, "Not every 
one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, 
shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; 
but he that doeth the will of my Fath- 
er which is in heaven." The Latter- 
day Saints have received, and are con- 
tinually receiving testimonies. During 
the past 50 years I have heard many 
individuals testify that they knew Jo- 
seph Smith was a true Prophet sent of 
God, they knew Jesus was the Christ, 
and they knew that God the Eternal 
Father lived, by the evidences they 
have had in their individual exper- 
iences. Now, God is no respecter of per- 
sons. We are all His children, and the 
Gospel is being preached in all the 
world for a witness, that all who desire 
eternal life may have the privilege of 
receiving it. Those who are in darkness, 
in idolatry, and under false impres- 
sions, may have the privilege of be- 
holding the light that shines forth. 
They may obtain this living testimony 
by seeking to the Lord for it. Ask of 
God the Eternal Father, in the name of 
Jesus Christ, for light and truth, and 



50

a knowledge as to whether this won- 
derful work is of God. He has promised 
to draw nigh unto those who will draw 
nigh unto Him. God has chosen the 
weak things of the earth "and things 
which are nought, to bring to naught 
things which are." 

We are not a people gifted in the 
wisdom of the world; in fact, it is said 
that the children of this world are 
wiser in their generation than the chil- 
dren of light. But we know what we 
are doing; we know that we have the 
truth. "We know that we can have com- 
munion with the Almighty; we know 
that He hears and answers prayer. In 
every well-regulated family, prayer is 
offered at least twice a day — morning 
and evening. In the morning, when we 
are entering upon the duties of the day, 
if we have wisdom, and understand the 
value of the fellowship of the Spirit of 
God, we naturally ask for what we 
need, and, of course, we go down on 
our knees to do so. If we believe we 
are the children of God, that He hears 
and answers prayer: and that He 
can protect us from all evil, 
naturally we will pray to Him, 
because we want His blessing for 
ourselves, and for our wives and chil- 
dren. We should also pray for those 
upon whom rests the responsibility of 
guiding and directing the affairs of the 
Church of Christ on the earth. Then, 
if we acknowledge the hand of God in 
all things, we will naturally ask a 
blessing on our food, believing that 
the Lord is able to make it nourishing 
and strengthening to us, and impart to 
us the principle of life. He has given 
unto us the "Word of Wisdom for our 
temporal salvation — not by command- 
ment or constraint, but teaching us 
how to live that we may enjoy health, 
and have nerve power to live out our 
full time, and not be guilty of partak- 
ing of anything that will bring dis- 
tress and pain upon us. That shows 
how kind and loving a Father we have, 
He even teaches His children what to 
eat and drink, and what to avoid. 

Because of the way many of us have 
been educated, it was difficult to think 
it possible for us to hold communion 



with the Great Creator of the heavens, 
the earth and the fountains of water. 
But we now know that this is possible. 
We must remember, however, that we 
cannot do anything without His Spirit. 
We must have the fellowship of the Ho- 
ly Ghost, and we can obtain it by right- 
eous conduct, and by asking with an 
honest heart. The Lord knows our 
hearts; He knows our secret lives; He 
understands everything concerning us. 
He hath said to the sinner, "When the 
wicked man turneth away from his 
wickedness that he hath comitted, and 
doeth that which is lawful and right, 
he shall save his soul alive." This is 
a precious promise to the erring chil- 
dren of the Father. Our message to 
the sinner is that if he will repent,cease 
to do evil and learn to do well, he 
shall receive a remission of his sins, 
through obedience to the Gospel and 
dedicating the rest of his life to the 
service of God. What a bright and 
glorious outlook, to be redeemed from 
sin and to have the privilege of walk- 
ing in the light, receiving salvation, and 
obtaining a glorious resurrection! The 
Creator hath given us these glad tid- 
ings of great joy to carry to the people. 
Our testimonies are true. We know 
we shall have to meet the people to 
whom we have borne testimony, and 
then they will know most assuredly 
that we taught them the truth. All 
the faithful advocates of the Church 
of Christ have a living testimony con- 
cerning this work. The Lord desires 
to establish His righteousness upon the 
earth, and to make us better individual- 
ly. We have an individuality, and I 
suppose each of us is pretty well satis- 
fied with it: I don't know that any of 
us ever wanted to be anybody else. The 
object of the Gospel is to improve that 
individuality. 

I say to this congregation there is 
but one Lord, one faith, one. baptism, 
one Go i and Father of us all, we all 
have to submit to the same conditions. 
The Lord Jesus Christ said, when John 
objected to baptizing Him, "Suffer it 
to be so now; for thus it becometh us 
to fulfill all righteousness." Well, we 
must fulfill "all righteousness." We 



ELDER GEORGE TEASDALE. 



51 



must have faith in the living and true 
God, and in the atonement of Jesus 
Christ, and worship God in His name. 
These conditions are common to all the 
world, and must be complied with by 
those who desire to be redeemed. It is 
also essential that we repent, and offer 
unto the Lord a broken heart and a 
contrite spirit. It is necessary that we 
be baptized by immersion, for the re- 
mission of sins, that we be born of the 
water, and thus be fitted and prepared 
for sanctification by the blood of Christ. 
Then, we must receive the gift of the 
Holy Ghost. It is the only way by 
which mankind can be redeemed, and 
obtain a glorious resurrection. Then 
we will be in harmony with the eternal 
principles of the Gospel. 

The family altar should be in every 
man's house; he is the patriarch of the 
family, and everything should be 
done under his direction. He 
should offer prayer; his wife and 
children also should offer prayer 
in turn around the family altar. Tou 
cannot be a Saint without the fellow- 
ship of the Spirit of God; and you 
should train your children that they 
also may know the benefit of having 
its fellowship. We have embarked in 
the service of God, and He desires us 
to obey Him and keep His command- 
ments. He hath said, "Ye are com- 
manded in all things to ask of God, 
who giveth liberally, and upbraideth 
not." Now, you know whether you do 
this or not, and whether you train 
your children to do it. You know if 
the voice of prayer, thanksgiving and 
praise is heard in your habitations. I 
say that is the wa> to train up our 
children. They have their individual- 
ity, and we cannot give unto them the 
testimony we possess; they have to re- 
ceive the light in the same way we re- 
ceived it. They have to receive reve- 
lation from the source from 
which we obtained it. The only 
way we can help them in this 
matter is to manifest unto them that 
we believe in God, and in the worship 
of God; and tell them what they should 
ask for. If we train our children 
properly, they won't go far astray. It 
is the duty of the wife when 



the husband is away, to con- 
tinue prayers and the worship 
of God in the household, and 
to see that the children are properly 
trained, and are taught the law of 
tithing, and the other es&ential princi- 
ples of the Gospel. 

The law of tithing is a divine law. 
The Lord does not require more of 
one than of another. One-tenth is re- 
quired of all, no matter what our cir- 
cumstances may be. A man is no friend 
to himself if he rejects the laws of God. 
He is unkind to himself when he ig- 
nores principles that lead to everlast- 
ing life. I would not for the world be 
without the living testimony that God 
has given to me; the voice of thanks- 
giving and praise is heard from me, 
because I am grateful for that testi- 
mony. When I think of what I might 
have been, if I had been left in the 
beggarly elements of the world; and 
when I think that God, in His loving 
kindness, brought me out of the world, 
and gave me the moral courage to en- 
dure contumely, and to be evil spoken 
of, I feel to praise and glorify His holy 
name. 

I pray God that the spirit of this con- 
ference may be and abide with us. I 
pray that we may remain converted, 
and that we may serve the Lord with 
full purpose of heart, doing His will 
and keeping His commandments, that 
His name may be glorified, through 
Jesus Christ. Amen.

GENERAL CONFERENCE.

ELDER M. F. COWLEY. 

The Saints responsible to .God- How we are re- 
garded by the world— United order versus so- 
cialism—Necessity of exact compliance with 
law of tithing — Development of natural re- 
sources — Important general duties. 

My beloved brethren and sisters.I re 
joice with you in the privilege of at- 
tending this conference, and, feeling 
my weakness in standing before you. I 
am anxious that you will sustain ma 
by your prayers of faith, that the 
Holy Spirit may suggest, as He has 
done to the other brethren, what ought 
to be said. 

Many good things are said to us. and 
the benefit that we shall derive from 
them will depend upon the use we make 
of them. We should not be hearers of 
the word alone; we should be doers 
of it. It is the doing of the word of 
God, the keeping of His commandments 
in all things, that will count to our 
credit, to our salvation from the evils 
of this life, and to our complete re- 
demption from the effects of sin and 
the fall, in the life which is to come. 

This is a practical work. It is a work 
in which every individual should feel 
a personal responbility — a responsibil- 
ity that awakens a consciousness in 
our souls that God expects something 
of us, and that we are accountable 
to Him for the light which we have re- 
ceived. We are indebted to the 
Lord, and not to man, for the light 
that we have, and for the situation that 
we occupy before the world in a re- 
ligious sense. I claim that every 
favorable condition surrounding the 
Latter-day Saints and every blessing 
we enjoy, whether it be spiritual or 
temporal, is due to the Gospel and the 
great work God has established. Our 
situation in these mountains is not the 
result of the wisdom of man. A gen- 
tleman said to me the other day, as 
we were coming through Echo, "When 
Brigham Young established himself 
and his people in these mountain val- 
leys he made no mistake. He under- 
stood that it was the best spot of earth 
between the Missouri river and the 
Pacific coast, and was the place for the 
people." Of course, he told the truth, 
but he did not wish to acknowledge 
that President Brigham Young was 



guided in the selection of this land by 
the spirit of revelation from God. He 
did not feel to acknowledge that God 
had His hand in it at all. It is the 
same in regard to every other feature 
of this work. We had pointed out to 
us this morning very clearly, througn 
the inspiration of the Holy Ghost upot* 
Elder Taylor, how that the Gospel, re- 
stored through the Prophet Joseph 
Smith, is affecting the religious 
world. This is true, and they are prov- 
ing that Joseph Smith was a Prophet 
of God, whether they believe it or not. 
But they are not adopting our ideas 
for the purpose of drawing interest to 
this work, or of establishing any dispo- 
sition in the hearts of the people to in- 
vestigate what they call "Mormon- 
ism." They have no such purpose in 
view. And in this connection I want 
to say to the Latter-day Saints that 
understanding as we do that these 
truths have emanated from God, » and 
have been presented to us in His rev- 
elations to the Prophet Joseph 
Smith, we ought not to be so blind as 
to go off after some kind of a side 
issue. 

I met a brother some time ago who 
was quite prominent in the community 
where he lived, and he had organized a 
little socialistic party, which, I sup- 
pose, from a political standpoint, he 
had a right to do; but he told me that 
all the people ought to be socialists, 
for the reason that socialism, he said, 
is the United Order, and the more we 
can get .to join the Socialist party the 
easier it will be to establish the United 
Order when the time comes. I had to 
ask him if he was so blind as to be- 
lieve that after God has revealed the 
principles of the United Order, and the 
people are not prepared to carry them 
out, you can go to some institution of 
the world and find those principles and 
exemplify them for the benefit of man- 
kind. I told him that no matter how 
near the world come to the 
theories of the Gospel, no matter how 
much they try to establish them, with- 
out the Spirit of the Gospel and the 
authority of the Holy Priesthood they 
never can carry them out, worlds with- 
out end. Humanity is too selfish to

carry out these great laws of God. The 
disposition of the world to accept some 
of the theories and doctrines of the 
Gospel as enunciated by the Prophet 
Joseph Smith over 70 years ago, is de- 
signed by the adversary as a delusion 
more than anything else. I remember 
trying to show a preacher that these 
doctrines, some of which he claimed to 
believe, had been advanced by the 
Prophet Joseph Smith over 70 years 
ago. He wanted to deny it, but could 
not bring the proof to sustain his 
denial. He said that the principle of 
the redemption of the dead was inti- 
mated by some theologians before the 
days of Joseph Smith. In this way they 
are trying to keep the people from the 
fountain of truth. In effect they say 
to the people: We have the law of 
tithing, we have the doctrine of the 
atonement of Christ, and we believe in 
infant salvation, and you need not join 
the Latter-day Saints for these doc- 
trines. They are commencing to say 
that they have the doctrine of the re- 
demption of the dead, and that the 
spirts are preached to in the spirit 
world, and it is not necessary to go to 
the Latter-day Saints to find out those 
things. By this means they are seek- 
ing to keep the people in the dark and 
away from the authority of God where 
the ordinances of eternal life are" to 
be found. 

With the testimony that we have of 
the divine mission of the Prophet Jo- 
seph Smith, I say that no Latter-day 
Saint is justified in going after these 
spirts and following after these insti- 
tutions in the world, whether they be 
of a spiritual or of a temporal na- 
ture. God has established His work, 
and within it is found every element 
that is essential for the salvation of 
the people, temporally and spirtually. 
The Lord has revealed unto us 
a plan of temporal salvation. 
He has given us the law of 
tithing. He has said that if we abide 
by that law this land shall be a land of 
Zion unto us, and by this law it shall 
be consecrated. This is the word of 
the Lord to the Latter-day Saints, 
and in connection with it He 
has promised that the seed of the 



righteous shall never be found begging 
for bread. Have we faith, my brethren 
and sisters, to carry out the laws 
of God, that we may enjoy the bless- 
ings which come from obedience there- 
to? As has been stated, men of the 
world have discernment enough to see 
that there is some power in this work 
which they do not comprehend. One 
of our leading senators, who is now 
deceased, made the statement in Cali- 
fornia that the "Mormon" Church was 
the only religious institution on earth 
that contemplated the temporal salva- 
tion of its members. He stated that 
in the city of San Francisco were 
people reveling in wealth, while side 
by side with them were others in the 
dregs of poverty; but the "Mormon" 
Church, he said, looked after the poor. 
By their law of tithing they see that 
no one suffers, they build their temples 
and their sacred houses; and after 
awhile, by their law of consecration 
and stewardship they claim to have a 
union in spiritual and temporal things 
that will bind the people together com- 
pletely. 

My brethren and sisters, it is our 
duty to keep these glorious principles 
in view. I do not know of any path 
of safety for the Latter-day Saints, 
only that which finds us in the dis- 
charge of every duty. When our tith- 
ing is due, we should pay it, and not 
put it off to the end of the year. If 
we use that which belongs to the Lord, 
when we come to settle our tithing it 
will not be on hand, and in all proba- 
bility we shall find ourselves unable to 
pay an honest tithing. Those who have 
indulged in this practise ought to re- 
pent of it. We should pay our tithes 
when our substance comes to us. And 
we should pay in kind, and not sub 
stitute something that is inferior to 
that which we ought to pay. In an- 
cient times the Lord forbade this. I 
recall that the Lord actually pronounc- 
ed a curse upon anyone who would of- 
fer as a sacrifice anything that had a 
blemish, or that was old and useless. 
It was designed that the offering should 
be clean and pure and without blemish, 
that it might symbolize in the best pos- 
sible manner the offering of the Son of 



54 



GENERAL. CONFERENCE. 



God. The law of tithing is similar. God 
does not demand of us the very best, 
and yet He would not be displeased 
if we were disposed to offer the best; 
but He is not pleased when we select 
from our substance that which is the 
poorest and bring it into His store- 
house. You perhaps remember the 
law in ancient Israel regarding the se- 
lection of animals that were to be con- 
secrated as tithing. The Lord said, 
that every one that passed under the 
rod should be holy to the Lord. As 
I undertstand this, they had what we 
would call a corral, and as the animals 
passed out one at the time, every tenth 
one was marked by a rod in the hands 
of the man who stood at the entrance, 
and that one was holy unto the Lord. 
He did not demand the best, nor did He 
justify the selection of the poorest; but 
He dealt fairly with the people. Yet 
He has dealt with us far more gen- 
erously than He did with ancient Is- 
rael. When we think of how He has 
blessed us in this glorious land — how 
the people are extended from Canada 
on the north to Mexico on the south — 
Fifty-one stakes of Zion— and how we 
have increased and prospered, surely 
He has blessed us exceedingly. 

I almost shudder sometimes when I 
hoar men say they have made great 
sacrifices for the Gospel's sake. Have 
we made any sacrifice for the Gospel's 
sake? Is it a sacrifice for a man to lay 
aside his sins? Is it a sacrifice for a 
man who is addicted to tobacco, to lay 
it aside? or addicted to liquor, to re- 
pent of that evil? or addicted to pro- 
fanity, to lay that aside and honor 
the name of Deity? or a violator of the 
Sabbath day, or guilty of any vice, to lay 
that aside and purify himself by obedi- 
ence to the laws of God? Why, it is no 
more of a sacrifice to the immortal 
spirit of man than it is to wash our 
bodies when they are unclean. Now, 
I have never been across the ocean, and 
I have not personally witnessed the 
temporal condition of the Saints of 
God in Europe; but I have been in the 
United States, and I have mingled with 
the Saints in various parts of the 



LTnion, and I have found scores and 
scores of families that did not own one 
foot of land, did not own the house 
that covered them, and did not 
own a horse or a cow. They 
were simply tenants. What has 
brought a change to these 
families and made them prosperous in 
these mountain valleys? Has it not 
been the Gospel of Jesus Christ? Has 
it not been the principle of gathering? 
I see the Salvation Army has adopted 
the principle of gathering now. They 
are gathering and colonizing. But it 
is the great work of God that has 
brought us here. Where in all these 
Stakes of Zion are the families that 
have no home of their own? What 
percentage of those living in rural dis- 
tricts do not possess their own homes, 
with teams and cows, and other re- 
sources of employment? How m a ny 
are there in such a destitute condi- 
tion as they were in the world? I will 
venture to say that there are very 
few indeed. And let me say furtner, if 
the Latter-day Saints were prepared to 
carry out the counsel of the servants 
of God there would be a still better con- 
dition among us than there is today, 
speaking from a temporal standpoint. 

You heard what Brother Heber J. 
Grant said yesterday in regard to the 
effort that had to be made to establish 
and maintain one little sugar factory 
in the community. Men feared to in- 
vest for the benefit of the people, and 
the Lord came to the assistance of His 
servants. He inspired President Wood- 
ruff to say that it was the will of the 
Lord that that should not be a failure. 
Nevertheless we had to send outside 
and borrow money of the Gentiles, in 
order to establish that industry; but 
they have been paid back, and the en- 
terprise is a great success. So I say 
we have not sacrificed very much tem- 
porally for the Gospel's sake. When it 
come? to religious matters, what kind 
of houses of worship had we in the 
world? It is only recently that we had 
any of our own at all. Down in the 
Southern States they used to burn them 
up almost as soon as they were built. I 
believe the last one they built was in 



ELDER MATTHIAS P. COWLEY. 



55 



Kentucky, and in order that it might 
not be burned down they insured it; 
but the mob took axes and cattle and 
tore it down, and pulled the logs apart 
with their oxen, in order to beat 
around the protection our people had 
placed upon it. No matter about that; 
as I was saying, our people had very 
few nice houses of worship to meet in 
before they gathered to Zion. What do 
we find here? In almost every ward 
we find a suitable place of worship, 
and we are improving in this direction 
all the time. We have a most beauti- 
ful house in Pocatello — just as good as 
any in Salt Lake City, I believe. They 
are building another one at Wellsville. 
Then, we have not sacrificed anything in 
that direction, have we? And when you 
talk about forsaking father and moth- 
er, sister and brother for the Gospel's 
sake, how much of a sacrifice have we 
made? What did Jesus say to His 
disciples when they asked, "Behold, we 
have forsaken all, and followed thee; 
what shall we have therefore?" He 
said unto them, "Every one that hath 
forsaken houses, or brethren, or sis- 
ters, or father, or mother, or wife, or 
children, or lands, for my name's sake, 
shall receive an hundred fold, and shall 
inherit everlasting life." Maybe you 
forsook your father and mother; may- 
be they turned their backs upon you. 
What if they did? You have come to 
this land and found fathers and moth- 
ers, brothers and sisters, just as the 
Son of God said to His disciples. One 
came unto him and said, "Behold, thy 
mother and thy brethren stand with- 
out, desiring to speak with thee;" ana 
He asked, "Who is my mother? and 
who are my brethren?" Answering the 
question himself, He pointed to His 
disciples and said, '"Behold my mother 
and my brethren! For whosoever shall 
do the will of My Father which is in 
heaven, the same is my brother, and 
sister, and mother." And have you 
not found it thus? What else can we 
say? Why this: that' the man who for- 
sakes his father and mother for the 
Gospel's sake has accepted something 
in the Gospel that will bring his father 
and mother, his sister and brother to 
him, and they will fulfill the words of 



the Prophet Obadiah that "saviors 
shall come up on mount Zion." 

I might say more in this line if there 
were time, but let me say to the Lat- 
ter-day Saints that we ought not to 
talk about sacrificing for the 
Gospel's sake. We ought not to 
forget the obligations we are 
under to God for the great blessings 
that He has bestowed upon us. We 
ought not to be unmindful of the fact 
that it is through the Gospel that all 
these blessings have come unto us. 
Now, it does not matter what the world 
do — whether they are friendly to us or 
not — so far as the work of God is con- 
cerned. It matters to them materially,, 
however, whether they treat the work 
of God properly or not. If they do not. 
treat it right, if they persecute the peo- 
ple of God, woe unto them! for thus 
saith the Lord, I will fight against 
those who fight against Zion. That is 
the word of the Lord to the inhabitants 
of the earth. But whether they op- 
pose it or not.the work of God is onward 
and upward, and the principles of the 
Gospel are spreading abroad among the 
nations of the earth. I am happy to 
say that our Elders bring good reports, 
as a rule. The more they put their 
trust in God and travel without money 
and without price, the better report 
they bring, the stronger testimonies 
they come back with in regard to the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ and the power 
connected with it. 

I rejoice in this work, and in the 
opportunity of mingling my testimony 
with that of my brethren. I know that 
this is the work of God. I know that 
Joseph Smith was a prophet of God. 
I know that the men who have succeed- 
ed him in the Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints have been men of 
God, and that our President today is 
a man of God, a man of righteousness 
and justice, a man of example in the 
Gospel that is worthy of our following 
in every sense of the word. I say to 
the brethren and sisters, do not only 
sustain the presidency of the Church, 
but also sustain your Bishops, sustain 
your stake presidents, sustain your 
ward teachers, and sustain the hum-

GENERAL, CONFERENCE. 



blest in the holy Priesthood whom God 
has appointed unto the work of the 
ministry In the fourth chapter of 
Ephesians Paul names the purpose of 
apostles, prophets, etc. He said they 
were for the work of the ministry, for 
the perfecting of the Saints, and for 
the edifying of the body of Christ, till 
we all come to a unity of the faith. 
But he mentions another purpose— a 
very distinct purpose, and I thought, in 
listening to the remarks of Elder Tay- 
lor, that it was a very important pur- 
pose among the Latter-day Saints. The 
purpose is, "that we henceforth be no 
more children, tossed to and fro, and car- 
ried about with every wind of doctrine, 
by the sleight of men, and cunning 
craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to 
deceive." My brethren and sisters, if 
you will bear in mind that purpose, 
and follow the ordained ministry that 
God has established in your midst, you 
will not go astray. Follow their coun- 
sel, pay yo.ur tithes and offerings, and 
sustain the work of God temporally and 
spiritually, and I am willing to promise 
you, in the name of the Lord, that you 
will not be led astray by the winds of 
doctrine that are going forth in the 
land. If you do not do this, you will 
be led away. We want men and wo- 
men who accept the Gospel in its ful- 
ness; good, substantial Latter-day 
Saints; not those who, like the world, 
make a hobby of one principle and 
neglect all others, but Latter-day 
Saints who, if they go on missions and- 
are greatly blessed by the outpouring 
of the Holy Spirit, are willing on their 
return to be ward teachers, or Sunday 
school teachers, or Deacons in the 
house of the Lord, and not expect to 
occupy all their time in standing be- 
fore the people and preaching big ser- 
mons. Some of the best Latter-day 
Saints we have do not say much, but 
they do a great deal. The thing for us 
to do is to go to work, and we need 
not talk about it either. When we 
pay our tithing, we need not sound a 
trumpet before us. When we pay our 
fast offerings we need not publish it 
in the papers. But do our duty, honor 
God and keep His commandments, and 



say nothing about it. The Lord will 
see us, and He will bless us. The Son 
of God pointed out the hypocrisy of the 
world in this direction. He said, "They 
love to pray standing in the synagogues 
and on the corners of the streets, 
that they may be seen of men. 
Verily I say unto you. They have their 
reward. But thou, when thou prayest, 
enter into they closet, and when thou 
hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father 
which is in secret, and they Father 
which seeth in secret shall reward thee 
openly." Remember that, my brethren 
and sisters, and seek God in secret 
prayer. And when I say this to you, I 
say it to myself also. 

Before I close, I w r ant to ask the Lat- 
ter-day Saints to sustain the religion 
classes of this Church. I say that we 
need them. There is no family in the 
Church so perfect in its family gov- 
ernment, no man and no woman has 
such unbounded influence over their 
families, but what these auxiliary insti- 
tutions will be of some benefit unto 
them. 

I want to say another thing. I said it 
yesterday in the Assembly Hall, and 
the Lord revealed it to me while I was 
upon my feet. If any of you have any 
grievances with your brethren or your 
sisters; if any of you stand adverse to 
the authorities of your Ward or Stake, 
or have anything against them, I ask 
you not to talk about it before your 
children. If you do, you will poison 
the minds of your children against the 
work of God, and the day will come 
when you will wish that you could draw 
it back. You will have cause to be sor- 
ry for their condition, and you will have 
a consciousness that you have helped to 
poison their minds against the servants 
of God and against the principles of di- 
vine truth. Remember this. It is the 
simple things that will secure our safe- 
ty. It is the little foxes that spoil the 
vines, Solomon and Bishop Reuben Mil- 
ler used to say. It is the performance 
of the little duties that will establish us 
in the work of God. 

God bless you, my brethren and sisters. 
May you return to your homes renewed 
in your determination to serve God. 
Sustain the religion class work, and all

the institutions that the Lord has es- 
tablished in the work of God, and God 
Himself will sustain you by His power 
in time and in all eternity. Amen.

The sin of idleness— Arduous duties of the Firs 
Presidency, the Tweive, Seven Presidents or 
Seventies, Presiding Bishopric and other quo- 
ums of the Priesthood. 

Brethren and. sisters, I trust that I 
shall be able to make you hear. I 
have rejoiced exceedingly in the spirit 
and teachings of this conference. We 
have had a rich outpouring of the Holy 
Spirit, and we are indeed a blessed 
people. 

While sitting here, the thought oc- 
curred to me that the system and or- 
der of the Priesthood in this Church 
is so perfect, there is no need for any 
of us to waste time; and it would be a 
shame for a man in this Church, hold- 
ing any portion of the holy Priesthood, 
to say he had nothing to do. It is 
a mistaken idea for any man to enter- 
tain, for there is plenty to do. I re- 
member, reading in one of the revela- 
tions, a passage that bears upon this 
point. You will find it in Section 107 
of the Book of Doctrine and Covenants, 
and these are the closing words of the 
revelation: 

"Wherefore now let every man learn 
his duty, and to act in the office in 
which he is appointed, in all diligence. 

"He that is slothful shall not be 
counted worthy to stand, and he that 
learns not his duty and shows himself 
not approved, shall not be counted wor- 
thy to stand." 

In another revelation — Section 68 — 
these words occur: 

"And the inhabitants of Zion, also, 
shall remember their labors, inasmuch 
as they are appointed to labor, in all 
faithfulness; for the idler shall be had 
in remembrance before the Lord." 

Again, in Section 75: 

"Let every man be diligent in all 
things. And the idler shall not have 
place in the Church, except he repents 
and mends his ways." 

From these passages, we can see that 
idleness is a positive sin, and that those 
who indulge in this spirit, to the neg- 



lect of their- duties, shall be found un- 
worthy of fellowship in the Church. 

Brethren and sisters, if I can have 
the freedom of the Spirit, I would like 
to make a brief report concerning some 
of the general authorities of the 
Church. I think the Saints are justi- 
fied in looking to the general authori- 
ties for an example. If the head is sick, 
the body will also be sick; but if the 
head is wideawake, the body will be 
full of light. This is true of the 
Church in all ages of the world. 

First, I would like to say a word 
about the First Presidency of the 
Church. We have them with us today. 
They are in good health and form. We 
have heard their voices. I think I can 
truthfully say there are no three men 
in the Church who are busier, more in- 
dustrious or whose time is more occu- 
pied, than the Presidency. There is a 
great weight of responsibility resting 
upon them. They are called to stand 
at the head of the Church, and direct 
matters pertaining to fifty-one stakes 
of Zion and fourteen missions. These 
brethren have to consider matters of 
moment that are submitted to them 
from the stakes of Zion. Many writ- 
ten communications of great import- 
ance are received by them, which re- 
quire the most thoughtful considera- 
tion. They are in session almost daily, 
giving their attention to these matters. 
In addition to the very large correspon- 
dence which they have to answer, many 
of the officers of the stakes come in 
person and seek interviews with the 
Presidency of the Church. They must 
be seen; it is their right to be seen; 
they come for counsel on matters of 
moment and interest to the Latter-day 
Saints. Furthermore, many strangers 
call at the president's office, anxious to 
meet the president and his counselors, 
and to shake hands with them. The 
reputation of this people has gone 
abroad to the world, and many emi- 
nent people, in passing through, stop in 
Zion, being anxious to see those who 
preside over this peculiar people. And 
let me say to you, brethren and sisters, 
the stranger within our gates who de- 
sires an interview is never denied. The 



58 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Presidency are very happy to see them, 
talk with them, and bear testimony to 
them. In addition to these arduous and 
strenuous labors, the President 
of the Church presides over 
some very important auxiliary 
organizations. He is the head of the 
great Sunday school organization in 
the Church. We had some evidence of 
its magnitude last night, when this 
Tabernacle was crowded, every seat 
occupied and people standing up, all 
interested in the Sunday scnools. He 
is also general superintendent of the 
Young Men's Mutual Improvement As- 
sociations, which embrace about 28,000 
young men of Israel — a whole army; 
and they acknowledge him as their spe- 
cial leader, counselor and director. He 
is also editor of the "Improvement 
Era") and the "Juvenile Instructor." In 
addition to all this, the President has 
been called— and very fittingly— to 
stand a t the head of some 1 of the great 
temporal institutions of Zion. Does it 
not seem right to you that he has been 
called to represent the great co-oper- 
ative movement that was instituted by 
President Brigham Young, and that 
has accomplished so much good for 
Zion? I refer now to Z. C. M. I. We 
all know about this institution, and 
what it has done for the people. To 
use a common expression, it has "set 
the pace" in business. It has a won- 
derful influence in the business affairs 
of this and other states, in adjusting 
prices, and conducting business in a 
right and proper manner. If you do 
not always trade there, brethren and 
sisters, you want to remember this: 
when you go to other places and get 
low prices, Z. C. M. h has helped to 
establish those prices, by its powerful 
influence. The President has also been 
called to stand at the head of two or 
three sugar factories, which are great 
and prosperous industries, benefitting 
the people of Zion. Therefore, he is not 
only our spiritual leader, but also our 
temporal leader in some important di- 
rections. In our Church the spiritual 
and temporal, it may be said, go hand 
in hand, the dividing line cannot be 
drawn. In addition to all these duties, 
which I have but briefly mentioned, the 



Presidency of the Church often go in- 
to the different Stakes of Zion to visit 
among the people. I cannot under- 
stand how they get the time to do it. 
First, you hear of the Presidency be- 
ing down in Arizona, or in Mexico; 
and next you hear of them in Canada, 
or in the Big Horn country, or in Ore- 
gon. So far as I understant, they are 
very happy indeed to go and mingle 
with the Latter-day Saints, and lift 
their voices in counsel or warning. I 
have sometimes wondered if the Pre- 
sidency realize, to the fullest extent, 
the amount of good accomplished 
through their visits to the Stakes of 
Zion. The Apostles who follow them 
understand it. I reiterate my former 
statement, that there are no three men 
in all Israel who are busier and more 
active than the Presidency of the 
Church. I rejoice in the truth of this 
testimony. 

Now we come to consider the labors 
of the quorum of the Twelve Apostles. 
Let me speak briefly in. relation to the 
quorum, which stands next to the Pres- 
idency. The quorum of tne Twelve 
Apostles meets regularly once a week 
with the Presidency. They meet as a 
quorum every quarter, for three days. 
To the members of the quorum, these 
meetings are of the very highest im- 
portance. The brethren come together 
in order to pray, bear testimony and 
take into consideration such matters 
as may be brought before them. Wher- 
ever duty calls, the Twelve must go. 
They are willing and anxious to visit 
the Saints in Stake conferences, or to go 
into the world. They hold themselves 
in readiness to respond at a moment's 
notice to the calls of the Presidency of 
the Church. When they return from 
such visits, they must render an ac- 
count of their stewardship. The labors 
of each week mwst be reported to the 
Presidency. In this way the Presiden- 
cy of the Church are made familiar 
with conditions in Zion. Let me say, 
there is not a stake in all Zion 
that escapes notice. There is not a 
president of a Stake nor a counselor 
and, in a general way, I may say, 
there is not a Bishop but who 
comes under the notice of the

Presidency of the Church, through these 
reports. We want the brethren in the 
various stakes to understand that their 
labors are appreciated, and that their 
faithfulness is known. And when things 
are all right, oh how grand and beauti- 
ful it is! How pleased the Twelve arc 
to report favorable conditions in the 
stakes of Zion! When anything is 
wrong, when there is a lack of faith- 
fulness upon the part of any holding 
the Priesthood in the stakes of Zion, it 
is known; and known only to be cor- 
rected. We would like the people to un- 
derstand that the Priesthood is mind- 
ful of them. We know your faithful- 
ness; and where there is indifference, 
we are aware of it. Although existing 
evils may not be corrected at once, let 
me say to you that generally they are 
known and discussed in the councils of 
the Holy Priesthood. The Twelve es- 
teem it as binding upon them, when in 
the city, to be present at their meet- 
ings. They regard it as one of their 
highest duties; they feel they must be 
there, unless perchance there is sick- 
ness or death in the family, or they 
are sent elsewhere by the Presidency. 
That is how they feel in relation to 
their quorum meetings. That is how 
we want the brethren of the Priesthood 
throughout the Church to feel, in rela- 
tion to their respective quorum meet- 
ings. We rejoice in our labors. I testi- 
fy that there is a spirit of oneness, and 
of love, in the quorum of the Twelve, 
and existing also between them and the 
Presidency of the Church, such as you 
will hardly find among any other men 
upon earth. A love for one another 
that almost exceeds the love of a man 
for his wife. It is the love of the 
Priesthood — the love of God. 

Next to the Twelve Apostles are the 
First Seven Presidents of the Seventies. 
Oh, what a heavy weight of responsi- 
bility rests upon these seven men! They 
are called to preside over 143 quorums 
of Seventy — ten thousand men! Suppose 
they were lined up in the Tabernacle 
yard in one body, what an army of the 
Lord it would be! These seven presi- 
dents are called to look after the inter- 
ests of this great body of Seventies, 
to counsel, to direct, to warn them 



against the spirit of neglect and indif- 
ference, or commend them for their 
good works. Have they any time fors 
idleness? Have they any time to 
waste? No. indeed! These men meet 
together regularly once a week, that 
they may counsel concerning the affairs 
of the quorums of Seventy, which are 
scattered throughout the Church, from 
Canada in the north to MexicfO in the 
south. Then, they are constantly vis- 
iting the quorums, organizing and re- 
organizing. They have some serious 
difficulties to meet in this work, be- 
cause, when, in some instances, they 
get a right good man to fill an office 
and do the work, he is called to an- 
other position in the Church, and then 
they must select some other man in 
the quorum to meet the requirements. 
It needs constant watchfulness upon 
their part to keep the members active 
in their quorum duties. In addition to 
this, the seven presidents of Seventies 
labor under the direction of the Twelve 
Apostles, and hold themselves in con- 
stant readiness to respond to every call. 
They are always on hand; we know 
where to find them. They go with the 
Twelve into the stakes of Zion, or 
wherever duty calls, in a spirit of 
cheerfulness and willingness. These 
brethren are faithful to their duty. 

Then, we have the Presiding Bishop- 
ric of the Church. They are called to 
a great and heavy responsibility. Three 
men who look after the temporal inter- 
ests of Zion and supervise the tithmg 
donated by the people. The principle of 
tithing is an important one. One of the 
speakers said today, if the members in 
some of the other Christian denomina- 
tions pay tithing, who will take care 
of it? Where is the prophet to direct 
how the tithing shall be used and han- 
dled for the Lord? It belongs to the 
Lord, and not to the people; it must go 
into the storehouse of the Lord, and 
where is the servant of God authorized 
to direct its proper use? Here are 
the Bishopric called to this sa- 
cred duty, under the Presidency 
of the Church, and who are held 
to strict accountability for their 
stewardship. As the 600, and more, 
Bishops of the Church must report to 



60 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



them, so they must report to the Presi- 
dency of the Church. It is a heavy duty 
that rests upon these brethren, and 
they are in session— I was going to say 
day and night; but every day they con- 
sult together, and many important 
questions come up before them. They 
have many things to look after, which 
necessitates their going into the differ- 
ent stakes and correcting errors that 
may arise. I bear testimony that never 
in the history of the Church, so far as I 
know, has the tithing of the people 
been so carefully looked after and ac- 
counted for, cent fo.r cent, as it is to- 
day. The Latter-day Saints need have 
no anxiety upon this point. The tithing 
is taken care of scrupulously, under the 
direction of the First Presidency, and 
this according to the revelation and 
commandment. It entails great anxiety 
and labor upon these three men, and 
they cannot escape it, in fact, they 
cheerfully sustain the responsibility. 
Through the blessing of the Lord, they 
successfully perform this duty. If it 
were not for His blessing, they could 
not bear up under the pressure. 

Some people have said to me, "Oh, 
what a lovely time you Apostles have! 
You are traveling here and there, and 
enjoy yourselves and have a delightful 
time." Yes, yes, a very delightful 
time. (?) If the Apostles have the spirit 
of their calling resting upon them, it 
is delightful, it is happiness and joy to 
them; but if the spirit of the Apostle- 
ship did not rest upon them, it would 
be a very strenuous duty. The Apostles 
are away from their families about 
two-thirds of the time, and are seldom 
at home on the Sabbath day. Others 
can go to the house of worship with 
wives and children, and have the chil- 
dren under their supervision; it is not 
so with the Apostles, they are usually 
absent in the stakes of Zion. With 
them it is a constant change — change 
of diet, change of lodging, change of 
surroundings; which would make it a 
very disagreeable vnd strenuous life 
to lead, were it not for the sustaining 
power of the spirit of their calling. So 
it is with the Seven Presidents of 
Seventies; and so, I apprehend, it is 
with the Bishopric. Doubtless the pre- 



siding Bishopric have a great deal of 
joy and satisfaction in their labors, 
because the spirit and power of the 
Bishopric is upon *hem; but if they 
were without that spirit, their posi- 
tion would be very undesirable. And so 
it is with all the Bishops, and all the 
presiding authorities. 

In conclusion, I wish to say that the 
presidents of stakes are desired to meet 
legularly every week, to counsel, and 
devise plans for the benefit of those over 
whom they preside. "We expect them 
to hold these weekly meetings without 
fail, and to give attention to the pur- 
poses of them. We also desire the 
Bishops of wards and their counselors 
to meet regularly once a week, with 
the same faithfulness as is shown by 
the presiding authorities. No Bishopric 
should let a week pass without coming 
together, to enquire into the condi- 
tions that prevail in the ward, and to 
correct any evils that may exist. These 
meetings also bring them into greater 
harmony, and they become better ac- 
quainted with one another. It is neces- 
sary that the Bishop and his counselors 
should understand each other thorough- 
ly, that they may labor unitedly for 
the benefit and blessing of their people. 
So with the High Council; and so with 
the presidency of quorums. We want 
the leaders to be alive and wideawake, 
and faithful to duty in all things. 

May God bless you and all Israel; 
and, above all things, may He bless 
the priesthood, is my prayer in the 
name of Jesus. Amen.

I am very thankful, my brothers and 
sisters, for the privilege I have had of 
listening to the remarks that have been 
made during this conference. I have 
enjoyed the testimonies that have been 
borne, and the Spirit of God that has 
been present. I am thankful for the 
prayers that have been offered. Each 
prayer in itself has been a sermon. I 
am thankful for the statements of prin- 
ciples that have been given during this 
conference, and that I am in harmony

with the same. I am thankful that the 
world is growing in knowledge pertain- 
ing to some of the revelations that God 
has given His children. I am thank- 
ful that the Presbyterian ministers 
have seen the error of their position in 
advocating the detestable doctrine of 
infant damnation, and have announced 
to the world that they no more will 
preach that false theory. I am thank- 
ful that some of the Methodist minis- 
ters have seen the light, and are advo- 
cating the observance of the law of 
tithing. I am thankful that General 
Booth-Tucker, of the Salvation Army, 
is preaching to the world the great 
principle of colonization. At the Na- 
tional Irrigation Congress, held recently 
at Ogden, Utah, the gentleman named 
read a paper on the subject that was 
indeed praiseworthy. I listened with 
rapt attention to every idea he ex- 
pressed upon that important theme. 
The mode of colonization adopted by 
the Salvation Army, compared with 
that established and followed by th? 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints, shows to me, and must ulti- 
mately prove to the world, that there is 
always a. difference between the ways 
of God and the ways of man. The 
general told us that the Salvation 
Army people believe in colonization, 
and that the body of religious people he 
represented were spending money, time, 
and influence in gathering their 
people from this and other countries, 
placing them upon farms, and making 
homes for them. But they are Idoing 
it, my brethren and sisters, by the help 
of th e great mo n e y p ow e rs of the world. 
They are borrowing money by the hun- 
dreds of thousands of dollars, and mak- 
ing the land on which they colonize 
their people, together with the labor 
of the colonists, become security for 
the money advanced. With them it is 
simply a business proposition. I have 
thought to myself, however, what 
would they do if they were in the same 
condition as the Latter-day Saints were 
when the great principle of gathering 
and colonizing was revealed and estab- 
lished, with no friends anywhere upon 
the face of the earth, no credit with the 
money powers of the world, and hard- 



ly a dollar to buy lands for the people 
to go to. v I thought of the perpetual 
emigration fund that was started with 
a small sum of money, through which a 
few souls here and there were brought 
to the valleys of the mountains; and, 
as soon as God blessed them with suffi- 
cient means, they paid it back to the 
Presidency of the Church, who con- 
trolled that fund, and it in turn 
brought others here. It was slower; it 
was a great deal more of a sacrifice 
and required a great deal more faith, 
but it brought many an honest soul 
here, and they learned what coloniza- 
tion was in its truest sense. They 
learned also what gathering meant, and 
believed the revelations that God had 
given concerning it; and they learned 
through hardships, trials and troubles 
that it was God's will they should gath- 
er, and that they were here for the 
purpose of living their religion and 
serving God more fully. 

I am thankful, too, that many of the 
leading men in great institutions of 
learning in the United States, are at 
the present time deploring the lack of 
church training shown by the average 
student attending these great 1 universi- 
ties. Not later than last "Wednesday, 
September 30, Chancellor McCracken 
of New York University, in his address 
to the student body, made the following 
statement: 

"I wish we could require from every 
freshman a Sunday school diploma that 
would certify that he kne.v by heart 
the ten commandments, the sermon on 
the mount, a church catechism of some 
kind, a score of scripture pslams and 
best classic hymns. This university 
will join any association of universi- 
ties and colleges that will demand this 
as an entrance requirement. So much 
as in us lies, we will make the college 
a place for preserving and strengthen- 
ing reverence for things divine." 

President Brigham Young, when es- 
tablishing the Brigham Young Acad- 
emy at Provo, and the Brigham Young 
College at Logan, told the people, and 
required of those who had these institu- 
tions in charge, that nothing should be 
taught therein, not even the simplest 
studies in arithmetic, reading, or gram- 
mar, or a lesson on any subject, with- 
out the Spirit of God being with the

teacher and in his instructions. I see 
in Chancellor McCracken's remark that 
they are beginning- to see the light, and 
I care not whether the world gives us 
credit as the original teachers of these 
truths or not. The honest people of the 
world, those who read and think, those 
who are watching the events of life as 
they pass, will learn ere long who were 
the first teachers of these great truths; 
and ascertain what Church first taught 
the law of tithing in this dispensation, 
and that it was the Lord's revealed plan 
for raising means to carry on His 
work. The world will have to acknowl- 
edge sooner or later that it was no 
other than the Latter-day Saints; that 
it was the Prophet Joseph Smith who 
received that revelation in this dispen- 
sation. The truths revealed to the 
Prophet Joseph Smith, that we are pre- 
senting to the world, will demonstrate 
that he was a Prophet of God, and 
not a man with false ideas or vicious 
doctrines, as our enemies declare. I feel 
that every step forward, every advance 
we have made is towards the goal of 
success, and the firm etablishment of 
the Church of Jesus Christ, represent- 
ing the little stone cut out of the moun- 
tain that will roll forth and fill the 
whole earth. 

I thought yesterday, when President 
Lund was pleading with the people, 
asking them to keep the commandments 
of God, also when President Joseph F. 
Smith referred to the proper training of 
our children, calling particular 
attention of the people to these 
two important items, how natur- 
al it sounds. Have not these admoni- 
tions been given by every inspired man 
of God from the day of father Adam 
down to the present time — men whom 
God recognized as His mouthpieces up- 
on earth? I thought of the words re- 
corded in Deuteronomy, chapter 11, 
commencing at the 13th verse: 

"And it shall come to pass, if ye 
shall hearken diligently to my com- 
mandments which I command you this 
day, to love the Lord your God, and to 
serve Him with all your heart and with 
all your soul, 

"That I will give you the rain of your 
land in due season, the first rain and 
the latter rain, that thou mayest gather 



in thy corn, and thy wine, and thine 
oil. 

"And I will send grass in thy fields 
for thy cattle, that thou mayest eat 
and be full. 
"Take heed to yourselves that your 
heart be not deceived, and ye turn 
aside, and serve other gods, and wor- 
ship them; 

"And then the Lord's wrath will be 
kindled against you, and he shut up the 
heavens, that there be no rain, and that 
the land yield not her fruit; and lest 
ye perish quickly from off the good 
land which the Lord giveth you. 

"Therefore shall ye lay up these my 
words in your heart and in your soul, 
and bind them for a sign upon your 
hand, that they may be as fjontlets 
between your eyes. 

"And ye shall teach them unto your 
children, speaking of them when thou 
sittest in thine house, and when thou 
walkest by the way, when thou liest 
down and when thou risest up. 

"And thou shalt write them upon the 
door posts of thine house, and upon thy 
gates. 

"That your days may be multiplied, 
and the days of your children in the 
land which the Lord sware unto your 
fathers to give them, as the days of 
heaven upon the earth." 

Away back in the beginning of the 
history of this world we find these 
teachings, and they are repeated to the 
Latter-day Saints. I call to mind a 
revelation given through Joseph Smith 
the Prophet teaching the same subject. 
It is in section 68: 

"And, again, inasmuch as parents 
have children in Zion or in any of her 
stakes which are organized, that teach 
them not to understand the doctrine of 
repentance, faith in Christ the son of 
the living God, and of baptism and the 
gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying 
on of hands when eight years old, the 
sin be upon the heads of the parents; 

"For this shall be a law unto the in- 
habitants of Zion, or in any of her 
Stakes which are organized; 

"And their children shall be baptized 
for the remission of their sins when 
eight years old, and receive the laying 
on of hands, 

"And they shall also teach their chil- 
dren to pray and to walk uprightly 
before the Lord. 

"And the inhabitants of Zion shall al- 
so observe the Sabbath day to keep it 
holy. 

"And the inhabitants of Zion shall 
also remember their labors inasmuch 
as they are appointed to labor, in all 
faithfulness; for the idler shall be had 
in remembrance before the Lord." 

I believe every word of this revela-

tion, and I believe that one of the most 
important things that rests upon every 
Latter-day Saint, father and mother, 
is the training of their children, teach- 
ing them the laws and commandments 
of God. Do we teach our children to 
pray? If there is a home in all Zion; 
if there is a father or mother in the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints, who do not teach their chil- 
dren to pray they will live to see the 
day when they will repent of that neg- 
lect. I believe with all my heart that 
God revealed those words to the proph- 
et Joseph Smith, and thaft parent^ 
should follow them strictly. 

I believe it was two years ago that El- 
der A.O.Woodruff in conference referred 
to the duty of praying in the family.not 
only praying,but before prayers, reading 
some part of the scriptures, and advised 
all to do so. I accepted that advice. 
We should designate a certain time, 
just before supper, or breakfast, or 
just after as the case may be, to get 
all the family together, and then take 
10 or 15 minutes for the purpose of 
reading to them the word of God, and 
offering devotion to Him. I promise 
the father and mother who adopt this 
as a family rule that they will be 
blessed in so doing. Their children will 
bless them in years to come, and they 
will feel blessed in doing it as long as 
they live. I have heard others say they 
have adopted this plan for family devo- 
tion in their homes, and through it they 
have become better acquainted with 
the scriputures: that they have been 
better able to teach the Gospel of the 
Lord Jesus Christ than ever they were 
before. I earnestly ask every Latter- 
day Saint family to adopt this plan. I 
see in the audience Brother E. J. Wood 
of Cardston, Canada. I stopped at his 
home on a recent visit to Canada. Ev- 
ery morning there was a chapter read 
from the Bible, the Book of Mormon, 
or some other book containing the 
principles of the Gospel; a hymn was 
sung, and prayers were offered. He 
took his turn as mouth, his wife took 
her turn; his wife's sister was there, 
and she took her turn; the children 
took their turn, and the spirit of pray- 
er and peace was in his home, as it 



will be in every home where that is 
done. Not only that, it makes people 
better, and has an influence for good 
on all who visit the home. In my home 
we have prayers night and morning, 
and my children pray in turn. No mat- 
ter who comes to visit us, we pray as 
usual, and they can not help but feel 
the spirit of prayer. I have had in- 
dividuals who are strangers to this peo- 
ple and to the Gospel we believe in, 
come to my home, and they have heard 
my children ask a blessing upon the 
food; they have seen them kneel with 
the family and heard them offer their 
simple but earnest prayers to God, and 
I tell you it has had an influence upon 
them, and it has been an influence for 
good. Afterwards I have heard of it, 
outside of the state, while in conversa- 
tion with men and women who 
said that the person who visited 
me reported to them what they had 
seen and heard. 

This is one way of living the Gos- 
pel of Jesus Christ, and teaching it to 
strangers. Everything we do in this 
life that leads people to understand that 
we love Jesus, that we love His Gospel, 
and that we are trying to serve him 
and keep his commandments, is preach- 
ing, by action at least, the Gospel of 
Jesus Christ. It will have its influence 
upon every soul. The fruits of the 
Gospel should be shown in the lives of 
the members of the Church. I have 
heard it said that missionaries have 
been called, set apart, and gone to their 
fields of labor, never having prayed in 
public or in the family circle. Thank 
the Lord there are not many of these, 
but as long as there is one such there 
is one too many. I hope and trust that 
no father, claiming to be a Latter-day 
Saint, will ever raise a boy or girl in 
the Church of Jesus Christ to manhood 
or womanhood and not teach them how 
to pray. 

Last night, Brother Joseph J. Jack- 
son, superintendent of the Alpine Sun- 
day schools, paid a tribute to the re- 
sults of teaching in our Church schools. 
He said the Saints in that stake are 
favored by living close to the Brigham 
Young Academy, and the teachers in 
their Sunday schools were nearly all 



64 



GENERAL, CONFERENCE. 



educated in that grand institution. 
They had received special training that 
fitted them for teachers, and had also 
a testimony that God lives and that 
Jesus is the Christ; consequently the 
Sunday schools of the Alpine stake are 
in a flourishing condition, being blessed 
with such teachers. I am an advocate 
of church school education, they are 
doing valuable work among the Latter- 
day Saints. I also call attention to 
the fact that the district schools are 
doing a good work in this state; and, 
fathers and mothers, you should let 
your younger children go to the dis- 
trict schools. Do not take them out 
when they reach the sixth grade. Let 
them remain long enouerh to complete 
the eighth grade in the district school. 
Why do I say this? Because, if you 
take your child out as soon as it reach- 
es the sixth grade, in years to come 
it will become dissatisfied with the lim- 
ited education received. There are 
hundreds of young men, many of them 
married and too old to attend the dis- 
trict schools, who decide that they must 
have a better education, after learning 
the necessity of it, and they are now 
attending our Church schools. This 
would not have been necessary if they 
had not been taken from school so soon. 
God bless them for the energy that 
they display in this regard. Many of 
them, if they had been left in the dis- 
trict school a couple of years longer, 
would have completed a course in the 
two higher grades, and, more than 
likely, would have been satisfied, and 
received education enough to have fit- 



ted them for the occupation they had 
to follow. Therefore, I hope and trust 
that the fathers and mothers will see 
that the boys and girls are educated 
sufficiently. The world can not de- 
plore the lack of religious training, or 
devotion to religion, any more than the 
Latter-day Saints do. We have been 
taught the need of it from the first, and 
the benefits have been shown to us in 
our Church schools, and in our lives 
here in the Rocky Mountains. 

I ask the blessings of God upon all 
the people, and upon His Church. ^ I 
am proud indeed to belong to the 
Church that has all of the principles 
in it that Jesus Christ taught. I want 
to emphasize the statement made here 
by Brother John W. Taylor this morn- 
ing, that no one principle will ever save 
a soul in the kingdom of heaven. One 
srood act will never save a person, but 
one bad act may be the means of his 
downfall and damnation. We, as Lat- 
ter-day Saints, know what the teach- 
ings of Jesus Christ are. We know 
what the revelations are that have been 
given to us through the Prophet Joseph 
Smith, and all of the prophets of God 
in this dispensation, and we should try 
to honor every one of them. In order 
to receive the exaltation we all so 
much desire, I know we must obey 
them all. God give us strength to do 
it, is my prayer in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen.

O God for a Prophet," and benediction

THIRD DAY 



Tuesday, Oct. 6, 10 a. m. 
The choir and congregation sang the 
hymn : 

Redeemer of Israel, 

Our only delight, 
On whom for a blessing we call; 

Our shadow by day, 

And our pillar by nignt, 
Our King, our Deliverer, our all. 

The opening prayer was offered by 
Elder Joseph W. McMurrin. 

Singing by the choir and congrega- 
tion: 

O ye mountains high, 
Where the clear blue sky. 

Arches over the vales of tne free, 
Where the pure breezes blow, 
And the clear streamlets flow, 

How I've longed to thy bosom to flee. 

PRESIDENT JORN R. WINDER. 

Processes of going into debt— How to keep clear 
of it. 

My brethren and sisters, I have al- 
most lost my voice through a cold, and 
I scarcely feel able to occupy this po- 
sition; but I do desire to say to you 
that I heartily endorse, and am in full 
accord with, the remarks made by 
President Smith on Sunday morning. 
Many things werf mentioned that I 
would like to speak of if I were able to 
do so, but one in particular, I think, 
is important for the Latter-day Saints 
to observe, and that is in relation to 
going into debt. Evidences come be- 
fore us frequently that many of our 
brethren are still contracting debts 
which they are hardly able to meet. If 
you ask a man how he first got into 
debt, sometimes the reply will be after 
this manner: "Well, I had a piece of 
land, on which I wanted to build me a 
house. I had at my command about 
$1,000, but I wanted a house that would 
cost at least $3,000. A $1,000 house in 
these days is not sufficient and I felt 
that the land was worth $1,000, and I 
would lay out $1,000 on it, and then I 
could borrow at least $1,000 more and 
mortgage the place." What is the re- 



sult? The man had his land, and he 
had $1,000. He borrows $1,000 or $1,500 
on what he has, and places the whole 
under a mortgage. He perhaps has to 
pay exorbitant interest. The first thing 
he knows his circumstances may 
change. He may lose his situation, or 
he may have sickness, and his pay 
stops; but the interest continues on, 
and by and by he finds himself unable 
to meet it. His obligation becomes 
due, his property is foreclosed, it is 
probably sold at a discount, and he 
loses his home and all he had. Now, I 
know some in our community today 
that are just in this condition. Hence 
I want to sustain what President Smith 
said, and to warn our brethren, especi- 
ally our young brethren, not to go in 
debt. If you have $1,000, and that is 
all you do have, be satisfied and content 
with a $1,000 house, until you have more 
means to enable you to add to it and 
avoid paying interest, which, It is said, 
never sleeps; it is always going on. 

The report made here by Brother 
Pond president of Bannock stake, 
showed how easy it is for us to launct 
out beyond our means. He said that 
some of the brethren who had gone 
up to Snake river valley would take 
up 160 acres of land, spend means on 
it and improve it, and then when the 
payments for the land became due 
they could not meet them. In this 
emergency they would borrow, and 
mortgage the land with all they had 
put on it and the first thing they knew 
the note became due, they could not 
meet it, and they were sold out. It 
seems to me that it would be far more 
judicious for a man to take up 40 acres 
that he could pay for than to take up 
160 acres that he could not pay for. Let 
him cultivate the smaller piece care- 
fully, and probably he would find it 
sufficient. At all events, he would be 
secure against obligations. 

I would say, if you will pardon me 
for doing it, that from the day I came 



66 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



into the valley I have proposed never 
to go in debt. I. have always tried to 
live within my means. A person who 
has $100 a month salary is on the safe 
side if he lives on $90 a month; but if 
he spends $110 or $120, he is going 
down hill all the time, and this is too 
much the case among us at the present 
time. 

There are other things that come to 
my mind. Sometimes we are extrava- 
gant. For instance, a farmer has a ve- 
hicle, and it is growing old. It perhaps 
needs a new spoke or two, or the tires 
need setting, and $10 would repair it 
sufficiently to last him another year; 
but along comes an agent and offers 
him a new carriage for $100, and the 
farmer thinks he might just as well 
have the new one as to fix up the old 
one. So he gives his note for the $100, 
drawing 10 per cent interest probably. 
At the end of the year the $10 it would 
have cost him to fix up the old car- 
iiage has gone for interest, and he 
owes the $100, and perhaps in a worse 
condition to meet it than he was when 
he incurred the debt. 

I might go on and enumerate many 
things of this kind, and I feel, as 
President Smith said, that the time has 
come when we should carefully look 
into these matters. We may not al- 
ways have sunshine; we may not al- 
ways have prosperous times, and now 
is the time for us to trim our sails and 
keep as close to shore as possible. 

I do not feel able to say more, but 
I repeat what I said in the beginning: 
I am in full accord and harmony with 
my president and with Brother Lund. 
The three of us work in unison togeth- 
er. God bless you all, brethren and 
sisters, in all your labors, is my prayer 
in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER WILLIS 2. ROBINSON. 

(President of Wayne Stake.) 
My brethren and sisters, I appreciate 
the privilege of attending this con- 
ference and of listening to the good 
instructions we have received. If I 
shall be blessed with a portion of the 
Spirit that has been poured out upon 
other speakers, I will endeavor to rep- 
resent the Wayne stake of Zion. 



The Wayne stake of Zion, geographic- 
ally speaking, is situated in the south- 
eastern portion of this state, with the 
Sevier stake upon the west (from which 
it was detached), the Panguitch stake 
upon the south, the San Juan stake 
on the east, and the Emery stake on 
the north. It is located partially up- 
on what we would call the rim of the 
basin. The western portion is high, 
and it is somewhat difficult to mature 
crops there; while in the eastern por- 
tion we have a semi-tropiCal climate 
similar to that of southern Utah, where 
the people can raise almost anything 
they are inclined to plant and cultivate. 
So that we have a variety of products in 
the Wayne stake of Zion. We are iso- 
lated from the railroads, and we have 
no corporate properties to aid us in 
taxation, but are compelled to rely upon 
our own resources in this respect. Gen- 
erally speaking, the people own their 
own homes. While the subject of mort- 
gages has been discussed here. I have 
been reflecting on the condition of the 
people in our stake, and I believe that 
a conservative estimate would show 
that there are not a score of mortgaged 
homes in the Wayne stake of Zion. I 
am very well conversant with the situa- 
tion, as I live near the recorder's office, 
and know pretty well what homes are 
mortgaged, and I am thankful for this 
condition. The people in our stake are 
not wealthy. While they own their 
own homes, they are upon the fron- 
tiers. They have been struggling to 
maintain their foothold, and have suc- 
ceeded in making themselves some- 
what comfortable; yet the outflow of 
emigration to the north, during the 
past two or three years, has been of 
such a nature that we are barely hold- 
ing our own, so far as numbers are 
concerned. I can speak of the people 
of Wayne stake as a good people. We 
have eight organized wards, and five 
branches. The country is so situated 
that branches are almost as numerous 
as wards. From one end of the stake 
to the other it is about 80 miles in 
almost a direct line, and it includes all 
of Wayne county and a small portion of 
Garfield county. I believe that all our 
wards are fully organized, excepting 



ELDER HYRUM M. SMITH. 



67 



one ward, which is lacking a Bishop's 
counselor. The people are trying to 
live their religion. Our High Councilors 
are good men, our home missionaries 
are active, and the people, as a rule, are 
feeling as well in the principles of the 
Gospel as I have known them to be for 
many years. In fact, I think we are 
trying to keep pace with Zion. In look- 
ing abroad in other stakes of Zion, 
where I occasionally am called on busi- 
ness or otherwise, and making inquiries 
in relation to existing conditions, I 
have come to the conclusion that the 
Latter-day Saints are about equal in 
point of religious devotion. There may 
be instances where they are more mixed 
up with an outside element than we 
are in the Wayne stake, and this, of 
course, must be taken into considera- 
tion. We have been fortunate in this 
regard, and we have only one saloon 
in our stake, and that has such a lone- 
some appearance that I am inclined to 
think it will soon die a natural death. 
We teach the people not to sustain it, 
and let it go its own way — and I was 
going to say, then we pray for its early 
demise. 

We have many opportunties there 
that are yet undeveloped. We have a 
well watered county, and the people 
are engaged in taking out canals and 
making reservoirs, and we hope in the 
near future that we may be able to 
present at the State Fair some of our 
products which, we feel, are equal in 
merit to many that are on exhibition 
at the fair. 

I feel well in this work. I am pleas- 
ed to say that the presidency of the 
stake stand as they did when it was 
organized, and I trust so long as I 
may be permitted to remain in that 
presidency this condition of affairs may 
continue. There has never yet been a 
time when we have had to say that 
the majority rules in the presidency. 
We have reached unanimous conclusion 
on every occasion before taking action 
upon anything. We are in harmony 
with our High Council, and with the 
various wards and organizations. 

I can testify to you of the truthful- 
ness of this great work. If our friends 
in the world should come here and see 



the devotion that is manifested by 
this people, they would be forced to 
the conclusion that there is something 
more in "Mormonism" than they have 
given it credit for. I ask the blessings 
of the Lord upon our efforts to serve 
Him and keep His commandments, that 
we may be in harmony with one an- 
other and with our Father in heaven; 
that what we hear during this confer- 
ence may not fall idly upon our ears, 
but that we may take it to our homes 
and put it into practise, so that when 
we come to another conference we may 
be able to say that good has resulted 
from our teachings, and thus keep pace 
with the onward progress of this great 
work. That the Lord may grant these 
blessings, I ask in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 

ELDER HYRUM M. SMITH 

Gospel truth being recognized in the world — Vision 
of the Prophets Lehiand Nephi— Fulfiillment of 
their predictions — Charity toward those who 
know not the truth. 

I pray that the words which I may 
speak may be guided by the inspiration 
of the Spirit of the Lord, that they 
may follow appropriately that which 
has already been spoken, and be of ben- 
efit to the Latter-day Saints who have 
gathered here. I have rejoiced greatly 
in the conference, and I have been very 
glad in my heart to be permitted to 
meet with you in these great memorial 
meetings, which have been held, by 
commandment of the Lord, annually 
and semi-annually since the Church 
was established in the year 1830. I feel 
in my heart to praise the Lord for the 
advancement and progress that has 
been made by His people; that His 
hand has been and is over His Saints; 
that He is leading them, and that they 
are not being led by men. We are often 
inclined to speak of the brethren whom 
the Lord has placed at the head of His 
Church, as the leaders of the Church; 
but they themselves rejoice that they 
have not the full responsibility of lead- 
ing this people, but that the Lord himself 
is leading us, and that He is inspiring 
those whom He has chosen to stand 
at our head on the earth. 

I have been impressed by the many 



68 



GENERAL, CONFERENCE. 



testimonies that have been borne by the 
brethren who have spokten, and the 
great stress that has been laid upon the 
fact that the Gospel has been restored 
in this day; that Joseph Smith was 
raised up of God and was indeed an in- 
spired prophet, and that he was the in- 
strument in the hands of the Lord to 
establish the Church which has con- 
vened this great conference. The hand 
of man has not been in it, only so far 
as that hand has been guided by the 
inspiration of God Almighty. 

We have also listened to some com- 
parisons made between the true Church 
and the other churches of the world, 
and some very sharp contrasts have 
been defined. We have been given to 
understand that some of the princi- 
ples of the Gospel of Christ revealed in 
this dispensation are finding their way 
into the systems of men. What do 
we see in this? So far as I am con- 
erned, I do not see that those who are 
incorporating the principles of Christ 
in their systems are doing it with the 
view of getting nearer to the Church of 
God, because they already believe that 
they have the Church of Christ. They 
have believed it for many years. I see 
in this the fulfillment of the prophe- 
cies of God made in times gone 
by, and repeated to the Prophet Joseph 
Smith by the angel Moroni and other 
angelic ministers who came to him dur- 
ing his boyhood. I see in it the begin- 
ning of the fulfillment of the prophecy 
of the Prophet Joel, through whom the 
Lord said: 

"And it shall come to pass afterward, 
that I will pour out my spirit upon all 
flesh; and your sons and your daugh- 
ters shall prophesy, your old men shall 
dream dreams, your young men shall 
see visions; 

"And also upon the servants and upon 
the handmaids in those days will I 
pour out my spirit." 

I do not believe that these principles 
are being incorporated into the systems 
of the world because the man-appoint- 
ed leaders of the systems have particu- 
larly desired it. I am of the opinion 
that they have had to yield to the pub- 
lic sentiment that is growing in the 
breasts of mankind, demanding that 



these truths be adopted. And this is 
the Spirit of God working among the 
children of men; and it will continue to 
work among them. This prophecy will 
be fulfilled, and mankind shall desire 
to know the truth. Many of them will 
seek it, and they will go to their lead- 
ers and enquire of them concerning 
the restoration of the Gospel arid the 
principles of the Gospel of Christ as now 
promulgated in the world by the Elders 
of this Church. If satisfaction cannot 
be given them, then the sentiment will 
become so strong and so universal that 
the leaders of the systems of men will 
have to yield to the demands of the 
people as they shall be influenced by 
this unseen power, which is nothing 
more nor less than the Spirit of God 
being poured out in measure upon the 
children of men. 

It is no source of rejoicing to the 
Latter-day Saints that so many 
millions are ignorant of the truth. 
It is no great reason for boast- 
ing on our part, that changes 
are being made in the systems of men, 
and that revealed principles are being 
adopted by them. While it may show 
forth their vulnerable parts, and give 
an opening against which the atheist 
may direct his shafts of sarca=m, yet 
the Latter-day Saints will not raise 
their voices in derision concerning 
them. Rather will we rejoice that man- 
kind will receive principles of truth, 
incorporate them in their systems, and 
live them in their lives. The Gospel 
has been restored in our day for the 
benefit of the world, and we deplore 
the fact that the world to such a great 
extent are without a knowledge of it. 
And I am not inclined to believe that 
they are in this condition of ignorance 
because they prefer it. The Book of 
Mormon does not lead one to that con- 
clusion. Read the great vision that 
was given to the Prophet Nephi, after 
it had been shown to his father Lehi. 
Lehi had related the vision to his sons, 
and Nephi had been filled with a de- 
sire to see it himself. The Lord grant- 
ed him his desire, according to his 
faith; and a vision of the world, from 
the beginning to the end of it, was 



ELDER HYRUM M. SMITH. 



shown unto Nephi, and he was permit- 
ted to write much of it. This was six 
hundred years before the time of 
Christ. In the vision, Nephi beheld 
the Virgin Mary, and he saw an infant 
in her arms, who was the Redeemer 
of the world. He saw the ministry of 
the Savior; saw Him heal the sick, 
perform mighty miracles, and declare 
righteousness and redemption to the 
world; saw Him lifted upon the cross 
by evil men, and suffer ignominy and 
death. He saw the labors and ministry 
of the Twelve Apostles of the Lamb of 
God, and afterwards saw the people 
rise up against them, persecute them, 
put thm to death, and almost exter- 
minate the Saints of God. Nephi saw 
all this, and wrote of it. Further- 
more, he tells us, in the 13th chapter 
of I Nephi : 

"And it came to pass that I saw 
among the nations of the Gentiles the 
foundation of a great church. 

"And the angel said unto me, Behold 
the foundation of a church, which is 
most abominable above all other 
churches, which slayeth the Saints of 
God, yea, and tortureth them, and 
bindeth them down, and yoketh them 
with a yoke of iron, and bringeth them 
down into captivity. 

* « * 

"And after they (the Jewish scrip- 
tures) go forth by the hand of the 
twelve apostles of the Lamb from the 
Jews unto the Gentiles, thou seest the 
foundation of a great and abominable 
church, which is most abominable 
above all other churches; for behold, 
they have taken away from the Gospel 
of the Lamb, many parts which are 
plain and most precious; and also 
many covenants of the Lord have they 
taken away. 

"And all this have they done, that 
they might pervert the right ways of 
the Lord that they might blind the eyes 
and harden the hearts of the children 
of men. « 

"Wherefore, thou seest that after the 
book hath gone forth tnrough the 
hands of the great and abominable 
church, that there are many plain and 
precious things taken away from the 
book, which is the book of the Lamb 
of God. 

And after these plain and precious 
things were taken away, it goeth forth 
unto all the nations of the Gentiles; and 
after it goeth forth unto all the nations 
of the Gentiles, yea, even across the 
many waters which thou hast seen 
with the Gentiles which have gone 
forth out of captivity; thou seest be- 



69 



cause of the many plain and precious 
things which have been taken out of 
the book, which were plain unto the 
understanding of the children of men, 
according to the plainness which is in 
the Lamb of God; because of these 
things which are taken away out of 
the Gospel of the Lamb, an exceeding: 
great many do stumble, yea, insomuch 
that Satan hath great power over 
them." 

From this you may gatner some idea 
as to why the world is in ignorance of 
the Gospel. 

Nephi saw that when the seed of his 
father had dwindled in unbelief and 
most of them had been destroyed be- 
cause of their wickedness, people came 
to this land out of captivity, where they 
might be secure in the worship of God. 
The blessings of the Lord, he says, 
were with them, and in due time, when 
the mother nation came to make war 
upon them and were arrayed in battle 
against them, God was with them. 
They had left the nations of the Gen- 
tiles and had come to this land of 
promise, where they might worship 
God according to the dictates of their 
own consciences, and the Lord preserv- 
ed them from their enemies. He saw 
these pople going forth among the seed 
of his brethren (who are now as we 
know, the Lamanites), taking with 
them the Bible, the book which had 
proceeded from the mouth of the Jews, 
and from which had been taken, by 
the great and abominable church, many 
great and glorious principles of the 
Gospel of Christ, and he beheld that 
many people did stumble because of 
the most plain and precious parts of 
the Gospel which had been taken from 
the book. But he goes on to say that 
the Lord would give unto the people 
who dwelt upon this continent the 
Gospel in its purity. 

"For behold, saith the Lamb, I will 
manifest myself unto thy seed, that 
they shall write many things which I 
shall minister unto them, which shall 
be plain and precious; and after thy 
seed shall be destroyed, and dwindle in 
unbelief, and also the seed of thy 
brethren; behold, these things shall be 
hid up, to come forth unto the Gen- 
tiles, by the gift and power of the 
Lamb; 

"And in them shall be written my 
gospel, saith the Lamb."

GENERAL, CONFERENCE. 



Brethren and sisters, we see the ful- 
fillment of this great prophecy in the 
coming forth of the Book of Mormon. 
That is the book which Nephi saw come 
forth unto the Gentiles, containing 
those plain and precious principles 
which had been taken from the other 
book, by reason of which mankind were 
in doubt and without a knowledge of 
the pure Gospel. Therefore, I say I 
do not believe the people are in this 
condition of unbelief, indifference and 
contention because they prefer to be in 
that condition, but because for centur- 
ies they have been led by men who 
had not themselves a knowledge of the 
truth. Their eyes have been blinded to 
the truth, while they have been led to 
believe that what they received was the 
truth. By reading this glorious revela- 
tion that has come forth in our day, 
in the Book of Mormon, we shall find 
these great principles of truth revealed 
anew. Furthermore, the Lord pro- 
nounced a woe upon those who will 
stand up and declare, "We have a Bible, 
and we want no more Bible." He has 
denounced such; for who is the Lord 
that He cannot give more to His chil- 
dren? He has made other promises in 
addition to this. He has declared that 
there are many other records still to 
come forth, containing His word to men 
who have lived upon this earth, and 
they will come forth in due time to 
corroborate the words of the Bible and 
the Book of Mormon, and to establish 
the fact that all the children of the 
world are the sons and daughters of 
God; that He is mindful of them all, 
and that to all of them will He reveal 
His word. He spoke thus to the Ne- 
phites: 

"For behold, I shall speak unto the 
Jews, and they shall write it; and I 
shall speak unto the Nephites, and 
they shall write it; and I shall also 
speak unto the other tribes of the 
house of Israel, which I have led away, 
and they shall write it; and I shall also 
speak unto all nations of the earth, and 
they shall write it." 

These records shall come forth, my 
brethren and sisters, and it ill becomes 
any man to stand up and attempt to 
limit God in the exercise of His di- 



vine right to speak when and to whom 
He pleases. "We have an evidence of 
the truth of this in connection with the 
Book of Mormon itself. A portion of 
the plates from which the Book of Mor- 
mon was translated was sealed, and 
has not yet been translated, but under 
the promise of God shall be made 
known to the people. When these 
things shall come forth, they will fur- 
nish additional and incontrovertible 
proof that the Book of Mormon is in- 
deed from God. And why should it 
not be? Have you read the book? Does 
it not contain revelations and visions 
similar to the Bible? Does it not con- 
tain the same glorious Gospel, and the 
same mighty exhortations to men to 
serve God and to turn from their evil 
ways? Yes. And furthermore, it is a 
book that has never been contaminated 
or tampered with by man; and none 
of the words writen in that book have 
ever been changed by any man or 
church. They are the pure words of 
God, as they were given through the 
inspiration of the Spirit to the proph- 
ets who wrote them anciently. Thank 
and praise God, that in His mercy He 
has revealed these things to the earth 
in these days, in fulfillment of proph- 
ecy, and that the truth is spreading 
abroad, and this spirit is being poured 
out upon the world. Because of the 
teaching of these additional precious 
principles of the truth, which have been 
lost for centuries, the world is enquir- 
ing after the truth, and the denomina- 
tions are being compelled, little by lit- 
tle, to yield to this demand and senti- 
ment of the people through the work- 
ings of the Spirit. That is the way I 
view it. May the Spirit of God con- 
tinue to be poured out upon the people, 
that they may desire the truth, 
aim to do right, strive to know God, 
and never rest satisfied until they re- 
ceive the pure Gospel of Christ and en- 
joy its privileges and blessings, even 
to the extent that it shall come to them 
in power, in majesty, and with much 
assurance, leaving no room whatever 
for doubt. In this way has the Gos- 
pel come to you. So is it being car- 
ried to the nations of the world. So is it 



ELDER BRIGHAM H. ROBERTS. 



71 



being accepted by thousands. And so 
shall this great and mighty power 
which has been revealed in our day — 
the Holy Ghost — come to man, and the 
authority of Almighty God be spread 
abroad, until all mankind shall be re- 
deemed from their sins, when it shall 
be a pleasure for men to adopt the 
truth in their religions. 

You Latter-day Saints ought to praise 
God; but in your thankfulness for the 
greater blessings which you enjoy, you 
ought not to denounce others because 
they have not so much good as you 
have. No; our whole souls should be 
filled with pity because of their con- 
dition, and we should sympathize with 
them be'cause of their ignorance and 
blindness because they are being led 
by blind guides. We should go forth 
among them with the sole desire in 
our hearts to manifest unto them that 
which God has revealed unto us, and 
carry to them that which has made us 
free and happy, and which has made us 
in very deed the Church and people 
of God. That should be the feeling of 
the Latter-day Saints. I feel so at thi ; 
present time, my brothers and sisters. 
Sometimes I feel otherwise, because the 
spirit of humanity and the weakness 
of the flesh overcome me and cause me 
to do and say things which are not 
in accord with the Gospel of Jesus 
Christ. May the Lord forgive it, and 
help me to become so strong that I may 
overcome it, so that I may see in all 
men the children of God, and that I 
may understand that it is the desire of 
our Father in heaven that all shall 
be saved in His kingdom. May I feel 
a great pleasure and joy in doing my 
part, and a greater pleasure and joy in 
seeing all the Latter-day Saints doing 
their part towards carrying this grand 
Gospel to all the nations of the earth, 
that they may hear and, if it please 
God, yield obedience to the truth. May 
the Lord bless the Latter-day Saints. 
May He bless the people of the world. 
May His Spirit be poured out in more 
abundance than it has heretofore been. 
May the people of the world seek after 
truth to a greater extent than they 
have already done. May they desire to 
serve God. May the spirit of good, and 



not of evil, of love, and not of hatred, 
of philanthropy, and not of envy, be 
poured out upon the people, to the con- 
summation of all the righteous 
purposes of the Lord, and may we live 
long to see the accomplishment of much 
of it, is my prayer in the name of Jesus. 
Amen.

My brethren and sisters, I desire to 
bear you my testimony that during this 
conference there has been a rich out- 
pouring of the Spirit of God upon His 
servants; my heart has been made 
glad, and I have rejoiced in the truths 
we have received. I do not bear this 
testimony to you because I think it is 
necessary to confirm the words that 
have been spoken, nor in the hope of 
adding emphasis to what has been said, 
nor to convince you that you have lis- 
tened to the truth. The Spirit of the 
Lord, I am confident, has borne record 
to your souls already as it has to mine, 
that what we have heard in this con- 
ference is true, is precious, and is the 
word of the Lord unto the people. I 
merely bear you my testimony that you 
may know that in my heart also the 
Spirit has given witness of the good 
things we have received from God, and 
that I am one with you in the enjoy- 
ment of these blessings. 

I am now called upon to address you 
for a short time, and I desire to be 
under the same influence that my 
brethren have enjoyed while speaking. 
Yet when I come to view my own life, 
I confess that it is with some degree of 
fear and trembling that I ask God in 
my heart for this blessing; for the rea- 
son that I cannot feel altogether that 
I merit it, but am under the necessity 
of trusting in the mercy and grace of 
God. Such is the weakness of human 
nature that I presume— at least I speak 



72 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



for myself— if it were not for God's 
goodness and grace and for His willing- 
ness to help those who are striving 
to overcome and to be His ser- 
vant's, it would be almost beyond 
man's power to approach God with suf- 
ficient confidence to obtain the out- 
pouring of His Spirit and power. It is 
in this spirit, my brethren and sisters, 
that I approach the Lord on this occa- 
sion — with fear and trembling, ac- 
knowledging my own weakness and im- 
perfections before you all; and if God 
in His mercy will pour out His Spirit 
and grant us a blessing through the 
words I may speak, then shall the hon- 
or and the praise and the glory be ac- 
corded unto Him. Moreover, we de- 
sire, in this way, that is, through His 
Spirit, to be taught of God, and not of 
man, nor by the spirit of man. 

Many beautiful thoughts were awak- 
ened in my mind by the singing of that 
splendid hymn composed by the late 
Elder Parley P. Pratt, and sung by 
his grandsons in this conference. The 
hymn was originally published upon 
the cover of the first number of the 
"Millennial Star," in the month of 
April, 1840; and if I were going to 
take a text on this occasion it would 
be the first verse of that hymn: 

The morning breaks the shadows flee; 

Lo! Zion's standard is unfurled, 
The dawning of a brighter day 

Majestic rises on the world. 

Sixty-three years of experience has 
demonstrated the inspiration of God in 
that utterance. If in thought you will 
go back to that time — 1840 — and take 
account of the progress made by the 
nations of the earth since then, you 
will find that there has been more ad- 
vancement in arts, in sciences, in me- 
chanics, in scientific and religious 
thought, than in any five hundred years 
previous to that time. Truly the dawn- 
ing of a brighter day has arisen ma- 
jestically on the world! The dawn of 
that day began when God once more 
renewed divine communication with 
men. When He graciously revealed 
Himself and His ,Son Jesus Christ 
to a Prophet and announced the 
incoming of the Dispensation of the 



Fullness of Times, in which should be 
gathered together all things in one, 
even in Christ, whether they were 
things in heaven, or things on earth. 
That was the beginning of the 
dawn of that brighter day. Since 
that event flood upon flood 
of light has come to the earth, 
making it radiant with intelligence. The 
direct result of the dawning of that 
brighter day has been the restoration of 
the holy Priesthood of God — the power 
of God given to man, by which man 
may co-operate with Gods and angels in 
bringing to pass the purposes of Je- 
hovah. Also with the restoration of 
the Priesthood has come a profounder 
knowledge of the things of God; a bet- 
ter understanding of the character and 
being of God; of the relationship which 
man sustains to Him; the establish- 
ment of the Church of Christ; together 
with broader views of the plan of man's 
salvation and the redemption of the 
earth. I believe also that with this 
flood of knowledge concerning these 
highly spiritual things, there has come 
into the world, almost imperceptibly, a 
more generally diffused and brighter 
spirit of intelligence than was known 
before; like collateral rays shoot- 
ing off to right and left from the more 
direct light of God's revelations which 
ushered in the great work of the last 
days. By those collateral rays of light 
men have been led to those great dis- 
coveries in the arts and sciences and in 
mechanics, which make our age so won- 
derful as an age of progress and en- 
lightenment. If I am right in this con- 
jecture respecting this diffusion of a 
more general spirit of intelligence in the 
world as a result of the renewed di- 
rect communication between heaven 
and earth, then we should not be sur- 
prised, and I am sure that none of us 
are envious in the matter — we should 
not be surprised, that the sects and 
parties in the world, outside of the 
organization known as the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, should 
partake of some of the rays of light 
emanating from this central spiritual 
sun. Why, in olden times, even 
the beggars and strangers were 
welcome to the crumbs that fell

from the Master's table and so the 
inhabitants of the earth, now if they 
cannot accept the fullness of the Gos- 
pel, are welcome to such fragments of 
that truth as may penetrate their un- 
derstandings. I rejoice that they are 
partaking in a measure of these things; 
and while I believe with Elder Cowley 
that perhaps they are not designedly 
accepting them in order to hon- 
or God, still I am of the opinion that 
such is the wisdom of our Father 
that He will overrule their partial ac- 
ceptance of the truth to His glory, and 
ultimately to a more rapid moving for- 
ward of the great work that He has 
in hand. After awhile, those who are 
now taking up fragments of the truth 
into their creeds will be under the 
necessity of comparing notes and trac- 
ing things to their source, and when 
they do that they will learn that these 
great religious truths are not man's 
discovery, but God's revelation unto 
the inhabitants of the earth, and that 
they were revealed through His chosen 
instrument, the Prophet Joseph Smith. 

It is not, however, in this direction 
that I would lead your thoughts on 
this ocasion. I want to speak, if I shall 
enjoy the liberty of God's Spirit, upon 
another subject. Some of you perhaps 
are aware of the fact that I have been 
giving some attention of late to the 
literature on "Mormonism;" not only 
that which we ourselves publish, but 
that also which is published by others. 
The publications on "Mormonism" dur- 
ing the last five years, I believe, are 
more numerous than in any 20 years 
previous to that time. The last five 
vears have witnessed an awakening of 
thought upon our religion. More, and 
ever more attention is being given to 
It. More newspaper articles, more 
magazine articles, more volumes — some 
of them quite pretentious — have been 
written on "Mormonism" than ever be- 
fore, and indicate the universal interest 
taken in the subject. The books and 
magazine articles have been written 
from various standpoints; some of 
them in the old spirit of bit- 
terness, and some of them are 
intended to be written in a spirit 
of fairness. Yet I marvel at their 



ideas of fairness. One work, written 
a noted professor, pretending to be an 
impartial history, and issued by one of 
the first publishing houses in the Unit 
ed States, with the view evidently of 
establishing a standard history of 
"Mormonism," gives full credence to 
everything that has been said against 
us, but the author invariably cautions 
his readers against every quotation he 
makes from our own works— and yet 
that book is put forth as an impartial 
history of "Mormonism ! " Some have at- 
tempted to write from a philosophical 
standpoint, but with the result that 
they plainly manifest that they hav* 
not yet reached foundation principles 
upon which they can satisfactorily ac- 
count for Joseph Smith the Prophet, 
and the great work that he accomplish- 
ed. Whenever I see my enemy shifting 
his ground; whenever I see that his eye 
is not steady, but shifts to the right 
or to the left, or looks behind, that 
evidence of uncertainty, of indecision, 
tells me that I am his master. So, too! 
with reference to the great work of 
God. When I see men shifting their 
grounds, and advancing first one theory 
and then another to account for "Mor- 
monism," and there is confusion among 
them, uncertainty, indecision — I know 
that the citadel of our mighty faith is 
secure from harm from their attacks; 
that "Mormonism" cannot fall a victim 
to Iheir philosophies or their argu- 
ments. 

Let me, for a little while, draw your 
attention to at least one of the so-called 
philosophical solutions of "Mormon- 
ism;" a scientific accounting for Joseph 
Smith. The work I allude to was of- 
fered to Yale University as a thesis 
upon which the author hoped to secure, 
and I think he did secure, the degree 
of Bachelor of Philosophy. He candid- 
ly confesses that it is an effort to ac- 
count for Joseph Smith upon some oth- 
er hypothesis than that he was a con- 
scious fraud, bent on deceiving man- 
kind. When an intelligent man makes 
such an announcement as that, I know, 
and you know, that the theories hereto- 
fore advanced to account for Joseph 
Smith are unsatisfactory, that they 



74 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



have failed. The theory that Joseph 
Smith was a conscious fraud has fallen 
to the ground. The charges frequently- 
made and persistently urged that 
"Mormonism" had its origin in decep- 
tion and conscious fraud have failed of 
their purpose. The floods of falsehood 
with which some men have sought to 
overwhelm "Mormonism" have not ac- 
complished the end proposed. The Lat- 
ter-day Saints, after about three- 
quarters of a century of existence, 
stand above all the floods of falsehood 
that have been belched out against 
them. The work of God has not brok- 
en donvn, it has survived; and the 
Saints smilingly pity those who would 
make use of such contemptible means 
with which to combat the truth of Al- 
mighty God. Now, however, we are to 
be treated philosophically. And the 
philosophy that is advanced is, uncon- 
scious hallucination in the mind of Jo- 
seph Smith; partly unconscious and 
partly conscious possession of hypnotic 
power, by which the minds of those 
arcund him were dominated and made 
to see things which in reality had no 
existence; and while the witnesses to 
the Book of Mormon, and others tes- 
tify of visions and voices from God 
honestly enough, still as a matter of 
fact those revelations had really no 
objective existence, but were mental 
hallucinations. And as for Joseph 
Smith, he was deceived by epileptic 
conditions. The author I am consid- 
ering is at great pains to trace the 
ancestry of the Prophet, pointing out 
their mental peculiarities and supposed 
defects, leading up ■ to the conclusion 
that these defects of mind in his an- 
cestors culminated in epilepsy in Jo- 
seph Smith. And hence, we have as 
the explanation of "Mormonism," epil- 
eptic fits in its Prophet, whose halluci* 
nations are honestly mistaken for in- 
spired visions, with partly conscious 
and partly unconscious hypnotic pow j 
ers over others! And this theory if! 
presented seriously to one of the first 
institutions of learning in America as 
a rational explanation of how "Mor- 
monism" came into existence! 

Ernest Renan, the French philoso- 



pher, when considering a similar hy- 
pothesis to account for the Lord Jesus 
Christ, overthrew all that kind of 
sophistry with this simple statement: 
"It has never been given to the mere 
aberrations of the human mind to re- 
sult in the establishment of permanent 
institutions that influence any consid- 
erable number of people." In other 
words, the dreams and halluc'nations 
of the epileptic end in mere dreams 
and hallucinations; they never crystal - 
ize into great systems of philosophy or 
into rational religious institutions. They 
never crystalize into great organiza- 
tions capable of perpetuating that 
philosophy and that religion in the 
world. No matter how nearly genius 
may be allied to madness, it must re- 
main genius and not degenerate to 
madness if it exercises any permanent 
influence over the minds of men. 

There is much glamor of sophistry, 
which may be taken for profound rea- 
son and argument, in the work to which 
I call your attention. But one word 
answers this philosophical accounting 
for our Prophet. The work accom- 
plished by him, the institutions he 
founded, destroy the whole fabric of 
premises and argument on which this 
theory is based. Great as was the 
Prophet Joseph Smith — and he v/as 
great; to him more than to any o.her 
man of modern times was it given to 
look deep into the things that are; to 
comprehend the heavens and the laws 
that obtain there; to understand the 
earth, its history, and i(s mission. He 
looked into the deep things of God — al- 
ways, be it remembered, by the inspi- 
ration of God — and cut of the rich 
treasure of divine knowledge he 
brought forth things both new and old 
for the instruction of our race, the like 
of which, in some respects, had not been 
known in previous dispensations. Hence 
I repeat that Joseph Sm'th was great; 
but great as he was, rising up and 
towering far above him >.s the work 
that he accomplished through divine 
guidance; that work is infinitely great- 
er than the prophet — greater than all 
the prophets connected with it. its 
consistency, its permanency, its pow-

er, its institutions, contradict the hal- 
lucination theory advanced to account 
for its origin. 

Let us look at this work for a mo- 
ment. If one could but draw it clear- 
ly in outline, and prerent it in its orig- 
inality and greatness, it *vaujd be its 
own witness of its divinity; for in all 
things it transcends the mere wit of 
man. Take the Church organisation for 
illustration; and look at it with refer- 
ence to its being and assemblage of 
means to the accompHshment of an 
end. As I understand the Church of 
Christ its mission is two-fold: first, it 
is to proclaim the truth; second, it -is 
to perfect those who receive the truth. 
I think these two things cover, in a 
general way, the entire mission of the 
Church. Is its organization competent 
to attain those two mighty ends? Let 
us see; and first as to the proclamation 
of the truth — the work really of the 
foreign ministry. What pr«jv5sion has 
God made fov tha" 7 He has m His 
Church, first of .'ill Twelve Special Wit- 
nesses, the Twelve Apostles, who were 
chosen in the first instance, by the 
Three Special Witnesses to the Book 
of Mormon. I remark in passing that 
there is a peculiar fitness in the Twelve 
Apostles — the Twelve Special Witness- 
es being chosen by those who had been 
made Witnesses for God by the great 
vision and revelation He had given 
them concerning the absolute truth 
and correctness of the Book of Mor- 
mon. Upon these Twelve Apostles 
rests the responsibility of being wit- 
nesses for the Lord Jesus Christ in all 
the world. That is their special, pecu- 
liar calling. You can see, however, if 
you take into account the extent of 
their field of labor — for it encompasses 
the whole round world — that twelve 
men would not be adequate to meet all 
the requirements of the foreign minis- 
try. God knew this, and hence He 
called into existence other spe- 
cial witnesses, to labor under the 
direction of these twelve, they holding 
the keys to open the door of the Gos- 
pel to all the nations of the earth; for 
all must hear it, from the greatest to 
the least. The Twelve, I say, hold the 



keys of this foreign ministry; and 
hence whenever there has been an 
opening of the door of the Gospel to a 
foreign nation, one or more of these 
men holding the keys have been sent to 
do it. It was for this reason that He- 
ber C. Kimball, one of the Twelve 
Apostles, was sent to Great Britain in 
1837, to open the door of the Gospel in 
that land; why Elder John Taylor was 
sent to France and Germany; why El- 
der Lorenzo Snow was sent to Italy and 
Switzerland; why Erastus Snow was 
sent to the Scandinavian countries; 
why Parley P. Pratt went to Chili and 
opened the door of the Gospel to the 
South American Republics; why, more 
recently, Elder Heber J. Grant was sent 
to Japan to open a mission. Wheth- 
er he has accomplished, in his own es- 
timation much or little, it was for the 
reason that he held the Keys of this 
ministry that he was sent to the great 
enpire of Japan, to open the door of 
the Gospel in that land; and to open 
the door of the Gospel to so great an 
empire is of itself a very great work; 
and will be accounted as one of the 
chief items in Elder Grant's 
career as an Apostle. The Twelve 
then hold the keys of this min- 
istry, and upon them devolves this 
responsibility of opening the door of 
salvation to the nations. But after 
them, other witnesses are chosen. These 
are the seventy apostles, or special 
witnesses, the assistants of the Twelve; 
under whose directions they labor. At 
first, two quorums of Seventy only were 
organized; but with the promise of the 
Prophet that as the work should ex- 
pand other quorums would be organ- 
ized, not only till seven times seven 
quorums should be brought into exist- 
ence, but until seventy times seven; 
"aye," said he, "until there shall be a 
hundred and forty and four thousand 
seventies chosen, if the work of the 
ministry shall require it." So we have 
continued organizing quorums of Sev- 
enty, to labor in the foreign ministry, 
until now we have one nundred and 
forty-three quorums in the Church — a 
bodly of nearly ten thousand men. They 
are special witnesses of the name of 
Christ in all the world, and when their 



76 



GENERAL, CONFERENCE. 



numbers are considered, together with 
the privilege we have of increasing 
them, you can see that ample pro- 
vision is made, in this respect, for the 
work of the foreign ministry. 

But now let us consider their organ- 
ization for a moment. Sixty-three 
members with seven presidents, when 
the quorum is complete, constitute a 
quorum. Suppose you were to send an 
entire quorum of Seventy bodily into 
the world — I hope that will be done 
some day — you could break that quor- 
um into groups of ten. You could send 
with each group a President. It should 
be remembered here that these Presi- 
dents are equal in authority. The coun- 
cil of a quorum of Seventy is made up 
of seven Presidents, not one President 
and six Counselors — but of seven Pres- 
idents equal in authority. For the sake 
of order in administration, however, 
the right of initiative and presidency 
in the council is recognized as being 
vested in the senior member by ordina- 
tion, not of age. And this principle is 
observed not only in the case of the 
first or senior president, but all down 
the line in the First Council, and in all 
quorum councils of the Seventies. By 
this simple arrangement all confusion 
as to the right of presidency is obvi- 
ated; for no sooner does the Council 
of a quorum, or any part thereof, 
meet, in any part of the world than 
each President knows at once upon 
whom the responsibility of initiative, 
of presidency, rests. But to return to 
the groups of ten into which the quor- 
um can be divided, with a President 
for each group. You could break 
each group of ten into five pairs, and 
scatter them out among the people, to 
bear effectual witness of the truth of 
the Gospel under the provision of the 
law of the Gospel; for it is the law of 
the Gospel that the Elders should trav- 
el two and two, mainly for the reason, 
I suppose, that God has declared that 
He would establish his word in the 
mouth of two or three witnesses; and 
it is good when bearing testimony to 
the world that there should be the le- 
gal number of witnesses provided for 
in the law of God. Moreover, there is 
a very much needed companionship 



and sympathy provided for when the 
Elders travel two and two; and they 
are a protection one to the other. You 
could scatter these groups of ten in 
one or more states or countries; and 
they could occasionally meet in group 
conferences, exchange experiences, 
give advice and counsel; after which 
refreshing they could again divide into 
pairs, scatter and so continue their 
ministry. Occasionally the seven groups 
of the quorum could be brought togeth- 
er in general quorum conference, to 
take counsel for making their ministry 
more and ever more effectual: to re- 
adjust methods; to plan new cam- 
paigns; to strengthen each other 
by a mutual exchange of ex- 
periences and sympathy; and do what- 
ever else their combined wisdom, helped 
by the inspiration of the Lord, would 
suggest as right and proper to do in 
the furtherance of their high aim in 
bringing to pass the salvation of men. 
Such are the possibilities of a quorum 
of Seventy. It may become a veritable 
flying column of witnesses for God, 
sweeping the earth with the testimony 
of Jesus, and calling the inhabitants of 
the earth unto repentance! Can you 
think of this beautiful arrangement for 
the foreign ministry as having its ori- 
gin in the alleged epileptic hallucina- 
tions of man? Such a conception is 
palpably absurd, and utterly revolting 
to reason. 

Turn now for a moment to the home 
ministry of the Church, and what have 
you? You have your stake organiza- 
tion, with its Presidency of three 
presiding High Priests, aided ir 
their counsels and labors by the 
High Council of the stake, con- 
sisting of twelve High Priests. This 
council also constitutes a judicial body 
for the settlement of difficulties that 
may not be satisfactorily adjusted in the 
Bishop's courts. It is, however, an ec- 
clesiastical court of original as well as 
of appellate jurisdiction. You have a 
Bishopric in the respective wards of 
the Church, constituting the local pres- 
idency of the Aaronic Priesthood, with 
quorums of Priests, Teahers and Dea- 
cons to aid them in the work of their 
ministry. The Deacons take care of 



ELDER BRIGHAM H. ROBERTS.

the house of the Lord, and are to be as- 
sistants to the Teachers when occasion 
requires. The Teachers are the watch- 
men upon the towers of Zion, and it is 
their business to see that there is no 
iniquity in the Church — no backbiting, 
no faultfinding-, and that the members 
attend to their religious duties. The 
Priests' duty is to visit the homes of 
the people and instruct them in the 
Gospel. Parenthetically I might say 
that T marvel sometimes that the 
Saints do not avail themselves of this 
help in the management of their house- 
holds. Where they have sons or 
daughters who will not be amenable to 
the instructions of parents, the priests 
with very great propriety could be in- 
vited to meet with them and teach the 
sublime truths of the Gospel. In addi- 
tion to these officers of the wards and 
the stakes,, there is in each stake a 
quorum of High Priests, and one or 
more quorums of Elders. These con- 
stitute the standing ministry in the 
stakes of Zion, and are authorized to 
teach the Gospel, to warn all men 
against evil, and to invite and per- 
suade all men to come unto Christ. 
These are the Drovisions made for the 
home ministry, in the Church organiza- 
tion proper. Time will not admit ref- 
erence to the auxiliary organizations — 
the Sabbath schools, Improvement as- 
sociations, Relief societies, Primary so- 
cieties, and Religion classes. But from 
the fireside of the people to the public 
assembly of worship; from the cradle 
to the grave, every provision is made 
for canning on the work of the min- 
istry, at home, instructing the Saints 
in the things of God, inviting all to 
come unto Christ; the object of the 
Church being to lift to higher, and 
still higher levels the lives of the Saints 
of God, until they shall become perfect 
men and women in Christ Jesus the 
Lord. Such are the arrangements, in 
brief, for the home ministry. 

Notwithstanding the clear distinc- 
tions between the foreign ministry and 
the home ministry, the lines that sep- 
arate them may be crossed on occa- 
sion. You remember how Paul com- 
pares the Church of Christ to the body 
of a man, and insists that every mem- 



ber and every organ is necessary 
to the perfect working of that organ- 
ism; that the head cannot say to the 
feetj I have no need of thee; neither 
can the feet say to the head, I have 
no need of thee; nor the hand to the 
eye, I have no need of thee; all the 
members of the body, he argues, are 
necessary. Now, what would you think 
of a body that possessed a right hand 
and left hand, yet the right hand would 
not at need come to the help of the 
left hand; or the left hand re- 
fuse to come to the aid of the 
right hand? You expect the two hands 
and arms of a man's body to help each 
other, under the direction of the in- 
telligence of the mind. And so in the 
Church of Christ. The home minis- 
try and the foreign ministry cross the 
line of separation as occasion requires, 
and come to the assistance of one an- 
other in accomplishing the purposes 
of God. Sometimes the officers who 
are particularly charged with the fore- 
ign ministry help at home; the home 
ministry sometimes help in the foreign 
ministry; but all work harmoniously 
together. 

Rising above both these great divi- 
sions of the Priesthood stands, as the 
keystone in the arch, the Presidency 
of the Church, having control over both 
departments, and directing the work 
of God in all the world. Their juris- 
diction extends to every corner of the 
earth. No branch of the Church, how- 
ever remote, is beyond their over- 
sight. No Elder, let him be traveling 
where he will, is outside the pale of 
their authority. Talk of catholicity 
being one of the marks of the true 
Church of Christ, as our Catholic 
friends sometimes do, they shall find 
here in the Church of Christ a catholi- 
city such as they have never dreamed 
of. The Church is the church univer- 
sal; and the President of the Church 
holds universal jurisdiction. Moreover, 
as Prophet, Seer and Revelator of the 
Church he is the source through which 
God speaks, not only to this people, 
not only to the Church of Christ, but 
to all the inhabitants of the earth, 
and God will hold them accountable 
for the use they make of the words 



78 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



He shall speak through His appointed 
mouthpiece. Do not think that this 
man's authority is limited to this 
Church alone. All the inhabitants of 
the earth are children of God, and He 
will deliver His word unto them 
through His prophet. I rather like 
the idea that all the inhabitants of the 
earth belong to us — they are God's 
children, though some of them are in 
rebellion and will not heed the com- 
mandments of their Father just now. 
But here in the Church of Christ is the 
center of ecclesiastical government. 
Here shine forth those rays of light 
that will grow brighter and brighter 
until all the inhabitants of the earth 
are enlightened by them. 

Now, what do you think of this ef- 
fort of philosophy to account for "Mor- 
monism?" How insipid, how foolish, 
how contemptible, how inadequate are 
the theories of men to account for even 
the organization of this Church! The 
Church is its own witness! As the 
stars, "singing ever as they shine, pro- 
claim the hand that made them is di- 
vine," so, too, this work, the restored 
Gospel— the Church of Christ— pro- 
claims that it has a divine origin, and 
that there is in it a divine power work- 
ing out the purposes of God. Then let 
the imitators go on. Let them choose 
Apostles, if they want to — and some of 
them have them; let them have Seven- 
ties, if they want to, and some of them 
have them; let them accent this doc- 
trine and that doctrine until they shall 
have the complete organization and the 
complete doctrine in form, if they want 
to; but there is one thing they never 
can get, worlds without end, and that 
is the spirit of this work, which gives 
it life and power. This work will al- 
ways be distinguished from the works 
of men, in that there will be imminent 
in it the Spirit of God working His 
sovereign will. And that is something 
they cannot imitate. 

My brethren and sisters I rejoice in 
the truth. I rejoice in the Gospel of 
Jesus Christ. It satisfies me complete- 
ly. It responds to the hungering of my 
spirit. It meets the demands also of 
my intellectual nature. And as I see 
the growth of intelligence among men, 



an increase of scientific knowledge, a 
broader understanding of the universe, 
a comprehension of the extent and 
grandeur of the works of God, I see in 
"Mormonism" that which rises up to 
meet this enlarged knowledge of man. 
"Mormonism" teaches man that he is 
a child of God; it tells him that he 
has in him divine elements that par- 
take of the nature of God; that he may 
live forever, and that he may go on 
from one degree of excellence unto an- 
other until he shall attain unto some- 
thing that is truly grand, truly great, 
worthy of a God to give, and worthy of 
a Son of God to receive. 

I rejoice in these truths. They can- 
not be accounted for by any theory 
that refers their origin to hallucina- 
tions of an epileptic's mind. They are 
too substantial, too grand, too rational, 
too sublime, too soul inspiring, to have 
any such contemptible origin. Their 
own intrinsic value — their own self evi- 
dent truth— the institution to which 
they are committed as to a sacred de- 
pository for the benefit of mankind — 
The Church — all this proclaims their di- 
vine origin. 

May God seal the truths of the Gos- 
pel upon our hearts, and make them 
precious to us, is my humble prayer 
in the name pf Jesus. Amen. 

PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 

While 1 realize, as you all do doubt- 
less, that it may be wholly unneces- 
sary for me to say what I am going to 
say, yet I feel prompted to say it, and 
let it go for what it is worth. I have 
been delighted with the most excellent 
discourse that we have listened to; but 
I desire to say that it is a wonderful 
revelation to the Latter-day Saints, and 
especially to those who were familiar 
with the Prophet Joseph Smith, to learn 
in these latter days that he was an 
epileptic! I will simply remark, God 
be praised, that there are so many still 
living who knew the Prophet Joseph 
well, and who are in a position to bear 
testimony to the truth that no such 
condition ever existed in the man. He 
was never troubled with epilepsy. Of 
course, this may be unnecessary to say,

after the magnificent arraignment 
made by Brother Roberts of this fal- 
lacious, foolish, nonsensical theory — 
this "fried froth" — gotten up by vain 
philosophers to account for something 
they would like to destroy from off the 
face of the earth, but are impotent to 
do it. 

The choir and congregation sang the 
hymn which begins: 

Guide us, O Thou great Jehovah. 

Benediction was pronounced by El- 
der Joseph M. Tanner. 



CLOSING SESSION. 

Tuesday, Oct. 6, 2 p. m. 

The choir and congregation sang: 

How firm a foundation, ye Saints of the 
Lord, 

Is laid for your faith in His excellent 
word! 

What more can He say than to you He 

hath said, 
You who unto Jesus for refuge hath 

fled. 

Opening prayer was offered by Elder 
Joseph E. Taylor. 
The choir and congregation sang: 

Now let us rejoice in the day of salva- 
tion, 

No longer as strangers on earth need 
we roam; 
Good tidings are sounding to us and 
each nation, 
And shortly the hour of redemption 
will come. 



PRESIDENT JOHN R. WINDER. 

Distinction between gathering of the Saints and 
Salvation Army colonization — Law of tithing — 
Acceptance of principles of the Gospel would 
benefit the world— Sacredness of Temple work. 

I am very glad, brethren and sisters, 
to have another opportunity of meeting 
with you in this conference, and I pray 
that the Spirit of the Lord may be 
abundantly poured out upon us this 
afternoon, as it has been thus far. 

Two or three things were mentioned 
yesterday that I have thought about 
today. One was in relation to gather- 



ing. A comparison was made between 
the gathering of the Latter-day Saints 
and the colonization or gathering of the 
Salvation Army. It struck me very 
forcibly that there was no proper com- 
parison between them. The gathering 
of the Latter-day Saints was inaugurat- 
ed by revelation, through Joseph Smith 
the Prophet. It is part and parcel of 
the Gospel of this last dispensation, and 
it was preached in a very early day. 
I remember distinctly that when I 
first heard the Gospel there was little 
said about the gathering; but, it was 
very remarkable that every person who 
received the Gospel began to prepare 
to gather with the Saints. When they 
received the Gospel they received the 
spirit of gathering with it. As I under- 
stand it, the Salvation Army is simply 
colonizing. Consequently, I think there 
is considerable difference between the 
gathering of the Latter-day Saints and 
the colonization of the Salvation Army. 

Another matter mentioned was in re- 
lation to tithing. It was stated that 
some of the Christian denominations 
are commencing to pay tithing. Now, 
I remember that as long ago as when I 
was a member of the Church of Eng- 
land, the principle of tithing was 
taught in that church. But, there was 
one difference between the tithing col- 
lected there and the tithing of the 
Latter-day Saints: one was collected by 
law, the other is a voluntary contribu- 
tion. I have known a parson to send 
his team into the grain field and take 
the tenth shock of grain out of the field, 
if the man did not pay the money. I 
have seen this done myself. So it is 
nothing particularly new to them, 
though it may be to the Methodists. I 
look upon the tithing of the Latter- 
day Saints as entirely different to that 
practised by other denominations. The 
principle of tithing came to us by reve- 
lation, the same as did all the ordin- 
ances of the Church. 

Again, while the brethren were speak- 
ing of these organizations accepting 
some of the principles of the Gospel, it 
occurred to me that it would not be a 
bad thing if they accepted every one of 
the principles of the Gospel, provided 
they practised them, because it would

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



have the effect to better the condition 
of all the people in the world. I have 
the same opinion regarding that as I 
have in relation to the ordinances in 
the temples. It has been said that 
things are taught in the temples which 
cannot be spoken of outside. I want to 
tell you — and you who have been there 
know what I say is the truth — that 
every principle taught there is of a 
holy and sacred character. They are 
all calculated to make people better, to 
make better fathers, better mothers, 
and better citizens of the United States. 
This statement could be verified by 
thousands in this congregation. So true 
is this that one president of a stake 
has commenced to organize the people 
in his stake to go to the temple and 
work for the dead; and one reason he 
assigns for doing this is that the people 
who attend to ordinance work in the 
temple make better members of a ward, 
better fathers and mothers, and better 
citizens; consequently he wants all the 
people in his stake to go to the temple, 
and partake of the blessings and spirit 
of that holy house. I think this is an 
example that might well be followed 
by other stakes of Zion, where they 
are so situated that they can do it. The 
Prophet Joseph Smith said shortly be- 
fore his death, that the one thing that 
was exercising his mind more than 
any other was in relation to the ord- 
inances for the dead. It is true, a con- 
siderable work has been and' is being 
done in our temples. About 2,490,000 
ordinances have been performed in all 
the temples, and about 78,000 have been 
performed during the past year in the 
Salt Lake Temple. But we can do more. 
If this is as important as the Prophet 
Joseph said it was surely it is our duty 
to attend to it, and not put it off when 
we have the opportunity. This is a 
matter worthy the consideration of all 
the presidents of stakes. Let them en- 
courage their people to go to the house 
of the Lord, and redeem the dead. 

May the Lord bless us in all our 
labors, and may we so live before 
the Lord that we may always have a 
claim upon His promised blessings, is 
my prayer in the name of Jesus. Amen. 



PRESIDENT ANTHON H. LUND. 

Comprehensive redemption — Salvation include 8 
dead as well as livng — Sacredness of work done 
in Temples. 

The subject Brother Winder alluded 
to — work for the dead — is a very inter- 
esting one. It is a principle peculiar to 
the Gospel as preached by us. There 
are churches whose members believe in 
praying for the dead; but we believe in 
working for the dead. It was a new 
thing when the Prophet Joseph laid 
this principle before the world. The 
Christian world had been taught for 
hundreds of years that death ends all 
with man; that if he did not believe 
in Christ at his death there was no 
hope for him. When you consider the 
small number of the inhabitants of the 
world who have heard of the name of 
Christ, and then think of all the rest 
being damned because they did not 
obey that which they had never heard, 
the inconsistency and injustice of such 
a doctrine as that is very apparent. 
The Gospel of Christ was formulated in 
love. God is love. He loved His chil- 
dren so much that He sent His Only 
Begotten Son, who gave Himself a sac- 
rifice for the sins of all. Jesus came 
and filled His mission. His name has 
been preached to the nations for cen- 
turies. Yet the Christian world today 
does not constitute a third of the whole 
population of the globe. The other two- 
thirds do not believe in Christ, and 
when they die, according to some, their 
chance of salvation is gone. We believe 
that the Gospel is much broader than 
this. We believe that the plan of sal- 
vation, formulated before this earth 
rolled into existence, was framed by 
heavenly beings who could see the fut- 
ure, and who understood what would 
take place, and were able to provide for 
the salvation of all who should inhabit 
this earth. They did so. We have 
learned, through the Prophet Joseph, 
that there is a possibility for those who 
have departed, to hear the truth, to 
believe in God and in His Son, to re- 
pent, and to have the ordinances of the 
Gospel performed for them. I know 
that many have held that these doc- 
trines are blasphemous; but they are 



PRESIDENT ANTHON H. LUND. 



81 



not. They are principles that give 
hope unto men. You have heard per- 
haps of the Dutch chief who was 
converted by the Christians, and, 
as he was going to step into the waters 
of baptism, he asked what had 
become of his father and his forefath- 
ers. The priest who was to baptize him, 
being a little more zealous than wise 
perchance, told him they had all gone 
to hell. He stepped back and said, 
"Then I want to go where they have 
gone." Now, those who hear the Gos- 
pel today may ask where their fore- 
fathers have gone, and it can be said 
to them, "They all shall hear the name 
of Christ, for the Gospel will be 
preached unto them. If they have not 
heard it here, they will hear it yonder; 
and every knee shall bow, and every 
tongue shall confess His name." Re- 
member, it is the spirit in man that 
hears, and understand?, and wills. 
This tabernacle of clay is not capable 
of these functions. The spirit uses the 
different senses to obtain perceptions 
from the outer world. And when the 
spirit, after leaving the body, goes 
into the spirit world, it can still think, 
and will, and reason. The intelligent 
part of man does not die. At some 
time or other, those authorized to 
preach the Gospel will minister unto 
the spirits in the spirit world and lay 
before them the glorious principles of 
truth. When the thief on the cross 
asked the Savior to remember him 
when He came into His kingdom, Jesus 
saw that the man was penitent, that he 
had a broken heart and a contrite 
spirit, and he comforted him with the 
promise that "today shalt thou be with 
me in paradise." I do not think He 
held out a fallacious hope to this man 
when He said that he should be with 
Him in paradise that day. I believe 
that when the Savior's spirit left His 
body hanging upon the tree, it went 
into paradise, and He gladdened the 
hearts of the spirits there with the 
glorious tidings that He had conquered, 
that He had given His life for their 
redemption, and that everything they 
had done in their worship pointing for- 
ward to His great sacrifice had been 



fulfilled, thereby giving validity to their 
acts. 

What joy must have filled them 
when they heard this! But He did not 
visit them alone. He went further 
into the spirit world. He visited the 
spirits in prison who had once heard 
and rejected the Gospel. He preach- 
ed the Gospel unto them, so Peter 
tells us. Peter also gives us to under- 
stand who they were. They were the 
antediluvians who rejected the message 
of salvation as preached by the Gospel- 
preacher Noah. These heard the voice 
of the Savior in the spirit world. No 
doubt they had ample time to con- 
sider and repent of their acts, and were 
longing for the time spoken of by Isa- 
iah, when the prison doors should be 
opened and the captives should go free. 
Christ did this, according to Peter's 
(testimony. Why did He preach to 
them? Some have held that He did so 
to tantalize them over what they had 
lost. Oh, no! That was not the mis- 
sion of Jesus. He preached glad tid- 
ings unto them, and He opened their 
prison doors. An opportunity was giv- 
en in the spirit world for them 
to receive and obey the Gospel. So 
with our forefathers, who died without 
a knowledge of the purposes of God. 
They will have a chance to hear and 
receive the Gospel. 

Jesus, in His interview with Nicode- 
mus, laid down the law which must be 
obeyed by all who shall enter the king- 
dom of heaven. "Except a man be 
born of water and of the Spirit, he 
cannot enter into the kingdom of God." 
In other words, the law was laid down 
in the eternal councils that baptism is 
necessary to salvation. But the spir- 
its cannot be baptized. How, there- 
fore, can they obey this law? It must 
be borne in mind that Jesus extended 
this law to all. Some have gone so 
far as to say that it includes little 
children also; but the Lord has reveal- 
ed unto us that children, before they 
arrive at the years of accountability, 
are without sin, and therefore it is noi 
necessary to baptize them, baptism be- 
ing for the remission of sin. On one oc- 
casion Jesus held up a little child and 



82 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



said unto His disciples, "iGxcept ye be 
converted, and become as little chil- 
dren, ye shall not enter into the king- 
dom of heaven." On another occasion, 
in speaking of children, He said, 'Of 
such is the kingdom of heaven." But 
after they arrive at the years of ac- 
countability they must obey this law. 
This law applying to all men, how shall 
those who have died obey It? ^-od. m 
His mercy, has provided that others 
may perform this ordinance for them 
in the flesh, and this vicarious work is 
attended to in temples. "We thank the 
Lord for this glorious doctrine. It 
raises our hopes for those whom we 
love and who did not obey the require- 
ments of the Gospel in life. We re- 
joice that they can have the oppor- 
tunity in the other life. But those in 
this mortal life must be baptized for 
them. 

This is not a new doctrine. Paul 
understood it, and used it in his day 
as a strong argument in favor of the 
resurrection. Of what use would it be 
to baptize anyone if there were no 
resurrection? Read the 29th verse of 
the 15th chapter of First Corinthians: 

"Else what shall they do which are 
baptized for the dead, if the dead rise 
not at all? Why are they then bap- 
tized for the dead?" 

When in England I attended the fun- 
eral of a member of the English church 
and heard the officiating clergyman 
read the beautiful chapter containing 
this verse, I wondered what they 
thought of that verse. But they read it 
and never commented upon it. I see, 
though, that Dean Farrar in his book 
on "The Early Days of Christianity," 
says, "If Christ preached to dead men 
who were once disobedient then Scrip- 
ture shows us that the moment of death 
does not necessarily involve a final and 
hopeless torment for every sinful soul." 
Now, we believe that the law laid down 
by Jesus to Nicodemus must be obeyed, 
and that men in the flesh can obey it 
by proxy for those who have departed. 
For this reason we have built temples. 
Tou may say we have only a small 
number of temples, that very few can 
enter there, and that the myriads of 
spirits in the spirit world cannot be 



reached by the mere handful of people 
who are performing vicarious work 
here on the earth. In answer to this 
I will say we believe there will be ample 
time in the future. We do all that is in 
our power while God gives us days to 
live in, and we know there are many 
more going to join the ranks of the 
Saints. The Gospel will spread, this 
land will be the land of Zion, temples 
will be built in various localities, from 
one end of it to the other, and the 
Saints of God living in the Millennium 
will have this precious labor to per- 
form. Then the veil, I believe, will be 
much thinner between the spirit world 
and this; and we will work for the 
dead, not only in faith that those for 
whom we labor will accept the Gospel, 
but with an actual knowledge that they 
are longing for the work to be done. I 
look upon the work for the dead as a 
most glorious principle. 

While I am speaking about the Tem- 
ples, I want to make a declaration here 
before you, my brethren and sisters. 
We have been accused of entering into 
covenants in those holy edifices which 
are unpatriotic and against our gov- 
ernment. Now. I declare here solemnly 
before you that there is not a word of 
truth in it; that nobody is called upon 
to take oath or covenant that militates 
against our government in the least de- 
gree. On the other hand, I will say 
that those who obey the covenants they 
enter into there will be better citizens 
because of it. They cannot help it, be- 
cause they make covenants there to 
serve the Lord, to do right unto their 
neighbors, to live pure lives; and when 
men do this they will be the best citi- 
zens. I suppose there are thousands be- 
fore me in this Tabernacle who have 
gone into our temples, and they know 
it is true what I say. I would not dare 
to say this before you, if it were not 
so. I hear that sectarian organiza- 
tions are going to bring up the alleged 
endowment oath against Senator 
Smoot, arguing that he is not capa- 
ble of giving allegiance to the govern- 
ment on account of the oath he is said 
to have taken in the Temple. First, 
there is no oath given or taken; but 
sacred covenants are entered into; and

secondly, there is not one — I say it 
again — that is against the government 
or against a man being patriotic and 
sustaining the laws of his country. 

Brethren and sisters, I feel well to 
be present with you. I have rejoiced 
in this conference. I hope the spirit 
of it will go with us to our different 
places of abode, and that the spirit of 
Zion may grow, and union and pros- 
perity prevail amongst the Saints. I 
ask this in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

PATRIARCH JOHN SMITH. 

A reference to the past — Encouragement to faith- 
fulness — The youth should prepare for the work 
of the ministry. 

My brothers and sisters, it is with 
peculiar feelings that I stand before 
you on this occasion. For one thing, it 
-is rather unexpected to me. I feel to 
ask for your faith and prayers, that 
something may be brought to my mind 
that shall edify you and myself. I have 
listened attentively to the remarks 
made by those who have addressed us 
during this conference, and I bean tes- 
timony that what has been said to us 
is true and profitable. Those who have 
talked to us have done so under the in- 
spiration of the Spirit of the Lord. The 
counsels they have given to us are 
good, and should sink deep into our 
hearts, and cause us to profit by what 
we have heard. 

In looking at this congregation, my 
mind reverts to early youth. In my 
association with the Church, from its 
early history up to the present, I have 
seen vast changes among the people. 
When I look around and try to discover 
those who were companions of my 
youth, I find they are getting very 
scarce. I met one man this morning 
who was a member of the Church in 
Kirtland, Ohio. He is the first one I 
have met for a long time. Very few 
remain of those who were my com- 
panions in Nauvoo, and I sometimes 
become lonesome, because the faces of 
those I was acquainted with then have 
faded away. In their stead, others 
have become prominent, and as has 
been predicted, we have become a srreat 
and mighty people in the valleys of tht, 
mountains. 



I want to encourage the Saints to 
faithfulness, and diligence in the per- 
formance of duty. Realizing that our 
time in this probation is short, we 
should strive to perform the labors and 
duties enjoined upon us in that way 
and manner that shall meet the ap- 
proval of our Father in heaven. I often 
hear people speak of a hobby. If I have 
one, it is to exhort my young brethren 
especially to faithfulness, to diligence 
in duty, to listen to and be guided by 
the whisperings of the Spirit, and to 
acquire learning and information that 
will prepare them for the duties of the 
future. The Gospel must be preached 
to all nations, kindred, tongues and 
people, and our boys must learn their 
duty and prepare their minds for that 
important work. We understand that 
the greater the harvest, the more har- 
vest hands we need. I exhort the boys 
particularly to prepare themselves for 
the ministry; to attend Mutual Im- 
provement associations and schools; 
get their lessons properly, and be ready 
when they are called to go on missions 
on this continent, or to the other na- 
tions of the earth, or upon the islands 
of the sea, that they may go with an 
understanding of what they are sent 
for, and be qualified to carry the mes- 
sage of life and salvation unto all those 
who will listen. In this Church every 
person has certain duties to perform. 
We understand that we should pay 
tithes and offerings, and attend to our 
prayers. We also understand the 
meaning of the old adage, Do unto 
others as we would they should do unto 
us. Let us act according to our under- 
standing, that we may fill our mission 
upon the earth in honor before God. 

May the blessings of our Heavenly 
Father attend all Israel. May He con- 
tinue to guide us in the true path, and 
fit and prepare us for every event of 
His providence, and, when we have fin- 
ished our course, may we be worthy of 
the blessings He has in store for His 
people, is my prayer in the name of 
Jesus. Amen.

song entitled:

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 
Latter-day Saints a free people. 

We will now present before the con- 
ference the names of the general au- 
thorities of the Church.with the earnest 
desire that all the members of the 
Church present, who by reason of their 
good standing before the Lord are en- 
titled to the privilege, will express their 
will according to the God-given agency 
that every man in the world enjoys.and 
which is not lessened, but rather in- 
creased, in all those who have made 
covenant with God by sacrifice and 
through obedience to the principles of 
the Gospel. The freedom of the Latter- 
day Saints has never been curtailed or 
lessened one whit by their becoming 
members of the Church of Christ. 
Rather has it been enlarged. There 
are no freer people upon the face of 
the earth today than the Latter-day 
Saints. They are bound to the Church 
by no ties or strings, but their own 
conviction of the truth. And whenever 
a man makes up his mind that he has 
had enough of what is called "Mormon- 
ism," all he has to do is to make it 
known and we will sever the bond that 
unites him with the body, and let him 
go his own way, only bearing toward 
him the feeling of sympathy and of true 
brotherly kindness, and wishing him 
still the mercies of God. We will cry, 
Father., have mercy upon him, because 
he knows not what he is doing. For 
when a man denies the truth, when he 
departs from the right way, when he 
rejects the right of God to counsel in 
the affairs of men, he is either ig- 
norant or wilfully wicked, and it only 
excites our pity for him. As the Sa- 
vior cried upon the cross, so will we 
cry in the same spirit, Father, forgive 
him; have mercy upon him; for he 
knows not what he does. Therefore, 
we expect only those to vote at this 
time who are members of the Church in 
good standing; but all such we do ex- 
pect to vote, according to their own 
free will, whether it be yea or nay. 
However, we wish it distinctly under- 
stood that no questions upon these mat- 



ters will be discussed in this confer- 
ence; for this is not the place to dis- 
cuss questions of difference or of feel- 
ing that we may possess one towards 
another. Still we can manifest our 
approval or our disapproval by the up- 
lifted hand; and if there are any dis- 
approvals, we will have them heard and 
adjusted later on, but not here.

PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 

How the will of God can be known— All offices, 
callings and authority embraced in the holy 
Melchisedek Priesthood— Material affairs of the 
Church. 

If I regret anything at all, it is that 
we have not time to hear the testi- 
monies of many more of the brethren 
who are in attendance at this confer- 
ence. Nothing would delight me more 
than to have the privilege of remaining 
here and listening to a score or two of 
presidents of stakes, presidents of mis- 
sions, and other prominent men who 
are at this conference representing the 
different interests of the Church. I re- 
gret more than anything I can think 
of in connection with our conferences, 
that we do not have more time, and 
that we cannot hear from more of our 
brethren. But I think the time so far 
has been well employed, and I trust 
that all that has been said, all the 
counsel that has been given, the ex- 
hortations that have been offered and 
the admonitions that have been voiced, 
will be blessed and sanctified through 
the spirit of truth to the good and en- 
couragement of all who have heard 
them. 

The one thing now that I desire to 
impress upon the minds of my breth- 
ren of the Holy Priesthood is that we 
should live so near to the Lord, 
be so humble in our spirits, so 
tractable and pliable, under the influ- 
ence of the Holy Spirit, that we nvill 
be able to know the mind and will of 
the Father concerning us as individuals 
and as officers in the Church of Christ 
under all circumstances. And when we 
live so that we can hear and understand 
the whisperings of the still small voice 
of the Spirit of God, let us do whatso- 
ever that Spirit directs, without fear 
of the consequences. It does not make 
any difference whether it meet the 
minds of carpers or critics, or of the 
enemies of the kingdom of God, or not. 
Is it agreeable to the will of the Lord? 
Is it compatible with the spirit of the 
great latter-day work in which we are 
engaged? Is the end aimed at likely 
to advance the Church and to strength- 
en it in the earth? If its trend is in 
that direction, let us do it, no matter 
what men may say or think. 



PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 



I know, as I know that I live, that 
this is the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints. When I say this, 
I say it with a full understanding 1 of 
th e meaning of the term. It is the 
Church of Jesus Christ. It is not the 
church of man. The Lord laid the 
foundations of it. It was He who in- 
spired the boy Prophet, Joseph Smith, 
and gave to him wisdom and under- 
standing to organize the councils of the 
Priesthood and to establish His Church 
upon the foundation of prophets, apos- 
tles, evangelists, and inspired men. It 
was the Lord Jesus who restored the 
Holy Melchisedek Priesthood, through 
the instrumentality that He used; and 
all blessings, all offices, all callings, and 
all authority in this Church come un- 
der and are embraced in the holy Mel- 
chisedek Priesthood, which is after the 
order of the Son of God. There is no 
office growing out of this Priesthood 
that is or can be greater than the 
Priesthood itself. It is from the Priest- 
hood that the office derives its author- 
ity and power. No office gives authority 
to the Priesthood. No office adds to 
the power of the Priesthood. But all 
offices in the Church derive their power, 
their virtue, their authority, from the 
Pristhood. If our brethren would get 
this principle thoroughly established in 
their minds, there would be less mis- 
understanding in relation to the func- 
tions of government in the Church than 
there is. Today the question is, which 
is the greater — the High Priest or the 
Seventy, the Seventy or the High 
Priest? I tell you that neither of them 
is the greater, and neither of them Is 
the lesser. Their callings lie in dif- 
ferent directions, but they are from the 
same Priesthood. If it were necessary, 
the Seventy, holding the Melchisedek 
Priesthood, as he does, I say IF IT 
WERE NECESSARY— he could ordain 
a High Priest; and if it were neces- 
sary for a High Priest to ordain a 
Seventy, he could do that. Why? Be- 
cause both of them hold the Melchise- 
dek Priesthood. Then again, if it were 
necessary — though I do not ex- 
pect the necessity will ever arise — 
and there was no man left on earth 
holding the Melchisedek JPriesthood, 



87 

except an Elder, that Elder, by the in- 
spiration of the Spirit of God, and by 
the direction of the Almighty, could 
proceed, and should proceed, to organ- 
ize the Church of Jesus Christ in all 
its perfection, because he holds the 
Melchisedek Priesthood. But the house 
of God is a house of order, and while 
the other offices remain in the Church, 
we must observe the order of the 
Priesthood, and we must perform ordi- 
nances and ordinations strictly in ac- 
cordance with that order, as it has been 
established in the Church through the 
instrumentality of the Prophet Joseph 
Smith and his successors. 

I am aware of the fact that there 
are those who in the past have held 
different views to this. They may still 
hold different views; and if they do,, 
they will have to change them by and 
by, if they ever get a correct knowl- 
edge of the Priesthood. No office of an 
Apostle, no office of a President, no of- 
fice of a High Priest, or a Seventy, or 
an Elder, is greater than the Melchis- 
edek Priesthood. I hope you will un- 
derstand that. If an Apostle has any 
authority at all, he derives it from the 
Melchisedek Priesthood, which is after 
God's order, and he cannot have it in 
any other way. There is no authority 
except it comes from that Priesthood. 
It holds the keys of the administering 
of blessings, ordinances and promises 
upon the heads of all the members of 
the Church. Out of the Melchisedek 
Priesthood grows the Lesser Priest- 
hood, which is called the Priesthood af- 
ter the order of Aaron. This is an ap- 
pendage to the Melchisedek Priesthood. 
The office of an Elder, of a High Priest, 
of a Seventy — all the offices in the 
Church are simply appendages to the 
Melchisedek Priesthood, and grow out 
of it. You can read the revelations re- 
garding this in the Book of Doctrine 
and Covenants, and you must see it 
just as I have told it. 

Now, I think I can say. without any 
reservation, that the brethren who are 
placed in charge to look after the in- 
terests of the Church are doing their 
whole duty to the utmost of their abil- 
ity. Brother Clawson, in his discourse, 
alluded to the condition of our book* 



ss 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



and records of tithing. Never since 
the Church was organized were they 
in so perfect a condition as they are 
today. We can tell you the name of 
every man, woman and child in the 
Church who pays tithing, and we can 
tell you exactly what they pay. Not 
only so, but we have records by which 
we can show the names and the num- 
ber of the members of the Church who 
are not tithepayers. Furthermore, we 
can tell you that not one dollar of the 
tithings of the Church is used for any 
purpose except that which is legitimate 
and proper, according to the necessi- 
ties of the Church. I say to you, too, 
that we are paying the debts of the 
Church, and the tithing is being used 
carefully and exclusively at present to 
meet all current expenses and to can- 
cel our obligations, both bonded and 
note. I am happy to say to you, my 
brethren and sisters, that the people 
are doing as well in this direction, if 
not better than they have ever done 
before, with the exception, perhaps, of 
one year. There was one year wherein 
more tithing was paid than has been 
in any one year since; but we presume 
that was the result of unprecedented 
prosperity, and we are not disposed to 
measure subsequent years by that one, 
but rather to compare them year by 
year, on a consistent basis. It gives me 
pleasure to say to you that if you will 
continue to do your duty in this matter, 
it will not be long before the Church 
will owe nobody except God. So 
far as I am concerned, I have 
not cared particularly whether I shall 
live a long or short time; still I may 
say it would be pleasing to me if I 
could have the privilege of living until 
every dollar that the Church owes shall 
be paid, and a handsome surplus re- 
main in the treasury. I want to see 
that day, if the Lord is willing. But 
if He is not willing for me to live till 
that day shall come. I intend at any 
rate to carry out that purpose 
to the best of my ability, and 
to work to that end so long as I do live 
and am permitted to occupy my pres- 
ent position. Moreover, I say to you 
that I have two strong, staunch, faith- 
ful counselors to assist and encourage 



me in this endeavor — Presidents Win- 
der and Lund. I think if there is one 
of the three of us more inclined to be 
liberal than the others, perhaps it is 
Brother Lund. His generous, large soul 
sometimes expands a little farther than 
Brother Winder's or mine. We do not 
disagree about it, but we try to be 
economical and prudent, and eke out 
that which we have. We are endeavor- 
ing to assist the widow and the father- 
less, and, as far as our means will go, 
the different wards and stakes of Zion, 
in the erection of their meetinghouses. 
We are trying to do the best we can 
for the maintenance of our temples and 
for the continuance of the work that is 
going on in them. And this requires 
considerable means. According to our 
means and the obligations resting upon 
us, we are doing handsomely, I think, 
for our Church schools, of which we 
have a number and they are a credit 
to the people and to the cause of educa- 
tion. We have at last succeeded in 
completing the Deseret News building, 
•the foundations of which were laid by 
President Lorenzo Snow. We have also 
completed the Deseret News annex. 
These buildings are truly a credit to our 
city, but they have been a source of 
great expense to the Church. They are 
both costly buildings, especially the 
main one. built solidly and in the most 
expensive way, and will stand as a 
monument to the city for many years to 
come. They are now paid for, and that 
obligation is off our hands. Now we 
have undertaken to assist — not to do it 
all — in the erection of a Latter-day 
Saints hospital in this city, where the 
sick and unfortunate of our people 
may be taken in an emergency. It 
will be conducted under the auspices of 
the Latter-day Saints, and we hope to 
be able to assist in completing that 
and still go on paying our debts. But if 
anybody possessing a surplus of means 
is generous enough to voluntarily con- 
tribute towards the erection of that 
hospital, we will be glad to receive it 
from him. Others do such things, but 
we have not many rich among us, and 
therefore we do not expect so much 
from our brethren; but where men have 
abundance of means and desire to put

some of it where it will do good, if 
they will offer it freely to this hospital, 
we will accept it with our blessing, and 
with the blessing of the sick and un- 
fortunate that may be taken there in 
time to come. The blessing of all will 
be upon the generous giver. Still we 
expect to be able to go on with the 
building until it is completed — that is, 
the main part. By and by. doubtless, 
it will have to be enlarged to meet our 
necessities. Then again, we want the 
good sisters who have contributed 
means in the past for the erection of 
a woman's building in this city, for 
which a piece of land was designated, 
to understand that their efforts in this 
direction are not in vain. Inasmuch as 
you have contributed your means and 
have it in safe keeping, it will come 
in very nicely when we begin to lay 
the foundations of a memorial building 
to the name and honor of the Prophet 
Joseph Smith, and in that building the 
Relief society, the various quorums of 
the Priesthood and the general Au- 
thorities of the Church will have of- 
ficial habitation and offices. "We will 
erect a building, I hope, that will be 
creditable to the Church— not, however, 
until we pay our debts. We do not 
want to begin to incur new debts until 
the old ones are wiped out, nor then 
if we can avoid it. But when we get 
the means and are otherwise in a posi- 
tion to do it, we hope to put up a 
building on the old Deseret News cor- 
ner that will afford headquarters to 
the presidency of the Church, the 
Twelve Apostles, the presiding Bishop- 
ric, the Seven Presidents of Seventies, 
and the general and auxiliary organ- 
izations of the Church. So we do not 
want you sisters to be discouraged be- 
cause you do not see the work going 
on just at present. "We have not used 
your money; in fact, you control it, 
and it is where you have put it. It 
will be there, and perhaps bring you in 
a little interest, until we get ready 
to use it. "When that time shall 
come, we will then call upon you to 
help build yourselves and us a home. 

I feel happy in this work. I know it 
is good. I feel it in every fibre of 
my being. I am satisfied that the Lord's 



hand is over His people for good, and 
that He is lengthening the cords of 
Zion and strengthening her stakes. I 
have not been able to travel as much 
as I would like, but I have had the 
pleasure of visiting, this summer, our 
settlements in Canada, in Oregon, and 
in the Big Horn Basin; and wherever 
I have gone I have seen unmistakeable 
evidences of God's blessing and ap- 
proval upon the people. On all sides 
there are evidences of progress, of in- 
crease, of the development of the re- 
sources of the land, and of building up 
and strengthening the stakes of Zion. 
I feel in my heart that the Lord 
will continue to bless and prosper 
Zion. As an evidence that He is do- 
ing so, we see that the devil is not 
dead yet, and he won't die as long 
as the work of God is alive in the 
earth. 

The Lord bless Zion. Peace be unto 
you, my brethren and my sisters, and 
in all your habitations. The peace and 
blessing of God be upon your families, 
upon your flocks and your herds, your 
substance, and all that He has made 
you stewards over, that these things 
may be sanctified unto the Lord and 
blessed of Him to your good and con- 
tinued happiness in time and to your 
exaltation in eternity. God bless these 
faithful men who preside over the 
stakes of Zion, with their counselors 
and the members of the High Councils, 
and the Bishops and their counselors. 
God bless the presidents of Seventies, 
the Presiding Bishopric, the Twelve 
Apostles, and all those who are engaged 
in the labor of the ministry, until the 
Saints shall be brought to a knowledge 
of the truth unto the perfect stature 
of a man in Christ Jesus; that we may 
know as we are known, and not be 
tossed about by every wind of doctrine 
and by the cunning craftiness of men 
whereby they lie in wait to deceive. 
God deliver us from the snares of the 
adversary, and from the traps that are 
set for our feet and the pits that are 
dug for our destruction, and make us 
to prosper in the land now and forever, 
is my prayer in the name of Jesus. 
Amen.

cers of the Deseret Sunday School Un- 
ion, who were unanimously sustained,

said: It is very gratifying to 
see so many present here to- 
night and I trust that we shall 
enjoy God's blessings, and that this 
may be an occasion which we shall 
long remember. You may have no- 
ticed in the presentation of the author- 
ities, that there was one change. Since 
our last meeting, Elder Thomas C. 
Griggs has been called from our midst. 
For years he has acted as the business 
manager of our Union, and has been a 
most efficient laborer, and we greatly 
miss him today. Elder Griggs has for 
many years been devoted to the Sun- 
day school cause. He has likewise been 
fond of music, and shown marked abil- 
ity in composing tunes for some of our 
favorite hymns. But God, in His infinite 
wisdom, has seen fit to call him from 
us, and] so you find a change tonight — 
Brother 1 William A. Morton having 
been called to act in his place, as our 
business manager. 
I am very pleased to report that there 



92 



DESERET SUNDAY SCHOOL, UNION. 



has been a marked improvement in our 
Sunday school work during the past 
year. It has been one of some inno- 
vation. We have prepared a course of 
"Outlines," covering sixteen years, con- 
taining a sufficient amount ofl study to 
give our young people a liberal theolo- 
gical education, if they but have the 
ambition and the pride to learn the les- 
sons every week as they come along. 
These lessons are so arranged as to 
give a testimony to our young people, 
to implant in their hearts a love for the 
scriptures to attach to their minds the 
importance of a knowledge of Holy 
Writ; and we are anxious that these 
"Outlines" should be adhered to; for 
no one can tonight say what great ben- 
efit they may be to our young people. 
They are unon trial, and so far as we 
can learn, they are received with sat- 
isfaction, and with assurances of good, 
by practically all the workers in the 
Sunday school course. Along with these 
"Outlines" there are given from time 
to time such instructions as are intend- 
ed to help the Sunday School workers 
in the discharge of their duties. We are 
not only anxious that our young peo- 
ple should know the Scriptures, but 
also that they should put them into 
practice. We are anxious that they 
should observe the word of God. We 
are anxious that testimonies concern- 
ing the Gospel should be implanted in 
their hearts at an early period of their 
lives. God has made no distinction as 
to when a testimony of the truth may 
be received. A testimony may be as 
true and as beautiful in the life of a 
child as it is in matured persons. There 
may not be the experience in youth that 
there is in maturer years, but there 
may be a purity and a devotion and 
a fidelity in the hearts of the children 
that will cause the Holy Ghost to abide 
in them and make "Mormonism," or 
the work of God in this dispensation 
a permanent truth in their lives; and it 
is beautiful when young men and wo- 
men can testify in all truth that they 
never knew a time in their lives that 
"Mormonism" was not to them a living 
truth. It is beautiful when their lives 
conform to every principle of the Gos- 
pel. Thousands of our young people 



today are growing up without any 
knowledge or experience, in those 
things forbidden of God, never know- 
ing the taste of tea or coffee, of tobac- 
co or spirituous drinks. Their bodies 
are strong, their minds are pure, and 
they love the work, and there is a 
growing interest in it among them. We 
are enlisting many young men and wo- 
men who heretofore have not taken 
much interest in this work. We are in- 
teresting men of ability, young men of 
energy. They a re devoting their time 
and their talents to this work. There is 
one thing, however, to which I desire 
to call your attention. There is a grow- 
ing disposition among some of the Lat- 
ter-day Saints to leave the relig- 
ious training of their children 
to the various auxiliary or- 
ganizations of the Church, that is,\ their 
children are to be taught in the Sund a y 
schools, in the Mutual Improvement 
associations, the Religion classes, etc., 
and they feel that these or- 
ganizations are doing practically 
all that is necessary for them; 
I fear that in proportion to the ex- 
tent to which we furnish means for 
educating our children that some of the 
parents look upon this work as some- 
thing wholly within the sphere of these 
organizations, and that, therefore, they 
are not occupying their time in bearing 
their testimony to their children and 
giving them such instruction as they 
need from their parents. I desire to 
say that there is something in the tes- 
timony of a father and a mother; there 
is something in the word of life and 
light to the child that gives authority 
to them when it comes from the father 
and the mother; and no organization in 
the church can supercede the authority 
of the home, the authority of the fa- 
ther and the authority of the mother. 
And as our faith is based upon the au- 
thority of the Priesthood and upon the 
authority of the home, the instructions 
that should come from us or to us 
through the Priesthood must also be 
supplemented by the instruction and 
the authority of the home. And so a 
testimony is necessary from the par- 
ents, and if they neglect it, their chil- 
dren will feel the results of that neg-

lect, and they will realize a weakness 
in consequence. We therefore ask the 
parents to sit down in the home circle 
wherever and whenever they can, and 
read the Sunday school lessons with 
their children. They are carefully pre- 
pared, the references are given, and 
the work is such that it can be taken 
up advantageously in the home, and 
studied and read with the children. If 
the parents will co-operate with us, it 
will have a wonderful effect upon the 
lives of our young people. 

This is a glorious work. It is grow- 
ing. It is becoming more sys- 
tematic, and I believe that there 
is more of the Spirit thrown into 
this work, and our young people are 
receiving the spirit of it, and praise be 
to God for the conditions of our SundP^ 
schools. "We thank Him and we tha>: 
you for the arduous labor that is de- 
voted and dedicated to the cause of the 
youth of Zion. They are the real inher- 
itance of God, and we can nowhere 
manifest our love for Him in any great- 
er way than by thus manifesting our 
love for these children that He has 
given into our charge. 

God grant that we may enjoy His 
blessings tonight, and that we may 
have, during the subsequent exercises 
of this meeting a rich outpouring of the 
Spirit of God. I know this is the work 
of God. I have known it from my in- 
fancy, and I don't remember the day 
when "Mormonism" to me was not a 
fundamental truth, and this is my 
testimony tonight. God bless you, and 
God bless our superintendent and all 
those who labor for the upbuilding of 
Zion, I ask it in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 

A quartet composed of Brothers 
Thomas Ashworth, Fred Graham, Wil- 
lard Christopherson and Willard 
Squires sang "Sweet Sabbath Eve." 

PRESIDENT ANDREW KIMBALL 

Of the St. Joseph stake, and a mem- 
ber of the general board, said: 

It is a pleasure to me, my brethren 
and sisters, to participate in these 
meetings. I desire to say, as far as 
my understanding goes, that the people 
in Arizona are following the line of 



the Sunday school work and they are 
equally progressive with those in the 
other stakes of Zion. 

I have been very much impressed tj?e 
last two or three weeks with the neces- 
sity of speaking upon the subject of 
punctuality. I believe that the parents 
can do much towards assisting the 
Sunday schools in this direction. I 
fear that we leave too much to be done 
on the Sabbath morning, and I would 
like to urge upon the mothers, that they 
do the washing of the babies on Sat- 
urday night and place their clothing in 
readiness, that the children may not 
be embarrassed on the Sunday morning 
in going to Sabbath school late. 

I have listened with a great deal of 
pleasure to the remarks that have been 
made during this conference, and am 
reminded of a circumstance in line with 
what we have heard in reference to the 
training of our children. It was my 
pleasure to assist in the territorial leg- 
islature, some three years ago, in Ari- 
zona, in securing a company of thf 
national guard to be under the aus- 
pices of our academy in Thatch- 
er, Arizona. Brother Emil Maeser, 
who has been the principal of our 
academy for some five years, and has 
done a splendid work, succeeded, 
through the training he has had here, 
in training our boys so that they stood 
ahead of all the national guards in the 
territory. During the past summer, a 
strike broke out in a mining camp, 
some 45 miles from us. There were in 
the neighborhood of 1,200 miners broke 
away from the regulations of the camp, 
and would not submit to the require- 
ments of their employers. The Legis- 
lature had passed an eight-hour law, 
the miners wanted 10 hours' pay for 
eight hours' work. The company made 
them an offer to give them nine hours' 
pay for eight hours' work, but they 
wouldn't accept that. The governor 
called out the territorial national guard, 
and our boys 'were mustered into ser- 
vice. They were green boys who had 
attended the academy; they were Sun- 
day school boys who had been trained 
at home. When one of the lieutenants 
came to my door about 3 o'clock in the 
morning and told me of a telegram he 



94 



DESERET SUNDAY SCHOOL UNION. 



had received, and asked if I would meet 
the boys on the campus about six in the 
morning', and encourage them, for it 
was their first encounter; my feelings 
were wrought upon considerably. Then 
I thought for the first time of my la- 
bors in connection with the national 
guard, which had resulted in our boys 
being mustered in. Well, I thought the 
situation over, and I asked the Lord to 
bless and protect our boys, and when I 
thought of the training they had receiv- 
ed in the Sabbath school, and in the 
academy, then the peace of the Lord 
rested upon me, and I was impressed 
to say, These boys will go in peace 
and return in safety, if they live up to 
the teachings that they have received 
at home and in these institutions. I 
asked the captain to line them up be- 
fore me at the railroad station, and I 
said: "Boys, you are going away to 
where there is much danger. If you will 
live up to the instructions you have re- 
ceived from your mothers and your 
fathers and in the institutions of the 
Church, I promise you that you shall 
go in safety and return in peace, and 
you will not be called upon to shoot 
any person, and they will not be called 
upon to do you any harm." I am pleas- 
ed to bear my testimony, that those 
boys came back full of happiness and 
joy in the testimony that they had re- 
ceived, for they said that a peace came 
over them, in the hour of their great- 
est danger, and my promise came to 
their minds. Then they said: "We will 
go and do our duty, and no harm will 
befall us." So it was; and they came 
home unmolested, and the word came 
back to us from the government offi- 
cers and officers of the regular army 
that our boys conducted themselves 
better than any other of the national 
guard, and they were so trusted that 
the officers had them go into the sa- 
loons and other places and get out reg- 
lar soldiers and bring them back to 
duty. They were blessed to go in safe- 
ty and return in peace. 

I am going to suggest to you a meth- 
od that we have pursued in our little 
stake. We are of small consequence 
away down there, but it may be possi- 
ble that we can suggest something that 



will be for your good. The suggestion 
is that the presidencies of the stakes 
establish one regulation time. The time 
of this entire country, I believe, is the 
mountain time. Get the same time in 
all your settlements, so that when our 
brethren come and visit the Sabbath 
schools they will not come with one time 
and you have another time to start 
your schools. We have the time alike 
all over our stake, and at the same mo- 
ment, at 10 o'clock in the morning, all 
of our Sabbath schools start up. I was 
thinking today, in the conference of our 
method, when the brethren, the presi- 
dents of stakes and others who have 
reserved seats, were coming in late, the 
large congregation waiting for them, to 
take the seats if they were not taken, 
by those for whom they were reserved. 
The way we do, is to reserve seats for 
the Priesthood, and we expect them to 
set an example to the people, and if 
they are not there "on the dot" the ush- 
ers let others have their seats. We urge 
upon the parents to send their children 
to Sunday school on time. 

God bless you, my brethren and sis- 
ters, and bless the Sunday school work- 
ers. May the peace of heaven be upon 
them, and may they reap the reward of 
their untiring efforts to save the chil- 
dren of our Father, is my prayer, in 
the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

Prof. John J. McClellan then render- 
ed on the great organ an arrangement 
of "Kind Words are Sweet Tones of 
the Heart," played on the male voice 
pipes. 

Elder Seymour B. Young recited "The 
Dream of Pilate's Wife." 

SUPT JOHN D. PETERS, 

of the Box Elder stake, said: 

Brethren and sisters, for me to say 
that I am surprised this evening is to 
express the matter very, very mildly. 

We have in the Box Elder stake 
twenty-six Sabbath schools, twelve of 
these schools are within a radius of 
about ten miles; fourteen of them 
within' a radius of seventy-five miles. 
We have a very energetic and active 
Sunday school board, whose members 
endeavor to visit all of the schools with- 
in a reasonable distance once a month.

The chief work of our board this past 
year has been to impress upon our 
teachers the necessity of preparing the 
work, in order that the "Outlines" 
(which we are very pleased with,) may 
be strictly carried out, that is, carried 
out in the true spirit of their intended 
meaning-. We have found that quite 
a number of our teachers become some- 
what bewildered, especially in the theo- 
logical "Outlines," because of the num- 
erous references that are given and we 
are endeavoring to impress upon them 
the necessity of only taking those that 
are most adapted to the capacity of the 
classes; in other words, to get the 
teachers to prepare themselves in their 
work, and not only review their classes 
but have a spirit of pre-view, if you 
will allow me to so call it, or at least to 
indicate to the students what will be 
the most important facts and truths 
in the lesson to be taken up, and there- 
by obviate the necessity of attempting 
to look up all the references. We hold, 
as a board, weekly meetings regularly, 
where we receive the rer-orts of the 
condition of our schools. We feel that 
in a weak way we are doing our duty. 

Our schools are in a fair condition. 
As far as the discipline of the schools 
is concerned, we feel very satisfied; 
more satisfied with the "Outlines" than 
we do with the actual teaching work 
in the school. We have no particular 
complaint regarding the "Outlines." We 
feel that they are the very thing to 
have, and also that it is an opportune 
time to give them to our schools. We 
are endeavoring as far as possible, to 
carry them out, and to carry out any 
instructions which the general board 
may give us. • 

We are holding, regular monthly union 
meetings. These meetings we en- 
deavor to carry out as a well regulat- 
ed Sabbath school. We divide into our 
various departments, and the mem- 
bers of the union board take charge 
of the respective classes. Their special 
work is to prepare, or at least look over 
the most important truths in the les- 
sons of the month following the day on 
which the meeting is held. We think 
that in this way we are doing some 
good. However, we find that because 



of the scattered condition of our stake, 
that it will be necessary for us to hold 
a consecutive union session, that is, a 
sort of convention, where we can meet 
in three, four or five consecutive ses- 
sions, and thereby prepare the work, 
especially the work that will come in 
the winter months. 

Brethren and sisters, we rejoice in 
the work of the Sabbath school. Though 
we are weak and in many ways fall 
short of our ideal, we feel, that God 
is blessing us. We think that we have 
a good school board, excellent superin- 
tendents and good teachers, and that 
the blessings of God are attending us. 
We desire to support and sustain the 
general board. We endeavor to uphold 
them, and we present their names to 
our Sabbath school children, as also 
those of the authorities of the Church, 
in order that they may know who are 
the leaders for them to follow. 

May God bless you. my brethren and 
sisters, and bless all who are interested 
and actively engaged in Sabbath school 
work, is my desire, in the name of 
Jesus. Amen. 

SUPT. JOSEPH J. JACKSON, 
of the Alpine stake, said: 

My brethren and sisters, I can say 
that I am pleased to meet with you in 
this Sunday school conference tonight. 
If there is any meeting in the Church 
that gives me pleasure, it is Sunday 
school meeting. 

We have in Alpine stake seventeen 
Sunday schools; all of which except one 
are in good running condition, and I 
am pleased to report to this body of 
workers that the Sunday schools in the 
Alpine stake of Zion are on the im- 
prove. We have now increased the 
average attendance from 50 per cent 
at the last conference to 67 per cent; 
and we expect to increase it before our 
next conference in May to at least 75 
per cent or even 80 per cent. We feel 
that, with the direction of the presi- 
dent of the stake, we can do so; for 
I want to bear testimony here that the 
president of the Alpine stake and his 
counselors are deeply interested in the 
Sunday school work, and lately they 
have been visiting our meetings of the 
union board, and they appoint mission- 



96 



DESERET SUNDAY SCHOOL UNION. 



aries among the Sunday schools, and 
those missionaries go out, and one of 
their duties is to see whether or not 
the Sunday schools of the stake are 
carrying out the instructions that are 
given hy our general superintendent, 
and his co-laborers. 

I am pleased to state that we have 
in our stake a union board, that is not 
surpassed. I believe, in the Church. "We 
have every school represented in our 
union meetings, and the board meetings 
have been for the last few months de- 
voted, not so much to the consideration 
of what we can teach the children but 
how to teach them. We have had pre- 
sented to us by the general union board 
sufficient subject matter to teach, but 
the question now is, how we can best 
teach it; and I am pleased to state 
that we find matters easier by reason 
of that beautiful academy that was 
established by President Brigham 
Young at Provo. From there we have 
some excellent teachers. "We have 
young men and young ladies that are 
filled with the Spirit of God, 
that go there during the winter 
months, and when they come back dur- 
ing the summer months we put them 
in the Sunday school. I want to say 
that the Alpine stake board is composed 
of fifteen energetic workers. Many of 
them are young men and young women 
who have been educated in and who 
graduated from the Brigham Young 
academy. 

"We have now adopted a plan, that 
every Sunday school in the stake 
should send in a report to the board 
once a month, that we can know the 
condition of the school, that we may 
know whether or not the pupils are im- 
proving in attendance, whether or not 
they are improving in keeping the 
Word of "Wisdom. "We have had print- 
ed and we send out to the different 
schools a number of questions, and 
among these questions are: "Do you 
attend to your prayers at home?" 

My brethren and sisters, it is our ob- 
ject in the Alpine stake to place no 
teachers to instruct the children of 
God, these choice spirits who have been 
sent down here to tabernacle upon the 
earth, unless they are men of God, un- 



less they can hold up their hands in 
support of the authorities of the Church 
and of the stake. We ask them 
whether or not they are keepers of the 
Word of Wisdom; whether or not they 
are tithe payers; whether or not they 
are members of secret societies. And I 
tell you, my brethren and sisters, that 
we see the benefit of these questions. 
I can say, that our Sunday school corps 
of teachers are keeping the command- 
ments of God, and that the Sunday 
schools are being benefited thereby, and 
I believe that it is just to the children 
that it should be so. Why shouldn't 
we educate the children to keep the 
comandments of God? I ask the teacTi- 
ers if there are any under the sound of 
my voice who are breakers of the Word 
of Wisdom, whether or not they can 
stand up before their Sunday school 
class and teach them to keep it? 

My brethren and sisters, I am inter- 
ested in the Sunday school work; and 
that the work in the stake in which I 
preside, I am pleased to state, is pro- 
gressing nicely, and we hope that every 
Sunday school therein ere long can say 
that 98 per cent keep the Word of Wis- 
dom. One of the Alpine stake Sunday 
schools reported that 98 per cent were 
keepers of the Word of Wisdom. My 
brethren and sisters, I tell you when 
the time comes that 98 per cent of the 
children who attend Sunday schools are 
keepers of the Word of Wisdom, that 
President Smith will receive more aid 
from trie Church than he is receiving 
now. If they are keepers of the Word 
of Wisdom, they will pay an honest 
tithing unto God, our Eternal Father, 
the work of God will roll on, and His 
name will be glorified in the earth, and 
the hopes that are in the hearts of our 
leaders will be consummated and the 
glorious promises fulfilled. May God 
bless you, is my prayer, in the name 
of Jesus. Amen. 

FIRST ASSISTANT SUPERINTEND- 
ENT GEORGE REYNOLDS. 
I have a few items of business to pre- 
sent to this congregation. In the first 
place, 1 shall draw your attention to 
Nickel day,— the last Sunday in this 
month. The envelopes are now ready 



DESERET SUNDAY SCHOOL UNION. 



for distribution; they will be in the 
hands of the superintendents in a few 
days.- Distribute them, brethren of the 
superintendency, on the Sunday pre- 
vious to the day of collection, and col- 
lect them the next Sunday, and as 
promptly have your Sunday school 
treasurer remit the amount to the stake 
treasurer, who, I hope, will remit as 
promptly to the general board. We ask 
you to be as liberal as you can this year 
with your donation, as the Sunday 
School Union board has had to meet 
several unexpected expenses, and con- 
sequently we are heavily in debt, and 
we hope, by means of a liberal contri- 
bution on Nickel day, to set ourselves 
on our feet again. 

The offices of the Deseret Sunday 
School Union and of the Juvenile In- 
structor have been changed from the 
Templeton building to No. 46 east South 
Temple street, a new building lately 
erected, immediately west of the His- 
torian's office. We shall be pleased to 
see you. There, as before, we have 
a room, where, my brethren and sisters 
who are members and workers m the 
Sunday school cause, we invite you to 
make your headquarters when you 
come to Salt Lake, and where we shall 
be pleased to see you at any time. This 
change of our office we trust will be 
very convenient to you. 

You will also notice that by reason 
of the demise of our lamented Brother 
Thomas C. Griggs, that Elder William 
A. Morton, who has been acting as one 
of the canvassers for the Juvenile In- 
structor, is now manager of the busi- 
ness department of the Union. 

I wish to say a word or two with re- 
gard to our theological department. The 
superintendent of the Box Elder stake 
drew attention to one point upon which 
there is a little misunderstanding. 

We gave them many references, that 
they might select therefrom those pas- 
sages and references that apply most 
directly to their lesson, in the manner 
in which they were pleased to treat it; 
but it is not expected that you will 
take up all the references that are giv- 
en. Some of the brethren have so mis- 
understood, and have tried to use all 
the references given, Sunday by Sun- 



day. The numerous references are 
given that you may select those that 
best suit your purpose. 

I wish to draw your attention to the 
fact that we are publishing in the Ju- 
venile Instructor a series of articles by 
Elder Osborne WMtsoe on those por- 
tions of Jewish history that the lessons 
in the first year theological department 
now directly consider. There have 
been quite a number of complaints with 
regard to these lessons, from the fact 
that so many of our teachers are not 
well acquainted with the latter por- 
tions of the Old Testament. This will 
help them. This will make their les- 
sons much easier, and give them tl\at 
information that they do not possess, 
and which they have not books of ref- 
erence to refer to. These lessons will 
be continued in the Juvenile until all 
are considered that appertain to the 
first year's course in the theological de- 
partment. 

One item more: That is in regard to 
the percentage of preparation. We are 
getting out forms, as promised in the 
late letter of the general superintend- 
ency, which will be sent out and put in 
your hands, on which you will tabulate 
the reports that you receive with regard 
to the percentage of preparation dur- 
ing four Sundays in November. By 
these reports we hope to be enabled to 
form some idea of the percentage of 
lesson preparation throughout the 
various schools in those departments 
for which this request has been made. 

And now, before I sit down, I trust 
the example of the Alpine stake will 
stimulate you, my brethren and sisters, 
that none of you will be satisfied with 
having an average percentage of at- 
tendance of less than 75, and all of you 
will, as soon as possible, keep abreast 
of the Alpine stake and not be satis- 
fled until you have reached the high- 
est possible number. God bless you. 
Amen. 

ASSISTANT SUPERINTENDENT JO- 
SEPH M. TANNER. 

In addition to the remarks of Brother 
Reynolds, I desire to call your atten- 
tion tonight to the value of the present 
volume of the Juvenile Instructor to 



9S 



DESERET SUNDAY SCHOOL UNION. 



all Sunday school teachers, and recom- 
mend that all of you get the volume 
for this year bound, as it will be of 
great help to you in your work. 

Brother John Robinson then rendered 
a solo entitled "Stilling the Tempest." 

PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 

I think all have been delighted during 
this meeting with the remarks that 
have been made, the testimonies that 
have been borne, and the reports that 
have been given, and with the delight- 
ful music that has gratified our ears. 
I endorse all that has been said, and 
I commend it to all the Sunday School 
workers within the sound of my voice. 
I hope that we will struggle on and up- 
ward to attain the highest mark of ex- 
cellence that it is possible for us to 
attain, by diligent effort, by study and 
preparation on the part of the teachers, 
that they may be able to assist their 
pupils in their labors and studies to 
attain a higher excellence. 

I desire to commend to this congrega- 
tion the Juvenile Instructor, for I think 
I may do so without any egotism on 
my part, for it is not the little that is 
said in the Juvenile Instructor, over 
my own signature that I commend par- 
ticularly, but the articles that are writ- 
ten by our correspondents, such as 
have been named here this evening, by 
those who are cultured and who are 
studious and experienced. 

I was startled a few days ago when a 
very prominent man in one of our 
stakes began to flatter me a little, over 
something that had been published in 
the Era, in relation to card playing. 
After he had given me a little taffy, I 
said to him, "But have you read my 
articles in the Juvenile?" "Oh, no, I 
quit taking the Juvenile." "Why so?" 
"Oh, it shoots over the mark." I be- 
gan to wonder how long since he had 
been reading the "little letters" and the 
communications found in the Letter-box 
in the Juvenile. I came to the conclu- 
sion that my good brother had not 
been reading the Juvenile for some 
time past — for a long time past. I am 
afraid he quit reading it before he quit 
subscribing for it. Now I will say that 
the brethren associated with me who 
are more actively connected with the 



publication of the Juvenile, because of 
the duties that otherwise devolve upon 
me, are doing their utmost, and are ex- 
erting themselves in great wisdom to 
publish matter that will be instructive, 
interesting and profitable to all who 
read. I desire to say at this time to 
this congregation that I have felt very 
strongly of late a desire, a responsi- 
bility, I may say, resting upon me, to 
admonish the Latter-day Saints every- 
where to cease loitering away their 
precious time, to cease from all idle- 
ness. It is said in th» revelations that 
the idler in Zion shall not eat the bread 
of the laborer, and there is vastly too 
much, in some parts — not universally; 
but there is far too much precious time 
wasted by the youth of Zion, and 
perhaps by some that are older and 
more experienced and who ought to 
know better, in the foolish, vain and 
unprofitable practice of card-playing. 
"We hear of card parties here and card 
parties there, and entertainments 
where the playing of cards is the prin- 
cipal amusement; and the whole eve- 
ning is thus wasted. The whole prec- 
ious time of those that are gathered 
together on occasions of this kind, ag- 
gregating many hours, absolutely wast- 
ed. If there was nothing else to be 
said against this practice, that alone 
should be sufficient to induce Latter- 
day Saints not to indulge in this foolish 
and unprofitable pastime. 

Read good books. Learn to sing and 
to recite, and to converse upon subjects 
that will be of interest to your asso- 
ciates, and at your social gatherings, 
instead of wasting the time in senseless 
practices that lead only to mischief and 
sometimes to serious evil and wrong- 
doing, instead of doing this, seek out of 
the best books knowledge and under- 
standing. Read history. Read philos- 
ophy, if you wish. Read anything that 
is good, that will elevate the mind and 
will add to your stock of knowledge, 
that those who associate with you may 
feel an interest in your pursuit of 
knowledge and of wisdom. 

I endorse most heartily the remarks 
that were made here tonight by Brother 
Jackson. How can a man or a woman 
as a teacher in the Sunday school or as 



DESERET SUNDAY SCHOOL UNION.

one occupied in any other ecclesiastical 
duty, who is in the habit of playing 
cards, say to the children, "You must 
not do it, because it is a waste of time 
and it may result in your ruin?" Who 
can give such advice who is in the 
habit of doing it himself? Who can 
say to the drunkard, the tippler, the 
frequenter of saloons, "You must not 
tipple; you must not frequent saloons 
you should not darken the doors of 
such places," if he is in the habit of 
doing those things himself? What good 
mother can say to her daughter, "You 
must keep the word of wisdom," when 
she does not do it herself? What good 
father can say to his son, "My son 
you must not gamble, you must not 
play games of chance, you must not 
venture upon unholy ground," when 
the father himself is guilty of the same 
practices? It cannot be done, or, if 
it is done, it will be without force 
and without effect, except, perhaps, to 
brand with hypocrisy any such parent 
who gives such advice to his children 
and it breeds contempt in the minds 
of the children when the parents un- 
dertake to teach them to be better than 
they are themselves, or not to do things 
which they themselves indulge in. 

One of the essentials to a good 
Sunday school is to have good, pure- 
minded, intelligent, noble, true, and 
faithful teachers. If you will have a 
child develop to what he should be, he 
that teaches the child should be de- 
veloped to what he ought to be; and 
until he is developed in intelligence, in 
faith, in works of righteousness, in pur- 
ity of heart and mind and spirit, he is 
not in a very good position to elevate 
others to it. 

Take the Juvenile. Remember the 
Nickel fund. The Lord is blessing Zion 
It is but little that is necessary or 
needed from each when all will do their 
duty. Now regarding tithing, which 
is only a just claim upon us. If all the 
Latter-day Saints will pay an honest 
tithing of that which the Lord gives to 
them year by year, the trustee-in-trust, 
the presiding bishopric and others who 
are entrusted with the care of the 
funds of the Church, will have ample 



means to meet every requirement that 
is made of them. We shall have plenty 
to pay all the debts that were incurred 
during the persecutions of the last few 
years, and we shall have means on 
hand, instead of being behind, and we 
shall have plenty, and the earth will 
teem with plenty, and the Lord will 
open the windows of heaven and bless 
His people. Let me tell you for youf 
consolation, if it is any consolation tc 
those that are reluctant in paying their 
tithing, that the sectarian preachers of 
the world are seeking to adopt, in their 
churches, the principle of tithe paying 
as the scriptural doctrine and as the 
most consistent and proper way of 
raising funds for the maintenance of 
their church work, instead of having tc 
pass around the hat every time they 
have a meeting. Tithe paying is accord- 
ing to the law of God, and it will not 
be a great while, I will venture to say 
before almost all the sectarian church- 
es that have any tendency towards 
progress will have adopted the prin- 
ciple of tithing. And I am happy to 
say that the Latter-day Saints, through 
the revelation of this principle to the 
Prophet Joseph Smith, set this example 
to the world. It is the proper thing to 
do. 

I hope to see the time when we shall 
not have to ask you for assistance, save 
it be to pay your fast offerings and 
your free will offerings, that which you 
offer for the benefit of the poor or for 
the accomplishment of some special 
work in the ministry; that beyond that 
we shall not have to ask you for any- 
thing but your tithing, and that day 
will come, if we will only do our duty. 

Now, my brethren and sisters, let us; 
do our duty — I do not say, "Do your 
duty." I say, Let us do our duty, alL 
the time, and God will bless us. Amen.. 

PRESIDENT ANTHON H. LUND. 

I endorse with all my heart the good: 
counsel that has been given us by our 
president. I hope that we will re- 
member it. 

I have enjoyed the evening very 
much, and have listened with pleasure 
to the singing and all that has taken 
place here. When the song was sung*

DESERET SUNDAY SCHOOL UNION. 



"•Peace, be Still," it brought me back to 
a little sail which I took on the Lake 
Geneseret. I there opened my Testa- 
ment, and I read to my brethren the 
chapter where it speaks of Jesus stilling 
the storm on that same lake. I imagined 
myself back to that time, when he was 
lying in the boat asleep, and his disci- 
ples were afraid that they would be 
■swallowed by the mad waves. As we 
sailed along, I wanted to steer, but our 
Arab friends were afraid to go far from 
the shore. They said that we might 
have just such a storm any time, and 
hence they wanted to hug the shore. 
We sailed near enough to the shore to 
have the flowers, the beautiful olian- 
ders, drop into the boat. I think les- 
sons of this kind should be instilled in- 
to the hearts of the children. We want 
them to have faith. We want them, 
when passion moves them, to be able to 
■still the storm of passion, to control 
themselves, and when they are sub- 
jected to storms of persecution, we 
want them to be trained in our Sunday 
schools to have faith and to put their 
trust in our Master ,who has power 
to overrule even the storms of persecu- 
tion for our good. 

Let the Sunday schools prosper. May 
5tou, my brethren and sisters,, engaged 
in the good work, succceed in training 
the young minds entrusted to your care, 
that they may grow up and be an honor 
to their parents and to Zion. It is a 
"blessed work you are engaged in. God 
"toless you. Amen. 



ELDER JOHN HENRY SMITH. 

My brethren and sisters, I have been 
most happy in being with you here tov- 
night, and I heartily endorse every 
word that has been spoken, and trust 
the spirit that has actuated the utter- 
ances of our brethren will find lodg- 
ment in our hearts, and that each one 
of us will determine to do our part in 
every respect and to the best of our 
ability. 

May God bless your superintendents 
and teachers, and inspire them to do 
their full part in all things that pertain 
to the work of God, is my prayer in the 
name of Jesus. Amen. 



ELDER HEBER J. GRANT. 

I am very happy to be with you 
again. I rejoice in the labors that are 
being accomplished in the Sunday 
school. 

I read the Juvenile, or at least I did 
read it in Japan, with a great deal of 
pleasure. I think it is well edited, that 
every Latter-day Saint ought to read 
it. I feel that every teacher and sup- 
erintendent that does not read it is 
failing, in fact not qualifying himself 
cr herself for duty. May God help us 
to fulfill every duty, I ask it in the 
name of Jesus. Amen. 

The Tabernacle choir sang "Peace, 
Be Still," and the conference adjourned 
with the benediction of Elder George 
Teasdale.

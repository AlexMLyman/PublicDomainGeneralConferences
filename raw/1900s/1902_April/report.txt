PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 

OPENING ADDRESS. 

Righteousness increasing emorg ihe Sairts— Fur- 
poses of God will be fuiij acc( irjinhf 6- His 
kindness and mercy to the Saints— Ecci uiage- 
ment and blessings for the people. 

It is certainly gratifying to see so 
many of our brethren and sisters as- 
sembled here at the opening session of 
this the Seventy-second annual con'er- 
ence of the Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints. EverytV"' 
seems propitious for a time of rejoic- 
ing and profit in instruction and ad- 
monition and the outpouring of the 
Holy Spirit upon the servants of the 
Lord who may speak and upon those 
who shall assemble to hear from day to 
day. The weather is delightful, and I 
believe that the spirit of the people is 
good, and that there is an earnest de- 
sire in the hearts of the La ter-day 
Saints to promote all the interests of 
the kingdom of God in the earth and

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



the welfare of the Saints of the Most 
High. 

I believe that the desire in the 
hearts of the people to serve the Lord 
and to work righteousness in the earth 
is steadily — although it may be slowly, 
yet steadily and surely — increasing; 
and I do believe with all my heart that 
this desire will be more and more ear- 
nest and more and more pronounced 
in the hearts of the people of God from 
time to time and from year to year, 
as we grow in grace and in the know- 
ledge of the truth, until the coming of 
the Son of Man. 

The kingdom of God is here to grow, 
to spread abroad, to take root in the 
earth, and to abide where the Lord 
has planted it by His own power and 
by His own word, in the earth, never 
more to be destroyed or to cease, but 
to continue until the purposes of the 
Almighty shall be accomplished, every 
whit that has been spoken of by the 
mouths of the holy prophets since the 
world began. 

' I rejoice exceedingly in the truth. 
I thank God every day of my life for 
His mercy and kindness, and loving 
care and protection that has been ex- 
tended to all His people, and for the 
many manifestations of His peculiar 
mercy and blessing that have been ex- 
tended unto us throughout all the 
length and breadth of the land and 
through all the years since the organ- 
ization of the Church, on the 6th of 
April, 1830. 

The Lord, about that time or 
soon after, decreed a decree which 
He said His people shou'd realizes 
That they should begin from that very 
hour to prevail over all thsir enemies, 
and, inasmuch as they continued to 
be faithful in keeping His laws which 
He had given unto them, it was de- 
creed that tfiey should prevail until 
all enemies were subdued — not subdued 
by violence or the spirit of contention 
or of warfare but subdued by the pow- 
or of eternal truth, by the majesty and 
power of Almighty God — and by the 
increased power of the righteous and 
of the upright covenanted people of 
God should be magnified and increased, 
until the world shall bow and acknow- 
ledge that Jesus is the Christ, and 



that there is a people preparing for 
His coming in power and glory to the 
earth again. 

We carry to the world the olive 
branch of peace. We present to the 
world the law' of God, the word of the 
Lord, the Truth, as it has been re- 
vealed in the latter day for the re- 
demption of the dead and for the sal- 
vation of the living. We bear no mal- 
ice or evil toward the children of men. 
The spirit of forgiveness pervades the 
hearts of the Saints of God, and they 
do not cherish a desire or feeling of 
revenge toward their enemies or those 
who hurt or molest them or seek to 
make them afraid; but, on the con- 
trary, the Spirit of the Lord has pos- 
session of their spirits, of their souls 
and of their thoughts, and they for- 
give all men, and they carry no mal- 
ice in their hearts toward any, no 
matter what they have done. They say, 
in their hearts, let God judge between 
us and our enemies, and as for us, we 
forgive them and we bear no malice 
toward any. 

I sincerely hope that, during this 
conference, which will necessarily be 
brief, or at least will last but three 
days, with the exception, possibly, of 
some of our Priesthood meetings that 
may be held later — I trust that this 
conference will be one signally marked 
by the presence of God's influence and 
power, and that it will be one in which 
all that assemble will rejoice and be 
exceeding glad, in which their hopes 
will be encouraged and strengthened 
their faith increased and their power 
for good enlarged, that they may go 
hence from this conference re- 
joicing more than ever in the 
truth of the Gospel, and more and more 
determined to tight the good fight 
and keep the faith and establish righ- 
teousness in the earth; that it may be 
like a well of pure and living water, 
ever springing up unto eternal life. 

God bless the people, the Saints of 
the Most High, wherever they may be, 
whether in the vales of these moun- 
tains and the regularly organized 
Stakes of Zion or in the missions in 
the earth, in our own land and abroad 
in foreign countries, and upon the isl- 
ands of the sea. May God's blessing

be poured out upon those that yield 
obedience to the truth throughout all 
the world, and may the power of truth, 
the power of testimony, and the wit- 
ness of the Holy Spirit, rest mightily 
upon His servants who are sent forth 
to preach the Gospel to the world. 

I have to say this to my brethren 
and sisters: That I believe conscien- 
tiously, from all that I know, that the 
day never has been when Zion was 
more thoroughly equipped, more 
thoroughly furnished in good works, 
when there was a better spirit or a 
more united feeling existing among the 
people of God than exists today. i 
believe that the people of the Lord 
are more prosperous today than ever 
they have been. • I believe they are 
more firmly established in the truth 
than they ever have been before. I be- 
lieve, in other words, that we are con- 
tinually growing and increasing m the 
knowledge of God and in good works, 
and in faith, power and determination 
to carry out and consummate the will 
and purpose of God in the earth. 

I want to say to the people here 
that there never has been a time, with- 
in my knowedge at least, or within 
my knowledge of the history of the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
S3ints, when the Saints paid a better 
tithing than they did during the year 
1901. I have this to say as a word of 
encouragement and congratulation to 
the people throughout all the Stakes of 
Zion. Tou have done better than you 
have ever done before, and we hope 
that you will continue to do better in 
this respect, and that you will continue 
to do better in all other respects 
throughout the year 1902, and so con- 
tinue on and on, from year to year, 
until we shall be perfect in the sphere 
in which God calls us to act, as the 
Father and the Son are perfect in their 
more exalted and glorious sphere in 
Which they act. 

May the Lord bless Zion, and may 
the Spirit of the Lord rest mightily 
upon His servants that shall address 
you during this conference, is my 
prayer in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 



ELDER JOSEPH W. M'MURRIN. 

Necessity for experienced Elders in the mission- 
field — Resp .nsibilities of the Seventy — None 
should shrink them. 

It is rather unexpected to me, my 
brethren and sisters, to be called upon 
this morning to address this great con- 
gregation; nevertheless, I esteem it a 
very great privilege and honor to have 
the opportunity of standing up in this 
general conference to bear my testi- 
mony to the truth of the glorious work 
that God our Father has established 
upon the earth in this dispensation, and 
I sincerely hope that the few moments 
I occupy I may be directed by the 
Spirit of the Lord to say something 
that will be of some advantage to those 
who are assembled here. I believe that 
the Elders of the Church of Jesus* 
Christ of Latter-day Saints feel the 
need of the inspiration of the Lord 
when they stand up to address the 
people, and that without that inspira- 
tion their words are very weak, indeed 
like unto sounding brass or a tinkling 
cymbal; yet, by the blessings of the 
Lord and the presence of His Holy 
Spirit, men who may be looked upon as 
weak are ofttimes led to say things 
that are of the utmost value. I hope 
that this Spirit may rest, not only upon 
your humble servant at this time, but 
upon all the servants of the Lord who 
shall stand up during this conference to 
teach the people the will of the Lord; 
and I believe that we have it in our 
own power, to a very great degree, to 
call down the blessings that we desire 
at the present time. We have assem- 
bled from the north and from the south, 
from the east and from the west, that 
we may worship the Lord our God; and 
if we have come together with the de- 
sire in our hearts to be blessed of our 
Father in heaven, and our prayers as- 
cend to Him that He will be mindful 
of us, we have a right to hope, from 
the promises He has made to His peo- 
ple, that He will hearken to our pray- 
ers, and that He will pour out His 
blessings upon us in rich abundance. 

I have rejoiced exceedingly in the 
few words that have been spoken to 
us by Prest. Joseph F. Smith, and I be- 
lieve that a feeling of joy has permeat-

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



ed this entire congregation, and that 
we feel, as has been expressed by the 
president, blessed of the Lord, and that 
there is a spirit of unity and determina- 
tion to keep the commandments of the 
Lord resting upon the people. This con- 
ference has opened in an exceedingly 
auspicious manner. I do not suppose 
there has ever been a conference in 
the history of the' Church when a larger 
body of the people was gathered to- 
gether at the opening session than 
there is today. 

My mind of late, brethren and sisters, 
has been led out a little in relation 
to the work that is being performed 
by the Elders of the Church as mis- 
sonaries abroad, and I feel that if I can 
have the Spirit of the Lord I would 
like to offer a few remarks upon this 
missionary labor, and upon the class 
of men that are being selected from 
time to time to bear the message of the 
Gospel to the people of the world. 

I rejoice in the opportunities that 
are given to the young men of Israel to 
go forth, clothed with the authority of 
the Holy Priesthood, and authorized 
to cry repentance to the people, to teach 
the children of men the wonderful pur- 
poses of the Almighty, and to expound 
to them the doctrines of the Gospel as 
they have been revealed anew in these 
latter times through the great Prophet, 
Joseph Smith. It is a glorious privil- 
ege that the young men of the Latter- 
day Saints enjoy, to go forth in this 
manner, to call the attention of the peo- 
ples of the world to the purposes of 
the Lord. In the missionary field they 
receive an experience that is invalua- 
ble; and we rejoice, as fathers and 
mothers and as servants and hand- 
maidens of the Lord, in seeing the 
return of young men from the mis- 
sionary field who are filled with the 
inspiration of heaven, and who have 
gained valuable testimonies concerning 
the work of the Lord while they have 
been ministering words of salvation to 
the people. Many young men go out 
from our midst who have never had 
any experience outside of the Church, 
and who have never been brought 
in contact with any of the re- 
ligious denominations of the world; 
yet when they come in contact with 
these denominations and meet profes- 



sors of religion who have been spec- 
ially educated to teach the people the 
dogmas the sects believe in, it in no 
wise lessens the faith of the Utah-born 
boys. In fact, coming in contact with 
the outside world and with the relig- 
ious ideas that prevail among men 
seems to strengthen their faith, and 
they return home a thousand times 
firmer in their knowledge of the Gos- 
pel than they were before they left 
their homes to preach to the people. 
Therefore, I do not wish any feeling to 
arise in your mind, from the remarks 
I desire to make, that I am opposed 
to the sending forth of the young men 
tvho are going from day to day to 
represent the Latter-day Saints. I 
look back twenty years to the time 
when the opportunity was given to me, 
as a bov to go out as a missionary, 
and I thank God with all the strength 
of my soul today that that opportun- 
ity came to me in the days of my boy- 
hood. I have thanked the Lord for 
twenty years that I was sent at that 
time upon my first mission — taken, as 
it were, as a brand from the burn- 
ing, and made to understand the bless- 
ings that Almighty God had showered 
upon me in being born in the midst of 
this people, and in having good and 
godly parents, who made strong im- 
pressions upon my mind favorable to 
the work of the Lord by. their upright 
lives and by their testimony concern- 
ing the truth of the Gospel. And I 
look forward with anticipations of joy 
to having sons myself, at' no d'stant 
day. abroad in the nations lifting up 
their voices in proclamation of tJie 
same truth that I was sent to pro- 
claim twenty years ago. 

Nevertheless, my brethren and sis- 
ters, I have felt, in meeting with the 
Council of the Seventy and with the 
Apostles to set apart missionaries, that 
there is a lack of men of experience 
going abroad to represent the Latter- 
day Saints. I believe that all the mis- 
sions would be greatly strength n d if, 
when word is sent out from the Pres- 
idency of the Church that a number of 
missionaries are required, the Bifhops 
and Stake Presidency, in looking over 
the ground, would turn their attention 
occasionally to men of experience. It 
is no uncommon thing to find a com-

pany of young men going out as mis- 
sionaries who have never had any ex- 
perience in traveling — perhaps never 
been outside of the state in which 
they were born — and not one among 
them of experience who can be placed 
in charere, to watch over them, and to 
give them counsel as they journey to 
their fields of labor. And in the mis- 
sions, I know from my own experience 
in the European mission (and I sup- 
pose this condition prevails in other 
missions) that it is sometimes a dif- 
ficult matter to find a man to preside 
over a conference who has had exper- 
ience. I have the feeling that if we 
would pay a little more attention to 
the manner given of the Lord for the 
calling of missionaries there would be 
more men of experience selected to per- 
form this labor. The Lord has said, 
in the revelation concerning Priest- 
hood, section 107 of the Book of Doc- 
trine and Covenants. 

"It is the duty of the traveling High 
Council to call upon the Seventy, when 
they need assistance, to fill the several 
calls for preaching and administering 
the Gospel, instead of any others." 

If, when a call goes from the Presi- 
dency of the Church for missionaries, 
the Presidents of Stakes and Bishops 
would keep in mind this communica- 
tion from our Father in heaven, I be- 
lieve there would be more Seventies 
gathered in from the large number of 
quorums that exist than are now be- 
ing called upon missions. I believe that 
God Almighty has placed the respon- 
sibility of preaching this Gospel upon 
the shoulders of the Seventy; that it is 
their peculiar calling; that the Lord 
expects men who have received this 
appointment to be in preparation for 
the accomplishment of the labor that 
specially belongs to them; and I do not 
think that the Presidents of Stakes 
and Bishops, when required to furnish 
missionaries, should look to the young 
men only, but they should look into 
the quorums of Seventy and be anx- 
ious to fill the calls made upon 
them from time to time from the ranks 
of the Seventy to a greater extent than 
they are now being filled. 

In making these remarks I do not 
have any feeling to shift any responsi- 



bility from my own shoulders or from 
the shoulders of my brethren with 
whom I am associated in the Council of 
the Seventy, on to the shoulders of 
other men. We are anxious in relation 
to this matter. "We are traveling 
among the quorums of Seventy to a 
considerable extent, and we are teach- 
ing our brethren all the time that God 
has placed this responsibility upon 
them, and that they should try to put 
their affairs in shape that they may be 
prepared to respond. I realize that the 
great majority of the Seventies are 
men of families, who cannot lay down 
their affairs, quite so readily as the 
young men who are unmarried. It is 
much easier for the young men to go 
upon missions than it is for men of 
families. Sometimes excuses are offered, 
and men say they cannot go without 
making sacrifices. I feel to say to the 
Seventies that if they put off going up- 
on missions until they can go without 
making sacrifices, the time will never 
come when they will be prepared to re- 
spond to' missionary calls. Men who 
have received the Priesthood of a Sev- 
enty should be anxious to be in a con- 
dition to discharge the duty that God 
requires of them. They should read 
that which the Lord has given by revel- 
ation through His Prophet concerning 
the responsibility that rests upon them. 
The Lord says: 

/ 

''The Seventy are also called to 
preach the Gospel, and to be especial 
witnesses unto the Gentiles and in all 
the world. Thus differing from other 
officers of the Church in the duties of 
their calling." 

The Lord also says, in this same 
revelation : 

"The Seventy are to act in the name 
of the Lord, under the direction of the 
Twelve or the traveling High Council, 
in building up the Church and regulat- 
ing all the affairs' of the same in all 
nations — first unto the Gentiles and 
then unto the Jews." 

I feel in my whole being that men 
who are Seventies should have a desire 
in their hearts to accomplish this labor 
which God has designated as belonging 
to them. There should be no disposi- 
tion in the heart of any Seventy to roll 
off the responsibility of preaching the 
Gospel on to the shoulders of the Dea-

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



cons, or the Priests, or any others; but 
they should feel, "I am ready; God 
has called me to be a witness among 
the nations of the earth, and I desire 
to bear my fuli share of this responsi- 
bility, that I may enjoy a fulness of the 
promised blessing. The Lord has 
clothed me with the authority; He re- 
quirts the preaching of the Gospel at 
my hands, and I propose to put myself 
in a condition to be ready for these 
appointments." I believe that is the 
spirit that should actuate the brethren 
who have been called to be Seventies. 
I desire to ask the Bishops and the 
presidents of stakes to look among the 
quorums of the Seventy, and assist the 
Council of the Seventy in procuring mis- 
sionaries from them. I believe that 
the doing of this will greatly strength- 
en the hands of the mission presidents, 
and be a source of strength to all the 
missions in the world. There are thou- 
sands of men and women in the nations 
who have received the principles of the 
everlasting Gospel, who understand the 
first principles of the Gospel, and who 
are well grounded in the faith. They 
need some men of experience in their 
midst, whc can counsel them, and who 
can feed them better ofttimes than a 
young and inexperienced missionary 
can. My experience leads me to say 
that there are a great many men 
abroad who are as well or better quali- 
fied to preach the Gospel than some 
of the missionaries who are sent into 
their midst 

As I have said, I rejoice to see the 
young men being sent forth. I want my 
own sons tr go. I believe every fath- 
er and mother, who has a testimony 
of the truth of the ever- 
lasting. Gospel has the same 
desire in relation to their sons. But I 
would feel to rejoice in my heart in 
the going of my sons, if I knew that 
there were with them men of experi- 
ence and understanding, men thorough- 
ly established in the Gospel, and 
men who could take them by the 
hand and lead them and act to them 
in the place of a father. I would feel 
that they were in safer hands in the 
company of such men than if they were 
with the young men altogether. I 
therefore recommend to the brethren 
not to overlook the quorums of the 



Seventy, but to furnish more mission- 
aries from that band of men who have 
been designated of the Lord as being 
especially responsible for the preaching 
of His word. 

I bear my testimony, my brethren and 
sisters, to the truth of the work in 
which we are engaged. I know it to be 
of God. I prize the testimony that the 
Lord has given me concerning this work 
above all else in the world. I pray with 
all my heart that God will help me to 
retain that testimony, and to labor in 
the midst of the people, whether it be 
at home or abroad, as I may be directed 
by those who preside over me, so that 
I may fill up the measure of my days in 
the way that He desires. I pray that 
this blessing may be upon all the peo- 
ple, that we may be true to God, true to 
each other, true to the covenants that 
we have made with our Father in hea- 
ven in holy places, and that the accom- 
plishment of the purposes of the Al- ' 
mighty and the building up of His 
kingdom may be the desire of our 
hearts; for this will bring to us eter- 
nal life in the presence of our Father, 
the reward that God has promised to 
the faithful; and the gaining of this 
blessing should be the very strongest 
desire of which we are, or can be pos- 
sessed. God bless us and help us to be' 
true and faithful, help us to honor and 
respect the authority of the Holy 
Priesthood, help us to hold up the hands 
of the men of God who preside over us 
and to hearken to their counsels, that 
the purposes of the Almighty may be 
fully accomplished in the earth, is my 
prayer in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER GEORGE REYNOLDS. 

The growth of Zion — Development of Sunday 
School work. 

My brethren and sisters, realizing 
that I should have to speak next for a 
few moments, I have been trembling 
upon my seat, but asking myself the 
question, Why should I fear to stand 
up before my brethren and sisters? Do 
I not know that this is the Gospel of 
our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ? Yes, 
most certainly. Do I not hold a portion 
of the Holy Priesthood? Assuredly I 
do. Have I not for many years been a 
member of the Church, endeavoring to 
understand the principles of eternal life 



ELDER GEORGE REYNOLDS.

and to obtain the spirit of the Gospel? I 
answer, Yes. Why, therefore, should I, 
or why should anyone who is clothed 
with the power of the Priesthood, who 
loves God, and who is seeking to serve 
Him, fear to address a congregation of 
his brethren and sisters? There is 
something, however, in large masses of 
people which has an influence that 
causes us all to feel our own littleness, 
our own insignificance compared with 
the body of the Church. 

I feel like those who have preceded 
me, that we can truthfully say and 
truthfully sing, "Zion is growing." The 
kingdom of God is increasing in power 
upon the earth. "We see it in our growth 
numerically; we see it in the increase 
of our settlements, in the area of coun- 
try that we are covering, in the exten- 
sion of the stakes of Zion, and in the 
growth of our Church schools. We can 
see it also in the greater obedience of 
the people to the law of tithing and to 
other laws that God has revealed. All 
these things tell us that the Lord is 
with His people, and that He will fully 
accomplish all that he has declared; 
for as we know, He is abundantly able 
to take care of His people and of His 
work. 

With regard to what Elder Joseph W. 
McMurrin has been saying, I also know 
that there is a dearth of experienced 
men in the foreign ministry of the 
Church. I know it because of the re- 
quisitions that so often pass through 
my hands from the presidents of mis- 
sions, asking for more experienced men 
to be sent to them. I appreciate the 
diligence and zeal, the singleness of 
heart and purpose of our young men. 
Still, the power of the preaching of the 
Gospel would be manifestly increased 
if many of them had more experience, 
or, to put it in another form, if there 
was a greater percentage of experienced 
men associated with them in proclaim- 
ing the glorious principles of the ever- 
lasting Gospel. We know that the Lord 
is opening other gates in the midst of 
the nations, that he is prospering His 
work, that many are listening to the 
truth and that the Gospel is now being 
preached in numbers of places, cities, 
towns and regions where one or two 
years ago nothing was known concern- 



ing it. The demand from abroad is that 
more Elders be sent. It is very seldom 
—hardly ever indeed— that any presi- 
dent of a mission says he has too many 
Elders in the field. The constant cry is 
for more men, because there are more 
openings. But as far as my experience 
has gone, there appears to be no meth- 
od by which we can guage the condition 
of any particular portion of the Lord's 
work by the increase of the Elders sent 
there, because there are times of sow- 
ing and times of reaping in the mission- 
ary fields, as there are in the field of 
the agriculturist; but, as a rule, the 
more Elders the more baptism's, though 
the percentage is not always higher, 
per capita by reason of an increase of 
the number of Elders in the field. 

I rejoice with you, my brethren and 
sisters, in these things, because I love 
the cause of God. I desire to see it 
prosper, and I know I will. 

There is another field of labor in 
which I am engaged that, I am thank- 
ful to know, is growing and doing its 
part — that is, the Sunday school por- 
tion of the work of the Lord. In con- 
junction with this is the work done by 
other auxiliary organizations connected 
with the Church. We find, especially 
abroad, that additional importance and 
fresh strength has been given to the 
Sunday school work. In some places 
the first foothold obtained in the 
preaching of the Gospel has been by the 
organization of Sunday schools in the 
midst of non-members of the Church, 
and we know of schools that are flour- 
ishing and numerically strong where 
scarcely one-fifth of those who attend 
are members of the Church or children 
of members of the Church. We can 
make a favorable report in this direc- 
tion with regard to the growth of the 
work of the Lord and the increase of 
knowledge of principle amongst our 
young people. 

May God bless us, strengthen us, and 
enable us to do His will completely, 
whatsoever our calling or our duties 
may be, that we may fulfill the object 
of our creation, and do all for God's 
cause that He requires at our hands, 
is my prayer, through Jesus our Re- 
deemer. Amen.

ELDER C. D. FJELSTED. 

It was very gratifying to listen to the 
remarks of President Smith this morn- 
ing, that the work of God is growing, 
both at home and abvoad. We feel 
that it is quite an encouragement to 
us to do the will of our Father. "We 
certainly h&ve a testimony that this is 
the work of God. We have not been 
left to guess at it, or to be in doubt 
about it, but the Lord has given us a 
testimony, right from the beginning, 
that this is the work of the Lord. Op- 
position to it will never stop it; for it 
has come here to stay. The kingdom 
of God will stay here, His work will 
progress, and the blessings of God will 
rest upon His people. We will prosper 
in everything that is good, if we will 
do the will of our Heavenly Father con- 
tinually. We are thankful that we 
have a living Priesthood among us— 
a genuine Priesthood, not a bogus 
Priesthood; men that are inspired of 
God to teach us the way of life and 
salvation. When we meet together it 
is the duty of every Latter-day Saint 
to send up a prayer in silence to our 
Heavenly Father that He will inspire 
His servants, that they may be fed 
with the bread of eternal life and have 
the word of God, that we may be bless- 
ed and renew our determination to 
stand faithfully in the kingdom of God. 
For my part, I have enjoyed a great 
deal of the Spirit of God when I have 
been out preaching the Gospel in tha 
world; and I can testify to this people 
that yeur sons who are sent out to 
preach the Gospel are doing well. They 
a.r*. intelligent, and they are working 
hard, and the work of the Lord is pro- 
gressing. Those that oppose it never 
have tb- advantage of the servants of 
God. The servants of God are assisted 
by the Spirit of God, because this is 
His work, and He sustains them. 

T feel tc say, the Lord bless Israel. 
The Lord bless all His servants. May 
wo rally around them, listen to their 
counsels, and do the will of our Father 
as it is delivered to us through His 
servants from time to time, is my 
prayer for Christ's sake. Amen. 



ELDER J. G. KIMBALL. 

Special work of the Seventy — More home mission- 
ary work needed — Dangers to which our young 
people are exposed. 

I feel, my brethren and sisters, that 
life is too short and our time is too 
brief to be spent in making apologies 
or excuses, or for expressing myself 
as being surprised. I think we ought 
to educate ourselves not to be surprised 
at almost anything happening that per- 
tains to our calling in the only holy 
Melchisedek Priesthood, for we never 
know where lightning will strike We 
are not acquainted with those tuat 
will be released, or with those that 
will be sent to the nations of the 
earth; but we believe that it comes 
from God. I do know and testify that 
when a man is appointed to fill a place, 
notwithstanding the fact that he may 
not have all the qualifications, nor be 
endowed so richly as some other man 
may be, and the people may be sur- 
prised at the appointment, yet the Lord 
is able to qualify him. It it> marvel- 
ous in my sight how m«n that are 
called by divine authority increase in 
wisdom and knowledge, how they prog- 
ress, and how well they fill 'heir posi- 
tions when they have the spirit of their 
office and calling. Now, brethren, I 
know what my Priesthood and calling 
is. I am young in experience, but I 
know that I am a special witness of 
the Lord to the nations of the earth, 
under the direction of the traveling 
High Council; if I fall short in some 
directions, if I exhibit weaknesses, .1 
ask the Lord to cause that my integ- 
rity and my loyalty and patriotism to 
the Church of Jesus Christ shall never 
wane. I do not want to be afraid of 
man. I want to open my mouth and 
use the talent which the Doid has given 
me. What I say may not be in har- 
mony with some men. Those tfiit it is 
; n harmony with, there being a con- 
geniality and an affinity between us, 
I may be able to reach their hearts. 

It is difficult for the First Council of 
Seventy to talk of anything else but 
missionary work, because that is our 
special calling. I '"esirs tj call tue 
attention of the Presidents of Stakes 



ELDER JONATHAN GOLDEN KIMBALL.

and the Bishops of wards to the fact 
that 50 letters were sent out yesterday, 
under the direction oz die First Coun- 
cil of the Seventy, asking that the first 
50 quorums in the Church each furnish 
two Seventies to fill missions. I think 
we were explicit enough in teiling them 
the kind of missionaries we wanted, 
and I hope they have them. While we 
acknowledge that you cannot grind 
men over, neither can you li^ their 
heads, we have asked for men of a 
certain kind. There are se.-en presi- 
dents to every quorum of Seventy in the 
Church, and there are 142 quorums, 
numbering 9,500 Seventies; and if they 
canot find 284 missionaries out of the 
142 quorums, then I suggest that they 
sell out and let someone eLe "tin the 
business. We desire them to be care- 
ful about their morals, about their 
■spiritual, their physical, and financial 
condition. I wish we could strike out 
that word "financial;" but we cannot; 
for if Seventies are in debt, in bonuage, 
they will have to stay noii;r> and pay 
their debts. That is one of the greatest 
difficulties we have to meet in calling 
for missionaries. 

Our Brother McMurrin hj*s talked to 
you about the foreign missionary work, 
and I desire to corroborate what has 
been said. There is not an Elder that 
has ever presided o/er a mission who 
would not prefer a young man to a 
man who is old; but I want tc tell you 
that two young boys can do a lot of 
mischief in a short time, l'iiey intend 
to do right ,and they try to do right, 
and the Lord blesses these young men 
■most wonderfully; but where you put 
two of them together, they are not ac- 
quainted with the customs of the peo- 
ple, they are not experienced, and it 
takes a great deal of wisdom and cour- 
age to go among the children of men 
and have the finger of scorn pointed 
at you and be as unpopular as a "Mor- 
mon" Elder is. Educated tS we Pie, 
and breathing this mountain air for 20 
years, it takes a little training before 
you can turn the other cheek and 
treat those kipdry who spitefully use 
you. It takes a little education 
to learn how precious are the souls 
of the children of men in Hie sight 
of God. So we need some rider men 
■to put their hands on us younger 



ooys and hold us down. We are a good 
deal like Peter. I was that way. I 
would have cut more than one of their 
ears off, if there had been someone 
to stick them on again. That is the 
spirit of young men at first; but after 
awhile they moderate. You will be 
surprised how I will moderate in the 
next ten years; I will be as mild as a 
summer's morn, because 1 will com- 
mence then to look for death. But I 
expect to live a number of years yet, 
and I hope the fire won't entirely burn 
out of me. I had one of the Apostles 
tell me, "Brother Kimball, if you don't 
quit making so much noise, you will 
burn out." "Well," said I, "I want to 
burn out, and give room for somebody 
else, as I believe some men live too 
long." 

I desire to call your attention to a 
revelation, and I have tried to under- 
stand the part which I shall read: 

"Remember the worth of souls is 
great in the sight of God; 

"For,Behold, the Lord your Redeemer 
suffered death in the flesh;' wherefore 
He suffered the pain of all men, that 
all men might repent and come unto 
Him. 

"And He hath risen again from the 
dead, that He might bring all men un- 
to Him, on conditions of repentance; 

"And how great is his joy in the soul 
that repenteth. 

"Wherefore you are called to cry re- 
pentance unto this people; 

"And if it be so that you should labor 
all your days in crying repentance un- 
to this people, and bring, save it be one 
soul unto me, how great shall be your 
joy with Him in the kingdom of my 
Father? 

"And now, if your joy will be great 
with one soul that you have brought 
unto me into the kingdom of my Fa- 
ther, how great will be your joy if you 
should bring many souls unto me? 

"Behold you have My Gospel before 
you, and my rock, and my salvation!" 

Now, my brethren and sisters, I feel 
to testify. I believe fervently, after 
giving it a moment's consideration, the 
testimony that was borne by President 
Smith regarding the onward progress of 
this great work. I believe that it has 
been established upon the earth, never 
to be thrown down, nor given to another 
people. I believe with you, my brethren 
and sisters, who have a testimony, that 
your feet are planted upon the rock of 
salvation, and that you know that Jesus 
is the Christ. I believe that you will 



10 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



be saved in the kingdom of our Father. 
I believe that a greater part of you 
will be true, will be steadfast, will be 
firm, immoveable and unshaken. Tou 
are not dazzled nor bewildered by these 
allurements that are finding their way 
among this people. You have got past 
that. You no longer have on your 
shoulders young heads; you no longer 
care for society, worldly society; you 
no longer hunger after the things of the 
world. You have been able to stamp 
under your feet these appetites and 
these weaknesses that young men have 
not yet overcome. When you came into 
the world men were not so bewildered 
with the things of the world. These 
things have come with luxury and rich- 
es, and you, as has been stated, are 
becoming rich. I declare to you that 
we, the sons and daughters of those old 
pioneers, are becoming effeminate, and 
we no longer believe that we can do the 
things our father did. It would be al- 
most a crime to ask me to do the things 
my father did. I do not think I would 
do them, though I might if I were 
called upon to do so. Why, to preach the 
Gospel without purse or scrip, by some 
it is believed it cannot be done, even 
in countries where custom will permit 
of it. We are being impoverished in 
order to send our sons upon missions; 
and if you send some of these married 
men, who have kept the first command- 
ments of God, which is to multiply and 
replenish the earth— well, the Bishops 
do not want them to go, because it 
means the support of a wife and per- 
haps thirteen children, if it is in a good 
healthy country. I do not blame the 
Bishops, because it is a great responsi- 
bility; and there are mighty few men 
in the country, and less in the cities, 
that have money in the bank. I have 
interviewed some of the Seventies of 
Salt Lake City, and I have seen thirty 
men in one evening, every one of whom 
said, in substance, "If I go on a mis- 
sion, I lose my position, there is no in- 
come, and my family are helpless." 
These things have to be met, and I rea- 
lize it. I think there is a wonderful 
missionary work to be done. They 
have over 1,300 missionaries in the world 
and among them some very bright 
young men, with great faith, and they 
will do a great work, and will speak the 



languages of the earth by the inspira- 
tion of God. 

Now, after having referred to you 
older brethren, how you are fortified 
and fastened, how faithful you are to 
keep the comandments of the Lord and 
pay you?- tithing, what about your sons 
and daughters? Are they converted? 
Are they fastened? Can you handle 
them? Are there any of you Presi- 
dents; of Stakes and Bishops that feel 
about to falter and say that they are 
getting beyond your reach? We are 
doing a great missionary work at home. 
In every stake of Zion home mission- 
aries are sent out among the people 
to preach, and we preach, and we 
preach, and we preach most eloquent- 
ly. But these boys are not there. 
Possibly not twenty per cent of them 
are £t your meetings when the home 
missionaries talk. Of course, there are 
some exceptions. Now, what are you 
doing about them? We preach day- 
times, and I believe ardently that we 
sleep too much nights. I remember 
Brother Lyman saying, 'Young man, 
how old are you?" "I am over forty." 
He said, "I thought so, because you 
commence to hunt for an easy chai;- 
even now." At forty we commence to 
hunt for an easy chair; and so when 
night approaches, it seems that we par- 
ents all go to bed, that we may rest. 
I rather believe the idea that if the 
president? of Pta v es and Bishops of 
wards would appoint missionaries to 
walk the streets at night, there would 
be a marvelous work done in Zion. The 
devil does not do his dirty work in 
the daytime, when the sun shines; but 
he is getting so he does. some here un- 
der the blazing electric light. Are we 
going to watch our children? I remem- 
ber being in a far-off settlement not 
long ago, where they see few if any 
of the leading brethren, and yet they 
number over twelve hundred. They 
have a great many young people, and 
when I retired to my bed after the 
meeting I was kept awake all night 
long by the boys and girls running the 
streets of that settlement. I got up to- 
wards morning, looked at mv watch, 
and it was then 4 a. m., and they were 
still roaming the streets. While it may 
have been harmless and they may have 
been pure in their intentions, I tell you 



ELDER RULON S. WELLS.

in the name of Israel's God it is one 
of the criminal things that are going 
on in this land. The devil is breath- 
ing In the hearts of our young people, 
and the very air is stagnated in some 
of our larger cities with the spirit of 
immorality, and no greater sin can find 
its way in the hearts of our young peo- 
ple. I tell you, it is your duty and it 
is my duty to go out as missionaries; 
not to preach these things from the 
pulpit, not to talk- to our sons and 
daughters publicly, but privately, and 
" point out to them in a proper way, 
the great and abominable evil of se- 
cret sin. Some of you in your far-off 
districts are not burdened with what 
we call civilization and the things of 
tho world; but you are menaced, and 
the greatest danger that menaces you 
today is immorality, and secret sin. 
You know how we guard our mission- 
aries. The Elders yesterday pled with 
a number of missionaries till tears 
came to my eyes. Oh, brethren, avoid 
wine and women as you would the gates 
of hell. Don't allow any woman to take 
your honor. Don't allow any woman 
to take your arm. Keep them at arm's 
length; and as you expect to honor- 
ably fulfill your mission and have the 
Spirit of God burning in your hearts, 
see to it that there are no courtships, 
that there are no arrangements made 
of any kind to -enter into matrimony; 
but come home clean and pure and 
sweet before the Lord." As one mis- 
sionary said, when he returned home 
from his first mission, he was about 
to step over his mother's threshold 
and his mother said, "Hold on, my 
son, have you come back to me as 
pure and as good as when you left?" 
He was able to say, "Mother, I am 
pure, 1 am clean and sweet before the 
.Lord;" and she threw her arms open 
and took her son in her embrace. 

Brethren and sisters, are we going to 
fortify the youth of Israel and the 
daughters of Zion, that they can with- 
stand these men who seem to think it 
is their special mission and that they 
are justified in coming among our peo- 
ple and ruining our daughters and 
leading away our young men? God 
bless you. Amen. 



ELDER RULON S. WELLS. 

Every gift and endowment brings responsibility — 
The use and abuse of wealth. 

My brethren and sisters, I trust that 
I may enjoy the Spirit of the Lord 
while I shall stand before you this 
morning. I feel to rejoice in the privil- 
ege that I have in bearing my testi- 
mony before so large a congregation, 
t wish to endorse with all my heart the- 
remarks that have been made by my 
Drethren who have preceded me. 1 re- 
joice in the progress that has been 
made in the work of the Lord, in the 
growth of Zion, and in the extending 
of her borders. I rejoice in the ad- 
vancement that is being made oy the 
people of God. 

While the brethren were speaking 
this morning upon the responsibility 
of the Seventies in being the special 
witnesses of our Lord in the nations 
of the earth, I thought what a great 
thing it would be if ail the people, und. 
particularly all those who 'hold the 
Priesthood, would only realize the re- 
sponsibility that rests upon them as 
individuals, and if each man would 
feel that he, for one, was determined 
to discharge himself of that responsi- 
bility. When a man is ordained to the 
Priesthood, it matters not to what of- 
fice, with that ordination comes a 
responsibility; and it were better for 
him that he never had received that 
ordination, unless he magnifies the 
calling whereunto he has tven called. 
If a man is blessed with wealth and 
with the good things of this woi I i, 
with that comes responsibaity; and it 
were better for him that he had re- 
mained in poverty all his days than to 
possess riches and not give a proper ac- 
count of his stewardship. Every iaan 
who has been endow-xl with a gift, 
whether it be the gift of intelligence, 
the gift of oratory, the gift of song, 
or any other gift, with that endow- 
ment comes responsibility, and he will 
be held accountable for every gift and 
talent that has been placed within his 
reach. And to whom much is given, 
from him much will be required. While 
visiting one of the wards not very 
far from Salt Lake City I heard of a 



12 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



young man who had been appointed a 
Teacher upon one of the blocks, and 
he was complaining. He said he could 
not afford to go out teaching every 
month, because every time Iia went ir 
cost him $1.50. I thought then, how 
little that man appreciated the respon- 
sibility that had been placed upon him. 
He actually begrudged $1.50 worth of 
his time in magnifying the Piiesthood 
to which he had been ordained by the 
authority of our Heavenly Father' 
There should be in every man a 'aim- 
ing desire to fulfil the obligations that 
are placed upon him. Every man 
should seek to enjoy the spirit cf his 
calling. If he be a Seventy, he 
should enjoy the missionary spirit. 
If he be a Teacher, he should 
enjoy the spirit of going out 
among the people and teaching 
them their duties, and seeing "hat 
there is no iniquity in the Church. 
Once a young man was being interro- 
gated as to his being in a posiuon to 
fulfil a foreign mission, and ho told 
the brethren who were making the 
investigation that he was in debt, and 
on that account he was" excused for 
the time being. As the young man 
went out, he made the remark, "I ge t 
out of that pretty slick. I t«:H the 
brethren I was in debt; and what is 
more, I propose to be always ir>. .Vl>t." 
I am happy to say there are only a lew 
cases of this kind, but thin, was a 
young man, holding the Friasthooc 1 cf 
a Seventy, who did not enjoy the 
spirit of his calling. I want to say 
that it were better for him, unless he 
repents of that feeling, that a millstone 
were hung around his neck and he 
were sunk to the bottom of the sea. 
Every man that has been called as a 
Seventy should enjoy the spirit o* a 
missionary. He may not tie called at 
the present time to go into the nations. 
He does not need to go and a;-k for an 
appointment in the missionary field. But 
there should be a desire in his heart to 
lift up his voice and cry repentance un- 
to this generation. If he does not have 
that feeling in his heart, he does 
not enjoy the spirit of his calling. "We 
ought not to be glad to get out of the 
opportunity of going into the world to 
proclaim the Gospel message unto those 
who know not God. 



If I were to be asked what it is that 
arouses in men and women the great- 
est amount of energy, and that causes 
all this activity that we see in the 
world, my answer would be, it is money. 
Men and women are struggling after 
the riches of this world. They will 
work from early morn until late at 
night, they will wear out their bodies, 
in trying to obtain money. Not only 
will they do that, but they will lie, 
they will cheat, they will steal, they 
will kill for money! It is the desire for 
riches that is calling out the greatest 
amount of energy from men and wo- 
men in the world today. But among 
Latter-day Saints the thing that ought 
to call out the best life forces that we 
have, the greatest amount of energy 
and activity, is to do the will of the 
Father. Once, a missionary, who was 
the son of a wealthy man, said to me, 
"Brother Wells, the Bible says that 
money is the root of all evil, but give 
me a little of the root." I talked to 
the young man for a few moments, and 
contradicted the statement. I told him 
that money was not the root of all evil, 
and that the Bible did not say it was; 
that money is a great blessing, when 
people know how to utilize it, and can 
be made the means of accomplishing 
great good. Temples can be erected 
for the worship of the Most High, 
buildings like this Tabernacle can be 
constructed, the poor can be fed, and 
suffering can be alleviated, through the 
application of money. Money itself, I 
said, was a blessing in the hands of 
those who knew how to use it. The 
Bible did not say that money was the 
root of all evil, but it did say that the 
love of money was the root of all evil. 
When men give their hearts to gold, 
and worship mammon rather than God, 
then it is that it becomes the root of 
all evil, and leads men and women 
away from the paths of truth and 
righteousness into the paths of evil. 

May the Lord bless the Latter-day 
Saints; may He fill us with an ambi- 
tion to magnify our callings and to dis- 
charge ourselves of the responsibility 
that rests upon us. If we are wealthy, 
may He put it into our hearts to do 
something for the progress of His work 
here upon the earth and for the estab- 
lishment of the kingdom of God. May 



ELDER BRIGHAM H. ROBERTS.

He fill us with the desire in our hearts 
that when we leave this sphere of ac- 
tion, we may not leave immense for- 
tunes for our families to apostatize 
over, but may He put it into the 
hearts of our well-to-do brethren and 
sisters to endow the institutions of 
Zion. May God bless us. Amen.

ELDER B. H. ROBERTS. 

Futility of opposit'on to hindpr progress of the 
the Church — Prospective gathering of the Jews 
— Expansive chara* ter of the work of God. 

My brethern and sisters, I rejoice 
this morning in being present at this 
conference, and was happy in the re- 
flection that the attendance upon the 
opening session was the largest I had 
ever witnessed. I was also happy in 
the testimony of President Smith con- 
cerning the spiritual condition of the 
Saints of God. It is indeed a glorious 
truth, when it can be said that the 
Latter-day Saints are in a better con- 
dition spiritually, morally and finan- 
cially than they have ever been in be- 
fore. I rejoiced to think that, not- 
withstanding all the efforts that have 
been made to retard the progress of 
God's work, it is larger, more prosper- 
ous, better established in the earth now 
than at any former period of its ex- 
istence. 

This afternoon, when the choir sang 
this beautiful hymn they have just 



closed, I almost regretted that the de- 
sire for brevity would not permit them 
to go on with at least one or two 
of the other verses; for this song of 
Zion seems particularly adapted to the 
present condition of the Saints and the 
spirit of this conference. Listen to two 
or three of the other verses of this . 
hymn : 

What though our rights have been as- 
sailed? 

"What though by foes we've been des- 
poiled? 

Jehovah's promise has not failed, 
Jehovah's purpose is not foiled. 

His work is moving on apace, 
And great events are rolling forth; 
The kingdom of the latter days — 
The "little stone"— must fill the earth. 

Though Satan rage, 'tis all in vain; 
The words the ancient Prophets spoke, 
Sure as the throne of God remain, 
Nor men nor devils can revoke. 

I say that I am happy in the reflec- 
tion that the work of God, notwith- 
standing all the storms of opposition it 
has met, moves on apace in the earth, 
with a force that is irresistible; and I 
cannot help but rejoice just a little — the 
brethren must excuse me if there is 
just a little worldliriess in my makeup, 
enough at least to rejoice in the failure 
of those who have assailed the work 
of God. Truly, it must be just a little 
humiliating to them when they see all 
their purposes thwarted, and every 
storm they start passes over the 
Saints only to leave them the stronger 
and the more confirmed in their faith. 
I cannot help but exult just a little at 
this condition of things. 

I rejoiced in the testimony of the 
brethren when they declared that the 
work of God was more prosperous in 
the foreign missions than it had ever 
been before, and that new doors were 
being opened for the proclamation of 
the Gospel. All these reflections made 
this forenoon a happy day to me, and I 
rejoiced in the glorious work of God 
and in the contemplation of its great- 
ness and its stability, and especially 
since I received renewed assurances 
that it would remain in the earth until 
all that has been decreed concerning it 
will be realized. 

But these reflections, brought to my 
mind by the remarks of the brethren, 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



caused me to extend my thoughts a lit- 
tle beyond the limits of their remarks, 
and I contemplated some of the move- 
ments that are taking- place outside of 
the lines of our Church membership. I 
called to mind the promise of the Lord 
that He would bring to pass His great 
purposes among all the nations of the 
earth. And while the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints is given a 
prominent part in this great drama of 
the last days, it is not the only force 
nor the only means that the Lord has 
employed to bring to pass those things 
of which His prophets in ancient times 
have testified. I desire to call your at- 
tention to a prophecy found in the Book 
of Mormon: 

"And it shall come to pass that 
the Jews which are scattered, also shall 
begin to believe in Christ; and they 
shall begin to gather in upon the face 
of the land; and as many as shall be- 
lieve in Christ shall also become a de- 
lightsome people. 

"And it shall come to pass that the 
Lord God shall commence His work 
among all nations, kindreds, tongues 
and people, to bring about the restora- 
tion of his people upon the earth." 

These are the words of the First 
Nephi. I wish to read; in connection 
with them, the words of the Lord Jesus 
Christ to the Nephites on the occasion 
of His visiting them after His resur- 
rection from the dead and departure 
from His disciples at Jerusalem. Af- 
ter portraying the blessings that would 
be granted unto the Gentiles that 
should inhabit this promised land— the 
land of America — He refers to the 
promises that have been made to the 
house of Israel, and says: 

"Verily, verily, I say unto you, all 
these things shall surely come to pass 
[namely, the gathering of Israel, and 
especially the restoration of the Jews 
to the land of Palestine], even as the 
Father hath commanded me. Then 
shall this covenant which the Father 
hath covenanted with his people, be 
fulfilled: and then shall Jerusalem be 
inhabited again with my people, and it 
shall be the land of their inheritance. 

"And, verily, I say unto you, I give 
unto you a sign, that ye may know the 
time when these things shall be about 
to take place, that I shall gather in 
from their long dispersion, my people, 
O house of Israel, and shall establish 
again among them my Zion. 

"And when these things come to pass, 
that thy seed [referring to the' seed of 
the Nephites and the Lamanites] 'shall 



begin to know these things' [namely, 
that Jesus is the Christ, and that the 
Gospel is the power of God unto salva- 
tion] 'it shall be a sign unto them, that 
they may know that the work of the 
Father hath already commenced unto 
the fulfilling of the covenant which he 
hath made unto the people who are of 
the house of Isreal.' 

"And then shall the work of the Fath- 
er commence at that day, even when 
this Gospel shall be preached among 
the remnant of this people. Verily I 
say unto you, at that day shall the 
work of the Father commence among 
all the dispersed of my people; yea, 
even the tribes which have been lost, 
which the Father hath led away out of 
Jerusalem. 

"Tea, the work shall commence 
among all the dispersed of my people, 
with the Father, to prepare the way 
whereby they may come unto me, that 
they may call on the Father in my 
name; 

"Yea, and then shall the work com- 
mence, with the Father, among all na- 
tions, in preparing the way whereby 
His people may be gathered home to 
the land of their inheritance." 

Now, I have said that I rejoiced in 
the reflections that the remarks of the 
brethren called to mind in reviewing 
the conditions of the Church of Christ; 
in its growth at home, and in the in- 
creasing opportunities for proclaiming 
the truth of God abroad. But I rejoice 
also in those events that are taking 
place among the nations, in which a 
people enlightened by the revelations 
of the Lord through this Book of Mor- 
mon may see the hand of God and re- 
ceive the assurance that the work of 
the Lord, not only within the boundary 
lines of the Church, but among all na- 
tions, is going on to its glorious con- 
summation. 

Let me call attention to just one of 
these movements. The civilized world 
was thrilled with horror some five or 
six years ago by the atrocities perpe- 
trated upon the Jews in Russia; and 
because of the oppression inflicted up- 
on them a world of sympathy was call- 
ed forth for that suffering people. Civ- 
ilization cried out against the conduct 
of their oppressors. "Various ques- 
tions were agitated concerning the 
Jews, and various movements were 
spoken of to bring to pass their deliv- 
erance out of that land. One man 
suggested that it might be a propi- 
tious time to establish the Jews in the 
ancient land of Palestine — a mere sug-

gestion from Dr. Theodore Herzl. A 
short time ago — namely, "in the month 
of December, 1901 — we were surprised 
to learn that the suggestion had been 
acted upon and the movement it inau- 
gurated had grown to such proportions 
that at a conference held in the City 
of Basle, Switzerland, there were more 
than one thousand representatives of 
the Zionist movement, which has for 
its object the colonization of the Jews 
in Jerusalem, and the re-establishment 
of the Jews as a nation; in fact, it is 
the ambiton of this organization to 
have the Jews resume the broken 
thread of their national existence. At 
this conference, at which Dr. Herzl pre- 
sided, he reported that the Su tan of 
Turkey, within whose dominions the 
land of Judea is now enclosed, was 
friendly disposed towards the coloniza- 
tion movement on the part of the Jews, 
-and regarded them as desirable colon- 
ists, and intimated very clearly, so this 
man reported, that there would be no 
serious obstacle presented to the at- 
tainment of the ambition of this organ- 
ization. So far as his government was 
concerned. Israel Zangwill, in the 
month of October, announced that out 
of several millions of dollars that would 
be necessary for the purchase of the 
land of Palestine, more than one mil- 
lion had been subscribed by three or 
four donors. At a conference of this 
same organization, held in the City of 
Chicago, at which there were repre- 
sentatives from ten states, and more 
than 2,000 people present, it was repre- 
sented that there were more than 134,- 
O00 shareholders in the colonization 
trust that proposed the settlement of 
the Jews in Palestine. I remember 
noting some few years ago, from the 
British consular reports, thhat there 
were but from 10,000 to 15,000 Jews in 
the land of Palestine; but later reports 
state that there are from 60.000 to 80,- 
000 located in the land of Judea now. 
More than 134 societies, whose chief 
aim is the accomplishment of this pur- 
pose, exist within the United States 
alone, and the movement is gaining 
impetus and growing larger, and it be- 
gins to look like a settled fact that 
Judah's face is turned toward the land 
of his fathers. 



It would be interesting, if time would 
permit, to go into further explanation 
concerning this movement; but all I 
can do upon this occasion is to thus 
briefly call your attention to it, and 
also to the fact that the promise of the 
Father to that people begins to take 
the form of fulfillment. 

The passage I first read to you in- 
cludes these words: 

"And it shall come to pass that the 
Jews which are scattered, shall also 
begin to believe in Christ; and they 
shall begin to gather in upon the face 
of the land; and as many as shall be- 
lieve in Christ shall also become a de- 
lightsome people." 

The change of sentiment that seems 
to be taking place among the Jews 
concerning Jesus of Nazareth, is in- 
deed remarkable. It is true that 
they refuse to regard Him as the Son 
of God; but if they have not yet 
brought their faith up to that high 
point, they have at least begun to hon- 
or Jesus Christ as one of the first of 
their race, and to be proud of the 
great peasant-teacher of Judea, as is 
evidenced by the expressions of many 
of their leading men. But to this 
other point in the passage under con- 
sideration: 

"And it shall come to pass that the 
Lord shall commence his work among 
all nations, kindreds, tongues and peo- 
ple, to bring about the restoration of 
his people upon he earth." 

One thing connected with the great 
latter-day work that has always had a 
wonderful influence upon my own mind 
has been the largeness of it, the great- 
ness of it. I recognize in "Mormon- 
ism" one of the great world-movements 
for the accomplishment of the mighty 
purposes of God. It is connected with 
all the other great world-movements 
that are bringing to pass the revolutions 
now going on in the earth; the uplifting 
of one nation and the putting down 
of another; the enlightened policies of 
administration of governments by 
which the liberties of the people are 
extended; the destruction of isolation 
which has hitherto separated great em- 
pires of people from the commercial 
and social contact with other nations 
are all movements which have connec-

tion with "Mormonism." The work 
of scientists and inventors resulting in 
making the earth a network of rail- 
roads and telegraph lines, and convert- 
ing the oceans, once a terror to man, 
into merely convenient highways of 
commerce, together with the etablish- 
ment of those systems of communica- 
tion which bring all parts of the 
world into immediate touch with one 
another. All these things, I repeat, 
have a relationship to "Mormonism," 
in that they are means by which phys- 
ical conditions are being brought into 
existence that will co-ordinate with 
those spiritual and moral conditions 
which "Mormonism" will yet establish, 
and will bring to pass, the realization 
of the world's hope for that reign of 
peace and righteousness called the 
millennium. 

I thought perhaps that by calling 
your attention to things outside the 
lines so far reached by the remarks of 
my brethren, might increase your 
joy and lift up your hearts in gratitude 
to the Lord for allowing us to be con- 
nected with a work so glorious, so im- 
mense; a work that reaches backward 
into the past, that fills entirely the 
present, and that will shape the destiny, 
of the human race. I thank God for 
the bigness of His work, for its suc- 
cesses at home and abroad, and for the 
indications to be seen in the revolu- 
tions going on about us that God's 
spirit is working among all people, to 
bring to pass the accomplishment of 
His great designs. 

May the Lord bless you, Amen. 

ELDER SEYMOUR B. YOUNG. 

The work of training pi ospectlve missionaries — 
How the Elders are called— Appeal for personal 
purity. 

My beloved brethren and sisters, I 
have listened today with joy and sat- 
isfaction to the remarks of my breth- 
ren, and with you I rejoice in the tes- 
timony they have given and the pleas- 
ant influence that has prompted them, 
and that especially rested upon Presi- 
dent Smith in his introductory remarks 
this forenoon. 

As has been remarked by my breth- 
ren of the Seventies, many mission- 
aries are being called and sent into 
the field. We have at the present time 



between 1,300 and 1,400 young men scat- 
tered throughout about twenty mis- 
sionary fields. While there are less at 
the present time than we have had in 
times past, we believe that as a rule 
the Elders are better equipped now 
than formrly; for they have better op- 
portunities' to school themselves and to 
gain the information that will qualify 
them tc meet the vicissitudes and the 
obligations that missionaries have to 
face in the midst of an unbelisv.'ng 
worl3. Looking to this better equip- 
ment, the Presidency of the Church 
have established missionary classes in 
most of the leading institutions of 
learning in the various Stakes of Zion. 
In Arizona there is a Latter-day 
Saints academy in the St. Joseph Stake, 
which Stake is presided over by Prest. 
Andrew Kimball, and it seems to have 
been his ambiton and determination to 
make that institution, with the aid of 
his brethren and the Latter-day Saints 
of that Stake, an institution where the 
young people can be educated and ad- 
vanced along the lines of proper edu- 
cation, thus fitting and preparing them 
for missionary labor and for the du- 
ties that will devolve upon them as 
they grow to riper years. In the Brig- 
ham Young Academy at Provo is estab- 
lished another missionary class; also 
one in the Snow academy, of South 
Sanpete Stake, and another large class 
in the Latter-day Saints University of 
the Salt Lake Stake of Zion, and still 
another in the Weber Stake Academy 
and in the Brigham Young 
College at Logan. In these mis- 
sionary classes the young men are 
taught the principles of the Gospel. 
They are also taught good manners. 
They are introduced to a system of 
study, and required to prosecute it, 
a'ong particular lines, so as to prepare 
them tor the duties of missionaries, 
and fit them to meet the people of the 
world in a proper manner and spirit. 
It is enjoined upon these missionaries, 
when they go out into the world, that 
they not only bring to bear the power 
that they may gain by having a knowl- 
edge of the Gospel and a witness of the 
Holy Spirit in regard to its truth, 
but that they shall approach people 
in a proper, gentlemanly manner, and 
never be guilty of tearing down or

pulling- to pieces other people's re- 
ligious faith. They are shown how to 
make friends with strangers, and how 
to induce people to receive them kind- 
ly, by creating a friendly feeling in the 
hearts of those whom they approach. 
About thirteen weeks ago it was pro- 
posed in this stake of Zion that there 
should be a night school for mission- 
aries established. President Paul, of 
the Latter-day Saints University, had 
an interview with the Presidency of 
the Church, and they assigned the man- 
agement of this class to the Council of 
the Seventies. Immediately the class 
was organized, and teachers were chos- 
en to give this night class instruction. 
Brother Ben Goddard was chosen as 
instructor for the first six weeks; Bish- 
op Iverson of the Second ward was 
chosen for the next six weeks; and 
those two brethren are just closing 
their labors with this night class. I 
wish to say in their behalf that they 
have manfully, earnestly and profitably 
conducted this class; they have "been 
devoted, and they have done a good 
work among the youth of this stake of 
Zion. They are worthy of great praise 
ar.d commendation for the devotion 
they have exhibited In this work. 
Brother J. M. Tanner, superintendent 
of Church schools, and a professor of 
marked abiiitv in the education of the 
youth of 7.ion. is going to take charge 
of the class fcr the next six weeks. We 
see already good results from the 
training of these brethren. 

In regard to the young Elders that 
have recently gone out on missions, I 
want to say that they, like other El- 
ders who have been called and sent into 
the missionary field, have been called 
by the voice of the Lord through the 
Prophet. Seer and Revelator of the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints. While 1 state this I agree with 
my brethren that in the future possi- 
bly some brethren of greater experience 
might be added to this corps of young 
men that are being constantly sent out. 
On the first of the month we set apart 
26 young Elders : on the second, four 
mere, ana , yesterday, 18 more, making 
48 yo:ir>y m!ss 'i-raries tnat h<. ,'e a Iran 'v 
been ordained and set apart and are 
ready to start. Some of them have al- 
ready gone, while the rest are ready to 



go into the different parts of the world. 
These are mostly young men, some of 
them quite boyish in their appearance; 
and yet they have come here at the 
call of the Presidency of the Church 
and offered a sacrifice, to devote their 
time, their lives, and all that they 
have, to the service of the Master, at 
the call of their leader. When we look 
upon these young men we feel to bless 
them. As the presiding quorum of 
Seventy have considerable of this la- 
bor to do, we rejoice exceedingly when 
t.e see the willingness with v/hi,?h 
these young men respond to the call* 
made upon them; and we contemplate 
with a great deal of satisfaction the 
advance that they have made in the 
past few months during which they 
have been students in these missionary 
classes, thus fitting and preparing 
themselves for usefulness and begin- 
ning the labor of their lives; for this 
is only the beginning. As we have been 
informed by our presiding officers, oth- 
er missions will be opened, and more 
numerous will the calls be. Therefore, 
the Seventies need to prepare them- 
selves for this great labor, by earnest 
and faithful study of the principles of 
the Gospel; and when the call 
comes to them, let the feel- 
ing be universal in the quorums 
of Seventies that there is no 
chance to shirk, no loophole for them 
to get out, and that they must respond 
to the call; for when a man is ordained 
a Seventy he becomes a "minute man," 
and the Lord and His servants expect 
that he will be ever ready, for that is 
what the term means. 

I saw a notice not long ago that 
Harvard university was calling from 
its advanced classes for volunteers to 
go to foreign lands to preach the Gos- 
pel — to be soldiers of the cross and fol- 
low the Divine Master. It was stated 
that some had answered that they were 
ready to go to any part of the world, 
but not any very great number. Then 
I asked myself the question, How are 
they going? Are they going out as 
Elders, or Priests, or Seventies, or High 
Priests? What kind of a calling do 
they get, and who calls them? I am 
not going to pass any opinion upon 
them, nor upon the call that they re- 
ceived; but I have learned of the Gos-

"GENERAL, CONFERENCE. 



pel this much, that for a man to he 
called of God by prophecy and by the 
laying on of hands and to be authorized 
to go forth to preach the Gospel, he 
must be ordained and set apart under 
the hands of an Apostle or by his direc- 
tion. This is the way that the mis- 
sionaries of the Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints are sent out. This 
is the way the servants of God have al- 
ways been sent out, in every age of 
the world. The missionaries that 
preach the Gospel of the Lord Jesus 
Christ are always sent out under a 
divine call, by direction of the Apos- 
tles, with the Lord Jesus himself at 
the head. 

Recently I read part of a column in 
the Deseret News from which paper I 
gain much valuable information in re- 
gard to things that are transpiring in 
the world; and of interest to the peo- 
ple of this Church. I noticed that a 
Prof. Hite had made a great discovery 
pertaining to the cliff dwellers along 
the Colorado river. In speaking of one 
cliff dwelling he stated that he had 
traced it along the surface of the cliff 
down near the bank of the river, and 
had measured the distance as accurate- 
ly as he could, and that one dwelling, 
he said, was more than a quarter of a 
mile in length and four stories in 
height, and the lower story was 600 
feet up a perpendicular cliff, out of 
reach, and the rocks projecting as they 
did some 100 feet out from the cliff 
overhanging the dwelling prevented 
anyone from being let down from the 
rock above to reach it. This learned 
professor gave it as his opinion that 
this structure must have been erected 
more than 12,000,000 of years ago, be- 
cause the erosion of that rock could 
not have been accomplished in less 
time than that. I want to call your 
attention to III Nephi in the Book of 
Mormon. We And there that great up- 
heavals took place on this continent 
during the crucifixion of the Savior. 
Many cities were destroyed, and great 
inland seas were formed; great fissures 
and caverns were made through solid 
rocks, and lakes and rivers drained. 
By reading an account of this great 
upheaval we may readily conclude that 
it has not taken 12,000,000 of years to 



change the face of nature sines these 
cliff dwellings were erected. The Pro- 
phet Joseph, through the inspiration 
of the Almighty, brought to ii^ht the 
Book of Mormon. By the same power 
he introduced the Gospel of the Lord 
Jesus Christ, and instituted the or- 
ganization of the quorums of the Holy 
Priesthood in the perfect form that we 
see them today. 

These young Elders go out with a 
testimony in their hearts that in 'he 
latter days the Lord has raised up a 
Prophet, who has brought life and 
light and immortality to the children 
of men. They have received a knowl- 
edge that Jesus is the Chri.it, .ttii that 
by Him and through Him mankind 
may be redeemed, through faith and 
obedience to the Gospel. The resur- 
rection of the dead is brought to light 
through the resurrection of our Re- 
deemer, and Jesus lived and died for 
the salvation of the huma.i family. 
These young Elders have this testi- 
mony, which they go out to proclaim, 
after being ordained and set apart Un- 
der the inspiration of divine .authority, 
through the Apostles of the Lord 
Jesus. Those who volunteer to go in 
response to the call made upon them, 
go forth fearlessly, trusting in the 
power that called them; reiying not 
on their own strength, but jn the 
strength of the power of God. 'We say 
to these young Elders, "When you go 
into a house where they give you en- 
tertainment, conduct yourselves as 
gentlemen; be clean and pure in your 
department and in your conversation; 
hold the honor of that house and that 
family as sacred, yea, more sacred tV an 
you do your own life, and do not per- 
mit anything to be said or done by you 
that shall bring suspicion upon you or 
shall tarnish your good name. You 
go out to represent a good people, who 
are virtuous, honest, and upright be- 
fore the Lord. Do not let your ac- 
tions tarnish that good name. Do not 
do anything that shall prevent you, 
when you return, from receiving the 
embrace of that loving mother that 
Brother Kimball mentioned this morn- 
ing; but be in that condition that when 
you look your loved ones in the face 
you can do so without your cheeks

turning with shame, or without your 
eyes quailing through a consciousness 
of misconduct." 

This is some of the instruction that 
the Elders receive prior to their de- 
parture for missionary fields. We want 
to say to our young men who are still 
students in these missionary classes,and 
to all our young men and maidens 
throughout Israel, Be ye pure and 
clean; observe the laws of perfect 
chastity in all your associations, know- 
ing and realizing that the eye of the 
Almighty Father is upon you, and 
that youi parents and the pioneers of 
this great work expect from you that 
you will conduct yourselves in a way 
that shall bring credit to this people, 
not only while you are abroad.but when 
jou are at home also. Let your con- 
duct be all that it should be, and do 
not infringe upon the rights of your fel- 
low men. Let your lives be garnished 
with purity of thought and action. The 
Jewish maidens were taught by their 
mothers, many generations before the 
coming of the Messiah, to be pure and 
clean and to keep their persons from 
everything that would bring a taint or 
a blemish upon them, for the reason 
that theii- Messiah, the king ft Judah, 
was coming to reign upon the earth, 
and He -«ould come through the loins 
of a Jewish maiden. Hence the Jew- 
ish mothers impressed upon their 
daughters the necessity of keeping 
themselves virtuous and sweet, so that 
they might be worthy of the honor of 
bringing forth the Messiah. Such was 
the lasting impression made upon the 
Jewish maidens by these teachings that 
the same purity of thought and action 
charaUi.-izes them even to this day. 
The Messiah came through a beautiful 
Jewish maiden, but they did not re- 
ceive Him; and many of them still 
look forward to His coming. As you 
were informed today, many of the Jews 
now look upon the Savior as a great 
and gcod teacher, and one worthy of 
the esteem and fellowship of the Jews; 
and in this connection I am reminded 
of a little circumstance that was called 
to my mind in witnessing a play called 
"The "Wile." In one scene there was a 
sneet'nsr of the directors of a bank at 
midnight. Their cashier had been em- 
bezzling the funds of the bank, and 



his wife came in to plead for mercy 
for him. She found, however, that she 
could not touch the hearts of the 
bankers. The president of the bank 
was a Jew, and she, seeing a picture 
of the Messiah on the wall of his study 
where they were assembled said, in 
the name of that holy being whom 
you worship, I ask for mercy." He 
said, "Madam, I do not worship that 
being." "Why, then, said she, do you 
have His picture in your house. Be- 
cause, he replied, he was a Jew, and 
the greatest Jew that ever lived, and 
why should I not have his picture in 
my house? This evidences the very 
thing thai Brother Roberts said, that 
the Jews are learning to look upon Je- 
sus, whom we worship, as the greatest 
of the Jews, as a great teacher, and 
are honoring Him as such. The time 
has not yet come for them to ac- 
knowledge Him as the Messiah of their 
nation, but it will come; and He will 
come, for He has promised that He will 
come and reign upon the earth with 
His people. It is the duty of His peo- 
ple, therefore, to prepare for His second 
coming, that they may be found ready 
to receive Him, and not be like the un- 
believing Judean nation— refuse to rec- 
ognize Him when He does come; for 
it is by the faith of the Gospel and 
the witness that we have in our hearts 
that 'vo> Know that He is the Savior of 
the world, and that He is coming to 
reign on earth with His people. May 
the Lord bless you, and fit and pre- 
pare you for His coming, is my pray- 
er, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER HTRUM M. SMITH. 

The value, a qutfement and possesfion of truth— 
Prayers that rt*e heard not always answered— 
Evidence of dfrrlne origin of the Church. 

I, too, am filled with the spirit of re- 
joicing today, in being permitted to 
gather in conference with the Latter- 
day Saints, and in listening to the tes- 
timonies of the servants of God as they 
are borne. In looking over this vast 
congregation I have felt to offer in my 
heart a prayer of thanksgiving to my 
Father in heaven that He has done so 
much for His people. Nearly all things 
that the Latter-day Saints need are 
given to them. Whenever they ask, 
their prayers are heard and answered.

GENERAL, CONFERENCE. 



Truth is what they have wanted, and 
truth is what they have, and is the link 
which welds them all so closely to- 
gether. 

It was written in Salt Lake City a 
short time ago that all religions have 
some truth, but that no religion has all 
truth, for that could only be gained 
through infinite progression. While 
that statement is true, yet the Latter- 
day Saints have the assurance and the 
knowledge that all they have is true. 
Every principle, every rite, every com- 
mand that has ever been given to the 
Saints of God in these days, from the 
time of the Prophet Joseph Smith till 
now, is true, because it came from 
God, and therefore must be true. While 
we have not all the truth, still we are 
in that line of eternal and infinite pro- 
gression which eventually will place in 
the possession of the faithful Latter- 
day Saints all the truth. The Latter- 
day Saints can have any and every 
truth that others have. I cannot have 
perhaps the same object that you have, 
but I may have a truth that you have. 
If you have the knowledge that the sun 
first makes his appearance in the east, 
I, too, may have that identical knowl- 
edge. Therefore, whenever the Latter- 
day Saints see a truth, whenever one 
is made known, no matter where or by 
whom it is possessed or found, they can 
possess it also; and they do usually ac- 
cept gladly every truth that is brought 
to light. It makes no difference to them 
whether it be Christian or pagan, or 
heathen, who under God has been per- 
mitted to show forth that truth. 

My brethren and sisters, here we are 
gathered together in a multitude. 
Thousands of us can stand up and be- 
fore all men declare that this is in- 
deed the Church of God, and that we 
have a knowledge — not a mere belief, 
but a knowledge— that once more the 
Lord has set His hand to establish a 
people of His own in the earth. Be- 
cause we know this, we have gathered 
together today to listen still further to 
the truths that God may have to trans- 
mit to His children here. The Latter- 
day Saints gather in their meeting 
houses every week and there bear testi- 
mony one to another of the goodness of 
God. They testify that they know that 
God lives, and that He indeed did con- 



descend to answer the humble prayer 
of the Prophet Joseph Smith; and they 
call attention to many of the gifts and 
blessings of God that have been made 
known to them since their connection 
with the Church. Many of them will 
tell of the healings of the sick which 
have been made manifest in their midst. 
They acknowledge the hand of God in 
the raising of their loved ones from 
disease and affliction. They say they 
know their prayers have been heard. 
And while that is one of the evidences 
of the truth of the Gospel unto us, there 
are, in my judgment, many other evi- 
dences, greater than the healing of the 
sick, that God lives and is at the head 
of this work. It is true that many 
prayers are heard and answered in be- 
half of the sick. We know that we are 
given that for which we ask. We have 
received that for which we sought. Yet 
how many parents are there who have 
prayed earnestly and long, and with all 
the power of their souls, that God 
would give them back one who was at 
the point of death, and still their pray- 
er has not been answered? How many 
children have also offered such prayers 
in behalf of parents, and yet their 
prayers have not been answered; but 
those for whom they wept and prayed 
have been taken away. Prest. 
Woodruff often used to say that he had 
passed the allotted time of man 
and was kept alive by the faith and 
prayers of the Latter-day Saints. Here 
Apostle Brigham Young comes back 
to us almost from the point of death, 
and testifies that God raised him up, 
and that he knew the prayers of the 
Latter-day Saints were ascending to 
Him in his behalf. Yet the time came, 
my brethren and sisters, when all the 
prayers of the Latter-day Saints, earn- 
est though they were, and accompanied 
by the faith of the people, did not save 
President Woodruff from death. The 
time has come when our prayers in be- 
half of many of our loved ones have not 
been answered, but those for 
whom we have prayed have been taken 
away. But, my brethren and sisters, 
because they are taken away, is that 
any sign that our prayers were not 
heard by our Father in heaven? Not in 
the least. It is but an evidence that 
God knows best, that His will is not 



ELDER HYRUM M. SMITH. 



21 



our will, and that the time had come 
when He saw it wiser not to answer 
that prayer. How often do parents have 
to deny the prayers and petitions of 
their own children. Notwithstanding 
the child desires a thing greatly, and 
can see no reason why he should not 
have it, yet in the greater wisdom of 
the parent his request is denied and 
the supposed blessing is withheld. But 
that is no evidence that the prayer was 
not considered by the parent; it is sim- 
ply an evidence that the parent knows 
best when to give and when to with- 
hold. 

The healing of the afflictions of physi- 
cal man by the power of God is one of 
the evidences of the Gospel of Jesus 
Christ; but it is a greater evidence to 
me, that there are, as has been men- 
tioned, thousands of young men, Elders 
in Israel, filled with the power and spir- 
it of the Holy Ghost, going abroad in 
the world, clothed with the Holy 
Priesthood and power of Almighty God, 
equipped with the pure and unadulter- 
ated principles of the Gospel of Jesus 
Christ, healing the nations of their 
spiritual and soul-destroying ailments 
and afflictions. These Elders go forth, 
taking the Gospel with them, and after 
they have healed men of the errors and 
falsehoods they have been traditioned 
in from their youth up they bring them 
home to Zion. Here we are, a people 
from almost every nation in the world, 
men and women of different tongues, 
different customs, different heliefs, dif- 
ferent gods; brought together, through 
this glorious panacea for the ills of all 
men, and made one in Christ Jesus, 
with one Lord, one faith, one baptism, 
knowing each other, knowing the prin- 
ciples of the Gospel as they have been 
revealed, and testifying to the truth of 
them — all by the power of the Holy 
Ghost. This is a testimony to me, 
greater indeed than the healing of the 
sick or the taking away from this life 
of any individual. Gathered together 
in the vales of the Rocky Mountains, 
in fulfillment of prophecy, are the peo- 
ple of God, and here they are estab- 
lished as an evidence that it is futile 
for the world to raise a hand against 
the Latter-day Saints to retard their 
progress or check their advancement.. 
They cannot be stopped; they must go 



on; for God is their leader. As Brother 

Roberts said he must exult a little, I 

often exult a great deal because of the 

goodness of God to His people in 

thwarting the efforts of unrighteous 

men to check the progress of and to 

bring reproach and ignominy upon the 

Saints of the Most High. I rejoice in 

this, and I love to see the Church grow, 

in spite of all they can do. I love to 

see the people live near unto God, obey 

His commands, accept the leaders of 

the Church as men chosen of God, 

hearken to their counsels, and meet to- 
ff 

gether with smiling countenances. 

All of us may have a knowledge that 
this is the one and only religion in all 
the wide world of which it can be said, 
"all they have is true." Yet how glad- 
ly we would extend it to everyone else! 
How gladly we would give to others 
that which we have received, and how 
assiduously are we working for the sal- 
vation of men, as is evidenced by the 
hundreds upon hundreds of Elders sent 
forth to proclaim repentance and salva- 
tion to the world! 

Another evidence of the truth 
of the Gospel — a very strong 
one to me — is the organization of 
the Church. Look at it, my brethren 
and sisters. Men in the world have 
wondered and could not understand 
how it was that God could be omni- 
scient and omnipresent, and the teach- 
ing of this doctrine has led them into 
all kinds of error as to who and what 
God is. Now, look at the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints— a 
church composed of nearly four hun- 
dred thousand people, divided Into 
stakes and wards and missionary fields, 
presided over by men holding the holy 
Priesthood. Think of all that number 
of souls, and then bear in mind that 
the President of the Church can within 
a few hours, get in touch with the 
remotest parts of the Church, and be- 
come acquainted with almost every in- 
dividual member. His knowledge con- 
cerning any part of the Church, scat- 
tered throughout the world, becomes 
almost omniscient. All he needs to do 
is to communicate with the president 
of the stake, whom he knows, and that 
president may communicate with the 
Bishop of a ward, the Bishop may in- 
form his teachers that he desires in- 



22 



GENERAL, CONFERENCE. 



formation concerning a family or an 
individual in his ward, and the infor- 
mation is received, and transmitted 
right back to the head of the Church. 
In this way the President of the Church 
is brought in touch with all the 
Church, in all its branches, however 
remote they may be. If, then, one 
man, in a finite condition, on become 
so thoroughly acquainted with a peo- 
ple numbering four hundred thousand, 
can we not understand how easy it is 
for God, who is infinite, to receive all 
knowledge concerning all the works of 
His hands? The organization of the 
Church is as perfect as it can possibly 
be in our present state. All has been 
given us that we are capable of receiv- 
ing. And Oh! how we rejoice in it, 
my brethren and sisters, and in the 
knowledge, too, that eye hath not seen, 
nor ear heard, neither hath it entered 
into our hearts, what God has in store 
for us as we march on in that infinite 
progression and advancement. All 
things will be given to us— all power, 
all glory, all knowledge, even as our 
Father in heaven possesses it — in due 
time, as we are capable of receiving 
them. 

My brethren and sisters, ought we 
not to rejoice in the testimony of the 
truth, and ought we not to give glory 
to God? After He has done so much 
for us, ought we not to do all we can 
for Him, and for His children, all over 
the world, no matter who they are, 
where they are, or what they are? 
Should we not love our enemies, and 
be willing to do all we can for them, 
even though their hand be raised 
against us? God has done so much for 
us that if we do all we can and live 
to the age of a tree, we will never be 
able to repay Him for His goodness 
to us. 

Now, my brethren and sisters, we 
have the truth. The Prophet Joseph 
Smith said that the truth was a 
knowledge of things as they were, a 
knowledge of things as they are, and 
a knowledge of things as they are to 
come. Is not that a beautiful defini- 
tion of truth? Does it not embrace all 
truth? And indeed, according to that 
definition, have not the Latter-day 
Saints more truth than all the other 
peoples of the wide world, because they 



have a greater knowledge of the deal- 
ings of God with men in the past, of 
man's condition in the present, and of 
the destiny of mankind, than any other 
people or denomination? And how have 
we received this, my brethren and sis- 
ters? Why are we thus placed above 
others? Because we have been will- 
ing to humble ourselves and accept 
the testimonies of the truth as they 
have been brought to us by those El- 
ders who found us in the world with- 
out a knowledge of the truth. The 
Lord indeed has been merciful unto us, 
and I trust that He always will be, and 
that we will ever be worthy of the 
trust which God has reposed in us; 
that we may stand on the foundation 
of the principles of the Gospel as they 
have been made known to us and as 
they may yet be made known, and 
never deviate, never sacrifice a princi- 
ple, no matter what consideration may 
be brought to bear upon us to do so. 
Stand firmly upon the foundation 
of the truth, you Latter-day 
Saints. Seek for more truth; put 
yourselves in a position to receive 
more truth; and God stands will- 
ing and anxious to still pour out 
upon us a knowledge of greater truths 
than we at present can conceive of. 
Let us make the truth known to others. 
All that the Lord has given^and ' He : 
has given freely— let us be willing to ' 
give to others. Let us seek for the 
salvation of the souls of men. And 
while we are working in the world for 
the salvation of those who are yet in 
unbelief, let us work also for the salva- 
tion of the souls of our children, and 
bring them up to maturity in the fear 
and admonition and knowledge of the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ. 

May God bless us; may we still pros- 
per; may we still be blessed, and may 
we never, because of the goodness of 
God and the blessings He has bestowed 
upon us freely, imagine in our souls 
that we are better than the other chil- 
dren of God. We have been more fa- 
vored; we ought to be better; but nev- 
er let us exalt ourselves above others. 
Let us be humble. Let us seek the 
truth, and receive it when it is made 
known to us. Continue on in this path 
of righteousness, and then indeed can 
the powers of the adversary not pre-

vail with us. The Lord bless the Lat- 
ter-day Saints, bless His work, bless 
the children of God in all the wide 
world. May He hasten the day when 
sin and wickedness, error and corrup- 
tion shall be put down, and when adul- 
terated truth may be no more retailed 
and wholesaled to the children of men 
as true religion, by those calling them- 
selves doctors of divinity, but when all 
men may dispense the truth for the 



love of the truth and for the love of 
seeing men come unto the Lord out of 
the obscurity and darkness of error and 
unbelief, is my prayer in the name of 
Jesus Christ. Amen. 
The choir and congregation sang: 

How firm a foundation, ye Saints of the 
Lord, 

Is laid for your faith in His excellent 
word. 

Benediction by Elder Wm. T. Jack. 



SECOND DAY. 



Singing by the choir: 

All hall the glorious day, 

By prophets long foretold, 
On Zion's hill His praise proclaim, 

And shout hosanna to His name. 

Prayer was offered by Elder E. D. 
Woolley. 

The choir and congregation sang: 

For the strength of the hills we bless, 
Thee, 

Our God, our father's God. 

ELDER REED SMOOT. 

People should be fed with the bread of life — 
Prophecy fulfilled — Progressive character of 
the community — World afraM of the truth — 
High moral status of the Saints — Missionary 
work and proper training of children. 

In looking upon this multitude this 
morning I can assure you, my brethren 
and sisters, that I feel my weakness 
in standing before you; but I rely upon 
the prayers that have been offered dur- 
ing this conference in behalf of those 
who shall speak, to guide my utter- 
ances. I sense the responsibility that 
rests upon the servants of the Lord as 
teachers, to give to the people the word 
of the Lord. I indeed rejoiced yester- 
day in listening to the testimonies that 
were given of the growth of this peo- 
ple. Zion is growing, "Zion kept by pow- 
er divine." I also rejoiced in hearing the 
Prophet of the Lord speak to the peo- 
ple and say that they were increasing 
in good works, in the payment of their 
tithes, and in numerical strength, and 
that God was blessing them both tem- 
porally and spiritually. I noticed in 
the Deseret News, on Wednesday, a 
statement from the president of the 



Mexican mission that 30 members of 
the Church had come from Mexico to 
attend this conference, costing them 
something over $7,000 to make the trip; 
and I thought to myself, how important 
it was that every speaker should speak 
by the power of God, that those faith- 
ful Saints should be repaid for so great 
a financial sacrifice. It is certain every 
one of them will attend every meeting 
during this conference, because they 
came here for no other purpose than 
to be fed with the word of God. "What 
a responsibility it is upon those who 
are called upon to teach people with 
such faith in God and such devotion 
to His work, and, as I have said, I feel 
my weakness in doing so; but I shall 
claim an interest in the prayers that 
have been offered, that the spirit of 
Almighty God may be with me, so that 
1 may by the grace of God feed the peo- 
ple the bread of life. 

I also noticed in that same report 
that in far-off Mexico there were at 
least 3,000 people who had taken upon 
them the name of the Lord, who had 
bowed the knee to the God we 
worship, who had acknowledged that 
Jesus is the Christ, and who were mem- 
bers of the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints. When Prest. 
Joseph F. Smith was speaking of the 
wonderful progress of this work, it was 
brought to my mind that the prayers 
of Saints in asking that Zion's Stakes 
be strengthened and her cords length- 
ened, have been answered. Not only 
are we growing in the Rocky moun- 
tains, but we are spreading all over the 
face of the earth. While I was think- 



24 



GENERAL, CONFERENCE. 



ing of these things it called to my mind 
a revelation that was given to the 
Prophet Joseph Smith in the year 1829, 
a short time before the Church was or- 
ganized. Joseph Smith was only 23 
years old then, and I ask you today to 
see if the words that were revealed to 
the boy Prophet at that time have not 
been verified in the history of this peo- 
ple. 

"1. Now behold, a marvelous work is 
about to come forth among the children 
of men; 

"2. Therefore, O ye that embark in 
the service of God, see that ye serve 
him with all your heart, might, mind 
and strength, that ye may stand blame- 
less before God at the last day; 

"3. Therefore, if ye have desires to 
serve God, ye are called to the work, 

"4. Behold the 'field is white already 
to harvest, and lo, he that thrusteth in 
his sickle with his might, the same 
layeth up in store that he perish not, 
but bringeth salvation to his soul; 

"5. And faith, hope, charity and 
love, with an eye single to the glory of 
God, qualify him for the work. 

"6. Remember faith, virtue, knowl- 
edge, temperance, patience, brotherly 
kindness, godliness, charity, humanity, 
diligence. 

"7. Ask qnd ye shall receive, knock 
and it shall be opened unto you. 
Amen." 

Even before this revelation was giv- 
en, the world was worried over the 
statement made by this same Prophet, 
that God and His Son Jesus Christ had 
appeared unto him; and all the Chris- 
tian denominations were up ii arms 
against him as soon as he made the 
statement. They have been trying to 
block the wheels of this work ever 
since, and have stopped at nothing to 
bring about its destruction. I tell you 
God will not allow this Church to be 
overthrown or given to another people. 
If it was possible for Satan to destroy 
this work, he would have accomplished 
it in its infancy. 

When we look at the marvelous 
growth of the Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints, and read the 
prophecies of the Prophet of God who 
was chosen to open this last dispensa- 
tion, it seems to me that it leaves no 
room to doubt that the hand of God has 
been over this people from the day the 
Church was organized up to the present 
time. It is true that we have been 
tried and tempted; it is true we have 



been persecuted, and all manner of 
falsehoods have been circulated against 
us, and retailed and wholesaled the 
world over; but let me say to you, be 
faithful to the God that has watched 
over this people and to His command- 
ments, and just as sure as we have in- 
creased to what we are today, just so 
sure will the little stone that was cut 
out of the mountain without hands roll 
forth and fill the whole earth, as the 
Prophet of God foretold. The time is 
not far distant when men and women 
from among this people will be wanted 
all over the world. I want to testify 
to you today that this people, who have 
been chosen of God, will yet teach the 
world the way of life, and the only way 
to get back into the presence of God. 
The world may not believe it, and they 
may hold out against it as long as it is 
possible; but the word has been spoken 
that this people, governed by the rev- 
elations of the Almighty, shall yet be a 
light unto the world and teach them 
the way back unto eternal life. Why, 
today the world look upon us in wonder. 
It is true, they are trying in various 
ways to break down the power that 
this people is wielding in the earth; 
but I want to say to you, it cannot be 
done. As we advance and Increase in 
knowledge, they will fight it harder 
and harder; but God has said that it 
would roll on, and it will go on and on. 
Today we command the respect of the 
honest and respectable portion of all 
classes who know us. Whatever we 
undertake to do, whatever is placed 
upon us by the authorities of the 
Church, is fulfilled and accomplished. 
There is scarcely a colonization scheme 
proposed but those interested in it ask 
for the "Mormon" people to become in- 
terested in it and carry it on to suc- 
cess. Have you not noticed that wher- 
ever the Mormon people have put their 
hands to accomplish a thing, and the 
Prophet of the Lord has said it would 
be a success, no matter how hard or 
difficult it may have appeared, it has 
always been successfully accomplished. 
We are spreading abroad into all the 
adjacent States and Territories, and our 
influence is felt for good wherever we 
go. In Mexico, in Arizona, in Wyoming, 
in Idaho, in Canada, and in every 
country where the people are called to 



ELDER REED SMOOT. 



go, those interested in that section of 
country and in its development say, 
"Let the Mormon people come and 
teach us how to make a new country." 
There are always two sides to a ques- 
tion, and while you hear some people 
claiming that Mormonism is on the 
wane, there are others who look upon 
it as a menace, and a growing one 
at that. I have here a clip- 
ping taken from one of the great 
New York papers, and it states: 
"The danger of Mormonism is un- 
derrated, not overrated. When the 
public realizes that there are two Mor- 
mon Churches in Brooklyn, on? in 
Manhattan, one in Philade'phia, a 
strong and growing Mormon settlement 
on the borders of Pennsylvania, and 
New Jersey, and that the strongest ■ 
Church in a section fifty miles from 
Jersey City is Mormon, it may be un- 
derstood that the situation is menac- 
ing." 

This statement, which startled the 
women's executive committee of the 
domestic missions of the reformed 
church at its eighteenth anniversary 
in ths city, was made by Miss Elizabeth 
V. Vermilye, a member of the commit- 
tee, in an address upon Mormonism in 
the east. She said further: 

"It was predicted that in fifty years 
the Mormons would control a belt of 
^States cutting the country in two from 
northeast to southwest. The predic- 
tion has been verified in twenty years 
instead of fifty. They own land from 
the Rocky mountains to the Sierras and 
are spreading east as I have told you. 
They control four western states and 
at the present rate of progress in others 
will soon have supremacy." 

I say to you my brethren and sisters 
that as God has predicted that this 
people shall grow and increase the work 
will go on and on until every word 
that has been uttered by the Prophets 
of the Lord shall be fulfilled in every 
particular. What if we did control four 
western states? What if we controlled 
all the western states? I testify that if 
it were so there would be no man or 
woman living within the borders of 
those states but would have absolute 
liberty. No authority in this Church 
would ever take one whit from them 
of their rights. No priesthood that we 



hold would ever interfere with a man's 
citizenship. If these states were con- 
trolled by the Mormon people, they 
would be controlled in righteousness, 
honesty and honor. 

A few years ago there was a Congress 
of religions at Chicago, and every 
known religious denomination of the 
world was invited to be represented. 
The Anglo-Saxon, the Latin, and all 
other known races, the semi-civilized, 
and even the uncivilized nations were 
asked to be present by representation. 
The Latter-day Saints, desirous of pre- 
senting the truths as revealed through 
Joseph Smith the Prophet, sent a rep- 
resentative and you all know the re- 
sult, they would not receive him. I 
was impressed that the reason we were 
not allowed representation was that 
they were afraid of the light and truth 
that would be given to them from the 
representative of the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Later-day Saints. His tes- 
timony would condemn them all. One 
thing the matter with the world 
today is: They do not want the light; 
they do not want the truth; they want 
to live as they are living; but just as 
sure as the sun will rise tomorrow 
morning, just so sure will the truths 
of heaven as revealed to Joseph Smith 
condemn or save the world. It may 
be slow; truth always moves slowly, 
but it will be triumphant in the end. 
So will the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints triumph over all op- 
position. 

In this revelation we are admonished 
to remember faith. I do not believe 
that there is a people upon the face 
of the earth with more faith than the 
Latter-day Saints. Every act of their 
lives, every move that has been made 
by the Authorities of the Church, goes 
to show that they have had unbounded 
faith in God. And we will continue 
to have faith in that same God who 
directed us to this land, who has 
watched over us at all times, and will 
do so as long as we serve and honor 
Him. 

The revelation also says, remember 
virtue. My brethren and sisters, as 
far as my travels have extended — and 
they have been in a great many coun- 
tries of this world — I testify to you in 
the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, that 



26 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



there is not a people upon the earth 
that holds so sacred the law of virtus 
as do the Latter-day Saints. True, it 
was reported here yetsterday that 
some of the vices of the world were 
creeping into our midst, and as a result 
in some instances, there is a loss of 
virtue among our youth. As long as 
there is one case of this in the Church 
it is too many; but for all this I know 
there is no people on the earth who are 
as virtuous as a whole as are the Lat- 
ter-day Saints. 

The remarks that were made yester- 
day about our missionaries and the 
qualifications required for a missionary, 
I fully endorse. The other day I had 
one of the Elders, who had presided 
over a conference in a mission, tell me 
that be did not think there was much 
difference between the missionary that 
came into the field unprepared and the 
one that came prepared; for, he said, 
God mskes up to the one unprepared 
and it was but a short time until the 
one that came unprepared was just as 
fully qualified as the one that came 
prepared. I took issue with him on this, 
for I know, when I was in the mission- 
ary field, the men that came from our 
Church schools, where they had been 
taught the principles of the Gospel, 
were ready to go to work at once, while 
most of the others were not. But, 
said I, grant that what you say is true; 
I want to tell you that there is some- 
thing more than that. I said to him, 
and I say to the mothers and fathers 
here, that missionaries whose associ- 
ates are bad before going on a mission 
may go and fulfill a satisfactory mis- 
sion; and receive an honorable release, 
with the blessing of the President, but 
if they have been wayward before they 
leave, and their companions have been 
unfit for an Elder of the Church to as- 
sociate with, in almost every case as 
soon as they return they go right back 
into the same company and fall into the 
same evil habits as they had before 
they went. It is nothing but natural 
that they should do so. The result is, 
in too many cases, they are not home 
from their mission three months until 
they are in almost the same condition 
spiritually as they were before they 
went. I have thought many a time 
that if I had a son called upon a mis- 



sion who had had bad associates before 
going, I would want him on returning 
to go to some other place to live, and 
take up with new associates, get away 
from the influence of his old com- 
panions and start anew in life. I be- 
lieve that the surroundings and asso- 
ciations our young men are taken 
from have a great influence upon them 
when they return from their missions, 
and it is the cause of many of them 
falling back into the old rut. I want 
to ask the Bishops to look after the 
boys who come from missions. Per- 
haps you ask them to speak on their 
return, and never think of them again. 
Keep them in the harness; put them to 
work in the Priesthood; for if they are 
kept at work they will enjoy the spirit 
that they had while in the mission- 
ary field. Let them return and do 
nothing at all, and they soon become 
cold and lose the testimony they sacri- 
ficed so much to obtain. I felt like 
saying this much upon the missionary 
question. 

In a revelation given through the 
Prophet Joseph Smith to Sidney 
Rigdon, Parley P. Pratt and Lem- 
on Copley in the year 1831, it says: 

"But before the great day of the Lord 
shall come, Jacob shall flourish in the 
wilderness, and the Lamanites shall 
blossom as the rose. 

"Zion shall flourish upon the hills and 
rejoice upon the mountains, and shall . 
be assembled together unto the place 
which I have appointed. 

"Behold, I say unto you, go forth as 
I have commanded you — repent of all 
your sins, ask and ye shall receive, 
knock and it shall be opened unto you: 

"Behold, I will go before you and 
be your rearward; and I will be in your 
midst, and you shall not be confound- 
ed; 

"Behold, I am Jesus Christ, and I 
come quickly. Even so. Amen. 

I want to call the attention of the 
people to the fulfillment of this predic- 
tion. Has not Jacob flourished upon 
the mountain? is not Zion surrounded 
by hills? As stated in the beautiful 
hymn that was sung this morning, 

"For the strength of the hills we bless 
Thee, 

Our God our fathers God." 

I am most thankful that God my 
Father allowed me to be born in Zion, 
surrounded by the grand old hills, and 



ELDER REED SMOOT. 



under the everlasting covenant. I am 
thankful that he gave me such noble 
parents, and I hope to live so that I 
may merit the blessings that have been 
conferred upon me by my heavenly 
Father. Children are given to us, my 
brethren and sisters, as a blessing. The 
world today do not believe in having 
families, for they seem to think that 
children are a burden; but the first 
great law that God gave to man was, 
multiply and replenish the earth. 
Thank God that this people practice 
and believe in this commandment. Our 
children are a blessing to us, or they 
bring sorrow and trouble upon us. Let 
us watch and take care of them. Let 
us realize that they are placed in our 
care by the Father; that they should be 
Jewels in our crown in the world to 
come. I promise the mothers and fath- 
ers here, if they do not watch their 
children, there will be many of them 
making the same statement, wrung 
from the anguish of their souls, as one 
father made, according to last night's 
News: "My boy has been the victim 
of the baneful influence of a depraved 
moral degenerate and the evil effects 
of dime novel reading." I hope to God 
that every mother and father in Israel 
will watch carefully their sons and 
daughters. Be a little suspicious of 
them, if you can do it in a way that 
they will not realize it. Examine what 
they read; learn where they go, and 
who their associates are. There are so 
many fathers and mothers who think 
that it is some associate of their child- 
ren who is the bad one, while perhaps 
it may be their child that is the bad as- 
sociate of others. 

T ask the fathers and mothers of Israel 
to not only watch, but pray with your 
children. Make them your confidants; 
salute them with a kiss; keep them 
within your love; make them feel that 
no soul that lives has such an interest 
in them as you have; make the home 
just as happy and comfortable as pos- 
sible for them, and keep them around 
home and under home influence as 
much as you can. There is no greater 
comfort to you in this life than a 
worthy son or a pure daughter. There 
is nothing that brings more comfort to 
a father or a mother than to have duti- 
ful children; and there is nothing that 



brings more anguish and distress than 
a child that is wayward and commits 
some awful crime. 

My brethren and sisters, I feel to 
ask God's blessings upon you. I leave 
with you this day my testimony, that 
Jesus is the Christ, and that God lives. 
I know that this is the work of God. 
I know that Joseph Smith was a proph- 
et of God. I know that this work is 
destined of God to roll on and fill the 
whole earth. Do hot get discouraged, 
my brethren and sisters, no matter 
where you live. I remember going down 
to Millard Stake of Zion some six 
months ago, and the people were quite 
discouraged. Many of them felt like 
moving away and going to some new 
country. I remember praying while 
there fervently to my heavenly Father 
that He would send them rain, and they 
would be blessed with more water the 
coming year. Every man I met from 
Millard Stake for some time after I 
asked as to the conditions there, and 
the same reply came: "Dry and dusty." 
The people as a whole offered their 
supplications to our heavenly Father 
for moisture, and I believe their pray- 
ers have been answered. The very sec- 
tions that were parched most in this 
fair state of ours, today have a good 
prospect for more water and conse- 
quently better crops the coming season. 
In speaking to some of the brethren 
from Millard Stake the other morning, 
they told me that the earthquake that 
visited the southern portion of our state 
recently, had increased the streams of 
water, and the Sevier river had been 
filled as it had not been for years be- 
fore at this time of the year. Their 
little reservoir just east of Deseret, 
with all the water that reached it dur- 
ing the whole of last season was not 
filled; but this season it was filled in 
eight days, and the people have taken 
heart again. I say to you, my brethren 
and sisters, even if things look gloomy 
to you at times, do not get discouraged, 
but trust in that God who led you to 
this country. This is a promised land. 
God will bless it, and do not forget that 
he can increase the waters and make 
your lands productive. May the peace 
of God be with the people as a whole; 
may His blessings be upon the Church; 
may it grow and increase until it fills

the whole earth, as has been predicted 
by the Prophets of God, is my prayer 
in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER RUDGER CLAWSON. 

Restoration (if the Priesthood— Its powers, func- 
tions and duties— Noae exempt from Its in- 
fluence and authority. 

If President Lorenzo Snow had lived 
until April 3rd, he would have been 88 
years of age. He was a very active, 
energetic and progressive man. He 
died "in the harness," and passed into 
the spirit world; and the great work of 
the Lord moves on without let or hind- 
rance. I am sure that he would have 
been very happy to be present with 
us upon this occasion, to have listened 
to the testimonies of the brethren, nad 
gazed into the faces of this vast con- 
gregation. 

Brethren and sisters, notwithstand- 
ing the servants of the Lord fall from 
time to time battling for the truth, 
Zion must be redeemed. While sitting 
on the stand listening to the discourses 
of my brethren, I have greatly mar- 
velled at the wonderful providences of 
the Lord unto us; for when He uttered 
forth His voice and said that His 
Church must be established in the 
earth and His work must be accomp- 
lished, He furnished to the children of 
men the means to accomplish it. As 
early as the year 1823, the Lord made 
use of this language. 

"Behold I will reveal unto you the 
Priesthood, by the hand of Elijah the 
prophet, before the coming of the great 
and dreadful day of the Lord." 

A dreadful day; A day of pestilence, 
of famine, of earthquake, of tempests, 
and a day of burning, designated here 
in very impressive language as "the 
great and dreadful day of the Lord!" 
When that days comes, the power of 
the Priesthood must be upon the earth 
to protect and deliver the people of 
God from destruction; for the righte- 
ous and those who keep the command- 
ments of God, including those who are 
tithed, shall not be burned. 

The priesthood has been restored to 
the earth, and is composed of two 
grand divisions — the Melchisedek and 
the Aaronic. The Aaronic Priesthood 
was restored to the earth and bestowed 
upon Joseph Smith by the hand of 



John the Baptist, in May, 1829. The 
Melchisedek Priesthood was restored 
and conferred upon the Prophet Joseph 
in June, 1829, by Peter, James and John. 
The authority and power of the Mel- 
chisedek Priesthood is to hold the keys 
of all the spiritual blessings of the 
Church, to have the privilege of re- 
ceiving the mysteries of the kingdom, 
to have the heavens opened unto us, 
to have communion with the general 
assembly and church of the firstborn, 
and to enjoy the communion of God the 
Father and Jesus the Mediator of the 
new covenant. The power and author- 
ity of the Aaronic Priesthood is to 
hold the keys of the ministering of an- 
gels, and to administer in outward 
ordinances the letter of the gospel — 
the baptism of repentance for the re- 
mission of sins, agreeable to the cov- 
enants and commandments. Thus we 
see, brethren and sisters, that the 
Priesthood connects this Church with 
the heavens, and the channel of com- 
munication is open. Oh! how weak 
indeed would we be without this au- 
thority; and oh! how weak indeed are 
we except we honor it, for if we do not 
we come under condemnation. The 
president of the Melchisedek Priest- 
hood is a High Priest, and is designated 
in the revelations of God as a presid- 
ing High Priest over the High Priast- 
hood of the Church, and is also Presi- 
dent of the Church. His Counselors are 
High Priests; and these three con- 
stitute the Presidency of the Church, 
and have authority over all its affairs, 
to regulate them throughout the world. 
The president of the Aaronic Priest- 
hood is a Bishop, who is called to pre- 
side over the quorums of the Lesser 
Priesthood. 

Let me say to you, brethren and sis- 
ters, (I say it to the sisters as well as 
the brethren, for I feel that it is a good 
thing for the sisters to hear something 
regarding the Priesthood) there is not 
a living soul connected with the Church 
that is exempt from the authority and 
influence of the Priesthood; for the 
reason that the Priesthood holds the 
keys to all the spiritual blessings of 
the Church. It is true that the sisters 
do not receive the Priesthood, but they 
receive its blessings in connection 
with their husbands and fathers. The 



ELDER RUDGER CLAWSON.

Priesthood continues in the Church 
of God throughout all genera- 
tions, and is without beginning of days 
or end of years. We are told— and oh. 
how impessive is the thought!— that 
without the Priesthood the power of 
godliness cannot be made manifest to 
men, and without it no man can see 
the face of God and live. What a sorry 
plight the world is in, if that statement 
be true, that no man can gaze upon the 
face of God and live, without the 
Priesthood! We must needs take it to 
them; we must needs preach the Gos- 
pel to them. 

In these two great Priesthoods that 
I have mentioned are various orders or 
grades. In the Melchisedek Priesthood 
we have Apostles, High Priests, Sev- 
enties and Elders. In the Aaronic 
Priesthood we have Bishops, Priests, 
Teachers and Deacons. So that every 
age and condition in the Church is pro- 
vided for; and no man, be he young or 
old, is authorized to exercise authority 
in the Church of God, except he bears 
some portion of the Priesthood. Won- 
derful thing! A church of Priesthood! 
The duties of these several orders of 
Priesthood are well and clearly defined 
in the revelations. There need be no 
confusion, or misunderstanding. The. 
High Priest is under no necessity to 
run to the Seventy and ask what his 
duty is; the Seventy need not go to the 
High Priest to learn what he should do; 
and the members of the lesser Priest- 
hood need not be uninformed as to what 
their duties are. God has laid down 
the rules and defined the duties per- 
taining to these two Priesthoods so 
clearly and so strongly that they can- 
not be misunderstood. The Apostles 
are to officiate under the direction of 
the First Presidency, and build up the 
Church and regulate its affairs in all 
the world, agreeable to the covenants 
and commandments. The High Priests 
are standing ministers in Zion, to ad- 
minister in spiritual things, and to be 
taught, instructed, and qualified, that 
they may hold the office of President of 
Stakes, High Councilors, and other im- 
portant appointments in the Church. 
The duty of the Seventy is to act under 
the direction of the Twelve Apostles, to 
build up the Church, to regulate its af- 



fairs in all the world, first to the Gen- 
tiles, and then to the Jews. The duty of 
the Elder is to be a standing minister in 
Zion, to administer in spiritual things, 
to administer the sacrament, to baptize, 
to lay on hands for the reception of the 
Holy Ghost, to take the lead of all 
meetings when no higher authority is 
present, and to conduct them under the 
influence and power of the Holy Ghost. 
T<!o Elder or High Priest is to conduct 
meetings in this Church by any other 
spirit than the spirit of God. Heaven- 
delegated authority to man! The duty 
of the Bishop is to preside over the 
Lesser Priesthood and the quorums 
thereof. The duty of the Priest is to 
preach, teach and expound the scrip- 
tures, to baptize, to administer the 
sacrament, to visit the homes of the 
people, to pray with them vocally, and 
to teach them all family duties. The 
duty of the Teacher is to watch over the 
Church, to be with the Church con- 
stantly, and strengthen it, to see that 
iniquity doth not abound, to see that 
there is no evil-speaking, or backbiting, 
and to preach, teach, exhort, and ex- 
pound; and he is to be assisted in his 
duties by the Deacon; but the Teacher 
and the Deacon have no authority to 
baptize, or administer the sacrament. 
They do have the authority, however, 
to preach the Gospel, to show forth a 
good example, to warn the people and 
invite all to come unto Christ. There 
is no confusion in all this that I have 
told you. Every duty is well expressed 
and clearly defined in the revelations. 

I have had some thoughts relative to 
the great responsibility resting upon 
Presidents of Stakes, who are High 
Priests in the Church, called to preside 
over the Stakes of Zion. O how great— 
almost unlimited authority, you might 
say, is exercised by the Presidents of 
Stakes, presiding as they do over all 
the affairs of the Stake! Then, how 
great the authority and responsibility 
resting upon the Bishops of wards, who 
are called to preside over all the organi- 
zations and Priesthood of the ward! We 
sre sometimes told that the High 
Priests over there are not magnifying 
their Priesthood; the Seventies over 
here are not doing their duty; the El- 
ders are slack, and do not attend their 
quorum meetings; the Priests in that 



30 



GENERAL, CONFERENCE. 



ward over there are not being used; 
the Teachers fail to visit the families 
of the Saints, and the Deacons are 
careless and Indifferent. The question 
arises, where is the fault? Where 
fhall the responsibility be placed? Up- 
on the High Priests? Yes. Upon the 
Elders? Yes. Upon the Seventies? 
Yes. A great responsibility rests upon 
these men who have received the 
Priesthood. But let me say to you, 
there is a further responsibility, a re- 
sponsibility resting upon the presiding 
authorities in the stakes and wards. I 
do not believe that it is the duty of 
the president of a stake to spend his 
whole time in preaching the Gospel. I 
look upon the presidency of a stake 
as executive officers. You will find in 
every stake of Zion scores of preachers, 
eloquent men, who can edify and 
strengthen the people, and it is not 
needful for the presidency of the stake 
to spend very much time in preaching 
the gospel. But it is their duty to see 
that others magnify their calling; to 
see that the presidency of the High 
Priests' quorum honor the Priesthood; 
to see that the presidency of the El- 
ders' quorum are active, diligent and 
faithful men, and to watch over these 
quorums of the Priesthood and see that 
«very man does his duty. Then I con- 
ceive it to be the duty of a Bishop, 
not so much to preach the gospel at 
length, or to occupy much time in the 
pulpit, but to be the executive officer 
«f the ward, to deal in temporal af- 
fairs, to be a common judge in Israel, 
and to sit in the Bishop's court and 
adjudicate and regulate the affairs of 
his ward, with his counselors. It is 
the duty of the Bishop particularly to 
fee that the presidencies of the quo- 
rums of the Lesser Priesthood are 
active and faithful. Let him see also 
that the presidencies of the auxiliary 
organizations are faithful in the per- 
formance of their duty. The great re- 
sponsibility resting upon him is to see 
that others do their duty, and let the 
preaching of the gospel be done by the 
brethren and sisters of his ward. Our 
Church is full of good preachers. Every 
man that bears the Priesthood is called 
to be a preacher of righteousness, to 
be a minute man, and to be on hand 



when called out of the congregation. I 
venture to say, that Prest. Smith, who 
presides here, could find hundreds of 
men in this congregation who are elo- 
quent preachers of the gospel, well in- 
formed men, who have preached the 
word in foreign lands with great power, 
and they could come to this stand and 
edify and strengthen the people. Time 
would not permit of this, and it might 
not be appropriate at a general conr 
ference, when we come together to hear 
from the Presidency of the Church and 
some of the leading authorities upon 
matters of moment; but the spirit of 
the conference can be taken by the 
presidents of stakes and Bishops of 
wards into all Zion. 

I rejoice in this work. I rejoice in 
the Priesthood, and marvel greatly at 
the wisdom, power and greatness of 
the Almighty, and I must needs ascribe 
to Him the honor and the glory for the 
wonderful things that are being ac- 
complished in His Church. It is the 
Spirit of God, even the Holy Ghost 
working in the hearts of the people 
that brings to pass the purposes of 
Jehovah. God bless you. Amen. 

ELDER A. O. WOODRUFF. 
All who know the truth should testify to It — 
Wrongfulness of an unforgiving spirit — 
Wonderful growth cf the Church. 

My beloved brethren and sisters, the 
desire that shall prompt my remarks 
this morning to this congregation will 
be to say something by way of testi- 
mony to the divinity of the mission of 
our Lord and Master, Jesus Christ, to 
the divinity of the mission of the Pro- 
phet Joseph Smith, and in support of 
the established and recognized author- 
ity of God our Eternal Father upon the 
earth. I feel a natural spirit of tim- 
idity in standing before this vast con- 
gregation, but I have an unshaken con- 
fidence in God, and I know that by His 
help and the aid and the sympathy and 
prayers of my brethren and sisters, I 
may be able to say something that will 
be of benefit to the Latter-day Saints 
who have gathered here in this con- 
ference for the purpose of being fed 
with the bread of everlasting life. I 
desire to read to you a few verses from 
the 39th Section of the book of Doc-

32 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Priesthood is conferred upon men, and 
it has a right effect upon them, it 
will make them more humble and more 
childlike. It will not puff them up and 
make them great in their own estima- 
tion. The greater the authority or call- 
ing that is placed upon men, the more 
humble they should be, and the 
greater in their own estimation. 
The greater desire they ought 
to have to save mankind. The . 
whole need not a physician, but those 
who are sick. Those who are spiritual- 
ly sick are the ones that need the aid 
of the servants and handmaidens of 
God. Those who know that Jesus is 
the Christ, those who know that Joseph 
Smith was sent of God, those who have 
implicit confidence in the leadership of 
this Church today, need no particular 
laboring with. They will labor for the 
benefit of others, to bring about much 
righteousness, although they may not 
be especially commanded to do so. But 
we want to look after some of those 
who have not this faith and this tes- 
timony. Many of the men who were 
the pioneers of this work, and who aid- 
ed in laying its foundation, I am sorry 
to say that some of their sons and 
daughters have drifted away from the 
Church of Christ. People may say that 
these men devoted so much of their 
time to the Church that they neglected 
their families. Be that as it may, these 
men were good men. They enjoyed the 
spirit of the callings whereunto God 
had called them; and if on account of 
their devotion to the work of the Lord 
some of their sons and daughters are 
not doing as they ought to do today, 
there should be a spirit of charity and 
of love manifest on the part of stake 
and ward officials toward them, to try 
and bring them back, and not to cast 
them off. I believe as I believe that I 
stand here, that in the resurrection of 
the dead, there will be some stake and 
ward officials come under sore con- 
demnation before men that have stood 
as leaders in this work, because their 
sons and daughters have not been 
sought after and labored with as much 
as they ought to have been — where this 
spirit of forgiveness has not been ex- 
hibited. No matter what authority a 
man may hold in this Church, it does 



not exalt him to that degree that he is 
justified in not forgiving the repentant 
and those who desire to do better, and 
who will come and supplicate for for- 
giveness. Men who have taken this 
stand will come under the condemna- 
tion spoken of in the verses I have 
read, and in them will remain the 
greater sin. Thank God, there are not 
many unforgiving men in this Church; 
but occasionally we have found men 
who have been unforgi\-ing to those 
who have sinned and then repented 
and sought forgiveness. Where do you 
suppose we would be if God should deal 
with us in this way. It is not right. 
f tell you that the stake or ward offi- 
cial who will take this stand will re- 
ceive sore reprimanding at the hands 
of the fathers of these sons and daugh- 
ters that have thus been dealt with, 
when they meet them in the resurrec- 
tion. An unforgiving spirit is by no 
means an evidence of strong charac- 
ter; it is quite the reverse. A man 
of strong character, who understands 
the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ, 
would ask his own little child to for- 
give him, if he had wronged that little 
one; and he would not feel, even if he 
had received some great calling in the 
Priesthood, that it was beneath his dig- 
nity to go to the one he had w:|nged 
and make it right. As a result of this 
spirit of unforgiveness, which has been 
exhibited in the past in some of the 
stakes of Zion, though, I am happy to 
say, to a very small degree, we occa- 
sionally find men who are not doing 
anything in the Church, because they 
have some grievance against the pres- 
ident of the stake or the Bishop. Can 
not the man who is called to be the 
shepherd of that flock afford to go a 
little more than half way in order to 
save some member of his flock? Can he 
not afford to go to the one who feels 
offended at his action, although he may 
not be in the wrong, and say. 
"Brother, I want to straighten this 
matter out with you?" But why is it 
that some of our brethren, 
instead of doing this, will feel 
like beating them over the head and 
keeping them down; and if they mani- 
fest any desire to do right again and 
to take an active part in the Church, 
instead of holding their arms out, as 



ELDER ABRAHAM O. WOODRUFF.

Christ would, to welcome them back 
to the fold as they should do, they con- 
tinue to drive them forth and to cast 
them out, and to keep them down, so 
that they never have any chance to do 
"better; unless they move out of the 
confines of that stake or ward. 

My brethren and sisters, in these 
thing's all that is required of any man 
who presides over a stake or ward is 
to follow the example of the men who 
stand at the head of this Church. The 
Presidency of the Church will never 
require anything of the Presidents of 
Stakes that they would be unwilling 
to do themselves. They are anxious for 
the salvation of the souls of men, and 
that none should be cast out; that 
those who are weak and sore in their 
spirits should be healed and brought 
back, if possible, into full fellow- 
ship with the Church of Christ. We 
do not want to lose any of those that 
are committed to our care. If God will 
help us, we do not intend to do it. If 
He has made us the shepherd, the 
watchman upon the tower of a Stake; 
if He has made us the shepherd of a 
ward, or the watchman upon its tow- 
ers, let us guard that flock well, and 
strive with all the power that God has 
given us to save all those who have 
been committed to our care. We spend 
hundreds of thousands of dollars and 
give the time and the lives of our El- 
ders to spread the Gospel abroad, and 
why should we not be just as anxious 
to save those at home who have drifted 
away or have become cold in the Gos- 
pel? Why should we not be just as 
anxious to bring .them back to the fold 
and awaken the spirit of God within 
them, as we would be to go to Japan 
or other parts of the earth, to make 
the Gospel message known there? One 
is quite as important as tlie other; and 
I am sure that a president of a Stake, 
a Bishop of a ward, or any other man 
holding a responsible position in the 
Church will not feel happy in the res- 
urrection if a son or a daughter of one 
of the prominent men of this Church, 
or of any other man, comes up and 
says, "Brother, I did wrong when I was 
in the flesh. I went to you, as my 
Stake President (or as my Bishop) and 
asked you to forgive me, and you 
would not." I feel that that man will 



occupy a most unenviable position, and 
will have sorrow until that son or 
daughter is saved and enjoys t^at de- 
gree of glory that he or she would have 
enjoyed, had he done his part to help 
the erring one along life's pathway. 

I rejoice exceedingly in the spread of 
the work of God. I rejoice that wher- 
ever the Gospel tree has been planted 
it has not been uprooted, although our 
people have had much to contend with, 
and have had to perform a work that 
could not have been performed by any 
other people upon the face of this pa-th. 
Read the words of Isaiah as contained 
in the Sth chapter of II Nephi, as fol- 
lows: 

"Hearken unto me, ye that follow af- 
ter righteousness: Look unto the rock 
from whence ye are hewn, and to the 
hole of the pit from whence ye are 
die-ged. 

"Look unto Abraham, your father, 
and unto Sarah, she that bear -nm- f or 
I called him alone and bl Q s?ed him. 

"■pY>r the Lord shall comfor* ^i^n he 
will comfort all her waste places: and 
he will make her wilderness M v » T^d°n, 
and her desert like the garden of the 
Lord. Jov and o-ladness s'-a' 1 be f«und 
therein, thanksgiving and the voice of 
melody." 

Are we not, as a whole people, wit- 
nesses unto God our E+e-n-M Tether 
and all men this day that this ^ror^hecy 
has been fulfilled under our eyes? It 
is peculiar that, although tM* is the 
chosen people of God. they ha" been 
called to seWe the desert and barren 
spots of this earth? It is n»cul ! ar in 
one sense, and yet it is qui*e natural 
in another, when we take into con~id- 
eration that through the conversion of 
the desert wastes into gardens and thus 
fulfilling the prophecies, the L^rd has 
had a chance to prove His people, to de- 
velop a superior type of manhood and 
womanhood, and to bring out the best 
qualities of their natures. I rejoice in. 
the work our people are performing. 
I rejoice that the Lord has aided and 
befriended us, and that He has raised 
up many friends from those who are not 
of our faith to assist us in getting our 
rights and to aid us in establishing the 
Gospel of the Lord Jesus in various 
parts of the world. I rejoice in the 
faith that the people have manifested' 
in converting these waste places, in 
their colonization work, and in the ef-

feet that this labor has had upon them. 
If they had never accomplished any- 
thing by way of making homes, they 
have benefitted themselves and been 
rewarded for their labors in the spirit- 
ual advancement that they have made 
while engaged in such work, by the de- 
velopment of faith and seeing the prom- 
ises of God fulfilled upon their heads. 
And we are not through with this work 
yet. Calls are made from time to time 
for our people to go to this or that 
place, and the only trouble is, we have 
not colonists enough to meet the de- 
mand. I shall welcome the day when 
the gathering, without which the Gos- 
pel is not complete, shall be more 
thoroughly carried into effect than it 
has been during the past few years. It 
has been rather discouraging on ac- 
count of the lack of labor and the con- 
ditions which have surrounded us, and 
I shall rejoice when these barriers are 
removed and the gate shall again be 
open; when the people of the Stakes 
of Zion shall exhibit that liberal spirit 
which was exhibited by the people in 
the early days here, in taking in the 
newcomer and assisting to get him em- 
ployment, so that he might establish 
himself in Zion. We do not have as 
much sympathy for the people who ac- 
cept the Gospel abroad as we ought to 
have, for the reason, I think sometimes, 
that we forget their situation. "We for- 
get that if they remain where they are, 
although they may be able to do much 
good in assisting the Elders and in 
spreading the Gospel, their children will 
naturally intermarry with those not of 
our faith, and therefore they will not 
have the joy or the satisfaction which 
the Gospel in its fulness carries with it 
where the people are gathered and en- 
joy the blessings of Church organiza- 
tion. I would ask the Stake presidents 
to encourage a spirit on the part of the 
people to be willing to say to the Pre- 
sidency of the Church, "If you will send 
us ten families (or twenty or thirty, as 
the case may be) into this Stake, we 
will see to it that ih:y are aided in mak- 
ing homes, so that they may establish 
themselves in the borders of Zion." I 
believe that great good could be accom- 
plished in this regard by the Stake pre- 
sidents and Bishops getting together to 
exchange ideas in relation to this mat- 



ter, so that there may be a more 
thorough looking after the new con- 
verts who come into the Stakes of Zion, 
that they may not feel friendless and 
that there is no one to receive or wel- 
come them, but that someone may look 
after them and nurse them until they 
are able to go alone. If this is done, 
how grateful they will be to us in after 
years. It may take some of our prop- 
erty, it may mean some sacrifice on our 
part to do it, but how they will bless 
us when they themselves have good 
homes in Zion, with their sons and 
daughters around them, married in the 
Church of Christ and having a numer- 
ous posterity. This is an individual 
work that we are engaged In. It is not 
the work of any one man, or any 
quorum of men; the responsibility rests 
upon the shoulders of any individual 
in the Church, and it becomes us all to 
feel an interest in these things. If we 
will do this, the Lord will bless us, and 
He will make us happier. We must not 
simply strive after dollars and cents; 
but let us do some good to others as 
we go along, by assisting them to enjoy 
the comforts and blessings which we 
enjoy. 

I rejoice exceedingly in this confer- 
ence. I thank God that He has per- 
mitted our Brother Grant to return 
home and visit with us. His mission 
has been a success. If he never ac- 
complishes any more, he has gone and 
turned the key in the Gospel door to the 
nation of Japan, and the Gospel has 
been established there; at least, the 
seed has been sown, and has partially 
taken root. This will bring joy and 
satisfaction to the many Latter-day 
Saints who have upheld and sustained 
him by their faith and prayers, just as 
we uphold and sustained Apostle Ly- 
man in his presidency over the Euro- 
pean mission. Every Latter-day Saint 
feels a personal interest in the labors 
of these brethren and their associates 
m the mission field, as well as in every 
other mission president and every Elder 
who is laboring for the spread of truth 
upon the face of the earth. I re- 
joice in the advancement of the work 
of God, in the numerical strength that 
we have gained, and in the prosperity 
which God has sent to us in answer to 
the prayers of the people and in fulfil-

ment of His promises if they would 
obey His law. I rejoice in a testimony 
of the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ; 
that I have a knowledge that this is 
God's work, and not the work of man; 
that I have a knowledge that Joseph 
Smith was a Prophet of the true and 
living God, and that Joseph F. Smith 
and his counselors are the men that 
God has called to preside over this 
Church at this time, and that they hold 
every key, every gift and authority 
which was conferred upon the Prophet 
Joseph Smith; that this people have 
come to the vales of Israel in fulfill- 
ment of the prophecies which Were 
made by the Prophet Joseph, and have 
established villages, towns and cities 
throughout this intermountain region, 
and that the work will roll forth until 
it fills the whole earth. God grant that 
we may be faithful, in connection with 
our brethren and sisters, in this great 
latter day work, that our hearts may 
be filled with sympathy, and that our 
education in this life may not be whol- 
ly of the head, but of the heart also; 
which may God grant, for Christ's sake. 
Amen. * 

ELDER JOSEPH E. ROBINSON. 

My very dear brothers and sisters, I 
have been asked to speak a few mo- 
ments in relation to the California mis- 
sion. It is most gratifying unto me to 
report that the same Spirit that ac- 
tuates the Saints in Zion is felt by 
those who reside in the state of Cali- 
fornia. I do not know that there is a 
more cosmopolitan people in these 
United States than the people of that 
great state. They are liberal-minded; 
there is very little prejudice existing in 
their minds; but there is an indiffer- 
ence in relation to all things pertaining 
to the Gospel of Christ. They are a 
pleasure-seeking people, and a money- 
making community. But for that, we 
are received well, and many open their 
doors and their hearts to receive us. 
They say they believe that we have 
within our organization and in the very 
genius of the Gospel we teach that 
which will uplift and benefit mankind 
and will do more to bring about the fra- 
ternal spirit that characterized the ef- 
forts of Christ and His Apostles than 



that taught by any other people. From 
a very few members some eight or ten 
years ago, the branches have increased 
in the largest cities of the coast to num- 
ber about 600 souls. Last year they paid 
a tithing of upwards of $5,000, and 
about $600 in fast offerings. Many of 
them are desirous of coming to the 
house of the Lord to receive their bless- 
ings, and the spirit of gathering is upon 
them, despite the fact that we advise 
them to stay at their homes and at their 
various employments, and build up the 
branches in the State. It seems, how- 
ever, that so soon as they have been 
born into the kingdom by baptism and 
the laying on of hands of those in au- 
thority, a yearning and a longing comes 
into their hearts to be within the 
Stakes and borders of Zion, to partake 
of the blessings which their more for- 
tunate brothers and sisters enjoy. 

The recent visit of the Tabernacle 
choir to the coast will no doubt give a 
wonderful impetus to the cause. It 
has broken down the barriers of pre- 
judice in the minds of many, and we 
are being felt after and enquired about. 
The secretary of state and the mayors 
of San Francisco and Sacramento were 
most kind and courteous in receiving 
us, in keeping open public buildings, in 
guaranteeing and giving us police pro- 
tection, and welcomed us with a spirit 
of fraternal brotherhood that was very 
pleasing and satisfactory, I believe, to 
all our visitors, and especially to us 
who are laboring in that state. 

Thousands of tourists go to the sum- 
mer land, as it is called, to spend their 
winter, and they enquire after us. They 
hear us on the street corners, receive 
our tracts, attend our meetings, and are 
frank enough to admit that in the east, 
where they reside, they would hardly 
do it, for fear of losing caste; but many 
of them have gone home with a broader 
idea and a better knowledge of our 
work and of our people, and are more 
kindly disposed towards us. Many of 
them, upon hearing our choir, left their 
addresses in the east with the Elders, 
saying that if there were any Elders In 
their neighborhood they wanted them 
to call, so that they might hear more 
of what little they had seen and heard 
of us in California. 

My brothers and sisters, I know that 



36

the Gospel is true, and that it is leaven- 
ing the whole lump and modifying the 
sentiment of the Christian world. We 
hear it, we feel it, we see it, in what is 
being said and done today upon the 
coast, where their churches are being 
emptied and their pleasure resorts are 
being filled by the doctrines of men as 
they are now taught. It brings joy 
and satisfaction to my soul to know- 
that I have been born of goodly parents, 
and have received and do participate 
in the Gospel of Christ, which will 
bring men to a full salvation and an 
exaltation in His presence; and that 
that may be our happy lot is my prayer 
in the name of Jesus. Amen.

My brethren and sisters, it is very 
gratifying to see so many in attend- 
ance upon this conference, and I feel 
that there has been a pleasing variety 
of instructions given unto us, and that 
it would be a good thing for the Lat- 
fer-day Saints as a whole, and for the 
Priesthood especially, to make a little 
note, if not in a notebook, in their 
minds, of the items of instruction that 
are touched upon, so that we may act 
upon it in our various wards and stakes 
when we return. It is not in glittering 
peneialities that we accomplish much; 
it is in taking down the details and 
working at them in such a way as to 
bri.ig good fruits out of them. I do 
not remember of attending a conference 



where I felt that the Spirit of the Lord 
had more thoroughly and in a more 
appropriate way actuated the brethren, 
touching upon those subjects which are 
especially adapted to our wants. 

I have felt impressed with one idea 
while listening to my brethren, and 
that is that the whole history of this 
work has gone to show that we do 
not need the help of the world to sus- 
tain it. I do not mean by this to de- 
preciate any kind assistance, sentiment 
or support that may be accorded unto 
us by honest and upright men who, 
from time to time, defend the rights of 
the Latter-day Saints, and who have 
sufficient of the light of truth to see 
the purity and power of the doctrines 
that are taught by this people; but I 
mean to say that it all goes to show 
that God has established this great 
work, and that He has sustained it in 
every sense of the word. When I heard 
Brother Smoot this morning talking 
and reading a little about the ideas of 
men concerning the effect of "Mormon- 
ism," as it is termed, more especially in 
the eastern states, some of them en- 
tertaining the idea that it was a great 
menace to the people, I thought to my- 
self that the world had got the night- 
mare. I heard Sol Smith Russell once 
read an essay on the horse. He said 
that the horse was a noble animal. It 
would live on oats and sawdust, he 
said. Then he went on to describe the 
various kinds of horses there were in 
existence. He said there was the saw- 
horse, and there was the horse-radish, 
and then there was the Colt's revolver, 
and then there was the night-mare. He 
said, "the nightmare is a horse that 
is born in the night, and my Aunt Jane 
has lots of them." I think sectarian- 
ism has the nightmare over this work, 
and possibly it is all right that they 
should have. It makes me feel that 
there are not only prophets among the 
people of God, but there are some pro- 
phets in the world. I heard one of our 
local politicians a few years ago stand 
up before a public audience, when the 
question of dividing on national po- 
litical lines was agitated among this 
people, and some doubted the propri- 
ety of it. They wanted to hold the old 
anti-Mormon party together, and more 
thoroughly crowd us to the wall, and 



ELDER MATTHIAS F. COWLEY. '

use their power with the great parties 
of the nation to distress and oppress 
this people by inimical legislation. One 
of the speakers that stood up to ad- 
dress that audience made this state- 
ment: "The Mormons will come out on 
top, no matter what you do." He said 
he did not believe in dividing on po- 
litical lines; he believed in keeping- the 
hand over the Mormons just as long as 
possible, because, said he, they will 
come out on top. To illustrate his pro- 
phecy he told an anecdote about Gen. 
Mahone of Virginia, and one of his 
negro slaves, and he compared us to 
the general and themselves to the slave. 
He said this poor slave had a dream. 
He dreamed that he died and went to 
the gates of heaven, and there he met 
the Apostle Peter. N Peter asked him 
who he was. "Why," said he, "I am 
the slave of Gen. Mahone of Virginia." 
"Well," said Peter, "are you mounted, 
or are you on foot?" "I'm on foot," he 
replied. "Well," said Peter, "you can't 
come in here." So the poor 
nigger started down the steps, 
and he met his master at the 
bottom, and he said to him, "General, 
whar d'ye think you're gwine?" "I'm 
going to heaven," said the General. 
"No, you're not," he said; "you can't 
get in dar, unless you're mounted." 
At this a happy thought struck the 
nigger, and he said to the General: 
"I'll tell you, General, I'll git down on 
all fours, and you git on my back, 
and when Peter ask you if you're 
mounted, say, yes, and we both ride 
right in." So the General got on his 
back, and when they got up to the 
gates of heaven, Peter asked who he 
was. He replied that he was General 
Mahone, of Virginia. "Are you mounted 
or are you on foot?" "I'm mounted," 
said the General. "Well," said 
Peter, "tie your horse on the outside, 
and come in." This great politician that 
was opposed to the Latter-day Saints 
being identified with the national polit- 
ical parties said, "They will walk right 
in whether they are mounted or on 
foot." And I thought to mysel". he has 
got the key to the whole thing; he un- 
derstands it just about right. And why 
is it, my brethren and sisters? It is 
because God has established this work. 
I want to read just a little. The 



brethren have been reading the Scrip- 
tures, and I believe it is all right to 
have a little Scripture reading on these 
occasions. The Lord says, as record- 
ed in section 1 of the Book of Doctrine 
and Covenants, that this is "the only 
true and living Church upon the face 
of the whole earth, with which I, the 
Lord, am well pleased, speaking unto 
the Church collectively and not individ- 
ually." While God has established this 
work, and He is pleased with it because 
it is His work, we ought not to lose 
sight of the fact that He is not pleased 
with every individual in it, only to the 
extent that that individual conforms 
his life to the principles and spirit of 
this Gospel. The only safe thing for 
a Latter-day Saint is to be found in 
the discharge of every duty, to be found 
absolutely free from sin and complying 
with every principle, as far as possi- 
ble, that the Lord our God has re- 
vealed. A great deal has been said at 
this conference and at our meeting last 
night respecting evils that creep in 
among the Latter-day Saints. While 
we speak of them from this stand and 
warn the people, while President Smith 
gives unto us the word of God, it is 
the bounden duty of the local Priest- 
hood in every stake of Zion and in ev- 
ery ward to see that iniquity is rooted 
out from among the people of God, that 
the day may come when the Lord shall 
say that He is not only pleased with 
the Church collectively, but individual- 
ly a'sc, it having been, purified and 
sanctified from every sin. 

I started to tell you the one thought 
I had in mind, and another thought 
connected with it: that as the work of 
God has been established and pro- 
moted in the earth without the support 
of men, without their financial assist- 
ance, without the popularity of the 
world, in a religious sense, so I say 
that God will sustain this work from a 
temporal point of view, and make the 
Latter-day Saints a united people, a 
peopli of absolute unity in regard to 
all things, provided we do just the 
same in temporal things as we have 
done in spiritual things — that is, lis- 
ten to the voice of God, enjoy the in- 
spiration of the Holy Spirit, and be 
guided and controlled by the direction 
and counsel of the holy Priesthood. By 



38 



GENERAL, CONFERENCE. 



doing so we can become one in all 
things. "We ought not to consider that 
there is anything of a carnal nature, 
or, if you please, of a temporal nature 
— something that pertains in its effects 
to this life only; for there is nothing 
associated with the work of God upon 
the earth but has its effects, not only 
here, but throughout the countless ages 
of eternity. As we live near to God 
in all respects, so shall we be entitled 
to the companionship and, according to 
our faithfulness, a greater measure of 
the Holy Spirit, that will give us a bet- 
ter understanding of the things 
of God, qualify us to live nearer 
unto God, and consequently to se- 
cure unto ourselves a greater exalta- 
tion in His presence. There is nothing 
of a temporal or transitory nature 
connected with the work of God. One 
of the ancient prophets said, "I know 
that that which God doeth He doeth 
forever." What He does, eternal ef- 
fects are realized therefrom. The 
Prophet Joseph Smith made this state- 
ment: "Whatsoever you do, you ought 
to do with an eye to futurity." It 
ought to be done with reference to the 
effects that will result from our ac- 
tion in the future. 

I was very much impressed with a 
remark made by President Lund af- 
fecting our conduct and conversation 
in the presence of our children, where- 
in he said that some were in the habit 
of making remarks that were depre- 
ciatory in their nature concerning 
their brethren, concerning the Bishop 
of the ward, or the President of the 
Stake, or the authorities of the Church, 
and some, perhaps, were given to mak- 
ing remarks that were disrespectful to 
some of the principles of the Gospel, 
in the presence of their children. 
Where this is done, it ought to be re- 
pented of and discontinued; for it will 
have a telling effect in the hearts of 
the youth of Zion. I remember a most 
striking illustration of this in the case 
of one of the leading brethren in the 
Church. I have heard him stand up 
time and time again and declare the 
word of God to the people. I have heard 
him give counsel to the saints of God, 
that they should never speak disres- 
pectfully of the authorities of this 
Church, and especially in the presence 



of their children. That same man was 
guilty of that which he warned the 
Saints against, and today he has lost 
his standing and posterity, following 
the example that he practised in pri- 
vate but declared against in public, 
have fallen into his habits and disres- 
pect the servants of God. My breth- 
ren and sisters, it is salvation we are 
after. It is to establish and ground 
our children in the faith. We ought 
to live and labor to this end, that they 
may not turn aside, and afterwards say 
they turned aside because their parents 
set them a bad example. You know, 
President Kimball once prophesied to 
this people, and especially to the moth- 
ers, that if they spoke disrespectfully 
of a certain principle of the Gospel 
and fought against it, the day would 
come when their daughters would turn 
aside and lose their virtue, and be- 
come objects of immorality upon the 
streets of Salt Lake City. I want 
to say that that prediction, sorrowful 
though it may seem, has had its ful- 
fillment. I -want to endorse the in- 
structions of my brethren that we 
ought to look carefully after the con- 
duct of our children who are running 
the streets of Salt Lake City, and, for 
that matter, the streets of all the cities 
and towns throughout Zion. I know 
that evil habits creep in among us. I 
know there is an influence brought to 
bear upon the minds of the little ones 
to learn and to practise evil, which 
goes to destroy their force of body and 
of mind, and to grieve the Spirit of God 
from them. Now, the responsibility 
is especially upon those who bear the 
Holy Priesthood. The teachers who go 
out to visit the saints from family to 
family ought to be men endowed with 
the spirit of revelation from God. They 
ought to study the principles of the 
Gospel, and to so live that they may 
enjoy the inspiration of the Holy 
Ghost in their instructions, so that 
their instructions may be understood 
and be attractive to the children; that 
they should not go simply to carry out 
a routine, to ask certain questions, just 
to be able to say that they have made 
their monthly visit. They ought to be 
men inspired with the spirit of revela- 
tion from God, that they may touch the 
hearts of the families, and especially of

the children, where they visit. "While 
it has been said here that there is a 
sentiment among the people, to some 
extent, which does not respect the 
Priesthood, referring to the authorities 
of the wards and stakes, and of the 
Church, I want to say that we do not 
respect the Lesser Priesthood as much 
as we ought to do. "We ought to res- 
pect every Deacon in the Church, and 
encourage every Deacon to per- 
form his duty. We ought to 
respect every teacher, and make 
him welcome, and sustain him in his 
administrations in our homes. I know 
that those who understand the Priest- 
hood best, and who have the greatest 
respect for it, are the men that will call 
their families together when the Teach- 
ers pay them a visit, and will sit down 
and listen to what the Teachers have to 
say. When I was a boy, in the Four- 
teenth ward, with Brother John W. 
Taylor' and other young men, I used to 
visit President John Taylor as a Teach- 
er. I used to visit President Wilford 
Woodruff in the same capacity. I will 
admit that I was glad when they were 
away from home, because I was so 
frightened; but when I got through and 
left the house I was glad they were at 
home, and that they had been there 
to receive me as a Teacher in his 
Church of Christ. They treated us with 
more respect, they made us feel more 
at home, and they encouraged us more 
in the discharge of our duty than any 
families that we had to visit upon the 
block. This was because they had the 
spirit of the Gospel and understood the 
responsibility of the Holy Priesthood. 
I remember that many beautiful lessons 
I enjoyed on the principle of faith came 
from the sweet instructions of President 
John Taylor when we visited him as a 
Teacher;for when we would get through 
with our duties, he would say, "Now, 
boys, you have been teaching me, I 
would like to teach you a little;" and 
he would tell us anecdotes to increase 
faith in our minds; tell us how he had 
asked God to open up his way while de- 
claring the Gospel abroad, to give him 
a little money, just what he needed to 
pay for pamphlets or something of that 
kind, and the Lord answered his 
prayers in a most remarkable manner. 
He told us many incidents of this 



character, and they tended to create 
and encourage the principle of faith in 
our hearts. 

My brethren and sisters, may God 
enable us to remember the glorious in- 
structions which we have received; re- 
member what President Smith has said, 
that we are in a better condition, as a 
whole, than ever before. Let us all see 
to it that he shall not be disappointed 
in this sentiment of encouragement con- 
cerning this people. Let us remem- 
ber the instructions of Brother McMur- 
rin and the Seventies In regard to our 
duties and obligations in the selection 
of missionaries to send the Gospel 
abroad to the ends of the earth. Let 
us remember the admonition concerning 
our tithing, and our moral deportment, 
and every obligation that the Gospel of 
Jesus Christ enjoins upon us. If we 
do this, all is well with us. Every Lat- 
ter-day Saint knows that to be found 
in the discharge of his duty makes him 
a happy man, and when he is not in 
the discharge of his duty there is an 
uneasiness about him which makes him 
feel that something is wrong. May 
God bless you, my brethren and sis- 
ters; help us to keep the command- 
ments which He has given unto us, and 
to perform the duties enjoined upon us, 
to be ready at all times to go abroad 
and declare the Gospel, or to work in the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ at home. The 
best kind of a Latter-day Saint is the 
man or the woman that is ready for any 
kind of labor, whether at home or 
abroad, and has no hobby, no special 
desire in a certain channel, to the de- 
preciation of everything else. God bless 
you. in the name of Jesus. Amen.

I have listened with a great deal of 
interest during the meetings of this 
conference, and I believe it is the larg- 
est conference I have ever attended in 
the Church. Fifty-one years ago the 
9th of April I was baptized, when the 
ice was about three feet thick, and had 
to be cut away, and I have not lost 
interest in this work yet. I remember 
I was quite zealous when I was first

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



baptized. I was soon ordained a 
Priest and sent out to teach. I acted 
two years in that capacity. When I 
came to this valley I was appointed a 
Teacher in the North Canyon ward, 
and labored in that capacity for eight 
years; and then moved to Cache val- 
ley, under the counsel of Apostles Or- 
son Hyde and Ezra T. Benson. I was 
appointed Bishop there, and acted in 
that capacity 18 years. Subsequently, 
I was appointed to labor in the stake 
presidency with Brother W. B. Preston 
and acted in that capacity for 10 years 
Since that time I have labored in the 
quorum of the Apostles. But I want to 
say that there never was a time when 
I felt that I was really qualified for 
the position I was called to occupy. 
I feel the same way yet. There is no 
disposition in me to boast. I am thank- 
ful to the Lord that I have been pre- 
served in the Church for over 50 years, 
and I hope to continue in it as long as 
I am alive. I know this work is from 
the Lord. I know that Joseph Smith 
was a great Prophet, raised up to 
usher in this last dispensation of the 
Gospel. I had evidence of this even be- 
fore I was baptized, and it has never 
departed from me. I want to bear rec- 
ord to my brethren and sisters here 
that there is no other way of retain- 
ing the spirit of this work and the 
fellowship of the Holy Ghost than 
through faithfulness and diligence in 
observing to keep the commandments 
of the Lord. The individual who will 
be humble all the day long and strive 
to keep the commandments of the 
Lord will never apostatize or become 
dissatisfied, but he or she will be pre- 
served in the truth, and by and by will 
sit down in the mansions of the Fath- 
er, to enjoy the blessings of eternal life. 
People who are spiritually-minded are 
devoted to the work. They pay their 
tithes and their offerings; they go to 
the ward meetings and to the stake 
meetings, and they are willing to de- 
vote their time, their talents and 
their all for the building up of the king- 
dom of God on the earth. 

We have had credit from the Pres- 
ident of the Church during this confer- 
ence of doing very well in paying our 
tithing. We have done well, there is 
no question about that; but let every 



individual ask himself if he has come 
up to the standard. I think we shall 
be led to conclude that we have not 
quite got there yet. No doubt, a great 
many brethren and sisters pay their 
tithing in full, and if they were to sit 
in judgment upon themselves they 
would not need to be judged of others; 
for they would be able to say in all 
sincerity, "I have done the best I 
could." But there is another class who, 
if they were to sit in judgment upon 
themselves, would be forced to say they 
had not come up to the standard. The 
Lord expects us all, as His servants 
and handmaidens, to come up to the 
standard. He expects us to pay our 
tithing and our offerings in full. The 
giving of offerings is associated with 
the payment of tithing — offerings for 
the benefit of those immediately around 
us who need our help, to obviate the 
necessity of the Bishop having to make 
application to the Church for funds to 
support the poor. If we were to observe 
this law strictly, we are amply able in 
all our wards to support the poor. There 
are many people in the Church, I have 
discovered, who are willing to support 
themselves rather than receive offer- 
ings, if they could only be given em- 
ployment. Even the aged can do some- 
thing, unless they are maimed or dis- 
abled; and this is a matter for the 
Bishops to look after, to see that people 
have employment, as' far as possible, 
and to encourage the payment of offer- 
ings as well as tithing. 

If tithing is never mentioned 
in a ward from one month's end 
to another, neither by the Bishop 
nor the Priests and Teachers, that ward 
will not come up to the standard. 
There are lots of people who would 
come up to the standard if their minds 
were stirred up by way of remem- 
brance. I am not one who believes that 
it is proper for the Bishop to be always 
talking about tithing; but I believe 
it should be kept before the people. 
They should be encouraged to pay their 
tithing when they get it, and not wait 
till the end of the year. If your salary 
is paid to you each month, pay your 
tithing each month. I want to bear t 
testimony that that is the easiest and 
the best way to pay tithing. Pay it 
when you get it, and let it be the first 



ELDER M. W. MERRILL. 



41 



thing. . Let us pay our tithing- first, and 
then distribute the rest as far as it will 
go. If we will do this, we shall find 
that tithing is easily paid; and when 
the end of the year comes we shall be 
glad, and prepared to settle with the 
Bishop with a cheerful heart. 

Take us as a whole people, we are 
better off than other people, after all, 
though there are too many of us in 
debt, with mortgages on our homes. 
The Lord has blessed us. He has bless- 
ed and sanctified our land, and it has 
brought forth in its strength, in the 
season thereof. 

There is a great deal of faith exhibit- 
ed among the Latter-day Saints, and 
that faith, no doubt, will increase as 
the Saints grow older and get more ex- 
perience. In the last 50 years I have 
seen many things that have given me a 
great deal of joy and increased my 
faith. I have seen the prayers of the 
brethren answered. I have seen the 
prayers of little children answered in 
the homes of their parents. I remem- 
ber a few years ago in Cache valley we 
l ad a drouth for some years. There 
was very little snow, and lots of grass- 
hoppers to eat our crops. I remem- 
ber Apostle Orson Pratt coming to visit 
us. He went to every settlement in 
the valley, and he prayed everywhere 
that the Lord would send moisture up- 
on the mountains and valleys. I trav- 
eled with him, and he never forgot 
this. He always prayed himself in the 
family circle, and he prayed every time 
that the snows might come. In fulfill- 
ment of his prayers the snows did come, 
s nd we had more that year than we had 
had for years before; the mountains 
were filled with snow. I have seen evi- 
dences of this same thing recently; 
when prominent Elders of the Church 
have prayed that the moisture might 
come, their prayers have been an- 
swered and the moisture has come. I 
do not know of any reason why our 
prayers should not be answered, if we 
will pray in faith believing, and not ask 
amiss or for anything that we ought 
not to have. Do not let us be dis- 
couraged. This is the Lord's workT not 
curs. We did not place ourselves in 
position. None of you Presidents of 
stakes, or Bishops, has ever sought for 
office or wanted office, so far as I know. 



The Lord has called you all. He has 
opened the eyes of our understanding, 
that we have been enabled to compre- 
hend the truth in part, and we are sup- 
posed to make some progress. I have 
thought since coming to this conference, 
that we are making improvement all 
the time. I do not remember the time 
when we could see all the presidents of 
stakes right in front here as we can 
now, for they have been scattered 
among the congregation. It is an im- 
provement having the prominent El- 
ders seated where they can hear every- 
thing. I have been reminded of the 
necessity of this in visiting stake con- 
ferences and seeing the Bishops and 
leading Elders scattered among the 
people. This here is an ensample. 
Bring your leading Elders to the front, 
where they can hear and take part in 
the labors of the conference. This is 
a grand thing, and a sign of progress 
and advancement. 

My brethren and sisters, I am aware 
that there are a number of people 
among us who want to move some- 
where, and they are asking about dif- 
ferent parts of the country. I have 
brethren enquire of me frequently, 
some since I have been here. I want to 
say this about it; It is all right to go if 
you are counseled by the au- 
thorities of your ward or stake, or 
by the authorities of the Church. Get 
good advice, and then, if you go, you 
will feel that you go with the blessing 
of the Lord. Do not let any of our 
people, no matter how desirable a coun- 
try may be, run off on a tangent, with- 
out the advice of the presiding breth- 
ren. Go under the direction of the 
Priesthood, with their consent and good 
feelings, if you want to go. It' may 
be all right for you to go just where 
you want to go, but get counsel from 
the brethren. Do not let us be running 
up and down the country simply to bet- 
ter our condition, but let us be satisfied 
to labor under the advice of the Priest- 
hood, and if we will do so, we will 
come out all right. 

Another subject I want to touch upon, 
and then I will close; it is with regard 
to temple work. Brethren and sisters, 
do not forget your temple work. Do not 
leave your kindred dead who have 
slumbered in the grave for years, and 



42 



GENERAL, CONFERENCE. 



perhaps for ages, without going to their 
rescue and giving them relief, as their 
Lord has ordained and appointed. Here 
are the temples of the Lord in this 
state, wherein you may go and admin- 
ister for your kindred that have passed 
away. Do not be so swallowed up in the 
cares of the world that you will neg- 
lect your kindred dead, because we will 
meet them by and by, and we will have 
remorse and sorrow if we have not done 
what we could for them. Remember 
this, and talk of it in your homes. Let 
us prepare our records and labor in the 
interest of our friends who have passed 
away. Of course, the people are doing 
very nicely in this matter; but there 
are many that have not given it consid- 
eration yet. 

God bless you. Let us be true, faith- 
ful, and humble; let us attend to our 
prayers in the morning and evening, 
invoking the blessings of the Lord upon 
us and upon our brethren. Pray for 
your Bishops and Presidents of Stakes; 
pray for the authorities of the Church, 
that they may be guided by the inspir- 
ation that comes from God, so that all 
may be well and prosperous with Israel. 
God bless you. Amen. 

ELDER JOHN W. TAYLOR. 

Graduation in the gospel-Blessings the result of 
obedience to law. 

My dear brethren and sisters, I pray 
that the Spirit of the Lord may direct 
me in all that I shall say, even that 
Spirit of truth and righteousness which 
comes from our heavenly Father. I de- 
sire to bear testimony to all that I 
have heard during this conference. I 
was very much impressed with a re- 
mark made by President Smith, testify- 
ing that the people were more faithful 
and were performing their duties a lit- 
tle better today than they were several 
years ago. There is no one so well 
qualified to judge of the Latter-day 
Saints in the aggregate as President 
Smith. What impressed me particular- 
ly about his remarks was the statement 
that the growth was a gradual one. It 
made me think of the word of the Lord 
unto the Prophet Nephi, when He said, 
"I will give you line upon line, and pre- 
cept upon precept, here a little, and 
there a little, that you may know my 



mind and will concerning all things." 
When we plant a tree in the garden, 
though we should stand by it day and 
night we could not perceive its growth, 
because it is so gradual; but go to that 
tree at the end of six months or a year 
and you will find that it has made re- 
markable development; and so on year 
after year until the tree is fully ma- 
tured. 

I feel strongly impressed in my re- 
marks to touch a little upon the import- 
ance of having the Spirit of the Lord 
with us day by day, to perform the du- 
ties of the day. While that which we 
are doing may not appear to be of any 
great importance at the time, it will be 
very evident at the end of a term of 
months or years that we have made 
marked progress. Like the tree, the 
growth will have been gradual. I de- 
sire to read some scripture, my breth- 
ren and sisters, to show you how our 
Lord and Savior Jesus Christ attained 
the perfection which He reached dur- 
ing His lifetime. I will read from the 
93rd section of the book of Doctrine and 
Covenants : 

"1. Verily, thus saith the Lord, it 
shall come to pass that every soul wh» 
forsaketh his sins and cometh unto 
me, and calleth on my name, and obey- 
eth my voice, and keepeth my com- 
mandments, shall see my face and 
know that I am, 

"2. And that I am the true light 
that lighteth every man that cometh in- 
to the world; 

"3. And that I am in the Father, and 
the Father in me, and the Father and: 
I are one: 

"4. The Father because he gave me 
of his fullness, and the Son because I 
was in the world and made flesh my 
tabernacle, and dwelt among the sons 
of men. 

"5. I was in the world and received 
of my Father, and the works of Him 
were plainly manifest; 

"6. And John saw and bore record of 
the fullness of my glory, and the full- 
ness of John's record is hereafter to be 
revealed: 

"7. And he bore record, saying, I saw 
his glory that he was in the beginning 
before the world was; 

"8. Therefore in the beginning the 
Word was, for he was the Word, even 
the messenger of salvation, 

"9. The light and the Redeemer of 
the world; the Spirit of truth, who 
came into the world, because the world' 
was made by him, and in him was the 
life of men and the light of men. 

"10. The worlds were made by him: 
men were made by him: all things 



ELDER JOHN W. TAYLOR. 



43 



were made by him, and through him, 
and of him. 

"11. And I, John, bear record that I 
beheld his glory, as the glory of the 
Only Begotten of the Father, full of 
grace and truth, even the Spirit of 
truth, which came and dwelt in the 
flesh, and dwelt among us. 

"12. And I, John, saw that he re- 
ceived not of the fulness at the first, 
but received grace for grace: 

"13. And he received not of the full- 
ness at first, but continued from grace 
to grace, until he received a fullness." 

It is this last verse which I desire to 
emphasize, setting forth the fact that 
Jesus Christ received not a fulness of 
glory at first, but He received grace for 
grace. It is in this way, my brethren 
and sisters, that we shall receive a ful- 
ness. It will not come all in a day, nor 
all in a month, nor all in a year; but it 
will come as the reward of the right- 
eous, through faith and diligence in 
keeping the commandments of the Lord, 
at the end of our career upon the earth, 
when we shall be brought before the 
judgment seat of Christ, to be rewarded 
or condemned, according to the deeds 
done in the body. 

"14. And thus he was called the Son 
of God, because he received not of the 
fulness at the first. 

"15. And I, John, bear record, and lo, 
the heavens were opened, and the Holy 
Ghost descended upon him in the form 
of a dove, and sat upon him, and there 
came a voice out of heaven saying, 
This is my beloved Son. 

"16. And I, John, bear record that he 
received a fullness of the glory of the 
Father; 

"17. And he received all power, both 
in heaven and on earth, and the glory 
of the father was with him, for he 
dwelt in him. 

"18. And it shall come to pass, that 
if you are faithful you shall receive 
the fullness of the record of John. 

"19. I give unto you these sayings 
that ye may understand and know hffw 
to worship, and know what you wor- 
ship, that you may come unto the Fath- 
er in my name, and in due time receive 
of his fulness, 

"20. For if you keep my command- 
ments you shall receive of his fulness, 
and be glorified in me as I am in the 
Father; therefore, I say unto you, you 
shall receive grace for grace." 

In other words, we shall receive 
strength according to our day, and the 
Lord will bless us with wisdom per- 
taining to all things committed to our 
care, according to our faithfulness in 
keeping His commandments; for we are 



told, in a revelation contained in this 
great book of revelation given to the 
Prophet Joseph Smith, that the Priest- 
hood is inseparably connected with the 
powers of heaven, and that the powers 
of heaven can only be controlled upon 
the principles of righteousness. 

I desire to draw your attention to a 
peculiar characteristic of our Lord and 
Savior Jesus Christ. I never remember 
of reading where our Lord and Savior 
ever made a promise unto the children 
of men without giving with it a law for 
them to obey in order to obtain the 
blessing, and he always placed the law 
first and the blessing after; and thus 
you can see how the powers of heaven- 
are inseparably connected with the 
Priesthood, Jesus being the great High- 
Priest. To illustrate what I say, let me 
quote a little from the 5th chapter of 
Matthew. Jesus said: 

"Blessed are they which do hunger 
and thirst after righteousness; .for they 
shall be filled with the Holy Ghost." 

Here is a condition, a law to be 
obeyed, namely, that we shall hunger 
and thirst after righteousness; and the 
promise is, we shall be filled with the 
Holy Ghost. In the holy Bible it says, 
"for they shall be filled;" but the more 
perfect translation, as given in the 
Book of Mormon, is, "Blessed are they 
who do hunger and thirst after right- 
eousness, for they shall be filled with 
the Holy Ghost." 

Again, He says: 

"Blessed are the peacemakers; for 
they shall be called the children of God. 

"Blessed are the poor in spirit; for 
their's is the kingdom of heaven." 

He gave many laws, and many bless- 
ings He promised unto the people 
through their obedience to those laws. 
Take, for instance, the case of the rich 
young man who came to Jesus and 
wanted to know what he should do to 
be saved. Jesus told him to keep the 
commandments. The young man re- 
plied, "All these things have I kept 
from my youth up: what lack I yet?" 
Jesus said, "If thou will be perfect, go- 
and sell that thou hast, and give to 
the poor, and thou shalt have treasure 
in heaven: and come and follow me." 
The young man turned away sorrowful, 
"for he had great possessions." The 
same principle is manifest in the Ten 



44 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Commandments. Take, for example, the 
fifth commandment: '-'Honor thy father 
and thy mother: that thy days may be 
long upon the land which the Lord thy 
God giveth thee." This is a law of long 
life. If you wish to live a long time, 
my young brethren and sisters, honor 
and obey your fathers and mothers, 
and the Lord will bless you with this 
desire of your heart; but if you dis- 
obey your parents, you are not entitled 
to a long life; you are not entitled to 
the blessings of God upon you and up- 
on your posterity. On the contrary, 
the Lord says in another of the com- 
mandments, that He visits "the iniquity 
of the fathers upon the children unto 
the third and fourth generation of them 
that hate me." 

My beloved brethren and sisters, I 
rejoice in being present with you today. 
I am glad to see you congregated to- 
gether to receive the word of God from 
His servants, and I have greatly re- 
joiced in the remarks that have been 
made. I am going to take the liberty of 
reading a little more before I close: 

"21. And now, verily I say unto you, 
I was in the beginning with the Father, 
and am the first-born; 

"22. And all those who are begotten 
through me are partakers of the glory 
of the same, and are the church of 
the first-born. 

"22. Ye were also in the beginning 
with the Father; that which is Spirit, 
even the Spirit of truth, 

"24. And truth is a knowledge of 
things as they are, and as they were, 
and as they are to come; 

"25. And whatsoever is more or less 
than this, is the spirit of that wicked 
one who was a liar from the beginning. 

"26. The Spirit of truth is of God. I 
am the Spirit of truth, and John bore 
record of me, saying— He received a 
fulness of truth, yea, even of all truth, 

"27. And no man receiveth a fulness 
unless he keepeth his commandment?. 

"28. He that keepeth his command- 
ments receiveth truth and light, until 
he is glorified in truth and knoweth all 
things. 

"29. Man was also in the beginning 
with God. Intelligence, or the light of 
truth, was not created or made, neither 
indeed can be. 

"30. All truth is independent in that 
sphere in which God has placed it, to 
act for itself, as all intelligence also, 
otherwise there is no existence. 

"31. Behold, here is the agency of 
man, and here is the condemnation of 
man, because that which was from the 
beginning is plainly manifest unto 
them, and they receive, not the light. 



"32. And every man whose spirit re- 
ceiveth not the light is under condem- 
nation, 

"33. For man is spirit. The elements 
are eternal, and spirit and element, in- 
separably connected, receiveth a fulness 
of joy; 

"34. And when separated, man can- 
not receive a fullness of joy. 

"35. The elements are the tabernacle 
of God; yea, man is the tabernacle of 
God, even temples; and whatsoever 
temple is defiled, God shall destroy that 
temple." 

I desire now to testify unto you that 
I know if you will keep the command- 
ments of God the Spirit of the Lbrd 
will increase within you, and you will 
have grace for grace, day by day and 
year by year, as it shall be necessary in 
your endeavors to keep the command- 
ments of the Lord. 

I wish to say a word or two to our 
brethren the Patriarchs. I would feel it 
to be a good thing when they place 
their hands upon the heads of this peo- 
ple to bless them, if they shall feel so 
impressed, to conclude their blessings 
something like this: "I seal these bless- 
ings upon your head, according to your 
faith and your diligence in keeping the 
commandments of the Lord." The Pa- 
triarchs have the gift of being proph- 
ets, seers and revelators, to reveal the 
mind and will of God and portray unto 
the faithful their future lives, and I 
believe it would be pleasing unto the 
Lord if they would seal all blessings 
that they give in a manner similar to 
the one I have suggested, as they shall 
be led by the Holy Spirit. Then there 
can be no disappointment on the part 
of the family or friends of those who 
shall, after receiving a patriarchal 
blessing, turn from the truth and fight 
against God; for they will see that 
these blessings are conditional upon 
their keeping the commandments of 
God. 

May the Lord bless you, my brethren 
and sisters, and bless every man who 
shall speak at this conference, that he 
may speak by the gift and power of 
the Holy Ghost, and that we may re- 
ceive light and knowledge and be fed 
with the bread of life, that we may be 
filled with joy and peace, and that our 
determination may be to serve God and 
keep His commandments. 

I desire to add a testimony to what 



ELDER HEBER J. GRANT.

Elder Smoot has said in reference to 
Elder B. H. Roberts going to Chicago 
to attend the Congress of Religions, and 
being rejected by them. What did they 
do when Jesus Christ came in the meri- 
dian of time? All the sectarian world 
turned against Him. He said that the 
builders had rejected the chief stone of 
the corner. When they rejected Elder 
Roberts in that Congress of Religions, 
they rejected the chief stone of the cor- 
ner; for the cornerstone of the kingdom 
of God has been laid, and the building 
will be completed, according to the 
mind and will of God. Zion will spread 
from state to state, and from nation to 
nation, until this Gospel, which was re- 
vealed unto the Prophet Joseph Smith, 
will be preached unto all nations, all 
kindreds, all tongues, and all people; 
and out of every nation God will bring 
the honest in heart up to the land of 
Zion, that they may be redeemed, and 
that they may redeem their dead; for 
the day is coming, and now is, as we 
are told in the scriptures, when they 
that are dead shall hear His voice. 
Men will hear His voice, for His com- 
ing is near at hand. I know that our 
Lord and Savior Jesus Christ lives, and 
that He is the Redeemer of the world, 
and that through the shedding of His 
blood and the atonement He offered up 
for the sins of the world all mankiiTd 
may be saved through obedience to the 
laws and ordinances of the Gospel. God 
bless you, and sanctify this testimony 
to, your good, as well as all that you 
have heard and may hear during this 
conference, is my prayer in the name 
of Jesus. Amen.

I am very much pleased indeed to be 
present at this conference. I have re- 
joiced beyond my power to tell in lis- 
tening to the testimonies of those who 
have spoken thus far. I do not know 
whether I can occupy the balance of the 
time this afternoon or not. I find that 
I cannot take a long breath without 
its paining me in my lungs. Whether 
it is the change from the sea level to 



this high country I do not know. I am 
feeling very well indeed, and unless I 
try to take a long breath I am in no 
pain. I desire, however, to mingle my 
voice with the voices of my brethren, 
and to give you my testimony as to my 
knowledge of the divinity of the work 
in which we are engaged. 

As I remarked last night at the 
Priesthood meeting, I hesitated for 
some little time, after the spirit came 
upon me to attend this conference, be- 
fore writing for permission to do so. 
I thought my desires might be miscon- 
strued, and that there would perhaps 
be a feeling that I was homesick and 
desired to shirk the responsibilities 
resting upon me in a far-off land; but 
after having once thought of the idea, 
of being with you and partaking of 
the spirit of this conference, I could 
not, hard as I tried, get rid of the de- 
sire to come. I finally wrote the let- 
ter, and when it reached here permis- 
sion was given to me. Although I 
have had to travel a little over seven 
thousand miles to come to this confer- 
ence, I am glad to be here, and I was 
happy when the word came that I was 
to have this privilege. Only those who 
have been in the habit of feasting on 
the teachings of the servants of God 
under the inspiration of the Spirit of 
God from their childhood up, and have 
ever been meeting-goers, can appreci- 
ate how hungry I became to listen to 
the servants of the Lord, when I tell 
you that for eight months I did not 
have this privilege, except in the little 
council meetings held with my asso- 
ciates upon our mission in Japan. 

Knowing that the people will 
be interested to hear from that 
country and from my associates, I 
desire to say that Elders Ke'sch, En- 
sign and Taylor are well, that they are 
faithful, diligent and true men, and 
that we have been excee Singly happy 
from the time we reached our fleli of 
labor— in fact, from the time we were 
called— until my departure from that 
land. I am pleased to tell you that 
I had letters from them ye ter.'ay, 
written ten days after my derartu-e, 
and they are well. They tell me 
that the two men whom we tap ized 
and ordained Elders are meeting v, ith 
them constantly, studying very dili-

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



gently, and making memoranda to as- 
sist them in defending the principles 
of the Gospel. In one of the letters, 
Brother Ensign refers to a man by the 
name of Gaburo Kikuohi, the second 
convert, and to his exclaiming in an 
impulsive manner every once in awhile, 
"That is true, the Bible says so," as 
he is reading and studying the prin- 
ciples of the Gospel; and Brother En- 
sign, after making this remark, says, 
"Can't you hear him?" and I can al- 
most, because I know how he would 
explode, so to speak, all the time we 
were teaching him prior to his bap- 
tism. This man for a number of years 
■has separated himself from the Chris- 
tian sect to which he belonged, because, 
he said, they did not teach the Bible, 
and he has been teaching the people 
the truths of the Bible in the parks 
in the city of Tokio, having audiences 
of from 500 to 1,500 people. He seems 
to be a very sincere, determined man, 
and I have enjoyed my conversations 
with him. The day I baptized him, 
before attending to that ordinance, I 
told Brother Kelsch to try to discour- 
age him from becoming a member of 
the Church, and that I would do the 
same, because I told him I desired him 
to study more and to comprehend 
more before he was baptized. But it 
seemed that with all the words of dis- 
couragement that Brother Kelsch and 
I could utter, he was determined to 
be baptized. He came to the hotel be- 
fore I was out of bed in the morning 
and insisted upon baptism. When I 
told him that he had better study more 
and get a better comprehension of 
the Gospel, he said, "It is true, 
I believe it, I want to be baptized, and 
I can understand it better after I have 
been baptized and confirmed a member 
of the Church." I knew this was true; 
so I told him he would be persecuted, 
and he quoted the scripture, "Blessed 
are ye, when men shall revile you, and 
persecute you, and shall say all man- 
ner of evil against you, falsely, for my 
sake." Brother Kelsch and I went 
on in this line, trying to discourage 
this man. I referred to the drivings of 
our people, to the killing of the Proph- 
et Joseph Smith and his brother Hy- 
rum, and to the fact that many men 



had to give up their lives for the truth; 
and I wanted him to be thoroughly 
converted. He said, "It is true; and if 
I die and am the first martyr in Japan, 
it would be the best thing that could 
happen to Japan." "That's enough," 
I said, "I'll baptize you." 

I have the assurance in my soul that 
there is to be a wonderful work ac- 
complished in Japan; that there will be 
many, yea, even thousands of that 
people that will receive the Gospel of 
Jesus Christ. We have made no ef- 
fort whatever to try and baptize peo- 
ple. Many have come and applied for 
baptism — ten young men at one time; 
many have written us letters and asked 
to be baptized into the Church; but we 
have realized that they did not under- 
stand the Gospel, and we had no de- 
sire to baptize and seal the Holy Ghost 
upon a person who would be likely to 
lose the Spirit and turn around and 
fight the Church. We have had no 
desire whatever to baptize people just 
to make a showing. We prayed ear- 
nestly every day for the guidance of 
the Spirit of God. We fasted and 
prayed often. We had a delightful 
time. Time passed very pl^a'-antly 
and did not hang upon our hand3. I 
never spent an hour in sightseeing. I 
did make one little trip through 
the country, on the cars, to get some 
knowledge of it; but I never went away 
for the sake of seeing the sights jnd 
enjoying myself in that city. I was 
busy all the time, talking with those 
that called upon me, answering letters, 
and in studying the language. The Lord 
granteth unto men according to their 
desires, whether it be for life or death, 
joy or remorse of conscience; and the 
only desire that I had was to fulfill my 
duty in that land from day to day, and 
if I should return after three or live 
years without converting or baptizing 
one soul I would be satisfied. However, 
I have been exceedingly grateful ».o my 
Heavenly Father that He saw fit to im- 
press with His Spirit a couple of men 
who, I believe, are honest. They may 
not prove faithful, but I believe lhey 
are honest today. The other man was 
a Shinto priest, who could not speak 
a word of English, and we had to talk 
to him through an interpreter. This

man was cast out from his congregation 
of 1,500 by his superiors, and told that 
he would be reinstated in his office, 
provided he quit calling upon the 
"Mormons." He said, "I believe that 
there is some truth with them; I am 
not yet convinced, but I will not stop 
calling on them." Finally he was cast 
out. He continued to call upon us, and 
was baptized. 

In that country it is very difficult for 
a' person to earn much money. It is 
incomprehensible to me how people 
-can live and clothe themselves and ap- 
parently be well and healthy, on the 
limited amount of money that they 
make. You can hire hundreds, and 
even thousands of men that are mar- 
ried and have children, for 15 yen a 
month, which is $7.50 in our money, 
.and they will live on that amount. You 
can hire a man to carry you around in 
one of their vehicles (jinrikishas, they 
call them), and that man will work for 
you, if you buy your own vehicle, for 
15 yen a month. True, there are men 
that get 20 yen, because they are super- 
ior runners, and there are others that 
will get as high as 25, because they are 
very swift in running, but you can get 
a man that will trot along three or 
four hours at a stretch, for 15 or 20 
yen a month! He must get enough 
food to eat, or I do not think he could 
stand it. It is remarkable to me the 
industry and the frugality of that peo- 
ple, and the way they get along. I saw 
perhaps half a dozen beggars all the 
time I was there. In the crowded city 
of Tokio I never saw but two beggars 
and they were afflicted with 
leprosy, lying on the ground 
by a bridge. It is a city of 2,000,000 of 
people, and I traveled around many, 
many hours, and they were the only 
beggars I saw. The people are almost 
like bees in a hive, and they all seem 
to be busy. They are a very remark- 
able people, and I feel to say to you 
that I believe and know that God will 
do a mighty work in that land. The 
Lord has raised up friends to us. Many 
influential men have called and visited 
with me. I am told that a certain man 
there by the name of Goro Takahashi is 
by far the strongest writer in defense 
of Christianity in the nation of Japan. 
This man, before I ever met him. wrote 



an article in one of the leading maga- 
zines of Japan in which he criticized 
the newspapers and the people of 
Japan, for opposing the "Mor- 
mon" religion. My interpreter inter- 
preted this for me, and I afterwards 
read it to the man. He laughed, and 
said, "He has not interpreted my ar- 
ticle." He said, "The very first line 
says, 'The people of Tokio welcome with 
loud Huzzahs Lamanism, which is 
polyandry, or a plurality of husbands,' 
and I did not say any such a thing. I 
said, 'The enlightened people of Tokio.' 
The whole sarcasm is lost by your in- 
terpreter. It was not the common peo- 
ple, it was not the laboring people, but 
it was the enlightened people of Tokio 
that was crying out against the 'Mor- 
mon' people." I asked him if he would 
not translate the first page for me him- 
self. (I had about 10 pages of it.) He 
said he was very busy, but he would 
translate the first page, as near as I 
can remember, the first page was as 
follows: "The enlightened people of To- 
kio have recently welcomed a sect from 
Thibet that preaches Lamanism, poly- 
andry, a plurality of husbands, and 
scarce have they welcomed them with 
extraordinary enthusiasm and the huz- 
zahs died away tefore they are con- 
demning, with absolute ignorance, the 
'Mormon' religion! And these people 
who are condemning the 'Mormons' and 
polygamy are believers in concubinage! 
Can there be under the sun a greater 
inconsistency than this? We might say 
something about the emperor and his 
concubines, but perhaps it would be 
considered disloyal, and therefore we 
will keep quiet." 

This gives you a little idea of this 
man. I afterwards told my interpreter 
what he said. "Well, Mr. Grant," he 
said, "I told you that I could not in- 
terpret the article. I told you that it 
was like a rugged mountain. I told 
you it was so full of force and fire that 
I could not put it in the English lan- 
guage." The minute I read this article 
I sent the writer an invitation to come 
and dine with me at the hotel. He 
came there, and afterwards he wrote 
and said, if I would furnish him items 
of history regarding our people, he 
would gladly write a book in our de- 
fense. He said, "I feel that you are 



48 



GENERAL. CONFERENCE. 



honest, I feel that you are misunder- 
stood, I feel that the Spirit of the Lord 
has come upon me, and I want to de- 
fend you, and if you will give me the 
materials I will do it; for I feel that I 
am called to this work." I immediately 
told him that it would give me pleasure. 
I furnished him the History of Joseph 
Smith by Brother Cannon, the History 
of John Taylor by Brother Roberts, 
and A Brief History of the Church by 
Edward H. Anderson. The latter is 
published by the Juvenile Instructor, 
and does not give Brother Anderson the 
credit of being the author, but he is 
entitled to it; and if I had the ability 
to write such a work I would not let 
them publish it if they did not put my 
name upon it. I furnished him Mormon 
Doctrine by Brother Penrose, The New 
Witness for God and The Missouri Per- 
secutions by Brother Roberts, and the 
Book of Mormon. He already had the 
Book of Mormon and was pretty well 
posted on it. I also furnished him, 
among other documents, a tract by Col- 
onel Thomas, of London, that impressed 
him very much. He has written a. boos 
of some 200 or more pages, about the 
size of the Improvement Era. He has 
illustrated it with pictures from the 
little pamphlet entitled "In and 
Around Salt Lake City." Th u-e 
is a picture there of the five 
presidents of the Church, also of the 
Temple block, a view of Salt Lake City, 
of Saltair, of the Salt Palace, and of 
some Indians, with their children on 
their backs— exactly the same as the 
Japanese. And, by the way, there is 
a wonderful resemblance between the 
American Indian and many of the 
Japanese. The pictures of Prest. Smith, 
of my family, and of some others will 
be published in this book. He says that 
these pictures will dispel at a glance 
the popular idea that the "Mormons" 
are an ignorant and degraded people. 
He has put in a picture of the Lehi 
sugar factory, and he was wonderfully 
impressed with what our people had ac- 
complished in a material way. He said, 
"I may, of course, make a mistake in 
some of your doctrinal items. I would 
not like to do that. I may make a 
mistake in some of your historical 
items. I would not like to do that, 
either; and I shall submit to you the 



doctrinal and historical items before I 
publish my book." I invited him to 
dinner regularly every Sunday for about 
two months, and afterwards he said 
he did not wish to show me anything 
in the book, because, he said, "people 
will say you told me what to write, 
and it will not do you the good I want 
it to do. I am writing in your favor, 
and I know you will be pleased with 
the book." He had read all Dr. Tal- 
mage's articles published in the Era on 
the "History and Philosophy of Mor- 
monism," and he said that if he quoted 
the doctrinal and historical items from 
what I have given him he could not 
make any mistake, and that was what 
he had done. 

I am sorry I did not bring with me 
the contents of that book. It will con- 
tain 10 chapters, and the first is entitled 
"The Greatest Problem of the World." 
This will give you* some idea of what 
the man thinks. In the article he 
wrote about the "Mormons" before I 
ever met him, he wound it up by say- 
ing, "I will ask some questions. Was 
Joseph Smith a deceitful hero, who de- 
ceived the world, and was punished by 
the Almighty for his wickedness? Or 
was he, like Jesus Christ, a martyr for 
the truths of heaven?" I believe 
that this man became convinced that 
Joseph Smith was a martyr. Here is 
a list of the headings of the ten chap- 
ters :' 

Chapter I. The Greatest Problem in 
the World. 

Chapterll. Mormonism — What is it? 
Early History of Joseph Smith. 

Chapter III. The Book of Mormon, 
and American Antiquities; Archaeolo- 
gy and Comparative Philology. 

Chapter IV. The Spaulding Story, and 
ether Stories. 

Chapter V. Exodus — Miracles— Chosen 
People. 

Chapter VI. Phoenix-like, risen out 
of the ashes. 

Chapter VII. Loyal or Disloyal. 

Chapter VIII. Polygamy. What is; 
it? 

Chapter IX. Social Conditions. Social 
Christianity without running into Com- 
munism. 

Chapter X. Success and Prosperity 
Religious and Commercial.

Not one word that is in this book 
have I suggested; but I believe that 1 
could not possibly pick out ten chap- 
ters and arranged them any better than 
this man has done. He is a highly 
educated man. He translated five- 
sevenths of the Bible into the Japan- 
ese language when it was done. He 
speaks the English language well; he 
speaks the Hebrew language, he under- 
stands some Egyptian, and he reads 
the French. He has a two-story fire- 
proof building adjoining his dwelling, 
full of books, where he studies. I have 
always looked upon Orson Pratt as the 
great student of the Latter-day Saints, 
and I remarked to my brethren that 
Goro Takahashi was the Orson Pratt 
of the Japanese nation. I feel that 
God touched this man's heart.and made 
him friendly towards us; and he has 
written a book that I believe will do 
us a world of good. I remarked to 
him that I would like him to translate 
it into the English language and send 
it . to me, and I would publish it at 
home, with the same illustrations, so 
that the people could see what he had 
written; that I knew it would have a 
good sale at home, and it would give 
me delight to let him have any profits 
that there might be. I told him that I 
realized it would take him a long time 
to translate it into the English lan- 
guage, because he would not write as 
rapidly in our language as he 
could in his own. "You are 
very much mistaken," he said; it 
won't take me very long, because 
there are so many exact quotations 
from the pamphlets and books you 
gave me. I have translated them into 
the Japanese language verbatim; there- 
fore it wont be difficult to put them 
back into English." I feel that this 
man was raised up of God to do this, 
and although he may have made some 
mistakes I believe his book will do us a 
great deal of good. 

I rejoice to be here. I rejoice in the 
testimony of the Gospbl of Jesus Christ. 
I rejoice in the increased testimony 
that my mission has given me. I never 
expected that it would be possible for a 



man of my temperament and disposi- 
tion, who from a boy of 14 years of age 
has been actively engaged in business, 
to forget it, and that I could content 
myself in a foreign land studying a 
language that put me to sleep nearly 
every time I tried it, and yet be happy. 
But I was. There was the sweet Spirit 
of God with us, and many times in 
our little meetings we shed tears of joy, 
because of the outflow of the Spirit of 
God. If I had the privilege of picking 
the Church ever for three companions 
I could not be better satisfied than 
with those that I have. I had my 
choice, and I have not been disappoint- 
ed. I say to you, my friends, that I 
am happy to be here. All of the offi- 
cers that have been chosen during my 
absence, my head and my heart have 
been pleased and satisfied with. It is 
a sorrow to me to come home and not 
receive the handshake of my beloved 
President Snow, whom I loved as dear- 
ly as life itself; but I rejoice that the 
son of one of the two mar- 
tyrs for the cause presides 
over the Church of Christ. I 
rejoice in the knowledge that the work 
of God is onward and upward, and that 
each and every one of us who are true 
and faithful will be saved. I rejoice 
that this Gospel is going to all the na- 
tions of the earth. I rejoice in being 
a messenger of the plan of life and sal- 
vation. God has blessed me with a 
knowledge. I know that He lives. I 
know that Jesus is the Christ. I know 
that Joseph Smith is a prophet 
of God. I know that I shall live for- 
ever, and that if I am faithful I shall 
be exalted. I know that this same 
blessing will come to all of you, if you 
are faithful; and that you may be, 
and obtain the blessing, is my prayer, 
and I ask it in the name of Jesus. 
Amen. 

The choir and congregation sang: 

Now let us rejoice in the day of sal- 
vation, 

No longer as strangers on earth need 
we roam. 

Benediction by Elder Byron Ses- 
sions. 



THIRD DAY. 



OVERFLOW MEETING. 
April 6th, 10 a. m. 

ASSEMBLY HALL. 

The Tabernacle being inadequate to 
accommodate the immense concourse 
of pople in attendance, an overflow 
meeting was held, at which Elder Heber 
J. Grant presided. 

The Temple choir sang: 

Guide us, O Thou great Jehovah. 

Prayer by Elder John T. Caine. , 

Singing by the choir and congrega- 
tion: 

How firm a foundation, ye Saints of the 
Lord, 

Is laid for your faith in His excellent 
word. 

ELDER CHAS. W. PENROSE. 

It is a great pleasure to be permitted 
to assemble with the Saints in this 
general conference. During the meet- 
ings that have been held in the Taber- 
nacle, anci this morning, in looking up- 
on this congregation, I was reminded of 
a revelation, given through the Prophet 
Joseph Smith before the organization of 
the Church, which was alluded to by 
one of the speakers during our services 
in the Tabernacle. The Lord said that 
a grear and marvelous work was 
about to come forth among the children 
of men. This thought is also conveyed 
in the Book of Mormon, and was tak- 
en fron the prophecy delivered through 
the Prophet Isaiah many hundreds of 
years ago. You will find it in the 29th 
chapter of the book of Isaiah. The 
Lord gave one of the reasons for the 
corning forth of this marvelous work. 
He said. "Forasmuch as this people 
draw v.oar me with their mouth, and 
with their lips do honor me, but have 
removed their heart far from me, and 
their fear toward me is taught by the 
precepts of men: Therefore, behold, I 
will proceed to do a marvelous work 
among this people, even a marvelous 



work and a wonder; for the wisdom of 
their wise men shall perish, and the un- 
derstanding of their prudent men shall 
be hid." But the Lord said that the 
meek among men should rejoice in the 
Lord, and the poor among men should 
increase their joy in the Holy One of 
Israel; but that the scorner should be 
brought to nought. The eyes of the 
blind were also to be opened and the 
ears of the- deaf unstopped, and they 
should hear the words of the book that 
was to be brought forth; for the word 
of the Lord was to come out of the 
ground, and to speak, as it were, "low 
out of the dust." 

Now we are witnessing the fulfil- 
ment, to a very large extent, of these 
predictions of the Prophets of the 
Lord. This work with which we 
are associated is indeed a marvel- 
ous work and a wonder. When we 
look upon the people assembled in the 
Tabernacle and at this overflow meet- 
ing, and realize that we who are gath- 
ered here are but a small representation 
of the Church of Jesus Christ of Lat- 
ter-day Saints, which forms the ma- 
jority of the people of this region— when 
we realize this, we are led to exclaim, 
"What hath God wrought!" It was "a 
marvelous work and a wonder" when 
the Book of Mormon was translated 
by the power of God into the Eng- 
lish language, from the hieroglyphics 
made on the metallic plates. Nothing 
of the kind had ever occurred, so far 
as we are aware, in the history of the 
world. In all the developments of sci- 
ence and in all the gifts and blessings 
which God bestowed upon His servants 
in ancient times, I do not know of any- 
thing to compare with the marvelous 
work and wonder oi bringing forth 
those plates and translating the char- 
acters which were upon them. It is so 
marvelous and wonderful that the' peo- 
ple of the world will not believe it. 
But we, my brethren and sisters have 
been led to believe in the truth of this 
book which the Lord has given us in

the last days. Through our faith in 
the word of the Lord and the testi- 
monies that have been borne unto us we 
have been led to receive the Gospel as 
taught in that book and in the New 
Testament, through the labors of the 
servants of God in the latter days. We 
have also received the Holy Ghost as a 
gift from God to us, to enlighten our 
minds, to lead and guide us in the ways 
of truth, and to bear witness to us con- 
cerning every truth that the Lord has 
revealed, that He is revealing and that 
He will yet reveal. Through this glori- 
ous gift which the Lord has given us 
our minds have been led upward from 
the things of earth to comprehend, in 
some degree, the things of heaven— 
from the things of time to those of eter- 
nity. 

In contemplating that which God has 
already accomplished in this marvelous 
work that He has commenced on the 
earth, we can look forward to that 
which is to be. The Gospel is to be 
preached to every nation, kindred, ton- 
gue and people. The nations that sit 
in darkness are to see the marvelous 
light. The people that know not God 
are to be brought into such a condition 
that they can learn of His laws, walk 
in His ways and keep His command- 
ments, and the barriers that have been 
builded up by the powers of dark- 
ness, through the craft of men, will 
be broken down, in the due time of the 
Lord. They will be removed from the 
way, and this Gospel of peace, this 
marvelous work that God has com- 
menced in the earth, will spread over 
all the globe, and there "will not be a 
corner of this earth wherein the Gos- 
pel will not be preached. Now, this 
lies in the future, but the Lord will 
accomplish it. This is part of the work 
that He said He was about to bring 
forth among the children of men. 

The preaching of the Gospel by the 
Elders of this Church is a marvelous 
work. Where will you find among the 
differing religions a man like the El- 
ders of Israel, who is willing to go to 
any part of the world, without money 
and without price, who is willing to 
sacrifice all the temporal comforts of 
home and its surroundings and carry 
the message of life and salvation to his 
fellow-creatures? It is marvelous in 



the eyes of the preachers of the vari- 
ous Christian sects. They can scarcely 
believe or comprehend it. When they 
see how our boys, without training, go 
out in the world, and face an opposing 
people, the traditions of men and the 
influences and powers that are against 
them, trusting wholly in God, and 
preaching the Gospel without purse or 
scrip, they are amazed and confound- 
ed. It is something marvelous, some- 
thing unique in the world's history, 
aside from the labors of the Apostles 
of the Lord Jesus Christ and their as- 
sociates in the early days of the Chris- 
tian Church. The fact that many people 
of the nations of the earth, wherever 
this Gospel is proclaimed, bear testi- 
mony that they receive a witness from 
God concerning its divinity, is marvel- 
ous. It matters not where those men or 
women were born, or what their tradi- 
tions or language may have been, when 
the light of the Gospel, through the 
testimony of the humble servants of 
God, penetrates their souls they are 
brought to a unity of the faith. When 
they come together they may not be 
able to understand each other's lan- 
guages, but they understand the spirit 
that permeates their minds, and under- 
stand the influences by which they are 
led, and rejoice together. The same 
light is in all their souls, the same 
warmth in all their hearts, and they 
can fraternize and feel that they are 
brothers and sisters in very deed. 

It is a marvel when we look 
at it naturally, to behold how 
this influence spreads throughout 
the whole Church, to see what a bond 
of union is formed by the power of the 
spirit and teachings of the Gospel. 
When we come to think how the way 
has been opened up for the people who 
have been brought from the various 
nations of the earth to these moun- 
tain \ales, is it not wonderful? Most 
of them were raised in what ar-> called 
the lower ranks of society. I do not 
mean the lowest classes, or the crimi- 
nal element of society, but the working 
people, the bone and sinew of the na- 
tions of the earth. Most of the people 
who have come up here in- 
to these mountain vales were 
not from among what is called 
the upper classes, the learned.

and wise after the wisdom of this 
world, but were from among the plod- 
ding class. The Gospel has reached 
them and the Lord, in a marvelous 
manner, has opened the way whereby 
they might gather here in these moun- 
tains by tht thousands. They have 
come away out here, across the bleak 
and barren plains, up into these moun- 
tain vales, to worship the Lord, to 
learn of His ways and walk in His 
paths. This was also predicted by the 
Frophets ls--aiah and Micah. Is it not 
marvelous in our eyes, when we think 
of what God hath wrought, bringing 
these people from afar, from the north 
and from the south, from the east and 
frjm the west? He has said "to the 
north give up, and to the south keep 
not back. Bring my sons from far 
£n-i my daughters from the ends of 
the earth." They are gathered here, 
and wp see them spreading out over the 
face of the land, and still they say, 
"Give us rcom that we may dwell." 
They are overflowing into Canada on 
the north, and away down into Mexico, 
Arizona and New Mexico, on the south, 
and into Colorado, Idaho and Wyoming. 
We are spreading out, and the influ- 
ence that we carry is a marvel in the 
eyes of the world, and many are warn- 
ing the people against "the menace of 
Mormonism," the peril that is to come 
to the nation because of the wonderful 
increase of the Latter-day Saints, or 
"Mormons." 

Some years ago President Brigham 
Young sent missionaries to China, 
Siam and the East Indies. The breth- 
ren accomplished but little in 
Siam and China, but a few 
converts were made in India, 
and some of them came here to these 
mountains. We might think the trip 
was a failure, on the .whole. Some- 
times, when people go into a new coun- 
try to found settlements they make big 
mistakes in the beginning. They 
flounder away and have a hard time, 
and sometimes forsake the spot where 
they were sent to live; but, in most 
instances, they go ahead, and, after a 
little experience, the way is opened 
up before them, the barrenness is taken 
from the soil, the elements become pro- 
pitious, the water is increased, and the 
blessing of God comes upon the land, 



and flourishing settlements are built 
up. When the Lord, through His serv- 
ant Brigham Young, sent men into 
Arizona, on the first expedition, they 
did not succeed in founding any settle- 
ments, but returned and gave a bad 
report of the land. But Prest. Young 
had seen it by the power and gift of 
the Holy Ghost, and knew the way was 
to be opened up in that southern coun- 
try; so he did not give up. When at 
first they did not succeed he was de- 
termined that they should try, try 
again. Now we learn that settlements 
are flourishing in Arizona, New Mexico 
and Old Mexico, and we have a good 
representation of Saints from that 
country attending this conference. Even 
so the Lord moved upon His servant 
Brigham to send missionaries to the 
Orient. If their mission accomplished 
no great good, it did, at least, help to 
prepare the way, in a small degree; 
and now, the servants of the Lord, 
Apostle Heber J. Grant and his associ- 
ates, through God's assistance, have 
been successful in opening up the work 
in the Japanese empire, and persons 
have been brought to a knowledge of 
the truth, and others are enquiring. We 
shall find, I believe with all my heart, 
that the opening of the Japanese mis- 
sion will prove the key to the entrance 
of the Gospel in the Orient. We will 
find that an influence will go out from 
Japan into other oriental nations. The 
ice has been broken, and the barriers 
will be removed from the way, and the 
Gospel will spread into other eastern 
nations. If we only succeed in getting 
a few converts, who can open the door 
of the kingdom for their ancestors in 
the spirit world, what a wonderful 
work will be accomplished! 

When the Prophet Joseph and his 
brother Hyrum were slain for the testi- 
mony of Jesus it was in the 
providence of God; it was with His 
permission. They went to open the 
door of the kingdom in the spirit world, 
and thus a marvelous work and a won- 
der has begun there also. When we 
get there we will find out the magni- 
tude of it; for we will see that the El- 
ders of Zion who have tabernacled in 
the flesh are laboring there, under the 
direction of him who holds the keys of 
the last dispensation, and the Gospel

is being preached to millions upon mil- 
lions of spirits, and a far greater work 
is to toe accomplished there than among 
men in the flesh. We have but just be- 
gun the work here, for there are many 
millions upon the earth that have not 
heard the Gospel, and know nothing of 
this marvelous work and wonder; but 
they will yet hear the Gospel message, 
and the way will be opened everywhere 
and the purposes of the Lord will be 
accomplished. 

The great thing for us, my brethren 
and sisters, is to know, to have a full 
understanding, a firm conviction and 
real knowledge that this is God's work, 
and that it is not the work of man. "We 
can reason this out when we look at 
what has been accomplished, and can 
reasonably come to the understanding 
and conviction that a superior Power 
has been at work with this people, with 
the Elders of this Church and with our 
leaders, and that it has not been done 
by human wisdom. Human wi;dom 
has perished before this work; the un- 
derstanding of the wise has come to 
naught before it, and we can reason- 
ably come to the conclusion that a 
stronger Power must have been at the 
head of this work to accomplish what 
has been done, in the inspired preach- 
ing of the Gospel; the gathering of 
God's people, the building up of Zion 
and the establishment of this great 
State. There is also an influence of 
oneness and union among the Latter- 
day Saints that cannot be found any- 
where else. The sects and societies 
have great gatherings in different parts 
of the world — religious gatherings, po- 
litical gatherings, scientific Gatherings 
and educational assemblies — but where 
will you find among any of them such 
a spirit of union, brotherhood and 'En- 
thusiasm as is found in the gatherings 
of the Latter-day Saints? There is a 
kind of enthusiasm among the people 
of the world in their religious revivals. 
They get spiritually intoxicated and 
sometimes indulge in various 
spiritual gymnastics. but ' what 
does it amount to? There is no light 
or intelligence in it; it is merely a feel- 
ing worked up by human oratory and 
energy. Where do we find that spirit 
and influence that are experienced in our 
gatherings? Look at the great con- 



gregation in the Tabernacle and in this 
building today! Where can you find 
such an exhibition of union and spirit- 
ual light and enthusiasm as we feel 
and experience here in these assem- 
blies? There is nothing like it in. the 
world. Well, reviewing these matters, 
we may come to the conclusion that 
there is something more than human 
about it, a Power greater than- that of 
man. But, my brethren and sisters, we 
need something greater than these con- 
clusions as a foundation upon which to 
build. We need the testimony of Jesus, 
the Spirit of prophecy, the witness of 
the Holy Ghost in our hearts; not only 
a reasonable conviction, but a knowl- 
edge of the truth, and it is our privi- 
lege to have this. 

All those who have repented of their 
sins and been baptized in water, by im- 
mersion, by one having authority, are 
entitled to receive the Holy Ghost, as 
a gift from God, to enlighten their 
minds and to bear witness of the things 
of God, and to open up a channel of 
communication -between them and the 
Eternal Father, through Jesus Christ, 
the Son. Now, have we that blessing, 
you and I? If we have not we should 
get it; we can all have it. There is 
nothing in the way but ourselves. God 
has promised the gift to us, and if we 
have not received it let us seek for it. 
We need not look for some wonderful 
spiritual exhibition of power, some- 
thing different from the ordinary. 
What we should look for is the light to 
our souls; that we may know that it 
shines in our hearts, so that we have no 
dubiety in this thing. It is our priv- 
ilege to have this. I hope you all have 
it this morning. I am very thankful 
that I have received it, and have had it 
for a great many years. I received it 
when I received the Gospel; it began 
to glimmer in my soul when I first 
heard the truth. I had a place for it in 
my heart when I was a boy. No One 
else belonging to the family I was con- 
nected with received it. When I obeyed 
the Gospel and was baptized I received 
the gift of the Holy Ghost, a witness 
from God that this work is true; and 
I am very thankful this morn- 
ing that it has always been with me 
from that time until the present. I 
have been in this Church a little over 



4 



GENERAL, CONFERENCE. 



fifty-two years, and was called, shortly 
after embracing the Gospel, to go and 
preach the glad tidings to the world. O 
how glad I am that I responded to 
that call, in spite of all the discourage- 
ment and influence brought to bear 
upon me not to do so! The Lord has 
been with me from that time until now. 
It is marvelous in my eyes, "A mar- 
velous work and a wonder," and I can 
bear my testimony to you, my breth- 
ren and sisters, that I do know that 
this is the work of God. This is the 
work of the Father, and, of course, 
it is the work of the Son and of the 
Holy Ghost; for they three are one in 
all things — not one in person, but one 
in purpose, and their efforts are for the 
uplifting of the children of men, not 
only on this litle globe, but on others 
also; but we will confine ourselves to 
this glebe, for it is ours and will be in 
the future. I know that God has com- 
mence! the great latter-day work and 
will cause it to continue to grow and 
spread until it fills the whole earth. It 
will never be overcome. 

One thing we should have inscribed 
on our memories in conection with 
this knowledge is, that when the Lord 
commenced this work He commenced it 
"for the last days and for the last time." 
It will not be thrown down or given to 
another people. It is to endure and 
abide forever, and, instead of being 
overcome by the things of this world, it 
is to overcome them. My brethren and 
sisters, it will conquer, it. will endure. 
It matters not what may be brought 
against it, it will prevail; for it is the 
work of the Lord, and it is "a marvel- 
ous work and a wonder." Let us not 
turn to the right or to the left 
through the influences of that Evil 
One, who deceives the nations. Many 
people will fail; many persons will 
turn aside, and they will endeavor to 
lead others astray. But this work will 
continue onward, and it will overcome 
everything that arises in its path; it 
will revolutionize the world. It will 
turn things upsidedown, or rather 
rightsideup, for they have been turned 
upsidedown already. This work will 
rectify the evils that exist in the world. 
But, before that is accomplished we 
must rectify every evil among our- 
selves. If there is anything in 



our hearts that is contrary to the 
word of the Lord, let us eradi- 
cate it; let us pull the weeds from 
our own gardens and remove every 
root of selfishness, every seed of bitter- 
ness and everything that is not good, 
and live together, as brethren and sis- 
ters, as the Lord has commanded, in 
love and humility, and in obedience to 
His laws and commandments. Let us 
attend to the little duties as well as 
the big duties. They are all big enough 
when we understand them properly. 
Let us attend to every duty in the Gos- 
pel and live according to the laws of 
God, and the testimony of the truth 
will abide with us forever. 

Now, I rejoice in what has been 
done, and I can see a great deal that 
will be done; but I will not take time 
to enter upon such a subject as that, 
as there are others to speak, and I will 
bring my remarks to a close. 

Brethren and sisters, I am with this 
work with all that I have and am, and 
I am in it for "keeps." I want to be 
with this people and labor for the 
cause of humanity, for I know that this 
is God's work and that it will prevail. 
I know this Gospel will go to every na- 
tion, and that the Lord will gather 
from the nations His sons and daugh- 
ters, to labor in His cause, that His 
work may be perfected in the redemp- 
tion of the human race, both the liv- 
ing and the dead. It will not be ful- 
filled until every soul of Adam's race 
that can be redeemed in some degree 
of glory is saved. The Captain of our 
salvation will overcome, and the Ad- 
versary of our souls will eventually be 
discomfited, and will gain none but 
those who are called the sons of perdi- 
tion. 

May God help us to understand the 
truth and to labor in this great work 
for the salvation of mankind, with all 
our hearts, that we may never falter 
or fail, but finally be prepared to go 
into the presence of the Lord and in- 
herit a fulness of glory in His kingdom, 
through Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER JOSEPH W. McMURRIN. 

I have rejoiced, my brethren and sis- 
ters, in the testimony and remarks of 
Elder Penrose. I wondered, when he

bore record that he was in this work 
with all that he had and was, and that 
he was in it for "keeps," whether or 
not there was that same feeling and 
testimony in the hearts of all present 
here this morning. We should all be 
in this work with all that we possess. 
It is a very great mistake to become 
associated with the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints and be pos- 
sessed of anything that is not in the 
work of the Lord that we do not hold 
in readiness to be used for the estab- 
lishment of the purposes of our Father. 
I hope that we have this testimony, 
and that we feel in our hearts that, 
with the assistance of God, we will be 
true and faithful to the covenants we 
have made, and that we will always 
be found under the direction of the au- 
thority that God has placed upon the 
earth,, laboring faithfully for the estab- 
lishment of His holy purposes. 

I feel in my heart to bear record to 
the fulfillment of the scripture referred 
to by Brother Penrose, concerning the 
marvelous character of the work that 
has been established on the earth by 
the Lord, through the Prophet Joseph 
Smith. In looking over this congrega- 
tion, the thought came to me that 
there were, perhaps, quite a number of 
men and women here who were born 
before the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints was established. Such 
men and women have, within the span 
of their own lives, witnessed the won- 
derful growth of the Church estab- 
lished in 1830 by the Prophet. They are 
witnesses to the fulfillment of Joseph 
Smith's predictions, and must know 
from their own experience and obser- 
vation, that Joseph Smith was an in- 
spired man. The Prophet Joseph Smith, 
as has already been announced, in the 
very inception of this work, before its 
organization had been effected, made 
the announcement, more than once — for 
God had given him revelations, respect- 
ing this — that a marvelous work was 
about to go forth among the children 
of men. I wonder if it is possible for 
any one here present, who has f*-^ted of 
the inspiration of the Holy host, to 
look upon the condition that now pre- 
vails, the great work that has already 
been accomplished, and not say the 



words of the Prophet have been ful- 
filled. 

In 1842, the Prophet Joseph Smith de- 
clared that there was a time 
coming when the people of the 
Lord should go up into the 
Rocky Mountains, and he also made the 
prediction, at that time, that many of 
the Saints who were then living should 
live to see the people gather in this 
land, which was then a desolate bar- 
ren waste; and become a great and 
mighty commonwealth. Who is there 
in this congregation, or among the 
people of the Latter-day Saints, who 
is lit up by the inspiration of heaven, 
who cannot see, in this wonderful 
growth and in the development that is 
still taking place, that the word of the 
Lord has not failed? Who is so callous 
in his fellings that he cannot say, with 
all his heart, that the power and in- 
spiration of the Almighty will not 
fail? Who can doubt that there will 
be still greater developments and' still 
greater things brought to pass, under 
the direction of the Priesthood of the 
Almighty, than that which has already 
been accomplished in the history of the 
Church? That which has been accom- 
plished is truly marvelous. The future, 
however, must be full of remarkable 
events, for it is the decree of God, that 
this work of the latter days shall forge 
to the front, and be more marvelous 
than all preceding dispensations. I beg 
of you, my brethren and sisters, to bear 
in mind the solemn fact that the same 
divine authority, the same inspiration 
that came from God, our Father, which 
enabled the Prophet Joseph Smith to 
speak of the future history of this 
work, is with the Israel of God today. 
A Prophet of God stands in the midst 
of the people now, clothed upon with 
every gift, key, power, and authority, 
that was given to the Prophet Joseph 
Smith, and that same inspiration, that 
same power to penetrate the future, to 
comprehend the purposes of the Al- 
mighty, is with the Priesthood that is 
in our midst today. We should honor 
that Priesthood; we should be true in 
our feelings to the authority that God 
has placed upon the earth, and feel in 
our hearts that we will sustain it, and 
that we will stand under the arms of 



56 



GENERAL CONFERENCE, 



the men who preside over us, and hold 
up their hands, that all may be accom- 
plished that God has promised. There 
should be no questioning- of the wis- 
dom of the counsel that is imparted by 
the servants of the Lord; but, rather, 
we should look back over the history 
of this people and endeavor to under- 
stand what has been accomplished un- 
der the direction of this authority, and 
when we comprehend the marvelous 
character of that history, we will feel 
in our hearts to trust the God of 
heaven, and in trusting our Father in 
heaven, we honor His Priesthood on 
earth, and faithfully strive to carry 
out the counsel of that Priesthood. 

I have thought, my brethren and sis- 
ters, that I would like to offer a few 
words upon a matter that I feel is of 
very great importance in the midst of 
the Latter-day Saints. I have felt the 
importance of this subject greatly, and 
this feeling has been increased within 
me during our meetings because of the 
trend of the counsel that has been giv- 
en by most of the speakers at this con- 
ference. Nearly all of the brethren 
have referred to the great necessity 
that exists for the Latter-day Saints 
to give special care to the rising gen- 
eration. The announcement was made, 
not long ago, in a convention of minis- 
ters held in this city, that nothing 
could be done with the aged Mormons, 
and that they were to seek after the 
children and try to impress upon the 
minds of the youth of the community 
that the religion of the Latter-day 
Saints was false. There are many 
persons already scattered around 
among our people, who are not looked 
upon as ministers or missionaries, who 
are exerting an influence, as far as 
they can, over the youth of the Lat- 
ter-day Saints, to poison their minds, 
in order to win them from the faith, 
and, I suppose, many parents have ob- 
served it. It is very necessary that 
there be an influence on the part of 
parents and officers in the Church to 
counteract those influences that are at 
work among the youth. 

An organization has been established 
in the Church known as the Religion 
class, but, I am sorry to say, there is a 
lack of interest on the part of many 
of the people in relation to the Religion 



classes of the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints. Sometimes Bishops 
question it; sometimes Stake presidents 
question it. Occasionally some of these 
men and others in authority 
in the Church, stand up in 
opposition to that which has 
been established by the Council 
of the Apostles and of the Presidency 
of the Church, and say there is no room 
for this organization. I want to say to 
this congregation that it is the duty of 
fathers and mothers, and of all Church 
officers to lend an influence in favor of 
Religion classes. The Bishopric of 
every ward, with the Sunday school su- 
perintendent of the ward, constitute a 
board of education in each ward, and 
they should seek to build up and sus- 
tain these classes. This Religion, class 
movement is a part of the Church edu- 
cational system. It is under the direc- 
tion of the Presidency of the Church, 
and one of the First Presidency, An- 
thon H. Lund, is the general superin- 
tendent of the religion classes of the 
Church, and Apostle Rudger Clawson 
and J. M. Tanner the superintendent 
of Church schools, are his assistants, 
and it is the duty of the stake and 
ward authorities, as well as the parents, 
to give their support to this movement 
in all the wards of the stakes of Zion. 
The aim and object of the organization 
is the blessing and salvation of the 
rising generation. I was sent, a few 
days ago, to examine a class of mis- 
sionaries in one of our Church schools. 
Questions were asked of forty young 
men, concerning their understanding of 
the principles of the Gospel, and I 
made the discovery that, in almost 
every instance, those young men were 
graduates of public schools, high 
schools, colleges and universities; but, 
in almost every case, they made the 
announcement that all the study that 
they had given to the Gospel had been 
while attending their missionary class. 
They were graduates in other branches 
of learning, but were in the primary 
department, to a considerable extent, 
so far as a knowledge of the Gospel was 
concerned. If these young men had at- 
tended a religion class during the time 
they were going to school, instead of 
being without an understanding of the 
Gospel, they would have been just as

full of knowledge concerning- the pur- 
poses of the Almighty, as they were of 
other matters to which they had giv- 
en attention. Latter-day Saints should 
guard against stuffing their children 
with worldly learning, and leaving 
them without faith in God. Let us 
educate our children in art, science 
and literature, but above all else in a 
knowledge of God. Remembering that 
to know God and Jesus Christ is life 
eternal. The religion classes are to be 
feeders to our Church schools, as well 
as to our missionary fields, and all the 
other organizations in the Church, and 
they are a necessity in the midst of the 
people. Every father and mother, it 
seems to me, ought to know this. We 
should not hesitate to ask the school 
trustees, those men appointed by the 
people to manage the educational af- 
fairs of the ward, for the use of the 
public school buildings, which have 
been erected mainly by the means of 
the l atter-day Saints, for holding our 
religion classes. We have a perfect 
right to ask for the use of these build- 
ir.gs for half an hour or an hour, as the 
case may be, once or twice a week, or 
oftener, if necessary, for the purpose 
of religious instruction, which, of 
course, is to be in no way connected 
with the general work of the school. 
We should also be perfectly willing for 
the Catholics, Presbyterians, or any 
other religious denomination, to have 
the use of these school buildings to 
instruct their children in their religion, 
should they desire to do so. The school 
teachers, those of them who belong to 
the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Scints, and who are filled with zeal 
for the Gospel, should also be pressed 
into service, to act as teachers in the 
religion classes, and to instruct the 
children in the principles of the Gospel 
after school is dismissed, and before 
the children leave the schoolroom, as 
it will be almost impossible to get them 
back after they have once left the 
building. 

I thought I would like to say these 
few words in favor of the religion 
classes of the Church, and if a few 
men and women go from this meeting 
to their homes throughout the var- 
ious stakes of Zion, with a determina- 
tion to foster and encourage and build 
up religion classes, I will feel very 



thankful. God bless you, in the name 
of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER RTJLON S. WELLS. 

My brethren and sisters, I rejoice 
in the opportunity of standing before 
you here this morning, and I also feel 
in my heart to endorse the excellent 
remarks that have been made by the 
brethren who have just addressed you. 

I, too, like Brother Penrose, feel that 
I have come into this work for "keeps," 
and I propose to devote my talents irt 
helping to establish the kingdom of 
God upon tlje earth. I rejoice in the 
testimony of the truth, and in the mag- 
nitude of this great and marvelous 
w-ork which our Father in heaven has 
set his hand to do in the day and age 
in which we live. Of all the things yet 
to be accomplished in connection with 
this great work, nothing has been re- 
ferred to that is greater, to my mind, 
than the one referred to by Brother 
Penrose, when he spoke about the work 
that was to be accomplished with us 
as individuals — the purification of our 
.own selves. If this work will accom- 
plish the purification of the Latter- 
day Saints and cause them to be bet- 
ter men and women and cause them to 
advance and grow in the knowledge of 
the things of God, what a great and 
marvelous work it is in very deed. 

During the few moments I shall stand 
before you, I wish to call your atten- 
tion to one particular thing, whereby 
the Latter-day Saints and their chil- 
dren can become better men and wo- 
men. If we were to labor for years and 
accomplished nothing else, what a 
great and glorious thing it would be. 
That one thing to which I refer is 
the keeping of one of the command- 
ments which the Lord thundered down 
from Mount Sinai in the days 
of ancient Israel, when it was written 
upon those tablets of stone, "Thou 
shalt not take the name of the Lord 
thy God in vain; for the Lord will not 
hold him guiltless that taketh His name 
in vain." In my own observations, both 
here at home and in the various set- 
tlements in the different Stakes of 
Zion, in fact, almost every place, I have 
heard, in a greater or less degree, the 
name of the Lord is being profaned by 
the rising generation, and, sometimes,.

GENERAL, CONFERENCE. 



by those who have advanced in years, 
who are old enough to know better. I 
wish to emphasize with all the stress I 
am capable of the necessity of the Lat- 
ter-day Saints overcoming this evil. 
Many have not a sufficient reverence, 
for the things of the Lord and in using 
the names of Deity. We ought to cul- 
tivate reverence among us, and when- 
ever the name of the Lord is taken up- 
on cur lips it should be done in rever- 
ence and respect. We ought to remem- 
ber that He is our Creator, that He 
is the Father of everyone of us, the 
Creator of the heavens and the earth, 
and all things that in them are. We 
ought to remember that He has com- 
manded us that we should not take 
His name in vain. I do not wish this 
congregation to become impressed with 
the thought, for a moment, that this 
people is given to swearing more than 
any other people; but I wish to say 
this: That the people in these west- 
ern states, in the midst of these moun- 
tain districts and throughout the min- 
ing districts of this intermountain 
country, especially, use more profanity 
than is used in the more thickly set- 
tled portions of our country. In my 
travels in foreign countries I have nev- 
er heard so much profanity as I have 
heard right here in Zion. I do not 
mean to say that it is the Latter-day 
Saints themselves that are given more 
particularly to profanity: but, on the 
contrary, I wish to say that it is more 
frequently heard among those that 
have not received the Gospel. Neverthe- 
less, too much profanity is used among 
the Latter-day Saints also. We, as a 
people, have entered into covenants 
with the Lord, have exercised faith in 
Him, have repented of our sins and 
have gone down into the waters of 
baptism, and for what purpose? That 
we might obtain a remission of 
sins, that we might be forgiven 
for all things that we may. have done 
that was displeasing in the sight of 
God, that when we are summoned be- 
fore the Great Judge of all we might 
stand faultless before Him. I want to 
bear testimony here today that it does 
not matter how many times we may 
have repented and been baptized, or 
whether we have been baptized at all, 
for when the time shall come, and we 



are brought up before the judgment bar 
of God, if we have indulged in the hab- 
it of profaning His holy name — I want 
to bear testimony that we will not be 
found guiltless when we stand before 
the judgment seat. That was the way it 
was thundered down in the time of an- 
cient Israel, and delivered to that peo- 
ple, through the Prophet Moses, and 
this commandment is equally binding 
upon the Latter-day Saints, for it has 
not been done away with. Therefore, 
if we want to stand spotless before the 
throne of God, we must eradicate this 
evil from our midst and exercise all our 
power and influence to do so, that it 
may no longer be said, as some de- 
clare, that the Latter-day Saints are 
not reverential in using the names, of 
Deity. 

Brethren and sisters, a reformation 
in this respect is very needful among 
the Latter-day Saints, and if we la- 
bor to this end and accomplish our pur- 
pose, what a great and grand thing it 
would be. What utility can there be in 
profaning the name of the Lord? Will it 
distinguish a man among his fellow- 
men or gain him respect? Is there a 
boy here who has received any more 
respect from his companions by pro- 
faning the name of the Lord? No. 
They would not respect you a bit more 
for committing this wrong act; such a 
boy would not even gain the favor of 
his own clique, by so doing, to say 
nothing of the opinion others would 
have of him. A person that indulges 
in this bad habit is almost sure to 
offend somebody; there is one who sits 
on high who will also be offended, and 
what will be the consequence of this, 
of offending our Father in heaven? 
Our young men go to the various col- 
leges, and some become graduates of 
great institutions of learning; but they 
are no more accomplished in swearing 
than the most ignorant among us. It 
is no mark of culture, and has no 
merit whatever. It does not even 
enable us to express our ideas with 
any more force. If we desire to ob- 
tain a good knowledge of the 
English , language, it is not 
necessary that we learn to profane the 
name of the Lord. We are admonished 
not to swear at all. It is an idle use 
of words and a thing we ought to 
abominate and avoid. 



ELDER HYRUM M. SMITH. 



59 



I do not feel justified in occupying 
any more time this morning, for there 
are several Apostles here, from whom 
.you no doubt wish to hear. I know 
this is the work of God, and that the 
Prophet Joseph Smith was sent of God 
to usher in this great and glorious dis- 
pensation. I know that the influence 
of this Gospel is to help us purify our- 
selves and overcome the evils that are 
in our midst, and that we may devote 
■our energy to endeavoring to overcome 
these evils is my prayer, in the name 
of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER HYRUM M. SMITH. 

My brethren and sisters, there is an 
item I would like to speak, of, for the 
benefit of some of the Latter-day 
Saints. Many words of instruction 
have been spoken, and I like to speak 
them myself; but, somehow, I cannot 
always get through a conference or 
meeting without hearing a word or two 
of condemnation. 

I well remember the remarks of 
Brother John W. Taylor here, while 
out in one of the missions. There was 
quite a congregation of outsiders pres- 
ent, and he was endeavoring to teach 
them the Gospel of Jesus Christ, and 
was telling them what the Latter-day 
Saints believed in. He was speaking on 
the first principles of the Gospel, and 
was telling them that it was necessary 
to yield obedience to the command- 
ments of the Lord and be baptized for 
the remission of sins, and have hands 
laid upon them, by those holding the 
proper authority, for the reception of 
the Holy Ghost. While he was thus 
speaking two or three of the congrega- 
tion, as I remember it, arose to their 
feet, and, with a look of contempt on 
their faces, started to leave the room. 
Brother Taylor then added, "We also 
believe that every man and every wo- 
man who enters a house of worship 
ought to have enough good 
manners and breeding to remain 
until the services are concluded.' 
I thought that was pretty good 
doctrine, and I hope the Latter-day 
Saints believe and accept it;, but in 
case that some of us had forgotten it, 
T just mentioned it for our benefit. 

I was delighted with the testimony 
of Brother Penrose, and, in listening to 



the same I was hoping that when I 
got to- be as old as he is I would also 
have the same testimony to bear, and 
that I shall have passed the most of 
my life in preaching the Gospel and 
trying to do what good I can in my 
calling. (Turning to Brother Penrose). 
How old are you Brother Penrose? 
Over 70 years of age, and yet Brother 
Penrose does not look to be so old; but 
he could yet make many young men 
perspire freely, were they to accompany 
him in a walk. He has a testimony 
of the truth and has been faithful all 
the days of his life, thus far, and, evi- 
dently, will be the remainder of his 
life. May God grant him many years 
of life, that he may still defend, in nis 
champion way, the Latter-day Saints. 
He spoke of the union of the Latter-day 
Saints. They adhere together; they all 
cling around one standard, because they 
receive their inspiration from one 
source. 

My brethren and sisters, God is at 
the head of this great work, and He is 
exalting His people. Look at the mul- 
titude here and in the Tabernacle to- 
day who have gathered ' together to 
hear the word of the Lord. It is with 
the spirit of envy that some of those 
not of our faith witness our unity in 
assembling together to be instructed in 
the ways of the Lord. We are Latter- 
day Saints, brethren and sisters, we 
are one people, no matter where we are 
or how we may be scattered, and there 
is only one kind of "Mormons," only 
one kind of Latter-day Saints. 

I have a clipping here from a news- 
paper, with reference to a paper which 
was read by a minister in a religious 
convention, or convention of ministers, 
which I will read. It says: 

"The paper of the day was by Rev. 
Charles J. Godsman, pastor of the Pres- 
byterian Church at Auburn. His sub- 
ject was 'The Essential "Unity of the 
Christian Church.' He named the dif- 
ferent varieties of churches: Six kinds 
of Adventists, seven kinds of Catholics, 
twelve kinds of Presbyterians, thirteen 
of Baptists, sixteen of Lutherans and 
seventeen of Methodists, with 100 sep- 
arate entities of churches besides. The 
speaker deplored this condition of 
things and looked upon it as contrary 
to the Scriptures. He maintained, how- 
ever, that there was a real, deep union 
of all beliefs, notwithstanding this out- 
ward variety. The paper was well re- 
ceived."

GENERAL, CONFERENCE. 



How many 01 them realize that this 
condition of things is entirely contrary 
to Scripture? And of those who did 
realize this how many were there 
who had the moral courage to say 
that it was wrong and contrary to 
scripture, that in such a condition of 
separation and disunion there could be 
no real union in the Gospel of the Lord 
Jesus Christ? They dare not come out 
and stand on the principle of the thing 
and say that it is entirely 
contrary to the will of God. 
The Latter-day Saints dare do 
it, because they know it and they 
are one people and have not divided in- 
to a dozen or more sects, there being 
but one kind of Latter-day Saints. 

My brethren and sisters, as I said. 
God is exalting us, and I would like 
to caution you not to seek to exalt 
yourselves, but to leave that to God, 
who will exalt us quickly and grandly 
enough, inasmuch as we seek to keep 
His laws and commandments. 

One word to the young men and 
young women. Much has been said 
with reference to the rearing 
of children and teaching them 
the principles of the Gospel. 
In relation to the Religion Classes 
brethren and sisters, I would add, there 
ought to be a Religion Class in the 
home of every Latter-day Saint. Every 
member of the Church ought to have a 
Religion Class, where the children are 
being taught the principles of the Gos- 
pel. I want to say to you young men 
and young women of which 
this congregation is, in the main, made 
up, that belief in the Gospel of Jesus 
Christ is the very first step; and the 
only way you will ever come to a 
knowledge of the truth is by first be- 
lieving the testimony of vour parents 
and of the servants of God, no matter 
who or where they are. You have first 
got to believe their testimony and have 
faith in their words; then you will 
come to a knowledge of the truth. The 
Lord will not condescend to come down 
in person to each of us to convince us 
that this is His Church; not by any 
means. We must believe the words 
and testimonies. So it has been from 
the beginning. The sons of Adam had 
to believe the words of Adam and to 
put into practice the things taught 



them before they could know. You 
young men and young women who may 
not have a testimony must put into 
practice what you are taught before 
you can obtain a witness of the div- 
inity of this work. 

May the Lord bless you and cause 
you to desire a knowledge of the Gos- 
pel of Jesus Christ above all else, which 
I ask in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 

ELDER HEBER J. GRANT. 

I am very pleased indeed to have the 
opportunity of meeting with the Latter- 
day Saints, and I have listened with 
pleasure, interest and attention to that 
which has been said. 

Brother Taylor requested Brother 
Penrose to occupy his time. Some peo- 
ple are always inclined to criticise, and, 
as Brother Penrose talked a little long- 
er than the rest of us, some may go 
away and find fault with his talking 
so long. I have given much advice to 
the Latter-day Saints in my time, and 
one of the principle items was never to 
criticise any one but ourselves. I be- 
lieve in fault-finding for breakfast, 
dinner and supper, but with our own 
dear selves. 

I endorse all that has been said here 
this morning. I am delighted to see this 
building full of Latter-day Saints. It is 
a testimony and a confirmation of the 
remarks of our Prophet yesterday, that 
Zlon is growing, and that the Latter- 
day Saints are increasing in faith and 
good works and are laboring for the 
advancement of the kingdom of God. I 
rejoice exceedingly in being here with 
you today to lift up my voice in testi- 
mony of the divinity of the work of 
God in which we are engaged. I re- 
joice that the testimony of the Gospel 
grows and increases within me day by 
day; for every day of my life it seems 
as though the Lord blesses me with ad- 
ditional knowledge. I rejoice, as I said 
the other evening in Priesthood meet- 
ing, that we stand as a united whole. 
I rejoice that the adversary, who in- 
spired the men to kill our Prophet and 
Patriarch, has been routed. I rejoice in 
thinking that a son of the martyred 
Patriarch stands at the head of this 
Church. I rejoice that a love has al- 



ELDER BEN E. RICH. 



61 



ways existed in the hearts of the Lat- 
ter-day Saints for all the Prophets of 
God since the organization of the 
Church down to the present time. I 
rejoice in the love and confidence the 
Latter-day Saints have for the First 
Presidency of the Church, and for the 
Apostles. I rejoice in the testimony 
that is borne in my heart that all of 
the authorities of the Church — the First 
Presidency, Apostles, Seventies, Stake 
presidents and ward authorities, 
as well as the presidents of the vari- 
ous auxiliary organizations — are 
seeking- for and desiring the ad- 
vancement of God's work. I rejoice 
in seeing the harriers broken down 
whereby the Gospel may be carried to 
all the nations of the earth. I rejoice 
in the testimony in my heart that, as 
was stated by Brother Penrose, the 
opening in Japan will prove the opening 
of the oriental world, not merely the 
opening of the little islands that form 
the nation of Japan, but it shall also 
lead to the Gospel being preached in 
China and other oriental nations. 

One of the pleasures I had recently 
was the privilege of baptising a gen- 
tleman who speaks the Corean lan- 
guage. His wife also speaks that 
language, and I expect she will also 
soon join the Church. I believe this man 
will soon be an instrument in the hands 
of God in preaching the Gospel in 
Corea. I also met a man that has 
written considerable in a paper in our 
favor, stating, among other things, 
that we are the only people that teach 
as the Bible teaches. This man has, 
for many years, been taking trips into 
China, trying to advocate improve- 
ments in that country. He looks dif- 
ferent from the ordinary Japanese. He 
is a very large man, and looks like an 
oriental. He wears his hair long, and 
forms it into a cue when he takes his 
trips to China. I think he, among oth- 
ers, will also come to a knowledge of 
the truth. Brother Snow, our late 
President, who passed away since I left 
Salt Lake City last year, said, when I 
was called to go to Japan, "I feel in 
my heart that this will be the opening 
wedge for the Gospel in that country." 
Brother Penrose was just saying he 
believed this would be the case, and I 
want to say to you that I believe it, 
and I believe it with all my heart. 



I rejoice in the Gospel of the Lord 
Jesus Christ, and in the knowledge that 
God lives, that Jesus is the Christ, and 
that Joseph Smith is a Prophet of God. 
I rejoice in being permitted to attend 
the first general conference presided 
over by the son of the martyred Patri- 
arch. 

May God bless each and every one of 
us, that as we grow and increase we 
may grow in the knowledge of the Gos- 
pel, and that we shall have a determin- 
ation to serve God and carry out in 
very deed the teachings of the Savior; 
to let our light so shine tnat men see- 
ing our good works shall glorify God. 
If we set an example worthy of imita- 
tion it is sure to have its effects. I re- 
ceived a letter from a man in London, 
stating that the Latter-day Saints were 
the only people, so far as he knew, who 
carried their daily beliefs into their 
daily life, as though they believed what 
they taught. Well, God bless you, one 
and all; I ask it in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 

The choir and congregation sang: 

The time is far spent, there is little re- 
maining. 

Benediction by Elder John W. Tay- 
lor. 



IN THE TABERNACLE. 
Sunday, 10 a. m. 

The choir and congregation sang: 

We thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet, 
To guide us in these latter days; 

We thank Thee for sending the Gospel, 
To lighten our minds with its rays. 

Prayer was offered by Elder William 
Budge 

Singing by the choir: 

Ye simple souls who stray 
Far from the path of peace.

ELDER BEN. E. RICH. 

(President of the Southern States 
mission.) 

It has been my privilege for some 
little time back to labor in what is 
known as the Southern States mis- 
sion. The field covered by the South- 
ern States mission is rather large, in- 
cluding the states of Ohio, Virginia, 



62 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



North Carolina, Soutn Carolina, Flori- 
da, Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, Ten- 
nessee and Kentucky; so that it reach- 
es from Lake Erie on the north to the 
Gulf of Mexico on the south, and from 
the Mississippi river to the Atlantic 
ocean. Since I have been there, from 
1,050 to 1,100 Elders have labored in 
the Southern States mission. I be- 
lieve that I have traveled 140,000 miles. 
I have not the exact number, but be- 
tween 3,500 and 4,000 baptisms have tak- 
en place during that time. We have 
published and distributed among the 
people 1,500,000 tracts, 70,000 of the 
Voice of Warning, 10,000 Orson Pratt's 
Works, 7,000 Books of Mormon, 55,000 
of a little work called Durant, besides 
about 20,000 miscellaneous works bear- 
ing upon the principles of the Gospel. 
I believe there is not a house, outside 
of the larger cities of the south, where 
the Mormon Elders have not tapped at 
the door. As a rule, the Elders are 
happy in their labors; all of them are 
who have the spirit of their mission, 
and it is only occasionally that I have 
found an Elder destitute of that spirit. 
The Gospel has been preached, many 
people have rendered obedience to the 
principles of the same, and in return 
they have borne testimony to their 
relatives and neighbors that God has 
given them a testimony concerning the 
divinity of this work. The people of 
the south are a good people. As a 
rule, they are a religious people. They 
are not a hypocritical people. If they 
are your enemy, they let you know it. 
We have made some very strong and 
influential friends in the south; and, 
as is the case wherever the Gospel is 
preached, we have also made some 
very strong and influential enemies. I 
believe that I have three invitations 
there now to be killed, but I have been 
so busy that I have not had time to 
fill any of them yet. We have lost four 
Elders by death during the last four 
years; and considering the large num- 
ber that we have had laboring in the 
south, and the difference there is be- 
tween the climate in the valleys of the 
mountains and down around the ever- 
glades of Florida, I think the Lord has 
blessed us exceedingly in not allowing 
more of our Elders to lay down their 
lives in the south. The most of our 



trouble comes from the ministers. If 
they would remember the command- 
ments of God, and stop their lying and 
stop bearing false witness against their 
neighbor::, we would have less trouble 
in the south. Probably the ministers 
of Salt Lake would be surprised if I 
should tell them that I have a book, al- 
most the size of a family Bible, con- 
taining an account of all the mobbings 
of the Mormon Elders in the south, and 
85 per cent of the mobs have been head- 
ed by ministers. When our Elders go 
into the large cities to preach the Gos- 
pel without purse or scrip, these min- 
isters go to the officers of the law and 
remind them that there are laws 
against beggars, against vagrants, and 
they ask that our Elders be arrested 
when they have no visible means of 
support. They went so far in one of 
the legislatures of the south as to in- 
fluence a man to introduce a measure 
making it a crime to preach the Gospel 
without a salary! I think if Christ and 
the Apostles were to come back and 
meet some of these pretended repre- 
sentatives of Jesus, He would not labor 
three years before the cry would go 
up, Crucify him! Crucify him! 

I rejoiced in listening to the testi- 
monies of the Elders yesterday. I want 
to refer briefly to the remarks of one 
of them concerning the Congress of 
Religions, held during the period of 
the World's fair, when the representa- 
tive sent by the Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints was rejected. It 
is the first time in the history of this 
world when the representatives of all 
the religious faiths of the world came 
together in a Congress. The pagan, the 
Jew, the various denominations 
throughout Christendom, the heathen 
priests — all were there. There was one, 
and only one, who did not receive of 
their courtesies. There was one 
who was not of the world! Jesus 
Christ said concerning His people, "If 
ye were of the world, the world would 
love his own: but because ye are not 
of the world, but I have chosen you out 
of the world, therefore the world hat- 
eth you.' If ever I had cause for re- 
joicing, it was when it was demonstrat- 
ed, the only time in the history ot the 
world when these words of Christ had 
a chance to be verified, that we were 



i^LDSR JOSEPH A. McRAE.

the people who were not of the world. 
We are the ones who claim that God 
has revealed His Gospel anew from 
the heavens, and that it is builded up- 
on the rock of revelation from God. 
Those who were instruments in causing 
the word to go forth 1800 years ago to 
crucify the representative of modern 
revelation are the ones today who are 
engaged in the same cause. I have 
often said that the devil does not care 
how many dead prophets the people of 
this or any other generation believe in; 
but when God reveals His mind and 
will anew, then it is the devil's busi- 
ness to blind the eyes of the people and 
stop their ears against the prophet of 
God who comes to deliver that message 
to mankind. It was mibeluef in modern 
revelation anciently that was the curse 
of the generation to whom Christ came, 
and He told them that their condemna- 
tion was that they would build syna- 
gogues to the memory of the dead pro- 
phets, but stood ready to crucify the 
living ones; and I believe that if Christ 
came again He would have the same 
message to deliver throughout the 
length and breadth of Christendom. 

I rejoice in the work of the ministry. 
I have enjoyed my labors. I thank God 
for the testimony He has given me con- 
cerning the divinity of this work. I 
know that if I am faithful to that tes- 
timony to the end of my days I will be 
saved and exalted in the celestial king- 
dom of God. That we all may be faith- 
ful to the end of our days, and reap 
this great and everlasting reward, is 
my prayer in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER JOSEPH A. McRAE. 
(President of the Colorado Mission.) 

My brethren and sisters, I desire an 
interest in your faith and prayers for 
the few moments that I shall speak to 
you, that I may be under the inspira- 
tion of our Father in heaven. It has 
been my pleasure to labor for a short 
time in the Colorado mission, and the 
time that I have been there has been 
the pleasantest of my life. The Colo- 
rado mission embraces a great deal 
of territory. Many of the Latter-day 
Saints do not realize its extent. We go 
from Canada on the north to Mexico on 
the south, and from the Missouri river 



to California, including the states of 
North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebras- 
ka, Wyoming and Colorado, and the 
territories of New Mexico and Arizona. 
The people who live in this locality are 
comparatively a new people. The 
country is also comparatively new — 
about the same as Utah. The people 
who have settled it came there for the 
benefit of their health or for the pur- 
pose of making money; and there is a 
great indifference among them with 
respect to the Gospel of Jesus Christ. 
We have no persecution to meet. I 
sometimes wish we had; for I believe 
if we had a little it might cause the 
honest in heart to look at us and see 
what we really are teaching. As it is, 
it requires a great effort on the part of 
the Elders to get the people to take any 
interest in us whatever. W e have a 
very healthy climate. I do not think 
there has been an Elder taken home 
dead from the Colorado mission, and, 
so far as I know, there has only been 
one case where an Elder has died with- 
in a few weeks after his return. We 
have eight stakes of Zion situated with- 
in the borders of our mission, and it 
is a difficult mission to preach the 
Gospel in, for we find so many people 
who have drifted away from the 
Church, and who have denied that 
they ever had a testimony. This class 
of people do us a great deal of injury. 
On the other hand, we find people who 
have drifted away from the body of the 
Church, having forgotten lh;ir cove- 
nants, but who are brought back into 
the fold by the labors of the Elders, 
and they rejoin the stakes of Zion, pay 
their tithes and offerings, and become 
active members. In this way we are 
trying to do some good; but in some 
instances the efforts of the Elders are 
not realized because their labors are 
among this class of people. We find 
many of our young sisters who have 
married outside of the pales of the 
Church. They come to us with tears 
in their eyes, and say they wish they 
had their life to lead over again. In 
my experience in the mission field I 
have got the first woman to see yet 
who was happy in this kind of a union, 
and I have met hundreds of them. We 
have between forty and fifty Elders 
doing the work in these five states and

two territories, and they are kept busy. 
Some parts of our mission have to re- 
main without Elders, because we do not 
have sufficient to preach the Gospel 
there. There are no Elders in North 
and South Dakota, nor in Wyoming, at 
the present time. There are thirteen 
Elders in Nebraska, where we- ought to 
have at least twenty-five or thirty; 
but we realize that it is difficult to get 
the number of Elders to preach the 
Gospel that should be sent out into the 
mission fields. It would be a difficult 
thing for me to estimate the number 
of conversions, or the amount of litera- 
ture that has been distributed, as I 
have not the figures with me. It is 
difficult to estimate the number of con- 
versions, for the reason that so many 
have been brought back into the 
Church, or have been led to renew their 
covenants. 

I know that this is the Gospel of 
Jesus Christ, and, like the Apostle 
Paul, I know it is the power of God 
unto salvation. I have joy and satis- 
faction in my labors in preaching the 
Gospel unto the people of the world, 
and in bearing my testimony wherever 
it is possible for my voice to be raised. 
I wish to give my life to the service 
of the Lord. The only desire of my 
heart is to do what good I can for my 
fellowmen, and to ,preach the Gospel 
unto those who know not Jesus Christ. 
I have been very much interested in the 
conference thus far, and to me it is 
a feast. I can appreciate the words of 
Apostle Grant, when he f'iu that no 
one but those who are deprived of 
these blessings can realize and under- 
stand to the fullest extent the blessings 
that are bestowed upon them by hav- 
ing the privilege of attending these 
conferences. I know that I am spirit- 
ually fed. I know that it does me good 
when I return to my mission field, and 
I feel that the Elders who are labor- 
ing with me partake of the same spirit 
and are actuated by the self-same tes- 
timony that has been given at this con- 
ference. They write to me, "Attend 
all the conferences, and do not miss 
any of them; for we feel that when you 
return to the mission you will carry the 
same spirit with you." I pray that I 
shall, and I pray that we will all carry 
the spirit of this conference with us to 
our homes, that it may be a blessing 



to us and our children and to those 
who have not the privilege of attending 
the conferences. I ask it in the name of 
Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER J. G. DUFFIN. 

(President of the Southwestern States 
Mission.) 

My brethren and sisters, I feel grate- 
ful to my Father in heaven for the 
privilege of meeting with you in this 
annual conference, and I trust that the 
Spirit of God will enable me to briefly 
report the work of the Lord in the 
Southwestern States mission. That 
mission is one of magnificent distances 
and of liberal-minded people. The 
people who live in the great majority 
of the states embraced within the ter- 
ritory that we cover have come from 
the various states of the Union and 
from almost every nation under hea- 
ven. They have come from among the 
best classes of the people, and have 
drifted westward, largely, I believe, be- 
cause of the liberal spirit that pre- 
vails in the western part of the United 
States. On this account we meet with 
but little persecution, and wherever our 
Elders go they are treated well, as a 
rule. The people generally are reli- 
giously inclined. We are meeting with 
fair success in that mission, not alone 
measured by the number of baptisms, 
though they are reasonably satisfac- 
tory, but the people are purchasing our 
publications, and during the past year 
we have placed in their hands nearly 
10,000 of our books, including the 
Book of Mormon, the Book of Doctrine 
and Covenants, and the . Life of the 
Prophet Joseph Smith. We have also 
distributed nearly 5,000 of the Voice 
of Warning and hundreds of an excel- 
lent little book written by Prest. Ben. 
E. Rich, of the Southern States mis- 
sion. We have emphasized in our la- 
bors the truth that God has spoken 
from the heavens, that He has raised 
up in these latter days prophrts, and 
that through them is He giving His 
word unto all nations of the earth. 

If there ever has been a time when 
it has been necessary or prudent to 
dwell almost exclusively upon the four 
fundamental principles of the Gospel, 
and to say but little about what God 
is doing today among His children, 



ELDER J. G. DUFFIN.

that time we have felt impressed, does 
not now exist in the Southwestern States 
mission. Because of that we have 
been led to impress upon the Elders 
in that mission the importance of stu- 
dying the revelations of God given to- 
day, and to bring before the people 
that word of God in its purity, to let 
the people know that God is doing a 
work today, and not be forever dwelling 
on the past centuries. This is creating 
a wonderful impression for good among 
the people, and their minds are being 
drawn to the great work that God is 
doing now. "We have felt the im- 
portance of getting our literature into 
the hands of the people, so that it 
might be read and impressions for truth 
be made upon their minds, in place of 
their reading all the time those books 
that have been written against the 
work of God. We have been greatly 
favored in the past year in getting out 
a ten thousand edition of that sacred 
book revealed from God by one of His 
heavenly messengers, the Book of Mor- 
mon. While some of the brethren 
have been speaking during the confer- 
ence that we are afraid to attempt 
what our fathers did, I want to say to 
you, my brethren and sisters, that your 
sons have been led to contribute of 
their means to that work, knowing that 
if they would do it God would bless 
them therein; and that book has been 
published, half of the expense being 
borne by the Elders of that mission and 
by a few others. We feel very grateful 
for this privilege and we know that it 
is going to accomplish a great amount 
of pood. 

The headquarters of our mission is 
located in what is termed the land of 
Zion. We are in Kansas City, ten 
miles only from Independence, the 
spot where the temple will yet be 
erected. I have been very much im- 
pressed during the last year with the 
very favorable sentiment that is ex- 
hibited in that land toward our people. 
It is only a few days ago since I re- 
ceived a letter from the city engineer 
of Independence, stating to me that a 
portion of the original temple lot was 
now for sale, and if our people desired 
to get hold of that we could do so by 
paying the purchase price. The ori- 
ginal temple lot, according to the 



plat on the records, contained about 
63 acres, and it is now possible for this 
people, if they desire, to purchase the 
greater portion of it. I state this by 
way of encouragement to the Saints — 
not that I am particularly impressed 
that the time is here just now to do 
that work, though it may be, but to 
show the sentiment in that land, from 
which our fathers were driven, and 
where our mothers and sisters were 
abused so shamefullv. There are 
thousands of people today who would 
welcome you back with open arms, 
and do all in their power to assist in 
the building up of the work of the 
Lord in that country, from a worldly 
point of view. 

One word more before closing. A 
few days ago I had business to trans- 
act in Kansas City with a leading 
manufacturer. After we had got 
through our business, the question of 
our people going back to that country 
came up, and he said to me, "Mr. Duf- 
fln, it appears to me almost improbable 
that your people will ever accomplish 
the work that I understand has been 
predicted." I said to him, calling him 
by name, "You have done business 
with my people; you understand their 
integrity. Now, let your mind go 
back to the year 1847. The pioneers 
went into the Salt Lake valley on the 
24th of July of that year. A few days 
after they reached the place where 
Salt Lake City now stands, Brigham 
Young struck his cane on a certain 
spot, and said, 'Here we will build the 
temple of our God.' Today the Salt 
Lake temple stands upon that spot. 
The idea was never lost sight of that 
that temple would be erected upon that 
spot; and never has the idea been lost 
sight of that the City of Zion .will be 
built where Independence now stands, 
and the temple of our God will be 
erected there." "Well," said he, "it 
may be so; but if it is, your people 
will exert a wonderful influence for 
hundreds of miles around." This is 
the sentiment of the people. I want 
to say that God is preparing the way 
for His work to be accomplished. The 
words of our beloved Prophet at the 
opening of this conference are true. I 
know that Zion is growing, and her 
borders are extending. I know that 



fit;

the work of God is established upon 
this earth, and that it will ultimately 
prevail. I know that God lives, and 
that Jesus is the Christ. I know that 
Joseph Smith is a true Prophet of God, 
and those who have succeeded him 
have been and are the oracles of God, 
His prophets and through them has 
come His word unto the nations of the 
earth. God bless you. Amen. 

ELDER GEORGE TEASDALE. 

God's message to the world — All the faithful en- 
titled to a testimony of the truth. 

In listening to the testimonies and 
the instructions that have been given 
at this conference my heart has been 
full' of thanksgiving and praise to God, 
our Eternal Father for His loving 
kindness and tender mercy unto us His 
children. It is wonderful the knowledge 
that has been brought to the earth in 
the restoration of the everlasting Gos- 
pel, which was rejeoted 1800 years ago 
by the Jews and by the Gentiles. How 
highly we are favored to have the 
privilege of living upon the earth in the 
dispensation of the fulness of times, 
which was spoken of by all the prophets 
who foresaw the wonderful work that 
was to be done in the last days in the 
establishment of the righteousness of 
God upon the earth! "Believe on the 
Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be 
saved," is the message that we have 
been carrying to the people, with signs 
following the true believer. The restor- 
ation of the Priesthood of the Son of 
God and the authority to preach His 
Gospel and to administer in the or- 
dinances of His house, has made it 
possible for all the children of our 
Father to obtain light and truth, if they 
desire it; for we are equal before the 
Lord as His children, and we all have 
the privilege of understanding the prin- 
ciples of life and salvation, no matter 
what our circumstances or position may 
be in life. The Lord hath said, "Look 
unto me, all ye ends of the earth, and 
be ye saved; for I am God, and beside 
me there is no Savior." 

The Latter-day Saints are called by 
the world "Mormons;" the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is 
called the "Mormon" Church. Why it 
should be so is a question. Mormon 



had nothing to do with the organization 
of this Church. The Lord Jesus Christ 
organized it. It is not the "Mormon" 
Church; it is the Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints. Those who em- 
brace the doctrine of the Son of God 
are called Saints. Eighteen hundred 
years ago the members of the Church of 
Christ were called Saints. The Apostle 
Paul wrote to the Saints in Rome, to the 
Saints in Corinth. How came they to 
be Saints? Simply because they ac- 
cepted Jesus Christ and believed in His 
doctrine. The Lord Jesus himself said: 
"My doctrine is not mine, but his that 
sent me. If any man will do His will, 
he shall know of the doctrine." It has 
been manifested at this conference, in 
the testimonies that have been borne 
by these living oracles, that they know 
that God lives, that Jesus is the Christ, 
and that He has commenced His mar- 
velous work and a wonder. I am not 
surprised that the wisdom of the wise 
perishes and the understanding of the 
prudent is hid, when they call the 
Church of Christ the "Mormon" 
Church. Please tell me where is the 
justification for calling the followers ol 
the Lord Jesus Christ in this dispensa- 
tion "Mormons," and the doctrine 
taught by the Latter-day Saints "Mor- 
monism." I have never heard a justi- 
fiable reason why it should be so. It is 
done, under the influence of anti-Christ, 
for the purpose of impressing upon peo- 
ple that this is not the Church of 
Christ. Those who embrace the Gospel 
are called Saints, because they are true 
believers in the Lord Jesus Christ and 
in His doctrine. 

We worship the living and true God, 
our glorious Creator, in the name of 
Jesus Christ. We have accepted of the 
atonement; we have repented of our 
sins, and have been baptized by immer- 
sion for the remission of sins, to fulfil 
all righteousness, and that we might 
be born of the water; we have been 
sanctified in the precious blood of 
Christ, which follows the water, and 
we ha,ve received the gift of the Holy 
Ghost by the laying on of hands, and 
we have obtained a living testimony. 
This makes us peculiar. We have come 
put of the world and taken up the cross 
of Christ; we advocate His doctrines, 
and we know that they are true, for we

have tested them. Every man and 
every woman who has ever accepted the 
doctrine of Christ in all humility and 
meekness, seeing light and truth from 
our Father in heaven, and has lived the 
principles of the Gospel, has obtained a 
living testimony that it is true. It 
shows us that the Lord is no respecter 
of persons, but every member of 
the Church of Christ has a right to 
knowledge, light and intelligence, 
and to know that the doctrine of 
Christ is true, by the revelations of Al- 
mighty God. We know that the Lord 
has established His Church upon the 
rock of revelation, and we know, as 
Daniel of old knew, that there is a 
God in heaven that revealeth secrets. 
We know that the spirit of prophecy is 
in the Church, because we are contin- 
ually hearing prophecies and seeing 
them fulflled. The Apostles, under the 
direction of the Presidency of the 
Church, set apart missionaries to go 
and preach the Gospel to the nations, 
where they themselves have already 
been, and where they have given their 
testimony concerning this people and 
the restoration of the everlasting Gos- 
pel; and the predictions they utter up- 
on the heads of those who are thus set 
apart are verified. The missionaries 
come back like the ancient seventy, 
who returned rejoicing in the power 
of God that had been made manifest 
in their administrations, even devils 
being subject to them. The Lord Je- 
sus Christ told them not to rejoice so 
much in that as that their names 
were written in the Lamb's book of life. 
To have our names written in the 
Lamb's book of life is everything to us. 
But it is necessary that individually 
we work out our own salvation, and be 
in harmony with the eternal princi- 
ples of the everlasting Gospel of the 
Son of God. The Lord Jesus Christ 
said unto His disciples anciently, "Go 
ye into all the world, and preach the 
Gospel to every creature. He that be- 
lieveth and is baptized shall be saved." 
Believeth what? Believeth in the Lord 
Jesus Christ, in the atonement, in the 
resurrection, in holding communication 
with the heavens, in the spirit of reve- 
lation, in putting our trust in .God, in 
doing good, in fulfilling our individual 
missions, and being in obedience to the 



principles of the Gospel. This is .the 
only way by which we can obtain a 
knowledge of the truth. The Savior 
said, "No man knoweth the Son, but 
the Father; neither knoweth any man 
the Father, save the Son, and he to 
whom the Son will reveal Him." 
We are living testators that the Lord 
has restored to the earth this know- 
ledge and made it possible for us to 
understand the things of God, , be- 
cause we have the fellowship of the 
Holy Ghost. We declare these glad tid- 
ings of great joy to the people, calling 
upon them to repent, to worship the 
living and true God, and to obey the 
Gospel of the Son of God, that they 
may be put in possession of this price- 
less knowledge, that they may be de- 
livered from ignorance, priestcraft, er- 
ror, superstition, and the darkness 
that covers the earth and the gross 
darkness the minds of the people, by 
having the fellowship of the Spirit of 
God and being taught of His ways, 
that they may walk in His paths. 

After fifty years experience in the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints, I do know most assuredly that 
God lives. I do know most assuredly 
that Jesus is the Christ. I do know 
most assuredly that the signs follow 
the true believer, and that the doctrine 
of the Father, taught by the Son is 
true. No man has ever accepted this 
Gospel and lived its principles, but has 
been satisfied and has obtained a 
knowledge that it is true. This is a 
glorious opportunity for mankind. The 
Lord Jesus Christ is coming in flam- 
ing Are, with ten thousand of His an- 
gels, to take vengeance on them that 
know not God and o^~- not the Gospel 
of the Son of God. This Gospel is be- 
ing preached by His authority. It is 
not the work of man, it is ths work of 
God. This wonderful gathering that 
has been brought to pass has been ac- 
complished by our Father in heaven, 
who is doing His own work. I thought 
the other day, when Apostle Grant was 
telling us of two being baptized in Ja- 
pan, that is the way the LtJ gen- 
erally commences His work, the Lord 
Jesus Christ and John the Baptist in 
their dispensations, and in these last 
days Joseph Smith, Jr., and Oliver 
Cowdery, in the dispensation of the

fullness of times. Jesus declared that 
no man could come unto Him except 
the Father drew him. All glory to God 
our Eternal Father that we have been 
drawn into His fold; that we had the 
moral courage to come out of the popu- 
lar religions of the world and to take 
up the cross of Christ. We have been 
rewarded. The Father has given unto 
us a living testimony concerning this 
work, and we know that these princi- 
ples are true. We say to all the world, 
Repent, obey the Gospel, receive the 
remission of your sins, become sancti- 
fied through the precious blocd of Je- 
sus Christ, receive the gift of the Holy 
Ghost, and be one with us in our glor- 
ious brotherhood in Christ Jesus, 
adopted into the family of our Father 
in heaven. God bless you, my be- 
loved brethren and sisters. Let us _be 
encouraged; for I can bear testimony 
to the truth of the expression of our 
beloved President, that the Saints are 
improving, increasing in righteousness 
and in good works. I know it from my 
labors among the people. The power 
and Spirit of God rests upon me when 
visiting the Stakes of Zion under the 
direction of the Presidency, and I know 
the freedom we enjoy and the hearty 
reception we receive. I say, God bless 
you forever; and all gliry, power, 
might, majesty and dominion be as- 
cribed to God and the Lamb forever! 
Even so, amen. 

ELDER JOHN HENRY SMITH. 

Pro re^b'ln? made in different missions — Favor- 
able change ol sentiment in the Bast toward 
• the Saints. 

My brethren and sisters, it is indeed 
a pleasure to me to meet with you in 
this conference, although I failed to be 
with you upon the first day and re- 
gret that I did not hear the remarks 
that were made by the brethren who 
spoke during that day. 

It has been my privilege during the 
past thirty days to visit in various 
parts of the East. I met with the El- 
ders in Chicago, and had a very pleas- 
ant and agreeable time with them. 
President Woodruff of that mission re- 
gretted very much that he could not 
attend this conference, for the reason 
that appointments had been made and 



the conditions were such that he felt 
it unwise to leave his field of labor. I 
also had the privilege, in connection 
with President Ben E. Rich, of attend- 
ing a meeting in Richmond, Virginia, 
and mingling with the Elders there. I 
found that the spirit of inquiry is man- 
ifest in that capital city of the Old 
Dominion. From there it was my priv- 
ilege to visit the states of New York 
and Massachusetts and, in connection 
with the Elders in those fields hold 
meetings. I believe the work is devel- 
oping fairly well in Boston. The El- 
ders seem to be hopeful, and the officers 
of that municipality seem to be quite 
fair. The Elders are now allowed to 
hold their meetings upon the Boston 
Common — a privilege that was denied 
some little time ago; and they feel that 
the chances for success in that field are 
very good indeed. They have a very 
nice branch of the Church there, and 
the spirit of inquiry Is manifesting 
itself among the people. President Mc- 
Quarrie of that mission is indeed an 
active, intelligent and devoted Elder. 
His heart is given to his work, and he 
is doing everything consistent to ex* 
tend and spread the Gospel among the 
people over whom he is called to pre- 
side. His conferences were also being 
held, which prevented him from coming 
here to attend the general conference. 
In the city of New York the spirit of 
inquiry is quite manifest. The Elders 
are very devoted to their work, and 
are holding meetings constantly upon 
the street corners, upon vacant lots, 
or wherever opportunity may offer 
within the confines of that great city. 
Fair treatment is accorded them gen- 
erally, and many are inclined to in- 
vestigate the doctrines of the Church. 
The recent baptism of a few choice peo- 
ple in that city has awakened some in- 
terest, and is causing others to in- 
vestigate the principles of the Gospel. 
I had the pleasure, in connection with 
the Elders in the city of New York, of 
attending- six meetings. At two of them 
representatives of all the leading pa- 
pers of New York City were present, 
and their notices of our meetings, tak- 
en as a whole, would be regarded as 
very fair, considering- the spirit that 
sometimes actuates the reporters in 
their idea that they must cater to a

69 



prejudice that exists in the minds of 
the people. The feeling manifested by 
them in conversation was also fair, and 
indeed quite generous upon the part of 
most of them. 

My own observation, in my brief 
visit to these fields of labor leads me 
to believe that the feeling of the people 
is undergoing a change, and that while 
the spirit of investigation may not be 
all that we could wish it to be, the 
people generally are inclined to treat 
us fairly. The American people, to a 
great degree, are not inclined to have 
much to do with religion. While they 
attend the churches and display their 
good clothes in their visitations there, 
there is an evidence of an indifference 
to the doctrinal views presented by the 
religious world at the present time. 
During my absence in the East I at- 
tended a Catholic service in the cathe- 
dral at Baltimore, and while I did not 
have the privilege of listening to Car- 
dinal Gibbon, I heard a very fine dis- 
course given by Father O'Gavin. In his 
effort before his congregation he sought 
to establish among them an under- 
standing of the reason that the Cath- 
olic Church in the world hold in re- 
spect and reverence images, and he 
made the argument, fully and explicit- 
ly upon his part, that it was not the 
images that they worshiped — they did 
not worship idols — but that it was sim- 
ply to impress upon their minds the 
nature of the Catholic faith. 

This, I believe, gives you in brief 
some idea of my visit to the East. 
During the trip I attended ten meet- 
ings among the Elders and Saints, and 
found them, in every part where it was 
my privilege to go, actively engaged in 
the accomplishment of their work, de- 
voted and true; and everybody whom I 
met in connection with them gave 
them a good name and spoke well of 
their devotion to the cause that they 
had gone forth in the world to repre- 
sent. 

With you I rejoice in the privilege of 
being in this conference, and in listen- 
ing to the remarks that ha- e been 
made by our brethren touching the 
many questions upon which they have 
spoken. The work of the Lord has 
been established, never more to be 
thrown down, nor given to another 



people. The Holy Priesthood, with its 
rights, its powers and its privileges, 
has been given to man in the day and 
age in which we live. It is the pur- 
pose of the Master that the world shall 
be warned in regard to this matter, 
that the truth shall be preached among 
the children of men, and that the spirit 
of this work shall be felt in every land, 
in every tongue, and in every nation. 
To this end the best efforts or the lives 
of thousands of men and women have 
been devoted in the past, and for the 
future the possibilities of their accom- 
plishments can alone be told by the 
spirit of revelation. But our duty in 
this respect is as full and clear, I trust, 
before our eyes, and before the eyes of 
the Presidency of the Church, today, 
as it was when in the beginning the 
Lord revealed His will and declared 
that this message of eternal truth must 
be taught to every nV-ion of the world, 
and that mankind must be warned of 
the truth and of its re-establishment. 
Today we are better equipped for 
the accomplishment of that mission 
than at any time in our past history. 
We are becoming more fully establish- 
ed in our homes; better opportunities 
are furnished for the education and 
training of the young; and the schools 
that have been established in the 
Church, together with the various or- 
ganizations and associations that have 
been builded up, are all aiding in that 
preparation which shall qualify the 
young men and maidens of our com- 
munities to go forth under the inspira- 
tion of the Divine Spirit, equipped for 
their ministry, and relying upon God 
their Father for the accomplishment of 
His holy will. I trust that in every 
home among the Latter-day Saints the 
foremost thought will be that, so far 
as lies within their power, the mem- 
bers of that household shall be fully 
equipped for the performance of their 
part and the discharge of the obliga- 
tions which they took upon themselves 
when they entered the sacred waters 
of baptism. The world is not warned. 
Its sons and its daughters by millions 
are not conversant with the truths 
that have been revealed through the 
ministrations of the prophets of these 
later days. They have heard bad 
words spoken of the Elders of the

Church of Jesus Christ. Thousands of 
them have believed, and are believing, 
that the people called Latter-day 
Saints are of the worst possible stripe 
among men and women. While thou- 
sands have heard the truth, and while 
thousands are from time to time visit- 
ing our mountain homes, and thereby 
changing their spirit and thought in re- 
gard to us as a people, there are thou- 
sands whose ears have never been sa- 
luted by the testimony of the truth, 
but who have been impressed with the 
thought, presented by someone as lack- 
ing in knowledge as they themselves, 
that the mission and purpose of the 
Latter-day Saints is simply to do 
evil among their fellowmen. But these 
thoughts are giving way. The proud 
and the mighty, conversant with the 
conditions of our own land, are not in- 
clined to avoid the companionship of 
a "Mormon" Elder. Those possessed of 
wealth, and standing in comfortable 
positions, as they are thrown in con- 
tact with the Elders of the Church are 
surprised at their character and de- 
portment, and they bear witness to 
their honesty and uprightness. But a 
short time ago, in the home of a 
Methodist family in the State of Massa- 
chusetts, the lady of the house ex- 
pressed her dislike of "Mormonism," 
as the world calls it, but, said she "the 
people around us do not understand 
Mormonism. A few days ago, in the 
chapel where I was worshiping, a per- 
son from your section of country made 
a representation of the conditions 
among your people that I knew was 
Snot true, and I told her so. I said 
that while I was not a believer in the 
doctrines taught by Joseph Smith, the 
Mormon Prophet, I knew her state- 
ments were not true, because I had 
mingled among the people and knew 
the conditions that existed among 
them." Thus in the towns and cities 
of our own land and in every part of 
the world may be found upright men 
and women who will not tolerate the 
suggestions that go forth from the lips 
of the unwise and imprudent, the dis- 
gruntled and the dissatisfied because 
of the failures that have come to 
themselves, who are belittling the cause 
of Christ, and seeking to trample be- 
neath their feet and dishonor the sys- 
tem that the Almighty has established 



in the world. These honest people who 
mingle with and are in the companion- 
ship of the Elders of the Church raise 
their voices in testimony of their good 
character, and are inclined to defend 
them by giving forth what is the truth, 
so far as they have been made conver- 
sant with it. 

I desire to say that in my brief visit 
to the Eastern States, it has been all 
that I could have wished. In associat- 
ing with the missions, in talking with 
the Saints, in visiting with strangers 
and expounding the doctrines of the 
Church, in mingling with men in ex- 
alted stations, the same spirit of fair- 
ness and of justice seems to manifest 
itself as you converse with them in 
regard to the character of the work 
which the Latter-day Saints represent 
in the world. 

My brothers and my sisters, the work 
of the Lord is onward and upward. The 
spirit of truth is disseminating itself 
little by little. There are, perhaps, 
millions of people within the confines 
of the United States who believe in 
the mission and ministry of Joseph 
Smith, and the day will come when, 
in the providences of Almighty God, 
they will link their destines with that 
cause and aid in its development and 
growth among the children of men. 
They are convinced in their souls, but 
they are restrained from an acceptance 
of it by the pride that exists and the 
feeling that it would be unwise for 
them to link their destines with it. Jn 
their hearts, however, the seed has 
been sown, the light of truth is spring- 
ing up, and the day will come when 
they will be humbled and will receive 
the truth. I have no more doubt of 
this than that I stand before you as 
a witness for that self-same truth and 
for that great God and His Holy Son 
who introduced the Gospel in this dis- 
pensation and taught the boy Prophet 
the way of life and the means by 
which the human family can be re- 
claimed. 

My brothers and my sisters, I pray 
that the blessings of heaven may 
abound in your hearts and homes. 
May the spirit of inspiration be in the 
mind and heart of every father and 
every mother. Let every boy and every 
girl be impressed with the sacredness 
of this mission that has been given to 



ELDER MATTHIAS F. COWLEY.

them — the sowing of the seeds of truth, 
the calling to repentance of the chil- 
dren of men, the pointing of the way 
of life to all who will listen. They that 
will listen, their hearts will be touch- 
ed; for as the days go by and we meet 
men upon the right hand and upon 
the left, they say, "I heard upon such 
an occasion the testimony of a Mormon 
Elder. It unsettled my life, it changed 
the trend of my experience, it turned 
me from the course I was pursuing, 
and it brought me to sense that there 
is something in the world aside from 
the struggle for wealth, or for afflu- 
ence, or for place and station among 
men." The Gospel is true. Jesus is in- 
deed the Redeemer of the world. God 
in heaven is our Father. He has res- 
tored His Priesthood and placed it up- 
on the shoulders of men, and, as He 
promised, it will never be taken from 
the earth again, nor will it ever be 
given to another people. The key, the 
power, the authority, the dominion, is 
here; and Almighty God is ratifying 
His promises by His still small voice 
in its declaration of truth among His 
children. To this end I trust that we 
may be faithful to the promises we 
have made to the Almighty, that we 
may reap the reward promised to the 
just, and that we may eventually stand 
in His presence, having been reclaimed 
and brought to a perfect knowledge of 
the principles of everlasting life, is my 
prayer in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

The choir sang the anthem: 

Rouse, O ye mortals, 
The dawn is near. 

Benediction by Elder Lewis, of Ben- 
son stake.

ELDER MATTHIAS F. COWLEY. 

My brethren and sisters, by request 
of Brother Grant I arise to say a few 
words, and I greatly desire to be as- 
sisted by your faith and prayers. I 
always feel my excessive weakness 
when standing in the responsibility of 
a teacher to the Saints, or to the world; 
for I realize that we are not sent to 
teach our own opinions, nor to advance 
any theories that have not come to us 
by revelation from God, and that we 
are not sent to teach even the revela- 
tions of God, except as we are directed 
and inspired by the Holy Spirit. This 
is a condition and obligation that is 
not only required of the authorities of 
the Church, but is a positive com- 
mandment to all who bear the Holy 
Priesthood,' who administer in the 
word of the Lord among the people. 
Neither is it confined to our adminis- 
trations in the way of public speaking 
alone, but every man who officiates in 
any responsibility in the work of God 
should be actuated by the Holy Spirit, 
so that his administrations shall be 
recognized of God, and, being recog- 
nized of God, shall be attended by that 
power which shall make them effective 
among the children of men, that if you 
are rejected by the people it shall stand 
to their condemnation just as much as 
if they had rejected the Savior him- 
self. The Savior taught this doctrine 
most distinctly. He said: "He that 
receiveth you, receiveth me; and he 
that receiveth me, receiveth him that 
sent me." The responsibility of this 
work is of such a nature that we ought 
to be endowed with that superior spir- 
it which belongs to the Gospel of Je- 
sus Christ; in other words, we ought 
to enter into that spirit of solemnity, 
in considering the responsibilities that 
devolve upon us in this work, and 
treat the things of God with that sa- 
credness that attaches unto them. 

I believe a disrespect for the things 
of God is creeping in among the Lat- 
ter-day Saints, a tendency on the part 
of the young people to speak lightly of 
sacred things, and, in some instances, 
to profane the name of Deity. These 
are evils which ought to be corrected 
by the parents in the exercise of their 
influence in the home circle. It ought 



72 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



to be taken up by those connected with 
the Mutual Improvement associations, 
and those in authority in the various 
wards. 

There is a statement in the Doctrine 
and Covenants regarding our respons- 
ibility to our children, which I believe 
I will read a few verses of. You are 
all familiar with it, but it is a res- 
ponsibility which I feel we are derelict 
in meeting, and that is respecting the 
teaching of our children the principles 
of the Gospel in their early childhood, 
so that when they shall attain unto the 
years of accountability and be called up- 
on to enter into the waters af baptism, 
that they shall do so intelligently; not 
because they are coerced by their pa- 
rents, but because they have an intel- 
ligent understanding of the sacredness 
of that ordinance, because the^ have 
come to be imbued with the spirit of 
faith in the Living God, that they be- 
lieve that God lives and that He will 
answer their prayers when they ap- 
proach Him in supplication, and, in 
short, because they have an under- 
standing of the first principles of the 
Gospel. I will read from the 68th sec- 
tion of the Doctrine and Covenants re- 
specting this obligation which devolves 
upon the parents: 

"And again, inasmuch as parents 
have children in Zion, or in any of her 
Stakes, which are organiz:d, that 
teach them not to understand the doc- 
trine of repentance, faith in Christ the 
son of the living God, and of baptism 
and the gift of the Holy Ghot by the 
laying on of hands when eight years 
old, the sins be upon the heads of the 
parents." 

He enunciates it a sin to thus neg- 
lect the sons and daughters tjiat have 
been committed to our care. I take 
this to mean exactly what it says, that 
it is the duty of every father and 
mother to so enlist the interest and 
attention of their children that they 
may call them around the family fire- 
side and indoctrinate them in the prin- 
ciples of the Gospel, the doctrine of re- 
pentance, and the ordinance of baptism, 
by immersion, by the time they are 
eight years old, and also the sacred or- 
dinance of the laying on of hands for 
the gift of the Holy Ghost, and that 
they shall understand it, to a very 
great extent, so that, being thus pre- 



pared when they enter the sacred wa- 
ters of baptism, they are prepared to 
receive the Holy Ghost, and to enjoy His 
administrations, His whisperings and 
His power, that they may grow up in 
the fear of God and in an understand- 
ing of His ways. Now, my brethren and 
sisters, the Lord says: 

"For this shall be a law unto the in- 
habitants of Zion, or in any of her 
stakes which are organized." 

This relevation was given when they 
were about to seek the establishment 
of the City of Zion, concerning which 
we heard something in the Tabernacle 
this morning by President Duffin. From 
this city, the New Jerusalem, the 
stakes- of Zion were to expand, from the 
north to the south and from the east 
to the west, until they should occupy 
this broad land of Joseph, from one 
end of it to the other. This obligation, 
or law, concerning which I have been 
reading, was to be a standing law of 
Zion and to all her stakes upon the 
earth. I leave you, my brethren and 
sisters, to ask yourselves the question 
as to the extent you have met this 
obligation, and to what degree you are 
prepared to stand before God and say 
that you have taught your children to 
exercise faith in God, and have taught 
them the principles of the Gospel speci- 
fied in the revelation. The Lord says, 
in continuing the revelation: 

"And they shall also teach their 
children to pray and to walk uprightly 
before the Lord." 

It has been complained of to us, from 
time to time, that some of our children 
are becoming very indifferent and dis- 
respectful to the arrangements of their 
parents, and that they are found en- 
gaged in hoodlumism on the streets at 
night, and that they stand upon the 
corners of the streets learning to blas- 
pheme the name of the Lord, especial- 
ly in this city, the central city, so to 
speak, of the stakes of Zion, as now 
organized. Little boys, even, are blas- 
pheming the name of Deity. One of 
them stood out here as the congrega- 
tion passed out yesterday, and witness- 
ing some of the people going to some 
of the restaurants for dinner, and, tak- 
ing the name of the Lord in vain, said, 
"Look at the 'hay-seeds.' " These are

the expressions they are learning, and I 
believe, where this state of affairs ex- 
ists, that the parents are not fulfilling 
the obligation enjoined upon them by 
the revelation of God contained in the 
Doctrine and Covenants; for it says: 

\ 

"And they shall also teach their chil- 
dren to pray and to walk uprightly be- 
fore the Lord. 

'And the inhabitants of Zion shall, 
also, observe the Sabbath day to keep 
it holy." 

Now, a statement is given further 
over in this volume concerning the pre- 
siding authorities of the Church, and it 
is a very positive statement, expressing 
the disapproval of the Almighty, be- 
cause the Presidency of the Church did 
not see to the education and training 
of their children in the principles of 
the Gospel as they should have done. 
Brother Taylor read from this revela- 
tion yesterday, showing how we might 
grow from grace to grace in the knowl- 
edge of God, even as did the Messiah, 
by listening to the words of God and 
being controlled and directed by the 
inspiration of the Almighty in our 
duties in life. Now, the Lord said to 
the Presidency of the Church, concern- 
ing our children: 

"Every spirit of man was innocent in 
the beginning, and God having redeem- 
ed man from the fall, men became 
again in their infant state, innocent be- 
fore God. 

"And that wicked one cometh and 
taketh away light and truth, through 
disobedience, from the children of men, 
and because of the tradition of their 
fathers. 

But I have commanded you to bring 
up your children in light and truth; 

"But verily I say unto you, my ser- 
vant Frederick G. Williams, you have 
continued under this comdemnation; 

"You have not taught your children 
light and truth, according to the com- 
mandments, and that wicked one hath 
power, as yet, over you, and this is 
the cause of your affliction." 

Now, my brethren and sisters, let 
us be practical, and ask our- 
selves whether we have taught 
our children light and truth or not. 
We should not be satisfied with the 
Mutual Improvement association, the 
Sunday school, the Primary, and other 
institutions which the Lord, in His 
great mercy, has established in the 
Church for the benefit of our children; 
we cannot justify ourselves in allowing 



these institutions to do all that we 
should feel obligated to do in the educa- 
tion of our children in the principles of 
the Gospel. It is the duty of every 
man and woman to see, just as far as 
possible, that their children are taught 
light and truth, that they are taught to 
pray in their infancy, that they are 
taught to observe the Sabbath day to * 
keep it holy, that they are taught the 
doctrines of virtue and honor before 
God, as being dearer than life itself, 
that they are taught to respect the 
holy Priesthood, that the Priesthood of 
God committed to man upon the earth 
is, as it were, the representation of God 
in the flesh; for God has given the au- 
thority that whatever His servants 
shall do in His name, actuated by the 
inspiration of the Holy Ghost, shall be 
just as binding among the children of 
men as if He had done it Himself. This 
is a great work, my brethren and sis- 
ters, a great responsibility to fulfill 
these obligations in regard to our child- 
ren. It strikes me that, if we do our 
full duty and seek to instruct our 
children and to bring them up in the 
ways of the Lord, there is no time for 
us to join the institutions of the world, 
that there is no time for us to join 
the secret orders of society and look 
after the duties and obligations placed 
upon us by some lodge that has been 
established by the instrumentality of 
men, no matter what their ideas may 
be, for the obligations which are placed 
upon us as Latter-day Saints are so 
broad and extensive that they demand 
all our time and attention and all the 
talents which God has given unto us. 

The Lord extends, in this command- 
ment, concerning which I have just 
read, these injunctions and reproofs to 
President Sidney Rigdon, and also to 
President Joseph Smith, because they 
had been under some condemnation in 
this respect. This being the case with 
them, then, what must be the condem- 
nation resting upon many of us who 
are guilty of neglecting to train and 
teach our children in the principles of 
the Gospel. I do not say that those who 
do their full duty will always have the 
greatest success, for some are rebel- 
lious, even as Laman and Lemuel were 
rebellious to the commandments of God, 
given through their father Lehi; but 



74 . GENERAL © 

inasmuch as Lehi did his full duty, his 
garments are clean, and he is under no 
condemnation for their infidelity and 
rebellion against God, the Eternal 
Father. 

We have been commanded, in these 
last days, to study from the best 
books, to acquire information upon all 
useful subjects, themes that have a 
tendency to qualify us for usefulness in 
the community and in the Church and 
kingdom of God here upon the earth. 
"We. are to seek for wisdom out of the 
best books; and we have been equally 
enjoined, by the living oracles of God 
upon the earth, that we must be care- 
ful as to the character of the literature 
that falls into the hands of our child- 
ren. What they read has its effect 
upon them, whether it be for good or 
for evil. We have learned of a recent 
terrible occurrence in this city, where 
a little boy was influenced to commit 
murder by a wicked man, and the testi- 
mony of his friends was that it was 
brought about through reading dime 
novels and falling into diabolical habits, 
taught by the wicked and ungodly 
among the Latter-day Saints. We 
have the scriptures to read, the reve- 
lations of God. There is nothing so 
edifying as they are, or so instructive. 
We have histories, and works treating 
upon various subjects of usefulness 
that will occupy all the time our child- 
ren have to devote to reading and in- 
forming their minds; and it is a good 
thing for us, my brethren and sisters, 
> to occasionally read the things that are 
written, from time to time, by those 
riot of us, concerning the faith and 
achievements of this people in these 
mountain valleys. 
: I was pleased, the other night, that 
the works of Mr. Charles Ellis, a series 
of pamphlets, were recommended to the 
people. Mr. Ellis, who is not of our 
faith, has been in this city for about 12 
years, and has had the courage to 
stand up and defend the rights of this 
people, from time to time. When 
he first came to Salt Lake City, he 
stood up in the Salt Lake Theater, 
and defended the rights of the 
American Indians against the imposi- 
tions heaped upon them by the 
emissaries of the government. He is 
a man who sympathizes with the weak 
and downtrodden. 



Brother Grant, yesterday, in his in- 
teresting report of the Japanese mis- 
sion, stated that God had raised up 
men in that land to defend him through 
the press, to write articles in defense o£ 
the doctrines, history and character of 
the Latter-day Saints. We ought to 
be sufficiently broad-minded and lib- 
eral, in our associations with men, to- 
give those credit who stand up in our 
defense, or say a good word in defense 
of the rights, and the doctrine and 
character of the Latter-day Saints. 

It would not be becoming in me to 
occupy more of your time, but I wish 
to bear my testimony to the truth. I 
wish to testify that I know that God 
lives, and that Jesus Christ is the 
Savior, and that He visited the earth 
in these last days and restored the Gos- 
pel in all its fulness and power, and 
that I know that Joseph Smith was 
and is a Prophet of God. standing at 
the head of the most glorious of all 
dispensations. I also desire to testify 
that Joseph F. Smith is a Prophet of 
God, and that he is guided in his ad- 
ministrations by the spirit of revela- 
tion from on high. 

I felt to rejoice at this conference 
that the opportunity has been extend- 
ed to the Stake Presidents and soma 
of the Bishops to take part in the pro- 
ceedings of this conference; also in 
listening to the remarks of the Seven 
Presidents of the Seventies, who are 
men of God, filled with the inspiration 
and power of the Holy Ghost, as well 
as in listening to what has been said 
by the Presidents of the missions of 
the United States, who have made such 
glorious reports of their labors among 
the inhabitants of this great land. I 
rejoice in all these things, my brethren 
and sisters, and desire to be thankful. 

I ask an interest in your faith and 
prayers, for while we are called upon 
to stand in responsible positions, we 
desire and need to be sustained by your 
faith and prayers. We are weak, and 
are mortals, and I know that there is 
power in the hands of the people of 
God to draw out the blessings of the 
Almighty upon His servants; and I do 
not know but there is power in the 
hands of the people to close up those 
blessings. 

I desire to refer to a verse or two 
in the 29th chapter of the Book of 



ELDER JOHN W. TAYLOR. 



7.") 



Alma, and then I will sit down. He 
said: 

"O that I were an angel, and could 
have the wish of mine heart, that I 
might go forth and speak with the 
trump of God, with a voice to shake 
the earth, and cry repentance unto ev- 
ery people." 

I want to say to you that the most 
important doctrine to be taught to the 
people, both among the Latter-day 
Saints, and those who are not Latter- 
day Saints, is the doctrine of repent- 
ance. The Prophet continues: 

"Yea, I would declare unto every 
soul, as with the voice of thunder, re- 
pentance, and the plan of redemption, 
that they should repent and come unto 
our God. that there might not be more 
sorrow upon all the face of the earth. 

"But behold, I am a man, and do sin 
in my wish; for I ought to be content 
with the things which the Lord hath 
allotted unto me. 

"I ought not to harrow up in my de- 
sires, the firm decree of a just God, 
for I know that he granteth unto men 
according to their desire, whether it 
be unto death or unto life; yea, I know 
that he allotteth unto men, according 
to their wills; whether they be unto 
salvation or unto destruction. 

"Yea, and I know that good and evil 
have come before all men; or he that 
knoweth not good from evil is blame- 
less; but he that knoweth good and 
evil, to him it is given according to his 
desires; whether he desireth trood or 
evil, life or death, joy or remorse of 
conscience. 

"Now seeing that I know , these things 
why should I desire more than to per- 
form the work to which I have been 
called? 

"Why should I desire that I was an 
angel, that I could speak unto all the 
ends of the earth? 

"For, behold, the Lord doth grant un- 
to all nations, of their own nation and 
tongue, to teach his word; yea, in wis- 
dom, all he seeth fit that they should 
have; therefore, we see that the Lord 
doth counsel in wisdom, according to 
that which is just and true." 

Now, my brethren and sisters, God 
bless you, and help us to remember 
these things and to put them into 
practice, and that we may say, as 
Joshua said: "As for me and my house, 
we will serve the Lord." 

ELDER JOHN W. TAYLOR. 

My brethren and sisters, the order 
of the day is short speeches. I pray 
that while I am standing before you I 
may enjoy the spirit of the Lord also. 



During one of my recent visits to 
one of our Stake conferences a very 
remarkable circumstance happened, 
which I desire to refer to this after- 
noon. One of our brethren there, who 
held the Holy Priesthood, thought he 
had discovered a power that was 
greater than the Priesthood, and had 
begun to exercise this power among 
the people. He called this power which 
he had graduated in, hypnotism. He 
went to the Bishop of his ward and 
suggested that he take lessons from 
him, for, said he, "Bishop, you can 
just cast a spell over the people 
and make them do just as you please." I 
desire to talk a little this afternoon 
with reference to this evil. It would 
astonish you to know, my brethren and 
sisters, how many of the Latter-day 
Saints are taking up with this vrinci- 
ple of hypnotism, with Christian Sci- 
ence, and how many are following af- 
ter wizards and those that have fa- 
miliar spirits, and goins, to palmists to 
get their hands read, and all this sort 
of thing. Now i will tell you why 1 
came to talk upon this subject. It 
was the remark of Brother Cowley, 
that we teach nothing but what ifc 
given by revelation from God, thfc 
Eternal Father. I am going to read 
a little to you from the 13th Chapter of 
Deuteronomy. 

"If there arise among you a prophet, 
or a dreamer of dreams, and giveth 
thee a sign or a wonder, 

•'And the sign or the wonder comt 
to pass, whereof he spake unto thee, 
saying, Let us go after other gods, 
which thou hast not known, and let us. 
serve them; 

"Thou shalt not hearken unto the 
words of that prophet, or that dreamer 
of dreams: for the Lord your God 
proveth you, to know whether ye love 
the Lord your God with all your heart 
and with ali your soul. 

"Ye shall walk after the Lord your 
God, and fear Him, and keep His com- 
mandments, and obey His voice, and ye 
phall serve him, and cleave unto him. 

"And that prophet, or that dreamer 
of dreams, shall be put to death; be- 
cause he hath spoken to turn you away 
from the Lord your God, which brought 
you out of the land of Egypt, and re- 
deemed you out of the house of bond- 
age, to thrust thee out of the way 
which the Lord thy God commanded 
thee to walk in: So shalt thou put the 
evil away from the midst of thee."

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Notice the severity of the punish- 
ment to be given to this class of peo- 
ple; for they were to be put to death. 

"If thy brother, the son of thy moth- 
er, or thy son, or thy daughter, or the 
wife of thy bosom, or thy friend, which 
is as thine own soul, entice thee secret- 
ly, saying, Let us go and serve other 
gods, which thou hast not known, thou, 
nor thy fathers; 

"Namely, of the gods of the people 
which are round about you, nigh unto 
thee, or far off from thee, from the one 
end of the earth even unto the other 
end of the earth; 

"Thou shalt not consent unto him, 
nor hearken unto him; neither shall 
thine eye pity him, neither shalt thou 
spare, neither shalt thou conceal him; 

"But thou shalt surely kill him; thine 
hand shall be first upon him to put 
him to death, and afterwards the hand 
of all the people. 

"And thou shalt stone him with 
atones, that he die; because he hath 
sought to thrust thee away from the 
Lord thy God, which brought thee out 
of the land of Egypt, from the house 
of bondage. 

"And all Israel shall hear, and fear, 
and shall do no more any such wicked- 
ness as this is among you. 

"If thou shalt hear say in one of thy 
cities, which the Lord thy God hath 
given thee to dwell there, saying, 

"Certain men, the children of Belial, 
are gone out from among you, and have 
withdrawn the inhabitants of their city, 
saying, Let us go and serve other gods, 
which ye have not known; 

"Then shalt thou inquire, and make 
search, and ask diligently; and, behold, 
if it be truth, and the thing certain, 
that such abomination is wrought 
among you; 

"Thou shalt surelj' smite the inhabi- 
ants of that city with the edge of the 
sword, destroying it utterly, and all 
that is therein, and the cattle thereof, 
with the edge of the sword. 

"And thou shalt gather all the spoil 
of it into the midst of the street there- 
of, and shalt burn with Are the city, 
and all the spoil thereof every whit, 
for the Lord thy God: and it shall be 
an heap for ever; it shall not be built 
again. 

"And there shall cleave nought of the 
cursed thing to thine hand: that the 
Lord may turn from the fierceness of 
His anger, and shew thee mercy, and 
have compassion upon thee, and multi- 
ply thee, as He hath sworn unto thy 
lathers; 

"When thou shalt hearken to the 
voice of the Lord thy God, to keep all 
his commandments which I command 
thee this day, to do that which is right 
in the eyes of the Lord thy God." 

This was a revelation given to Moses 
the Prophet, by the Lord our God, 
concerning those who would go after 



idolatry and after those having fa- 
miliar spirits, who would seek to turn 
chem away from the Lord our God. I 
want to tell you that the Lord has not 
revealed a principle of hypnotism 
among the children of men. Hypnotism 
is simply a power by which a man can 
oxercise an influence over his fellows, 
an unrighteous dominion, which is con- 
trary to the commandments of God. 
There are a number of men and women 
among this people today who are exer- 
cising an unrighteous dominion, in this 
manner, among the Latter-day Saints. 
I want to life up my voice and say, 
that it is an abomination in the sight 
of the Lord our God. I may read, to 
advantage, a few words from the Doc- 
trine and Covenants. Speaking of 
satan, it says: 

"Wherefore he maketh war with the 
Saints of God, and encompasses them 
round about. 

"And we saw a vision of 
the sufferings of those with whom 
he made war and overcame, for thus 
came the voice of the L6rd unto U3. 

"Thus saith the Lord, concerning all 
those who know my power, and have 
been made partakers thereof, and suf- 
fered themselves, through the power of 
the devil, to be overcome, and to deny 
the truth and defy my power— 

"They are they who are the sons 
of perdition, of whom I say that it had 
been better for them never to have 
been born." 

That includes those who seek to ex- 
ercise tinrighteous dominion over the 
souls of the children of men, who have 
been overcome by evil influence and 
evil spirits. 

Now, this person to whom I referred, 
stated to the Bishop that he had dis- 
covered something that would help 
him, that was beyond the power of the 
Priesthood which he held, and that, if 
he (the Bishop) would take lessons in 
this art of hypnotism, as he called it, 
he would be able to cast a spell over 
his congregation and they would do 
what he wanted them to do. 
Supposing this Bishop had done 
what had been suggested to him, he 
vould have come under condemnation 
in the sight of God, because he would 
have been exercising unrighteous do- 
minion, and would have permitted him- 
self to have been overcome by the pow- 
er of the devil, and would, therefore, 
become a son of perdition, as I have 



ELDER JOHN W. TAYLOR.

read to you. Now, in conformity with 
this principle Brother Cowley has just 
given, that we teach nothing but that 
which is given by revelation from God, 
let me ask you, has any such princi- 
ple "as hypnotism been given by rev- 
elation, or has it been approved of by 
the Presidency of the Church? No, it 
has not, and it is not right for us to 
engage in the exercise of these powers, 
or in anything of that character that is 
not authorized by the Gospel of Christ; 
for the Gospel, as Paul says, "Is the 
power of God unto salvation, to every 
one that believeth; to the Jew first, and 
also to the Greek. For therein is the 
righteousness of God revealed from 
faith to faith, as it is written, "The just 
shall live by faith." 

I will read a little further from the 
Doctrine and Covenants, concerning 
these sons of perdition: 

"For they are vessels of wrath, 
doomed to suffer the wrath of God, 
with the devil and his angels in eter- 
nity; 

"Concerning whom I have said there 
is no forgiveness in this world nor in 
the world to come." 

My brethren and sisters, one-half of 
the world today is filled with idolaters, 
for the reason that men, in the various 
ages of the world, permitted themselves 
to be led by those having familiar spir- 
its, and they wandered away from the 
truth. Here is Elder Grant, who has 
just come from Japan, a nation of 
idolaters; there is that great empire of 
China, containing over 265 mil ions of 
people, who are worshipers of idols. 
How did they get into this condition? 
Because they wandered away from the 
teachings and revelations of God. There 
is nothing that can break through this 
darkness of ages and enlighten their 
minds, excepting it be a new revelation 
from the Eternal Father. 

We have had a number of younj; 
men go east to study medicine and oth- 
er branches of knowledge, and some of 
them have come back, not only as grad- 
uates in the science they studied, but 
as professors of hypnotism. I say it 
is not of God, and is an abomination 
in His sight, and if they do not repent 
of their sins, as sure as God lives, the 
judgments spoken of in the revelation, 
from which I have read, will come up- 
on them, and they will wander away in- 



to darkness, and will not be acknowl- 
edged of the Lord. I want to advise 
the young ladies, while upon this sub- 
ject, not to follow after peep-stone wo- 
men, fortune-tellers, or those claiming 
to have a familiar spirit, to get them 
to tell .you the kind of a husband you 
will marry, or you young men the kind 
of a wife you will get. I will tell you 
where to go; go to the "Patriarch of the 
Church, who holds the blessings of 
God's people in his hands, and what- 
ever he seals on earth will be sealed 
in heaven. If you will keep the com- 
mandments of God and live your re- 
ligion, the Lord will bless you. 

Elder Cowley desires me to read the 
following upon this subject, (Isaiah, 
Chap. 8)." 

"And when they shall say unto you, 
seek unto them that have familiar spir- 
its, and unto wizards that peep 
and that mutter; should not 
a people seek unto their God 
for the living to the dead? 

"To the law and to the testimony; if 
they speak not according to this word, 
it is because there is no light in them. 

"And they shall pass through it 
hardly bestead and hungry: and it shall 
come to pass, that, when they shall be 
hungry, they shall fret themselves and 
curse their king and their God, and 
look upward. 

"And they shall look unto the earth; 
rind behold trouble and darkness, dim- 
riess of anguish; and they shall be 
driven to darkness." 

Now, my brethren and sisters, this 
has been literally fulfilled upon the 
idolatrous nations of the earth. Let 
us not be deceived, my brethren and 
sisters, or lead astray by those who are 
muttering and seeking to give the peo- 
ple a little temporal satisfaction, for 
it will result in incurring the displeas- 
ure of God upon us. 

I will read a little more from the book 
of Doctrine and Covenants. I want to 
say that any theory or doctrine that 
brings destruction upon the souls of 
the children of men is not from God, 
hut is from satan, the father of all lies 
from the beginning. In the beginning 
he suggested a plan whereby he would 
oblige the children of men to keep the 
commandments of God; but the Savior 
wanted to do the will of the Father, 
and the Father wanted His children to . 
have their free agency and to work 
out their individual salvation, through 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



obedience to the laws and ordinances 
of the Gospel; and the Father has said, 
as contained in the Doctrine and Cov- 
enants: 

"That the rights of the Priesthood are 
inseparably connected with the pow- 
ers of heaven, and that the powers of 
heaven cannot be controlled nor hand- 
led only upon the principles of righte- 
ousness." 

Is a man acting in accordance with 
the laws of the Gospel in endeavoring 
to cast a spell over the people? No, 
it is not of God. It says: 

"That they may be conferred upon us, 
U is true, but when we undertake to 
rover our sins, or to gratify our pride, 
our vain ambition, or to exercise con- 
trol, or dominion, or compulsion, upon 
the souls of the children of men, in any 
degree of unrighteousness, behold, the 
heavens withdraw themselves; the 
Spirit of the Lord is grieved; and when 
it is withdrawn, amen to the Priest- 
hood, or the authority of that man." 

"We read, in the papers, almost week- 
ly, of people being accused of casting 
spells over our sons and daughters and 
leading them astray. Is it not time 
that someone was standing up and 
speaking in plainness regarding these 
rvils? I will read a little further. 

"No power or influence can or ought 
to be maintained by virtue of the 
Priesthood, only by persuasion, by long 
suffering, by gentleness, and meekness, 
and by love unfeigned; 

"By kindness, and pure knowledge, 
which shall greatly enlarge the soul 
without hypocrisy, and without guile." 

This is the spirit of the Gospel. It 
pays: 

"Let thy bowels also be full of char- 
ity towards all men, and to the house- 
hold of faith, and let virtue garnish 
thy thoughts unceasingly, then shall 
thy confidence wax strong in the pres- 
fnce of God, and the doctrine of the 
Priesthood shall distil upon thy soul as 
the dews from heaven. 

"The Holy Ghost shall be thy con- 
stant companion, and thy sceptre an 
unchanging sceptre of righteousness 
find truth, and thy dominion shall be an 
c-verlasting dominion, and without com- 
pulsory means it shall flow unto thee 
for ever and ever." 

God bless you, my brethren and sis- 
ters, that you may walk in the straight 
and narrow path, and not yield to the 
influences of evil spirits, but that you 
thall be guided by the influence and in- 
spiration of the Holy Spirit, which will 
lead you unto eternal life. May God 



grant that this may be our lot, is my 
prayer, in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

The General Authorities were pre- 
sented and unanimously sustained by 
vote of the assemblage.

ELDER ABRAHAM O. WOODRUFF. 

My beloved brethren and sisters, 
I thought I was quite a rap- 
id speaker myself, but Brother 
Grant (who has just presented 
the general authorities of the Church) 
has so outdistanced me that It has 
made me a little nervous. 

I have rejoiced exceedingly in the 
spirit of this great conference, which is 
now drawing to a close. 

Much has been said, during the gen- 
eral meetings of this conference, in re- 
gard to looking after the young of our 
community. As I am a young man my- 
self, and have the* same feelings, to a 
great extent, that other young men in 
our midst have, I desire to say a few 
words to the Latter-day Saints in re- 
gard to the way they approach their 
sons and daughters with reference to 
some of these matters that have been 
mentioned, and, in doing so, I do not 
wish to declare, or to be understood as 
proclaiming, that there are conditions 
existing among our people that ought 
not to exist; for I believe we are freer 
from the vices, crimes and evils which 
exist in the world than any other peo- 
ple to be found on the face of the earth. 
I am not inclined to take a pessimistic 
view of humanity, and, thus far, have 
been able to recognize some good in 
the efforts and acts of men. I believe, 
as Elder Douglas M. Todd expressed 
himself at. one of our conferences lately, 
that we ought to preach the Gospel us- 
ing ten words of commendation and in- 
struction where we would use one of 
condemnation. I also think it is not a 
good thing for the Latter-day Saint 
parents to doubt the integrity or hones- 
ty of their children. Personally, I can- 
not conceive of anything that could have 
shaken my faith more in my parents 
or associates, when a boy, than to have 
had them ask me something regarding 
myself, or regarding anything, and then

■have them doubt my answer. I believe 
it would be better for the parents to en- 
quire of their sons and daughters in 
regard to their habits, and, in nine 
-cases out of ten, they will tell you the 
truth. 

My brethren and sisters, I believe 
that, in the vast majority of cases, 
where fathers or mothers will sit down 
with their sons and their daughters 
and question them in regard to their 
past conduct, they will be honest and 
frank with those fathers and mothers, 
and tell them the truth. I have that 
much faith in humanity, and I do not 
want anyone to be suspicious of me; if 
they want to know anything regarding 
my past life, I want them to ask me, 
and, with the help of the Lord, I will 
tell them the truth. I believe there are a 
number of young men in the Church 
who feel exactly the same way, and 
that they are not afraid to have their 
fathers and mothers become acquainted 
with their past; but the trouble is, or 
bas been, in many instances, that the 
parents have not been as companionable 
with their sons and daughters as they 
ought to have been. They have pushed 
them away, rather than drawn them to 
them. 

I feel doubly interested in this matter, 
my brethren and sisters, for I believe 
that we have a good young people, and 
I do not wish to magnify their faults, 
which exist, perhaps, to a greater de- 
gree than they ought. I believe that 
the burden of the responsibility for the 
secret crimes and vices, which it is re- 
ported are making headway among our 
people, rests upon the heads of the fa- 
thers and mothers, from the fact that 
they have not cautioned their sons and 
daughters against such things. If the 
parents want to rid themselves of this 
responsibility, let them remember, and 
put into practice, the passage Elder 
Cowley read in your hearing here, plac- 
ing the responsibility where it belongs, 
at least until children come to be of 
that age that they are adit <o judge be- 
tween good and evil. My brethren and 
sisters, if you cannot teach your child- 
ren and bring them up in the knowledge 
of the Gospel in the spirit of kindness, 
as stated in the revelation in the Doc- 
trine and Covenants, from which Elder 
Taylor has just read — if you cannot turn 



them from evil with the spirit of kind- 
ness and persuasion, and by reasoning 
with them, you cannot do it by force. 

I firmly believe that ignorance is the 
mother of crime, and that if any one 
who has sinned knew the results 
of wrong-doing, they would not have 
done so with their eyes open; for I be- 
lieve it is due to our ignorance of the re- 
sults of wrong-doing, our ignorance of 
the consequence that will surely over- 
take us for committing wrong. Inas- 
much as the glory of God is intelli- 
gence, let us see to it that we try, in an 
intelligent manner, and in the spirit of 
love and kindness to make plain to the 
young men and young women of Zion 
the terrible consequences of wrong do- 
ing, and see to it that they are warned; 
then if they go astray, their blood will 
not be required at the hands of their 
parents. 

God bless you, brethren and sisters. I 
Anow that you are all anxious to hear 
from Brother Grant; he may not be 
with us at our next conference. I pray 
God's blessings upon you and all Israel, 
in this matter of which I have spoken; 
may we go at it in the proper way, 
and not do more harm than good in en- 
deavoring to follow out what has been 
said, but that we may be governed al- 
ways by the spirit of the Gospel of the 
Lord Jesus Christ. I ask it for Christ's 
sake. Amen. 

ELDER HEBER J. GRANT. 

I am delighted, as I stated here this 
morning, and yesterday in the Taber- 
nacle, to be with you. I have rejoiced, 
beyond my power to tell, in the rich 
outpourings of the Holy Spirit upon 
those who have spoken. 

I endorse all that has been said here 
this afternoon. I also bear my testi- 
mony, in connection with that of Apos- 
tle Cowley, that if we will study the 
section of the Doctrine and Covenants, 
from which he has read to us this 
afternoon, and get the spirit of the 
Lord, and teach our children in their 
youth, that God will bless us with influ- 
ence, and that our children will grow 
up with a love for the Gospel. Let us 
teach our children by example as well 
as by precept. When we earn a dollar 
let us pay ten cents as tithing; when 



so 



GENERAL, CONFERENCE. 



we give the children a dollar tell them 
to pay ten cents to the Lord. Let us 
see that they go regularly to their 
Sunday Schools, their Primaries and 
their Mutual Improvement associations, 
and, in this way, they will get Inter- 
ested and learn to love the work of the 
Lord; their time and talents will be 
occupied, and they will have no time to 
waste with those things that are of no 
good. I have heard men and women 
say that they were going to let their 
sens and daughters grow to maturity 
before they sought to teach them the 
principles of the Gospel, that they were 
not going to cram the Gospel down, 
them in their childhood, before they 
were able to comprehend it. When I 
hear men and women say this, I think 
they are lacking faith in the principles 
of the Gospel and do not comprehend 
it" as they should. The Lord has said 
it is our duty to teach our children 
in their youth, and I prefer to take His 
words for it rather than the words of 
those who are not obeying His com- 
mandments. It is folly to imagine that 
our children will grow up with a knowl- 
edge of the Gospel without teaching. 
Some men and women argue, "Well, I 
am a Latter-day Saint, my wife is a 
Latter-day Saint, and we were married 
in the temple, and were sealed over the 
altar by one having the Priesthood of 
God, according to the new and ever- 
lasting covenant, and our children are 
bound to grow up and be good Latter- 
day Saints; they cannot help it; it is 
born in them." I have learned the 
multiplication table, and so has my 
wife; but do you think I am big- 
enough fool to believe that our chil- 
dren will be born with a knowledge of 
the multiplication table? I may know 
that the Gospel is true, and so may my 
wife; but I want to tell you that our 
children will not know that the Gospel 
is true, unless they study it and gain 
a testimony for themselves. Parents 
are deceiving themselves In imagining 
that their children will be born with a 
knowledge of the Gospel. Of course, 
they will have greater claim upon the 
blessings of God, being born under the 
new and everlasting covenant, and it 
will come natural for them to grow up 
and perform their duties; but the devil 
realizes this, and is therefore seeking 



all the harder to lead our children from 
the truth. 

I endorse, with all my heart, the re- 
marks made here by Brother Taylor. 
In talking to the Latter-day Saints, 
there is no revelation in all the Doc- 
trine and Covenants that I have quot- 
ed from so often as that contained in 
section 121, from which Elder Taylor 
has just been reading: That "No pow- 
er or influence can or ought to be 
maintained by virtue of the Priesthood, 
only by persuasion, by long suffering, 
by gentleness, and meekness, and by 
love unfeigned." There is no danger of 
a Priesthood of this kind — gentleness, 
and meekness, and love unfeigned. But 
when we exercise the power of the 
Priesthood, as Brother Taylor has read, 
to "Gratify our pride, our vain ambi- 
tion, or to exercise control, or domin- 
ion.or compulsion, upon the souls of the 
children of men, in any degree of un- 
righteousness, behold, the heavens 
withdraw themselves; the Spirit of the 
Lord is grieved; and when it is with- 
drawn, Amen to the Priesthood, or the 
authority of that man." These are 
the words of God. I am reminded of 
a man that lost the apostleship. Time 
and time again he quoted the above to 
the people, but he did not abide by it 
himself. He failed to sustain the 
Priesthood and exercised unrighteous 
dominion over those under him. 

My brethren and sisters, if we will 
study the Scriptures, the plan of life 
and salvation, keeping the command- 
ments of the Lord, all the promises that 
have been made will be fulfilled upon 
our heads, and we will grow and in- 
crease in light, knowledge and intelli- 
gence. There is no such thing as 
standing still. The Church is 
not standing still; we have 
the evidence today of its growth, 
of its increased tithes, the increased 
results of the missionary work all over 
the world, and the increased efficiency 
of the work in the colleges, the Latter- 
day Saints' university and academies. 
There has also been a wonderful growth 
in the Sabbath schools. The work of 
God is progressing, and the power and 
influence of the adversary and those 
who are working against us are waning. 
We find, for instance, that the forces 
that used to work against us in Wash- 



ELDER HEBER J. GRANT.

Jngton, seeking to take from us our 
Tights and liberty, have disappeared; 
»nd many of the men that were active 
and full of bitterness toward the Lat- 
ter-day Saints have learned to respect 
and honor them, and are willing to 
speak a good word for them. I want 
to say to you that I never enjoyed a 
little speech more in all my life than 
that of Robert N. Baskin, one of the 
supreme court judges, at Saltair, on 
the birthday of our late Prest. Brigham 
Young, last June. I rejoiced exceeding- 
ly to hear Judge Baskin paying a high 
tribute to the pioneers and to Prest. 
Brigham Young. He is not the only 
honest, straight-forward man who was 
once very much opposed to the Latter- 
day Saints, who today takes pleasure in 
bearing testimony as to the honor and 
integrity of the Mormon people. 

I rejoice in the great growth of the 
Church, in fulfillment of the prophecy 
of the Prophet Joseph Smith, that the 
Latter-day Saints should be driven, and 
many put to death by their persecutors, 
and others lose their lives in conse- 
quence of exposure and disease; and 
that some should live to go to the 
Rocky mountains and assist in building 
settlements and cities, live to see the 
Saints become a mighty people in the 
midst of the Rocky mountains. I re- 
joice that we have become a mighty 
people. The growth of the Latter-day 
Saints, in view of all the oDnosition and 
persecution against the people, is sim- 
ply marvelous, and we are being looked 
upon in wonder and amazement by in- 
telligent people. 

Elder Grant referred to the necessity 
of the Latter-day Saints listening to 
and following the inspiration of the 
Lord, as it came through the head of 
the Church. Gave as an illustration 
the wonderful success of the Utah 
Sugar company. Mentioned the fact 
that the stockholders of this com- 
pany had recently sold a half 
interest on a basis of a profit of over 
a million dollars above the original 
eost. Spoke of the discouragements at 
the time the industry was being start- 
ed, Defore the factory was built; that 



he and his associate Apostles felt that 
the industry would not be successful, 
and begged President Woodruff to pay 
the agreed forfeit of $50,000, rather than 
to build the factory. President Wood- 
ruff s^id that he had followed the light 
and inspiration of the Spirit all his 
life, and that there was light ahead in 
building the factory, but that it ap- 
peared dark to him to abandon the en- 
terprise; and, notwithstanding the fi- 
nancial distress of the Church, and 
many of the leading members of the 
Church, at that time, he insisted that 
the enterprise should be carried out. 
To Wiil'ord Woodruff, because of the 
inspiration of the Lord to him, more 
credit is due than to any other man for 
the success of this enterprise, and the 
people can thank him that they are now 
dividing over a million dollars of prof- 
it, to say nothing about the wonder- 
ful increase in the value of farming 
lands ii the vicinity of the factory, and 
the benefits derived because of the 
erection of other factories, which prob- 
ably would never have been built had 
it not been for the success attending 
the Utah sugar factory. After President 
Woodruff had given his opinion, under 
the inspiration of the Lord, the Apos- 
tles labored with all zeal and energy to 
promote this industry, many of them 
borrowing large sums of money to in- 
vest, having confidence in the in- 
spiration of the Lord through the 
Prophet of God. Their example is 
worthy of the emulation of the Latter- 
day Saints. 

Gol bless you, my brethren and sis- 
ters. God bless all the institutions of 
Zion, and help us, one and all, to be 
true and faithful, to be diligent in the 
performance of our duties, and to set 
an example worthy of the imitation of 
the world. May God help us to do this, 
and to teach our children, that they 
may be exalted with us in the Celestial 
kingdom of God, is my prayer, in the 
name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

AT THE TABERNACLE. 

Closing session, 2 p. m.

John. 
The anthem:

PATRIARCH JOHN SMITH. 

My brethren and sisters, it is with 
peculiar feelings that I stand before 
you. For one reason, I was not ex- 
pecting to occupy this position; but I 
trust, by your faith and prayers I may 
say something which will be of bene- 
fit, not only to you, but to myself. I 
can bear testimony to the truth of that 
which we have heard thus far during 
this conference. I can bear testimony 
that the Spirit of the Lord has been 
with us, and has guided those who 
have spoken to us. I trust that we as 
Latter-day Saints, will treasure up in 
our minds that which we have heard, 
and carry it with us to our homes, that 
it may abide with us and guide our ac- 
tions in the future. I can bear testi- 
mony that this is the work of God, and 
that we are His people. So far as we 
will follow the instructions we receive 
from those who are set to preside, and 
be guided by our Father in h aven, I 
know that His blessings will rest upon 
us. If we will strive to do our duty, 
live our religion, and conduct ourselves 
in that way that shall be pleasing unto 
our Father in heaven, all will be well 
with us. I know that my Redeemer 
lives, and that Jesus is the Christ, and 
that if we will do our duty as Latter- 
day Saints we will reap the reward 
which our Father has in store for us. 
I feel to exhort my brethren and sisters 
to faithfulness and to diligence; for we 
understand that every Latter-day Saint 
has certain known duties to perform. 
We realize that it is our duty to re- 
member our prayers, to pay our tithes 
and offerings, and to do unto others as 
we would wish them to do unto us un- 
der like circumstances. But if I have 
a hobby, it is what I have said in times 
past: I feel to exhort my young breth- 
ren to faithfulness, to diligence of 



duty, to prepare themselves by study 
and by attending the Mutual improve- 
ment associations, and striving to in- 
form their minds at home, that when 
they are called to labor in the minis- 
try they may go forward enabled to 
perform that duty unto which they may 
be called; for I realize, from many cir- 
cumstances I have seen, that often- 
times our boys, although they are hon- 
est and willing to do their duty, have 
neglected to prepare themselves for the 
ministry, so much so that when they 
get into the field they are at a lost,, 
and it takes them sometime before 
they can commence to do that amount 
of good that they would do from the 
start if they informed their minds be- 
fore they left home. I feel to strive to 
know my duty and to perform the same 
in that way and manner that shall 
meet the approval of my Father in 
heaven. I desire an interest in the 
prayers of the Saints, that I may be 
able to fill my mission in honor and 
accomplish the work whereunto my 
Father in heaven has called me. May 
the blessings of our Father rest upon 
all Isreal, and guide us in the true 
path, that when we have finished our 
course we may be worthy of the bless- 
ings which He has promised us, is may 
prayer in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

PRESIDENT BRIGHAM YOUNG. 

The time to favor Zion come-— Prnpheti' declara- 
tions fulfilled — Evidence of GrO'P- har d over 
the Saints — Ma-lyrdnm of Joseph and Hyrum 

This is a day of rejoicing, and I feel 
to bless the name of my Redeemer for 
the privilege - that I have of meeting 
with the Latter-day Saints in this con- 
ference. It is not often that we behold 
so many of our people assembled to- 
gether as we witness this day, beneath 
this roof. God is exceedingly merciful 
unto the Latter-day Saints, and I am 
satisfied that prosperity and peace will 
dwell in their midst, as long as they 
observe to keep His commandments. 
The set time has come to favor Zion. 
Zion has been favored all the days that 
I remember in this life. Though driven 
and peeled by our enemies, God has 
sustained us, and we have grown, and 
enlarged, and built up the country, and 
become a great people. I have often 
heard the brethren prophesy of the day 



PRESIDENT BRIGHAM YOUNG.

which we now behold — that the few 
who were gathered here upon a ten- 
acre block would multiply, others 
would gather in, and a great people 
would be established in these moun- 
tains. How speedily have these words 
been fulfilled! God is blessing the peo- 
ple. We witness it upon every hand; 
and if we continue to grow in grace 
and in the knowledge of the truth 
as it is in Him, this people will soon 
be the head, not the tall; for virtue, 
uprightness, honesty and continuity of 
purpose will bring the honest and the 
pure to the head of the whole world. 
I know something about the condition 
of the nations, our own nation included. 
The wickedness that is abroad in the 
land is a reproach to the United States. 
It is a reproach to us that wickedness 
should prevail to the extent that it 
does. But as true as there is a God 
in heaven, the Latter-day Saints — not 
the latter-day sinners, but the Latter- 
day Saints— and the pure who do not 
claim to be Latter-day Saints, will rise 
up and be the head of this nation. I 
do not say that we are a government 
within a government. We are one with 
our parent government. But purity, 
excellency and honesty are sure to bring 
a people to the front. God designs it, 
and it will come to pass. 

I feel to bless this people with all 
my heart and soul. I feel to bless every 
man and woman, of whatever land or 
religious denomination they may be, 
who feel to exalt Christ and Him cruci- 
fied, and who preach this doctrine for 
the salvation of the human family. God 
help them; God help us. When the 
record is written and published that 
this people have made, under the guid- 
ance of inspired men, it will equal if 
not surpass any record that the people 
of God have ever made on this globe. 
It is a testimony in and of itself that 
should convince all men who are ac- 
quainted with it, that the people are 
guided by the hand of Jehovah. But 
there is something beyond this to the 
Latter-day Saints. Who is there in this 
congregation that has the living tes- 
timony and the fire of the Spirit of God 
in them? Brethren and sisters, answer 
that yourselves. Have I that testimony 
in me? Have you that testimony in 
you? It is the priceless gem that God 



bestows upon His anointed, and upon 
His sons and daughters who seek Him 
with undivided hearts. I know that 
this people have it, because I see and 
feel it. The inspiring influences of that 
Spirit are in the midst of this people; 
and we are bound to succeed, because 
there is no power that can resist the 
influences of that Spirit and the reve- 
lations of God. Never in the history 
of this people will evil come upon them, 
unless they forsake their Redeemer. 
Never will sickness, death or anything 
come in your homes, but what God de- 
signs it for the benefit, the upbuilding 
and enlarging of the dominion of the 
Latter-day Saints. We have control 
over sickness — how far? Are there any 
deaths among us? There are, and good 
people die; but there is something in 
this that is far beyond my understand- 
ing; for I remember the time well when 
our Prophet Joseph Smith and our Pa- 
triarch Hyrum Smith — two of the no- 
blest men that ever stood upon the 
earth — rode to their death. They went 
to death at Carthage. What for? To 
leave the people without a shepherd? 
To leave us there in the midst of our 
enemies, trembling and like lost sheep? 
Oh, no! They went to seal their testi- 
mony with their blood, which cannot 
be refuted by all the world. They 
gave their lives to sustain this work, 
and it was necessary, according to the 
revelations that we have received. Are 
we any better than they? Are we any 
better than Christ? No. If God per- 
mits a thing, shall we complain at it? 
But I do testify to you this day that 
nothing will come to me, nothing will 
come to you, to your families, or to 
anything that God has given you, but 
what you will acknowledge His hand in 
it, and it will be for your salvation and 
the salvation of your families. I know 
it because God is doing this work. He 
has the issues of life and death in His 
hands, and I know that when these 
things occur, His hand is in them, if 
we are living right before Him; and 
there is no power beneath the earth nor 
above the earth that can check this, 
handiwork of the Almighty for the up- 
lifting, guiding and consolidating of 
His people. These things are hard to 
bear; but, brethren and sisters, I say 
to you as I say to myself; in rr>' pray- 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



ers every day I acknowledge His hand 
in all things, because I know He has 
my welfare at heart, come life or death, 
poverty, riches, persecution, or what- 
ever it is. The Church of Christ will 
rise; the kingdom of God will burst 
forth, His purposes will be accom- 
plished, and the exaltation of the faith- 
ful will be assured, and no one can hin- 
der it. 

I testify of these things unto you. I 
would like to talk a little longer, but 
there is no time; indeed I am not able 
to talk more. But I want to bless the 
people. I_want you to hear my voice, 
for it is not stilled yet. I want you to 
hear me say, God bless you, brethren 
and sisters, and all the Latter-day 
Saints, from the center to the extremi- 
ties. God be with the people. He is 
with them, and He will continue to be. 
We need not to fear famine, nor drouth, 
nor grasshoppers, nor insects of any 
kind; we need not to fear any foemen, 
nor any weapon. Pear God, and Him 
only; for He will bear us oft victorious 
under all circumstances. We will live 
and grow and become better, and rise 
higher and become nobler and more 
efficient in our labors, if we serve Him 
with undivided hearts. God grant that 
this may be the case with all of us; 
that we may never shirk a duty, nor 
turn pale nor our knees tremble before 
our enemies. May He give us the 
Spirit of the Lord, and much of it, to 
send the Gospel forth to the nations, 
open up new missions, go to those who 
sit in darkness, preach the Gospel by 
the power of the Spirit to the poor and 
the destitute, to those who are not civ- 
ilized as well as those who are. May He 
give us the power to accomplish this 
great work, and build up His kingdom, 
labor in His Temples, and accomplish 
a work for the living and the dead, that 
all may rise together, and that we may 
become a power in the earth and fill 
the whole earth, is my prayer in the 
name of Jesus. Amen. 

The choir sang the anthem: 
Let the mountains shout for joy.

PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 

Ennobling rules of conduct— Man's indebtedness to 
Q id— Tae only pat iwajf to exaltation— Good- 
will toward all men— Unity a principle of 
power — Parental care of the family. 

I desire to express my sincere grati- 
tude to God my Heavenly Father and 
to all the Latter-day Saints assembled 
here for the unanimity of faith and 
feeling- which exists among them, and 
for the confidence that they have 
shown in the presiding authorities of 
the Church, and also in observing the 
laws of God as far as they have done. 
There are laws which we do not observe 
as we should; there are principles of 
the Gospel which are perhaps too pure 
and exalted for us to live them as we 
should; but I believe with all my heart 
— I ea. % ot consistently believe other- 
wise — that we are growing in grace and 
in the knowledge of the truth, and that 
the day will come, and I pray that it 
may be hastened, when the people of 
God will not only be faithful in keeping 
the law of tithing, but that they will be 
faithful also in observing the Word of 
Wisdom, which is a law of God, and 
that we will be faithful in observing 
that most sacred and most important 
law of God — the law of chastity, where- 
in we may preserve the purity of our 
own persons and the chastity of our 
neighbors and associates as we would 
preserve our own lives. I would to God 
that the time may come, and that it is 
not far distant, when the Latter-day 
Saints will live up to the golden rule 
taught by the Son of God, (than whom 
none so perfect has ever sojourned in 
the flesh upon the earth,) to do unto 
others as we would have others do 
unto us; and in this way stop all fault- 
finding, all bickerings, all jealousies, all 
contentions, and all strife, and, as far 
as practicable, remove every possible 
chance for misunderstanding amongst 
us, that we may see as we are seen 
and know as we are known, that we 
may be true men and women in the 
cause of Zion and of human redemp- 
tion, that God may put His holy name 
upon us and we bear that holy name 
acceptably before Him. The object of 
our being here is to do the will of the 
Father as it is done in heaven, to work 
righteousness in the earth, to subdue 
wickedness and put it under our feet, 



to conquer sin and the adversary of 
our souls, to rise above the imperfec- 
tions and weaknesses of poor, fallen 
humanity, by the inspiration of Al- 
mighty God and His power made mani- 
fest, and thus become Indeed the Saints 
and servants of the Lord in the earth. 

Let us sustain the cause of Zion. Let 
no man speak lightly of the principles 
of the Gospel. Let no one treat lightly 
the ordinances of the house of 
God. Let no one hold in de- 
rision the Priesthood that the Lord has 
restored to the earth, which is the au- 
thority that He has given unto men. 
Let no man look contemptuously upon 
the organization of the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints as it has 
been established in the earth through 
the instrumentality of the Prophet 
Joseph Smith, whom the Lord raised up 
when he was but a child to lay the 
foundation of the same. Let no man 
treat these things lightly or doubtingly; 
but let ever man seek earnestly to un- 
derstand the truth and teach his chil- 
dren to become familiar with those 
truths of heaven that have been re- 
stored to the earth in the latter day. I 
believe with all my soul in God the 
Father of our Lord and Savior Jesus 
Christ. I believe with all my might, 
mind and strength in the Savior of 
the world, and in the principle of re- 
demption from death and sin. I believe 
in the divine mission of the Prophet 
Joseph Smith. I believe in all the truth 
that I know, and I believe that there 
are many principles of eternal truth 
that still lie hid from me and from the 
understanding of men, which will yet 
be revealed by the power of God unto 
His faithful servants. I believe that 
the Lord has revealed to the children 
of men all that they know. I do not 
believe that any man has discovered 
any principle in science, or art.; in 
mechanism, or mathematics, or any- 
thing else, that God did not know be- 
fore he did. Man is indebted to the 
source of all intelligence and 
truth, for the knowledge that he 
possesses; and all who will yield 
obedience to the promptings of the 
Spirit, which leads to virtue, to honor, 
to the love of God and man, and to 
the love of truth and that which is en- 
nobling and enlarging to the soul, will 



86 GENERAL, C< 

get a clearer, a more expansive, and a 
more direct and conclusive knowledge 
of God's truths than anyone else can 
do. I tell you this, because I know it is 
true. The Lord Almighty lives; He 
made the heavens and the earth, and 
the fountains of water; and we are His 
children, His offspring, and we are not 
here by chance. The Lord designed our 
ccming, and the object of our being. He 
designs that we shall accomplish our 
mission, to become conformed to the 
likeness and image of Jesus Christ, 
that, like Him, we may be without sin 
unto salvation, like Him we may be 
filled with pure intelligence, and like 
Him we may be exalted to the right 
hand of the Father, to sit upon thrones 
and have dominion and power in the 
sphere in which we shall.be called to 
act. I testify to this doctrine, for the 
Lord has made me to know and feel 
the truth of it from the crown of my 
head to the soles of my feet. I love 
good, honorable men — even men who 
may be mistaken, as far as their judg- 
ment is concerned, but who try to do 
right; I love them for the reason that 
they are my brethren, the sons of my 
Father, and I would that they might all 
see the truth as it is in Christ Jesus, 
and accept it, and receive all the bene- 
fits of it, in time and throughout all 
eternity. If the Lord has revealed to 
the world the plan of salvation and re- 
demption from sin, by which men may 
be exalted again into His presence and 
partake of eternal life with Him, I sub- 
mit, as a proposition that cannot be 
controverted, that no man can be ex- 
alted into the presence of God and at- 
tain to a fulness of glory and happi- 
ness in His kingdom and presence, save 
and except he will obey the plan that 
God has devised and revealed. 

My brethren and sisters, I feel in my 
heart that we have had a' time of re- 
joicing during this conference. I wish 
we had a place big enough to hold the 
Latter-day Saints at conference. I do 
not know but we will have to build 
some boweries or something else on 
this temple block, to accommodate by 
overflow meetings the multitude of peo- 
ple who come to conference in the per- 
formance of their duty, many of whom 
cannot be accommodated in this Taber- 
nacle. But we will visit you; we will 



come to you who cannot come to us, 
and we will carry our spirit and testi- 
mony unto you and exhort you in your 
homes, if the Lord will give us the 
strength to do it. Provided my strength 
holds out and my brethren do not ob- 
ject, I propose, the Lord being willing, 
to visit the Saints a little, and encour- 
age them in their homes; let them know 
what we are, what we believe in, and 
how much we love them for Christ's 
sake, that they may receive His truth, 
and be exalted by it and eventually re- 
turn into His presence. We want to 
visit St. George, and all the settlements 
between. We want to visit the north- 
ern settlements, as far as we possibly 
can, and see you in your ciies. When 
we come, brethren and sisters, we hope 
that you will receive us in the same 
spirit that we take to you— the spirit 
of love and of earnest desire for your 
welfare and happiness and for the hap- 
piness of all mankind. We have no ill 
feeling in our hearts toward any living 
creature. We forgive those who tres- 
pass against us. Those who have spoken 
evil of us, and who have misrepresented 
us before the world, we have no malice 
in our hearts toward them. We say, let 
God judge between them and us; let 
Him recompense them for their work. 
We will not raise a hand against them; 
but we will extend the hand of fellow- 
ship and friendship to them, if they will 
repent of their sins and come unto the 
Lord and live. No matter how malicious 
they may have been, or how foolish 
they may have acted, if they will repent 
of it we will receive them with open 
arms, and we will do all we can to 
help them to save themselves. I cannot 
save you; you cannot save me; we can- 
not save each other, only so far as we 
can persuade each other to receive the 
truth, by teaching it. When a man 
receives the truth he will be saved by 
it. He will not be saved merely be- 
cause someone taught it to him, but 
because he received and acted upon it. 
The Gospel is consistent; it is common 
sense, reason, revelation; it is almighty 
truth from the heavens made known to 
man. 

The Lord bless you. We propose to 
do our duty according to the light we 
possess, by the help of the loving Fa- 
ther. I propose to do nothing that I

have not the most positive assurance is 
right, through the unanimity of my 
counselors, our seeing eye to eye, and 
our understanding alike together with 
as many more of the leading brethren 
as possible. I do not propose to do any- 
thing, or suffer anything to be done or 
sanctioned which will affect the king- 
dom of God in the earth, except by 
common consent, or unless we can see 
eye to eye upon it, then I know we 
shall have strength behind us, that the 
power of God will be with us, and the 
Saints will uphold and sustain our 
hands. Now, I want to hear from 
Presidents Winder and Lund. God 
bless Israel. May peace and prosperity 
goodwill and holy love for the truth 
abide with you and be multiplied upon 
you, is my earnest prayer. And oh! 
my brethren, be true to your families, 
be true to your wives and children. 
Teach them the way of life. Do not 
allow them to get so far from you that 
they will become oblivious to you or to 
any principle of honor, purity or truth. 
Teach your children so that they can- 
not commit sin without violating their 
conscience. Teach them the truth, that, 
they may not depart from it. Bring 
them up in the way they should go, 
and when they get old they will not 
depart from it. If you will keep your 
boys close to your hearts, within the 
clasp of your arms; if you will make 
them to feel that you love them, that you 
are their parents that they are your 
children, and keep them near to you, 
they will not go very far from you, and 
they will not commit any very great 
sin. But it is when you turn them 
out of the home, turn them 
out of your affections — out into 
the darkness of the night in- 
to the society of the depraved or de- 
graded; it is when they become tire- 
some to you, or you are tired of their 
innocent noise and prattle at home, and 
you say, "Go off somewhere else." It 
is this sort of treatment of your child- 
ren that drives them from you, and 
helps to make criminals and infi'lels of 
them. Tou cannot afford to do this. 
How would I feel to enter into the 
kingdom of God — (if such a thing were 
possible) — and see one of my children 
outside among the sorcerers, the whore- 
mongers and those that love and make 



a lie, and that because I had neglected 
my duty toward him or had not kept 
the proper restraint upon him? Do 
you think I shall be exalted in the 
kingdom of my God with this stain 
and blot upon my soul? I tell you, No! 
No man can get there until he atones 
for such crime as this — for it is a 
crime in the sight of God and man for 
a. father to carelessly or wilfully neglect 
his children. This is my sentiment. 
Take care of your children. They are 
the hope of Israel, and upon them will 
rest, by and by, the responsibility of 
bearing off the kingdom of God in the 
earth. The Lord bless them and keep 
them in the paths of righteousness, I 
humbly pray, in the name of Jesus. 
Amen. 

PRESIDENT ANTHON H. LUND. 

Past and present status of the Church — Work of 
God spreading wherever It has reached — Au- 
thenticity of the Book of Mormon. 

We have had a great many instruc- 
tions given us during this conference, 
and I believe all who are present have 
rejoiced in what they have heard. When 
I look upon this vast assemblage I 
ask myself, what would the Prophet 
Joseph have thought, 72 years ago to- 
day, if he could have beheld what we 
see — this large Tabernacle filled, the 
Assembly Hall full, and still hundreds 
of people on the grounds? When they 
met on the 6th of April, 1830, to organ- 
ize the Church, it was accomplished 
with six persons, and there were not 
more than that number of members 
of the Church at that time. Those who 
met on that occasion rejoiced in their 
meetings; and experienced a rich out- 
pouring of the Holy Ghost. 

Even at that time the principle enun- 
ciated by our President today, that all 
things should be done by common con- 
sent, was carried out. Joseph Smith 
and Oliver Cowdery had received the 
Aaronic Priesthood under the hands of 
John the Baptist. Afterwards they re- 
ceived the Melchisedek Priesthood un- 
der the hands of Peter.James and John. 
This, no doubt, was in the summer of 
1829. We do not know the exact date, 
but the Prophet Joseph tells us that the 
Lord commanded him that when the 
Church was organized he should ordain 
Oliver Cowdery an Elder, anft Oliver 



88 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Cowdery should ordain him an Elder. 
Mind you, they held the Melchisedek 
Priesthood, but the office of an Elder 
was to he given them when they could 
be sustained by the Church. Before 
they were ordained, they laid this mat- 
ter before the members of the Church, 
who sustained them by their votes; 
then they ordained each other to this 
office in the Melchisedek Priesthood. 
They held the Melchisedek Priesthood 
before, but to be the presiding Elders of 
the Church they must have the consent 
of the members, and it was granted. 

Prom that little beginning 72 years 
ago, this has come to pass! Thousands 
have heard the name of the Prophet 
Joseph. In Europe, on the islands of 
the sea, in America, and in Asia, mes- 
sengers bearing glad tidings, 
are proclaiming that God has revealed 
Himself, and that Joseph Smith was 
His prophet. Many who hear their tes- 
timonies believe and join the Church, 
while many others have not the moral 
courage to do so. We feel encouraged 
to look back on the work of last year. 
Wherever the Elders have gone suc- 
cess has attended their labors. In Eng- 
land they have baptized more this last 
year than they have done for a number 
of years before. We thought that the 
work was nearly done there, but still 
the Elders have been baptizing hun- 
dreds in that land. In Germany there 
are good prospects. The Elders there 
are laboring faithfully and gaining the 
ears of the people. This morning I 
read an account of a Sunday school at 
Koeningsburg, in East Prussia, very 
close to the Russian empire. The school 
is composed of children of Saints and 
of outsiders; in fact, four-fifths do not 
belong to our Church. These children 
go to the school, and sing our songs. 
They sing them, too, in their homes; 
and other children are falling in love 
with the songs of Zion. It has been 
said, "If I can have the making of 
the songs of a nation, I will mold the 
sentiment of that nation." If we can 
get the people to sing the songs of 
Zion, the Spirit will go with them, and 
it will draw the hearts of the people 
to us. In other places likewise they 
have had success in the Sunday school 
movement, and also in preaching. In 
Saxony — a place where the cradle of 



the Reformation stood — we have had 
the most success as a conference; over 
100 were baptized there last year. In 
the Netherlands our Elders have had 
more baptisms to the Elder than in 
any other mission in Europe. In Scan- 
dinavia the work is progressing as us- 
ual. The members of the Church are 
trying to build a meeting house at the 
capital of Denmark, which I hope they 
will finish this summer, so that our 
good Copenhagen Saints may have a 
suitable house of worship to which they 
can invite their friends and be proud 
to take them. On the islands of the 
sea the Gospel is also spreading. 

The Book of Mormon has been trans- 
lated intoTahitian and Samoan,and it is 
already printed in the Maori and Haw- 
aiian. Tou have heard the good report 
from Apostle Grant concerning Japan. 
There a Shinto priest has joined the 
Church. In Turkey a leading Moham- 
medan has been baptized — something 
very unusual. When the Lord begins 
the great work of touching these na- 
tions, many will accept the truth. His 
work will grow in the earth. He has 
commenced it, and He will see that it 
is carried forward triumphantly. The 
Book of Mormon has also been trans- 
lated into the Turkish language, by 
Brother Hintze. Gradually the word 
of the Lord contained in that book 
will be translated into the leading lan- 
guages of the earth, so that all men 
can read it. The external and inte-rnal 
evidences in favor of it are many. Any 
one who will read the Book of Mormon 
with a prayerful heart will feel that he 
is reading what has been written un- 
der the inspiration of the Holy Ghost. 
Men have doubted the origin of it; they 
knew that Joseph Smith could not 
write it, and have therefore tried to 
give the honor to others. The theory 
that Spaulding was the author of it 
has been exploded by the discovery of 
the Spaulding manuscript, though I 
hear that the argument is being put 
forth now. "Who knows but he wrote 
some other manuscript, if that which 
has been found and given to the world 
is not the origin of the Book of Mor- 
mon?" If such arguments as that may 
be used, when can anything be refuted ? 
Others have said that Sidney Rigdon 
was the writer. Sidney Rigdon did not

see the book till it was printed and de- 
livered to him by Parley Pratt and 
others who visited him. Anyone who 
will read what Sidney Rigdon has writ- 
ten may know that Sidney Rigdon was 
not the author of the Book of Mormon. 
His style was totally unlike the style 
of that book. The style of the Book of 
Mormon is plain and simple. Sidney 
Rigdon's style was diffuse and labored, 
often lacking in clearness. He was a 
great preacher, and when he was moved 
upon by the Spirit he could enthuse his 
hearers; but he could not have written 
the Book of Mormon. Who that has seen 
a man's handwriting and become fa- 
miliar with it, that cannot tell it when 
he sees it again? Men show their in- 
dividuality in their writing, and one 
does not write like another. If you 
have studied style, you will readily see 
that Sidney Rigdon is not the author 
of that book. 

The Prophet Joseph did not pretend 
to be a writer; still he had a clear and 
forcible style. When I read his little 
daybook from 1832 to 1834, I am struck 
with his ability to express his thoughts. 

Notwithstanding all that the Lord 
had done for him he was a humble man. 
Yet he was by nature an able man, 
and when the Lord endowed him with 
the Holy Spirit and gave him revela- 
tions from on high, he became a great 
man — the one chosen to usher in the 
dispensation of the fulness of times, 
and by the help of our Heavenly Father 
he laid the foundation broad and wide. 

Brethren and sisters, let us do our du- 
ty in helping to carry on this work. 
Tou have received a testimony of the 
truth; let it continue to burn in your 
hearts. Do not feel to stop your work 
or to lag in your diligence; but continue 
zealous for the cause. Remember what 
you have received, and how the Lord 
has blessed you in giving you the truth, 
and remember the duty that rests upon 
you to make it known unto others. 
How thankful I am when I see the re- 
sponse our brethren give to the calls to 
go upon missions! Daily we receive 
their letters, and generally they contain 
these words: "We are ready to go." 
We commend the brethren for this 
readiness, and hope that in all other 
duties devolving upon them they wffl 
show the same readiness. God 



bless you, and help us to serve 
Him, to do our duty while op- 
portunity is given us, that at last we 
may be saved, is my prayer in the name 
of Jesus. Amen. 

PRESIDENT JOHN R. WINDER 

Importan je of Temple work— Vicarious labor for 
the dead — Resp risibility attached to this duty. 

My brethren and sisters, there is one 
principle connected with the Gospel 
of Jesus Christ that has a very warm 
place in my heart, and that is, our 
temple work. It was referred to yes- 
terday by Apostle Merrill. I desire to 
emphasize the remarks made by Broth- 
er Merrill concerning this, and I know 
no better way to do it than to read a 
few remarks made by the Prophet Jo- 
seph Smith in relation to this princi- 
ple. We find in section 128 of the Book 
of Doctrine and Covenants an address 
to the Latter-day Saints by the Proph- 
et. He starts out thus: 

\ 

"I now resume the subject of the 
baptism for the dead, as that subject 
seems to occupy my mind, and press 
itself upon my feelings the strongest, 
since I have been pursued by, my ene- 
mies." 

In the 15th paragraph of the same 
address, we find the following: 

'And now, my dearly beloved breth- 
ren and sisters, let me assure you that 
these are principles in relation to the 
dead, and the living, that cannot be 
lightly passed over, as pertaining to 
our salvation. For their salvation is 
necessary, and essential to our salva- 
tion, as Paul says concerning the fath- 
ers, 'that they without us cannot be 
made perfect;' neither can we without 
our dead be made perfect." 

V 

This address was given in April, 1842, 
not very long previous to his martyr- 
dom. Again, in April, 1844, he preach- 
ed a sermon at the funeral of King Fol- 
let, and in that sermon the following 
appears: 

"The greatest responsibility in this 
world that God has laid upon us is to 
seek after our dead. The Apostle says, 
'They without us cannot be made per- 
fect;' for it is necessary that the seal- 
ing power should be in our hands, to- 
seal our children and our dead, for 
the dispensation of the fulness of times. 
It is necessary that those who have 
gone before and those who come after, 
should have salvation, in common with 
us; and thus hath God made it obliga-

tory upon man. Hence, God said, 'I 
will send Elijah the prophet, and he 
shall turn the hearts of the fathers to 
the children,' etc. I have a declaration 
to make of the provisions which God 
hath made to suit the conditions of 
iran, made before the foundations of 
the world. He made a provision that 
every spirit in the eternal worlds can 
be ferreted out and saved. He has 
wrought out salvation for all men, un- 
less they have committed the sin 
against the Holy Ghost, and 
every man who has a friend 
in -the eternal worlds can save 
him, unless he has committed the un- 
pardonable sin. And now you can see 
how far he can become a savior." 

Again, in the Prophet's last ser- 
mon but one, delivered on the 
12th of May, 1844, just about one month 
previous to his martyrdom he said: 

"It is not only necessary that you 
should be baptized for your dead, but 
you will have to go through all the or- 
dinances for them, the same as you 
have gone through to save yourselves. 
There will be 144,000 saviors upon 
Mount Zion, and with them an innum- 
erable host that no man can number. 
Every man who has been baptized and 
belongs to the kingdom has a right to 
be baptized for those who have gone 
before." 

This is the point that I want to call 
your attention to particularly: 

"And as soon as the law of the Gos- 
pel is obeyed here by their friends who 
act as proxy for them, the Lord has 
administrators there to set them free." 

I could think of no better way, breth- 
ren and sisters, to emphasize the re- 
marks made by Brother Merrill yes- 
terday in relation to this subject than 
to read to you these few words from 
the Prophet of God. We have spent 
millions of dollars in building temples 
and preparing for this work. The doors 
are open to all of the Latter-day Saints, 
male and female, provided always that 
they are worthy and can receive recom- 
mends from their Bishops and Presi- 
dents of Stakes. "While a great deal of 
work has been done already, at the 
same time a great deal more might be 
done, with the same expense that we 
are under now. All of the temples are 
•open, but they are not all the time filled. 
It is true, our temple here is pretty 
well patronized. I could name a few 
individuals who have done a grand 
work in this direction. I have in my 



mind now one dear old German lady, 
who commenced work in this temple 
soon after it was dedicated. She spent 
her means, obtained assistance, and had 
work done for 1,800 persons — her rela- 
tives and friends. The last time she 
was there she came to me and said, 
"Nov/, I have finished my work, and I 
would like to put my record in the 
archives of the temple." In a very short 
time — only a few weeks — she passed 
away to the other side. What a glori- 
ous time she would have with those 
1,800 persons that she had released from 
prison! How many are there of you 
in this congregation that have relatives 
and friends on the other side waiting 
for you to do the work for them ? Take 
this matter into consideration, and try 
to make an effort to carry on the work 
and to release those who are waiting 
for you. Since the dedication of this 
temple there have been 685,966 ordin- 
ances performed in it; and in all the 
temples there have been 2,409,128 ordin- 
ances performed. When I reflect on 
this, my brethren and sisters, I am in- 
clined to think that there is a large 
congregation on the other side. Many 
of our Prophets and Apostles have gone 
there, and I have read to you that there 
is an organization there, so that as 
soon as the ordinances are performed 
here the parties are informed of it. I 
believe it, brethren and sisters, and 
that there is a host there. 

Now, you have kindly voted to sus- 
tain me as a counselor to the President. 
I wish to tell you that the aim and ob- 
ject of my life from this time on will 
be to stand up and sustain my Presi- 
dent. As the Lord will give me 
strength and ability, I propose to do 
that thing. I pray that the blessing of 
the Lord may attend His people. God 
bless you all, brethren and sisters, and 
may we be faithful and true to our 
covenants, is my prayer in the name of 
Jesus. Amen. 

PRESIDENT JOSEPH P. SMITH. 

I hope that the congregation will be 
patient just a few moments more. We 
have a little matter of business to 
bring before the conference by way of 
a notice for action in the future, prob- 
ably at the next October conference.

The Latter-day Saints generally are 
familiar with the book called the Pearl 
of Great Price. The old edition of it 
has been accepted by the Church as an 
authentic doctrinal work. It has now 
been re-published, with some improve- 
ments. It has been divided into chap- 
ters and verses, with references on the 
bottom of the pages. This has been 
done, under the sanction of the Presi- 
dency of the Church, by Elder James 
E. Talmage. We have eliminated from 
the Pearl of Great Price those revela- 
tions it formerly contained which are 
to be found, and always were, in the 
Book of Doctrine and Covenants, be- 
lieving that it was unnecessary to pub- 
lish revelations in the Pearl of Great 
Price that were included in the Book 
•of Doctrine and Covenants. These 
changes have been made in the book, 



and it is now ready for the use of those 
who desire to obtain it; and at the com- 
ing October conference the book will 
be presented to the conference for their 
acceptance in its revised and changed 
form. 

The choir sang the anthem: 
Hosanna. 

The benediction was pronounced by 
Patriarch John Smith. 
Conference adjourned for six months. 

Note: — The attendance at this confer- 
ence, throughout, was larger than on 
any other similar occasion in the his- 
tory of the Church. 

The stenographic work, in taking a 
full account of the proceedings, was 
done by Arthur Winter.

DESERET SUNDAY SCHOOL UNION. 

Annual General Conference. 



At the conference of the Deseret 
Sunday School Union, held in the 
Tabernacle, Sunday evening, April 6th, 
there were present of the general super- 
intendency: Joseph F. Smith, George 
Reynolds and Joseph M. Tanner, near- 
ly all the members of the Sunday 
School Union board, the stake author- 
ities then in the city, and the largest 
attendance of Sunday school workers 
ever gathered. All of fifty stakes of 
Zion were represented except Alberta, 
Bingham, Big Horn, Maricopa, St. 
Joseph, San Luis, St. Johns, Snowfiake 
and Teton. 

The meeting was presided over by 
General Superintendent Joseph F. 
Smith, and commenced by the choir 
singing the hymn, "High on the moun- 
tain top." Opening prayer was of- 
fered by Elder John B. Maiben of Man- 
ti. This was followed by the hymn, 
"Zion stands with hills surrounded." 

Following the calling of the roll sec- 
retary George D. Pyper read the 1901 
annual statistical and financial report 
of the Sunday schools throughout the 
Church, which gives the following grat- 
ifying showing: 

Number of Sunday schools in the or- 
ganized stakes of Zion, 716 — an increase 
of 37 over the report of 1900. 

Number of schools in missions, 339, an 
increase of 38. Total schools through- 
out the Church, 1,055 — an increase of 
75 schools. 

Number of officers and teachers in or- 
ganized stakes, 13,576 — increase, 1,102; 
In missions, 1,622 — increase 39. Total 
officers and teachers, 15,198 — an increase 
of 1,141. 

Number of pupils in the organized 
stakes, 50,992 males, 53,413 females. 
Total, 104,405. Increase, 4,077. 



Number of pupils in mission schools, 
4,335 males, 5,185 females. Total, 9,520. 
Increase, 773. 

Total pupils, 55,327 males, 58,598 fe- 
males. Total, 113,925. Increase, 4,850. 

The report shows that there are 3,271 
more girls than boys in the Sunday 
schools. 

Number of Sunday school officers and 
missionaries not on the ward rolls: In 
organized stakes, 338; in missions, 121: 
total, 509; an increase of 157. 

Total of officers, teachers, Sunday 
school missionaries and pupils: In or- 
organized stakes, 38; in mission, 121; 
263. Grand total of 129,632, and a total 
increase over 1900 of 6,148. 

The report also shows for 1900 an 
average attendance of 69,474, and for 
1901, 75,683, an increase of nearly nine 
per cent. 

The Sunday schools have collected 
$23,182.81, and expended, $18,423.21, 
having a balance on hand of $4,759.60. 

Out of 118,369 officers, teachers, and 
pupils, the report shows that 87 per 
cent, or 102,881 keep the "Word of Wis- 
dom. 

The general authorities of the Sun- 
day schools were presented and unani- 
mously sustained. 

RPJMARKS OF APOSTLE HEBER J. 
GRANT. 

Our Sunday school interests are not 
very extensive in Japan, as yet. I will 
simply say that we live in hopes of hav- 
ing, in the providence of the Lord, Sab- 
bath schools in that empire, by the 
time the next conference is held. 

I have always enjoyed my labors in 
the Sabbath school and the Mutual Im- 
provement Association, and I rejoice in 



DESBRBT SUNDAY SCHOOL UNION.

the -wonderful growth of the Sunday 
School interest among the Latter-day 
Saints, and in the remarkable advance- 
ment that has been made. I feel that 
there is nothing in which we can take 
more pride and satisfaction than the 
increased knowledge, as to the princi- 
ples of the Gospel, and the plan of life 
and salvation, that our children have 
today, in comparison with what many 
of us had when we were children. 

I remember that, when I was made 
the president of the Tooele stake of 
Zion, I had never had any experience 
whatever. in public speaking; never had 
I spoken ten minutes at any one time, 
and I was then nearly 24 years of age. 
I imagine now, with our Church 
schools, religion classes, Sabbath 
schools and Mutual Improvement Asso- 
ciations, that it would be a very dim- 
cult matter to find, among the intelli- 
gent young men and women that have 
attended these institutions, one who 
could not stand up and speak intelli- 
gently.for fifteen minutes or a half hour 
on the principles of the Gospel. I re- 
joice when I realize that this is the 
case, and that there has been such 
an advancement among our children in 
the knowledge of the Gospel and their 
ability to explain the same and to 
give a reason for the hope that is 
within them. 

I remember being selected as one of 
the officers of the first Mutual Improve- 
ment Association that was organized 
under the direction of our late Presi- 
dent Brigham Young, and, as I con'em- 
plate the growth of the Sabbath 
schools. Mutual Improvement Asocia- 
tions and Church schools, my heart is 
filled with gratitude and thanksgiving 
to my heavenly Father. 

I realize that the destiny of the Lat- 
ter-day Saints is very great. I realize 
that the prophecies that have been 
made with reference to this people will 
ail have to be fulfilled; that the little 
stone cut from the mountain without 
hands is to roll forth and fill the whole 
earth. I realize that it will be neces- 
sary that our children be fitted, quali- 
fied and prepared by education by 
study, and also by faith in God, our 
heavenly Father, and in His Son Jesus 
Christ, if they successfully fulfill their 
■destiny. That the Saints will fu fill 



their destiny, that they will accomplish 
all that God desires them to accom- 
plish, I have no doubt. Whether we, 
as individuals, shall do all that is pos- 
sible for us to do is a personal matter. 
I have often said in my remarks to 
the Saints, that each and every one 
of us are the architects of our own 
lives; that God will bless us in propor- 
tion to our faithfulness and diligence. I 
rejoice in the statement of the Prophet 
Joseph Smith, that there is a law irre- 
vocably decreed in heaven, which was 
decreed before the foundation of this 
world, upon which all blessings are pre- 
dicted. He says that if we receive any 
blessing, it is by obedience to the law 
upon which it is predicated. Our child- 
ren today in the Sabbath schools, the 
Mutual Improvement Associations and 
Church schools are fulfilling the law 
whereby they are entitled to have abil- 
ity and knowledge and capacity to pro- 
claim the Gospel and to give a reason 
for the hope that is within them. God 
will bestow the blessing if we will do 
our part, for He will not fail to do His. 
He has said that if we keep His laws 
and commandments that He is then 
bound to bestow the blessing. 

I rejoice in the growth of the Sab- 
bath school work. I remember that the 
first trip that I took, after being called 
as one of the Twelve Apostles, was to 
the Stakes of Colorado, San Juan and 
to Arizona. I went with Apostle Brig- 
ham Young. I remember thinking that 
he was an aged man; but I am as old 
now as he was then, lacking but a few 
months, and I well remember hearing 
him say that he was only a boy in the 
Gospel, and it sounded strange to me; 
but I feel that I am very young yet 
in the Gospel. I remember while on 
that trip, that I bought a North Am- 
erican Review, while on the train, and 
read an article on Sabbath schools, 
(written by a man that had been en- 
gaged in the Sabbath school work in 
New York City for many years,) be- 
wailing the condition of affairs in that 
great city. He said fifteen hundred high 
class Christians attending one fine big 
church in that city could not muster 
one hundred children. He said the only 
way that they could make a respectable 
showing at all, a showing that was not 
a disgrace to them, was to go out into 



94

the slums and hire children to attend 
their Sunday school. When I realize 
that there are over 130,000 engaged in 
the Sabbath school work of the Latter- 
day Saints, that there are over 100,000 
Sabbath school children, and that the 
Latter-day Saints only number about 
400,000, including these 100,000 children, 
then it is that I realize that we, as a 
people, are fulfilling the first great 
commandment that God gave to our 
father Adam and mother Eve, to mul- 
tiply and replenish the earth. We are 
not drying up the fountains of life, but 
are keeping that great commandment, 
and, therefore, we are fulfilling the 
law that was irrevocably decreed, 
whereby we shall become great and 
mighty. God bless you. Amen. 

A quartet, "Refuge," was sung by 
Elders Pyper, Whitney, Patrick and 
Spencer. 

ELDER JOS. W. SUMMERHAYS. 

We have established in this city a 
Sunday school that is known as the 
University Sunday school. We secured 
accommodations for the school in the 
Latter-day Saints' University . The 
school, however, is open to all those 
who come into our city to attend our 
institutions of learning, who do not be- 
long, directly to the ward in which 
they reside while in Salt Lake City. We 
are informed that there are a few who 
are now attending our institutions of 
learning that do not attend this Sunday 
school. We ask you, my brethren and 
sisters, when you go home, to see the 
parents of those attending schools in 
this city, and ask them to write to their 
children requesting them to attend the 
Sunday school and the university; and 
if these parents will also address a let- 
ter to Supt. Milton Bennion, he will see 
that they are visited and labored with 
and that an effort is made to get them 
to attend the University Sunday 
school. Of course, it is intended that 
those who attend school at the State 
University and other institutions, 
whether they are of our faith or not, 
shall be made' perfectly welcome. We 
shall be glad to have them come, and 
feel certain that they will be benefited 
by so doing. 

Some time ago a Sunday School His- 



tory was issued. It contained an ac- 
count of the doings of our Sunday 
schools for the first fifty years of their 
existence in these valleys. It was pro- 
posed as we had a number on hand that 
these histories be sent around to the 
different stakes pro rata, and that they 
should pay for them. All the stakes 
have now received their quota but 
two. We have still outstanding on this 
account about $1,300, and we would like 
to have the stake superintendents see 
to it, when they return to their homes, 
that these accounts are settled and the 
proceeds forwarded to our office. 

We are distributing to the Sunday 
schools, this season, last years' volume 
of the Juvenile Instructor. This, of 
course, is free. Most of the stakes 
have received their portion of these 
volumes but we have learned that there 
are one or two stakes that have not 
distributed them to ■'" their respective 
schools. Now, brethren, we would like 
to have them distributed to the schools. 
They are bound, as you are aware, and 
we want the schools to have the benefit 
of them, as there are many things in 
them that will be of advantage to the 
schools. We would like to have the su- 
perintendents of those stakes who 
have not yet received these books call 
on our business manager, Brother T. 
C. Griggs, and get them, or make ar- 
rangements for their delivery. 

The Sunday School Treatise, as you 
are no doubt aware, recommends that, 
in opening the schools on Sunday morn- 
ing, you have roll-call, singing, prayer, 
then singing again, after which the 
minutes are to be read. Application has 
been made to the Board to change this, 
on the ground that the Sacrament can 
be more properly administered after 
the singing of an appropriate hymn 
than immediately following the reading 
of the minutes or the giving out of no- 
tices. Some of the superintendents feel 
that it would be better, after the morn- 
ing prayer, to give out the notices and 
read the minutes, and then, after sing- 
ing again, to administer the Sacrament. 
Now, the Deseret Sunday School Union 
Board has ho objection to this change, 
where desired by any of the schools. 

Some' of the Stake Sunday School au- 
thorities have sent to the Union Board, 
for literature, stating that they would 



DESERET SUNDAY SCHOOL, UNION.

see that it was paid for. The literature, 
has been sent, and some of the stakes 
are still owing considerable for the 
same. We need money badly just at 
present, and would be glad if you would 
close up these accounts. Let us have 
the means that you have in your hands, 
and then sell what literature you have 
left on hand and remit to us for that 
also. 

We have been trying, as a Sunday 
School Union Board, to introduce into 
our schools better methods, and to get, 
if possible, teachers that have had more 
training. Now some have imbibed the 
idea that no one should teach in the 
Sunday School that is not a graduate 
from an institution of learning. We 
want to correct this. 

Thirty years ago, next October, the 
first Sunday School statistical report 
was sent in to the Sunday School au- 
thorities. We then numbered, all told, 
14,007 souls, if my memory serves me 
correctly. You have heard, this even- 
ing, that we have in the fifty organized 
stakes of Zion, seven hundred and six- 
teen Sunday Schools. Several of these 
schools number hundreds of pupils. 
One, at least, numbers nearly 1,200. 
Some of them have a membership of 
over six hundred, and many have five 
hundred. The work is growing very 
fast. People who do not travel through 
the stakes of Zion cannot understand 
how we are increasing; but, perhaps, 
you will be able to form some idea of 
the scope of country these seven hun- 
dred and sixteen schools cover when I 
tell you that the distance from the 
farthest Sunday School in the North to 
the farthest in the South is nearly as 
great as that from Salt Lake City to 
Buffalo, New York. We are spreading 
out; we are increasing in a wonderful 
manner, but not as fast as we might. 
There is one reason why we are not in- 
creasing as fast as we might; I do 
not want to say much about it, but I 
want to give it as my opinion, that if 
some of our young men would marry, 
we would increase a little faster. It 
has been my privilege to travel among 
some of the missions, and I find that 
about seventy-five per cent of the mis- 
sionaries are not married; but most of 
them ought to be. There is something 
else I want to tell you: In the fifty or- 



ganized stakes of Zion there are some 
wards that have over sixty marriage- 
able young women that have no chance 
to marry because the young men are 
not willing. This is all wrong, and it is 
not a healthy condition. I would like 
to say to every young man that can 
marry, it is your privilege to get mar- 
ried, and give the girls a chance to get 
married also. In one of these wards I 
spoke to a young woman who is over 
thirty-two years of age, and asked her 
why she did not marry. Her reply was, 
"If you will send in some good Latter- 
day Saint young men, there will 
be no trouble about the young 
women marrying." There is another 
reason why our Sunday schools are not 
increasing as fast as they might. Quite 
a proportion of our Sunday school pop- 
ulation are not identified with us yet. 
Most of these are boys, and we should 
look after those who are not in the 
Sunday school and take a deep interest 
in their welfare. 

To go back to my subject again, I 
want to say that the increase in our 
Sunday schools during these last 30 
years has not been brought about by 
college-bred men; therefore, my breth- 
ren and sisters, those of you who have 
not graduated from some institution of 
learning need not be discouraged. In 
saying this, do not think for a moment 
that we do not uphold education. We 
want everybody educated; but it is 
wrong to think that a person cannot 
teach in a Sunday school except he has 
a first class education. What is wanted 
in every Sunday school teacher is a 
testimony of the Lord Jesus Christ and 
a knowledge of the Gospel and- a love 
for God's work, coupled with the ability 
to impart that knowledge and infuse 
that love in others. 

I pray God to bless the Sunday school 
interests, and to bless you, my brethren 
and sisters, so that, from the far north 
to the far south we shall keep spread- 
ing out and organizing new Sunday 
schools, and keep making Latter-day 
Saints of our boys and girls, that they 
may become men and women after 
God's own heart. I ask it in the name, 
of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

Elder George Hamlin recited a beau- 
tiful little poem, entitled, "The Com- 
batant."

DESBRET SUNDAY SCHOOL UNION. 



ASST. SUPT. JOS. M. TANNER. 

It must have been very gratifying to- 
night to all present, when Secretary 
Pyper read the report of our Sunday 
schools. There has been indeed a very 
remarkable increase. You will notice 
that the increase is largely in the num- 
ber of teachers, and I am pleased to 
say that our Sabbath schools now have 
enlisted in their work some of the best 
and most devoted talent in the Church. 
Many of our young men and young wo- 
men, who have taken time and means 
to educate themselves, are today loyally 
■supporting, by their aid and instruction, 
the great Sabbath school work. This 
increase in the number of our young 
people in the schools, in my judgment, 
is not the most important report that 
we have to make to you tonight. Those 
who are familiar with the work gen- 
erally of the Sunday schools through- 
out the Church, know very well that 
there has been a very wonderful im- 
provement in the character of the in- 
structions given; that greater skill and 
better methods have been brought into 
our Sunday schools, and, in very many 
instances, they have been quite revo- 
lutionized. 

It is also gratifying to note, this eve- 
ning, that we have in this work the 
co-operation and sympathy of the pre- 
siding authorities; the presidents of the 
Stakes and Bishops are proud of their 
schools; they are enthusiastic regard- 
ing every improvement that is made, 
and, altogether, we have great occasion 
for rejoicing tonight. 

Perhaps some of you noticed, some 
time ago, an item in the Deseret News, 
that a Sunday school worker, not of 
our faith, from the state of Ohio, was 
attending a Sunday school convention 
in the city of Washington, and that he 
declared there that the "Mormon" Sun- 
day schools were the best in the world. 
That was indeed a compliment, and I 
have no doubt but that it was de- 
served. Yet there are still opportuni- 
ties for improvement. 

I desire to call your attention tonight 
to a subject that I believe is one wor- 
thy the consideration of the author- 
ities of the Church, and especially of 
the Sunday schools. That is the ques- 
tion of our amusements. I am associat- 



ed with the Church schools, and the 
question of the religious education of 
our young people comes to me from 
that source, as well as from the Sunday 
schools. In visiting these schools I have 
had occasion to ask the principals what, 
in their judgment, was the greatest ob- 
stacle today to our school work, and 
the very general answer has been that 
there is too much dancing. I want to 
say to you tonight that where our 
young people are out to a dance once 
or more every week, it has a tendency 
to demoralize them, in a religious and 
in an intellectual sense. It is not only 
the time that is devoted to it, but it is 
the excitement that precedes and fol- 
lows it that is so harmful to our school 
work. In some places it becomes abso- 
lutely necessary to regulate the attend- 
ance of our students in the dances and 
require that they get the permit of the 
principal before they attended any 
balls. Only a year or two ago I was 
riding through Salt Lake City in com- 
pany with some of the leaders of the 
National Education Association. They 
were considering Salt Lake City as a 
suitable place for some future conven- 
tion of that great body of educators. 
As we were passing the Salt Lake 
Theater it was pointed out, and one of 
these national educators took occasion 
to remark that President Young was 
indeed a man of great foresight and 
wisdom, whatever people might think of 
his religious belief. Said he, he (Presi- 
dent Young) recognized that pleasure 
enters into the life of man, and he pro- 
posed, as far as he could, to guide the 
whole man. The physical man, the man 
in quest of pleasure, as well as the 
man devoted to religion and worship. 
And, said he, the man that today can 
control the amusements of the people 
and restrict them in their excessive 
pleasure, and can make their amuse- 
ments proper and suitable, must cer- 
tainly be a great benefactor to his fel- 
low-men. I take it that these words 
are very true. Indeed, I realize that it 
is possible for the amusement-maker in 
all communities to undo much of the 
good that is accomplished in the Sun- 
day school by turning our children 
loose to excessive pleasures. It has a 
tendency to demoralize them; it makes 
them seekers after pleasure rather than

after the love of God and after knowl- 
edge and information; and it is to 
be hoped that our Sunday school offi- 
cers will, as far as they can, control 
the amusements of the children. We 
want to enter into their entire lives; 
we want them to feel that we are in- 
terested in all that they do, that we 
are with them in the schoolroom, that 
we are with them in the dance, in the 
concert, and in all those necessary and 
nroper amusements which our young 
people ought to have; and we ought 
to guard, on the other hand, against 
a spirit of excessiveness. It would he 
gratifying, indeed, if the spirit of the 
Sunday school could control in the ball- 
room as it controls in the meeting 
house or schoolroom. We would be 
glad if those men whose example is 
before the children in the classes could 
be with them occasionally in the ball- 
room, that there might always be some 
representative of these school workers 
and officers at all the amusements. Let 
us control the lives of our young peo- 
ple in their entirety. Let us not sur- 
render the pleasures to the professional 
amusement makers, but let us see to it 
that our children are under our control 
in all the affairs of life. I want to say 
to you tonight that when ever you go 
into a community that is given to ex- 
cessive pleasure, having dances once, 
twice, and sometimes three and four 
nights a week, you may depend upon it 
that they have not a first class Sun- 
day school. We have discovered that 
our Church schools are worse off in 
those communities where there is no 
restriction placed upon the amuse- 
ments, and the young people go at will. 
I take it that this is something worthy 
the consideration of our people. Years 
ago our amusements were controlled 
more than they are today, and the 
dances and amusements were opened 
by prayer. That was the good old- 
fashioned custom among us. I want to 
say to you that if we can start our 
young people out in the ballroom un- 
der the spirit and influence of devotion 
to their God, after having listened to a 
short prayer, they are not so likely to 
be guilty of that giddiness, and, oft- 
times, impropriety that characterizes 
some of our dances. 
We ought to look after the dress of 



our young people, also. We are not 
seeking the fashions of the world; we 
are a sober God-fearing people, devot- 
ed to our religion. We need recreation, 
but only as a matter of relaxation. We 
must not be controlled wholly 
by the spirit of pleasure. ■ Let us con- 
trol our amusements and keep them 
subject to the influences of the Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints; 
and then if the amusements are with- 
in the keeping of the religious organ- 
izations of the Church in the various 
wards, we will gather to us into the 
Sabbath Schools a great many young 
men that are very indifferent today. If 
they find that the Sabbath School and 
other organizations are controlling all 
the life of the people, the pleasures as 
well as the devotions of the young, then 
they will be brought under that influ- 
ence, and it will only be a question of 
time before there will be created in 
their hearts a love for the Sabbath 
School. 

God bless you, my brethren and sis- 
ters. Let us rejoice in the work that 
we are doing, and let us remember also 
that there are matters that need our 
attention, and that it is our duty to 
go on and improve. God bless the offi- 
cers of our Sunday Schools, these men 
and women who are teachers, who are 
devoting, unconsciously, perhaps, their 
lives for the blessing of the youth of 
Zion, who are some day to be the 
glory of God, is my prayer, in the name 
of Jesus. Amen.

GENERAL SUPERINTENDENT 
JOSEPH F. SMITH. 

I have been requested to make a few 
remarks, and I shall certainly try to 
be brief. 

There is one point that has rested 
upon my mind in relation to the Sab- 
bath Schools, and it is this: I think 
there is nothing in the Sunday School 
work more necessary or essential than 
that all the teachers of the Sunday 
Schools should win the love and the 
confidence of their pupils. I believe 
that greater good can be done in the 
Sunday Schools by the teachers where 
they have the absolute affection andi 



98 



DESERET SUNDAY SCHOOL UNION. 



confidence of their pupils than under 
any other conditions. -You may teach 
them, you may drill them in concert, 
and you may have them commit to 
memory, and labor in every other way 
that you possibly can to accomplish the 
good that you desire with your children, 
but in nothing, in my opinion, can you 
succeed so well as when you possess 
their undivided love and confidence. If 
a ohild thinks a teacher is harsh with 
him or her, or unkind toward him, or 
does not feel a real, genuine love for 
him, if he feels that the teacher is 
not taking a real interest in him as one 
who loves him, he can never be led to 
possess the right spirit; but when he 
feels that the teacher loves him, is try- 
ing to do him good and to teach him 
that which will be for his everlasting 
welfare, then you have an influence 
over that child, that when he studies he 
will study with a purpose and with an 
earnest desire to be benefitted and to 
please the teacher; because he knows 
and feels in his little heart that the 
teacher loves him and is seeking to do 
him good. I have entertained this sen- 
timent from the beginning and in re- 
lation to the instruction of little chil- 
dren. It is a principle that obtains at 
the home as well as in the Sunday 
School. If you can only convince your 
children that you love them, that your 
soul goes out to them for their good, 
that you are their truest friend, they, 
in turn, will place confidence in you 
and will love you and seek to do your 
bidding and to carry out your wishes 
with your love, or are harsh or speak 
concerning them. But if you are selfish 
unkindly to them, and if they are not 
confident that they have your entire af- 
fection, they will be selfish, and will 
not care whether they please you or 
carry out your wishes or not, and the 
result will be that they will grow way- 
ward, thoughtless and careless, and al- 
though you may drill them, like a par- 
rot, to repeat verses and to speak in 
concert, and all that sort of thing, 
they will do it mechanically, without 
affection, and without its having that 
effect upon their souls that you desire 
it should have. 

I felt to say that much, in relation 
to the influence of the Sunday School 
teachers. Be good and kind to the 



children; win their affection. You can 
do more that way than you can with 
the rod; you can do more than you can 
by tyranny or by any forceful means. 

May the Lord bless the teachers of 
the Sunday Schools, and give them the 
spirit of meekness and kindness, that 
they may be able to convince the chil- 
dren entrusted to their care that they 
love them and are seeking for the wel- 
fare and happiness of their souls, and 
the children, in turn, will love them and 
strive to learn and to do good. God 
bless you. Amen. 

ELDER L. JOHN NUTTALL. 

The program for our work during the 
present year has been gotten out by the 
Sunday School Union Board, and copies 
have been forwarded to the different 
Stake superintendents. If there are 
any who have not received these pro- 
grams, we desire to have you call at 
our general headquarters and obtain 
enough for the different schools of your 
Stake. In connection with this, the time 
for holding the conferences of the dif- 
ferent Stakes has been provided. We 
have, however, since learned that, in 
three of the Stakes, at least, our ap- 
pointments interfere with the quarter- 
ly Stake conferences; therefore, it has 
been necessary to make changes in 
those Stakes. The Sunday School Union 
Board, early in the season, sent out le 1- 
ters to the different Stakes, asking if 
more than one day for holding the Sun- 
day school conference would be desired. 
We have only received answers from 
four desiring more than one day for 
their conference services. Those four 
are the Jordan, Cassia, Summit and 
Star Valley Stakes. There may be oth- 
ers also that desire to hold two days' 
conference, and the program is suffi- 
cient to enable them to do so. There- 
fore, if any desire more than one day, 
we will ask you to make it known to 
our secretary, so that proper arrange- 
ments may be made therefor.

It is desirable, my brethren of the 
Stake superintendencies, that those of 
you who have not received your quota 
of the questions to be answered by the 
ward superintendents, will secure them, 
and that you will see to it that these re- 
ports, after being filled out by the vari- 
ous superintendents of the schools of 
your Stake, are in the hands of your 
Stake secretaries at least three days 
before your conference, so that the vis- 
iting brethren of the union board, when 
they meet with you, may have the op- 
portunity of looking them over and as- 
certaining the conditions of the schools 
in your Stakes without having to ask 
the superintendents to arise and make 
their reports verbally. 

Tou will note in the program that 
there is provision, where we only have 
one day's services, for but one ward su- 
perintendent to make a verbal report. 
All others will have to be made in writ- 
ing. We also desire that you will have 

* Cassia will hold two days' session,

your last year's report, and also the re- 
ports of your ward superintendents, as 
made at the last conference, on hand 
at the coming conference, so that com- 
parisons may be made in regard to the 
work that is being done, to the end that 
all that is desired may be accomplished 
in the interests of the youth of Zion, 
that our organization may fill its place 
—the nursery of all the organizations in 
the Church. The grand object that we 
have in view' in the Sunday school or- 
ganization, being to make Latter-day 
Saints of our children. 

May God bless us, and let the power 
of His spirit attend us as officers and 
workers in the Sunday school, in the 
faithful discharge of the labors devolv- 
ing upon us, to the end that we may ac- 
complish our mission on earth, in the 
name of Jesus. Amen. 

PRESIDENT ANTHON H. LUND. 

I congratulate the congregation on 
the good order which has been kept 
here tonight. 

I have been pleased to see such a 
large attendance of Sunday school 
workers. I hope that you will remem- 
ber the excellent lesson President Smith 
gave us. If you want influence over 
the children you must reach their 
hearts. While we desire them taught 
in the principles of the Gospel, and wish 
them to obtain knowledge, still we want 
to reach their hearts; and instil in 
them a love for virtue. We want to 
make them see the beauty of virtue and 
to make them love it. We want to 
make them understand how odious vice 
is, and teach them to detest it. That 
is the great mission we have to per- 
form every Sunday morning, when we 
meet with our precious little ones. Make 
the school attractive; gather all that 
can attend into a school and try to get 
their love, as our President has coun- 
seled us tonight. 

May the Lord bless you in the good 
work in which you are engaged. 

I also feel to thank the Tabernacle 
choir for their presence here and their 
beautiful singing. I would say let our 
Sunday school children learn singing. 
When they grow up, the boys especial- 
ly, and become missionaries, what a 
blessing it is to them to be able to sing.

I was struck when I read the state- 
ment in the Juvenile that our songs 
are being sung amongst the children 
of the outsiders in Germany, through 
the presence and labors of our Sunday 
schools. When our Sunday school chil- 
dren learn to sing the songs of Zion, 
they will love to come together and 
partake of the spirit present in the 



school and make it attractive to others. 
May the Lord bless the Sunday school 
cause. 

"Our God we Raise to Thee" was 
sung by the choir and congregation. 

Elder John Henry Smith offered the 
benediction.

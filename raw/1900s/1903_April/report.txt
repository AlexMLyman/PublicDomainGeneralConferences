DAY 

The choir sang: 

High on the mountain top 
A banner is unfurled, 
Ye nations now look up, 

It waves to all the world. 
In Deseret's sweet peaceful land — 
On Zion's mount behold It stand. 

PRESIDENT JOSEPH. F. SMITH. 

Otiening Address. 
Leading subjects for the Conference— Get out 
of debt while prosperity prevails— How to ac- 
complish it— Saints should live their religion 
The young should be taught mechanism and 
industrial arts generally. 

My brethren and sisters, I feel very 
grateful to the Lord, the Giver of all 
good, for the privilege that we enjoy 
this morning of assembling here, 
where we are wont to gather, at our 
annual and semi-annual conferences, 
for the purpose of attending to such 
business and matters of duty that may 
present themselves to us during this 
conference, and for the purpose of giv- 
ing out, so far as the Spirit of the Lord 
may dictate to us, the word of the Lord, 
in counsel, admonition and instruction 
to the people. 

I am pleased to see the large num- 
ber who have assembled on this open- 
ing day of the conference, and I sin- 
cerely hope that we may all enjoy our 
coming together as we have enjoyed 
this privilege in days past, and, if 
pleasing before the Lord, even more 
abundantly. 

We desire to have the privilege of 
listening to as many of the brethren 
as time will permit. We would like to 
hear from as many of the presidents of 
stakes as we can, and we shall en- 
deavor to select those who did not

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



have the privilege of speaking at the 
last conference, among whom were the 
First Presidents of Seventies. There 
is a vast field for remarks and for re- 
flection by those who shall speak to the 
people, which will be interesting and 
instructive, and which will be bene- 
ficial to the cause we are engaged in. 

It is not my intention to prolong 
my remarks this morning, but I de- 
she to mention one or two subjects 
that I think worthy of the attention of 
the brethren, who may be led to en- 
large upon them and to speak to the 
people as the Spirit may give them ut 
terance. 

One of these subjects is, that in the 
time of prosperity which we are 
now enjoying, it is highly pro- 
per for the Latter-day Saints to get 
out of debt. I have unceasingly urged 
this thought upon the brethren for the 
past year or more. Wherever I have 
had the opportunity of speaking I have 
scarcely ever forgotten to hold out to 
the people the necessity— that I feel, at 
least — of our settling our obligations 
and freeing ourselves from debt in the 
day of prosperity. Our experience in 
the years that have past must have led 
us to the conclusion that we have per- 
iods of prosperity, followed by periods 
of depression. We have now had a 
long period of success and prosperity, 
and we may expect, almost at any time, 
to see these conditions change and a 
time of depression spread over the land 
and over the people. I would say, in 
connection with this subject, that one 
of the best ways that I know of to pay 
my obligations to my brother, my 
neighbor or business associate, is for 
me first to pay my obligations to the 
Lcrd. I can pay more of my debts to 
my neighbors, if I have contracted 
them, after I have met my honest obli- 
gations with the Lord, than I can by 
neglecting the latter; and you can do 
the same. If you desire to prosper, and 
tn be free men and women and a free 
people, first meet your just obligations 
to God, and then meet vpur obligations 
to your fellowmen. Bishop Hunter used 
to put the matter in these words: 
"Brethren, pay your tithing and be 
blessed;" and that is just what I mean. 

It is not necessary, perhaps, for me 
to say that there never was a time 
since the organization of the Church 



when it was more necessary than it is 
at present for all the Latter-day Saints 
to live their religion and to keep the 
commandments of the Lord, to purge 
from their midst iniquity, folly and sin 
and the transgression of the command- 
ments of the laws of God unto them. 
I may add to this that perhaps thers 
never was a time when the work of the 
Lord in the earth was in greater earn- 
est or reality than it is today. As 
a proof of this, we need only to open 
our eyes and see the energy and activ- 
ity of the enemies of this people at the 
present time. When the wicked rage 
and the heathen imagine a vain thing 
relative to this people, we may set it 
down as a fact that the devil is not 
dead, and that the work of the Lord is 
not dead, either. 

We are lacking in much that is good 
and necessary. One of the things that I 
think i3 very necessary is that we 
should teach our boys mechanism, 
teach them the arts of industry, and 
not allow our sons to grow up with 
the idea that there is nothing honorable 
in labor, except it be in the profession 
of law, or in some other light, practic- 
ally unproductive and, I was going to 
say, unremunerative employment, but 
I know of scarcely any employment 
more remunerative than is the practise 
of law, to those, at least, who are pro- 
ficient. But what do they do to build 
up the country? What do they produce 
to benefit the world? There may be a 
few of them who have farms; there 
may be a few of them who have manu- 
factories; there may be a few of them 
who may be interested and engaged in 
ether productive labor, something that 
Mill build up the country and the peo- 
t le and establish permanence, stability 
and prosperity in the land; but the vast 
majority of them are leeches upon the 
body politic and are worthless as to the 
building up of any community. There 
are a good many of our boys who feel 
that they could not be farmers, and 
that the pursuit of farming and stock- 
raising is beneath their dignity. There 
are some who think it is menial and 
low for them to engage in building en 
terprise's as masons, carpenters or 
builders in general. There are but a 
few of our boys who take to the ham- 
mer and the anvil and to those pursuits 
of labor that are essential to the per-

manence of any community in the 
Tiorld and that are necessary to build 
up the country. 

I say that we are remiss and slack 
In relation to these things, that we are 
not instilling them sufficiently in the 
minds of our children, and that we are 
not giving them the opportunity that 
they should enjoy of learning how to 
produce from the earth and the ma- 
teiials that are on the face of it or in 
the bowels of it, that which is neces- 
sary for the advancement and pros- 
perity of mankind. Some of us have 
the idea that it is degrading for our 
daughters to learn how to cook, how 
to keep house, or to make a dress, 
apron or bonnet, if necessary. No. 
Daughters in families that are blessed 
with plenty of means are taught to 
play the piano, to sing, to go out in 
scciety and spend their time in idle, 
useless pleasure, instead of being 
taught how to be economical, indus- 
trious and frugal and how to become 
gocd housewives. That is degrading! 
I would like to say to this congrega- 
tion, and to the world, that if I pos- 
sessed millions of dollars I would not 
b» satisfied or content in my mind 
unless my boys knew how to do some- 
thing that would bring them in a liv- 
ing, how to handle a pitchfork, or to 
run a mowing machine or reaper, or 
how to plow the ground and sow the 
seed; nor would I be satisfied if my 
daughters did not know how to keep a 
house. T would be ashamed of my 
children if they did not know some- 
thing of these things. 

"We need manual training schools in- 
stead of so much book-learning and the 
stuffing of fairy tales and fables, which 
are contained in many of our school 
bcoks of today. If we would devote 
more money and time, more energy and 
attention to teaching our children man- 
ual labor in our schools than we do, it 
would be a better thing for the rising 
generation. 

There are many subjects of this 
character, in addition to the principles 
of the Gospel of eternal truth and the 
plan of life and salvation, that can be 
dwelt upon with profit by those who 
may speak to us. 

Now, I do not desire to prolong my 
remarks this morning. I pray God to 



bless those who may speak to us and 
inspire them to say those things that 
will be instructive and beneficial, and 
that we may all enjoy that measure of 
the spirit of intelligence that we may 
divide rightly the word of truth, and 
that we all may receive meat in due 
season. That God may grant us these 
privileges and blessings is my prayer, 
in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER SEYMOUR B. YOUNG. 
Manual training should he embodied in educa- 
tional system. Devotion and progress in 
Sabbath Schools-Material and spiritual pro- 
gress among the people— Missionary success 
paralleled by opposition— Joseph Smitn a 
genuine Prophet. 

My beloved brethren and sisters, I 
desire very much that you will grant 
me your faith and prayers and earnest 
attention. I feel highly honored this 
morning in being called to address this 
large congreation. We have another 
privilege of assembling together in our 
annual conference, and I feel, for one, 
very thankful for this privilege. My 
heart goes out in gratitude to mv heav- 
enly Father for the conditions of pros- 
perity that surround His people today. 
I have a testimony to bear, and it is 
the same testimony that I have been 
able to bear for many years. It is the 
truth, as I have heard it from the lips 
of my father before me, and from the 
lips of my brethren. 

When I observe, as I do, the condi- 
tions of the Latter-day Saints in the 
different Stakes of Zion where I have 
the privilege of visiting occasionally; 
when I see the chances that our young 
people have to advance along the lines 
of mind and spirit culture, I rejoice 
exceedingly to find so many of our 
young men and young ladies taking the 
opportunity offered them, and prepar- 
ing themselves fairly well on the lines 
of culture for the great work that is 
before them. But, with the feelings 
expressed by President Joseph F. 
Smith, I have sometimes regretted, and 
do regret today, the lack of physical or 
manual training in our general system 
of education. President Young used to 
say that the education of the youth 
was incomplete without this manual 
training and the cultivation of those 
attributes of the human mind which 
would lead to the development of 
strength and ability to produce from

the earth and from the elements sur- 
rounding- us. This, I realize, is the 
case with us today to a certain ex- 
tent. 

I do not feel to find any fault what- 
ever with our institutions of learning', 
or with those men and women who de- 
vote themselves so faithfully to the 
training of our young people in the 
Church schools and in the different aux- 
iliary organizations of the Church. 
Let me say here in relation to our 
Sunday schools, that they have be- 
come a very excellent part of the train- 
ing- of our young people. They begin at 
the very beginning, as it were. Our 
Sunday school teachers commence with 
the little children and work with them 
until they reach the advanced grades, 
devoting their time to this labor of love 
to a degree that does not exist perhaps 
among other people. This devotion, is 
manifest by all, from the Sunday school 
Union Board down to the last and least 
teacher in the organization. They not 
only devote their time every Sabbath, 
but on week days they spend hours and 
hours in the development of their own 
minds along the line of the educational 
welfare of the children. I say, they 
ought to be praised for this devotion, 
and they certainly are blessed in their 
labors. 

In regard to this manual training, I 
feel that our schools and colleg-es are 
incomplete, and will remain so until 
we have in every one of them a sys- 
tem of training that will develop the 
pupil along- the lines of manual culture 
in the most useful trades. Today, as 
has been truly remarked, we are in a 
condition of great prosperity. Go where 
I may throughout the length and 
breadth of the Stakes of Zion, I find 
the people in a condition of worldly 
comfort. There are very few who are 
actually in want among- the Latter-day 
Saints. Especially is this the case in 
the outside Stakes of Zion. Away from 
these populous cities like Salt Lake 
City, it is the exception to find an in- 
digent person. The fact that we have 
some of them here is accounted for by 
the tendency of the poor and those 
who are more or less financially help- 
less to flock to these centers of popula- 
tion. But, speaking g-enerally, there 
exists today a condition of prosperity 
among the Latter-day Saints. And I 



believe I can truthfully say, too, that I 
have seen decided marks of improve- 
ment and evidences of advancement 
among the Latter-day Saints along the 
lines of faith and the cultivation of the 
princples of the Gospel. There has been, 
spiritual advancement as well as ad- 
vancement in other directions. I am 
glad to be able to say this. I testify 
to you who are assembled here that 
the Latter-day Saints are a very choice 
people, and that they are working very 
diligently and faithfully in almost ev- 
ery Stake of Zion. Most of them, in 
all the Stakes, seem to be impressed 
with the spirit of their religion. I am 
glad this is so. In it I see the results 
of the teachings of our leaders. The 
brethren and sisters have awakened to 
a sense of their condition, and have re- 
newed their diligence in paying their 
tithes and offerings. I see the blessings 
of heaven showered down upon the 
people, and I know it is the result of 
their obedience to the principle that has 
been so sacredly observed by them, es- 
pecially in the last few years. Since 
they have obeyed that law more faith- 
fully the blessings of the Lord have 
been more abundantly poured out upon 
them from one end of the land to the 
other. The quotation of Bishop Hunter's 
has been truly verified; "Pay your tith- 
ing and be blessed." We do feel we are 
blessed when we obey this law. 

Commensurate with our present con- 
dition of happiness and advancement, 
as a result of the blessings of the Lord 
upon us, we may expect to find oppo- 
sition in the minds of the people of the 
world. It has been the history of this 
people from the first that as they ad- 
vanced in faith and power through their 
obedience to the principles of the Gos- 
pel our enemies have increased in their 
endeavors to put down the truth and 
stay the progress of this work. I speak 
of this as a matter of history, not to 
throw any blame upon any individual. 
"We know, my brethren and sisters, that 
the powers of evil are upon the face of 
the land today, as they have been ever 
since the organization of the Church; 
and they have been more manifest as 
the people have grown in faith and 
power. I saw not long ago a play 
represented, and in it was the 
character of Satan. He said, "I rule the 
earth; my power is everywhere." I

thought within my own heart, how true 
that is, in a sense; but on further re- 
flection I was led to exclaim in my 
heart, "And the power of God is every- 
where als,o." The same thought brought 
to my remembrance the sentence that 
"God and one good man are a major- 
ity." 

The work of the Lord is progressing. 
The Elders are laboring faithfully in 
the different missions, and success has 
crowned their efforts in most places. 
Occasionally we hear of some violent 
opposition, as for instance the misfor- 
tune that recently befell one of our El- 
ders in the South, who was severely 
beaten and maltreated. This, however, 
is no new thing. The powers of evii 
have been all the time arrayed against 
the power of the Lord and against His 
servants, in every land where they min- 
istered. We may expect opposition. I 
remember hearing of a remark that 
Sidney Rigdon made soon after he was 
mobbed with the Prophet Joseph Smith 
and dragged to insensibility through the 
woods. He asked the Prophet Joseph 
how long that was going to continue. 
How long, said" he, must we submit to 
these outrages and abuses from the 
enemies of all righteousness? The 
Prophet's reply was something like this: 
"Just so long, Brother Sidney, as the 
power of evil is upon the earth; and 
until the power of God overcomes the 
power of evil, so long will there be evi- 
dences of the power of that evil one ex- 
isting upon the earth, to the hurt and 
injury of the servants of the Lord." The 
answer made by Elder Sidney Rigdon 
was not the most hopeful. Said he, 
"Brother Joseph, I can't stand it; it is 
more than I can bear." I have some- 
times reflected upon that statement, 
and wondered whether he was wanting 
in faith through a lack of diligence or 
of purity of life, or whether it was his 
misfortune to be so organized that he 
could not grasp the situation and com- 
prehend the responsibility that was 
placed upon him. Some men are natu- 
rally weak, and soon succumb to op- 
position; while others are made of 
sterner stuff and meet all opposition 
with unswerving integrity, especially i£ 
they know for themselves that they art 
engaged in the cause of right and truth; 
for this knowledge to any man brings a 
power and a reliance that is not easily 



overcome. When I look back upon the 
great characters that have been the 
pioneers of this work, I realize that they 
have been men of strength and courage. 
The Prophet Joseph Smith, the very 
head and front of this Latter-day dis- 
pensation, was a man who was never 
known to flinch or falter, though 
through all the years of his ministry he 
was hardly for a moment free from the 
bitterness of hate exhibited by his fel- 
lowmen, and for no other reason that I 
could ever see than that he had been 
chosen by the Almighty Himself to be 
His Prophet in 'this the great dispen- 
sation of the fulness of times. The men 
who have followed him in the leader- 
ship of the Church have been equally 
tried and true. No man has ever seen 
the time when such as Brigham Young, 
Heber C. Kimball and other noted ones 
that I could mention, have failed or 
faltered in their allegiance to the 
Prophet Joseph or to the Lord Al- 
mighty. Though these men, like Broth- 
er Sidney Rigdon, received more than 
their share of persecution and opposi- 
tion, looking at it from a natural stand- 
point, yet they were never overcome. 
They had the courage of their convic-i 
tions, like their great leader, the Proph- 
et Joseph, and they stayed by them 
under all circumstances. The reason for 
it is that they received in their own 
hearts a testimony of the divinity of 
this work, and that testimony was 
burning bright in their hearts all the 
days of their lives. 

We hear about children being born in 
the Church. Yes, every Latter-day 
Saint is born in the Church, and there 
is only one birth that admits them into 
the Church, and that is the birth of 
baptism — the birth of the water and of 
the Spirit. That admits them into the 
Church of Christ, and marks them as 
the children of God. In no other way 
can they receive this birth. The great 
warrior, Napoleon, said that although 
the Savior had been dead eighteen hun- 
dred years the impress of His ministry 
and power had been so developed in the 
hearts of the human family that, not-> 
withstanding men had not beheld Him 
for centuries, His divine mission still 
moved the world. So it is with the Lat- 
ter-day Saints today. Thousands upon 
thousands have gathered here from all

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



parts of the earth. Very few are living 
who saw the Prophet Joseph Smith; but 
the power of God manifested through 
him has been so impressed upon the 
people that although we may never 
have seen him we testify that he was 
divinely inspired. Why? Because we 
have the same testimony of Jesus in 
our hearts that Peter had when the 
Master asked him, "But whom say ye 
that I am?" "Thou art the Christ, the 
Son of the living God," said Peter. 
Jesus answered him, "Blessed art thou, 
Simon Barjona; for flesh and blood 
hath not revealed it unto thee, but my 
Father which is in heaven." Peter had 
the revelation from the Father that 
Jesus was the Christ. By the same 
power we testify that Jesus is the 
Christ, and that Joseph Smith is a 
prophet of God. As a people we have 
not seen our Savior and talked with 
Him face to face; our prophets have 
that high honor and privilege, as 
far as the Lord designs they should 
have; but the Saints generally have re- 
ceived the impress and the power of the 
Holy Spirit; and although most of them 
have not seen the Lord face to face yet 
they testify that Jesus is the Christ. 
How? By the power of the living God, 
and by the witness of that Holy Spirit 
which He gives to every earnest and 
faithful believer. So the Saints, who 
have yielded obedience to the Gospel, 
know that Jesus is the Christ, and that 
Joseph Smith is a prophet of the living 
God, the President of this great dispen- 
sation of the fulness of times. 

My brethren and sisters, let us take 
heed to the admonition of our prophet 
and leader today. While we are in a 
condition of prosperity, let us not for- 
get the obligations that we owe to our 
Heavenly Father, and see to it that we 
tithe ourselves honestly before the Lord 
all the time. Let us make good every 
obligation that is laid upon us, so living 
before the Father and before each oth- 
er that we can claim a continuation of 
the great blessings that we are in pos- 
session of today. I testify to you that 
Joseph Smith was a prophet of the liv- 
ing God, and that he went to his fate 
knowing that he was to be martyred 
for the truth that God had given to 
him; yet, like his great leader, the Sav- 
ior of the world, he did not flinch or 



turn aside from the course that the 
Lord had marked out for him to pur- 
sue. In like manner the brethren who 
have been his successors have been un- 
swerving in their integrity, true to their 
faith, true to their covenants with God 
and with each other. As the Lord 
blessed them, so He is blessing His ser- 
vants and people today; and He will 
continue His blessings upon us if we 
will continue to serve Him faithfully. 
Although we may have the evidence ot 
the hatred of wicked men, that need not 
discourage us at all, but rather give us 
more determination, that through the 
grace of our Father and through the 
blessings of the Gospel we will remain 
true and faithful to Him who has thus 
blessed us. I pray that the blessings of 
the Lord may be upon the speakers dur- 
ing the remainder of this conference, 
and that the spirit of our leader may fill 
every heart and encourage every one of 
you, my brethren and sisters, and lead 
us all on in the paths of life eternal. 
In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 
The choir and congregation sang: 

The Spirit of God like a fire is burning. 
The latter-day glory begins to come 
forth. 

The visions and blessings of old are re- 
turning, 

The angels are coming to visit the 
earth. 

ELDER JESSE N. SMITH, 
(President of Snowflake Stake.) 

Brethren and sisters, I suppose I am 
a stranger to the most of you. I came 
here, however, in the pioneer year of 
1847. I remained in Utah till about 23 
years ago, when I was sent out to Ari- 
zona, where I have been ever since, 
simply for the reason, I suppose, that 
1 have never been sent anywhere else. 
I have enjoyed my labors there very 
much, and have felt a great deal of 
happiness, believing as I do that one is 
always happier in trying to do his duty 

than under any other circumstances. 
We have built up some small commu- 
nities there, and I believe that they 
compare very favorably with the other 
communities of that territory. If you 
will come out and see us, we well show 
you a people where spades grow bright 
and idle words grow dull, where jails 
are empty and barns are full. You will

observe that the paths which lead to 
the houses of worship are well worn, 
our Sunday schools are popular, and in 
all respects the people are in good con- 
dition. They are an intelligent, upright 
people. We have fairly good schools, 
and a good academy. We have had 
some difficulties to contend with of a 
physical nature. The most crying 
trouble has been the scarcity of wa- 
ter 1 — a very essential element. It is re- 
lated that a newspaper correspondent 
came out to Arizona anxious for some- 
thing to fill his paper, perhaps, and 
asked a native about affairs there. 
This man felt a pride in his country, 
and he said: We have an excellent 
country; we only lack two things — 
we are short of water and we lack good 
society. Oh! said the newspaper man, 
it is just so in hell; all they lack there 
is water and good society. But we have 
been trying to remedy these conditions. 
In the place where I live we have tried 
reservoiring. There is an abundance 
of water in the winter season, but in 
the summer season it disappears. So 
we have tried to solve the problem of 
holding the water until the time of 
scarcity. Of course, it has been in 
rather a small way; for our capital con- 
sisted mainly of our labor. When we 
had planned our first reservoir, there 
came along two gentlemen in a buggy. 
I never saw them before, and I never 
saw them after. They enquired what 
was the object of our labor there, and 
I explained to them as well as I could 
briefly. They seemed much interested, 
and as they went on they took me by 
the hand and said, "God bless you; you 
are in the right of it." Well, we have 
proved that it was a profitable invest- 
ment. 

We met with another difficulty when 
we went to that country. Although so 
long ago, we found all the facilities of 
the country were taken up. We were 
compelled to buy ranchmen out, and 
we did so at very high figures — the best 
we could do. Soon afterwards it was 
discovered that we were upon a rail- 
road grant. The authorities of the rail- 
road notified us that we were on their 
land, and that we would be required 
to go away from it or pay up. They 
had assured us earlier that no advan- 
tage would be taken of us, and that 



we could make our improvements freely. 
They even distributed among us blanks, 
which we filled out signed and execut- 
ed, setting forth that we had rights. 
But these papers were ignored after 
our improvements were made, after 
our ditches had been dug and several 
crops had been produced. We felt that 
we had made everything secure, but 
this great corporation was not above 
taking advantage in that way of a 
handful of people who were struggling 
for an existence. At this juncture the 
authorities of the Church came to our 
assistance. President Woodruff ad- 
vanced some means to' help us in mak- 
ing the purchase. Those who could, af- 
terwards refunded the money that had 
been paid on their land; the balance 
the authorities of the Church gave to 
our stake for the benefit of reservoirs 
and academies, for which we have felt 
very thankful. 

If Mrs. Nation should give us a call, 
her occupation would be gone, so far 
as smashing saloons is concerned; for 
we have none. You may remain with 
us for days and you will never hear 
profanity on our streets. I say this 
advisedly. Surrounded by a cowboy 
element, in a wild land, I think this 
speaks well for our communities. I 
believe they have the faith and the 
hope of the Gospel in them. Drunken- 
ness is entirely unknown, almost un- 
heard-of in our communities. We are 
able by our industry to secure a live- 
lihood, and, I believe, are reasonably 
contented. For my part, I can say that 
I am contented. 

May the Lord add His blessings. May 
we be enabled to be faithful to the 
trust reposed in us. Amen. 

PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 
I may be pardoned perhaps if I an- 
nounce to the young portion of the con- 
gregation that the last speaker is one 
of the two living cousins of the Pro- 
phet Joseph Smith left among us. 

ELDER E. D. WOOLLEY. 

(President of Kanab Stake.) 

My brethren and sisters, I do not 
know whether I will be able to make 
you all hear, as this is more of a con- 
gregation than we have in two or three

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



of our stakes; but I rejoice in being 
present at this conference. I realize 
that it is the duty of the presidents 
of stakes to visit the general conference 
of the Church, wherever it may be 
called, for the reason that there they 
can receive the instructions that are 
needed, and be able to impart the same 
to the people they represent. There is a 
responsibility upon every presidency of 
a stake similar in proportion to that 
upon the Presidency of the Church, and 
I realize that it is necessary for me as 
an individual to be humble and to seek 
unto the Lord for His Spirit, that I 
may be useful to my brethren and sis- 
ters, and guard and protect the inter- 
ests of the people. It requires a great 
deal of labor, thought, patience and 
perseverance to be able to detect and 
to ward off the adversary, the enemy 
of righteousness in the earth. 

The physical conditions of our coun- 
try are very similar to that which you 
have heard described by Brother Smith, 
of Arizona. We are only about three 
miles from the Arizona line; and when 
he was speaking of Mrs. Nation I 
thought that if she made a visit to our 
country she would have to go just over 
the line into Arizona to get occupation. 
There is a man established there in a 
tent, and he dispenses liquor, and en- 
tices some of our young people down to 
play cards. But we have no saloons or 
places of that kind in our county. 

The spiritual condition of our people 
is fairly good. We have good Latter- 
day Saints, who are conscientiously try- 
ing to keep the commandments of the 
Lord, and they have an abiding testi- 
mony of the Gospel, which they are try- 
ing to maintain by living uprightly be- 
fore the Lord. I have felt that of all 
the gifts of the Gospel which follow the 
believer, we should seek for the gift of 
discernment of spirits. I have asked 
the Lord to give me this gift; for I can 
see that the adversary will work upon 
the minds of tjie people, and one of the 
great safeguards against 1his is for the 
Latter-day Saints to possess this gift, 
that they may ward off the adversary 
and his temptations, or any influence 
that is calculated to bring up doubts 
in their minds and cause them to com- 
plain and find fault and to think that 
perhaps the work of God is not grow- 



ing. I can testify to you, my breth- 
ren and sisters, that the work of the 
Lord is growing, and it will continue to 
grow, whether we keep pace with it or 
not as individuals. One of the evidences 
of the truth, to my mind, is that as we 
grow and advance the heavier the op- 
position becomes against us. You take 
the opposition that has been against 
the Latter-day Saints from the time 
that the Father and the Son appeared 
to Prophet Joseph Smith down to the 
present. Considering that, it is mar- 
velous in my eyes that this people have 
made the progress that they have. They 
never could have done it if it had not 
been for the individual testimony that 
the Saints receive. And they must re- 
ceive that testimony from the Lord. It 
cannot come from our brother or our 
sister. We may encourage, »we may 
strengthen, we may build one another 
up in faith; but the testimony of the 
Spirit and the genius of this work must 
come from our heavenly Father. This 
is what I tell my children. When my 
boys went to school at Provo, I said 
to them: Now, you will study theology. 
The mechanical part you can receive; 
but the spirit, the testimony of the 
work, you must receive from our Heav- 
enly Father, and it must be through 
your humility, your faith and your 
prayers to Him. 

My experience thus far in life has 
been with the Latter-day Saints. I 
was born in the Church; I have been 
reared in the Church, and I am pretty 
familiar with the history of the Latter- 
day Saints by passing through it from 
the early settling of this valley. I came 
here as a child in 1848, and have been 
in Utah ever since. I have seen many 
trials that this people have passed 
through, and I have heard many proph- 
ecies delivered from this stand, and in 
the old Tabernacle, which I have lived 
to see fulfilled. I have heard the 
warning voice of the Prophet of the 
Lord from time to time all my life. 

Speaking in relation to the sugges- 
tions given this morning by President 
Smith concerning our financial condi- 
tion, I remember that for years before 
the financial distress of 1893 the Apos- 
tles warned the Latter-day Saints — 
they did in our stake — to prepare for a 
financial crisis. Many of the people

accepted the advice and profited by it. 
Before I left home, I had been reading 
the editorials of President Smith, and 
his remarks in different stakes, and I 
remarked to some of the brethren, there 
is going to be a financial depression, 
and that very soon, because the Presi- 
dent is beginning to warn the people. 
From the early settlement here up to 
the present time there has never been an 
approaching evil but this people have 
been warned of in ample time to avoid 
it if they would listen to the voice of 
inspiration. It has been so in all the 
history of the world. When the Lord 
has had a people upon the earth He has 
always forewarned them of any cal- 
amity that was approaching, and I 
firmly believe that He always will. "We 
should appreciate these privileges that 
we have over and above other people, 
because of the testimony and assurance 
we have that when we receive this ad- 
vice or instruction it comes through 
the inspiration of our heavenly Father. 
He is fulfilling His promises to us. He 
will guide us, if we 'will listen. He will 
give us every opportunity to grow and 
expand, and to become a noted people 
in the earth. He is magnifying this 
people in the eyes of the people of the 
world today, and He will continue to do 
this. I have no fear of the growth and 
prosperity of this work. I have no fear 
of the leaders of this work not receiving 
the necessary inspiration for the guid- 
ance of this people. I believe that the 
majority of the Latter-day Saints have 
a testimony of this, and will have un- 
derstanding hearts and listening ears to 
receive these instructions and to profit 
thereby. In our stake we have a good 
people. We are similar to other stakes; 
•sve have good Latter-day Saints, we 
have good "Mormons," we have luke- 
warm "Mormons" and we have a very 
few that are not of our faith, at all. 

.May the Lord bless us at this con- 
ference, that we may receive those 
things that are calculated to build up 
and strengthen us in our faith, that we 
may magnify the Lord in the earth and 
establish His kingdom, is my prayer in 
the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER BYRON SESSIONS. 
(President of Big Horn Stake.) 
My dear brothers and sisters, I feel 
grateful to my Heavenly Father for this 



honor that is bestowed upon me this 
morning in being called to address you 
and to represent the Big Horn Stake 
of Zion. I feel proud of the people 
that you have sent into that stake. I 
presume that there are before me many 
of the fathers and mothers, the sisters 
and the brothers of that body of peo- 
ple that compose the Saints in the Big 
Horn Stake of Zion. I wish to say 
to you that I feel proud of them. They 
have honored me -in my position. I 
never have had yet an unpleasant 
word from one of the colony in the Big 
Horn stake in the last three years. It 
is three years the 22nd of this month 
since I left my home in Rich county, 
in the Woodruff Stake of Zion, to go to 
that land, according to a call; and I 
feel to thank the brethren for that call. 
I thank my Heavenly Father that 1 
was taken up root and branch and 
moved into that land. I feel satisfied 
now with my labors, which I never 
have been before. As has been said by 
Brother Woolley, I was born and raised 
in the Church, and I was born in your 
beautiful city, and immediately after 
my birth was taken to what is known 
as Bountiful. I thank my Heavenly 
Father that my parents have obeyed 
every law that God has revealed for 
them to obey; and I thank my Heaven- 
ly Father that a great portion of the 
people in our land have obeyed those 
laws, and are the issue from some of 
the highest laws that God has ever re- 
vealed. Do not worry about your 
sons and your daughters. Do not 
think that they are going to starve to 
death in that land. We have a goodly 
land, and we are prospering. Our 
canal is finished. The brethren are 
fencing their farms, and were plowing 
their land long before I left home, and 
I left there two weeks ago last Wed- 
nesday. I can truthfully say that none 
of them have mortgaged their farms, 
for the simple reason that they have 
not the title to them yet, and I thank 
the Lord for it. We propose to keep 
them out of the title just as long as 
possible; we do not want them to 
have it till we have complied with the 
laws of our state. We love the laws of 
our state. I believe that there is no 
better laws in any state of the Union 
than they have in the state of Wyom- 



10 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



ing. We love the executive; we love 
the officials of that state. I have 
been fortunate enough to live for 30 
years on the borders of the state of 
Wyoming-, and all the business that I 
transacted has been transacted in that 
state. I have known two of the su- 
preme judges for over 26 years, and I 
have known the governor for 26 years, 
and I have known nearly every state 
official. I have had the honor of being 
in that legislative body in connection 
with President Osmond of the Star Val- 
ley stake, during the winter; and I 
have gone to the governor of that state 
just as I would go to my father when- 
ever any doubt or dubiety pertaining to 
any measure that was for the welfare 
of the common people has arisen. I 
have gone to him and got his advice. 
The first thing he told me before he let 
loose of my hand when I went there 
was, "Now, then, I want you, Byron, 
to use my office just as if it was your 
own, and my secretary; I want you to 
come to my home and visit me and stop 
all night with me and eat with me." 
The same with the supreme judges. 
They want our people in that land. 
They invite us there. They know that 
when the authorities of our 
Church take hold of a propost- 1 
tion, whether it be in building 
canals or anything else, there is no 
doubt in their minds in regard to the 
success. They have learned that we 
have the only successful colonization 
people that there is in that land. They 
have tried it repeatedly, and they have 
made failures. In a great many in- 
stances men have come to me and 
wanted information. "How can we han- 
dle a people like this people are han- 
dled by Mr. Woodruff and yourself?" 
Apostle Woodruff, you know, we look 
upon as our father, as our common in- 
structor and guide in that land, in tem- 
poral matters as wey as in spiritual 
matters; and I thank my Father in 
Heaven for him. I thank my Father 
that I have become so thoroughly ac- 
quainted with him, although sometimes 
it has been quite a trial for me to foj- 
low him, I followed him about 15 days 
before coming down here, holding one 
end of a surveyor's chain and he hold- 
ing the other, and I thought he would 
walk me to death. There was no lie 



down, no stop. He has that same de- 
sire and anxiety in his heart regarding 
the work up there. He has remarked to 
me that he would rather die than see it 
fail. I have made that remark, and I 
make it again. Send men there, 
if you are going to send men, that 
are not afraid to labor. I endorse every 
word, and thank God for the words that 
we have heard here this morning from 
our Prophet. Let us keep out 
Of debt, brethren. Let us be true; let 
us not be traitors to our brethren and 
to one another. Preach the Gospel by 
honoring ourselves and honoring the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ and those who 
have in charge His work here in the 
earth. Preach it by being honorable to 
our fellow-man. I teach the people in 
our country to put up the fences of 
their neighbors, Jew or Gentile; drive 
the cattle out of their fields; lift the 
poor cattle out of the mire, and show 
unto them that we do believe the teach- 
ings of our Lord and Savior. That is 
the way I propose to preach the Gos- 
pel to the people, until I am directed 
otherwise, as well as sitting down by 
their firesides and preaching it to them. 
I tell you that example has more effect; 
it has been my observation through 
life, in preaching the Gospel to men 
who do not believe as we do. We have 
a desire to bring them into the fold. 
They are my brothers and my sisters, 
and it is my business to show unto 
them by example that I do believe that 
which I preach. 

Brothers and sisters, I pray that God 
may bless this conference, bless our 
Prophet and these Apostles, and help 
us to be true to them, to honor them in 
their positions, and not to be traitors. 
It would not be a healthy thing for a 
traitor, if ever I sat on a jury to try 
him. God bless you, in the name of 
Jesus Christ.

Though deep'ning trials throng your

Press on, press on, ye Saints of God; 
Ere long the resurrection day 
Will spread its life and truth abroad. 

ELDER B. H. ROBERTS. 

With you, my brethren and sisters, I 
rejoice in the privileges and blessings 
of this conference. The presence of so 
many upon the opening day of confer j 
ence bespeaks the widespread interest 
that exists among the Latter-day 
Saints in the work of God. I take it 
that we are all interested in all the af- 
fairs of the Church, in all phases of the 
work, both the work within the stakes 
of Zion and the work abroad among 
the nations of the earth. But while we 
have this general interest in all depart- 
ments of the great works of our Fa- 
ther, it is but natural that we should 
have a particular interest in that de- 
partment of it in which more especially 
we are called to labor. I make this re- 
mark in order that you may understand 
why it is that I address a few words to 
the conference in relation to that body 
of Priesthood over which, in connec- 
tion with the other presidents of the 
First Council of Seventy, I am called 
to preside. 

We have in the church 143 quorums 
of Seventy. There would be over 10,000 
men in that body if all the quorums 
were full; but some of them are not full. 
Others, however.have members awaiting 
admission. So that the number of Sev- 
enties today in the Church is not far 
from 10,000. They are a body of men 
set apart and especially ordained to en- 
gage in the foreign ministry of the 
Church. When you take into account 
the very extended area of country in 
which these quorums are scattered, you 
can readily understand that it requires 
considerable labor to reach these organ- 
izations and keep them fully organized 
and the vacancies in the respective 
councils filled. 



Why I refer to this subject is for the 
purpose of making a suggestion or two 
to the Presidents of stakes and the 
Bishops of wards who are gathered on 
this occasion. I think a little careful 
attention to the great amount of work 
that is required at the hands of the 
First Council of Seventy in keeping 
these quorums completely and fully or- 
ganized would make the presiding 
brethren a little cautions about taking- 
our Seventies, and especially the presi- 
dents of quorums, for local positions. 
Of course, I understand that there are 
very important offices to fill in the 
Church, and when the right man is 
found among the Seventies it is proper 
that he should be ordained to the posi- 
tion; but if one equally fitted could be 
found among the Elders or the High 
Priests I think it would be wisdom on 
the part of presidents of stakes and 
Bishops to find men for local positions 
in these quorums and not disturb the 
presidencies of the quorums of Seventy. 
Of late, when thinking upon this sub- 
ject, and the inconvenience that we are 
frequently put to, I have been much 
impressed with a principle that is 
named in the Book of Mormon. The 
passage gives a description of the man- 
ner in which the Apostles among the 

Nephites, upon this continent ordained 
men to office. It is as follows: 

"The manner which the disciples who 
were called the Elders of the church, 
ordained Priests and Teachers. 

"After they had prjayed unto the Fa- 
ther in the name of Christ, they laid 
their hands upon them, and said, 

"In the name of Jesus Christ I ordain 
you to be a Priest; (or, if he be a 
Teacher,) I ordain you to be a Teach- 
er to preach repentance and remission 
of sins through Jesus Christ, by the en- 
durance of faith on his name to the 
end. Amen." 

This is the point more especially, 
however, to which I direct your atten- 
tion: 

"And after this manner did they or- 
dain Priests and Teachers, according to 
the gifts and callings of God unto men. 

If those who in the first instance di- 
rect the footsteps of our youth into the 
quorums of the Priesthood, would take 
into account more the gifts and call- 
ings of God unto these young men, I 
think it would be possible to overcome 



12 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



some of our difficulties. The young 
men should be directed into those quor- 
ums that their natural gifts — "the 
gifts and callings of God" unto them — 
qualify them for. If it is observed in a 
young man as he develops under 
the eye of the Bishop, that 
he is possessed of executive abilities, 
then that fact should be remembered, 
and he should be directed into that 
quorum where his special training 
v ould develop the qualities he possesses 
for a career of usefulness in the 
Church. Or when a young man is found 
who is possessed of that combination 
of qualities that go to the making of 
the judicial mind; if he has the rare 
faculty of balancing one statement as 
against another; the ability to look at 
both sides of a question, and justly 
weigh the evidence; then he should be 
directed to the Elders' or High Priests' 
quorum, whose business it is to pre- 
pare men for presiding and judicial 
ceilings in the Church; and sometime 
in the future, when a High Councilor, 
or some presiding officer is required he 
might be remembered and found in that 
quorum where it would create no dis- 
turbance to take him, and place him in 
the presiding or judicial position. On 
the other hand, where men are ob- 
served to possess the ability to teach, 
^nd the spirit of testimony is strong 
upon them, and they have in them the 
mitking of a good witness for the Lord 
Ji sus Christ, let such be directed into 
the quorums of the Seventy. Thus, if 
we stand down the line where we be- 
gin to divide men off in the direction 
of their life's labors in the Church, and 
consider "the gifts and callings of God 
unto them," I think we can help the 
conditions of which I am now speak- 
ing. In any event, while present con- 
ditions exist, local presiding officers, I 
am sure, would confer a great favor 
Uf.on the First Council of Seventy, if 
they took more into account the in- 
convenience and the increase of labor 
they make us when they choose men 
from among the presidencies of the 
quorums of seventy, when others could 
be found who would fill the positions 
equally well. 

While speaking on the subject of the 
Seventy. I wish to call attention to 
one of the great things laid before us 



in the opening remarks of President 
Smith. There is no body of men in 
the Church to whom his remarks on the 
matter of freeing themselves from debt, 
apply with so much force, as to the 
Seventy. The First Council is in con- 
stant communication with the Seven- 
ties in all parts of the Church territory. 
We are continually on the lookout for 
men who can go on missions. All the 
time we are corresponding with men 
who are recommended to us as worthy 
to go upon missions, but we find so 
many of them involved in debt that 
when this glorious opportunity is pre- 
sented to them of going upon a mis- 
sion, to discharge the high duties of 
their calling in the Priesthood, they art: 
barred from accepting that appoint- 
ment by reason of being financially in- 
volved. If I could say a word th 
would emphasize the teachings of the 
president upon this subject, I most 
certainly would do it, and urge upon 
our Seventies, above all men in the 
world, to free themselves from finan- 
cial obligations, that they may be at 
liberty to exercise the powers of tha 
Priesthood in preaching righteousness 
to the world, and in standing before it 
as witnesses of the truth of the Gospel 
of Jesus Christ. 

In the opening remarks of our presi 
dent texts were given to the Elders of 
Israel which they can expound and 
teach with very great profit to the 
people; and I believe that upon those 
various subjects in this conference 
there will be words spoken that will 
throw great light and intelligence upon 
those subjects. The matter of encour- 
aging our young men to engage in me- 
chanical arts and trades is a matter 
that calls for most earnest attention 
and wisest consideration on the part 
of the leading brethren in Israel, and 
from fathers and mothers everywhere. 
The fact that it becomes necessary to 
call attention to such a matter is an 
indication that circumstances are un- 
dergoing a great change with us. Here- 
tofore, occupying as we do a new coun- 
try, our young men when they came 
to manhood and found a place incon- 
veniently narrow for them, had but to 
remove a few miles where lands could 
be obtained, and out of those lands 
make themselves homes and establish 



ELDER B. H. ROBERTS. 



themselves in a community where they 
would furnish themselves with employ- 
ment; and doubtless for some time to 
come there will be an outlet for our 
young people in that direction, 
although we may be required 
tc remove to greater distances 
than in the years that are past. 
But as our communities increase in 
number and our centers of population 
become more and more crowded, we 
shall find those among us — in fact, we 
do now— *who have no taste, no desire, 
to engage in the kind of life incident to 
opening new lands and establishing 
new communities; and of necessity they 
must turn their attention to the acquir- 
ing of skill in some kind of useful la- 
bor. It will be impossible for all to en- 
gage in the professions; for the cry al- 
ready, is that the professions are over- 
crowded. But in connection with turn- 
ing our attention to the acquirement of 
skill in mechanical arts and trades, 
there is a question which we must 
needs reflect upon and provide for. This 
is an age of organization, both of capi- 
tal and labor. The hosts of men that 
are engaged in the several trades have 
found it necessary in some way or other 
to portect themselves, that they may 
command a reasonable price for that la- 
bor. In other words, they have com- 
bined to control wages, just as far as it 
is possible to control them. It is beyond 
question that these organizations in 
some cases become oppressive and work 
great mischief. They feel power, and 
they forget right. But something had 
to be done in order to make it possible 
for labor to hold its own against the 
growing force and greed and power of 
combined capital; and whatever the ex- 
cesses may be, and however much we 
may regret them, nevertheless organi- 
zation and union on the part of labor 
became an absolute necessity to the 
working masses. The labor unions today 
to a very great extent dictate the num- 
ber that shall be permitted to enter in- 
to the various crafts and trades. They 
say ho*w many apprentices shall be al- 
lowed in the respective trades. They 
attempt to control the supply of labor 
in that way, because they do not desire 
that the supply shall be greater than 
the demand; because the greater the 
demand the better the price that may 



be asked for the labor. I do not in the 
few words that can be said on this oc- 
casion undertake to discuss this ques- 
tion at length. I merely call attention 
to its existence.. And it will become 
necessary for the Latter-day Saints in 
our centers of population to determine 
what shall be the relation of those en- 
tering into these trades to the unions 
that are controlling the trades. I mere- 
ly bring it before you, that the wise 
men in Israel may take it into account; 
for it is one of the facts that we shall 
necessarily be brought in contact with 
when we undertake to encourage our 
youth, as perforce we must, to enter in- 
to mechanical arts and trades as the 
means of sustaining themselves by their 
labor. 

The work of the Lord, President 
Smith tells us, is growing; and further 
he says there never -was a period of time 
in its history when interest in it was 
greater than today. I rejoice in that 
growth. I sometimes wonder if we com- 
prehend or even apprehend the facts 
that enter into that growth, and that 
enlargement of interest. If time would 
permit it, I should only be too glad to 
call attention, not only to the direct 
evidences of growth and of interest in 
the work of God, but also to the indi- 
rect means that God is employing in the 
matter of enlarging His work and pre- 
paring the >way for nations to be born 
within it in a day. It does seem to me 
that the whole world is fermenting with 
the leaven that God planted when He 
brought this work into the earth 
through the Prophet Joseph Smith. To 
the Church has been assigned the honor 
of the title role in God's great drama 
of the last days. But as in the drama 
the actor bearing the title role does not 
alone develop the thought of the poet's 
mind, so we as the Church of Latter- 
day Saints, though bearing the honor of 
the position assigned to us, do not con- 
stitute the only force that God is using 
in bringing to pass His great and 
mighty purposes. In his day Paul 
said that some men preached 
Christ of envy and strife, and some of 
good will; but he gloried in this fact, 
that whether preached out of envy and 
strife or of good will, the Lord would so 
overrule their actions as to bring to 
pass His purposes. I sometimes feel

amused when I reflect upon what the 
surprise of many of our enemies will be 
when they discover that the Lord has 
overruled their actions, made even of 
them instruments to accomplish His 
ends, and had so controlled their wrath 
as to make it praise Him. 

The theology of the world has 
changed since the introduction of the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ. You can find 
no minister today to voice from his pul- 
pit the doctrine of infant damnation. 
Tou can get no minister today to deny 
the possibility of continued revelation 
from God. Tou can get no minister to- 
day to undertake to defend the position 
that God, by a mere caprice of His sov- 
ereign will, "sends one to heaven and 
ten to hell"— not for any good or ill 
they have done before Him, but just for 
His glory. The doctrine which the poet 
Burns satirizes in substantially that 
language is a thing of the past in the 
pulpits of men. These modifications in 
the Christian world's theology — and a 
hundred other modifications — have been 
due chiefly to the truths God revealed 
through Joseph Smith the prophet; and 
thousands of eloquent tongues and pens 
have been employed teaching these 
truths which have led to the correction 
of many errors in religion, without 
knowing the origin of their doctrine. 

The advancement made in all the arts 
and sciences is also very materially 
helping to bring to. pass God's mighty 
purposes. We overlook, it seems to me 
sometimes, the moral force that goes 
with some of our great inventions. It 
is now about three-quarters of a cen- 
tury since the electric telegraph flashed 
from Washington to Baltimore the first 
intelligible message by" that means of 
communication. Since then that all 
parts of the world have been brought 
into instant communication with one 
another. It seemed to dawn upon the 
minds of some that if a message could 
be transmitted over wires, by means of 
sounds in dots and dashes there was no 
reason why the tones of the human 
voice could not be so communicated; 
and now, though separated by hun- 
dreds and thousands of miles, a man 
may converse familiarly with his friend 
by means of this great invention. Re- 
cently another step has been taken in 
the progress of this means of communi- 



cation, which gives us reason to believe 
that before long the wives may be dis- 
pensed with, the ocean cables may be 
abandoned, a n d out on the sensitive, 
trembling atmosphere, that touches all 
parts of the world, a message can be 
sent forth, and safely carried even 
across the great expanse of ocean, so 
that the whole round world can be 
through this means in constant com- 
munication. The moral force — the force 
that makes for faith— in these thfngs is 
this: The idea is dispelled that it is 
impossible for God, at His home, to be 
in immedate communication with the 
whole world. These mighty inventions, 
this progress in art and in science, are 
constantly developing the powers that 
are in man and the great things yiat he 
can accomplish, narrow as are his lim- 
itations at present. The result is that 
men reason after this fashion: If man 
with his limited knowledge and intel- 
lectual powers can accomplish so much, 
is it difficult to believe that God has ac- 
complished all that is accredited to Him 
in the revelations of the prophets? So 
there is in the development of these 
arts and sciences that which makes for 
faith in the power of God; and these in- 
direct means are accomplishing very 
much in preparing the minds of men 
for these great truths that are to be 
found in the revelations brought forth 
by the Prophet Joseph Smith. The 
leaven is working; and some of thesa 
days it will only be necessary to strike 
the keynote and there shall be a wide 
and broad acceptance of the things that 
God has revealed through the great lat- 
ter-day prophet. 

I rejoice in these indirect means, a» 
well as in the direct means, that the 
Lord is using for the accomplishment 
of His purposes, in preparing the way 
for the coming of His kingdom, which 
I pray m a y come quickly, in the n ame 
of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER JOSEPH H. MERRILL. 

(Late President of the Samoan Mission) 

I am truly trankful to my Heavenly 
Father for the privilege thus accorded 
me to stand before you, my brethren 
and sisters, this afternoon. I hope 
that the Spirit of God may dictate that 
which I may say, that we may all be 



ELDER JOSEPH H. MERRILL.

profited together. I have been greatly 
interested in the remarks that have 
been made thus far by the brethern, 
and I heartly endorse all that has been 
said. 

It has been my privilege for the past 
fifteen months to preside over the Sa- 
moan Mission, which consists of a few 
small islands in the Pacific ocean, about 
5,000 miles from here. No doubt, there 
are in this congregation parents, broth- 
ers and sisters of the Elders who are 
laboring upon that group, and for their 
benefit as well as for the benefit of the 
Saints in general I will give a short re- 
port of our labors upon those islands. 
We have a band of faithful brethren and 
sisters at present laboring among the 
Lamanites there, and they are enjoy- 
ing the Spirit of God even as we enjoy 
it here in conference. There is a spirit 
that is poured out upon the Elders in 
the nations of the earth which binds 
them so closely together in the bonds 
of brotherhood and love that they are 
one in very deed. The same spirit pre- 
vails here this afternoon, and it fills my 
heart with joy to meet with the Saints 
in general conference. The Samoan 
Mission, as you are more or less aware, 
has been opened nearly 15 years. Dur- 
ing- that time a great deal of work has 
been done, both manual and spiritual. 
We have at present a faithful band of 
Saints, numbering over 1,400, upon those 
islands, out of a population of about 
30,000. There is quite a number also 
who have been identified with the work, 
and, through temptation and sin, have 
fallen away and are scattered among 
the people. Strange to say, those wh:> 
are cut off from the Church there do 
not lose the testimony of the Gospel, 
but are always ready to bear a strong 
testimony to the truth as revealed 
through Joseph Smith and preached by 
the Elders. 

The report has gone out among the 
Saints at home, I believe, that the Sa- 
moan Mission is a hard mission; and 
when young people have been called to 
go to those islands I have heard some 
of the Saints remark that any place on 
earth would be preferable to the Sa- 
moan Mission. I wish to dispel that no- 
tion from your minds. I feel assured 
that in stating to you that the Samoan 
Mission is as healthy and as favorable 



a mission as an Elder can go to, I am 
only stating the truth. There has been 
some sickness among the Elders, and 
one of our number has lately passed 
away; but the same conditions exist in 
other missions. The power of God is felt 
just as strongly in the Samoan Mission 
as it is in the California Mission, or 
the Southern States Mission, or any 
place upon the face of the earth. God 
ha s a protecting hand over all His El- 
ders, wherever they are sent. So that 
when your sons and daughters are call- 
ed to take a mission to Samoa, you 
should rather ■feel to say, go and God 
bless you, than to desire the mission 
changed to some other part of the 
world. Your sons and daughters are 
safe there. God watches over and cares 
for them. His will is done concerning 
us, no matter a s to which part of the 
earth we are located upon. There is 
one thing- we can rest assured of— there 
is no accident with the Lord. Anything 
which happens to an Elder in the prose- 
cution of his duty, that takes him from 
his field of labor, is not an accident. The 
purposes of the Lord are fulfilled con- 
cerning us, no matter where we are, if 
we only yield to the promptings of His 
Spirit. 

I have a testimony which I am proud 
to be able to bear. I know that this is 
the Church and kingdom of God, estab- 
lished upon the earth in these the lat- 
ter days for the last time, never 
more to be taken away nor given to 
another people. Should we desire 
proofs to establish our belief in this 
matter. Brother Roberts has given us a 
few external evidences by which we 
may know the workings of our Heaven- 
ly Father with this people. When J 
contemplate the fact that nearly, if not 
all who sit before me this afternoon 
have the same testimony that has been 
given unto me — that the Gospel of 
Christ has been again revealed to the 
earth, and we have been made par- 
takers of it — it makes my heart rejoice, 
and I am led to exclaim in my joy to 
my Father; how great is His goodness 
towards us, His children! Then the 
thought comes to my mind: Are we liv- 
ing up _ to the opportunities that the 
Gospel affords us? We come together 
In conference and the Spirit of God 
is poured out upon us in great measure, 



16 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



as the word of God is given unto us 
through His servants. We feel to re- 
joice and are willing to give all we have 
for the work of the Lord. We feel to 
consecrate and dedicate all our pro- 
perty and all that the Lord has giver, 
us for the upbuilding of His kingdom 
upon the earth. Often in our prayers 
we dedicate unto Him all that He has 
made us stewards over, and ask Him 
for wisdom to use it acceptably before 
Him. I wonder if we really mean it on 
all occasions. If the Bishop were to 
ccme in just as you got up from your 
pi ayer and asked you , for your best 
cow, or for $100, or for five acres of 
land, to help the work of the Lord, 
would you give it up? 

God has given us the light of the 
everlasting Gospel. He has bestowed 
great promises upon us — eternal life 
exaltation and glory in the celestial 
kingdom of our God. If we will only 
keep His commandments, loving Him 
with all our might, mind and strength, 
and our neighbors as ourselves, these 
things will be ours. He has also given 
us all our earthly possessions. They 
'ire His. He can take them from us in 
a moment; He can take us in a mo- 
ment; but we cannot take any of these 
worldly things with us. Then if we 
set our hearts upon them, and they 
become greater in our sight than our 
Father and His purposes; if we regard 
the gift greater than the giver, we 
shall forfeit the blessings that are 
promised unto us. 

Brother Roberts has been speaking a 
little about the Seventies. I am a 
Seventy myself — a president of Seventy. 
I have had some experience with Broth- 
er Roberts, Brother Kimball, and a few 
of the Seventies, and I just wish to 
say a word or two to the Seventies 
present. I believe Brother Roberts 
placed us all in the same box. Whether 
he did or not, we are all there. Th" 
word comes to us to select a certain 
number from our quorum to fill mis- 
sions abroad. The presidents of the 
quorum meet together and consider the 
circumstances of the Seventies in that 
quorum. The names are selected and 
sent in. They are notified, and the word 
comes back, 'We are in debt; we can- 
not go; possibly we can go in six 
months from now." That is a long 



"minute" man, asking for six months' 
Then again, a man accepts the call. 1 
ii notified to depart at a certain time. 
But his wife does not like to lose him. 
She whines, she cries a little, and she 
■says, "Oh! what will I do when you 
are gone? What will the children do? 
You are our only support, and I don't 
see how you can go." Then the man 
has to write back and tell the First 
Council that he can't go, because his 
wife can't spare him. That is the con- 
dition of some of our "minute" men. I 
want to tell you that the woman who 
will lay a straw in the path of her hus- 
band against the fulfilling of his duty 
and calling will come under condem- 
nation before the Lord. The man that 
will be involved in indebtedness so that 
he cannot accept a call and fulfil hi^ 
duty will come under condemnation. 
The kingdom of God has been establish- 
ed in these last days, and it must roll on 
God has selected from among His peo- 
ple those who are worthy to bear this 
Priesthood, whose duty it is to carry 
this Gospel to the nations of the earth; 
and it is our duty to fulfil our calling, 
to be "minute" men, not "six months" 
men, nor. "one year" men. That is the 
calling of a Seventy; and if the Seven- 
ties are not fulfilling their calling they 
come under condemnation, and those 
of the Lesser Priesthood receive these 
calls and obtain the blessing. 

I do not make these remarks with a 
desire to find fault; but these are con- 
ditions that have come to my notice as 
existing among the Latter-day Saints. 
I heard a remark made at one time that 
the faithful Latter-day Saints would go 
back and redeem Jackson county, while 
the indifferent would stay in the val- 
leys of the mountains. These blessings 
and privileges that God has promised 
unto us through our faithfulness will b<s 
ours if we labor for them. There is 
no blessing, no reward promised except 
by obedience to the law upon which the 
blessing is predicted. This was made 
very plain to the ancient Saints, and 
has been made plain to us. It has been 
said here this morning that we should 
pay our tithes and offerings. This ds 
a commandment that God gave unto 
His people anciently, and coupled with 
this command is a blessing, even a tem- 
poral blessing. The Lord promised 



ELDER SYLVESTER Q. CANNON. 



17 



those who would obey this law that He 
Would pour out upon them such bless- 
ings that they would not have room to 
contain them. On one occasion, when 
the children of Israel were without the 
Spirit of God' and their Priests had lost 
their power, the Lord told them that it 
was not because His arm was shortened 
that He could not save, nor that He-was 
deaf that he could not hear, but it was 
because of their wickedness. In speak- 
ing to Israel through His prophet Mala- 
chi, the Lord says: 

"Bring ye all the tithes into the store- 
house, that there may be meat in mine 
house, and prove me now herewith, 
saith the Lord of hosts, if I will not 
open you the windows of heaven, and 
pour you out a blessing, that there 
shall not be room enough to receive it." 

President Snow preached to the peo- 
ple to pay their tithes and the Lord, he 
said, would pour out great blessings 
upon them. We rounded up our shoul- 
ders and paid tithing as we have never 
done before. As a consequence, the 
blessings of God have been poured out 
upon us, until today we see prosperity 
on every hand. These commandments 
are with us continually, and should re- 
ceive our attention every day. Presi- 
dent "Woodruff laid stress upon these 
words: "Get the Spirit of God and 
keep it." I would say to the Saints this 
afternoon, if you would be in the right 
path, if you would be safe from the 
snares and temptations of this world, 
get the Spirit of God and keep it; be 
humble; keep in touch with those who 
are in authority over you; seek to have 
confidence in your Bishop and his coun- 
selors and in the Teachers of the 
Church. God gives unto us His mind 
and will through His servant the proph- 
et, and it is our duty to lend a listen- 
ing ear thereto. When President Smith 
tells us it is a good thing to get out 
of debt, we should do all we can to get 
out of debt. It means something, 
brethren and sisters. There are things 
in store for the Latter-day Saints that 
we cannot see today. There are things 
coming upon us which we may be pre- 
pared to meet, if we will only take the 
counsel of the prophet of God. 

I pray that the Spirit of God may be 
poured out upon us, that when we re- 
turn to our homes the spirit of this con- 



ference may attend us and always be 
with us, that we may have a burning 
testimony within us of the. truthfulness 
of this work, that we may always have 
a desire to keep the commandments 01 
God, let come what may, and then sal- 
vation and eternal glory will be ours in 
the end. May the Spirit of God contin- 
ue with us, I ask it in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 

ELDER SYLVESTER Q. CANNON, 
(Late President of the Netherlands 
Mission.) 

It is very unexpected to me, my 
brethren and sisters, to be called upon 
to address you this afternoon, as I 
realize that there are so many here 
who are much more competent to give 
instruction, and to whom I would rath- 
er listen, as no doubt you all would, 
who have had experience in the work of 
the Lord, and the Saints are gathered 
to receive instructions, to be profited 
in their future lives. At the same time 
I rejoice to be privileged to meet with 
the Saints in general conference. It is 
the first time in eight years that I 
have been able to meet with the Saints 
in this capacity. For over three years 
past I have been in the mission field, 
and previous to that I was absent 
studying. Therefore, I appreciate prob- 
ably greater than I otherwise would 
what a grand opportunity it is to meet 
with the Saints, to partake of the spirit 
of conference, and to receive the in- 
structions which are given. As I say, I 
rejoice to be with you. I rejoice in the 
instructions which have been already 
given during this day, and I feel certain 
that during the remainder of this con- 
ference there will be a great outpouring 
of the Holy Spirit, and that we will all 
be built up and benefited if we prepare 
our hearts to receive and carry out the 
instructions. 

It is some five months since I return- 
ed from my mission to the Netherlands, 
where I was absent for three years. I 
desire to say that the work in that field 
is prospering. The outlook is excellent, 
It was at the time I left, and from news 
that I have lately received I learn that 
the condition is just as good or better 
now. The Gospel is being preached 
in Holland and Belgium of that mis-

GENERAL, CONFERENCE. 



sion, and progress is being made. There 
are 30 Elders in the field. There are 
over 2,000 Saints and children in the 
entire mission, and during the past year 
over 200 "were baptized. There was a 
greater average per missionary baptiz- 
ed during the past year in that mission 
than in any other mission in Europe, it 
being eight persons per missionary. 

Holland is recognized as a land of re- 
ligious liberty. For centuries the peo- 
ple of Holland struggled— in fact, at 
the time of the Reformation they were 
among the first to obtain religious lib- 
erty, and to be freed from that oppres- 
sion and domination which was charac- 
teristic of the countries of Europe at 
that time. On this account they have 
given religious liberty to other sects, 
and we are as free to preach there as 
almost any other religious denomina- 
tion. We are not allowed to preach 
upon the streets; but .as a matter' of 
fact, none of the religious denomina- 
tions are allowed this privilege. 
In every respect we receive the same 
protection as the other sects. The peo- 
ple are plain and honest; they are read- 
ers of the Bible, and they appreciate 
the truths of the Bible when they are 
explained. When our missionaries go 
among them with doctrines which agree 
exactly with the doctrines presented by 
our Lord and Savior as contained in the 
holy scriptures, they are received with 
welcome, generally speaking, and the 
people give them a fair hearing. As a 
result of this, the missionaries are bus- 
ily occupied in preaching the Gospel to 
that nation, and the results are appar- 
ent. The only lack is, there are not 
enough missionaries to carry the work 
on as they would like. New branches 
are being opened up, and the work is 
prospering. To a certain extent, the 
same is true of Belgium. However, that 
country has a different population — a 
people of different characteristics. They 
are almost entirely Catholic. I believe, 
however, that if we can get men who 
are intelligent and energetic, and who 
understand something of the French 
language, the work in that country will 
be a great help to the work there. It 
is developing slowly at present, and I 
believe there is a greater fu- 
ture for it. I also feel that there is 
a work to be done in France; for a 



number of those who have accepted 
the Gospel in Belgium were born in 
France, coming especially from north- 
ern France; and from persons with 
whom I have talked in regard to con- 
ditions in that country I gather that 
the people are somewhat of the same 
nature as those in Holland. They de- 
sire religious liberty, and they wish 
to learn the truth. During my mission 
I read an article in one of the papers 
in Holland, to the effect that there is 
a certain division of the Catholic 
church called "Old Catholics." They 
separated from the Catholic church 
several centuries ago; and the article 
stated that at least a part of that sect 
believe that Elijah the Prophet is to- 
return and bring a message from the 
heavens, and they are waiting his re- 
turn. It seemed to me that to a cer- 
tain extent these people were prepared 
to receive the Gospel. If it should 
be testified to them that the Prophet 
Elijah had come, and that he had re- 
stored that which was his province to 
restore, it might be a message of glad 
tidings to them, in connection with the 
principles of the Gospel as they have 
been revealed in these latter days. 

I believe there is a great work to be 
done in those nations, and in other 
nations of Europe and of the world. 
It was my privilege, during my ab- 
sence, to make a journey, in company 
with President. Francis M. Lyman, 
throughout several of the countries of 
Europe, Africa and Asia, visiting 
among others the Holy Land; and 
upon our return we passed through 
Italy. I was agreeably disappointed 
in the condition of that people. From 
the idea we obtain here at home, from 
seeing the Italians who are in our 
midst, we are apt to gain an entirely 
wrong view of the Italians as a people. 
They are a fine people, a people of in- 
telligence, a people of hospitality and 
kindness in every respect, and a people 
many of whom, I believe, will accept 
the Gospel in the future. There are 
no missionaries in that field at the pres- 
ent time. As we know, Apostle Lo- 
renzo Snow was sent there to open that 
field many years ago, but no great suc- 
cess was obtained at that time. 

I rejoice in the Gospel. I rejoice in 
the testimony I have received of the 



ELDER CHARLES KELLEY.

truth of it. I trust that we may all 
go forward, faithfully performing our 
duty from time to time. There is a 
great responsibility resting upon the 
Latter-day Saints. There is a serious 
responsibility resting upon the young 
men to qualify themselves, spiritually, 
morally and physically, to preach the 
Gospel, to be pillars of strength in the 
Church of our God, and to perform 
every labor which they are called upon 
to perform. After being absent from 
this city preaching the Gospel, and re- 
turning home, one notices probably 
more than one who is at home continu- 
ally the changes that have occurred, 
and the temptations which are con- 
stantly increasing in this city. It may 
be the same in other cities and towns. 
Trials and temptations surround our 
young people which tend to cause them 
to be thoughtless, to go after the pleas- 
ures of the . world, and to consider sim- 
ply those things which will give them 
pleasure fcr the time being. For this 
reason I believe there is a slight ten- 
dency to devote ourselves more to 
these useless pleasures than to the 
serious things of life; to be consider- 
ing always how we can obtain worldly 
enjoyment rather than how we can 
make progress in the Gospel and be of 
use to our fellowmen. I believe it is 
of great importance to the young peo- 
ple among the Latter-day Saints that 
they should endeavor to cultivate a 
spirit of earnestness and of serious- 
ness in regard to the responsibilities 
which rest upon them. And we have 
heard many times, those who are now 
pillars of the Church, who have en- 
dured many years, and whose hair has 
grown white in the service of the 
Lord, will not always be with us; and 
those who are growing up will have to 
bear off the kingdom on their shoul- 
ders, and assuredly it is important that 
they should prepare themselves for 
these responsibilities. The kingdom 
is constantly growing, the responsibili- 
ties are becoming constantly greater, 
and the Lord requires more and more 
instruments to accomplish His pur- 
poses upon the earth. 

T rejoice, my brethren and sisters, to 
be with you. I pray that the Spirit 
of the Lord may be with us continual- 
ly, that perfect unity and harmony 



may prevail among us, that we may 
profit greatly by this conference, that 
we may take to heart the instructions- 
we receive, and that they may be as 
seed which when planted in our hearts- 
shall grow and bring forth fruit that 
will be of great benefit to the Church, 
to one another, to our fellowmen, an 3" 
to the country in which we live, that 
we may be wise and prudent in ful- 
filling the responsibilities which rest 
upon us as citizens of this great coun- 
try. May we be blessed in fulfilling: 
every duty which rests upon us, I de- 
sire to testify that I know that the 
Gospel is true; that the Latter-day 
Saints are in possession of the truth 
as it has been revealed from heaven; 
that Joseph Smith was a prophet of 
God; that his successors have been and 
are prophets of God, and that those 
upon this stand who have been called 
and sustained as leaders of this Church 
are in very deed men of God, who re- 
ceive revelations from Him for the 
guidance of this people. May we sup- 
port them fully. May we be united in 
nil things, and may we endeavor to 
improve ourselves and our opportuni- 
ties from day to day, that we may be 
finally saved in the kingdom of heaven, 
is my prayer in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 

PRESIDENT SMITH. 

It gives me pleasure to say to the 
congregation that the last speaker is 
a son of our late lamented President 
George Q. Cannon. It always gives me 
pleasure to see the sons of men who 
have been faithful in the Church fol- 
lowing in the footsteps of their fath- 
ers. 

ELDER CHARLES KELLY. 

(President of Boxelder Stake.) 

Beloved Saints, I trust that the Lord 
w ill give me utterance the few mo- 
ments I may stand before you in re- 
sponse to the request made by our be- 
loved president. I appear before you 
as a representative of the Boxelder 
Stake of Zion, one of the oldest Stakes 
of Zion, located in the extreme north 
of our state, bordering on to southern 
Idaho and eastern Nevada, bounded on 



20 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



the east by Hyrum and Cache Stakes, 
and on the south by Weber Stake. We 
number about 7,000 members of the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Spints. In our Stake we have a little 
over 1,500 who bear the holy Aaronic 
and Melchisedek Priesthoods — a strong 
army of workers; and we're all alive, 
active and energetic in the perform- 
ance of the sacred duties required of 
that priesthood and authority which 
God has restored to the earth, we 
would certainly be a strong and a 
powerful Stake of Zion. I am pleased 
to report to this conference our condi- 
tion as a stake. I am pleased to say 
that the presidency of the stake are 
united and love each other. We unite 
on every proposition before we go be- 
fore the people. We have a High Coun- 
cil who are united with the presidency 
of the stake. We hold High Council 
meetings orrce a month, and at each of 
these meetings all matters of general 
interest to our wards and organizations 
are discussed and a thorough under- 
standing arrived at. We are active in 
visiting the wards, of which there are 
13 in the stake, together with three 
branches. I am pleased to tell you thr> 
the same spirit which prevails with the 
presidency and High Council can be 
found in every ward. The Boxelder 
Stake of Zion in the Last seven years 
has doubled its tithing, accepting the 
counsel of our former and beloved 
President of the Church, Lorenzo 
Snow, who counseled this whole 
people to more fully observe that 
law and get closer to the Lord 
and receive His blessings. Our stake 
has been endeavoring to carry out that 
advice, and I testify that we have got 
nearer to the Lord. 

There is a greater spirit of union and 
love for the truth among our people to- 
day than ever in my experience of be- 
tween thirty and forty years among 
that people. That principle taught by 
President Snow years ago, by which we 
got together in our temporal interests 
and established what we called the 
United Order; that principle of co-op- 
eration by which all were employed in 
some industry or another — the spirit of 
that principle has not left our stake 
entirely. In those days we had no idle 



boys and girls, no idle men and women, 
in our county. We had employments 
established there that took in every- 
body. We had a peculiar currency, by 
which we met our obligations. It was 
a scrip that was made suitable to our 
conditions, in which our brethren and 
sisters were paid from the shoeshop, the 
carpenters, the blacksmiths, the dress- 
makers, the dairy workers, and from 
the other departments, thirty in num- 
ber, that were organized in that stake. 
For years, my brethren and sisters, 
there was love, union and industry in 
the midst of that people. But for some 
cause or other, misfortune came — shall 
I say through the providence of the 
Lord? We say that the Lord doeth all 
things well, and that nothing happens 
but what He knows about. At any rate, 
misfortune came to us. The enemy 
came upon us and assessed us between 
$10,000 and $11,000 for circulating our 
scrip, which was never intended for or 
passed as money, and we got but very 
little of it back from the government. 
Fire destroyed our woolen factory, 
which entailed a loss of between $30,000 
and $40,000; but the unity of the people 
was sufficient for the occasion, and it 
was rebuilt. We are an industrious 
people now, but we have not got those 
institutions in our midst. You will re- 
member that Boxelder Stake was not- 
ed throughout the Church for its co- 
operation, for its United Order. But 
while the institutions of that order have 
gone the principle by which they were 
created and governed so many years, 
under the administration of President 
Snow, has not left our people. We are 
a united people. In our stake we have 
not got a secret order or combination 
outside of the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints. When a young man 
comes to our Priesthood meeting with a 
recommend from his Bishop to be or- 
dained an Elder, the question is put to 
him, Are you a member of any secret 
order? So far, the answer has been 
"No" in every instance. We are trying 
to educate our brethren and sisters 
against the introduction of these evils. 
Many years ago we taught these prin- 
ciples to our people, and though many 
attempts have been made to introduce 
these orders into our stake they have 
been without effect. I am pleased to

make that statement to you at this con- 
ference. 

I was very much pleased with the re- 
marks of Elder Roberts touching these 
matters. A brother came to me the 
other day, and asked if a trades union 
was a secret order, and whether it was 
so considered by the authorities of the 
Church. I said I did not know how the 
authorities viewed trades unions, but I 
would consider them secret orders. It 
is a system by which one man is pro- 
tected and another is turned adrift. 
His family may be suffering for the" 
necessaries of life; he m a y be a skilful 
mechanic and an honest laborer; but if 
he is not a member of a certain union 
he cannot get employment. I told the 
brother that in my opinion trades un- 
ions are secret orders and come un- 
der the orders described in the Book of 
Mormon. I feel that their effects will 
be felt by and by in the world, and also 
among us if we unite ourselves with 
them. I asked the question through one 
of the Apostles, whether this order was 
considered among the secret orders, and 
I received the word that to all intents 
and purposes it was, and they 
should be discouraged. I am thank- 
ful that in our stake thus far they 
have been discouraged. I am thank- 
ful that we are as good a people as 
we are; but I do not want you to think 
that we are ail perfect by any means. 
We have saloons in our midst; we 
have apostates; we have half-hearted 
"Mormons;" we have those who are op- 
posed to God and His work; but the 
great majority of the people are on the 
Lord's side, and are desirous of serving 
Him and keeping His commandments. 
We have glorious prospects before us 
in the stake at present. We have a new 
sugar factory in course of erection; we 
have a new railroad being built through 
our valley; we have the prospect of an 
east side canal from the Bear river can- 
yon, converting into farms, orchards, 
and beautiful homes some 23,000 acres 
on the east side of the river that are 
now barren and almost worthless. The 
canal is partly built, but whether it will 
be finished or not is an unsettled ques- 
tion at present. With these conditions 
before us we have splendid prospects in 
the Boxelder Stake of Zion. We will 
have plenty of work for idlers. If there 



are any families, good members of the 
Church, that will come along to the 
Boxelder stake and help raise beets, 
build the railroad and make a canal, 
and redeem the land that is yet open 
for purchase at a nominal figure, we 
will welcome them, and will not be un- 
der the necessity of going to Canada or 
to any far-off state to look for em- 
ployment. 

A serious problem that confronts this 
people today is, What shall we do 
with our boys and girls? It is true, 
many of them are going to the colleges 
and being educated; but it is only the 
brain that is being educated, not the 
hand. They are not getting that intel- 
ligence which takes the crude material 
and makes it subservient to our use, to 
make our homes comfortable, and to 
furnish our own shoes, hats and bon- 
nets and other things that we send our 
substance for to other places and thus 
build them up instead of ourselves. I 
feel that the day is not far' distant 
when the principles presented by Pres- 
ident Brigham Young to this Church 
will be more fully carried out; for we 
have a man at our head today who is 
looking after the interests of Zion, 
whose pen is busy daily on some of the 
most timely articles that we have read 
for years. Read the Juvenile Instruc- 
tor, the Improvement Era, and the Des- 
eret News, and there you get the word 
of the Lord from His servants, who 
cannot reach us all by their voices. I 
thank God for these men. I thank God 
for the past prophets — for President 
Young, the mighty Moses of latter 
times, who led this people out of bond- 
age, and planted their feet in these 
beautiful valleys of the mountains, and 
located our cities and towns. I am 
proud of the name of the city in which 
I live, for it is after that illustrious man 
— the city of Brigham. I rejoiced in 
sitting under the sound of his voice. I 
rejoiced in sitting under the sound of 
the voice of President John Taylor, his 
successor, upon whom fell his mantle. 
I rejoiced in the teachings of that meek 
and lowly Wilford, who, to a certain ex- 
tent, made peace between us and this 
nation by disbanding the People's 
Party and by introducing, through the 
will and revelation of God, the mani- 
festo, which stopped in a measure pro-

ceedings against this people. When he 
stood in that sacred edifice, the Temple, 
he made the statement that now the 
set time to favor Zion had come. Has 
hot that prediction been literally ful- 
filled? Just as literally as many other 
predictions that have been uttered. 

The remarks of Brother Roberts re- 
minded me of that poetical man, Parley 
P. Pratt, who wrote The Key to The- 
ology, and who prefaced one of his 
chapters with these lines: 

"Oh, Mystic Babel, long has been thy 
reign! 

What direful evils follow in thy train! 
The veil is rent— thy mystery revealed, 
Angels cry woe! and God thy doom 

has sealed. 
The nations, from thy long and dreary 

night, 

Are waking now to everlasting light." 

I 

Those words rang in my ears as Elder 
Roberts called our attention to these 
modern improvements. Light has come 
into the world. The axe has been laid 
at the root of all false doctrine. That 
is why our friends the ministers are 
trembling. That is why the churches 
are fearful. Light and truth have 
come into the world, and they will 
prevail. God. ha s established this 
work; it is not ours. He has given us 
pastors after His own heart, to feed us 
with knowledge and understanding. I 
am thankful* to be associated with 
this people. This people are my people; 
their God is my God. I want to share 
with you, my brethren and sisters, in 
all the conditions that arise. I came 
here many years ago, and have grown 
up under the light and intelligence that 
has come from God through His ser- 
vants. I have sat for over 35 years, 



with very few exceptions, under the 
droppings of this holy sanctuary while 
the Prophets of the Most High have fed 
us with knowledge and understanding, 
and I hope to enjoy that privilege many 
years yet. 

I pray God to bless the Latter-day 
Saints, to fill us with His Spirit and 
with a desire to heed the counsels that 
are given to us from those that pre- 
side. Then Zion will prosper; every 
weapon that is formed against her will 
be broken to pieces; for this is our 
Father's work, and we are told that He 
and one man are a great majority. The 
power and influence of this people are 
being felt in the earth today as never 
before, and we are only commencing. It 
is only the dawn of a brighter day; it 
is but the commencement of the work 
our Father has established in the earth, 
and which will be inspired and sustain- 
ed by Him from this time henceforth 
until the kingdoms of this world be- 
come the kingdoms of our God and His 
Christ. Ma-' He give us His grace and 
Spirit sufficient to establish His right- 
eousness in the earth, to sanctify our 
hearts in the truth, and to be guided 
unto His praise, that in the sequel of 
our days, like many who have address- 
ed us here, we may be gathered home to 
our Father and rejoice in His salvation, 
is my prayer through Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 

The choir sang: 

How are Thy servants blessed, O Lord, 

How sure is their defense! 
Eternal wisdom is their guide, 

Their help, Omnipotence. 

Benediction was pronounced by Bish- 
op Wm. B. Preston.

SECOND DAY. 



Sunday, 10 a. m. 

The choir and congregation sang: 

Now let us rejoice in the day of salva- 
tion, 

No longer as strangers on earth need 
we roam; 

Good tidings are sounding to us and 
each nation, 
And shortly the hour of redemption 
will come. 

Prayer was offered by Elder Abra- 
ham O. Woodruff. 

The choir sang the hymn which be- 
gins: 

Come, dearest Lord, descend and dwell, 
By faith and love, in every breast; 

Then shall 'we know, and taste, and feel 
The joys that cannot be expressed. 

PRESIDENT ANTHON H. LUND. 

Success of Missionaries— Prejudice giving way 
— Zion progressing — In relation to tithing— 
Proper use of riches— Reckless speculation 
should be avoided. 

I rejoice this morning in seeing such 
a large congregation before me. Zion 
is growing, and the people are trying to 
live their religion. In looking back up- 
on the past year we see that the Lord 
has been with His work and blessed His 
servants in their labors. The mission- 
aries abroad have been successful in 
reaching the people and in bringing 
many into the Gospel fold. They have 
met some opposition; but as a general 
thing our people are getting better 
known in the world. In Germany some 
of our Elders have been exiled, and 
others notified to leave; but the courts 
have taken it under consideration, and 
It is not yet decided whether our Elders 
will be exiled or not. When the officers 
are asked what objection they have to 
our Elders, they say they have noth- 
ing against their lives or conduct, but 
they do not like their religion, and they 
claim the right to say who shall be 
their guests. They have this right; but 
I believe that when they reall/ exam- 
ine the fruits of "Mormonism" and see 
the effect it has upon its converts, they 
will not be opposed to our people being 
in their midst. There are several lands 



where there is not perfect freedom of 
conscience, where there are state re- 
ligions, and the people are not allowed 
to worship God in the way they be- 
lieve to be right; but gradually preju- 
dice and intolerance are giving way, 
and the most intolerant countries are 
yielding and allowing the people to be- 
lieve as they please. In Norway we 
are not recognized as dissenters; still 
the police authorities and the people 
generally who have watched our course 
are pleased with it. The police of Chris- 
tiania say that they have less trouble 
with the Latter-day Saints than they 
have with others; so we are tolerated 
there. For many years we have had a 
meetinghouse of our own in that city, 
which has been a great help to us. Last 
year we found that the foundations of 
the house were giving way, and we had 
to tear the house down; but it is being 
rebuilt: and this summer we 
hope that a better structure 
will be dedicated, and that our people 
of that city can again have their owti 
house of worship. The house in Co- 
penhagen is giving general satisfaction, 
and many people are coming to our 
meetings. There is a project on foot 
for the building of a meetinghouse in 
Stockholm, which I hope will soon be- 
gin to be realized. A brother in that 
city offered a spot upon which to build 
a meetinghouse, and we believe that the 
brethren and sisters here, especially 
from the Scandinavian countries, will 
help to build such a house there. We 
have seen the necessity of having our 
own meetinghouses in branches where 
we have such large numbers of people 
in the Church. Stockholm, Copenhagen 
and Christiania each number several 
hundred of our people, and it will be a 
blessing for them to have a place of 
their own to worship in. I believe that 
this would also be well in cities like 
Berlin and other places, where our 
branches are growing to the extent they 
are. 



24 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



We are pleased with the reports that 
come in from the different missions. 
Our Elders are laboring zealously, go- 
ing from house to house, spreading 
their tracts, preaching in the streets 
and halls wherever opportunities afford. 

In Zion the work is also progressing. 
The people seem more united, and a 
greater desire to attend meetings is no- 
ticed. The Presidency have visited 
many of the stakes, from the extreme 
north down to St. George, during the 
past year, and have found that the peo- 
ple are growing, and that the Spirit 
of God is in their midst. They show by 
their works that they are trying to live 
the lives of Saints. The tithing during 
the last year was up with the year be- 
fore and even better. We commend the 
Saints for their fulfillment of this duty. 
President Smith in his opening address 
to the conference, gave us some good 
counsel. He asked the people to be hon- 
est and fulfill their duty to theLord and 
to their neighbors. I am pleased to 
see that the people have met their 
obligations to the Lord as well as they 
have during the past year. There is 
much room, however, for improvement. 
We find that there is a large number, 
still on the books, of non-tithepayers. 
This should not be. A man who pro- 
fesses to be a Latter-day Saint ought 
to show it in his works. If he does not 
Pay his tithing, he shows there is some- 
thing wrong with him. He cannot have 
the faith which he professes to have; 
for if he did he would not be delinquent 
in this matter. It is a matter between 
him and his God. There is no compul- 
sion. But a man who has covenanted 
with the Lord to do His will cannot feel 
that he is honest with the Lord when he 
refuses to obey the calls He makes upon 
him. This law of tithing is not a new 
law. It is as old as the days of Abra- 
ham, and further back than that; but 
the first mention we have of it in the 
Bible is where Abraham paid his tith- 
ing. He believed in it; so did Jacob; 
and so did Israel. In our day the Lord 
has again revealed that law to His peo- 
ple and those who have obeyed it have 
realized the truth of what Bishop Hunt- 
er used to say: "Pay your tithing and be 
blessed." 

I would say to the people, be honest 
one to another. Do not run in debt. 



The advice of the president yesterday 
was certainly wholesome. The Lord, in 
one of His revelations given very early 
in the Church, says: 

"Seek not for riches, but for wisdom, 
and, behold, the mysteries of God shall 
be unfolded unto you, and then shall 
you be made rich; behold he that hath 
eternal life is rich." 

The riches of eternal life we ought to 
seek, not the riches of the world. There 
is a raging thirst for riches in this 
land. The love of money is growing, 
even in our midst. We do not look up- 
on wealth in itself as a curse. We be- 
lieve that those who can handle means 
rightly can do much to bless their fel- 
lows. But he who is ruled by the love 
of money is tempted to commit sin. 
The love of money is the root of all 
evil. There is hardly a commandment 
but is violated through this seeking for 
riches. I think, therefore, that it is time- 
ly advice to our people to guard against 
the growing tendency to speculation, 
and making investments when they 
have not the means wherewith to do 
it. It is not safe. We have prosper- 
ous times at present. We hope they 
may continue. But it would be very 
unwise to build upon the future, and 
not stand on a firm foundation in re- 
gard to financial matters. If any one 
wants to make investments, let him 
make them with his own means; not 
be too hopeful and borrow means be- 
yond his ability to pay. If he makes 
investment with his own means and 
fails, he can still be an honest man; 
but if he borrow money of his neighbor 
that he is not able to pay, he may cause 
the financial ruin of his benefactor who 
trusted him. Now, brethren and sisters, 
let us not let the spirit of speculation 
take hold of us; for past experience 
shows that inflation is followed by de- 
pression, and many of those who are 
thought to be rich and prosperous, 
when such times come, may not be able 
to meet their honest debts. I would 
advise our people to guard against this 
thirst for riches, this wanting to get 
rich quickly. The old way of earning 
by our labor is the best way to be- 
come rich. It is true, we see some who 
engage in mining quickly realize for- 
tunes; but we do not think of the hun- 
dreds and thousands who do not sue-

ceed. We And some that invest in .cer- 
tain enterprises that pay well, and we 
think that any enterprise which is 
started will do as well. This, we can 
certainly say, will not be, the case. 
There are always some enterprises that 
are really needed and may pay their 
projectors, but in the common run of 
business great returns cannot be ex- 
pected. So let us stay on solid ground, 
and not venture too far out. The love 
of money is very marked in the world. 
The question is not, how much good 
will such an enterprise do? but will it 
pay? Now, even in business that should 
not always be the predominant motive. 
Many enterprises that have been start- 
ed in our midst, and that have done a 
great deal of good, have not paid great 
dividends to the shareholders. Our Pro- 
vo Woolen factory has been a great 
, blessing to the State; yet the owners 
have not realized great benefit from the 
investment. When it was first built, 
money was scarce in the state, and we 
used to turn our produce there and make 
exchange for woollen goods. Then we 
valued the institution perhaps more 
than we do now. I am glad to see that 
that institution is getting on a paying- 
basis. We could mention several others 
that have been projected by our lead- 
ers that have not brought great finan- 
cial returns to the owners. The ques- 
tion, how much good can we do with 
our means? should be before the ques- 
tion, how can we double our means? 
The Lord says, seek not for riches, but 
for wisdom. Let that be our seeking." 
"Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and 
His righteousness, and all other things 
shall be added unto you," is the prom- 
ise. He that hath eternal life is rich, 
indeed, says the Lord. Let us seek for 
eternal life, and while we live here 
make our lives as useful as possible, 
and do what we can for the upbuilding 
of the kingdom of God upon the earth. 
God bless you all. Amen. 

ELDER GEORGE REYNOLDS. 
Need of manual training in schools— Incidental 
reference to athletics — New methods of 
teaching in Sunday Schools. 

It *was with more than ordinary in- 
terest and pleasure, my brethren and 
sisters, that I listened to the remarks 
of President Smith yesterday morning, 



perhaps for the reason that I felt for 
some time the great necessity of in- 
structions being given on many of the 
points on which he touched. One thing 
particularly impressed me, and that 
was the necessity of more encourage- 
ment being given to the teaching of 
manual training in our schools. I well 
remember when President Brigham 
Young established our Church schools, 
how strong was his wish that these 
things should be encouraged and this 
department taught in the institutions 
of which he then laid the foundation; 
and I have always regretted that more 
attention has not been given to this de- 
partment in these schools. We all know 
what a very practical man President 
Young was; how essential he felt it was 
that we as a people should be self-sus- 
taining. In his day our territory was 
full of the best of mechanics, who had 
gathered from various portions of the 
earth. It -was well known that in no 
part of the United States were there 
better handicraftsmen, and artisans 
than in Utah. The work done in those 
times still stands as a monument of 
how well they could accomplish their 
purposes. But today, unfortunately, it 
is not altogether so. Our rising genera- 
tion, born in the midst of these valleys, 
apparently does not turn naturally in 
this direction. Although we have in- 
creased in numbers, we have not devel- 
oped in these conditions; in fact, nve are 
not so well off as we were a quarter of 
a century ago or more. One remedy for 
this evil is that those who direct the 
feelings and thoughts of this people 
should impress upon the youth the ne- 
cessity of learning trades, by which the 
community can be built up, and not so 
many turn in the direction of what are 
called the learned professions. We can- 
not have a prosperous community if it 
is overweighted and top-heavy with so 
many inclined in one direction, and the 
arts and industries which lie at the 
foundation of all progressive and suc- 
cessful communities are neglected or 
trifled with. Therefore, feeling the ne- 
cessity of our people being impressed 
with these truths, I was exceedingly 
pleased to hear our President talk as 
he did yesterday morning. I will ac- 
knowledge that I have felt that some of 
our institutions of learning paid more 



26 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



attention to athletics— to basketball and 
such games— and thought more of the 
credit they received by overcoming 
their competitors in that line, than they 
did of training the young men placed in 
their care in those things that will 
make them most useful. Of course, we 
are told that athletics are nec- 
essary. I admit that. But 
the argument appears to me to 
be essentially weak when applied 
to ball games and games of a like des- 
cription, when we recollect that those 
engaged in them are the strongest, the 
healthiest and the best developed stu- 
dents in the institution, and that those 
who are not so well developed, and who 
need the training to strengthen them, if 
any do, are the ones that stand around, 
applaud, clap their hands and yell 
themselves hoarse when their represen- 
tatives play a good game, or secure a 
victory. I believe, my brethren and 
sisters, that in developing the muscles 
and the vitality of our people a little 
change from athletics to manual train- 
ing will be a great advantage to this 
-community. 

As a number of the presiuents of 
stakes have reported their stakes, I 
wish to say a few words with regard 
to our Sunday schools, as I am one of 
the assistants to President Joseph F. 
Smith in the general superintendency. 
I wish to report that as a general thing 
the schools are progressing satisfactor- 
ily. During the past year we have 
made a marked change in our methods 
and in the conduct of our schools by 
introducing a uniform plan of study in 
all the schools, so that any pupil going 
from one school to another can continue 
in the new school the sam£ series of 
lessons that he studied .in the school 
which he has just left. There has 
been a complaint that in our Sunday 
schools some of the children have re- 
ceived a one-sided education, having 
studied but from one or two of our 
sacred books during the whole time 
they have been in school. Some have 
been confined to the Bible, others to the 
Book of Mormon, others to Church his 
tory, others to the Articles of Faith. 
This has not been intentional, but it 
has been for the want of a detailed, 
progressive outline of, study. This the 
•General Board has endeavored to ob- 
viate by the "Outlines" which have 



lately been published. At this time 
any child who continues in the Sunday 
school through the entire course will 
have had every phase of religious, his- 
tory and doctrine desirable to be 
learned presented to him by the time 
he has passed through the various de- 
partments. He will commence with the 
kindergarten, where he will be taught 
in the story form; then up through the 
primary, the intermediates and the the- 
ological, until he will become acquaint- 
ed with the history of the Church, with 
the doctrines of the Gospel, with the 
Bible, the Book of Mormon, the Doc- 
trine and Covenants, the Pearl of Great 
Price, and their contents. While no 
book, sacred though it be, is made the 
especial object of study, that which is 
taught in all the departments is intend- 
ed to increase the faith of the child in 
the Gospel of the Son of God and in 
love for Him. When the pupil has 
passed through all the departments he 
will go out with a well-rounded under- 
standing of the dealings of the Lord 
with His people in this and in past dis- 
pensations. This has been our object 
in preparing the "Outlines;" and 
though occasionally we hear a word of 
fault found that we are adhering too 
closely to the mere historical record, 
yet I wish to say, as one of the repre- 
sentatives of the Sunday schools, that 
that is not our intention. Our intention 
is, first, and before all other things, to 
implant in the hearts of the children 
a love for God and for Hie holy cause, 
a reverence for all sacred things, and 
to develop within them a testimony of 
the truth of the great work of the lat- 
ter days. I would exhort the teachers 
in this great cause to remember that 
all other considerations are secondary. 
While we give the historical portion a 
prominent place, yet that is simply in- 
tended to lead the mind and feelings of 
the child in the direction of the great 
truths that God has revealed, and we 
desire to make all teaching subservient 
to this end and intent. 

I cannot this morning give you any 
figures with regard to the increase of 
our schools, or of our attendance, be- 
cause we have lacked some of the sta- 
tistical- reports. And this teaches us 
a lesson of how dependent the whole 
people are upon individual effort. If 
the lack of one report causes the whole

report of the Church or of the schools 
to be incomplete, inaccurate and unre- 
liable, it shows how necessary it is that 
those who have the clerical work of the 
Church to do, whether in the wards and 
stakes or in the auxiliary organiza- 
tions, should be correct and prompt; for 
statistics of any kind, if not exact and 
truthful, are worse than worthless, be- 
cause they are misleading, and they 
give wrong ideas regarding existing 
conditions and what is being done. But 
I find— as I have much to do with 
these things in my daily duties— that 
the reports which are sent in, both by 
-the school officers and the stake offi- 
cers, often come in a most undesirable 
condition. "We receive reports occasion- 
ally that are unsigned, undated, and 
unnamed, and we have to guess whence 
they come from the little information 
that is recorded. Think of a report 
without any signature, without any 
date, without any name, and you can 
see how difficult it is to make up gen- 
eral reports. Then they are occasion- 
ally sent -in just a day or two before 
the general report is required, when 
they ought to be in at least a month 
before, and two months would be bet- 
ter, so that they could be properly tab - 
ulated, examined, and the results un- 
derstood. 

Altogether, as far as the Sunday 
schools are concerned, we feel that we 
have great cause for encouragement, 
and with succeeding years they are do- 
ing more and more good in the estab- 
lishment of righteousness and dn the 
confirming of the faith of God's people. 

God bless you. Amen.

ELDER R. G. MILLER. 
(President of Emery Stake.) 

"While sitting here I was reminded 
of what President J. Golden Kimball 
said at one of our conferences. He 
yaid: "You brethren around here want 
tc look out; lightning is going to strike, 
and you can't tell just where." 1 feel 
like it had struck this morning. In 
standing before this vast congregation 
I feel very weak; but I trust I may be 
able to speak for a few minutes and re- 
port the Emery Stake, over which I 
nave been called to preside. It pleases 
me very much to hear the brethren tell 



of their stakes. It is a testimony to 
me that we are being blessed in the 
Emery Stake of Zion; for a similar re- 
port to those given might be made of 
the Emery stake. It lies about south- 
east from here, and east of the Sanpete 
s + ake. It is comprised of two counties- 
Carbon and Emery — and is about 70 
miles east and west and 90 miles north 
and south. We have 13 wards, and 
they are scattered over this large area 
of country. We have some disadvant- 
ages compared with other stakes. As 
a consequence, we are probably not 
making the progress that we should. 
But the people generally are trying to 
do their duty and to serve God, though 
there is considerable room for improve- 
ment. We have all the modern con- 
veniences of civilized (?) society; we 
have saloons, and organizations of most 
every kind. I am, however, happy to 
say that very few of our people have 
joined the organizations outside of the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints. The saloons, with perhaps two 
exceptions, are run by people not of our 
faith; and in a short time we hope to 
bp able to say that no one runs a sa- 
loon in our stake who claims to be a 
member of the Church. If the Bishops 
will do their duty, there will be no 
saloons run by our people. 

There are great resources in our part 
of the country, and only about one cor- 
ner of it has yet been touched. Prom 
the name of one of our counties — Car- 
bon — you will see that we have coal 
there. The statistics of the state show 
that we have more coal in that region 
than there is in any other part of the 
west. We hope that this will be de- 
veloped, and that the world may be 
supplied from the abundance of coal 
to be found there. There is coal all 
along the north boundary of our stake, 
and on the west also. It is full of coal, 
and we hope the day is not far 
distant when it will be produced and 
marketed. We have a fine agricultur- 
al district also. There is a movement 
now on foot whereby many thousands 
of acres will be brought under culti- 
vation; and we invite the Saints who 
are looking for homes to cast their eyes 
on Emery stake. The people of Juab 
and Sanpete counties have had a move- 
ment on foot for some time to store

water in the mountains and convey it. 
into their counties; but they have seen 
a more feasible way to get rid of this 
water, and they have kindly consented 
to come into Carbon county. We ask 
you brethren and . sisters who are look- 
ing for homes to join with us, and we 
will welcome you there. 

1 feel well in the position to whie v ' 
I have been called. I desire to do my 
duty. My great desire is to press for- 
ward and assist the people and help 
build up the kingdom of God. I have 
been blessed with good companions. My 
counselors are sturdy, thrifty men — 
John H. Pace and Henry G. Mathis. We 
work together in unity. I know thi- 
wwrk is true. It is the work of God. I 
have known this from my infancy. It 
seems as if I was born with a testimony 
of the Gospel. My parents were among 
the early settlers of this country, and 
went through all the hardships and 
privations; and it seems to have been 
implanted in my nature that this is 
the work of God. 

I pray that the blessings of the Lord 
may continue with us during this con- 
ference, that we may go home filled 
with the Spirit of the Lord and more 
determined to serve Him and keep His 
commandments; which I do in the name 
of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER W. C. PARKINSON 
(President of Hyrum Stake). 

I have truly rejoiced, my brethren 
and sisters, in the timely and practical 
instructions that have been given at 
this conference. I have enjoyed the 
spirit that has rested upon those who 
have spoken to us. In reporting the 
Hyrum Stake of Zion I will say, it is 
a newly-organized stake. It was or- 
ganized two years ago on the 30th of 
April. It comprises the south end of 
Cache valley, with ten wards and about 
5,700 Saints. I believe the spiritual 
condition of the people there has im- 
proved of late. I think it was an ex- 
cellent thing to divide the old stake, 
make it smaller, and place more active 
men in the field to look after the people 
and to encourage them in the work of 
the Lord. "We have divided one of the 
wards In our stake, and we believe it 
is an excellent thing. It has brought 



about good results. We now have three 
wards where we had one, and three 
Bishops and three sets of officers where 
we only had one. We find that the 
people are better looked after, and 
spiritual activity is growing. We have 
better attendance at our meetings. The 
presidency of the stake are united; and 
have a good deal of pleasure in their 
labors. We have an excellent High 
Council, and I think I am safe in say- 
ing that evejry member of that body is 
a good, faithful, consistent Latter-day 
Saint. They are good tithepayers.they 
observe the Sabbath day, they observe 
the Word of Wisdom, and they are ac- 
tive in the ministry. We meet to- 
gether once a month, and we always 
have a splendid attendance. Usually 
nearly all the members are present, 
both regular members and alternates. 
The presidency are supposed to meet 
once a week. We do not always do 
this, but we do it as often as we can 
find it convenient and practicable. In 
our meetings we have a great deal of 
pleasure, and, I believe, have enjoyed 
the Spirit of the Lord. We take under 
consideration matters pertaining to the 
general interest and welfare of our peo- 
ple. Our wards are close together. We 
only cover a small area of country — 
about ten miles to our farthest ward; 
so that our stake is very compact, and. 
I think, a model stake. We have some 
splendid people in that part of the 
country — perhaps as good as can be 
found in Israel; and we have enough 
of the other element to keep those who 
are willing to work busily engaged. 
There is plenty of opportunity for them 
to labor in the ministry. We only have 
two saloons in our midst — and that is 
two more than we would like to have. 
Our tithing has increased between $5,- 

000 and $6,000 the last year. Our Priest- 
hood meetings are very well attended. 
We have ten very good, active Bishops. 

1 can say for all our Bishops that they 
are good, intelligent men, who thor- 
oughly understand the Gospel and the 
duties of their calling. They are quali- 
fied and able to look after their wards, 
and I believe they are giving the people 
good attention. Our stake officers, as 
far as I have learned, are all good, 
faithful people, and our organizations 
are all complete. Although it is a 



ELDER THOMAS E. BASSETT.

■new stake, we have the organizations 
all complete, both in the wards and in 
the stake. There is a meeting of the 
Priesthood every month, and all stake 
officers have their regular monthly 
meetings, at which they devise means 
and plans for the best interest and 
welfare of the various organizations. 
While we are located in one of the most 
fertile- and prosperous valleys in the 
Rocky Mountains, still we always have 
the poor with us. "We have plenty to 
consume the fast offerings and the 
funds placed at the disposal of the 
Bishops, though the people are increas- 
ing in the payment of their fast offer- 
ings, and we hope some time in the 
near future that we will be able to take 
good care of all the poor in our part 
of the Lord's vineyard without calling 
upon the Church for assistance. We 
are working to that end. 

I do not know that I have anything 
further to say, more than that I rejoice 
in the principles of the Gospel. I have 
a testimony of the divine mission of the 
Prophet Joseph Smith and the great 
work of the latter days. I have had 
this testimony for many years. I can 
hardly remember the time when I did 
not look upon the Apostles of the Lord 
Jesus Christ and the men who stood 
in prominent Dositions in this Church 
with the greatest degree of reverence. 
I have looked upon those who have pre- 
sided over me all the days of my life 
with perhaps as much consideration 
almost as I have my own parents. I 
have learned to love the servants of 
God, and I am glad to be associated 
with them. I am glad to attend these 
conferences, and I always rejoice in 
listening to the instructions that are 
imparted. The last conference that 
we held in the Hyrum Stake of Zion, I 
believe, was the best we have had. It 
was more liberally attended than any 
previous conference. Our house was so 
full that we had to have an overflow 
me cting, and the Spirit of the Lord was 
poured out upon us in abundance. We 
felt that the Lord had kindly recog- 
nized our efforts, and made us to re- 
joice. Although the roads were ex- 
ceedingly bad, the people turned out 
in great numbers, and we had a spir- 
itual feast. 



May the Lord bless us, brethren and 
sisters, and preserve us in the truth. 
T ask it in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER THOMAS E. BASSETT. 
(President of Fremont Stake.) 

I am very gratified, my beloved 
brethren and sisters, for the position 
that I now occupy in standing before 
you as a representative of the Fremont 
Stake of Zion. Our Stake is located 
about two hundred miles north of this 
city. It is in the extreme northeast 
corner of what is usually termedSouth- 
eastern Idaho. It also extends across 
the continental divide into the south- 
ern borders of Montana, the branch of 
Lima in that State of the Union being 
a part of the Fremont stake. In the 
state of Idaho there are eighteen wards 
located in the Fremont stake. The area 
of our stake is approximately 70 miles 
square, embracing in the neighborhood 
of 5,000 square miles. We have a popu- 
lation of about 6,000 Latter-day Saints. 
All of the organizations of our stake are 
complete. Like the rest of my breth- 
ren who have reported, I feel proud to 
be associated with those who have 
charge of the various organizations in 
our stake. I am especially pleased to 
be associated with my two counselors, 
whom I have learned to love as men of 
God, and who are heart and hand with 
me in every enterprise that we esteem 
for the good and welfare of our people. 
I do not think that there is a better 
High Council throughout the length and 
breadth of the Church than we have in 
the Fremont stake of Zion. We hold 
meetings regularly once a month, and 
have a splendid attendance. There is no 
proposition ever brought before our 
people until the entire High Council are 
apprised of it and are unanimous in fa- 
vor of it. We have two councils of Sev- 
enty, whose jurisdiction extends 
throughout our stake and one of the ad- 
joining stakes. They are doing a very 
good work. We have four Elders' 
quorums, actively engaged in their la- 
bors. The superintendency of the Sun- 
day schools of the stake are most ac- 
tive men, and the Union Board asso- 
ciated with them are exemplary mem- 
bers of the Church. They meet regular-

ly bi-weekly, and arrange for their la- 
bors among- the various Sunday schools 
of the stake. So does also the stake 
board of the Young Men's Mutual Im- 
provement Associations, and the Stake 
board of the Young Ladies' Mutual Im- 
provement Association, meet bi-weekly, 
and I can testify that they are men and 
women of God and doing a noble work 
among our young people in that vicin- 
ity. "We have not met with the success 
in our religion class work that I would 
like to see; but we hope to bring that 
institution to the front as soon as we 
possibly can. With this exception, all 
the auxiliary organizations and the 
quorums of that stake are in excellent 
condition. 

Financially we are more blessed and 
prospered than we have ever been be- 
fore, although we have no need what- 
ever to complain of the blessings of our 
Heavenly Father that have attended 
us in that section of the country. It 
seems but yesterday that we settled on 
that then sagebrush plain, and located 
our tents on the banks of the South Te- 
ton river, under the direction of Presi- 
dent Thomas E. Ricks, who was then 
Bishop Ricks, and he was under the 
jurisdiction of Presiding Bishop Wil- 
liam B. Preston, who was then the 
President of the Cache stake of Zion. 
All that extent of country which now 
comprises the Fremont stake, the Bing- 
ham stake, the Teton stake, and a part 
of the Pocatello stake, was then known 
as the Bannock ward of the Cache 
stake of Zion. The number of Latter- 
day Saints in that locality at that time 
did not exceed perhaps 200 souls. To- 
day in these various stakes our people 
number approximately 20,000. 

What was then the Bannock ward of 
the Cache stake of Zion is now known 
as the Ricks Academy district, named 
in honor of our late highly esteemed 
and lamented president, Thomas E. 
Ricks. I am pleased to say that this 
institution of learning was organized 
by him under the direction of 
President Wilford Woodruff, fif- 
teen years ago on the 12th 
of November next. From that time un- 
to the present, although it has had 
many difficulties to encounter, it has 
lived and increased its usefulness 



among our young people. This year we 
have an attendance in that institution 
of 265; and I can tell you, brethren and 
sisters, I feel extremely proud of them, 
and of the noble work they are doing, 
with the faculty of the institution, un- 
der the able leadership of Brother Ezra 
Christianson. The work that they have 
been doing this winter is indeed excel- 
lent. In this institution there have teen 
40 young men, called from these differ- 
ent stakes, to take the missionary course, 
and this spring nearly all of them have 
been called to take missions to various 
parts of the earth. These young men 
are scattered abroad today, others are 
going, and the benefits of this institu- 
tion are so widespread that We cannot 
estimate the length and breadth there- 
of. On the 15th of November next— the 
fifteenth birthday of this institution — 
we expect to have completed a $50,000- 
structure as a home for it. This year 
Fremont stake has contributed upwards 
of $12,000 for the erection of this build- 
ing, and by doing a similar work during 
the coming season we hope to have it 
ready for occupancy on the 12th of No- 
vember. 

As far as the tithes of our people are 
concerned, we feel that we have no 
complaints whatever to offer. In con- 
nection with what we have done to- 
wards the erection of the academy, our 
tithes have increased nearly $4,000 dur- 
ing the year 1902. 

I bear my testimony to you, as I have 
borne it time and time again, that this 
is the Church and kingdom of God in 
which •we are engaged. Notwithstand- 
ing all of the opposition that has been 
brought to bear against it during the 
73 years of its existence, look at it to- 
day, scattered throughout the length 
and breadth of these mountain valleys, 
our young men in almost every nation 
under heaven promulgating the truths 
of the Gospel, and who is there that 
cannot say with me this morning that 
were it not for the overruling power 
of Omnipotence this work would have 
gone down; but today we find it is the 
work of God, and the people are grow, 
ing and increasing upon the right 
hand and upon the left. We have in 
our stake, as some of the other brethren 
have said, all of the modern improve- 
ments (?). Twenty years ago it was a

sagebrush plain; today we have up- 
wards of 50 wards in that part of the 
country, we have a branch railroad, we 
have the electric lines, we have tele- 
phone communication, and everything 
is prosperous with us, financially and 
temporally. I feel to thank God for It; 
but above all things I thank Him for a 
standing in the Church of God. I bear 
my testimony to you of its truthfulness. 
Above all things, let us be true to the 
covenants that we have made, and not 
one of us be a traitor. I am extremely 
thankful for the very timely sugges- 
tions that have been offered by our 
Presidency during this conference with 
regard to the importance of teaching 
our young people the necessity of man- 
ual work. I omitted to state that in our 
institution of learning which I have 
been speaking of we have made prepar- 
ations already to have a class in man- 
ual training the coming winter, as also 
a class in domestic science. "We are 
scattered over a very large tract of 
country, and I only regret that there 
are not more of our young people who 
* are looking for homes, that they may 
come and help us carry our burdens. 
We have had bridges to build, school- 
houses to build, churches to build, roads 
to maintain, and everything that is nec- 
essary in the development of a new 
country. Our people have taken up 
large farms; they are too large, and in 
too many cases they have been under 
the necessity of mortgaging them, and 
I am sorry to say that more than 50 per 
cent of the farms in our stake today are 
mortgaged. Our people are carrying 
too heavy a load, and we would very 
dearly like to see a host of our young 
people come into that country and buy 
out one-half or two-thirds of the farms 
we own, and help us to lift our mort- 
gages and maintain those things that 
are necessary in the colonization of a 
country. "We invite you there; but we 
do not want to go contrary to the 
counsel of the First Presidency in ask- 
ing our young people to scatter out too 
far. However, we will always welcome 
you to come and share our burdens, be- 
cause we want to observe the counsel 
of the First Presidency and get out of 
debt as soon as we can. "We do not 
•want, though, to sell our farms to 
strangers, but we would like to sell to 
our own people. 



God bless you, brethren and sisters. 
May His Spirit attend this people 
throughout the length and breadth of 
the world. I ask it in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen.

—Friends in the world— Relating to Seven-

The few moments I occupy I very 
much desire to enjoy the Spirit of the 
Lord. I realize that the ways of the 
Lord are not in harmony altogether 
with the ways of men. I have labored 
in the ministry long enough to know 
that should I be favored to enjoy the 
Holy Spirit and speak the things that 
the Lord shall give unto me; they will 
not be altogether in harmony with peo- 
ple who do not enjoy that spirit. I 
believe it is proper for us to be conser- 
vative and consistent in all that we say 
and do; but I confess to you that my 
time is too short on this occasion to 
prepare your minds for what I may 
say, for I have not an entire conception 
of just how I am going to come out in 
fifteen minutes from now. 

I have thought some little lately 
about the Bible, which we claim to be 
the word of God, "as far as it is trans- 
lated correctly." Taking that state- 
ment into consideration, there are no 
people on the earth that quibble so lit- 
tle about the Bible as do the Latter-day 
Saints. I am strongly Impressed with 
the idea that the Bible cannot be un- 
derstood only by the same spirit with 
which it was written. If that state- 
ment be true, I am impressed with the 
idea that the Christian world have not 
got very much of it, or else they would 
understand it more alike. There are 
said to be six hundred or more denom- 
inations. I have never exactly found out 
how many. I have heard Elders talk 
about it, but I never had an exact 
statement. And I believe what was ex- 
pressed in an editorial in the Deseret 
News — we would like to know which 
one of them is the Christian church, for 
we are in some doubt. 

Now, we have the Book of Mormon; 
and if there is anything on earth that 
has made trouble for this people it is 
that book. It is largely the means of

GENERAL, CONFERENCE. 



costing the lives of the Prophet Joseph 
Smith, his brother Hyrum.and hundreds 
of others belonging to this Church. 
But I am prepared to testify that it 
contains the word of God. We have 
also the Book of Doctrine and Cove- 
nants and the Pearl of Great Price, 
which are accepted by this people as 
the revelations of God; and they have 
made an endless lot of trouble for this 
people, because they are the word of 
God. There is only "one of a city and 
two of a family" that are willing to 
accept them; so you need not think I 
am going to get discouraged because 
they do not believe all I say, and you 
need not think I am going to stop talk- 
ing, if permission be given me, because 
some people do not believe all I say. 

Brethren and sisters, I believe I will 
tell you how to popularize the "Mor- 
mon" Church. If you want to be pop- 
ular, I can tell you how to be so. The 
"Josephite" church has started out in 
about the right line to accomplish their 
purpose, by cutting out a number of 
truths that Joseph Smith revealed to 
the Saints, and in this way they are 
trying to popularize themselves. Now, 
if you will stop sending out these four- 
teen hundred Elders, testifying that 
Jesus is the Christ, that Joseph Smith 
is a prophet of God, that we have apos- 
tles and prophets inspired of God, that 
we enjoy revelation, that the signs fol- 
low the believer, that the sick are heal- 
ed by the laying on of hands, that we 
have divine authority from God, then 
you will be popular. Are your prepared 
to do it? If you will stop going into 
these temples and receiving your en- 
dowments and being married for time 
and all eternity, that will help -a little. 
After awhile, it seems to me, if I have 
the right spirit, they will refuse to al- 
low us to hold offices if we go into these 
temples and receive our endowments 
from the Lord. And while they have 
not rejected us yet, I am rather im- 
pressed that they will reject us; for the 
Christian world have already done it, 
and I do not know but what this nation 
will. I do not know but I will be glad 
when it comes. If the Lord cannot take 
care of His Church and His people and 
look after their interests, then we have 
been mistaken. I tell you we have 



friends and we have men in the world 
who have the Spirit of God, 
who will rise up and protect this people. 
I am not numbered among those who 
think that we have no friends, for we 
have friends; but, brethren and sisters, 
you are not of the world, and therefore 
the world hateth you, speaking general- 
ly. If you want to be popular, stop do- 
ing the things that I have mentioned, 
and deny their truth. But if you want 
to stay with this Church, be true to 
your covenants. The time will come 
when you will be — as you are now — a 
light set upon a hill. I tell you, all the 
devils in hell cannot destroy this 
Church. And the devil never has been 
entirely comfortable since that temple 
(the Salt Lake Temple) was completed. 

I would like to call your attention to 
another subject: I happen to have a 
little information on paper this morn- 
ing, which is rather unusual for me. I 
desire to call your attention to some of 
the labors of the First Council of the 
Seventy. Listening to all these presi- 
dents of stakes, you would think that 
their stakes were the only stakes in 
Zion; and I rather approve of that 
style. I believe that you ought to love 
that which is your own. I am learning 
that slowly. If you have got anything 
that is not presentable, for heaven'a 
sake do not say anything about it; they 
will find it out soon enough. We have 
been laboring among these Seventies 
for four years — ever since the presiden- 
cy of the Church notified us that we 
had a number of Seventies on that book 
containing the non-tithepayers of the 
Church. We received reports from these 
Seventies for two years, 1899 and 1900. 
Now we have a report here, which is a 
good deal like the reports Brother Rey- 
nolds was talking about — not entirely 
true, because twenty quorums have 
failed to send their report in. I feel so 
annoyed, I can hardly express myself. 
I have been working with the presi- 
dents of those quorums for four months 
to get their reports. I will say here 
that we have some Seventies, amongst 
those quorums that are just about as 
near dead as they ever will be in 
the world. They are walking 
around, but they are dead. From top 
to bottom they are dead spiritually. 
We have 143 quorums. Number not re- 



ELDER J. G. 

ported, 20. We have between 8,000 and 
10,000 Seventies; we are not quite clear 
as to the actual number. There are 14 
quorums that have no non-tithepayers. 
Number of Seventies who do not pay 
tithing because of neglect and careless- 
ness, 238. Number that do not pay tith- 
ing because of sickness and physical 
ailments, 28. Number on account of 
debt, 12. Some of these men get in debt, 
and a few of them have told me that 
the Lord is so merciful and their cred- 
itors are so hard on them that they will 
pay them first. Number on account of 
poverty, 77. Number on account of un- 
belief in tithing, 28. Missionaries that 
have just returned and are heavily in 
debt, and make that as their excuse, 
15. There are 7 that are disgruntled— 
that is, they do not like their Bishops, 
or they have locked horns with the 
Presidency of the Stake, or else they 
have not been treated right when they 
went to pay their tithing. There are 9 
that do not like the manner of disburs- 
ing the tithing. These make a total of 
412. Including the 20 quorums that have 
not reported, we perhaps have about 
500 non-tithepayers out of 9,000 Seven- 
ties. 

The First Council of the Seventy have 
been looking after the Seventies during 
the last year for missionaries. We 
took up the matter under the direction 
of the First Presidency. We have had 
suggested from the different quorums 
of the Church 497 missionaries, and we 
have been laboring with those men ever 
since — that is, writing letters of inquiry 
regarding their moral, their spiritual, 
their physical, their financial and their 
educational condition; and after send- 
ing out these letters, I want to say to 
some of the Presidents of Stakes, you 
need not be exercised— we did not get 
all the 497. There is nothing that has 
been done by the First Council, under 
the direction of the Presidency, for 
years that has done as much good as 
our inquiring after these brethren. I 
wish we had the time to enquire after 
every one of the Seventies, and thos? 
that are nearly dead, it would doubt- 
less start their blood to circulating, and 
teach these Seventies the fact that they 
are witnesses of the Lord Jesus Christ

to the nations of the earth, and it is 
their privilege to preach the Gospel con- 
tinually, and that they ought to be out 
of debt and prepared to go. Out of the 
497 the number reported to the mission- 
ary committee of the Apostles was 163. 
The number excused, on account of fin- 
ancial and physical condition, 138. Num- 
ber who have not answered letters of 
inquiry yet, 60; but some of these let- 
ters have only just been sent out, and 
they will answer them. Number noti- 
fied to report to the First Council in 
one year, 131. The 131 were in debt, 
nearly all of them, and we gave them 
a year to get out of debt. They are 
now on the anxious bench for a whole 
year, and at the end of the year, with 
the blessings of the Lord and a desire 
on their part to go forth as witnesses, 
God will be with them; but if they do 
not get free, all they have to do is to 
report it, and they will be excused, no 
doubt. Number who declined to go, 5. 
Out of 497 only 5 declined; and I be- 
lieve if we had fully understood their 
letters and had started the Presidents 
to labor with them, there would not be 
found probably more than one out of 
the whole number who would decline to 
go. I tell you, it is a remarkable thing. 
The Christian church cannot show any- 
thing like it. 

I have not time to talk much about 
missionary work. In a few words, I 
want to say that I am strongly impress- 
ed that we are spending too much mon- 
ey in this labor. I learned from the 
Deseret News last night — which cor- 
roborates largely what I have believed 
— that they have seventy missionaries 
out of Davis stake, and it cost them 
$15,000 a year. If that statement be 
true, that every Elder spends at least 
$200 a. year on an average, and we have 
1,400 Elders out preaching the Gospel 
to the nations of the earth, it costs this 
people $280,000 every year in cash. All 
I have to say, brethren, if you 
cannot g'o On missions; you are too rich 
to go, or you have too much business, 
or you have positions in the Church 
that prevent you from going; then, for 
heaven's sake, help those who do go; 
The Church must be protected in its 
business, in its wards, its stakes and 
its Church schools. I believe in pro-

tection — if I am among the number pro- 
tected; but inasmuch as I am not, I 
tell you who are, in the name of Israel's 
God, if this Gospel must be preached, 
and we must spend $280,000 to preach it, 
you men that stay home must help car- 
ry the burden, and not have our breth- 
ren mortgage their homes and sell out 
everything to do this work. There are 
not two rich Seventies in the whole 
number we have reported to the mis- 
sionary committee of the Apostles. 
They are all poor men, and some of 
their letters would bring tears to your 
eyes, when they write to us explaining 
the little they have, but they say "I am 
ready to go; I know God Almighty will 
bless us." I will rob you of a little 
time for the purpose of reading you 
what the Lord told my father, and I 
take it as a testimony to me that there 
is nothing that brings a greater bless- 
ing than preaching the Gospel to the na- 
tions of the earth. 

Far "West, April 6, 1839. 

"A word from the Spirit of the Lord 
to my servant, Heber C. Kimball. 

"Trouble not thyself about thy fam- 
ily; for they are in my hands. I will 
feed them, and clothe them, and make 
unto them friends. They never shall 
want for food, nor raiment, houses nor 
lands, fathers nor mothers, brothers 
nor sisters, and peace shall rest upon 
them forever, if thou wilt be faithful 
and go forth and preach my Gospel to 
the nations of the earth." 

I stand before you as a living witness 
of its truth. I have traveled among 
this people for eleven years. I have re- 
ceived honors and blessings from 
among this people, because of my fa- 
ther. I have found fathers and moth- 
ers, brothers and sisters. I have found 
friends everywhere I have been among 
this people. And I attribute the great- 
er part of it to the fact that my father 
fulfilled that commandment. His chil- 
dren have never wanted for bread, and 
I tell you, in the name of Israel's God, 
they never will. They will be mighty 
poor, but they will always have bread. 
God bless you. Amen.

"Rouse all ye mortals, the dawn Is

OVERFLOW MEETING. 

Held in the Assembly Hall, April 5, 
2 p. m. 

Elder A. O. Woodruff presided. He 
was assisted by Elders Rudger Claw- 
son and Hyrum M. Smith, also of the 
Twelve. 

The choir and congregation sang the 
hymn beginning: 

An angel from on high, 
The lonsr, long silence hrr 

Prayer was offered by Elder Rudger 
Clawson. 
The choir sang: 

A holy angel from on high, 
The joyful message has made known. 

I 

ELDER BEN. E. RICH, 

President of the Middle States mis- 
sion, was the first speaker. He said: 

I sincerely trust that the Spirit of 
the Lord will be with us this after- 
noon, and that it will rest upon those 
who may speak as well as those who 
listen. If we are here to learn more 
concerning our duties to our God, it Is 
as necessary for the congregation to 
have the Spirit of the Lord as it is for 
those who address the congregation. It 
is not enough that those who speak to 
us shall do so under the influence of 
that Spirit, but we should listen and 
strive to understand the ripirit prompt- 
ing the utterances made. 

I rejoice that we have the privilege o£ 
coming together and listening to the 
words of counsel and inspiration that 
fall from the lips of the authorities of 
the Church. While we are here in con- 
ference assembled our brothers and 
sisters scattered througflout the differ- 
ent nations of the earth are assisting 
us with their faith and prayers, and 
they are praying for their deliverance 
from the land of Babylon; they are 
prayinsr that the time may come, and 
that speedily, 'when they will have the 
privilege of coming to Zion to worship 
the Lord. I have listened to the pray- 
ers of the faithful Saints in far off 
Europe and in the missionary fields of 
America, and I know that it is not 
necessary for the Elders .to preach the 
principle of the gathering to those who 



ELDER BEN E. RICH. 



35 



render obedience to the principles of the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ. When they 
have faith in the Lord Jesus and repent 
of their sins, and are baptized for the 
remission of the same, and receive the 
seal of the Spirit through the laying on 
of hands, the spirit of gathering rests 
upon them, and they are anxious to 
gather to Zion, where they can learn 
more of the ways of the Lord. It has 
been predicted that in the last days the 
mountain of the Lord's house would be 
established in the tops of the moun- 
tains, and that people rrom many na- 
tions would be heard to say: "Come, 
and let us go up to the mountain of 
the Lord, and to the house of the God 
of Jacob; and he will teach us of his 
ways, and we will walk in his paths." 
This is being literally fulfilled by the 
Latter-day Saints in the valleys of 
these mountains. People from all na- 
tions under heaven — all civilized na- 
tions—are praying that they might 
come up to this house of the Lord, 
where they may learn more of the ways 
of the Lord; for they want to walk in 
the path that will bring them near to 
God. Many, however, on emigrating to 
Zion are disappointed, and when they 
behold the acts of some people, they 
feel that this is a different Zion to the 
one they have seen in their dreams — 
to the Zion they have prayed for. 

The Latter-day Saints should under- 
stand that they all hold a portion of the 
Presthood of God. All male members of 
the Church hold a portion of the Prest- 
hood of God, or have the privilege of 
holding it, from their earlier years to 
the grave. We are expected to honor 
that Priesthood. When we come to 
Zion it is required of us that we shall 
aid in making it Zion in very deed, that 
we shall assist in purifying and cleans- 
ing it from 'everything that is displeas- 
ing in the sight of God, making it such 
a place as would be expected that the 
Lord would select for the gathering 
place of His people from the nations of 
the earth. 

Our faith is not a myth; it is a real- 
ity. God has come to the earth in the 
age in which we live, and His only be- 
gotten Son, Jesus Christ of Nazareth, 
came with Him, and They opened up 
this work in which we are engaged. 



They gave to us the Prophet Joseph 
Smith; They gave to us the ones who 
have succeeded the Prophet Joseph 
in the Presidency of this Church; They 
gave to us the Apostles and the Priest- 
hood, and They have also given us to 
understand that while They have 
granted us our free agency, we 
are to be brought back into 
their presence. Then the books 
will be opened, and we will discover 
that we have been talking, aye, and 
thinking, into such a phonograph as 
has recorded our words, acts and 
thoughts in the Lamb's book of life. 
When that book is opened we will be 
held accountable for every idle word 
•we have spoken; and the Lord is going 
to reward us, or He is going to con- 
demn us, for that which we have done. 
We will be rewarded for our faithful- 
ness, and we will be held accountable 
for the way and manner in which we 
have used the authority that He has 
given us to act in His name; this we 
know. We also understand that where 
much is given much will be required. 
We claim more than is claimed by any 
other religious body on the earth. We 
claim that the windows of heaven have 
been opened to us; that God has visited 
the earth in person; that Jesus is our 
Elder Brother; that unto us is given the 
privilege, honor and authority to speak 
in the name of our Father in heaven. As 
I said, we claim more than is claimed 
by any other people on the face of the 
earth, but I want to tell you, my breth- 
ren and sisters, that more will be re- 
quired of us than of any other people, 
and that we will be judged according 
to the light that we have received. We 
have received more light than any other 
people on the earth; »we have received 
the Gospel of Jesus Christ in its fulness 
and power. To us has been given the 
knowledge that the Gospel is not only 
for the living but also for the dead. 
While we send missionaries through- 
out the world to preach to the living the 
prinicples of repentance and baptism 
for the remission of sin, we also have 
our brothers and sisters laboring in the 
same cause for the redemption of the 
dead, knowing as we do that the Priest- 
hood of God does not pertain to this 
earth alone, but that it also pertains to 
the spirit world, where mission fields 



36 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



have been opened and are being oper- 
ated. People on the other side of the 
veil also hear the glad tidings of the 
Gospel of salvation; we know that the 
living can do the work for the dead. We 
also know that the dead without the 
living cannot be made perfect, nor the 
living without the dead. Not one neces- 
sary principle connected with the Gos- 
pel of life and salvation, either for the 
living or for the dead, has been with- 
held from us, but we have been made 
the custodians of this knowledge. We 
are the light that God has placed on 
the earth, and He has commanded us 
not to set it under a bushel, but to set 
it on a mountain, where it can be seen 
from afar. 

We are commanded to go into the 
darkness of the world and spread the 
light of the Gospel, and to lift up our 
voices and cry, "Repent ye, for the 
kingdom of heaven is at hand." Let us 
remember that we all shoulder a por- 
tion of this responsibility, that we have 
a portion of this Priesthood, and that 
we are expected to magnify the same. 
Let us remember that two Priesthoods 
have been given us — the Aaronic and 
the Melchisedek Priesthood. Those who 
have been ordained Elders hold 
the Melchisedek Priesthood, and also 
the Aaronic Priesthood. They have 
just as much Priesthood as any man in 
the Church. They have just as much 
Priesthood as the Presidency of the 
Church, or the Apostles; for there are 
but two Priesthoods, as I have said, 
and an Elder holds them both. How- 
ever, there are different offices in these 
Pristhoods. In the Melchisedek Priest- 
hood men are set apart to labor as El- 
ders, others as Seventies, and still oth- 
ers as Apostles— special witnesses of 
the Lord Jesus Christ in all the world; 
but there is only one Melchisedek 
Priesthood. Those who hold the Priest- 
hood had better magnify their callings, 
for the day will surely come 
when the dead, great and 
small, will stand before the 
judgment seat of God, and then, as I 
have said, where much was given, much 
will be required. May God bless you 
Amen. 



ELDER HUGH S. GOWANS, 
(President of the Tooele Stake.) 

My brethren and sisters, to attend the 
general conferences of our Church has 
always been a feast to me, and this one 
is no exception to the rule. I pray that 
the same spirit that has characterized 
the remarks of the brethren who have 
already spoken during this Conference 
will continue with us; that the people 
may be fed with the bread of life and 
that we may rejoice together. 

I feel pleased to have the privilege 
of representing the Tooele Stake of Zion. 
This stake joins the County of Salt 
Lake on the west. It is large in area, 
comprising the entire county, "which ex- 
tends 50 miles north and south and 1?5 
miles east and west. Although our 
stake is large in area, the population 
is small, it is probably one of the small- 
est stakes in Zion, the population being 
a little over 3,000 souls. There are nine 
wards, located in a radius of 
about 50 miles. A few of our peo- 
ple live on the extreme west of 
the stake, bordering on the Neva- 
da line, where a small Sunday school 
has recently been organized. The pres- 
idency of the Tooele stake and the High 
Council labor in unison. Quite a num- 
ber of the High Councilors have been 
members of the High Council ever since 
the stake was organized, in 1877, and 
they are laboring for the best interests 
of the people. Although the stake is 
small In population, we have the same 
organizations that they have in other 
stakes— Relief societies, Sunday schools, 
etc. So far as our population is con- 
cerned, we have not increased very 
much. We have been very limited in 
our resources, and are today, so far as 
our water supply is concerned. Our 
population has been limited on this ac- 
count. We are not able to get the 
young people to settle in our midst and 
make homes; however, a few have tak- 
en up dry farms and have been success- 
ful to some extent, although last year 
was quite a failure. Since 1882 our pop- 
ulation has only increased 159 souls. 
Our resources have been limited, and 
we have been swarming, like bees, and 
the people have scattered, going to oth- 



ELDER L. W. SHURTLIFF. 



37 



er places to which they have been invit- 
ed to go to establish homes. A great 
portion of what is known today as Cas- 
sia county was built up by people from 
Tooele county. During the past season 
as many as twenty persons left Grants- 
ville. They were obliged to leave on 
account of our limited water supply. 
The only remedy we can find for this, 
though we have not established it yet, 
is the piping of our water from the 
mountain streams to reservoirs to be 
stored and used during the dry season. 
That is the only way that I know of 
that we can increase our population. 

I feel pleased to report that we have 
established a Sunday school at the Mer- 
cur mining camp (sometimes referred 
to as the Johannesburg of America), 
according to a suggestion of Brother 
George Reynolds, of the general super- 
intendency of the Sunday schools of 
the Church. "We have a nice ward 
there, but it is composed mostly of 
transients. We are kept busy re-or- 
ganizing the various organizations of 
the ward, on account of the transient 
nature of the people. At one time this 
ward numbered BOO persons. We have 
been able to establish successfully re- 
ligion classes in all the wards of the 
stake but three, one of these being 
Mercur. Our people are so engaged 
there that it has not been possible to 
get anybody to take hold of the matter, 
and the teachers of the district schools 
are not of our faith. The people of 
the Vernon ward, in the extreme south 
of the stake, are so scattered that, dur- 
ing the winter months, it has been im- 
possible to retain the children after 
school hours to attend- the religion 
class. 

All the organizations and institutions 
of our stake are in a good and healthy 
condition, I believe. I feel to rejoice in 
this, and in the amount of faith exer- 
cised by the people. The subject of 
tithing has been referred to by some of 
our brethren who have represented 
their stakes, and they have reported a 
wonderful increase, amounting to thou- 
sands of dollars. In the year 1882 the 
tithing of the Tooele stake was about 
$9,000. Since that time it has doubled 
itself, though our population is about 
the same. I take that as an indication 
' of an increase of faith on the part of 



the people. The tithing paid last year 
amounted nearly to $19,000, and the pop- 
ulation is but 3,000. As I remarked, I 
take this as an indication of an increase 
of faith on the part of the people, be- 
cause it is the oldest members of the 
stake who pay this tithing, the young 
people having moved to Canada and 
other places to find homes. 

I feel to rejoice in making this report, 
though it is probably not as complete 
as I would like to make it, as we have 
not time to go into details this after- 
noon. 

I hope that we will be able to remain 
faithful and to appreciate the blessings 
and privileges that we enjoy, associat- 
ed, as we are, with the living oracles of 
God, who have been placed in the midst 
of the people to guide and direct them. 
I hope that we will be able to enjoy the 
same feeling expressed by Abraham 
Lincoln during the time of the civil 
war. A friend was talking with him 
regarding the condition of the country, 
and so on, and made the remark, "I 
hope that the Lord is on our side." 
'Well," said President Lincoln, "I do 
not worry about that at all; I know 
that the Lord is always on the side of 
right. What worries me most is to 
know if we are on the Lord's side." I 
hope, my brethren and sisters that we 
will worry over this until we have a 
testimony of the truth, and an assur- 
ance that we are on the Lord's side. 
Amen. 

L. W. SHURTLIFF, 
(President of the Weber Stake of Zion.) 

My brethren and sisters, it is a pleas- 
ure to have this privilege of standing 
before you here today to make such re- 
port as I may be led by the Spirit to 
give, concerning the Weber Stake of 
Zion, over which I have the honor to 
preside. It is one of the oldest stakes 
in Zion. Although the area of our stake 
is small, the population is large, num- 
bering over 13,000 souls. I believe we 
are all laboring in harmony. So far 
as the tithing is concerned, we have 
made a large increase during the past 
year; in fact, the tithing has been in- 
creasing for several years. I rejoice to 
say that the people of the Weber Stake 
are a good people.

GENERAL, CONFERENCE. 



Regarding the opening remarks of 
President Smith at this Conference, ad- 
vising the Latter-day Saints not to neg- 
lect the useful professions, I will say, 
that although we are located in the cen- 
tral part of the state and have quite a 
large city, yet nearly all our people are 
farmers and fruitgrowers, and a great 
many of them are employed in 
sugar and canning factories, which 
have been erected by the Latter-day 
Saints. I believe there is none in the 
Weber Stake of Zion who cannot obtain 
lucrative employment along the lines 
referred to, without being obliged to 
enter into the professions. 

I rejoice in meeting with the people 
of God in conference, in hearing the 
testimonies of our brethren, and in lis- 
tening to the voice of God's servants, 
proclaiming the truths of heaven and 
pointing out our duties. It has been my 
good fortune, as I deem it, to be asso- 
ciated with the Church all my life. I 
have had the privilege of being person- 
ally acquainted with all of the Presi- 
dents of the Church, Prophets of God, 
since the days of Brigham Young, and 
have taken a small part in the labors 
pertaining to the Priesthood from that 
day until the present. I feel that those 
who lead the Church today have the 
same power and authority to guide us 
as did the first President of the Church. 
I thank the Lord that we have such 
men to lead us— the. sons of those great 
men who led Israel in the past, and 
who introduced the work of God in the 
earth. 

I do not feel that I should prolong my 
remarks. I know this to be the work of 
God. I have had this testimony from 
my youth up, and I have had the priv- 
ilege of bearing the same not only in 
my own land, but also in foreign lands; 
for I realize, as has been said here to- 
day, that we •will be held accountable 
for our acts, either of a public or of a 
private character. I thank the Lord 
that there is a Judge who will judge 
us — perhaps more carefully, and ac- 
cording to our deserts, than we judge 
one another. I pray God to bless us, 
and to fill us with a love for the truth, 
that we may never turn traitors to the 
principles of the Gospel or the servants 
of God. Amen. 



ELDER DAVID JOHN, 
(President of the Utah Stake.) 

I am pleased to make a few remarks, 
and they must be very few-, as a good 
many others have to speak. 

I am pleased to say that the Church 
in the Utah Stake of Zion is in a 
healthy, thriving condition. Of course, 
our stake is one of the oldest, being or- 
ganized soon after the settlement of the 
people in that county. They divided our 
stake about 27 months ago, organizing 
two other stakes — Alpine and Nebo — 
leaving us between nine and ten thou- 
sand souls. Previous to the division we 
had between twenty-four and fwenty- 
five thousand souls in the stake. We are 
trying our best to keep up with the 
times. The people are paying their 
tithing. Some 2,500 Saints in our stake 
are paying a full tithing. There are 
others who pay only a partial tithing, 
480 who should be tithe-payers pay no 
tithing at all. This is quite a draw- 
back to them, and it is also a draw- 
back to the Church. We are laboring 
with these people and are trying to get 
them to assist the kingdom. We want 
to labor with all of them; for we do 
not want to be rash in handling them 
for their fellowship. It is far better to 
labor with them, to seek to enlighten 
them, and to draw them to us, and to 
get the Spirit of God in their hearts. 

I labored a long time in the Utah 
stake with the late President A. O. 
Smoot. I was with him over 18 years, 
assisting in the presidency of the stake. 
Then I assisted President Partridge five 
and a half years. Since the death of 
Brother Partridge I have had charge of 
the stake, in connection with my coun- 
selors. We labor in harmony and with 
love for one another. Our High 
Council and our quorums are 
in good working condition. Our 
Bishops and their counselors 
are men of God, alive to 
their callings. Our home missionaries 
and all our organizations are doing ex- 
cellent work. We have been striving, 
of late, to infuse new life into the 
quorums of the Deacons, Teachers and 
Priests. We feel that we have neglect- 
ed these quorums more than we should 
in our stake. We want to bring the 
boys to the front, those who belong to'

the quorums of the Lesser Priesthood, 
and have them do the work pertaining 
to their callings. In doing this, they 
will grow and develop and become 
members of the Church in very deed. 

I have a testimony of Jesus Christ in 
my heart, and light from heaven to 
comfort my heart and to cheer me in 
my labors. To me serving God is a 
pleasure. I have endeavored to do this 
all my life, and to devote my life and 
all that I have to God's service. I 
pray God to bless us all and to enable 
us to obey the Priesthood, to pay our 
tithes and offerings and attend to our 
duties, and to build an altar of prayer 
in our own homes. May God enable us 
to do this, is my prayer, in the name 
of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER FRANK J. BRAMWELL, 
President of the Union Stake of Zion. 

It affords me very great pleasure, my 
brethren and sisters, to represent the 
Union Stake of Zion, one of the young- 
est stakes in the Church. I believe it 
was organized nineteen months ago to- 
day. We were very few in number at 
that time, and were located almost en- 
tirely in the Grand Ronde Valley, In 
Oregon. Since our organization our 
number has increased exceedingly. I 
am reliably Informed that the increase 
of the Union stake exceeded that of any 
other stake in the Church during the 
year 1902. To be exact, our number in- 
creased 1,030 during the past year. We 
have ten organized wards and one 
branch. All the organizations of the 
stake are complete, as are also the ward 
organizations, with the exception of 
two. 

The Union Stake of Zion was organ- 
ized, you might say, in the midst of 
the world, and there are great oppor- 
tunities for missionary work — and es- 
pecially by the good .example of the 
Saints living there. The people of Ore- 
gon, I am pleased to report, are very 
broad-minded, as a rule. We meet 
with practically no opposition. We are 
invited into the business circle. We are 
invited to take part in committees in 
the local government. Only a few days 
ago I was sent for by the business men 
of the city of LeGrand, which has a 
population of upwards of 5,000, and I 



was informed by that body of gentle- 
men that they had decided to put a 
ticket into the field that should be 
known as a business ticket, and that 
they wanted a "Mormon" to head that 
ticket. I considered this a very great 
compliment to the few of us located in 
that vicinity. 

We have an exceptionally rich valley. 
The soil is exceedingly rich, and with 
the cultivation that will be given it, I 
trust, by the Latter-Day Saints already 
there and those who may join us, it will 
produce enormous crops, and our peo- 
ple, I trust, will become wealthy. 

The spirit of unity prevails there. I 
know of no unhealthy condition in any 
of our stake or ward organizations. I 
think I am also safe in saying that 
there are fewer drones, at least in one 
or two of our wards, than it has been 
my lot to observe in any other stake. I 
do not say this boastingly, but with 
thanksgiving to the Lord. 

Our borders extend to the state of 
Idaho. We have two wards in that 
state which are increasing with rapid- 
ity. A few weeks ago I was in the 
office of the chief executive of the state 
of Idaho, and was speaking of the col- 
onization of the western portion of that 
state by the Mormon people. I assured 
the governor that it was our intention 
to multiply and replenish the earth, to 
reclaim the desert, to do as much good 
as possible, and to assist in the civil 
government all we could. He gave ex- 
pression to an observation that he had 
made, which will perhaps be of interest 
to you. He said, "Mr. Bramwell, th§ 
Mormon people compose about one- 
third of the population of this state. 
There are in the penitentiary today 
about 125 persons, nine of whom are, or 
call themselves, Mormons." There are 
in the insane asylum of this state nine- 
ty or one hundred persons, only six of 
whom are furnished by the Latter-day 
Saint populace. Such figures as these 
are very encouraging. It seems to me 
that to those who do not like "Mor- 
mons" or "Mormonism," in their sober 
moments of reflection, this would ap- 
peal at once and bear witness that 
some good, at least, can come from 
what they term "Mormonism." I con-, 
sider it a very favorable showing and 
a great compliment to the Church of 



40 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Christ in the earth. I remarked to the 
governor that if those nine individuals 
who found themselves behind the bars 
in the penitentiary had listened to the 
teachings of the authorities of the 
Church, there would have been nine less 
in that institution at the present 
time. After all, these favorable con- 
ditions are not to be wondered at, be- 
cause it is claimed by 'the people, and 
rightly too, that we are led of the 
Lord. I have claimed, and do always 
claim, that anybody can follow, but 
that it takes a great deal of intelli- 
gence and wisdom to lead. As Presi- 
dent Rich has suggested, the Lord has 
been true to his promises. He has 
gathered His people from the nations of 
the earth and has established them here 
in the tops of the mountains. He has 
said that He would gather us from 
every nation and that He would teach 
us of His ways, that we might walk in 
His paths. If we are the best people 
on the face of the earth, it is because 
we have been taught of the Lord. 

I rejoice in the spread of the Gos- 
pel. I rejoice in the privilege that I 
have of being a witness of the Lord 
Jesus, that I am able to testify to the 
restoration of His Gospel, and that I 
know it is the power of God unto sal- 
vation to all those who accept it. I 
have been greatly privileged, for which 
I am exceedingly thankful. I am 
thankful that the Lord has blessed our 
efforts in the Union Stake of Zion. I 
think it has the nicest name that any 
stake in Zion could have. As I tell our 
people, we expect a great deal of them 
because as long as they are at home 
they cannot get away from Union. The 
great and last prayer of the Lord was 
that union might prevail, and we have 
got it in Oregon, at least in name. I 
trust that the fruits we bear will prove 
that we are worthy of the name. I 
know that "Mormonism" is true, that 
the Lord has revealed Himself in the 
earth, and that the power of God is in 
the earth for the salvation of the hu- 
man family. Let us be faithful; let us 
live according to the light that the Lord 
has given to us, following our file lead- 
ers. We sometimes sing the hymn, "We 
. thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet, to 
guide us in these latter days;" but, un- 
fortunately for us, individually at least. 



when we are told tg do a certain thing, 
in some instances we fail. If we are 
thankful to the Lord for a Prophet to 
guide us, let us listen to his words, 
else how can he guide us? God bless 
us, and may He bless His children in 
all the world, is my prayer, in the name 
of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER DON C. DRIGGS, 
(President of the Teton Stake.) 

My brethren and sisters, I am proud 
to stand before you this afternoon to 
represent the youngest stake of Zion 
that has been organized, being the fif- 
tieth, I believe. We are located in the 
eastern part of Idaho, joining the great 
national park, our boundaries taking 
in the Jackson Hole country as well as 
the Teton valley. It has been about 15 
years since our people first began to 
settle in that country. I was one of the 
first. The scene that greeted our eyes 
at that time was very fascinating in- 
deed, in looking into the Teton valley. 
It was then uninhabited, with the ex- 
ception of a few trappers and frontiers- 
men, I think about 30 in number. To 
look upon that beautiful valley and see 
the miles and miles of fine land thread- 
ed by silvery streams of water, one was 
led to exclaim, "How in the world has a 
country like this lain so long unoccu- 
pied?" But as we. view it now and see 
it occupied largely by our people, we 
cannot help but think that it was re- 
served as a gathering-place for the 
Saints. In fact, the Apostles who 
visited us in those early days told us 
that it would be a home for many 
thousands of the Saints of God, that the 
land would be fruitful, that the ele- 
ments would be tempered, and that we 
would be able to produce all that was 
necessary for our sustenance. These 
promises have been truly verified, for 
we are not only producing that which 
is necessary to sustain us, but we are 
exporting a great deal in the way of 
grain, potatoes, timothy seed, etc. Of 
course we do not raise everything, but 
we are able to produce that which is 
necessary to sustain us. Our stake was 
organized about one and one-half years 
ago, by President Joseph F. Smith. 
We rejoice very much that we have 
this organization and to receive the

blessings that we derive from our var- 
ious organizations in the stake. They 
bring into active labor a large num- 
ber of people, and we see the benefits 
and are enjoying the blessings that 
come to us in this resnect. 

Some of the brethren here have men- 
tioned something about the products of 
the soil. I might mention the fact that 
in the Jackson's Hole country we have, 
I presume, the greatest game country in 
the United States. Most of the elks 
from the national park are wintering 
there. I suppose that about 20,000 elks 
have wintered in the Jackson's Hole 
country during the past winter. I was 
going to say that many thousands of 
them had died of starvation, but I be- 
lieve it would be more correct to say 
many hundreds. There has been a 
great loss among these animals on ac- 
count of the early thaw that 
came in the winter resulting 
in the crusting of the snow, 
which prevented the animals from 
getting their feed. The loss was mainly 
among the calves. The settlers have 
encroached upon the winter feeding 
grounds of the elks. The elks have re- 
sented this by breaking into the hay- 
stacks, and they have become a men- 
ace to the people in that region, espec- 
ially during the past winter. 

I rejoice in the instructions that we 
have received during this conference.. 
I have been particularly pleased in lis- 
tening to the reports of the presidents 
of stakes. I am glad to be able to take 
advantage of their experience, having 
learned what they are doing and how 
they are working in their stakes. I 
hope to profit by their experience, and 
also by the counsel and advice that 
has been given to us by the brethren. 
I do not feel that it would be proper for 
me to occupy more of your time. I 
want to remember the advice given in 
the manual of the Y. M. M. I. A. To 
practice stopping at the right time and 
in the right place. I pray that the Lord 
will bless us, and bless Zion, that we 
may all rejoice in the Gospel and the 
blessings that are vouchsafed to us, 
through obedience to the command- - 
ments of God.which is my prayer. 
Amen. 



Sisters Maggie S. Hull and Maria B. 
Winder favored the congregation with 
a duet. 

ELDER JOHN M. BAXTER. 
(President of the Woodruff Stake.) 

I take pleasure, my brethren and sis- 
ters, in representing the Woodruff 
stake of Zion. The Woodruff stake was 
organized about five years ago. It com- 
prises the south half of Rich county, 
Utah, and the southern half of Uintah 
county, Wyoming, also taking in the 
Lucern valley in Uintah county, Utah. 
We have fifteen wards and branches in 
the Woodruff Stake. It covers a large 
area of country. Our stake extends 
east and west 125 miles, and about the 
same distance north and south. The 
mining and agricultural districts are 
divided about equally. That portion ot 
the stake in Wyoming is composed 
principally of mining districts, and the 
Latter-day Saints are greatly in the- 
minority; while that portion of the 
stake in Utah and in the Ft. Bridger 
country, Wyoming, is composed mainly 
of farming districts, and the people are 
mostly Latter-day Saints. We have 
erected five meetinghouses since the or- 
ganization of the stake, all of which 
have been completed and paid for. We 
now have a meetinghouse in course of 
construction at Randolph, which will 
cost upwards of $15,000. It has not been 
finished yet. 

We suffered a great loss two years 
ago, after the organization of our stake, 
when so many of our people were called 
to colonize the Big Horn country, in- 
cluding President Sessions, my first 
counselor, and a number of other per- 
sons holding prominent positions in the 
Woodruff Stake. The Big Horn Stake 
was organized two years ago; previous 
to that time it belonged to the Wood- 
ruff stake of Zion: We met with an- 
other great loss in the Woodruff stake, 
through the closing of the mines at 
Aimy, Wyoming, which caused the 
breaking up of the ward at that place. 
Alma was the largest ward in the 
Woodruff stake at the time of its or- 
ganization. When the mines closed 
down, the people scattered throughout 



42 



GENERAL, CONFERENCE. 



the states of Wyoming- and Utah. I am 
pleased to say, however, that the tithes 
of the people have not diminished on 
account of this loss. We are paying 
more tithing at present than we were 
when the Alma ward was in a flourish- 
ing condition and when the Big Horn 
country was still included in our stake. 
So, we are increasing 1 in number and 
good works. That barren country 
known as the Ft. Bridger country, over 
which so many of our fathers and 
mothers traveled in coming to these 
valleys, which was then, and up to a 
few years ago, a barren desert, now has 
many beautiful farms and homes. W e 
now have a thriving people there. They 
have erected a large meetinghouse, and 
it is equipped with all the modern im- 
provements. 

We are getting along very 
nicely with our neighbors in Wyo- 
ming, although, in many of the towns 
in which our people are located we are 
greatly in the minority, yet we are ac- 
corded all the rights and privileges that 
others enjoy. We find the people of 
Wyoming to be a broad-minded, gen- 
erous and large-hearted people. They 
are willing to accord to the Latter-day 
Saints all the rights and privileges that 
are given to other people, and we are 
tnjoying the friendship and fellowship 
of the people of that state. We love 
them, and love to associate with them. 
I am happy to say that some of the 
congressmen of Wyoming have had the 
courage to defend our people in the 
halls of Congress. 

All the organizations of the Woodruff 
Stake of Zion are complete. I have, 
indeed, been blessed with good counsel- 
ors — men of wisdom, men of experi- 
ence, who have been a support to me. 
We also have a good High Council, 
which is a help to the Woodruff stake. 
We also have good Bishops and good 
people in that stake of Zion. 

There is one thing that was brought 
to my mind this morning, while one of 
the brethren was speaking about the 
young people's moving away from his 
stake. We find that a great many 
young men and young ladies from Utah 
go to the mining camps of our stake, 
in search of employment. There are 
many temptations surrounding the 
young people in those places, which are 



not to be found in our agricultural dis- 
tricts in Utah and other places. So far 
as saloons are concerned, I believe we 
can boast of more saloons in the 
Woodruff stake than in any other stake 
in the Church. Every mining town in 
the stake has from 10 to 15 saloons, and 
I almost believe the people drink more 
beer than water; but it is not our peo- 
ple, as a rule. Our people who live 
there are nearly all temperate. Some 
of them visit the saloons, I am sorry 
to say. Some of the young people who 
go to the mining towns from our agri- 
cultural districts in Utah and other 
places, after getting married, being 
surrounded by these influences and no 
longer under the watchcare of their par- 
ents and the Priesthood— some of them 
partake of these influences and fail to 
attend to the duties that devolve upon 
them as Latter-day Saints. 

I will say in conclusion, that I have 
a testimony to bear of the truth of this 
Gospel. I know that it is true. I was 
born and reared in this Church, being 
born in Salt Lake City. I have had evi- 
dence, all my life, of the divinity of the 
work in which we are engaged. I know 
that this Gospel is a perfect law of 
liberty. I was freeborn, and I have 
been free ever since I was born. I have 
taken a great deal of comfort and 
pleasure in seeking the counsel and ad- 
vice of those who were placed over me, 
and I want to testify to you, that I 
have profited in every instance by doing 
so. I know that those who are placed 
in the Church to lead us are men of 
God; they are men of experience; they 
are men of wisdom, and above all, they 
are inspired of God. It will be profita- 
ble to us as Latter-day Saints not only 
to take the advice that they may give 
us from time to time, but to seek for 
their counsel and advice continually. 
May God bless us and help us to do 
this, is my prayer, in the name of Jesus. 
Amen. 

ELDER EPHRAIM H. NYE, 

(President of the Southern States Mis- 
sion.) 

My brethren and sisters, I regard 
myself as being highly honored this day 
to stand before you for a few moments 
as the representative of the Southern 
States mission. 



ELDER EPHRAIM H. NYE. 



43 



I will say, in brief, that the Southern 
States mission was cut down to its 
present proportions last June. It now 
constitutes the states of Mississippi, 
Alabama. Georgia, Florida and North 
and South Carolina. There are about 
100 Elders laboring there — good, earn- 
est, faithful, hardworking men — your 
brothers, your sons, your fathers, but 
not many of your fathers. We would 
like to have more of the fathers. We 
have some faithful Saints in the South- 
ern States mission. We also have some 
.good friends, strong and influential. We 
are concentrating our efforts in the 
cities, and are meeting with good suc- 
cess. We have the promise of protec- 
tion by the mayors and chiefs of police, 
and in most of the cities in which we 
are laboring-, some 19 or 20, we have 
the privilege of preaching on the 
streets. It is true that we have some 
enemies. 

It has fallen to my lot to be much 
among the children of men preaching 
the Gospel, and I have noted one thing 
to which I wish to call your attention, 
by way of camparison, between the God 
we worship and the God worshiped in 
the Christian world, and their form of 
worship. I have visited a good many 
churches and have listened to their 
sermons. One of the things that strikes 
me most forcibly is that they are al- 
ways talking of a "merciful God," 
pleading His "wonderful mercies," 
teaching His "mercies," calling for His 
"mercies." We seldom if ever hear them 
talk about anything else, but 'the long- 
suffering and mercies of God." I want to 
ask you: Do you often hear the Latter- 
day Saints talk about the mercies of 
God? Have you heard a single word 
thus far during this confernce, from 
the servants of the living God, concern- 
ing His mercies? No; and why? Be- 
cause the Lord has given us something 1 
better. Not only is the God of heaven, 
whom the Latter-day Saints worship, a 
merciful God, but He is something else. 
I want to speak of that something else 
in the view that I take of 
it. He is a God of justice; fur- 
thermore, He is a most munificent 
giver of great and wonderful gifts. I 
call your attention to some of those 
gifts: He gave us a Prophet, in- the 
person of Joseph Smith, to reveal to us 
His mind and will; He has continued 



to give us a Prophet to lead and guide 
us, even to this day. This is certain- 
ly a great and wonderful gift. It might 
well be said among the children of men 
in the Christian world, "O for a Proph- 
et of the Living God," providing they 
could only comprehend the great bless- 
ing it would be to them. Not only has 
He given us a Prophet, but Prophets, 
and further, Apostles; men after his 
own heart, men of God, filled with the 
Spirit of God, Prophets of the Mcst 
High, to guide and direct us. Are these 
mercies? No; they are grand and 
wonderful gifts, gifts such as the world" 
knows nothing of. We are not yet 
obliged to plead for mercy. Next, we 
come down to such men as we have 
been listening- to during the sessions of 
this conference — Presidents of Stakes. 
They are grand gifts, as are also their 
counselors and the Bishops, and all the 
directing officers in the ministry, at 
home. They are grand gifts whom God 
has given us to guide us through the 
dark ways of life, to lead us out of 
darkness into the glorious light of eter- 
nal truth. These are not mercies, they 
are gifts, such as we do not always ap- 
preciate, perhaps. Perhaps we do not 
always comprehend how great these 
gifts are; perhaps we do not always re- 
vere or treat those men as we should 
in their lot and calling. Then we have 
the various ramifications in the Holy 
Priesthood, which Priesthood is also a 
wonderful gift, as are the blessings 
that we derive through its administra- 
tions. 

I also desire to refer to His favors, 
because He is a God of favors. It Is 
a favor to be called to the Priesthood 
as a Teacher, and to be required to la- 
bor in that capacity under the direction 
of any Bishop. It is an especial favor 
granted to every man who is called to 
an office in the Holy Priesthood, and to 
have that Priesthood bestowed upon 
him. It is a favor from the Lord to be 
called and sent forth to preach the Gos- 
pel in foreign lands, or wherever it may. 
It is a special blessing that God has 
given them; and if they will accept it 
as a favor and feel grateful to the 
Lord for the same, going forth and 
magnifying their calling, they will reap 
great and grand blessings, beyond their 
present powers to fully comprehend. 
God bless you. Amen.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



ELDER JOSEPH E. ROBINSON, 
(President of the California Mission.) 

When I hear the reports of the El- 
ders of Zion, indicating how she has 
prospered, how her borders have length- 
ened and been strengthened, I feel like 
exclaiming as did Balaam of old when 
he beheld the multitude of the children 
of Israel: "How goodly are thy tents, 
O Jacob, and thy tabernacles, O Israel!" 
To know that the wilderness has blos- 
somed as the rose, that the desert has 
become as the garden of the Lord, and 
that joy, peace, thanksgiving and mel- 
ody are found therein; is not 
this blessed? Should we not be grate- 
ful? I tell you, my brethren and 
sisters, we who have been away from 
you for some time, who have met with 
the sinister spirit of the world, are 
made to rejoice, and our souls are filled 
with joy. Our spirits are refreshed, 
and we are built up again in our faith 
upon hearing the testimonies of our 
brethren, and again looking into your 
faces and feeling the grasp of the hands 
of our brethren and sisters. 

The California mission comprises the 
states of Nevada and California and 
the western part of Oregon. The lat- 
ter, however, has been added to the 
mission since my presence in Zion, 
making the mission over 1,700 miles in 
length. In California, particularly, 
we have but a few Saints. "We can on- 
ly make converts fast enough to replace 
those who come to Zion, in spite of 
the fact that we do not preach to them 
to gather. "We would rather have them 
stay with us to strengthen the branches 
in that land; but, as President Rich 
has said, the spirit of gathering comes 
upon them when they have taken upon 
them the name of th e Lord Jesus 
Christ. He has said that He would 
gather them from the east and from 
the west, that He would say to the 
north, give up, and to the south keep 
not back; bring my sons from afar and 
my daughters from the ends of the 
earth, even so many as have taken upon 
them my name. 

The Californians, as the people of the 
west, are not a religious people. Our 
converts are made largely among the 
foreigners, and among people who have 
gone there from the eastern states. A 



few native Californians have come into 
the Church, whose fathers and mothers 
drifted away from the Church in early 
days, when this place was, as it now is, 
as a threshing floor, and the unfilled 
grains of wheat are blown away. Some 
of the sons and daughters have had 
the faith with them, and have heard 
the shepherd's voice and have come 
into the fold. 

Our efforts during the winter were 
largely hampered on account of sick- 
ness. Many of the Elders have had 
typhoid fever, or smallpox; but, thanks 
to God, in His mercy He has preserved 
us, and most all of the members of 
the Church as well as our Elders now 
have health and strength.and our pros- 
pects are again bright, and our souls 
have been made glad by a few coming 
into the fold. ■ 

We were recently strengthened and 
encouraged by a visit of some 300 
Utahns, including 80 or 90 mem- 
bers of the Tabernacle choir. With 
them, we had the privilege of meeting 
with about such a congregation as we 
have here today, in the Alhambra thea- 
ter, San Francisco, two weeks ago to- 
night. Not many people get to hear 
of us this way, and the influence of our 
visitors does not extend as far as we 
would like. It is but as a drop in a 
bucket for fifteen or eighteen hundred 
persons in a city of 400,000 to hear the 
testimonies of the Elders. But we are 
bearing testimony daily on the streets 
and are distributing thousands of 
tracts, leaving the responsibility of a 
testimony of the restored Gospel of the 
Lord Jesus Christ on thousands of peo- 
ple. In addition to doing this, we are 
making men of the boys who have gone 
into the field. They are receiving tes- 
timonies of the truth, and are contrast- 
ing and comparing the completeness of 
our Gospel with the man-made systems 
of the day, and noting how unsatisfac- 
tory the sectarian gospel is to those 
who have espoused it, who do not know 
the truthfulness of the saying of St. 
Paul, that "the Gospel of the Lord 
Jesus Christ is the power of God unto 
salvation." They make money their 
god, and pleasure its counterpart, not 
knowing the peace and joy that comes 
to those who are rich in a knowledge 
of heavenly things. I think the cause 



4 

ELDER RULON S. WELLS. 



45 



of the disregard for religion by the peo- 
ple of th»* te is largely their pleas- 
ant environments and the wealth of that 
land. Next to this is the individual- 
ism of the people, who interpret the 
Scriptures for themselves and care not 
for authorit-- for prophets or revela- 
tion. 

God bless you, my brethren and sis- 
ters; may peace be in your homes; 
may you cleave fast to the covenants 
you have made, and be true to your- 
selves, to your brethren and to your 
God, is my prayer, in the name of Jesus. 
Amen. 

The choir sang the anthem: 

,^,„ tmm "O. How Amiable." 

Benediction was pronounced by Elder

SUNDAY AFTERNOON. 

Sunday, 2 p. m. 

The choir sang the anthem, 

"In Our Redeemer's Name." 

The opening prayer was offered by 
Elder John Nicholson. 
The choir sang the anthem: 

"God of Israel, Hear our Prayers." 

RULON S. WELLS. 

The Bible and Book of Mormon— Both true — 
Latter fresh from pen of Prophet — Word of the 
Lord today Is "get out of debt" — Seventies 
willing to go on missions — Many hindered by 
debt. 

My brethren and sisters, I sincerely 
hope that I may be sustained by your 
faith and prayers. As one of the presi- 
dents of stakes was coming upon the 
stand this afternoon, after having been 
invited by President Smith, he stopped 
and shook hands with myself and 
Brother McMurrin, and asked that we 
pray for him. In standing before you 
hero I feel like shaking hands with the 
Latter-day Saints and asking them to 
pray for me, because I believe that the 
prayers of the Saints are heard by our 
Heavenly Father, when they are of- 
fered up in faith. 

Brother Kimball made reference this 
morning to the Bible, and I am remind- 
ed of an article of our faith, which 



says that we believe the Bible to be 
the word of God, as far as it is trans- 
lated correctly. We also believe the 
Book of Mormon to be the word of God. 
While he was quoting this article of 
our belief, the thought came into my 
mind, how often has it been quoted in 
the mission field, and how frequently 
have our enemies and those who have 
not accepted our faith criticised us in 
making reference to the Bible and 
qualifying it by saying that we believe 
it as far as it is translated correctly. 
"O yes," say they, "you Latter-day 
Saints believe the Bible when it is con- 
venient for you to accept of it, but 
when it is not convenient, then you fall 
back upon the provision which says "as 
far as it is translated correctly." In 
giving this article of faith the Prophet 
Joseph Smith was inspired by our 
Heavenly Father. Suppose for a mo- 
ment that he had left out that condi- 
tion. The question would at once arise, 
Which Bible do you Latter-day Saints 
believe in? Do you believe in the King 
James translation of the Bible, or do 
you believe in the revised edition? Do 
you accept the Catholic Bible, or the 
one that was translated by Martin 
Luther in the German language? There 
are a great many different editions of 
the holy scriptures; which of these Bi- 
bles do you believe in? because in many 
particulars the translations are at vari- 
ance, and do not always agree. There 
was inspiration in the putting in of 
that condition. We believe the Bible 
to be the word of God, as far as it is 
translated correctly; and when it has 
not been translated correctly, we do 
not believe in that. To all intents and 
purposes, however, the Bible which is 
common among us is accepted by the 
Latter-day Saints as the word of God. 
When you refer to the Book of Mormon, 
however, you say that the Book of 
Mormon is the word of God, without 
any qualification. 

Now, what is it that the Latter-day 
Saints believe in? We believe that 
holy men of old spake and wrote as 
they were moved upon by the Holy 
Ghost, and that which they spoke and 
wrote was the word of God; and if that 
has been handed down to us in its 
purity, we accept it as being the word 
of God. The Book of Mormon comes

GENERAL, CONFERENCE. 



to us fresh from the pen of the prophet, 
and was translated under the inspira- 
tion of our Heavenly Father by one 
whom He raised up for that purpose. 
Consequently we can accept it without 
qualification as being the word of God. 
We also believe in the Book of Doc- 
trine and Covenants, because it con- 
tains the predictions of the prophets 
and the revelations of God delivered 
unto this people by the living oracles 
upon the earth in this day and age 
of the world. We read in the scriptures 
that man shall not live by bread alone, 
but by every word that proceedeth out 
of the mouth of God. The Latter-day 
Saints understand that the Lord will 
yet reveal many things pertaining to 
the upbuilding of His kingdom upon 
the earth. In other words, we believe 
in learning the will of God through 
the proper channels, and then to do it. 
That is our creed, our faith. We have 
among us the living oracles of God. The 
mouthpiece of the Lord has spoken 
to us at the beginning of this con- 
ference, and in his remarks he gave 
unto us the word of the Lord. 
He gave us counsel upon certain 
things that' are of great importance to 
the Latter-day Saints, and we will 
do well to heed the counsel of 
God as it is delivered unto us. I 
take this lesson to myself, and I believe 
it ought to be the feeling of every Lat- 
ter-day Saint, to hearken to the warn- 
ing voice. As Latter-day Saints, we 
pray unto our Heavenly Father that 
the President of this Church may re- 
ceive wisdom from on high, and the in- 
spiration of His Holy Spirit and the 
revelations of His mind and will, that 
we may be guided and directed in the 
ways of all truth. How willing, there- 
fore, and how eager we ought to be to 
hearken unto his words and carry them 
out in our daily lives. The great spec- 
tacle that I see before me this after- 
noon is an evidence that the Latter- 
day Saints are eager to hear the words 
of the servants of God. No doubt, 
many have come today with the expec- 
tation of hearing the voice of the 
mouthpiece of God. But "what would it 
avail unto us unless we tried to carry 
out his advice and counsel? 

Whatever may arise as a hindrance to 
the work of the Lord ought to be dis- 



pensed with, and that which interferes 
with the performance of our duty ought 
to be set aside. The adversary of the 
souls of men is striving with all his 
might to thwart the purposes of our 
Heavenly Father; but in no particular 
do I think that he has had greater in- 
fluence upon the people at large than 
he has in taking advantage of theirtveak 
nesses by persuading them: to go beyond 
their means and into debt. It does not 
necessarily require a wicked man to 
yield to that influence at times. We are 
all more or less susceptible to it. Even 
some of the characteristics of our peo- 
ple which are to be commended— that, 
for example, of being unselfish and will- 
ing to let go of the substance that has 
come into our hands, have sometimes 
been a means that the adversary has 
employed to lead our people into debt. 
We have received, as has already been 
stated, a great many letters from the 
Seventies whose names have been sug- 
gested for missions to the nations of the 
earth, and the great majority of those 
letters have brought with them the 
spirit of the Gospel. The brethren have 
shown a willingness to respond to every 
call, and many of them have set forth 
their circumstances, but have closed 
their letters wtih a statement some- 
thing like this: "These are my circum. 
stances. I do not offer excuses. I am 
willing to go into the mission field, 
and lift up my voice and cry repentance 
unto this generation. I am willing to 
leave my home, because I know this is 
the work of the Lord." They have 
thereby placed the responsibility upon 
the authorities of the Church to decide 
whether or not they should go. Not- 
withstanding this, there has been no 
disposition to work any hardship upon 
the Seventies or the brethren suggested 
for missions, and many of them have 
been excused when we have known 
their circumstances. Over 100 have 
been released on account of their finan- 
cial condition. Thus the going in debt 
has been a hindrance to the work of the 
Lord. It has hindered the brethren 
from going out and magnifying their 
callings. It has been the means of de- 
priving them of privileges which they 
might enjoy if they were only free. 
Those who are encumbered with debt, 
indeed, know what it is to be in bond-

age. It is a block in the way of their 
magnifying their calling and responding 
to a call that would bring to them great 
joy and blessing. Oh! how willing we 
ought to be, and how careful to over- 
come the difficulties that stand between 
us and the performance of our duty. 

I ask the Lord to abundantly bless 
His people, and to bless all those who 
are striving to live by every word that 
cometh forth from the mouths of the 
prophets. May the Lord lead us to do 
His "will and keep His commandments, 
that thereby we may keep pace with 
the work of the Lord and do our part 
in helping to roll it on, is my prayer in 
i the name of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER HYRUM GOFF. 
(President of Jordan Stake.) 

My dear brethren and sisters, this is 
the first time in my life I have been 
called upon to address so large an audi- 
ence. I rely upon the Spirit of our 
Heavenly Father to sustain me; for I 
realize tha't I am surrounded by some 
of the best men upon the earth. In 
arising to represent the Jordan Stake 
of Zion, I do so with great pleasure. 
Our stake is yet in its infancy, being 
only about three years and three 
months old. It is located in the south- 
ern end of this county. Its area is 
about 15 by 30 miles. We have 13 
wards, and I believe all the organiza- 
tions that we have been called upon to 
establish are fully organized. I take 
great pleasure in representing our Sun- 
day schools. They are in a very good, 
flourishing condition; also our Mutual 
Improvement associations. Those who 
have been called upon to pres'de over 
these organizations are faithful men 
and women, who observe the law of 
tithing, and, I believe, the Word of 
Wisdom; for these are two of the qual- 
ifications required of them. We desire 
those who represent these young peo- 
ple's associations to strictly adhere to 
these things, that they may set an ex- 
ample to the others. I have had called 
to my assistance two worthy men as 
counselors. We are' working together 
in perfect harmony. Our High Coun- 
cilors are men of God, who are willing 



to sacrifice their time and talents to- 
promulgate the Gospel in our Stake. 
They are- willing, when called upon, to 
do missionary labor in the various 
wards, and labor with the people at 
their firesides, holding cottage meet- 
ings, etc. This has proved a great 
blessing to us, and we feel that great 
good will come of it. We have many 
aged people who are not able to at- 
tend public gatherings much, and it is 
our privilege to carry to them the joy 
and satisfaction that we have in the 
Gospel. We have many good, faithful 
Latter-day Saints, and we have some 
to whom it is necessary to preach re- 
pentance. I have taken great pleasure 
myself in visiting the homes of the 
Saints in the various wards. I desire 
to say that we have a good people 
there, and that we are enjoying the 
spirit of our religion to a goodly ex- 
tent. We have what is termed civil- 
ization with us. It should be "unciv- 
ilization." Out of our 13 wards we have 
10 that have no saloons; but I am sorry 
to report that in the other three we 
have enough to supply all the rest. 

My brethren and sisters, I take pleas- 
ure in testifying to you that I know 
this is the work of God. I have a tes- 
timony of it. When I got that testi- 
mony I do not know; for something 
over 53 years age I was born in the 
Church, and that testimony seems to 
have .been born within me. I desire 
that this testimony may be increased 
within me, and I know that it will as 
long as I am on the road of progress 
and intelligence. The more I learn of 
the Gospel, the stronger becomes my 
testimony, and I believe that is the 
case with all of us. I wish to testify 
that it is through the power of the Al- 
mighty that I am here today; for I 
know, had it not been for the power of 
the Holy Priesthood, I should have been 
gone hence before now. I feel a desire 
in my heart to testify to the goodness 
of my Heavenly Father in this line. I 
pray God to bless the faithful Latter- 
day Saints, and to stir up those who are 
not so faithful to renewed diligence. I 
ask these blessings, with all others that 
are necessary for us to prove true to 
the end, in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



ELDER COLLINS R. HAKES, 
(President of Maricopa Stake.) 

My dear brethren and sisters, in 
standing before you for a few moments 
I earnestly desire your faith and pray- 
ers, to the end that we may Be blessed 
in the time that I occupy. 

For twenty years, the 22nd of this 
month, I have been connected with the 
Maricopa Stake of Zion, which is situ- 
ated in the heart of the Arizona desert 
— the territory that we called the sun- 
kissed land. I have learned to love 
that land; I have learned to love the 
climate; I have learned to love many 
of the people in that country. While 
our stake is one of the smallest, if not 
the smallest, in all Zion, we have many 
good, staunch, thorough Latter-day 
Saints in that little stake — men and 
women who are seeking "first the king- 
dom of God and His righteousness, - ' 
and who have faith that God in His 
mercy will add all things that are 
necessary. But we are not all of that 
type. We have others that are not so 
full of faith and good works. We have 
the company of almost everything, in 
the shape of saloons, and orders, and 
societies that are not of God, to con- 
tend with; but the majority of the Lat- 
ter-day Saints in our little stake get 
along with the saloons by simply letting 
them alone, and we get along with our 
neighbors of the different societies by 
treating them with kindness and cour- 
tesy, but not affiliating with their or- 
ganizations. As a rule, they treat us in 
about the same way. We have in that 
country, I think, one of the most fer- 
tile and productive pieces of land that 
can be found within the bounds of the 
United States. We are lacking one ele- 
ment — water for irrigation purposes; 
but it certainly looks now as though 
that question was about to be solved in 
our country and a supply of water pro- 
vided sufficient to make that one of 
the most beautiful spots of the earth. 
We have every prospect of having it 
at an early date. Let me say that while 
many of our people have within the 
past few months pulled out of that 
country and gone to other parts, I feel 
in my heart that it will be many years 
before they are any more comfortably 
situated for making a living for them- 
selves and families than they were in 



Mesa, Arizona. This was the feeling 1 
had the other day when I separated 
from a company of fourteen who came 
with me as far as Ogden, and who were 
going into Montana, Canada and Idaho, 
seeking homes. I hope that they may 
be blessed, so far as the Lord sees fit 
to bless them and to give them better 
places than they have left. We sow our 
wheat in November and December, and 
we reap it in May and June, and when 
we have water we get from forty to 
fifty bushels to the acre. We put our 
stock upon the stubble until the middle 
of July, and then, if we have water, we 
plant corn and fall crops; and in our 
second crop we can get just as good a 
yield of corn as is got in almost any 
country. But these possibilities are 
only when the water supply is there. 

I say to the Latter-day Saints that 
want to breathe good warm air, come 
down to Arizona. We will give you a 
warm reception — especially if you come 
in July and August. I came here a lit- 
tle early this morning, and stood out- 
side before the doors were opened. Some 
of my friends were admiring the beau- 
tiful fresh and bracing breezes that 
were coming in from these snowelad 
hills, and I thought that If I only had 
power to bring down a few thousand 
cubic feet of Arizona weather and 
spread it out here, it would be a great 
benefit. But to me, my brethren and 
sisters, it does not matter where I live; 
it does not matter a great deal how 
long I live; but it does matter a great 
deal how I live. I believe that God is 
able to adapt us to the elements of the 
country where the servants of God 
wish us to reside; and I believe that 
the men and women who are filled with 
the Spirit of God are filled with the 
spirit of contentment, and that they 
will seek after the kingdom of God and 
His righteousness in any land or clime, 
hot or cold. If you want a healthful 
clime, we have it in Arizona. I believe 
we have as many days of sunshine in 
that country as there is in any land. We 
will positively agree not to freeze you; 
but we will give you plenty of good 
warm air to breathe, plenty of room to 
labor, and a country that under the 
blessings of God and the toil of the 
Latter-day Saints will yield of its ful- 
ness, as results to the farmer. 

May God bless all Israel in every 



ELDERS DANIEL HBINER AND J. S. PAGE, JR. 



Clime, and prosper His work, and bless 
His servants with the power of the holy 
Priesthood, that Zion may grow and 
spread abroad and her borders be 
stengthened, is my desire and prayer 
in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER DANIEL HEINER. 
(President of Morgan Stake.) 
If the Lord will bless me with His 
spirit and give me strength, I will be 
pleased to say a few words in reporting 
the Morgan Stake. The Morgan Stake 
is comparatively small. Brother Hakes 
stated that he had one of the smallest 
Stakes. I have been thinking that we 
had almost the smallest in the Church. 
We live in a very small valley, but the 
soil is very fertile. The Presidency of 
the Stake feel that they have a very 
good people. The Priesthood of Mor- 
gan Stake are becoming more united, 
and the prospect for the spiritual 
growth of the people is very favorable. 
The Presidency of the Stake are united. 
We meet once a week. My counselors 
understand just about a s much of the 
condition of the stake as I do. I have 
two very good counselors. The same 
may be said of the High Council. Our 
financial condition is improving. The 
people are just beginning, I believe, 
to find out the value of their homes. I 
think the homes in Weber valley have, 
in the estimation of the people there, 
increased in value 100 per cent within 
the last year or two. It is probably 
due to the people cultivating the land 
more thoroughly and making better use 
of their time and opportunities. The 
organizations in the Stake, such as the 
Sunday school, we are very proud of. 
We feel that there is an extra good 
work being done in the Sunday schools 
and in the Mutual Improvement associ- 
ations. I am happy to say that every- 
thing is favorable in the Stake, al- 
though we have some people that are a 
long way off from being as good as 
they ought to be; but the Presidency 
of the Stake are encouraged by the pros- 
pects." I thank the Lord for a living 
fpstimony of the Gospel. I thank Him 
that He blessed me witn gooaiy parents, 
who taught me the Gospel, and that He 
gave me faith in the Gospel, so much so 
that I have a living testimony, which 



comforts me all my days. I ask the 
Lord to bless the people in the Morgan 
Stake and in the whole Church, in the 
name of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER J. S. PAGE, JR. 
(President of Nebo Stake.) 

My brethren and sisters, for a good 
many years I have been in the habit 
of attending the annual and semi-an- 
nual conferences of the Church, but 
have sat in the congregation and look- 
ed from there in this direction, and I 
must confess that I had grown to feel 
much more at home than I do standing 
here facing you. At the same time it 
is an inspiring spectacle to see this 
large number from among the hosts of 
Israel, gathered together in the name of 
the Lord. It gives one some impression 
of the strength of the work that the 
Lord is accomplishing upon the earth, 
and we take strength from one another 
in thus assembling. In standing before 
you for a short time to represent the 
affairs in the Nebo Stake of Zion, I do 
so in humility and with a desire to have 
utterance given me of the Lord for this 
purpose. The Priesthood of that Stake 
are engaged in preaching the Gospel as 
recorded in the scriptures, which were 
written by holy men of God as they 
were moved upon by the Holy Ghost. 
They are endeavoring to realize the ef- 
ficacy of the atonement of the Lord 
Jesus Christ, to understand our rela- 
tionship to Him, and our dependence 
upon His atonement and labor. We 
are endeavoring also to honor the 
Prophet Joseph Smith as an instrument 
of God, who was called to establish Zion 
in the last days, and through whom the 
Gospel was restored, with the authority 
to administer its ordinances; to also 
honor those who have succeeded him in 
the Presidency, and to realize that their 
words spoken by the inspiration of the 
Holy Spirit are the words of God unto 
His people. In addition to this, we are 1 
trying to have every man who holds a 
portion of the Priesthood honor the of. 
fice and station in which he is called to 
labor and magnify the Priesthood that 
has been placed upon him. In doing 
this we have taken pains that not one 
young man of sufficient years should be 
overlooked, but that all should have 



50 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



the opportunity to labor according to 
their capacity and desire, that they may 
not rise up in later days and say that 
the doorway to progress and advance- 
ment had been closed in their face by 
those whose duty it was to open it. The 
Priesthood are also trying to inculcate 
the principles of faith, humility, obedi- 
ence, and a seeking after the things of 
God, in order that they may have the 
Spirit of God to be a companion and 
guide, that we may all realize that 
light has come into the world, and that 
we may walk according to that light, 
and continue to be in companionship 
with the Holy Ghost. I believe I can 
say with truth that the very great ma- 
jority of the Priesthood are striving to 
labor for the establishment of Zion up- 
on the earth, and to be enabled to give 
a good report of the work that is placed 
in their hands to accomplish. This can 
be said, too, of those who preside over 
and labor in the auxiliary societies of 
the Church. As a rule, they are zealous 
and earnest. The interest of the re- 
ligion class work particularly comes to 
my mind at this time. It is something 
that we have not given as much atten- 
tion to as some other branches of the 
work; but with its development in our 
midst we begin to appreciate the bless- 
ing of the Lord in having this establish- 
ed among us, and we look for great 
good to come therefrom. It is coming 
to be loved by the people. The Priest- 
hood of the stake are working together 
in harmony from first to last, so far as 
I am acquainted, with a desire to be 
humble, to be led by the- Holy Spirit, 
and to labor according to the counsels 
of the Prophet of God and to sustain 
those who preside over us. That we 
may be able to continue to do so, and 
that the blessings of God may be upon 
all the Church in every part of the 
earth, is my prayer in the name of the 
Lord Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER JOSEPH M. TANNER. 
Development of Church school system — Efforts in 
the direction of manual training — Beneficent 
effects of technical instruction — Its application 
to agriculture — A local scientific expert. 

I have enjoyed very much the spirit 
and instructions of this Conference, and 
I trust that I may have your interest 
while I report the work that has been 



placed in my charge. We have an or- 
ganization which we call the Church 
schools. Twenty of these institutions 
are located in Utah, Arizona, Idaho and 
Old Mexico. They are attended by about 
5,000 of our young people, and the in- 
crease of late has been quite marked. 
Last year we had 940 students more 
than the preceding year. 

I was very gratified yesterday to hear 
President Smith speak upon some mat- 
ters of education to the people at large, 
and manifest to them the same desire 
that he has manifested to the Church 
board of education and the ooard of ex. 
aminers. I am very pleased to say that 
•we are making special efforts to intro- 
duce manual training into these schools. 
In Salt Lake City — and what is true 
of this city is true of other places— we 
have hundreds of young men who leave 
the schoolroom during the summer sea- 
son, and for three or four months are 
without employment, left to pastime 
that leads them into idleness and fre- 
quently into frivolous lives. The ques- 
tion arose as to what should be done 
with these young people during these 
long summer vacations. If we had in 
the City of Salt Lake a manual training 
school, hundreds of our boys within a 
very few summers might learn much 
that goes to make up a trade. Looking 
to these particular needs. President 
Smith appointed a committee to make 
investigation and report to the Gen- 
eral Church Board of Education the 
status of affairs in this respect, and 
also what, in the judgment of the com- 
mittee, could be done| to remedy the 
evils that are so apparent among us. A 
report has not been made, and there- 
fore I cannot give you the findings of 
that body. But I desire to call your at- 
tention to one item of their investiga- 
tion. After a careful computation of 
the industrial situation in this state, 
from the standpoint of the tradesman, 
it was found, reckoning on a conserva- 
tive basis, that we are paying out every 
year something like eight millions of 
dollars to tradesmen; that our own peo- 
ple are diminishing in numbers in this 
class ; that many of the older <ones are, 
so to speak, out of date, not having 
kept up with the demands of the times; 
that we are gathering few from foreign 
countries who learn trades in their na_ 



ELDER JOSEPH M. TANNER.

tive land, and that we are having few 
or no apprentices among us. One of this 
committee (several of which are at the 
head of industrial concerns in this city) 
made the remark that during the 30 
years he had been in charge of a build- 
ing firm they had not educated one sin- 
gle apprentice. We feel the necessity 
of this training. We feel that the peo- 
ple should give it their support. I am 
perfectly free to say to you this after- 
noon that many of the Latter-day 
Saints are overly-anxious that their 
sons should become bookkeepers. We 
have 10 young men anxious to become 
bookkeepers where we have a place for 
one of them when they are educated. 
We do not have one 'young man learn- 
ing a trade where there is and will be 
a demand for 50 of them within the 
next few years. So they are preparing 
in great numbers for that which they 
are not likely to need, and neglecting 
that which they ought to have in the 
course of their education. One of the 
reasons for this is the sentiment which 
the parents inculcate in the hearts of 
their children by encouraging them to 
pursue some branch of study that is 
called culture. I 'would like to relate 
an anecdote that explains much of our 
educational culture in these times. 
Some few years ago, when I was at 
Harvard, the dean of the scientific 
school said to me that our educational 
culture was so empty and so worthless 
that he never used the word "culture" 
when he could possibly avoid it. Then 
he related an anecdote of two farmers 
who were cultivating their land 
near the town of Cambridge, where 
the Harvard university is situated. 
These two farmers came to the parti- 
tion fence one day, and one of them 
said to the other, "John, what is cul- 
ture " 'Why," John says, "don't you 
know what culture is?" "No," said 
he; "I hear these school teachers that 
come by here on to Arlington Heights 
in the summer time, talking about cul- 
ture. They say, he is cultured, or she 
is cultured, or they are cultured, and 
'Oh, my, how I do love culture!' Now, 
what are they talking about?" "Why," 
said John, "you know what potato cul- 
ture is?" "Yes, I know that." "And 
you know what wheat culture is?" 
"Yes, I know that." "Well, you take 



out the wheat, and take out the pota- 
toes, and then you have the culture." 

Our education has been provided in 
a large measure by the state, and it 
has made its demands upon us, and that 
education has been almost exclusively 
confined to books. In some of the east- 
ern states wealthy men are contribut- 
ing their means for the establishment 
of technical institutions, where young 
men can learn mechanism; and these 
institutions are most interesting. In 
some of the states the government it- 
self is establishing schools of technical 
training, in order that the citizens may 
be more useful. 1 expect to see the day 
in Utah when the men that are pos- 
sessed of means will contribute likewise 
for the establishment of similar insti- 
tutions in the state and in the Church, 
that our young people may become 
more useful in building up the country. 
For mechanism has in it something 
that is stable. It educates the judg- 
ment, and it gives wisdom to the men 
and women who are trained to use their 
hands along with their brains. Its 
importance to us cannot be overesti- 
mated. 

A few months ago I had the oppor- 
tunity of traveling through Canada 
and some of the cities of the east. I 
found in many of those large cities 
schools of technical training. I found 
they had a very beneficial influence 
upon the morals of the people. For 
example, these schools were kept up 
from morning until ten o'clock at night. 
During the middle of the day you would 
see the bootblack, after his work was 
over in the morning, wend his way into 
the school; and the newsboy, after he 
had sold his morning edition, was going 
into this technical school, that he might 
learn him a trade. I am told that 
some of those boys have already grad- 
uated from these schools^ and that in- 
stead of blacking boots or selling news- 
papers they are now mechanics, earn- 
ing good wages ,and are valuable citi- 
zens in the communities where they 
live. I remember very well when visit- 
ing one of these polytechnic schools in 
Brooklyn, the man took us into a room 
and said, "These benches and this 
work are all ready for the men who 
come here at night." I asked him who 
these men were. He replied, "They are

mostly clerks from the stores and men 
that are driving teams. After their 
work is over at six o'clock in the even- 
ing, they go home at once to supper, 
and they are here by seven o'clock. 
It is only a question of two or three 
years until their services are demanded 
in some of the best workshops of the 
city ,and some of them now are earn- 
ing large salaries." Many of our young 
men find themselves compelled to take 
up vocations in life for which they are 
not suited. They are clerking in stores 
when they have that mechanical talent 
that would make them most useful in 
that line. 

"We are encouraging some of our 
young men to go east and work up in 
these technical schools. One or two 
are now at work, and it is hoped that 
others will go as soon as they possibly 
can, and fit themselves for the demands 
that must be made upon them in the 
near future. We not only desire that 
these schools should be organized in the 
Church, but it is only a question of 
time when they will be organized in 
the state and our Legislature will be 
as anxious to appropriate money to 
teach men to be artisans as they are 
to teach them Latin and Greek and 
foreign languages that they have no 
use for; but we can hardly make some 
of our legislators today realize that 
manual training and that the artisan 
is as important to our state as the stu- 
ient of Greek and Latin. I desire to 
say that we shall respond as far and 
as rapidly as we can to the instructions 
which our President has given us. We 
realize only too well the truth of his 
remarks in this respect. 

One thing more. We have organized 
in this state an agricultural experiment 
station. It has given out very valuable 
information that will make our people 
scientific and technical farmers; aye, 
and teach them hew to cultivate the 
soil, how to raise stock; and our house- 
wives how to produce in this state a 
million dollars a year more than they 
do from their poultry. When I was 
in Canada I was told of the great value 
to the farmers of that country the bul- 
letins issued by Dr. Widtsoe, of the 
Agricultural college, had been to them; 
how many thousands of dollars those 
bulletins had been in wealth to the peo- 
ple away off in eastern Canada. I asked 



myself the question, How much value 
have these bulletins been to the people 
in the state where they are issued? Dr. 
Truman Allen, of the Agricultural sta- 
tion at Washington, says of them that 
they are the highest authority in the 
world on the subjects that they treat 
of. And Dr. Widtsoe is one of our home 
boys, and is giving out to the world this 
information that is doing so many hun- 
dreds of thousands of dollars' good to 
the world, while many of us at home 
have scarcely gained any value from 
them whatever! I was very glad when 
the Legislature set apart something 
like $12,000 for experimental work in the 
dry farms of this state; and if you will 
watch the work of* this eminent scient- 
ist, if you will read something of his 
bulletins, you will gain great advan- 
tage, and you may become professional 
farmers and stockraisers. He is just 
how finishing a bulletin on irrigation. 
I understand it will be out of the press 
soon. I hope that he will isue a popu- 
lar edition of it— that is, strip it of its 
scientific and technical terms; for I am 
sure that when we come to find out 
something more about irrigation we 
shall discover that after all in many 
places it is not more water that we 
need, but a more scientific and accurate 
use of the water that we have already. 
So I am pleased to make these state- 
ments to you here, because I feel that 
by a little attention on our own part, 
by following the investigations and ex- 
periments of eminent men in our midst, 
and especially by following the work of 
our scientist, Dr. Widtsoe, we may gain 
a great deal that is valuable and that 
will increase the wealth and prosperity 
of the people. 

Our schools, above all things, aim to 
inculcate the Spirit of God in our young 
people, and fit and qualify them for the 
mission of disseminating the Gospel of 
Jesus Christ to the nations of the 
earth. I need not say to you that 
these schools have accomplished a vast 
amount of good in this respect, and 
there is hardly a family in the Church 
that has not felt, directly or indirectly, 
the spiritual blessings that have come 
to their homes from these institutions 
of learning. 

God bless you. God bless the schools, 
and all the departments and organiza- 
tions of Zion, that there may be a har-

monious effort through all our labors 
for the accomplishment of a common 
good. God bless the man that stands 
at the head of them all; for I want to 
testify to you today that I have great 
encouragement in this work from the 
interest that is felt by our President, 
and the Church Board of Education. 
The students feel it also, and his inter- 
est in their lives has been so exception- 
al and great that they are enthusiastic 
when he meets them in their schools 
and takes part with them in their ex- 
ercises. God bless you all. Amen.

Importance of cleanliness — Effects of its opposite — 
Other and worse conditions — Manual training 
— Future material development. 

I am indeed pleased, my brethren and 
sisters, for the privilege of addressing 
this vast audience this afternoon, for 
a few moments. It seems to me that 
the spirit of this Conference has been 
cne of teaching the people concerning 
the material interests of life, and I 
know of nothing better to speak of, as 
such instruction reaches the daily lives 
of all the people. 

There is a saying that cleanliness is 
next to Godliness; I hope I may be the 
means, through the Spirit of God, to 
bring the attention of our people to 
the necessity of cleanliness. If I had 
time, I would like to go into the sub- 
ject far enough to include cleanliness 
of the mind, cleanliness of the bo' 
cleanliness of the surroundings, clean- 
liness of city and town. I hope that the 
Bishops, and presidents of stakes, when 
they go home, will see that the atten- 
tion of the people over whom they pre- 
side is called to this subject. I wish 
that every family in Zion understood 
the value of cleanliness in the home. I 
have often said that a clean home does 
not, of necessity, mean a mansion; no 
matter how small the home may be, 
the father and mother, and particularly 
the mother, should be interested in 
keeping that home free from all filth. 
The father should keep clean the door- 
yard, the outhouses, the barns, the side- 
walks, and all that pertains to the 
home surroundings. The mother shoul 1 
see that the inside of the home, though 
it consist of but two rooms, is kept 
scrupulously clean. I can not stop to 



tell you of the thousand benefits that 
■would result from so doing; I know the 
people would be healthier; children 
would love their homes more, have 
more pride in them, enjoy more the 
beauties of nature, and learn more of 
the joys of life. I also trust that we 
can teach all to be clean in person, 
clean in their associations, and pure 
in their thoughts. 

I remember, when I was a small boy, 
President Brigham Young was making 
one of his tours and arrived at a town 
in one of the southern counties. He had 
intended to stop there and speak to the 
people, but, as he drove along the 
streets, entering town, he noticed the 
unclean condition of the surroundings. 
He drove direct to the Bishop's home, 
stopped his team and said to the 
Bishop, who stood in front of his resi 
denee waiting the arrival of the presi- 
dent: "Why Bishop, I see the same 
old rocks upon the streets; I see the 
same old dirty surroundings; I see the 
same old gates off their hinges; I see 
the same old broken down fences; I 
see the same old puddles of mud be- 
fore the tithing office and your public 
buildings, just as they were when I 
was last here; and, inasmuch as I called 
attention to these defects when I was 
here before, and it has had no effect 
upon the people whatever, I do not 
think it necessary for me to stop this 
time. Good-bye, Bishop. Tell the peo- 
ple when they attend to these things 
and rectify them, I will stop next time." 

I wish, my brethren and sisters, that 
we all could realize what it means to 
us as a people to keep our surroundings 
clean and pure. I assure you it is 
worthy our consideration and atten- 
tion. 

I read a synopsis of a speech that 
was made here the other day, by a 
reverend gentleman, before the Young 
Men's Christian association. 

He spoke to a large audience, and call- 
ed attention to what he termed the three 
reigning sins of this great nation of 
ours, viz: gambling, intemperance, and 
moral impurity. I am pleased to state 
that I can say amen to all that he said 
in regard to these subjects. But there 
are other things which I believe are 
just as much reigning sins as the three 
he spoke of. We know that these

three evils spoken of rob the home of 
comfort. They rot) the wife of a prob- 
able loving- and devoted husband. They 
rob the children of the necessities of 
life. They bring degradation and mis. 
ery into the home.s of millions of people. 
While I was thinking of these reigning 
sins, I thought too of other evils which 
are the cause of many men gambling 
and drinking, and leading impure lives; 
upon one of these evils or causes I 
want to say a few words this afternoon. 

One of the greatest evils of our day 
is that there are so many wilfully 
motherless wives. Closely connected 
with this is another, the wilful laziness 
of men who do not properly provide 
for their wives. Psychologists are 
studying these questions, and trying 
to solve the problem of why there is 
so much sin in the world today, so 
many men devoid of manliness, .so 
many vicious scoundrels who have no 
other aim in life than to prey upon 
mankind. I have thought many times 
there certainly is a reason for this; 
and at least one reason is, there are so 
many children brought into this world 
by unwilling mothers, the offspring al- 
so, in many cases, of equally unwilling 
fathers. Every child born into this 
world has a right to a tender and lov- 
ing welcome. It has a right, by laws 
of nature, to claim this of the father 
and mother; but in the world today — 
and I fear it is creeping- into our midst 
— mothers and fathers do not want 
many children. They "do not want to 
be bothered with them," as it is so often 
said. Coming home from the east late- 
ly, I was conversing with a man on the 
train, and he remarked to me: "Why, 
Mr. Smoot, I have one child, and I 
would not take a million dollars for it; 
but I 'would not give five cents for 
another." I want to tell the fathers 
and mothers of Israel that the first 
great law God guve to mankind is as 
binding today upon the world as it 
ever was, I hope and trust that the peo- 
ple of this nation, and' of this Church in 
particular, will live according to this 
law, and not violate it in any manner. 
Let us, my brethren and sisters, show 
to the world that we love children more 
than we do lapdogs. Let us show that 
we love our offspring more than any- 
thing earthly, so that the world may 



understand that what God reveals 'we 
believe and practice. I promise you 
that if we live to this law, God will 
provide for the men and women who, 
willingly and lovingly, bring children 
into this world and teach them His 
commandments. 

You have, doubtless, noticed, of late, 
that' President Roosevelt has called the 
attention of the world to the fact that 
"race suicide" is one of the great evils 
of the day. I thank God that this na- 
tion of ours has a man as its president, 
who believes it the duty of all married 
people to become parents. I also re- 
joice that the wife God gave him is 
thankful she is the mother of a num- 
ber of children — not ashamed of one of 
them. He believes in rearing children, 
and in making the home an altar for 
our religious devotion. He believes in 
bringing children into the world by 
willing parents, and making Americans 
of them. I believe that this theory is 
pleasing in the sight of God. So 
I say to my brethren and sisters today, 
and I would that I had the pow- 
er to say to the world, Stop "race sui- 
cide." If you don't want a family, 
don't get married. I hope that we, 
as Latter-day Saints, will learn from 
the experiences of the world the evil 
effects of "race suicide," and not pass 
through the experiences ourselves. 

I have indee'd enjoyed the practical 
remarks made at this Conference. Ever 
since I was twenty-two years of age, 
I have said on many occasions that, if 
God blessed me with sufficient means, 
I would some day establish a school of 
manual training. I have noticed the 
lack of this in our schools for many 
years. Many, perhaps, have said that 
I was a crank on this subject. But, I 
have been placed in a position, at the 
Provo Woolen Mills, where I have seen 
the evils that exist in the lack of manu- 
al education for our children. I can 
go to Provo today and put up. a notice 
for common laboring men at a salary 
of a dollar and a half a day and the 
next morning, more than likely, there 
would bs dozens of applications; but 
just let me post a notice that we want 
a competent finisher, head of a de- 
partment, or a dyer, and there would 
not be a person in all of the state of 
Utah make application, that is quali-

lied for the position. I desire to say 
to the people of Utah that we are on 
the verge of an opportunity for wonder- 
ful growth, and, while we may have re- 
verses and hard times at intervals.there 
will be an impetus come to this state 
that we little dream of at present. 
There will be great iron manufactories 
In the south, and many great smelting 
plants in different parts of the state. 
The time will come, and it is not far 
distant, when the manufacturing inter- 
ests of this state will be the greatest 
of her industries. Are we preparing 
for this? I take it for granted that 
the smelters we have today can get all 
the common laborers they want for two 
dollars or two dollars and fifty cents 
per day; but, if they require a man 
who knows the business thoroughly,and 
who could take charge of it, I guaran- 
tee that they can not find him here, but 
will have to look to some eastern city 
where people, through necessity, have 
learned that, in order to get along in 
this world, they must be thoroughly 



educated in some particular line or 
calling. 

Before sitting down, I desire to say 
that I feel grateful to my heavenly 
Father for His special blessings to me; 
and I am also grateful to the people of 
this state for their confidence in me. 
I know that if we pray to God in ear- 
nestness He certainly will sustain us. 
The danger of our becoming lukewarm 
is not from without — the danger is 
ivithin. I hope and trust that God will 
strengthen us; that He will make us 
honest, upright and honorable members 
of His Church; that we will never falter 
for a minute, nor ever have a doubt 
this this is the Church and Kingdom 
of God. God bless us all, I ask it in 
the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

PRESIDENT JOHN R. WINDER. 

Important recent occurrences — Beneficent characl er 
oi Temple work— Suggestions about Marriage 
— Indebtedness should be avoided — Work of 
God pressing onwrd to Its destiny, 

I am very much gratified this morning 
to have another privilege of meeting 



with you in conference, and have been 
delighted with what I have seen and 
heard during the last two days. 

I am reminded this morning of an oc- 
currence that took place just ten years 
ago — the dedication of the Salt Lake 
Temple by President Wilford Woodruff; 
and I have reflected a little upon some 
of the things that have happened since 
that time. Two presidents of the 
Church — President Woodruff and Presi- 
dent Snow 1 — have passed away; one 
First Counselor — President George Q. 
Cannon; one President of the Twelve 
Apostles — President Franklin D. Rich- 
ards; and one Apostle. But, my breth- 
ren and sisters, they have not lost inter- 
est in the work that we are now en- 
gaged in. Since the dedication, of the 
Salt Lake Temple there have been per- 
formed in that house about eight hun- 
dred thousand ordinances, or about 
eighty thousand per annum. While the 
world are ridiculing and scoffing at 
what we are doing in the temples, I 
wish to say to you all, and you can 



58 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



bear testimony of the same, that every 
ordinance, every ceremony that is per- 
formed therein is pf a sacred and holy 
character. Every ordinance performed 
there makes better fathers, better 
mothers, better children, better hus- 
bands and wives, better citizens of the 
state, and better citizens 'Of the United 
States. Nothing occurs in that house 
that we need be ashamed of; but 
everything that takes place there is for 
the betterment of all who attend. I 
presume that there are thousands now 
listening to my voice who could testify 
to the truth of that which I speak. 

There is one thing we regret some- 
times, and that is with regard to our 
young people who, when they are about 
to enter matrimony, fail to come to the 
house of the Lord to have' the cere- 
mony performed there; because we 
know that if they are prepared to enter 
that house they will receive ordinances 
that will be of great benefit to them 
while they live. We also regret 
sometimes to learn that some 
of our sisters contract alliances with 
those who are not of our faith. It has 
been said that we are too exclusive in 
this matter. I was reading an article 
in a paper yesterday, and I took a 
clipping from it to show that we are 
not the only ones that are exclusive in 
this respect. This article was headed 
"Mixed Marriages Barred in Future," 
and the clippings reads: 

"Chicago, April 4th. 

"The Record-Herald New York cor- 
respondent says: Owing to the recep- 
tion of orders from the Propaganda at 
Rome, Archbishop Farley will not offici- 
ate at the wedding of Reginald Vander- 
bilt and Miss Catherine Neilson. Posi- 
tive instructions have been received by 
the Roman Catholic hierarchy of the 
"United States forbidding them to offici- 
ate at any more weddings in which one 
of the contracting parties is not a Ro- 
man Catholic." 

So, brethren and sisters, you see that 
we do not stand alone on this question. 
"We know from past experience that 
where our sisters have entered Into 
matrimonial engagements with those 
not of our faith they have, as a rule, 
proved to be unhappy. Therefore, we 
want to urge upon the presidents of 
stakes, Bishops, and officers every- 
where, to use your influence with our 



young people in regard to tnis matter, 
to the end that they may so order their 
lives as to be prepared to come to the 
house of the Lord when they desire to 
enter the sacred and holy state of wed- 
lock, and be worthy of a recommenda- 
tion from their Bishop, signed by the 
president of the stake. 

I want to sustain the remarks made 
by our president in the opening of this 
conference, with reference to going into 
debt. It is a matter of regret, but I 
am cognizant of the fact that many of 
our people even now are mortgaging 
their homes and farms to obtain money 
for the purpose of going into some 
speculation. It is all very well for us, 
if we have a little means aside from' our 
homes and farms, to go into some en- 
terprise wherein we think we can make 
something for ourselves, if we wish to 
do so; but when it comes to borrowing 
money and mortgaging our homes, it ia 
liable to prove very disastrous. I could 
mention a number of our brethren who 
in the "boom" mortgaged their homes 
and entered into speculation and enter- 
prises which proved disastrous failures, 
and today they are without homes to 
cover the heads of their wives and chil- 
dren. Let us take warning from this, 
my brethren and sisters. I know that 
what President Smith said yesterday ia 
timely and appropriate. It is said by 
some that we are going to have an era 
of prosperity. All right; let prosperity 
come, and if during that time we can 
get out of debt, we will rejoice that we 
are out of debt. But if, on the other 
hand, a time' of adversity should come, 
and we are in the bondage of debt, 
what will be the result? We will likely 
lose our homes and our farms. I hope, 
therefore, that we will take to heart 
what was said in relation to this mat- 
ter. It is important that we should. 

I do not know how many more con- 
ferences the Lord will permit me to en- 
joy with you; but I know He has been 
very merciful to me, and has extended 
my days beyond what I could expect. I 
will soon be 82 years of age, and I re- 
joice to think that the Lord has so pre- 
served me that I have this one more 
privilege of standing before you. 

Now, my brethren and sisters, when we 
go from this conference let us go with 
a determination, each one of us, that 



ELDER WM| A. HYDE.

"as for me and my house, we will serve 
the Lord." I have a very strong- impres- 
sion that missionaries will not be with- 
drawn from the nations of the earth, 
and that the temples will not be closed, 
but that the work will progress and go 
on from this time henceforth with 
greater force and strength than it ever 
has done before. My the Lord help us 
all to be faithful and true, even to the 
end, is my prayer in the name of 
Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER WILLIAM A. HYDE, 
(President of Pocatello Stake.) 
My beloved brethren and sisters, I am 
deeply sensible of the honor that is 
conferred upon me and the considera- 
tion that is shown our stake by this 
privilege of standing before you to re- 
port. I have been greatly interested in 
the remarks that have fallen from the 
lips of other presidents of stakes who 
have had a like privilege. In a certain 
sense, - it has been to me a convention 
of brethren holding like responsibilities 
to myself, and for that reason I have 
listened wtih a great deal of interest. 
I have learned much from the older 
brethren who have occupied positions of 
responsibility for years, and who have 
had many experiences, some of them 
we are undergoing at present. Especial- 
ly was I impressed with the patriotism 
of the remark uttered yesterday by one 
of the brethren, who said it did not 
matter to him 'where he lived, so long as 
he was doing the work of the Lord. 
That has been my feeling since my in- 
cumbency in this position. 

Our stake might be termed almost a 
composite of the other stakes of Zion; 
for we have within it many of the prob- 
lems that confront them all. "We have 
our large areas of uncultivated and 
arid land; we have little communities 
that are flourishing, but have not the 
advantage of close proximity to the 
head of the Church; we have a large 
railroad town, in which problems of la- 
bor and the employment of our breth- 
ren are to be considered; we have the 
disadvantages that arise from living in 
cities of this character, and the other 
ills and evils that have been mentioned. 
But I am pleased to say that we have 



a people whose desire is to do the will of 
the Lord. Our stake has been organized 
about five years, of which time I have 
been at the head only two years. Since 
the stake was organized our tithing has 
increased 60 per cent; and taking into 
consideration the fact that our numbers 
have not been largely augmented, I 
take it is an evidence of the spiritual 
growth of our people. I believe their de- 
sire still is to serve the Lord and to 
increase in this particular requirement. 
The brethren are united in their work. 
We feel that we cannot do too much for 
the kingdom of God; and although 
there ar e many obstacles, which at 
times have seemed insurmountable, 
every temporary embarrassment and 
apparent defeat we have only consider- 
ed as a stepping stone to our ultimate 
success. We believe that the time will 
come when we shall not be considered 
one of the smallest or least efficient 
of the stakes, but that in due time we 
shall do our part toward the glory of 
God. My faith is strong in the promises 
which have been made to the people 
of God. I believe in their ultimate suc- 
cess. All my life I have looked for- 
ward to the time when our people shall 
be vindicated, when the nations of the 
•world shall look upon us as we really 
are, when our virtues shall be known, 
and we shall be indeed a light set upon 
a hill, by which they may get ideas of 
advancement. I have been galled all my 
life under the criticisms that have been 
uttered against those brethren that 
have stood at our head, whom we have 
known to be men of honor, honesty of 
purpose, and of integrity. I confidently 
expect to see the time come when they 
shall be vindicated in the eyes of the 
world. 

Brethren and sisters, I bear my testi- 
mony to the truth of the work of the 
Lord. I know it is of God. I feel in my 
heart that the day of our triumph is not 
far distant, that there is an undercur- 
rent of success and of spiritual progress 
permeating the entire body of the 
Church, and, that the only result that 
can ensue from this will be our in- 
crease in things spiritual and things 
temporal, and the increase of the glory 
of God upon the earth; which I pray 
for in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

GENERAL, CONFERENCE. 



ELDER DAVID CAMERON, 
(President of Panguitch Stake.) 

My brethren and sisters, I feel high- 
ly honored in having this privilege, 
although very weak. I desire that the 
Spirit of the Lord may be with me in 
the few remarks I may make, that I 
may speak those things that will be 
for our mutual good. 

The Panguitch Stake of Zion is locat- 
ed in the southern part of this state. 
We are in a high altitude, ranging from 
5,000 feet to 8,000 feet above sea level; 
consequently we have all kinds of cli- 
mate. For the last four months the 
valley in which the town of Panguitch 
is situated has been covered with snow, 
and the only bare ground to be seen 
was where the streets had been worr 
by travel. Such a condition has not 
been known there before. Consequently 
we feel that we will be blessed of the 
Lord in the supply of water for the 
coming year. Some wards in our Stake 
have neglected putting in grain during 
the last year, on account of the scarc- 
ity of water, realizing that if they put 
it in it would perish for want of mois- 
ture. There are ten wards in our Stake, 
and upwards of 3,600 inhabitants. We 
have a good people in that Stake, who 
are trying to serve the Lord and keep 
His commandments, although we have 
those that do not take much interest 
in the work. The presidency of the 
Stake are in harmony; also the High 
Council of the Stake. The presidency 
meet together once a week, except on 
rare occasions when they are not at 
home, to talk over matters pertaining 
to the Stake; and they meet once a 
month with the High Council. The 
High Council are given to understand 
that the presidency of the Stake do 
not expect to carry the responsibilities 
of the Stake alone, but that they expect 
the High Council to help them. We 
have many children in our Stake. Last 
Fourth of July was celebrated in Pan- 
guitch, and there was a Washington 
official present. After it Was over, he 
asked me about the population of Pan- 
guitch. I told him it was somewhere 
between 800 and 1,000. Well, said he, 
about three-fourths of them I suppose 
are children, there was such a turnout 
of them. We have about 1,400 children 



of school age in the Stake. We have 
1,100 in Garfield county. The Stake 
takes in Garfield county and a part of 
Piute county. Last year we had in the 
neighborhood of seventy going to the 
Beaver Branch of the Brigham Young 
Academy. Our organizations are in 
tolerably good condition. The religion 
class, however, is not worked up very 
well. It is running in some of our 
wards. We hops it will be better in 
the future. 

I know the Gospel is true. I know 
this is the Church of God; and inas- 
much as we will observe the command- 
ments of the Lord we will be blessed, 
and His Spirit will be with us to help 
ut in all our endeavors to do right. We 
have before us the Presidency of the 
Church. The Lord has said that He re- 
veals His mind and will, for the people, 
to none save His servants the Prophets. 
This is one thing we should look to, 
that we should give heed to the coun- 
sels of the Prophets of the Lord, and to 
the things that President Smith has 
stated during this Conference. While 
he was speaking in regard to the law 
of Tithing and the obligations of debt, 
I thought that many of the brethren 
are not as careful in paying their tithing 
as they are in meeting their obligations 
to individuals. Many do not come to 
settle their tithing with the Bishop. 
They pay what they choose as tithing 
and they never go to the Bishop to find 
•out whether they have paid their tith- 
ing or not. They do not know 
whether the Bishop has sent dn 
their names as full tithepayers or part 
tithepayers. Every individual should 
be as careful in settling his account 
with the Lord as he is with his 
brothers and sisters. 

I pray that the Lord may bless us, 
and let His Spirit be with us today as 
it has been in the past, that we may be 
instructed and built up in our faith, and 
be encouraged to go from this Confer- 
ence to do better in the future than we 
have in the past. May the Lord bless 
us to this end, is my prayer. Amen. 

ELDER ANGUS M. CANNON 
(President of Salt Lake Stake). 

It is twenty-seven years today since 
your humble servant was permitted by 



ELDER ANGUS M. CANNON. 



59 



the grace of God to preside over the 
Salt Lake Stake of Zion, and I believe 
I am as nervous today as I was at that 
time, when my name was called. The 
fact is, I am familiar with something 
of the responsibility that rests upon a 
man in this position. There have been 
four temples dedicated to the Lord in 
that time. There have been five dif- 
ferent men presiding as the mouthpiece 
of God to this people in that time. In 
sitting here and contemplating the re- 
marks which were made by brethren of 
the Twelve in Winter Quarters, before 
they started for this valley, I have 
been led to ask myself, Is it possible 
that the brethren comprehended this 
scene in the time that has elapsed since 
that day until now? How many of us 
are there that have kept our estate, 
maintained and preserved our inherit- 
ances, and given evidences in our con- 
duct that we are here simply to possess 
the Priesthood of the Lord, to minister 
in His name, to His honor and glory, 
and to our own salvation? 

Twenty-seven years ago this stake 
consisted of the counties of Tooele, Da- 
vis, Morgan, Summit, Wasatch, and 
Salt Lake. Five stakes have been 
organized in these five adjoining coun- 
ties, and since that time two other 
stakes — Jordan and Granite Stakes, 
within this county— have been organ- 
ized out of this stake. Today this stake 
numbers upwards of twenty thousand 
members of the Church and between 
five and six thousand children under 
eight years of age. In the organization 
of the stake twenty- seven years ago, 
the late David O. Calder was the first 
counselor and Joseph E. Taylor the sec- 
ond counselor. Today Joseph E. Taylor 
and C. W. Penrose are the counselors 
to the president of the stake. In the 
twenty-seven years there has never 
been a disagreement between the presi- 
dncy of the stake, nor yet between the 
presidency of the stake and the High 
Council. The presidency of the stake 
and High Council, with the presidency 
of the High Priests' quorum, meet in 
the Temple once a week, and we also 
meet as occasion requires, for the 
transaction of business pertaining to 
the stake. The High Council take part 
in deliberating upon any changes that 
are effected. I am pleased to report 



that the High Council are efficient, 
united, and prompt in their attendance 
at meetings. We do not wait one 
minute to organize our councils. They 
are instructed that if there is no busi- 
ness they shall adjourn, if the presiden- 
cy are not prompt to the minute. Today 
there are thirty-seven wards in the 
stake, all in a prosperous and united 
condition, excepting one, where we feel 
it will be necessary to effect a change 
in some form, to bring about greater 
union and more of the fellowship of the 
Lord Jesus. We have all the organi- 
zations of the Church and the Priest- 
hood. We have sixteen quorums of 
Elders. We have a good attendance 
at our High Priests' meeting. Presi- 
dent McKenzie, of the High Priests' 
quorum, has adopted the rule of call- 
ing a roll, which has proved to be of 
great good. It prompts men to be pres- 
ent, to respond to their names, and to 
show that they are worthy of that 
Priesthood. The Elders' quorums are 
improving in their condition. We find 
some few that neglect their duties, and 
have effected changes in the organiza- 
tion? that have been of great good to 
the quorums. We find the instructions 
that are imparted to the quorums 
through the rules that have been en- 
acted for their government, tend to 
benefit the Elders of this stake. A great 
many have been called to take missions 
of late. It has not been deemed neces- 
sary to ordain all who go on missions 
to the office of Seventy, but many have 
gone clothed upon with the Melchisedek 
Priesthood, as helps unto the Seventies 
and to the Twelve. It is gratifying to 
witness the response that is made by 
the young men when they are called to 
engage in missionary work. The man- 
ner in which they lay aside their own 
personal matters and take the harness 
upon them is very encouraging. We 
have the Relief society, the Mutual Im- 
provement associations, the Primary 
associations, the Sabbath schools, all 
in successful operation, efficient as 
helps in the government of the Church. 

We feel that a serious evil arises from 
multitudes coming to this city to reside 
and depending upon the offerings of the 
people and the funds of the Church for 
their maintenance. 

Over a year ago I was amused in re- 



60 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



ceiving a letter from a president of a 
stake, in which he called upon me to 
forbear sending people into that stake 
who were poor. I smiled at the idea, 
because I never had been known to send 
a person to any other stake from this. 
On the other hand, they would come 
here in great numbers; and not con- 
tent with coming themselves, many that 
are supported by the Church funds and 
the offerings of the people have their 
young relatives come and eat of their 
substance and live off them, because 
here they can find amusements and the 
like. They do not realize the cost it 
is in the aggregate. 

The people, as a rule, are prosperous. 
I believe, as President Smith has ex- 
pressed himself, that today is one of 
the most prosperous times that is likely 
to dawn upon this people and this na- 
tion. I heartily endorse the remark 
that it is wise for us to refrain from 
contracting further debt, and use all our 
powers, by the help of God, to free 
ourselves from our present indebted- 
ness. Many have been compelled to 
forfeit their homes, which have gone 
into the hands of outsiders, and the 
latter in turn have established saloons 
and disreputable places right in the 
neighborhood where the most faithful 
live. There is no way to counteract 
this evil when people will voluntarily 
dispose of their homes, and then excuse 
themselves by saying that they had to 
sell out because they could not re- 
deem them, from mortgage. A fearful 
responsibility is sure to result to us is 
in these particulars. I think we will be 
held accountable for the society we in- 
troduce into the neighborhood to which 
people have honestly gathered from the 
nations, to be separate from the world 
and to partake not of their sins and 
their calamities. I believe the people 
of Salt Lake Stake are more zealous 
and more faithful than they have ever 
been. There are exceptions, of course. 
There are those that are falling away. 
It is as the Lord said it would be. 

God give us grace and strength, that 
we may be worthy to occupy the sta- 
tions He has permitted us to fill.wheth- 
er presiding in stakes, in wards, in 
quorums, in associations, or in our 
families; that when the day of account 
shall come, we may be able to render 



a faithful account of our stewardship 
and find justification at the hands of 
Jesus our Redeemer. Amen. 

ELDER LEWIS ANDERSON, 
(President of South Sanpete Stake.) 

My brethren and sisters, I can say 
1hat I truly rejoice in having an oppor- 
tunity of meeting with , you again in 
conference. It is like unto a fountain 
of living water, which the Saints come 
and partake of freely twice a year, and 
I believe we will go to our homes great- 
ly strengthened and blessed, and with 
a renewed determination to press on in 
the work of Gcd. I have been greatly 
instructed and built up in what has 
been said by the servants of God during 
the conference, and in standing before 
you for a few moments I trust that I 
may be actuated by the same spirit that 
they have been in possession of, and 
that I may report the condition of the 
South Sanpete Stake of Zion in truth- 
fulness. 

It is only a few months since I was 
appointed president of the stake, suc- 
ceeding our beloved president, the late 
lamented Canute Peterson, who had for 
so many years ably presided in the 
midist of the people of Sanpete county, 
now North and South Sanpete stakes. 
May his memory be green in the hearts 
of the people, and I am sure it will be, 
for the great good he has done; and his 
name will live in the hearts of the peo- 
ple among whom he so diligently la- 
bored day and night. Also his counsel- 
ors, President Beal and President Mai- 
ben, who have stood with him shoulder 
to shoulder in the great work that was 
given unto him. We shall remember 
them with gratitude unto our Heavenly 
Father. 

South Sanpete stake is located nearly 
due south from this city, about 120 miles 
to its northern boundary. It has nine 
wards, and a population of upwards of 
6,000. The quorums of the Priesthood 
are all properly organized, the auxil- 
iary associations are in good running 
order, and a great work has been done 
by them the past season, for which I 
ern very thankful. The presidency of 
the stake are united in their labor. That 
love which characterizes the most of 
such quorums exists with us. The same 



ELDER THOMAS A. WADDOUPS.

may be said of the High Council. The 
presidency of the stake meet once a 
week, the High Council once a month, 
and all matters that are for the work 
of the ministry in that stake of Zion 
are thoroughly canvassed a.nd passed 
upon by them before any action is tak- 
en. We are erecting in South Sanpete 
stake, together with the North Sanpete 
stake, a stake academy, upon which 
$20,000 has already been expended. The 
walls are up, and ready for the roof. 
It will be a magnificent building. The 
Saints of the two stakes are doing all 
the}' can in contributing towards its 
erection. Our stake the past year has 
paid $20,000 in tithing. This is not quite 
so large a tithing as has been paid in 
previous years; but it is a good one in 
view of our circumstances. For the last 
three years we have suffered consid- 
erably from drouth and grasshoppers, 
notwithstanding which the tithing has 
fallen off but little; in fact, I believe 
there has been a proportionate increase. 
We have a splendid prospect for an 
abundant harvest the present season 
The mountains are filled with snow; 
God has sent moisture upon the parched 
ground, and I believe, if the Saints will 
do their duty and heed the counsels of 
the servants of the Lord, they will be 
greatly blessed in their basket and in 
their store, according to the promises 
that God has given. Thousands of dol- 
lare have been expended the past two 
years in fighting the grasshopper pest. 
There has been a united effort on the 
part of the people to exterminate it. 
The civil authorities have lent their aid. 
and I believe that good results will 
come from the labor performed in this 
direction. We have a good people resid- 
ing in that stake of Zion, and I am as- 
sured that they are desirous of serving 
the Lord and keeping his command- 
ments. 

The keynote given us by President 
Smith at the opening of the conference, 
I feel is the word of the Lord unto this 
people; for I cannot conceive of any- 
thing so harmful and damaging to th» 
Latter-day Saints as debt. I have no- 
ticed that it not only brings trouble 
and affliction upon those who practise 
this, but upon others as well. It is 
written that the little foxes spoil the 
vine. Some of our people having gone 



into debt, and not having been strictly 
honest with their neighbor, have 
caused hard feelings, and some have 
become weak in the faith by reason of 
their brother not paying his just dues 
to them according to promise. I be- 
lieve that if the Latter-day Saints will 
listen to this counsel they will be hap- 
pier in their lives. They will be freed 
from slavery, which debt brings upon 
every man. They wil enjoy a greater 
degree of the Spirit of God when they 
are free. A number of eastern gentle- 
men once made a statement in my hear- 
ing that the "Mormons" were practi- 
cally free from debt; that they were an 
honest people, and they paid their 
debts. I hope this is true; it ought to 
be. I remember well a conversation I 
had with some gentlemen in the city of 
Boston during our trying times of a few 
years ago. They were talking about the 
conditions that existed in "Mormon- 
dom," and they said that the "Mor- 
mon" people were the most independent 
of any that lived In the United States. 
Because they had hearkened to the 
counsel of their leader, President Brig- 
ham Young, in early days, they had 
their own farms, and they placed no 
mortgage upon them. Of course, statis- 
tics show that there is only a small pro- 
portion of the homes of the Saints mort- 
gaged; but there are too many. It 
would bring greater happiness if there 
were none. 

I pray that God will bless us in our 
coming together, that we may hearken 
unto the counsels we have heard, and 
put them into practise, is my prayer in 
the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER THOMAS A. WADDOUPS. 
(President of the Iosepa Hawaiian 
Colony.) 

My brethren and sisters, in reporting 
the condition of the Hawaiian colony 
at Iosepa, I will first tell you where it 
is located. It is in Tooele county, in 
what is known as Skull valley, about 
70 miles from this city. We have or- 
ganized there a Sunday school, Mutual 
Improvement Association and Relief 
Society, all presided over by brethren 
and sisters belonging to the Hawaiian 
colony. These organizations are in good 
r unning order, and the people generally 



62 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



feel like pressing on in the work of the 
Lord. The Hawaiians there are a God- 
fearing people, and are faithful. If I 
were sick, I would not go by them for 
anyone to administer to me, because 
I think they can get as near to our 
Heavenly Father by their childlike 
faith as can any of the white people. 
The temporal and spiritual interests of 
the Hawaiian colony are very closely 
connected. The people are hired to 
work on the place, and are paid wages 
for the same. We are getting along 
all right, and have nothing to complain 
of. By the help of the Lord we intend 
to do our duty. I pray God to bless us 
all, in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER JOSEPH W. McMURRIN. 

Comparative freedom from saloons— People known 
by their fruits— Progress of the Church means 
^nod to all — Many leaders among the Saints — 
Fulfillment of Prophecy. 

I confess, my brethren and sisters, 
that I have had a little feeling of un- 
easiness in all of the meetings of this 
conference, that feeling having been 
produced by the announcement made in 
the opening remarks of President Jo- 
seph P. Smith, that among others who 
would probably Be called upon to ad- 
dress the people at this conference 
would be the members of the First 
Council of Seventy. Nevertheless, I 
have enjoyed the conference, and have 
been deeply impressed with the testi- 
monies that have been borne by the 
various brethren who have occupied 
this position. 

I feel that, some remarkable things 
have been brought to the attention of 
the people who have been gathered to- 
gether in the reports which have been 
given by the various presidents of the 
stakes of Zion. I believe one of the 
brethren reported that in the com- 
munity over which he presided, in Ari- 
zona, there was not a saloon to be 
found in any of the settlements of the 
Saints within the borders of that stake. 
That was followed by the report of an- 
other president of stake from the south- 
ern part of this state, in which the 
same declaration was made, that there 
were no saloons in his stake, though 
one man had gone over the line into 
Arizona and there pitched a tent, where 
he dispensed intoxicating liquors. An- 



other stake president reported that in 
a very populous stake in this county 
there were but three wards in which 
there were saloons; and I believe he 
could have reported that one of those 
wards was organized in a mining camp, 
and that another ward was organized in 
a town where there ail smelters ; Still 
another stake president reported that 
in one of the Cache Valley stakes, 
where there was a population of 7,500 
people, and where there were ten towns, 
there were but two saloons. 

I regard these as remarkable state- 
ments. I do not know whether this can 
be duplicated in any part of the world 
or not ;but so far as my own experi- 
ences go in traveling quite extensively 
among the peoples of the old world, I 
feel perfectly safe in saying that such 
a condition could not be found in any 
community of the old world. With the 
communities of the world the saloon 
seems to be almost as necessary, gen- 
erally speaking, as do churches or busi- 
ness houses. I believe the conditions 
mentioned in the reports to which I 
have alluded are peculiar to this peo- 
ple, and cannot be found in any other 
communities. 

While listening to these reports there 
kept ringing in my ears the saying of 
the Savior: "Ye shall know them by 
their fruits. Do men gather grapes of 
thorns, or figs of thistles? Even so 
every good tree bringeth good fruit; 
but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil 
fruit. * * * Wherefore by their fruits 
ye shall know them." And these are 
some of the fruits that have been pro- 
duced by the preaching of the Gospel 
of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the 
gathering together of the people of the 
earth whose ears have been saluted 
with the glad message of the Gospel. 
They have been gathered according to 
the promises of the prophets of old, 
from the east and from the west, from 
the north and from the south, and have 
come to these mountain valleys, where 
they have been given pastors after God's 
own heart, who have fed them with 
knowledge and with understanding. 
There need not be any concewi in the 
minds of men concerning the growth of 
the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints. We sometimes discover 
that men in high places become fearful 



ELDER JOS. W. M'MUEEIN.

because of the development of the work 
of the Lord and because of the fact that 
"Utah is becoming too small for the peo- 
ple of the Lord, and they have broken 
over the boundaries of our state and 
spread out on the north and on the 
south, on the east and on the west, and 
they are building towns and cities in 
many of the states of this American 
nation. I wonder what harm would 
come to the people of the United 
States; what harm would come to 
people In other lands, if there 
were populous communities of Lat- 
ter-day Saints there, and if the 
chief men among them could 
stand up and say that in towns where 
hundreds and thousands of people re- 
side such a thing as a saloon, or a 
house of ill fame, was unknown. What 
injury would come to the peoples of the 
earth by the introduction of the Gospel, 
and if by paying attention to the coun- 
sels that have been given by the chief 
men of Israel a condition of this char- 
acter could be produced in all the 
states of the United States and in all 
the cities and towns that have been 
built by the children of men upon the 
face of the whole earth - ? And this 
would be the condition if the people 
were converted to the principles of the 
everlasting Gospel as they have been 
revealed through the Prophet Joseph 
Smith; for sobriety is one of the foun- 
dation principles of the Gospel as 
taught by the modern prophet. We do 
not require temperance societies; we 
do not require extraordinary pledges, to 
cause us to be temperate. If we have 
been converted to the Gospel of the Son 
of God, that makes us temperate. There 
is more power and force in the ever- 
lasting Gospel, there is a greater influ- 
ence to persuade men to do right and 
to refrain from doing evil than can be 
found in any organization that has ever 
been effected in the midst of the chil- 
dren of men. The power of the Spirit 
of the Lord, the power that comes 
through obedience to the things of God, 
and that enables men to plant their 
feet in the right path to such an extent 
that they cannot be turned either to 
the right or to the left, is superior to all 
other forces or agencies. 

I rejoiced in listening to another tes- 
timony that was borne — that twenty 



years ago a few people went up into 
the state of Idaho and pitched their 
tents on a great sagebrush flat, and that 
now there are twenty thousand .people 
there who have good comfortable 
homes, who have conquered the desert, 
and who have made it to bud and bloom 
as the rose, according to the predictions 
of the prophets. This president, in re- 
porting his stake, made the statement 
that there are homes for twenty thou- 
sand people, and that an area of coun- 
try seventy miles square had been sub- 
dued by the faith, the labor and the 
energy of the colonizers of the Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 

From afar the Lord God of heaven 
has gathered His people, and as a result 
of obedience to the precious truths that 
have been revealed from our Father in 
heaven to men they have been brought 
unto this mountain country, and been 
made free men. They have been taught 
how to conquer the soil, how to subdue 
this arid country. They have been 
taught by good and wise men, who 
have been filled with the inspiration of 
the Lord, how to bring to pass and ful- 
fils the sayings of the prophets, and to 
make the dry ground glorious, and to 
cause by their faith that springs of liv- 
ing water should burst forth in dry 
places, that the soil might produce in 
its strength for the sustenance and 
blessing of the people. And these things 
are the direct result of "Mormonism." 
They have been brought to pass among 
the children of men through obedience 
to the principles that were revealed to 
the Prophet Joseph Smith, and that 
were taught by President Brigham 
Young and by all the presidents and 
chief men of Israel, who have builded 
to the pattern that was given long 
years ago by the inspiration of the 
Lord through the great prophet, Joseph 
Smith. 

I wondered also, while listening to the 
testimonies of these presidents of 
stakes, many of whom have come from 
remote places and are perhaps scarcely 
known to the great majority of the peo- 
ple, what comfort the enemies of Israel 
could find in the spectacle that has been 
presented in the reports that have been 
made by these men. It is stated, you 
know, among our enemies, that a few 
men of intelligence preside over us, and 



GENERAL, CONFERENCE. 



the rest are in bondage and serfdom; 
that the people are under the hands of 
a few astute men, who have banded 
themselves together that they may keep 
the Mormon people under control and in 
a species of bondage. I could not help 
but ask myself the question, What can 
the people think who are not of 
us, and who have been led to believe 
this statement that has gone out, 
when they see standing up in this 
great congregation men who are as 
deeply impressed with the truth of 
the everlasting Gospel as are the Apos- 
tles who preside over them; men who 
comprehend the truth, who love the 
truth, and who have dedicated them- 
selves and their talents to the upbuild- 
ing of the work of the Lord. I wondered 
if it was possible for the enemies of the 
Latter-day Saints to glean any comfort 
from these men, whom they have sup- 
posed were serfs in the midst of this 
people. Blind indeed are we if we are 
not able to discern the glorious fact 
that these men are free, that they have 
been converted to the Gospel, that they 
comprehend its truth, and that they are 
determined with the help of the Lord 
and the inspiration of His Holy 
Spirit to carry on this work in the stakes 
of Zion, to keep their hands to the plow 
and to carry out the purposes of the 
Lord, and that they are not men that 
can be easily turned aside. I think it 
has been made evident that they are 
men of character, of strong beliefs, and 
that they will not be turned either to 
the right hand or to the left, but that 
they will press steadily on in the ac- 
complishment of the purposes of the 
Lord. 

Our condition today, my brethren and 
sisters, is but a fulfilment of the prom- 
ise that has been made unto us by our 
Father in heaven through the mouth of 
the Prophet Joseph; for the Prophet 
declared a long time ago that these 
very things which we witness at the 
present time were to come to pass, and 
I desire to read to you a word or two 
concerning this promise that our Father 
made in the very inception of this work 
in reference to the future of the work 
and the men who were to be called 
from time to time to represent Him in 
the preaching of the Gospel among the 
Inhabitants of the earth. The Lord 
said: 



"And the voice of warning shall be 
unto all people, by the mouths of my 
disciples, whom I have chosen in these 
last days. ' 1 

'And they shall go forth and none 
shall stay them, for I the Lord have 
commanded them." 

My heart swells within me with inex- 
pressible joy when I think of the won- 
derful fulfilment of the promise of the 
Lord made almost before there was any 
Church; when the Prophet Joseph 
Smith, like his Master before him, stood 
alone in the world.despised and hated of 
men, laughed at by the people, yet with 
the promise given him of the Lord that 
the servants who were to be called in 
these last days should go forth and that 
none should stay them. The period of 
laughing at the statements of the 
Prophet of God is past forever. The 
mighty hosts of Israel who stand up in 
evidence of the truth and of the inspira- 
tion of His words are of such a power 
that they cannot be laughed out of ex- 
istence. The Lord God has accom- 
plished thus far the work that He 
promised He would accomplish by the 
mouth of His Prophet, and He has giv- 
en a reason for the preaching of this 
Gospel and for the calling of the Proph- 
et Joseph Smith: 

"Wherefore I the Lord, knowing the 
calamity which should come upon the 
inhabitants of the earth, called upon 
my servant Joseph Smith, Jr., and 
spake unto him from heaven, and gave 
him commandments; 

"And also gave commandments to 
others, that they should proclaim these 
things unto the world; and all this that 
it might be fulfilled, which was written 
by the prophets." 

In compassion for His sons and 
daughters He called upon His servant 
Joseph and others, that the threatened 
calamity might be averted, that the 
destruction which was coming upon the 
earth because of the transgression of 
law and the breaking of the ordinances 
might be turned away, and that the 
people might be saved through the 
everlasting Gospel. Because of His 
love for the children of men He called 
His servants and gave them command- 
ments, clothed them with the authority 
of the holy Priesthood, and sent them 
forth with a message of glad tidings. 
The result has been that we have these 
communities — sober, industrious, God- 
fearing communities — communities that

have attracted the attention of the 
■world by their labors and success. The 
fruits of their labors bear witness that 
the source from 'which they have drawn 
their inspiration is a good source. 

God help us .to be true to this work, 
which has done so much for us. I heard 
a brother say not long ago that the 
Gospel had done more for him than he 
had ever done for the Gospel; and I 
think if we will look into our own 
hearts every man and woman in Israel 
will feel to say: The Gospel has done 
everything for me; God help me and my 
children after me, from generation to 
generation, to be true to It; for it is the 
power of God unto salvation. This is 
my testimojiy, in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 

The choir and congregation sang the 
hymn which begins: 

Come, come ye Saints; 

No toil nor labor fear, 
But, with joy, wend your way.

Smith.

Importance of Manual training for the Ynulh — How 
to gain freedom fmm debt. 

I am very thankful for the privilege 
of attending this conference, and to see 
the interest manifested by the Saints 
in their presence at the meetings. We 
have certainly had an excellent time, a 
grand conference so far; and the policy 
of hearing from the presidents of the 
stakes and the missions abroad is one 
that I believe meets with the hearty 



approval of all the Saints. The Saints 
in the outlying districts feel that they 
are remembered, that they are recog- 
nized, and reported by those who have 
immediate charge of the various fields 
of labor. The results, I am sure, will 
be good, and the Saints will be satis- 
fied. 

The opening remarks of our president 
gave us some texts to talk upon, not 
only here, but when we go home. I 
think they should not be lost sight of 
by the brethren from the various parts 
of the Church. The subject of training 
our sons and daughters in principles of 
usefulness deserves our attention. 
While some of the brethren were talk- 
ing about it, especially Supt. Tanner, 
I thought it would be almost impossi- 
ble to teach all our boys in technical 
schools, if they were established. But 
there is opportunity to teach them 
trades if they do not have the advan- 
tages of a technical school. When they 
are taught trades as they are in the old 
world they become very thorough- 
more so, I think, than they would in a 
technical school, unless they followed it 
until graduation. To my mind, this is 
an important subject, because we have 
so many young men and young women 
that need to be taught. We find that if 
we want to employ a mechanic it is 
difficult to get one that has been raised 
in our midst. Of course, there are a 
few scattered up and down the coun- 
try; but it is difficult to secure skilled 
labor from among our own people. 
Now, we are just beginning to build up 
this country. Look back on Salt Lake 
City fifty years, and you will see that 
a vast improvement has been made in 
that time; but look forward fifty years, 
and what will you see? We need arti- 
sans. Our boys should learn trades. 
The Bishops and presidents of stakes 
should take this matter in hand. I 
knew a Bishop once who ran across five 
young men that came from the old 
country. They went to the Bishop to 
know what to do, and he told them to 
each learn a trade, and he assigned 
them different trades. They did not feel 
very well satisfied about it; they 
thought they could do something else 
to more profit, that would bring them 
in something at once; but they were 
finally persuaded to learn * trade, and 
they stayed with their employers until

GENERAL, CONFERENCE. 



they were skilled workmen. Every one 
of them today is in comfortable circum- 
stances, having had employment from 
that time till now. There is no need of 
our boys going off to Montana, or out of 
the country, to fine employment; for 
there is plenty here. Teach our boys 
trades, is the thing to do. We must not 
forget this when we go home, because 
we have many young throughout the 
country who need some encouragement 
in this regard. It is the word of the 
Lord to the people, and we can all read- 
ily see the necessity for it. 

Another text given was in regard to 
not going in debt. Perhaps some of us 
are in debt, with our homes mortgaged. 
It is a bad thing, but it >s done. Now, 
do not do it any more. Lift your mort- 
gages and obligations the very first op- 
portunity, and be free. 

I want to bear testimony to another 
thing that was said, because I know it 
is true from experience, and that is, 
that the easiest and shortest way to 
get out of debt is to first pay our tith- 
ing, promptly and honestly, and then 
the promise of the Lord is that the way 
shall be opened up, and we will be 
able to liquidate our obligations. Be 
patient -in the matter. Remember 
the Lord first, and then turn our 
attention to our creditors. Pay 
them just as fast as we can; 
but do not go in debt any 
more. Let our families live within 
their income. If you get $3 or $5 a day, 
live on considerably less than that. I 
knew a young couple that started out 
in life, and the man worked for $20 a 
month and the wife worked for $2 a 
week. They were hired out when they 
were married, because they hadn't any- 
thing else to do. How much did they 
save out of that? I took pains to in- 
quire into the matter and I learned 
that they saved $12 a month. When 
they quit that work and went to house- 
keeping they had considerable means on 
hand, with which they bought what 
they needed. People think that cannot 
be done. Why, I knew that two peo- 
ple can live on $10. a month, because I 
have watched this thing for many 
years. We have high ideas about every- 
thing now. The young people must have 
everything that their fathers and moth- 
ers have. The first thing, they must 
have a house, well furnished, before 



they can get married. I do not think 
that is a good idea. My experience has 
taught me otherwise. Get married, 
young people. It is the duty of all who 
are of marriageable age, to get mar- 
ried. And get married in the Temple. 
Then work together, put up with cir- 
cumstances as they are, and improve 
them as fast as you can. But do not go 
in debt. Do not go beyond your means 
to buy fine furniture. Better live in a 
cabin. 

These are practical things, which 
should be of interest to our people. We 
do not want our young men and young 
women to float around; we want thera 
to stay with the Saints. We want them 
to build up Zion wherever they are lo- 
cated. When they are called, then is the 
time to go — not before. Do not run up 
and down the country to improve your 
condition, unless you can go by the 
counsel of the Priesthood. Use economy 
and live within your means. Teach 
the boys trades. Be a wise and a con- 
siderate people. Seek for the Spirit of 
the Lord to guide us. Seek for the 
counsel of the brethren who preside. 
There are men appointed of the Lord 
throughout the land to counsel and ad- 
vise with the people. Go to them for 
counsel; advise with them, and you will 
go about right. But when we under- 
take to go on our own hook, we are 
pretty sure to get off wrong. 

May the Lord bless and inspire the 
Saints to carry out the counsel given. 
May we make our lives useful and hon- 
orable in the earth. I bear you my tes- 
timony that this work is true. It is 
from God. I testify that Joseph Smith 
was a great Prophet of God, raised up 
in our day and time to usher in the 
Gospel dispensation. Thousands of peo- 
ple have 'had this evidence and testi- 
mony, and we know the work is true. 
It is not our work; it is not the work 
of the Presidency of the Church; it is 
God's work, and He has placed these 
men to direct the affairs of the work, 
and let us give heed to their counsel. 
God bless you. Amen. 

ELDER ALBERT R. SMITH, 
(President of San Luis Stake.) 

I appreciate very much the instruc- 
tions we have received so far during 
this Conference, and especially the 



ELDER EDWARD H. SNOW. 



spirit that has characterized the utter- 
ances of the brethren. 

Representing 1 the San Luis Stake of 
Zion, I feel to say that we are a long 
way from the headquarters of the 
Church, a small stake located in the 
central southern part of Colorado, and 
bordering on to New Mexico, two or 
three branches of the Stake being in 
New Mexico. This Stake has been or- 
ganized about twenty years. Prior to 
that time a colony had been planted 
there under the direction of the leaders 
of the Church, a few people being called 
to go there from Utah. Many people 
from the Southern States emigrated to 
that land, and we should by this time 
have quite a populous Stake had all 
remained who gathered there; but 
many who came from the Southern 
States found the climate too rigorous 
for them, and they scattered into other 
Stakes or returned to their former 
homes. We have now four wards and 
three branches in the Stake, and they 
are so scattered that it requires trav- 
eling six hundred miles in order to 
reach them all. We have been very 
kindly treated by the people of the 
state of Colorado. The lands upon 
which we have located have been al- 
most entirely state lands, which we 
have purchased from the state. We 
have been encouraged in that land by 
the officials, and we have no complaints 
to make. In fact, when there were 
perilous times for the Saints in this 
State and in other localities, the nu- 
cleus formed in the San Luis valley 
was like a house of refuge to many 
who were being persecuted, and who 
for the time being found peace and rest 
there. Our people have not made very 
great progress financially. Our country 
is perhaps not so much favored as some 
other localities. We live in a high alti- 
tude, and it is rather cold; yet we pro- 
duce grains that bear equally to almost 
any other place. It is a well watered 
country usually. Last season was an 
exception, we being affected by the 
general drouth that prevailed; but we 
have splendid prospects now for the 
raising of grain and stock. Many of 
the people who have gathered there 
have been like children in the Gospel, 
and it has required a great deal of pa- 
tient labor to get them to understand 



and live up to their duties. Our people 
have made rapid advancement in obey- 
ing the law of tithing, considering their 
lack of understanding in the beginning. 
Those who bear the holy Priesthood are 
united, and are laboring for the ad- 
vancement of the cause of God. We are 
united with one another, and with the 
counsels and' instructions of the lead- 
ers of the Church. We And it difficult 
to disseminate the teachings of the 
Conference in that Stake. Very few 
representatives are able to come this 
long distance to Conference, on account 
of the comparative poverty of the 
people; but those who do come, when 
they return they try to spread the 
teachings and spirit of the Conference. 
At our next monthly gathering of the 
Priesthood there will be two meetings 
held, and the officers of every depart- 
ment in the Stake will be instructed by 
the representatives here. In this way 
we expect to disseminate the teachings 
of the Conference. 

I am grateful to be engaged in the 
work of God. I feel that it does not 
matter so much where we labor if we 
are willing to labor where God appoints 
us. He will see to it that we are pro- 
vided for, and that we and our poster- 
ity are led in the ways of righteous- 
ness. Although we may not find such 
pleasant places as others in this life, 
we will obtain eternal life. I have an 
abiding faith and testimony in the 
work of God, and I feel in my heart to 
say, His name be praised that He has 
given you and me a knowledge that sur- 
passeth understanding, a divine testi- 
mony that we are engaged in His 
work; and whatever may come to us, 
having this knowledge and this per- 
fect assurance, we will indeed be happy. 
That God may bless the Saints every- 
where, and bless us to accomplish the 
mission He has assigned unto us in 
preaching the Gospel and in building 
up the Stakes of Zion, and rearing our 
children in the fear of God, is my 
prayer in the name of Jesus. Amen.

ren and sisters, in reporting the St.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



George Stake of Zion, over which, with 
Thomas P. Cottam and George F. 
Whitehead as my counselors, I have the 
honor to preside. This stake of Zion 
includes Washington county, in "the 
southwestern part of this state, and all 
the settlements of the Church in the 
state of Nevada. There are twenty- 
two wards and nine branches, and a 
population of about 5,600, stretching 
over a large area of territory, and re- 
quiring a little over a thousand miles 
of travel for us to reach them all. The 
stake presidency visit all of the wards 
in Washington county once every quar- 
ter, and the settlements in Nevada 
twice a year. We are united as a 
Stake presidency, and hold our council 
meetings once a week. We are also 
united with our High Council, and with 
them hold council meeting on the first 
Saturday in the month, and a prayer 
circle the last Sunday in each month. 
We have the usual High Priests' quo- 
rum, three quorums of Seventy and five 
quorums of Elders in the stake. We 
have a most excellent people; in fact, 
I beilieve we have the best pople there 
are in the Church. It is an old stake. 
Many illustrious men have lived there 
— men who have been marked by rea- 
son of their integrity and service in the 
Church of God. Many presidents of 
stakes and of missions have been called 
from this stake.. At present I call to 
mind that there are fifteen brethren 
presiding over stakes in Zion and mis- 
sions abroad who were born and reared 
in this stake. 

I want to endorse what has been said 
by President Smith in relation to debt 
and diversity of industry. We believe 
that in our stake. There are not per- 
haps more than half a dozen mort- 
gages of any kind on record in our 
county. We are trying to get upon 
a cash basis, and pay as we go. I 
firmly believe that there ought to be a 
greater diversity of industries among 
us. State builders must have a diver- 
sity of industry; and if the word of 
President Smith needed any corrobora- 
tion among us as a people, I might call 
your attention to the fact that all the 
great educators of our land, those who 
think and reflect and are above the 
strife and influence of the commercial 
spirit, unite today in defining the word 



"education" as the power and ability 
to do some useful thing. 

May God impress the teachings of 
this conference upon our hearts and 
minds, that they may bear fruit in our 
lives, in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER GEORGE OSMOND 
(President of Star Valley Stake). 

My brethren and sisters, I feel it to 
be quite a privilege as well as a duty 
to stand before this large audience and 
report briefly the Star Valley Stake of 
Zion, in which I and my counselors 
have the responsibility of presiding. It 
is a small stake, comparatively speak- 
ing, in the western part of the state of 
Wyoming, and formerly formed part of 
the Bear Lake Stake. It was organ- 
ized as a separate stake in August, 1892. 
Since that time there has been consid- 
erable of an increase in its population, 
although, being outside, as it were, of 
the Church generally, our population 
has been a floating one. It consists of 
two small valleys, containing an area 
of probably 150 square miles of habit- 
able land. We have nine wards com- 
pletely organized. Thus far I can 
speak with confidence as to the stake. 
I can also tell you that our population 
is about 2,300. But when you come to 
more minute particulars in relation to 
our condition, I feel to be truthful and 
represent us as we really are. I think, 
though, that we average pretty well 
with the other stakes of Zion, and I 
am led to believe this from the fact 
that when we are called upon to do 
anything, we come as near doing it as 
probably other stakes do. Hence I 
think we average up with other stakes 
in paying tithing and in other respects. 
Still, as. has been remarked of other 
stakes, there is great room for im- 
provement. If there were not, there 
would be nothing for the Priesthood to 
do. We are not perfect, but we are 
headed in that direction. My brethren 
and I are laboring to set an example 
to the people, that we may say, Follow 
us as we follow those who preside over 
us. A great deal that has. been said 
in relation to other stakes would apply 
to ours. We have different classes of 
people, as you have. I think we will 
have candidates for every degree of

glory. But I do believe that the great 
bulk of the people are trying earnestly 
and honestly to serve the Lord and to 
keep His commandments. As a rule, 
the people are aiming to do right; but 
sometimes they are poor marksmen and 
miss the mark. We have in course of 
erection a large tabernacle, so that it 
will be sufficient to hold all the people 
who may come to conference. This is 
a great need with us at the present 
time. My counselors are united with 
me. The Priesthood generally are 
united, and trying to set an example 
to the rest of the people, that we may 
not only say, "Do as we tell you," but 
"Do as we do." 

May the Lord help us all to improve, 
that our reports from year to year may 
show an improvement, not only in our 
particular stakes, but in all the Church. 
I ask this blessing upon us and upon 
our labors, in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 

ELDER ANDREW JENSON. 

My beloved brethren, sisters and 
friends. Eleven months ago I left this 
beautiful city to take a special mission 
to Europe. I spent about six months in 
the city of Copenhagen, Denmark, en- 
gaged in literary labors, helping to pub- 
lish a new edition of the Book of Mor- 
mon in the Danish-Norwegian lang- 
uage, it being the fourth edition of that 
book to be published in that language. 
After completing that labor, it became 
my privilege and duty to travel some- 
what extensively throughout the Brit- 
ish Isles, Holland, Germany, Denmark, 
Sweden and Norway, in the interest of 
Church history, and also in visiting 
the different branches and conferences 
as they are organized in these differ- 
ent countries. 

I desire on this occasion, as I have 
just returned home, to bring a hearty 
greeting from the brethren and sisters 
over on the other side of the waters. We 
nave some very faithful Saints in Eu- 
rope. We have preached the Gospel in 
the British Isles since 1837. We have 
preached the Gospel in Germany since 
3S51, in Scandinavian countries since 
1850. Thousands of Latter-day Saints 
have emigrated to these lands, and 



there are thousands of faithful Latter- 
day Saints living there at the present • 
time, who, like us, are praying for the 
welfare of Zion, and who are listening 
to the voice of inspiration, though not 
altogether as we do.. They haVe to be 
content, to a certain extent, with the 
written word. It is true, once in awhile 
one of the Twelve Apostles and others 
visit those lands; but the most they get 
of the words of our leaders is through 
the written word. But they read this 
written word. The proceedings of this 
conference will be translated to some 
extent into the German, the Dutch, the 
Swedish and the Danish-Norwegian 
languages, and thus the people on that 
side of the ocean will derive some bene- 
fit from what is being done here. 

I rejoice to have the privilege to re- 
turn to you just in time to attend this 
conference; and while I am on my feet 
I desire to bring you a hearty greeting 
from President Francis M. Lyman, one 
of the Twelve Apostles, who at the 
present time presides over the Euro- 
pean mission. The brethren and sisters 
over there respect him as a man of 
God, as he really is. He is a father 
in every sense of that word to the 
brethren who are laboring under his 
direction, and to the Saints whom he 
visits from time to time. Last July 
we had the pleasure of having him with 
us in Copenhagen, Denmark, on the oc- 
casion of dedicating the most beautiful 
house that has ever been built by the 
Latter-day Saints in Europe. It has a 
hall with a seating capacity of 600. 
We are just erecting a beautiful build- 
ing in the city of Christiania, Norway: 
and we are taking steps to erect an- 
other beauiful building in the city of 
Stockholm, Sweden. We repoice in the 
fact that the Lord is pouring out Hi.-? 
Spirit upon His people in those lands, 
and I am a living witness and want to 
bear testimony to the fact that I know 
God is no respector of persons. It 
does not make any difference where we 
are born, nor the language we speak. 
The Lord can be found upon the islands 
of the sea.upon the continent of Europe, 
and the continents of Africa and Asia, 
where I have had the privilege of visit- 
ing, as well as upon this land of Amer- 
ica. If we seek God, His blessings will

• follow us. If we obey the principles of 
the Gospel, it matters not where we do 
it, we will receive the same blessings. 
The Lord pours out His Spirit upon us, 
no matter where we are. Many are the 
wonderful testimonies that I have list- 
ened to during my late visit to Europe. 
When people have spoken even in for- 
eign tongues, unknown to the majority 
of the people here, the Spirit of God 
has been poured out upon the speakers; 
and when they have defended the char- 
acter of the Prophet Joseph Smith I 
have seen the power of God manifested 
in a manner that has made an impres- 
sion upon me which I shall never for- 
get. 

I am glad to come home to these 
mountains. I have been from here a 
number of times on missions. I do not 
know but I have been more blessed on 
this short special mission than I have 
on any of my former missions; at least, 
I have been blessed to as great an ex- 
tent.I come homie to youfeeling thankful 
for the experience. I am thankful to God 
my Heavenly Father that He has in- 
deed revealed himself in these the last 
clays and has restored the fullness of 
His Gospel. I thank God for my home 
in these mountains, and I do not know 
that I ever returned to Salt Lake City 
from a foreign mission when I rejoiced 
sc much in the fact of coming back 
home as I did on this occasion. There 
were reasons for this. We did not have 
a very pleasant journey home. We had 
sadness on the road. We lost two of 
our little company of Saints — something 
that has not happened for many years. 
Yet in this I see the hand of God. I 
know His will has been done in the 
matter, as it is continually being done 
wherever His sons and daughters put 
their trust in Him. 

I ask God to bless us as a people. 
This has indeed been a beautiful con- 
ference; at least, it has been so to me: 
and I hope that the spirit of this con- 
ference will go from here to all parts of 
the world, not only to the different 
stakes of Zion, but to the uttermost 
parts of the world where our brethren 
are laboring as dispensers of truth to a 
fallen world. God bless us all. I ask it 
in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

I would have preferred, as a matter of 
fact, to have listened to a continuation 
of the testimonies and reports of the 
presidents of stakes and of missions. 
Nevertheless, I feel happy in the priv- 
ilege of standing in your presence upon 
this occasion, and I desire to say to 
you that President Brigham Young 
sends greeting to the Latter-day Saints, 
and thanks you for your faith and 
prayers in his behalf. He is in a criti- 
cal condition, but with good faith, and 
determined, if possible, to make a live 
of it and accomplish much work in the 
future. I desire to report that the 
Presidency of the Church are in the en- 
joyment of the spirit of their calling 
and in unison in their work; and to say 
of the Council of the Apostles that each 
one of them is anxious to perform his 
part and discharge the obligations rest- 
ing upon him to the best of his ability. 
The good feelings and wishes of Elder 
Lyman have been given to you by our 
brother who has just returned from 
that field. Brother Grant also joins in 
greetings to the Latter-day Saints and 
rejoices in their growth and develop- 
ment and in the good spirit of union 
that is manifest among the people. He 
is anxious to extend the work in that 
land as fast and as far as it may be 
practicable. I desire to say further that 
the Patriarch of the Church is in uni- 
son with the Presidency of the Church 
and the Council of the Apostles. The 
presidents of the Seventies, as you have 
heard from them, are in like spirit and 
action with their brethren. I believe the 
same is true of the Presiding Bishopric 
of the Church. The general authorities 
of the Church are fully in attune with 
each other in connection with the work 
that is assigned them to do. I know of 
no time in my connection with the work 
of the Almighty when the general au- 
thorities of the Church were more in 
unison and with a higher regard and 
love for one another than they possess 
today. 

I trust that the words that have 
been spoken and the reports 
that have been made will write them-

selves upon the hearts of the Latter- 
day Saints. It is necessary that we 
unite ourselves together in the accom- 
plishment of every spiritual and tem- 
poral work that the Lord may set us 
to do. Every stake of Zion should be 
uniting its interests and seeking to pro- 
vide, so far as within its power, a 
variety of employment essential to the 
development of that section. The peo- 
ple should be striving to thus unite 
their efforts and accomplish the pur- 
poses of the Almighty. I believe in 
combinations of capital, I believe in 
combinations of labor, so long as those 
combinations shall not presume to in- 
terfere with the rights and liberties of 
their fellowmen. But when they pre- 
sume to exercise unrighteous dominion 
and their efforts are in the direction of 
harm to their fellows, I am opposed to 
them, one and all. I trust that the 
spirit of the instructions given during 
this conference has found lodgment in 
every one of your hearts, that you have 
determined to do the bidding of the 
Master, to guard your own liberties, to 
preserve the liberties of your fellow- 
men; that you propose to carry with 
you the spirit of the words that fell 
from the lips of President Winder this 
morning, that having been made par- 
takers of the heavenly gift of entering 
the sacred precincts of the house of 
God, the covenants you have made 
there to honor your fathers, to honor 
the laws and institutions of -your coun- 
try and to maintain the rights and lib- 
erties of your fellowmen, will be sus- 
tained by you in every place and in 
every station where Providence shall 
call you to act. I trust that the senti- 
ments of your heart shall be to have 
your homes pervaded with the spirit of 
prayer; that as fathers and mothers 
you shall remember to have your chil- 
dren taught to pray, and that thought- 
lessness and disregard of these obliga- 
tions shall not come in among you. I 
trust, my brethren and sisters, that 
each sentiment expressed by our breth- 
ren will find place within you, and that 
you will be led to glorify the iiame of 
your Father in heaven; that the voice of 
of the truth, distilled upon your ears 
in your native land, shall continue to 
guard and guide every one of our lives 
in this land where we have our home, 



beneath the shades of these mountains, 
where should exist the spirit of liberty, 
the love of God, respect for right, and 
a determination to pvjrrorm our part to 
the best of our ability. 

When these brethren testify to you 
that they know that God lives, that 
Jesus is the Christ, and that the priest, 
hood of the Son of God is among the 
children of men, they testify to you a 
truth that you know yourselves. I trust 
that you seek in your ministry to so la- 
bor that the results of your lives will 
demonstrate, in the character and min- 
istry of your children and your neigh- 
bors, your absolute knowledge of the 
truth of the Gospel of the Lord Jesus 
Christ. 

My brothers and my sisters, it would 
be imprudent for me to take more time. 
Perform your part in righteousness. 
Impress upon the minds of your sons 
and daughters that no son or daughter 
of Zion need enter any other church to 
receive the ministration of the laying 
on of hands for the healing of the sick; 
that when God bestowed this Gospel 
and turned the key, He placed with it 
the power to heal the sick, to rebuke 
evil spirits, and to command evils to 
subside, and if we will live as we should 
live and instruct our children as we 
should, they will never hunt any other 
than the ministrations of the servants 
of God to be healed of their sickness or 
to have evil rebuked from their homes, 
but they will come to you for the aid 
and comfort necessavy for them in the 
midst of their distresses. This that has 
been given to us is the Gospel of the 
Lord Jesus Christ. It is the power of 
God unto salvation. Its mission and min- 
istry is the regeneration of the world, 
the establishment of righteousness, the 
cleansing and purifying of mankind; 
and if you will walk m the pathway of 
the Gospel, and fulfill the requirements 
thereof, no man can complain of your 
morality; no man can find fault with 
your temperance; no man can censure 
the spirit of justice, charity and mercy 
that shall guide you in your lives. God 
Himself introduced His word in this 
day and age of the world. He introduc- 
ed His Son to the children of men. He 
pointed the way of life to all His sons 
and daughters, and has set you upon 
the road to aid in the regeneration of

the world and in the establishment of 
righteousness. May He bless you for- 
ever. May you be obedient to the truth. 
May you do the bidding of the Master. 
This is my prayer, in the name of Jesus. 
Amen.

PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 

Satisfactory character of reports— What is expected 
of the priesthood— Glorious destiny of American 
Nation - The Church its strong supporter , — Cha- 
racters of those who misrepresent this commun- 
ity—Saloons and their Keepers— The honorable 
do not assail the people of God- 
Brethren and sisters; I have been 
delighted, beyond my power to express, 
with the spirit of this conference, with 
the spirit of those who have spoken 
to us, with the subjects that they have 
dwelt upon, and with the reports which 
they have made to us in general con- 
ference assembled. I believe that, in 
the policy we have pursued, we are car- 
rying out, in a measure at least, the 
original design and purpose in the Lord 
of holding these annual and semi-an- 
nual conferences. The Lord made it 
obligatory in former days that con- 
ferences should be held frequently, and 



ELDER RULON S. WELLS.

that representatives from all the vari- 
ous branches and organized bodies of 
the Church should he present, with 
power and authority to report their 
condition and standing and to speak 
of any matter that would affect the 
welfare and prosperity of the people 
thej r represented. There is another 
purpose, I think, subserved in the 
policy that we have pursued, which I 
consider a worthy one, and .that is 
this: We want the people to under- 
stand, and we would like the world to 
understand, the great fact that it is 
not the prominent leaders of the Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints 
that wield all the influence among the 
people of this Church. We want it 
understood that we have fewer lay- 
in embers in this Church, in proportion 
to the number of our membership, than 
you will find in any other church upon 
the globe. Nearly every man in the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints holds the Melchisedek or the 
Aaronic Priesthood, and may act in an 
official capacity by authority of that 
priesthood whenever called upon to do 
so. They are priests and kings, if you 
please, unto God in righteousness. Out 
of this vast body of priests we call and 
ordain or set apart our Presidents of 
Stakes, our counselors, our High 
Councilors, our Bishops and their coun- 
selors, our Seventies, our High Priests, 
and our Elders, upon whom rests the 
responsibility of proclaiming the Gos- 
pel of eternal truth to all the world, and 
upon whom also rests the great and 
glorious responsibility of maintaining 
the dignity, the honor and the sacred- 
ness of that calling and Priesthood. So 
that nearly every male person in the 
Church, who has reached the years of 
accountability, is supposed to be, in his 
sphere, a pillar in Zion, a defender of 
the faith, an exemplar, a man of righte- 
ous ness, truth and soberness, a man of 
virtue and of honor, a good citizen of 
the state in which he lives, and a 
staunch and loyal citizen of the great 
country that we are proud to call our 
home. 

This great American nation the Al- 
mighty raised up by the power of His 
omnipotent hand, that it might be possi- 
ble in the latter days for the kingdom 
of God to be established in the earth. 



If the Lord had not prepared the way 
by laying the foundations of this 
glorious nation, it would have been im- 
possible (under the stringent laws and 
bigotry of the monarchical govern- 
ments of the world) to have laid the 
foundations for the coming of His great 
kingdom. The Lord has done this. His 
hand has been over this nation, and it 
is His purpose and design to enlarge it, 
make it glorious above all others, and to 
give it dominion and power over the 
earth, to the end that those who are 
kept in bondage and serfdom may be 
brought to the enjoyment of the fullest 
freedom and liberty of conscience possi- 
ble for intelligent men to exercise in the 
earth. The Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints will be a strong sup- 
porter of the nation of which we are a 
part, in the accomplishment of this 
grand purpose. There are no more loyal 
people to their country on God's earth 
today than are the Latter-day Saints 
to this country. There are no better, 
purer or more honorable citizens of the 
United States to be found than are 
found within the pale of the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I 
testify to this, and I know whereof I 
speak. We never have been enemies 
to our nation. We have always been 
true to it. Though we have been 
persecuted, we have said, We will 
put our trust in thee. We have been 
driven and maligned, not by the nation, 
but by insidious, wicked, unprincipled, 
hypocritical, lying, deceitful goats in 
sheep's clothing, who are jealous and 
constantly raising a hue and cry against 
the covenant people of God. Our gov- 
ernment would have befriended us, pro- 
tected us, preserved our rights and lib- 
erties, and would have defended us in 
the enjoyment of our possessions, if it 
had not been for these infernal hounds 
who are enemies to morality and to 
the truth. If there is anything despic- 
able, if there be anything that can nev- 
er, no, never, enter into the kingdom of 
God, it is a wilfull liar; and if we have 
not been lied about, maligned and mis- 
represented of late, then I do not know 
what lying is. Well, let the falsifiers go 
on and lie. Some people are evidently 
doomed to lie. President Woodruff used 
to say there were some people in his 
day who were born to lie, and they were 



74 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



true to their missions. There are some 
of these born liars still with us and 
still true to their mission. They cannot, 
it would seem, tell the truth; they often 
do not when it would be for their best 
good. S let them go on and lie as much 
as they desire. But let us do right, keep 
the laws of God and the laws of man, 
honor our membership in the kingdom 
of God, our citizenship in the State of 
Utah and our broader citizenship in the 
nation of which we are a part, and then 
God will sustain and preserve us, and 
we will continue to grow as we have- 
done from the beginning, only our fu- 
ture growth will be accelerated and be 
far greater than it has been in the past. 
These slanders and falsehoods that are 
circulated abroad with the view of 
bringing the ire of the nation upon us 
will by and by be swept away, and be- 
cause of these misrepresentations the 
truth will be brought out clearer and 
plainer to the world. Thus the word of 
the Lord will be verified, that they can- 
not do anything against but for the 
kingdom of God. This is the Lord's 
work; it it not man's; and He will 
make it triumphant. He is spreading 
it abroad, and giving it deep root in the 
earth, that its branches may grow and 
spread, and its fruit be seen through- 
out the length and breadth of the land. 

By their fruits ye shall know them. 
Men do not gather grapes of thorns, nor 
figs .of thistles; neither does a bitter 
fountain send forth sweet water. We, 
as a people, deplore as much as any- 
body can the existence of evil amongst 
us. But when our brethren get up 
here and talk as some have done, "We 
have saloons; we have all the 'modern 
improvements' "—WE have them— I 
wish they would take the pains to dis- 
tinguish as to who "we" is. If they 
mean that the Latter-day Saints have 
saloons, then they are mistaken. It is 
not the Latter-day Saints that sustain 
saloons. If they are fostered and sus- 
tained in the midst of Latter-day Saint 
communities, they are sustained by men 
that are either in bad standing or have 
no standing at all in the Church. The 
most of them are sustained by men who 
do not belong to the Church. I will 
venture to say that over here in Eme- 
ry county, where we hear of saloons 
and "modern improvements," that there 



is not a saloon run by a Latter-day 
Saint. But, says one, hold on, Brother 
Smith, there is one, I believe. There 
was one, out of the many, that used to 
be run by a man who claimed to be a 
member of the Church; I don't know 
that it is now. I give it out to you, my 
brethren and sisters, that no man who 
is a Latter-day Saint, in full faith and 
fellowship in the Church,will ever keep 
a saloon anywhere. Therefore, if there 
is a man claiming to be a "Mormon" 
running a saloon anywhere, the best 
thing you can do is to cut him off the 
Church, and then you will know where 
he 1 is and who he is. He is not a 
Latter-day Saint, at all events. Now, 
when you say WE have this, and WE 
have that, I hope you will draw the 
distinction between Latter-day Saints 
and latter-day devils. 

I am not sorry I have made 
theset remarks, because it will 
give some of our "friends" a 
chance to say something, and there is 
nothing like having a little of the spice 
of life. I rejoice in the Gospel. I re- 
joice in the mission of the divine 
Savior, the Son of God. I know it is 
the power of God unto salvation. I 
rejoice in the name and in the mission 
of the Prophet Joseph Smith; for I 
know his mission is divine. I rejoice in 
the gathering of Israel in the tops of 
these mountains in the latter days, be- 
cause I see in it the hand of the Al- 
mighty, and not the hand of Brigham 
Young, nor of any mortal man. No 
man of himself could ever accomplish 
that which we see before us. The Lord 
is behind it, at the bottom and at the 
top of it, and in and through it, and 
He will consummate His purpose. The 
world cannot prevent it either, because 
it is for good, not for evil. If it were 
net. for good I would pity some of these 
poor devils that we have amongst us. 
But we will be patient, longsuffering, 
and forbearing. We will say, Let God 
judge between us and our enemies, and 
award them according to their deeds. 
We will not harm them. On the con- 
trary, we will protect them. Though 
they seek to defile us and ridicule our 
religion, though they lie about us and 
say all manner of evil against us false- 
ly, we will not hurt them. We will " 
them good, if they will let us. We 



PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 



75 



will protect them, as we would protect 
good men in their rights. We 
will do all we con to protect 
the rig-hts of mankind, and noth- 
ing to break down the liberties of 
men. This is our mission, and I pray 
God to help us to be true to our mission, 
as these poor creatures who lie about 
us are true to theirs. 

Now, when I speak as I have done 
about the lying riff-raff that infests 
our land, I do not wish it understood 
for a moment that I refer to honorable 
men. We have honorable men amongst 
us, and in this nation. God bless and 
sustain all honorable men. We will 
sustain, not only the rights and liber- 



ties of the honorable, but we will also 
defend and help to maintain to the ut- 
termost the liberties and rights of dis- 
honorable men. We have honorable 
men amongst us, and they are ever in 
the favor of the people of God. 

The choir sang: 

i 

Do what is right; the day dawn is 
breaking, 

Hailing a future of freedom and light; 
Angels above us are silent notes tak- 
ing 

Of every action; do what is right. 

Benediction was pronounced by Pre- 
siding Patriarch John Smith. 

Conference adjourned for six months. 



Deseret Sunday School Union. 



ITS ANNUAL GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



The general semi-annual conference 
of the Sunday schools of the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints con- 
vened in the Tabernacle, Salt Lake 
City, Sunday, April 5, 1903, at 7:30 p. 
m. General Superintendent Jos. F. 
Smith presiding. 

Present: of the general superintend- 
ency, Joseph F. Smith, George Reyno'.ds 
and J. M. Tanner; most of the members 
of the Deseret Sunday School Union 
board, several of the Apostles, and the 
Tabernacle was packed with officers, 
teachers, and Sunday school workers 
and Saints. 

The tabernacle choir sang the hymn: 
"Earth with her ten thousand flowers." 

Prayer was offered by Elder John W. 
Taylor. 

Messrs. Ashworth, Best, Christopher- 
son and Squires then rendered the 
quartet, "God is love." 

Secretary George D. Pyper called the 
roll of stakes, all but two being repre- 
sented, as also were the Northwestern 
states, California and Colorado mis- 
sions. The secretary also presented the 
following items gleaned from the an- 
nual report of the Sunday schools: 

Total number of schools in the organ- 
ized stakes, 749; in the missions, 291 — 
grand total, 1,040; showing a gain of 
64 schools during the year — 33 in the 
organized stakes and 31 in the mis- 
sions. 

Number of officers and teachers in the 
organized stakes, 14,333; in the mis- 
sions, 1,647 — total officers and teachers, 
15,980; a gain of 782. 

Number of pupils in organized stakes, 
107,323, of whom 52,752 are male and 
54,571 females; in the missions, 10,413, 
of whom 4,821 are males and 5,592 are 
females— grand total of pupils, 117,736; 



an increase of 3,811 — 2,818 in the stakes 
and 893 in the missions. This report 
shows there are 2,590 more girls than 
boys in the Sunday schools. 

Total officers, teachers, missionaries 
and pupils in the stakes, 121,971, in the 
missions, 12,060— grand total, 134,031; a- 
total increase of 4,399 over 1901. 

The average attendance for 1902 was 
58 per cent, the same as for the pre- 
vious year.

sented the officers of the Deseret Sun- 
day School Union, who were unani- 
mously sustained as follows: 

Joseph F. Smith, general superintend- 
ent, George Reynolds, first assistant

Since we met here, at the October 
conference, six months ago, the General 
Board of the union has had a very busy

time, for since then the "Outlines" have 
been prepared and published. We have 
already printed 41,000 copies for the 
benefit of the Sunday schools, and it 
appears as though we *shall have to 
print many more. The "Outlines," as 
has been explained to you, are intended 
to bring unity in the subjects and in 
the lessons taught in our Sunday- 
schools, that the wide world over, wher- 
ever there are schools, of the Latter- 
day Saints, there shall the same lesson 
be taug-ht on the same Sunday, thus 
unifying our efforts and giving strength 
to our teachings. The preparation of 
these "Outlines" has required a great 
deal of study, of prayer, and of work, 
but we feel confident that where ac- 
cepted, as we trust they will be, by 
our schools, that the teachers will fr 
them a great help, and one great rea- 
son is that they cannot be used suc- 
cessfully and advantageously without 
preparation, home preparation both by 
the teacher and the scholar, and it will 
consequently make the work more 
thorough and more progressive. 

The general report that has been read 
to you is, in the main, satisfactory; 
but there is one item that is some- 
what disappointing, and that is, tho 
average of increase. You will notice 
that our increase of teachers, officers 
Mid pupils is only about 4,000 for the 
entire year. This is a smaller pro rata 
increase than I remember for many a 
year. There may be many causes for 
it. but individually I believe that one of 
the chief causes is a lack of understand- 
ing on the part of some superinten- 
dents who, because certain ages have 
been suggested for the pupils in each 
department, and, to make it evident 
that the item was only suggestive it 
is printed in the "Outlines" in italics, 
yet some superintendents have en- 
deavored to reorganize their schools 
and to grade them simply on the basis 
of the age of the child. I believe this 
has resulted in scores, possibly hun- 
dreds of our children, leaving school, 
because when simply the age was taken 
into consideration the dullard and the 
bright child of the same age have been 
put into the same class, and it has 
caused a sense of annoyance and dis- 
comfort to those who felt that they 
were not being justly treated. Nc 



superintendent — and I trust the breth- 
ren will listen to what I am saying- 
no superintendent, without he expects 
to injure his school, will grade simply 
on the basis of the age of the child. 
There are other considerations that are 
more important, and that are never 
to he forgotten. But then to just sim- 
ply grade by the age is the easier way, 
and one that gives the least trouble, 
the least necessity for investigation. 
But the fact is, if we wish to do our 
children good, we must place them in 
the class or in the department where 
they will learn the most, where they 
will make the most progress, and for 
which they are best fitted. "We must 
take into consideration their aptness, 
their advancement, their desires, their 
judgment, as well as their age, when 
they are graded. 

I would say as the treasurer of the 
Union board, that I cannot make any 
definite report at this time with regard 
to the nickel donation, because as yet 
it has not all been paid to me; but I 
can say this much, that the nickel do- 
nation for last year is larger than it 
has ever been before. Nor can a com- 
plete report be made regarding th«= 
prizes offered in the Juvenile Instruc- 
tor, for the reason that we 
have not yet been able to make 
the comparisons necessary before 
some of the prizes and premiums 
can be awarded. We have published 
those premiums that have been awarded 
to the stakes for the payment of the 
nickel donation within the time speci- 
fied, but further than this we shall have 
to claim the indulgence of the Sunday 
school workers. Nor is the fault ours. 
But in a little while we expect to pub- 
lish them, and when they are published 
the books awarded will be at the dis- 
posal of those to whom they are given. 

There is one thing to which I wish to 
allude for a few moments, and that is 
the tendency, in some of our schools, to 
abridge the period of. their sessions, in- 
stead of allowing the Sunday school to 
continue the full two hours, from 10 to 
12 o'clock, or whatever hours it may be; 
that is, some of the superintendents 
shorten the session to an hour and a 
half, sometimes to an hour and a quar- 
ter. It is not desired by the board, as 
a general thing, that the kindergarten

and the primary children be Kept in the 
full two hours, because we know well 
that they will become restless and tired, 
and that they will not be in a condition 
to give attention to that which is taught 
them during the latter part of the ses- 
sion. We are always willing that the 
teachers in these departments should 
permit the children to leave when an 
hour and a half from the time of open- 
ing has elapsed. But surely, my breth- 
ren and sisters, two hours once a week 
for the religious instruction of our chil- 
dren in the Sunday school is none too 
much. It is told us sometimes that it 
is difficult to keep up the interest of 
the children for that length of time. 
But we generally find that where that 
complaint is made, the lack of interest 
is less, or the restlessness is less in the 
children than the disinclination of the 
teachers and superintendents to teach 
the full two hours. We also find that 
where difficulties of this kind are ex- 
pressed that some exercises suggested 
by the Union board are omitted or neg- 
lected. For instance, we will say that 
there is a certain school that asserts 
that it cannot keep the two hours' ses- 
sion going with profit. On investigation 
we shall probably find that they do not 
have a ten minute singing exercise, that 
they have no concert recitations, or that 
the lessons from the "Outlines" are not 
gone through with that thorough- 
ness that is expected of them. These 
are the reasons, my brethren and sis- 
ters, why there is a difficulty. It is be- 
cause things essential to the well being 
and the progress of the Sunday schools 
are neglected and omitted. Those who 
have the spirit of their calling and a 
love for their work and for the children 
will have no difficulty, under ordinary 
circumstances, in keeping the children 
interested for the full two hours by the 
variety of exercises planned and car- 
ried out. 

I will say that taking all together, we 
are doing well. The work committed to 
our charge is receiving good attention. 
We are blessed of the Lord therein, and 
the establishment of stake union boards 
and stake union meetings, together with 
the publication of the "Outlines" is ac- 
complishing much to make the schools 
more thorough, better disciplined and 
altogether more progressive. 



In conclusion, let me say, my brethren 
and sisters, let it always be remembered 
that our object in the establishment of 
the Sunday schools, the reason for their 
existence is thaJt we may, as an auxiliary 
organization, strengthen the hands of 
the servants of God in making Latter- 
day Saints of the children of God's peo- 
ple, Latter-day Saints in faith and in 
works, who will love the Father's work 
and seek to upbuild His kingdom. 

May God bless us in our endeavors to 
accomplish this, is my -rayer through 
Jesus, our Redeemer. Amen. 

WILLIAM KIRKUP, 
• Superintendent of Sunday Schools in 
the Oneida Stake, said: 

The Oneida Stake of Zion is situated 
in the north end of what is known as 
Cache valley. We have in that stake 
twentv-four Sunday schools, fully or- 
ganized. We also have a stake board 
of twelve members. This is not quite 
sufficient to accomplish the work that 
is designed by the General Board, but 
we have a limited supply of material, 
and if we were to draw fully from the 
various wards for the number of mem- 
bers required to make our monthly vis- 
its, it would materially cripple other 
organizations. The stake superintend- 
ency is fully organized and its members 
are in perfect harmony with each oth- 
er. We meet every week, on the Mon- 
day night, after having made our visits 
on the Sunday, when we find it very 
convenient to make our reports, and in 
this way get to know and understand 
the conditions of the schools visited. 

Our stake board meets every month, 
and visits made by the other members 
of the board are then reported. We 
visit three Sundays in each month. We 
have also arranged to hold regular 
quarterly Stake Sunday school union 
meetings. We have been holding these 
meetings for three years, and we find 
them very beneficial to all the schools 
of our stake. The improvement that 
has been made since this organization 
was effected has been very marked. 

We have lately arranged to hold dis- 
trict Sunday school union meetings.be- 
cause our stake is very widely divided, 
our settlements being in some cases 
very distant; and we thought it well

in order to give our teachers better op- 
portunity of hearing instructions from 
the members of the stake board, to take 
the union meetings to them occasion- 
ally; and we believe that by taking 
these meetings to five different districts, 
we shall be able to accomplish more 
good than we can by calling all of the 
Sunday school workers together in one 
place once a quarter. It would be 
rather difficult for us, undejr our cir- 
cumstances, to come together every 
month, but at some future time we may 
be afjle to do better than we are now 
doing. 

We feel well in the cause, and the 
progress of the Sunday school work in 
our stake is very encouraging. We are 
very pleased to have the "Outlines." We 
have been preparing, in our stake, an 
outline of our own for the past three 
years, and we fully appreciate the la- 
bors of the board, because we know 
how much work it takes to prepare 
them. We are glad, however, that now 
we have outlines that are applicable to 
all the stakes of Zion. We are labor- 
ing to the end that we may get a proper 
understanding of them, that we may in- 
duce our teachers to thoroughly pre- 
pare themselves, for we are cognizant 
of the fact that without thorough 
preparation good results cannot be ac- 
complished. May the Lord add His 
blessings to our labors is my earnest 
prayer. Amen. 

ELDER THOMAS B. EVANS, 
Superintendent of Sunday schools of the 
Weber Stake, said: 
I am pleased to report, my brethren 
and sisters, that there are thirty-one 
Sunday schools in the Weber Stake of 
Zion, fully organized. Twenty-six 
members constitute the Weber Stake 
Sunday School Union board. We have 
organized a union meeting, which meets 
on the second Sunday in each month. 
We also have what we call a local 
board meeting ,or a meeting where the 
officers and teachers of the local schools 
meet together with the idea of prepara- 
tion in mind. That is, each teacher 
brings an individual outline. At this 
meeting, after the devotional exercises 
are over, the teachers of the respective 
departments prepare what we term a 



co-operative outline. This enables them 
to thoroughly prepare themselves upon 
the subject matter to be presented to 
the children on the Sunday following. 
We are in perfect harmony, I believe, 
with the Union Board, aiming to carry 
out their instructions, seeking with the 
help of the Lord to establish the prin- 
ciples of the Gospel of Jesus Christ in 
the hearts and minds of the children. 
May the Lord help us to this end, is my 
prayer in the name of Jesus. Amen.

ELDER JAMES H. TAGGART, 

Superintendent of Sunday schools of the 
Morgan Stake, said: 

My brethren and sisters, in reporting 
the Morgan Stake, I can say that we 
are and have been patterning after the 
Weber and other stakes. Besides the 
instructions we have received from the 
General Superintendemcy, we have re- 
ceived instructions from Superintend- 
ent Evans and his assistants. We have 
also had some members of our board 
visit Cache, Millard, Boxelder, Weber, 
Davis and Summit Stakes; and have 
been benefitted by the good points 
which we have found therein. Our 
Sunday schools in the Morgan Stake 
are a grand success, and though we are 
a small stake, we) feel that we shall 
be able to make a good mark. We 
are proud to say that we are all unit- 
ed as a band of brethren and sisters. 
Our worst difficulty is the trouble we 
have in getting the young metn in our 
Sunday school. We are all laboring 
to that end, and are succeeding very 
well. Our local board meetings are 
a success, but I am sorry to say that 
in some wards we have not as yet 
been successful in getting them start- 
ed, but where they have been started 
they are working satisfactorily. I 
pray the Lord to bless us all and our 
labors in the Morgan Stake, in the name 
of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER JOSIAH H. BURROWS, 
Superintendent of Sunday Schools of 

the Salt Lake Stake, said: 
There are forty-one Sunday schools 
in the Salt Lake Stake of Zion, having 



30 



DESERET SUNDAY SCHOOL, UNION. 



a total membership of some 10,199. Our 
increase during the past year was 944. 
So the remarks of Assistant General 
Superintendent Reynolds certainly do 
not apply to the Salt Lake Stake in re- 
gard to the matter of increase. 

Our Stake Sunday School Union 
Board was organized last November. It 
consists of 19 members, four of whom 
are sisters. We are proud of our Stake 
board, and feel that its members are 
working together as nicely as possible 
for the advancement of the interests of 
the Sunday schools. The superintend- 
ency meet generally twice a month in 
council meeting. The Stake board also 
meets twice a month. We visit the 
schools, on an average, about once in 
six weeks, and enjoy our labors to a 
very marked degree. Two special 
points we have been concentrating up- 
on during the last year — the importance 
of superintendents holding regular 
monthly council meetings, and also of 
holding the officers and teachers' 9:45 
prayer meeting. I am pleased to state 
that all of the schools in the stake, 
with the exception of two or three, ob- 
serve this prayer meeting, and the num- 
ber of superintendents who have acted 
upon the suggestion to hold regular 
council meetings is increasing. 

We are impressed with the impor- 
tance of missionary work in this Stake 
of Zion; and notwithstanding that five 
Sunday schools were organized last year 
and one this year, we still feel that there 
is opportunity in several wards for the 
organization of branch or cottage Sun- 
day schools, whereby the children can 
b>e brought together, without being com- 
pelled to go such great distances. 

We have adopted the method of clas- 
sifying the Stake work among several 
committees of the Stake board. We 
Tiave one committee known as the com- 
mittee on appointments, conferences, 
branch schools and missionary work, 
another on lessons and school work, 
another on grade, discipline, special 
features, anniversaries, etc., another on 
Sunday school choristers and music.and 
still another on secretaries, libraries 
and janitors. Since the organization, 
four of them have gone to work, and we 
have been giving the subjects present- 
ed by these committees as careful con- 



sideration as our experience and judg- 
ment enable us to do. 

We feel that we are now entering 
upon a very important period of growth 
of the Sunday school work. With the 
adoption of the "Outlines" and of more 
systematic methods we feel that there 
is a promising period before us. We de- 
sire to be' united with the general Sun- 
day school board and to carry out the 
instructions received from them. 

We labored last year to make our 
Sunday school conference a succe^, and 
while it required considerable drilling 
and labor, we think it repaid our efforts. 
We are now trying, in accordance with 
the recommendations of the Board, to 
have the Sunday schools hold annual 
Sunday school ward conferences.and we 
have already taken part in a number of 
these conferences. The preparation that 
is made enables the schools to make 
progress, it enables the officers to see 
what is being done, and it is beneficial 
in many ways. 

I appreciate very much the responsi- 
bility that rests upon me in connection 
with my associates. We are working 
in perfect harmony and are striving to 
cultivate the spirit of our calling. We 
feel that it is a field that is worthy of 
every sacrifice and effort that we can 
put forth. May the Lord bless one and 
all, from the General Superintendent to 
the least that may be engaged in the 
Sunday school work, to the glory of our 
Father in Heaven, and in the name of 
Jesus. Amen. 

Sister Lottie Owen then sang, "Cal-

PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH, 

General Superintendent of Sunday 
Schools of the Church, said: 

I desire to say just a few words. The 
benefit of our Sunday school work to 
our children and the rising generation 
cannot, I think, be too highly regard- 
ed by the Latter-day Saints, and more 
especially by those who are rearing 
children, and who desire to have their 
children brought up and to grow up in 
the way they should go. 

One of our brethren, reporting his 
labors as stake superintendent of Sun- 
day schools, made a remark something 
like this, that they had everything in

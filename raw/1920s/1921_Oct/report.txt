GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



The opening prayer was offered by Elder Stephen L. Chip- 
man, President of the Alpine stake of Zion. 

The hymn, "How firm a foundation, ye Saints of the Lord," 
was then sung by the choir and congregation. 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

It is indeed a great pleasure to have again the opportunity of 
meeting with the Latter-day Saints in General Conference. I desire 
most earnestly that the prayer of President Chipman may be real- 
ized and that all of us, who may have the opportunity of speak- 
ing during the sessions of this conference, may be inspired of the 
Lord. I know that I not only speak for myself but for all of my 
associates of the General Authorities of the Church when I say 
that we desire only to say those things, during this conference, that 
shall be for the benefit, spiritually as well as temporally, of the 
Latter-day Saints. I know not only my own heart, but I know the 
hearts of those with whom: I am associated, as the General Author- 
ities of the Church, and I know that each and all of us desire more 
than anything else in the world the advancement of the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. We desire the welfare spiritually 
of the people, and also their temporal welfare ; and it is our daily 
and constant prayer to God that his blesings may be and abide with 
the Saints in all parts of the world, and also with every honest- 
hearted soul who dwells upon the earth. 

THE SANCTIFYING POWER OF DISTRESS, AS ILLUSTRATED IN THE 
HISTORY OF THE SAINTS 

t 

I would like to express my firm conviction as to the applica- 
tion to each and every faithful Latter-day Saint, of the last verse 
that we have just sung, verse number four of the hymn, "How 
firm a foundation :" 

When through the deep waters I call thee to go, 
The rivers of sorrow shall not thee o'erflow, 
For I will he with thee, thy troubles to bless, 
And sanctify to thee thy deepest distress. > 

When I think of the distress of the Latter-day Saints, the 
dangers and persecutions through which they went in New York, 
Ohio, Missouri and Illinois; when I think of the trouble and diffi- 
culties of the great pioneer journey from the Missouri river to 
these valleys ; when I think of the reign almost of terror at differ- 
ent times from my childhood until now* — the coming of an army 
against our people ; when I think how near they came to starving 
because of the crickets; when I think of the confiscation of all the 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT

Church's property, and the many trials and tribulations through 
which the people have passed, — I say when I think of these things 
I realize that the Lord has sanctified all their trials to the good 
of the Latter-day Saints, for these afflictions and tribulations have 
fitted and qualified them more perfectly to live the gospel oi the 
Lord Jesus Christ. 

PRESENT DISTRESS AND DEBT 

At the present time the Latter-day Saints and the people of 
this intermountain country are in great distress financially. Per- 
haps there has never been a time from the early days of the set- 
tlement of the valley, when there was a greater scarcity of money 
in proportion to the needs of the people, and when so many people 
find themselves in financial difficulties, mainly due to the fact that 
they launched out beyond their means, and ran in debt, in many 
cases for luxuries. I happened to pick up in Chicago a bank 
advertisement which I think is very fine and timely just in this par- 
ticular condition of affairs. The words are the words of that wise 
man, Benjamin Franklin: 

Taxes are indeed very heavy; but if those laid on by the government 
were the only ones we had to pay, we might the more easily discharge 
them. But we have many others and much more grievous to some of us; 
we are taxed twice as much by our idleness, three times as much by our 
pride, and four times as much by our folly, [and they didn't .even have 
automobiles in that day] and from these taxes the commissioners cannot 
ease or deliver us by allowing an abatement. 

FAITH, INTEGRITY AND DEVOTION OF THE SAINTS 

From my eardiest recollections, from the days of Brigham 
Young until now, I have listened to men standing in the pulpit in 
the old Tabernacle, and before that in the Bowery, before we 
had the old Tabernacle, and from this stand', urging the people not 
to run into debt; and I believe that the great majority of all our 
troubles today is caused through the failure to carry out that 
counsel. 

I certainly hope that the lessons that we are learning today 
will turn out a blessing to us, that they will be sanctified to our 
good, as illustrated in the words of this verse from the hymn that 
I have read. And I believe that they will. I have an abiding and perfect 
faith in the integrity and the devotion and the loyalty of the 
Latter-day Saints to God and their desire to serve him. I have full 
faith in the people that have embraced the gospel. Why? Because 
they know the Lord ; because they know our Redeemer, the Lord 
Jesns Christ; because they know that this gospel, commonly called 
"Mormonism," is in very deed the plan of salvation ; because they

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



have an absolute and abiding knowledge that Joseph Smith was a 
prophet of the true and living God, and that the revelations con- 
tained in the Doctrine and Covenants are in very deed the words 
of God. There is no doubt in the minds of the Latter-day Saints 
that God our heavenly Father, the Creator of heaven and earth ; 
did speak to Joseph Smith. There is no doubt in the minds of the 
Latter-day Saints that God pointed to his Son and announced 
that he was his Son, and told the boy to hear him, and that the 
Savior of the world gave instructions to Joseph Smith. I read a few 
months ago of one of the great "divines" in Great Britain — a 
great- student of the Bible, declaring that Jesus Christ was not the 
Son of God, and quoting as part of his authority another great 
"divine" and a famous theological student and teacher. Thank 
the Lord for the revelations of God to us, for the revela- 
tions from Jesus Christ where, time and time again, he an- 
nounces himself as the Son of the living God, and the 
Redeemer of the World ! Knowing as I know, and as the Latter- 
day Saints do know, that God lives, that Jesus is the Christ, 
that Joseph Smith was a prophet of God, that the revelations 
contained in this book are in very deed the words of God, and 
the words of our Redeemer, I repeat that I have full faith in 
the integrity to God of the Latter-day Saints ; and I am convinced 
beyond a shadow of doubt that the work of the Lord will continue 
to spread, notwithstanding the hard times financially through which we 
have been passing. 



PROGRESS IN THE MISSION FIELD 

We have, at the present time in the missionary field, seventeen 
hundred and ninety-eight missionaries, not including hundreds 
cf workers in foreign lands who are local missionaries, who have 
been working in that capacity because of the lack of material 
in sending elders from the stakes of Zion. Our missionary activities 
for the first six months of this year indicate an increase in all 
the missions of the Church of 65 per cent in baptisms, as compared 
with the same period a year ago. This proves that the work of the 
Lord is spreading, that notwithstanding hard times, notwith- 
standing financial difficulties, there is a most remarkable and 
wonderful increase in the number of those who are embracing 
the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ- We have practically the same 
number of missionaries now that we had a year ago, so this growth 
is not because of the increase in the laborers in the fields, but is be- 
cause of increase in the power of the missionaries and the bless- 
ings of the Lord to those who are engaged in the work. There 
has also been an increase of over 50 per cent in the mission fields 
in charities obtained during the past six months. 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT

ABOUT THE LABORS OF MISSIONARIES 

In this connection, I desire to say to all the Latter-day Saints 
that we wish they would refrain from writing to' laborers in the 
mission field suggesting that it is about time they were coming 
home. Where parents have had sons in the mission field for, say 
15, 16 or 18 months, and feel, because of financial difficulties 
that it is impossible to keep them longer, we advise that they 
state the circumstances to the bishop of their wards, who should 
then apply to the elders and seventies, and these should endeavor 
to raise the means to keep those young men in the field for 
at least two years or two years and a half. In most cases a young 
elder is just coming to himself and to a capacity and ability 
and power to preach the gospel with force and with the inspiration 
of God, when he has been in the mission field 18 months, and 
it is a great injustice to the boy who is growing spiritually — as 
he cannot grow in any other labor in all the world — that he should 
have to come home too soon. Those who are at home ought to 
realize this, and ought to feel a responsibility and a willingness 
and a desire to keep in the field the young men from the various 
wards until they have completed at least two years of service ; and 
in many cases it would be a god-send to the young men, as well 
as to those who help , if their mission were extended to two and 
a half or even three years. I remember President Lyman's idea 
was that a missionary who had been in the field two years and a 
half could do more by remaining another six months than he had 
done in the entire year of his previous term ; and I believe this. 

APPEAL TO THE SAINTS TO KEEP MISSIONARIES IN THE FIELD 

So where young men have the spirit of their missions and are 
themselves willing and anxious to stay, but whose parents, be- 
cause of financial difficulties are unable to keep them, I appeal to 
the Latter-day Saints to respond to the calls of the elders and the 
seventies and the bishopric of the wards, and assist in keeping these 
young men in the field. Our mission to the world is to proclaim the 
gospel ; one reason why the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ was placed 
upon the earth was that men should come to a knowledge of the truth ; 
and the one supreme object above all other objects of every Latter-day 
Saint should be to bring people to a knowledge of the truth. 

MISSIONARY WORK THE GREATEST OF ALL IN THE WORLD 

The missionary work of the Latter-day Saints is the greatest 
of all the great works in all the world. We find recorded in the 
eighteenth section of the Doctrine and Covenants : 



6 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Remember the worth of souls is great in the sight of God: 
For, behold, the Lord your Redeemer suffered death in the flesh; where- 
fore he suffered the pain of all men, that all men might repent and come 
unto him. 

And he hath risen again from the dead, that he might bring all men 
unto him, on conditions of repentance; 

And how great is his joy in the soul that repenteth. 

Wherefore, you are called to cry repentance unto this people; 

And if it so be that you should labor all your days in crying repent- 
ance unto this people, and bring, save it be one soul unto me, how great 
shall be your joy with him in the kingdom of my Father? 

And now, if your joy will be great with one soul that you have brought 
unto me into the kingdom of my Father, how great will be your joy if 
you should bring many souls unto me? 

Behold, you have my gospel before you, and my rock, and my salva- 
tion. 

Ask the Father in my name, in faith believing that you shall receive, 
and you shall have the Holy Ghost, which manifesteth all things which 
are expedient unto the children of men. 

And if we have not faith we cannot please the Lord, the 
revelation goes on to say. We should have faith in God and not 
only have faith, but works also, and exhibit our works by supporting 
those who are in the missionary field. 

WONDERFUL MISSIONARY LABORS IN THE STAKES OF ZION 

I wish to say that I am delighted with the excellent and 
wonderful labors that have been accomplished in some of the 
stakes of Zion in converting and baptizing people. Missionary 
work that has been carried on here at home during the past six 
months has been far more fruitful than it has ever been before. 
We have not really done our duty here at home in our mis- 
sionary work. It is only within the last year or two that we have 
taken up a systematic labor of visiting those who are not of our 
faith and explaining the gospel; and in proportion to the amount 
of this work that has been done, the results in baptisms have 
been greater than the same amount of work anywhere. I am 
grateful for this labor, and commend those stakes of Zion where 
it has been most energetically carried on. 

THE BEST LAW IN THE WORLD TO MAKE BETTER LATTER-DAY SAINTS 

In these hard times financially, I want to repeat to the Latter- 
day Saints my firm belief that God our heavenly Father prospers 
and blesses and gives wisdom to those men and to those women 
who are strictly honest with him in the payment of their tithing. 
I believe that when a man is in financial difficulty, the best way to 
get out of that difficulty (and I speak from personal experience, 
because I believe that more than once in my life I have been 
in the financial mud as deep as almost anybody) is to be absolutely 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT

honest with the Lord, and never to allow 1 a dollar to come into our 
hands without the Lord receiving ten per cent of it. The Lord 
does not need your money or mine. Compliance with the law of 
tithing and donations for ward meetinghouses, stake houses, academies, 
temples, missionary work and these various needs, are all for our 
good. They are but lessons that we are learning which will qualify 
and prepare us to become more godlike and to be fitted to go 
back into the presence of our heavenly Father. The very lessons 
of a financial nature that are ' given ,us are the same 'as 
lessons that are given in a school to a boy or a girl ; they 
are for the benefit of the boy; they are for the benefit 
of the girl, for their advancement, for their joy and happiness in 
after life ; because of all the knowledge and information we acquire, 
and in the improvement that we make, we ourselves are the ones 
who are benefited. God our heavenly Father has instituted laws 
to improve his people physically, spiritually, intellectually, and 
one of the best laws in all the world to make better Latter-day 
Saints is the law of tithing. There are many people who believe the 
gospel and would probably embrace it, but for the fact that they 
are like that young man of whom we read in the Scripture, 
when the Savior told him, after the young man declared that 
"all these things have I done," to sell what he had and give to the 
poor. M.any people cannot endure the gospel because of financial 
requirements that are made of them, and they allow the things of 
this world, which they have grasped firmly and steadfastly, to 
rob them of the greatest of all God's gifts, namely, life eternal. 
I commend the law of tithing to the Latter-day Saints, and I am 
entitled to commend it, because from my childhood days I have 
never made a dollar that the tithing has not been honestly paid 
upon; and I acknowledge the blessings of Almighty God to me be- 
cause of obeying this law. 

THE LAW OF HEALTH AND WEALTH 

I want to exhort the Latter-day Saints to observe and keep the 
Word of Wisdom. I consider it almost a crime for men and 
women who acknowledge that they know that God lives, that 
Jesus is the Christ, that Joseph Smith was a prophet of God, and 
that this gospel commonly called "Mormonism" is in very 
deed the truth — I consider it almost a crime that when the Lord 
Almighty gives to them a law whereby they can have health 
and vigor of body and mind, they disregard it. Every single 
dollar that is expended in breaking the Word of Wisdom goes 
out of the country. It is so much of the vital fluid, so to speak, 
financially drawn from the community every time a man or 
woman drinks a cup of tea or coffee or uses tobacco or uses 
liquor, because we do not produce those things at home. If they 



8 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



actually believed thoroughly the Word of Wisdom it seems to 
me you couldn't possibly persuade people not to obey it : 

"A Word of Wisdom for the benefit of the Council of High 
Priests, assembled in Kirtland, and Church, and also the Saints of 
Zion. 

"To be sent greeting — not by commandment or constraint, 
but by revelation and the word of wisdom, showing forth the 
order and will of God"' — remember this is the will of God — "in the 
temporal salvation of all Saints in the last days." 

I believe firmly that if all the money which has been sent out 
of this country from the day the Saints first located in these 
valleys, for those things that the Lord has said in this revelation 
are not good for man, had instead been kept here, the accumulation 
of wealth in our country would have been so great that this 
intermountain section where the Latter-day Saints are located, 
would be one of the richest and most prosperous in all the United 
States. A dollar is to the financial body what a drop of blood is 
in the body. We only have, as I understand, about twenty pounds 
of blood in the body. The heart beats about eighty times a 
minute and handles about four ounces every time it beats; there- 
fore that twenty pounds of blood is handled every minute and there 
is about ten tons of it handled every twenty-four hours — ten tons 
although there are only twenty pounds of it. Of course they say 
we just accidentally came here, our hearts just accidentally keep a-going 
and handles ten tons of blood a day — a little bit of a pump, the size of 
your fist — and if it accidentally stopped two or three minutes, none of 
us would be here. The heart alone is one of the greatest testimonies 
of the divine power of God, because we don't even have to think to ask 
it to beat. If we did, we wouldn't have anything else to do but sit 
down and tell the heart to work. It would keep us busy all the time. 
There is nothing in all the world devised by the utmost ingenuity of, 
man, that can do the same amount of work as that little piece of ma- 
chinery, the human heart, operating after the manner of a pump, with 
twenty pounds doing practically ten tons of work every twenty-four 
hours. Now, as I say, money, a dollar, is just the same. It is estimated 
that a dollar does all the way from twenty to over a hundred dollars 
of work a year, going round and round, and circulating, and buying 
and paying and doing work ; so when we stop to think that there 
are hundreds of thousands of dollars sent out of this country 
every year for breaking the Word of Wisdorrfj — true, the great 
majority of it is not sent by the Latter-day Saints — we can form 
some idea of what could have happened if money thus sent out 
had been kept at home and each dollar of it permitted to do its 
hundred dollars' worth of work-

A PRACTICAL LESSON ON THE WORTH OF A DOLLAR IN HOME INDUSTRY 

Speaking of the work a dollar does at home reminds me of 
an incident that I have related many times. Years ago there was 
a great drive in this section of the country to support home-made 
goods, and I was one who was deeply interested in it, being a 
member of several committees that were working to bring about 
this policy. I remember that during our conference we had a 
meeting in the Assembly Hall one evening and one of the speakers 
on that occasion was the then bishop of Smithfield, George L. 
Farrell, Brother Farrell said that for twenty odd years, or perhaps 
he said thirty, he had been coming down to conference twice a 
year and, knowing that all the stock in the railroad running 
through that country was owned by eastern capitalists, he had 
marked the money which he paid for his tickets to see if he ever 
got any of it back again. "I have also," he said, "marked the 
money that I paid ifor home-made goods to see if I got any of that 
back again, I never got any of my railroad money back," he con- 
tinued, "but one reason that I always buy home-made goods is that 
I think a whole lot of George L. Farrell and I like to get my money 
back again, and time and time again when I have bought home- 
made goods and marked the money, that identical money, staying 
in the community and circulating around, has come back to me. And 
it is because I think a great deal of myself, as well as my neighbors, 
that I buy shoes made at home for my children, that I buy home- 
made cloth out of which to make clothes for those children." Then 
he said : "To give you a practical illustration : When starting for 
this identical conference, standing at the depot at Smithfield I saw 
a man who had made some shoes for my children, and I walked 
up and handed him five dollars to pay for those shoes ; he saw 
somebody else in the group to whom he owed five dollars, and 
he handed him the five; this man saw another to whom he was 
indebted and handed him the same piece of money; and he in turn 
saw another man and handed it to him. until finally after five or 
six debts had been paid with the same piece of money the last man 
to receive it came up to me and said, 'Brother Farrell, I owe you six 
dollars. Here is five on my account' — and I put my home-made 
shoes money back into' my trousers pocket." Twenty or thirty 
dollars' worth of debts were thus paid by patronizing one shoe- 
maker in Smithfield, the money was saved at home by circulating 
around, it paid these many debts and at length landed back into 
the pocket where it started from. That was a practical lesson, 
and a practical lesson that ought to count. 

HOME MANUFACTURED GOODS 

It would be a very easy matter to increase the use of this 
one product in this country by thousands and tens of thousands 



10 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



of dollars. Before me is an audience of at least five to ten thousand 
people, and I would like to know how many of you are standing, or 
sitting I should perhaps say, with your feet in home-made shoes. 
I dare not ask those of you who are thus shod to stand up — I am 
afraid the showing would be altogether too thin. I am myself stand- 
ing in home-made shoes ; it is the kind I have been standing in 
for over thirty years, and I find that they are good enough for 
me. Another reason why I like them is that they wear longer 
than any I used to get before I commenced wearing them, and in 
addition to wearing longer they look better ; and in addition to 
looking better, they cost less. So I am like Brother Farrell. It 
is not altogether patriotism, it is because I think a whole lot of 
Heber J. Grant that I wear home-made shoes. I have been con- 
verted to home-made goods from the time that, as a young man, 
I heard a sermon from this stand by Brigham Young, that great 
leader, that man of w r onderful foresight for the benefit of his people 
spiritually, financially, and intellectually, one of the greatest pioneers 
and most remarkable men that ever lived. In passing let me say that in 
conversing with a great banker in New York only a few days ago, I 
made the remark that Brigham Young would yet be recognized as one 
of the greatest organizers and one of the greatest leaders of men that 
ever lived, and this banker replied in substance : "There is no one who 
knows anything of Brigham Young's history that does not acknowledge 
it today. I do. I have read his history and it is one of the most intensely 
interesting books I have ever read." And my belief is that one of 
th* very things which caused the banker to have confidence in the 
Latter-day Saints today was that many years ago he read the histoy 
of Brigham Young and was impressed by the wonderful things that 
had been accomplished by him. 

But coming back to the sermon. President Young pleaded with 
the people to support the Provo Woolen Mills ; and from that day until 
these mills shut down some years agq, I never bought a suit of 
clothes in Salt Lake City that was not made from Provo goods which 
I selected and handed to the tailor to make up for me. I was honored 
once with being in the legislature when we gave a ball to the members 
of the Wyoming legislature. I was wearing at the time a gray Provo 
suit; and, realizing that everybody who would be at the party in the 
Theatre would have a black suit — a swallow-tail or Prince Albert, — ■ 
I went to the Z. C. M. I., bought me a black suit, Prince Albert coat. I 
didn't want to be the only white sheep in the bunch, and so went to the 
ball in black. The very next day I gave it away to a poor relative : the 
ball cost me thirty odd dollars — the cost of a black suit. A friend asked 
me, "Why didn't you wear it a little while, and get a little benefit out of 
it before you gave it to your neighbor?" I aswered that I didn't want 
to have the suit on if I happened to want to preach in favor of 
home-made goods. I was afraid that it being a black suit, I might 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT

by chance wear it some Sunday, and I have always felt that I would 
not ask the people to do anything that I didn't do myself. I didn't 
know until yesterday that tne Provo Woolen Mills were again 
making cloth for suits and overcoats and I clo not propose to buy any 
overcoats in the future except those made from the Knight Woolen 
Mills goods or some other Utah establishment which is making them. 

BUY HOME MADE GOODS 

I call upon the Latter-day Saints to buy home-made goods of every 
kind that they can possibly get here at home. In other words, let cane 
sugar alone and buy some beet sugar. Some people think you can't 
make the finest kind of candy unless you have cane sugar. Well, I 
have been guilty of swapping sacks, you know, and lo and behold, 
Utah beet sugar in a cane sugar sack will "jell" all right, will 
make all kinds of candy ; but cane sugar in a Utah beet sugar sack 
won't do any of these things. I had the same experience years ago 
with soap. As a young man I was agent for Franklin M : acVeagh & 
Co.'s grocery house, of Chicago. The soapmaker employed by James 
A. Kirk & Co. had left that firm and MacVeagh & Co. secured his ser- 
vices and proceeded to make all the kinds and brands of soap which 
he had been making for his former firm. There was a good hired 
woman working for us who couldn't read English, but knew all the 
wrappers on the Kirk soap ; and she insisted she couldn't create a 
lather on wash day. She couldn't wash clothes at all with the MacVeagh 
soap. But when I took the MacVeagh soap out and put in Kirk 
wrappers she declared it perfect ; and when I took the Kirk soap and 
put it in MacVeagh wrappers the poor woman again insisted she 
couldn't lather with it. 

I say to the people, buy all things that you possibly can 
which are produced here at home. No section of the inter-mountain 
country has been hit so hard financially as ours — Utah and southern 
Idaho — because of the tremendous slump in the prices of the pro- 
ducts of the soil and because of the great fall in live stock values. I 
was given a place of honor as state chairman and I esteemed the 
privilege of calling upon the people to subscribe for Liberty bonds. 
I went to California with Mr. Farnsworth, chairman of our state 
defense committee, and other loyal, patriotic, men, to discuss ways and 
means in connection with raising money for our government and as 
chairman of the Liberty Loan committee for Utah. I said to Mr. 
Lynch, then governor of the Federal Reserve Bank : "T pledge you the 
absolute loyalty of the people of Utah. I promise to put over any 
requirement, no matter how much it is, that is placed on the people of 
Utah, on one condition, and that is that you will give us a federal 
reserve branch in Salt Lake City. We haven't got the resources, we 
haven't the war activities, we haven't the money. But we have the

loyalty, and if you will bring the bank there, we will borrow the 
money and we will do our share. The Bank organized a bank and they 
expected that five or six clerks, ten at the most, were all they would 
need for some time; and it was a little less than five months, as I 
remember it, when we were owing that branch bank, because of 
financial distress, between forty and fifty millions of dollars. We 
did our duty. Then since the slump came, inasmuch as it was all 
borrowed money, it is wearing the life out of us to pay the interest. 
I have conversed with men from San Franisco and they acknowledge 
that this inter-mountain country has been hit hardest because of 
difficulty in getting our products to market. Our distance from 
market creates a discrimination — not that I am blaming this all upon 
the freight . rates, which are costing us heavily, being in some cases 
almost prohibitive. But if we have to suffer in having to pay so much 
10 get our goods to far-away markets, if we are suffering more than 
most other sections in this respect, all the more reason to avail our- 
selves of the great relief and remedy that will come from our purchas- 
ing and using every single solitary article that can be made at home. 
Now, I am not getting any commission for talking home manufactured' 
goods ; but I feel that it is clearly for the people's financial benefit that 
they should support home-made goods to the fullest possible extent. 

CO-OPERATION ADVISED 

I have been much delighted with the splendid work that President 
Alonzo A. Hinckley is doing in trying to arrange for a co-operation so 
that our alfalfa, which is quarantined and cannot be shipped away, 
can be utilized by the people who have livestock to feed. I would 
rejoice if we could mature our livestock, quit killing the lambs and 
the breeding cattle, and arrange to feed our stock here at home. 
I commend all the co-operative work in this direction that is going on, 
and hope that the farmer and the stockraiser can get together and use 
up all the hay and other products of the soil for the feeding of our own 
stock instead of carrying these products over for another year. As 
an illustration of the imposition in being obliged to pay so much 
for mutton, I ordered a couple of muttonchops — 80 cents — during my 
recent trip east; and while I haven't such a fearfully large mouth, 
I honestly believe I could have taken one of them entire in just one 
bite, if I had cut the meat off the bone— two bites — forty cents a bite- 
On other occasions, I ordered and paid for chops which I am sure 
I could have got in my mouth without the least trouble in the world, 
in two bites to a chop— twenty cents a bite. Now, when you think of 
the stock-raiser having to sell his ewe lambs and getting about five 
cents a pound, it will be evident that the time has come when we 
need a little co-operation between the man who is running the res- 
taurant, the man who js running the meat shop, the man who has 
hay and grain, and the man who has got mutton for sale. Perhaps 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 



13 



some of us then could raise enough money so that instead of getting 
two bites for eighty cents, we might get three chops for a meal 
instead of two and get them for thirty or forty cents. 

CHARITY ENJOINED 

We want to try to get back to first principles, and to co-operate 
to carry out that second great commandment. The first is to love the 
Lord our God with all our heart, with all our might, mind and 
strength ; and the second is like unto it, to love our neighbor as 
ourselves. Let us be charitable in these hard times. Let us not oppress 
our brothers who may be owing us a little, if we can possibly avoid it. 
Let us be hopeful and cheerful and happy. Why, we are in a magnifi- 
cent condition in comparison with the time when the crickets were 
destroying the crops of our fathers and mothers. We are in a mag- 
nificent condition in comparison with the early days when people 
went around bare-footed, when they had one suit of clothes, when 
they had one pound of butter in a whole year, as some of us did in 
our houses. Let us study economy, let us be kind and charitable, and 
above all, let us serve God with full purpose of heart, be honest 
in our tithes and offerings, liberal in doing these things with our 
means that shall be for the benefit and uplift of God's kingdom. 
May the Lord bless us and pour out his Spirit abundantly upon us 
during this conference is my prayer, and I ask it in the name of Jesus. 
Amen.

PRESIDENT CHARLES W. PENROSE 

I cannot express fully my gratitude to God and my brethren 
for the opportunity I have of being present on this great occasion. 
The Lord knows my heart and he knows my desires and intents, 
and he has abundantly blessed me, and I acknowledge his hand this 
morning in my presence in this congregation. During part of the 
time that has elapsed since our April Conference in this building, I 
have passed through a time of severe bodily affliction, something to 
which I haven't been very much accustomed during my eventful 
life, but I suffered very severely, and it seemed to me that I was 
approaching very closely to the gates that we sing about sometimes. 
President Grant came to me at my bedroom one morning and told me 
that I had to get up out of that bed and go down to the coast and 
spend a month there. Well, I almost laughed in his face at the idea, 
but he said I could go and he would see to my transportation all 
right, I need not worry about that, and to cut the story short I found 
it advisable for me to carry out good counsel. I made the effort and 
succeeded. I did as he requested me and stayed as long as I thought 
I ought to stay there, having been encouraged by him and President 
Ivins so to do, and returned when I thought the time had properly 
arrived for me to come home, and here I am this morning, revived 



PRESIDENT CHARLES W. PENROSE 15 



in spirit as well as in body, and filled with gratitude and thanks- 
giving to God and my brethren and sisters who prayed for me. 

FAITH THE BEGINNING OF OUR RELIGION. 

I know that I had the faith and prayers of a great many of my 
friends and I thank them for the exercise of their faith, that faith 
which I believe and hope will abide always, as we have heard in the 
song. That is the beginning of our religion, faith, real faith in the 
true and living God. Faith in a false god does not amount to much, 
Still it is better to believe in some kind of a god or supreme being, 
to whom we feel we owe allegiance, than to have no faith at all. 
But true faith, living faith, which brings forth works, in the right 
God, the only living and true God, our Eternal Father, is a great 
thing, and it is the gift of God that is given to all his children in their 
very nature and being as his sons and daughters. That is the beginning 
of the religion that is called "Mormonism." "We believe in God the 
Eternal Father, and in his Son, Jesus Christ, and in the Holy Ghost." 
That is the first article of our belief as expressed by the Prophet 
Joseph in the reasons that he gave for the faith of the Latter-day 
Saints, and which we hold today and repeat in our Sunday Schools 
and in many of our gatherings. 

What a blessed thing it is to have real faith and confidence in 
that Being who is the Author of our lives, from whom we received our 
organized spiritual existence. The elements as he has told us, are 
eternal. The elements of our bodies, as well as of our spirits, have 
no beginning. They always were, they always will be. It is a great 
consolation to know that fact, a fact that we are not beings of a 
moment, as it were, but we are eternal in our nature, that we are 
of eternal existence from an eternal parentage, and that we can 
approach our Father, and that our spirits can reach out to him and 
have communion with him, that we can realize our relationship to 
him, and his to us, and know that he is mindful of us as his off- 
spring. For the spirit of man is the offspring of God. It is through 
the exercise of faith in my behalf by my friends, and my own faith, 
that I recovered from my sickness, and I was benefited greatly by 
the breezes of the ocean down by the beach near Los Angeles. The 
real revivification that has come to me has been by the spiritual life, 
the spirit that proceeds from our Father throughout the immensity 
of space, which, as he has told us, gives life to all things that have 
life, which is light also, as well as life, which is the Spirit of Christ 
in which we are told, he is in the sun and the moon and the stars and 
in the earth on which we stand, and by which God has told us he 
made the worlds through and by his Son, "and the inhabitants there- 
of are begotten sons and daughters unto God." 

The living faith that we have in that Being is our supporter un- 
der every circumstance. In the darkest hours we have spent in 
our mortal lives, or as a community, in the tribulations and trials 
through which the Church has passed, we could approach to him, 
the Author of our being, our Father, and feel, as Jesus of Naz- 



16 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



areth did when he was in the flesh, that he is our Father and 
that we can come to him and he will lean to us. The Lord says : 
"Seek unto me saith the Lord, and I will draw near unto you." That 
is a great truth that the Latter-day Saints, I think, understand pretty 
well, or they are coming to understand. It is a reality and should be 
impressed upon our offspring, our children, our little children. 
Mothers and fathers should have this fact impressed upon them, that 
"while they have fathers of the flesh," as the Apostle Paul puts it, 
"and we gave them reverence, how much rather should we have 
reverence for him who is the Father of spirits and live." Teach your 
children real faith in a real God, a person, a being who exists and 
who understands all our feelings- and our emotions, having passed 
through the experiences that we are now passing through and who 
is the very embodiment of everything that is right and true and 
good throughout the whole universe, all that is pure, all that is en- 
lightening, all that is intelligent, all that is sympathetic, all that there 
is in life, and faith and truth are embodied in him, and he is the ex- 
pression of these eternal verities to us. What a blessing it is today that 
we have that faith, that has been sung about here, which shall abide 
always. 

Now these three, Paul taught, "faith, hope and charity shall 
abide." Faith must abide in our hearts under every circumstance in 
which we operate, individually and as members of the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. And it is by that faith that the 
elders whom we have been hearing about go out into the mission 
world to proclaim the truth, to bear witness of the fatherhood of 
God and the brotherhood of man, and to bear testimony that our 
Father has spoken in these last days, as he spoke many times 
anciently, and that he, who is the Father of Jesus Christ and who 
spake through him in the meridian of time, spake to and through the 
Prophet Joseph Smith in these last days and that his Son has been 
teaching, through that prophet and his successors, right along down, 
from the time when the boy Joseph offered that glorious prayer 
of faith in the Grove. He is our Father and Jesus Christ is his 
spokesman. All that has been revealed to the children of men from 
time to time has been done through that agency, that sonship, the 
voice of God to the Prophet Joseph, "This is my beloved Son, hear 
him," has been the policy of our Father from the beginning of the 
organization of this Church. It was through his Son and by his 
Son, that this earth was framed. It is through him and by him that 
all the revelations God has given to mankind, have come to the 
human family, and he is today at the head of this Church, representing 
the Father, and he can speak for the Father, and the Holy Ghost can 
speak for both, and bear witness of the truth in the hearts of the 
children of men. 

MISSIONARY WORK AND MEANS. 

One matter that President Grant has touched upon this morning 
is this work of our boys, and mothers and fathers, younger men and 



PRESIDENT CHARLES W. PENROSE 17 



older men, who go out into the world without money and without price, 
so far as payment is concerned, spending their own money or their par- 
ents' money, and sometimes, I am afraid, spending it a little too lavish- 
ly. Boys that go out into the mission field ought not to go with the 
feeling that they have at their command large sums of money. There 
is no need for it. It is true that it costs a good deal more now to 
pay the expenses of a missionary abroad than it used to do in 
former times. In my early labors, in fact nearly all that I have done 
in foreign lands as a missionary, was done under the old law of 
no purse and no scrip. When I went' out first as a boy I took nothing 
with me but the clothes I had on, except a bundle of tracts and a 
pair of pants and a shirt to use in baptizing. I had faith I could bring 
people into the Church, and I wanted something I could put on to 
baptize them in. I had use for those things and I did the work just 
as I have said. Indeed, all my ministry among the people of the world 
was literally "without purse or scrip." Now I do not say that this 
should be done now. I believe that as circumstances change, the 
Lord changes his commandments, to correspond therewith. As Jesus 
taught, a great many of you who went out in the world took "neither 
brass nor gold nor silver in your purses, nor scrip for your journey, 
nor two coats, "for the laborer is worthy of his hire," but afterwards 
he said: "When I sent you out without purse or scrip, did you lack 
anything? And they said, Nay, Lord," but now he said, "He that 
has no purse let him get one and he that hath no sword let him buy 
one." Circumstances had changed and so the word was changed. He 
didn't change, but the circumstances being changed the word of the 
Lord was different. So in these times conditions have changed very 
much from those times. 

We find it necessary to have the boys go out two and two. 
Sometimes one of them is a poor boy comparatively, has no money, 
or very little, and the other has plenty. It is a rather difficult con- 
dition for the poor boy, but they have to lodge together and divide 
expenses, and' this should be regulated by prudence, by economy, 
by wisdom, and the parents should see to it that their boys are not 
given too much money and that the others who are more poorly supplied 
are assisted so that they don't have too little money; but, generally 
speaking, I think our missionaries, in these latter days, are in many 
respects too well favored with money to spend. They are not sent 
out for the purpose of indulging in seeing the sights of the world, 
of going to motion picture shows, theatres, and other places of 
amusement, although occasionally something of that kind is all right, 
but that is not the object. What they are sent out for is to carry with 
them that abiding faith in God, and preach it to the people, that he 
is the same yesterday, today and forever, that he can be approached, 
that he has laws and commandments and ordinances which he re- 
quires people who desire to come to him, to attend to in the right 
way, and under proper authority. They go out for that purpose, and 
that should be their object, and be their main object. After they have 
been in the field for awhile, it gets to be so, even if it is not so in the 



18 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



beginning, some of our boys, who have done things that are wrong, 
who have not kept themselves as straight as they should be as the 
offspring of Latter-day Saints, after they. have been in the mission 
field for a little while, begin to get their hearts softened, and in 
humility and faith in God they go and confess their wrong-doings 
to their presiding officers. When they can be forgiven, through full 
repentance and change of life, that blessing is extended to them. 
When they are still hardened in their hearts and prone to do wrong 
they have to be sent home, of course. 

THE SPIRIT, NOT THE FLESH, SHOULD GOVERN. 

Now, they should be taught from their childhood to preserve the 
purity of their lives and bodies, to act with purity of conduct always, 
and especially in their association with the other sex. This should 
be in the minds of our parents and they should instil it into the 
minds of their boys and girls. God is a being of purity, he is sacred 
and holy, and sacred and holy be his Name, and sacred and holy 
should we, his servants, be in all our conduct while we dwell upon 
the earth in the flesh, and we should learn the great lesson of the 
spirit governing the flesh instead of permitting the flesh to govern 
the spirit. These are simple truths that should be impressed upon the 
minds of our little children that they may grow up in that spirit 
and in that supreme faith in God which is at the foundation of our 
religion. 

FAITH AND PURITY TO BE TAUGHT IN THE HOME. 

This should be taught in the household, or privately, by the 
mothers to their girls, and the fathers to their boys, and they should 
grow up in that atmosphere. Let us see to that, my brethren and sis- 
ters, so that in our homes that faith shall prevail, faith in God, real 
true faith, coming from the soul, from the heart, in God our Eternal 
Father, and impress that upon our children, and they will grow up 
in the favor of the Lord and be ready to serve in his great latter-day 
work, and there is no work like it in the world. The privilege of a 
man holding the Holy Priesthood, of being an elder in the Church 
of Christ, ordained to preach the gospel, to administer baptism for . 
the remission of sins, to lay his hands upon the baptized believer 
and say, "receive the Holy Ghost," that is a wonderful thing, but it 
is bestowed upon our missionary boys and if they grow up in the 
fear of the Lord, in full faith in him, wherever they go they will 
carry a power with them in the world that is not possessed by other 
men. We want it at home* right here where we live. Every boy and 
every girl born to the Latter-day Saints should grow up in that 
spirit of purity. 

Let us see to it, my brethren and sisters, that we carry this 
out, every ordinance and every counsel that comes from the mouth 
of God for our guidance and direction. This is what we should do. 
"Man," said Jesus Christ, "should not live by bread alone, but by 
every word that proceedeth from the mouth of God." That is the 



PRESIDENT CHARLES W. PENROSE 



19 



celestial law. When we do that we are living the celestial law and 
we shall gain celestial glory if we continue to abide in it, for by 
abiding in these things we sanctify our nature, we make our bodies and 
our spirits serve God, and come in subjection to his law and 
his influence and Spirit-, which proceed from him, and our bodies 
become so sanctified that they are capable of being quickened in the 
resurrection by a celestial glory, and if we do not live in accordance 
with such law we cannot gain a celestial glory. That should be in our 
minds, and we should teach it to our children. 

OUR DUTY TO LOVE GOD AND SERVE HIM XN THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST. 

Now, there is a law, as our President declared to us, that we 
shall love God with all our heart, and might, and mind', and strength. 
God told that to the people anciently. It is also in the Doctrine and 
Covenants. It was told to the first settlers in Zion: "The land of 
Zion" which is to be consecrated to be inhabited by the Saints where 
the great temple of God shall be reared, upon which "the glory 
of God shall rest." The Lord told the people there in the very be- 
ginning of their settlement to love him "with all their heart and 
soul and mind and strength ; and, said he, "in the name of Jesus 
Christ shalt thou serve him." Don't forget that, my brethren. We 
serve God in the name of Jesus Christ. That is his full name. That 
is his name which was given anciently. You can read it in the Pearl 
of' Great Price. That is the name given in the latter days. It is in 
nearly every revelation in the Doctrine and Covenants : "Listen to 
the voice of Jesus Christ;" we are to love God with all our hearts 
and serve him in the name of Jesus Christ. The ordinances we per- 
form, all the prayers we offer, all that we do as servants of God 
in this Church, should be done in the name of Jesus Christ, for it 
is his Church, and he stands really at its head. Then we are told 
that we should love our neighbors, also, as ourselves. What a good 
thing it would be for Latter-day Saints, if we all carried out that law, 
would it not? 

FINANCE CIRCULATION PAY WHAT THOU 0WEST. 

This morning, when President Grant was illustrating so beauti- 
fully the circulation of the blood in the body of man, and the circula- 
tion in finance which he also touched upon, the thought I had in 
my mind was this : yes, if that blood is good, but it would not be 
much good if it wasn't circulating. If it remained there — sometimes 
a clot of blood comes into a part of the body and it brings about 
death instead of life, because it impedes the circulation. I was wonder- 
ing if there wasn't a good deal of money owned by our people 
tucked away somewhere "against a rainy day." You know this is a 
threatening time, and we are very much perplexed, the banks are 
tied up, so to speak — they have money no doubt locked up some- 
where, I think so, but that is their business. If we have, and we are 
owing anything to anybody ; pay what thou owest, I believe it is a 
good injunction to the Latter-day Saints today, and if all people who 



20 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



owe money to any of their brethren, or to people that are not their 
brethren, or of their brethren, still unpaid, to^ pull that money out 
of that old stocking and out of that box locked up in a bank, and pay 
your debts. I believe it would make a great change financially among 
our people. There are many people in debt to their neighbors and they 
don't love their neighbors as they ought to love them. Take out that 
money and put it into circulation, and then it will accomplish much 
of what President Grant was referring to in that little story about 
Brother Farrell. I have heard him tell that before and it is very 
striking. It is circulation of the blood that feeds the body. It is cir- 
culation of money that feeds the body of finance, and we cannot get 
along as a community and be as great, wealthy, and strong as we 
would be if we would circulate what we have. 

THE PRIESTHOOD ENTITLED TO INSPIRATION. 

We have met here, my brethren and sisters, to worship God, the 
true and living God, and I feel that he will accept our offering. I 
feel that he is here by the presence of his Holy Spirit, that he is 
here in the presence of these good men who have been laboring 
in the various stakes of Zion and the wards of the bishoprics, and 
in the mission fields. In their personality, there is the spirit and 
power of God and authority in the holy Priesthood to minister in 
the name of the Lord. What a great influential body there is here 
today in this congregation ! I realize it, I feel it. I believe in it with 
all my heart, and I know that this power that God has revealed in 
the latter days and which is sent down out of heaven upon the earth 
for the salvation of mankind is a reality, and we, all of us, can have 
it to the extent of the authority to which we are ordained. Every man 
ordained to any office in this Priesthood is entitled to the spirit and 
power of that office, and he can have it if he will live in accordance 
with that which it teaches, if he will live in accordance with the 
inspiration that it brings, for the Spirit of God whispers to the soul 
of man, and he can know the "still small voice." It doesn't come 
always in great manifestations. 

REMEMBER THE LORD BOTH IN JOY AND SORROW. 

I am pleased when people have definite manifestations, no matter 
how material they seem to be. I believe there is a good deal of thinking 
on these things in the world, and sometimes in the Church. Imagina- 
tion goes a great way, sometimes, but there is a link between every 
man ordained to the Priesthood and his God, and that link ought not 
to be sundered, it ought not to be weakened. We should live in 
harmony, in union, in communion, with him who is our living Head, 
and he will not forsake us either in days of trouble or pain or sick- 
ness or anything else. By the way, we ought not to leave our prayers 
and our devotions to the time of trouble and of sickness and difficulty, 
but go to the Lord when we are happy,, when our souls are full of 
joy and gladness, for he loves a cheerful countenance. He does not 
like very loud, noisy laughter — he says that is sin, but he likes to 



PRESIDENT CHARLES W. PENROSE 21 



see a "cheerful countenance," when people come to worship him in 
the beauty of holiness, with a smile upon their faces and gladness in 
their hearts. Let us not forget the Lord when we are glad, when we are 
happy, and go to him and with all our hearts thank and praise his 
holy name for the mercies we enjoy, for we are a blessed people. 

WE ARE WONDERFULLY BLESSED AS A PEOPLE. 

Separate and apart from all these blessings that pertain to the 
affairs of the holy Priesthood and to the congregations of the Saints 
when they meet to partake of the sacrament and to worship God, 
as a community, we are blessed wonderfully when we come to compare 
our conditions to that condition which we had in the days referred 
to by President Grant. I couldn't help thinking, this morning, about 
a little thing that occurred in the ward that I belonged to once. I 
shan't tell where it was- And that was in those days of scarcity ; when 
we wanted to have a dance. The. boys usually contributed some tallow 
candles to be placed on the ward house walls for lights. One evening 
some of the girls took the notion that they ought to be up with "out- 
side" customs which required waxed floors. So they used some of the 
candles and "waxed" the floor with tallow, and you can guess what 
was the condition some of the girls were in when they slipped down 
on the floor with their nice best dresses on. But this illustrates the 
kind of straits to which we were put at that time, and those early 
days are right before my m'ind, and ,1 can contrast them with the 
conditions which surround us at present. Here we are blessed of the Lord 
financially, temporally ; we have better homes, we have better clothes — 
I don't say that they are better than the home-made, mind you ; I 
endorse what Brother Grant has said about home manufacture — and 
we are blessed very abundantly, and should be filled with gratitude 
for these blessings, these good things we have. The Saints are able 
to come up here from distant parts now with ease and comfort. In old 
times when I left home to come here a long distance, I came with an 
ox-team or sometimes on "Shanks' pony," and I rejoiced when I got 
here. But today our people are blessed with means of transportation 
which are so far ahead of the old ways that we should be filled with 
thanksgiving. Let us praise the Lord in our hearts and in our works, 
for that is the way to praise him. Our faith should be exhibited in our 
works. What there is to do in our accepted fields of labor at home or 
abroad should be done with all our minds and might and strength. 
"What thy hand doeth today," said the old preacher "do it with thy 
might." Yes, put your soul into your work, whatever it is, brethren 
and sisters, members of auxiliary societies as well as members of the 
different quorums of the holy Priesthood, and be willing and obed- 
ient, because it is the willing as well as obedient that are to get the 
fruits of the land. 

DETERMINE TO SERVE GOD AND KEEP HIS COMMANDMENTS. 

Now let us who are here together this morning make up our 
minds when we go back to our fields of labor, or respective abodes, to 



22 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



feel that we will serve our Father, that we will keep his command- 
ments, that we will walk in his ways, that we will unite with our 
brethren, that we will forgive our friends of their trespasses as we 
hope to be forgiven of ours, and that we will love the Lord and 
devote ourselves with all our might, mind and strength, and all the 
powers that we have and the means that come into our hands, to 
the building up of this Latter-day kingdom. It is the greatest thing 
on earth, brethren and sisters. It is the grandest thing that ever 
has graced this globe, and it will abide and continue, and will not 
perish or fall away, neither will it be trampled under foot, neither will 
it be overcome by the evil power. It will abide and continue to grow 
and increase and spread forth and some of us will live to see it, and 
if we don't live in the flesh, we will live out of the flesh, and we will 
learn about it. 

CROWNED WITH GLORY, IM MORTALITY, AND ETERNAL LIVES. 

President Grant spoke this morning about some of our good, 
faithful brethren passing away. They are not lost to this Church. 
They have gone where they ought to be. They will labor there as 
well as they labored here, in a different capacity perhaps, but they 
will labor for this same great cause and all the good men who depart 
from us and go behind the veil are engaged and organized, and are 
in the Latter-day work, and they will add to our strength, if we 
will live so that they can come nigh unto us, and the angels of God 
will be round about us, and our Father will administer unto us, and 
the power of his Spirit will increase in our souls, if we continue 
in well-doing to labor with all our mind, to build up this 
great kingdom on the earth. Christ is and will be at its head. He will 
be King of kings and Lord of lords, and every man who has labored 
with him and for him in this holy ministry will be crowned with 
glory and immortality and "eternal lives." That means more than 
life, more than mere existence, it means perpetual increase of pos- 
terity, worlds without end, and these blessings shall be ours if we 
will prove faithful to that which we have received of the Lord, and 
this is what we are for in the Church, every one of us, that is our 
duty, that is what we are on the earth for, to build up this Latter-day 
kingdom, to lead the inhabitants of the earth up to God, to bring 
them nearer to him so that they will be obedient in their hearts and 
be willing to obey his commandments and walk in his ways and be 
prepared for the glorious future that lies before them. 

BLESSINGS AND COUNSEL FOR THE LABORING AUTHORITIES. 

God bless you my brethren who are laboring in this great cause, 
presidents of stakes and counselors, bishops and counselors, teachers 
who visit among the people, carry with you a good spirit of comfort 
and peace, and joy, into the hearts of the Saints. Encourage all 
good things, encourage all people in well doing. Do not be too 
severe in censure but when it is necessary let it come from the proper 
source, from the proper authority, and when things are not moving 



PRESIDENT CHARLES W. PENROSE 23 



right, go to the proper authority. Don't jump over the heads of your 
bishops to presidents of stakes with little matters which ought not 
to come up to the presidency, but talk to the brethren where you are, 
and give them a chance to exercise their wisdom and judgment and 
discretion and the power of their priesthood, and let us labor together 
in union and concord and love, forgiving one another of our faults, 
overlooking what we can properly overlook, not being too severe, 
against the weak and faulty but act so that we will not practice nor 
encourage evil but act so as to make the Saints feel that we ourselves 
are devoled to the Lord, our eternal Father, as his sons and daughters, 
and that we are pledged to his service as long as we live on the earth 
in the flesh and then forever and ever. Amen. 

ELDER JOHN M. KNIGHT 

(President of the Western States Mission.) 

My brethren and sisters, I am very grateful for the privilege 
afforded me of bearing my testimony on this occasion. As President 
Grant was talking, I couldn't help but think of the words of one 
of our hymns : " W e are not ashamed to own our Lord, and worship 
him on earth. We love to learn his holy word, and know what souls 
are worth." 

I am very happy in having the privilege of laboring in the ministry 
and of declaring the gospel of repentance to the people of the world. 
I am very happy that we have no compromise to make with them ; that 
we are not ashamed of the message that we have to deliver to the people 
of the earth, that we really believe, with all our heart and soul, in the 
divine mission of Jesus Christ, that we have an abiding faith in him and 
in his ministry ; that he was in reality the Son of God, the Redeemer of 
the world, and that by and through him salvation and redemption shall 
come to all of God's children who are upon the earth. We are told in 
the scriptures that he that is ashamed of the Miaster, the Master would 
be ashamed of him. "Whosoever, therefore, shall be ashamed of me, 
and of my words, in this adulterous and sinful generation, of him 
also shall the Son of Man be ashamed, when he comieth in the glory 
of his Father with the holy angels." (Mark 8:38.) 

And I rejoice, my brethren and sisters, that we are not ashamed 
of our God and of Jesus Christ, the Redeemer of the world. I believe 
that the greatest mission the Latter-day Saints have is to proclaim 
that truth to- the children of men here upon the earth. 

In the Western States mission we have been very fortunate 
this year in reaching a great many people who are interested in our 
message. They have listened -to the testimony of the elders of Israel. 
The elders have taught unto them the plan of salvation. Hundreds 
have embraced the gospel. Many more than in years previous. We are 
happy in our work. We are glad to be engaged in its labor.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



I am glad that President Grant has referred to the fact that 
many of our young men who are laboring in the mission fields 
have been encouraged by people at home to believe that eighteen 
months, or thereabouts, constituted a full mission. Their friends at home 
have written and said that it was about time they returned. Some 
of the elders have reported to me that their friends have advised 
that, others having returned in so short a period, they too should 
return to their homes, and I am glad that President Grant has called 
this to the attention of the Latter-day Saints. Many of our young 
men are better prepared to preach at the expiration of eigh- 
teen months and do a great deal more good than they could 
prior to this time, and the last few months of their mission is of 
more worth to the cause than perhaps the first year of their experience. 
I rejoice that this word has gone forth to the Latter-day Saints, that 
our boys should remain in the service of the Master at least two 
years and from that to thirty months or three years, as the case may 
be. I was very happy to hear one of the presidents of the stakes 
say yesterday that a certain individual had come to him and asked 
that his son might be released, and wanted him to write a letter to that 
effect, and he said : "If you want the letter written, you would better 
write it yourself." If they would make a little extra effort the boy could 
remain and fill his mission- Our forces are very much depleted, my 
brethren and sisters. Many a young man has returned home, when I 
have felt in my heart that it was not a good thing for the young man, it 
was not a good thing for the cause ; and with a little extra effort 
released missionaries could have remained and accomplished their 
labors and brought souls to a knowledge of the truth. 

I pray that the blessings of our Father may attend the Latter-day 
Saints, that they may have power to keep the commandments of 
God, and those who have sons and daughters laboring in the mission 
field, that the way may be opened and means provided that they can 
keep them there until they have accomplished a full and complete mis- 
sion. 

May God help us to keep his commandments, all our days, 
I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

Choir and congregation sang, "High on the mountain top," 
and the closing prayer was offered by Elder Albert Olsen, Second 
Counselor in the Presidency of the Bighorn stake of Zion. 

Conference adjourned until 2 o'clock. 



AFTERNOON SESSION 

At 2 o'clock President Heber J. Grant stated to the large 
assembly that the choir and congregation would sing the hymn, 
"O ye mountains high." 



PRESIDENT ANTHONY W. IVINS 



25 



This was done with spirit, and the opening prayer was of- 
fered by Elder Taylor Nelson, President of Oneida stake of Zion. 

The choir and congregation sang the hymn, "Guide us, O thou 
great Jehovah." 

PRESIDENT ANTHONY W. IVINS 

I shall read, my brethren and sisters, from the seventeenth 
chapter of Isaiah, the twelfth verse : 

Woe to the multitude of many people, which make a noise like the 
noise of the seas; and to the rushing of nations,, that make a rushing like 
the rushing of mighty waters. 

The nations shall rush like the rushing of many waters; but God shall 
rebuke them, and they shall flee far off, and shall be chased as the chaff 
of the mountains before the wind,, and like a rolling thing before the whirl- 
wind. 

THE STORY OF THE IMPERIAL VALLEY. 

It was not until recent years that men realized that there 
existed, in the extreme south-eastern part of California, and ex- 
tending across the border line south into Mexico, a valley which, 
by the application of the intelligence of man, could be converted 
into a veritable empire, where before had existed only a desert 
waste. For ages it had lain there, a sun baked, unproductive land, 
avoided by the traveler, dreaded as a place where death from 
thirst awaited the unfortunate who might be caught in its toils. 

The great Colorado river flowed past it, but its life-giving 
current had never been diverted that the thirsty land might drink 
and live. 

Experienced engineers were called in for consultation, a great 
irrigation system was planned and finally developed, with the 
result that the Imperial Valley became one of the most pro- 
ductive in all our land, providing homes for many people. 

Then, one day, word was flashed to the people of the valley 
which threw them into a condition of consternation and confusion. 
The head gates which controlled the waters of the great river 
had given way, at the point of diversion, and a mighty flood 
was pouring into the basin of the extinct Salton Sea. This basin 
once filled, the flood would sweep on, and the Imperial Valley 
would become, what in the remote past it had been, the bottom 
of a sea. 

What was to be done to avert this disaster? The people did 
not abandon their homes and flee in confusion and terror, but 
with united front set themselves to the task of checking the on- 
rushing flood, and confining the raging waters to their proper 
channel. The Government, when appealed to, cheerfully responded, 
the railroads extended every aid in the effort put forth, again the 
engineers were called in, and as a result of the effort of these com- 



26 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



bined forces the flood was staid, the development of the valley 
continued, and the people, whose very existence had been threat- 
ened, remained in undisputed possession of their homes. It was 
from this incident that Harold Bell Wright obtained the material 
for his very interesting story, "The Winning of Barbara Worth." 

ITS APPLICATION. 

I have related this story because it appears to be applicable 
to the remarks which I desire, with the help of the Lord, to make. 
One hundred years ago the world was a barren waste so far 
as correct knowledge of God was concerned. His personality, his 
attributes, his purposes and hand-dealings with the children of 
men, both as they apply to the past, the present and the future, 
were misunderstood. The river of understanding had always flowed 
by, but no one appeared to realize that the thirsty earth was 
perishing for want of the life-giving influence of its current, until 
through the wisdom of an inspired engineer the waters of the 
river were diverted, and by the life-giving influence which flows 
from God, through the channel of his Priesthood, the desert waste 
began again to produce, and for nearly a century the Lord of 
the Vineyard has garnered much good fruit, and the people of the 
valley have dwelt in security and peace. 

HAVE THE PEOPLE BECOME CARELESS IN THEIR FANCIED SECURITY? 

In the meantime other streams have found their way into the 
channel of the river, streams coming from the summits of the 
storm swept peaks above, bearing in their current silt, and 
boulders, and up-rooted trees, which have converted the once 
quietly flowing current into a turbulent torrent, which is beat- 
ing against the diversion dam with well nigh resistless fury. 
Have the people of the valley become careless and indifferent in 
their fancied security? Do they appreciate the fact that even ce- 
ment will gradually wear away, and must be replaced? Do they 
realize that the abutments of the diversion dam are trembling 
under the pressure of the flood, and that if they once give way 
this great, turbulent river of humanity will rush in and engulf them? 
Let us see. 

Since my earliest recollection I have heard the men who have 
been chosen to direct the affairs of the Church and give counsel 
to its members testify that these valleys of the mountains, to 
which the Lord brought the people under the leadership of his 
servant and prophet, Brigham Young, was a choice land. A land 
which had been held in reserve, that an ensign might be raised 
here to which modern Israel would be gathered. That it was our 
heritage and should never be permitted to pass from our hands 
into the possession of strangers. That we should be, as far as pos- 
sible, an independent, self-supporting people, and above all else 



PRESIDENT ANTHONY W. IVINS 



27 



that we should keep ourselves clean and unspotted from the sins 
of the world, and free from the bondage of debt. 

A WARNING VOICE. 

I well remember a time when, in the county of the state where 
I was, for a number of years, assessor and collector, there was not a 
home or farm on which there was a mortgage, nor a dollar of bonded 
indebtedness. At the October conference, ten years ago, speaking from 
this pulpit, President Joseph F. Smith said: 

"If there is anyone here who is in debt, I would advise that when 
he goes home, and when I go home, too, we will begin with a 
determination that we will pay our debts, and meet all of our ob- 
ligations just as quickly as the Lord will enable us to do it. If there 
is anyone here who is intending to go into debt for speculation I 
would advise him to hesitate, pray over it, carefully consider it before 
he obligates himself by borrowing money, and going into debt. In 
other word's keep out of debt. That means me as well as everyone 
else." 

THE BURDEN OF THE GREAT WAR. 

I know of no way by which proper conclusions may be reached 
except by comparison. Let us see what our condition today as it 
applies to this question is, as compared with ten years ago. 

We have only recently, as you know, emerged from a great 
world war, tremenduously expensive, more so than any other war has 
been, a war, the direct cost of which amounts, according to the most 
conservative figures at my disposal, to two hundred billions of dol- 
lars, an amount almost beyond the conception of the human mind. 
There should be added to this, for material damage wrought, and 
for the loss in productive power of nine millions of men who have 
been killed and wounded, so that they are permanently disqualified 
for useful labor, another fifty billions of dollars at the least, so that 
the war has cost the world at least two hundred and fifty billions of 
dollars. 

This burden, of course, does not fall directly upon us. Still we 
are obliged to share it. We cannot deny the fact that whatever obli- 
gation has come to the world, as a result of the war, we are more 
or less affected by it. Our own national debt amounts to twenty-four 
billions of dollars, an amount, though small by comparison, is still be- 
yond our ordinary comprehension. The interest on this amount is 
about one billion of dollars. Of this debt, we, as citizens of the United 
States, must bear our proportionate part. 

i OUK LOCAL FINANCIAL CONDITION. 

Of more direct interest to us, because we alone are responsible 
for it, is the fact that our state, county and municipal indebtedness, 
including corporation bonds, realty mortgages, bank loans and dis- 



28 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



counts, as near as I have been able to obtain them, and I think the 
figures are under rather than above the facts, amount to more than 
one hundred and seventy-three million seven hundred and twenty- 
one thousand dollars. This amount the people of the state must pay. 
Calculating the interest at seven per cent, which I regard as con- 
servative^ they must pay twelve million, one hundred and forty 
thousand dollars every year in interest, and besides that we know 
that the debt itself must be ultimately redeemed. 

THE WARNING VOICE UNHEEDED. 

The value of Utah farm lands and improvements, as reported 
by the United States Census Bureau for 1920, is eighty-four million 
five hundred seventy-eight thousand one hundred and ninety dollars. 
That is valuing these farms at four times as much as they were 
valued at ten years ago, at the time the conference to which I have 
referred was held. These farms are mortgaged today for twenty-four 
million, three hundred thirty-four thousand, six hundred thirty-six 
dollars, according to government reports which have been furnished 
me from Washington. Ten years ago these same farms were mort- 
gaged for four million, five hundred sixty-four thousand, one hundred 
seventy-five dollars. 

Now if it is true that our farms have increased in value four 
hundred per cent during the past ten years, the condition is not so 
alarming, but if it is a. fact that the value of our farms has de- 
preciated in proportion as other securities have during the past 
three years, they are mortgaged for far more than their real value. 

It appears, then, that the voice of the servant of the Lord fell 
upon deaf ears, so far as the people at large are concerned. There 
were some, it is true, who saw the coming of the flood and pre- 
pared to meet it. 

The Lord has said that preceding the coming of the Son of 
man, in the dispensation in which we live, conditions would be as 
they were in the days of Noah. He warned the people of coming 
disaster, pleaded with them to enter into the ark with him, and be 
saved, but they laughed him to scorn, and refused to prepare, by 
repentance from their wickedness, for the deluge which he declared 
would come. 

WHERE THE BONDAGE OF DEBT FALLS. 

I know of no other factor which has had such potent influence, 
in the dissolution of nations which have flourished and passed away, 
as has the bondage of debt. When nations become debtors the only 
means of providing revenue with which to meet their obligations 
is by taxation. This burden falls heaviest upon the masses, the com- 
mon people, who are the producers of the indispensable necessities 
of life. 

The men who till the soil, who tend the flocks and herds, who 



PRESIDENT ANTHONY W. IV INS 



29 



dig from the earth the treasures which are hidden there, the men 
who take the raw materials which are provided by nature and con- 
vert them into the things which man requires for his convenience and 
comfort, who are real producers, they are the people who do the 
world's work, fight the world's battles, and pay the world's taxes. 

I know there are those who will not agree with me in this 
statement, and I shall not discuss it with them at this time, only 
to say that I have given the subject as careful study as I am capable 
of doing, and have concluded that commerce, the professions, and 
the great industrial systems of our country find means by which 
the burden of taxation may be shifted until in the last analysis it 
falls heaviest on the classes to which I have referred. 

AVOID MORTGAGING THE HOME. 

My remarks are directed more particularly to my brethren who 
are engaged in agricultural pursuits. Israel has always been an agri- 
cultuul and pastoral people. We are told that about fifty millions 
of dollars of our securities are now in the possession of the Federal 
Reserve Bank. The past we cannot well remedy, but we can, so far 
as the future is concerned, profit by its experiences. I feel that every 
mother of a family is entitled to a home, to shelter her and her 
children, upon which there is no mortgage, and I plead with my 
brethren to keep mortgages from their farms and homes so far as 
it is possible. 

WHAT CAUSED THE DISRUPTION" OF THE KINGDOM OF ISRAEL? 

It was the burden of debt, and excessive taxation which accom- 
panies it that caused the disruption of the great kingdom of Israel. 
At the death of Solomon, during whose reign Israel rose to the 
zenith of her power and glory, his son Rehoboam succeeded to the 
throne of David. And the people came up and said to him, Thy 
father made our yoke grievous, now therefore make thou the grievous 
service of thy father, and the heavy yoke which he put upon us 
lighter, and we will serve thee. The old men of the kingdom, men 
of experience, who were in sympathy with the people who made 
the petition, advised the young king' to accede to this demand, but 
the young men, the companions of his youth, said, No ; these old men 
are too conservative, they are not progressive, the glory and pres- 
tige of our court must be maintained, regardless of cost, these people 
are the subjects of the king; if they persist, we will go against them 
with our organized forces, and will subject them to the discipline 
of the state. 

The result was that when the people returned for an answer to 
their appeal the king said: Whereas, my father placed heavy burdens 
upon you, I will make them heavier; if he made your yoke heavy 
I will add to your yoke, my little finger shall be thicker than my 
father's loin. 



30 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



It was the fatal word which ruined the kingdom, for the people 
with one voice cried out, To your tents, O Israel, now look to thine 
own house, David. From that moment the decadence of Israel began. 

ENSLAVEMENT OF THE PEOPLE CAUSED BY THE BONDAGE OF DEBT 

I know of no better example of the inevitable consequence which 
follows the bondage of debt, than that recorded in Genesis, and it 
is the first example, so far as I am aware, where monopoly of the 
necessities of life resulted in the enslavement of the people. 

AN EXAMPLE FROM THE SCRIPTURES. 

There had been seven years of bounteous harvest in Egypt, 
during which time the people had done, as they always do, as we have 
done, in time of plenty, lived extravagantly, believing that prosperity 
would continue, and had neglected to make provision for changed 
conditions which were to come. There were far seeing men, as there 
always are, who were ready to take advantage of the knowledge 
which they possessed, and become the creditors of the people. Permit 
me to read : 

And there was no bread in all the land; for the famine was very sore, 
so that the land of Egypt, and all the land of Canaan fainted by reason of 
the famine. 

And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land 
of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the corn which they bought, and 
Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh's house. 

And when money failed in the land of Egypt, and in the land of 
Canaan, all the Egyptians came unto Joseph and said, Give us bread: for 
why should we die in thy presence? for the money faileth. 

And Joseph said, Give your cattle; and I will give you for your cattle, 
if money fail. 

And they brought their cattle unto Joseph, and Joseph gave them 
bread in exchange for horses, and for the flocks, and for the cattle of the 
herds, and for the asses, and he fed them with bread for all their cattle 
for that year. 

When that year was ended, they came to him the second year, and 
said unto him: We will not hide it from my Lord how that our money 
is spent; my Lord also hath our herds of cattle; there is naught left in 
the sight of my Lord but our bodies and our lands. 

Wherefore shall we die before thine eyes, both we and our land? Buy us 
and our land for bread, and we and our land will be servants unto Pharaoh, 
and give us seed that we may live and not die, that the land be not desolate. 

And Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh for the Egypt- 
ians sold every man his field, because the famine prevailed over them; so 
the land became Pharaoh's. 

* * * 

Then Joseph said unto the people: Behold I have bought you this 
day and your land for Pharaoh, lo here is seed for you, and ye shall 
sow the land. And it shall come to pass in the increase, that ye shall 
give the fifth part unto Pharaoh, and four parts shall be your own. for* 
seed of the field, and for food and for them of your households, and 
for food for your little ones. 

From that day until the present the common people of Egypt, 



PRESIDENT ANTHONY W. IVINS 



31 



the Fellahin, have tilled the soil as the tenants of royalty, the priests, 
and the military class, their masters. 

It will be urged, and I admit the truth of the contention, that 
by the conservation of the resources of the country the lives of the 
people were saved, but how much better it would have been had 
these people been warned in advance, and being governed by the 
warning, conserved their own resources, instead of permitting them 
to pass into the hands of those who produced nothing, and then buy- 
ing back, at exorbiant prices, that which they themselves had brought 
forth, paying for it with their own persons, their lives, and liberty. 

IMPORTANCE OF THE OWNERSHIP OF LAND, DANGER OF BORROWING. 

The great importance attached to this condition of debt, and the 
ownership of land upon which people live, is illustrated in the law 
given by the Lord, for the government of ancient Israel. Under this 
law it was impossible to transfer the title to land from the original 
owner, who had received it as a heritage, to the permanent possession 
of another. It might pass temporarily into the hands of strangers, 
but at the lapse of fifty years, when the great jubilee came, amid 
rejoicing and thanksgiving, the land reverted to the original owner, 
or his heirs, and another opportunity was given for independent 
existence. We have no such guarantee, once our heritage passes from 
US, it can only be recovered by infinite toil, and too often, not at all. 

I do not wish to be understood to mean, by my remarks, that 
debt should never be incurred. That no circumstance can justify the 
borrowing of money, but I do say without hesitation that it is better 
never to be in debt, that it would be better never to borrow money, and 
I wish to warn my brethren and sisters of the danger which confronts 
us because of the great burden of debt which we are saddling upon our 
backs, and the backs of our children, a burden under which I fear 
they will faint, and fall by the way. 

HOW THE PREVAILING CONDITION CAN BE MODIFIED. 

There is no doubt in my mind that this condition can be greatly 
modified, if not entirely relieved, by returning to the fundamental 
principles of economy and simplicity of life which characterized the 
early-day administration of the affairs of both the State and the 
Church. I do not mean by this that we are to return to the methods 
employed by our fathers, but that we cease the unnecessary expendi- 
ture of money, as it applies to our every-clay life. That we think less 
of pleasure, and more of the development of the work of the Lord. 
That we live within our means, and cease the frantic struggle for 
riches, which is taking hold upon us like the tentacles of an octopus. 

Paul, writing to Timothy and foreseeing the conditions which 
would exist in the day in which we live, said: "This know also, that 
in the last days perilous times shall come. For men shall be lovers 
of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedi- 



52 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



ent to parents, unthankful, unholy, highminded, lovers of pleasure 
rather than lovers of God — from such turn away. 

PERTINENT QUESTIONS FOR THE PEOPLE TO ANSWER. 

I have recently asked myself the questions : Are we gravitating 
toward this condition? Have we become pleasure seekers to the ex- 
clusion of our duty to the Church? Do automobiles, resorts, moving 
pictures and other sources of pleasure absorb our minds until we forget 
the obligation we are under to God, and our brethren and sisters 
in the Church? Do we needlessly waste money in the gratification 
of our love for pleasure and excitement, while our brethren are strug- 
gling in poverty and want? I leave you to answer the question. 

Do not understand me to advocate that people are not entitled 
to, and should not have, wholesome legitimate recreation and amuse- 
ment, I mean no such thing. It is the excess in these things to which 
I refer, and particularly to amusements the character of which are 
calculated to lead people away from the fundamentals of morality 
and virtue. 

CONCLUSIONS BASED ON THE WORD OF THE LORD IN THE BOOK OF 

MORMON. 

I suppose I shall be accused of being a pessimist, I suppose men 
will say that I am knocking business, and taking a gloomy view of the 
present, and the future which is before us. That I should say to you 
that times are good, that business is rushing, that better times are 
coming, that we should eat, drink and be merry, for the future is 
laden only with hope. Again let me read, briefly, from the word of 
the Lord, for it is upon his word that my conclusions are based. I 
read from the Book of Mormon: 

O the wise, and the learned, and the rich, that are puffed up in 
the pride of their hearts, and all those who preach false doctrines,, and 
all those who commit whoredoms, and pervert the right way of the Lord, 
wo, wo, wo be unto them, saith the Lord God Almighty, for they shall 
be thrust down to hell. 

Wo unto them that turn aside the just for a thing cf naught and 
revile against that which is good, and say, That is of no worth; for the 
day shall come that the Lord God will speedily visit the inhabitants of 
the earth; and in that day that they are fully ripe in iniquity, they 
shall perish. 

But behold, if the inhabitants of the earth shall repent of their 
wickedness and abominations, they shall not be destroyed, saith the Lord 
of Hosts. * * * 

For the kingdom of the devil must shake, and they which belong 
to it must needs be stirred up unto repentance, or the devil will grasp 
them with his everlasting chains, and they be stirred up to anger, and 
perish. 

For behold, at that day shall he rage in the hearts of the children of 
men, and stir them up to anger against that which is good. 

And others he will pacify, and lull them away into carnal security, that 
they will say: All is well in Zion; yea, Zion prospereth, all is well — and thus 
the devil cheateth their souls, and leadeth them away carefully down to hell. 



PRESIDENT ANTHONY W. WINS

And behold, others he flattereth away, and telleth them there is no 
hell, and he sayeth unto them: I am no devil, for there is none — and thus 
he whispereth in their ears, until he grasp them with his awful chains, 
from whence there is no deliverance. * * * 

Therefore, wo be unto him that is at ease in Zion! 

Wo be unto him that crieth, all is well! Yea,, wo be unto him that 
hearkeneth unto the precepts of men, and denieth the power of God, 
and the gift of the Holy Ghost! * * * And in fine, wo unto all those who 
tremble, and are angry because of the truth of God! 



LET US NOT BE DECEIVED, BUT FAITHFULLY DISCHARGE OUR DUTIES. 

I trust, my brethren and sisters, that this scripture has no appli- 
cation to us; that we are not being deceived in the thought that all 
is well in Zion ; that the Lord will take care of his ,work without ef- 
fort on our part; that it is no longer necessary that we pray to the 
Lord, and put our trust in him, as our fathers have done, that we 
may with safety relapse into a condition of fancied security, in the 
belief that Satan, the enemy of God, and all that is good is no longer 
striving for the mastery; that our tithes and offerings are no longer 
necessary in the development of the work of the Lord ; but let us rather 
ponder the words of Malachi, which were quoted by Moroni to Joseph 
Smith, and, returning to the Lord in faith and works, have the as- 
surance that he will return to us, and opening the windows of heaven 
pour out blessings upon us until there will not be room to contain them. 

May the Lord help us all to comprehend the past, and profit by 
the lessons which it teaches, have understanding of the present, and 
faithfully discharge the responsibilities which devolve upon us, that 
we may be prepared for the great future which is before us, is my 
humble prayer. 

A PRAYER FOR THE WATCHMEN ON THE TOWERS OF ZION. 

That my brethren who are the presidents of stakes, bishops of 
wards, and who preside over the auxiliary organizations of the Church, 
may all be awake to the fact that the flood of the great river, made 
filthy with the sins of the world, is beating upon the head gates of 
the Church, and realizing the danger, stand as watchmen upon the 
towers of Zion should stand, watchful and unafraid, that the gates 
may be kept strong and firm, and the muddy waters be confined to 
their proper channel, is my hope and prayer, through Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 

Sister J. P. Shaw sang a solo, "Come, ye blessed of my 
Father."

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



PRESIDENT RUDGER CLAWSON 



Brothers and sisters, I ask an interest in your faith and sympathy 
while I stand before you. We are gathered here, a great body of 
Latter-day Saints, to worship God the Father and Jesus Christ the 
Son, and to lift up our voices in thanksgiving and praise for the! many 
blessings which we enjoy — to lift up our voices by prayer and testimony 
and exhortation and the voice of melody. 

SACRIFICE AND BURNT OFFERINGS TYPICAL OF THE ATONEMENT OP 



The Lord Jesus Christ has wrought out for us a great salvation 
by the shedding of blood. The atonement is many times referred 
to in the holy scriptures of both the Old and the New Testament; 
and, in fact, in the very beginning this important matter was empha- 
sized. When Adam and Eve were thrust out of the Garden 
of Eden the Lord commanded them to worship him and to offer 
the firstlings of their flock upon an altar of sacrifice.. Adam 
was obedient to the commandment. Later an angel appeared to 
him and asked him why he was offering sacrifice, and he answered 
and said: "I know not, only that the Lord commanded: it." And then it 
was that the angel explained the matter in very striking language. 
This is what he said, as recorded in the Pearl of Great Price: 

"This thing is a similitude of the sacrifice of the Only Begotten Son 
of the Father, which is full of grace and truth. Wherefore thou shalt do 
all that thou doest in the name of the Son,, and thou shalt repent and call 
upon God in the name of the Son forever." 

Isaac was offered upon an altar of sacrifice by his father Abra- 
ham, and it seems that this was intended to test his faith and 
obedience. He readily responded, but the Lord would not suffer 
him to lay his hand upon the boy. Surely this offering of Abraham 
was typical of the great offering made by God himself, for it is 
said in the record that, God soi loved the world that he gave his 
Only Begotten Son that whosoever believeth in him should not 
perish, but have everlasting life. 

Let me remind you that there was a deep significance in the 
burnt offerings of the children of Israel in the Wilderness and 
in Palestine, because it was through these burnt offerings that 
the children of Israel obtained forgiveness of their sins, for the 
burnt offerings were typical of the great atonement that would be 
made by the Lamb of God in later years. 

Isaiah, the Prophet, that mighty man of ancient times, speaks 
of the atonement in a very beautiful and expressive manner. Listen 
to the language of the Seer : 

"But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised > for our 
iniquities; the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes 
we are healed. 



CHRIST. 



PRESIDENT RUDGER CLAW SON 35 



"All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his 
own way; and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all. . . . 

"He was taken from prison and from judgment: and who shall de- 
clare his generatons? for he was cut off out of the land of the living: for 
the transgression of my people was he stricken. . . . 

"He shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied: by his 
knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many; for he shall bear their 
iniquities. 

"Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he shall 
divide the spoil with the strong; because he hath poured out his soul unto 
death: and he was numbered with the transgressors; and he bare the sin 
of many, and made intercession for the transgressors." 

And the subject is also referred to in the book of Revelation, in 
chapter five, where reference is made to the Savior of the world: 

"And they sung a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to take the book, 
and to open the seals thereof: for thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us 
to God by thy blood out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and 
nation." 

In the meridian of time the Lord required of his people 
a broken heart and a contrite spirit, and he introduced the sacra- 
ment saying: 

"And the Lord took the bread and gave thanks and blessed it, and he 
gave unto them saying: This is my body which is given for you. This do in 
remembrance of me." 

"Likewise also the cup after supper, saying: 

"This cup is the new testament in my blood which is shed for you." 

REQUIREMENTS OF THE LATTER-DAY SAINTS CONCERNING THE ATONE- 
MENT. 

And so, my brethren and sisters, it is in the dispensation of 
the fulness of times, for the Lord requires of us a broken heart 
and a contrite spirit, and the sacrament, which is regarded by 
the Church as a most holy ordinance, is again restored to the 
people of God. We are commanded to come together often and 
partake of the sacrament, in rememberance of him, of his suffering 
and death. Oh, how important is this subject. Again in one of the 
great revelations of the Lord to the Prophet Joseph Smith, and 
to the people of the Church, the Lord refers to this subject in a 
most touching and beautiful manner. Give ear, brethren and sisters, 
to these words which were uttered by revelation, in 1831 : 

"Hearken, O ye people of my Church to whom the kingdom has been 
given. Hearken ye and give ear to him, who laid the foundations of the 
earth; who made the heavens and all the hosts thereof, and by whom all 
things were made which live and move and have their being. And again 
I say, hearken unto my voice, lest death shall overtake you in an hour when 
you think not, and summer shall be past and the harvest ended and your 
souls not saved. Listen to him who is the advocate with the Father, who 
is pleading your cause before him, saying: Father behold the sufferings 
and death of him who did no sin in whom thou wast well pleased. Behold 
the blood of thy Son which was shed, the blood of him whom thou gavest 



36 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



that thyself might be glorified. Wherefore, Father, spare these my brethren 
that believe on my name, that they may come unto me and have everlast- 
ing life." 

THE ATONEMENT OF CHRIST THE SUPREME SACRIFICE. 

These passages which I have read, and many more that occur 
in the Holy Scriptures, give us to understand that the atonement 
made upon Mount Calvary was the supreme sacrifice ever made 
in all the world. Oh, the height and the depth of divine love, the love 
of God for his children here upon the earth! We are put under 
an obligation that we never can repay in this life or in the life 
to come. The greatness' of this sacrifice cannot be measured, 
cannot be fully understood by mortal man ; but, nevertheless, we 
can get the benefit of it by faith and obedience to the command- 
ments of God. That is what he requires, and I was going to say 
how simple it is to keep the commandments of God, and yet it may 
not be so simple, and it may not be so easy, because Satan very well 
knows the mark of our high calling, and he is seeking continually 
to lead away the Saints of God from the path of rectitude and from 
the path of life, but after all, my brethren and sisters, through 
faith and prayer and diligence, we will surely prevail. 

May the Lord bless us to that end, may he give us a greater 
and a wider conception of the atonement wrought out by his beloved 
Son, I humbly ask it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. 



ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH 

I am indeed in a frame of mind this afternoon that I desire the faith 
and prayers of this vast congregation, that the Lord will bless me 1 that 
I may say such things as will be profitable to all. 

MISSION CONDITIONS IN EUROPE. 

This is the first time I have had the privilege of being with you for 
more than two years, and during that time I have visited the countries 
of Europe where the Latter-day Saints have established missions. Dur- 
ing my absence there has not been much change in conditions in the 
European field except that the way has again been opened in some na- 
tions for the elders from America to enter and' preach the gospel. The 
same opposition exists in most countries to the teaching of the truth by 
our missionaries, but we have not been molested or seriously hampered 
in any place. Quite a change has occurred in Germany, in that our 
missionaries are made welcome, our congregations are so large that the 
meeting places are taxed to their capacity, and in some of the cities we 
have two congregations. Most of the work in Germany is being ac- 
complished by local elders, about one hundred in number, with not to 
exceed six missionaries from America. Norway, Sweden and Denmark 



ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH 



37 



have limited the number of missionaries allowed to enter there. Norway 
has only one missionary from home, at the present time, and no more are 
permitted to enter. Prest. August Schow has labored there with the as- 
sistance of a few local men during the past two years. During the first 
year I was in Great Britain, our missionary force consisted of twelve 
elders from home, three sisters and a few good local men who rendered 
assistance. Tracting and other work of that kind was done by women 
in many places under the presidency of Elder George F. Richards, 
and that continued till about a year ago, when elders began to arrive 
from Zion, and today there are over one hundred missionaries from 
this land laboring in the British Isles. Some of the local missionaries 
were excellent men, and rendered splendid service. 

All of the elders were withdrawn from South Africa, many of 
them serving long-term missions. President Nicholas G. Smith and 
his family, consisting of a wife and three sons, remained there nearly 
eight years, and were succeeded about eight months ago by President 
J. Wyley Sessions who took with him his wife and two children. 
South Africa has opened her doors to our missionaries, and others will 
be sent now as rapidly as possible to continue the work in that land. 

Holland is a fruitful field and Switzerland has many excellent 
branches of the Church. Our difficulty is that millions of people 
in all parts of the world have been deceived and made to believe 
that we are a wicked people. Evil stories have been circulated about us 
and those falsehoods have gained ground and have been given credence 
by many intelligent men and women. The adversary has sown the 
seeds of suspicion and hatred against the Church, and but for that 
reason our missionaries would be made welcome in every land. 

PREJUDICES AGAINST OUR MESSAGE TO THE WORLD SOMEWHAT ALLAYED. 

We are teaching the same gospel that the Savior taught, and the 
same influences that opposed him and his associates is potent in the 
world today. The adversary is determined that the gospel of Jesus 
Christ shall not be taught in its purity. We have the truth, and he 
knows that we have it, and he knows that millions of our Father's 
children would accept it gladly if they could hear it with unprejudiced 
minds. 

If we have the opportunityy to visit with intelligent men and 
women with sufficient time to explain our mission in the world, 
prejudice that has existed in their minds is dissipated and they are 
more friendly to the truth. The missionaries of this Church have 
gone into those lands to teach the gospel of Jesus Christ as it is 
recorded in the Holy Scriptures. They have desired to bestow a bless- 
ing on the people, and have endeavored to inspire hope, courage, and 
faith in the children of our heavenly Father, whose minds have been 
darkened because of the absence of the gospel in its purity. 

The prejudice that has existed against us in the past has in 



38 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



large mesaure been dissipated and hundreds and thousands of men 
and women have been made aware of the labor we are performing, 
but there still remains a feeling, and a determination, on the part 
of the leaders of some of the churches of the world, to prevent, if 
possible, the promulgation of the gospel of our Lord, as revealed 
in this latter day. Our problem is to find a way whereby we may 
present to all the people the gospel of our Lord. It is our problem, 
and with divine assistance we will find a way to solve it. It is 
incumbent upon us to ascertain if there is not some means whereby 
we may be able to do more than we have already done, if we would 
satisfy the requirements of our heavenly Father. 

FAMINE IN THE WORLD FOR THE WORD OF GOD. 

I congratulate the Latter-day Saints who have sons in the mission 
field. I have met many of them and they are splendid, humble, prayer- 
ful men, .vho are desirous of doing something to improve the condi- 
tions of the world and to teach mankind to prepare for 1 the world to 
■come. 

There is no reason why all the children of men should not be 
provided with the necessities of life, if the products of the earth were 
equitably distributed, and they could be more evenly divided, if men 
would turn to the Lord and keep his commandments. 

1 here is a real famine in the world for the words of the Lord, 
and many honest 'souls are earnestly seeking to know 'what our 
heavenly Father desires of them. I have met a number of the leaders 
of the churches of the world, and have found among them noble 
characters devoted to doing good, but I have rarely found among those 
who have been called to the ministry in the various church organiza- 
tions, men who have an understanding of the purposes of their being, 
or who realize why we are here in this world. Men cannot teach what 
they do not themselves know. These good men, not understanding the 
gospel and the necessity for the ordinances of the same, confine 
iheir teachings very largely to moral lessons and to reading the 
psalms to their congregations! 1 . 'Isolated passages of scripture are 
chosen as texts for addresses on virtue, honesty, etc., etc., all of which 
arc helpful and uplifting, but few sermons are preached explaining 
the requirements made of every soul before we can enter the kingdom 
of heaven. It is this information of which the world is most in need. 
Few ministers have a message for their congregations that inspires 
in them the belief in the divinity of Jesus Christ and the necessity of 
partaking of the ordinances of the gospel prescribed by him. 

THE FOUNDATION UPON WHICH WE BUILD OUR FAITH. 

1 believe that we have a duty to perform and we will have to 
labor more earnestly in the future than we have done in the p^st to 
discharge it, if we fulfil the requirements of our heavenly Father. 



ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH 



39 



The Lord has blessed us with a knowledge that he lives, and has a 
body, and that we are created in his image. We do not believe 
that he is some kind of essence or that he is incomprehensible. 
If you have received the witness that has come to me and 
know as I know that our heavenly Father has revealed himself to 
the children of men, that he is a personal God, that we are created in 
his 1 image, that our spirits were begotten by him, that he has given us 
an opportunity to dwell upon the earth to receive a physical tabernacle, 
in order that we may be prepared to return into his presence and live 
eternally with him, I say, if you have received that assurance, then 
you have a foundation upon which you may build your faith. Take 
that from you, the knowledge that God really lives, the assurance 
that Jesus Christ was the manifestation of God in the flesh, take 
from you the assurance that there will be a literal resurrection from 
the dead, and you will find yourselves in the condition that our 
Father's children are in throughout the world, and I ask you, what 
conifort remains to you then? These are the truths that are funda- 
mental. 

THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF THE GOSPEL SUPERIOR 1 TO ETHICS. 

The Redeemer of mankind was more than a good man who came 
into the world to teach us ethics. The Redeemer of mankind possessed 
more than ordinary intelligence. He was indeed the Son of God, the 
only begotten of God in the flesh. He was sent into this world to 
remove from the minds of men the delusion that had confounded them 
for many generations. He came to call men to repentance, to turn 
them from the error of their way. He went among them representing 
God the Eternal Father, proclaiming that he was in the image of 
his Father, and that those who had seen him had seen the Father, and 
told them that he had been sent to do the will of his Father, and 
called on all men to turn from the error that had crept in among 
them, to repent of their sins and go dowp into the waters of baptism. 
Following repentance there was something for them to do that was, 
and is, necessary to obtain salvation. Our brothers and sisters of the 
world in many cases do not believe that baptism is essential. They 
say it is an outward form of inward grace. If that were true, . then 
why was it necessary for the only perfect man who ever lived upon 
the earth to be baptized? When Jesus presented himself to John, at 
the waters of Jordan, and bade him baptize him, ; John replied : "I have 
need to be baptized of thee, and comest thou me?", to which the Savior 
responded: "Suffer it to be so now, for thus it becometh us to fulfil 
all righteousness." He did not say: "John, it is not necessary for me 
to be baptized, because I am the Savior of the world." He did not 
indicate that he thought it was unnecessary, but to him it was so 
important that he submitted himself to a mortal man possessing divine 
authority to preach repentance and baptism] for the remission of sins. 





40 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



There is no doubt in our minds that baptism is essential to salvation. 
Evidently the Redeemer of mankind believed- it was. He in whose 
name we hope to gain eternal exaltation, and through whom we hope 
for a glorious resurrection, who came into the world and laid down 
his life that we might live again, thought it was ''important and neces- 
sary, and yet there are. many of our Father's children who do not 
understand and do not believe that the Lord requires it of all men. 
The Scriptures contain several instructions regarding it. When the 
Savior sent his disciples out he said unto them : "Go ye into all the 
world and preach the gospel unto every creature." Was that all he 
required? That is what the man of today says who doesn't believe in 
the divine mission of our Lord. Even the ministers of many churches 
fail to emphasize the remainder of that same paragraph, but the 
Redeemer of mankind said : "Go ye into all the world, and preach the 
gospel unto every creature. He that believeth and is baptized shall be 
saved, but he that believeth not shall be damned." He didn't say that 
they might believe just 1 whatever they pleased. He didn't say that good 
intentions were sufficient. He didn't say, preach any gospel that you 
please, but he told them to preach his gospel and observe all the 
things he had commanded. He said : "And they that believe and are 
baptized shall be saved," but he didn't promise salvation to others. 
Our heavenly Father has made this clear to your understanding, my 
brethren and sisters, in this Church, and he will hold you responsible 
to teach it to others. You understand it and they do not. It is a duty 
of us all to see that it is made as plain as possible, and that the other 
ordinances of the gospel are taught to all men. 

NECESSITY OF TEACHING THE FIRST PRINCIPLES AND ORDINANCES OF THE 



The necessity of faith, repentance, baptism, and the laying on of 
hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost must be emphasized by us. 
Many leaders throughout the religious world claim authority to preach 
the gospel and yet; they do not believe that baptism and the laying on 
of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost are essential. The Lord has 
revealed to us the necessity of these ordinances. He has organized 
his Church in this day, and has conferred upon men divine authority 
and has commanded them,, as he commanded men of old, to preach the 
gospel in all the world. We are only a little handful of people 
among all our Father's children, but I want to say to you that I 
believe we are more numerous than the members of the Church were 
at the time our Savior was crucified. The mission devolving upon us 
is the same as that given to his disciples in Palestine when he sent 
them into all the world with the command to teach his truth, and our 
reception by mankind is the same. He told his followers that they 
would be hated for his name's sake, should be put out of the syna- 
gogues, and some should be put to death, and the hatred that had been 



GOSPEL. 



ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH 



41 



his portion would come upon them. The same persecutions have befal- 
len the elders of his Church in this latter day, as a result of teaching 
his truth. The same influences that sought to destroy the Church in 
the meridian of time, and finally overcame the men who held the 
holy Priesthood, are active in the world today — the same power that 
has tried to destroy every good man who has held the; Priesthood, from 
that time until the present. 

OUR DUTY TO THE WORLD OF MANKIND. 

Our brethren and sisters of the world do not understand, as you 
do, that there is an active Lucifer; they do not realize that there are 
evil spirits, tangible influences, abroad in the world, seeking to lead 
men to do the things that will deprive them of the Spirit of the Lord. 
You understand these things, and some of you have known by personal 
contact with the powers of evil how potent they are in this world. 
Our Father has given us the knowledge that this life is a probation, 
that we are building for the future, and how grateful we ought to be 
for this assurance, and Oh, how sad we would be if we thought that 
death terminated our career. If, when our life's labor on 'earth 
was finished, we had no opportunity to go on developing, there 
would be little to inspire us to live as we should heme. The knowledge 
that all the good we accomplish here, and all development we make, 
will enhance our happiness eternally, encourages us to do our best. 
Millions of our Father's children in the world do not understand that 
truth, but they have a right to know it. Our heavenly Father has 
commissioned us to take that message to the ends of the earth and to 
declare it in such a way that men must consider it, and either take 
advantage of it or be left without excuse. 

The Lord has not called the great Catholic church to perform 
this labor, nor the Methodist, nor the Presbyterian, nor the Baptist 
church. There are men in, all these churches that our heavenly Father 
loves because of their virtue and because of the good they are doing, 
but they have not been divinely appointed to officiate in the ordi- 
nances of the gospel. He has commissioned you for a special work. 
You have been ordained and had conferred upon you his holy Priest- 
hood. He has called you out of the world that you might unite 
in building Zion, and in disseminating his truth. Are you doing your 
full duty? Are you discharging the responsibility that has come 
upon you in return for your blessing? 

LET US FEAR THE BONDAGE OF INIQUITY AS WELL AS THE BONDAGE OF 

DEBT. 

We are a wonderfully blessed people, notwithstanding the fact 
that many are in the bondage of debt. I wish that were the onl)y> 
bondage. I fear many of the people of this great land are suffering 
much more from the bondage of iniquity. Many have need of 



42 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



repentance, and if those who have received the word of the Lord and 
a witness of the divinity of this work 'will set their houses in order, if 
they will teach their sons and daughters the way of eternal life, and 
exemplify the gospel of our Lord in their daily conduct, I have no fear 
of the financial outcome. Our Father in heaven has made a wonderful 
promise that has been realized in the nations of the earth. He said : 
"Seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness." Mind you, 
not last, but, "Seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, 
and other things will be added." There are those in this audience 
today whose parents came into this land in the depths of poverty, with 
scant clothing and no shelter, depending upon others for food to 
sustain life. They came seeking first the kingdom of God, and today 
their descendants live in comfortable homes, are educated in the best 
schools that there are in the World today, and enjoy surroundings 
that are ideal, as far as conditions in this world can make them so. 
They are honored among the children of mten, known for their virtue, 
for their strength of character and their intellectual power. I ask 
you if the promise of the Lord in many of these cases has not been 
fulfilled? Surely "all other things have been added." 

THE PROMISE OF ETERNAL LIFE CONDITIONAL. 

The promise of the Lord that we may enjoy eternal life is condi- 
tional. That is, w.e must serve the Lord our God with all our hearts, 
we must serve him by caring for his children, by blessing mankind 
.vherever our influence can be exerted to bring them into the marvel- 
ous light of the glorious gospel. We must impart of our temporal 
blessings as well as exert our spiritual influence for the uplift oif our 
fellows. I stand here today profoundly grateful for the knowledge 
that has come to me. I am thankful that I am not dependent upon 
any individual for the testimony that I possess. Of course, I am 
grateful for the encouragement I received from others who possess 
light and truth, and who give encouragement by lives of righteousness, 
but I do not depend on any of them for a knowledge that God lives, 
that Jesus Christ is the Redeemer of mankind and Joseph Smith 
is a prophet of the Lord. These things I know 1 for myself. 

I have been in the valley of the shadow of death in recent years, 
so near the other side that I am sure that for the special blessing of 
our heavenly Father I could not have remained here. But, never for 
one moment did that testimony that my heavenly Father has blessed 
me with become dimmed. The nearer I went to the other side, the 
greater was my assurance that the gospel is true. Now that my life • 
has been spared I rejoice to testify that I know the gospel is true, and 
with all my soul I thank my heavenly father that he has revealed it to 
me. 

I have been permitted to perform missionary work in different 
parts of the world, an opportunity that I gratefully accepted. I have 



ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH 



43 



been permitted to live with and associate most of my life with real 
Latter-day Saints, the best men and women that can be found in this 
world, and our Father knows how thankful 1 am for these blessings. 
I love my brothers and sisters, and I have affection for my Father's 
children who are not members of this Church, and inasmuch as he will 
give me physical strength and mental power, I desire to so order my 
life that I may be an uplift to all those with whom I come in contact. I 
desire to so exemplify the teachings of our I^ord, ami I presume 
all my brothers and sisters feel as I do, that when we stand in the 
presence of the Great King, after the labors of this life shall have 
been completed, and we answer to> him for the time that we have 
spent here on earth, that there will be none who can truthfully say 
we were careless about dividing the truth with any of our Father's 
children, that none will be able to say of us that we knew these things 
were true but made no effort to explain them to our neighbors. Surely 
we would be condemned if one of our associates in life should stand 
in the presence of the Great Judge and say of us that we could have 
taught him the gospel, if we had made an effort, but that because 
of our neglect he would be deprived of, a place in the celestial 
kingdom. Let none of us, my brethren and sisters, be justly accused 
in that way. Unto its much has been given, and of us much will be ex- 
pected by our Father in heaven. We cannot be indifferent to the teach- 
ings of the gospel, we must not drift down the stream, of life without an 
effort. Every day we should do something worth while. 

ARE WE GRATEFUL ? 

The Lord has revealed to us so many truths in this latter day 
that we are aware of, that we cannot plead ignorance, if we sin. 
Men have been commissioned with divine authority, our Father has 
organized his Church, and has placed in it the ordinances of the 
gospel, he has commissioned men to do the same work that the Savior 
and his disciples did in the Old World, and upon this western hemi- 
sphere, among the ancestors of the American Indians. The greatest 
blessings and opportunities of all times have been bestowed upon us, 
and the question that should arise in our minds for all these mercies is : 
Are we grateful? Are you, my brethren and sisters, thankful to the 
Lord for this knowledge that has come to you? Do you really 
appreciate what it means ? If you do, and desire that the Lord shall 
know that you appreciate it, then divide your blessings with his 
children. To his disciple of old the Savior said : "If you love me, then 
feed my sheep." Let. us render service to our Father's children, and 
let it be of such nature that others observing our good work will be 
constrained to glorify our heavenly Father. Let us sustain those whom 
God has called to presidei over us. Let our homes be the abiding place 
of the Spirit that comes from on high. Let us radiate an influence 
for peace and happiness among the children of men, so- that our lives 
will be happy here, and when we are summoned to the great beyond

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



we will be welcomed by those who have been our companions in life, 
and by our Father in heaven because of what we have done for his 
children. 

I am grateful to be home again, I thank you one and all for 
the companionship of the past, and hope that I may have the 
privilege of meeting you in your wards and in the stakes of Zion, and 
when I do that I may be favored of the Lord that through me yov 
may receive a blessing. I desire to cooperate with you to increase the 
power of this Church for good, not only at home, but throughout 
all the world, and I humbly pray to our heavenly Father that we may 
so order our lives that when our work here is completed we may 
obtain eternal life in his celestial kingdom and enjoy the companion- 
ship of those we love who have been our associates here on earth, 
and I ask it in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The congregation sang the hymn, "The Spirit of God like a 
fire is burning," and the meeting adjourned until 10 o'clock, Friday 
morning, the closing prayer being offered by Elder Henry W. 
Lunt, President of the Parowan stake of Zion. 



SECOND DAY 



The meeting began at 10 o'clock a. m., Friday, October 7, 
President Heber J. Grant, presiding. 

The choir and congregation sang, "Come, let us anew our 
journey pursue." 

Prayer was offered by Elder Sylvester Q. Cannon, President 
of the Pioneer stake. 

The choir and congregation sang, "Now let us rejoice." 

ELDER JOHN A. WIDTSOE 

My brethren and sisters, I feel very humble, indeed, to stand 
before you on this occasion,^ for, I recognize how very inadequate any 
man is who attempts, on these occasions, to do wholly the will of 
God ; but I desire to say to my brethren and sisters that I consider it 
a very high privilege, at any time, to be allowed to bear my testimony 
to the truthfulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ, as restored in these 
latter days by the Prophet Joseph Smith. I know, my brethren and 
sisters, that this is God's work. I know 1 that God lives; that he has 
instituted the great plan of salvation for the 'benefit of his children : 
that he is watching over us and that we may rest ourselves and our 
troubles on him and that he will lead us safely to the destined end. 
There is nothing in my life of greater value than this: testimony. There 
is no assurance in my life more certain than that this is the work of 
God, and I am happy, as I have said, to be allowed to bear this testi- 
mony to my brethren and sisters assembled. I feel tremendously the 
responsibility of standing before you. 

PEOPLE RESPONDING TO THE REQUIREMENTS MADE OF THE LORD. 

During the last three or four months, I have been allowed to 
visit nine or ten stakes of Zion, in conference and convention capacity 
assembled, and I have been greatly impressed by the abundance of 
the Spirit of God which prevails among the people throughout the 
stakes of Zion. I have marveled at the devotion and the faith of 
many whom I have met. It has warmed my heart to see the vigor 
with which the work of the Lord is being conducted by young and 
old. It is difficult for me to say which has impressed me most, the 
thorough devotion of those who are old in the cause, or the eagerness, 
of the young to take upon themselves the harness of the Lord to carry 
onward the work of the Church. I feel, my brethren and sisters, 
that while we may have many weaknesses — indeed I am sure we dO' 
have many weaknesses — and may need constant exhortation, advice 
and suggestions, such as 'we receive at these and other conferences 
throughout the Church, yet this people is so strong in faith and in 



46 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



good works that God has made us — and I praise him for it — good 
material with which to build this latter-day work. I believe the spirit 
of God is with this people, and that the people are responding,! perhaps 
in weak human ways, but are responding, to the demands and require- 
ments made upon us by our heavenly Father. 

A WONDERFUL FEAST AT THIS CONFERENCE. 

We have had set before us during the meetings of this con- 
ference a wonderful feast. Admonitions have been given, instructions 
presented, and doctrines taught, ranging from the very highest, if 
you so choose to call it, to the very lowest; from the highest spiritual 
truths to the common, every-day, material needs of man. It has always 
seemed to me that in no particular does this work more appear to be 
a marvelous work and a wonder than in the great body of knowledge 
which has been given through the instrumentality of the Prophet Jo- 
seph Smith and his successors in office. It must be a man of many 
troubles indeed who has sat through these two meetings of our confer- 
ence and has not found, in the words spoken, some key for the solution 
of his needs. As I understand the body of knowledge which has been 
given to this people by God, it is so vast and so comprehensive that 
it makes light the remotest corners of human needs. There is no place 
in the world, no condition of human affairs, which may not be made 
alive, really alive, by the knowledge which God has revealed in these 
latter days. 

Nevertheless, I am impressed to say, that although we have so 
wonderful a body of knowledge, the most known to any people 
on the face of the earth, yet knowledge of itself is a lifeless and unsat- 
isfactory thing. Every once in a while, as we journey through life, 
we. meet some man who is rich in knowledge, but uses his knowledge 
only as an ornament on his intellectual mantel-shelf simply to be 
looked at, to be enjoyed as an ornament and nothing more. There is 
no truth more certain in all the world, than that in order to make 
knowledge: — the things that have been taught us, of value, and really 
beautiful, and helpful in making our lives real living lives, knowledge 
must be put to some use. Knowledge unused is scarcely worth the 
having; but knowledge once used leaps into light and life and 
becomes a bright flame to guide and to help man. 

TWO CLASSES OF SCHOLARS. j 

, The question that has come before me continuously, during 
the two sessions of our conference, has been, as I have heard the 
instructions from the stand: "Will I be able so to apply these truths 
as to make them a living force in my life?" All humanity today may 
be classified, I suppose, into two great classes as far as knowledge 
is concerned — those who have knowledge and use it not, and those 
who have, perhaps, lesser knowledge anjd use it well Those 




ELDER JOHN A. WIDTSOE 47 

who use the knowledge are the ones who today are leading the world 
in every proper human activity. We have in our universities and 
colleges two great classes of scholars ; the non-productive and the 
productive scholar. We have the scholar who merely teaches what 
he has learned, and never attempts to use it. He is held in low 
esteem. We have the man, on the other hand, who believes in -using 
knowledge as it is given, to him, and he becomes a productive scholar. 
He carries onward the realm of knowledge, expands it, increases it, 
and becomes of great renown. 

However, there are many ways of using knowledge. To my 
mind the greatest manner of using knowledge, the eternal divine 
knowledge which we have and which we call frequently the gospel of 
Jesus Christ, is to use it in such a way as to benefit the whole human 
race. Many men use knowledge for their own sakes. That makes 
it of less value. Indeed I suspect that one real difference between 
religion and ethics is in the manner in which truth is used. When 
truth is used for all men, for the carrying out of some great scheme 
of salvation, such as God has provided, then knowledge has its noblest 
use and worth. When it is used only for a few, for me and my family 
and those near me, the religious element tends to disappear. 

ETHICS VS. A LIVING, VITAL RELIGION. 

I remember that, a few years ago, we had in this city a visit from 
three or four members of 'the Chinese republic, distinguished men who 
came here to study the gospel of Jesus Christ as taught by this 
people, for the express purpose of taking back to China, if they 
could, some of the conclusions that we had reached, for the upbuilding 
of the Chinese republic. I remember the question was put to one of 
them at one of our gatherings : "Do you not have in your country 
a sufficient amount of truth to guide you? Do you need to come 
to this far western land, and to this far western state, to this humble 
people, to gain information that will help you in building the new 
China of which you dream ?" And the wisest of them, an .old man, 
rich in the experiences of life, through his interpreter, said to the 
small company assembled : "We have in China a system, of ethics and 
that is all; we have no real religion. Our system of ethics is not so 
organized, does not have such life as to be of service for the whole 
people; and," said he, "the conclusion of four thousand years of 
Chinese civilization is that ethics will never save a people or make a 
people fully happy and contented. We need a living, vital religion." 

I am impressed always with the fact, as I think about these mat- 
ters, that the thing that gives us life and vigor, and makes us a 
peculiar people, different from all other people, that makes it possible 
for us to have 'such a great assembly twice a year as we have in this 
o-reat tabernacle, is that we do know a plan of salvation that enables 
us and requires us to use all our knowledge for all people of all time — 
past, present and future— and that we do this work by the authority 



48 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



of the Priesthood, which means simply that back of the plan and 
back of our efforts is a great, intelligent Will who has laid out the 
plan, who is carrying it onward, and whose agents we are in conduct- 
ing the work on earth. It is the Priesthood, my brethren and sisters, 
given to all honorable, faithful male members of the Church, the 
blessings of which the women share with their husbands, which gi^es 
us life, which makes this Church a living, growing Church and 
kingdom, which separates us, if you choose, from all other kingdoms 
on the face of the earth, from all other churches ; for no other organ- 
ization, so far as I know, makes the same claim in regard' to Priest- 
hood that we make. 



A PRIESTHOOD WITH A TRUE CONCEPTION OF GOD. 

i 

The conception of God held by any group of people may well 
be understood by the nature of the priesthood which that people 
respects. In fact, the priesthood of any people is really a definition 
of the God in which that people believes. If we find an impotent 
priesthood, a priesthood that dallies Sunday mornings, in the pulpit, 
with the vital issues of life, the chances are that that church also 
has a conception of an impotent God who also dallies, Sunday 
mornings, with the vital issues of life. If we find a vigorous 
priesthood which concerns itself with man's needs and life, day and 
night, from the week's beginning to the week's end ; which attempts 
to understand man, and to serve the every need of man, and which 
guides the conduct of man into large dreams of life ; then in all proba- 
bility the group of people sustaining such a priesthood has a concep- 
tion of a God who is real, a true Father of the men and wo- 
men of the earth, who teaches the brotherhood of man. 
The priesthood of this Church which deals with all the affairs, tem- 
poral and spiritual, of the members of the Church, is an evidence of 
our conception of God: God is our Father: we are his children: he 
understands us since he has had, perhaps, experiences similar to 
ours : he looks into our daily life, and unto him we can go day by 
day, with the common, ordinary troubles of life and lay them before 
him, feeling assured that the God we worship desires us to approach 
him in all things, and that he will answer our prayer, even though that 
prayer concerns itself with the humble, simple affairs of life. The 
grandest conception of "Mormonism" is' our conception of God. 
It was by divine purpose that the first great vision to the Prophet 
Joseph Smith was of the Father himself in person, who to the boy 
explained the order of things, and gave to the world again, forever, 
as I believe, the true knowledge of God. It was by divine purpose 
when the Prophet Joseph Smith was instructed as to the real con- 
dition in the world that necessitated the re-establishment of the 
Church and kingdom of God, that God said to the Prophet Joseph 
Smith : 



ELDER JOHN A. WIDTSOE 



49 



They have strayed from mine ordinances, and have broken mine everlast- 
ing covenant; 

They seek not the Lord to establish his righteousness, but every man walketh 
in his own way, and after the image of his own God, whose image is in the 
likeness of the world, and whose substance is that of an idol * * *. 

THE GREAT NEED OF THE WORLD IS A TRUE CONCEPTION OF GOD. 

The first great message of this latter-day work has been with 
respect to God, and my testimony to you is, my brethren and sisters, 
that the great need of the world today is a correct understanding 
of God. this world is in turmoil and strife. The old paths seem in- 
sufficient. Men are seeking new ways to solve new problems. They 
are looking for safe principles or guides which they can apply 
to these new problems and test proposed new solutions. The only 
path to peace and happiness is through the proper knowledge of God, 
including his plan of salvation ; and therein, and therein only, will the 
nations of the world find what they are seeking today. It is our duty to 
teach the word of God to the world. We shall have, as I view it, no 
real peace, no full satisfaction among the nations, until the knowledge 
of the true God is re-established and accepted among the nations 
of the earth. Many have made fun, in our day, of those who are 
seeking for God. H. G. Wells, the great novelist of England, has 
been ridiculed because, during the last few years, he has been seeking 
for God — a God he could understand and that his fellows could under- 
stand ; a God who could help the nations in their trials ; but I believe 
that H. G. Wells stands for a great group of men and women 
throughout the world who are God-hungry, who understand that the 
God they have been worshiping is incomplete, insufficient, mystify- 
ing and mysterious. They want a God, or a, conception of a God, who 
may be understood by plain and simple people; who undertsands 
humanity and who, in a measure, perhaps, is of humanity. 

May God bless us and help us to carry to the nations the great 
and wonderful truths we possess, and may we be given strength, 
from time to time, so to use the knowledge that we have, that it 
may burn as a living fire within our breasts, throughout this Church 
and before all the world, I ask it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 11 

ELDER GEORGE W. McCUNE 

(President of the 1 Eastern States Mission) 

My brethren and sisters, I have a high sense of appreciation for 
this privilege of standing 1 before you to bear my testimony ; and I sin- 
cerely desire to have the Spirit of the Lord to direct me ; to that end' 
I beseech of you, sustain me by your sympathy and your love. I have 
enjoyed more than I can tell you the remarks that have already 



50 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



been made during our conference. I feel that they are timely. They 
are those principles which we need to apply in our lives. I am glad 
that I have been considered worthy to be associated with these good 
men who are directing the work of the Lord in this day; that I 
have been called into the world to preach the gospel, for I know 
it is the gospel of our Redeemer, that has all the elements of salvation 
within it, that gospel which will save us, not only spiritually at some 
distant far off time, but now and forever. It will save us temporally, 
physically, intellectually and morally as well as spiritually, and I 
feel highly honored to be called of God to go into the world to pro- 
claim these glad tidings to my fellowmen. 

We are meeting with fair success in the Eastern States Mission. 
We are being handicapped for lack of sufficient help just now. We 
made a good start in many places, but had to withdraw our forces 
from a number of localities. This I regret very much. Therefore, I ap- 
preciate the remarks of President Grant to you regarding this matter, 
showing you the importance of allowing your sons and daughters 
to stay in the field as long as possible to the completion of their 
missions. They have been' called of the Lord and they will be released 
by the same authority in due time when you have done your part. O, 
my brethren and sisters, you cannot invest your means to a better 
purpose. You cannot invest them in a way that will bring you greater 
dividends than in sustaining your sons and daughters while they are 
proclaiming these glad tidings throughout the world. I beg of you, do 
your part and put your trust in God. Consult the bishop, as you have 
been instructed when you find it impossible to maintain your sons 
longer, and I believe you will find that the way will be opened up so 
you can sustain them until they have completed their misson. 

I know that this is the work of the Lord, and O, the joy this sweet 
.sentence gives : "I know that my Redeemer lives." It is the greatest 
blessing that has come into my life ; nothing else gives me so much 
pleasure as to bear testimony of this. I know that Joseph Smith is a 
Prophet of the living God, sent in the latter days again to establish 
in the earth the Church and kingdom of God ; and I wish I could 
burn that testimony into the hearts of all men with whom I come in 
contact, that they might partake of the joy that we experience in bear- 
ing witness of it, and the joy that it brings into my life every day. 
I cannot tell you how I know this. I know that I see you before me, 
and that is through the power of my mortal sense ; but I believe it is 
possible for the mortal sense to be deceived; but, my brethren and 
sisters, it is not possible to deceive that which is divine by which pow- 
er these glorious truths are revealed to my soul. It is true that Joseph 
Smith is a prophet of God, and that we have embraced the true gos- 
ple of our Redeemer, and if we only apply it to our lives w& will earn 
our salvation in God's kingdom. We are being saved now, not in the 
sense that the world understands it ; for they say we are saved, and 



ELDER GEORGE W. McCUNE 



51 



cannot sin, that there is nothing more to do. That is not true; it is a 
misunderstanding, as I see it ; but we are being saved just as fast as 
we apply to our lives the glorious principles of the gospel of our 
Redeemer. We are being saved temporally just as fast as we live 
the laws pertaining to our temporal salvation ; and if we continue 
therein we shall earn our salvation and exaltation in God's kingdom. 

I feel that I ought not to take more time this morning. I am 
glad I am here, and to bear testimony , of these things. My heart is 
filled with love for you, my brethren and sisters, and for the brethren 
who are directing the work of the Lord in the latter days. T realize 
it is an honor to be associated with them. T love them, and T too, sus- 
tain them by my faith and prayers and 1 hope also by my works. 
Brethren and sisters, let us be free in giving expression of our love 
in our daily lives. I sometimes think we are too backward in this mat- 
ter. I would rather have the expressions of your good will now than 
your bouquets upon my casket when I am gone. Let us be free in fac- 
ing our fathers arid mothers, putting our arms about them and telling 
them, face to face, that we love them. Let us greet our brothers and 
sisters cordially and whole-heartedly and tell them we love them 
and delight to be associated with them. This should bring to their 
hearts good cheer. 

Now, may the Lord bless you, my brethren and sisters. May his 
peace and blessings be with you in your homes, that you may apply 
in your lives the wonderful truths that have been spoken in our con- 
ference, is my sincere prayer, and I ask it in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER JOHN WELLS 

(Of the Presiding Bishopric of the Church.) 

I feel a deep sense of responsibility in trying to express my 
thoughts to this vast congregation of Latter-day Saints. The one 
thought above all others that has come to my- mind is how thankful 
I am to my heavenly Father that I am permitted to be a Latter-day 
Saint ; that I, as a member of the Church of God, have ian opportunity 
of mingling with you. How thankful I am, too, that the Lord permits 
me to hold the holy Priesthood, with the privilege of ministering 
among my brethren and sisters. I feel that a tremendous responsibility 
rests upon all who hold this Priesthood; that it shall be magnified 
righteously before our heavenly Father; that we shall labor in the 
ministry with kindness, sympathy, helpfulness, and with love un- 
feigned, so that the great work of our heavenly Father may progress 
in the earth and accomplish its mission among the children of men. 

I am thankful for the opportunity of mingling my voice in song 
and prayer, and to listen to the iadvice and counsel of my brethren. 
I hope we shall all go home determined to follow the splendid in- 



52 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



structions to which we have listened, all of which are for our spiritual 
and temporal welfare. 

I am particularly impressed by President Grant's advice that we 
get out of debt. Indebtedness is one of the great problems of the day 
facing the Latter-day Saints. We are today living under a commercial 
system of competition which has come from the world, and has 
replaced the conditions which prevailed in the early settlement of 
the valleys. 

Our present financial situation should set us all to Serious think- 
ing. Is not the time coming when it will be necessary for the Latter- 
day Saints to return to those earlier methods of living — the old 
rules of co-operation and mutual helpfulness — each doing his share 
in the community? It was this system of co-operation that built the 
roads, canals, bridges, cleared away the brush, organized towns and 
villages, and laid the foundation for the great communities of Latter- 
day Saints who now occupy these mountain valleys. Co-operation 
results from the great truth that human beings must depend upon 
one another. Now we finance all undertakings with money in the form 
of bonds. These bonds and certificates of indebtedness are usually sold 
outside the state, and must be paid by our labor, whether we are en- 
gaged in the office, on the farm, or on the range. Are we not over- 
reaching ourselves and becoming the "hewers of wood and drawers 
. of water"? 

■ We cooperate wonderfully in spiritujal things. Our system of 
organization, and the operation of the stakes, wards and missions, are 
the admiration of all unbiased investigators. In all the pffairs of the 
wards and stakes, cooperation is the basic idea. But when it comes to 
business, we are actuated purely by the spirit of competition. Th|at 
competition is for the profit of individuals or groups of individuals, 
and not in the interest of the community. Under our present com- 
petitive system of living, you will find in the small communities a 
number of people in commercial pursuits, supplying our needs for 
the purpose of making profit for themselves. Why not develop the 
spirit by which the community owns these institutions? Why not 
develop cooperative purchasing as we are now developing cooperative 
selling? This coopeiative spirit could be developed in the cultivation 
of large tracts of land, in flocks and herds, merchandising, banking, 
canals and water problems, and in many other ways, some of which 
have already been developed in the older states and in the countries 
of Europe. 

I just want to leave this thought to set us thinking more about 
this great problem of living, to see if, in the near future, we can put 
into' operation some of the earlier methods in vogue among the 
Pioneers and early-comers to these valleys; when there was no money, 
when labor was wealth, and the ability to work and apply labor in- 
telligently created wealth for the community. 

I again testify to you, my brethren and sisters, of miy thankful- 
ness and appreciation for the gospel. I know this to be the work of 
God, for the Lord has manifested it to me in many ways, and I thank 



ELDER JOHN WELLS 



53 



him with all my heart, and with all my mind and with all my soul 
that I am a Latter-day Saint. 

May he bless us with the disposition to understand the gospel, 
to manifest it in our daily lives, so that we may grow spirtiually day 
by day stronger in the faith and more willing to keep his command- 
ments, I ask in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 



ELDER REY L. PRATT 

{President of the Mexican Mission.) 

I esteem) it a very great privilege, my brethren and sisters, to 
stand before you this morning and bear my testimony because I know 
that the gospel is true. I know that it has been restored to us in this 
day and age in which we live, with all the gifts and blessings and 
the powers and privileges that have .ever pertained to it in any age 
of the world. I am very grateful to the Lord that I am a member of 
the Church of Jesus Christ of Later-day Saints. I am thankful to the 
Lord for the holy Priesthood that I bear and for the calling that has 
come to me to minister in the world as a missionary. The happiest 
time of my life- and I think the most, profitable to me, has been spent 
in missionary labors among the children of men who have not been 
acquainted with these glorious principles, of the gospel that we as a 
people enjoy. I feel that if the Lord requires it at my hands, I can feel 
happy in spending the rest of my life, or as much of it as he requires 
of me, in ministering the gospel to the people of the world who are 
not acquainted with these gjorious and saving principles. I am very 
grateful that at this conference the president of the Church, whom we 
sustain as prophet, seer and revelator, has spoken to Israel concerning 
the missionary work that is expected of us. I think that there is no work 
or responsibility resting so heavily upon the membership of this Church 
today as that of disseminating the gospel among the children of men. 
As I travel up and down the country and see the millions of people 
who are in spiritual darkness but who are honest in heart, who are 
desirous of doing right, and who, if they err, err in ignorance, I 
feel greatly resting upon me, my brethren and sisters, the respon- 
sibility of carrying to them the gospel. We are grateful to have your 
sons and daughters laboring with us in the mission field and I 
trust that the admonitions that have come from the president of the 
Church at this conference, will be followed by the fathers, mothers and 
brothers and sisters, and by the bishops of this Church, in that they 
will encourage their sons and daughters and the members of the 
wards to remain in the mission, rather than to suggest to 
them that they discontinue their labors at an early date. When 
we are cultivating the fruits of the field, my brothers and sisters, we 
do not pick the peach or apple, or garner the wheat before it is ripe. 



54 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 

I sometimes think that those fathers and mothers who are so anxious 
for their sons to come home are doing - that very thing, and their 
boys have not ripened in the service of the Lord. They come home and 
sometimes are not in as fair a way to make a success after they re- 
turn as they would be were they left a little longer in the missionary 
field. 

Our work has prospered during the year that has passed, in the 
Mexican mission. We have never baptized in any single year of the 
history of that mission so many people as w.e have baptised during the 
months that have passed of this year of 1921. With sixty missionaries 
laboring we have baptized two hundred and twenty-five people, and 
they are wonderfully faithful in their living of the gospel. I am grate- 
ful to the Lord that he has privileged me with my brethern to re-open 
the mission in the Republic of Mexico, after a term of years that we 
have not been able to labor there due to the revolutionary conditions ; 
and I am thankful to him for the faithfulness and integrity and the 
faithful lives of the Saints who were left there for years, as it were, 
as sheep without a shepherd. They have remained faithful. We have 
been able to hold conferences with them recently as in the years that 
are past and they gather around the elders and' are anxious to hear 
again the gospel taught among them, and their^ lives are an example 
worthy of imitation before the people with whom they are surrounded. 

I bear you my testimony, my brethren and sisters, that I know 
that God lives; and that Jesus Christ is his Son and is the Redeemer 
of the world. I bear 1 you my testimony that I know that Joseph Smith 
was a prophet of God, raised up to establish this work in the day and 
age we live in, and I know that he who stands at the head of the Church 
today is in very deed a prophet, seer and revelator unto the world, and 
I for one wish to| follow his counsel and advice and admonition and 
put my life, so far as I can, in harmony with the principles of the 
gospel. The Lord bless you, my brethren and sisters, and help us all 
to serve him with full purpose of heart, is my prayer in the name of 
Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER WINSLOW FARR SMITH 

{President of the Northern States Mission) 

I believe in the gospel of Jesus Christ. I believe that when 
God opened the heavens, one hundred years ago, and gave to the 
children of men thq knowledge of himself and his purposes, 
he commenced a most momentous work, and that when he gave 
to us, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the responsi- 
bility of carrying his message to all corners of the earth, 
he meant that we should do the work. I believe in the princi- 
ples of the gospel, not only in the first principles of faith, repent- 
ance, baptism by immersion, and the laying on of hands for the 



ELDER WIN SLOW FARR SMITH

gift of the Holy Ghost, but I believe also in the temporal principles 
of the gospel, those all important ordinances, those vital laws, 
those rigid 'rules of conduct that have been given to us by which 
we should order our lives, and I believe implicitly that God had 
a purpose when he gave to us a strict and a rigid plan for us to 
live. He will have a tried people and in order for us to be a tried 
people we must keep his commandments and live up to the rigid 
law he has given. I believe that the purpose of the gospel of Jesus 
Christ is not only to save the souls of men, but to save also their 
bodies, and that if we strive to save our bodies and shape our lives 
here on earth in harmony with the temporal plan, the rest 
will take care of itself. In the Book of Alma we read : 

Behold, now 7 say unto you that he commandeth you to repent; and 
except ye repent, y.e can in no wise inherit the kingdom of God. But be- 
hold, this is not all — he has commanded you to repent, or he will utterly 
destroy you frcpi off the face of the earth; yea, he will visit you in his an- 
ger, and in his fierce anger he will not turn away. Behold do ye not re- 
member the words which he spake unto Lehi, saying that: Inasmuch as 
ye shall keep my commandments, ye shall prosper in the land? And again 
it is said that: Inasmuch as ye will not keep my commandments ye shall 
be cut off from the presence of the Lord. 

I believe the Lord knew whereof he spoke and that he had a 
purpose, a definite and a positive purpose, in giving to us the 
commandments, that we have. I believe also that unless we strive 
to keep these commandments ; unless we exert ourselves to the ut- 
most to obey his divine law, we cannot look for, hope for, nor 
will we receive, the blessings that are promised upon the keeping 
of those laws. We have been blessed as a people. We have been 
gathered from all the corners of the earth. We have been sustained 
by our heavenly Father in times of adversity. We have triumphed, 
as it were, over the most momentous obstacles, and today the 
light of Zion stands here shining from the tops of the mountains, 
and (he world is looking up and .admiring the wonderful work we are- 
doing. We dare not, my brethren and sisters, feel that we have accom- 
plished all. No, we have merely begun. The work stands before us. 
The great field is here to be harvested. The world must be prepared. 
God has given us the responsibility. The charge is on our heads, 
and the burden is ours. Our duty is to preach the gospel of Jesus 
Christ by precept and by example. Our calling is to prepare 
the world for the coming of the Lord, and if we will do our duty, if 
we will exert ourselves to the utmost, if we will work, full of faith, 
full of zeal, full of determination, and give everything that we have, 
our hearts, our souls and our strength, the world will be prepared, 
and when the Lord Jesus Christ comes to reign as King of kings 
and Lord of lords, we, his people, will be accepted by him. God 
help us and sustain us to do that which he has given us- to do, 
is my prayer in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. 



56 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 

ELDER SAMUEL O. BENNION 

(President of the Central States Mission.) , 

I am very happy, my brethren and sisters, to have the privilege 
of attending this conference ; I feel that the Lord has greatly blessed 
all who have been here. The success which comes to this Church 
I think is largely the result of its members meeting together, in 
general conferences and in local gatherings, where they can receive 
instructions and counsel which they try to carry out in performing 
the work they have been sent into the world to do. 

A great responsibility rests upon the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints: The gospel which our Savior gave to his apostles 
in the dispensation of time in which he lived has been revealed anew 
in this dispensation and the same Priesthood that has been in the 
earth always under his direction is here today in the valleys of the 
mountains in Israel, where Israel is gathered and centered to carry 
out the great plan which our Father in heaven made before the 
earth was. This people are a great people ; I feel that we owe a great 
debt to our Father in heaven for what he has done. We have assuredly 
been blessed. There isn't any doubt in the mind of any man or woman, 
I am sure, who has followed in his life the authority of the .Lord 
Jesus Christ but that he has seen the return of the Lord's blessings 
to latter-day Israel With greater force than they were bestowed in 
former days. I am sure that the Church of Christ in the earth is 
stronger today than it was yesterday, but that it will never be weaker 
than it has been in the past, but that it will grow ; and as the days come 
and go, the strength of the Almighty will be manifested in greater 
power upon the children of men than it has ever been before, until 
he comes. 

When I look into the faces of men and women who are not of 
this Church, I feel that I owe unto them a testimony, if it is within 
my power to give it. For they lived at a former time and they kept 
their first estate- I often tell this to our missionaries in the field — 
that when they look upon the face of any man or woman they must 
remember one thing, that that man or woman kept the first estate. 
They may not have kept their estate as well as others have, but 
the fact nevertheless remains that they lived and were advanced as 
a result of their obedience. They received the blessings of the Almighty 
which gave them the privilege of living here in the flesh and receiv- 
ing the blessings of the flesh, for it is a blessing to be permitted 
to live in a body of flesh and bone. It is our duty to warn them, to 
warn ourselves, to receive admonition and to give it unto others ; for 
just so surely as the sun shines, as the Lord has said, there will come 
a time when men will be rewarded according to their works ; and 
when men and women find out what they have lost as a result of their 
disobedience, the Lord's word will be fulfilled, and' there will be 
weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth. 

it is the duty and labor of Latter-day' Saints to deliver unto the 



ELDER SAMUEL 0. BENNION 



57 



children of men the message which the Lord has revealed in these the 
last days. He spoke unto Joseph Smith. He said the things Joseph 
Smith declared he said. He delivered unto him the gospel, and the 
Prophet wrote and preached it. There isn't any doubt about it. I know 
as I stand here, and I say it to all the world : If there is an honest 
man, a man or a woman with a heart that desires to know the truth, 
that knowledge can come unto them. It is easy to receive, easy to 
understand. The gospel is not full of mysticisms or of things that 
cannot be understood, but it is a plain and simple plan which the 
children of men may follow and thereby go back into the presence of 
our Father in heaven. And unless they do this they cannot return 
where he is, worlds without end; so says the scripture given by the 
Prophet Joseph Smith. 

These things are given to the world and the words that he gave 
to the world have stood the test ever since they came into the earth. 
For nearly one hundred years the Book of Mormon has been before 
the people, and it has never been proved to be untrue; but, on the 
contrary, as every year comes and goes it is proved to be a truth by 
many hundreds of men and women. More witnesses are added to the 
divinity of that work. And so it is with the revelations of the Lord 
in this dispensation of time. This gathering itself is a witness — it is 
a witness unto any man or woman who might walk into this building 
with a desire in his heart to know whether this is the work of God — 
this great congregation and the Spirit and power of God felt here 
are witnesses and will stand for or against men at some future day. 

May the Lord give us the privilege to live faithfully unto the 
end of our lives, that we may return unto him, that we may send our 
sons, and daughters, and our message unto the world to bring as 
many souls unto Christ as is possible in the few short years we 
remain on the earth, I humbly pray, in the name of Christ. Amen. 

A cello solo, "Andante," was rendered by Seymour Fisher, 
accompanied on the great organ by Edward P. Kimball, Assistant 
organist. 

ELDER DAVID A. SMITH 

(Of the Presiding Bishopric of the Church) 

I feel weighing heavily upon me, my brethren and sisters, the 
responsibility that comes to me at this time. Nevertheless, I am 
grateful unto God for this privilege of bearing testimony to you, 
and I sincerely pray that he will give me strength to speak 
words of encouragement. It is a wonderful privilege to stand 
here and look into the faces of those gathered together in this 
conference, and a great responsibility to endeavor to instruct 
you in your duties. This truly is a marvelous work and a wonder.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



I thought yesterday, when President Grant mentioned the fact 
that we have nearly eighteen hundred missionaries in the world, 
preaching the gospel, how many of us here at home fully realize, 
or in a sense realize, the great missionary work that is being done. 
Every man holding the Priesthood of this Church, who is magnifying 
his calling before God, is preaching the gospel, and when I have seen 
the work that is being done on this block by Brother Goddard and 
his associates, directed by the Spirit of God, I am sure I am safe in 
saying that the missionary work being done right here, where the 
temple of the living God is located, "the mountain of the House of 
the Lord established in the tops of the mountains, exalted above the 
hills," is a "marvelous work and a wonder." How many of us realize 
that hundreds of thousands are coming here to our very doors each 
year to hear the word of the Lord. I wonder sometimes if the power 
of the Priesthood, and the manifestations of 1 the power of God through 
it. are not so common to us that we pass them by, day by day, giving 
little heed to the warnings and encouragement they bring. 

The other day it was my privilege to meet a reverend gentleman 
on this block. After discussing some of the principles of the gospel with 
Mm, he expressed a wish to know something more concerning "Mor- 
monism," so called. It was my privilege later to take him to visit 
one of our Sabbath schools where those holding the Priesthood were 
meeting as quorums. He passed from one class to another, ending 
where the High Priests were in session. In going from the classes 
where he saw young men ranging from twelve to twenty years of 
age present in goodly numbers, he said, "Bishop Smith, how do you 
do it? How do you get them here? We can't do it, iwe can't touch 
men of this age." I answered : "See what they are studying. These 
young men hold the Priesthood ; they are deacons, teachers and priests, 
having been ordained by those who have authority from God to do 
so. This Priesthood fills them, if they keep themselves clean, with a 
desire to study the principles of the gospel. There is a place in the 
Church for them to function.. Their greatest desire is to honor 
the Priesthood and magnify their calling so that some day they will 
"be found ready and worthy to go into the world to preach the gospel 
of Jesus Christ — this gospel which they are studying. That is the 
desire that actuates them and brings them here Sunday after Sunday". 
He said, "How do you get these young men here who are acting 
as instructors ? How much do you pay them for this work ?" I referred 
this question to the superintendent of the Sunday school, who 
answered: "There is only one man in this building who receives a 
salary for his work, and he is paid for doing the janitor work." The 
gentleman's reply was: "It is marvelous! It is a wonder! I am 
bewildered with it all. The only thing I can compare it with is, if you 
will pardon the comparison, a three ring circus. You have given me so 
much to think about, I am bewildered. I think I am safe in saying that 
you have here in this house today more people assembled for the 



ELDER DAVID A. SMITH .. 59 

purpose of worshiping- God than we have in the whole county where 
I live." His home is in another state. 

Now, my brethren and sisters, those of us who hold the Priesthood 
have great responsibility. . You, fathers and mothers, have a great 
responsibility. My special calling in this Church is tq guard and guide 
the youth of Zion, and to encourage those who have been ordained to 
the Lesser Priesthood, which Priesthood holds the keys to the minist- 
ering of angels and the preparatory gospel, which is the gospel of 
repentance, and of baptism, and the remission of sins. It prepares 
young men to do the greater work required of them in later 
life. In that Priesthood, as we are today, the duties of the priest are to 
preach, teach, expound, exhort, to baptize and administer the Sacra- 
ment ; to visit the house of each member, and exhort them to pray, 
vocally and in secret, and to attend to all family duties. The, duty of a 
teacher is to watch over the Church always, and be with and 
strengthen them, to see that there is no iniquity in the Church, no back- 
biting, evil speaking or lying. The duty of the deacon, the little 
fellow, the beginner, is to assist the teacher, to keep order in the meet- 
ing house, and be on hand at all times to labor as directed by the 
bishop, to perform outward ordinances which help him to grow and 
become strong in the faith and useful in the hands of God. How many 
of us realize the blessings that have been promised to us through the 
Priesthood ? 

And the inhabtants of Zion, also, shall remember their labors, inas- 
much as they are appointed to labor, in all faithfulness ; for the idler 
shall be had in remembrance before the Lord. Now, I the Lord, am not 
well pleased with the inhabitants of Zion, for there are idlers among them; 
and their children are also growing up in wickedness; they also seek not 
earnestly the riches of eternity, but their eyes are full of greediness. (Doc. 
& Cov. 68:30-31.) 

There is work provided for all, and all are expected to work, and 
are rewarded according to their faithfulness. 

For whoso is faithful unto the obtaining these two Priesthoods of 
which I have spoken, and the magnifying their calling, are sanctified by 
the Spirit unto the renewing of their bodies; they become the sons of 
Moses and of Aaron, and the seed of Abraham, and rue Church and 
Kingdom and the elect of God; and also all they who receive this Priest- 
hood receiveth me, saith the Lord; for he that receiveth my servants re- 
ceiveth me; and he that receiveth me receiveth my Father; and he that 
receiveth my Father, receiveth my Father's kingdom; therefore all that 
my Father hath shall be given unto him"; [not a part, not a portion, but 
all that my Father hath shall be given unto him], "and this is according 
to the oath and covenant which belongeth to the Priesthood. Therefore* 
all those who receive the Priesthood, receive this oath and covenant of my 
Father, which he cannot break, neither can it be moved; but whoso break- 
■eth this covenant, after he hath received it, and altogether turneth there- 
from, shall not have forgiveness of sins in this world nor in the world to 
come. (Doc. & Cov. 84:33, 41.)

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Oh, I sincerely pray, my brethren and sisters, that we. will 
magnify our calling in the Priesthood. Oh, elders of Israel, let us see 
that there is work for those holding the Lesser Priesthood. See that 
these young men whose mission is to labor in the Lesser Priesthood 
have work to do, and as we are commanded here, take them with us : 

And if any man among you be strong in the spirit, let him take with 
him he that is weak, that he may be edified in all meekness, that he may 
become strong also. Therefore, take with you those who are ordained 
unto the Lesser Priesthood, and send them bfeore you to make appoint- 
ments, and to prepare the way, and to fill appointments that you yourselves 
are not able to fill. Behold, this is the way that mine apostles, in an- 
cient days, built up my Church unto me. Therefore, let every man stand 
in his own office, and labor in his own calling; and Jet not the head say 
unto the feet, it hath no need of the feet, for without the feet how shall 
the body be able to stand? Also the body hath need of every member that 
' all may be edified together, that the system may be kept perfect." (Doc. 
& Cov. 84:106-110.) 

God help us to do our duty, is my prayer, and I ask it inj the name 
of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER NEPHI JENSEN 

{President of the Canadian Mission.) 

With all my heart I am thankful for membership in the Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I am thankful that I know 
that the Gospel of Jesus Christ is in this Church. I am thankful that 
I have had the privilege of telling, in a humble way, some of the 
children of men of the great things which God has wrought in our 
day and time. I sincerely pray in my heart that I shall always have 
the strength and the desire to do my part in proclaiming the knowledge 
of these great things to the children of men. 

I have had occasion, frequently, while laboring in the Canadian 
Mission, to discover the marks of truth in the gospel which we teach. 
Jesus said, "I came not to bring peace but a sword." Carlyle stated 
the same idea in the terse phrase, "Every fact is a battle." The greater 
the fact, the greater the battle. Truth is the greatest fact in the world. 
I have noticed that the truth that we teach does have the characteris- 
tics of a battle. Just a few weeks ago a very intelligent gentleman in 
the city of Toronto visited three street meetings upon the same eve- 
ning. These three meetings were all being conducted at the same time. 
In two of them bitter attacks were being made upon the Latter-day 
Saints. The other meeting was being conducted by our elders. The 
gentleman visited the two anti-"Mormon" meetings and then finally 
came to the meeting in which our elders were preaching the gospel 
of Jesus Christ. He remained at this meeting to the close. At the con- 
clusion of the service, he approached one of the elders and told of 



ELDER NEPHI JENSEN 



61 



his attendance at the other two meetings and asked the question, 
"Are the 'Mormons' the only people in the world?" Well, I hardly 
think that the Mormons are the only people in the world, but I am 
quite sure that they have the only religion in the world that has 
substance enough in it to keep the devil awake at nights. 

I have had occasion to witness the purifying and ennobling power 
of the gospel of Jesus Christ. Some months ago a young man came to 
our mission. He was a graduate of the University of Utah. In the 
course of our conversation I asked him how he was going to maintain 
himself in the field and he said, "I have been teaching school for 
four years and I have saved a little money. I am going to spend this 
money in maintaining myself in the mission field." That remark is 
one of the most eloquent sermons I have ever heard. It is also one 
of the best testimonies of the divinity of the gospel of Jesus Christ I 
have ever heard. 

I have also had occasion to notice the greatness and generosity 
of the Saints at home, in maintaining their sons and daughters upon 
the firing line of truth. A few days ago one of my companions came to 
me regarding his release. In the course of our conversation he said, 
"I have just received a letter from my father, in which he writes : 
'It is hard to get money at the present time. I have kept five sons in 
the mission field, but I don't want you to think about coming homle 
until you receive an honorable release.' " 

I recall another letter which was received from a good mother 
in Israel, who had reared ten children. This letter was written to a 
sister of one of our missionaries. The good mother wrote his sister, 
"I would rather take in washing every day to keep my son in the 
field, than to think of his coming home until he has completed his 
mission." 

I want you to know that I treasure the memory of these things 
above the price of rubies. They testify of great souls, of souls that 
have been made pure and great by the power of the gospel of Jesus 
Christ. With all my heart I am thankful for my membership in the 
Church that produces this kind of souls. I am thankful for the testi- 
mony of the truth which God has written upon my heart by the fire 
of the Holy Ghost. I know that this is the kingdom of the living God. 
I know that there is in this Church the power and tjhe Priesthood of 
God. I know that there is in this Church the riches of God's truth 
and God's wisdom. I do know that Heber J. Grant is a Prophet of 
God. The promise which he sealed upon my head when I was set 
apart for my last mission has been fulfilled — a promise which no 
human power could make come true. 

My brothers and my sisters, let us remember who we are and what 
our mission is in the world, and let us humbly and faithfully do our 
part, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



ELDER CHARLES H. HART 

( Of the First Council of Seventy ) 

No doubt all of us who have had the privilege of attending these 
conference meetings have felt that it was good for us to be here. I 
think that upon .each occasion of one of these annual or semi-annual 
conferences a little different situation confronts the people. They are 
in need of a little different line of advice; and I felt, as President 
Grant gave his opening speech, that we! had heard the right word, and 
that it only remained for us to follow the good' advice, and that the work 
of the Lord, spiritually and temporally, in this intermountain country, 
would be greatly heightened thereby, I think the one thing that we 
need, perhaps more than any other, is obedience. Our third 
article of faith declares that salvation by the atonement is conditioned 
upon obedience to the laws and ordinances of the gospel. Another 
article of faith calls for obedience to the sovereign civil power and its 
laws. Many of the evils of the day result from the lack of obedience 
to the gospel and to the laws which govern us. Our modern, scriptures, 
(he revelations unto the Prophet Joseph Smith, are particularly strong 
in expressions as tq the necessity of obedience, in order for us! to have 
the benefit of the great sacrifice made by our Lord and Redeemer. 
In simplest form, perhaps, it is expressed thus: "My blood shall not 
cleanse them if they hear me not." 

In the Old Testament there are many strong passages indicating 
the necessity of obedience in order for us to have the benefit of the 
principles of the gospel and of the atonement and of the promises. 
When our 'brother quoted from the Book of Mormon, from Alma, I 
thought of a similar doctrine, as expressed in the eleventh chapter 
of Deuteronomy, in the twenty-seventh and twenty-eighth verses, that 
there would be a blessing by obedience, and a curse for those; who did 
not obey. We have some very striking examples in scripture of the 
view which the Lord took of disobedience. In the instance of the 
taking of Jericho, the very taking of it was based upon obedience. It 
would not have been sufficient if they had not complied with the 
direction as to the number of times that they should march around the 
city before it would be their privilege to take it. They were under strict 
command that it was not an expedition for spoils, and when one Achan 
disregarded that injunction and had to confess later that he had within 
his tent, the Babylonish robe, and the wedge of gold, and the shekels 
of silver, he was taken out and stoned by his comrades, because they 
realized then the necessity of obedience. King Saul no doubt learned 
his bitter lesson when the same rule applied to him, that it was not 
an expedition for private profit that he entered upon in proceeding 
against one of the heathen nations that merited destruction. When 
there could be heard the bleating of the sheep and the lowing of the 
cattle, which he had saved contrary to instructions, and he felt that 



ELDER CHARLES H. HART 



63 



he had incurred the, displeasure of Samuel and also of the Lord, how 
deep must have been his regret ; how he would have retained Samuel 
to have him, if possible, wipe out the penalty for the act of disobe- 
dience. Another instance is the healing of the blind man by bathing in 
the pool under the directions of the Savior. Of course, be could not 
have received his sight by disobeying or any failure to) comply with 
the directions that had been given him whereby he might receive his 
sight. So, not only in the Church, but in the family circle, there is 
need of obedience. If time permitted I think we might read with 
profit at this point, the second epistle of the Apostle Paul to his 
"son in the common faith," as he called Titus, but time will not 
permit. Let the Latter-day Saints read this scripture and read more 
of thei scriptures, for I feel that there is great profit to us in so doing. 

We are living in a time of commotion. We are still in the struggle 
of what has been called the "back-wash of the war." It is a time 
of unsettled conditions. The right of suffrage has been widely 
extended throughout the earth. There has come within the scope of 
governmental powers increased duties and increased powers, and men 
are trying to keep their bearings by fixing their gaze upon 
the land marks. I thank the Lord for the marks that we 
have in this latter-day revealed religion of ours ; that we have 
been kept steady, just as an ex-secretary of state found dur- 
ing the war evidences of steadiness here among our people. We 
might now have fewer instances of suffering and more evidences 
that we are prepared, to stand not only the shock of war but thq shock 
of war's aftermath, if there had been more obedience. People have 
passed through a stressful time during the last few years. You people 
within the sound of my voice can testify to that, if not from personal 
experience, from the instances in the lives of your friends, some of 
whom have gone down in the financial struggle. I know of one 
instance of creditors pursuing their debtor, and after the struggle of 
the debtor had been so severe that he in the meridian of his life had 
been a victim of adverse circumstances, and had given his life as 
forfeit, the merciful creditor then greatly rejoiced. In speaking to me 
of it, he expressed great joy that he had exercised mercy and for- 
bearance and had not contributed in any way to the untimely taking 
off of his brother. Some find themselves in the position they now 
are in as the result of disobedience, failure to hearken to the counsel 
of their stake presidents. I know of some neighborhoods where there 
is financial distress, and the people feel the pinch of indebtness, just 
now as a result of failing to obey the caution given them by their 
respective stake presidents. I feel sure that the remedy has been 
offered for any little, or any considerable, inconvenience that the 
people may be passing through just now, if they will hearken to the 
voice of our prophet, seer and revelator. You are familiar with the 
story of the necessity for the cleaning up of a municipality in olden 
times, in order to properly receive certain guests ; and the consideration 



64 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 

by the municipal authorities as to how they could do it upon short 
notice. Someone suggested that each one clean in front of his own 
property. That is all we have to do, it seems to me, each one of us, 
whether we belong to the Church or not, each one to whom this 
message of the opening address of this conference comes, to be 
obedient, to give heed to the suggestions, and the distress and dis- 
comfiture, if any exists, will surely disappear. 

I rejoice in the blessings and truths of the gospel. I felt, as 
Elder Widtsoe gave his testimony at the opening of his speech this 
morning, that that would be my testimony, and I would like it as 
such, without taking your time more to repeat it. I would simply 
like to> make his testimony and the testimony of others of the brethren 
whom we have listened to today, my testimony. I rejoice in the 
knowledge of the truth. I marvel as I read the scriptures at the 
evidences that have been given, line upon line, chapter upon chapter, 
section upon section, of the fact that Joseph Smith was indeed a 
prophet of God : that not only knowledge, but wisdom dwelt with 
him. Someone has given us the distinction between the two and said. : 
"Knowledge dwells in heads replete with thoughts of other men: 
wisdom in minds attentive to their own. Knowledge is proud that it 
knows so much ; wisdom is humble that it knows no more." 

We can learn even from that people whose representatives were 
referred to by Elder Widtsoe. I have often admired the emphasis 
they place upon honoring parents. They have said that out of a 
hundred virtues, the first to be listed would be "filial piety," the 
honoring of parenthood ; and they also said that "out of ten thousand 
evils, lewdness would be placed as the first," as the most offensive. 

May the Lord bless us and help us to be obedient to the will of 
our Father, and to live according to the conditions upon which 
blessings are predicated, that we may be the happy recipients of the 
same, I ask in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

I 

Elder Hart has asked you to read from the scripture. I 
thought I would do the same ; and then, while considering it, I believe 
that nine out of ten of you would not do it, so I am going to read 
an entire section of the Doctrine and Covenants : Remember this 
is the word of the Lord Almighty, a revelation from God to his 
people, the very first section in the Doctrine and Covenants: 

Hearken. O ye people of my church, saith the voice of him who 
dwells o,n high, and whose eyes are upon all men; yea, verily I say, 
hearken ye people from afar, and ye that are upon the islands of the sea, 
listen together. 

For verily, the voice of the Lord is unto all men, and there is none to 
escape, and there is no eye that shall not see, neither ear that shall not 
hear, neither heart that shall not be penetrated. 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 



65 



And the rebellious shall be pierced with much sorrow, for their in- 
iquities shall be spoken upon the housetops, and their secret acts shall be 
revealed. 

And the voice of warning shall be unto all people, by the mouths of 
my disciples, whom I have chosen in these last days. 

And they shall go forth and none shall stay them, ior I, the Lord, 
have commanded them. 

Behold, this is mine authority, and the authority of my servants, and 
my preface unto the book of my commandments, which I have given 
them to publish unto you, O inhabitants of the earth. 

Wherefore, fear and tremble, O ye people, for what I, the Lord, have 
decreed in them shall be fulfilled. 

And verily, I say unto you, that they who go forth, bearing these 
tidings unto the inhabitants of the earth, to them is power given to- seal 
both on earth and in heaven, the unbelieving and rebellious; 

Yea., verily, to seal them up unto the day when the wrath of God 
shall be poured out upon the wicked without measure; 

Unto the day when the Lord shall come to recompense unto every 
man according to his work, [not according to his profession, not accord- 
ing to his knowledge,, mot according to the testimonies he bears, but ac- 
cording to his work] and measure to every man according to the measure 
which he has measured to his fellow man. 

Wherefore the voice of the Lord is unto the ends of the earth, that all 
that will hear may hear: 

Prepare ye, prepare ye for that which is to come, for the Lord is nigh; 

And the anger of the Lord is kindled, and his sword Is bathed in 
heaven, and it shall fall upon the inhabitants of the earth; 

And the arm of the Lord shall be revealed; and the. day cometh that 
they who will not hear the voice of the Lord, neither the voice of his 
servants, neither give heed to the words of the prophets and apostles shall 
be cut off from among the people; 

For they have strayed from mine ordinances, and have broken mine 
everlasting covenant; 

They seek not the Lord to establish his righteousness, but every man 
walketh in his own way, and after the image of his own God, whose image 
is in the likeness of the world, and whose substance is that of an idol, 
which waxeth old and shall perish in Babylon, even Babylon the great, 
which shall fall. 

Wherefore I the Lord, knowing the calamity which should come upon 
the inhabitants of the earth, called upon my servant Joseph Smith,, Jr., and 
spake unto him from heaven, and gave him commandments; 

And also gave commandments to others, that they should proclaim 
these things unto the world; and all this that it might be fulfilled, which 
was written by the prophets; 

The weak things of the world shall' come forth and break down the 
mighty and strong ones, that man should not counsel his fellow man, 
neither trust in the arm of flesh, 

But that every man might speak in the name of God the Lord, even 
the Savior of the world; 

That faith also might increase in the earth; 

That mine everlasting covenants might be established; 

That the fulness of my gospel might be proclaimed by the weak and 
the simple unto the ends of the world, and before kings and rulers. 

Behold, I am God and have spoken it; these commandments are of 
me, and were given unto my servants in their weakness, after the manner 
of their language, that they might come to understanding, 

And inasmuch as they erred it might be made known: 

And inasmuch as they sought wisdom they might be instructed:

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



And inasmuch as they sinned they might be chastened, that they 
might repent; 

And inasmuch as they were humble they might be made strong, and 
blessed from on high, and receive knowledge from time to time: 

And after having received the record of the Nephites, yea, even my 
servant Joseph Smith, Jr., might have power to translate through the 
mercy of God, by the power of God, the Book of Mormon; 

And also those to whom these commandments were given, might have 
power to lay the foundation of this church, and to bring it forth out of ob- 
scurity and out of darkness, the only true and living church upon the face 
of the whole earth, with which I, the Lord, am well pleased, speaking unto 
the church collectively and not individually, 

For I the Lord cannot look upon sin with the least degree of allow- 
ance; 

Nevertheless, he that repents and does the commandments of the Lord 
shall be forgiven; 

And he that repents not, from him, shall be taken even the light which 
he has received, for my spirit shall not always strive with man,, saith the' 
Lord of Hosts. 

And again, verily I say unto you, O inhabitants of the earth, I the Lord 
am willing to make these things known unto all flesh, 

For I am no respecter of persons, and will that all men shall know 
that the day speedily cometh; the hour is not yet, but is nigh at hand, 
when peace shall be taken from the earth, and the devil shall have power 
over his own dominion; 

And also the Lord shall have power over his saints, and shall reign 
in their midst, and shall come down in judgment upon Idumea, or the 
world. 

Search these commandments for they are true and faithful, and the 
prophecies and promises which are in them shall all be fulfilled. 

What I the Lord have spoken, I have spoken, and I excuse not my- 
self: and though the heavens and the earth pass away, my word shall not 
pass away, but shall all be fulfilled, whether by mine own voice or by the 
voice of my servants, it is the same; 

For behold, and lo, the Lord is God, and the Spirit beareth record, 
and the record is true, and the truth abideth for ever and ever. Amen. 

A revelation from the Lord God to the Latter-day Saints. 

Elder Melvin J. Ballard, the choir, and the congregation sang, 
"Who's on the Lord's side, who?" 

Benediction was pronounced by Elder John A. Elison, Presi- 
dent of the Raft River stake of Zion. 

Conference adjourned until 2 o'clock p. m. 



AFTERNOON SESSION 

The meeting was opened at 2 o'clock by President Heber J. 
Grant, who announced that the choir and congregation would 
sing, "Do What is right, the day dawn is breaking." 

After the singing, the opening prayer was offered by Elder 
Clarence Gardner, President of the Star Valley stake. 

The choir and congregation sang, "Praise to the man who 
communed with Jehovah." 



ELDER CHARLES A. CALLIS

ELDER CHARLES A. CALLIS 

(President of the Southern States Mission) 

To the man who communed with Jehovah was given a wonderful 
promise. The Lord said to him: "Thy people shall never be turned 
against thee by the testimony of traitors." This promise has been 
enjoyed, is enjoyed, and will be enjoyed by every president of the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints ; and with our leaders 
we will go on to victory, the victory which will win for us eternal 
life, growing up in all good things, perfected in doctrine, in Jesus 
Christ, our head. 

It was a soul-thrilling message that our president delivered unto 
us yesterday morning. He stirred up our minds by way of remem- 
brance to the divine mission of this Church: this mission is — "And 
this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for 
a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come." "Where 
there is no vision, the people perish." In this Church this vision is 
a broad and glowing light, and whenever we do not sense sufficiently 
our mission of preaching the gospel, it is a sign that our vision is 
dimming, and hence the necessity of prophets and apostles to remind 
jus of oua* duties, and to make more clear this glorious vision 
which should always be before the eyes of every Latter-day Saint. 

The testimony of Jesus Christ abides in this Church. Some of our 
young men may grow slack, seemingly indifferent; but sooner or 
later will come in their lives a great awakening. The testimony will 
flame up in their hearts in time of need. It may be that it will 
require the winds of opposition to make this flame spring up in their 
souls, but sooner or later, in their direst need, it will come to them ; 
and this is a comfort and joy to the hearts of the Latter-day Saints. 
A young man laboring in the Georgia conference, several years 
ago, said he believed in the gosped, came on a mission because he 
felt it was his duty to come, but he could not say in ! his heart that 
he knew the gospel was the power of God unto salvation. After he 
had labored in the conference a couple of weeks, he and his companion 
were attacked by a mob. The mobocrats chased these young men 
for about two miles, and when the young man who said he had not 
a .testimony, had outdistanced his pursuers, he faced about and, point- 
ing his hand in the direction of the mob, said : "I know this gospel 
is true." Thus there came into that young man's soul the great 
awakening light. , ( 

The Church is the mother of men grown strong in giving. I 
believe that affiliation and adversity play an important part in our 
lives. I am reminded of the words of Alma, the Nephite prophet, in 
the thirty-second chapter of the book bearing his name. Some poor 
people came to him and declared that they had been cast out of their 



>

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



synagogues because of their exceeding 1 poverty. Alma had the courage 
to give them the counsel they most needed. I believe it takes as 
much moral courage sometimes to teach the poor as it does to counsel 
the rich. These people were poor in this "world's goods, and poor in 
spirit. God said: "Blessed are the poor in spirit who come unto me." 
Unto these poor in heart Alma said: 

I say unto you, it is well that ye are cast out of your synagogues, 
that ye may be humble, and that ye may learn wisdom; for it is necessary 
that ye should learn wisdom; for it is because that ye are cast out, that ye 
are despised of your brethren, because of your exceeding poverty, that ye 
are brought to a lowliness of heart; for y.e are necessarily brought to be 
humble, blessed are ye; for a man sometimes, if he is compelled to be hum- 
ble, seeketh repentance; and now surely, whosoever repenteth, shall find 
mercy; and he that findeth mercy and endureth to the end, the same shall 
be saved. And now as I said unto you, that because ye were compelled to 
be humble, ye were blessed, do ye not suppose that they are more blessed 
who truly humble themselves because of the word." 

Brethren and sisters, will future historians write the melancholy 
story that the Latter-day Saints were compelled to be humble ? I don't 
think they will. I believe that, aside from afflictions, from prosperity, 
we should always humble ourselves because of the word, because 
we know that this gospel is the power of God unto salvation. 
This personal testimony that comes to our sons and daughters, this 
testimony that they receive when they are baptized, when eight 
years of age and receive the gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying 
on of hands by the servants of God, this testimony is the secret 
and the reason for the steadfastness of the members of this Church. 
Against this testimony — which is the heritage of God's sons and 
daughters — the gates of hell shall never, no never, prevail. Amen. 



ELDER NICHOLAS G. SMITH 

(Late President of the South African Mission.) 

What an inspiration it is to look; upon this sea of faces, of people 
who have lived the gospel and who are striving to live it. What a 
joy it is, I say, to be here in your midst. I come as a foreigner. For 
eight years I have been in the South African mission. I remember 
when I was called to go there some of my friends said : "O, get it 
changed. Don't go down am'ong the heathen," and I said to them: 
"But who am I that I can have my mission changed? I believe 
that the authorities of this Church are men called of God, and if 
they ask us to do anything ilt is from God himself, and who am I that 
I can tell the Lord that he does not want me in South Africa? 
These men who preside over the Church are God's servants and when 
they speak to us they speak with authority: and we have no right 
to suggest to them, or to the Lord, that he does not know where he

wants us. Wonderful has been the manifestations of the Lord shown 
to me in that land. They said I was going down there among the 
heathen. How surprised I was to find out the laws and rules under 
which they live ! When I came home I discovered that in some re- 
spects we are following in the footsteps of the heathen. I found 
when we landed in New York, that we wore just about as many clothes 
as the heathen did in South Africa (Laughter). They have some 
other customs that would be well for us to copy after, as well as this 
custom. They have a rule or law down there which compels all the 
stores to close down one-half day each week; and upon that half- 
day the populace go out, and they have their sports and their games. 
They have another law which compels every store, even the drug 
stores, to close upon the Sabbath day — down amongst the heathen, 
if you please ; and there are no moving pictures there upon the Sab- 
bath day. Why, I was preaching in one of the wards one evening 
when an ice-cream wagon came along, clanging its bell, and some of 
the folks went out and bought a cone: — I suppose to keep themselves 
awake until I finished talking. But these things are not right to my 
mind — speaking as a foreigner, as one of the members of the Church 
who comes from a foreign country to Zion, to learn of uplifting laws 
and ways ; why can't we, Latter-day Saints, see to it that the Sabbath 
clay is honored' and respected in our midst? Why, the law should go 
out of Zion, and the word of the Lord from, Jerusalem. Then why do 
we not have these rules in our own places of residence 1 — right here in 
Zion? Another law they have down there; no one can buy fire-arms 
in that country who has not a permit from the magistrate; so that 
only loyal citizens are enabled to secure fire-arms. I never heard 
of a hold-up in that country all the while I was there. Think of it. Here 
in Zion, every time I pick up a paper, I read of dozens of them. Why 
is it? We might well copy after some of the laws and rules that the 
heathen have. Let me tell you, down there they have good laws, for 
it is one of the dominions of the British Empire, and the people make 
their own laws. 

The Lord did not fail us in that mission, thank heaven. He sent 
a man down there in my place who is in very deed a servant of God, 
and now the way is opened up so more missionaries can go to South 
Africa. One of them has already arrived there, a young lad who went 

all the way to South Africa ; he has been permitted to enter, and he 
is there now with President J. Wyley Sessions, who is presiding over 
that mission. And let me say to you, brethren and sisters, if youi have 
a son who is called to that mission, rejoice in the fact, for he is down 
there with a man of God, and there is no better place to be in all the 
world. 

By way of closing I desire to bear my testimony to you, to 
show you all how the Lord! takes care of his own. You remember in 



70 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



that awful October when the "flu" came over the earth, we had it down 
there. My mother wrote me from Salt Lake City and said: "Son, 
nearly one hundred people have died here during October." In return 
I answered and said : "O mother, if only one hundred had died in a 
day how happpy we would have been here; but it was one hundred, 
two hundred, three hundred, four hundred, five hundred in a day; 
and when a week had passed five thousand people had died in the 
city of Cape Town alone, which is about the size of Salt Lake City. 
When the second week had ended ten thousand people had been taken 
by the scourge." 

. Think of it, brethren and sisters ; and yet here we complain 
because one hundred had died in a month). During this time of death 
and desolation, it crept into the mission house. Out elders went 
down with the dread disease. Only one besides myself was left upon 
his feet — Elder Aaron U. Merrill, a grandson of the late Apostle 
Merrill, of Cache valley. I said to Elder Merrill: "Are you prepared 
to go with me to bless the people?" He said: "I will go, President." 
Mind you, we saw children dragging their parents' coffins along the 
street. But soon the coffins were all gone, and then we saw forty 
and fifty bodies wrapped in sack-cloth, placed upon motor trucks and 
taken off to the cemetery and thrown into trenches. Some' of our 
friends we carried away in bread wagons, others in wheel bar- 
rows, others were carried away on the shoulders of men. Death and 
desolation all about us! When it came, there were fifty-seven mem- 
bers of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints who went 
down to their beds with this dread sickness. Elder Merrill and I went 
from door to door. Half of these people should have died, according 
to the rules of the game. The first door we came to we found a young 
woman, a girl, who had married a man outside the Church. We 
opened the door and walked in, because, mind you, people were 
unable to answer knocks. Some places they went into, they found 
as many as eight dead lying around in different rooms, some in the 
bed room, others out by the water, where they had been trying to 
get a drink, and where they had died. When this man saw us, he 
told us, in his delirium, to get out; but we refused. We got him on 
to the bed. We saw that he was dangerously ill. The doctor had been 
there just a| little while before, and had said that both of them were 
dying. We administered to this younsj woman, according to the 
pattern which was set by our Lord and Savior, and which James tells 
us of; and the Lord raised her up. We went from house to house 
administering to the members of the Church who were sick with that 
dread disease, and the Lord raised up every one of therm. Not one 
Latter-day Saint died in the citv of Cape Town. One of the elders, 
Elder Charles Elmer Sessions from Kimberly, wrote to me and said: 
"President, the Lord has not refused to acknowledge a single one 
administration." Think of it, brethren and sisters. Why, we have God

with us here, here in Zion. We have the Priesthood here. The miracles 
are not to be read about in only the! scriptures. Christ did not perform 
the last one, nor his apostles; but he said that greater things than he. 
did should we do ; and we have that power here with us. Let us exer- 
cise our faith, to the end that we might raise even the dead ; because 
I testify to you that I have seen thq dead raised. God bless us here in 
Zion, help us to live the gospel and to follow in the foot-steps 
and take the advice of the leaders of this Church, is my prayer, in 
Jesus' name. Amen. 

ELDER HEBER C. IVERSON 

(President of the Northwestern States Mission) 

I feel I can do no better during the brief moments I occupy this 
position than to . add my humble testimony to the inspiring one to 
which we have just listened, concerning the spirit and power of the 
Almighty in the Church of Christ, wherein his authority is recog- 
nized and his blessing bestowed upon those who receive, through the 
ordinances of the gospel, the administration of the elders. I shall 
refer briefly to an incident of recent occurrence in my own home, in 
which, as many of my friends here know, Sister Iverson was seriously 
ill, and the manifestation of God's power on her* behalf was marvelous 
in very deed. I think of it with unspeakable gratitude in my heart; 
but I shall pass to another incident even more striking than this one, 
though this was a marvelous manifestation of our Father's love 
and power in response to the prayers that were offered and the fast 
that was observed, not alone in the mission field but by the hundreds 
of kind, sympathetic friends here in Zion. To them we feel obligated 
and extend our sincere thanks and gratitude. 

The incident T desire to refer to is an experience which came 
to a sister residing in Portland, the president of the Young Ladies' 
Mutual Improvement Association, who, when set apart by President 
Melvin J. Ballard, shortly before I came into the mission, protested 
that she should not accept the position because of the state of her 
health. But by him she was promised, in a blessing given in con- 
nection with her setting apart, that if she would accept the position 
the Lord would give her sufficient strength to attend to the duties 
of this calling and the meetings of the organizations. Her testimony 
is that she has never absented herself from these meetings, notwith- 
standing she has made equally great efforts on other occasions to 
attend Sunday evening services, but often was unable so to do. 
Her health seemed to continue to fail her and last November her 
condition became serious, and grew rapidly more serious until June 
of the present year. In the meanwhile many eminent physicians were 
consulted, and lastly a clinic of specialists, the senior member of 
which is a very distinguished surgeon and physician, concerning whom 
the Mayos have said so long as they have him in the northwest, 



72 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



it is useless to send patients to Rochester. Under these specialists, 
she passed for examination from nine o'clock one morning until five 
in the afternoon, seven men having; examined her, and the conclusions 
were that she was afflicted with cancer of the abdomen. I do not know 
the exact location, hut every indication and every conclusion of 
these men was that she was suffering from cancer. Moreover I 
am told that she was also suffering from a dropping of the stomach 
and bowels. The growth in the abdomen was not only perceptible to 
the touch but plainly visible to the eye. When it was decided that she 
undergo an operation, after she had been administered to, about two 
weeks before her going to the hospital for this examination, and the 
decision was reached on the afternoon preceding the morning on 
which the operation was to be performed, word was sent out to the 
Saints and the elders, requesting that they meet in fasting and prayer 
on that particular morning. At nine o'clock in the morning she was 
placed upon the table, the anaesthetic was administered, and the 
surgeon rolled down the sheet and he was just about to make the 
incision when the abdomen, inflated highly as it was, deflated before 
his eyes. In perfect amazement he shook his head and said: "I have 
never seen anything like that before in my life. I can't understand 
it." He made a hasty examination which revealed nothing but normal 
conditions. He turned away and the nurses looked into each other's 
faces in astonishment. They too turned away. She was taken to her 
room, and when she regained consciousness she began to inquire 
as to why they had not operated. The nurses said : "We do not know. 
The physician said it was unnecessary." Shortly thereafter the phy- 
sician appeared and she said : "Doctor, what is the reason you have 
not performed the operation?" He said: "Because I think it unneces- 
sary, and I cannot tell you the reason why." She said : "I can. It 
is because the Lord has healed me in answer to the prayers offered 
by the members of the Church," and she bore her testimony to him. 

He was a little fearful as to subsequent developments and de- 
sired she should remain there for two weeks for safety; but the 
following day she insisted that she return to her home. To him she 
said : "I am here on borrowed money. I am well. The Lord has made 
me well, and I desire to return to my home and children. If you do 
not believe I am well, you may call any physician you desire, or any 
number of nurses, and make a thorough examination, and if you decide 
I am not thoroughly healed and well, I shall remain as long as you 
desire me to." He said : "That is fair enough." They made a thorough 
examination, only to find that every organ of the body had resumed 
its normal position and condition, so to her he said : "Go home." Since 
that day she has enjoyed health that she never before enjoyed in her 
life. She looks ten years younger, has put on fifteen pounds of flesh 
and looks almost like a different being. The doctor said: "I cannot 
account for it," but I know, as she knows, that it was the power of 
the Lord in answer to the prayer of faith that healed this woman. I 
have heard upon several occasions, though I have not verified this 



ELDER JOSEPH W. MCMURRIN 



73 



statement, that to this circumstance the doctor has referred, while 

speaking to some of his professional associates, as the " 'Mormon' 
miracle." 

I testify that the power of the Lord is in this Church, that he 
hears and answers prayers, that our Father rules on high; that his 
Son is the Redeemer of the world, that Joseph Smith is his prophet, 
and this is the Lord's work. This is my testimony in the name of 
Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER JOSEPH W. McMURRIN 

(Of the First Council of Seventy and President of the California 

Mission. ) 

I am glad, my brethren and sisters, for the opportunity of at- 
tending this conference. My soul has been made to rejoice in listen- 
ing to the splendid counsels that have been imparted, and in hear- 
ing the testimonies that have been delivered concerning the won- 
derful work of the Lord'. It falls to my lot, at the present time, to 
labor in the California mission. California, as you all know, is a 
state of considerable renown. There are things transpiring there 
that perhaps do not occur anywhere else in the world, as far as I 
know. There are a great many people in California who are there 
for pleasure, who have come from other sections of the nation, and 
from other nations, in order to enjoy the wonderful climate of 
California, and to spend the money that they gathered together. 
It is a common thing in Southern California for Canadian people 
to hold a reunion, and people who are from New York, and from 
Iowa, and from Illinois, and practically all of the other states of 
the Union; they come together in large numbers. It is astonishing 
at times, to note the number who congregate in these various re- 
unions from other nations and states in the United States. I do 
not know whether anything of this character is found elsewhere 
in the nation or not. 

I think there is a general feeling that the people of California 
are not seeking for religion. Nevertheless, I am very happy to be 
able to report that there are many very excellent people in the State, 
of California, and that many of them give the missionaries oppor- 
tunity to expound the principles of the gospel which they have been 
sent to teach; and there are a few who are convinced of the truth 
of that message, who yield obedience to the doctrines and become 
identified with the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 
There are many people of our own faith who appear to be attracted 
to that state, and we are receiving hundreds of men and women 
who come from the various wards and stakes here in Zion to identify 
themselves with the branches of the Church that are located in Cali- 
fornia. We have some very excellent Latter-day Saints, just as good 
as can be found in any other part of the Church or in any 



74 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 

other mission, men and women who are devoted to the service of the 
Lord, who feel that they are under obligation to live the principles 
of the gospel and to convince others, by the example they set, they 
have indeed received the truth ; men and women who are that 
willing to give their time for the building up of the Church and for 
the strengthening of the organizations that have been effected in 
various parts of the mission. In fact, there is a spirit, in connec- 
tion with missionary work, which seems to seize hold of many 
people who have been indifferent' to their religious duties here in 
the wards at home, and they become aroused to the necessity of de- 
voting a little of their time to the service of God and the advance- 
ment of his work. We have had the joy of seeing a good many who 
formerly have been quite careless and neglectful, turn their attention 
to the work of God and render special service in advancing our Mas- 
ter's interests. I am very glad to be able to report that we have a 
corps of missionaries who are interested in preaching the gospel, 
and who, notwithstanding they feel weak, are bearing testimony, to 
the truth as it has been revealed; and even in California, the power 
of God is made manifest. 

Just a few weeks ago, a telephone message was received, an- 
swered by a young elder of just a few months' experience. A person 
desired to know if he could be administered to. He was not a 
member of the Church, but expressed a belief in the truths of 
the gospel as it has been taught by the missionaries. He was informed 
that if he had faith to believe that God, our Father in heaven, would 
hear and answer the prayers of his servants, there would be no ob- 
jection to his coming to receive the healing ordinance. He came into 
the office on crutches, and two young boys, in the fear of God, an- 
nointed him with holy oil, and laid their hands upon him. They 
rebuked the trouble that had been preying upon him for a) long period 
of time, and when the ordinance was completed and one of those 
elders took his crutches and offered them to the man, he looked up 
into his face, smiled, and said: "My brother, you don't know what 
has taken place. I am healed!" He walked from the building with- 
out his crutches; and, on the following day he accompanied the 
missionaries on a ten-block walk to show them the residence of a 
person they were seeking; and he has continued free from the ail- 
ment that held him down for a long time. 

So that, God is in California, notwithstanding its pleasures, and 
the fact that there are tens of thousands of people who think little 
of him, and who are not seeking for religion. There are other men 
who love the Lord, who are willing to listen to the testimonies borne 
by his servants, who hearken to the doctrines that are expounded, 
who are going to believe by the power of God and the Holy Ghost 
that they come in contact with the truth, who have the courage, even 
in pleasure-seeking California, to cast their lot with the people of God, 



ELDER JOSEPH W. MCMURRIN

and to give of their time and their substance that the purposes of God 
may be accomplished. 

In California, in this time of stress, we have asked the people to 
think of the missionaries. I would like to say to the fathers and mothers.., 
here at home and in that mission, that Latter-day Saints have 
responded quite liberally and have contributed of their means, that 
others who were in distressed financial conditions might be aided, 
and possibly prevented from returning home. I am glad to say that 
we have missionaries today who are faithfully pursuing their labors, 
who have been preserved in the mission field by the faith and liberality 
of the Latter-day Saints who are in California; for, in every confer- 
ence of the California mission, there are people who have contributed 
of their substance, that they might help the missionaries, that none 
of them should return home before their labors are completed. Of 
course, they have not been able to prevent some of the missionaries 
from returning; but they are helping, according to their substance, 
to provide for them. 

I suppose it is natural, when one is engaged in missionary work, 
that he feels that the important thing, as announced in this conference, 
is the message that has been delivered by President Heber J. Grant 
in relation to missionary work. I hope fathers and mothers will take 
to their hearts the message as it has fallen from the lips of the prophet 
of the Lord. I think there is very great necessity for such a message. 
I have never before come in contact with a spirit like the spirit which 
prevails in some sections, at the present time — (the spirit of the 
missionaries and some fathers and mothers, that they know when 
their sons and daughters should be released from the mission field. 
I have had considerable experience in the mission field and 
I have never before come in contact, in any other missionary 
labor, with a spirit of this sort. I know what my own feelings were and 
the feelings of my companions, in my early missionary experience. 
Why, we would have died in the mission field before we would have 
suggested to the mission president that we ought to be released to 
return home. I myself have recommended men to he released because 
of ill health, when I have had fear in my heart that they would lay their 
bodies down in a foreign land, and they have pleaded, in tears, that 
they might be permitted to remain in the mission field. They had an 
absolute feeling of opposition to such a release, and a determination 
to remain and fulfil the mission to which they had been appointed. 
I have had men, right on this temple block, almost command me 
as the president of the California mission, to release their sons to 
return home. I have received letters from fathers, from various 
sections, intimating that they will no longer provide the means to 
sustain their sons in the mission field. I recognize the fact that we 
do live in strenuous times, that fathers and mothers are having great 
difficulty to provide the necessary means to meet the expenses of 



76 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



tbeir missionary sons and daughters, but I do not believe that it is 
the right or the prerogative of any father to write to the mission 
president demanding the release of his son or daughter. I believe the 
proper course to pursue is to confer with the authorities at home, 
those who know the conditions and circumstances, and if it be neces- 
sary for them to be called from the missionary field, let them be 
called because of recommendations that have been made by the bishops, 
or stake presidents, who are familiar with all the circumstances. There 
is no desire to hold men in the missionary field to the injury of fathers 
and mothers ; but there is a desire, a strong desire, that when the Lord 
God Almighty has touched the souls of young men, has made them 
know the truth, and has fired them with a desire to preach the 
gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ, they shall be given the oppor- 
tunity, and not be called home to their sorrow and disappointment, 
and to the weakening of their own faith. I would that the men of 
Israel might sense the obligation that rests upon them in relation to 
the preaching of the gospel. It is not only the call of the president of 
the Church, but, as he quoted from the Scriptures, it is the call of 
God. He that is warned, let him warn his neighbor. When I think 
of the great hosts of men who have been specially ordained as 
witnesses of the Lord, Jesus Christ, men of power, men of experience, 
men of capacity, and not one of them in the missionary field, I do not 
think that a very extravagant statement. 

There are only boys in the mission field, boys in their teens. 
You men of thirty years of age, forty years of age, filled with 
physical power, and the power of God, is there not responsibility 
upon you in relation to the preaching of the gospel? I think there is, 
and I think it ought to be possible, in the midst of the hosts of men 
who have this experience and ability, for a few of them to be standing 
by the side of the boys and girls who manifest their faith and their 
willingness to preach the gospel of the Redeemer. I thank God that 
notwithstanding their feeling of weakness, wonderful development 
takes place among these young men and women. I thank God that the 
boys and girls in the mission field have been made to know the truth 
of the gospel just as thoroughly as their fathers and mothers know it, 
by the experience that has come to them as preachers of righteousness. 
We ask for help, I wonder if there is any mission president who 
could say, when one of his missionaries found financial difficulty, 
that a bishop has felt that responsibility was upon the community 
that he represented, and that the people have been 1 called upon to 
contribute a little of their means, that their boy or girl might 
preach the gospel? There are many of that kind, I fear, but I believe 
this responsibility is upon every ward, and upon every stake; and 
that, notwithstanding financial stress, there are means in the land to 
provide for missionaries, if the people have the disposition. I think this 



ELDER JUNIUS F. WELLS 



77 



disposition should be cultivated, that the gospel message might he 
carried to the people, that repentance may be 1 called among the 
people, and men and women may be invited to the waters of 
baptism, to receive, by the holy ordinance, the remission of their 
sins, and by the laying on of hands, be brought in communication 
with the Holy Ghost and receive from God our Father a knowledge 
of the truth as it has been revealed. 

That is your business just as much as it it my busi- 
ness. I happen to be in the mission field today ; in may be 
your turn tomorrow. All of us should be lending assistance, 
that our skirts may be free from the blood of our fellow men. I thank 
God for the gospel. I rejoice in preaching it. I am glad to be a 
missionary. I am proud of my associates. I am glad to bring to fathers 
and mothers the glad news that their sons and daughters love the 
truth, and that they comprehend, measurably, the great plan of 
salvation. I bear record to the work of God, to the power of God. 
I bear record of the truth of the promises of God, in relation to the 
development of his purposes and the triumph of his work. God help 
us all to do this, for ever and for ever, and be found at the post 
of duty by night and by day, I humbly pray in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen.

Young and Elma Young, violin obligato by Willard Weihe, with

ELDER JUNIUS F. WELLS 

{Assistant Church Historian.) 

I esteem it a very high privelege to mingle my voice with the voices 
of my brethren, in declaring the kingdom of God and his righteous- 
ness before the great congregations of his people. I esteem it a 
very great privilege to be present at this conference, the first I have 
attended since President Grant succeeded to the presidency of the 
Church. I rejoice in seeing the manifestation of the spirit and power 
of his bigh office resting upon him, as I have witnessed it resting 
upon all of his predecessors, except Joseph Smith, the prophet, whom 
I did not know. I rejoice, my brethren and sisters, in the progress, 
of the work of the Lord. I recall fifty years ago sitting in this house 
listening to that great prophet and apostle of our Lord Jesus Christ,, 
Elder Orson Pratt. Upon that occasion he told of his conversion 
to the gospel at the age of nineteen, immediately after which he- 
set out afoot, on a journey of between two hundred and three hun- 
dred miles, that he might visit Joseph Smith and gaze upon the- 
face of that remarkable man. He was satisfied, when he did so, that; 




78 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



he stood in the presence of a prophet of God, and he received the 
ministry of that prophet. He was called immediately into the service 
of the Lord and the prophet told him that it was his destiny to be a 
preacher of the gospel; that the time should come- — this was only 
five months after the organization of the church, in 1830 — when 
twelve apostles should be chosen such as there had been in the 
days of Christ, and that he should be one of them. This astonished 
Elder Pratt, beyond measure, but he lived to realize the fulfilment 
of that prophecy, within five years, in 1835, when the apostles' 
quorum was organized. I recall upon the occasion of this wonderful 
discourse that Elder Pratt expressed his happiness and joy in the 
great progress that the work of the Lord had made up to that time. 
He foretold, in quoting from the scriptures, from the prophets and 
from the Psalms, the time when the fulness of times of the gentiles 
should come in. He still declared, after preaching for forty years, ever . 
since the organization of the Church, that the time was coming 
and should be fulfilled within the generation in which the Church 
was organized. He did not pretend to say just how soon it should 
be fulfilled, but he said : "Forty years have passed since we com- 
menced to declare that this time was approaching. I do not know that 
I shall live to see the fulfilment of the prophecy concerning it, when 
the ambassadors of the Church, the elders, shall go 1 forth, not so 
particularly to the gentiles, but shall turn from therm and go forth 
particularly to declare the word of the Lord to the Jews and to 
the descendants of Jacob, others of the house of Israel. That time 
is coming, he said, when there shall come forth from God a direct 
commandment to His servants that they should carry this message to 
the house of Israel, and, that they should go swiftly. They should 
be welcome when they then go in their ministry. He said that 
hundreds would receive them, and thousands and tens of thousands 
would welcome them for they should go in power: "In the day of 
my power, saith the Lord, my people shall welcome me." He 
pointed to the young men who were assembled in the congregation. 
I happened to be one of them, and it seemed to me that he was 
pointing at me. Anyway, I was thrilled to the marrow of my bones, 
for he said : "You young men, who are sitting before me, will see the 
fulfilment of the times of the gentiles, when this message shall 
be taken to all the house of Israel. The responsibility of carrying it 
rests upon you, and God will require it at your hands." A year 
after that, very much to my surprise, I was called to go on a mis- 
sion. I was but a boy, and I desired to go to college instead; but 
my father said he could not send me to college, and proposed that I 
should go on a mission. I said: "Very well, I will go, get through 
with my mission, come home and go to college on my own account." 
He placed his hands on my shoulders and said: "You will never 
get through going on a mission, not as long as you are a Latter- 



£L££tf JUNIUS F. WELLS . 79 

day Saint." That seemed a hard saying. Instead of then giving me 
two or three hours' instruction he said : "Get the spirit of your 
mission. Don't know too much but believe all you can. I guess I 
needed that. I had not been in my field of labor, in old England, 
more than a few weeks when I obtained the spirit of my mission ; 
then I understood what my father meant, and I declare to you, my 
brethren and sisters, that froml the moment I received the testimony 
of my mission, of my calling in the priesthood, and of my right to 
speak in the name of the Lord to my fellow creatures, it has been 
inconceivable down to the present moment when I should not be 
a missionary— in one fashion or another. I believe I have been, 
sometimes not very useful, but at other times perhaps more so, 
in different ways engaged in promulgating this work now for fifty 
years, and I thank God for it with all my soul, that I have been, 
in His mercy and providence, thought fit to perform some part 
in carrying on this great wprk. 

I rejoice in the greatness of this work, in the prosperity of 
this people, in the approach of that condition of power that its mes- 
sage w'l! be welcome throughout the length and breadth of the earth, 
when it shall be carried as it has never been carried before, when it 
shall be taken on swift wings, through the clouds, on the wings of 
the wind. I was telling a Catholic priest the other day that some of 
those angels the Apostle John saw flying in the midst of heaven, 
did not have feathers; but they were in flying machines, and that we 
Latter-day Saints expected to carry the gospel like the angels sung 
of by the prophets of old, to every nation, kindred, tongue and peo- 
ple, flying with the everlasting gospel to preach to them that dwell 
upon the earth. I have seen that partly fulfilled already in watch- 
ing President George Albert Smith and his son soar up from the 
Hangar in Brussels and fly away to London in an aeroplane — angels, 
ambassadors of the Lord, having the gospel of Jesus Christ to preach 
to them that dwell in Great Britain. We will send many of our 
missionaries that way, in the time of many of you, young men. 

I rejoice, my brethren and sisters, in the testimony the. Lord 
has given me. I know that his power, that his Priesthood is upon 
the earth and that we who bear it have a message that mankind 
stands in dire need of. There is no salvation outside of the ministry 
of the Church of Jesus Christ to the children of men, and no other 
people possess it, but this people, to whom it was given through 
the ministry of Joseph Smith the prophet. 

May God help us to be worthy and stand firmly, and assist 
in promulgating the truth, to the salvation of our fellow creatures, 
is my humble prayer in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 




80 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 

ELDER RULON S. WELLS 

(Of the First Council of Seventy) 

When I look out over this vast congregation of men and women,I 
am deeply impressed with the benefits, as well as the obligations, that 
come to us by reason of that wonderful association which we have with 
one another. I am also led to reflect that with every association that 
we form thene will come certain obligations and we may derive certain 
benefits. When our father Adam was placed in the garden of Eden, he 
was there alone. He formed no association with other men, for there 
were none, but he stood alone. Under conditions of that kind, isolated 
as he was , it became his solemn duty to make of himself a splendid and 
suitable companion. This everyone can do when he becomes isolated, 
by the development of holy meditation, by keeping himself clean and 
unspotted from sin, by being worthy, by taking proper care of him- 
self, both bodily and spiritually. But the Lord saw that it was not 
good for man to be alone and he gave Eve unto Adam to be his 
wife, and thus a new association was formed, and with that association 
came additional benefits and likewise additional obligations, the obliga- 
tion of husband to wife and wife to husband. When children came, 
a new and enlarged association was formed and with it came the 
additional benefits of the family organization, and also the obligation 
of father and mother to their children and the obligations of the 
children to their father and to their mother. It is then incumlbent upon 
all who form this family association that they shall discharge with 
fidelity the obligations resting upon them in order that they may 
receive the benefits that come by reason of it. 

So it is with every association that we form and there are many of 
them. There are business associations, co-partnerships, joint stock in- 
stitutions, and whenever such associations are formed they likewise 
have their obligations and benefits, and it becomes incumbent upon 
all to discharge, with fidelity and with honor, those obligations and 
thereby reap the benefits. Human beings, essentially social in their 
nature, continue to enlarge the scope of their association and form 
themselves into civil governments. All nations, kindreds, tongues and 
peoples together with their subdivisions into states, counties, municipali- 
ties constitute such associations, some better than others, because they 
are better governed or organized under better laws than others, but 
responsibilities and obligations come to each member of such asso- 
ciation commensurate with the amount of power or influence that 
the individual member of that association exercises and can or is 
permitted to exercise for the benefit of those with whom he is associated. 

In a despotism, an absolute monarchy, where the king rules, and 
the people only submit, great is the obligation of the king, but the 
individual citizen's obligation is correspondingly less. In our own gov- 
ernment, where the people rule, each individual citizen is a ruler in the 



ELDER RULON S. WELLS 



81 



. nation and great is his responsibility ; great are the obligations that 
rest upon him by reason of that citizenship, for he himself is a 
ruler, a sovereign, and helps to form and fashion the government 
of which he is one of its rulers. If we have good government it is 
because the individual citizens are good. If we have a bad government 
it is because the individual citizens are bad. That applies not only 
to the nation at large, but to the state, to the county and to the city. 

In this great republic, where all just powers are derived from the 
consent of the governed, how great is the responsibility of the 
individual citizen. How we ought to discharge, with fidelity, the 
obligations incumbent upon us as citizens! 'No citizen of this re- 
public has the right to find fault with his government, unless he has 
exercized his power and his rights as one of those citizens, endeavor- 
ing to make the government what it ought to be. No citizen who 
has not exercised this power has the right to blame the sheriff or 
the mayor or the governor or any other officer of the state if, 
perchance, the laws of his state are not being enforced within the 
state or the county or the city in which he lives, for it is his own 
fault and he can blame no other ; but when he has done his part, then 
he can be justified, and not otherwise. 

What a wonderful privilege it is to' be a citizen of a republic where 
every citizen has an equal right. He should then exercise the same 
for the welfare and exaltation of the people. "Righteousness exalteth 
a nation, but sin is a reproach to any people." Sin should not be 
permitted to go rampant when it is a violation of law, and every 
good citizen will see that he does his part to have wholesome laws 
passed, and that they are executed and administered as they should 
be, in the spirit of right and in opposition to wrong. When we 
read in our newspaper files of the gross transgression of law all over 
the land, the people violating the provisions of the Constitution, 
which we believe has been inspired of God, how our hearts must be 
filled with indignation against this wanton violation of law. When we 
see such wholesome legislation, as the law prohibiting the sale and 
manufacture of intoxicating liquor,, wantonly being violated, and 
how many officers there are who perhaps are not in sympathy with the 
law or, what is worse, corrupted by the bribes of the law breakers, 
wink at such violations, how humiliated we must feel when we realize 
that these are the men whom we have chosen to execute the laws, 
and we are therefore ourselves to blame. Indifference to politics, 
neglect to attend primaries, apathy in matters of such vital im- 
portance as the government for which we are directly responsible, 
will not exonerate us from this blame. 

There is another association to which I desire to call your 
Mention, a still grander and greater one than those which form 
the nations of the earth. It is all-embracing in its scope. It is 
the Church and kingdom of God; and in looking out upon this 



82 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



congregation, made up of men and women coming from every nation 
andf r heaven, formed under a supreme law, the perfect law of liberty, 
the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ, designed to exalt the children 
of God, to liberate them from the bondage of sin, governed by the 
gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ, the only plan by which men and 
women can be brought in harmony with the will of their Creator, 
Low my heart thrills with joy and my bosom swells with pride 
to feel that I am a member of it. Then I think of the obligations; 
and Oh, how great the benefits ! Our obligations to God ; the Giver 
of all good, a life of devotion and obedience to his law; our 
obligations to one another as members of this great association; 
a life of honesty and integrity, of virtue, of brotherly love; our 
obligation to ourselves, to keep ourselves clean and unspotted from the 
sins of the world. In short, the obligations of this Association are so 
all-embracing that they include within them all the obligations of 
every proper association which we may form, and preclude our mem- 
bership in any other. 

Those who faithfully discharge the obligation of this association 
will incidentally fulfil those of all the rest, the obligations of husbands 
and' wives, of parents, and children, business obligations, and the 
obligations of citizenship. Unfaithful husbands and' wives are not good 
members of the Church. Parents who fail to teach their children, 
both by precept , and example, are not good members. Men and 
women who violate the laws of their country, state and city, and 
especially officers who wink at such violation, or who conspire or 
join in their violation are not only not good citizens, but they are like- 
wise not good Latter-day Saints. Not only is it an obligation to lead' a 
clean and virtuous life, an honest and moral life in our association 
as members of the Church, but also in every other association. No 
man is a good citizen if he leads an immoral life. No officer is 
a good citizen who winks at and condones the violations of law. 
Such men may be found who will cry themselves hoarse in lauding 
the "Stars and Stripes," and prate about the Constitution and the 
principles of human liberty, and are frequently found at the primaries 
and conventions seeking nominations to public office, but if they 
are unclean they are not good citizens. "When the wicked rule the 
people mourn." Hence the obligation to choose good men and wise 
men for places of public trust 

Many and great are the blessings to be derived from our associa- 
tion in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, but they may 
only be realized when we fulfil the obligations in connection there- 
with, the obligations of faith in God and repentance from sin, the 
works of obedience to the law of the gospel. Then shall we be cleansed 
from sin in the blood of the Lamb of God, then shall we be enlightened 
by his Holy Spirit, then shall we grow in the knowledge of God and 
good works day by day, and finally receive the crown of life which 
the Lord has promised to them that love him, even "Eternal Life,"

God's greatest gift to his faithful sons and daughters. May they all 
be yours, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ, the Lord. Amen. 

ELDER J. GOLDEN KIMBALL 

(Of the First Council of Seventy.) 

During our two day's conference I have listened with a great 
deal of interest to what our brethren have said to us. My mind has 
been very active during the conference, and I have thought about a 
great many wonderful things, to me, that might sound very flat to 
you ; but for some reason, this afternoon, I feel like a fellow who 
had run entirely out of material, having exhausted the material that 
I had, in thought. I think of what Elbert Hubbard said. It struck me 
rather strangely the other day. He said : "If you are going to reform 
the world you had better begin with yourself, and there will be one 
rogue less in the world." Of course, I did not want to apply that to 
myself, but I would not object to japplying it to you. 

Now, brethren and sisters, I shall address you for a short period 
of time, only a few minutes — although it seems a long time to you, 
and does to ffie; it certainly will before I get through. My voice has 
been heard among this people for nearly thirty years. I think I have 
been in the ministry here at home for nearly that length of time. I 
would not give my experience and the association I have had with 
the brethren of the authorities for all the riches in the world. I hope, 
brethren and sisters, that during these thirty years, I' have created an 
impression in your minds — at, least I have tried to do that — that I am 
trying to be honest. I am trying to be truthful. I am trying to be 
sincere and loyal and unafraid. There is nothing that I desire more, 
outside of the Spirit of God and the honoring of the Priesthood and 
the sustaining of this work, than to have an honest mind. It seems to 
me during the past few years that the minds of many are warped. 
We do not think honest; we do not hear straight, nor do' we see 
straight. I am sure, from the experience I have had in the Church, 
that the Lord can do very little for a man who persists in being 
dishonest and untruthful; and, of course, it goes without saying that 
no man or woman in the Church of Jesus Christ can be immoral, 
and have the Spirit of God to be with them. I read in the Doctrine 
and Covenants the message that was given to the elders in early days. 
The Lord said : "But with some I am not well pleased." Now, what 
was their trouble? "Because they will not open their mouths but hide 
the talent which I have given unto them, because of the fear of man. 
Woe unto such, for mine anger is kindled against them, and it shall 
come to pass if they are not more faithful unto me it shall be taken 
away even that which they have." I realize, my brethren and sisters, 
that, during the past thirty years I may have said some foolish things. 
I have, in my own way, given the people a good deal of chaff to get 
them to take a little wheat, but some of them haven't got sense enough 
to pick the wheat out from the chaff. If a man in this Church ever does 



84 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



say a foolish thing, they will remember it to the very day of their 
death ; and it is the only thing some of them do remember. I think 
they do mighty well to remember that. . 

I find out some things by reading the Doctrine and Covenants — 
which, by the way, I do read. I am familiar with the Bible, a little, 
•and the Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and Covenants and the Pearl 
of Great Price. I have wished, sometimes, that there would be a big 
fire and burn all the rest of the books so that we would read these 
books more. Sometimes I feel that a man ought to be imprisoned for 
writing any more books ; because I got my experience mostly by 
reading the books which contain the revelations of the Lord. I got 
my first experience in the Southern states in two years, and I read the 
Bible; I read the Book of Mormon; and I read the Doctrine and 
Covenants and the Pearl of Great Price. I don't believe the man lives, 
unless God inspires him, who can ever breathe into a book what you 
can get out of the Bible, Book of Mormon, Doctrine and Covenants 
£nd' Pearl of Great Price. That is my testimony. Joseph Smith said 
that a man will live nearer to the gospel of Christ reading the Book 
of Mormon than any other book that has ever been written. I want 
to say to the Latter-day Saints that according to my judgment and 
experience — I am old enough to know a few things, and I am old 
enough to remember some things — some of the greatest inspired men 
we have ever had in the history of this Church have been men who 
have read the Bible, the Book of Morroon, the Doctrine and Covenants 
and the Pearl of Great Price. Now, brethren, I do not want to say 
anything to hurt anyone's feelings about books that are written. I 
read the Bible through once, and when I got through I said : "I will 
never tackle it again in the flesh ;" but I have read in it, and I am 
acquainted with it, and I have marked it. I would not give my Bible 
for all the Bibles in the world, because it is the only Bible I can find 
anything in. 

The first council ordained one thousand and forty seventies last 
year. The Lord has said in the Doctrine and Covenants : "There are 
many called and few are chosen." As I said, there were one thousand 
and forty seventies ordained last year; and why are they not chosen? 
The Lord gives us the answer clear and plain. I am glad he talks 
plainly. Why are they not chosen? "Because their hearts are so much 
set upon the things of the world, and they aspire to the honors of 
men." They would break their blamed necks to get an office in the 
state or in the nation. I haven't heard of anyone breaking his neck 
to go on a mission — not lately. Now brethren, I know what the trouble 
is. You remember not very long ago that Brother Hyrum M. Smith, 
when he presided over the European mission, sent word to us and gave 
the sign of distress, like all these mission presidents are doing now. 
He wanted one hundred capable, efficient, competent men — just what 
they need in every mission in the world. So the First Council started 
out to get them. We made a thorough canvas, and we never dreamed 



ELDER J. GOLDEN KIMBALL 



85 



but what we could get one hundred out of the councils of quorums, 
the presidents of seventies, without any trouble at all. We interviewed 
those seventies by the hundreds, personally interviewed them, looked 
them in the face, and we never found one single president that was 
not willing to go, not one that I remember, but when we looked into 
their financial affairs they could not go. They seemed to be alright 
spiritually, but it was their financial troubles. That is the trouble now. 

I believe in all that President Grant said. I preached it years 
ago, after I went broke, with just as much vehemence as he ever 
did in his life. I preached until I was almost exhausted. I remember 
a sermon. I think it was a very wonderful discourse, too. I was up 
in Smithfield at a conference, and I preached to the people on the 
subject of debt. I had just been through the mill of the gods, and 
they ground me to powder. I went "over the hill to the poor house," 
and I think I was able to tell them a pathetic story; they sold 
me out, just like they would sell cattle; and yet I was in the mission- 
ary field at that. I told my story, and told it very plaintively; and 
there was a salesman at this meeting. I saw him the other day at one 
of our conference meetings. That made me think of it. He was a 
salesman of the Co-operative Wagon and Machine Company. After 
I preached my discourse I met this man and he said: "Brother 
Kimball, that is the best sermon I ever heard. I never sold as many 
implements in my life as I did after you preached that sermon." 
After I had warned the people and forewarned them, that to be in 
debt was to be in hell — I don't know anything about hell, but that 
is the worst hell I have ever been in — to be in debt. I can tell you 
how you can keep out of debt; but I can't tell you how to get out 
after you get in. I had a man come to me the other day who wanted 
me to indorse his note. I had sworn, almost on an oath, I would 
never sign another note, not even for my wife. But he looked at me 
so pitifully, and was in such dire distress, and I had so much confi- 
dence in him, that I told him I would sign it, although I was quite 
sure I could not pay it if he did not. He applied at one of our banks. 
They did not know me, for which I was very thankful. I went to 
the bank and looked the man in the face. He said: "Mr. Kimball, 
haven't you got any collaterals?" I said: "Collaterals — I should say 
not ! I haven't got a collateral of any kind." He said, "How do you 
expect me to take your indorsement?" I replied, "On my looks and 
general character. That is all I have got." And he turned me down ; 
and I have been tickled to death ever since. That is the way to keep out 
of debt. 

I thought I would like to read some scripture as a closing of 
my remarks : I am sure I can make it in two minutes. It is something 
my father read, in reading from his old Book of Mormon, that was 
published or printed in 1830. I found this page worn almost out, and 
I wondered what it was. This is what I found. It was just such a 
■condition that we are now in. They had had war, and they had had 
famine, and then they went to the prophet and appealed to the Lord, 
so that the famine was withdrawn, and it says: "That ended the

eighty and fifth year." In thirteen years that people fell down two 
or three times, and yet they were God's people. This is what he said. 
I want to read it to you and impress you, if I can, with this one 
thought : "And thus we can behold how false and also the unsteadiness 
of the hearts of the children of men; yea, we can see the Lord in his 
great infinite goodness doth bless and prosper those who put their 
trust in him. Yea, and we may see at the very time when he doth 
prosper his people, yea, in the increase of their fields, their flocks 
and their herds, and in gold, and in silver, and in all manner of 
precious things of every kind and art; sparing their lives, and deliver- 
ing them out of the hands of their enemies; softening the hearts 
of their enemies that they should not declare wars against them; 
yea, and in fine, doing all things for the welfare and happiness of his 
people; yea, then is the time," — Now that strikes me as a strange 
thing. After God has done all that for his children, and it could not 
be written any better if it was written of this people, how God had 
blessed them — "then is the time that they do harden their hearts, and 
do forget the Lord their God and do trample under their feet the Holy 
One — yea, and this because of their ease, and their exceedingly great 
prosperity. 

"And thus we see that except the Lord doth chasten his people 
with many afflictions, yea, except he doth visit them with death and 
with terror and with famine and with all manner of pestilence, they 
will not remember him." 

We are just like all other children of God, in all other dispensa- 
tions. Notwithstanding the fact that we are a chosen people, for a 
special purpose, our hearts have been hardened and we have forgotten 
our God — some of us. Now, brethren, I think you 1 will have no 
trouble in getting out of debt. At least you can get out as well as I 
have. 

Now, brethren and sisters, I am glad; I thank my God that he 
chastened mle. I thank God that I have had the love and affection 
of my brethren. I thank God that I am alive. I know the gospel is 
true. I know it because I learned it through adversity and through 
suffering and through hardships. I never learned it because I w]as 
Heber C. Kimball's son, because I was the son of a prophet. I learned 
it just as he learned it. I may not have paid as big a price as my 
f|ather did, but I paid for pretty nearly everything I have. I paid well 
for it, but I am satisfied. I sustain the brethren of the authorities, 
and I uphold their hands. I never felt better in all my ministry in this 
Church than I do today. I thank God the sun shines. I thank God the 
grass is green, and the water runs down hill; as it did not for a long 
while. Now the Lord bless you. Amen. 

The choir and congregation sang, "Redeemer of Israel," and 
Conference adjourned until 10 o'clock, a. m., Sunday, October 9. 
The closing prayer was offered by Elder C. Alvin Orme, President 
of the Tooele stake of Zion. 



THIRD DAY 



On Sunday morning, October 9, at 10 o'clock, the Conference 
continued, the Tabernacle being filled to its full capacity, every seat 
and isle being occupied, and hundreds were standing by the doors; 
besides, there were crowded overflow meetings at the Assembly Hall 
and the Bureau of Information. President Heber J. Grant presided. 

The choir and congregation sang, "Come, come, ye Saints." 

Prayer was offered by Elder William N. Patten, President of 
the Lost River stake of Zion. 

The choir sang the hymn, "When dark and drear the skies 
appear," words by Emily Hill Woodmansee, and music by Pro- 
fessor Joseph J. Daynes, former Tabernacle organist.

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

I really believe that this is the largest gathering I have ever seen 
in this Tabernacle of a Sunday morning. I am told that the Assembly 
Hall is full and running over, and that there are several hundred people 
still standing up. It will therefore be necessary to hold an overflow 
meeting. 

In announcing the hymn, "When dark and drear the skies ap- 
pear," President Grant remarked: The words of this very splendid 
hymn are by Sister Emily Hill Woodmansee, the music by our late or- 
-ganist, Joseph J. Daynes. No person that I ever knew, lived more per- 
fectly in keeping with these beautiful words than the good sister who 
wrote them. She came to this country,, dragging a hand cart all the way 
from the Missouri River to the Salt Lake Valley. She lived and died 
one of the true and faithful Latter-day Saints. She has written some of 
the most inspiring of the many inspiring hymns that we have in our 
hymn book. 



ELDER CHARLES W. NIBLEY 

(Presiding Bishop of the Church) 

Well may we sing "Providence is over all." Whto is there 
that can doubt that the hand of Providence governs and directs 
in the affairs of this great Nation of which we form a part? Is 
there any one of us who can doubt, that the hand of the Lord is 
over all the nations of the earth, that they all are his children, 
and that he has care for them all? Is there any one of us who 
has any doubt, looking at this vast congregation, that the Lord is with 
us? The incentive, the motive, that brings these semi-annual gath-

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



erings, is a testimony, an evidence to us that the Lord is still 
with his people. It has been remarked during this conference that 
there never was a time when there was more evidence of the Spirit 
cf the Lord in the hearts of the people in respect to matters spirit- 
ual — temple work, priesthood work, the desire to perform the la- 
bors that the priesthood are called upon to perform — than there is 
now among the people. The Lord is operating through his Spirit in 
the hearts of this body of priesthood, the priesthood of the Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, in a most marvelous manner. 
Truly, I thought, as I came into this building this morning: "This 
is a marvelous work." It is a wonder to me to see this large body 
of men ; for, where we go in Church association, and congregations 
generally, outside of this Church, the great majority, so far as I 
have been able to observe, are women who take a most active part— 
and the Lord blesses them for doing it— but here we have not only 
our sisters, who take a most wonderful and splendid part in the ac- 
tivities of the Church, but we have such a crowd of men here, good 
men, able men, men who want to do right, men who are doing 
right, clean men, and trying to keep the commandments of the 
Lord. It is wonderful to me. How does it all come about? Whose 
power is it that does this, that accomplishes this? Is it the power 
of man? No, it is the power of the Almighty God, the power that 
resides in the priesthood of the Church. The power of the Lord has 
truly always been over the nation. The nations are in his hands. 
When he undertakes to break down this power or the other, it is 
easy for him to do it'. When he with-draws his spirit from the child- 
ren of men they are left to themselves, and we see it. We can go 
through history and see instances, repeatedly, where the people have 
been left to themselves, through their wickedness, and they have 
gone into unbelief and darkness, and have dwindled away. He says 
in the revelations, in the last days, that he would finally withdraw 
his spirit from the people of the world if they did not repent and 
follow him. And woe be unto the people when that Spirit, which 
overrules for good, has been withdrawn from them, for that is the 
life-giving power. It is that Spirit that formed this government and 
gave us our Constitution. The Lord raised up wise men, he said, 
wise men for that very purpose. It was the Spirit of the Lord, mak- 
ing for liberty, that operated in the heart of a Martin Luther, of an 
Oliver Cromwell, and men of that character, who received a great 
portion of the Spirit of the Lord to direct them in their efforts ; and 
Providence was over all. 

The Lord has operated through them but in this body of priest- 
hood he has told us that he would give unto us more power, the 
power of Priesthood, more power than he had given to men who are 
not ordained to this Priesthood. What is this power, what is this in- 
fluence that causes them to operate in their activities in the Church 



ELDER CHARLES IV. NIB LEY

in the way that they do, so that for one thing they have not a beg- 
gar — not a beggar in all the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints, so far as we know, in any part of the world, certainly not 
one here in Zion; that is something to he noted— What is it that 
causes these sisters to sacrifice as they do of their time and of their 
means, to give their efforts for the betterment of their neighbors 
and their friends, for the uplifting of the people? It is the power 
and spirit of the Priesthood which they partake of; for, let it be 
said that while our sisters are not ordained to the Priesthood, yet 
we might just as well remember, we lords of creation, that we never 
can attain to exaltation in the Kingdom of God, not one of us, with- 
out our wives. It does not matter whether he is a president of the 
Church or what office he holds, or how great his Priesthood or 
calling: "The man is not without the woman in the Lord," in the 
Church, in the Kingdom of God. He can't be redeemed or exalted 
in the presence of God without his wife; so they partake of this 
honor, of this majesty, this power in this wonderful organization. 
Nothing like it, nothing can be thought of like it in the world, where 
there is such a union, men and women operating together, every- 
one members of the Church, everyone having a voice and a vote — 
the most democratic organization in all the world because everyone 
has that power: and, let me say, while the hand 
of the Lord is over all the nations of the world, yet 
the special power and the evidence of it that he would give to this 
people, and something more than he had ever given to any other 
people, is before us. 

I read from the 84th Section of the Doctrine of Covenants; "And 
this greater Priesthood administereth the gospel and holdeth the key 
of the mysteries of the kingdom, even the key of the knowledge of 
God;" and this is life eternal, to know him, the only true God, and 
Jesus Christ whom he hast sent. "And this greater Priesthood ad- 
ministereth the gospel and holdeth the key of the mysteries of the 
kingdom, even the key of the knowledge of God. Therefore, in the 
ordinances thereof, the power of godliness is manifest and without 
the ordinances thereof, and the authority of the Priesthood, the power 
of godliness is not manifest unto men in the flesh." That is the word 
of the Lord. That is what we have. That is what the Lord has given 
us. I do not need to ask Latter-day Saints, which is the way? They 
are not groping blindly for the way of life, for the path that leadeth to 
eternal life. They have found it. They know it. They have it. In 
the world, where they have not this konwledge of God, nor the key of 
it, nor the power that goes with it, they are more or less groping for 
the way. They have lost the way; they are feeling their way, doing 
good, no doubt, many, many millions trying to do good, and will do 
good, seeking the way of life, and yet, sometimes, when the truth is 
placed before even those who are good people and doing good, 



90 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



as was remarked here the other day, they cannot accept it because 
the sacrifice seems too great. 

But this is certain, everyone that seeketh, findeth; "If you truly 
seek, ye shall surely find." The Lord has decreed it, and, as we are 
told in the Book of Mormon, there is a promise held out, that if 
you seek with real intent, with an earnest desire to know of the 
truth, you can find it; and no man or woman who has ever put that 
matter to the test but what has been able to come to a realization and 
finally to a knowledge that this is the work of God, the Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in very deed. 

Now, my brethren and sisters, I testify of it. I know that the 
power of godliness, as I have read here from this book, is mani- 
fested in this Church, and without this Priesthood, and without the 
ordinances of the gospel, and the authority of it, the power of 
godliness is not manifest to men in the flesh, and never will be. 
It is something to be proud of and to rejoice over. I bear testimony 
to you once again that the Lord is at the head, the Lord our God 
is giving direction and guidance to this Church and people, through 
his appointed servants whom he has called, whom he has brought to 
their present positions. They did not do it themselves, not by a long 
way, nor would they for a moment attempt to claim it. They never 
did and never will; but the Lord has done it. It is marvelous in our 
sight. It is a wonder how he operates and guides and directs in all 
the activities of the Church. 

God bless you, my brethren and sisters, in this work. God bless 
our liberty-loving nation. It stands for liberty, after all. God bless 
every influence and power in every church, in every association, in 
every organization in the world, that makes for liberty and righteous- 
ness, peace on earth and good-will to all men. May the Lord help 
them, too; but in this Church, in this organization, where He 
acknowledges this Priesthood, this special gift, this special power, 
where the power of godliness is manifested through it ; and without 
it— so says the Lord, not I — the Lord says that without this Priest- 
hood and the ordinances that go with it, the ordinances of the gospel, 
the power of godliness is not manifest to men in the flesh. Amen. 



ELDER LEVI EDGAR YOUNG 

(Of the First Council of Seventy) 

My Brethren and Sisters: This conference has been one of in- 
spiring testmonies of God's work in the earth to redeem his children. 
With you, I feel to dedicate my life to better service among my fellow 
men for the cause of the Master. Service may be rendered in our 
daily activities of life, and though we feel at times how prosaic our 
duties are, yet with the Spirit of God with us, our words and deeds 



ELDER LEVI EDGAR YOUNG 



91 



may radiate new life and hope to those with whom we come in con- 
tact. Life is a way of strenuous duty, but when we have been thrilled 
with Christ's love, we do not think of self, but the good of all hu- 
manity is our aim. You recall that St. Luke tells us in exquisite words 
how the shepherds returned to their flocks after they had heard the 
angels' song, and had seen the Christ-child in the manger. Though they 
had seen the Redeemer and had partaken of his spirit, they returned 
to their daily duties with hearts full of sweetness and light, and were 
thankful for their powers to perform their daily work and duties with 
an eye single to God's glory. 

I was very much impressed with the words of Bishop Charles W. 
Nibley this morning. They contained much food for thought. They 
suggested to me a very important question for us all to think about: 
"Is the world to the point of a moral collapse ?" This question, though 
one of large proportions, should be of interest to every one who has 
an interest in life. I am an optimist, and know full well that every 
child of God has more good in him than bad, but I have come to be- 
lieve that mankind is suffering for the want of spiritual light, and that 
old standards of morality are fading away. The Christian sects today 
are teaching many false doctrines in the name of the Master ; and our 
universities and schools are giving foolish theories in the name of truth. 
Much of our teaching has become nothing but a suppression of the 
powers of the individual child to live ; and the planting in his heart of 
false conceptions of life. Today, our teaching has become mechanized ; 
and much of our education reminds me of a "Thibetan prayer-wheel, 
busily turning-, but barren of purpose." Teachers today are following 
an old time groove; they are traveling in a rut, and their words are 
barren of spiritual life and inspiration. I have a right to speak thus, 
for I am a teacher, and I realize something of our faults. It is due 
largely to the lack of spiritualizing of our children in the schools and 
churches that the world is lacking in high standards of morals. Our 
methods of teaching are wrong, because we are wanting in knowl- 
edge and spiritual insight into humanity's heart. Our schools and 
churches must be revolutionized and made to come into the new age 
in standards and in a knowledge of God's purposes. 

Last evening, I had the pleasure of listening to our friend, Dr. 
Schwartz. He made a plea for Russia and the Russian people. Not 
only Russia, but all the nations of Europe need help, for their people 
are starving. They need not only bread ; but they are in sore need of 
the "bread of life," for they have strayed from the teachings of Christ, 
the Master. I wish to say to Dr. Schwartz and his people that the 
gospel of Christ Jesus is again restored to the earth in its purity ; and 
there is only one way in which his people and all peoples can come 
into the light, and that is through the Gate of Eternal Life as revealed 
by our Savior. All people must yet seek the "way, the truth, and the 
light," and mankind must unselfishly and humbly go to God for di- 
vine guidance. The Latter-day Saints declare that the Priesthood of 



92 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



God is again on the earth, and that the lives of those holding the 
Priesthood must be clean and pure. 

The spirit of man is divine. We are of God, with the same 
powers in embryo likened unto a God. We believe with all our might 
and strength that the light within us and the divinity of our own 
spirits will yet cause us to be truly and greatly educated children ; and 
we base our testimony of life on the inner light, the power and light 
of God within us. We Latter-day Saints are not basing our lives on 
gold and silver and worldly goods. While we know that we are in a 
life wherein we are to deal with materiality with the world, we do not 
believe in "pinned-on" religion or frivolous and conventional facts 
called education, but we take a stand for the real development of the 
individual and his unity and unification with God almighty and his 
great work. We are hoping that the time will come when it may be 
said of us that the Latter-day Saints are not only the most intellectual 
people in all the world, but they are the most spiritual, and they win 
souls unto the true and living God by the spiritual life they express in 
their words, actions and thoughts. "Mormonism," or the gospel of 
Jesus Christ, teaches us that the Master, Jesus Christ, is the Redeemer 
of the world. He is the Son of the living God. He is blessing us, and 
is watching the nations and all his children. We know full well that 
every individual born of woman is a child of this living God ; and we 
bear testimony to the fact that the living God has spoken, and there- 
fore it is imperative that we base our lives upon a knowledge of him 
who created all things. He lives in heaven as our Father, whose king- 
dom is to be established upon the earth. We must therefore become 
children of the light. There is too much stuck-on religion in the world. 
We do hold that that word "religion" has become more or less false 
throughout the world, but we bear our testimony to you that pure re- 
ligion, the relationship of God to man, is known through the Spirit of 
God and in no other way. All the teachings of Jesus might be put 
into a small brochure and read possibly within a period of thirty min- 
utes. Why has the Master's life influenced the world as it has done? 
Because he not only knew the truth, but was of the truth, and ths 
greatest man is the man of the truth. His whole spiritual, mental, and 
moral life is the expression of the power and divinity of Almighty 
God. 

God is watching the nations of the earth. He loves his children, 
and I believe that Russia, Germany, Austria, Turkey, and all the 
nations of earth will have great prophets and teachers who will di- 
rect those people to a higher and truer life. I do not wish to be un- 
derstood as saying that the peoples of the different nations are wholly 
in darkness. Far from that. The world is becoming more civilized, 
and all nations and peoples have given something of eternal truth to the 
world. I think, in fact, that the great religions of the world — Buddhism, 
Brahmanism, and the philosophy of Confucius have with Chris- 
tianity lifted the human race to a realization of something of the pur- 



ELDER HYRUM G. SMITH

poses of God. In the gospel of Jesus Christ is the power of all good- 
ness and truth, and in it we live and have our greatest hopes for the 
future. It will be by humble acknowledgement of God that the 
nations will be kept from a moral collapse. 

May God bless the suffering nations of Europe. May he heal 
up the wounds of the people of that great and noble nation, Great 
Britain; may he help France— the nation that has stood for the intel- 
lectual development of mankind ; may he help Italy, the nation of art 
and beauty; may he bless Germany whose people are good, and who 
have had a pride in their industrial and intellectual life ; may Russia be 
brought to the Gate of Life, for her people have a natural spirit of 
thrift and intelligence. May God bless all peoples, and may he hasten 
the day when all shall sing, "Peace on earth, good will toward men." 
May we as a people go forth from this conference with a stronger testi- 
mony of the truthfulness of the word of the Lord ; may we forget self, 
and live for the good of others. May selfishness go from our lives, 
and may we live in accordance with the laws of the divine priesthood of 
God. Then our lives will be sanctified. Amen. 

A sacred solo, "Oh, for a burst of song," was sung by Judith 
Anderson Beard. 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

President Grant read the following, dated Waterloo, Belgique, 
September 2, 1921 : Greetings from Orson F. Whitney, May Wells 
Whitney, Thomas M. Wheeler, Arthur H. Taylor, Lillian D. Lillywhite, 
John P. Lillywhite, Alvin S. Nelson. 



ELDER HYRUM G. SMITH 

{Presiding Patriarch of the Church.) 

At the sight of this wonderful congregation here, this morning 
my heart and soul are filled with blessing for this people, and praise 
to our Lord and Redeemer who sacrificed his life upon the cross 
for us and who, in these the last days, has restored to the earth 
the wonderful plan of redemption, that we all, through obedience 
unto that plan, may come back into the presence of our maker. 
I suppose about ninety-eight, or more, per cent of this wonderful 
congregation here today are descendants of that Joseph who was 
sold by his brothers, and are of the lineage of his favored son Ephraim. 
Despised by most of his brothers, and, separated from them, and 
taken into a strange land, Joseph was protected and blessed. The Lord 



94 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



made of him an instrument through which salvation came to 
many people, — a valuable lesson that you and I today, and in fact 
the whole world, if they will only learn it, may appreciate and enjoy. 
Without reading the scripture, I should like to refer those who 
do read the Bible to the life and history of that wonderful youth 
of the Lord. He was so blessed that the Lord manifested his power 
unto him. That power was so arranged that not only the people of his 
own race, his own family, were saved from famine and from many 
other conditions of life, but whole nations of people were saved. 
In fact the whole plan of his mission and ministry is a type of the 
great plan of salvation which the Lord taught unto Joseph Smith 
and which he in turn taught the people would come to pass in the 
last days. Just a verse or two: 

"And when money failed in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, 

all the Egyptians came unto Joseph and said: Give us bread, for why should 
we die in thy presence? For the money faileth." * * * 

And Joseph said: "Give your cattle; and I will give you for your 
cattle, if money fail. And they brought their cattle unto Joseph, 
and Joseph gave them bread in exchange for horses, and for the 
flocks, and for the cattle of the herds, and for the asses; and he 
fed them with bread, for all their cattle, for that year." The nex': 
year the same, and so on, until, they had given all their money and 
all their cattle, and when all their earthly possessions had gone, they 
finally came and offered themselves to Joseph and to Pharaoh that 
they might be saved alive; and (because they did give all of their 
possessions, their lands and actually themselves, they sacrificed all 
that they had in order to he saved, through the blessings of the 
Almighty, through the ministry and mission of one of his chosen 
servants who was led away into a strange land and in a peculiar man- 
ner. 

"Then Joseph said unto the people, Behold, I have bought you this day 
and your land, for Pharaoh; lo, here is seed for you, and you shall sow the 
land. And it shall come to pass, in the increase that ye shall give the 
fifth part unto Pharaoh; and four parts shall be your own for seed of the 
field, and for your food,, and for them of your households, and for food for 
your little ones. * * *" 

The thought is this, brethren and sisters, after they were saved 
alive, that was not sufficient. The Lord in his mercy provided for them 
t6 continue to live, to continue to live through working the lands 
which they had sacrificed for their living, and for their very existence, 
literally for their salvation. They were to continue to labor in the 
land and to have their actual salvation in that land, but they were 
to honor the rulers and the leaders of the land through giving them 
one-fifth of their increase. We are not asked to give quite that much. 



ELDER HYRUM G. SMITH 95 



I would like to refer you now to the more modern scripture 
upon this very subject. A descendant of this Joseph who was carried 
away from his brothers through his mission and ministry by the 
blessings of the Almighty did bring about literal salvation, not only 
to his own family but to all of the people of the land who rendered 
their service unto him. Reading from the third chapter of Second 
Nephi, concerning a descendant of this Joseph, of whom I have 
spoken: "And thus prophesied Joseph: "Behold, that seer will the 
Lord bless ; and they that seek to destroy him shall be confounded 
for this promise, which I have obtained from the Lord, of the fruit 
of my loins, shall be fulfilled. Behold I am sure of the fulfilling of 
this promise; 

"And his name shall be called after me; and it shall be after the 
name of his father. And he shall be like unto me : for the thing which 
the Lord shall bring forth by his hand, but the power of the Lord 
shall bring my people unto salvation." 

I testify to you, my brethren and sisters, that the work which 
was entrusted into the hands of Joseph the Prophet, in these the last 
days, is to be a literal type. In other words, it is the actual restora- 
tion of this great plan of redemption which will not only save the 
house of Joseph, not only to save you and mie who are here, represent- 
tatives of that great family in Israel through our lineage and our 
obedience, but, it will save all who come in from the lands surround- 
ing us, from the nations of the world, who render obedience unto the 
laws that govern it. Its fulfilment will be literal in these the last 
days. I testify to you, my brethren and sisters, that we are enjoying 
today the blessings of plenty, the blessings of the productions of the 
land; and as a servant of the Lord, I give thanks to our Father 
for those glorious blessings. I praise and thank him for the glorious 
plan of redemption, and trust that we shall return unto him that 
portion of our increase which he requires at our hands, and continue 
to live and enjoy the blessings of this land of Joseph; and in these 
the last days be instruments in the hands of God to bring about this 
literal salvation to the souls of men, that we may not only enjoy the 
blessings of our home and our lands, but that we may enjoy those 
unto ■ his chosen children, that we may live, unitedly together, shar- 
ing our blessings, and our privileges and returning unto God the faith 
and works which he requires at our hands, that we may continue to 
live. In so doing we will not only honor ourselves and receive our 
blessings as they have been promised, according to the records, as 
jthey were promised to that Joseph who was sold by his brothers, 
and to our Prophet Joseph Smith who was raised up of the Lord in 
these the last days, but we shall enjoy the blessings as they have 
been multiplied unto us in these the last days, to (bring about that 
wonderful and glorious salvation of the souls of all men. We sang 
yesterday that song about Joseph who gave his life as a martyr, for 



96 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



his testimony concerning the work which the Lord entrusted into 
his hands. I should like to read again the last verse of that song: 

Sacrifice brings forth the blessings of heaven. 

Earth must atone for the blood of that man. 
Wake up the world for the conflict of justice. 

Millions shall know brother Joseph again. 

Hail to the prophet- — and so forth. 

His life and ministry were an actual type in fulfilment of that 
type which was given to Joseph who was sold into Egypt, to bring 
about the great plan of redemption, that we may all, after we have 
made our sacrifices, through giving into the Lord that portion which 
he requires, — in service, and the fruits of our labors, — continue to 
live and enjoy the blessings of heaven and earth,, which blessings I 
pray for, for us all, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD 

One of the great responsibilities which rests upon the priesthood 
of this church is to carry the message of the gospel to the nations of 
the earth.. Considerable emphasis has already been placed upon the 
subject by the President, in his opening remarks, and by other brethren. 
Since my heart is in this work, I desire to bear testimony of the great 
value of the missionary labor, the blessings and benefits derived there- 
from and the absolute need of its being carried forward in the world 
today. 

IMPORTANCE OF MISSIONARY WORK. 

Since some of the brethren, who are in charge of the missions, 
feel that Latter-day Saints need to be stirred up with a renewed de- 
termination, not only to send the missionaries into the field, but to 
maintain them while they are there, I wish to endorse their plea. I feel 
impressed, my brethren and sisters, that the days are numbered when 
we may be permitted to send our missionaries unto the Gentile nations 
of the earth. The Lord has indicated in the revelations to the Prophet 
Joseph Smith, that there was to be a dispensation of the preaching 
of the gospel to the Gentiles and that the day will come when their 
period, the times of the Gentiles, shall close. Since we have dis- 
covered, by the reports of the missionaries that there has been a 
marked increase this present year in baptisms, it surely should be 
an incentive, on the part of Latter-day Saints, to send the laborers, 
while the day lasts, into the vineyard where truly the harvest still 
appears to be great and the laborers are few. I hope and pray, there- 
fore, that we shall not fail, and I know we shall not, in discharging the 
duty which devolves upon us toward the nations of the earth in this 
respect. For this gospel was not delivered to the Latter-day Saints 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD.

for us alone; it was sacredly entrusted into our hands for ourselves 
and to preserve it for the whole world. There never has been a 
time, since the missionaries began to preach this gospel, when we have 
forgotten this obligation. Always there have been men worthy and 
willing to go. We have seen days that were more trying than these, 
and still there were missionaries provided. We have seen days when 
there were many things to lure this people away from missionary 
work, but still the hearts of our people have not been turned from the 
great labor which God has given to this Church, of carrying this 
gospel to the nations of the earth. There were days when the gold 
fever swept the whole country, and our people were nearest to the 
point of interest, still they were not deterred from this great respon- 
sibility by the allurements of gold. Our missonaries met those gold 
seekers as they pushed their handcarts across the plains, to 1 carry the 
message of the gospel to the children of men. Surely we have acted 
as if we believed what we said, namely, that these are the last days, 
the days of God's judgments, that they now hang over the nations of 
the earth, and we alone know the means of escape. Men of Israel, we 
have been sent to inform all men to flee from the wrath that is to 
come and to find salvation in this world as well as salvation in the 
world to come. 

THE SAINTS HAVE ALWAYS PROVED TRUE TO MISSIONARY OBLIGATIONS. 

While this has not been altogether a pleasant message to deliver, 
nevertheless, our brethren have been true, and by thousands have de- 
livered it faithfully and acceptably to the Lord. Using President 
Ivins' illustration, we have acted as if we realized the seriousness of 
the situation. For if there is a possibility of the head-gates coming 
out and the floods coming in on the people; if there is a possibility 
that the dam above the valley might break and the people in the 
valley be engulfed in the on-rushing water, what would we do? If 
we knew the danger, or if we saw this peril to men, from afar, or 
ether calamities that might come upon them and we knew about it, 
would we peacefully find a place of security ourselves and watch 
while their calamity came? No, we would exert ourselves to warn 
men to flee from the danger. And this is the spirit that has actuated 
those warnings that have been uttered by the brethren who have 
spoken at this conference ; this is the spirit that accompanies our mis- 
sionaries who go into the world and cry repentance to this generation, 
warning them to flee from the wrath that is to come. But, since they 
do not see it, we who see and know it, with all the earnestness of our 
souls, we must proclaim repentance unto this generation. Some have 
repented, but the majority have not. 

DISPENSATION OF PREACHING TO THE GENTILES DRAWING TO A CLOSE. 

Thank the Lord that the day of their repentance is yet extended, 
but it shall not be extended forever, because we are drawing to the 



98 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



close of that dispensation when the gospel shall be preached to the 
Gentile nations, and the wheat is being gathered. Thank, the Lord 
there is still some wheat, and as long as the days last, my brethren, 
we are to thrust in our sickles and reap, and send forth men to dis- 
charge this great duty and responsibility; for, when the day cometh 
that the calamities that are spoken of shall be poured out upon the 
nations of the earth, let us have no regret that we failed to dis- 
charge our duty. Do we rejoice at the prospects of chastisements that 
shall be ministered to men who do not repent? No, we do not. In my 
heart I know — and I speak for you, my brethren — we do not feel just 
exactly as Jonah did, who when he prophesied of judgments upon 
the people, if they did not repent, and when the judgments of the Lord 
were averted, through the repentance of men, he felt bad because his 
prophecies had not been fulfilled. No, I would rejoice with all my 
soul if these things that await the nations of the earth could only be 
averted. I would be happy ; for do we not love the souls of the child- 
ren of men? I have spent thirteen years of my life in missionary ser- 
vices and all of you who have spent years of your life out there in 
the service of our fellow men — walking in the rain, or in sunshine, 
in the mud and in the cold, 'because we love their souls — which we 
could not have done without begetting love for them. And if it were 
in our power to change the conditions we would do* it ; but we cannot ; 
even God himself cannot change the conditions that will result, except 
men repent. If they repent, then they shall escape ; but if they repent 
not, then they shall taste of these things that are coming. 

LET US ROUND UP OUR SHOULDERS TO OUR DUTY, WHILE THE DAY LASTS. 

In the meantime, while the day lasts, let us round up our shoulders 
and discharge that duty, out of love for those who are yet in dark- 
ness and yet in the world without the knowledge of this truth ; that 
they may come to Zion and rejoice with us, and that we may have 
our garments clear of the blood of this generation, and that our, 
heavenly Father may be justified in that which he shall cause to come 
upon the unrepentant and the wicked. 

Now, my brethren and sisters, I feel sure that after the appeals 
that have been made, we will gather our strength and send it forth 
to continue to discharge this great responsibility; and those who 
do not have sons in the field will lend a helping hand to those who 
do, that the boys who have not means shall not be under the neces- 
sity of coming home, but that the bishops, as suggested, shall call 
for help and support and strength at home. There is no greater 
work devolving upon the Church than the preaching of the gospel 
while these precious days last. Let us not falter nor hesitate, but go 
forward and be justified. 

OUR DUTY TO THE GATHERED SAINTS. 

The other great responsibility that rests upon the priesthood 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD. 



99 



of this Church, and all the members of the Church, is that we shall 
sanctify ourselves and our sons and daughters, and preserve that 
which the Lord has given us ; so that we may establish here a people 
who shall be an ensign and a pattern, an example to the world, as 
well as to prepare the people for the coming of the Redeemer to live 
among men in the flesh. 

I wish to> read a few words from the 105th section of the Doc- 
trine and Covenants : 

Verily I say unto you who have assembled yourselves together that 
you may learn my will concerning the redemption of mine afflicted people. 

Behold, I say unto you, were it not for the transgressions of my peo- 
ple, speaking concerning the Church and not individuals, they might have 
been redeemed even now; 

But behold, they have not learned to be obedient to the things which 
I required at their hands, but are full of all manner of evil,, and do not im- 
part of their substance, as becometh Saints, to the poor and afflicted 
among them, 

And are not united according to the union required by the law of the 
celestial kingdom; 

And Zion cannot be built up unless it is by the principles of the law 
of the celestial kingdom, otherwise I cannot receive her unto myself; and 
my people must needs be chastened until they learn obedience, tif it must 
needs be, by the things which they suffer. 

THE GOSPEL THE KEY TO SOLVE THE WORLD'S VEXING PROBLEMS. 

Now, my brethren and sisters, I rejoice that, notwithstanding 
we are in the midst of these chastisements — not because, perhaps, of 
any deliberate wickedness on the part of the people but because many 
of us have heard the warning voice of the shepherd of Israel, but 
have not heeded that warning voice, I want to say to you that there 
is no plan devised for the solution of these vexing problems that are 
now before us and before the world; there is no plan devised that 
shall succeed, except the plan that our God has given to this people. 
In the restoration of the everlasting gospel there was given and com- 
mitted to man in this dispensation every means, key, principle and 
power to solve each and every vexing problem that now distresses 
the world. We have been given those principles, and, thank the 
Lord! we are making some progress toward their solution. I rejoice, 
notwithstanding we are occasionally in need of chastisement, that we 
are not going to fail. I know that. You will read that in the days 
of Daniel, he, looking down through all the ages following his own 
day, saw the rise of the kingdoms of the world and their dissolution, 
until he saw, in these the last days, the kingdom of God being estab- 
lished, as a stone cut out of the mountain without hands. 

GOD'S WORK WILL NOT FAIL, NOR/ BE GIVEN TO ANOTHER PEOPLE. 

In connection with the rise of that great work of our Father in- 
the last days, he declared a new thing, a thing that never was declared 
to any other dispensation fromi the days of Father Adam, namely, 
that the work of God in that day should not fail; it should not be 



100 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



overcome; neither shall it be left to another people. Two wonderful 
promises. I recognize that in the dispensations that have preceded 
our own, men have hoped and dreamed that there would be established 
in might and power, the work of God but in sorrow they had to see 
the power of evil triumph in the world. But that shall never be re- 
peated again, for this work has been established to roll forth, and it 
shall not fail. You may fail; I may fail, but this shall not fail. I 
rejoice to know that, while some of us may falter and hesitate, this 
people shall not be rejected. The Lord said to Daniel that the work 
should not go to another people; and the Lord has indicated that in 
a revelation given to the Prophet Joseph Smith. You find it in the 
closing two verses of the ninetieth section of the Book of Doctrine and 
Covenants : 

ZION SHALL NOT BE MOVED OUT OF HER PLACE. 

But verily I say unto you, that I, the Lord, will contend with Zion, 
and plead with her strong ones, and chasten her until she overcomes and 
is clean before me; 

For she shall not he removed out of her place; 1, the Lord, have 
spoken it. 

That kind of a promise entails the necessity of chastisement, 
when we need to be chastened and corrected and brought to a con- 
dition of repentance. I recognize that the Lord cannot fulfil his 
work nor accomplish his purposes without our willing obedience. He 
will not use this people unless we are willing to be used ; but he has 
means of correcting, he has means of chastisement, which he will 
apply from time to time, and the only thing that impedes our pro- 
gress today is our own lack of willingness to follow the counsel 
of those whom God has appointed to lead this people, because of the 
imagination of our hearts that we are wiser than they are. 

AN APPEAL TO FOLLOW THE COUNSEL OF OUR LEADERS. 

I want to make an appeal to the brethren and sisters of the 
Church and to the priesthood of the Church who lead in the wards 
and stakes of Zion, that w;e shall rally to those whom God has ap- 
pointed to lead this people. What brings success? Doing the right 
thing at the right time. What will relieve this people of their pres- 
ent difficulties? Following the counsel of those men who have been 
appointed, in the wards and the stakes of Zion, to lead this people, 
not only in spiritual matters, but in material things as well. We do 
not wish that these brethren shall be appointed dictators or directors, 
but they are there for counsel and advice. I know that there are 
brethren who think that they know more than the bishop of the 
ward, and they would not go to him to counsel with him concern- 
ing their material things ; nor would they go to the president of the 
stake or even to the president of the Church. But I want to tell you 
there is a wisdom and an inspiration resting with these men, who 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD. 



101 



have been called to be leaders of the people, that is greater than the 
wisdom of men who may think they know very much more, but who, 
nevertheless, will discover that these are the days when the wisdom 
of the wise shall perish and the understanding of the prudent be hid. 
The light, the wisdom and the revelations of the Lord come to his 
humble servants to counsel and advise this people, and it will lead 
them to victory, as it has done in the past — to success in material 
things as well as in spiritual things, 

ASK THE LORD FOR COUNSEL. 

I ask my brethren and sisters to be more diligent with refer- 
ence to seeking for proper guidance and direction in material things. 
When you do not know what to do, study it out in your mind. You 
get the key in the ninth section of the book of Doctrine and Coven- 
ants, which is applicable to these circumstances, and also to the af- 
fairs of life with which we are concerned. Go and study it out, and 
when you reach your conclusion, if you are not clear in your mind 
as to the thing you want to do, go and ask the Lord before you do it, 
as to whether it is right. If it is right, he will cause your bosom 
to burn within you, and you will know whether it is right. If you 
do not have that feeling, but only a stupor of thought, and there is 
uncertainty about it, turn away from; that thing. Re sure you are 
right and then go ahead ; and we can't be sure we are right until we 
receive the witness from the Lord, that it is the proper thing to do. 
I bear testimony to you that the Lord is concerned in the material 
prosperity of this people. 

THE BASIS OF MATERIAL BLESSINGS. 

God will never give this people that which will turn them from 
him. Whenever he sees that in our increase in the things of this 
world there is danger that our hearts will be turned away, he knows 
how to shrink that prosperity and bring us just where he wants us. 
He will continue to do that until we are willing to be led ; and when 
the people are willing to follow those whom God has appointed to 
lead them, and they will serve him, pay their honest tithing, and keep 
his commandments, I will tell you there are blessings of a material 
character beyond anything we have ever conceived of, that the Lord 
could give this people immediately if he desired. O, I have faith in 
him. There will come tight times, yes, and days of peril. I think 
it is a blessing that the granaries and the barns are full. Do not 
complain about it. Brethren, do not be disturbed over it. It may be 
possible that even in this the Lord has a plan and a purpose, for, O, 
how much worse our condition Would be if our banks were full of 
money and our barns were empty and our granaries were vacant. 
There are coming days of trial. There are coming days of famine, 
and the world shall feel the pang of hunger beyond that which they 
feel today ; but even today, there are millions in Russia and in China, 



102 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



notwithstanding the world is full of abundance, who are suffering 
the pangs of hunger. There is coming a day when the crops shall 
be destroyed by a hail storm; and how easy to 1 deluge the whole 
world in famine! Let this people keep a surplus of their foodstuffs, 
both for man and beasts, and it will be profitable to them. One good 
season may liquidate our material obligations, if we will be wise 
and prudent, and listen to the counsel of the brethren. Let us be 
economical and save, and pay our tithes. In this time when we are 
tempted to take everything we have to meet our other obligations, 
let us not forget the obligations which we owe to the Lord, if we 
want to be vindicated. I will tell you, as the Lord God lives, if this 
people will turn to the Lord and serve him, cease our extravagance, 
pay our tithes, and humble, ourselves, we will see deliverance, and we 
will not come into bondage nor into difficulties ; and there is no other 
way out of it that I know anything about. I rejoice to know that 
we have men who can stand as watchmen upon the towers of Zior. 
and call our attention to these things. 

THE DANGER OF IMMORALITY. 

In conclusion let me make an appeal to you concerning another 
thing. Not only is there sweeping over the world distress of a finan- 
cial character, waves that are deluging people in distress, in debt 
and in obligations, but there is another thing that is more serious. 
I would that this was the only thing that was afflicting 
us and the only thing that is imminent in the world. Far 
more precious to us than our houses and our lands and our fields 
are our sons and daughters, and the evil one has con- 
spired to capture them. He is not so much concerned about get- 
ting our farms and fields, but O, more precious than all these things 
are our sons and daughters ! Sweeping over the world are waves 
of immorality, for the standards of the world have broken down, an-fl 
these dangers are all about us. Shall we stand when this tide comes 
upon us? I believe we shall; and yet, as a watchman upon the towers 
of Zion, I call you, my brethren, to watch, to work, to pray, and to 
guard the flocks over whom God hath made you overseers, that 
the insidious influence of evil, if it comes in to seek to corrupt the 
morals of this people, shall not have power to succeed, but that we 
shall live up to the standards under which I was raised, and you were 
raised, that we shall teach our sons and daughters that next to murder 
itself, is the. crime of sexual impurity. We have that standard. We 
expect the boy to be just as clean and as pure as the girl whom he 
marries, to be his wife and the mother of his children. We have 
been preserved and protected up to this time by living up to these 
standards. Let us not lessen the requirements, not a bit; but em- 
phasize them, and fortify our boys and girls against that _ which is 
conspiring against them. If they shall succeed in preserving them- 
selves, during these perilous times, and come out clean and uncon-

taminated, I will tell you that their praise will be sung; yes, by more 
people and in louder acclaim than the praises of our fathers who sub- 
dued the desert and made it blossom as the rose. Good is coming to 
Zion. While she has her days of chastisement, repentance will come ; 
we will not be forsaken by the Lord, if we will not forsake him, 
and may God grant that we shall not. Let us all go home resolved 
more nearly to serve him and keep his commandments, and then, 
I will promise you, all shall be well with Zion and her people, which 
may God grant, in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

ELDER RICHARD R. LYMAN 

I desire that during the few minutes I stand before you, the 
words I speak may be prompted by the inspiration of our heavenly 
Father. 

TWO TYPES OF GREAT SPEAKERS. 

There have been two types of great speakers ; shall I say two 
types of great orators? One type reached its highest form in Cicero. 
The other type reached its perfection in Demosthenes. It is said 
that when Cicero stood before the people they all listened with great 
interest, and as they w.ere leaving the assembly they said to one 
another: "How well Cicero speaks." They had praise for his voice, 
praise for his words, praise for his rhetoric, praise for his eloquence. 

But when the multitudes listened to that master speaker, De- 
mosthenes, they never thought of his language, his rhetoric, or his 
words, but rushed from the building exclaiming: "Come, let us go up 
against Philip!" 

PRESIDENT GRANT'S WORDS URGE US TO ACTION. 

In the remarks of President Heber J. Grant, we heard words 
like the words of Demosthenes. This good shepherd told us to get 
out of debt and remain out of debt. As soon as possible I propose 
to get out of debt. 

ON THE WORD OF WISDOM. 

He asked us also to remember the Word of Wisdom. President 
Grant has himself been a model in the matter of keeping the Word 
of Wisdom. I doubt if any other man has appealed to the people 
more earnestly or effectively to induce them to live in accordance with 
these inspired health teachings than he has. 

It has been variously estimated that ten per cent or twenty per 
cent, or forty per cent of the people in the Church use tea and coffee. 
1 propose that when we leave this conference we do so accepting the 
message of the prophet of God, that is, that we leave the building 
determined to live in strict accordance with the Word of Wisdom. 



104 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



ON HOME INDUSTRY. 

The President, the man whom we sustain as our Prophet, also 
appealed to us yesterday to support home industry. I propose not 
to talk about his eloquence, but to leave the building determined to 
reform in this respect. Will you do the same thing? 

I wish I could say, as he did, that he was standing in shoes 
made at Z. C. M. I., and that he has wtorn Z. C. M. I. made shoes 
for thirty years. I have made a resolution that at the next confer- 
ence I will stand, on one condition, in Z. C. M. I. shoes — Will you 
do the same thing? That condition is that they can find a piece of 
leather big enough to make them. (Laughter.) 

The President said that while the Knight Woolen Mills of Provo 
were manufacturing cloth for making clothing, he wore home-made 
goods. He did not say here what he said to me before the meeting, 
namely: "It was my intention to have a suit of clothes made from 
cloth from the Knight Woolen Mills before this conference, but I 
have been away from the city and from the State so much of late 
that I did not get it done." 

When in Provo the other day I went to the Woolen Mills and 
purchased an overcoat, made of Utah wool by Utah workmen, and 
it is the best bargain in every sense I ever had in an overcoat. The 
reason I am not wearing it is because the weather, or this building 
is so hot. I promise to leave here with a resolution to the effect that 
if Brother Golden Kimball will sign a note with me, to get the money, 
I shall have a suit made of goods from the Knight Woolen Mills be- 
fore the next General Conference. 

Long years ago when the people of America were about to de- 
clare their independence and that great American, Benjamin Frank- 
lin, was before the House of Lords being examined, he was asked 
the question: "But how can you live in America without the pro- 
ducts of England?" 

Benjamin Franklin replied about as follows : "The goods that 
we receive from England may be divided into three classes : First, 
the necessities ; next, the mere conveniences ; and third, the luxuries." 
You have all seen that picture I am sure, of a sheep with a little 
wagon behind carrying its great big tail. That was devised as a re- 
sult of the remarks of Benjamin Franklin. 

He said : "In America the people are loyal, they have quit eat- 
ing lamb, so they will have more wool, and it is only a question of a 
little time until we can produce all of the necessities. It will be but 
a little longer when we can also produce the mere conveniences ; and 
the luxuries," he said, "because of the patriotism of our people, are 
cut off already." 

So I appeal to you Americans to listen to the voice of the man 
who stands at the head of the Church, and support home industry. 

I was at the Fair yesterday. It was gratifying to see there the 



ELDER RICHARD R. LYMAN.

products of the institutions and organizations of our own State. I 
propose to listen to the words of the man who stands at the head of 
the Church, and leave this conference saying: "Come, let us go forth 
and use first the products of our own State." 

RELIGIOUS AND INDUSTRIAL TRAINING OF CHILDREN. 

.' But that is not what I want to talk about. In the 32nd chapter 
of Proverbs, and the 6th verse, appear these words: 

"Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old 
he will not depart from it." The 29th and last verse in that same 
22nd chapter says : 

"Seest thou a man diligent in his business? He shall stand be- 
fore kings, he shall not stand before mean men." 

So I desire to urge the proper training of our children, the bring- 
ing up of the child in the way he should go. I urge faithful devotion 
to business. I ask you this question. If you have a son, in how 
many ways is he trained to make a living? I have the reputation, 
especially among the engineering students of the University of Utah, 
of helping them to find employment. I have helped a good many 
others, and I have been surprised when some young men have come 
to ask for employment to find before me a human being with un- 
trained hands, and untrained eyes, and untrained ears, and an un- 
trained mind. Honor be to the man who took his boy to an expert 
workman and said: "I want my boy to learn to work. I would 
like to have you give him some employment." 

"I don't have very much business," replied the man, "I have no 
work for him to do. If I had the work, I haven't the means with 
which to pay for his services." 

"Well," said the father, not in the presence of the boy, however, 
"I will let the boy board at home. You go to him, tell him you will 
pay him for his services $15 a month, and each month I will give 
you a check for $15." 

Honor to the man who teaches his boy to work, and is more 
concerned in having him learn to do things than in securing financial 
compensation. 

Honor also to the man who' took nis boy to a ranchman, a man 
who was a financial success, who had flocks and herds and fields, 
fields of grain and fields of hay, and said: "I would like to have 
you take my boy and train him to do things. I am not concerned 
whether you pay him anything or not, but I want you to teach him 
to work." 

I had a little pamphlet put in my hands the other day, and in it 
is a story something like this: ("It is up to You," by Parlette.) 
A newspaper man in a paper mill was watching the operations of a 
machine with interest, when along came a man with an oil can, squirt- 
ing oil into the squirt holes in the side of the machine. He asked 
that man a few questions that he answered fairly well. Then he 



106 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



asked something about the process going on in the next room, and 
the man replied : "J don't know nothing about it, boss, I haven't 
worked there." So he said he asked him another process and the 
answer came the same : "I don't know nothing about it, boss, I 
haven't worked there." He asked him a question about the pulp 
mill: "I don't know nothing about it, boss, I have never worked 
there." He asked him a question about the office, the number of 
people employed in the plant : "I don't know nothing about it, boss, 
I haven't worked there." And so the newspaper man, to himself, 
said: "Nobody home." 

The newspaper man asked : "I presume, my friend, that you are 
new in this plant?" "No, no," came the reply, "I have been squirt- 
ing oil into this machine now for twelve years." Twelve years and 
"don't know nothing" about any other part of the institution. He 
said: "I took off my hat in the presence of the dead." (Laughter.) 

As he was leaving he asked the foreman: "You see that man 
standing over there with a can in his hand ? Is he a human being, or 
do you just wind him up?" 

A STUPENDOUS PIECE OF WORK BEFORE THE SAINTS. 

The appeal I make to you is for the training of the hands, the 
training of the eyes, the training of the ears, the training of the 
minds of the young people in the Church. We have before us to be 
done the most stupendous piece of work that has heen given to any 
people, that is the preaching of the gospel of Jesus Christ to every 
nation, kindred, tongue and people. This cannot be done by our 
boys alone. It will take men, strong men, men of training, men 
of experience, men of education, men of brains. The Church can have 
in it a great army of such strong characters only by training our 
children in the way they should go. The Lord bless us all, Amen. 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

When the British General with his army entered the City of 
Jerusalem I felt that the time of the Gentiles was very close to being 
fulfilled. At my request the choir will sing a song written by a con-

By special request the choir sang, "Come, thou glorious day 
of promise," by Neibaur. 

Come, thou glorious day of promise, 

Come and spread thy cheerful ray, 
When the scattered sheep of Israel 

Shall no longer go astray; 
When hosannas, 

With united voice they'll cry.

Lord, how long wilt Thou be angry; 

Shall Thy wrath forever burn? 
Rise,, redeem Thine ancient people, 

Their transgressions from them turn. 
King of Israel, 

Come and set Thy people free. 

O, that soon Thou wouldst to Jacob, 

Thy enlivening Spirit send! 
Of their unbelief and mis'ry 

Make, O Lord, a speedy end. 
Lord, Messiah! 

Prince of Peace o'er Israel reign. 

Announcement was made that Elder Ernest W. Wood, and 
President Lewis W. Shurtliff, of Weber stake, were ill, and desired 
to be remembered by the congregation of Saints, and they were 
prayed for by President Daniel Heiner, who offered the closing 
prayer. 

The meeting was adjourned until 2 o'clock p. m. 



FIRST OVERFLOW MEETING 

An overflow meeting of the Conference was held in the 
Assembly Hall at 10 o'clock, Sunday morning, October 9, 1921. 
Elder John A. Widstoe of the Council of the Twelve presided. The 
music exercises were furnished by the Cottonwood ward choir, 
Cottonwood stake. 

The choir and congregation sang, "For the strength of the 
hills, we bless thee." 

Prayer was offered by Elder E. S. Rolapp. 

The choir sang the anthem, "ROuse, O ye mortals." 

ELDER JOHN A. WIDTSOE 

My brethren and sisters, we may not be in the great taber- 
nacle, a few rods away, in which is a great congregation of five 
or six thousand people; but we are here in this smaller building for 
the same purpose as are those in the larger building, and we are 
entitled to the same Spirit and should enjoy the same blessings. 
I am sure we shall have a splendid meeting here this morning. Pres- 
ident Grant has sent us some faithful brethren to speak to us, and 
I know that we shall have the Spirit of God to bless and to comfort 
us during this hour. 

A TESTIMONY FULL OF JOY. 

I bear my testimony to you that I am happy to belong to this 
great people, chosen in the last days for the carrying on of the 
purposes of the Almighty. I delight to bear my testimony that 
I know that this is the work of God, that Joseph Smith was a prophet 
divinely ordained and set apart to carry out the great latter- 



108 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



day work that was planned before the foundations of the earth were 
laid. I know that in the light of the gospel, man may walk in 
happiness and in enjoyment throughout this life's journey, and 
ultimately, when we shall pass through the great veil, we may 
enjoy exaltation and eternal life throughout the endless ages. This 
testimony fills my heart with joy; and when, on a morning like 
this, I find these two great halls crowded to their capacities, and 
yet see beyond me a great concourse of people who are probably 
assembling in another overflow meeting, I praise God that he is 
blessing us so abundantly. 

Who would have thought, in 1830, when a handful of people 
assembled to organize this Church, that in ninety years these 
thousands of people would assemble in these valleys, then un- 
known to the civilized world, twice a year, in devotion and fidel- 
ity to God. My experiences on this land and in other countries 
have demonstrated to me that a sight like this is not to be wit- 
nessed anywhere else on the face of the earth. Ten thousand people 
at least, I imagine, are on this square today, with the common 
purpose of worshiping their God, of testifying to the things that 
I have been testifying to you here this morning. And, probably 
anyone of these ten thousand could stand on this platform, as I 
do now, and bear his living testimony that this is the work of God. 

Some years ago a mother with her children was standing 
near the statues' of Joseph and Hyrum Smith on this block. They 
were looking at the conference crowds. One of the children, a 
girl pretty well grown into young womanhood, felt the spirit 
that we feel on this occasion, and she said to her mother: "Mother, 
mother, mother! If I know nothing else in this world, I know that 
I am a Latter-day Saint. I want to live with this people. I want 
to die with this people; I am*of this people." That is how we 
all feel; we are leaving the world and we praise the Lord for it. 

Not only in numbers have we become a "marvelous work 
and a wonder" in a little less than one hundred years ; but in a 
greater and a larger sense have we become a marvelous people, 
for we have impressed our thought upon the whole world. The 
world does not believe today as it did ninety years ago. A few 
days ago I picked up a recent number of a great magazine, and 
my feelings were roused within me and my testimony increased, 
when I found one of the writers declaring to the readers of the 
magazine that "God cannot look upon sin with the least degree 
of tolerance," borrowed almost word for word, from section one 
of the Doctrine and Covenants. In such a way have the doctrines 
taught by the despised Latter-day Saints been appropriated by 
the nations of the earth ; and whether the people of the earth ac- 
cept the inspiration of Joseph Smith, nevertheless, in fact, the whole 
current of human thought has been changed by the doctrines of 
this people. That is perhaps the greatest achievement of "Mor- 
monism" during the last ninety years, unless it be the achievement 



ELDER JOHN A. WIDTSOE.

to secure a body of people numbering hundreds of thousands who 
almost always see eye to eye, who understand as with one mind, 
who feel as with one heart, who worship God alike, and who in 
that united worship and action find a tremendous advantage in 
life. Do you know of a happier people than we are? I have not 
found a happier people. I find happiness wherever I go, for Lat- 
ter-day Saints understand the truth. They have seen the begin- 
ning and they know the end of the designs of God with respect 
to his children. They do not grope in darkness. Who cares if 
we are few in comparison with the 1500 millions of people on the 
face of the earth? We are as yeast in the dough, and will yet 
ferment the whole earth. 

A few weeks ago I was in Canada, where I spent some time 
with people not of our faith. One afternoon we had a social af- 
fair, which ended in an automobile trip over some interesting 
places in that neighborhood. By my side sat an old gentleman, 
who was the man who drove the first railway train over the 
Canadian Pacific railroad into Vancouver. He told the story of 
that railroad ; how a group of men saw a vision of the possibili- 
ties of building a railroad over the Canadian mountains, and how, 
with little influence, money and power, they formulated a plan 
to build from ocean to ocean a great continental railroad which 
would open up to humanity the great Canadian dominion. This 
man said : "I am ashamed to tell you how often I ran trains into 
Vancouver without a single passenger on them, during the first 
few years of the history of that railroad," and he said, "when we 
got a crowd of four or five people I thought the railway was com- 
ing into its own. One day we had 7 passengers, and we were all 
jubilant until we discovered that six of them were employees of 
the railway and traveled on passes." That was about a genera-' 
tion ago. Today, as I found, one almost has to plead for a seat on 
the trains that run every day over that same railroad. Who cares 
about the hard beginning and the empty trains when the end can 
be seen from the beginning? The makers of the Canadian Pacific 
railway saw the building of homes and schools and happy families, 
the growing of a civilization in that part of the world, so what 
did they care about the difficulties and modesty of the beginning? 

MARVEL OF THE SETTLEMENTS IN UTAH. 

You also, my brethren and sisters, saw the end from the 
beginning. If we know the message of the Prophet, what do 
we care about the hardships or the modesty of our beginning 
or of the difficulties of today? I know that the germs of per- 
manent greatness lie in this great work; and I am content and 
glad and grateful to have been born into the world in this age, 
tc do my work; even if some one after me must have the joy 
of realizing even more completely the vision of the past. 

Who thought when we came to the mountains in 1847 that.

we could build here an empire? E'ven Brigham Young, led by 
the Spirit of God, having visions by night and by day, of the 
future of his people, did not fully comprehend the destiny of 
this people when established in this once arid valley. But is 
it not wonderful that these great leaders did believe and trust 
in God as they did? The story is told that Brigham Young was 
met by the trapper Jim Bridger, who came to the Great Basin 
about 1824 and lived here for a quarter of a century; and that 
he said to Brigham Young, "I have spent a quarter of a century 
in the Great Basin, and I can't see any possibility of building 
a state on these barren wastes. I doubt if grain can be raised in 
the Salt Lake valley." But Brigham Young, taught by Almighty 
God, said, "You who have spent your life in these valleys may 
come to me with these conclusions ; but I know that within this 
great American desert we may yet build homes and enjoy prot 
perity and happiness, and fulfil the destiny that God has prom- 
ised his people." That is the difference between the inspiration 
of God and the judgment of men! 

ALL LIFE WAITS ON US. 

We are a small people in the eyes of the world ; but we have 
an understanding of the purposes of God, and the gift of the 
priesthood and the authority to act for God in the accomplish- 
ment of his will. The living and the dead are depending upon 
us , for the truth and the power of salvation. The living must hear 
our message; and the dead are waiting for us to open the doors 
through which they may go on to a greater life in the great 
hereafter. All life waits upon us and our actions for the ful- 
filment of the prophecies of holy men and the promises of God. 
I feel tremendously the responsibility that rests upon me as a 
member of this Church, having all this knowledge, having all 
this authority, having all these things placed before me to do. God 
grant that I may do all that God desires me to do, that I may not fail 
on account of any hesitancy on my part. 

I pray that God may give us a full conception of the mean- 
ing of this great Latter-day work, and give us strength from day 
to day to enter into partnership with him to accomplish the 
great work that he insists shall be done for the human race in this 
great stage of our existence, I ask in the name of the Lord Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 

ELDER ARNOLD G. MILLER 

ale President of the Australian Mission.) 

My brethren and sisters, I feel the responsibility that rests upon 
me at this time, and my heart is fluttering, perhaps, as is general 
when I have been called upon to face a congregation. 



ELDER ARNOLD G. MILLER. 



Ill 



I have recently returned from the Australian Mission, about 
seven months ago. I want to say of the Australian people that 
they are not in general a religious people. They are hospitable and 
among them many intelligent people. Among those who have been con- 
verted to the faith we can find as fine people, perhaps, as any that 
may be found. Among the elders who labored with me, there could be 
no finer young people anywhere than those young men were. Remem- 
ber we were laboring under very difficult circumstances at the time. 
The world's war was one, when it was impossible to get elders 
from Zion to fill our ranks where they were depleted as our elders 
were sent home. They left us with very few to carry on the work in 
that far-off land. 

Perhaps the idea prevails among the Latter-day Saints that the 
people of Australia were against the "Mormon" people; in other 
words, that they had formulated laws against them. But this is not 
the case. I wish to defend that people. There was ai rule passed by the 
British counsel, at the time they were engaged in that great struggle, 
that there should be no foreigners sent into the colonies during the 
prevalence of war. I was under the impression that the people there 
were compelling our people to keep away from that land. But as 
I put it up to the American consul there, he gave me to understand 
differently. I got a letter to the Secretary for the Colonies there, 
at Melbourne, and when I went to him and asked him why they were 
discriminating against the American citizens, he said they were not, 
that there were no laws passed by them against us ; it was simply a 
rule passed for self-protection by the parent government. I saw very 
readily that they were right in doing this, because in the early stages 
of the war people were sent out in the guise of missionaries, and they 
were stirring up revolt among the nations, especially in India, and 
I commended them on the position they took. But that did not al- 
leviate our situation. We finally got an order passed by which the 
British officer at Washington was directed to vise the passports of 
men from this country. And finding that we had lost so many men 
from our ranks, they allowed us to send so many more. And then we 
found that our government had proscribed men, so it left us with very 
few men in that field. We used what local ability we could. Fin- 
ally, when the armistice was signed we received a small company of 
men to relieve the situation, but for a long time we had twelve men 
only in that great country having an area larger than the United 
States, and we did the best we could under those conditions. 

In coming in contact with the Australian parliamentarians, men 
who sat at the head of the government, we had a splendid opportunity 
to preach the gospel of the Son of God. The question would be asked 
by the men to whom we appealed, "What do you teach our people? 
AVhat are your practices? What, is your policy as far as emigration is 
concerned?" All of these things are vital questions to the Australian 
people. They wanted to know what we were teaching, and they got 



3 12 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



an opportunity to learn what we believed as to a personal God. We be- 
lieve in God as a personal being, and in Jesus Christ as another per- 
sonal being. We believe in the Holy Ghost as a personage of spirit, 
these constituting the Godhead. We also believe in the doctrine that 
Jesus came and atoned for the original transgression, of man, and that 
through him and by him all will be resurrected from the grave. We 
believe that as individuals, we will have to, give an account of our ac- 
tions here upon the earth, and that we will pay the penalty for our 
transgressions. But we believe that somewhere, sometime in the great 
beyond, there will be a time when the gospel will be preached to 
all people, whether in this mortal life or behind the veil, when all will 
have an opportunity to hear, and to have a place in the kingdom of 
God. Again, we teach our people that they are to be subject to kings, 
presidents, magistrates, -etc., and obey and sustain the law, and that 
our policy was at that time, knowing the opportunity there for colon- 
ization and for building up of institutions for the betterment of that 
people there. We had a splendid opportunity; we reached the chief 
men in th? c republic to tell them what we believe. We even reached 
Plon. William Hughes, who was at the head there, and I told him 
these things. He listened very attentively. "Well, " he said, "it seems 
to me that we ought not to bar your people, nor bar your elders 
from coming into this land." We told him what we had done for the 
"flu" there. We had this scourge very severely in Melbourne. In 
Sydney it was not quite so bad, where I was. But one of our elders 
who was at Melbourne visited the homes of some sixty people, and 
administered spiritual and temporal comfort, in connection with his 
associates. There was one local elder at one of the hospitals who was 
in a dying condition, and as far as any mortal aid was concerned he 
bad passed by the portals of this earth, so to speak, and was enter- 
ing into the great unknown. The elder procured a permit, and was 
permitted to visit the man and stay with him, which he did day after 
day, until the sick man was finally put on his feet, and today that 
man stands as a living witness of raising the dead in these last days. 

Brethren and sisters, miracles have not ceased. I have seen them 
in numbers of instances where I have labored, where the sick have 
been healed, and the barren have been made fruitful, and many 
other wonderful things done by the power of God. I have seen the 
power of God made manifest in the lives of those who have faith in 
the blessings of the gospel. 

I know that the gospel is true. God burned that into my being 
in my youthful days ; and I know that Joseph Smith is a prophet of 
God. I have said to some men whom I have met: you may look, 
perhaps some of you may sneer at our child-like faith; but I thank 
God for that child-like faith. We cannot help what we believe in, be- 
cause God has revealed it to us by the Spirit of God, the Holy Ghost. 

Once upon a time, when I was talking with one of these men, 
when it was reported that some of our elders had been accused of 



ELDER ARNOLD G. MILLER. 



113 



taking their women out of that country, as they thought, that man 
said to me: "Do you affiliate with other churches?" I said, "Oh, no, 
they will not have us fellows ; we are too tangible ; we preach, per- 
haps, a different doctrine." "But," he said, "Isn't your faith the 
same as preached by the world in general?" I said I did not know 
but it was. I said, there is a difference, though. I picked up a book 
and I said, we open the scriptures and we believe the things that are 
written in the book, and we try to keep our, lives in accordance there- 
with. Your people believe the book when it is closed. You are believ- 
ing the traditions of men. Here, let us take up some of the very 
principles that we believe in. We believe that Jesus Christ came upon 
the earth to atone for the transgression of our first parents, Adam 
and Eve. But let us not put it "transgression," it was a preconceived 
plan. There was something to be gained. But for the action called 
the transgression of our first parents, we would never have been here. 
We would have been ever in the spirit world : but inasmuch as death 
came upon our first parents, and we were all subject to death and 
dissolution, the spirit will have a body; that it became necessary that 
we should be redeemed from the condition of mortality that we were 
placed in, and that through the redemption all men would be res- 
urrected from the dead. I said to those gentlemen: 1 am convinced 
of the work of the Lord. I have been time and time again over the 
whole territory of Australia, including Tasmania ; I have labored 
some in New Zealand, and I have visited also the Samoan, the Sand- 
wich Islands and others as a humble elder of the Church of Christ, 
and going from house to house and from hamlet to hamlet, preaching 
the truth, and I have found very few who believed actually in the 
resurrection of the dead. 

To us in Zion it is a bold statement, but it. is a fact, very few 
people of the world believe in the resurrection of the Lord Jesus 
Christ. Now, I believe that Jesus Christ came, that he fulfilled the 
predictions of the ancient prophets, particularly Isaiah, that he would 
be lifted up and would be slain for the sins of the world. He came 
and fulfilled these predictions, and as a result, all mankind will have 
the benefit of that great gift that he bestowed upon us. 

But aside from that, the time and place of resurrection, which 
will come to every son and daughter of man, will be according to our 
fitness. The Apostle Paul said that every man would be resurrected 
in his own order, Jesus Christ being the first fruits of the resurrec- 
tion. I have taken up a labor with them, showing what is shown in 
the scriptures, and showing that their spiritual heads ignored these 
very things. 

We have talked sometimes on the resurrection, and shown them 
plainly that Jesus was crucified, and his body laid in a tomb, and that 
a guard was placed over his body for fear that something might hap- 
pen to give the diciples of Jesus a chance to claim that he had proph- 
esied truly that he would rise again. The Jews went to the Roman 



114 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



governor and they begged that there might be a guard placed over the 
remains of Jesus, that no such thing as this might take place; and 
on the third morning, before itj was light, there was a wonderful con- 
vulsion of nature, and the Roman guards became frightened, and they 
left the place, you know in those times it meant death to a Roman sol- 
dier to leave his guard. Now, it is not likely that those men left that 
place in the night, as those men thought might have been the case ; 
hut something came that probably frightened those men almost to 
death ; and early in the morning one of Jesus'- followers who had been 
greatly benefited by Jesus, in having had evil spirits cast out of her, 
came to the sepulchre, and there Mary found the stone rolled away ; and 
then she departed and went to the house of Peter and John, and she 
apprised them of the fact- and they ran to the sepulchre. John out- 
ran Peter, and arrived first^ but when Peter came, he bolted into the 
sepulchre, impetuous as he was, and found the linen cloth or napkin 
lying at the foot of the sepulchre ; but Jesus' body was not there. Now 
what took place at that time? Just the fulfilment of the promise 
Jesus had made them, that he would come forth. They discovered 
then the things that they had an idea of, but not a present knowl- 
edge. They discovered then the reality of the resurrection of the Son 
of God. They had perhaps looked upon him as an advanced teacher, 
something like Confucius, Mohammed' and other great teachers in 
the world, but perhaps had never realized the tangibility of a resur- 
rection. Alary came back, and as she was weeping, she looked upon 
the sepulchre and she saw two angels dressed in white, one sitting at 
the foot and the other at the head, where Jesus had lain, and they 
accosted her in these words: "Woman, why weepest thou?" She said, 
"Because they have taken away my Lord and I know not where they 
have laid him." An4 as she was turning she saw Jesus standing, but 
knew not that it was Jesus. And he said, "Woman, whom seekest thou ?" 
And she said, supposing him to be the gardener, "Because they have 
taken away my Lord and I know not where they have laid him ; if 
thou hast borne him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I 
will take him away." And then, as Jesus turned facing the woman, he 
said : "Mary," and she recognized him and was convinced, and in the 
excitement she went to embrace him, but he said, "Touch me not, 
for I am not yet ascended to my Father, but go to my brethren and 
say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father, and to my 
God, and your God." 

Now, in talking upon this proposition at one time, a man claim- 
ing to be a linguist said, I want to give you the right rendition of 
"touch me not." He said it meant "don't detain me." It sounds better 
to me. But, however, Mary was an ambassador at this particular time. 
You remember, Mary went to the disciples and told them he had 
gone to his Father. Now, many manifestations took place at that 
particular day. But there was gathered together a little knot of these 
people. They were discussing the wonderful things that had taken 



ELDER ARNOLD G. MILLER. 



115 



place, and at that particular time Jesus came and stood in the midst 
of them, and said, "Peace be unto you." But they were affrighted and 
terrified, thinking they had seen a spirit. That is, they thought 
it would be a spiritual resurrection, not a tangible one. Jesus accosted 
them, knowing the fears in their hearts, saying : ; "Why do fears arise 
in your hearts, behold my hands and my feet, that it is I, myself." 
Then he stretched forth his hands before them and said, "Handle 
me and see ; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones as ye see 
me have." He showed them his hands and feet, and while they 
believed him not for wonder and for joy he said unto them, 
"Have ye any meat?" And they gave him a piece of broiled fish and 
honey comb and Jesus ate it before them. Thus Jesus demonstrated 
to those people that he was tangible and real, a resurrected being. 
Paul says, "We do not know how we will appear, but we will appear 
like unto him." He says further, "If we have been buried with him in 
baptism, we shall be like him in the resurrection of the dead." 

. In discussing this subject before the people, we have found people 
who admit that inasmuch as Jesus' body had, not become corrupted 
it would be possible to accomplish this great thing, but deny the 
resurrection of the body after it has gone into the mother earth. 
Then we bring up the incident of his providing food for a multitude 
of people in four or five loaves and a few little fishes, and yet after 
feeding some four thousand people, they had twelve basketfuls re- 
maining. We argue the point to the people of the world set forth 
in the first chapter of John, that by him and through him were all 
created. Now, if God created this earth, then should we curtail his 
power, and say that he cannot bring back the elements and breathe 
into them, so to speak, the breath of life. Another scripture, found in 
Mathew, 27: 51,52. "And the graves were opened, and many of the 
saints who had slept came out of their graves- and went into the holy 
city and appeared unto many." Here is an evidence of one of the apos- 
tles, who perhaps gave up his life for the testimony that he gave to 
the world, that there were others resurrected after the resurrection of 
Christ. 

Again, now nearly one hundred years ago, on the Susquehanna 
river, when two men had gone out to pray in regard to baptism, there 
came a personage who declared he was John the Baptist the one who 
baptized Jesus in the river Jordan, and said: "Upon you my fellow 
servants (as he laid his hands upon their heads) I confer the Priest- 
hood of Aaron, which has the keys of the administration of angels 
and of baptism for the remission of sins ; and this will not be taken 
from the earth until the sons of Levi do offer again an offering in 
righteousness." They felt his hands upon their heads. John, who 
had been taken before the Master was slain, he had been resurrected 
from the dead. 

I am taking up too much time, excuse me. Oh, I love the doc- 



116

trines that are contained in the Bible. I love to ponder over the reve- 
lations of God in the Doctrine and Covenants. 

I wish to say to the young people that there is no myth in the 
resurrection of Jesus Christ or of other individuals. I like to proclaim 
unto them that I know that Joseph Smith was aj prophet of God. That 
God revealed himself unto him, because of the prayer of faith in his 
early manhood. I have this testimony, too, for God revealed it unto 
me in my early manhood. I was sceptical, was worrying,- I had my 
doubts and stragglings. I wanted to know if Joseph Smith was a 
Prophet inspired of God ; I wanted to know if the Book of Mormon 
was true, because I had been reading it and pondering its pages, and 
had found many things there that I could not understand because they 
were too great for my conception. I wanted to know if the things inci- 
dent to the establishment of this great latter-day work were true. 
And the Spirit of God came upon me upon a desert plain where I 
then was, and it filled my whole being with a living fire, it radiated 
to the very tips of my fingers, to the very hairs of my head, and I 
was shown these things that I could not understand before ; it burned 
into my being that Joseph Smith was a prophet of God, and that the 
Book of Mormon is true. 

I would like to follow out the story of the resurrection at some 
future time. I pray that we may have the living faith that our fore- 
fathers had' that we may demonstrate in that child-like, living faith 
the purposes of our Father, which I ask in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen.

ELDER OWEN BENNION 

{President of the Duchesne Stake of Zion.) 

My brethern and sisters, I have a great prayer in my heart this 
morning. It is that those of us who occupy the time may do so under 
the inspiration of the Spirit of the Lord, and those who listen may 
have that same inspiration, that each one of us may be able to gather 
from the speakers such encouragement or such exhortation or advice 
as may be best fitted to our present needs. 

I am very grateful that my parents received the gospel, many 
years ago, in the Old world, and that I was permitted to be their son. 
I have great sympathy with the boys and the girls who have been 
reared in the land of Zion. I have a great appreciation of the tempta- 
tions the evil one places in their way. I have a great appreciation of 
the responsibility that rests upon them to set examples of righteousness 
before the world, and take advantage of the opportunities that the 
Lord has given ; and I beg of these my brethern and sisters who have 



ELDER OWEN BEN N ION. 



117 



been so situated as I have, whose parents have left the old world and 
have come here for the sake of the gospel, that their sons and 
daughters might be properly trained, and that they might be the 
means of giving the light of the gospel to the world ; I hope that our 
heavenly Father will give them a sense of responsibility that rests 
Jupon them through this great privilege they have. Those who are 
present who have received the gospel themselves in the Old world 
have been under great responsibility, and they have come to this land 
of Zion. They have come because of the testimony that perhaps many 
of their former associates in the Old countries did not have and 
perhaps a testimony that their children have not had and sometimes 
they will be turned aside somewhat by the actions of their sons and 
daughters. I hope they will realize that the evil one works in Zion 
as well as out of Zion. For myself, I have a great sympathy, and a 
great understanding for the Scandinavian gentleman who said : "If 
there is anything that is not good for me, that is what I would like; 
if there is anything that I ought not to do, that is what I want to do." 
The evil one works upon those in responsibility to such an extent 
that we ought to have charity for them. I have had in my mind these 
men. I have had in my mind the responsibility that rests upon the 
young people, and I would like to say to the fathers and mothers 
present, it seems to me that we leave too much responsibility of train- 
ing our young people aright to our heavenly Father, or to the cir- 
cumstances around them. We fail to realize sufficiently that our 
heavenly Father does work through us, that it is our responsibility 
to take care of all these boys and girls ; that because we know that 
the gospel is true, it does not follow that they know it. It is just as 
necessary that the spirit of that gospel should come to them as it was 
that it should come to us w They have to know for themselves that the 
gospel is true just as we have to, and just as our' grand-parents have to, 
and just as our grand-children will have to know it. 

We sometimes fail to realize that the temptation of the evil one 
come to our children and grand-children as well as they come to us, 
and it is our responsibility to care for and look after them. It is our 
responsibility to see that from the time of their baptism they are 
trained in righteousness, truth, and charity. The mother who teaches 
the little ones to pray must take care to see them grow up in the 
truth, that they may follow in the path in which they have been 
started. 

I want to testify to you that it is time half wasted, if we stop 
there. Even though there comes a time in the lives of the young people 
when they are not just what we would have them to be, when the right 
thing comes they will exhibit the influence of the early training they 
have received, and it is a responsibility that devolves upon us, fathers 
and mothers, to give them that teaching. What can religion class 
teachers do if there is no foundation laid in the boy or girl of 
fourteen years of age brought to them? The familiarity of the

I 



teachings of the Sunday School leaders and the leaders of the religion 
classes and other organizations are such that the responsibility of 
religious training rests upon us. I noticed that President Widtsoe 
used the word "entertainment," and corrected himself. I would like 
to say that there is too much of an idea among the Latter-day Saints 
that we have to be entertained at all times. Our religion is not a 
matter of entertainment. I have heard men and women complain that 
they cannot get their boys and girls to go to meeting, because it is 
not entertaining. You know what the Catholics claim, that if they 
have the child until it is nine years old they have it afterwards, for 
the rest of its life. Their religion is not entertaning. I have seen young 
men and women and old men and women, count beads, because of 
the training they had when they were children, before they were 
nine years old. 

It is my testimony that the Lord knew what he was talking 
about when he said the Latter-day Saints should teach their children 
the gospel before they are eight years old, and when he says that 
our young boys should become deacons and teachers at a certain 
age, that is the time that the Priesthood should be given unto them. 
The same time and the same opportunity comes but once in a life 
time. 

It is my testimony that the gospel is true, that while we may fail, 
the Lord never fails in his promises. I pray that the Spirit of the 
Lord may be with us, that we may live our religion one day after 
another. That is all that is required. I ask in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 

A solo and chorus, "Calvary," was sung by Lily Bennion and 
the choir. 



ELDER ANDREW JENSON 

(Assistant Church Historian) 

My beloved brethren and sisters: I have enjoyed this meeting 
so far, and in the remarks I shall make I hope I may be blessed with 
the inspiration of the Almighty. And while I do not desire to detract 
in the least degree from the gospel discourses and the practical advice 
from former speakers, to which we have listened, yet I desire to add 
something in the nature of testimony, perhaps out of the ordinary 
way. I desire to do this with a view to strengthen us in our most 
holy faith and make us understand better than before, if possible, 
that God is with the true Latter-day Saints ' and that those who have 
enlisted in his service and who remain faithful and true to the whisper- 
ings of the Holy Spirit and to those who rule in the midst of Israel,

will always be in the right, and consequently prosper, while those who 
are disobedient and rebellious will fail. 

I have lately returned from a special mission to the Republic of 
Mexico and to most of the Latter-day Saints missions in the United 
States, during which I have traveled about 20,000 miles and have had 
occasion to visit many places which I never visited before. I had 
already visited many foreign lands and nearly all the foreign mission- 
ary fields of the Church, but it so happened that my historical labors 
in the United States, so far as the missions here are concerned, were 
left until the last. In traveling through our American missions, as I 
have now done, I found myself repeatedly standing on what we some- 
times term "sacred ground," because the places seen were closely 
connected with the early scenes of the Church, and I was brought 
face to face with many things of a historical nature which I did not 
experience on my travels to foreign countries. 

There are two things which deeply impressed me, while on this 
special mission — something that I cannot dismiss from my mind 
upon my return home. One of these is the predictions contained in 
the Book or Mormon concerning the Indians, or Lamanites, the aborig- 
ines of this western hemisphere. On my sojourn in the! Eastern 
States mission I had occasion to stand upon the hill Cumorah, as I 
had done upon two former occasions, and also had the privilege of 
spending a night in the old Smith home, near Manchester, western 
New York, where the angel Moroni appeared to the Prophet Joseph 
Smith that memorable night between September 21 and 22, 1823. 

I have always been interested in the Book of Mormon, having 
read it over and over again since I was a boy, and while visiting old 
Mexico, together with Prest. Rev L. Pratt and others, on my late 
mission, I began to study with greater interest than ever before the 
predictions contained in the Book of Mormon regarding the Lam- 
anites and the possible fulfilment of these predictions. The remnants 
of the house of Israel, now known as the North American Indians, 
have so far disappointed us to a certain extent. We have had mis- 
sionaries among the Indians since the beginning of 1831, and some 
of the very best and most faithful elders in the Church have devoted 
the principal part of their lives endeavoring to learn the various 
languages or dialects spoken by the several tribes oi Indians in the 
United States. But after all their efforts in that regard they have 
only been able to reach a few people, and their labors have resulted 
in bringing a still smaller number of Lamanites to a knowledge of 
the truth, and of those who have been baptized quite a few have not 
been faithful to their covenants, but have returned to their old habits 
and uncivilized ways and thus rendered the Church very little 
assistance. On this account we have been inclined to attach but very 
little importance to our Indian missions, or even to the mission estab- 
lished many years ago in our sister republic on the south, the Mexican 
mission. For compared with some of the missions among white 
people in our own country, and in foreign lands, the fruits or results 
have not been satisfactory. In view of these facte, some of us have 



120 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



been led to query: How shall the predictions of the Book of Mormon 
regarding the Lamanites be fulfilled? And will they ever become a 
white and delightsome people and assist the so-called Gentiles (who 
shall be converted, to build up Zion and establish truth and right- 
eousness upon the earth? Those of us, however, who have accepted the 
Book of Mormon as an ispired record will not concede for a moment 
that the words of the Lord will fail ; hence, we naturally extend our 
vision and researches to other tribes of Indians, besides these once 
powerful tribes within the boundaries of the United States. 

We, therefore cast a glance southward into old Mexico and through 
the great countries beyond — down through Central America and South 
America, where there are millions and millions of Lamanites, direct 
descendants of Father Lehi. We read with mixed feelings of sadness 
and joy about the Spaniards, who many years ago conquered the 
Aztecs of Mexico and the powerful tribes in South America, and who 
compelled the natives, at the point of the sword, to abandon their 
idols and paganism and accept that kind of Christianity which is repre- 
sented by the Roman Catholic Church. We deplore the methods used 
to bring this change about ; we shall always sympathize with the great 
Aztec Chief Montezuma and his people, when we read of the tyranny 
and oppression practiced . upon them by Cortez and his soldiers. But 
there is one redeeming feature connected with all this Spanish warfare 
and bloodshed. The conquerors taught the inhabitants of Mexico, Cen- 
tral America and South America the Spanish language, which language 
is now spoken by nearly all peoples in these lands. Consequently, when 
our elders (at the present time are sent to labor in the Mexican mission, 
and they succeed in learning the Spanish language, they can preach 
the true gospel of Jesus Christ to many millions. This fact stands 
forth in great contrast to the activities of Jacob Hamblin and others 
who labored as Lamanite missionaries in the United States, who could 
only reach a few small tribes after studying as hard, and perhaps 
worked harder to learn a local Indian dialect thjan our missionaries 
do in learning the Spanish language. I therefore look for the M'exican 
mission, now by many considered of but little importance, to flourish 
by and by, and become one of the best and most important missions 
of the Church, and I would further suggest that whenever the time 
comes that these Lamanites in the south shall embrace the Gospel, 
there will be a sufficient number .of them to fulfil every prediction 
contained in the Book of Mormon concerning the Lamanites, and 
justify every expectation that we have had in regard to the help which 
these remnants of the house of Israel shall render in building up Zion 
in these last days. I desire to present this matter to you as my testimony 
and my faith in all that God has ever spoken through the mouths of 
his holy prophets. Heaven and earth may pass awav, but not one jot 
or tittle of that which God has spoken will ever fail. Every word of 
prophecy contained in the Bible, the Book of Mormon, the Doctrine 
and Covenants and the Pearl of Great Price, and perhaps many others 
not contained in these four standard works of the Church, will surely 
be fulfilled in the own due time of the Lord.

The other matters, which attracted my attention and created special 
interest in my mind, while traveling recently in the United States, were 
certain facts connected with the several factions of apostate organiza- 
tions which have broken away from the Church since it was first 
organized, a departure from the true order of the Church commenced 
almost immediately after Joseph Smith began his divine mission upon 
the earth. Ever since that great Anglo-Saxon Prophet began to receive 
glorious visions, converse with angels and obtain the gifts of transla- 
tion, the devil has tried to counterfeit everything the Lord has done, 
and that, too, with considerable success, by deceiving people through 
impostors or tools who were willing to be used for that purpose. 
Through these emissaries the evil one has attempted to confuse the 
minds of mankind by introducing into the world through his agency 
and inspiration all kinds of imitations to deceive the very elect, if 
possible. Thus, if a servant of the Lord prophesied in the name of the 
Lord, the devil would do the same thing and claim that he also did 
it by the power of God, when in reality it was inspired by the powers 
of darkness and deception, 

Soon after Joseph had received the gift of translating sacred re- 
cords by the gift and power of God, other men were influenced to 
translate by soma, power which they themselves perhaps did not under- 
stand, and while some of these efforts seemed at first to be somewhat 
successful time proved them all to be failures. The Prophet Joseph 
in his history records as early as September, 1830, that Hiram Page, 
one of the Eight Witnesses to the Book of Mormon, had in his posses- 
sion a certain stone by which he obtained certain revelations concerning 
the upbuilding of Zion, the order of the Church, etc., all of which were 
entirely at variance with the order of God's house, as laid down in the 
New Testament, as well as in modern revelation. The Whitmer family 
and Oliver Cowdery were among those who believed in some things 
brought forth through this stone. So Joseph, the Prophet, enquired of 
the Lord and received the revelation which constitutes the 28th section 
of the new edition of the Doctrine and Covenants. And at a confer- 
ence held soon afterwards Bro. Page, as well as all members of the 
Church who were present renounced the said stone and all things 
connected with it. 

In February, 1831, a woman, who professed to be a prophetess of 
the Lord and who believed the Book of Mormon to be true, made 
"pretentions of revealing commandments, laws and other curious mat- 
ters," so it became necessary for the Prophet once more to enquire of 
the Lord and in answer the 43rd section of the Doctrine and Covenants 
was given, in which the Lord plainly said ttjat "there is none other 
was given unto you to receive commandments and revelations until 
he [Joseph Smith] be taken, if he abide in me," etc. 

Soon afterwards, when the Saints began to congregate in Ohio and 
there became quite numerous, they were blessed with many of the gifts 
and powers of the gospel ; but almost at the same time, according to 
the statement of Parley P Pratt, "some very strange spiritual opera* 
tions were manifested, which were disgusting, rather than edifying. 



122 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Some persona would seem, 1 to swoon aw&y and make unseemly gestures 
and be drawn and disfigured in their countenances. Others would go 
into ecstasy and be drawn into contortions, cramp, fits, etc. ; others 
would seem to have visions and revelations which were not edifying 
and which were not congenial to the doctrine and spirit of the Gospel; 
in short a false and lying spirit seemed to be creeping into the Church." 
The question was referred to the Prophet Joseph, who enquired of the 
Lord, the result being a revelation given in May, 1831, in which the 
Lord explains the difference between the manifestations of the power 
of God and the manifestations of the power of evil. (See Doc. & Cov. 
Sec. SO) 

According to the historian, Geo. A. Smith, the first attempt to 
establish an apostate Church, was made by one Wycam Clark, in 
Kirtland, Ohio. This Mr. Clark was baptized about the same time as 
Sidney Rigdon and, in company with Northrop Sweet and four others, 
seceded from the Church and said they would carry the whole world 
with them by preaching "Mormon" principles. They had two or three 
meetings and then the society broke up. 

Geo. A. Smith also says : "Another species of apostasy took place 
in the neighborhood of the forge at Kirtland. A man named Hoten 
seceded from the Church, denounced the Book of Mormon and the 
Prophet and established himself under the name of the Independent 
Church. A man named Montague was made bishop. This church got 
to number about ten members. They pretended under the order of 
the New Testament to have all things in common. In a few weeks the 
bishop, who' had charge of the temporal things, made a charge on the 
president for visiting his pork barrel, and the president charged the 
bishop with visiting his wife, and that broke up the society." (See 
Deseret News, Vol 7, page 364). 

Bro. Smith also mentions a man by the name of Hawley, who was 
attacked by a spirit of revelation, somewhere in the state of New 
York, while he was plowing, and it took him in such a hurry that he 
h(ad no time to put on his boots, but traveled barefoot to Kirtland, some 
600 miles distant, to warn Joseph that he was a fallen prophet, that 
God had cut Joseph off and placed in his stead a man by the name of 
Noah, and the reason why Joseph was cut off was that he had suffered 
the men belonging to the Church to wear cushions on their coat sleeves 
and the women to wear caps. He went through the streets of Kirtland 
with a dismal howl, crying: "Woe, woe, to the people." On one 
occasion, about midnight, Brigham Young went out and took with him 
a cowhide and said to Hawley: "If you don't quit annoying the people 
with your, noise, I'll cowhide you." Mr. Hawley then considered that 
he had suffered persecution enough for his Master's sake and shup up 
his noise. 

After the selection of the first quorum of Twelve apostles, in 
1835, and after the dedication of the Kirtland temple, the spirit of 
apostasy became more general, and one of the First Presidency, several 
of the apostles, and other prominent men in the Church, were all 
carried away in this apostasy; and one of their number, namely, 



ELDER ANDREW J EN SON.

Warren Parrish, who had been a traveling missionary in the Church 
in the Southern States, and known as an eloquent preacher, undertook 
to organize those elements into & Church. They were going to renounce 
the Book of Mormon and Joseph Smith and take the "Mormon" 
doctrines to overthrow all the religions of the world and unite all 
the Christians into one great religious band — they to be its great leaders. 
This apostasy took place in 1837 and 1838. When Heber C. Kimball, 
while filling a mission in 1844, was crossing Fox River on a ferry, 
he encountered Warren Parrish as a grave-looking man — a strait- 
jacketed fellow, dressed in black, with a white handkerchief ground 
his neck. He spoke to Elder Kimball, slaying: "Elder Kimball, will 
you have the goodness not to say to the people here that I was a 
'Mormon !' I am a Baptist minister and am preaching in that meeting- 
house at a salary of $500 a year. If they find out that I have been a 
'Mormon,' it would hurt my influence very much indeed." The question 
arises : Where was the big church he had tried to build up. He had 
tried pleading law, but failed, and he had been peddling bogus money, 
which also failed, like the big church speculation. George A. Smith 
in explaining the origin of the Warren Parrish movement says : 
I recollect waking up late one evening when I was quite a young 
man and hearing my father and one of the brethren talk. Being a 
little disposed to listen, I learned that there had been considerable of 
a difficulty between Parrish and one of the brethren. This was when 
he was in good standing in the Church. He had been too kind with 
the brother's wife. Then I learned the commencement of his apostasy. 

At the breaking up of Far West, Mo., in 1838-39 Isaac Russell, 
one of the missionaries who first brought the gospel to Great Britain, 
undertook to lead the Saints into the wilderness. He gathered some 
twenty followers, but did not succeed. He afterwards suffered much 
persecution in Missouri and died in Richmond Sept. 25, 1844. 

David Whitmer, one of the Three Witnesses to the Book of 
Mormon, like all the witnesses to that sacred record, remained faith- 
ful to his testimony regarding the Book of Mormon, but otherwise 
he fell into darkness and allowed himself to be influenced by a 
number of apostate leaders, such as James J. Strang, and later Wm, 
E. McLellin. And when he became an old man, he undertook to 
organize a church of his own, claiming that inasmuch as he had 
been ordained and set apart by Joseph Smith to preside over a stake 
of Zion organized in Clay county, Mo., in 1834, he had as much 
authority as the Prophet himself. He obtained a few followers in 
Missouri, but not enough to make a complete church organization. 
He presided over his little church until he died in 1888, and when 
I visited Richmond, a few months later, his nephew John C. Whi+mer, 
a son of Jacob Whitmer, had succeeded him as president of the 
Whitmerite faction. There is a very small remnant of that church 
left yet. 

Mr. Francis Gladden Bishop, commonly known as Gladden Bish- 
op, and his brother I. H. Bishop, also started ^ church of their own, 
which became known as "Gladden Bishopites." Mr. Bishop believed 



124 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



that the valley of the Colorado was the place of refuge for the 
Saints at the time they were expelled from Nauvoo. He had joined 
the true Church in 1832, (and after being ordained an elder did con- 
siderable missionary work for the Church ; but he fell into darkness, 
and, under the influence of a delusive spirit, he organized a new 
church, as stated. He was on trial as early as 1842 before the High 
Council at Nauvoo (Joseph the Prophet being present) on complaint 
of having received, written and published or taught certain revelations 
and doctrines not consistent with the doctrines and covenants of the 
Church. At first Mr. Bishop refused to present the written revela- 
tion, but finally read portions of it to the council. The purported 
revelation appeared to be the extreme of folly, nonsense, absurdity, 
falsehood and bombastic egotism. Joseph the Prophet explained the 
nature of the case and gave a very clear elucidation of the tendency 
of such prophets and prophesying, and then delivered Mr. Bishop 
over to the bufferings of Satan until he shoidd learn wisdom. The 
council then disfellowshiped Mr. Bishop. It was after that that he 
organized a church of his own. 

Oliver Olney, who joined the Church at an early day and had 
presided over the Teachers in Kirtland was disfellowshiped in 
Nauvoo, 111., by the High Council of that place for setting himself 
up as a prophet. Later (Feb. 10, 1843) Oliver Olney was tried before 
a court in Nauvoo for stealing goods. He declared before the 
court that he had been visited many times by the Ancient of Days, 
that he had a mission from him to the four quarters of the world, 
that he had visited them all except one in the south, that he had 
suffered much for two or three years for want of clothing, that he 
despised a theft except to clothe himself, etc. Joseph the Prophet 
declared that Olney had never seen the Ancient of Days, or anything 
like him, but that he was under the influence of a wicked and de- 
lusive spirit. 

William Law acted for a while as second counselor to the 
Prophet Joseph Smith in Nauvoo, 111., and while on terms of inti- 
mate friendship with the Prophet he was, Judas-like, plotting with 
his enemies to destroy him. His treachery was found out ,and he was 
dropped from his position and excommunicated from the Church. 
But so strongly did this base man profess to believe in the doctrines 
of the Church that after declaring Joseph Smith to be a fallen prophet 
he actually attempted to organize a church of his own. He put himself 
at the head of it as a prophet, chose two other apostates to act with 
him as counselors, and proceeded to select twelve men to be his 
apostles. This movement of his and his confreres was the height of 
impudence and hypocrisy, and of course it failed. 

When Joseph, the Prophet, was martyred the members of the 
Church were placed in a t position which they had never before 
experienced. Nobody had looked for Joseph Smith's early demise (he 
being only 38 ye^ars of age) although he had hinted at it several times. 
But the people seemingly did not understand him, no more than the 
disciples of old understood Jesus the Christ when he talked to them 



ELDER ANDREW JENSEN. 



125 



of his early death. Not until he arose from the grave did the apostles 
and disciples of old understand. The Church in our day did not 
understand the principles of succession of the presidency of the 
Church, in 1844, as well as they do now. Sidney Rigdon who had acted 
a,s first counselor to Joseph the Prophet came forward after the 
martyrdom of Joseph and wanted the Church to accept of him as the 
Guardian of the Church. He had not been true to the Prophet Joseph 
for several years, and after his case had been investigated by 'ihe 
apostles and high council at Nauvoo, he was excommunicated from 
the Church. He then went to Pennsylvania and organized a church 
of his own, which had some following for several years and did not 
altogether cease to exist as an organization until the death of Sidney 
Rigdon, in 1876. 

William Smith, the Prophet's brother, who had succeeded to the 
position of Presiding Patriarch of the Church, also tried to organize 
a separate faction, but most of his followers subsequently left him 
to follow James J. Strang, another pretended leader. 

James J. Strang had joined the Church shortly before the death 
of the Prophet. He claimed to have received a letter from the Prophet 
Joseph appointing him to preside over the Church, in case the Prophet 
should die, and he made further assertions to the effect that he had 
seen an angel, received revelations, etc. Fie tried to organize a stake 
in Voree, Wisconsin, with two or three hundred followers, and 
afterwards moved his headquarters to Beaver Island, in Lake Michi- 
gan, where he founded a town called St. Jlame,s and had his follow- 
ers anoint him a king, to preside over the kingdom of God, claiming 
at the same time that Joseph Smith had only been president of the 
Church. For a short time King James reigned apparently with a de- 
gree of success, but after a while he became overbearing and tyranni- 
cal in his ways, and on a certain occasion he had some of his dis- 
obedient or rebellious followers whipped in public. This so exasperated 
the parties thus punished that they improved the first opportunity they 
could find to assassinate James J. Strang. This took place in 1855 on 
Beaver Island. This was the end of "King James," but strange enough 
some of his followers continued to adhere to' his false doctrines and 
really believed that he was called of God, that he had received revela- 
tions and was the true successor of the Prophet Joseph. About twenty 
years ago one of the Strangite apostles visited Utah. There may be 
half a dozen Strangites yet alive. 

On my recent visit to Texas I became quite well acquainted with 
the career of Lyman Wight in that country. Lyman Wight was a 
strong and influential man in the days of the Prophet Joseph, and had 
acted for several years as one of the twelve apostles, but when 
Joseph passed away Lyman Wight claimed that he would not follow 
Brigham Young or any other man in the Church. Hence, when it 
was decided (at the time of the exodus from Nauvoo, in 1846) thj&t 
the Saints would seek a new home in the Rocky Mountains, Elder 
Wight refused to go into that desert country, having perhaps forgotten 
that Joseph Smith had predicted that the Saints should become a 



126 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



mighty people in the Rocky Mountains. So, instead of working in 
harmony with the other members of his quorum, he led two or three 
hundred people, members of the Church, first into the Indian Ter- 
ritory and later to that part of Texas where Austin, the capital of 
that state, now stands. There, in a beautiful galley, he built a mill 
and endeavored to establish a colony but failed. He tried three other 
localities but failed again in regular succession, until rqany of his 
followers left him and he himself died as a drunkard, in 1858. 
Lyman Wight remained true to the first principles of the gospel and 
tried even to practice the rules of the United Order, or something 
similar, in which the members of his church should be equal in 
temporal as well as spiritual things ; but while he was colonizing 
in one of the best districts of country and should have met with 
great success, he entirely failed, as stated,, while Prest. Brigham 
Young and the Twelve who remained true to the Church proceeded 
in the successful establishment of settlements of the Saints in the 
Rocky Mountains, though that part of our great country which is now 
Utah was at the time of Lyman Wight's departure for the south a 
desert and desolate country as compared to Texas. 

George Miller had been one of the presiding bishops of the 
Church in Nauvoo and had led one of the leading camps of the 
Saints westward into the wilderness. But he became disaffected and 
with a small faction, over which he gained influence, he also went 
down into Texas, where he for a short time affiliated with Lyman 
Wight, but fell out with him and left for the north, afterwards to 
become a follower of James J. Strang. 

Alpheus Cutler, who joined the Church at an early day and was 
quite active in Missouri, was chosen a member of the High Council 
in Nauvoo, Illinois, and afterwards acted as President of the High 
Council at Winter Quarters, Neb. When Prest. Brigham Young left 
Winter Quarters, in 1848, on his second trip to the Valley- with a 
large emigration Alpheus Cutler remained in Iowa, where he for some 
time was identified with the Silver Creek branch, but he was dis- 
fellowshiped from the Church at a conference held in Pottawattamie 
County, Iowa, for exercising an influence against the migration to the 
Valley and for advocating the building of a temple, etc. At a general 
conference held in Salt Lake City, in 1850, Father Alpheus Cutler, as 
he was generally called, was excommunicated from the Church. After 
that he organized a church of his own. According to the statement of 
Bishop Abraham A. Kimball Alpheus Cutler changed his residence 
from Pottawattomie county to Manti, Fremont county, Iowa, where he 
organized a church and constituted himself as its leader, calling it 
"The true Church of Latter-day Saints," and presumed to officiate in 
the ordinances of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 
such as baptisms, endowments, etc. He also energetically denounced 
polygamy and the law of tithing, and taught his followers that Joseph 
Smith was a true Prophet of God, but that Brigham Young was not 
his successor, but an imposter and that he (Alpheus Cutler) was the 
true leader and held the authority to carry on the Latter-day work. 



ELDER ANDREW JENSON. 



127 



This pretended "true church" was organized with Alpheus Cutler as 
president, Edmund Fisher as first, and Chauncey Whiting as second, 
counselor, and Grandfather Fisher a,s patriarch. 

It so happened that Heber C. Kimball had married two of Al- 
pheus Cutler's daughters, but when Heber C. Kimball, in 1848, took 
part of his family to the Valley, these two Cutler girls, who each had 
a son, remained in Iowa. The two young women subsequently died, 
lejaving the two sons of Heber C. Kimball (Abraham A. and Isaac) 
who subsequently were told of their real parentage, which had been 
kept from them by their grandfather. Abraham A. Kimball (after- 
wards Bishop of Kanosh, Millard county, Utah,) became identified 
with his father's fjamily in Salt Lake City in 1862. The next year he 
was called on a mission and sent east to get his brother Isaac to the 
Valley, in which he succeeded. On this trip Alpheus Cutler, who had 
now become an old man looking toward the end of his journey, con- 
fided to his grandson as follows: "I know that Joseph Smith wjas a 
Prophet of God, and I know that Brigham Young is his legal suc- 
cessor, and I always did know, but the trouble with me was that I 
wanted to lead and could not be led. I have run my race, and sealed 
my doom, and I know what I have got to meet." He then, addressing 
Abraham;, his grandson, said : "Let what may turn up, never yield 
the point (never leave 'Mormonism'), for it will save and exalt you 
in the kingdom of God." He wept like a child after saying this, and 
then continued, speaking to his grandson: "One favor I wish to ask 
you, namely, that you will not divulge this confession to those whom I 
lead, while I live." Shortly after this Alpheus Cutler died and the 
church which he hjad organized ceased to exist. 

In 1848 a man by the name of James T. Brewster associated 
himself with Hazen Aldrich (at one time a president of Seventies) and 
organized a church, June 26, 1848, on the pretense that the Lord 
had rejected the original Church, and he (Brewster) having received 
a commission of the Lord to call together all the pure in heart to es- 
tablish anew the Church. Brewster also claimed the extraordinary 
gift of reproducing under the inspiration of the Almighty the lost 
books of Esdras, as a continuation of the First and Second Book of 
Esdras, which are known among the apocryphal writings of the Old 
Testament. There are still a few Brewsterites in existence. 

Granville Hedrick is the founder of a sect now known as the 
Hedrickites ; they are the possessors of the temple lot in Jfackson 
county, Missouri, and claim to be a branch of the original church or- 
ganized in 1830, but reject all the revelations received by the Prophet 
Joseph Smith later than 1834. 

The Josephites, or so-called Reorganized Church, came into ex- 
istence as a real organization, in 1860, when young Joseph, a son of 
the martyred Seer, accepted the leadership. The original member- 
ship of this Church was to a great extent made up of Strangites, 
Wightites, Wm. Smithites, Cutlerites and remnants of other fac- 
tions by means of whom the followers of that organization are 
trying to bridge over the interim, 1844-1860. The "Reorganites"

represent the only faction of apostate organizations which at the 
present time, so far as numbers are concerned, can claim any 
consideration. 

Joseph Morris, an early convert to the Church in Wales, was 
severely hurt in his youth from being hit in the head with a lump 
of coal, while working in the coal mines of Wales, and after 
joining the Church, and while doing missionary labors, he showed 
repeated signs of insanity, and finally a delusive spirit took pos- 
session of him after his arrival in Utah, and he organized a church 
and established himself on the Weber river as a prophet, in 1861. 
He pretended to receive a number of revelations which have since 
been published in a book, but he came in collision with the ter- 
ritorial authorities in 1862 and was killed together with a few 
others of his followers. His organization known as the Morrisites 
was broken up, yet there are even now a few alive who still be- 
lieve that Joseph Morris was a prophet. 

William S. Godbe was once a prominent man in the Church, but 
when co-operation started in 1868, he, as one of the merchants 
of Salt Lake City, rebelled, withdrew from, the Church and or- 
ganized with others what was called the "Godbeite movement," 
which, however, flourished only for a short time. 

There are a number of other factions which might be men- 
tioned, but time does not permit, such as the Bickertonites ; also 
the Modern Brewsterites (a movement set on foot by one F. R. 
Brewster, who called himself the Seventh Angel, the Captain of 
the Lord's Host, etc., early in the '80's in Salt Lake City). An 
organization made by the late John E. Forsgren, who established 
himself in a tent east of Salt Lake City with twelve women, 
representing the twelve tribes of Israel and others could be men- 
tioned. In fact I could mention altogether some thirty attempts 
made by apostates or seceders from the Church who claimed 
to succeed to the divine calling of the Prophet Joseph Smith. We 
have the history of all these factions at the Historian's Office, and 
are gathering additional information about them from time to 
time. 

President Young said at the important meeting held in Nau- 
voo, 111., Aug. 8, 1844: "If an man thinks he has influence among 
this people to lead away a party, let him try it, and he will find 
out that there is power with the apostles which will carry them 
off victorious through all the world" (Mill. Star, Vol. 25, page 216). 

This prediction on the part of President Brigham Young has 
certainly come true, and in my remarks I have only endeavored 
to show this great fundamental truth, that where the Priest- 
hood of God is exercised in righteousness, there is success and 
happiness, while the dissenters and apostates have always met 
with failure and disasters. The' history of the Church affords us 
abundance of proofs to establish this fact. It all goes to show 
that when we do what the Lord wants us to do, when we say 



ELDER ANDREW J EN SON. 



129 



what the Lord wants us to say and go where the Lord wants us 
to go, we will prosper. By doing this we will gain the victory over 
every species of evil, and, if we remain faithful to the end, be 
saved in the kingdom of God. 

May ^ God help' us to be true to him and to ourselves, and to 
the principles which we know to be true, I pray in the name of 
Jesus Christ. Amen. 

Manasseh Smith and the choir sang the hymn, "Victory." 
Benediction was pronounced by Elder James Z. Stewart. 



SECOND OVERFLOW MEETING 

A second overflow meeting was held outdoors near the Bureau 
of Information at 10 o'clock, Sunday morning, October 9, 1921. 
Elder David A. Smith of the Presiding Bishopric presided. Tracy 
Y. Cannon acted as chorister, and Frank W. Asper, as organist. 

The congregation sang, "Come, come, ye Saints." 

The opening prayer was offered by Elder Alfred W. Peterson, 
of the Salt Lake stake of Zion. 

The congregation sang, "High on the mountain top." 



ELDER JOSEPH R. SHEPHERD 

{President of the Logan Temple) 

This is certainly a glorious morning. All nature is smiling upon 
tis. The Spirit of the Lord is with us and has been with us in our 
conference, and will continue until its close. 

I have been thinking, as I have been sitting here this morning, 
of the words of the prophet wherein he said: 

» 

And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of the 
Lord's house shall be established in the top of the mountains, and shall be 
exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow unto it. 

And many people shall go and say. Come ye, and let us go up to the 
mountain of the Lord, to the house of the God of Jacob; ana he will teach 
us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for out of Zion shall go forth 
the law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem. 

Surely we have here a fulfilment of this prophecy, for I doubt 
not that if I were to ask how many nations were represented here 
this morning, even in this overflow meeting we would find representa- 
tives from nearly every nation under the sun. We would find either 
those who have been gathered from the nations of the earth them- 



130 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



selves, or we would find their sons or their daughters, or grandsons or 
granddaughters here. 

The thought that came to me in connection with this prophecy 
was, what a mighty responsibility rests upon this people who have 
gathered here, my brethren and sisters, for a specific purpose. The 
blood of Israel has been gathered from; the nations where it has been 
scattered. This is the day of gathering-in of the house of 'Israel; and 
the gathering in the tops of these mountains is for the purpose 
that we may learn more fully the ways of the Lord and that we may 
be able to walk in the path that the Lord would have us walk. 

And I have been wondering whether the younger generation, 
the sons and daughters of the fathers and mothers who have heeded 
the call of the Lord through his servants, have within them the 
same degree of faith and a desire to carry on his work, for which their 
fathers and their mothers have been gathered. Are we becoming careless 
in regard to these things? Are we forgetting the mission to which 
we have been called as a people? Are we observing the command- 
ments of God-, and are we doing those things that the Lord desires 
to have done through the gathering of Israel? 

In the hymn that we have just sung is one of the purposes for 
which this people has been gathered in this day and to these parts : 
that we might erect temples and participate in the sacred ordinances 
of the house of God. The hearts of our fathers and our mothers, 
when they crossed the plains, notwithstanding the arduous journey 
that they undertook, were filled with joy in contemplation of the 
very thing of which the prophet spoke, that they should come here 
unmolested, and that they might here serve God according to the 
dictates of their conscience ; and further, that they might establish 
themselves here and build temples to the name of the God of Jacob. 
As the hymn says, we are here that we may be saved, and also 
become saviors to those who were not permitted to enjoy these 
blessings. 

The gathering of the blood of Israel from the nations of the 
earth is a very important part of the mission of the Curch of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints. The blood of Israel has been mixed among 
all the gentile nations, and it is in the providence of our heavenly 
Father that in the last days they shall be gathered together ; and 
we are here, my brethren and sisters, and should see to it that the 
spirit of scattering does not enter into our souls. 

Growing up, we have a large number of young men and young 
women, whose greatest desire should be to enter into the temples 
that have been erected, and there enter into solemn covenant 
with their heavenly Father to serve him and to obey his laws and to 
assist in the establishment of Israel in this land. I have thought 
many times of the advice given to our young people con- 
cerning making alliances with those who are not of the same 
faith, — not that we have any quarrel with our neighbors, 



ELDER JOSEPH R. SHEPHERD 



131 



not at all ; not that there are not just as good people, so far as they 
understand things, outside of the Church as inside, — 'but, my brethren 
and sisters, this is a day of gathering and concentrating the blood of 
Israel. And, now that we have gathered out of the nations, let it be 
known that our sons and daughters, who are of the blood of Israel, 
should ally themselves together, when the time comes to enter the 
sacred relationship of husband and wife. It is displeasing in the sight 
of our heavenly Father that by our acts we should nullify, in effect, 
the very purpose for which we have gathered here. 

I have been impressed concerning this thing. We should seek to 
gather the blood of Israel; we should seek to intensify the blood, 
of Israel in our posterity. And how can that be done? By those 
who are of the blood of Israel allying themselves together in this 
sacred relationship. And then, as generations shall come and go, can 
you not see how the preponderance of the blood of Israel will come? 
It is a gathering, my brethren and sisters. 

I wonder if some of our parents who have given their lives 
in the establishment of their children in this favored land, would not 
be greatly disappointed if they found that their boys and girls were 
forgetting one of the great purposes for which they have gathered, 
and that they, like old Israel, are seeking after strange gods. From the 
beginning of time it was the will of God that those who entered into 
covenant with him to keep his laws and commandments, should only 
ally themselves with those of the opposite sex who similarly entered 
into covenant with him. We read right in the beginning, that one of the 
chief reasons why the curse of God was poured upon the people, why 
God became displeased, was because the sons of God looked upon the 
daughters of men and took them as their wives, as they pleased. Now, 
this is plain; we should understand it. Who were the sons of God? 
They were the ones who entered into covenant with him and who 
received of his commandments and acknowledged him as their Father 
and God. And who were the daughters of men? Those who had no 
faith in God and rejected him and his laws and his counsels. And it 
displeased the Father that there should be an amalgamation of these 
two opposing powers or factors; and from that time to the present, 
that commandment has been to Israel, and it is. the law of God to Israel 
today. There are plenty to select from ; look at the hosts of Israel 
as they are gathered together. We need not enter into this most sacred 
relationship with those who have not similar faith and ambition and 
desires. It will never be productive of good. I have heard presidents 
of the Church, for years, say: — and their advice was not only to Latter- 
day Saints but to other people — that it was not good that those who. 
diave opposing ambitions and views and faiths try to amalgamate 
together as husband and wife, because it will not work out. Either they 
will lose faith and; disregard the faith thatj they have, or else there will 
be eternal trouble. 

I believe this a matter of great importance, my brethren and.. 



132 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



sisters, and I speak to you as parents, and I speak to you as young 
men and as young 1 women; if your young people want happiness, 
peace, and the fullest joy in this life and the life which is to come, 
let them rememiber the advice and counsel that God has given his 
people, and in their selections, let them make selections of husband 

-or wife from those who have the same faith and ideals, and ambitions, 
and who are journeying toward the same goal. This subject of mar- 
riage, my brethren and sisters, is more important than some people 
think; it means more. It is the laying of the foundation for eternal 

glory and happiness in the celestial kingdom of God, if entered into with 

the proper spirit and with the proper understanding of that sacred 
relationship. What a sorrowful thing it is to know that there is such 
a large percentage yet of the sons and daughters of these pioneers, 

■who came here and gave their all for the gospel's sake, that nearly 
one half of them reject the opportunity granted to them of entering 
into this sacred relationship, which God ordained in the way that 

he did. 

I said we came here to build temples. One of the ordinances of 
the house of God is the solemnizing of this sacred relationship. 
And how blessed are those who have been born under the covenant, 
that they, having 'a high regard for the faith of their fathers and for 
their own faith, go to the house of God and there are sealed to their 
husband or wife for time and for all eternity. What is more sad than 
when death comes into the family and the wife or the husband is 
stricken, than to realize then that the relationship that has meant 
so much to them is at an end. And it is at an end, my brethren 
ami sisters, unless it has been solemnized by those who are author- 
ized of God, and the couple have been sealed together for time and 
for all eternity. 

And let us remember, too, that now is the time ; now is the accepted 
time. There are many who, for various reasons, which I have not 
time to discuss, refrain. They are those who have a kind of faith 
and a desire to do it, though not very strong, thinking, "O, that 
can be done sometime later on; we will leave this for someone else 
to do" or "we will do it when we get old." They procrastinate. It 
is dangerous, for let it be known, my brethren and sisters, that no man 
no woman, will ever receive the same degree of glory in the world 
1o come, who refuses and rejects to do the thing they may do in this 
i'fe — I care not if the work is done for them by somebody else. 

I hope the Latter-day Saints understand that. Certainly we do 
work for the dead; but some people have an erroneous idea that 

those who refuse to do the work in this life, and for whom the work is 
done after they have passed away, are just as well off then; that is 

a mistake. The primary principle of vicarious work for the dead is to 
do for themselves. You know our Christian friends on the outside — 

we call them Christian, even if they do not call us Christian — have 



ELDER JAMES N. LAMBERT 



133 



found fault with this doctrine of doing work for the dead, charging 
us with this that it is an encouragement for impenitence and of 
putting penitence off. That is not true; they do not understand 
what we believe in. Work may be done even for the sinner,' but he will 
never receive the same degree of glory, as if he had done it himself. 

Now these are some of the things, my brethren and sisters, that 
I thought of this morning as I saw this great audience here, and as 
we sang this hymn concerning the gathering of Israel, and as we 
sang the hymn in the opening of the meeting of the travels of our 
parents and grandparents of this country. I thought "Why all 
this?" It was that we may enjoy the greater blessings of the gospel 
that are administered in the house of God. That is one of the chief rea- 
sons. And here we are living under the shadow of the temple of God. 
Will we, any of us, reject the opportunity that we have for receiving 
these blessings ? I hope not. I am glad to say that so far as my personal 
experience goes, the spirit of the work is growing, and the testimonies 
of the divinity of the work are growing in the hearts of the people, and in 
proportion as our young people and our old people will go to the tem- 
ple of God and receive the blessings administered) to them there, it will 
give them additional testimony of the divinity of the work. Let us 
as sons and daughters of the noble pioneers who came here and left 
their all for the gospel's sake, be true to them, their memories, and 
their faith, and let us carry on the work that they expect of us. And 
may God's blessing be upon us to this end, I pray, in the name of 
Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER JAMES N. LAMBERT 

(Former President of the New Zealand Mission) 

I rejoice with you, my brethren and sisters, in the privilege that 
is afforded us to worship our heavenly Father on this beautiful 
morning. 

It is now something less than a hundred years ago since the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was established. Shortly 
after the Church was organized, in this day and age, the Lord said 
that he was about to commence a marvelous work, a work that would 
possibly not be understood by some. Shortly after our Church became 
a church, in the state of New York, our people — your people and 
mine — were compelled to move from that state because of persecution 
that was heaped upon them. They went from the state of New York 
into Ohio, and from Ohio to Missouri, and from Missouri back into 
Illinois. And then came the movement west into the valleys of the 
mountains. Some that were weak, who felt that they could not stand 
the heat and the burden of the day, fell by the wayside. The Lord 
blessed those, however, who had the tenacity, the will, the desire. 



134 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



It is recorded that even in the first company of pioneers who came 
here July 24, 1847, there were some who could not see the blessings 
of the Lord that would attend the people in the settlements of this 
valley. They were willing to take a chance as to what lay beyond, 
between here and the Pacific ocean; they reminded President Young 
that they had seen many places from the Missouri river unto this 
valley that appeared more inviting to the human eye than they saw 
when they first caught a glimpse of this valley. President Young's 
remark to them, however, as his prophetic eye could see what lay 
in the future for the people who settled here. was. "This is the place." 
And when reminded that • this was a part of the Great American 
Desert, he said that we would yet make it literally blossom as the rose. 
My brethren and sisters, you can testify to the truthfulness of this 
prophecy of President Brigham Young. Surely the Lord has blessed 
us; surely the Lord is blessing us. Wherever our people have settled, 
f:om Canada to Mexico, from California to states east of us, the 
Lord has blessed our people and blessed their efforts. 

I wonder if all of us are striving to do what is required of us as 
Latter-day Saints. Brother Shepherd in reminding us of one of the 
greatest blessings that has come unto us, one of the greatest gifts 
that the Lord has conferred upon us — to be married in the temples 
of our God, to be sealed to our companions, not only for this life, 
but for the life to come — wondered if all of us who are here this 
morning are doing our utmost to live up to that blessing. Are we 
teaching our children the blessings that have come unto us and that 
have been taken advantage of by us? 

You know we have been accused many a time of being a peculiar 
people, peculiar in our ways. In the first few years of the existence 
of our Church we were accused of believing in a God that has body, 
parts, and passions, of believing in a God that could hear and answer 
our prayers, of believing that we could ask him to direct us in the way 
in which we should go and that he would do so. We have been held 
up to ridicule, not only in this country, but throughout the world, 
wherever the gospel has been preached. But I believe the tide is 
turning ; I believe the people of the world are beginning to admire us 
and, perhaps, to sing our praises. 

You will remember that it is recorded in the Scripture that 
the Lord said we should beware when people would begin to say 
all manner of good things in favor of us, but rejoice and be exceeding 
glad when the world said things falsely against us. It was my privilege 
only a few weeks ago to talk to a prominent physician in this city, 
a man who does not claim to be a Latter-day Saint; and when he 
learned that I had recently returned from a mission where I had 
been preaching the gospel for some years, he said, "This system that 
you 'Mormon' people have of sending your missionaries into vhe 
world is a wonderful thing ; the other religious sects of the day do not 
have it ; the other religious organizations won't do it ; it is left entirely 



ELDER JAMES A\ LAMBERT 135 

for the 'Mormon' people to do it. I wonder how you started such 
a thing." I told him that away back in the beginning of our Church, 
the Prophet Joseph Smith received a revelation (o send our 
elders out two by two. to preach the gospel without fear or favor, 
to deliver the message that they had received, to warn their neighbor, 
even as they had been warned, and that we go out without hope or 
thought of reward so far as this life is concerned, when a call comes 
to us, whether to a man or woman, to go' out and preach the gospel, 
and we have been set apart for that particular work; that the Lord 
blesses us, and many return here seeing the fruits of iheir labors, 
and those who have not even had this privilege, later on see that 
ethers reap from the seed they sowed. 

I was reminded, in talking to this doctor, of the remark that 
was made some years ago by a prominent Salt Laker, a man who 
had come here and married a Salt Lake woman after he had visited 
all parts of the United States and other parts of the world. Tn the 
Commercial Club of Salt Lake City here, he made the statement 
that never in his travels had he met a people who were so ready 
to make answer, who were so ready to talk and discuss things, 
and give a reason for the hope that is within them. He said you can go 
into the smallest hamlet and find men and women there who can do 
it. and I marvel at it. A man who heard him make this statement was 
rather anxious to find out just why he thought he had found such a 
condition. This brother wanted to know if he had the right idea 
about it, and so at the close of the meeting in the Commercial Club, 
he asked this gentleman to what he attributed this ability that he found 
so peculiar among our people. He said, "That is no secret; it is this 
wonderful missionary system that you 'Mormon" people have, of 
sending your young men and your young women into the earth, into 
the various parts of the world to preach the gospel. They come back 
bubbling over with new ideas. They bring back the best things 
that they see, no matter whether they go to Japan or to Australia, 
or to South Africa or to various parts of Europe, or to various states 
of this Union." 

There is nothing in the world, my brethren and sisters, that 
benefits a person like comparison, travel, education. Do you wonder, 
therefore, at the high standard that is maintained by our people here 
in this state? We compare most favorably, when measured 
by the various states of the Union or various countries of the world, 
a c far as education is concerned. We have ever sought education. Our 
elders who go into the various mission fields and who come back with 
these excellent ideas gathered up from peoples to peoples, disseminate 
these good things among the rest of us. We have ever striven for that 
which is good and wholesome and pure, from the very things that 
we were taught in the early history of the Church, that "The glory 
of God is intelligence," that all we seek after here, all the good, 
the excellent things we get here, and remember and understand, will 



136 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 

rise with us in the hereafter, and by so achieving, by sot accomplishing 
and understanding these things, our power will become much greater 
in the other world. Do you wonder, then, at the ambition, do you 
wonder at the desire that is in the heart of every Latter-day Saint? 
Not at all. Do you wonder, then, that every parent puts forth his 
best efforts to teach his son or his daughter the things that are 
most dear to him, the gospel of eternal life, the gift of eternal life, 
that has been so much misunderstood, by the people of the world? 
You elders, and you sisters, who have been abroad preaching the 
gospel and have heard ministers and others contend that the gift of 
eternal life in the kingdom of God is the gift of God without any 
effort on our part, you have heard it, and you have wondered and 
marveled at the misconception that some people have. 

Let me point out a comparison that I have made on many an 
occasion when such arguments have been brought up. There is no 
state in the Union, no country in the world, that affords an education 
to a young man or woman, more than does the state of Utah. Our 
boys and girls growing up here are compelled to go to school. Books 
are found for them; pencils, paper, ink, are furnished them. They can 
go to school, and if they live any great distance, conveyances of 
some kind are provided for them. This 'gift' of education is theirs. 
It is not theirs for the asking, because it is forced upon them; they 
c re compelled to take it; a boy or girl in normal conditions must go to 
school and receive an education; they are compelled to. Would any- 
one say that education is not free ? Why no ; we boast of it ; we prate 
it, we sing of it; our missionaries in going to the uttermost parts of 
the world tell of the splendid things that we have achieved, and how 
when we are measured up to our sister states in this Union, we com- 
pare well with them. And yet, do you mean to tell me that any boy 
cr girl will ever go from one grade to another without an effort 
on his own part? Did you ever hear of anyone being graduated 
from the eighth grade into the high school without an effort on the 
part of the one who is receiving this splendid gift, without price, 
of education? Why no, and do you think a person can be admitted at 
the University who has not credits entitling him to go there? Not at 
all. And yet this education is free. No one would have the termerity to 
say that this education is not free. It IS free; yes, for those who 
WORK for it. God Almighty is not going to save his children in 
ignorance. Just as I quoted to you a few moments ago, "The glory 
of God is intelligence;" God rejoices in seeing his children grow and 
develop and become something. He does not look down upon us with 
any degree of satisfaction and joy when he knows that we are 
ignorant or will remain in ignorance — either in the principles of the 
gospel or in anything that is going to make us bigger or better or 
greater. God almighty will rejoice in seeing us become bigger, greater, 
better. 

I rejoice with you, my brethren and sisters, in this wonderful

137 



conference. I rejoice with you, and bear my testimony to you that 
I know that this is the Church of Jesus Christ, that within this 
Church are found the blessings of Almighty God, and that we cannot 
expect to find them, nor will we find them, outside. The Lord has 
been merciful, kind, considerate, long-suffering, and patient with 
some of us. May we appreciate these blessings. May we appreciate 
the outstretched hands of our Father, that are continually beckoning 
for us to come to him to receive at his hands these wonderful bless- 
ings that we have preached about, that we have sung, that we have 
told in story. 

My God add his blessings, my brethren and sisters; may he 
sustain us and uphold us in all our righteous endeavors, is my prayer, 
in the name of Jesus. Amen. 



ELDER NICHOLAS G. SMITH 

(Former President of the South African Mission.) 

My brethren and sisters and friends. I delight to testify to the 
goodness of God to me and to his people. I delight in having the 
opportunity of preaching the gospel. I love it. I love the people of this 
state. I love the "Mormon" people wherever they are, and I love all 
good people. Sometimes I think, when we are talking to ourselves and 
about ourselves, perhaps we laud ourselves a little too high. Speaking 
as a foreigner — for I may be counted as such since I have spent 
the last eight years of my life doing missionary work in the Union 
of South Africa — I can see a few things that look a little bit peculiar 
to me. Brother Lambert has just been telling you of some of our 
virtues, of how high we stand along educational and other lines; I 
picked up a Milwaukee paper not long ago, and it said that Utah was 
a wonderful state ; they do lots of fine things in Utah, but that Utah 
is a pest house; they have more small pox than any other state in 
the Union. Now, stop having small pox! (Laughter) 

I was impressed with the remarks of President Shepherd concern- 
ing some of the ordinances of the gospel. What a joy it is to us 
Latter-day Saints when we hear people abuse us on account of our 
faith and some < f the cloor.ne.- ol the gospel of Jesus Chris:. It lias 
not been very long since one of the ministers, whf.u they v^ere gath- 
ered together here in a convention ii. this city, ma )e the remark that 
the "Mormon" people stand today where they (ihe inini.vers, i stood 
one hundred years ago, that they still cling to the errors of a hundred 
years ago. Brother B. H. Roberts, in speaking in the tabernacle in 
answer to the accusations on the following Sunday said, "Well, we 
are thankful the Lord said that was the trouble with mankind ; they 
are in error." You will remember the words of the Lord to the 
Prophet Joseph Smith, "They draw near to me with their mouths, 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



and with their lips do honor me, but their hearts are far from me, 
and they teach the doctrines and commandments of men." They were 
in error ; they did not acknowledge it then, but now we find them 
acknowledging it. 

They say we stand where they stood one hundred years ago. 
Is it true? From which one of them did we learn about this great 
temple work? From which sect, if you please, did we copy temple 
building? Was it from the Presbyterians, or from the Methodists? 
No; they did not tell us about the hope that we should have for 
those who have gone before.. We did not copy it from any of them, 
did we? 

I remember down in South Africa, upon one occasion, I had 
been talking with a minister of the Church of England about the 
gospel, and this matter of salvation for the dead came up, and I told 
him our belief along these lines. "Why," he said, "that is blasphemy 
to think of such things, to teach that there is a hope after we are 
dead. You drive people away from the church. Do not talk such rot." 
I went into his church in the city of Ladysmith, and there were 
eleven of us present, counting the minister and myself ! And we 
drive people away from the church ! I said to him, "Come out to 
Salt Lake City, and I will take you into one building where ten 
thousand men and women are worshiping the true and living God, and 
yet you will tell us we drive them away from church by teaching that 
there is a hope for the dead." 

Think of it, my brethren and sisters, that tabernacle is tfull to 
overflowing with thousands and thousands of people, the Assembly 
Hall is overflowing, and here in the open air we have gathered together 
hundreds of people to worship God, and they would tell us we drive 
them away from the church because we teach the gospel of Jesus 
Christ. We teach that he is a loving Father, and it counts; it pays. 
Just think of condemning all his children who have not had the op- 
portunity of accepting this gospel here ! 

After the war had been going on for a few years, I had a 
Church of England minister say to me, "Well, there must be hope 
for the dead; when we think of our young boys who have gone to 
France and given up their lives, surely there must be an opportunity 
for them ; there must be some hope for them." Why, of course, there 
is. Would our heavenly Father condemn all of these men, hundreds 
of thousands of them, who never cared a thing about Jesus Christ, 
who were careless, cared not for religion? Will God condemn them? 
The only answer one can give is "No." Then will he condemn the 
untold millions of others who have perished in the same way, or in 
other ways? Are they condemned? Of course not. It is not reasonable. 
That is not the sort of God that the "Mormons" want to believe in. 
And from which of these sects did we copy such ideas? From which 
of the sects did we copy the belief that God is a true and living God, 




ELDER NICHOLAS G. SMITH 139 

has body, parts, and passions? Which one of them dares stand up 
and declare that we copied it from them? 

Which one of the sects dare say today that we copied the Word 
of Wisdom from them? I pray you, which one did we copy it from? 
And yet today we find it taking hold of other sects. One church 
has adopted it in toto. They do not eat meat, use coffee, or liquor, 
or tobacco, they have taken the word of wisdom over completely, 
and where did they get it? We did not copy it from them; no; it was 
given by God himself to his prophet. 

And so it is with many others of the beautiful principles of 
the gospel of Jesus Christ. Who taught us to believe in a preexistent 
state? And yet they are coming to that. Which one of them did we 
copy the law of tithing from? And yet they have found it of such 
importance that they sent a minister here to study the system, right 
here in Salt Lake City among the Latter-day Saints, to see whether 
it might lie adopted by the Methodist Church. I had a Church of 
England minister tell me that he really believed that we must have 
a personal God, that he must be a God with body, parts and passions. 
They are beginning to come to it. We took it from none of them. We 
had it, we got it from God. It was revealed from him to his prophet 
here on earth. 

And, brethren and sisters, we who have these blessings, how we 
should value them, and how we should strive to live up to the gospel 
of Jesus Christ! Every blessing that existed in the days of old is ours. 
If we will have it we have but to cultivate our faith to that end. I tell 
you that I know that he has the power to raise the dead, to heal 
the leper, to cleanse all who are impure, if they will but listen to his 
purifying gospel and have faith in him. 

You think it was an exceptional miracle when, after crossing the 
sea, ihe Savior with his disciples came upon one who was a maniac, and 
cast the devils out of him, but it was not ; it is sometning that is 
occuring all the times. It was my privilege, in company with Elder 
June B. Sharp, of this city, to go into an asylum down in the city of 
Cape Town, and there we found a woman insane, whose husband 
had heard of the Latter-day Saints and who had written and asked 
if we would visit her. We went there, and they told us that she was 
mad, and they took us into her presence, and we saw from her eyes 
that she was possessed, and I said to Elder Sharp, "She is possessed 
of an evil spirit ; we will rebuke it." And we bowed our heads, and by 
virtue of the Holy Priesthood in us vested, we commanded that he 
come out of her and leave her. And from that instant, she was healed. 
We went away from the asylum, and a day or two later, Elder Sharp 
lefi for home. I was going down a week later to see how she was 
getting on. I met one of the nurses and she said, "Why, she has gone 
home ; after you men were here the other day, she suddenly regained 
her senses, and after we watched her for about a week, we released 
her, and she has gone back up to her home." We heard no more 



140

about her for about six months, when one of our elders, traveling 
without purse or scrip, from Bloemfontein down to East London, 
stopped and held a cottage meeting in Queenstown, and a strange 
woman stood up in the cottage meeting and said. "I feel that I must 
bear my testimony to what these men have been saying. I tell you that 
I was mad, insane, and two of these men came into the insane 
asylum, and by die power which they said they had, they rebuked in 
the name of Jesus Christ the evil spirits which they declared possessed 
me, and from that instant I was another woman; I was cured abso- 
lutely.'' 

I know, my brethren and sisters, that God is watching over his 
people, but I wonder at times if we are reaching out to him. Why, our 
faith is right, we can have encircling that great temple before us 
a pillar of fire by night and a cloud by day, to be the wonder of all 
the people of the world who come here to this block to hear of 
"Mormonism" and the gospel of Jesus Christ. They do wonder when 
they come here. But if our faith is right, and if we will have it, 
I tell you we. can place around that temple, a pillar of fire, which will 
cause the nations of the earth to look up and come here in millions 
to visit us, instead of in hundreds of thousands. Brethren and sisters, 
let us live the gospel of Jesus Christ. Let us do our part and support 
the authorities of the Church. And if we will live the gospel, as one 
of the apostles declared at our conference session the other day; if 
we live the gospel, we will not need to be worrying about debts; 
we will be out of debt. God help us to do it; God bless us each and 
every one, is my prayer. Amen. 



ELDER DAVID A. SMITH 

(Of the Presiding Bishopric) 

I have been thinking while these brethren have been talking to 
you, "What was it that caused President Shepherd to leave his home 
and his business and all that he had and move to Logan to take charge 
of that Temple when requested to do so by the presidency of this 
Church? What was it that caused Brother Lambert to leave his busi- 
ness, his home, and all that he had to go down to the South Sea Islands 
to preside over a Mission there and take the gospel to the natives? 
What was it that kept Brother Nicholas G. Smith in South Africa for 
eight years? — all at their own expense and personal sacrifice as far as 
this world's goods are concerned. Was it not faith in God and a desire 
to be worthy of his blessings ? 

I have been wonderfully impressed with the remarks that have 
been made, especially the remarks of President Shepherd, whose life's 
work is to labor in the temple. 

Two or three weeks ago I stood at the east end of the Tabernacle 



ELDER DAVID A. SMITH 



141 



with a body of men who held the office of bishop in the Church to 
which they belonged, and who are, I believe, sincere, men who are 
endeavoring to better the condition of their fellowmen; one of them 
turned to me and said, "Bishop Smith, what do you do in the temple?" 

I answered, "We baptize for the dead ; we perform the marriage 
ceremony." 

"Baptize for the dead?" said he — "baptize for the dead? Why do 
you baptize for the dead?" 

Here another one said, "Don't you remember? They did that 
anciently. In I Corinthians, 15, Paul calls attention to the fact that 
at that time they were baptizing for the dead." 

Now, I want you, my brethren and sisters, to try and get the 
spirit of this work at this time. Cast your eyes upon that building, you 
will see that the architect has tried to interpret the word of God in the 
decorations on the building; for, carved in the stone windows, you 
will see symbols of the sun, and the moon and the stars. What does it 
mean? It means that we believe in the words of the Savior, "Let not 
your heart be troubled ; ye believe in God, believe also in me. In my 
Father's house are many mansions ; if it were not so, I would have told 
you. I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place: 
for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself ; that where I 
am, there ye may be also." (John 14: 1, 2, 3.) And Paul gives us 
more light. "There are also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial ; but 
the glory of the celestial is one, and the glory of the terrestrial is an- 
other. So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corrup- 
tion ; it is raised in incorruption :" (I Corinthians 15 :40, 42.) 

We are told in the Doctrine and Covenants (Sec. 76: 50-57), 
that to receive an exaltation in the celestial kingdom is not possible 
except through the Priesthood and through faithful observance of all 
the laws and ordinances of God. Every one of God's children who come 
to this earth are entitled to everlasting life. "Verily, verily, I say unto 
you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice 
of the Son of God ; and they that hear shall live. * * * And shall come 
forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and) 
they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation." (John 
5:25, 29.) But where is that existence to be? Those who are faithful 
in all things will be saved in the celestial kingdom, where God dwells 
and rules. Those who have not been faithful in all things, but have 
fallen short, will be saved in the terrestrial kingdom, the kingdom which 
is presided over by Jesus Christ, his Son. Those who have chosen to go 
their own way and have failed to keep the commandments of God, in 
so far as it has been their privilege to know them, must be content to 
receive their salvation in the next world, in the terrestrial kingdom, 
which is ministered to by angels. "And they shall be servants of the 
Most High, but where God and Christ dwell they cannot come, worlds 
without end." (Doctrine and Covenants 76: 112.) 

Now it is for us to choose ; it is for us to labor diligently, or go 



142 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



our way as it pleases us to do, and receive in God's kingdom the reward 
that we merit. 

Why do we baptize for the dead? Because God is a just God, and 
the same law that applies to me applies to you. The same requirements 
are made of you that are made of me ; I must do the same things that 
you must do, to receive the glory that God has promised unto me 
and unto you. There are many who. have not had the privilege of hear- 
ing the gospel; there are many who do not know what God's plan is. 
There were many anciently. Jesus the Christ, after his. death, went to 
bring the gospel to those who were in prison. "By which also he 
went and preached unto the spirits in prison ; which sometime 
were disobedient, when once the long suffering of God waited in the 
days of Noah, while the ark was a preparing, wherein few. that is, eight 
souls were saved by water. The like figure whereunto even baptism 
doth also now save us (not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, 
but the answer of a good conscience toward God, bv the resurrection 
of Jesus Christ." (I Peter 3 :19, 20, 21.) And so all men will have the 
privilege of hearing God's word ; they will have the privilege of select- 
ing and choosing for themselves what their final reward will be. 
Baptism, being an ordinance that can only be performed in this life, 
must be performed by some mortal being in this life, which, if accepted 
by the person for whom it is done, will have the same effect as if 
done personally. 

Why are we hunting for our genealogies? Why are we seeking 
to know who our ancestors are? Why does the spirit of this come 
upon us? Because we have that promise that came to the Prophet 
Joseph Smith, which promise President Grant read the other day : 
"Behold I will reveal unto you the Priesthood, by the hand of Elijah 
the prophet, before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the 
Lord ; and he shall plant in the hearts of the children the promises 
made to their fathers, and the hearts of the chidren shall turn to their 
fathers ; if it were not so, the whole earth would be utterly wasted at 
its coming." (Section 2, Doctrine and Covenants.) 

The fact that we have the desire and are being baptized for our dead 
by the thousands, should be an evidence to us that Elijah has come in 
this day, as testified to by the Prophet Joseph Smith and Oliver 
Cowdery: "After this vision had closed, another great and glorious 
vision burst upon us, for Elijah the prophet, who was taken to heaven 
without tasting death, stood before us, and said — Behold, the time has 
fully come, which was spoken of by the mouth of Malachi, testifying 
that he (Elijah) shoud be sent before the great and dreadful day 
of the Lord come, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and 
(he children to the fathers, lest the whole earth be smitten with a 
curse. Therefore the keys of this dispensation are committed into.vour 
hands, and by this ye may know that the great and dreadful day of the 
Lord is near, even at the doors." (Doctrine and Covenants 110: 13-16) 
In this temple they are taking- through hundreds of people every day,

; 

performing that work, in order that those of their kinsmen who have 
gone, not knowing the laws of the Lord, should have the privilege, 
after having heard it, of accepting the gospel and receiving the bless- 
ings God has promised unto them. 

Now, my brethren and sisters, I know that you have the spirit of 
this work, the most important work that we have to do. And I again 
voice the sentiment of Brother Shepherd ; let us look to our own homes ; 
are we faithful, worthy, diligent, in doing that which we are called to 
do ? Are we teaching our children and bringing them up in faith before 
God? Are they looking forward to the time when they can go into that 
house and prepare to receive the blessings of God? I want to tell you 
that those of us who> have not been doing so are forfeiting our right 
to the blessings and must be content with our salvation in a lesser 
degree of glory than that where God dwells. 

I humbly pray that the spirit of this great work will rest upon us, 
that we will go forward with all our might, with all our strength, 
humbly praying that God will help us to carry on the work required of 
us, his children. God bless us to this end, I pray, in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 

The congregation sang, "We thank thee, O God, for a prophet," 
and the benediction was pronounced by Patriarch William Jex, of 
the Nebo stake. 



THIRD OVERFLOW MEETING 

A third overflow meeting was held in the Assembly Hall, 
Sunday afternoon, at 2 o'clock, October 9, 1921. Elder George 
Albert Smith of the Twelve presided. The music was furnished 
by the Cottonwood ward choir, Cottonwood stake; instrumental 
music by an orchestra conducted by Adelbert Beesley. 

The choir sang an anthem, "In our Redeemer's name." 

Prayer was offered by Elder Lawrence Fullmer. 

Ada McDonald and the choir sang "Inflammatus." 

ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH 

T am sure it will interest you all to know that a cable has just been 
received from Calcutta, India, informing us that Brothers David O. 
McKay and Hugh J. Cannon have arrived there safely on their tour 
around the world to visit missions.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



ELDER BENJAMIN GODDARD 

(In charge, for many years, of the Bureau of Information) 

I sincerely trust, my brethren and sisters, that I may not only 
have your attention, but your faith and prayers. The last few days 
I have not been strong, but I feel that through your faith and sup- 
plications to the Lord he will aid me in performing this task that has 
been assigned to me. 

It is my privilege, day by day, to meet many thousands of people 
who are coming from all parts of the world; and while we sat 
in the tabernacle this morning, I observed some distinguished rep- 
representatives from foreign countries. I watched them, as they gazed 
steadfastly over that vast congregation, and observed that they listened 
very intently to the inspiring remarks that were made by the speakers. 
I felt in my soul that they must have been impressed with the won- 
derful faith on the part of this people. They must have marveled at 
what they witnessed. 

I am convinced that there is more vitality in "Mormonism," more 
vigor and evidence of the rich outpouring of the Spirit of God, more 
demonstration of spiritual life than can be found among any other 
people that I know of. When our brethren spoke from the stand 
with such eloquence, such power, inspired as by the Spirit of God, 
I felt that those fervent testimonies were not merely demonstrations 
of the ordinary intelligence of man ; but that their minds were quick- 
ened, their words were made eloquent, by the influence of the Spirit 
of Almighty God, and we had a spiritual feast. 

As I think upon this subject, I wonder if it occurs to any of 
our stranger friends, why there is so much vitality, so much in- 
spiration in "Mormonism;." I have thought of the wonderful revela- 
tions given to us of the Lord in the Doctrine and Covenants, Pearl 
of Great Price, and Book of Mormon, I have begun to realize why 
there is this vitality, and why the Latter-day Saints ought to praise 
God that he has given unto us in these last days so many revelations 
of his will. I call the attention of the Latter-day Sainjts to this, 
and of course it is an old story. It is nevertheless true, and if in our 
family circles we could get our children around us a little more fre- 
quently, and tell them these old, old sitories, it would do a wonderful 
amount of good. We ought to go back to Holy Writ, with regard to 
the labors of the Master, the Lord Jesus Christ, the Redeemer of the 
world, and interprete his great mission for the benefit of our young 
people. We can testify also that we are living today in the dispensation 
of the fulness of times. Latter-day Saints realize that God has given 
to them many wonderful truths, and marvelous demonstrations of his 
power. 

We have taught to our children the actual manifestations of the 



ELDER BENJAMIN GODDARD 



145 



Father and the Son to the Prophet Joseph Smith, that God the Father 
and his Son Jesus Christ appeared to that young man at the inception 
of this work. But we want to tell them the story, time and time again, 
in such a way that they will feel impressed with the truth of it, that 
they will realize that what we tell them we feel in our souls and be- 
lieve it to be true. We remember the wonderful manifestations given 
to the Prophet Joseph. Smith through the angel Moroni, of his appear- ' 
ing and giving to us, through that young prophet, this sacred record, 
the Book of Mormon. We realize how we have received the Aaronic 
Priesthhod through the ministration of John the Baptist, and received 
the Melchizedek Priesthood through the ministrations of Peter 
James, and John to the prophet Joseph Smith, And then as we tell 
the story of these wonderful events in Church history unjto our 
children, they will realize that this is a "marvelous work and a won- 
der," established by remarkable revelations of God's power, and they 
certainly will realize that we have abiding faith in these things. I 
believe that Moroni, an ancient prophet who lived on this continent, 
appeared unto the Prophet Joseph Smith, and to this we are indebted, 
for the Book of Mormon, the word of God containing the fulness of 
the gospel, and we are inspired by its teachings. 

I believe that that which is stated in the 13th section of the Doc- 
trine and Covenants actually took place; that John the Baptist, who 
held the authority anciently, actually appeared before Joseph Smith and 
Oliver Cowdery, and bestowed upon them the authority of the Aaronic 
Priesthood; and then, as recorded in section 27, Peter, James, and 
John came with the greater power, giving them the keys of that 
authority and bestowing upon them the Melchizedek Priesthood, we 
bear testimony to these truths, and we exhort our people to study 
these sacred volumes. God has done well for us. He has fulfilled his 
promise. He has caused his word to go forth with power unto the 
nations of the earth. He has blessed our elders who have labored 
in the various mission fields, and today upon the temple block there 
are tens of thousands who have been gathered from the nations (or 
their parents, perhaps), and have been brought to these beautiful 
valleys by the preaching of the gospel to the nations of the earth. Now 
all these things we believe in. You believe in them, I know, just as 
fervently as I do. But God has so blessed us, and so wonderfully in- 
spired our prophets to give us demonstrations of his power, that 
it has placed upon us obligations greater than ever to him. He expects 
more from us than from any other people that ever lived in the 
wide world. 

In the days of the Savior very few were brought to the knowledge 
cf the gospel. In this day thousands upon thousands have been brought 
to the knowledge of that same gospel and into the fold of his Church 
through the ministrations of humble elders going forth in weakness, 
and often unqualified for the labor, but they have had the authority 
of the Holy Priesthood and (by virtue of that God has blessed their 



146 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



labors, and they have convinced the honest in heart and brought many 
to a knowledge of the truth ; and now, in all the nations of the earth, 
they are saying, "Come, let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, 
to the house of the God of Jacob, and he will teach us of his ways, 
and we will walk in his paths." By virtue of this, God's people have 
been gathered in this dispensation. 

Now, in view of these great blessings, what manner of men and 
women should we be? Should we not make our lives conform to the 
teaching of this great work? The strangers here, our neighbors 
surrounding us, know not the truths we believe in and what lives we 
are supposed to live. I wonder if. by our consistent labor, |by the 
righteousness of our conduct, we are bearing testimony, day by day, 
that we are really inspired of God? 

There comes to my mind one instance where wonderful results 
came from faithful and consistent living. I love our presiding officer 
here, Brother George Albert Smith, as I love very few men here on 
earth ; but I loved his, father, I believe, as much as I can ever love him. 
Let me give you an instance in his life. Many years ago, in the early 
morning before many had eaten breakfast, several people came into 
the Bureau in almost a blustering manner, they evidently were, "hail 
fellows well met." One of them, approaching me said, "Can you tell 
me if John Henry is in town?" Sometimes such familiarity with the 
names of our leaders is objectionable, but his manner was such that I 
could not take exception to it. I asked, "Who do you mean?" He re- 
plied, "John Henry Smith." I answered that I thought he was at home, 
and accordingly I telephoned him. President John Henry Smith asked, 
"What do you want, Brother Goddard ; I am just getting up, just 
shaving." I said, "I scarcely know, tout there is a gentleman here who 
wants to see you." He asked his name, and I replied, "Mr. Case of 
Kansas." He promptly said, "Hold him right there until I can come." 
I detained the gentleman, conversed with him and found he was a 
very prominent official of the Irrigation Congress, and that he and 
Brother Smith had been associated for many years. They had attended 
the Congress sessions, the banquets and other functions. Finally Presi- 
dent Smith came in. Have you ever observed Jolm Henry Smith when 
he was going up to an old friend, putting forth his arms and encir- 
cling his comrade with those arms? He did it with this particular 
visitor. He hugged him as if he had teen his own brother, and said, 
"1 am mighty jgJad you are here." The stranger seemed equally 
affectionate toward President Smith. A few years later this visitor 
came a second time, and as he and his party came in, he remarked, 
''Mr. Goddard, I want you to meet my son." He continued, "I want 
to tell you w r hy I love John Henry Smith. All his associates know he 
is a 'Mormon,' that he stands by his convictions, that he is sincere, 
that he believes in all that he says. This boy of mine was with me 
at a banquet we attended some time ago in Kansas City. At the table 
] placed the boy near John Henry Smith, and I sat a little further 



ELDER BENJAMIN GODDARD 



147 



away. I knew what was going to happen. I knew what Mr. Smith 
would do. When he sat at the table he very quietly and without 
ostentation took his glass and placed it upside down. Oh, I tell you- 
I watched this boy. I wanted to know how my boy was going to be 
impressed with that example ; and when I saw him at John Henry's 
left hand take up the glass that was before him and turn it upside 
down, as an indication that he wanted neither wine nor champagne, 
nor any other kind of liquor, I felt to thank God for the influence 
that John Henry had upon him." 

We shed tears together, as we were talking over some of these 
circumstances. This incident impressed upon me the necessity of living 
an upright and consistent life, that we believe in and fully sense what 
we profess, and that we are endeavoring to live in accordance there- 
with. 

I had the privilege, a few days ago, of meeting a very large 
number of representatives from the Eastern states, and as we stood 
under the shadow of the temple they asked many questions regarding 
that sacred edifice, and just what it stands for. I explained the gospel 
principles, with regard to pur own salvation anl exaltation, and the 
salvation of our dead, the unselfish labors performed in the temple and 
the baptisms for the dead, how the Saints labor therein for their 
ancestors, as far back as they can trace their genealogies. I felt that 
they were impressed with what the Latter-day Saints are doing and 
with the breadth of the revealed plan of salvation. While we were 
thus conversing the east gate opened and a large number of people 
passed in carrying their valises and going to the temple. "What are 
they going to do?" was the query. I dwelt at some length upon the 
devotion of the people who were going to be baptized for their 
ancestry, in the faith and belief that when the gospel is preached behind 
the veil unto the dead, they may have the blessings pertaining to that 
holy ordinance. Many expressed their deep interest in these and other 
truths expounded to them:. About a year ago a young lady came to the 
Bureau and in an earnest and intelligent manner, investigated the 
gospel ; ultimately after months of prayerful study she applied for 
baptism-. Soon afterwards she secured volumes on genealogy and 
learned that her family was linked up for centuries with some great 
characters known in American history. One of these volumes was 
loaned to me, and I took note of a stanza that impressed me as hav- 
ing a lesson for the Latter-day Saints generally. I submit it to you 
in conclusion, and trust that we may be alive to the responsibilities God 
has placed upon us : 

r 

If you could see your ancestors 

All standing in a row. 
Would you be proud of them, or not,

Some strange discoveries are made 

In climbing family trees,

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



And some of them you know, do not 
Particularly please. 

If you could see your ancestors, 

All standing in a row, 
There might be some of them, perhaps, 

You wouldn't care to know; 
But here's another question, which 

Requires a different view, 
If you could meet your ancestors, 

Would they be proud of you? 

[ 

I submit to you, that the work now being done in the temples for 
our ancestors will cause thousands upon thousands to be proud of these 
who perform the work, and eternal blessings will be received for the 
•diligent performance of these labors, tout the Lord have mercy upon 
those who neglect this sacred duty. 

May God give us a full appreciation of his Work and an intelligent 
comprehension of it, that we may all merit and receive the Spirit to 
enable us to labor for the accomplishment of his purposes, and that we 
may labor zealously for the salvation of our families and our kindred 
that have passed away. I ask it in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER JOSEPH H. DYE 

{President of the Shelley Stake of Zion, Idaho) 

I trust, my brethren and sisters, that while speaking to you I may 
enjoy the spirit that has prevailed during this conference. I would not 
like to occupy this position without it being of some benefit to you as 
well as to myself. I feel that time is very valuabe, that you have come 
here to be blessed of the Spirit of the Lord, and that ycu should re- 
ceive that blessing in your gathering. 

Brother Goddard referred to the spiritual part of our religion, 
the inspiration which directs this people. I want to> bear my testimony, 
as one of the humble servants of the Lord, that in my ministry have 
I noticed this inspiration upon the brethren who are somewhat far 
from the center stake of Zion. The instructions that are given in this 
conference come very forcibly to my mind, something that I valued two 
months ago. I have noticed that on other occasions when there have 
been special instructions given to us as a people, they have come to 
us in our stakes as an inspiration from the Lord. I do not speak of 
this with any praise to myself, but I speak of it to show to you, that 
it is a testimony to me that the Spirit of the Lord is permeating this 
great assembly, and that its influences extend throughout the length 
and breadth of this great land of ours, where the people are worthy 
to receive it ; and I think that under the influence of this Holy Spirit 
we are bound to succeed, especially if we put into practice that which 
we are taught. 



ELDER JOSEPH H. D'YE 



149 



One of the ancient apostles in teaching the people in his time made 
a statement like this : "Today is the day of salvation for you" ; and I 
have had a thought during this conference, and from the report of the 
instructions given that will go out among the people, and especially 
when these thoughts go out to the young people, that today is your day 
of salvation; today is the day that the Lord has given you to prepare 
not only for life in the future, but to prepare for this life, in order 
that you may have the blessings here as well as hereafter. 

For illustration, where is there a greater blessing than health to 
our people, to any people ? Without health we are helpless. We are of 
very little use unless we have health and strength, and the Lord has told 
us how to obtain that health and strength. Yet many of our own people 
do not cherish these words of the Lord as they should do, because 
they are breaking these laws of health and depriving themselves 
of the blessings that they might enjoy. Is not today the day of salva- 
tion for these young people? Certainly it is — not to wait till they get 
old for their salvation, going on in a reckless way, being out late at 
nights, using those things which are forbidden, as they grow older they 
will realize this, but this opportunity will be gone. The period) of youth 
will have passed, and opportunity neglected, and the result is they have 
lost that salvation that they could have secured. 

"Of all sad words of tongue or pen, 

The saddest are these, it might have been." 

I often think of our young people as well as many of our older 
ones, that they will see the day when they will look back and sigh 
for that which might have been. And where we have neglected to take 
advantage of these opportunities, that, sometime, either in this life 
or the hereafter we will think what we have missed, and then these 
words will come forcibly to us, "The saddest are these, it might have 
been." 

Many times our young boys, and older ones too, have had a chance 
to receive the Priesthood, one of the greatest opportunities that can 
come to a mortal man ; and yet many of them would prefer, perhaps, 
some of the things they cherished in the flesh, such as the use of 
tobacco, the pleasures of the world. They would rather have them than 
receive the Priesthood. And it strikes me, O what are we doing as 
members of the Church when we take such a course, when we fail to 
receive the things that are of greater value unto us, both here and 
hereafter. Will there not come a time of reckoning and is not today the 
day of salvation to us ? A time to prepare not only for this lifq but for 
the life to come? 

I read here in the Doctrine and Covenants, that those who 
receive these two Priesthoods (the Aaronic Priesthood and the Mel- 
chizedek Priesthood) become joint heirs with God the Father 
and with his son Jesus Christ, and that all the blessings that they 
have to give are theirs, inasmuch as they receive these two Priesthoods 



150 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



and remain faithful to them. O what a blessing to become joint heirs 
of God with his Son Jesus Christ in all these glorious things. 
That is further than eternity, and yet those blessings are within our 
reach if we will take the opportunity that is presented to us. So again, 
let. me say, today is the day of salvation, for you and for me, and we 
should not neglect these things, and should not have to look back and 
say — 

"Of all sad words of tongue or pen, 

The saddest are these, it might have been." 

I see a few young people here hefore me this afternoon. I wish 
there were more, because I love to speak to the young people, because 
they are the people whose course I feel we should direct. The young 
people sometimes give way to pleasures that suround them, the en- 
vironments which are about them ; they partake of them more or less, 
and they do not think, I feel, as seriously of the gospel and of the 
future as they should do. There comes a period 1 in their lives when they 
want to get married, and we do not blame them for wanting to be 
married. If there is anything that I despise, in the walks of life, it is 
the old bachelor or the old maid. And so I think that our boys and 
girls should have this opportunity when young, especially when they 
are married in the right way, and that is coming to the temples which 
have been provided where they may be sealed together for time and 
for all eternity. Now, for illustration, we will say, here are two boys 
raised in the same community, taught by good parents. One of them, 
when the opportunity comes, goes to the temple, as all good boys 
should go, and there he receives his companion for time and eternity. 
The other thinks, "Well, I believe I will be married by the justice 
of the peace, or by my bishop. What a difference between those two' 
marriages! Don't you see at once that one is cutting himself off from 
the salvation, the glory, that he might attain to? I imagine that I 
can see these two young boys with their wives, as time goes on, one 
going" into eternal glory and eternal lives, the other deprived of those 
blessings, because he has neglected those privileges he had while in 
the flesh. What will it be to that young man? Is not today his oppor- 
tunity for salvation, is not today the day to prepare for salvation, not 
only in this life but in the life to come? I certainly think it is; and, 
should they neglect this opportunity, when they go to the other side 
they will look back and regret the course they have taken ; or, on the 
other hand, be glad that they had the opportunity and improved it in 
this life, for salvation in this life and also in the life to come. 

I rejoice that this Church calls us all into the service, gives us all 
a chance to receive the blessings of the Lord, and if we neglected it, we 
deprive ourselves of the blessings of the Lord. In one of the beautiful 
hymns in our hymn book, Sister Eliza R. Snow says, and we so often 
sing: 



ELDER THOMAS X . TAYLOR 



15-1 



For a wise and glorious purpose 

Thou hast placed me here on earth, 
And withheld the recollection 

Of my former friends and birth. 

W.e came to this world for a wise and glorious purpose for which 
God sent us here. We should take advantage of the opportunity. 

May the Lord bless us, and help us to realize our advantages in this 
life, and by improving our opportunities maj we realize his blessings, 
I ask in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER THOMAS N. TAYLOR 

(President of the Utah Stake of '/.ion) 

• My brethren and sisters, indeed T feel the great responsibility of 
attempting to address you here this afternoon. I realize, perhaps, that 
many of you have come from long distances, in order to be fed the 
bread of life, and I pray God the eternal Father that he will inspire 
me that some thought may be left with you that perhaps will stimulate 
you to go ahead and do the things that you ought to do and that we all 
ought to do. 

I rejoiced very much in hearing Brother Goddard refer to that 
universal lover of the Church, Apostle John Henry Smith. Most of us 
have in our lives some dark days, some days of trial, some days when 
we feel that we can hardly stand the load that we have to bear, and 
when we have had the privilege of having a man so full of faith, so 
full of love, of humanity, as to throw his arm around us and give us 
an embrace that we need, we love to think of his memory. There is 
no reason why he should not have been loved as he was loved through- 
out this whole community, and more. It is a beautiful thing to be a 
universal lover of men, and be loved for good deeds. He was a wonder- 
ful example, a powerful man, who could exercise forbearance towards 
his fellow men. 

This conference to me has been a very unusual one, a very 
inspiring one. One of the brethren, excusing himself from coming 
up to conference, said, "I dislike having to be excused from going to 
conference, because everyone feels that each conference is just a 
little better than the one before. I feel that inspiration has come to 
everyone of us. I feel that the Lord has answered the prayers of 
his people in this conference. I feel what a splendid thing it is that 
the temporal things of life can be so beautifully blended in the spirit- 
ual things of life, and that the two can be considered and appreciated 
together. 

Since coming to this house, I have been reminded of one of the 
most remarkable things that ever came to my attention. I shall take 
the liberty of telling the story, one that is coupled with the building 
of this assembly hall. It entered into the life of a boy friend of mine, 
whose parents had come from the old world. His mother was a member 



152 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



of the Church, but his father was not. His father was very much in 
love with his mother, and felt she would be happier if she gathered 
with her people. They came and settled in this city, with the under- 
standing that if the mother ever became dissatisfied they would 
return, and with that understanding the father had made provisions 
that they should go back. They had not been here long before they 
met with a very sad misfortune ; the little home they had was burned 
down, and all they had was destroyed. The boy got work on this 
block, helping with this building during its erection, running errands 
here and there for his first month. I remember for that period he 
received $16 on the old tithing office in this city. He went home with 
that order. The first thing his father said was, "Have you paid 
your tithing on that, my son?" The lad said, "No, I have worked 
pretty hard for that and I don't propose to pay any part of it." The 
father asked, "How do the people get the money to build that as- 
sembly hall?" He said, "I don't know how they get it, but I have 
worked pretty hard for this $16, and I don't propose to give any of 
it up." The father took him by the hand, and said : "I am not a member 
of the Church that you have seen fit to be baptized into. I have not 
been able to understand their principles to such an extent that I 
have felt like joining it, but' 1 want to ask you a few questions: Am 
I rearing a boy who would try, if they had a little sociable, to climb 
through a window, or climb under a tent? Am I rearing a boy who 
would avoid paying his obligations as a man? I want to say to you, 
as long as you are a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints, I want you to be an honorable man, and I want you to 
pay your tithing on that month's earnings. Ten per cent of that 
should be paid to the Church, in order that they may build such 
buildings as you are working on. I want you, my boy, to be honest. 
Before there is anything done with that order, I want you to go to 
your bishop and pay to him, who has the collection of these things, 
the amount that he is entitled to." 

Why, you s|ay, that hasn't very much to do with the spiritual 
development of that man. Do you know what it has done for him ? He 
has grown up in this community, and he is now one of the most 
honored in this community, a man whose integrity and whose honor 
never has been and can never be questioned, a man full of devotion 
and integrity; and wh|at started him? Suppose his father had been a 
little careless, suppose his father had decided, "Why, we have had a 
great misfortune. I don't think they need what little you have worked 
for?" What effect would that have had? I don't think there has ever 
been a dollar in his hands, from that time until this, that he 
has not paid a tithing on. I thank God for my privilege of being as- 
sociated with him. I thank God for the instructions given by that 
father, although he was not able to see all the truth of this work. O, 
I have wondered so many times, how many fathers and mothers in 
Israel have embraced the gospel of Christ, who have known how to 
teach their children what it means to live the gospel. Many, so many, 
of us like to consider the law of tithing, to construe that law, more or 



ELDER THOMAS N. TAYLOR 



153 



less as a voluntary donation because we do not have to give quite so 
much. 

I remember one man in the ward where I had occasion to labor 
in the bishopric; I went through the questions with him, "Shall I 
mark this as a full tithing?" "Yes, I think you'd better mark it full," 
he replied, "I h^ve been in the habit of paying about that much, and 
I think you'd better mark it in full." I said, "Is it in full?" He said, 
"Yes, I think you'd better mark, in full." "Well," said I, "I am a 
little afraid you don't understand the law of tithing?" "Well," he 
answered, "I think you'd better mark it in full; I think it is all I 
can afford this ye|ar." I simply want to call your attention to this, 
that you cannot compromise; the laws of God must be lived up to 
in one thing as well as another, and when you come to construe them 
to suit yourself, your own convenience, you are shutting out yourself 
from the blessings that you ought to enjoy, from the full love that 
comes to a man who does his duty and keeps the commandments of 
God, the blessings that, I feel, have come to that boy. 

Are we kind to our boys? Are you kind to your boys? Do we get 
them around us at night, and tell them such things as I have told you, 
teach them the truth, and show them what is right? Do we try to 
encourage them to read the biographies of men who have conducted 
their lives in conformity with this work? If we do, we are having 
a family circle th|at is very enjoyable. If we are talking to them of 
family prayer ; if we are talking to the boys or girls, and say, We are 
talking to our Father in heaven. How many of you have called on 
your little boy or girl, and said, "Will you lead us in prayer to-night? 
The tears almost come to your eyes to hear a little child ask the Lord 
to bless some one near to their heart, to bless Brother Smith who is 
sick, bless my little companion, make him well, Father, that we may 
play together." Is that prayer worth anything to hear from your 
little boy? 

I beseech of you, my brethren and sisters, to encourage it. I be- 
seech of you to teach your children correct principles. Teach them 
the laws of God ; teach them that he has revealed those laws for 
their development and for the building up of his Church and kingdom. 
Of course, that is a very important thing, but the great thing in 
their lives is to teach them obedience to the laws and ordinances of 
the gospel of Jesus Christ, those means that are absolutely necessary 
in order to come into God's Church, and these are the things that 
are absolutely necessary to come into their lives that they may be 
strengthened and developed and prepared to meet their neighbors as 
they live here, and to meet eternal beings and exaltation in the here- 
after. 

I wonder how many of you, mothers, are kind to your girls ! I 
wonder how many mothers are able to set aside some of the affairs of 
life, to take a few minutes to talk to their girls. How many fathers 
are willing to put their arms around them, and ask them what their 
troubles are? Do you encourage that confidence, do you make the 



154 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Wjay open and pleasant that they can come and talk to you ? You know 
sometimes we get in the habit of kissing our boys and girls. I don't 
know, but I feel it is a very sweet ending of the day when one of my 
boys or girls comes to me at night and gives me a good-night kiss. O 
what it is to encourage these young people that God has blessed us 
with and placed in our hands to raise. 

A very unfortunate thing occurred once in my experience of 
some 28 years in the bishopric in the ward where I lived. A beautiful 
young lady came to the house one night, and she said : "Bishop, 1 
would like to go to the temple." It has been my habit to talk to boys 
and girls when they are going to the temple, and try to impress 
upon them the importance of that great principle that has come into 
their lives, and offer to them, if possible, words of encouragement. 
This young lady, after carefully questioning her as to whether her 
life was such that she felt that she could go to the house of the 
Lord and receive the sacred blessings that are given there, broke 
down and began to cry. I said, "My girl, what is the matter ?" She 
sobbed. I said, "Can't you tell me what is the matter?" I said, "Does 
your mother know of your trouble?" She said, "No, I can't tell her, 
it would kill mo'her." I said. "You have told me, and I am almost 
a stranger to you." She said, "Yes, but I can't tell mother." I said, 
"Is it possible that your mother is not close enough, that she is 
not the one to go to with all your troubles?" She said, "I can't tell 
my mother." I said, "Yes, I will tell your mother." She said, "Don't.' 
I ,said, "Yes, I will." I said, "You go and tell your mother, and then 
come and tell me." She came back to see me the next day. The 
mother, a very proud, demanding woman, came and asked me why 
I talked to her daughter as I had talked. I bad her sit down, and 
I told her the story. She started to fly at the girl. I said, "One 
moment, if there is ever a time in her life that she needs a mother, 
needs the sweet influence of a mother, it is now. Now, I pray you, 
not one harsh word to that beautiful girl, whatever you do, and 
whatever she has been doing. I am not criticising you before your 
girl, but I pray you, put your arms around that girl, and make her 
life sweet and wholesome." I was very happy to meet her a year 
or two afterward. 

It is only one of the things that come up. And while we are 
criticising our boys and girls, I want to ask the parents in all sin- 
cerity, in all the fervor of my soul, are we doing our part? Are we 
able to say we are doing what we ought to do? If we are, then God 
will help us. Sorrows and trials will come, we- cannot stop them. But 
let us remember the beautiful things we have heard during this 
conference. O God, help us to live for the things that we know 
are true. Let us stand true to the obligations that we have entered 
into, I ask in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 



ELDER JAMES GUNN MCKAY

ELDER JAMES GUNN McKAY 

{Recent President of the Combined London, Norwich and Bristol 

Conferences) 

My brethren and sisters, I am very glad! to ibe with - you here in 
conference. I am happy to feel the inspiration that is attending 
this conference, and know that God is attending this people. I know 
that from the bottom of my heart. I know that from all the experience 
that I have had in this Church. There are no doubts in my mind 
concerning this fact, that this is God's church, and that he is guiding 
its destiny, not only its destiny but its officers, and what they teach 
and direct his people. 

When called to the British mission I had occasion to find out 
that its late president, Hyrum M. Smith, was a chosen vessel of the 
Lord to preside over that mission, when the great war broke out, well 
nigh .engulfing all the European missions, I know of no man among 
all the authorities of the Church that could have stood against that 
great wave of excitement .and held those missions together, as well 
as that great son of God, Hyrum M. Smith. He stood as a stone wall 
against the excitement and the fears of the Saints and the elders. 
AVhen the time came to close that mission he had the inspiration 
upon him. He was qualified although his difficulties were great, 
yet he was able to rise to every occasion. Soon the time came when 
those elders who were under his administration "were to be released, 
and we were pondering our hearts who was the one who should preside 
over the European mission to succeed President Smith. Soon the word 
came that Elder George F. Richards was to be appointed. I had 
occasion to say that God is guiding this Church, and whoever is 
appointed, that man is fitted for the time and place. In the course of 
time, President Richards came. He was the one who had to gather in 
the local people, and place them as presidents of branches and other 
officers. He was the man who was qualified, by his experience and his 
makeup and his care and caution, full of the inspiration of the Lord, 
to meet the conditions under which he was called to preside. Not 
only that. When he went about his duties, you could see as he went 
into a conference how the Spirit of the Lord rested upon him, and 
when he suggested a local man for a position that required experience 
and understanding, you could not have suggested a better man than 
he chose under those conditions and circumstances, and he could 
not have chosen a better man for that place. It shows quite well, 
that even this people are not guiding themselves, neither are their 
officers guiding this people through their reason, '{but they are re- 
ceiving inspiration, as they are entitled to, to lead this people. 

When President Richards was about to be released, of course 
all were excited. There weren't very many of us elders. We wondered 
who would be the man for that purpose. Well, when the cable came, 




156 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 

that President George Albert Smith was appointed, we knew at once 
that the way was opening for the missions to be rejuvenated again. 
There was no better man. And I want to say this, I may not be 
able to attend his funeral — he may live longer than I, so I am 
going to give him a few bouquets now. I believe in that. I don't 
know that corpses care very much for flowers. President George 
A. Smith came over there and under his training men among the 
nations of the earth were led. He was able to go among those 
officials, he was able to procure concessions and permits for the 
elders to come, because he was a man best qualified, in my judgment 
among all the authorities of the Church to preside over that great 
mission at that particular time. Look at the wonderful work that 
he accomplished. There were only a few elders there. The way seemed 
to be hedged up, and yet he came imbued with the inspiration of the 
Lord, and .was able to knock at the doors of the officials, to gain 
their confidence ; and eventually we obtained the privileges we 
wanted, that elders might come to take up their work and fulfil their 
missions in furthering the cause of God and accomplishing his work, 
and in that way he secured to us a testimony that God directs that 
work. 

There are some who ridicule and say our officers are appointed 
by the wisdom and favoritism of men. I want to tell you if there 
are such cases they are few in this Church. If a man is living as 
he should live, he is entitled to go before the Lord and ask him for 
what he needs, what knowledge he may desire, and the Lord will 
place it in his way. 

I remember on one occasion when President Smith came to Lon- 
don to appoint a new conference president. He had written to me 
. about the elders there, and finally he came ; and we met together 
to counsel over the matter. He said he thought so-and-so is the man, 
and you know that man's name had been in my mind ever since 
I had begun to pray about the matter. He had prayed also, and the 
Lord had designated to him the man who was to preside. That man 
was chosen, and he has made a wbnderful success, and is still 
there. I know the Lord does not make mistakes. 

My good father labored in the Southern states. When he was 
released, the President said, "You are now appointel to go to Scotland." 
My father said to himself, "A man should not he appointed to go on 
two missions without going home." So he went into the woods and 
praved, to learn if it was the mind and will of the Lord that he 
should go to Scotland 'before returning home. When he prayed the 
third time, the word of the Lord came to him, "The words of my 
seivants unto you are my words; do as they instruct you, and my 
blessings shall attend you." He made his way to New York and there 
met John Henry Smith. He said, "I am not prepared, Brother Smith, 
tf go. I havn't any means. I have been preaching in the south without 
purse or scrip." Brother Smith said. "Come with me." They went into 



ELDER JAMES GUNN MCKAY 



157 



a large mercantile house. He met the manager. The manager patted 
my father on the back, and said, "I want you to try on a new overcoat, 
that we have in the office." He said, "I haven't seen you before, but I 
want you to take that overcoat with my compliments." Father had 
been praying that his way should be opened up. His passage across 
the ocean was paid by strangers. So I say, we are not left alone. 
We are not left in doubt, and if any of you are left in Idoubt concern- 
ing the counsel of the authorities of this Church, and you will obtain 
his mind and will in no uncertain terms. Just as sure as the Latter-day 
Saints will seek God they will be guided aright, and they will know 
that the Lord has placed the right man in the right place. I know that 
God lives, and that I can approach him, and that I can receive 
answers from him, as I have done in many, many cases. Missionaries 
have a great many experiences which teach them these things. 

There was an elder who was sent for by two companions who 
were in trouble. He was running to catch the train, the station master 
saw him and held the door of the car open as the train left the station ; 
but as soon as this elder got to the door something said to him, "Don't 
go." He stopped. The station master said, "Why don't you go? You 
have run two or three blocks; you are the strangest men on earth, 
you 'Mormons', I don't know what is the matter with you. Why, you 
have come running down here out of breath, and just when you see 
your way clear to go on, you are not going." He said, "I know where 
you will end your days if you are not careful." The elder took the next 
train, and later that day he found that the train which he had refused 
to board had broken through a bridge and every soul had perished. 
Had he not listened to the inspiration of the Spirit of God, had he not 
been guided by a heavenly influence, he, too, would have been 
one of the victims. See how an elder may be guided by inspiration. 
God help us that we may feel that inspiration that is in his Church, 
and if we do not feel it, let us get in tune with it, for God is 
speaking unto his people, privately and otherwise ; and if you have 
not a testimony, seek him that you may obtain it, just like Samuel 
said when the Lord called him, "Samuel, Samuel," three times. Samuel 
arose and said, "Speak ; for thy servant heareth." The Lord is anxious 
>o speak to us through the means that he has. We need to be in 
communication individually with the Lord as well as with the author- 
ities of the Church, that we may have inspiration, that we may have 
the blessings and the gifts of God with us continually. 

It is well enough to read the story of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob ; 
but to sit at a table of spiritual feasting, to dine with the Lord on 
a few of the things that you know have come from heaven direct 
is worth all of the scriptures, valuable as the scripture may be; and 
if you have not had that, and if your testimony has not been added 
upon and added upon, I beseech you to turn that door that 1 Heaven may 
speak to you in your work and in your life, so that you will have 
hc doubt that God has established his Church never to be thrown down.

May we fulfil our covenant. May we feel this inspiration in our 
lives, for this is my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.. 

ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH 

I have rejoiced today, as I have during- the other days of 
our conference, in the Spirit of the Lord that has been poured 
out upon the people. It has been a time of feasting- to me, greet- 
ing my friends and looking into the faces of men and women 
who have come to wait upon the Lord. 

THE WORLD IGNORANT OF CONDITIONS CONFRONTING IT. 

I am thankful that we are not in doubt as to what the at- 
titude of our heavenly Father is toward his children, and I am 
thankful that those who have been called to address us in this 
conference have been inspired to tell us things that give us 
courage and hope. The people of this world, generally speak- 
ing, are not aware of the real condition that confronts them, but 
you have been advised of what awaits you. You have heeded 
the call and have partaken of the ordinances of the gospel and 
many of you have received a witness that your action is ap- 
proved of the Lord. The brethren who have addressed you this 
afternoon have borne testimony of the divinity of this work ; 
but the most important testimony to you, the most important 
testimony to me, is that individual witness that comes' to us 
that we have done well, and that we feel that our heavenly 
Father has approved our action. 

OUR RELIGIOUS BELIEF. 

We believe in God the eternal Father and in his Son, Jesus 
Christ, and in the Holy Ghost. That is not incomprehensible 
to us. It has been made plain to us, that these are the Godhead 
that we worship. We believe that our Redeemer has revealed 
himself to the children of men in the days that are past, that 
the Old and New Testaments contain his wise counsels, and in 
addition to that, we believe that he revealed himself to the people 
who dwelt on this Western continent after his resurrection. The 
Savior appeared and directed the organization of his Church 
in the western hemisphere, as he had done in the eastern hemi- 
sphere. We believe that our heavenly Father has spoken in our 
own day also, that he heard the humble prayer of a youth in 
Palmyra, and answered his prayer and blessed him with a knowl- 
edge of his personality, that all people might know the Lord, if 
they will.

NATURAL THAT THE PROPHET JOSEPH SHOULD SEEK THE LORD. 

It was a very natural thing that Joseph Smith should seek the 
Lord. He came of a race of people who believed in our heavenly 
Father, in the divine mission of the Savior, in the efficacy of 
prayer, and that Gbd would hear and answer his people if they 
went before him with a proper spirit. It was easy for this young 
man to believe, because he had been born and reared in a be- 
lieving household ; and when he went out into the woods in 
response to the injunction of the scripture (James 1:5): "If any 
of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men 
liberally, and upbraideth not ; and it shall be given him," he 
believed that his prayer would be answered, and our heavenly 
Father has promised his children from the beginning, that, "by 
faith ye may know all things." The result was that wonderful 
manifestation, unlike any other that we have ever heard of in 
the history of the world. We have heard of instances where our 
heavenly Father has manifested himself; we have read of in- 
stances where the Redeemer of mankind has manifested him- 
self; but we have never read of any instance where the Father 
and the Son before have appeared to any living being and have 
spoken to that individual. People of the world do not believe 
it. Men and women have been taught that the heavens are 
sealed. They have accepted the scripture because they have 
been taught that the Bible is the word of the Lord. Many of 
our Father's children have never given thought to the teach- 
ings of the Lord, and when this youth declared that in our day, 
at the very time when we needed light most of all, when men 
and women were running to and fro for the word of God and 
could not find it, as predicted by the old prophets, the Lord 
had manifested himself, he was ridiculed. Faith prompted Joseph 
to seek God in prayer and ask which church he should identify 
himself with. What was the response? Did the Lord say, "My 
boy, they are all good, they are all striving to keep my com- 
mandments, the men who are leaders of all these churches are 
approved of me, any church will do, they will all lead you back 
into the presence of our heavenly Father?'* The boy might have 
expected such an answer from the conditions that existed. But 
he wanted to know what to do, and he had full faith that the 
Lord would tell him. So when he prayed, he asked which of 
the churches he should join, and I presume he was astonished 
when our heavenly Father said to him, "Join none of them ; they 
teach for doctrine the commandments of men ; they draw near 
to me with their lips but their hearts are far from me; they 
have a form of godliness, but deny the power thereof." Think 
of a boy fourteen years of age arising from his knees in the 
woods near his home and announcing to the world such a mess- 
age at that! Can you imagine that a youth would have dared 



160 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



to do such a thing as that? But with the witness that had been 
given unto him by his heavenly Father, with that command- 
ment from the Lord himself, dared he do anything else than make 
the announcement that the Lord had spoken to him? It is true, 
his statement was rejected, and those who should have been his 
friends turned away from him and even said it was of the evil 
one. What was the boy's testimony? 

So it was with me. I had actually seen a light, and in the midst of that 
light I saw two personages, and they did in reality speak to me; and 
though I was hated and persecuted for saying that I had seen a vision, yet 
it was true; and while they were persecuting me, reviling me, and speak- 
ing all manner of evil against me falsely for so saying, I was led to say in 
my heart: Why persecute me for telling the truth? I have actually seen 
a vision, and who am I that I can withstand God, or why does the world 
think to make me deny what I have actually seen? For I had seen a vision; 
I knew it, and I could not deny it, neither dared I do it, at least I knew 
that by so doing I would offend God, and come under condemnation. 

THE RESULTS OF JOSEPH'S VISION. 

What of the results? From that boy who, at fourteen years 
of age, beheld the Father and the Son, there came that wonder- 
ful message that our Father in heaven and his Son Jesus Christ 
are glorified men. That the Savior of the world had been resur- 
rected from the dead; that youth beheld what the world had 
known, but for some reason had forgotten, and he began bearing 
witness of it to the children of men. He went about, perform- 
ing his duty, and in due time, by the power of God translated 
and gave to the world the Book of Mormon, a faith-promoting 
record, second to none. Under the direction of the Lord he 
organized the Church with the same officers that were placed 
in it in Judea. The Lord recognized and approved them. He 
directed those possessing divine authority, to confer it upon them, 
and by his instruction the Church was organized in the year 
1830. From that time it has continued to grow. The people 
of the world have generally refused to recognize this? Church 
as divine. All the so-called Christian churches have been allied 
against it. What have been the results? By the thousands, men 
have accepted the truth and have been willing to go into the world 
bearing their testimony of it, paying their own expenses, working 
without money, trusting in God, the eternal Father, to lead them 
on their way. Why do this? Because that testimony was burned 
into their souls. Would brethren and sisters have filled missions 
in the world, have departed from their homes, left their loved ones, and 
gone into the world without purse or scrip, or paying their own 
way, had they not known, as you know, that our heavenly Father would 
reward them for it ? The result of this work has been marvelous 
in its development, despite the opposition of all the forces of 
the world. Our Father in his mercy, has led this people over the 



ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH 



161 



many snares and pitfalls that the adversary has prepared. The 
world have seen the development of the Church and they have mar- 
veled, and people have said, "What has made its people what they 
are?" The answer comes ringing true, because it is our Father's 
work, and no power on the earth can stay its progress. 

OUR GRATITUDE DUE TO FATHER IN HEAVEN. 

Oh, my brethren and sisters, those who have received the 
same witness that God has burned in upon my soul, be grateful and 
show it by your lives. You men and women who have been gathered 
from the nations of the earth as a branch from the burning, be sure 
that you are mindful of his glorious gift unto you, and that you 
are indeed grateful unto him. 

We- will not be popular with those who are unrighteous. This 
Church is opposed by the same power that sought the life of the 
Savior, it has followed the prophets of this dispensation, and many 
of you have lived' to see the hand of the Lord as he has thwarted 
the powers of evil that they have not been able to overthrow this 
work. I am grateful for the knowledge that has come to me. I 
am not dependent upon the testimony of anybody else. It is not 
necessary that my brethren and sisters declare this work to be 
true. But it is music to my ears when they do so. From my child- 
hood I have sought to serve the Lord ; from my youth. I have been 
taught to keep his commandments. And since I have been called 
into the ministry I have sought to do what the Lord would have 
me do, making mistakes as others make mistakes, but through it 
all I have had the sure witness that my heavenly Father knows 
I was trying to do my best, and have felt all the time that he would 
preserve me, if I would honor him and magnify those whom he has 
called to preside over this Church. I have known that by obedience 
to his teachings to the children of men, no power could stay the 
effort that I was making, and that in the end' I would obtain eternal 
life. That has been my testimony. 

THE SWEETEST TESTIMONY OF ALL. 

We have listened to a variety of narratives, but I want to say, 
the testimony that is sweetest of all to me is the testimony that my 
Father lives, and that he, my heavenly Father, has placed this work 
on the earth, that he has called men to act in his name, and that 
all men who will believe and comply with the requirements of the 
gospel will eventually be redeemed in his presence and obtain glory, 
immortality and eternal life. 

What can we give in return for that wonderful information 
that has come to us? I feel as humble as a little child, and I am 
grateful that at my time of life (and I have passed the meridian) 
I see more clearly than I have ever seen before, our Father's 
love and mercy extended toward the children of men. 



162 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 

COMFORTING TESTIMONY. 

I testify that I know that God lives. I know that Jesus of 
Nazareth is the Redeemer of mankind, and there is no other name 
under heaven whereby we may gain a salvation but his. And there 
is no way by which we can obtain an exaltation in the celestial king- 
dom of God but by obeying the laws and ordinances that he has 
laid down. I know that Joseph Smith was a prophet of the living 
God. He gave his life as his testimony to the truth of the gospel, 
and it will be borne to all the world. He was a prophet, and those 
who have succeeded him have been prophets. President Grant is 
a man of God, and I desire to sustain him and hold up his hands 
that all Israel may be blessed by his ministry, and I say that every 
man and woman who will do that will enjoy the blessings of the 
Almighty. 

This is our Father's work. He has pointed out the way where- 
by we may gain an exaltation. He has organized his Church. He 
has instituted the authority of this Church in his own way, and all 
the wisdom of the world cannot change it, and all the opposition 
of this world cannot overthrow it. 

A PRAYER FOR PEACE, LOVE AND ORDER. 

I pray that the Spirit of the Lord may find place in the hearts 
of the children of men, that in the great gathering about to be 
held in the city of Washington the representatives of the nations may 
be inspired to so organize and so arrange that many of the evil 
conditions in this world may be set aside, and that the awful ca- 
lamity that befell us in the late war may not be repeated. It is our 
duty to pray for good men and wise men, and to hold up their hands 
in their attempts to perpetuate peace and law and order among the 
nations of the earth. 

Now any man who refuses to assist in carrying into effect the 
constitutional law of the land not only is he a lawbreaker in the 
sense that he consents to things that are evil, but I want to say 
that he is in opposition to the will of our heavenly Father. (Read 
Section 134 of Doctrine and Covenants.) 

May God add his blessing. May peace be in the homes and at 
the firesides of the Latter-day Saints. When conference clones, 
let all return to our homes determined that, "As for me and my 
house, we will serve the Lord." And if we will do that, the blessing 
of the Almighty will rest upon us, Zion will arise and shine, she 
will put on her beautiful garments, and all the world will turn 
their faces to the land where men are keeping the commandments 
of God. That this may be our happy lot, and that we may be worthy 
of the blessings that are bestowed upon us by our Father in heaven, 
is my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 




ELDER WALTER P. MONSON 163 

The general authorities of the Church were presented and 
unanimously sustained as in the Tabernacle. 

The choir sang an anthem, "Glory to God in the highest." 

Benediction was pronounced by Elder Charles W. Hatch, 
late President of the Birmingham conference, England. 



FOURTH OVERFLOW MEETING 

A fourth overflow meeting was held out of doors near the 
Bureau of Information, Sunday afternoon, October 9, 1921. Elder 
Charles A. Callis, President of the Southern States mission, pre- 
sided. Tracy Y. Cannon acted as chorister, and Frank W. Asper 
as organist and accompanist. 

The congregation sang, "Praise to the man who communed 
with Jehovah." 

Prayer was offered by Elder Tracy Y. Cannon. 

The Pioneer double mixed quartette, directed by Tracy Y. 
Cannon, and consisting of William Cook, Anna Dillmor, Fred W. 
Weight, Carry Christensen, Wilford Keddington, Ralph Sperry, 
Bertha Harbrecht, and Isabel Donaldson, sang, "Grant us peace." 

ELDER WALTER P. MONSON 

(Former President of the Eastern States Mission) 

I assure you it is a great pleasure to meet you on this occasion, 
and to associate with my brethren in the declaration and defense of 
the truth, and to enjoy this opportunity to bear my testimony to you, 
my brethren and sisters; because that testimony which has been 
borne under the guidance and direction of the Holy Spirit of the 
Lord, or that public commitment of one's feelings before one's brethren, 
adds strength to one to resist the temptations which beset mortal 
men, as perhaps no other one thing will do. 

While upon my mission in the east, and after a street service, an 
under-professor of Columbia University asked how it was that in a 
recent visit to Salt Lake City, Utah, he found so many people who 
were set upon living religious lives. I explained to him the peculiar 
organization of the Church, showing that we had not a paid ministry, 
who were to mould public sentiment and to give counsel and instruc- 
tion pertaining to one's conduct in life; but that in the services 
held among our people we had the peculiarity of calling men from 
the congregation to give a reason for the hope within them. He saw 
our point of view, that while one individual who may rest in comfort 
upon the rear seat in one of our gathering places; one Sunday, another 



164 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



next to him, may be called upon to address the congregation; and one 
who has committed himself in public utterance goes away with a 
determination to live the life which he has declared it was his deter- 
mination to live. 

I care not how little or how much one may speak, if but for a short 
time, and he expresses his desire to be honest, truthful, virtuous, posses- 
sed of loving kindness, neighborly, I believe that the Lord has made it 
impossible for him thus to commit himself in his public utterances, 
and go straightway from the meeting, be dishonest, unvirtuous, profane, 
or to be anything except that which he has asked, through the assistance 
of the Lord and the faith and prayers of his fellowmen, to be. And 
further, the individual who remained upon his seat, not halving been 
called upon, naturally realizes that he is a part of this peculiar organ- 
ization, that if they have called upon his neighbor this time, they may 
call upon him next time, hence, he also commences his reform, there and 
then, else when he stands before the public, he may stand with apolo- 
gies written on his countenance, because the people with whom he 
has associated know his life, and it is ill becoming of one whose 
life is not what it' should be to stand as an instructor of righteousness. 
My mind turns to section 68 in the Doctrine and Covenants, which 
contains the doctrine quite distinct of itself, and in contradistinction 
to the religions of the world: 

My servant, Orson Hyde, was called by his ordinance to proclaim the 
everlasting gospel, by the Spirit of the living God, from people to people, 
and from land to land, in the congregations of the wicked, in their syna- 
gogues, reasoning with, and expounding all Scriptures unto them. 

And. behold, and lo, this is an ensample unto all those who were or- 
dained unto this Priesthood, whose mission is appointed unto them to go 
forth; 

And this is the ensample unto them, that they shall speak as they are 
moved upon by the Holy Ghost, 

And whatsoever they shall speak when moved upon by the Holy Ghost, 
shall be scripture, shall be the will of the Lord, shall be the mind of the 
Lord, shall be the word of the Lord, shall be the voice of the Lord, and the 
power of God unto salvation: 

Behold this is the promise of the Lord unto you, O ye my servants; 

Wherefore be of good cheer,, and do not fear, for I the Lord am with 
you, and will stand by you; and ye shall bear record of me, even Jesus 
Christ, that I am the Son of the living God, that I was, that I am, and that 
I am to come. 

This is the word of the Lord unto you my servant, Orson Hyde, and 
also unto my servant Luke Johnson, and unto my servant Lyman Johnson, 
and unto my servant William E. M'Lellin, and unto all the faithful elders 
of my Church. 

What wonderful power is here portrayed as being possessed by 
one who, under the inspiration of Almighty God, can hear testimony 
!hat Jesus is the Christ, which testimony can only come from a 
possession of the Holy Spirit of God which leads into all truth. How 
different from that system which depends upon an education, a college 



ELDER WALTER P. MONSON 



165 



training, a university atmosphere, carried by the individuals who 
occupy the pulpits of the world. How much 'better it is, and I am sure 
that you agree with me, to sit and listen to the word of the Lord 
for but a brief period, wheri spoken under the inspiration of the Lord, 
than to hear the empty eloquence of one who has paid more attention 
to rhetoric than to truth. 

As Latter-day Saints, we must not fall into the ways of the 
world. I would not have it understood) that I am against preparation — 
because I am for preparation, and I do not believe that the Lord can 
direct a good sermon from an empty mind. I believe that it is 
necessary for one to devote himself to prayerful study; that the Holy 
Spirit of God may be enjoyed in the interpretation which one finds 
in the study room, as well as the inspiration of the Lord when, in 
public, he declares the truth. 

When I was a child attending the Primary association, we were 
taught to sing a little kindergarten song— I am not sure that it is 
not taught now ; in fact, some of my children sing it : 

I think when I read that sweet story of old, 

When Jesus was here among men, 
How he called little children as lambs to his fold, 
I should like to have been with him then. 

I wish that his hand had been placed on my head, 
That his arm had been thrown about me, 
. That I might receive his kind looks when he said, 
"Let the little ones come unto me." 

O, how I longed for a time when I might receive these favors; 
how I yearned for the knowledge of that which I had not, of having 
been associated personally with him when he walked upon the earth and 
mingled with men! I thought no greater people could ever have lived 
than those who lived during the time of Christ. But I have learned 
different. I have reached the conclusion that this is the choicest time 
for one to live: when the Holy Spirit abounds, and is free for all 
who will conform to the requirements under which it is enjoyed. Think 
of Peter, faithful though impetuous Peter, who rubbed shoulders 
with his Master; who stood side by side with him when scorn was 
hurled by the enemy; when he boasted of his own strength, "If all 
depart from thee, yet will I stand with thee." The Savior saw the 
boastfulness of his nature and warned him and said, "Before the cock 
shall crow, thou shalt deny me thrice." When Jesus was taken into 
the court of Herod, where a fire perhaps was built to light the night, 
Peter skulked along the shadow of the wall ; he wanted to be with 
his Savior, but his own strength failed him, and when a little maiden 
pointed out and said that he was with the Savior, Peter denied it. 
Wlitn they asked him to say certain words which, because of his 
peculiar tongue, he could not say, then they accused him again, and 
lie cursed and swore and said he did not know the Savior. That was 
after he had rubbed shoulders with the Master. But did Peter ever 



166 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



deny Christ after the promise of the Comforter had come upon him, 
after he had tarried in Jerusalem to receive the same? No; and we 
are told in tradition that, at the close of his life, when he was sentenced 
by Roman power to give his life for his testimony, and was to he 
crucified, as was the custom of the Romans to mete out capital punish- 
ment, he said, "I am not worthy to be crucified as my Lord and Master 
was crucified ; let me be crucified with my head downward," because 
he had denied the Christ. Such was the valor, such was the courage, 
such was the testimony of Peter when the Spirit of God came, like 
the cloven tongue of fire upon them during the Pentecost, and after- 
ward in his life, when he devoted himself to the work of the ministry 
in feeding the sheep! "Feed my lambs," he had been admonished 
by the Savior. 

New, my brethren and sisters, have we the Spirit of the Lord 
in our l.'earts, and in our homes? If not, is it not time we were putting 
them in order, in order that the living testimony of Jesus may be found 
abiding in our homes, and in our daily conduct in life; for, after we 
have been forgiven of our sins through baptism, through obedience 
in baptism, the Spirit of the Lord comes as an attestation from our 
Father that our lives are approved of him, whatsoever our conduct 
may have been in the past. "When ye shall receive the companionship 
of the Holy Spirit of the Lord, then know ye that God has forgiven 
our sins." And when you have not that Spirit, then it is time to 
bow in sackcloth and ashes, repent and secure that Spirit, so that 
when we are called from time to time, we may speak that which 
will be the word of the Lord, that which will be scripture, that 
which will be the mind of the Lord, that which will be the power 
of God unto salvation. 

I have a testimony in my heart of the truthfulness of this work, 
and I bear it to you in all sincerity that, as I know anything in 
life, I know that the gospel is true, and that it will serve the greatest 
human need today upon all the face of the earth. May God help 
us to apply the principles of the gospel in our daily lives, that we may 
be found faithful, full of zeal, full of the testimony of Jesus, and the 
love of our fellow men, and dwell in the confidence of God, I pray, 
in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER REY L. PRATT 

{President of the Mexican Mission) 

Ye are the salt of the earth; but if the salt have lost his savor, where- 
with shall it be salted? it is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast 
out, and to be trodden under foot of men. 

Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on a hill cannot be hid. 

Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on a can- 
dlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house. 

Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good 
works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven. 




ELDER REY L. PRATT W 

Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am 
not come to destroy, but to fulfil. 

For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one 
tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled. 

Whoever, therefore, shall break one of these least commandments, and 
shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: 
but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the 
kingdom of heaven. 

For I say unto you, that except your righteousness shall exceed the 
righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees,, ye shall in no case enter into the 
kingdom of heaven. 

These are the words of our Savior, spoken to those who' believed' 
on his name when he administered among men. There is no difference, 
my brethren and sisters, in the gospel message delivered to all the 
world by the Savior and his disciples in that dispensation, and the 
gospel message delivered to the world by the Savior through his 
prophets and disciples in this dispensation ; and the requirements 
placed upon, the Saints of that former dispensation were no greater 
than the requirements placed upon the Saints in the dispensation in 
which we live. We are told the position that we occupy, the position 
of being the "salt of the earth" — a very necessary article — and we 
are admonished that if we are not the salt of savour, we are unfit 
to be used and only fit to be cast out and trodden under foot of men. 
And we are told furthermore in this scripture that I have read, that if 
our righteousness does not exceed the righteousness of the scribes 
and the Pharisees, or the world that surrounds us, we can in no 
case enter into the kingdom of our Father in heaven. 

The Latter-day Saints are called a peculiar people in the world; 
those who come up to Zion and visit upon this block and learn the 
story of "Mbrmonism" first-hand, and learn of the lives of the 
Latter-day Saints, are led to exclaim, "They are a peculiar people." 
And it is ' right that we should be peculiar, for truly we could not 
follow these admonitions, and not be a peculiar people. Our peculiar- 
ity consists of the fact that the members of the Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints are righteous in excess of any other people upon 
the face of the earth ; and I want to tell you that that man who claims 
membership in the Church of Jesus Christ whose righteousness does 
not excel the righteousness of the world, is not one hundred per 
cent Latter-day Saint, and save he repents, he can in no case enter into 
the kingdom of our Father in heaven. 

We have a message of life and salvation to declare unto the 
children of men, and from the very incipiency of this work, the 
missionary spirit has rested upon the membership of this Church ; 
and when our grandfathers, who composed the membership of this 
Church, numbered only a few, they were called and sent forth into 
the world to declare the glad tidings of salvation unto the children of 
men. They went to preach a righteousness in excess of the righteous- 
ness enjoyed in the world and the churches thereof ; and their mes- 



168 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



sage was, as was the message of the disciples and apostles of old, "Re- 
pent ye, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand." The gospel is commit- 
ted again unto man. It is, as has been quoted to you this afternoon, 
the power of God unto salvation, and it is unto all men everywhere. 
And for ninety years, this message has been going forth ; it is 
going forth today ; and many hundreds of thousands have been gathered 
out, and they have made their lives better; they have made their 
lives sweeter and cleaner, and they have attained a righteousness in 
excess of that which they enjoyed before; and though many of 
those who have been gathered out were good, honorable people, in 
whose hearts there was a desire to serve the Lord, nevertheless, 
because of lack of opportunity to know him and to know the truth 
of the everlasting gospel, they were not able to serve the Lord in 
full purpose of heart, but through the gospel teachings, they have 
been permitted to learn more and to attain more, and consequently 
are better. And woe unto us as a people, or as individuals, when 
it may be said of us that our righteousness is not in excess of the 
righteousness of the people of the world of men who suround us ! 

It has been my privilege for fifteen years consecutively, my 
brethren and sisters, to be engaged in the ministry abroad, and il have 
come in contact with the world, and have learned the condition 
that exists in the world today ; for while many are accepting the 
truth, and many are being brought out and are enjoying these blessings 
that I speak of, still the great majority of men everywhere are not 
inclined toward God ; they are not seeking after him ; they are not 
striving ta serve him in full purpose of heart. 

On the third and fourth of last month, I held conference with 
our elders who were laboring in the city of San Antonio, Texas. 
We had an admirable conference among the Mexican people there, 
but we found people disposed not only to dispute us, not only to 
argue with us, but actually to break up our meetings and to divert 
our message, and if possible, thwart the purposes of the Lord in the 
declaration of the truth to the people of that city. In one of our 
sessions, there filed into our meeting seven ministers of different 
denominations, leagued together, as I learned afterwards, with the 
avowed intention of heckling us and breaking up our meeting. They 
started it, but by the power of the Lord, we were able to quell them 
and we were able to preach the gospel. I suppose that the Spirit of 'the 
Lord rested in such power upon us that they could not but feel it. The 
result was that though they came to molest they marched away when 
the services were over, without even trying to carry into effect that 
which they had come to do. 

I walked up and down the streets of San Antonio between the 
afternoon meeting and a meeting that we held with the English speak- 
ing people at night, and I felt very depressed. I saw the throngs going 
hither and thither, bound upon pleasure; and this Scripture that I 
shall read to you kept repeating itself in my mind. 



ELDER REY L. PRATT

This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come. 

For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, 
'blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,, 

Without natural affection, truce-breakers, false accusers, incontinent, 
fierce, despisers of those that are good, 

Traitors, heady, highminded,, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of 
God; 

Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such 
turn away. (2 Tim. 3:1-5.) 

I saw them seek after pleasure; I saw that they were without 
natural affection; I saw, my brethren and sisters, through their dress, 
through their conduct, and through snatches of conversations that I 
overheard on the street and in the hotel lobbies that they are unclean, 
they are immoral; and as I walked down to the hall where the meet- 
ing was to be held, I felt an impending spirit of gloom, I recalled, as I 
have told you this afternoon, that the gospel message of necessity 
must be preached by this people in all the world, and I also read that 
the Lord has said that after the testimony of his servants, shall come 
the testimony of pestilence, wars, bloodshed, famine, floods, and of 
diverse things that shall take away the lives of men. Well, I left San 
Antonio the next day, but I was led to remark in my talk that night 
in San Antonio that I feared that the judgments of God would be 
poured out upon the specific city of San Antonio if they did not repent 
of their sins ; and it was only five days until the lobby of the hotel in 
which I had stayed, held many feet of water. Thousands of people 
were left homeless. Millions of dollars of treasure were swept away: 
and hundreds of lives were lost. 

I want to tell you, my brethren and sisters, we are living 
in -'. day of the fulfilment of the prophecies of the Lord, and I do not 
esteem it a mere chance that that seven inches of water in one afternoon 
fell upon San Antonio and that vicinity. I take it — because I felt it 
coming before it came — that it was the judgment of God calling 
those wicked people to repentance. I do not take it that there was not 
enough room in Texas for that flood to have fallen outside of San 
Antonio, if the Lord had wanted it to. Neither do I take it that there 
could not have been another place in Colorado where the floods could 
have come that destroyed the city of Pueblo and the people thereof. And 
I want to tell you that they are the judgments of the Lord, and I look 
forward to a greater demonstration of them in the future. 

It is our duty, my brethren and sisters, to fulfil the obligations 
resting upon us. The decree has gone forth that every knee shall bow 
and every tongue confess that Jesus is the Christ, and it will come. 
Whether it will come because they accept the testimony of the 
servants of the Lord, or whether they toe brought low by the judgments 
of God, the people of this world will acknowledge him and bow in 
reverence and worship before him. 

The Lord bless us and help us to perform our part. You, fathers 
and mothers of the missionaries, the Lord bless you and make you feel

your true positions in this great work. We mission presidents cannot 
begin to do it; we need the assistance of your sons, and we and your 
sons cannot do it all without the assistance of you parents. Sustain 
them, encourage them, sacrifice, if need be, to aid them, and the Lord 
will bless you, and I promise you that sacrifice in this direction will 
bring forth the blessings of heaven to you. God grant it unto you is 
my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The double quartette sang, "Christian, the morn breaks o'er 
thee." 

ELDER WINSLOW FARR SMITH 

(President of the Northern States Mission) 

In standing before you today, my brothers and sisters, and en- 
deavoring to give you something that will be of benefit to you, I must 
ask for your faith and your prayers, for I realize that without them 
it will not be possible for me to give you anything worth while, and that 
with them, and with the sustaining power of the Almighty, the words 
I may be given to say will be of great benefit to you. 

I endorse, from the bottom of my heart, the remarks of the speakers 
who have preceded me, and as I have listened to them and have heard 
their words of encouragement, yea their words of prophecy, I have 
marveled at the blessings of our heavenly Father and the wonderful 
power that he gives to his servants, when they are called to 1 perform 
a duty and when they surrender themselves to him. It has been my 
lot, and no doubt the lot of many of you, to hear the learned divines 
of the world in their studied discourses, preaching along the lines of 
ethics and morals, and even along the lines of religion, as far as 
they understand it; and I have wondered frequently that they have 
given so little. Only recently I read a many-paged address of the 
most prominent bishop of one of the best known of the Protestant 
churches, and I sat with my pencil in my hand to mark passages that 
might be of interest and of value to me, and when I had finished this 
sermon and glanced back to see where I had markel it, I discovered 
I had underscored two lines, which afterwards I noticed were 
quotations from an old history. I compare things of this kind with the 
wonderful power of the servants of the Lord, with the masterful, pow- 
erful, spiritual addresses that you have listened to during this 
conference, and there comes to my mind this passage in the first chapter 
of Corinthians: 

For ye see your calling, brethren, how that not Many wise men after 
the flesh, not many mighty,, not many noble, are called: 

But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the 
wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the 
things which are mighty; 

And base things of the world, and things which are despised, hath God 
chosen, yea, and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are. 




I 



ELDER WIN SLOW FARR SMITH 171 

And as I pondered this thought, my mind reverted to that won- 
derful manifestation of the power of the Almighty, of one hundred 
years ago. When the hour had struck, when the time was there, when 
the earth was ready for God once more to reveal his mighty work, 
in place of going into the universities and the schools and among 
the learned divines, he went into the back woods of the state of New 
York, and chose that unschooled boy, raised him up, and gave to him 
such marvelous knowledge, light, and wisdom, that the influence of 
his work is going to all the corners of the earth. The peoples of the 
world are taking notice and are adopting, one by one, the principles 
that this boy prophet, of the nineteenth century gave to the world. 

This thing called "Mormonism" is a divine thing; it is a most 
powerful thing, and its potency grows day by day. Its influence 
is being felt, and the world is being made better because of these men 
and these women who put themselves in tune with God. And when they 
are in tune with him, through obeying his laws, they receive the Holy 
Ghost, and having received this most blessed boon from our Father, 
disseminate its blessings and wonderful gifts in all the world. 
This is the work of God ; he, the Almighty one, is with it ; he has 
placed it on the earth for a definite purpose ; and in place of the 
creeds of the present day, the creeds which the people find uncom- 
forting ond unsatisfying, he has placed the gospel of Christ in its 
fulness, and he has charged his people to carry it unto the whole 
world and to preach to all the children of men this wonderful gospel 
cf the kingdom, that they may work out their own salvation, that 
they may prepare themselves for eternal life, and that in preparing 
themselves, they may find joy and comfort and gifts and blessings 
here and now in mortality. 

Why, do you know, my friends, to the average Christian person, 
religion does not mean very much? It is a kind of life-buoy 
a kind of a fire-escape, a kind of a something that will 
save him from going to hell. But to a Latter-day Saint who studies 
his religion who knows what it is, and who lives righteously before 
God, there comes into his life a most wonderful, blessed knowledge 
of what the gospel really is and there unfolds before him a most 
beautiful philosophy of life, life here and life hereafter. He finds 
comfort in his efforts to progress and he enjoys, day by day, the bless- 
ings of God. 

Now it must appeal to you, my brothers and sisters, that when 
that unknown boy, unschooled in the theologies of the world, announced 
these most marvelous truths, that in and of himself without the 
help of God, he could not have done what he did. It must appeal 
to you that with him there was a higher power, and as you meditate 
his eventful life and ponder his most marvelous work, truly it must 
burn itself into your soul that this work performed 'by the Prophet 
Joseph Smith, the restoring of the gospel, is not the work of man, but 
the work of Almighty God. 



172 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 

I am reminded of the story in scripture where the Apostle Peter 
and his associates had been cast into prison because of their preach- 
ing Christ and him crucified, and how in their power they continued 
their work, how: they were miraculously released from prison, and 
they went forth and preached again. And they were called before 
the high priests and the doctors of the law again to be tried. 

Then stood there up one in the council, a Pharisee, named Gamaliel, 
a doctor of the law, had in reputation among all the people, and commanded 
to put the apostles forth a little space; 

_ And he said unto them, Ye men of Israel, take heed to yourselves what 
ye intend to do as touching these men. 

For before these days rose up Theudas, boasting himself to be some- 
body; to whom a number of men, about four hundred, joined themselves: 
who was slain; and all, as many as obeyed him,, were scattered, and brought 
to nought. 

And after this man rose up Judas of Galilee, in the days of the taxing, 
and drew away much people after him: he also perished; and all, even as 
many as obeyed him, were dispersed. 

And now I say unto you, Refrain from these men, and let them alone: 
for if this counsel or this work be of men, it will come to nought: 

But if it be of God, ye cannot overthrow it; lest haply ye be found even 
to fight against God. 

! 

I might say that these words of Gamaliel are just as potent 
today as they were when they were uttered, two thousand years ago. 
With this latter-day work, we know God raised up a prophet and 
followed him with other prophets, men to lead, to guide, to instruct 
his people; and when this work commenced, it was the work of God, 
and though it has been opposed for one hundred years, though it has 
been fought against, though the people have used their mightiest 
weapons and the best brains of the world have combatted it, it 
stands today and will stand a monument to Almighty God. It will 
continue to grow, and ultimately it will triumph, for it is the work of 
God. This is my testimony in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER GEORGE W. McCUNE 

(President of ihe Eastern States Mission). 

My Brethren and Sisters: I would much prefer to have listened 
to my brethren talk, but since the duty is put upon me, I cheerfully 
respond ; but I beseech you, sustain me by your faith and prayers 
that my remarks may be directed by the proper spirit. 

This is the first time I have had' the opportunity of addressing 
a congregation of Latter-day Saints in the open air. It would be 
considered by me a most glorious privilege to stand before such an 
intelligent congregation of non-believers but I confess that I am a little 
nervous in standing before my brethren and sisters. 

However, I know that God lives and that he will make no 



ELDER GEORGE W. McCUNE 



173 



requirements at the hands of his servants except he provides a way 
and gives them the strength and ability to perform; the duty acceptably, 
provided they put their trust in him. Therefore I assure you I stand 
before you in the name of our heavenly Father with an earnest desire 
to bless and encourage you. 

I have enjoyed very much the remarks of our brethren, and the 
spirit of our meeting thus far, and throughout the entire conference 
which we have attended in the past few days. I feel the instructions 
have been very timely, and desire in my heart to live them more 
perfectly in the future. What a wonderful people and community we 
would be if we would sustain one another loyally, and sustain our 
home industries loyally, as suggested by President Heber J. Grant in his 
remarks at the first session of our conference. 

President Grant's remarks regarding our patronizing home in- 
dustry brought to my mind experiences of recent years during which 
time I labored throughout the length and breadth of the inter-mountain 
country striving to persuade the people to be loyal to one another and 
sustain themselves by patronizing home industry. My labors were 
quite generously rewarded for which I am very grateful to my 
brethren and sisters, because it is through their patronage of home 
industry, to a certain extent, that I am now able to maintain myself 
while doing missionary work. Nevertheless, I am confident of the 
fact that we could all improve a great deal in our attitude towards 
home industry, and thus add very materially to the general prosperity 
of our great state. I was greatly surprised to find that, in many 
instances, it was necessary to give the merchants some slight advantage 
in order to induce them to handle the home products, they were not 
willing to give it an equal show with the imported article. It almost 
seems like we are prone to give goods manufactured outside our 
state the advantage, which is very inconsistent when you stop to think 
of it. Every time we buy an article manufactured in Utah, we are 
helping to give employment to our brethren and sisters, our neighbors 
and friends, our fellow citizens, and, as explained by President Grant, 
in the Tabernacle yesterday morning, every dollar thus put into 
circulation in our midst enriches the community many times its 
value by paying many obligations. 

I'm sure the results would astonish us if we would be absolutely 
loyal to home-industry for a brief period. For illustration : we manu- 
facture in Utah a very good grade of overalls, than which there is noth- 
ing better made in the United States. Now if only fifty per-cent of the 
overalls consumed in the state of Utah were the home product it would 
be necessary for both the Z. C. M. I. factory, and also the Scowcroft 
factory at Ogden, to double their capacity ; in other words, if the 
people of Utah would be absolutely loyal to home industry as pertain- 
ing to overalls, the state would sustain at least four big factories 
instead of two small ones and thus give employment to hundreds 
of women at good wages. The same thing applies to other articles made 



174 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



within our state. I know from experience it brings a high sense of 
satisfaction to patronize home industry, it gives one a sense of a 
clear conscience, and he is able to look his fellow citizens right in 
the face. 

On one occasion I labored earnestly with a prominent merchant 
of the state trying to pursuade him to handle the home product in 
preference to the imported, without success, until I observed that a great 
many of the checks issued to our employees in the factory were 
cashed at this merchant's store. When this merchant saw the large 
percentage of these factory checks endorsed by his firm he began to 
see the light ; he realized that he had been standing in his own light 
and henceforth became a loyal booster of home-made overalls. Per- 
sonally I prefer our home products, even at a higher price than 
the imported, if necessary to pay it ; however, as a rule, the home pro- 
duct is able to compete with the imported goods in price as well as 
in quality ; therefore, my brethren and sisters, I most heartily endorse 
the remarks of President Grant as pertaining to home industry, and 
I know, that you and I and every citizen of this inter-mountain country 
will feel well in loyally patronizing our home industries and thus 
doing our bit to sustain one another. This, like all unselfish service 
rendered our fellow-men, in the final analysis, rebounds to our own 
good. 

Now, I had not intended speaking along this line, but I hope 
you will accept of the remarks I have made in the spirit thereof, 
they are given in the spirit of love, with a desire to help build up 
Utah, the Queen of the West. 

Now, my brethren and sisters, I feel that as a people we do not 
fully comprehend the strength of our position in 'the world, nor do 
we comprehend the great responsibility placed upon us nor the power 
or God's holy Priesthood. It behooves us to bring up 'our children with 
a more comprehensive understanding of the gospel of our Redeemer, 
that they might go into the world better qualified to explain its glorious 
principles. We are recipients of all blessings which the rest of the 
world possess, and in addition we have the power of Almighty God 
within us, given, through the holy Priesthood. A great responsibility 
is upon us. Our missionaries are accomplishing a wonderful work, 
but if we could send them forth better equipped the results of their 
labors would be much more satisfactory. The gospel of Jesus Christ, 
of which we have been made happy partakers, has all the saving powers 
within it and will save us temporally, morally, physically, intellectually, 
as well as spiritually, and the whole world is starving for these redeem- 
ing principles. We must go forth and proclaim these glorious truths 
earnestly to all the world, manifesting the fruits of our religion in our 
lives, both at home and abroad and never be found tearing down that 
which the world is doing. 

The spirit of the gospel of Christ is not one of negation but a 
constructive plan of redemption which if adhere to will save us now, 



ELDER GEORGE W. McCUNE 



175 



not at some far off time but now, and eternally just as fast as we 
incorporate these glorious principles in our daily lives. Now I would 
not have you understand that I am preaching the doctrine so com- 
monly taught in the world that belief alone will save us; if our belief 
is sincere and leads us to do the things which our Master has com- 
manded we shall work out our salvation, just as quickly as we accept 
the principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ in our lives. However, 
this does not mean that we cannot sin as taught by many professed 
Christians throughout the world. 

One of the conditions upon which the Savior's plan of redemp- 
tion was accepted by the hosts of heaven was that we should have 
our free agency while in mortality, and while in is true we can become 
strongly fortified against sin by right living and by constantly resist- 
ing evil, it is not a fact that we cannot sin. This brings to my 
mind an experience while laboring as a missionary in England, years 
ago. On one occasion I approached a door where I was graciously 
received by a very intelligent-looking woman. After listening to my 
story, she smiled upon me and said that both she and her husband were 
saved, and had been for a number of years, that they had Christ within 
their hearts and could not sin. I labored very hard to show this good 
woman that she was mistaken and that we were all susceptible to sin- 
ning while in mortality, but she got quite offended when I disputed 
her statement that she could not sin; however, apparently I made no 
impression upon the good woman, hut I learned afterwards that at the 
very moment while I was at the door talking to this woman her 
husband was on his way to London with his neighbor's wife, having 
eloped with her. 

I know, my brethren and sisters, that that doctrine, "By grace 
are ye saved," as it is being interpreted by the world is a pernicious one, 
it puts a premium upon indolence, and is quite contrary to the spirit of 
the gospel of the Redeemer as we understand it. There is much 
for us to do, in fact the Savior has given us the opportunity of working 
out our salvation and in my mind the essence of the gospel of our 
Redeemer is work and therein will we find joy and satisfaction. 

I am sure that when life's book is opened before us we shall be 
judged according to our works, and woe be unto the indolent and sloth- 
ful, those who have been deceived by these pernicious doctrines which 
n lakes religion easy for people who have become lovers of pleasure 
more than lovers of God. One of the universal or most commonly 
accepted teachings among the Christian world which we have to contend 
with today is this idea that we are saved, that there is nothing for the 
individual to do, any attempt to add' to what the Savior already has 
done for us is sin. The followers of this idea are very set in their notion, 
we are seldom able to make any impression upon them. They have 
certainly been deceived by the powers of the evil one. 

I am very glad to report to you, my brethren and sisters, that the 
missionary work is going along in a satisfactory manner. Of course, 



176 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



we regret the loss of so many missionaries due to financial depressions 
in the west, but notwithstanding this we are able to show a splendid 
increase in missionary activities. We are having some wonderful ex- 
periences, our workers are finding great joy and satisfaction in their 
labors, and the Lord is blessing their efforts. These young missionaries 
are showing the fruits of the gospel of Jesus Christ in their living, while 
out in the mission field, and I hope you good friends will encourage 
them to continue on in the same way after they return. Two of our 
elders recently had a very interesting experience, showing how the 
fruits of the gospel are made manifest in the lives of men. It seems 
that these two elders had interested in their teachings, a young man 
and his wife who, finding themselves unable to refute the teachings 
of the elders, had appealed to the young man's father, who happened 
to be the leading minister of their town, but to the young man's 
astonishment he found that his father was unable to explain the 
scriptures as clearly as the "Mormon" missionaries, notwithstanding 
his father was a man of degree while the "Mormon" elders were not so 
well equipped with education of a worldly nature, but they were com- 
missioned of the Lord to teach and preach the gospel of our Redeemer. 

It seems that this young man desired to have his father meet the 
'"Mormon" elders, but the father was indignant at his son's request, he 
thought it an insult to ask him with all his learning, to meet and 
discuss the gospel with these illiterate "Mormons." However, the young- 
man planned to have the missionaries chance to drop into his home 
at the same time his father was there partaking of dinner, this 
proved te> be a wonderful opportunity for the young man and his 
wife to have all their questions, which had accumulated in weeks past, 
answered to their entire satisfaction, and apparently the minister was 
unable to explain the scripture to the satisfaction of this good young 
man. In due time the reverend gentleman found himself badly concerned 
and as is often the case he flew into a rage and began to curse every- 
body in general and the "Mormons" in (particular. At this point the 
young man arose and said emphatically, "If this is the fruit of the gos- 
pel you teach, Father, I want none of it," and he turned to the young 
missionaries and said they had manifested the fruits of the true gospel of 
our Redeemer, patience, love, kindness, and he expressed a desire 
to have strength and fortitude to accept the true gospel, which he did 
in a very short time afterwards, and he is now a very devout Latter-day 
Saint and is very happy notwithstanding he has been disinherited and 
disowned by his parents. 

It is indeed a very interesting sight to see men of high learning 
and men of real ability lose their nerve and their heads when attempt- 
ing to question the humble "Mormon"' missionaries ; on many occasions 
I have seen the scriptures literally fulfilled wherein it was said, through 
one of God's holy prophets, that the Lord would confound the wisdom 
of the wise with the weak things of the earth, etc. 

Now, my brethren and sisters, this young couple as I have just 



ELDER GEORGE W. McCUNE 



177 



stated, were made exceedingly happy through accepting the gospel 
of our Redeemer. I'm sure they were given the wonderful gift 
of the Holy Ghost which is promised to those who are baptized worth- 
ily and have hands laid upon them by one who has the authority 
to officiate in the name of Jesus ; and so were our parents before us, 
when we accepted the gospel in our lives. It is the one thing that will 
continue to make us happy just as long as we live it. We must not 
deceive ourselves by feeling that when we went down into the waters 
of baptism we finished the work. This is a mistaken notion. We have 
just begun our. work of observing every principle of the gosepl as 
taught by the Latter-day Saints and, as stated in the beginning of my 
remarks, we shall earn salvation just as quickly as we obtain a know- 
ledge of the principles of the gospel and live them. If we would obtain 
temporal salvation, we must live the temporal laws of the gospel of 
our Redeemer. I exhort you, my dear brothers and sisters, as well as 
myself, to strive more diligently from now on to live up to the 
teachings of our leaders, and I hope every one of us will return to 
our homes from this conference with a determination in our hearts 
to be loyal to one another, be loyal to our brethren and sisters who 
preside over .us, and the holy Priesthood of God, thus honoring our 
Father in heaven. We shall find great joy and satisfaction in so doing. 
There is no other name under heaven whereby we can be saved, except 
the name of our Reedeemer, and there is no other plan under heaven 
whereby we can obtain satisfaction in this life except the plan laid down 
in the gospel of Jesus Christ. 

We are indeed highly favored of the Lord to be happy partakers 
of this glorious gospel of our Redeemer. To a certain extent it is with 
this as with all other blessings of life, we do not appreciate them fully 
only by comparison, or when separated from them. In order to appre- 
ciate the beauties of the gospel which we are partakers of, it is 
necessary for us to go into the world and see what error and what 
folly is being taught under the name of religion. I am indeed grate- 
ful that my parents had the courage to come out of the world and 
accept of that which the world speaks of contemptuously as "Mor- 
monism." I am indeed grateful that they had the courage to do this, 
for had I been raised in the world, it is possible that I would 
not have manifest the courage which my good parents did. Therefore 
I praise the Lord for my parents, and for his blessings toward me, 
for he has made it known to me that the gospel, which my parents 
embraced and which I now enjoy, is the true gospel of our Redeemer 
and that it has in it the power of God unto salvation to every 
one who will believe it and obey its principles. 

Surely any unbiased person who would read carefully the history 
of our Church must recognize in its progress some super-human 
power; just last week I had the privilege of visiting the deserted city 
of Nauvoo in company with President Winslow F. Smith, of the 
Northern States mission. This was one of the most flourishing of cities, 



178 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



and in all likelihood would have become the capital of Illinois. When 
the Saints were driven out it had a population of 25,500 people, while 
Springfield, 111., at that time, had but six or seven thousand, and 
Chicago had but 12,500 people ; after our people were driven away, 
others acquired this city and the farms surrounding it for a mere song ; 
yet, with only mortal vision and wisdom, they failed utterly, and today 
Nauvoo is the most deserted village I have ever visited, while our 
Saints, driven through the trackless desert, wended their way to the 
Rocky Mountains, and here, in the midst of great hardship, established 
a great commonwealth. This notwithstanding we have submitted to a 
terrible "tax," as the world calls it, that of tithing, or a ten per cent 
of our incomes ; and further, notwithstanding we have paid the same 
taxation as all other people, federal, state, county and city, and have 
met all donations required of us liberally ; and further, notwithstanding 
our people have sustained their sons and daughters and husbands 
in the mission fields for at least a period of two years during the 
productive period of their lives. Notwithstanding these many handi- 
caps, from a worldly standpoint we were recently accused on the 
streets of Rochester, N. Y., by a very eminent divine, of being the 
richest people in the world, and, if to be rich is a crime, I fear we are 
guilty. Statistics show that a larger percentage of our people own their 
homes than any other people in the world, and that, as a community, 
we are richer than any other community of like number, I say surely 
in the face of these apparent disadvantages the unbiased man must 
recognize some divine help in ou- behalf. 

I rejoice exceedingly, my brethren and sisters, in the knowledge 
of the gospel which God has given me, and I earnestly desire to 
encourage you, my brethren and sister.?-, to live more closely to the 
Lord, for we are passing through perilous times, and it behooves us to 
stand in holy places, manifesting the fruits of the gospel of our 
Redeemer in our everyday lives. One of the most desirous fruits 
of the gospel is that of love for one another. I want to urge upon you 
to manifest this beautiful quality more freely in your lives toward one 
another. It will make you happier, and I am sure it wdl make greater 
your admiration and love for our kindred, and for our brethren and 
sisters, friends, and neighbors. Do not wait until they are dead to place 
bouquets upon their caskets, let us now put our arms about our parents, 
and brothers and sisters, and tell them that we love them, thus ra- 
diating sunshine wherever we go, showing practical results from 
the gospel which we have accepted. Life is a wonderful gift, and it 
is ours to live every day, and great possibilities lie before us, notwith- 
standing we have adversities. 

In conlusion I will quote the last verse of one of our Sunday 
school hymns, I think we can apply to our lives, and it is appropriate for 
our consideration during these perilous times: 




ELDER CHARLES A. CALLIS 179 

"You can live a happy life, 

In this world of toil and strife, 

If there's sunshine in your heart; 

And your soul will glow with love, 

From the perfect light above, 

If there's sunshine in your heart today." 

God bless you. Amen. 

ELDER CHAS. A. CALLIS 

{President of the Southern States Mission) 

It is my humble prayer that I may be guided in my remarks by the 
Spirit of the Lord, under which Spirit my brethren have spoken to 
you — by which Spirit I testify unto you that they have declared unto 
you the word of the Lord. The Lord be praised for this glorious 
conference that is now drawing to a close, and we praise and thank 
him for the presence of the First Presidency and General Authorities 
of the Church, who have spoken unto Israel the word of the Lord, 
which is able to make us wise unto salvation. These leaders have 
spoken by the power of the Holy Ghost, and by that power their words 
have been carried to our hearts. 

We are a blessed people. Out of the world, out from the midst 
of the fog of superstition, error and unbelief, God has called us. But 
what for? To idle away our time? No ; for a special work he has called 
us. We are a peculiar people and, as the brethren have said, a people 
who are doing good works among the children of men. I believe and 
testify that the sacrifice of the Saints of God in living their religion, 
paying their tithing and sending their sons and daughters into the 
world to proclaim the fulness of the gospel, is sacred in the sight of 
God. And let us not deceive ourselves; if this w°rk could be accom- 
plished without sacrifice, it would cease to be a work of blessing; for 
"sacrifice brings forth the blessings of heaven." The light we are 
upholding before the world is Jesus Christ, our Savior, our Redeemer ; 
and with his doctrines we are salting the earth, and it shall yet be 
said by those who now oppose us that the faith of the Church has done 
more than any other religious belief in preserving and keeping alive 
in the hearts of men the knowledge of the true and living God. 

"We believe that a man must be called of God by prophecy, 
and by the laying on of hands, of those who are in authority, to 
preach the gospel and administer in the ordinances thereof." By that 
authority your sons and your daughters go into- the world to preach the 
everlasting gospel, to deliver a message that is vital to the eternal 
salvation of the children of men. We are met frequently by men who 
declare they get their authority from the Bible. This is incorrect. 
Before we had the Bible, in its present form, there was authority, and 
there was also religion. Religion does not come out of the Bible; 



180 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



neither does authority. Both existed before there was any Bible.. 
And, in this dispensation of the fulness of times, by John the Baptist, 
and by Peter, James and John, the Father restored to the earth 
this power, this authority, this holy Priesthood, which is exercised 
in the spirit of love and meekness and persuasion for the eternal 
benefit of the sons and daughters of God. This is the authority which 
exists in this Church. 

The judgments of God are in the earth, and so are his blessings. 
The divine mission of the Prophet Joseph Smith may be proved and 
established beyond successful contradiction by the presence of judg- 
ments, pestilence, and famine in the earth, and by the presence of 
war — all of which were foretold by this choice seer and prophet, 
Joseph Smith ; but the divine mission of Joseph Smith may also be 
proved by the blessings of God that are in the earth. We are told 
that one of the signs that was to 1 precede the second coming of the Son 
of God was the inauguration of a glorious work for the salvation of 
the dead. In Malachi we read, 

Rehold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the 
great and dreadful day of the Lord: 

And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart 
of the children to their fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a curse. 

We Latter-day Saints are living and working in the realization of 
this splendid promise of unselfish and magnificent work for the sal- 
vation of the dead ; and it is one of the proofs which establishes 
beyond a doubt that Heber J. Grant is a prophet of the living God. 
The prophet who stands at the head of the Church is given the keys 
of that kingdom, which holds the power to permit work to be done 
by the living for the dead. In the Southern States mission — in every 
mission — on the isles of the sea, the hearts of the people are turning 
to their loved ones that have gone beyond the Veil, and the activity in 
this temple — which is a sermon in stone of the faithfulness tend 
unselfish devotion of God's people — this spiritual activity, the work 
for the dead, is increasing by leaps and bounds, and the hearts of the 
people in the distant missions and in the islands of the sea are being 
turned to their dead; and, inspired by the Holy Ghost, they have 
this work done for their dead kindred. If the president of this Church- 
did not possess the authority to have this work done, do you think that 
the Holy Ghost, which guides unto all truth, would move the people 
on the isles of the sea and the missions outside of Zion to have their 
work done for the dead under the authority of President Heber J. 
Grant? No, it is because they know by the Holy Ghost, the testimony of 
Jesus Christ, that there is the power and the authority of the holy 
Priesthood in this the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 
The Lord said to one of his Nephite prophets : 

For my work is not yet finished; neither shall it be, until the end 
of man; neither from that time henceforth and forever. (II Nephi 29:9.) 



ELDER CHARLES A. CALLIS

And unto Moses, God declared : 

For behold, this is my work and my glory — to bring to pass the im- 
mortality and eternal life of man. 

My brethren and sisters, we are the people of God, whom he is 
using to perform this great and glorious work; and whether in life 
or death, as the work of the Lord never ends, your work and my work 
shall never end; but so long as we continue faithful in this and in 
the world to come, we will be preaching the gospel of Jesus Christ and 
working for the salvation of the souls of the sons and daughters of 
God. Is not this a glorious work— more than world-wide ? It is eternity- 
wide, never-ending; and in this work we will find the joy, the peace, 
and the reward that passeth all understanding. 

I bear you my testimony that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, 
the Redeemer and the Savior of the world, the Being who saved us by 
his precious blood, the Being who is leading this people today as surely 
as he led ancient Israel. I also bear you my testimony that Joseph 
Smith is a prophet, seer and a revelator, a man raised up of God 
to do a mighty work. He came into the world with God's message 
in his heart, and in courage and faith, he proclaimed that message 
until his glorious life ended in martyrdom. By the same spirit in which 
I bear this testimony, I testify that Heber J. Grant is the leader of this 
people, chosen of God, a man who ! holds the power, the authority of 
presidency, the prophet, seer, and revlator — a blessing, a leader, 
a teacher, a counselor, a friend unto this people; and I bear this testi- 
mony in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The general authorities of the Church were presented, as in 
the Tabernacle, and unanimously sustained. 

The congregation sang, "Do what is right," and one verse of, 
"We thank thee, O God, for a prophet." 

The benediction was pronounced by Elder Alvin T. Thorup, 
of the Liberty stake. 



CLOSING SESSION 

Conference was continued in the Tabernacle on Sunday after- 
noon, October 9, at 2 o'clock. President Heber J. Grant presided. 
Overflow meetings were announced at the Assembly Hall, and at 
the Bureau of Information. 

The choir and congregation sang, "O say, what is truth," 
announced by President Grant as the favorite hymn of the late 
President Anthon H. Lund. 



182 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Elder Moroni Lazenby, President of the North Sevier stake, 
offered the opening prayer. 

The Tabernacle choir sang, "Sweet is thy work my God and 
King." 

ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS 

My heart is filled with gratitude on this occasion, my brethren and 
sisters, for the blessings of our heavenly Father which I enjoy in 
common with you. I feel greatly honored in being permitted to sit 
beside the members of the First Presidency of the Church and mem- 
bers of the Council of the Twelve, in the midst of these General 
Authorities of the Church, and to have their fellowship and esteem, 
T would have been pleased to have enjoyed this seat that I have been 
occupying, all through the conference, if it had pleased the Lord and 
the brethren that I should have done so ; but inasmuch as I have 
been asked to make a few remarks, I sincerely hope that I may be 
inspired of the Lord to say the things which he would have me to say. 
I realize that there is a greater responsibility resting upon me than 
upon some of the lay members of the Church, because of the position 
to which I have been called, and the authority which has (been placed 
upon me to be a special witness of the Lord Jesus Christ in all the 
world, whither my lot shall be cast. I feel very happy in, and thankful 
for, the testimony which our heavenly Father has given me of the 
truth of this great latter-day work which came forth through the 
instrumentality of the Prophet Joseph Smith. I know that it is true, 
that th.pr» is in it the power of God unto salvation, both in this life 
and in the life to come. 

THE NOBIILITY OF OUR ANCESTRY AND BIRTH. 

I know that God lives, that he, through his Son Jesus Christ, is 
the Creator of the heavens and the earth, the seas and fountains of 
waters. I know that he is our very eternal Father, the Father of our 
spirits, and I rejoice in the nobility of our ancestry, and birth. Breth- 
ren and sisters, and friends, when we think of the block from which ' 
we have been hewed, I am led to remark: "What manner of men and 
women ought we not to be, we who have inherited, through our 
spiritual birth, the very attributes of Deity which in their perfected 
state and condition make our eternal Father what he is?" We are 
required to develop these attributes. 

THE PURPOSE OF OUR BEING. 

1 

We are placed here upon the earth that we may be tried and 
proved to see whether we will serve God at all hazards, and keep his 
commandments, and endure the tests which shall be made 
of our faith and our integrity. The scriptures say: "Let 




• t .' k 



ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS 



183 



this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus, who being in the 
form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God." As Christ 
felt, so we are admonished that we should feel, just as good children 
here on earth should try to emulate all that is good and noble and 
great in their earthly parents. When there was a great controversy 
in heaven it was upon this point, as I understand, that of being obe- 
dient or of being disobedient. In other words, there was one great one 
who came forth and wanted the Father to make him his son and give 
him the privilege of saving mankind, but in doing so he would take 
away the agency of man and the honor and glory of God. There was' 
another, who was our Father's firstborn. The platform of principles 
upon which he stood was : "Father, thy will be done, and the glory be 
thine forever." That took with the Lord and with the hosts. We who 
are privileged to enjoy the blessings that we enjoy here in this life 
stood with Christ our Savior upon that platform. It pertained not only 
to the former existence, but to the existence of man in mortality 
and beyond the grave. 



Christ, our Lord, was true to the trusts reposed in him-. He was 
our great captain there and has been our great captain here. He has 
marked the way, and every path defined. When he came here he said 
that he came not to do his own will, but the will of him, who sent him — 
the Father, and he has stated that if any man will do his will, he shall 
know of the doctrine whether it is of God or of man, whether he 
spoke of himself or of him who sent him. I thank the Lord that we 
have so far advanced in doing the will of our Father in heaven, in 
yielding obedience unto the laws, ordinances and commandments of the 
Lord, that we have received this witness unto ourselves, as many hun- 
dreds of thousands of honest men and women in the Church can testify 
today. I rejoice not only in the testimony our Father has given to me, 
but in the testimony he has given to you, my brethren and sisters of 
the Church. 



While there are some who have been wayward and indifferent, 
who seem to have forgotten the covenant which they made before they 
came here, to do the will of our Father — and we are constantly laboring 
with such — the great mass of the Latter-day Saints. I firmly believe, 
are trying their utmost to do the will of our Father as pertains to them 
in. this life, and they have the testimony of the truth and manifest 
it in their works in the Church, answering every call that comes to 
them, recognizing the authority which the Lord has placed in the 
Church, whether it be to go abroad into other lands among strangers, 
leaving loved ones, leaving professions, business interests, all that they

WILLINGNESS OF THE SAINTS TO WORK. 



184 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



have, to preach this gospel of the kingdom as a warning unto the 
world, or whether it be to labor at home in the stakes in the wards, in 
the quorums, in the auxiliary associations, or in the temple of the 
Lord, or wherever they are wanted to go. Whatever they are galled 
upon to do we find that willingness of spirit to answer the call of 
authority, take up the responsibility, make sacrifice, and work to help 
the carrying on of this great latter-day work, our Father's work, 
unselfish service to our fellowmen, whether they be in the Church or 
not, whether we have known them or not, whether they 
be dead or alive, this unselfishness is in the hearts of the 
Latter-day Saints, a desire to help the Father to carry on his work 
of salvation. 

THE WONDERFUL ACHIEVEMENTS MADE. 

) 

A wonderful work is being accomplished in the midst of the people, 
and we have the evidence in the organization of the Church, in the 
perfected state it is in at the present time, in the organization of the 
Sunday schools, the auxiliary associations, the quorums of the Priest- 
hood, and in onr temples. In all this work we have the evidence that 
God has not forsaken his people since the death of the Prophet Jo- 
seph Smith. Those who have come after, who have succeeded him to 
the presidency, have received the mantle of the Prophet, each in suc- 
cession, and his administration has been attended with the power of 
God for the growth and the development and onward progress of his 
work in the earth. As we see the work today, we have a living evidence 
of God's power that is in this work, and with his people. We do 
know that the truth will ultimately triumph, that this Church and 
kingdom is established never to be thrown down or to be given to 
another people. Zion's young people are as faithful today as they ever 
have been, and are willing to carry on the work and bear the responsi- 
bility as it comes to them, and they are being better prepared, than 
were the former generations in this Church, to take this responsibility, 
and do effective work. I thank the Lord for the efficiency of his min- 
istry at home and abroad, for faithful men and women who are willing 
to sacrifice and to give and to- do for the accomplishment of the Lord's 
purposes. I trust that I am not jealous or envious of any living man. 
I do hope that I do so love the Lord, our God, and love his work, and 
love the brethren, that I desire to see the work succeed, and to see 
my brethren honored and successful in this work. I have no need 
to covet what any other person enjoys in the way of ability or power for 
good. The Lord has blessed me even more than I could deserve, 
and now I pray you, brethren and sisters, do the will of the Lord, 
follow the direction of him who stands at the head and be on safe 
ground, sure of salvation, and I promise you in the name of the Lord 
you shall obtain it. Amen.

ELDER JOSEPH FIELDING SMITH 

ELIMINATION OF GOD FROM EDUCATION. 

For I know that my redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the 
latter day upon the earth: 

And though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh 
shall I see God: 

Whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall behold, and not an- 
other; though my reins be consumed within me. 

These are the words of an ancient prophet. I believe them most 
sincerely. My reason for quoting them is due to the fact that at a 
meeting, this morning, the statement was made, in remarks by one of 
our educators, that the Lord has been eliminated from our education 
and that he is being eliminated from the doctrines of some of the 
so called Christian churches, for they are attempting to harmonize 
their teachings with certain ideas that prevail in the world which are in 
conflict with the truth. This same brother made a statement to the 
effect that a student, seeking advice regarding a certain course in- 
cluding certain subjects in science, was informed by his teacher that 
he would have to choose between his faith and the course of study 
that would be given in the school, for they could not be harmonized. 

COURSES OF STUDY IN CONFLICT WITH FUNDAMENTAL TRUTHS. 

I regret exceedingly that courses in study in the public schools, 
in the college's and places of learning throughout the land, are in 
conflict with fundamental truths of the Christian faith ; and, for one, 
I desire to express my feelings, and to declare that I consider 
it an outrage against the liberties of the people, when we are denied 
the privilege of teaching principles of eternal tr.uth, in the realm of 
religion; when we are denied the privilge) of 'praying to our heavenly 
Father in the schools, or referring to the Supreme Being, for fear 
that we will offend someone ; and at the same time instructors are per- 
mitted to advocate that in the school which the teacheis themselves 
profess and declare to be in conflict with the fundamentals of the faith 
which I believe, and which thousands of others accept throughout this, 
nation and other nations of the world as divine truth. 



186 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



JESUS CHRIST THE SON OF THE LIVING GOD A FUNDAMENTAL TRUTH. 

< 

My brethren and sisters, we have assembled here from all the 
stakes of Zion; we came with one thought in mind, and that was to 
receive light and truth, to receive encouragement, guidance, and 
instruction, that we might again return to our homes rejoicing in the 
testimony of the knowledege of this gospel, renewed in our faith, 
invigorated, built up and strengthened. I pray you that when you 
return, you remember the things that you have heard ; if not the words, 
at least that you will absorb that which ihas been said, that it may be- 
come a part and parcel of your being, that you will go away rejoicing 
and feeling that you have been fed the words of eternal life, and 
above all else I say this to you : Let it be uppermost in your minds, now 
and at all times, that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God who 
came into the world to lay down his life that we might live. That is the 
truth, and is fundamental. Upon that our faith is built. It can not be 
destroyed. We must adhere to this teaching in spite of the teachings of 
the world, and the notions of men ; for this is paramount, this is 
essential to our salvation. The Lord redeemed us with his blood, he 
gave us salvation, provided — and there is this condition which we 
must not forget — that we will keep his commandments, and always 
remember him. If we will do that then we shall be saved, while the 
ideas and the foolishness of men, shall perish from the earth. 

! 

CRITICISM FROM A GREAT CITIZEN. 

v 

I want to read to you, and I will do it in conclusion, the words 
of one of our great citizens, a man that I honor and respect because 
of his integrity, because he is honest, because he is courageous, because 
he stands, for the truth, as he understands it. These words were 
uttered some time ago by Honorable William Jennings Bryan, in the 
city of New York, before the Brooklyn Academy of Music : 

The Nebraskan exhorted his hearers to dismiss the Darwinian theory as 
false to Christianity, and criticized the colleges and schools for failing to 
teach students Bible truths, declaring that today's crying need is "to love 
the Lord thy God with thy whole heart, and thy whole mind, and thy whole 
soul." He said in part: 

"I am impressed by the lack of earnestness of those who teach religion. 
Our young people in the schools and colleges often go out to battle with 
life without the benefit of religious teaching. Neutrality in religion is 
taught in our universities. We have been too lenient to those opposed to 
teaching religion in the schools. We have allowed them to taKe God out of 
education. 

"One thing I observe is that mystery in the dining room bothers us not 
— it's only in the church. In the former we eat and are not harmed. But 
in the latter we want to 'understand' everything. And yet in the dining room 
there are many mysteries."

THE CHRISTIAN FAITH CANNOT BE HARMONIZED WITH THE FOOLISHNESS 

OF MEN. > 

With that I fully agree. The reason that there is a lack of spirit 
and force in the religious teaching of the world is in part because 
they have tried to harmonize the Christian faith with the foolishness 
of men ; and, of course, it will not harmonize with falsehood and with 
the doctrines of men. But wc have received the light of the everlasting 
gospel. It is our salvation. Let us adhere to it, and worship the Lord 
and keep his commandments, as we have been instructed to do, in the 
name of his Son. This is my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 



ELDER JAMES E. TALMAGE 

Never, I believe, have I experienced more inspiring npwellings of 
thanksgiving and praise in my heart respecting the Latter-day Saints 
in general, than I have during this conference. Looking from my posi- 
tion upon the stand upon this vast body, and realizing that this 
multitude represents comparatively but a small part of the membership 
of the Church, so assembled in an official capacity, 1 am impressed by 
the sense of solidarity and greatness of the Church. I have been struck 
by the uniform attentiveness. I have seen no evidence of frivolity, of 
giving way to the consideration of matters other than those of the hour 
and minute. I have watched carefully ; and I have failed to see neighbors 
talking together. The people present have been following the remarks 
of the speakers; they have been attentive to what has been said. 

IN HARMONY WITH THE WORD OF WISDOM AND WISE COUNSEL. 

I agree most heartily with every word uttered in praise and encour- 
agement of the Latter-day Saints, who are verily the people of God, 
chosen by him and unto whom is committed this gospel with all its 
powers and privileges, including the authority of the holy priesthood. 
While equally optimistic with those of my brethren who have pictured 
brightly the assured future of the people of God, I am also in harmony 
with the words of warning and wise counsel, that have been given, not 
in pessimistic spirit, but in wisdom;; and I say unto you, let us heed 
them. 

COUNSEL IS BINDING UPON THE SAINTS. 

Do you ever think of the inconsistency of raising you right hand 
in solemn witness before God that you will sustain certain men who 
have been called and ordained, in the manner appointed of God, as 
your leaders, as prophets unto the people, verily as revelators, and 
then, though perchance you come together and hear their words, going 
away and pay no attention to them ? When one speaks with the power 



188 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



of his Priesthood, and in the authority of his office, then what he speaks 
is binding upon himself and all who hear. Oftimes I tremble, literally, 
as I consider what I am doing when addressing the Latter-day Saints, 
for I know that what I say unto them is binding upon me, and that I 
shall be judged by the precepts that I impress upon them; and what I 
say under such conditions is likewise binding upon those who hear. 

You cannot, we cannot, pass by lightly the words that come by way 
of counsel and instruction from the ordained servants of God, and 
escape the inevitable penalty of that neglect. Nevertheless, we have 
our agency; we may choose to disobey, but we must take the conse- 
quences of that choice. 

f 

LET US BE GENUINE AND LIVE, UP TO OUR PROFESSIONS. 

Latter-day Saints, let us be what we profess to be; let us be 
genuine ; let us live up to the religion and the principles of the gospel of 
Jesus Christ that we proclaim. We profess to be a prayerful people. 
Do we pray? Are our homes kept pure by prayer? Prayer is the Lord's 
great sterilizer against the germs of spiritual disease that make their 
way into our homes, contaminating the atmosphere, poisoning the food 
we eat. I don't mean your family prayers only ; but do we individually 
pray? It is possibly that a mass or collective condition may exist which 
is very different from the individual condition. There may be a 
home in which prayers are said, but yet perhaps no member of that 
household is really prayerful. Do you feel urged at times to seek a place 
where you can be alone with God, where you can pray, pray unto 
him, not for others to hear, not to conform with some regulation or 
custom, or even because of counsel or advice, but because you feel the 
need of communication with God? Have you not read of the Christ, 
who, after a period of strenuous ministry, went to seek rest ; and do we 
not read that he arose next morning before it was day and went out 
where he could pray? He needed that help that prayer alone could 
bring. 

Great and grand as is this people, mighty as are the works that 
have been accomplished through the blessings of God through his ser- 
vants in these days, there is too little real prayer among the Latter-day 
Saints, too many prayerless homes, and hence the spread of spiritual 
contagion among some of us. Thank the Lord not among many, 
relatively speaking. I have faith in my people, for I know that they are 
the Lord's people, and I am proud to be one of them ; but when the 
cry shall come, as come it shall : "To your tents, O Israel," for there 
are struggles ahead, the Lord knows where to find those who have been 
faithful. They are in the valleys of these mountains, by the thousands 
and tens of thousands. Young,men, young women, men and women 
of mature years, who have never contaminated themselves, who are 
acceptable unto the Lord, who have never bowed the knee to Baal, 
who are the Lord's own. They are here, and though there be a few 



ELDER JAMES E. TALMAGE 



139 



who go astray, yet the Lord will bring them back if they will but repent, 
and make it possible for him to bring them back. 

BLESSINGS COME THROUGH COMPLIANCE WITH LAW. 

Do you know that we tie the Lord's hands, figuratively speaking, 
again and again, so that he can't do what he wishes to though we 
say he is omnipotent. He can't pour out blessings when we have not 
complied with the law upon which those blessings are predicated. 
He can't do it, or he would be unjust. He can't do it, or he would 
be untruthful ; and were he untruthful, were he unjust, he would cease 
to be God. 

I am glad that we praise and worship the living God, and that we 
know of him ; and I feel that we are living in the day of the 
realization of his mightly promises to Israel of old, addressed directly 
to Israel, when Israel as a kingdom had arrayed itself against Judah 
as a kingdom, and when Israel, or the kingdom of Israel, had gone 
off and left the choice and chosen land given unto them-. Oh, how the 
Lord pleaded with them. He said unto them that if they would come 
back and would obey him and keep his commandments, he would 
shower blessings upon them. Among other things he promised this: I 
will give you pastors according to mine heart, which shall feed you 
with knowledge and understanding. Do we not live in that day, the day 
of the realization of that promise? 

"How firm a foundation, ye Saints of the Lord, 
Is laid for your faith in his excellent word! 
What more can he say than to you he 1 hath said, 
You who unto Jesus for refuge have fled?" 

WHY AFFLICTIONS COME. 

( 

Has he not given us prophets and apostles to teach, patriarchs and 
high priests, elders and seventies, the Lesser Priesthood, and provisions 
in the auxiliaries, for the instruction of every soul from the cradle age 
to the age that is considered as marking the natural end of man's life? 
The Latter-day Saints are largely a highly educated people, in the 
things of the Lord ; nevertheless, we are not as well educated as 
we ought to be. We do not read enough, we do not study enough ; we 
do not pray enough ; or we would know more of the. word of God and 
of his will concerning the people. 

When trouble comes upon us, I admit that then we seek after 
him ; and I think we are very much like the Saints in the early days of 
the Church ; those who were persecuted in Missouri, while yet the 
Church had a center in Ohio. The Lord was telling the people in 
Ohio concerning his people in Missouri, their brethren, their brothers, 
members of their own households in many cases. He was telling them 
why the Saints in Zion or Missouri, had suffered as they had suffered : 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



"I, the Lord," he said, "have suffered the affliction to come upon 
them, wherewith they have been afflicted, in consequence of their 
transgressions ;" and then with that pathos and love ever characteristic 
of God the Father and his Son Jesus Christ, the Lord Jesus added: 

"Yet I will own them", — I will own them. I can't let them go. 
I will chasten them and cleanse them, but I will own them still, "and 
they shall be mine in that day when I shall come to make up my 
jewels. 

"Therefore, they must needs be chastened and tried," aye, "even 
as Abraham, who was commanded to offer up his only son; 

"For all those who will not endure chastening but deny me, 
cannot be sanctified. 

"Behold I say unto you, there were jarrings, and contentions, 
and envyings, and strifes, and lustful and covetous desires among 
them; therefore by these things they polluted their inheritances. 

"They were slow to hearken unto the voice of the Lord their 
uod, therefore the Lord their God is slow to hearken unto their prayers, 
to answer them in the day of their trouble. 

"In the day of their peace they esteemed lightly my counsel ; but, in 
the day of their trouble, of necessity they feel after me." 

LET US BE SAINTS INDEED AND NOT PRETENDERS. 

Many of us can't stand prosperity. We forget the Lord until we 
find ourselves in distress, and thereby we demonstrate that we are yet 
not wholly what we profess to be. I cited prayer as a simple illustration. 
I ask again, do we really pray? We profess to be living according 
to the law of the tithe ; we profess it ; we proclaim it ; yet we are 
not living the law of the tithe. It is a gladsome fact that there are 
many amongst us who are conscientiously obeying that law, many 
with whom God is well pleased; but, sad to say, there are many who 
content themselves with making a little donation to the Lord, and 
then they call it a tithing. I understand that the application of the 
term is definite. If we profess to be tithepayers, let us be tithe- 
payers; not go around with a false face. If we profess to be making 
offerings for the poor, according to the order and system established 
in the Church, the value of the two meals from which we are sup- 
posed to abstain on fast day, let us give that food for the help 
of the poor. Do not pretend to do it only. 

Oh, what it is to be a pretender! I feel that if I preach to you 
and do not follow my own preachings, that my place is among 
the hypocrites, and I have read with trembling what the Lord thinks of 
hypocrites. Now I do not say you are hypocrites ; I spoke of my- 
self ; but I know I would be a hypocrite if I profess to be living the law 
of the tithe and simply give a little donation to the Lord that bears no 
proper relation to the blessing he has poured out upon me. I am 
cheating him — think of it, cheating my landlord who has given me 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 191 

the place I call home, food for my household, clothing for my family, 
and many blessings of life, and who, moreover, has trusted me to 
keep the account, and to reckon up how much is due; who has given 
me those things on a graded rental, with the understanding that if 
times are hard and my income be thereby lessened I need not pay him 
so much, because I do not get as much ; and that if times are good and 
my income is larger, that I can pay him a little more. 

Have you ever found a landlord in mortality who would make 
any such arrangement ? The Lord has said to me in effect : "Now this 
has been a hard year for you. You have not had as much income as 
you had last year. I am going to lower your rent. You just pay one- 
tenth, that is all, but it will be less than you paid me last year." 
The landlords on earth, at least some, with whom I have had to deal 
have said: "Look here, times are pretty hard. I must raise your rent; 
and you must pay it in advance." The Lord' says: Pay when you 
receive the blessing. 

Again I say, Latter-day Saints, let us be what we profess to be. 
The Lord, in the passage I have read, spoke of the time in which 
he would come to make up his jewels. He loves jewels, but they must 
be genuine." No colored glass for rubies, no mere paste for diamonds, 
they must be the real thing; and when he comes to make up his jewels, 
I would rather be found a little tiny one-hundredth of a carat dia- 
mond than a glass imitation the size of the Culinam, the biggest 
diamond ever found. The Lord help us to be what we seem to be, 
before him, before our brethren, and in our own consciences, I humbly 
pray in the Master's name. Amen. 

The choir and congregation sang, "O ye mountains high." 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

We have with us today the only living survivor of the Pioneers 
who came here with President Brigham Young— Brother Lorenzo 
Zobriskie Young. I doubt if he could be heard, so We will only ask 
him to stand up and let us take a look at him. This is Brother Young, 
the only surviving member of President Brigham Young's company, 
which came here in 1847. [He was one of the two children who came 
with the company— Perry Decker, being the other child— Clerk. \ 

PRESENTATION OF PEACE, RESOLUTION. 

President Grant presented the following resolution : 
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, brought forth and 
established by the power of God and dedicated to the mission of preparing 
the way for the glorious coming of the Son of God to reign in the earth, in 
truth and righteousness and peace, beholds with deep interest every authori- 
tative movement taken by the nations in the interest of World Peace.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



It is believed that the conference called in Washington to consider the 
limitation of armaments and questions concerning the Pacific and nations 
of the Far East may, under the favor of Heaven, promote this great ob- 
jective. 

To the end that it may do so, the Latter-day Saints in general confer- 
ence now assembled approve the appointment of a Sabbath day before the 
eleventh of November, 1921, on which in all the wards and stakes of Zion, 
and in all branches of the Church in the United States and in the Missions 
throughout the world, the members of the Church shall be called together 
in their usual places of worship to engage in special and solemn prayer for 
Divine guidance of the International Conference on the Limitation of Arma- 
ments, that the cause of Peace may be thereby enhanced, and an ameli- 
oration of the burdens of mankind secured. 

President Grant : It is moved and seconded that this resolution be 
adopted by the Latter-day Saints in General Conference assembled. 
All in favor raise the right hand. 

There was a unanimous vote of approval. 



ELDER SEYMOUR B. YOUNG 

(President of the First council of Seventy) 

If I did not know that the gospel is true, and that Joseph Smith 
was divinely inspired to organize the Church of Jesus Christ once more 
on the earth, I would not be here today, and I would take no interest 
in this particular time that I stand before you. But so well do I know 
of the truth of the gospel that I am glad of the opportunity, and 
glad of the honor accorded me by the President of the Church to 
stand before you for a few: minutes, and lift up my voice in testimony 
of the great truths that we all love and believe in. 

Seventy years ago last June, on the 23rd day of that month, I 
sat on the steps leading up to our little cottage door fronting on the 
Mulholland street on the outskirts of the city of Nauvoo. On that morn- 
ing, passed before our cottage a little distance away, some sixteen 
rnen in a small company of horsemen, with the exception of the sheriff 
or the officer from Carthage who rode behind the company in a 
bugev with two of his assistants. In the van of that company were 
the Prophet Joseph Smith and his brother Hyrum. My mother, stand- 
ing with her five little children on the steps of our little dwelling 
made this remark, and it has never been forgotten by me, although 
I never r.e?rd her repeat it after: "There goes the Prophet Joseph and 
his brother Hyrum. They are going to Carthage." She hesitated a 
moment and then she added: "I fear they are going to their martyr- 
dom." The days dragged wearily until the 28th of June. 
About daylight, in the mornings our neighbor, Jacob Gates, who 
afterwards became prominent as one of the Seven Presidents of Seven- 
fv, associated with my father, President Joseph Young, knocked at our 
door and said: "Sister Jane, are you awake?" No doubt he would have 



ELDER SEYMOUR B. YOUNG 



193 



called "Brother Joseph," but my father was in the eastern states on a 
mission. My mother said: "Yes, Brother Gates," and I remember the 
startled tone in which she asked the question; "What is it?" he an- 
swered : "The Prophet Joseph and his brother Hyrum were murdered 
in Carthage jail last night at 5 o'clock." For this dastardly and cruel 
deed there was great responsibility resting upon the leading men of the 
state and especially upon Governor Thomas Ford who, on the morn- 
ing of the 27th of June, with a small body guard went to the city of 
Nauvoo, lea(ving the Prophet Joseph Smith and his brother, the patri- 
arch Hyrum Smith, and a few of the brethren with them in Carthage 
Jail to the tender mercies of the state militia, known as the Carthage 
Greys, who had declared the day before, in the presence of the 
Governor, that they would take the lives of Joseph and Hyrum Smith. 
I am sure that sooner or later Governor Ford will be called to an 
account for that responsibility, and he with others guilty of this terrible 
crime will have to answer for it by paying the uttermost farthing. And 
so, with reference to the Savior of the world, Pontius Pilate is still 
held responsible for the crucifixion, and he has never been able to wash 
his hands of that crime. During his trial Pilate said to the Savior, 
"What is truth?" The Savior did not answer, and Pilate said, "Why 
dost thou not answer me, dost thou not know I can send thee to the 
cross, or that I have power to set thee at liberty?" Oh, the awful 
responsibility resting upon Pilate, and he, like Governor Ford, will be 
required to pay the uttermost farthing, sometime, somewhere. There 
Ins been written a classical poem on the subject of the crucifixion, 
and Pilate's connection therewith. I will read you the poem from 
memory, but will preface it with quotations from Matthew 27th chap- 
ter. 

And when Pilate was set down on the judgment seat, his wife sent unto 
him, saying: Have thou nothing to do with that just man: for I have suffered 
many things this day in a dream because of him. 

And when Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing, but that rather a 
tumult was made, he took water, and washed his hands before the multitude, 
saying, I am innocent of the blood of this just person; see ye to it. 

THE DREAM OF PILATE'S WIFE 

You cannot wash your hands of this: that crimson would defy 

The many waters of the sea, the cisterns of the sky. 

His blood will be upon your name: nor years can wash it white — 

Not till the leaping seas shall wash the great stars from the night. 

You say the Galilean only dreams a foolish dream, 

That he is but an idle leaf upon an idle stream. 

No, he is the man of the people, hated by scribe and priest: 

He is the fear at the Temple door, the specter at the feast. 

Shall the whispering house of Annas draw down upon your head , 
The hatred of the future and the shadow of the dead? . . 

Why palter with this priestly crew? They hold a long intent: 
When the wheels of the street have pity, will the hearts of the priests 
relent ? 



194 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 

i 

You say you fear Tiberius, — you fear the roar of Rome; 

But this man is to Caesar as a sca-rock is to foam. 

Whoever turns from this man's truth, he takes the thorns for bed, 

He plows the seas for gardens, and he sows the sand for bread. 

Oh, let the Galilean go, strike off his cruel bond. 
Behold that fathomless silence and those eyes that look beyond. 
There's more than mortal in that face, — than earthly in this hour; 
The fate that now is in the bud will soon be in the flower. 

Pilate, I have suffered many things in dream today 
Because of this strange teacher of the strait and mystic way: 

1 saw him hanging on a cross, where the stones of Golgoth are: 
Then laid, at last, in a guarded tomb, under the evening star. 

I saw him rise again one dawn and down a garden gc. 
Shining like great Apollo white, our god of the silver bow: 
And then the wind of vision tore the veil of time apart, 
And love of him ran greatening from camel-path to mart; 
His story was a wonder on the eager lips of men, 
The scourged Galilean walked the roads of earth again.. 
I saw Jerusalem go down before the wrath of spears, 
And turn into a' field of stones under the trampling years. 

All these fair towers and walls went down, with a great and terrible 
cry, 

While signs and portents so threw on earth their shadows from the 
sky, 

Where spectral warriors strode the clouds like giant cherubim, 
Going to battle in the night, now glorious, now dim. 
Then whispers wild; the shout of crazing prophets on the street; 
The wail of mothers by their dead; the sound of running feet; 
And then the temple reddened up, and stood,, a cone of flame. 
Then ashes, and Jerusalem had withered to a name. 

World-battles raged around this man, the world's mysterious king; 

But over the storm of ages I could hear the Seven-Stars sing. 

Rome crumbled and I heard a voice across the ruin laugh; 

A Power had risen on the world, shaking its thrones as chaff. 

And down the ages rang your name, a byword and a jeer: 

"He suffered under Pilate!" sounded ever in my ear. 

The deeds of some are clean forgot, but yours did breathe and live; 

Some are forgiven in the end, but none could you forgive. 

ELDER BRIGHAM H. ROBERTS 

{Of the First Council of Seventy) 

I desire to call your attention, for just a few moments, to the 
resolution which you so unanimously, and, as I judge, enthusiastically 
voted to sustain. I am sorry that we shall not have larger opportunity 
io go into the theme which that resolution naturally presents to our 
minds. I do not know whether the international conference on the 
limitation of armaments, to be held in Washington beginning on the 
third anniversary of the signing of the armistice, which brought to its 
close the great World War — I do not know, I say, if that conference 
will result really in the limitation of armaments among the great 



ELDER BRIGHAM H. ROBERTS 



195 



nations that will be represented in that conference. I realize, I think, 
in part at least, the great difficulties that confront such a conference 
in the present unsettled state of affairs of these nations; but while 
I do not know whether it will be successful or not, I think, I do know 
that it is the duty of the membership of the Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints to put forth every effort within their power 
to further the probability of the limitation of armaments among- the 
nations of the earth. The old theory used to be that in order to preserve 
peace you must be prepared for war. The years between August, 1914, 
and the 11th day of November, 1918, demonstrated the fallacy of that 
theory. I am sure if there shall come an agrement upon the limitation 
of armaments, a long step will have been taken in the direction of 
world-peace, and therefore even if there exists but just a bare 
probability that something favorable in the interest of world-peace may 
be accomplished, it is becoming in the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Later-day Saints to make it known in all the world that we stand in 
favor of every movement that even holds out a prospect of peace on 
earth and good will to men. I can only refer to just one concrete 
example of the folly of what the nations of the earth are doing in this 
mad struggle that they are engaged in, in the competition of arma- 
ments. 

The Government of the United States recently received from the 
contractors the battleship Maryland. It is the proudest possession of 
our navy. It requires a crew of fifteen hundred men to man it, and 
one hundred officers, making in all to man that one battleship sixteen 
hundred men who are, of course, withdrawn from productive pursuits in 
life. It was builded at a cost of forty-two millions of dollars. It has as its 
chief armament eight sixteen-inch guns at a cost of two hundred fifty- 
six thousand dollars per gun. The guns can be fired one hundred times, 
and then they go to the junk heap. That is one of our battleships. 
Its life of usefulness and effectiveness will be eight years. After 
eight years, you must by that time have another ship of the same 
calibre and quality to take its place, with still further ships if you 
are going to keep your relative position in the naval strength of the 
world. We have three such great battleships as this, that is, we have 
two others of the same type, the Colorado and the California. We have 
eight other battleships in course of construction, but the dates of their 
completion are not fixed, at the present time. If our own naval pro- 
gram shall proceed as planned, and England shall go on with her 
program as planned, by the completion of these programs, we shall 
nearly have overtaken the great navy of the world-wide empire of Eng- 
land. Japan, to keep up in the mad race, is likely to ruin her people 
in that effort. She can only maintain her relative position in the strug- 
gle, by a continuation of her predatory methods, by encroaching 
upon the rights and privileges of other nations in order to make good 
her part in her alleged struggle for existence, and her naval program is 
said to be attendant upon it. 



196 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



And so one might go on to call attention to the varying phases 
of this useless competition going on in the world, in the matter of 
naval armament, to say nothing of the army programs and the develop- 
ment of land forces in the several nations of the earth. We have evi- 
dently come to the time when there will come through limitation 
of armaments the security of the world's peace, or we shall go on and on 
until we repeat— which God forbid — repeat the awful cataclysm of war 
and destruction such as we witnessed during the world's great war 
but recently closed. 

The Lord gave a commandment unto his people, early in the his- 
tory of this dispensation, at the time when they were driven from 
their homes in Missouri and inquired earnestly of the Lord to know 
what they were to do. He commanded them to raise a standard of peace, 
not only in reference to those who had maltreated them, and driven 
them from their homes, but to raise a standard of peace to + he whole 
world, and to proclaim peace. (Doc. and Coc. 105:38-40). That is 
our mission, chiefly our mission, to prepare the way for the coming of 
the. Prince of Peace himself, whom the angels and the inhabitants of 
the earth shall j.gain proclaim the giver of "peace on earth, 
good will to man." That is our program; and since this inter- 
national conference proposes to limit the armaments cf both land and 
sea forces, I for one hail it as an indication that the Spirit of the Lord 
is working in the hearts of the people and the leading statesmen 
of the world to bring to pass peace among the nations, and so I want 
the privilege, for one, of standing in the midst of my fellows and 
at least raising my voice in good cheer towards the achievement 
of that noble end which the conference has in view. But, Latter-day 
Saints, if this resolution just passed is not of the spirit, and if it be not 
your intent to rise as one man in Israel and pledge your earnest effort, 
with prayer to God, for the achievement of this thing, I pray you 
cancel the vote that you have cast. Let us either not do this thing, 
or do it with all the --irength and power that God will give to us 
in desire and in prayer. 

I shall conclude, however reluctantly I leave the theme — I shall 
conclude by reading to you a prayer which perhaps in the meeting 
that you are to hold on the day appointed, when you shall assemble in 
solemn prayer service for this great cause, might not be inappropriate. 
It is a prayer which was given by revelation of God, ninety years ago, 
through the Prophet of the new dispensation. There seems to' be no 
historical conditions existing at that time that especially called for 
such a prayer. It is introduced in the history of the Prophet with 
the mere statement that "In the fore part of October I received the 
following prayer through inspiration." The heading of the prayer in 
the Doctrine and Covenants is as follows : 

"Revelation on prayer, given through Joseph, the Seer, at Hiram 
Portage Co., Ohio, in the fore part of October, 1831." 



ELDER STEPHEN L. RICHARDS 



197 



And this is the prayer ; and, like all the prayers given of God, it is 
brief : 

Hearken, and lo, a voice as of one from o,n high, who is mighty and 
powerful, whose going forth is unto the ends of the earth, yea,, whose voice 
is unto men — Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight. 

The keys of the kingdom of God are committed unto man on the earth, 
and from thence shall the gospel roll forth unto the ends of the earth, as the 
stone which is cut out of the mountain without hands shall roll forth, until 
it has filled the whole earth; 

Yea, a voice crying — Prepare ye the way of the 'Lord, prepare ye the 
supper of the Lamb, make ready for the Bridegroom; 

Pray unto the Lord, call upon his holy name, make known his wonder- 
ful works among the people; 

Call upon the Lord, that his kingdom may go forth upon the earth, 
that the inhabitants thereof may receive it, and be prepared for the days 
to come, in the which the Son of man shall come down in heaven, clothed 
in the brightness of his glory, to meet the kingdom of God which is set up 
on the earth; 

Wherefore may the kingdom of God go forth, that the kingdom of 
heaven may come, that thou, O God, mayest be glorified in heaven so on 
earth, that thy enemies may be subdued; for thine is the honor, power and 
glory, forever and ever. Amen. 



ELDER STEPHEN L. RICHARDS 

■ I fear lest I shall say a word to detract in any measure from the 
noble themes of this conference, for the subject which, with the help 
of the Lord, I would present for your brief consideration, is indeed 
a very humble one. 

HOME, THE BASIC INSTITUTION. 

i 

When I contemplate the great organization of the Church, with 
all the means and facilities which the Lord has placed at our com- 
mand to carry forward his work, to educate the people in the ways 
of the Lord, and to ultimately establish his kingdom, I always revert to 
one great institution as being basic in its nature, and fundamental 
in its importance. That one institution, to my thinking, has done 
more to influence the lives of human beings than has any other of 
the institutions given to us. It is the sacred institution of the home. 

THE GREAT AUXILIARIES CAN NOT TAKE THE PLACE OF HOME 

< 

I have for a considerable number of years had the opportunity 
of engaging in the work of the various organizations of the Church. 
I know something of the great accomplishments of the auxiliary 
organizations which devote themselves, in large measure, to the care 
and culture of the young. I know what great effort is put forth by them 
to teach the principles of the gospel, to stimulate righteousness in the 



198 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 

hearts of the youth of Israel. It is my observation that these great 
institutions of the Church, however much of good they may accomplish, 
can in no sense take the place of the home. They cannot be proxy 
for parents. Men and women to whom have been given the most 
priceless heritage given of God to man — children — can in no wise 
escape the great responsibility devolving upon them — to rear their 
children in the fear and admonition of the Lord. 

THE OLD FASHIONED HOME DETERIORATING. 

I have been led to think that the old fashioned home is deterio- 
rating. I have feared that its influence upon humanity is becoming less 
and less. We have come to regard the places in which we live as mere 
accomodations, mere boarding houses, wherein we eat and sleep and 
from which we are to make our escape as soon as may be. This charac- 
terization does not apply to all homes; but I believe that it applies 
to altogether too many homes. 

HOME, THE FOUNDATION OF SOCIETY. 

I believe in the home as the foundation of society, as the cor- 
nerstone of the nation, and as the primary institution of the Church. I 
cannot conceive of a great people without great, good homes. I believe 
that the first calling of man and woman is to form a good home. 
I know of no honor that can come to men and women that exceeds 
the honor of father and of mother, I regret that not all men who enter 
in*o this sacred relationship, which lies at the foundation of home, are 
real fathers ; and I likewise regret that every woman who comes into 
the temple of the home as its priestess does not in full comprehend 
the great responsibility and the wonderful, privilege bestowed upon her. 
I sometimes think that the processes of modern education are inclined 
to educate our people away from home rather than to home. 

NO GREATER DISTINCTION THAN MOTHERHOOD. 

I believe that no greater distinction may come to the women of our 
land than to be in verity mothers in Israel. I am not unmindful of the 
progress that woman has made in the last half century and of her 
present influence in public and other affairs. I welcome that influence. 
I am always willing that our women should take a large interest 
and exercise a large influence upon all the affairs of State and of 
Church, but I want to say that no woman can ever attain a place of re- 
nown and distinction for any work performed in this world that is 
comparable with the high place of mother and wife. 

THERE IS NO GREATER CALLING THAN FATHERHOOD. 

I want our men, to know that of all the vocations they may pursue 
in this life, no vocation is fraught with so much responsibility and attend- 
ed with such boundless opportunity as the great calling of husband and 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 



199 



father. In this Church I believe w.e have the highest and mos' exaked 
conception of home and family lhat exis's anywhere in the wide world. 
Attention has already been called to the fact that we base our very hope 
for exaltation and eternal life upon those relationships that lie at the 
basis of home. No man, whatever his accomplishments may be, can, in 
my judgment, be said to have achieved success in this life if, when 
he goes hence he may not take his posterity with him, and may not be 
surrounded by them in the day of the Lord, when he shall be called 
upon to account for his life in the flesh. 

A f N APPEAL TO THE FATHERS AND MOTHERS OF ISRAEL. 

Time will not permit the elaboration of this humble but exalted 
theme. I would that every father and mother in Zion would bind their 
children to them with ties of love and affection that will hold them 
safe in the hours of temptation and danger and trial. We of thcaux- 
iliary associations and institutions of the Church cannot hope to do more 
for you than merely to supplement and complement the work of the 
home. You can not place the chief responsibility with us ; and, therefore, 
I appeal, in the name of the children, to the fathers and mothers of 
Israel, for closer attention 'o and study of that great institution, the 
home. I appeal for more of comradeship between father and son, for 
more of chumship, confidence, and love between mother and daughter. 
I believe in home-made men and women. T believe they are more 
assured of success in life; they will make better citizens; that they 
will accomplish their destiny far more acceptably to our Father, than will 
lodge-made and club-made, fraternity-made, union-made, society-made 
men and women. I plead for the return to old-fashioned, domestic 
family life, that there may be stimulated in the hearts of men a love 
for home and all its surroundings ; and as we now disperse to go to our 
several homes, up and down this land, God grant that that great insti- 
tution may be the place where Latter-day Saints are nurtured and 
conserved, and where a citizenship of this great nation and' of this great 
Church shall be assured for the establishment of our Father's kingdom, 
I humbly pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

earliest recollection until she passed away, some ninety-odd years of age, 
with a power, a force, and a spirit that I have seldom heard from the 
lips of any person. I rejoice that she had the opportunity of travel- 
ing over the stakes of Zion, from Canada to Mexico, and in many 
foreign lands, in attending many gatherings of noted women in the 
world, at home in these United States and abroad. Wherever she went she 
bore that testimony and, by the integrity of her heart, by the wonder- 
ful and splendid intellect that she had, and above all, by the burning 
testimony of the divinity of this work, in which we as Latter-day 
Saints are engaged, she made friends for this people among all 
those with whom she came in contact. 

REGRETS THE LIMIT OF TIME. 

There has been but one regret in my mind during this conference, 
and that is that we have had to limit the time of the speakers, asking 
some not to exceed ten minutes, others not to exceed fifteen, and 
allowing none to go beyond twenty minutes. I sometimes feel that 
we make a mistake in not having four days of conference, so that 
when men are speaking under the inspiration of the Spirit of the living 
God, they will not feel that they have to say "Amen" upon the mo- 
ment. At the same time, I believe that we feel better and that we 
accomplish more, if we can start on time and close on time. 

BLESSINGS FOR THE PEOPLE. 

I feel to bless the people for the wonderful attendance at this 
conference. I feared on account of the hard times, and the great 
financial depression, that our conference would not be as largely at- 
tended as heretofore; but our gatherings here this morning, in this 
building, in the Assembly Hall, and in the overflow meetings, and 
our gatherings this afternoon in all three of those meetings, I believe 
have been larger than upon any other occasion in the history of the 
Church. Zion is" growing. The faith of the people is enlarging. Their 
attendance at their sacrament meetings, and at their priesthood meetings 
is increasing and they are becoming more and more faithful in perform- 
ing the duties and the obligations that rest upon them in the auxiliary 
associations. They are doing better ; more work is being accomplished 
in the temples than ever before; and the people are growing in the 
light and the knowledge and testimony and the love of the gospel. 
I pray God to bless the Latter-day Saints in every land and in 
every clime, I pray for hip blessing upon the honest the world 
over, and I pray for peace and happiness to come to the inhabitants 
of the world. 

We will now close our conference for six months, by the choir 
singing the words of a song given by revelation from God contained 
in the Doctrine and Covenants, Section 84.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



The music was written by a former citizen of this state, Arthur 
Shepherd, who has gained for himself a national reputation as a com- 
poser of music. 

The Lord hath brought again Zion : 
The Lord hath redeemed his people, Israel, 
According to the election of grace, 
Which was brought to pass by the faith 
And covenant of their fathers. 

The Lord hath redeemed his people, 
And Satan is bound and time is no longer : 
The Lord hath gathered all things in one: 
The Lord hath brought down Zion from above. 
The Lord hath brought up Zion from beneath. 

The earth hath travailed and brought forth her strength : 
And truth is established in her bowels : 
And t It f hpp"<~'"c have smiled noon her: 
And she is clothed with the glory of her God. 
For he stands in the midst of his people; 

Glory, and honor, and power, and might, 

Be ascribed to our God ; for he is full of mercy, 

Justice, grace and truth, and peace, 

For ever and ever, Amen. 

The choir sang an anthem, (words from Section 84 Doc. & 
Cov.) "The Lord hath brought again Zion." 

Conference was adjourned for six months. 

Benediction was pronounced by Elder J. William Henderson, 
President of the Panguitch stake of Zion. 



Professor Anthony C. Lund conducted the singing in the 
Tabernacle, Professor J. J. McClellan played the accompaniments 
and interludes, etc., on the great organ, assisted by Edward P. 
Kimball and Tracy Y. Cannon. Stenographic reports of the dis- 
courses were made in the Tabernacle by Franklin W. Otterstrom, 
assisted by Clarence Cramer and Clyde Rasmussen ; in the As- 
sembly Hall and Bureau of Information, by Frederick E. Barker 
and Fred G. Barker. 

Edward H. Anderson, Clerk of the Conference.

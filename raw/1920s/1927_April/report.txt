Discourses of Brigham Young 

This Great Book Should be in Every 
Home Library 

No Latter-day Saint home library is complete without the unique 
volume, "Discourses of Brigham Young." Thousands still living were 
thrilled with the inspired wisdom of the great colonizer. They heard 
the words fall from his lips that were a comfort and a guide to them 
in their daily living. 

Those same words, now in print, can help and inspire the new 
generations. The youth should be encouraged to read this great book. 
It will help them to know Brigham Young as they have never known 
him before. They can appraise his doctrine, not by tradition or garbled 
account, but by the perusal of sermons accurately transcribed. 

"Discourses of Brigham Young" will be sent to any address for 
$2.50 postpaid. Special price to members of Priesthood Quorums — $2.00 
postpaid. Orders will be filled mail C. O. D. at $2.00 each, if desired.

President Heber J. Grant presided. 

Every seat in the main hall, galleries and choir stand about the 
great organ was occupied, and many hundreds were standing in the 
aisles. There was also a crowded house in the Assembly Hall, where 
an overflow meeting was conducted by Elder J. Golden Kimball, of the 
First Council of Seventy. Many were unable to gain entrance into 
either building, but assembled at the Bureau of Information building 
and listened to the Tabernacle services as they came over the radio.

The choir sang the anthem, "They that sow in tears." 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

It has been customary at the April Conferences to make announce- 
ments and to read some statistics. We regret the absence of Elder 
Reed Smoot, of the Council of the Twelve. I have a telegram from him 
reading as follows : 

TELEGRAM FROM ELDER REED SMOOT 

"I send greetings to the Saints assembled at the General Conference. Al- 
lie's serious sickness, only thing that prevents my presence. Blessings of God is 
the only power that can save her. I would appreciate the faith and prayers of 
the people assembled, asking our heavenly Father to grant, if it is his -will, that 
she be given further life, with renewed health and strength." 

Reed Smoot. 

OTHER AUTHORITIES ABSENT 

The Presiding Patriarch is absent on account of ill health. 

As you all know, Elder James E. Talmage, of the Council of the 
Twelve, is presiding over the European mission, and cannot, therefore, 
■be with us. I regret, on account of the serious illness of a daughter 
of Brother Joseph W. McMurrin, of the First Council of Seventy, 
that he alsois absent. All the others of the General Authorities of the 
Church are in attendance today.

Stake and Ward Purposes — There has been returned from the 
tithes to the stakes and wards for operation, maintenance, and build- 
ing construction, $1,530,243.64. 

Education — Expended for the construction and operation of Church 
schools, $837,810.47. 

Temples — Expended for the construction, maintenance, and oper- 
ation of temples, $322,500.36.

charities and assistance rendered by the Relief Society, in the sum of 
$436,055.44, which amount, added to the $187,570.43 paid from the

chapel and other chapels to the value of $200,000. The California 
mission at the present time owns chapels of a value of over $400,000. 
The chapel at Oakland is as fine a chapel, and holds about as many 
people, as any of our ward chapels in the stakes of Zion. It has 
been decided to organize another stake of Zion in Northern California, 
with San Francisco, Oakland and surrounding country to compose that 
stake. 

There have been collected by the various wards of the Church and 
paid to missionaries, to assist in their maintenance, $128,299.65. 

REPORT OF THE AUDITING COMMITTEE 

"President Heber J. Grant and Counselors, Building. 

' Dear Brethren: As the Church Auditing Committee, we have to report that 
the accounting of the Church, as shown by the records in the First Presidency's 
office and in the office of the Presiding Bishopric, is all that could be desired. 
The receipts and disbursements, the revenues and expenses of the Church are so 
carefully and accurately kept that the present worth or financial status of the 
Church is clearly shown. The affairs of the Church are wisely administered, and 
the present showing is excellent. It is gratifying to know that the credit of the 
Church comes under the very highest rating, but it is still more gratifying to 
know that the Church is under no necessity at present to use its credit in the com- 
mercial world by borrowing money.

handed me a compilation of the missionaries that have been in the field 
from the year 1830 until 1926. The lowest number is 16 missionaries, 
the first year of the Church. The highest number sent out in anv 
year is 1,313, in 1925; 1,235 in 1926, and 1,211 in 1919. The total 
is between 35,000 and 40,000 missionaries that have been sent into 
the field. \ jl I 

REPORTS FROM THE MISSIONS 

Speaking of the missions, I will read some few requests from a 
number of mission presidents : 

The Northcentral States: "We shall be losing about twenty mis- 
sionaries in the next twenty days, which will bring us down to about 
fifty-seven. Our greatest need, therefore, is more missionaries." 

Central Statess "We need long-term missionaries more than any- 
thing else right at the present time." 

California mission: "We are parting with short-term missionaries 
almost daily, and need fifty elders and twenty-five lady missionaries to 
care properly for the districts that are open. More missionaries will be 
released during the next three months than the foregoing number." 

Australian mission: "In this report we have four fewer missionaries 
than a year ago, and in February we have nine who will leave this mis- 
sion, and unless we receive recruits very fast we will be very short- 
handed by the first of March." 

German- Austrian mission: "Our work is going forward by leaps 
and bounds. We are needing four or five elders each month in order 
to hold our present field. We should be opening new fields." 

Danish mission : "Elders are needed as we will soon be seriously 
handicapped on account of so many who will receive releases to return 
home." 

Swedish mission : "During the coming month there will be about 
five other elders released. We would appreciate receiving more breth- 
ren, especially those who understand Swedish ; or better still if they 
can speak it." 

The French and Swiss-German missions also make the same ap- 
peal. 

(At this point President B. H. Roberts remarked: "I wish to join 
the chorus in behalf of the Eastern States mission.") 

I might say that the chorus will be unanimous, for I do not believe 
there is a single mission that has not made appeals, but I have just put 
down a few to read here this afternoon. 

(President B. H. Roberts: "President Grant, remember our great 
population in proportion to our number.") 

I find that each and every mission president is thoroughly con- 
verted that he needs more missionaries than the others. 

There is another thing that I rejoice in, above everything else in 
our missionary work, and that is, all the missionaries are thoroughly 
convinced that their mission president is the finest of all the mission 
presidents, and that their mission is the best, although it may be in far- 
off Australia, or any other place. The outpouring of the Spirit of the

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Lord upon our missionaries is such that they rejoice and are happy in 
their labors. 

VISITS SINCE LAST CONFERENCE 

Since our last conference lit has fallen to my lot to be actively 
engaged in visiting some of the stakes of Zion. I have visited the Big 
Horn section of the country and other sections of Wyoming and 
Montana. I also visited some of the wards in the San Luis valley, 
dedicating a small chapel in Wyoming and one in Denver, Colorado. 
I visited the St. Joseph, Maricopa and Los Angeles stakes, and some 
of the stakes in Utah, holding meetings with the Saints in Arizona and 
dedicating two chapels there and four in the Los Angeles stake. I 
have had the pleasure of holding meetings with the Saints and mis- 
sionaries in Omaha and Lincoln, Nebraska ; Rock Springs and Green 
River, Wyoming. This was the first time that I have had the pleasure 
of being at Lincoln, the capital of Nebraska, or at Green River and 
Rock Springs. In addition 'I have visited a number of the wards in 
the different stakes here in Utah, dedicating chapels, during the last 
six months. 

FAVORABLE ATTITUDE TOWARDS THE CHURCH 

There is a most wonderful change in the attitude of the people 
of the world towards the Latter-day Saints. I find no difficulty what- 
ever in getting publicity in the various papers ; and when I travel, in 
different cities in the east and west, the north or the south, those who 
have interviewed me have given correct reports of the interviews. 
Brother James E. Talmage is also getting splendid publicity in the 
European papers. He has extensive notices and there seems to be no 
prejudice in the press of Great Britain at the present time. 

AN ILLUSTRATION OF THE FORMER ATTITUDE IN ENGLAND 

When I was in Europe, as the president of the European mission, 
during the entire three years that I was there, they published no article 
that we presented, and no report of a favorable nature was ever pub- 
lished in any of the papers. I call to mind visiting one of the great 
London papers that had published from seven to ten columns of the vilest 
statements regarding the Latter-day Saints. I took with me a letter 
of introduction from the manager of the shipping house in Liverpool 
with which we had done business for over 60 years, vouching for the 
integrity, not only of myself but of all my predecessors as the presidents 
of the European mission of the Church. The editors of this paper 
positively refused to make any refutation of the slanderous articles they 
had published, or to publish a single thing that I wrote, announcing 
that they thought they had published exactly what they ought about 
the "Mormon" people. I told them that I defied them to find a man that 
had written any of those articles who could furnish them with a certi- 
ficate of character, but that I carried with me a certificate of my 
integrity and honesty, signed by all the non-"Mormon" bankers in Salt 
Lake City at that time; that I also had letters from bankers and in-

fluential business men from New York to San Francisco ; that I did 
not carry with me any recommendation from "Mormon" institutions 
or from "Mormons." Had I done so, I told the editor, it would be 
like writing a letter myself : "To Whom It May Concern : The bearer, 
Heber J. Grant, is honorable. Respectfully, Heber ']. Grant." He said, 
"Never mind your opinion, Mr. Grant, we will not publish anything re- 
garding your people." I happened to remember that the gentleman's 
name was Robinson. As I reached the door and put on my two-story 
hat — which it is necessary to wear in Europe, if you are considered any- 
body — I turned around, took it off and said: 

"I understand that your name is Robinson, that the editor-in-chief, 
to whom my letter is written, is out of the city." He said : "Yes, that 
is right." "Are you acquainted with Phil Robinson?" "Yes." "Would 
you believe anything and everything that Phil Robinson says about the 
'Mormons?'" He said: "I certainly would." I said: "Was he the 
correspondent of the London Daily Telegraph, one of the two greatest 
— and I emphasized 'greatest' because his paper was not one of the 
two — in London?" He said: "He was." "And you would believe 
everything he wrote?" "I would." " Buy his book entitled Sinners and 
Saints and you will find that everything you have published about 
the 'Mormons' is a lie, pure and simple. If you can't afford two shillings, 
I will buy the book and present it to you with my compliments." He 
said : "You astonish me." I said : "You are not the first man who 
has been astonished when confronted with the truth regarding the 'Mor- 
mon' people. I have met your kind from Tokyo, Japan, to London, who 
have refused to publish the truth about the 'Mormons.' " He said, 
"Write a half column." I said, "Thanks for small favors, large ones 
received with greater thanks. Seven to ten columns of falsehoods writ- 
ten against our people, and a half column allowed for refutation !" 
Within a couple of hours he had the half column. He kept it the usual 
30 or 60 days and returned it with the usual printed slip that I have 
seen many times : "The Editor regrets that he cannot find space for 
the enclosed manuscript, and it is returned." When I see those "regrets" 
J cannot but think of the saying: "Polite lying is an accomplishment. 
It lubricates business, varnishes unpleasant facts, and promotes friend- 
ships." 

TRIBUTES PAID TO THE LATTER-DAY SAINTS 

Since that time there have been thousands of splendid tributes 
paid to the Latter-day Saints. I have before me one which was written, 
I think, seven years ago this coming June. I have never heard it quoted 
in this Tabernacle, so I am going to read it. It is from Franklin K. 
Lane, secretary of the interior, as I remember, under President Wilson : 

"Cross the border you come down into Utah. 

"Never speak disrespectfully of the 'Mormon' Church. It has as law-abiding, 
steady, hard-working, kindly a group of people in Utah as will be found anywhere 
this round globe over. Brigham Young may not have been a prophet of Al- 
mighty God, but he worked a miracle when he crossed from the Missouri river 
over that desert, leading his band of a few hundred followers with their push-

carts, going out into that unknown waste, and turned the land that lies around 
Salt Lake City into a garden. 

"I brought from Egypt, several years ago, the greatest irrigation expert in 
the world, perhaps, the man who built the Assuan Dam upon the Nile— Sir Wil- 
liam Willcocks, the man who claims to have discovered where the Garden of 
Eden was located, at the junction of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers — and I 
sent him to look over the irrigation enterprises of the United States, and he 
said : 'Nowhere else have I seen people who understand so wisely how to apply 
water to land as around Salt Lake City.' 

"Utah has wonderful beauty in it as well as great stretches of desert that are 
to be reclaimed. We have just discovered a new beauty spot there, Bryce 
canyon." 

And many of them are just discovering Cedar Breaks, Zion canyon 
and the north rim of the Grand canyon, also. 

As I stated before, I say again, I rejoice in the change of sentiment 
of the press of Great Britain, the splendid fruits that are attending 
President James E. Talmage in getting publicity in the newspapers. 

MONUMENT TO THE THREE WITNESSES DEDICATED 

I had the pleasure here, yesterday, of dedicating a little monument 
to the memory of the Three Witnesses of the Book of Mormon. 

THOUSANDS IN ALL PARTS HAVE A TESTIMONY 

I rejoice that there are thousands and tens of thousands of people 
from the country of the midnight sun, Scandinavia, to South Africa, 
from Canada to South America, and upon the islands of the sea, reach- 
ing clear out to New Zealand and Australia, who can testify that God has 
seen fit to answer their earnest prayers and has given to them, 
as is promised here in the Book of Mormon, a testimony regarding this 
remarkable and wonderful record. I read the words of Moroni : 

"Now I, Moroni, write somewhat as seemeth me good ; and I write unto my 
brethren, the Lamanites ; and I would that they should know that more than four 
hundred and twenty years have passed away since the sign was given of the 
coming of Christ. 

"And I seal up these records, after I have spoken a few words by way of ex- 
hortation unto you. 

"Behold, I would exhort you that when ye shall read these things, if it be 
wisdom in God that ye should read them, that ye would remember how'merciful 
the Lord hath been unto the children of men, from the creation of Adam even 
down until the time that ye shall receive these things, and ponder it in your 
hearts. 

"And when ye shall receive these things, I would exhort you that ye wi uld 
ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not true ; 
and if ye shall ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ 
he will manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost 

"And by the power of the Holy Ghost ye may know the truth of all things 
"And whatsoever thing is good is just and true; wherefore nothing that is 
good denieth the Christ, but acknowledged that he is." 

CHRIST IS DENIED BY MANY 

The Christ is denied today by hundreds of thousands of peo- 
ple. Many of the men who are teaching in our great universities 
are denying that Christ was the son of God. Many men who are

teaching from the pulpit do not acknowledge that Jesus Christ was 
in very deed the Son of the Living God, the Redeemer of the World, 
coming to the earth with a definite mission. 

While in Europe I purchased a book by Senator Albert J. Bever- 
idge entitled The Young Man and the World. One of his chapters was 
devoted to the young man preparing for the ministry. He said : 

"Any man who assumes to teach the Christian faith, who, in his own secret 
heart questions that faith, commits a sacrilege every time he enters the pulpit. 

"He is like the chemist's grain of wheat, perfect in all its constituent ele- 
ments except the mysterious spark of life, without which the wheat grain will 
not grow. 

"If, then, you do not believe what you say, and believe it with all your 
soul, believe it in your heart of hearts, do not try to get other men to believe it. 
You will not be honest if you do. The world expects you to be sure of your- 
self. How do you expect to make other people sure of themselves if you are 
not sure of yourself? 

"I would rather be sure that when a man dies he will live again with his 
conscious identity, than to have all the wealth of the United States, or to occupy 
any position of honor or power the world could possibly give," said a man 
whose name is known to the railroad world as one of the ablest transportation 
men in the United States. * * * 

"A few years ago a certain man with good opportunities for the investigation 
and a probability of sincere answers, asked every young preacher whom he met 
during a summer vacation these questions : 

"'First: Yes or no; do you believe in God, the Father; God a person, God 
a definite and tangible intelligence — not a congeries of laws floating like a fog 
through the universe; but God, a person in whose image you were made? Don't 
argue; don't explain; but is your mind in a .condition where you can answer 
yes or no?' 

"Not a man answered 'Yes.' Each man wanted to explain that the Deity 
might be a definite intelligence or might not; that the 'latest thought' was much 
confused upon the matter, and so forth and so on. 

"Second : Yes or no ; do you believe that Christ was the .Son of the living 
God, sent by him to save the world? I am not asking whether you believe that 
he was inspired in the sense that the great moral teachers are inspired — nobody 
has any difficulty about that. But do you believe that Christ was God's very 
Son, with a divinely appointed and definite mission, dying on the cross and raised 
from the dead — yes or no?' 

"Again not a single answer with an unequivocal, earnest 'Yes.' But again 
explanations were offered and in at least half the instances the sum of most 
of the answers was that Christ was the most perfect man that the world had 
seen and humanity's greatest moral teacher." 

I maintain that Christ could not have been humanity's greatest 
moral teacher unless he was in very deed the Son of God, because 
he announced that he was the Son of God, that he was the express image 
of his Father, and that those who had seen him had in very deed 
seen the Father ; therefore if the foundation of his structure were false, 
he could not be a great moral teacher. 

"Third. Do you believe that when you die you will live again as a con- 
scious intelligence, knowing who you are and who other people are? 

"Again not one answer was unconditionally affirmative. 'Of course, they 
were not sure as a matter of knowledge.' 'Of course, that could not be known 
definitely.' 'On the whole, they were inclined to think so, but there were very 
stubborn objections,' and so forth and so on. 

"The men to whom these questions were put were particularly high-grade

GEXERAL CONFERENCE 



ministers. One of them had already won a distinguished reputation in New 
York and the New England states for his eloquence and piety. Every one of 
them had had unusual success with fashionable congregations. 

"But every one of them had noted an absence of real influence upon the 
hearts of their hearers, and all thought that this same condition is spreading 
throughout the modern pulpit. 

"Yet not cne of them suspected that the profound cause of what they called 
'the decay of faith,' was not in the world of men and women, but in themselves. 
How could such priests of ice warm the souls of men? How could such apostles 
cf interrogation convert a world?" 

THE TESTIMONY OF THE SAINTS 

I rejoice that every Latter-day Saint living can answer without a 
moment's hesitation all three of those questions, "Yes, yes, yes." The 
very foundation of the Church rests upon the fact that a boy not yet 
15 years of age saw God himself, a glorified man, beyond the power of 
any individual to describe, and that God introduced Jesus Christ to this 
boy. The very foundation of the Church rests upon the further fact 
that the man who baptized the Savior of the world, John the Baptist, 
laid his hands upon the heads of Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery and 
ordained them to the Aaronic Priesthood, with the authority to baptize 
each other and commanding them to do so ; that Peter, James and John, 
the apostles of the Lord Jesus Christ, laid their hands upon the heads 
of these men and ordained them to the apostleship, giving to them the 
power to proclaim the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ and build up 
his Church in the world. 

There is no Latter-day Saint that would deny the vision in the Doc- 
trine and Covenants which I have quoted time and time again, and per- 
haps did so at our last conference, stating : 

"And now, after the many testimonies which have been given of him, this is 
the testimony, last of all, which we give of him : That he lives ! 

"For we saw him, even on the right hand of God; and we heard the voice 
bearing record that he is the Only Begotten of the Father — 

"That by him, and through him, and of him, the worlds are and were created, 
and the inhabitants thereof are begotten sons aind daughters unto God." 

MARRIAGE FOR TIME AND ETERNITY 

I rejoice in the fact that every man and every woman married in 
the temples of the Lord are married for time and for all eternity. 
What an absurdity for us to believe in a ceremony uniting our wives to 
us for eternity if there were no existence beyond the grave. 

The Church is also founded upon the fact that Moroni came and 
delivered the plates to Joseph Smith. We have no doubt as to the in- 
dividuality of Moroni who delivered these plates. 

AN ILLUSTRATION, WITH TESTIMONY AND COMMENTS THEREON 

It seems that there are others who lack faith in addition to those 
that I have referred to in my quotation from Senator Beveridge's book. 

Away back in 1910, January 31, Reverend T. H. Martin made some 
very remarkable confessions that were published in the Anaconda 
Standard. A man challenged me. after I had read these statements and 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 



11 



commented upon them, and said I would get myself into trouble because 
it was only a lot of "Mormon" lies ; that no minister ever delivered such 
a sermon, and he warned me to stop or I would get into trouble. The 
warning, however, did not take root nor yield any fruit. The next 
time that I spoke he asked me if I had seen the Anaconda Standard. 
I told him no, but inasmuch as I gave the exact date that it appeared, 
it was up to him to bring an Anaconda Standard and to come and show 
me that it was not in it. The very next time that I saw fit to preach 
upon this subject was in the North Sanpete stake of Zion. After my 
sermon Elder Barrus Cox came to me, and said : 

"Brother Grant, I am the identical elder who sent that Anaconda 
Standard to the Liahona, from which they published extracts. I have 
an extra copy. Would you like it?" 

I told him J needed it in my business, and he gave it to me; so 
I have read this sermon with my own eyes in the Anaconda Standard. 
Reverend Martin said : 

"For a long time the following questions have been uppermost in my mind : 
"Is the church anything but a mere social organization? Is the Christianity 
of today the true doctrine of the Christ of the Bible? Has the so-called Chris- 
tianity of today anything in it that ought to attract more than any other creed 
that is supposed to help humanity? Is not the church of today being boycotted 
and that justly ? 

"I know that such interrogations will not be very savory to many people, but 
knowing something concerning the church from top to bottom, and as I fear God, 
and would rather be true than be esteemed, I fearlessly propound them. * * * 
But with all of this I maintain that the Christianity of the present is face to face 
with a lamentable loss. The Christianity of today has acquired much, but in 
its getting it has lost its own soul, it has lost the Holy Ghost." 

I declare in all soberness that all over the wide world wherever 
the gospel of Jesus Christ has gone, (the gospel revealed to us through 
the Prophet of the living God, Joseph Smith), the Holy Ghost has 
been bestowed upon men and women by the hundreds and thousands, if 
not tens of thousands, and they are willing to testify to their knowledge 
regarding the divinity of this work and to bear witness that God has, 
by the revelations of the Holy Ghost to them, given them a testimony 
of the divinity of this work, also a testimony of the divine mission of 
Joseph Smith and the divinity of the Book of Mormon. 

"No true man will dare to refute this argument, for go where you may in 
Christendom tqday you will find that our religion is void of the supernatural 
clement which the Bible claims it must have in order to exist." 

Go all over the wide world, wherever you will today, and you will 
find that the supernatural element does exist in the Church of Christ. 

"The commission to the early Christian teachers was that they must be im- 
bued with power from on high and then go and baptize all nations in the name 
of the Holy Ghost, and that power was always manifested when they performed 
the deed." 

And that power has been manifested among the Latter-day Saints 
all over the world. 

"The Christian religion of the present is merely a social code and has nothing 



12 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



in it whereby it could claim a divine origin. It is truly pitiable to behold the 
church religion of today trying to save this sinful world. 

"We have lost our magnet. The Christ who said he would draw all men to 
him if he is lifted up is disobeyed and ignored in the multiplicity of our present 
church life. Since we have presented many substitutes to the_ world for genu- 
ine spiritual power, but they are of no more value in the saving of the sinner 
than an artificial heart would be in pumping blood through the arteries. We are 
like men trying to run an engine without steam. 

"The church of today is the church of man, not the church of God. I pre- 
dict its crashing to pieces like a ship on the rocks before a heavy sea, in the 
near-by years, unless there is a mighty turning to God in our ranks." 

I announce to all the world that the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints is in very deed the Church of God, and that there are 
thousands and tens of thousands who have been given this knowledge 
just as absolutely and as perfectly as I have it. 

"We have a great, educated, school-made ministry, but an unconverted 
ministry." 

We have a great converted ministry. I remember on one occa- 
sion preaching in Phoenix, with the late President John Henry Smith. 
The legislature was in session at the time. They called upon us at the 
hotel and asked if we would condescend to preach, stating that they had 
rented the opera house and would crowd it to overflowing. As we were 
in the habit of renting our own houses and generally failing to get an 
audience we very kindly condescended. They fulfilled their pledge. 
The house was crowded to overflowing. Some of the good people came 
from Mesa, about twenty miles away. After the meeting one of the 
Saints told me that a man in front of her, turned to his friend, and, 
with the word "damn," that some people claim is only emphasis and 
not swearing, said with emphasis, "That man is an earnest talker." 
Pretty soon he said, with emphasis, again: "That man is a good 
talker." Pretty soon he said, with double emphasis: "That man be- 
lieves every word he is saying." 

TESTIMONY OF A MINER 

On another occasion I remember being with Elder John Henry 
Smith and Charles W. Penrose in Park City. The opera house was 
filled to overflowing, and men were standing up. Someone after- 
wards told one of our brethren that he heard a man sixteen hundred 
feet under the earth, one of the miners, turn to his friend and say: 
"Did you hear those three 'Mormons' preach?" "Yes." "What did you 
think of it?" "Oh, I did not pay much attention." "Well, I want to say 
to you, away down here sixteen hundred feet in the earth, that what 
those men said rings in my ears. They said, each one of them, they 
knew that God lives, they knew that Jesus is the Christ, the Redeemer 
of the world, the Son of God. They said they knew that Joseph Smith 
was a prophet of God. I have been dropping into their meetings occa- 
sionally since then. They have a little bit of a rented hall but they have 
decided to organize a ward here instead of a branch and to build a 
meeting house, and I have sent ten dollars in an envelope 'from an un- 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 



13 



known friend.' There were no if's, no and's, no but's, about what those 
men said. It was an absolute, direct declaration of their faith." 

KNOWLEDGE COUNTS IN TESTIMONY 

I remember one occasion when a professor, who was studying in 
Berlin in preparation for his doctor's degree, said to my daughter, who 
was there studying the German language, that it was a shame the way 
the three young elders murdered the German language, and how poorly 
they had explained our faith. He said that he had read a hundred tracts 
about our faith and all our Church books, and he would be very glad to 
stand up and deliver a lecture of an hour on the faith of the Latter-day 
Saints and make a fair explanation of it. I was very glad that my 
young daughter gave him to understand that he did not know that God 
lives, that Jesus is the Christ, or that Joseph Smith is a prophet 
of God, and she would prefer to have those young boys who murdered 
the German language declare those three things, than to have some- 
body explain that which he thought was the faith of somebody else. 

It is knowledge that counts. I have had as high as twenty mis- 
sionaries arrive at once in the Liverpool office, scarcely one of whom 
had ever stood upon his feet to say a word about the gospel, and I have 
known the entire lot of them to run out of ideas in less than two hours, 
after I had told them that we sometimes held meetings for five hours, 
and that they would be permitted to speak as long as they desired. Those 
same elders, who did not deliver more than a half dozen sentences, 
have returned to the Liverpool office at the end of two years, and they 
have delivered clear-cut sermons, bearing testimony of the absolute 
knowledge that God had given them of the divinity of the work in which 
we as Latter-day Saints are engaged. 

"We have a great host on our Church rolls, but they are, with but few 
exceptions, an unconverted host." 

We have a converted host. It is very seldom indeed that" any in- 
dividual out in the world receives "Mormonism," the gospel of Jesus 
Christ, except with the opposition of family and friends and relatives. 
Very many young men have been turned out of their homes by their 
parents for embracing the gospel. I could give you incident after in- 
cident where young men and young women have been cast out as a thing 
of evil, by their own parents, for embracing "Mormonism." It is not 
popular. It has never been popular, and nothing short of an absolute 
conversion in the hearts of men and women would lead them to embrace 
the gospel of Jesus Christ. 

"There are periods in the Christian era we look back upon with wonder and 
admiration. In those days men were convicted of sin and a judgment to come." 

In our day men are convicted of sin and a judgment to come, and 
all over the world where that conviction comes into their minds they 
go down into the waters of baptism for the remission of their sins and 
they do receive the Holy Ghost. 

"Then the more than human element was visible in our creeds." 



14 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



The more than human element is visible today in the Church of 
Christ all over the world. 

"Holy men had heavenly visions." 

Holy men and holy women have had heavenly visions by the hun- 
dreds and the thousands in our Church. 

TESTIMONY OF HEALING 
"Sickness was cured by spiritual power." 

I could stand here and relate to you by the hour instances where 
sickness has been cured by spiritual power in this Church of Christ, 
where men and women and children who have been given up to die 
have been healed by the power of Almighty God. I spoke here of 
Brother Joseph W. McMurrin being among those who are absent. 
Brother McMurrin was shot clear through his vitals, and the bullets 
lodged right under the skin on his back. I heard John Henry Smith 
promise that man, when blessing him, by the authority of the apostle- 
.ship of the living God, that he should live and not die, as he had re- 
ceived these wounds while guarding the servants of the living God, and 
that there should be left upon his body no physical weakness because of 
these terrible wounds that he had received. I have it from the lips of 
Brother McMurrin himself that he has never felt any physical weakness 
because of these wounds. 

While relating this incident in the Farmers' ward, upon one 
occasion, Stanley Taylor, the one-armed hackman, arose and said : 
"Brother Grant, it was in my hack that Brother McMurrin was 
picked up and carried to his home. I heard the doctors say : "Take 
his dying statement, because no man ever lived who was in such a 
condition." But he did live. Right at that identical time a man 
was shot in this city, with one bullet through him, exactly where 
the twp went through Brother McMurrin, and he died on time. 

The very last time that I had the pleasure of conversing with 
President Joseph F. Smith, except the night before he died, he 
said : 

"Heber, I never saw you looking better. I recall that as I was 
in the hospital when you were operated upon, the chief surgeon, Dr. 
Allen Fowler, turned to me and said : 'Mr. Smith you don't need 
to discuss the possibility or the probability of this man living. He 
has to die. It would be a miracle if he were restored to health, and 
this is not the day of miracles.' " 

I give to the Lord Almighty the credit and the glory, for it is 
by his power that I am here today. There were nine doctors pres- 
ent when I was operated upon, and eight of them said I had to die. 
The nurse told me this the day I was leaving the hospital. I said : 
"I have no desire to meet the eight, but I would like to meet the 
ninth, the one who said I would live." I asked him why he dis- 
agreed with all the other doctors. He was a southerner and he 
said : "Mr. Grant, I just took a chance, sir. I have felt the pulse of 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRAXT 



15 



thousands of gentlemen in my life, but I never felt a pulse just like 
yours, sir. That heart of yours never missed one, single, solitary beat 
during the one hour and three-quarters, sir, that you were under 
the knife, and I said to myself : 'that heart will pull him through' ; 
so I just took a chance." 

ON OBSERVING THE WORD OF WISDOM — ANOTHER TESTIMONY 

We have in our Doctrine and Covenants a revelation which 
says : 

"There is a law, irrevocably decreed in heaven before the foundations of 
tin's world, upon which all blessings are predicated — 

"And when we obtain any blessing from God, it is by obedience to that law 
upon which it is predicated." 

One of the laws of the Gospel of Jesus Christ is that each and 
every Latter-day Saint shall keep what is known as the Word of 
Wisdom ; that we shall abstain from tea, coffee, tobacco and liquor. 
Had I not lived the Word of Wisdom, had my blood not been pure. 
I am convinced beyond the shadow of a doubt that I would not have 
been entitled to that wonderful promise contained in the Word of 
Wisdom, that those who obey this Word of Wisdom shall be 
blessed, and that the destroying angel shall pass them by as he did 
the children of Israel and not slay them. I am convinced that my 
heart would not have had pure blood, had I not fulfilled the law, 
and I would not be standing here before you today. 

Upon one occasion when my brother, Joseph Hyrum Grant, 
(who in later years, presided over the Davis stake of Zion) was in 
charge of a livery stable in this city, a number of employes of the 
Z. C. M. I. shoe factory were enjoying an outing at Calder's Park, 
now known as Nibley Park. My brother who had charge of the 
transportation, called their attention to the fact that a storm was 
threatening, and he urged them to return home, stating that a part 
of the road between the park and Salt Lake City was a turnpike and 
there was danger of this long drag being overturned in a storm and 
in the darkness. But they passed a resolution that they would hold 
the firm blameless if any accident occurred. 

Going home in the darkness the vehicle was overturned and 
several people were quite seriously injured. One of the girls had 
a number of bones broken and as a result of her injuries and ex- 
posure in the storm, pneumonia set in. The doctor in attendance 
declared that she could not live, and would probably die before 
morning. My brother felt very much distressed about the matter, 
having been the driver of the vehicle. He asked me to go with him 
to administer to that girl, stating that he had received the witness 
of the spirit that she should live. 

When we stepped up to the bed, I told him that she was dying 
and would be dead before we could get our hands off her head. He 
turned deathly pale and declared that he had received a manifesta- 
tion of the Lord, and that he knew, as he knew that the gospel is 



16 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



true, that if we would bless her she would live. We did bless her, 
and in confirming the anointing I was impressed to promise her 
that the bones should knit, that she should be made well and go 
back and run her machine in the Z. C. M. I. shoe factory. I did 
not know that she had been running a machine or what was her 
work. That evening I met the superintendent of that factory and 
he said : "I have just returned from the home of Marie DeGray, 
and she was dying. I am convinced she is dead by now." I said : 
"Brother Rowe, you go up into your office and sit down and write : 
'Marie DeGray is not dead. Marie DeGray will not die, but she 
will get well and come back and run her machine in your factory.' 
It has been manifested to me by the spirit of the living God." He 
said : "I don't need to write it, because from what you say, I know 
that she will live." 

STILL ANOTHER TESTIMONY OF THE HEALING POWER 

He then related to me an incident which had occurred in his 
own family. Said he: "In London, before I came to this country, 
one of my daughters was very sick, and the attending physician 
said she could not live till morning." He sent, as I remember, three 
miles across the great city of London, for Junius F. Wells and his 
companion to come and administer to his daughter, and she was 
restored to health. "The next day," said Brother Rowe. "the doc- 
tor came to my home and handed me a written certificate, duly 
signed, stating that my daughter was dead. I invited him} into the 
parlor and introduced him to the 'corpse.' So when you tell me that 
this girl will recover, I accept your statement, for I know that the 
healing power of God is in this Church, as well as I know that I 
live." 

TESTIMONY OF THE GIFT OF TONGUES 

"Holy men spoke with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance." 

Holy men and holy women have spoken with other tongues, as 
the spirit has given them utterance. One of our Articles of Faith 
reads : 

"We believe in the gift of tongues," and in the interpretation 
thereof. Karl G. Maeser — than whom no more devoted Latter- 
day Saint ever lived — told me with his own lips of such an incident 
as I took a trip with him to Baker City. He said : "Brother Grant, 
the night that I was baptized I looked up into heaven and said : 
'Oh, God, I have found, as I believe, the gospel of thy Son Jesus 
Christ. I have rendered obedience to it by going down into the 
waters of baptism. Give to me a manifestation, give to me an 
absolute witness of the spirit that I have found the truth, and I 
pledge to you if necessary my life for the advancement of this 
cause.' " 

At that time Brother Franklin D. Richards was president of 
the European mission, with headquarters at Liverpool. He went 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 



17 



over to Germany to be present at the baptism of the first converts 
to the gospel in that great empire. Walking from the place where 
he was baptized to his home, a distance of several miles, Brother 
Maeser expressed a desire to converse upon different principles of 
the gospel, through an interpreter. That interpreter was Brother 
William Budge, afterwards president of Bear Lake stake, and 
finally president of the Logan temple. Brother Maeser, who under- 
stood no English, asked questions in German, and Brother Rich- 
ards, who understood no German, answered them in English ; 
Brother Budge interpreting the questions and answers. After a few 
questions had been asked and answered through the interpreter, 
Brother Richards said : "Do not interpret those questions, I un- 
derstand them ;" then Brother Maeser said : "Do not interpret 
those answers, I understand them." They conversed for miles, the 
questions in German, the answers in English ; neither man under- 
standing the language of the other. They arrived at the River 
Elbe and while crossing the bridge they were separated ; when they 
reached the other side Brother Maeser asked another question, and 
Brother Richards said: "Interpret it, Brother Budge." When the 
answer came, Brother Maeser said : "Interpret it." His next ques- 
tion was : "How was it, Apostle Richards, that we understood each 
other, and now we cannot understand?" Brother Richards told 
him that one of the fruits of the gospel of Jesus Christ was the 
gift of tongues and the interpretation. Then he said : "God has 
given to you and to me this night the privilege of partaking of one 
of the fruits of the gospel by having the interpretation of tongues. 
Brother Maeser, you have received a witness from God that you 
- have found the truth." 

Brother Maeser told >me : "I trembled like a leaf, and I again 
raised my eyes to heaven and said : 'Oh, God, I have received the 
witness that I asked for, and I pledge to you my life, if need be, for 
this cause.' " 

Every Latter-day Saint knows that Karl G. Maeser did give his 
life ; that he labored without ceasing, without any thought of per- 
sonal advancement, personal honor or credit, but he labored untir- 
ingly for the advancement of God's kingdom at home and abroad, 
as a missionary in his native land, and at the head of our great 
educational system. 

TESTIMONY OF PROPHECY THROUGH THE GIFT OF TONGUES 

When I was a child, in a Relief Society meeting, Eliza R. Snow, 
by the gift of tongues, and Zina D. Young, by the interpretation 
thereof, promised that child playing on the floor — in the home 
where Grandma Whitney, my mother, Eliza R. Snow, Zina D. 
Young, Clara Kimball and other leading Relief Society sisters in 
early days were meeting — that that child should grow to man- 
hood and become an apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ. My mother 
often said tor me '. "Heber, behave yourself, and you will some day 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



be one of the apostles in the Church." I always laughed at her and 
said : "Get it out of your head. Every mother thinks her son will 
be the president of the United States or something wonderful. I 
have no ambitions in that regard." 

When I was called to be one of the apostles she asked me if I 
remembered that meeting in the home of the late William C. 
Staines on the corner of South Temple and Fifth East. I told her 
I did. "Do you remember anything that was said?" I replied: 
"No." "Well," she said, "do you remember Aunt Eliza talking to 
you on the floor?" I said. "Yes, but I did not understand it." 

"Of course, you did not, because she spoke by the gift of tongues." 
Then she said : "Do you remember anything that Aunt Zina said?" 
"Yes. I do. mother. I remember that she lifted her hand and said 
that I would become a great big man." 

So when I became tall I used to think of it occasionally, that 
Aunt Zina said I would be a big man. My mother responded : "She 
said nothing of the kind ; she said you would be a great big man in 
the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, that you would be 
an apostle." That is why I have told you, knowing that the gift of 
tongues was in the Church. 

I wish to say to you that my wife, who is dead, prom|ised me, 
by the gift of tongues, that I should live to proclaim this gospel in 
many lands and in many climes, and after she passed away, and at 
a time when eight doctors out of nine said I had to die, I had not 
then proclaimed this gospel "in many lands and in many climes," but 
I recovered, and since then I have lifted up my voice in the far-off land 
of Japan, in the Hawaiian Islands, in England, Ireland, Scotland, Wales, 
Germany, France, Belgium, Holland. Switzerland, Norway, Sweden, 
Denmark, Canada and Mexico, bearing witness that I know that God 
lives, that I know that Jesus is the Christ, that I know that Joseph Smith 
was a prophet of the true and the living God, and tha*. every gift, 
every grace, every power that this man says should be in the true 
Church of Christ, is in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints. We have the Pearl of Great Price, the gospel of the Lord 
Jesus Christ. 

That God may help me and you and every soul within the 
sound of my voice who has a testimony of the divinity of this Gos- 
pel of Christ so to live it that other men, seeing our devotion and 
seeing our integrity and our determination to live the lives of saints 
may be inspired to investigate the message that we have to bear to 
them, is my prayer, and I ask it in all humility, and in the name of 
the Lord Jesus Christ, our Redeemer and Savior. Amen.

PRESIDENT ANTHONY W. IVINS 

My heart is full of gratitude and praise to the Lord, my brethren 
and sisters, as I stand befqre this vast congregation and observe what 
President Nibley just called my attention to, that it is made up largely 
of men. As I think of it, it would appear almost unnecessary that I 
express the thoughts which I desired to present to you. I shall read 
first from the words of the Prophet Zechariah, as I wish to make his 
words the basis of the brief remarks that I expect to make. 

SPEAK THE TRUTH 

"These are the things that ye shall do ; Speak ye every man the truth to 
his neighbor; execute the judgment of truth and peace in your gates: 

"And let none of you imagine evil in your hearts against his neighbor ; and 
love no false oath : for all these are things that I hate, saith the Lord." 
(Zechariah 8:16-17.) 

THE CHURCH CRITICISED 

It is now nearly one hundred years since the organization of the 
Church of Jesus Christ was effected. Three years hence and a century 
will have elapsed since that event occurred. From the time of its organ- 
ization the Church, and those who make up its membership, have been 
misunderstood and misrepresented. 

The Church has been referred to as an organization founded upon 
a pernicious superstition and delusion, and the man who was chosen 
to be the instrument in the hands of the Lord in the opening of the pres- 
ent gospel dispensation and organization of the Church, as either a 
wilful imposter or a deluded incompetent. 

Those who have identified themselves with the Church, and make 
up its membership, have been accused of establishing a new form of 
religion, a religion founded upon Mosaic law, following the creed of 
Islam, rather than the gospel plan as it was taught by the Redeemer of 
the world. They have been ridiculed, abused and persecuted, in some 
instances unto death. 

At this period in the history of the Church, after its doctrines have 
been before the world for a century, and its history and accomplish- 
ments are, or should be, well understood, it would be supposed that these 
criticisms and misrepresentations would have ceased, and it is obvious 
that where they are resorted to, it is the result either of inexcusable 
ignorance, or wilful desire to deceive those who are not well informed 
as to the truth, which in either case would be wrong, because no one is 
justified in sitting in judgment upon another where the merits of the 
case are not understood, and wilfully to misrepresent the truth is a 
very grave offense. 

That the campaign of misrepresentation, ridicule and abuse, the 
methods to which people always resort, when reason and argument fail, 
is still being vigorously prosecuted is evidenced by the following to 
which I desire to call your attention. These clippings from which I 



20 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



am about to read are only a few from the many which I have collected 
during the past year. 

AN EXAMPLE 

"There are many signs," this speaker says, "having the appear- 
ance of being hopeful that the old 'Mormondom' known in the days of 
Brigham Young is crumbling and that a new system slightly nearer the 
Christian ideal is being built up. Many 'Mormons,' not of the old 
school, no longer regard Joseph Smith as a prophet with a mission 
from God, which Joseph Smith claimed, and many do not accept the 
present heads of the Church as called of God. The present leaders of 
the Church would nor. dare to represent themselves as the mouthpiece 
of God to the membership. Apostasy among the male portion of the 
membership is growing fast, and the Church would have been bankrupt 
seven years ago if it were not for the women and children who alone pay 
tithes." 

The speaker held up to ridicule certain of the "Mormon" pioneers 
and made fun of what he deemed as the superstition of the "Mormon" 
doctrines. The alleged betrayal of women by "Mormons" was de- 
picted as were methods which he declared existed early in Southern 
Utah history where the "Mormons" hurled Gentiles from the- cliffs. 
The audience which listened to these remarks loudly applauded them. 

A REPLY TO THE ACCUSATIONS 

If these statements were true, my brethren and sisters, there might 
be some justification for the hope expressed by the minister who ut- 
tered them that the bulwarks of the Church are crumbling, that the 
time is coming, and is not far distant, when it will collapse, and the 
fond hopes of those who have opposed it from the beginning will be 
realized. But fortunately for the Church, and unfortunately for those 
who oppose it, this is not the case. 

THE LATTER-DAY SAINTS A CHRISTIAN COMMUNITY 

The inference that the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints 
is not a Christian organization is too absurd to require any extended 
comment. The foundation upon which the Church rests is faith in 
God the eternal Father, his Son Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost, 
which constitute the God-head. The Church teaches and its members 
testify that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, that by him the worlds 
were created, and that through the redemption wrought out, because 
of the atonement which he made, all mankind are redeemed from death, 
the penalty which was pronounced upon our father Adam because of 
transgression, and that through obedience to the doctrines which he 
taught we may be redeemed from personal sin. We bear witness to 
the world that there is no other name under heaven, nor is there any 
other means by which man can attain to glory, exaltation and eternal 
life except through the medium of Christ our Lord. 



PRESIDENT ANTHONY W. IVINS 



21 



APOSTASY NOT GROWING 

If apostasy is growing fast we are not aware of it, and the careful 
record which is kept of those who become members of the Church, and 
those who withdraw from it, would certainly provide this information 
were it true. It is true that not all who obey the gospel and identify 
themselves with the Church remain steadfast in the faith, and it has 
always been so, but there are fewer in number who go back to the world 
and its devious paths than in the early history of the Church. A net 
cast into the sea, the Savior says, gathers fish of all kinds, and the 
Church in this dispensation does not differ from the Primitive Church 
in that respect. 

TITHES ARE PAID BY MEN AND WOMEN 

If the statement that only women and children pay tithes, and but 
for thern the Church would have been bankrupt seven years ago is true, 
the women and children are entitled to great credit, for it chanced just 
at the time that this statement was made that the tithes paid showed 
greater returns for the year than ever before in the history of the 
Church. 

STRONG BELIEF IN THE DIVINE MISSION OF JOSEPH SMITH 

If it is true, as stated, that the members of the Church no longer 
regard Joseph Smith as a prophet, with a message from God to the 
people of the world, and that the men who preside over the Church 
are no longer recognized as the mouthpiece of the Lord to the mem- 
bership, then indeed are we without hope, for we are immediately re- 
duced to the c'ondition of these critics. The Lord has declared that 
where there is no revelation and prophecy the people perish. 

Never before since the organization of the Church has there been 
such overwhelming proof of the divine calling of the prophet Joseph 
Smith, and the inspiration of his successors in office as at the present 
time, for the past century has not proved him, or them, to have been 
wrong, while it has added greatly to the evidence which existed at the 
time the Church was founded, both from a scriptural and historical 
point of view to prove that he was divinely called to do the work which 
he accomplished. 

PROPHECIES ON THE LATTER-DAY DISPENSATION 

During his personal ministry but few people accepted Jesus Christ 
as the Son of God and Redeemer of the world. Notwithnstanding the 
fact that the Jewish people were looking forward to the coming of 
their Messiah, they rejected Christ, and have vainly looked forward for 
the coming of another since the time of his appearing. Another has 
not come, and will not come until he shall return to reign in power, 
majesty and dominion upon the earth. Then, and not until then, will 
Judah fully appreciate the error of his rejection. 

Just as definitely as the prophets had foretold the coming of the 



22 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Christ, and the work which he was to accomplish, the greatest accom- 
plishment since the creation of man, for it involved the redemption of 
mankind from the fallen condition into which transgression had plunged 
them, so definitely did they foretell the coming of another epochal 
event, second only to the appearance of the Messiah himself. 

The time of its accomplishment was at a period referred to as the 
latter days, a time when spiritual darkness would cover the earth, and 
gross darkness the minds of the people. A time when the laws of the 
gospel of Christ would be transgressed, the ordinances of his Church 
changed, and the everlasting covenant broken. 

At this time, when these conditions prevailed, the Lord, just prior 
to his crucifixion, declared to his disciples that a light would break forth 
among those who sit in darkness, which light would be the fulness of his 
everlasting gospel, a light which the people of the world at large would 
not perceive, and from which they would turn because of the precepts 
of men. 

John, the beloved disciple of our Lord, looking forward to that 
time, tells us that the opening of this greatest of all gospel dispensa- 
tions, greatest because the Lord has said that in it he will gather all 
things together in one, and consummate his work, would be ushered in by 
an angel whom he saw flying through the midst of heaven having the 
everlasting gospel to preach to them that dwell upon the earth, to every 
nation, kindred, tongue and people. 

While the primary purpose of this restoration was to prepare the 
world for the second coming of the Redeemer, and bring all people, 
Jew and Gentile, atheist, infidel and professed Christian, to recognition 
of Christ as the Redeemer of the world, and submission to his will, 
there were certain well defined purposes to be accomplished before this 
is to be consummated. 

Scattered Israel is to be gathered and established in the land given 
to them to be an everlasting inheritance, in accordance with the promise 
made by the Lord to Abraham, and repeated to his sons Isaac and Jacob. 
The promise sealed upon the head of Joseph, the son of Jacob, when 
the latter sealed the heirship of that branch upon the head of Ephraim, 
and extended the promise which had already been made to the utmost 
bounds of the everlasting hills, a promise which is being fulfilled, as 
witnessed in the coming together of this great congregation, whose 
genealogy traces direct to Ephraim. Judah is to re-possess Palestine, 
the Promised Land of his fathers. The mountain of the Lord's house 
is to be established in the top of the mountains, and be exalted above 
the hills, and many people are to be gathered to it in order that they 
may be taught the way of the Lord, and learn to walk in his paths. 

The prophet Isaiah, speaking of the House of Israel, says : 

"Thou shalt be brought down, and shalt speak out of the ground, and thy 
speech shall be low out of the dust, and thy voice shall be, as of one that hath a 
familiar spirit, out of the ground, and thy speech shall whisper out of the dust. 
* * And the vision of all is become unto you as the words of a book that is 



PRESIDENT ANTHONY IV. IVINS

sealed, which men deliver to one that is learned, saying, Read this, I pray thee : 
and he saith, I cannot ; for it is sealed : 

"And the book is delivered to him that is not learned, saying, Read this, I 
pray thee : and he saith, I am not learned. Wherefore the Lord said, Forasmuch 
as this people draw near me with their mouth, and with their lips do honor me. 
but have removed their hearts far from ine, and their fear toward me is taught 
by the precept of men : 

"Therefore, behold, I will proceed to do a marvelous work among this peo- 
ple, even a marvelous work and a wonder : for the wisdom of their wise men shall 
perish, and the understanding of their prudent men shall be hid." 

Referring to the same period the prophet Ezekiel says : 

"Moreover, thou son of man, take thee one stick, and write upon it, For Judah, 
and for the children of Israel his companions : then take another stick, and write 
upon it, For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim, and for all the house of Israel his com- 
panions : And join them one to another into one stick; and they shall become 
one in thine hand." 

THE PROPHECIES FULFILLED 

If the events, to which the scripture, to which I have referred, 
have not occurred, if Ephraim is not being gathered to the tops of the 
mountains, where they are being taught the way of the Lord that they 
may walk in his paths, if the Jews are not beginning to re-possess Pal- 
estine, the Promised land, if the house of Israel has not been brought 
down, and has spoken low out of the dust, with the voice of a familiar 
spirit, if an angel has not restored the everlasting gospel to be preached 
to all nations, if the record of Judah and of Ephraim have not come 
together for the purpose of uniting the entire Israelitish family, if 
these things have not occurred I say, then we must look to the future 
for their accomplishment, for they are the unchangeable decrees of the 
Lord, and his word never fails. 

The Lord has said that the record which was delivered to Joseph 
Smith, and which was translated by him, and published to the world as 
the Book of Mormon, was the record of the stick of Ephraim. The 
Bible is the record of the hand-dealing of the Lord with the House of 
Judah. The two have been brought together to the confounding of 
false doctrine, both bearing witness, as they do, to the divine mission of 
Christ our Lord. 

When the keys of the Lesser Priesthood were conferred upon 
Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery, and later the Melchizedek Priest- 
hood under the hands of Peter, James and John, the words of John 
the divine were fulfilled, for authority was restored to earth to preach 
the gospel in its fulness, and administer all of the ordinances of the 
Church. 

OUR CLAIM, TESTIMONY AND APPEAL 

The restored Church has never resorted to ridicule, abuse or mis- 
representation. It has never persecuted any person because of his or 
her religious belief, nor any person because he had no religious con- 



24 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



victions. it is true that its members have been drawn from other 
denominations, and from among people who were not professors of re- 
ligion at all. We pray for all men who seek to do good, for it is a part 
of our creed that everything which is good, or induces men to do good 
cometh of God. 

We do, however, claim the right to carry the message of the re- 
stored gospel to all men ; it is our mission, as it was the mission of the 
disciples of Christ. Go ye into all the world, he said to his disciples, 
and preach the gospel to every creature, he that believeth and is bap- 
tized shall be saved, but he that believeth not shall be damned. 

We bear testimony to all people that Joseph Smith was divinely 
called to the work which he accomplished. That he was not an im- 
poster, but a chosen vessel of the Lord. That he did receive the plates 
which contained the record of the Book of Mormon, and translated them 
by the gift and power of God. We do not expect all people to accept 
the message which we bear, it would be contrary to prophecy if they 
did. 

We do, however, appeal to those who differ from us to speak the 
truth, that honest men and women be not led astray by their sophistry 
and misrepresentations. Time will determine who is right, and we abide 
the verdict of the future for our vindication. 

May the Lord our God keep us all in the path of truth, righteous- 
ness, and virtue, I humbly pray, through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

Telephone calls from various parts of the state report exceptionally 
fine radio reception this morning. Reports from Provo are to the 
effect that the lower floor of the Provo tabernacle is crowded and the 
people are hearing every word. 

The Tabernacle choir sang, "The Inflammatus," Laurinda 
Brewerton, soloist. 

The closing prayer was offered by Elder H. Melvin Rollins, presi- . 
dent of the Lyman stake. 

The conference adjourned until 2 p. m. 



AFTERNOON MEETING 

President Heber J. Grant, promptly at 2 o'clock p. m., announced 
that the choir and congregation would sing the hymn, "The Spirit of 
God like a fire is burning." 

After the singing the invocation was offered by Elder James 
Robert Price, president of the Maricopa stake of Zion. 
The choir sang the anthem, "Grant us peace."

PRESIDENT CHARLES W. NIBLEY 

Here is a printed card of radio instructions which reads, The speaker 
is to speak in a conversational tone. He must not shout, he must not 
get too far away from this little microphone — "Little Mike," as they 
call it — and he must not strike the pulpit because this fellow objects to 
being jarred. 

The thought occurred to me that probably in a short time instruc- 
tions will be given advising the speaker not to speak too loud because 
the natives of Australia or the natives of Africa, listening in, haven't 
the same kind of ear-drums as ours, and you may hurt them. 

Such may be the developments of science. 

THE SAINTS BETTER UNDERSTOOD 

I have been interested in the proceedings of this conference. I am 
delighted to see this magnificent audience, notwithstanding the rain 
storm. It takes more than xain to keep the Latter-day Saints from a 
conference. We have heard of those who criticize this work, and we 
have seen all through our lives the opposition that has been manifested 
to it. This opposition, however, is being overcome by the gradual 
growth and spread of intelligence and knowledge regarding us, so that 
we are becoming better understdod and appreciated. 

PERSISTENCE OF THE CHURCH 

From the very beginning the world has been at a loss to account 
for "Mormonism." Only the other day we had in the President's of- 
fice a distinguished visitor. • He said he had been at our tabernacle, en- 
joyed our services, noted the class of people; and what he had heard 
and seen, including his observation of the developments that were be- 
ing made here by the Church, and the people of the Church, had im- 
pressed upon his mind the thought that there was something more to 
this than he had ever imagined. 

In the days of the prophet, when he was laying the foundations of 
this great work, he had few friends indeed. On every hand he met ridi- 
cule, contumely, hatred, persecution, mobbing, tar and feathers. All 
through his life such was his portion and you can easily understand 
how painful it was to endure it. Surely he did not get much out of 
it in a worldly way, and yet he stood firm, and accomplished the work 
which the Lord gave him to do. It was said in his day : "This man 
Joseph Smith is something of a marvel. He is a leader. He carries 
people with him, but when he dies, that will be the end of 'Mormon- 
ism.' " Well, he was martyred with his brother; the Saints were driven, 
and a new leader — Brigham Young — took hold of the reins. 

I recall very well, as a boy in Brigham City, working in the hotel, 
when, noted travelers stayed there — railroad builders — such men as 
Stanford, Huntington and others of that class. I heard them discuss- 
ing this very point. I was only 19 years of age, but I kept my ears open. 



26 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



They marveled at the wonderful capacity of Brigham Young as a 
leader, but they concluded — and that rather surprised me — they con- 
cluded that when Brigham Young should die, that would be the end of 
the whole thing ; it would all go to pieces. 

Well, it will be 50 years this very year since Brigham Young died. 
We have had five presidents since that time. President Grant being the 
fifth, and still this thing called "Mormonism" persists. Not only so, 
but it is greater today than it ever was. It is more powerful, has more 
influence. It is richer, it is stronger in faith, and more potent in every 
way for good, for righteousness, than ever before since the day that the 
prophet had the first great manifestation from heaven. 

THE POWER THAT LEADS AND GUIDES 

What power is it that brings you here? I never saw a congrega- 
tion like this anywhere else in the world. Religious congregations which 
I have attended elsewhere are very largely composed of ladies, not men. 
Our good sisters more naturally take to spiritual longings and spiritual 
life than men do. In religious circles everywhere else the ladies pre- 
dominate. But look at this congregation. Here you see strong, virile, 
hard-headed, forward-looking, determined men. They know what they 
are about. They are cultured, they are well read. They have traveled 
as missionaries more than any other people have traveled. So that I 
say they are better informed, more cultured, and have had more advan- 
tages of education which comes from travel than any body of men that 
can be picked in any state or territory of all the United States. Hence 
they are not the kind of people who can be misled. They are not mis- 
informed. On the contrary, they know what they are about. 

What power, then, what mysterious power is it that has led and 
guided them and that still leads and guides them and holds them to- 
gether as they are held? Let me tell you what it is. I will read from 
the book of Doctrine and Covenants, Section 84 : 

"And this greater priesthood administereth the gospel and holdeth the key 
of the mysteries of the kingdom, even the key of the knowledge of Gcd. 

"Therefore, in the ordinances thereof, the power of godliness is. manifest. 

"And without the ordinances thereof, and the authority of the priesthood, 
the power of godliness is not manifest unto man in the flesh." 

That is what holds these people together — the power of the priest- 
hood. And in the administration of it we have seen and do see the 
power of godliness; not a form of godliness, mind you, but the power 
of godliness. Paul said that in the latter days men would be "having 
a form of godliness but denying trfe power thereof ;" but what I refer 
to is the power of godliness. Have you ever seen it manifested in your 
lives? We heard of it this morning from the leader of the Church as 
manifested in the healing of the sick. We see it in the temples of the 
Lord; we see it in the sick rooms; we see it manifested in presidencies 
cf stakes, bishoprics of wards. 

In all the leadership of the priesthood you see that same power of 
godliness. This is a little different from the overruling and general 



PRESIDENT CHARLES W. NIBLEY 



27 



power of God that is over all nations and peoples. "He hath made of 
one blood all nations for to dwell on the face of the earth and fixed 
the bounds of their habitations." That is the overruling power of God 
in all nations. We can trace it readily in this nation from the days of 
Washington, and even before, down to the present day. The power of 
God is with this nation. But this power of the Priesthood, that the Lord 
defines in this scripture that I have read, is just a little different. It 
is the power of godliness, of godly lives. It is the power of godly men 
and godly women, through the ordinances of the Priesthood made mani- 
fest ; and everyone shares in it. 

WE HAVE THE WORDS OF ETERNAL LIFE 

If I should ask you high priests, seventies, elders, priests, teachers 
and deacons, who hold the priesthood, to arise, it would be seen that 
practically every one here holds the Priesthood, which, as I have read 
to you, contains and holds and reveals the key of the knowledge of 
God. That is what the world lacks, that is what they haven't got. 

President Ivins told us this morning about those people who have 
passed resolutions against us, and who say there is going to be a great 
apostasy, there is little or no tithing paid, and all that. Why, I have 
heard that sort of stuff all my life. It is not worth listening to. They 
say "These 'Mormon' people will get rid of all that foolishness, and 
those visions and the Book of Mormon, and prophets, and they will 
come over to us." Come over to you ! What in the name of common 
sense have you to offer? Husks — merely a form of godliness — no 
power in it ; never was, never will be. It isn't there. We are sorry for 
you, brothers. We would be glad to help you. We have no ill will, no 
ill feelings ; but when you talk of our leaving what we know we have, 
and going over to you — oh, please don't mention it. We can say as Peter 
said to the Savior, when many could not stand the strong doctrine that 
the Savior laid down. I will quote : 

"From that time many of his disciples went hack, and walked no more 
with him. 

"Then said Jesus unto the Twelve, Will ye also go away? 

"Then Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go? Thou hast 
the words of eternal life. 

"And we believe and are sure that thou art that Christ, the Son of the living 
God." 

That is what we have here — "the words of eternal life," the power 
of godliness made manifest to men in the flesh. Do you see that power 
of godliness made manifest anywhere else in the world? Look around 
you and see if you can find it. I haven't seen it elsewhere, but I do 
know it is here. I see it here every day of my life. I have seen this 
power made manifest in the mission field very often. 

THE MISSIONARY AND HIS FLOCK 

Only the other day I received a letter from a young missionary in 
a foreign country, and he told me he had often heard the elders who 



28 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



returned from missions say that about the hardest part of their mission 
was to leave their field of labor. He said : "I never believed them, but 
last night we held a meeting at which Elder So and So was presiding, 
and now I know it is true." 

This elder had been released to return home. He had built up a 
little branch of some twenty members in the two or three years that 
he had been there. They were his flock. They had partaken of his 
spirit. He had brought them from darkness into light. For, let me tell 
you, darkness covers the earth today, spiritual darkness, in the absence 
of the knowledge of God. People do not know it, but darkness covers 
the earth and gross darkness the minds of the people. This is a light 
shining in darkness, and the darkness comprehendeth it not. They do 
not know it, but it is here just as truly as the Savior said it would be. 
And so this young man, when bidding adieu to his little flock, told them 
how he had been called on that mission; how keenly his parents had 
felt to see him leave home, because of the tenderness and love in their 
hearts for him : how it had taken of his means very considerably to go 
there and stay two years and more; and what joy he had had, notwith- 
standing all the sacrifices, in bringing that little flock into the fold. 

They had partaken of the Priesthood and the key of the knowledge 
of God, and now he was to leave them. They had in their hearts bound- 
less gratitude towards him. They were in tears ;he was in tears with them. 
That was the spirit of sacrifice and the spirit of godliness, the power 
of godliness, made manifest before that people. I mention this to show 
that it exists in the mission field and here at home, where we work for 
it, just as strongly as it ever did in the history of the Church. 

THE PRIESTHOOD THE POWER THAT LEADS 

Let me read just another portion of this same revelation. By the 
way, this revelation was given in 1832, when some of the first elders 
had returned from short missions and were telling of this very kind of 
experience to the prophet, and he inquired of the Lord and received 
this revelation: 

"For whoso is faithful unto the obtaining these two priesthoods of which I 
have spoken, and the magnifying their calling (don't forget that, brethren) are 
sanctified by the spirit unto the renewing of their bodies. 

"T he y become the sons of Moses and of Aaron and the seed of \braham 
and the church and kingdom, and the elect of God. 

''And also all they who receive this priesthood receive me, saith the Lord ■ 
ror he that receiveth my servants receiveth me; 

"And he that receiveth me receiveth my father ; ' 

I "^ww 6 tha l r t ceiv , eth u m l Father receiveth my Father's kingdom; there- 
lore all that my Father hath shall be given unto him. 

hood" And thiS acCOrding to the oath and covenan t which belongeth to the priest- 

"Therefore all those who receive the priesthood, receive this oath and cove- 
nant of my Father, which he cannot break, neither can it be moved." 

That is the power that leads and governs this Church if the people 
want to know it. That is what brings you here; that is what holds 
you together. That is what impels us to go on missions and <Wve of 



PRESIDENT CHARLES W. NIBLEY

our lives to the work. These people say, "We will call these 'Mormons' 
over and they will come to us." I think of the words of Hamlet in the 
play : "Could you this fair mountain leave to feed and batten on 
this moor?" I don't think so. They won't get many. 

THE POWER OF THE PRIESTHOOD PARAMOUNT 

Now, my friends, just one word and I close. I am glad to know 
of the great work that is done by the Boy Scouts. Splendid! I 
hope it will be kept up. But I would like to say to you presidents of 
stakes and bishops — bishops especially, for they preside over the lesser 
priesthood: In all the fine work of the Boy Scouts, don't forget the 
deacons' quorums, nor the teachers, nor the priests. We approve of the 
good work that is done in other directions. "If there is anything 
lovely, of good report or praiseworthy, we seek after these things." 
They are a part of our religion. But let it be understood now and for- 
ever in our hearts that the paramount thing is the power of the priest- 
hood of the Son of God, the knowledge of God ; for the Savior himself 
said : "And this is life eternal, that they might know thee, the only 
true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent." 

A man is spiritually alive who has that knowledge. We have it 
and we can keep it if we will magnify our callings. Therefore, magnify 
the Priesthood, glorify the priesthood from the president of the Church 
down to the last deacon. Amen. 



ELDER JOHN A. WIDTSOE 

My brethren and sisters, I have enjoyed greatly the proceedings of 
this conference ; the valiant testimony of our President, and the splendid 
analysis of present-day conditions by President Ivins this morning, and 
the declaration of unshakable faith by President Nibley, this afternoon. 
I bear testimony to the truth of that which has been spoken. 

AN EVIDENCE OF THE GENUINENESS OF THE WORK 

It is an evidence of the genuineness of this work, that we can 
gather here in large numbers, from conference to conference, to hear 
taught the same, simple principles. They must be true, otherwise we 
would not be satisfied to come here, time and time again, to hear ex- 
pounded the few, easily understood truths of the gospel. If a man eat 
good wholesome food regularly, his body is kept in good condition and 
he feels well; physical happiness is his. If he has access to truth, ac- 
cepts it and practices it regularly, he becomes spiritually contented. So 
I feel that these great gatherings, continually growing in numbers and 
importance, form a mighty evidence of the correctness of the latter-day 
work, established through the instrumentality of Joseph Smith the 
Prophet. 

I am glad to know that obedience to the principles of the gospel is 
not beyond my reach. A few principles, relatively, constitute the gos- 
pel of Jesus Christ ; they are given for the definite purpose of bringing 



30 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



happiness and joy to man in this life and in the life hereafter, it is 
possible for a man to obey all of them. The Lord has so ordained it 
that, in giving his spiritual laws, they are within the easy comprehension 
rind full power of all honest men and women. 

WE SHOULD PRACTICE ALL THE PRINCIPLES OF THE GOSPEL 

I should like to impress upon the Latter-day Saints that we must, 
as a body of worshipers, receivers of the Latter-day truth, accept and 
practice as best we can all the principles of the gospel. I observe a tend- 
ency to make a selection of the principles of the gospel, and to say: 
"This one I like and shall practice; that one I am not so thoroughly 
converted to, and I shall not practice it." The object of the gospel, hu- 
man happiness, may be won only if one practices completely the set of 
laws and principles which we call the gospel of Jesus Christ. 

Let me draw a comparison from the physical world. The white 
light that comes from the sun is made up of many colors, varying from 
violet, through all the colors, to deep red. If we take all these colors 
and mix them carefully, pure white light appears, but if one color is 
missing, the resulting light is impure. Even so with the great spirit- 
ual spectrum ; only when all the principles of the gospel are practiced 
with all our might, are we able to win for ourselves the spiritual con- 
tentment and happiness which should characterize the private and pub- 
lic lives of Latter-day Saints. 

OUR DUTY IN SERVING THE DEAD 

As I have said, the Lord has not given us more laws than we can 
understand and obey. We are told to care for ourselves, that we may 
increase in righteous stature ; we are to render service to our fellow- 
men ; and we are instructed to help open the gospel door for those who 
have passed into the other life without having accepted the gospel. I 
desire to say something about the commandment to devote a part of 
our strength and means to serving the dead who have not heard or ac- 
cepted the gospel. The principle of salvation for the dead is one of 
the most effective in tempering human character, in making men un- 
selfish, and in enabling them to walk in the paths laid out for mankind 
by the Savior. Moreover, the doctrine of salvation for the dead uni- 
fies all the other principles of the gospel. When we consider that this 
gospel principle implies that the Lord, in his mercy and love for his 
children, has made it possible for every soul who loves and will obey 
truth to receive salvation, we begin to glimpse the unspeakable love, 
and the fulness of the blessings that the Lord has for his children. All 
that we do within the Church, whether for ourselves or in preaching 
the gospel to the living, can be interpreted in terms of this great funda- 
mental principle which holds together all the other principles of the 
gospel. "This is my work and my glory, to bring to pass the immortal- 
ity and eternal life of man." We have been told by the Prophet Joseph 
Smith that without our dead we cannot be saved ; or, as he stated it "the 
salvation of our dead is essential to our salvation." We have believed 
this doctrine, we believe it today, and as a result we have become a 



ELDER JOHN A. WIDTSOE 



31 



mighty temple-building people, the only temple-building people in all 
the world, today. There are thoughtful men who declare that the 
great blessings that await this people may be, after all, an effect of our 
possession and use of sacred houses dedicated to the Lord in which 
holy ordinances for the living and the dead are consummated. 

OUR NEARNESS TO THE SPIRIT WORLD 

Ninety-one years ago today the ancient Prophet Elijah stood before 
Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery in the Kirtland temple and delivered 
to this generation the keys of salvation for the dead. Since that event 
the spirit of that work has been poured out upon all nations and there 
has been developed a new feeling with respect to our ancestors. Men 
are beginning to look into the other world; and never before has the 
spirit world seemed so near to us as at the present time. It seems as 
if President Nibley's suggestion may be carried even further than per- 
haps he intended — that we shall soon be able, even by mechanical means, 
to come so near to the veil that separates the living and the dead as to 
be absolutely certain, through the use of every human sense, that the 
vast spirit world lies about us. I speak into this microphone and by 
some mysterious process my words are spread throughout space, through 
an unknown world, which yet is known — a world that I cannot touch, 
and yet just as real as the world I know by touch and by every other 
sense. Two months ago, I picked up the newspaper of that day, and 
read on the front page that that forenoon a person in New York had 
called up London, and another in London had answered his New York 
friend over the radiophone and that others had conversed over the in- 
strument, through space, during the whole of that day — perhaps the 
most eventful day of the period since our last conference. Such de- 
velopments, discoveries and new powers won by man, bring us nearer 
to the unseen world in which I have no doubt the dead live, among 
other beings of whom we have only slight knowledge. The world no 
longer argues, as in the past, against life hereafter, because fact crowds 
upon fact, and the logic of men is convincing, that there must be life 
after this, and that that life is not greatly different from the life we 
have lived on this side, so far as the utilization of the laws of right- 
eousness is concerned. 

THE SPIRIT OF THE AGE DRAWN TOWARD THE DEAD 

In yet another way has the spirit of the age been drawn toward 
the dead, for, since the memorable visit of the Prophet Elijah, men 
and women by the thousands have given themselves to the discovery of 
the genealogies of the world. Thousands of volumes have been pub- 
lished, dealing entirely with the records, names and salient, vital data 
pertaining to those who have lived upon the earth, giving us exactly the 
identification needed for our work in- the temples. I look upon this as 
one of the great gifts to our people, for, though we are one of a city 
and two of a family, we are nevertheless so many that we touch, prac- 
tically, every family within the civilized parts of the world from which 



32 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



we have come. The necessary work in genealogy has been done for us, 
to a great extent. 

Brethren and sisters, assembled in this great conference, I believe 
the Lord requires of us that we all set our houses in order in this re- 
spect, that each man and woman, every family, set about to secure, just 
as completely as may be possible, a record of their dead, so that thereby 
the genealogies of the human family may be gathered and increased 
in number, and we may have ample material with which to labor in the 
temples of the Lord. Such work is not difficult to do. It may be done 
by any man or woman. The intricacies of arranging names in sys- 
tematic genealogies may be done by those who are experts in such work, 
but every man and every woman in Zion may gather names, later to be 
fully arranged, and should give some little time to such work. With 
respect to gospel principles, perhaps none is more important in develop- 
ing spiritual power and strength than that which pertains to the sal- 
vation for the dead. Whether we are near a temple or far away from 
it, we may be able to give some little time to the important work of 
gathering the names of our dead and arranging them for use in the 
temples. The Church maintains the Utah Genealogical Society, which 
upon request will give ample help in such genealogical endeavors. Like- 
wise, to prevent duplication of temple work, even if we increase 
in numbers, the Church has provided and completed, since our 
last conference, a Temple Index, which permits every person who goes 
into a temple to assure himself that the person for whom he is working- 
has not been served before. 

THE SPIRIT OF ELIJAH RESTING UPON THE PEOPLE 

Thus, within and beyond the Church, the spirit of Elijah is operat- 
ing and is resting upon the people. I trust that this spirit may enter 
even more completely into the hearts of the Latter-day Saints, that they 
may continue to be a temple-building people, that we may use our 
temples more abundantly, that we may provide ways and means, by 
earnest effort, through which such work may be done. I feel assured 
in my own heart, from my own experience and the experience of my 
friends, that those who give themselves in wisdom and with propriety 
to this work will round out their spiritual experiences, enrich their lives, 
and find a new and abiding joy in all duties pertaining to life under 
the gospel of Jesus Christ. 

TESTIMONY 

I know that this afternoon is a precious one. Many should be 
heard here today, before this great congregation. I am happy to have 
had this privilege of bearing my testimony to you, and of speaking 
briefly upon an important gospel principle. I bear witness to the exist- 
ence of God, the Father of our spirits ; to the divinity of Jesus Christ, 
his Son ; to the divine mission of ^Joseph Smith, and to the truth of the 
faith that brings joy and happiness to faithful members of the Church. 
I know this work is true. God bless us and establish us in the testi- 
mony of the truth, I pray, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.. Amen.

ELDER BRIGHAM H. ROBERTS 

Of the First Council of Seventy, and Former President of the 
Eastern States Mission .' 

My brethren and sisters, in view of the announcement made by 
President Heber J. Grant this morning, in regard to my being released 
from the Presidency of the Eastern States mission, I think it is quite 
likely that the parents, the brothers and sisters and friends of those 
who are now in the Eastern States on missions, would be glad to receive 
word from that mission as to the general welfare of their sons and 
daughters. I am happy to report to you that it is a general time of 
health with us, that all is well with your kindred and that the Spirit of 
the Lord is a common heritage, it seems to me, to all those who are 
now engaged in the work of the Lord in the Eastern States. 

I wish to express my gratitude unto the Lord and to the authorities 
of the Church that I have had the opportunity of laboring during the 
past five years in that mission. It has been a time of great joy and sat- 
isfaction to me to be conscious of the esteem and friendship of the five 
hundred young people with whom I have come in contact since I began 
my labors in the Eastern States. To receive the friendship and feel 
the supporting influence of their confidence has produced in me a joy 
unspeakable. While I acquiesce fully in the release that has come to 
me, and recognize the wisdom of it, you will have to forgive me if I 
confess also that I received the word with some degree of personal sad- 
ness. I feel honored in the selection of my successor, and I wired that 
word to the secretary of the mission last night, and congratulated the 
mission upon the appointment of Elder Henry H. Rolapp, and I pray 
for a continuation of the esprit de corps, may I call it, of the mission. 
I am very sure that the mission force will give to him all the loyalty 
and the support they have given to me, and that the work of the Lord 
without let or hindrance will continue to expand even as it has in the 

P ast - ^ , . . . 

The Eastern States, in my judgment, is one of the noblest missions 

in the world. Within its boundaries are thirty-three millions of people; 
and of the cities in the United States that have a population of four 
hundred thousand and over, of the fifteen such cities, eight are within 
the boundaries of the Eastern States ! I am happy in the reflection that 
there has been continued growth ill the work, that each successive year 
in the five of my administration has been greater in its success than in 
the one that preceded it. During the time of my labors there has been 
an increase of four chapel buildings in the mission; that is, it will be 
four when the one under construction at the present time is completed. 
I was very happy before leaving New York to secure for the Man- 
hattan or New York branch of our mission more adequate quarters, 
and more worthy of the chief branch of our mission. We secured 
quarters in the Carnegie building. We have now a beautiful hall with 



34 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



suitable classrooms in it to assemble the classes of our Sabbath school, 
and also obtained one of the smaller halls for mid-week services for the 
Young Men's Mutual Improvement Association and the Relief Society, 
so that we will be more suitably located hereafter than in the imme- 
diate past, at least, in that important branch. 

We are expending in the mission about eight thousand dollars 
yearly in rental for halls. This has been an increase in this item from 
three thousand dollars yearly to eight thousand. We have been suc- 
cessful in obtaining better halls and more of them, but of course at 
considerable increase of expense. 

Among the outstanding features of our work in the Eastern States 
during my administration has been the holding of five mission schools. 
These schools have brought in about one-third of the whole mission 
force at a time to each school for intensified training during four solid 
weeks, and if I could take time to recite the curriculum of these schools 
you would agree with me that the training is both intensive and com- 
prehensive. 

It has been my pleasure to write thirteen new tracts for the mis- 
sion since the opening of my administration ; and these have not only 
been used in the Eastern States mission, but other missions also have 
taken up some of them in their work, and altogether, year after year, 
the work has grown. I am extremely happy to be conscious of the fact 
that we quit service on a "rising market." 

There is one circumstance that I shall take the liberty of referring 
to a little in more detail. In New York City alone, that is, in greater 
New York, there are two millions of the House of Judah, and for the 
last several years I have been wondering how we could make an ap- 
proach to those people, attract their attention, and have the material to 
present to them that would place in their hands the great message that 
God has for that branch of the House of Israel. In very many of the 
revelations to the Church, where the Lord sets forth this latter-day 
work, you will find this phraseology often employed when referring to 
the preaching of the gospel — "first unto the Gentiles, and then unto 
the Jews." That occurs quite a number of times in the revelations con- 
tained in the Doctrine and Covenants ; and, of course, being in the midst 
of so large a population of the Jews, one's thought would naturally go 
out to them with a desire to get some word of our message over to 
them. Well, during the past six months, it seems to me that the way 
has wonderfully opened up in that direction, in the city of Bing- 
hampton, Broome county, New York, a name that will be familiar to 
many of you who are acquainted with, the history of the Church, for it 
is territory in which the Prophet Joseph Smith operated during the 
translation of the Book of Mormon, and also in the early movements of 
the Church. It is only about twenty-three miles from this city that 
the Colesville branch was organized, which was the first community 
unit to begin the great work of the gathering together of our people to 
the west. . It was the Colesville branch that as a body, and by coopera- 
tive methods of mutual assistance, moved through the states of New 
York and Ohio, halting for a while in Kirtland, and then continuing 



ELDER BRiGHAM H. ROBERTS 



35 



their journey through Indiana and Illinois, and so on into Missouri, 
and to the western borders of that state, and made the first settlements 
in Jackson county, Missouri. Well, in Binghampton, near where this 
stream of western migration started, came our opening for an approach 
to the House of Judah. There is in that place a converted Jew, who 
is converted to Christianity, but not to our gospel, the true Christi- 
anity. He accepts Christ as the Messiah of the Jews, and he publishes 
a magazine entitled The Redeemed Hebrew. He received a paper from 
a Jewish Rabbi, in Canada, in which the Rabbi set forth his reasons for 
rejecting Jesus Christ as the Messiah, and concluded that it would be 
sin for him, and disloyalty to Jehovah for him to accept Jesus of Naz- 
areth as the Messiah. The article was published and an invitation ex- 
tended to Christian ministers to answer the Rabbi, an editorial note 
stating that the paper which should most completely answer the Rabbi 
would be published in the magazine. It may be a bit out of good taste 
for me to say it, perhaps, but the paper which I submitted to the maga- 
zine was accepted and published as a reply to the Rabbi. After the 
first article was published, I thought it needed a little amplification, 
and so I sent in a second article, and that, too, was published. Then it 
seemed to me that we had just reached the threshold of the subject, 
and there was just a fine opening made for proclaiming our message, 
God's message to the Jews, as we may gather it from the Book of 
Mormon; for, as pointed out by President Anthony W. Ivins this 
morning, the outstanding feature of our Book of Mormon scriptures 
is, that the book shall be a witness to the Gentiles and especially to Jews, 
that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, and the very Eternal God, mani- 
festing himself to all nations. That is found, as you all know, on the 
title page of the Book of Mormon, which the Prophet Joseph Smith 
declared was not his composition. He found it engraven on the title 
page of the gold plates. 

When I sent this third article to the editor of The Redeemed He- 
brew he informed me that it made thirteen pages of his magazine ; and 
as he expected to devote the whole magazine to that paper, he said he 
could publish sixteen pages nearly at the same cost as thirteen, and would 
I supplement what I had written with something further. I did so. 
When that was published it made eighteen pages instead of sixteen ; 
but he refused to select the part to be cut down, and I did not have the 
heart to sacrifice any part of it, so the eighteen pages were published. 

In the supplemental matter I sent to him, I used what I have before 
used as a theme, I think in this tabernacle; namely, "A Prophetic Page 
of the Book of Mormon." I am sorry that we do not have here one 
of the older editions of the Book of Mormon, because then I could 
conscientiously tell you that all the prophecies that I referred to were 
upon one page of the Book of Mormon, but in our more recent edi- 
tions, in dividing the pages into two columns for each page, that par- 
ticular group of prophecies are distributed over two pages. But it 
only makes sufficient matter for one page, and I think I may still say 
that it is a "prophetic page of the Book of Mormon." You will find 
it now in your current editions on page 101 and page 102 ; in the older 



36 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



editions it occupied page 122. Of course, I shall not have time to enter 
into a discussion of all these prophecies of this page— there are five of 
them; but suffice it to say that the first prophecy predicts, that many 
shall believe in the Book of Mormon ; and, second, that they shall carry 
the words of that book unto the remnants of the land, meaning of 
course, the American Indians, descendants of the Nephites and the 
Lamanites of ancient times ; and third, that the remnants of those an- 
cient people shall know their origin, that they are descendants of Israel ; 
the gospel shall be declared among them, that they shall believe it, the 
scales of darkness shall fall from their eyes, and before many genera- 
tions pass away, they shall become a white and delightsome people. 
Then we come to the prophecies that are germane to what I want to 
tell you. It is declared on this prophetic page: 

"And it shall come to pass that the Jews which are scattered also 
sJiall begin to believe in Christ." 

That is a subject that I have had under consideration during many 
years, and I have made a considerable collection of utterances from 
prominent Jewish Rabbis that indicate a marked change of mental atti- 
tude on the part of leading Jews towards Jesus of Nazareth. I think 
perhaps one of the most striking of these utterances, and one that indi- 
cates the whole shifting of thought on the part of Jews toward the 
Christ, was uttered March 25, 1901, by Rabbi Isador Singer, Doctor 
of Philosophy, in New York City. He said : 

"I regard Jesus of Nazareth as a Jew of the Jews, one whom all Jewish 
people are beginning to love. His teaching has been an immense service to all 
the world in bringing Israel's God to the knowledge of hundreds of millions of 
mankind. The great change in the Jewish thought concerning Jesus of Nazareth 
I cannot better illustrate than by this fact. When I was a boy had my father, 
who was a very pious man, heard the name of Jesus uttered from the pulpit of 
our synagogue, he and every other man in the congregation would have left the 
building, and the rabbi would have been dismissed at once. Now it is not a 
strange thing in many synagogues to hear sermons preached eulogistic of this 
Jesus, and nobody thinks of protesting. In fact, we are all glad to claim Jesus 
as one of our people." 

About a year ago Rabbi Wise of New York, in Carnegie Hall, the 
hall that is near to ours now in the Carnegie Building, before a record 
crowd in his lecture room declared that : 

"Jesus of Nazareth was a man, not a myth, as I had been taught 
in my earlier manhood Jesus was ; that is, he existed," said the Rabbi. 
"I accept this despite the information I had been led to believe earlier 
in my life, a notion that Jesus was a myth, and never existed. I tell 
you, and I will repeat these words to every Jew in the world if need 
be: Jesus was, and we must accept this fact at once. Shall we not 
say that this Jew [Jesus] is soul of our soul, and that the soul of his 
teaching is Jewish, and nothing but Jewish? The teaching of Jesus, 
the Jew, is a phase of the spirit which has led the Jew Godward." 

I could continue to read to you many excerpts of this kind, more 
than twenty such excerpts are written in the third article of The Re- 
deemed Hebrew, that I told you about. It merely tends to show that 
the Jew is "beginning to believe in Christ." He has not yet accepted 



ELDER BRIGHAM H. ROBERTS 



37 



him as the Son of God, as God manifested in the flesh, the Redeemer 
of the world, and the one who fulfills the Messianic prophecies of the 
Old Testament. There is nothing in this movement that indicates be- 
lief of Jesus in that way ; but there is much that proclaims the fact that 
the Jews are "beginning" to admire, they are beginning to accept as 
a great religious teacher this Jesus of Nazareth ; to respect him. Ulti- 
mately that respect will turn to love, and love will turn to acceptance of 
him as the Son of God. There will be some, at least, of the House of 
Judah who will begin to react toward this message, this proclamation, 
that our Book of Mormon makes as to the Deity of the Christ, "the 
Eternal God" manifested in the flesh. 

The second part of this prophecy is that not only shall "the Jews 
which are scattered begin to believe in Christ," but "they shall begin to 
gather in upon the face of the land ;" that is, begin to gather to their 
promised land, to Palestine. 

I remember that the British Consular reports of 1856, said that 
less than fifteen thousand Jews were in all Palestine. Twenty years 
later this number had increased to sixty-five thousand. Then came 
the Zionite movement, under the leadership of Dr. Herzal, supplemented 
later by the influence of Israel Zangwell, a Jewish writer of some note, 
and what is known as the "Zionite movement" received an impetus, and 
began to grow in the minds of the Jews until there began what we may 
now call the modern gathering together of the Jews in Palestine. The 
gathering is continuing. Millions of dollars have been subscribed by 
that people to establish their exiled brethren in the land of their fathers, 
and the ambition is to resume the national history of the Jewish people. 
That movement has grown until it has attained large proportions, and 
very wide interest in the world. This prophecy, then, is in course of 
fulfilment — "The Jews that are scattered are beginning to gather in 
upon the land of their forefathers, to the land of Palestine and to Jeru- 
salem !" 

We may pause here to ask what is the motive power, what is be- 
hind all this movement — this change in the mental attitude of that peo- 
ple towards Christ ; — this gathering together of the Jews in Palestine ? 
This is the explanation of it: In the Kirtland Temple, in 1835, Israel's 
great prophet, Moses, appeared to Joseph and Oliver Cowdery and 
delivered to them the keys of the gathering of Israel and the restora- 
tion of the Ten Tribes from the land of the North. In 1840, in pur- 
suance of this work, an apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ, an apostle 
of this new dispensation, a Jew, by the way, was appointed by the 
Prophet Joseph to a special mission to the Holy Land, to Palestine, to 
dedicate that land for the gathering of the Jews to Jerusalem, and to 
bless the Jews with a disposition to return to their land and to their 
city. The mission of Orson Hyde is well known to the Latter-day 
Saints; how, under very great difficulties, trials and hardships, he 
made his way to Jerusalem, went to the summit of the Mount of Olives, 
and there wrote out a prayer that God put into his heart, dedicating the 
land of Palestine for the return of the Jews, and for the renewal of 
their national existence. That prayer — and it is a most wonderful 



38 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



prayer — has been published many times in our periodicals. It is pub- 
lished also in the History of the Church, which is derived chiefly from 
the office journal of the Prophet Joseph. Orson Hyde, returning from 
his mission when in Alexandria, also wrote to the Millennial Star of 
the then current date and there made a rather wonderful prediction. 
He said in substance that it was by political power that Judah had been 
broken and scattered abroad, and that it would be by the exercise of 
political power that Judah would be restored ; and furthermore he de- 
clared that England would be the leading national power that would 
befriend Judah, and aid him in the re-establishment of his people in the 
land of Palestine. This was published in the Millennial Star of 1842, 
and may be found by those curious enough to seek for the source of 
this information. 

That is the source of the power underlying the development of this 
great work. God is moving underneath all these facts — this changing 
of the mental attitude of Jews towards Jesus — this latter-day gathering 
of the Jews to the land and this city of their fathers. 

It is interesting to note that the predictions of Orson Hyde, the 
man set apart to perform this special mission, in behalf of Judah, are 
being wonderfully fulfilled. The defeat of the Turks in the World 
War was by British forces under the English General Sir Edmund 
Allenby. The official entrance of General Allenby into Jerusalem on 
the 11th of December, 1917, and the subsequent course of England in 
respect of Palestine; the fact that Great Britain now holds the admin- 
istration of the affairs of that land tfnder the appointment of the League 
of Nations, — this fills out the story of Elder Orson Hyde's mission, 
and prophecy. The policy of England in respect to its administration 
of the affairs of Palestine as foreshadowed in the declaration by Lord 
Balfour when, on the 2nd of November, 1919, he said officially, and 
with the approval of France, Italy and President Wilson of the United 
States : 

"His Majesty's Government view with favor the establishment in Palestine 
of a National home for the Jewish people, and will use their best endeavors to 
facilitate the achievement of this object." 

England has ever since consistently pursued that policy ; and is 
now pursuing it. 

I regret that I have taken more time than I should have done, but 
I think these matters of sufficient importance to have entered upon the 
record of this conference, and I wish to say, my brethren and sisters, 
that I cannot but regard the opening that has come to us in the Eastern 
States to furnish material by which we may approach our cousin Judah 
with the message of the Book of Mormon, as an opening of the way by 
the inspiration and power of the Spirit of the Lord. I may not have 
made that very clear to you, but I feel it in my own heart, and I pray 
that God will bless this branch of his people, the Jews, and that the 
time will come when we shall have larger access to these people in the 
proclamation of God's message to them. I hope so, and pray for it, in 
the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 



ELDER CHARLES A. CALLIS

ELDER CHARLES A. CALLIS 

President Southern States Mission 

My brethren and sisters, as the President of the Church was deliv- 
ering his sermon this morning, I thought, What a great spiritual com- 
fort and sustaining power it is to the Latter-day Saints to hear him 
speak in the spirit of testimony, and truly his testimony is invaluable 
to the Church. In Atlanta a few years ago we accepted an invitation 
for President Grant to speak in a Unitarian Church. At the close of 
his sermon the minister said : "Mr. Grant, I wish I had your earnest- 
ness, your testimony, and your faith." I felt that that minister voiced 
the feeling of millions of people in the earth whose religious beliefs are 
vague and therefore not very comforting. 

In the 133rd section of the Doctrine and Covenants the Lord sets 
forth the mission of the Church. He says : 

"And for this cause, that men might be made partakers of the glories which 
were to be revealed, the Lord sent forth the fulness of his gospel, his everlast- 
ing covenant, reasoning in plainness and simplicity — 

"To prepare the weak for those things which are coming on the earth, and 
for the Lord's errand in the day when the weak shall confound the wise, and 
the little one become a strong nation, and two shall put their tens of thousands to 
flight. ! ' i 

"And by the weak things of the earth the Lord shall thrash the nations by 
the power of his Spirit." 

And are not the elders preaching in plainness and in simplicity? 
They are preaching in the power of the spirit of testimony. 

"And after your testimony cometh wrath and indignation upon the people. 
For after your testimony cometh the testimony of earthquakes, that shall cause 
groanings in the midst of her, and men shall fall upon the ground and shall not 
be able to stand. And also cometh the testimony of the voice of thunderings, 
and the voice of lightnings, and the voice of tempests, and the voice of the waves 
of the sea, heaving themselves beyond their bounds." 

When your sons come into the mission field, I meet them in a 
spirit of love and sympathy, for I feel that these young men need sym- 
pathy and love. I believe that the Lord prefers mercy, prefers executing 
mercy rather than judgment. As I stand before these splendid young 
men, I have no doubt of their ability to preach the gospel. I believe in 
them, for in my heart are the words of the Lord, which are as follows : 
"For the power is in them wherein they are agents unto themselves. 
And inasmuch as men do good they shall in nowise lose their reward." 
And when the Lord says the power is in them, who shall doubt the ability 
of these young men of Israel to preach the gospel, if they magnify their 
calling ? 

Recently I honorably released a young man, and he told me some 
of his history. He said: "I am the fifth son of a family to have filled 
a mission, and it has cost my father, who is a poor farmer, over eight 
thousand dollars to keep me and my brothers in the mission field." This 
case is by no means uncommon, but it shows the background of this 
missionary work; a background of sacrifice and sacred devotion to the 
work of the Lord. And shall we forget this sacrifice? Who would not 



40 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



be willing to help these fine young men, brethren and sisters ? When 
they come into the mission field, I look at them and try to think of their 
fathers and their mothers who have reared them, and I say to myself : 
"With the help of God, it is my duty to continue this noble work and to 
help the parents develop the power that God has given their sons, as 
ministers of his word, to preach the everlasting gospel." 

To the testimony of my brethren I add my testimony : I know, by 
the power of the Holy Ghost, that Jesus is the Christ, our Redeemer 
and our Savior, the Son of the living God, the resurrection and the life. 
By the same power I have been favored with a testimony that Joseph 
Smith was a man sent from God, a messenger of the Almighty, a choice 
being raised up by the Lord to complete the glorious work of having 
all dispensations merge into this, the dispensation of the fulness of times, 
that God "might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which 
are in heaven and which are on earth;" and prepare the world for 
the second coming of the Son of God: and this testimony I humbly 
bear, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER WM. J. HENDERSON 

President of the Pamguitch Stake and Recently Returned from a 
Short-term Mission in the Southern States 

My brethren and sisters: I feel thankful to our heavenly Father, 
and to the brethren who preside over the Church, that I have had the 
wonderful opportunity and experience of a short-term mission in the 
Southern states. I am on my way home from that mission, where I 
have been laboring as a missionary since last October. That mission is 
a wonderful field of labor. The leading thought in my mind, almost 
continuously, in laboring with the young men sent out to preach and 
teach the gospel in that land, was, What a blessing it would be to the 
elders and to the people of that mission and other missions, if men of 
experience could be constantly associated with them. I am thoroughly 
convinced that it was through the inspiration of our heavenly Father 
that short-term missionaries were called into the field. The men needed 
to carry forward short-term missions, especially in the Southern states 
where I have labored, would be the busy, the active men, men who are 
doing things, who have their fingers on the financial pulse of the 
country, as well as affairs spiritual. The mission needs the professional 
men — the doctors, the lawyers, the educators, the financiers, men who 
measure up with the general practical conditions as we find them. 

There are some wonderful cities in the South, which have been 
making rapid progress during the last few years. There are men in 
the South with keen minds, up-to-date, who are doing things, men of 
intelligence, approachable, willing to listen. If we send missionaries 
who are qualified to take up the principles of life and salvation with 
this class of men, it would be a great strength to that mission. It would 
also be a source of great strength to the young elders. They need 



ELDER WILLIAM J. HENDERSON 



41 



encouragement, sympathy, someone to help them to get started in this 
great work in which we are engaged. 

I have in mind one small city of 42,000 people. I was told, by a 
member of the Chamber of Commerce, that the payroll of that city 
was three hundred thousand dollars a day. I was also in Birmingham, 
Alabama, where a member of the Chamber of Commerce said that 
the payroll of that wonderful city was four million two hundred thou- 
sand dollars a week. The south is filling up with wonderful industries 
from the north. They have all of the latest modern improvements in 
these great cities. They have spent millions of dollars for water sys- 
tems, and for other improvements. Many of those wonderful cities are 
modern, up-to-date in every respect, and forging ahead with marvelous 
rapidity. 

We have an excellent membership in the South. Many choice 
men and women who have received the testimony of the elders. They 
have a testimony of the divine mission of the Prophet Joseph Smith. 
They are devoted to the work, are giving their time and their talents 
to' the cause, willing to serve, and assume responsibility. It is a great 
work. The training that our boys and girls are getting in the mission 
field is admirable. We can scarcely conceive of the worthy training they 
are receiving", but they need the help of more of our men of ability, who 
have had greater experiences in the gospel. I am hoping and praying 
continuously that men of this class may be separated for a short time 
from their business cares, and see their way to give a few months of their 
time to assist these young men in carrying forward the testimony that 
we have received of this wondrous latter-day work. I am sure that it 
will profit them, their families, and their associates. They will get 
more out of it themselves than they will be able to give to others. That 
has been the experience of our missionaries ; and we feel indebted to 
our heavenly Father for the blessings that have come to us. 

I have often heard people say : "We have made a sacrifice to go 
on a mission. I have made a sacrifice to send my son, or my daughter 
on a mission." It never appealed to me as a sacrifice at all. It has 
always appealed to me as a glorious privilege and opportunity to be 
called by the servants of the Lord to preach and teach the gospel, and 
to administer in its ordinances. I have proved it a great privilege and 
a blessing. I have received more personal joy in preaching and teach- 
ing the gospel and mingling and associating with our young men in the 
mission field, than I have ever received in any other way. 

I pray that the Lord will move upon the hearts of our busy men 
throughout the Church, to be anxious to fill a short-term mission, and 
assist in carrying on this work and labor. You have no idea of the 
wonderful good that you cart accomplish, and the encouragement that 
you will be able to give the younger missionaries. And they need 
encouragement. When our boys and girls are started out properly and 
rightly in the mission field, they become strong men and women, and 
are able to accomplish a great amount of good. They develop, grow, 
and increase in power and ability to a remarkable extent. That is my 



42 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



testimony of the wonderful improvement and advancement that our 
sons and daughters have made in the mission field. For this reason 
and others, I do pray that the mission presidents throughout the United 
States will be blessed in the future more than in the past with the pres- 
ence of men of ability, and experience, who can do, greater service in 
carrying forward this latter-day work. 

I have received many testimonies in regard to the truth of this 
latter-day work. I know that it is true. I know that the testimony 
which the young men and women who are called into the mission field 
have received through their parents is supplemented and developed as 
soon as the responsibility comes to them. It will grow, and they will 
make good, if they have the proper care and training, in starting out 
in the mission field. I pray God to bless us all, in the name of Jesus. 
Amen. 

The choir sang the anthem, "The Lord now victorious." 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

Can you beat that in any land or any clime? [Referring to the 
wonderful rendition of the anthem, just sing.] There will be a con- 
cert given here Tuesday evening by the choir. The admission price is 
twenty- five and fifty cents, and we owe it to the choir to give them a 
rousing reception. I think our music today very superior indeed. I 
rejoice exceedingly in it. 

Brother David K. Udall will come to the stand on Monday morn- 
ing to offer the opening prayer. Brother Udall has been appointed 
president of the Arizona Temple. The Temple will be completed within 
a few weeks, but will not be dedicated until after the October confer- 
ence. It will cost us about three quarters of a million dollars. 

Prayer was offered by Elder Carl K. Conrad, president of the 
Nevada stake. 

The conference adjourned until Monday, 10 o'clock a. m., April 
4, 1927. 



FIRST OVERFLOW MEETING 

An overflow meeting of the conference was held in the Assembly 
Hall at 10 o'clock, Sunday morning, April 3, 1927. 

Elder J. Golden Kimball, of the First Council of Seventy, pre- 
sided. 

The music was furnished by the Dutch choir, of Salt Lake City, 
Elder A. Van Roosendaal, conductor; Elder Tracy Y. Cannon at the 
organ. 

The choir and congregation sang, "Come, let us anew our journey 
pursue."

ELDER RUSSELL H. BLOOD 

Former President of the French Mission 

I feel it a great privilege, my brethren and sisters, to stand before 
a general conference of the Church. This is the first opportunity that 
I have had since October, 1921, to attend a general conference of the 
Church and during the larger part of the intervening time I have been 
in Europe. 

It was my privilege to labor during the latter part of the time 
among the French-speaking people, and I can assure you that I bring 
back from those countries some of the fondest memories of my life. 
The French mission was reorganized at the commencement of 1924, 
at which time the French-speaking people of Belgium, and those of the 
French cantons in Switzerland, and the people of France, were united 
under one head. Up to that time there had been missionaries laboring 
in Belgium and Switzerland, and years ago missionaries had done work 
in France, but these countries had not been grouped together as a 
French mission, until 1924. 

I am sure that the movement that was taken by ]the authorities was 
the proper one. While our labors will perhaps be slow among the 
French people, for some time, because of the fact that they have not 
heard of the teachings of our Church and because missionaries have 
not been among them, yet I am confident that we have a great work 
to perform among those who speak the French language. 

I can say truthfully that there are no finer people to associate with 
than those in Belgium, in France, and in Switzerland. Some misunder- 
standing has arisen here in our country with respect to the French 
people, and some of us have been prone to criticize them for conditions 
that have been forced upon them ; and, perhaps, also, for their attitude 
toward the people of the United States ; but could you go, as I have 
gone, and as many others have, through the war-torn countries of 
France and Beligum, I am sure that you would then appreciate more 
fully the conditions under which they have been laboring in the past 
few years. There are four or five divisions of France which were 
completely devastated during the war, and these, by the way, were the 
agricultural districts. Not only were homes destroyed, but much of 
the land was damaged to such an extent that, perhaps, it can never be 
reclaimed. However, the French government is spending large sums 
of money in an effort to clear the shell-strewn land, and to remove the 
effects of war throughout this territory. Their homes, their means of 
livelihood, were taken from them, and then we, who have not been 
touched to such an extent, criticize them because of the fact that they 
feel they are overburdened and because they have expressed their feel- 
ings.

GE NE HAL CONFERENCE 



I like the French people. I like the way they extend their hos- ■ 
pitality to all those who go among them, and especially to our mission- 
aries. When missionaries go into their homes they are received, and 
the people listen to their message. True, it is entirely new to them and 
they cannot understand, as we do, some of the principles of the gospel, 
but we are making an effort to teach them, and they are earnestly in- 
vestigating our teachings. 

There are no people more energetic than the Belgians, and while 
their country is small, they, too, have suffered under similar condi- 
tions to those that exist in France. Their country, also, was destroyed ; 
their homes were taken from them ; they had no place to go. Fathers 
and sons were taken out of the homes and the wives and daughters were 
left to "carry on." It is a pitiful sight, in passing through Belgium at 
the present time, to see the women working — working too hard — in the 
fields, working in the shops and factories, working along the canals 
and rivers pulling the boats laden with products and sharing their part 
of the labor in loading and unloading the boats at their destinations. 
These sights are very common. The women are working just as hard 
as the men to rebuild their beautiful and beloved little country, and we 
who have known their sacrifices, and witnessed their sturdy determina- 
tion to rehabilitate their lands sympathize also with the Belgians for 
what they have passed through, and admire them for what they are 
doing. 

Switzerland was not touched as these other countries were by the 
war. It is a most delightful country, as most of you know. It is called 
"the playground of the world," and truly it is a playground, beautiful 
and inviting. There the people are a little more care-free than they 
are in the other parts of the French mission ; and, being in general a 
Protestant country, they are less difficult to approach on religious 
matters. 

So, summing up the conditions as they exist at the present time in 
France, Belgium and Switzerland, I can truthfully say that I believe 
our missionaries will accomplish just as great a work among the French 
speaking people as has been accomplished among the British, the Nor- 
wegians, the Dutch, the Germans and those of other parts of the world, 
if we continue to work to that end ; and, for one, I feel to encourage 
those who have the opportunity of going to France, or to the French 
mission to accept the call, and devote. their time, efforts and talents to 
the building up of the Lord's work in those countries. The gospel is 
for all mankind. It is not alone for the British people, although our 
first missionary labors in Europe were among them, but it is intended 
for other nations of Europe and for those in the far parts of the earth. 

It is interesting to note the change that comes into the lives of 
those who have accepted the gospel. It is interesting to note the differ- 
ence in home life; the change of conditions; the better feeling that 
exists between father and son, between mother and daughter. There 
seems to be kindled in their hearts a new love for one another and for 
their fellow-men, and^truly that is the spirit of the gospel of Christ. 



ELDER RUSSELL H. BLOOD 



45 



It has been my privilege to watch these changes in the lives of 
some of those with whom I have been associated, and I declare unto 
you that the gospel is molding the lives of those who receive it and are 
living it. I believe that we, the members of the Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints, should devote our time and talents to the ad- 
vancement of the Lord's work, because, after all, we are here but a short 
period of time and it is our duty to give these glad tidings that we have 
received to others who have not been so fortunate as we have been in 
being born here in the valleys of the mountains. I feel and believe as 
did Nephi of old when he said, "I will go and do the thing which the 
Lord hath commanded, for I know that the Lord giveth no command- 
ments unto the children of men, save he shall prepare a way for them 
that they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth them.'' I 
believe that where the Lord has laid down a rule, where he has given 
a commandment, that in every case he provides the way by which we. 
his children, may fulfil these commandments which have been given 
unto us. So, is there any reason that, as Latter-day Saints, we should 
falter? Is there any reason why we should not heed the principles of 
the gospel of Christ? Is there any reason why we should not perform 
the duties assigned us by the authorities of the Church? I say there 
is no reason. I believe that it is the duty of every Latter-day Saint to 
observe the principles of the gospel in his life. I believe that it is the 
duty of every man, woman and child who has been baptized into this 
Church not only to keep the commandments of the Lord, but to strive 
also to give some new hope, some encouragement, to those who have not 
been blessed as we have been. 

When we are traveling in the world, we find that the conditions 
which exist among Christian people are appalling, i. e., we find such 
diversity of opinion with reference to the teachings of Christ. We find 
that different sects are teaching various doctrines, and the result is 
that the world at large is thrown into confusion. It is difficult for one 
who has not heard the teachings of a commissioned servant of the Lord 
to select the principles and doctrines that he should follow in his search 
for the way of salvation. It is the hope and purpose of our missionary 
work to give guidance, and point the way, to those who are seeking 
truth, and I am glad to say that so- far as my travels have revealed, our 
missionaries are accomplishing that purpose. There is no work in the 
world that gives a testimony of the gospel as does the missionary 
work. To go forth, bearing the Priesthood, to give a reason for the 
hope that is within us; to go out and stand for truth and for righteous- 
ness, against the evil forces which are constantly opposing, is a great 
privilege, a choice blessing. 

The missionaries in France are devoting their time willingly ; they 
are working conscientiously. They know the obstacles before them. 
They realize that the French have not in the past received the gospel 
as have the other people in Europe, because they have not had these 
teachings as some of the other people have had them. Therefore the 



/ 



46 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

missionaries are devoting extra time and additional effort for the 
furtherance of this noble work. 

I commend very highly the faithful and conscientious efforts of all 
those with whom I was privileged to labor, because they are men of 
true character — they are men who have the spirit of the gospel at heart. 

I had the pleasure of going to Palestine, about two years ago, and 
while traveling there many things occurred that have strengthened my 
testimony and increased my understanding of the great value of our 
teachings. On one occasion I entered the Church of the Nativity at 
Bethlehem — a church which has been erected over the birth-place of 
our Lord and Savior. I had two companions with me, and as we viewed 
with reverence the interesting things within the church, our attention 
was drawn to long strips of carpet and small mats which seemed to sep- 
arate the floor space into various sections. We walked on through the 
church toward the back where we were conducted through a small door 
down a few steps to the manger, the very place, we were told, in which 
the Christ-child had been born. But our curiosity was again aroused 
when we noticed that an Arab, wearing the Mohammedan costume and 
armed with a rifle was standing guard over this sacred place, and it 
was upon inquiry that we learned the reason for this unusual condi- 
tion. A few years previous to our visit the different Christian de- 
nominations who had been worshipping at the same time in this church 
had not agreed upon some particular topic of discussion and a battle 
had arisen ; a real genuine fight in which several were wounded. As a 
result of this it was decided, perhaps unanimously, by these Christian 
sects, these pseudo-Christians, may I call them, to divide the Church 
into sections designating a particular section to each sect ; and in order 
that there should be no further confusion or fighting they also decided 
to place an Arab guard, not a Christian, but an Arab guard, over the 
birthplace of the Savior. Imagine such a condition! How disgusting 
it seems to us to know of the necessity of having an armed Arab guard 
standing in that most sacred place to keep Christians from killing one 
another. 

That brings to mind the very thing that exists today throughout 
Europe, that exists generally throughout all the world — the lack of 
brotherly love and respect for the rights of others. Hatred often arises 
among Christian denominations — not love for their fellow-men ; not the 
spirit of the gospel of Christ, but in their place antagonism, strife and 
contention. 

Now that my mission has been completed and I am back among 
the Latter-day Saints, I rejoice in the opportunity of meeting with you. 
I am happy in the knowledge that we, as a body, are united. We are 
making an effort to wipe out the differences that exist throughout the 
Christian world, by earnestly teaching the true gospel of the Lord ; the 
gospel of good will and fellowship ; the gospel of peace. True, we are 
having difficulty in winning our way and bringing people to the light 
of gospel truth. Perhaps, in numbers, we shall for a long time be in 
the minority, but we have the assurance that to us has been given the 



ELDER RUSSELL H. BLOOD 



47 



true and everlasting gospel of Jesus Christ. We know that the prophet, 
Joseph Smith, was a true prophet of God, and we know that in these, 
the last days, we are being directed by the Lord through his servants. 
This is his Church; we are his children and it is our privilege to re- 
ceive the blessings which he has promised us, provided we are faithful 
and true to all the covenants we have made with him. 

I bear you my testimony that I know that this is the true work of 
the Lord. I know that we are living in a day and age when it behooves 
everyone of us to hold firm and steadfast to the principles of the gospel. 
I pray that the Lord may strengthen all of us, that he may give us his 
Spirit at all times to guide and direct us in all that we do, so that 
eventually we shall attain salvation in his kingdom. May God bless us 
all. May the spirit of this conference influence our lives, and may we 
carry to our homes the determination to go on in this work and to do 
the things which will bring us happiness and joy, not only in this life 
but in the life to come. I pray for these blessings in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 

ELDER EUGENE J. NEFF 

Former President of the Hawaiian Mission 

Last evening I had decided that I ,would come to conference 
early this morning, that I might gain entrance to the Tabernacle 
and hear the keynote of this conference given by the President of 
the Church, when a party, casually, informed me that I was to be 
one of the speakers here this morning. I assure you, my brethren 
and sisters, that I desire an interest in your faith and prayers the 
few moments I may stand before you. I have stood before many 
large congregations, hut I have never stood before any that I did 
not feel reliance on the Spirit of the Lord to give me utterance. I 
have preached the gospel in the Hawaiian Islands, spending eight 
years of my life there. I have stood before thousands of tourists 
and aboard steamers, enroute to and from that land, the governor in 
his palace, and defended the word of the Lord before him. I have 
stood in large hotels before five hundred or more of their prominent 
citizens in a reception given to Prince Otoni, a Japanese who is the 
head of ten million Buddhists of Japan. I have stood in our confer- 
ence assemblies in Honolulu, in our beautiful chapel there, where 
we have had a congregation as large, or nearly as large, as the 
congregation here today. I have also met with our Hawaiian peo- 
ple in a little grass hut, when only four or five of us would be gath- 
ered together, sitting on the mats and there preaching the gospel to 
one another. But, as I say, I never stand before a congregation of 
any size or kind but that I feel 1 reliance on the holy Spirit to give 
me utterance. 

I was pleased this morning to hear this splendid choir of the 
Dutch people. Like Brother Kimball, I am a descendant of the 
Dutch people, my father being one of the Pennsylvania Dutch, who 



48 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



emigrated to Utah in 1847. I am thankful also that God has made 
as one all nations of men, that he has gathered us from the north 
and from the south, from the east and the west, from the isles of 
the sea, and that all over the world he has sent his messengers of 
salvation, and the people have come to Zion. I regret, however, 
that some of those who have mlade such sacrifices to come to Zion, 
who have made all but the supreme sacrifice to come to Zion, have 
come only to apostatize. I also know missionaries who have spent 
years in the mission field bringing salvation to the souls of people 
who sat in darkness, who have returned home and neglected the 
chance of salvation to their own souls. 

As I said before, I have spent eight years in the land of sun- 
shine and flowers, in the land of fair Hawaii, the land said to be the 
only place under the sun — the only part of the garden that was not 
touched by the curse on man. Those little dots,, as they appear on 
our map, in the Pacific ocean, really seem to be a part of the par- 
adise which has not received the measure of the curse which some 
of the other nations have received. The gospel has been firmly 
established there. We have there the third largest mission in the 
Church, with fourteen thousand members, with baptisms exceeding 
all except two others in the Church. 

It was partly through the instrumentality of George Q. Can- 
non, I believe, the father of Brother John Ql Cannon, who offered 
the opening prayer, that the work was established there. 

The Lord has always been mindful of the seed of Lehi, and as 
early as 1842, the Prophet Joseph, by revelation,, sent Parley P. 
Pratt, Peter Whitmer, Jr., and Ziba Peterson on a mission to Mis- 
souri to bring the message of salvation to the seed of Lehi. While 
their mission was not altogether successful as far as conversion was 
concerned, yet it showed the deep interest which the prophet had in 
that chosen people, the seed of Lehi. 

Before the prophet's death he sent missionaries to the Society 
Islands, and they labored there and opened up that mission. 

Three years after the pioneers arrived here in Utah, in 1850, at 
the conference held in October of that year, Brigham Young called 
ten missionaries to go to Hawaii and open up the work there. Some 
people thought it was wrong to take the strength of their manhood 
out of the valleys at that time and send men to the nations abroad ; 
they needed them here ; they wanted to redeem this desert. Why 
should they go to Hawaii and other lands on missions, when it 
seemed that their services were most needed here in Utah, in re- 
deeming the country from its barrenness ? 

In those days many missionaries went on foot over the plains 
third class on the boat, and second on the railroad— if there was 
any second. Things have changed since then, and today we go on 
beautiful, palatial ocean liners, with all the conveniences of the 
world, and we go first class. Not so with these first missionaries 
who went to Hawaii. They embarked on the voyage, and worked 



ELDER EUGENE J. NEFF 



49 



their way to the port of Honolulu, arriving- there and wending their 
way up through the narrow streets to find lodging for the night, 
and the next day repairing to Punchbowl Hill, or, some say, Pacific 
Heights ; and there they knelt in prayer and dedicated the land of 
Hawaii and themselves to the preaching of the gospel of Jesus 
Christ. That was in 1850. Since that time there have been over 
eight hundred missionaries go to Hawaii. There have been many 
hundreds and thousands converted. Today we are reaching back 
and working for the forefathers of those people and are doing work 
for them, in the temple at Laie. Truly the gospel of Jesus Christ 
has reached out for the salvation and redemption of the Hawaiian 
people. 

Elder George Q. Cannon, who was the youngest of the first 
missionaries to go to Hawaii, went from Lahaina to Wailuku, going 
down the valley of Iao and to the city of Wailuku. As he crossed 
the Wailuku river, his foot slipped and he fell into the water. Dis- 
couraged he arose and intended to retrace his steps, but the Lord 
revealed to him that he was to go to the city of Wailuku and there 
the way would be opened up before him, so he continued on his way. 
Now it happened that a certain chief who lived in that city had a 
manifestation that a white man would come that day to him with 
the message of salvation. He related this to his little girl. As 
Brother Cannon came along, the girl saw him and ran to her father 
informing him that the white man had come. The chief went out 
and invited Brother Cannon into his home and Brother Cannon 
taught him the gospel. That was the means of opening up the work 
in that place. Brother Cannon learned the language and with the 
other elders went from city to city, and at Pulehu they performed 
the first baptisms. It was in this village that Elders David O. Mc- 
Kay, Hugh J. Cannon and E. Wesley Smith, in 1921, the latter then 
presiding in Hawaii, were visiting when they were led to pray. As 
they were praying under a beautiful pepper tree, one of the Ha- 
waiian brethern had a manifestation. As they finished the payer, 
Elder McKay officiating, the native elder said to Brother E. Wes- 
ley Smith : "Did you see an arm extended while Brother McKay 
was praying?" Brother Smith answered that his eyes were closed 
and he did not. The other brethren seemed to sense an unusual feel- 
ing as if visitors from the unseen were present, and when they were 
leaving the place Elder McKay declared that the veil between them 
and the spirit world was very thin. Elder Cannon spoke up and 
said, "There was no veil." I believe that the spirit of his father 
was present upon that occasion, as he loved the people of those 
islands. I believe that he loves them today and that he is interested 
in them as much as he ever was. 

The first missionaries went from this section around to another 
little town on the east side of the island, and there they gathered in 
a grass hut one hundred people to hear the message of these strange 
white mem As they all sat around the mat and heard the voice of

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



this missionary from Utah, they were transfigured before George Q. 
Cannon, and he saw ninety-seven of them become white, and three 
of them remained dark. He did not understand. He did not know 
why it was that three of them would remain dark and all the rest 
should become light. He received a partial answer to this manifes- 
tation when it was learned that ninety-seven of those people in 
meeting at this time joined the Church, became devout members, 
lived and died Latter-day Saints, while three of them never did. It 
is said that they will become a white and delightsome people. They 
are delightsome at present, and I believe they are going to become 
white. They are growing whiter from year to year. I have said to 
myself and to some of my intimate friends that I thought the Ha- 
waiian people would become white and delightsome, through inter- 
marriage. I do not know whether that is according to the doc- 
trines of the Church or not, but they jhave married the oriental 
races and married white people on the islands to such an extent 
that today there are more half casts than there are pure Hawaiians. 

Possibly the natives appear light to us and dark to people who 
are not acquainted with them 1 . When we are laboring among them 
we do not notice their dark skin, we are one with them. We are 
not two nations but one nation in the work of the Lord. I remem- 
ber that twenty-five years ago, on my first mission, when I first 
arrived in Honolulu, I saw the little ^Hawaiian boys diving for pen- 
nies dropped from the boat. I thought they were dark, but they do 
not look dark to me today. The Book of Mormon is the only record 
that reveals the origin of these people, although some people have 
endeavored to connect them with the negro, which cannot be done. 

During the time of the Johnston Army difficulty all the mis- 
sionaries in the islands and in other lands were called home to Utah. 
Several thousand of the natives had joined the Church and for a 
while they were left without missionaries. The Church bought 
land at Lanai for the purpose of gathering the members of the 
Church there. Walter M. Gibson, an adventurer and an ambitious 
man, joined the Church and was sent to the islands as a missionary. 
He was to go to the Society Islands, but he landed in Honolulu and 
thought that place was good enough for him, so he stayed. He 
represented himself as an elder and had his certificate and other cre- 
dentials to show and thus won the natives who believed him to be 
one of the leaders of the Church. He gathered the people together 
at Lanai and ruled over them with a high hand. He took advan- 
tage of their native simplicity and established himself among them 
with almost supreme power. A report reaching President Young 
of conditions, he sent Elders Ezra T. Benson and Lorenzo Snow, 
who were apostles,, and Elders Joseph F. Smith and William Cluff, 
down to the Hawaiian Islands to adjust the trouble there with Gib- 
son. Elders Joseph F. Smith and William W. Cluff had been mis- 
sionaries in the islands and were therefore acquainted with the peo- 
ple and their language, Elder Smith speaking it very fluently. When 



ELDER EUGENE J. NEFF 



51 



the brethren arrived they discovered that Walter M. Gibson had 
organized the members of the Church in various ranks, charging them 
for the Priesthood he conferred according to the importance of the of- 
fice. He was also collecting their tithing and spending it as he pleased 
and thus he was becoming rich at their expense. The missionaries en- 
deavored to get Gibson to repent, but he would not, and so they had to 
cut him off the Church. After laboring diligently and with much 
difficulty, they finally got the native Saints to understand that they had 
been deceived. The brethren predicted that Walter M. Gibson would 
lose his influence and power and would eventually die in the gutter if 
he did not repent. After this he rose in power on the islands for a while 
but eventually was forced to leave and went to San Francisco where 
the prophecy was literally fulfilled. Mr. Gibson -endeavored to con- 
vince the Saints that the missionaries were usurpers, and he said : 
"Hearken to them, if you will, but you know what I have done for you." 
Elder Joseph F. Smith who was spokesman for the brethren said in sub- 
stance : "This man whom you uphold as a leader and a representative 
of the brethren in Salt Lake City is a usurper. He was not sent 
here. He has gathered you and has changed the ordinances and trans- 
gressed the laws of the Church," and finally the people were convinced. 

The people after they were convinced gathered again at Laie, 
where a gathering place was established and where the temple now 
stands. 

I rejoice in having had the privilege of laboring in Hawaii. These 
eight years have been the sweetest years of my life, and I long to see 
the interests of the Hawaiian people promoted. I want to see them 
grow, as I know they will grow under the able leadership of Presi- 
dent William M. Waddoups. The work is growing there, and it 
is marvelous how many God has called together from that land. People 
today almost concede the Hawaiian people to the "Mormon" Church. 
I have never seen Chinese and Japanese — those who we claim are not 
susceptible to the truth- — intermarry with the Hawaiian race without 
their descendants becoming susceptible to the gospel, and we are bring- 
ing them now to a knowledge of the truth. 

I see my time is up. I pray that the Lord will bless the people 
through these sessions of conference, that we may be inspired of the 
Lord in gathering together to hear the word of the Lord.

And wooded dell, and flowing fields of grain, 

The love of his own Maker ; 

Who can hear in song of bird and buzz of bee, 

In rippling rills and mighty cataract's fall 

The voice of his own Creator; 

Who counts himself as one small part of God's great whole, 

Yet forms a golden link in life's unbroken chain. 

Who sees and knows and feels God's presence everywhere : 

He has learned the harmony of love and life, 

Of God and man." 

Amen. 

A male chorus from the choir sang, "Rock of my refuge."

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



ELDER J. GOLDEN KIMBALL 

Of the First Council of Seventy 

I am very desirous that what I may say to you good people will be 
under the influence of the Holy Spirit. 

I have been in the service for a long time. If I have ever been 
vain — and no doubt I have been — I think men are really more vain 
than women, and that is a hard blow ! — I have no ambition at the close 
of my life other than to serve God and keep his commandments, give 
service, and do my duty. 

I do not know that I have ever had a greater desire in delivering 
a message to the people than the hope that the Lord will burn it into 
their hearts. After years of experience, I have learned that it is not 
what you say that counts, it is what you feel. It is not what the speaker 
delivers, it is what he thinks. If Latter-day Saints are to fulfil their 
destiny among the children of men, they must do their own thinking, 
and men and women and children in this Church, if they keep the com- 
mandments of God and are under the influence of the Holy Ghost, are 
entitled to inspiration, to revelation, to dreams and visions, for their 
own salvation. But that is as far as you can go, and any person who 
thinks he is living so close to God that he can direct this Church, unless 
he repents, he will apostatize, as surely as God lives. God never gave 
us inspiration and revelation to take the place of the prophet of the 
living God. 

I am a great believer in looking forward, not downward. I am 
not a believer in looking backward, except for wisdom and for the 
experience that others have had. With me it is the future. But I want 
to tell you there can be found a great vision in the past, and what 
Brother Neff has said about the brethren in the Hawaiian mission can 
be said of other men. When I think of men, I think of my father. He 
was a young man — they were all young men at the time of the great 
apostasy, when there was not a quorum in the Church, from the presi- 
dency down, that was not shaken — when Hyrum Smith, the patriarch, 
the brother of Joseph, whispered in father's ear, "You are to go to 
England for the salvation of the Church." 

One thing- I desire to get before you is this : Our people are sensi- 
tive to some things, they are full of criticism. God never created a man 
that could please all the "Mormon" people — and if any one ever tries 
to please all of them, he will fail. You cannot please all the people. The 
Savior did not please all. They crucified him and killed all his witnesses. 
And so it has been throughout history. Some people do not think you can 
write anything by inspiration and read it. But I want to ask- the peo- 
ple, after all the experience I have had, "How can you tell when you 
have the spirit — when you pray and when you administer? I have never 
been able to tell until it comes, and when it has come to me and I have 
thought I had it, some people did not think so. 

I have before me, in a written document, something I am going to 
say. You may not remember it, but I will say it anyway. I never wrote 



ELDER J. GOLDEN KIMBALL 



53 



a book in my life and never will, but I have written thousands of things 
and pigeon-holed them and never read them to anyone else but myself. 
I want to advise this people, if the Lord ever does give you an inspira- 
tion, for heaven's sake write it down and remember it. If Joseph Smith 
the prophet had not done that, you would never have had some things 
contained in the Doctrine and Covenants. I have in my possession an 
inspired writing 'by my father that no one in this Church outside of a 
few of his family has ever read and no doubt it never will be in print. 
Why? Because it was given to Heber C. Kimball for his own good, 
for his own encourgement, and it would surprise you more than any- 
thing you have ever received, if I should stand here and read what God 
revealed to his servant Heber C. Kimball. But it was not for the 
Church. 

I am about to read something to you. You know I am a native. 
I guess I look like it too, don't I ? I was born in these valleys, up here 
on the hill, six years after the pioneers arrived. I do not remember 
much about their hardships and about the famine, but I certainly look 
like I had passed through the famine ! I recall that the first thing these 
great men did, President Brigham Young and his followers, was to 
select their inheritances. Heber C. Kimball had the privilege of tak- 
ing one of these city blocks. And now his posterity are a race of peo- 
ple that we think numbers more than two thousand. He went up on 
the hill, dug the rocks out, and built a stone wall around the block. 
And I was kept inside of it on Sundays. And I hate rock walls yet ! 

I will read to you from a talk I made in San Francisco about four 
years ago. I have never delivered it or read it since. I desire to find 
out what you think about it. It is about "The Most Beautiful of Cities," 
and it begins with a quotation. 

Kenneth L. Roberts said : "There is frequently a peacefulness 
and tranquility about various ancient things like old furniture and old 
books and old clothes and old cities, provided they were good before 
they began to grow old, that tend to soothe the minds of those who 
associate with them." 

"The inhabitants of the youngest states and the newest cities are 
the ones that emit ear-splitting screams of wounded pride and injured 
innocence at the mildest and most justified of criticisms." "Mormons" 
may modestly advertise Salt Lake City as a wonder, or an enchanted 
city and it might sound by comparison with New York, Chicago, or San 
Francisco like a child's description of a new henhouse, which may or 
may not be an exaggeration. I read Brisbane's comments as he passed 
through Salt Lake and, being a native, I branded him as a poor 
humorist. 

I am told, in a mild-mannered way, that Salt Lake City would have 
had a population of 500,000 people, if 350,000 hadn't gone to California. 
We have a process of cleaning our city of all growlers and kickers. 
We smoke 'em out and then the atmosphere clears, the sun shines, the 
grass turns green and the flowers grow, and we honestly can claim Salt 
Lake to be— "the Most Beautiful of Cities." 



54 



GENERAL CONEERENCE 



The following excerpts were taken from an article entitled "The 
West as I Saw Her." I read the article while in California, and if I 
had not written it down, I never would have had it, because I am like 
you people, I only hold a pint and I soon run out! The article was 
written by Shaw Desmond, Irish author and publisher, in the March 
number of Scribner's Magazine. The article is based on the writer's 
experience gathered during three visits to America in which he spent 
nearly a year, lecturing in the chief cities and covering some 50,000 
miles: 

"There is a City of Dreams in America as little known, so far as 
1 have read her guide-books, as one of Rider Haggard's Lost Cities of 
Africa. Nobody that I have met in America knows anything about this 
city, and this especially applies to those who say they have visited it. 

"It is easily the most beautiful city I have seen on the North Amer- 
ican continent. I think it must be one of the most beautiful cities in 
the world, and the way to it in mid-winter is hard and cold and cruel ; 
then, all at once, it burst upon me, 'my City Beautiful.' I was running 
into Salt Lake. Once more I, with whom the Indians had ridden along 
the invisible trail by the side of which the iron rails had been laid, seen 
by the eye of imagination, was looking at a tented wagon, at the 'prairie- 
schooner' of the old days, about it a body of silent men, with mouths of 
leather and jaws of steel as they broke through the last pass in the 
mountains to find the land of promise laid out before them with the 
snow-capped mountains eternally sentinelling," [Do you feel that? I 
feel that in every fibre of my being] "inside which they were to build 
their city, the city to be the most beautiful of the cities of the continent. 

"Europe believes two things about Salt Lake and believes them 
periodically. It believes that every man there has at least four wives 
and that every now and then its streets 'run with blood.' (Europe still 
has confused ideas about avenging angels.) My first difficulty in 
Salt Lake was to find a 'Mormon.' " [They are hunting for them yet !] 
"A red-faced man in a wondrous uniform of gold and crimson with a 
badge in his hat looked like the real thing, but upon near inspection and 
conversation, turned out to be a Baptist and a red-hot Baptist at that. 
He had some mystic job at 'meeting strangers,' though I did not find 
that he 'took them in.' I rather think they had to be Baptist strangers. 
Salt Lake City is the city of shocks. I received shocks to every pre- 
conceived opinion I had ever had about the 'Mormons,' not only did I 
discover that plural marriages are unknown, but that it was quite im- 
possible, save by a doubtful effort of imagination, to separate the sheep 
from the goats, that is to say, the 'Mormon' from the Gentile; and to 
you kind reader I leave it to decide which are sheep and which are 
goats." [And you have to have inspiration to separate them today. I 
am in favor of ear-marking and labeling them, so you will know them!] 
"I discovered a quiet respect for the 'Mormons' by their Gentile friends, 
a constant and ever-flowing tribute to 'Mormon' industry, 'Mormon' 
art, 'Mormon' initiative. The 'Mormons,' I discovered, were not '100' 
but '101' per cent Americans, obvious by their loyalty to the American 



ELDER J. GOLDEN KIMBALL 



55 



flag, proud of their American citizenship, and proving it all by shedding 
their blood under Uncle Sam in the great war." [By the way, the Kim- 
balls were just as loyal, for Heber C. Kimball had thirty grandsons in 
the world war. I am happy to say that not one of them was killed — 
and they did not run, either.] 

"I hold no brief for the 'Mormon' outlook," says this Irish poet, 
"but in a rather lengthy stay in Salt Lake, during which I was afforded 
unexampled opportunities of investigation free from 'suggestion,' I 
accumulated enough genuine data, checked from Gentile sources, to 
cause a revelation of the real 'Mormon,' whenever it is given to the 
world. I made hosts of friends at Salt Lake, where I lectured to all 
sorts and conditions of men and women, from the Chamber of Com- 
merce to a lecture under the auspices of the University of Utah. I came 
to the city without expectations, I left it with the picture of its icy 
snows under the dawns descending, as I lay in my room with its glass 
walls, left with the memory for all time of its broad streets, of its giant 
organ, upon which my 'Mormon' friend permitted me to play, of its 
white 'Mormon' temple, its lake of the dead and the limitless sage and 
salt surrounding it. It remains for me a remembrance unforgetable." 

Did you ever hear a "Mormon" talk like that ? Did you ever hear 
a "Mormon" damn this country? Well, I want to advise them to quit it. 
Every "Mormon," son and daughter, ought to lift up his voice in praise 
to God that he led those great prophets and their people to a place of 
safety. Think of it for one minute, my father, among the rest, was 
driven from his homes five times ! No wonder they felt to praise God 
and dedicate this place to his service. 

I have now come to what I want to burn into you, and I wish the 
Lord would give me the power to do it. 

A NEW GENERATION HAS ARISEN 

A prophet in the wilderness was still crying, but there were few to 
pay heed — there was scarcely anyone to listen — material force was in 
evidence in its might. It seemed so foolish to rely on so slender a 
thing as Divine support. 

It ought to be self-evident to a Pagan that arrogance and earthly 
power can vanish over night, all that is not built upon God shall fail. 
To trust to material standards of strength brings calamity ; material 
force, as apart from God and opposed to him, cannot succeed. Why 
can't race-"Mormons" understand that? 

A new generation has arisen ! The people seem so content, so free 
from all concern ; but like the Jews, in the days of Joseph, they can be 
hurled from their high position into the bitterness of slavery. And 
we are going into slavery and bondage, and debt, as fast as we can go ! 

We older men think our story should be told of our pioneer fathers 
and mothers, and the faith of our ancestors, and we write a book, preach 
a sermon or two, and think our task is ended. 

This new generation that has arisen have discovered over night 
that a new world has been born and that the United States of America 



56 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



is about to assume the responsibility of saving the world, and they are 
content and satisfied. 

At no time in the history of the Latter-day Saint people has there 
been greater danger for the new generation. The danger comes from 
ease, idleness, and luxury; as there never was a time when the people 
were spending their means as prodigally as now and ever reaching out 
after material things. 

The prodigal dollar seems to be swallowing all that is great and 
noble with some of the new and rising generation. 

To my mind many of the "Mormon" people are becoming content 
and self-satisfied. They show evidence of falling down in their spirit- 
ual efforts. I know it takes courage to say it. I know that if we say 
anything to criticize the "Mormon" people, they are disturbed. Well, 
they need to be disturbed ! What they need is a little dynamite ! It 
seems to me a great deal of that which has been gained by faith, adver- 
sity, sacrifice and years of hard work is being let loose of by the 
thoughtless and careless. 

Our fathers and mothers died for the faith and we are living on 
the faith of our pioneer ancestors : But behold ! another generation has 
arisen, and in the very instant of our self-content the silence is broken 
by our -being hurled from our mighty purpose. 

Joseph Smith, the mighty prophet, was chosen of God to send 
forth the message of salvation to the children of men — he was martyred 
— but that was not the end. It was the beginning of this great work. 

President Brigham Young rightfully succeeded him, and his fol- 
lowers with him fled to the Rocky Mountains. 

Brigham Young led the way for the first treckers of adverture- 
some spirit in the year 1847, and he and his followers were the original 
builders in what Daniel Webster christened "The Great American 
Desert." 

On entering the Salt Lake Valley, Divine Intelligence at once 
manifested itself in all his deliberations. "This is the place." Why, to 
some people that has become a chestnut, a hoary chestnut ! But it was 
inspiration from God. "This is the place." There beat in the heart of 
this great man — he was a master, a prophet of God — a great load of 
care, the destiny of his people! How I have suffered for just being 
the father of a family, the destiny of my children ! . And here was a 
great prophet, with the destiny of a great people. 

One has to believe to understand the destiny, object, and purpose 
of this people. The leaders understood and believed ; they knew ; God 
revealed it to them. President Brigham Young and his followers said, 
We will make this barren waste bloom and furnish clean, unsullied 
wealth for thousands of poor people from all over the world, who have 
been crushed under the Juggernaut of our Christian civilization — we 
are going to plant them under the shadow of the Rocky Mountains, we 
will create an Eden out of the desert, we will lay out townsites, cities, 
and build churches and schoolhouses and raise wheat and vegetables. 
God's children shall be converted to the gospel of. Jesus Christ and be 



ELDER J. GOLDEN KIMBALL 



57 



given land. They shall have a chance for life, liberty, and the pursuit 
of happiness. They shall know their toil will bring them some returns, 
so that they can have a home and a hope for the future. 

It was a big thought, a great idea, manifested by Divine Intelli- 
gence. He was a prophet. He had a vision of the future. 

These great leaders did not want the land and water for them- 
selves — they wanted men to be God's agents — stewards for God, and 
hold the land in trust as a sacred inheritance. This land was to belong 
to the lowly of the earth and to be saved for the hewers of stone and 
the drawers of water. 

When I think of my father, who had his inheritance, owned the 
land where most of the Capitol grounds are and away off to the left, 
I remember that he took these poor English people that had emigrated 
from Europe, and took them up on the hill, showed them a lot, and asked 
them if they would build a home, and they said they would, and it cost 
them $2.50! Heber C. Kimball and the brethren never speculated and 
made money off the people. Any charges to the contrary are false. 

These valleys in the mountains were to be made to bloom and blos- 
som for the poor, whose hope is the land, that gave them birth and life 
and would receive them in its bosom when they died and made a safe 
return to their home. 

Just take the time to think of the thousands of acres of lonely, 
thirsty land waiting for centuries to be reclaimed from the ruins of 
ages. They saw in vision green fields, and farms, just as Josepk Smith 
prophesied it would be. "It is the place where you'll find all the' things 
your souls are hungering for. Where the people will own big farms, 
with green fields of wheat and grass, with purple blossoms and long 
rows of fruit trees and vegetables." Is that true? It should be true, 
and that was the intent and purpose of our leaders. My father pleaded 
with his family, almost as he would plead for life, to keep their inherit- 
ance. I am the only one of them on the block, and I am trying to sell, 
too! 

All will be most beautiful, in the Desert ! Through those words 
I can get a vision. I have a moving-picture mind. It was a vision, a 
dream come true. Nobody was there to despoil their dream. 

A new generation has arisen. Think of your pioneer fathers and 
mothers who built better than they knew. Think of the men, women, 
and children toiling in sweat shops, with little food, families without 
money, without hope and without fuel, facing cold winters in these 
great cities, who have been gathered to a barren empire which our 
ancestors have transformed into an Eden — a land of liberty — a home 
for the oppressed of God's children, where they can have life, liberty 
and the pursuit of happiness to worship God according to the dictates 
of their conscience. The stranger has found his way amongst us and 
many of us have "sold our inheritance for a mess of pottage" and are 
seeking elsewhere hoping for more ease, more idleness, more luxury. 
In this once lonely, sage-covered, wind-swept valley there should be 
erected a granite monument and written thereon this epitaph : 



58 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



''Who seeks for heaven alone to save his soul, 
May keep the path, but will not reach the goal, 
While he who walks in love may wander far, 
Yet God will bring him where the blessed are." 

Henry VanDyke. 

On that occasion, looking upon those people in the San Francisco 
chapel and I prophesied; (You know I am a son of a prophet.) and our 
young elder there, Joseph E. Larkin, wrote: 

"A prophecy made by President J. Golden Kimball of the First 
Council of Seventy, at a meeting held in the San Francisco L. D. S. 
chapel, March 16, 1924, and is, as near as I remember, as follows : 

" 'I prophesy that before many of you go to the other side you 
will have a burning desire in your hearts to return to the places where 
the leaders of the Church have counseled the Saints to settle, and you 
will give anything in the world to have a home there.' " 

Brethren and sisters, I am told that North and South America is 
Zion, but with all of its beauty and splendor and wonderful opportu- 
nities, there is no place in the world as safe for the Latter-day Saints 
as where God's servants had their inheritance. God bless you. Amen. 

The choir sang, "Hark, hark, my soul," with Jane Van Roosendaal, 
Nellie Katwyk and Nellie Bruin singing the solo parts. v 

President Kimball announced that the audience had certainly appre- 
ciated the music rendered by the Choir, "I always feel to bless our 
singers.'; 1 

The benediction was pronounced by Elder Arthur Barnes. 

SECOND OVERFLOW MEETING 

A second overflow meeting of the conference was held in the 
Assembly Hall at 2 o'clock, Sunday afternoon, April 3. 

Elder Rulon S. Wells, of the I r irst Council of Seventy, presided. 

The music was furnished by the Dutch choir, of Salt Lake City, 
Elder A. Van Roosendaal, conductor; Elder Frank W. Asper at the 
organ. 

The choir and congregation sang, "How firm a foundation." . 
The opening prayer was offered by Elder R. S. Collet. 
Miss Nellie Bruin sang a solo, "Save me, O Lord." 

ELDER BRIGHAM S. YOUNG 

Former President Northwestern States Mission 

My dear brethren and sisters: It is a great privilege I enjoy in 
standing before you for a few moments. During that time I trust that 
I may enjoy the spirit of the conference, which has marked the pre- 
ceding meetings of the morning. I have recently returned from a mis- 
sion to the Northwestern states. It was a glorious period in my life. 
One of my regrets is that every man in our communities may not have 



ELDER BRIGHAM S. YOUNG 



59 



the pleasure and enjoy the profit of presiding over a mission. It is one 
of the finest and most developing experiences that can come into the 
life of a Latter-day Saint. 

Perhaps the most baffling and most difficult problem to overcome 
in missionary labor is the indifference of the world to the gospel of the 
Lord Jesus Christ. We learn that men of intelligence, who are other- 
wise engaged in the deep quest for truth, give no consideration to the 
most wonderful and vital philosophy that has ever been revealed to 
the world, in the system incorporated in the gospel of Jesus Christ and 
revealed through the Prophet Joseph Smith. It establishes an idealism 
that is incomparable, in the history of the world, except where the truth 
has formerly existed. Men who are seeking the good of their fellows, 
if they would but heed the call of the gospel, could accomplish to the 
fullest of their heart's desire. I was disappointed in men whom I met, 
men of high character, men of intelligence, men with vast intellectual 
understanding, but who were incapable, apparently, of seeing either the 
philosophy or the wondrous saving power incorporated in the system 
of theology revealed through the Prophet Joseph Smith. And yet 
when I come to draw comparisons between the indifference of the peo- 
ple of the world and, unhappily, the indifferences manifest among the 
people here at home, I am not so greatly astonished. 

Today marks the 97th anniversary of the establishment of the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. How far have we who 
have lived in the light of that gospel progressed under this wonderful 
system that God has given us for our development? You have but to 
ask yourselves what effect it has had in our lives ; and as it has affected 
our lives, so have we made progress. As we advantaged ourselves of 
that which the gospel has for all men, and particularly for those of us 
who have been reared in it, to that degree are we extended in the 
breadth and depth of our understanding. The gospel is of a character 
that a man may be benefited by it if he will, but it has no help for the 
man who fails to take advantage of that which it offers. It is a perfect 
system of self-development. A man can rise to the most exalted heights, 
if he will ; or he may loiter by the way, waste the day-light until he is 
overtaken in his darkness and thence must grope his way, because he 
failed to take advantage of the light. 

Today is our day, brethren and sisters. We cannot hope, when 
the night comes, when the grave has demanded its own, for the develop- 
ment and progress that is available to us today. These bodies of ours 
God has given us for development. We are separated from them when 
we go into the grave. We are not ourselves, we are only partial when 
the body and the spirit are separated. Why will we loiter, instead of 
developing that which is perfect, the human soul. Separated, it is a 
divided thing; together, it may rise to the most exalted height. We 
preach to the world faith. Have we faith? We preach to the world 
repentance. Do we repent? Do we place our feet each day upon the 
mistakes of yesterday, using them as stepping stones to a higher life, 
to the new birth symbolized by the baptism of water? Have we taken 



60 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



to ourselves every day the new birth of the Spirit? Have we risen to 
more exalted heights? Are we in closer communion with God than 
we were yesterday? If not, we have failed to take advantage of the 
opportunity offered in the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. 

The prophet said, "You must acquire capacity." To do what.' To 
endure, to suffer, to wait, to be patient, to plod, ever with the goal in 
view of the service of the Almighty and the salvation of his children. 
The reason God is God is because he has acquired all for which we are 
laboring. To the degree that we fail in acquisition and development, to 
that degree must we wait before we can come into the presence of him 
who has overcome all things. 

It is true that we have the gospel of Jesus Christ, but it is only of 
value to us as we profit by what it offers. Are we profiting? That is 
for us to answer. If we are not honest, if not truthful, do not love our 
neighbors; if we are not devoted to the service of God, we have lost, 
have failed in development, failed in expansion. We have failed, as the 
Prophet adjured us, in the acquisition of capacity. 

The glorious thing in this gospel to me is, as the Prophet has told 
us, that we must acquire capacity that we may learn how to be gods 
ourselves. The most tremendous thought that was ever revealed to 
the human family was, that we, the sons of God, may rise to be what 
he is. That is the most glorious thing that ever animated the human 
heart or stimulated the human mind, that we, weak, erring though we 
are, may be even as God, our Father. What a tremendous thought. 
Can we do it by permitting ourselves to be engaged in the grovelling 
things of the world, or descend into the filth that marks the age in 
which we live, or shall we rise above it ? As Brother J. Golden Kimball 
said here this morning, shall we think for ourselves? Shall we be of 
those who radiate the light of the gospel of the Son of God, or shall we 
follow after the world, partaking of what the world has to offer and 
sharing in the sufferings that must inevitably ensue? Sin is death, as 
righteousness and the works of God are salvation. Let us hold, as 
Shakespeare says, a mirror up to our souls wherein we may see re- 
flected what we are. We are radio stations. From us emanates just 
what we are. We are sending out into the universe these flashes that 
come from the human heart, that come from the soul which is a god in 
embryo. 

This people, after 97 years of activity and teaching, should be as a 
city set upon a hill. And, as was said here this morning, Salt Lake 
City is a noted city, by reason of its history, its manner of establish- 
ment, the circumstances which produced the development of this inter- 
mountain country. We are a noted people, by reason of the achieve- 
ments of the Latter-day Saints in the valleys of the mountains. This 
is a remarkable city. But, if we were living as the Almighty intends 
that we should live, we would be so remarkable that no man or woman 
would come among us but would testify of the truth that this is 
indeed the city of the Saints, a place where God abides. 

I am anxious for our people. I am anxious that the gospel of Jesus 



-ELDER BRIGHAM S. YOUNG 



61 



Christ may be extended to the world. We can preach it. May all of 
us in our lives so manifest the glories of the gospel that men and women 
shall praise God because of having seen manifest in us the gospel of 
his Son. This I ask in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER JOHN H. ANDERSON 

Former President Swedish Mission 

My dear brethren and sisters: I sincerely pray that God may 
inspire me with his holy Spirit in what I shall say. 

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has a message to 
the world : they declare that God created the heavens and the earth and 
all that is in them; that he is the Father of our spirits; that we lived 
with him in the eternal world; and that Jesus Christ is his only be- 
gotten Son, the Savior and Redeemer of the world. Further, that God 
arranged a plan before this earth was organized by which his sons 
and daughters who would obey could return into his presence. 

The fundamental of that plan is faith in God and in his Son Jesus 
Christ. Jesus, in speaking to the Jews, called their attention to this 
very important fact. He asked them, "Do ye believe in God?" They 
claimed to believe in God. Then he said, "Believe also in me." Have 
the people of the world the message of Jesus Christ? Do they actually 
believe in him as the Savior and Redeemer of the world? Christ says, 
"Whither I go ye know, and the way ye know. Thomas saith unto him, 
Lord, we know not whither thou goest ; and how can we know the way ? 
Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth and the life: no man 
cometh unto the Father, but by me." Jesus is the way, the truth and 
the light ; no man cometh back to God except through Jesus Christ. 

This plan requires not only faith in God and in his Son, but it 
requires repentance from sin, leaving off wickedness and all that which 
is wrong before God ; for if one desires to enter into the presence of 
God, one's sins must be taken away. The plan provides baptism for 
the remission of sins. And in order that one may remain faithful and 
true to God, so that he shall not falter by the way-side, a further 
arrangement is provided, the bestowal of the Holy Ghost, which leads 
men and women into all truth, leads them back to God, and makes 
it possible for them to live that Christ-like life which shall eventually 
prepare them for, and entitle them to, eternal life. 

We read in the holy scriptures that Jesus took Peter, James and 
John upon the Mount and there conversed with Moses and Elias, and a 
cloud over-shadowed them, and a voice was heard from the cloud say- 
ing, "This is my Beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased, hear ye him." 
Was this voice only to Peter, James and John? It was the voice of God 
to all his children, born and unborn, declaring that this was his Son 
Jesus Christ, the well beloved. "Hear ye him." Have the people of 
the world caught the echo of the sound of that voice? Has faith entered 
into their souls? Do they believe Jesus Christ to be the very Son of 
God, as the Father declared he was? More than a hundred years ago 



(»2 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



this same voice came back to the earth and declared to the boy prophet, 
Joseph Smith, that this was his beloved Son and to hear him, and from 
that day to this the message has gone forth from the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints that God has again spoken, declared anew 
the divinity of his Son, the way to salvation, the plan prepared for his 
children, that it might be possible for them to return to him and gain 
eternal life. 

What the world needs today is a spiritual awakening, a realization 
of what God requires of them, a turning away from sin, seeking the 
way to which Jesus Christ calls attention. 

Jesus remarked to his disciples, when he sent them out to preach 
the gospel and to baptize in the name of the Father and of the Son and 
the Holy Ghost, "I will be with you even unto the end of the world." 
But what requirements did he make? "Observe all things whatsoever 
I have commanded you." That warning is to all the world, to those who 
accept Jesus Christ and the gospel plan. They are required to observe 
and keep all of the commandments and the sayings of Jesus. If it so 
be that we do that, he will be with us even to the end of the world. 
Salvation and exaltation are promised only upon condition that we 
remain faithful unto the end. 

I bear witness to you this afternoon that the gospel of Jesus Christ 
is restored and that this is the Church and kingdom of God established 
upon the earth. I also bear witness to you of the truth of the saying of 
Jesus when he said that the kingdom of heaven is likened unto a pearl 
of great price, that when men found it they went and sold all that they 
possessed that they might possess that pearl of great price. 

The gospel of Jesus Christ means more to me than all the gold and 
silver of this world, and all that this world has to offer. I prize my 
standing in this Church above all. And I pray that God will bless you, 
and each of us, that we may continue faithful unto the end, and those 
who have not yet made covenant with God, that they may seek until 
they shall find. Go to God and he will not turn away from you tyut 
will show you the way, the truth, that shall eventually save and exalt 
you in his presence. God bless you. Amen. 

ELDER JOSEPH QUINNEY, JR. 

Former President Canadian Mission 

I believe I appreciate the great responsibility that rests upon one 
who is called upon to proclaim the gospel of our Lord and Master Jesus 
Christ. Four years ago, it was my privilege to enter the ministry in 
the Dominion of Canada. During that length of time there have been 
many experiences which have come to me, for which I am grateful. 
Like President Young, I feel that if it were possible for every man to 
be called into the ministry, what a wonderful blessing it would be to 
him. I appreciate beyond my power to express to you today the honor 
that came to me to preside over one of the missions of the Church. I 
am grateful to the authorities of the Church that they have had confi- 



ELDER JOSEPH QUINNEY, JR. 



63 



dence in me that has given me inspiration and encouragement to 
work in that part of God's vineyard. I am grateful that I have 
been associated with young men and women who have devoted them- 
selves to the work of the ministry, in bearing their testimony concern- 
ing this great and mighty work. I am grateful that I succeeded a man 
who had spent a number of years in different parts of the world, whose 
experience taught me many things. I am grateful that there has been 
a man chosen and selected to take my place who is filled with the testi- 
mony of this work, whose fine intelligence and spirit will count much 
for his leadership in that part of the world. It was my privilege to ac- 
company him during three or more weeks through different parts of 
the mission, and I want to say in favor of President Charles H. Hart, 
that he has won for himself a place in the hearts of those with whom 
he has come in contact. I am sure that his leadership will bring many 
souls to a knowledge of this work. I am grateful for my honorable re- 
lease. I am grateful for the responsibilities that now confront me. 
And through the help of God I hope and pray that I shall always be 
engaged in some activity where my life will touch the hearts of men 
and women and inspire them to a greater realization of the greatness of 
the gospel of our Lord and Master Jesus Christ. This period of my 
life in the Canadian mission has been the greatest since I can remember. 
I have filled missions before, but I believe that I have a deeper under- 
standing of life as it fits into the gospel of our Lord and Master than 
I ever have had before. My testimony concerning the divinity of this 
work has grown, and my joy has been when the opportunity has come 
to me to stand in the presence of men and women, on the streets, 
in the halls and in the cottages, bearing witness to the restoration of 
the gospel of our Lord and Master Jesus Christ. 

ijust prior to the time of my departure from the mission field, I 
was invited into a home, and in the course of our evening's conversation, 
naturally we drifted upon those principles that we were advocating. 
The gentleman of the home made this statement, "I believe that you 
have one of the finest and best religions that I have ever known, but 
there is one thing that I cannot understand or comprehend : Why is it 
necessary in this day and time to have a prophet, or prophets of God?" 
I asked him if he accepted the Bible as being the word of God. His 
reply to me was that he accepted this sacred record. 

"You believe, do you, that Adam, in the beginning, talked with 
God, and that it became necessary for God to reveal to him his mind 
concerning the gospel of Jesus Christ at that time?" He said, "I ac- 
cept that without any mental reservations." 

"You accept the thought, do you, that is expressed in Holy Writ, 
that God directed Noah through the light and power of his Holy Spirit 
to do the work that he did, and that Noah was in constant communi- 
cation with him concerning the work that he should do, in order to 
bring the gospel message to those who were then living?" 

"I accept of that," he said. 

"And you accept the historical record that Enoch talked with God, 



64 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

and that all that Enoch did in bringing to pass the proper interpretation 
of the gospel of our Lord was a necessary thing in his day?" 

"I accept that without any mental reservations," he said again. 
And so we went down through the prophets until we came to the day 
of our Lord and Master Jesus Christ. We asked him the question if 
he accepted in his heart the plan of life and salvation as it is recorded 
in the New Testament, and that that plan of life and salvation affected 
human life here, hereafter, and in the days before we came into the 
earth. He said, "So far as I have been able to see and understand, I 
believe Jesus Christ is the Son of God, that he is the author of such 
a plan as you suggest, and that he was guided and directed by the spirit 
of revelation in all the things that he accomplished while he was upon 
the earth; that, through his sonship, through his mission as the Mes- 
siah, as the Redeemer of the human race, he brings not only salvation 
here upon the earth but an exaltation through obedience to his prin- 
ciples in the kingdom of God, in the hereafter." 

I said to him, "If you believe all of that, I think that I am able to 
reason with you and show you how necessary it is to accept Joseph 
Smith as an instrument in God's hand in bringing to pass the restora- 
tion of the gospel of our Lord and Master Jesus Christ." 

He replied, "I would be glad if you could impress that thought in 
my heart and in my mind." 

We therefore referred to that passage of scripture that we so fre- 
quently use in the ministry, the revelation of John, while he was upon 
the isle of Patmos : "And I saw another angel fly in the midst of 
heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell 
on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people. 
Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him ; for the 
hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made heaven, and 
earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters." And I asked him if 
he believed in that scripture. 

He said, "I must accept of it, if I accept of Jesus Christ the Lord, 
because it was his gospel that the angel was to bring." 

"Then you must accept the thought that either that angel has come 
and delivered his message, or that he is to come." 

"I believe," said he, "that that angel must come or that he has 
come." 

Then we spent the remainder of the evening in explaining to him the 
claims that were made by the Prophet Joseph Smith concerning the ad- 
vent of the angel Moroni, bringing to him the everlasting gospel, as we 
see it and understand it and feel it, as we read those passages in the Book 
of Mormon. We were able to come to a conclusion that the gospel of 
our Lord and Master had been restored to the earth. His heart was 
lifted and there seemed to be a spirit take possession of him and he 
praised God. From the expressions that followed, weeks afterwards 
I am sure of his appreciation of the knowledge and the feeling that he 
had concerning the divinity of this work. 

My brethren and sisters, I believe there is no need in all the world 



ELDER JOSEPH QUINNEY, JR. 



65 



that is of greater importance to us than to have a deeper meaning of 
the gospel of our Lord and Master. I wonder, sometimes, if we under- 
stand that passage of scripture that is so frequently quoted in the 
world: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten 
Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have ever- 
lasting life." I wonder if we catch the significance and the depth of 
that thought, that love. We know our love for our own offspring, and 
how difficult it would be for us to sacrifice any one of them for a 
cause, unless we were commanded of God. I believe that we can under- 
stand pretty well what Abraham was up against when he was com- 
manded by God the eternal Father to offer his son Isaac as a sacrifice. 
But that was not comparable to the love that God had for his children 
here upon the earth, that he would offer his only begotten Son to re- 
deem mankind, to introduce into the world a plan of life and salvation, 
that by yielding obedience to it we would receive our exaltation in God's 
celestial kingdom. And that is what the message of Jesus Christ means 
to every man and woman in this world, so far as they are able to under- 
stand it. 

I am thankful, beyond my power to express, that I have had the 
opportunity of bearing witness that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the 
living God, that- the gospel of redemption was instituted by him in the 
eternal worlds before his advent into mortality, that I was a party with 
you in accepting of that plan. I am grateful that I have had the priv- 
ilege of bearing witness that the restoration of that gospel has come to 
mankind through the instrumentality of the Prophet Joseph Smith. 

I stand as a living witness to the healing power of God, my eternal 
leather. Had it not been for the power of the Priesthood of God, I 
should not be here today, I should have passed on years ago. But 
through the love of God, through his son Jesus Christ, the recognition 
of his Priesthood, the healing power thereof, I have been permitted to 
live on the earth, to leave my testimony not only at home but in many 
of the nations of the world and on the islands of the seas. I bear it 
to you at this particular time, and ask God to bless it and sanctify it 
to our use and us to his service, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The choir sang, "God is with his people," Elder D. Jongejan sing- 
ing the solo part. 

ELDER E. L. BUTLER 

Former President Samoan Mission 

When I was introduced as one who has been president of the 
Samoan mission, I imagine, possibly many of you felt somewhat as 
Brother Parry, who, when I was bringing some children with me 
through the Temple grounds with a party of tourists a week or so ago, 
asked if there were any missionaries present, and if so to stand up. 
When I arose, he said, "Brother, where were you a missionary?" I 



66 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



said, "In Samoa." And he said, after scratching his head, "All right, 
I'll bite. Where is Samoa?" 

I assure you that it is indeed a pleasure to me to be here today. I 
certainly enjoyed the first meeting of this conference in the Tabernacle 
this morning, the good sermons of President Grant and President Ivins. 
It has been nearly six years since I had the opportunity of attending 
a general conference of our Church. I have been in the islands for five 
years and four months on this, my second, mission to Samoa. In all, I 
have spent about nine years in the islands. 

Possibly that mission seems insignificant to many in this audience, 
but it might surprise some of you to tell you that we have more ad- 
herents to our Church in Samoa than we have in the whole great con- 
tinent of Australia. And I believe there are just as faithful souls among 
the Saints in that mission as there are in any other mission in the world. 
I believe that last year we had more converts in that mission, with our 
eighteen missionaries, than they had with somewhat more than forty 
in the Australian mission. They are sincere converts, and they are a 
fine race of people. And what I would like to say today, if God will 
bless me with his Holy Spirit while I stand before you, is something 
that will cause the mothers, the fathers, or the brothers and sisters, or 
those who are supporting their loved ones in the various mission fields, 
to feel that their means are not wasted. I want to thank the fathers and 
the mothers, yes, and the brothers and the sisters, of those missionaries 
we have in Samoa for the hearty support they have given them, 
in the way of encouraging letters, and in the money expended 
to care for those missionaries while they are in the mission field. 
Brethren and sisters, your means and your kind words are not wasted. 
Those missionaries are giving an account of themselves, are doing a 
splendid work ; and the prophet of God is not wrong when he is sending 
out somewhat more than 1,200 missionaries each year to different parts 
of the world. As Brother Young and Brother Quinney have said, it is 
one of the grandest opportunities that comes into a man's or a woman's 
life. Many of us who are in this audience are missionaries or have 
been missionaries. Some of you are sending your boys and girls ; some 
of you are waiting for their return. Sometimes we feel that it is a sac- 
rifice, that it is hard to raise the means to support John while he is 
away, or Mary while she is in the mission field. But it is just as es- 
sential that we work for the development of the spiritual side of the 
nature of our children as it is that we work for the development of their 
mentality, or the development of the physical side of their natures. 
With all due respect to the work accomplished by the auxiliary organ- 
izations of our Church, the greatest training our children get is when 
they are in the mission field preaching the gospel. 

I want to tell of a few little incidents that happened while I was 
in the mission field, just to illustrate the experiences that your sons 
have. After I left Salt Lake City and while we were on board the 
steamer, I was in charge of a company of eleven missionaries a num- 
ber of them going to Honolulu, the others to the Samoan mission. On 



ELDER E. iL. BUTLER 



67 



the way between here and the Hawaiian Islands, there was on board 
an officer of the Reorganized Church, and we had many opportunities 
for a discussion of the principles of the gospel. At Honolulu another 
officer of the Reorganized Church came on board, and he asked the 
privilege of explaining to these young men the difference between our 
doctrines and those of the Reorganized Church. He said, "Some day 
we expect to have all you 'Mormons' come in with us in the true 
Church." I said, "All right, brother, but if you want to explain your 
side of the question to these young men, I think it no more than fair 
that I have a chance to answer you and have them all listen." He said 
that was fair. I said, "I have no doubt that any one of them could 
answer you all right, but I ask that privilege." 

We went to one of the largest staterooms on the boat, and for an 
hour and a half this man explained the principles of his religion and 
the difference between the "Mormon" Church and the Reorganized 
Church. We did not have time that day to finish our discussion, -but 
the next day we met in this same stateroom and for about an hour and 
a half I answered his arguments one by one to the best of my ability. 
I felt satisfied when these young men came up and shook my hand and 
said, "Thank God, we are 'Mormons.' " 

Brethren and sisters, as mission presidents, we are doing all we 
can for the development of your boys and girls who are placed under 
our care. We are doing our best for their benefit, to see that the spirit- 
ual side of their natures are developed as they should* be. But do not 
expect too much of the mission ! Do not expect too much of a mission 
president. I say, do not expect too much, but do all you can at home 
before they go on missions to see that they live their religion. Do not 
believe that old saying that a rough and ready boy, or one who has 
sown his wild oats, makes the best missionary. It may be true to the 
extent that the boy or girl who has the energy in them makes the best 
missionary, but it is not true that the one who has sown wild oats makes 
the best missionary. That is not true, because he has to overcome 
many of the characteristics developed through his life before he can 
be a true missionary. 

We have a varied experience in our mission. We have to learn 
another language, and we meet and do most of our work among the 
islanders, the natives. But we also have the opportunity of meeting 
the white people who are there. One or two instances I would like to 
relate. 

About three years ago, my wife and I were asked by a chaplain of 
the navy in Tonga Tonga, Tutuila, Samoa, to take charge of his service. 
(This is in line with the statement of President Grant this morning, 
speaking of the tolerance that is shown today toward our work.) The 
chaplain sat in the back of the hall. We had an audience of about 
forty-five or fifty, consisting" mainly of the officers of the U. S. Navy 
with their wives. Governor Kellogg of American Samoa was present. 
We did our best to present the truths of the gospel to those people. Most 
of them had never heard the principles of our religion. You can judge of 



68 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



our success by the fact that when that meeting was closed, from the Gov- 
ernor down, every one came and shook our hands and invited us into 
their homes — something which had never been done before. Later we had 
an opportunity of holding service there a number of times. The youngest 
elder in our mission at that time, Elder Benham, from Clinton, held serv- 
ice there. At one time when the chaplain had gone away the Governor 
came to me and told me that he was going to ask one of our missionaries 
to take charge of the Thanksgiving service for the Navy, because the 
chaplain would be away. Elder Benham, who had associated with these 
people, was chosen to take charge of that service. That chaplain had ex- 
perienced difficulty in getting more than five to ten out to his services, 
but on the morning when Elder Benham went down, the sailors, the 
officers, got together and they were practically all unanimous in their 
decision to attend the service — because of their love and respect for the 
"Mormon" missionary; not because of the principles of the gospel of 
Jesus Christ, but on account of their love and respect for that young 
man who was holding the service. 

We had the opportunity of entertaining Sir Charles Fergusson, the 
Governor General of New Zealand, and Lady Fergusson at our mission 
headquarters in Apia, Samoa, together with Sir George Richardson, 
the Governor of Western Samoa, and Lady Richardson, his wife. 
I presented both of those gentlemen with a volume of the book, The 
Fruits of Mormonism, by Dr. F. S. Harris and N. I. Butt. I learned 
afterwards that the gentlemen read those books. They acknowledged 
to me that they did not know anything about "Mormonism," but they 
told one of our elders later, when they visited one of the other islands, 
that they were interested in our doctrines. At the time that I was re- 
leased to come home and my successor, Elder Willard Smith, from 
Canada, was appointed to take my place, we called upon Sir George 
Richardson at his home. I might say, incidentally, that it is the old home 
of Robert Louis Stevenson which is now the Government home. Our 
mission headquarters are in the shadow of the hill upon which is located 
the grave of Robert Louis Stevenson. We called at the home, and met Sir 
George Richardson and Lady Richardson, and introduced President 
Smith and his wife. Afterwards we met him in his office, and we 
talked over business affairs, and he said that he had great respect for 
the work we are doing in Samoa, and said that as far as it is in his 
power, he will give us his support. He said that he and his wife had 
often talked about the character of the "Mormon" elders. He said 
there had been many come to Samoa since he had been there, three 
and a half years, and he had never known one of them to commit an 
act that would bring disrepute upon his name. And he said, "You 
know, Elder Butler, how many young men I have had to send back to 
New Zealand because of their acts in coming to this island. Why is 
it that your boys come out here, young men, and can stay here three 
years, and we never hear of a smirch upon one of their names, but our 
boys come from New Zealand in governmental capacity for govern- 
ment positions, and we have to send a certain per cent of them back, 



ELDER E. <L. \BUTLER 



69 



because their acts are something that bring a stigma upon the gov- 
ernment?" I said, "It is the government that they have in their own 
homes and the teachings under which they are reared." 

I feel that I have talked long enough. I pray the blessings of our 
Father in heaven upon this audience, upon our conference, and I want 
all of you fathers and mothers to feel that whatever you expend in 
sending your boys and girls upon missions is well expended. 

God bless you is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER ANDREW JENSON 

Assistant Church Historian 

Just before Christ ascended into heaven, he addressed his apostles 
as follows : "All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth. Go ye 
therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the 
Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: teaching them to ob- 
serve all things whatsoever I have commanded you." (Matt. 28:18-20.) „ 

In obedience to that command the apostles of old and others 
preached the gospel, first, in Palestine, and later, in the surrounding 
countries. Paul, the apostle of the Gentiles, was the first missionary, 
as far as history tells us, to testify of the risen Redeemer in Syria, Asia 
Minor, Greece, Italy, etc. It is not known into how many countries the 
missionaries of the earlier Christian Church extended their operations, 
but it is an established fact that they preached in most, if not in all, the 
countries bordering on the Mediterranean. Some legends, at least, 
would have Thomas and others preach the gospel in England, as well 
as in far-off India. It must be remembered that the world was not 
known to the people in those days as it is now. For instance, America 
was perhaps not known to the people of the eastern world, nor was the 
south part of Africa known to the nations, in the northern countries, 
until centuries later. 

The angel designed to restore the gospel anew in our day is 
heralded by John the Revelator in the following language: "And I 
[John] saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the ever- 
lasting gospel to preach to them that dwell on the earth, and to every 
nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people, saying with a loud voice, 
Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come: 
and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the 
fountains of waters." (Rev. 14:6.) 

While the prediction reads that the angel had the everlasting gos- 
pel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, it is not to be supposed 
that he personally would have to proclaim it with his own voice, or by 
his own exertion to everybody. The natural conclusion is, that men in 
mortality would be called, as had been the case in all former dispensa- 
tions, to do the missionary work among their fellow-men. Thus it was 
that Joseph Smith was chosen as an instrument in the hands of the 
Lord to usher in a new dispensation, and no sooner had he been favored 



70 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



with a glorious vision, early in the spring of 1820 (in which he saw the 
Father and the Son), than he bore testimony of what he had seen and 
heard. Afterwards he received several visits from the Angel Moroni, 
in whose appearance the Latter-day Saints see the fulfilment of John's 
prediction. Several years passed during which other holy messengers 
restored the Priesthood to the earth through the instrumentality of 
Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery, and as soon as the Church was 
organized missionary labors were commenced in earnest. And while 
Oliver Cowdery is credited with preaching the first gospel sermon ever 
delivered by any elder of the Church in our dispensation, it is but fair to 
the Prophet Joseph Smith that he should be called the first Latter-day 
Saint missionary, for ever since he had received his first vision, in 1820, 
he, even in the midst of severe persecutions and sufferings, ceased not 
bearing his testimony to the effect that he had conversed with angels 
and had been chosen of the Lord to introduce a new gospel dispensation. 

By careful study of the early historical documents of the Church 
we have been able to ascertain that the Church sent out at least sixteen 
missionaries in 1830, including Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery, al- 
ready named. In addition to these, David Whitmer, Samuel H. Smith, 
Joseph Smith, Sr., Don Carlos Smith, Parley P. Pratt, Hyrum Smith, 
Newel Knight, Richard Ziba Peterson, Peter Whitmer, Jr., Sidney 
Rigdon, Frederick G. Williams, John Murdock and Orson Pratt, all 
performed missionary labors, in several of the states in 1830. The 
record also shows that fifty-eight missionaries were sent out from the 
headquarters of the Church to preach the restored gospel, in 1831, 
seventy-two in 1832, forty-one in 1833, one hundred eleven in 1834, and 
so on. 

Until 1837, the preaching by the elders was confined to the United 
States and Canada, but in 1837, Heber C. Kimball and others opened up 
the great missionary work which since that time has been carried on 
continuously in the British Isles. In 1843, the first missionaries were 
called to preach the restored gospel to a people who did not under- 
stand the English language. I have reference to the Society Islands 
mission, which was opened early in 1844 by Noah Rogers, Addison 
Pratt and Benjamin F. Grouard, who were called as missionaries to the 
islands of the Pacific in 1843. Two or three thousand natives of 
Tubuai, the Tuamotu Islands, and adjacent groups soon became identi- 
fied with the Church. 

During the exodus of the Saints from Nauvoo in 1846 and 1847, 
missionary labors were somewhat at a standstill, as many of the young 
brethren who had previously been engaged in the missionary fields 
were chosen as pioneers, or as soldiers in the Mormon Battalion, but 
after the Saints had found a more nearly permanent home in the valleys 
of the Rocky Mountains, missionary labors were carried on with vigor 
and much success. Then it was that the first missionaries were called 
to continental Europe, and also to the Hawaiian Islands ; soon branches 
of the Church were raised up in several European countries, and mis- 
sions established, most of which are in existence to this day. Alto-

gether the Church has established about forty distinct missions, known 
by the following titles : United States, Canadian, Palestine, Tahitian, 
French, Italian, Scandinavian, Swiss, Icelandic, South American, Ger- 
man. Maltese, West Indian, Gibralter, South African, Chinese, New 
Zealand, Siam, Netherlands, Samoan, Austrian, Finnish, Mexican, 
Turkish, Belgian, Tongan, Japan, Armenian, etc. 

The missionary labors in the United States have been grouped in- 
to several distinct missions, each of which includes several states, such 
as the Eastern States, the Northern States, the Southern States, the 
Indian Territory, the Central "States, the Western States, the North- 
western States, the California and the Northcentral States. The orig- 
inal Scandinavian mission has also been divided into the Swedish, 
Danish, and Norwegian missions. Also the British mission has, at 
times, been segregated into smaller groups which have been known 
under different titles, such as the English, the Welsh, the Scotch and 
the Irish. By recognizing these general sub-divisions we find that 
the Church since its organization, in 1830, has established about forty 
distinct and separate missions, of which twenty-seven are still in exist- 
ence. 

After a thorough study of Church history, and by gathering in- 
formation from all possible sources, we are now able to state from 
actual count that the Church, since its first organization in 1830, and 
until the close of the year 1926, has sent approximately 35,275 mission- 
aries out from the headquarters of the Church to preach the gospel in 
many lands and climes. But this number does not by any means rep- 
resent all the missionaries who have labored for the spread of the gos- 
pel. For, while the elders delegated and sent out from the headquarters 
of the Church usually opened up the several missions throughout the 
world, thousands of local elders (that is, converts who in the different 
states and countries were ordained to the ministry) have labored with 
equal zeal and success ; and particularly in countries where the English 
language is not universally spoken, these local, or native, elders have 
had, in many instances, even more success than some of those sent out 
from headquarters. In earlier days there were perhaps twenty local 
missionaries to each American elder in the British Isles, the Scandi- 
navian countries, and even in Germany and Switzerland. That rule, 
however, has been reversed in later years when most of the missionary 
work has been done by American elders. But taking a retrospective 
glance at the missionary operations of the Church, during the ninety- 
seven years of its existence, we are safe in making the assertion that, 
at least, 70,000 elders and missionary sisters, called and set apart regu- 
larly to the ministry, have been engaged in actual missionary labors in 
the world, by maintaining that the local, or native, elders have equalled 
in number the missionaries sent out from Church headquarters. 

In view of these facts, it may consistently be left to the good judg- 
ment of fair-minded persons who are interested in the great Latter- 
day work, commenced by the Prophet Joseph Smith under divine guid- 
ance, whether the elders and missionaries of the Church have been true

to their calling to preach the gospel as they have been commanded, to 
every nation, kindred, tongue and people. And especially when it is 
considered that this great host of laborers in God's vineyard have 
preached and labored mostly without purse or scrip, or at least have 
done their work at their own expense, or at the expense of parents, 
relatives and friends. 

If there are any countries in the world which have not been cov- 
ered by Latter-day Saint missionaries, it is surely not the fault of the 
Church, nor is it to be ascribed to any neglect on the part of its mission- 
aries. It is mostly due to the fact that religious liberty does not exist 
in all nations, and that, in many instances, our elders have been pro- 
hibited by stringent laws from ful filing the divine command. In several 
countries they have even been forbidden to land, and in other countries 
where they have succeeded in landing, they have been imprisoned and 
banished. I am convinced that the Church authorities have always been 
willing, and are still willing, to send elders to every nation under the 
sun, whose governments and inhabitants would be willing to receive 
them. God grant that the elders of modern Israel may soon enjoy the 
privilege of preaching the gospel, without hindrance, in all the world. 
Amen. 

ELDER RULON S. WELLS 

Of the First Council of Seventy 

I have greatly rejoiced in the testimonies and instructions we have 
received from our brethren, and in the excellent music which has been 
rendered here in this session of conference. Surely our hearts have 
been filled and we have rejoiced in the blessings of our heavenly Father. 
No greater work was ever undertaken than that of saving the souls of 
the children of men. No greater work has the Lord God of heaven 
ever undertaken than to save the souls of his children. It is the grandest, 
the greatest undertaking that ever has been inaugurated. Even he who 
fashioned the heavens and the earth, and all things that in them are, 
has no greater work than that of saving his own children. We find 
that in the revelations of God given to the Prophet Joseph, as recorded 
in The Pearl of Great Price. Indeed, it is the writings of Moses, trans- 
lated by the gift and power of God, through Joseph Smith the prophet, 
wherein he says, "This is my work and my glory, to bring to pass the 
immortality and eternal life of man." We may look out upon this great 
universe in which we live ; the planet on which we stand, the earth, 
is merely a little speck in that great universe ; yet, he it is who made 
that universe. And this earth upon which we stand, with all of its 
wonderful mechanism, with the wonderful revolutions which this earth 
makes upon its own axis, once in twenty-four hours, giving us day and 
night, and then upon its orbit around the sun in its allotted time of 365 
days 5 hours 46 minutes and 48' seconds, year in and year out with 
mathematical precision ! What a wonderful thing it is ! The other 
planets make similar revolutions in their allotted times. And then again 



ELDER RULON S. WELLS 



73 



we look farther out into the universe and see those glittering stars, each 
one, as we are told by astronomers, is a blazing sun, having its own 
planetary system similar to the one of our own solar system. How 
marvelous is the work of God, all over this universe! 

Is there anything greater than the making of a universe? Yes, 
to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of God's children. The 
worlds have been created to become the habitations of the children of 
God. Shall they be of greater consequence than the children of God 
themselves? Oh, no! The great work of God is to bring to pass the 
immortality and eternal life of his children. And it has been written 
that though a man shall labor his whole life and save but one soul, 
how great shall be his joy with that soul in the kingdom of our Father. 
These reflections ought to make us think seriously of this work of 
God, with which we are identified, and in which we should have our 
part, for he has invited us to have part with him in that great and glo- 
rious work. How great shall be our joy, or how great shall be the joy 
of those men and women who go out into the world, who leave their 
homes, their fathers and their mothers, their wives and their children, 
and all that they love and hold dear, and go out and devote years of 
their time in helping our Father in heaven to accomplish his great and 
glorious work of bringing his children to a knowledge of the truth, 
that they may have eternal life ! 

This gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ has within it the power of 
God unto salvation, it is working upon those who have embraced it, 
who have received it, and the result is that this people are the best peo- 
ple on all the face of the earth. It is working in their lives! Th^ey 
are learning how to do something for their fellow-men ; they are learn- 
ing how to control themselves and to become better men and better 
women day by day. And as we come from week to week, partake of 
the emblems of our Lord's suffering, to our Sacramental meetings, and 
there with clean hands and pure hearts, we are indeed eating and drink- 
ing eternal life into our souls. Why? Because in doing so we are 
keeping this command of God and bearing witness that we do always 
remember Christ, who gave his life as a ransom for all mankind. But 
we must come to the table of the Lord in a repentant mood ; full of 
faith, manifesting our faith in him 'as the Savior of the world, for there 
is no other name given under heaven whereby men and women can be 
saved. 

I say that this gospel is working. It is sanctifying and purifying 
our hearts ; if we are living it, and practicing the principles of the gospel 
of the Lord Jesus Christ, it is sanctifying our hearts, it is making us 
better men and better women than we were, we are growing in the 
knowledge of God and in good works day by day. That is the plan 
that the Almighty had, and he expects that his children shall derive the 
benefit if' they will only obey him. 

The saving of a human soul! What a great work it is. Even 
though that soul be only your own, what a great and glorious work it is, 
if you shall only succeed in that!

GENERAL C ONFERENCp 



What is a soul ? You know .there are a great many peculiar ideas 
in the world regarding- what a soul is. Men have an idea that it is 
something fluttering around on the inside of this anatomy, and they 
call it a soul. Contrast their vague conception of that soul with the 
clear, concise definition that was given to the prophet Joseph in that 
glorious revelation known to us as Section 88, in the Doctrine and 
Covenants, "And the spirit and the body are the soul of man." Our 
spirits which came from God, begotten of him in the eternal worlds, 
and for which this world was created, and our bodies that we obtained 
in coming here, constitute our souls. The spirit, dwelling in this body, 
animating it and making it alive, is a child of God. 

There are many things to accomplish in bringing to pass the soul's 
immortality and its eternal life, but before it can ever enter into the pres- 
ence of God it will have to be sanctified from all unrighteousness, for 
no unclean thing can enter there. And so we read in that same section 
of the Doctrine and Covenants, "And the resurrection of the dead is 
the redemption of the soul." The spirit and this body, in conjunction, 
make a human soul. After a while they separate and the spirit will 
go back to God, whence it came, and the body, the other part of that 
soul, will return to mother earth, whence it came, and that separation 
that takes place we call death, the natural death, the temporal death. 
But after a while it is to come and take up that body, this spirit is, and 
become immortal. By what power can that be done? By your own 
individual power? No. This same revelation explains by what power 
that shall be done, for it says, "The redemption of the soul is through 
him who quickeneth all things" — through him who created man in the 
very beginning, the Creator of the heavens and the earth, who makes 
the grass to grow, who makes the birds to fly, the fish to swim, the 
beasts to rove upon the fields — every living thing. Through him who 
quickeneth all things, through him shall be brought to pass this resur- 
rection from the dead which is the redemption of the soul. Redemption 
from what? From death and the grave. Therefore, we read on, "This 
soul must needs be sanctified from all unrighteousness." Why? "That 
it may be prepared for celestial glory." That is what the revelation 
says. Hence the gospel has been revealed, that we might sanctify and 
purify our lives from all unrighteousness. 

That is what the gospel is for, and it is working upon this com- 
munity. We are not all perfect ; we are a long way short of it, but it is 
working. It is making us better men and women than we were, we are 
growing in the knowledge of God and in good works day by day. Let 
us continue to advance and to grow. Let us lay hold on eternal life by 
keeping the commandments of God, by cleansing and purifying our- 
selves from all unrighteousness. That is what the gospel teaches us 
and that is what it is for. Now we hear of the glad tidings that come 
from the mission field, how our boys and girls, our young men and 
women, who go out as missionaries, are placing splendid examples be- 
fore the people in the world. What splendid news we hear of our 
young men and our young women everywhere throughout all the mis- 



ELDER RULON S. WELLS 



75 



sions of the world ! And we also hear a good report of our young men 
and our young women here at home. They are the best, the cleanest, the 
purest men and women, boys and girls, that are to be -found in all the 
world, freer from the contamination of the world, freer from those 
terrible diseases that afflict a wicked and a corrupt world. Let us con- 
tinue to walk in the truth, let us continue to abide in that gospel of the 
Lord Jesus Christ, for it will cleanse and purify us from all unright- 
eousness. 

This is the work of a lifetime. Do not get the thought that you 
are good enough just as you are, for though good as you are and clean 
as you are, honest as you are, virtuous as you are, we can all improve, 
every one of us. Let us grow in the knowledge of God and in good 
works. Let us not approach the world in that Pharisaical spirit, "I am 
holier than thou." Oh, no ; for "we are all sinners, and if any man 
think he is without sin, he deceiveth himself and the truth is not in 
him." What advantage, then, have we over the world? Why do our 
missionaries go out into the world if they are not perfect, if they are 
not free from sin and also have need to practice repentance? Do our 
missionaries need to repent? Of course, they do; so do you, and so do 
I, and so does every child of God. And there is no progress without 
repentance from sin, and without faith in God. These are matters for 
daily practice in these things that pertain to sanctifying and cleansing 
ourselves from sin. 

Good? Who is there that is good? Remember the Pharisee who 
came to the Savior and said, "Good Master, what good thing shall I do, 
that I may obtain eternal life?" And the Savior turned around to him 
and said, "Why callest thou me good? There is none good but one, 
that is God." That tells the story. We are weak, mortal, human beings, 
but we have received the gospel, that has within it the power of God to 
cleanse us from those sins and from that weakness. Why do we go 
out to the world? Because we received that gospel, and it is our duty 
to promulgate it and carry it to the farthest ends of the earth. We have 
advantages that the world does not have. And what are they? We 
have the help of God. And how does he help us? By giving us the 
Holy Ghost. But he does not give us that holy Spirit until we have been 
through this cleansing process, until we have faith in him, until we have 
repented of our sins, until our sins have been remitted by our being 
baptized, and buried with him by baptism unto his death and then come 
forth in the likeness of his glorious resurrection. Then we are pre- 
pared to receive that marvelous gift. And that is what we have re- 
ceived, and that is the way the Lord helps us to gain the victory over 
evil — by his help, the sweet companionship of his holy Spirit, and every 
man and every woman who receives this gospel has the gift of the 
Holy Ghost. It remains with them. Its influence is felt wherever they 
go. And those who come in contact with them feel in their souls that 
this is a servant of God, or a handmaiden of God, sent to them with 
a message of life and salvation; for they have the gift of the Holy 
Ghost; that is what our elders go out with. They go out prepared, 



76 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



having been endowed with power from on high. They go out pre- 
pared to bestow that gift upon their fellow-men, that they may have the 
same advantages which the Lord in his mercy and goodness has granted 
unto us. 

That is the gospel. Let us appreciate it. It is the power of God 
unto salvation. It is working with the Latter-day Saints. Let us en- 
deavor to make it work with all the children of God with whom we can 
possibly come in contact, for they are all the children of God, precious 
souls in his sight. He desires to save them. He loves them. He so 
loved them that he sent his Only Begotten Son into this world, that 
they might not perish, that those who belong to him and keep his com- 
mandments, obey his gospel, might obtain eternal life. 

Now, brethren and sisters, may the Lord bless us all ; may his Spirit 
be our constant guide and companion ; may we all grow in the knowl- 
edge of truth day by day and in good works, that we may glorify our 
Father in heaven, that those who see us shall glorify him and glorify 
his work, I humbly pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The choir sang, 'Tnflammatus," Mrs. Jane Van Roosendaal sing- 
ing the solo part. 

The benediction was pronounced by Elder Thomas Leishman. 



SECOND DAY 
MORNING MEETING 

The second day of the conference opened Monday morning at 
10 o'clock, April 4, 1927, with clear skies after the rain of the pre- 
ceding day. 

President Heber J. Grant presided. 

The choir and congregation sang, "Come, come, ye Saints, no toil 
nor labor fear." 

The opening prayer was offered by Elder David K. Udall, presi- 
dent of the Arizona temple. 

A duet, "See the mighty angel flying," was sung by J. A. Boshard 
and Bob Robinson. 

PRESIDENT RUDGER CLAWSON 

My brethren and sisters : I ask your support and faith for me dur- 
ing the few moments that I shall stand before you. 

The keynote of the conference, as it was given by President Grant 
yesterday, and quite strongly supported by the speakers who followed — 
his counselors and others included, was the divine mission of the Mes- 
siah, and also the divine appointment of Joseph Smith to be the restorer 
of the gospel. 

THE MISSION OF THE LORD JESUS CHRIST 

If I may have the power of utterance, I would like to dwell for a 
few moments on the mission of the Savior. We have no authentic pic- 
ture of the Savior, as we have no absolutely authentic picture of Joseph 
Smith, the Prophet. But we do have a pen picture of the Savior that 
has behind it reasonably good authority. It was published some years 
ago in the Millennial Star, and subsequently in the Juvenile Instructor. 
I am very sure that Latter-day Saints, and those who missed seeing 
this description would be very pleased to hear it now. We must take 
it for what it is worth, but I may say that it is a matter and a descrip- 
tion of very peculiar interest. It is taken from a letter from Publius 
Lentulus to the Senate of Rome concerning Jesus Christ : 

A DESCRIPTION OF THE SAVIOR 

"It being the usual custom of Roman Governors to advertize the Senate and 
people of such material things as happened in their respective provinces, in the 
days of the Emperor Tiberias Caesar, Publius Lentulus, President of Judea, 
wrote the following epistle to the Senate concerning the Savior : 

"Conscript fathers : There has appeared in these our days, a man of great 
virtue, named Jesus Christ, who is yet living amongst us, and of the people is 
accepted for a prophet of truth, but his disciples call him the Son of God. He 
raiseth the dead and cureth all manner of diseases — a man of stature somewhat 
tall and comely, with a very reverend countenance, such as the beholders may

both love and fear ; his hair of the color of a filbert full ripe, and plain to his 
ears, but thence downward it is more orient, curling and waving about his 
shoulders ; in the midst of his head is a wave or partition of his hair after the 
manner of the Nazarites ; his forehead plain and very delicate; his face without 
spot or wrinkle, beautiful with a lovely red; his nose and mouth so formed that 
nothing can be reprehended ; his beard thickish, in color like the hair of his head, 
not very long but forked; his look innocent and mature; his eyes grey, clear and 
quick; in reproving he is terrible; in admonishing, courteous and fair spoken; 
pleasant in conversation, mixed with gravity. It cannot be remembered that 
any have seen him laugh, but many have seen him weep. In proportion of body 
most excellent; his hands and arms most delectable to behold; in speaking, very 
temperate, modest and wise. A man of singular beauty, surpassing the children 
of men." 

isaiah's prediction of the coming of the lord 

The coming of the Savior was predicted by ancient prophets who 
looked forward to that event with joy and gladness of heart. In the 
ninth chapter of Isaiah we find these words : 

"For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given; and the government 
shall be upon his shoulder : and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, 
The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace. 

"Of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end, upon the 
thrcne of David, and upon his kingdom, to order it, and to establish it with 
judgment and with justice from henceforth even forever. The zeal of the Lord 
of hosts will perform this." 

T certainly feel, my brethren and sister.s, that these wonderful 
words could not then, and could not now, be applied to any man in the 
flesh upon the earth except the Messiah. And I may add that his birth 
was attended by a number of extraordinary incidents, giving proof that 
the heavens approved of his coming and rejoiced in his advent. 

THE ANNUNCIATION 

This very remarkable circumstance occurred just prior to his 
natal day : 

"And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city 
of Galilee, named Nazareth, 

"To a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of 
David; and the virgin's name was Mary. 

"And the angel came in unto her, and said, Hail, thou that art highly favored, 
the Lcrd is with thee : blessed art thou among women. 

"And when she saw him, she was troubled at his saying, and cast in her 
mind what manner of salutation this should be. 

"And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary : for thou hast found favor 
with God. 

"And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and 
shalt call his name Jesus. 

"He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest : and the 
Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David : 

"And he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever; and of his kingdom 
there shall be no end. 

"Then said Mary unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man ? 

"And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall come 
upon thee, and the power cf the Highest shall overshadow thee : therefore also 
that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God." 



PRESIDENT RUDGER CLAWSON 



79 



THE BIRTH OF CHRIST 

It was an extraordinary incident. And then again we read in the 
second chapter of Luke the very interesting account of his actual birth : 

"And so it was, that, while they were there, the days were accomplished that 
she should he delivered. 

"And she brought forth her first born son, and wrapped him in swaddling 
clcthes, and laid him in a manger ; because there was no room for them in the inn. 

"And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping 
watch over their flocks by night. 

"And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord 
shone round about them : and they were sore afraid. 

"And the angel said unto them, Fear not : for, behold, I bring you good ti- 
dings of great joy, which shall be to all people. 

"For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Savior, which is Christ 
the Lord. 

"And this shall be a sign unto you ; You shall find the babe wrapped in swad- 
dling clcthes, lying in a manger. 

"And suddenly there was with the angel, a multitude of the heavenly host 
praising God, and saying, 

"Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men. 

"And it came to pass, as the angels were gone away from them into heaven, 
the shepherds said one to another, Let us now go even unto Bethlehem, and see 
this thing which is come to pass, which the Lord hath made known unto us. 

"And they came with haste, and found Mary, and Joseph, and the babe lying 
in a manger. 

"And when they had seen it, they made known abroad the saying which was 
told them concerning this child. 

"And all they which heard it wondered at those things which were told 
them by the shepherds. 

"But Mary kept all these things, and pondered them in her heart. 

"And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things 
that they had heard and seen, as it was told unto them." 

THE DOUBTING OF THE JEWS 

Now, we see the birth of the Savior was attended by a number of 
very extraordinary incidents, but it seems that his birth was hidden 
from his people, the Jews, generally. And I think it was due to the fact 
that they were unbelievers. They could not bring themselves to ac- 
knowledge that this babe who was cradled in a manger was the Son of 
God, the Savior. It was true they were looking for him, but they ex- 
pected him to come with demonstrations of power, as King of kings and 
Lord of lords. The great mistake that the Pharisees, the Sadducees 
and others made in respect to this important event was that they had 
their'eyes upon the second coming of the Savior, and therefore over- 
looked his first coming. It was a sad mistake upon their part. I think 
it was rather fatal to their welfare, the lack of this knowledge ; and 
wherever there was a lack of faith, the Savior could do but very little. 

JOHN THE BAPTIST EVEN IN DOUBT ( 

Even John the Baptist, the forerunner of Christ, was somewhat in 
doubt concerning him. We read in Matthew 11:2-4: 

"Now when John had heard in the prison the works of Christ, he sent two 
of his disciples, 



80 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



"And said unto him, Art thou he that should come, or do we look for an- 
other ? 

"Jesus answered and said unto them, Go and shew John again those things 
which ye do hear and see : 

"The blind receive their sight, and the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, 
and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and the poor have the gospel preached 
to them." 

CHRIST ORGANIZED HIS CHURCH 

The particular attention that I wish you to give in respect to the 
divine mission of the Savior is this, that when he entered upon his min- 
istry, which embraced but a short period of time, he organized his 
church with apostles and prophets, pastors and teachers, high priests, 
seventies and elders, with bishops, priests, teachers and deacons. He 
gave to the world a complete plan of redemption, and in connection with 
this plan of redemption the Savior preached the gospel, the everlasting 
gospel, which was before and which would be after, and continuous. 
He said to his apostles on one occasion: "Ye have not chosen me, but 
I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth 
fruit." And this utterance of the, Savior signified, I think, the author- 
ity by which his apostles were called and sent forth, and also indicated 
in a way the will of God, because the Savior said, "I came not to do mine 
own will, but the will of him that sent me." And so of course we 
must assume that it was the will of the Father that he should organ- 
ize this church and put into it these various authorities. 

Christ's marvelous doings created a profound impression 

The marvelous work accomplished by the Savior, and his doings 
and sayings made a profound impression upon the world in his day, 
and upon the world in our day. It was the great central theme that is 
described by the Bible. The prophets of old were looking down to his 
day, and after his crucifixion the prophets were looking back to his 
day. It is said in the scriptures that Christ "went about doing good," 
and in reflecting upon that expression I have wondered in my own 
mind if a greater compliment or greater praise could be given to any 
man than that he went about doing good. But mark you, brethren and 
sisters, the fact that he did go about doing good brought down perse- 
cution upon him. It was not for any evil thing that he did that he was 
persecuted, because he was without sin. a righteous man. It was be- 
cause of his righteousness. 

under the spirit of persecution 

Paul, the apostle, in one of his epistles to Timothy said : "Yea, 
and all who live a godly life in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution." 
And persecution began with him very early and continued throughout 
his life. He said to his disciples upon one occasion : 

"Blessed are ye, when men shall hate you, and when they shall separate you 
from their company, and shall reproach you, and cast out your name as evil, for 
the Son of Man's sake. 



PRESIDENT RUDGER CLAWSON

"Rejoice ye in that day and leap for joy: for, behold your reward is great 
in heaven : for in the like manner did your fathers unto the prophets. * * * 

"But woe unto you, when all men shall speak well of you! for so did their 
fathers to the false prophets." 

Now, I apprehend, my brethren and sisters, that it would be very 
difficult for anyone of us to rejoice and "leap for joy" under the spirit 
of persecution, and yet we are enjoined to do that, and I think if we 
could do it, it would be a very proper thing, a very fine thing. Under 
that spirit of persecution Jesus the Lord was finally brought before 
Pontius Pilate and under some very extraordinary, foolish charges, he 
was condemned to death. The following is what purports to be the 
death warrant of Jesus Christ ; if it be true, and it seems to be, you will 
find it very instructive: 

"THE DEATH WARRANT OF JESUS CHRIST 

"Sentence rendered by Pontius Pilate, Acting Governor of Lower Galilee, 
that Jesus of Nazareth shall suffer death on tne cross. 

"In the year XVII of the Empire of Tiberias Caesar, and the 4th of March, 
the city of holy Jerusalem; Annas and Caiaphas being priests, sacrificers of the 
people of God. I, Pontius Pilate, Governor of the Praetory, condemn Jesus of 
Nazareth to die on the cross between two thieves — the great and notorious evi- 
dence of the people saying : 

"1. He is a seducer. 

"2. He is seditious. 

"3. He is the enemy of the law." 

And yet Christ said he came not to do away with the law, nor to 
condemn it, but to fulfil the law, because he was the Lawgiver. 

"4. He calls himself falsely the Son of God." 

Is not that an extraordinary charge to have been brought against 
the Savior — that he called himself the Son of God ? And the very peo- 
ple who brought the charge and prosecuted him to the bitter end were 
also sons of God. 

"5. He calls himself King of Israel." 

Now mark the sixth charge brought against the Savior. You will 
see how extraordinary it is : 

"6. He entered into the temple followed by a multitude, bearing palm 
branches in their hands. 

"Order the centurion, Quintos Cornelius, to lead him to the place of execu- 
tion. Forbid any person whomsoever, poor or rich, to oppose the death of Jesus. 

"Witnesses : 

"Daniel Robani, 

"(A Pharisee) 
"Janus Zorobabel 
" Capet, 

"(A citizen)." 

Jesus shall go out of the city by the gate Strenuous. Here is a note : 

"The above sentences are engraved on a copper plate, which was found in 
an antique vase of white marble, while excavating in the city of Aquilla, in the 
kingdom of Naples, in the year 1825. It was discovered by the Commission of

enclosed in a box of ebony* in the sacristy of Courtem. Mr. Dennon, of tte Com- 
mission of Arts, caused a model to be made of the plate. At the sale"of his 
curiosities it was bought by Lord Howard for 5,844 francs (f243, 10s).—

THE APOSTLES ALSO SUFFERED PERSECUTION 

1 might say in conclusion, my brethren and sisters, that the apos- 
tles of the Savior suffered also most seriously from the spirit of perse- 
cution. All of the apostles, as I remember it, except one, gave their lives 
for the testimony of Jesus. John only escaped because of the promise of 
the Master, who said that he should live until Christ's second coming. 

I am sure a contemplation of these things will be very profitable to 
us. The Lord bless you, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH 

I feel very humble this morning, and my soul is filled with grati- 
tude to our heavenly Father for membership in this Church. Of all the 
blessings that have come to me in life the most precious is the knowl- 
edge that God lives and that this is his work, because that comprehends 
all other blessings that I may hope to enjoy in this life or in the life that 
is to come. 

THE WEATHER FIFTY-SEVEN YEARS AGO 

Fifty-seven years ago today, I am informed by good authority — 
the testimony of my mother — there were two feet of snow on the 
ground in the Salt Lake Valley. And when I contrast this beautiful 
morning — the sun shining, birds singing and flowers in bloom — I have 
an impression that there is quite a difference in the climatic conditions. 
And I also have reason to believe that there is a very great difference 
in the general condition of our country and the circumstances sur- 
rounding the membership of this Church, since April 4, fifty-seven 
years ago. 

MANY CHANGES IN OUR LIVES 

It is peculiar how many things transpire in our lives in a short 
period of time. If you men and women who are here who have passed 
fifty years of age will review and consider how many remarkable cir- 
cumstances have transpired, how many inventions and discoveries have 
been recorded, within your memory, you will realize that we are mov- 
ing at a very rapid pace. 

THE GOSPEL WILL BE PROCLAIMED IN POWER 

The Lord revealed to one of his prophets that at the coming forth 
of the Book of Mormon he would commence his work among the na- 
tions for the restoration of his people. When we realize with what 
speed the gospel of Jesus Christ may be disseminated now as compared 



ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH

with the year 1830, we can see that the Lord has set his hand and the 
opportunity to know is offered to men. It will not be long now, until 
in every part of this world the gospel may be heard through the servants 
of the Lord proclaiming it in power. Our heavenly Father will adjust 
conditions in the world so that the gospel may be preached. The great 
World War has readjusted the boundary lines and changed conditions 
in some nations, and the conflict that is now on in China, and the earth- 
quakes and other disturbances that are afflicting mankind, will be in 
preparation of the further promulgation of the word of the Lord. 

MISSION OF THE MEN WHO BEAR THE PRIESTHOOD 

Your mission is a very remarkable one, you men who bear the 
Priesthood. LTpon you has been conferred divine authority. You did 
not obtain your right to preach and teach the gospel and officiate in its 
ordinances as a result of training in a college or university. You re- 
ceived your authority from men divinely commissioned to act as ser- 
vants of the Lord, and it was conferred upon you by those who re- 
ceived it direct from Jesus Christ our Lord. 

JOSEPH SMITH'S MISSION 

Joseph Smith was only a boy when the hands of Peter, James and 
John were laid upon his head and he was ordained to the Melchizedek 
Priesthood, — he and Oliver Cowdery. A little later Joseph Smith was 
directed to organize a Church. He was only a young man, but he or- 
ganized it under the direction of the Redeemer of mankind. And it is 
patterned after the Church which was organized by the Savior when 
he was upon the earth. I have no doubt there were many who looked 
upon this young man as an upstart, and thought it was ridiculous that 
one who had not been educated to become a leader should presume to 
lead. But he was like the other servants of our heavenly Father who 
have lived upon the earth, who have been called by the Lord to perform 
a special labor, and the lack of knowledge pertaining to the things of 
this world did not preclude the possibility of the Lord's giving unto him 
information that made him equal and even superior in many respects 
to those who had possessed great earthly opportunities that were de- 
nied him. 

It has always been a source of satisfaction to me that this youth 
possessed such a character that his father and his mother, his brothers 
and sisters, yes, and his uncles and aunts, who were much older than 
he was, were impressed with his testimony and were glad, notwithstand- 
ing it was unpopular so to do, to ally themselves with him and his 
teachings. 

TESTIMONY OF PATRIARCH JOHN SMITH 

I have here a document that was printed in the Deseret News, in 
the year IS'51. It is a statement of an uncle of the Prophet Joseph 
Smith, and there are a few things in it that I think may be interesting 
to you. It indicates the faith of this good man, who, by the way, was 



84 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



the first stake president in the Salt Lake Valley. I refer to John Smith. 
He became Patriarch of the Church. He was an uncle of the Prophet 
Joseph Smith, and was born in 1781. This is his statement. I will 
read only a portion, because it is somewhat lengthy : 

"It is now upwards of twenty-one years since the organization of the Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, with six members, most of whom are 
numbered with the dead." 

Before proceeding 1 want to call your attention to the fact that 
this was written not long before the death of this good man. 

"Soon after its organization I heard the gospel through my nephew, Joseph 
Smith, Jr., and obeyed the commandments of the Lord by entering in at the 
door, which is baptism. 

"If the Presidency and Twelve who are now living had not been servants to 
the cause when Joseph lived, they would not have been worthy to fill the ex- 
alted stations which they now occupy ; and always remember 'That he who is 
the greatest among you must be the servant of all.' 

"Bring up your children in the way they should go, that they may be orna- 
ments to the society and a blessing unto you in your old age; and remember 
that God will not hold you guiltless if you should neglect to attend to this mat- 
ter. Remember also to teach them to pray; and cause your sons to take part in 
the family prayer; and beware what company they keep, for 'evil communi- 
cations corrupt good manners.' 

"Let not your daughters mix with the sons of the stranger whom you know 
nothing about, and who are not of the house of Israel; but gather your children 
together, and teach them the principles of truth and righteousness, and teach 
them to obey the laws of God, and the day will come that they will arise and 
bless you. 

"Teach unto them every truth which God has revealed. Instill into their 
young minds every principle that will make them a noble race, and remove from 
their paths everything that is contrary to God and his commandments. * * * 
You will then have a race of children who will rise in the midst of Israel, and 
will break the shackles of superstition, and be fit beings to carry on the work 
which their fathers commenced; and the Spirit of God will assist you in doing 
these things, provided you put forth all your energies with your might. * * * 

"Let every elder of Israel put on 'the garments of righteousness, teaching 
by precept and example the true principles which exalt the mind, expand the 
understanding, and make man a fit companion for his Creator. Never dishonor 
the high and holy calling which has been placed upon him by teaching and suf- 
fering to be taught in his home or anywhere that he has influence or power to 
control, doctrines that are not of God. * * * 

"I must conclude, for I feel the infirmities of age creeping on, and knowing 
not when the Lord shall require me hence, I wish to take this opportunity of 
adding my mite to the testimonies of the thousands who are scattered through- 
out the globe, and of those who are gdne beyond the veil, and who sealed theirs 
with their blood. * . 

r J' 1 ? Ki , rt !. an<J ; 0hio - four brothers sat in the patriarchal seat in the temple 
of God, and I only of that number am left to tell the tale ; and as I am now past 
the time allotted to man to live, it is reasonable that I also will be gathered unto 
my fathers in the time appoi-nted of God. 

"I therefore bear my testimony, which I wish translated into every language 
and read to every Saint, and printed wherever the type is used; that the world 
may see and hear what I have to say; for if I were young I would visit them, 
when they should hear from my hps that God has again spoken from the heavens • 
that he has again condescended to send his angels to visit fallen man, and point 
out the way whereby he can be saved. He appointed Joseph Smith a prophet 
and revealed unto him his commandments. 



ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH 



85 



"l testify that Joseph Smith was a Prophet, Seer, Revelator, and a man of 
God; and what was revealed through him will prove life and salvation to those 
who believe and obey, or death and condemnation to all who count it as naught, 
and harden their hearts against the truths he preached and practiced. I knew 
him — " 

I want to impress this paragraph upon your minds : 

"1 knew him when at his mother's breast, I watched and counselled his 
youth, but when God spoke and taught him, I bowed to his superior knowledge, 
and although he was a boy and I an old man, and his Uncle, yet I was not 
ashamed to learn true principles from him, and like Paul at the feet of Gamaliel, 
drank in the truths which flowed frcm the prophet's lips. 

'*[ was in jail with him and his brother Hyrum a few hours before they 
were killed, and I can testify before God, that they died innocent of any crime, 
and that they sealed their testimony with their blood. 

"I testify to all men, that I know that the angel has appeared which John 
the Revelator saw, who had the everlasting Gospel to preach to every nation, 
kindred, tongue and people, saying with a loud voice, Fear God and giye glory 
to him, for the hour of his judgment is come. 

''And I call on all men, priests and people, kings, potentates and rulers, to 
cease their strife, come and obey the gospel, gather with Israel, obey the com- 
mandments of God, that you a'nd your dead may be saved and brought up in the 
first resurrection. 

"1 say to the Saints that by the power of the holy priesthood vested in me, 
as Patriarch, I bless you, and I say unto you, Be faithful and you shall be blessed 
in your basket and your store ; you shall have all blessings which were promised 
to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob; and the Lord will preserve you as in the hollow 
of his halnd, and no power shall stay the work, for everything that shall be 
brought against it will fail. * * *" 

He concludes by signing himself "Jotm Smith, Patriarch of the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints." 

I read this, my brethren and sisters, for the purpose of calling at- 
tention to the fact that that was the class of people from whom the 
prophet of the Lord sprang. Men and women who had faith in God, 
who were readers of the scriptures, who believed in the power of God, 
and who, where it would be natural for them, because of their age, to 
direct the youth of their own household, were humble in their souls, and 
prepared to bow to the superior wisdom, not of the boy, but of our 
heavenly Father who inspired him. 

It is a beautiful testimony to me because in the evening of his life, 
when he was all ready to pass to the great beyond, he wanted to leave 
that testimony to the Latter-day Saints. There is much more in the 
document, but I do not feel like I ought to take the time to read it. 

TESTIMONY OF PRESIDENT GEORGE A. SMITH 

I have another short document which is from his son, and I shall 
read a short paragraph from it, which has a bearing also upon some- 
thing which you may be glad to know. This is from the historical dis- 
courses of President George A. Smith, a counselor to Brigham Young, 
reported by David W. Evans, in the year 1869 : 

"We look around today and behold our city clothed with verdure, beautiful 
with trees and flowers and with streams of water running in almost every direc- 
tion, and the question is frequently asked. 'How did you ever find this place?' 



86 



( / / l NERAL CONFEREN CE 



I answer, We were led to it by the inspiration of God. After the death of Joseph 
Smith, when it seemed that every trouble and calamity had come upon the Saints, 
Brigham Young, who was President of the Twelve, then the presiding quorum 
of the Church, sought the Lord to know what they should do and where they 
should lead the people for safety. While they were fasting and praying daily 
on this subject, President Young had a vision of Joseph Smith, who showed him 
the mountain we now call Ensign Peak, immediately north of Salt Lake City, 
and an ensign fell upon that peak, and Joseph said, 'Build under the point where 
the colors fall, and you will prosper and have peace.' The Pioneers had no pilot 
or guide, none of them had ever been in the country or knew anything abput it. 
However, they traveled under the direction of President Young until they reached 
this valley. When they entered it President Young pointed to that peak, and said, 
T want to go there.' He went up to the point and said, 'This is Ensign Peak. 
Now, brethren, organize your exploring parties, so as to be safe from Indians ; 
go and explore where you will, and you will come back every time and say, This 
is the best place.' They accordingly started out exploring parties, and visited 
what we now call Cache, Malad, Tooele and Utah valleys, and other parts of 
the country in various directions, but all came back and declared this was the 
best spot." 

THE FAITH OF ASAEL SMITH AND DESCENDANTS 

Asael Smith believed in this latter-day gospel. He was the father 
of John Smith, the first man to whom I referred, who was the father 
of George A. Smith, who was the father of John Henry Smith, who 
was my father, and I have a son in Germany preaching the gospel of 
Jesus Christ— the sixth generation in the Church in our line, doing his 
mite as each of these individuals has done in this one family. And 
then we have many other families of that early day represented in the 
mission field. Some of the men upon this stand are descendants of 
those who were in the Church in an early day. 

MEN OF STRONG CHARACTER HAVE PROCLAIMED THE GOSPEL 

There are throughout the organized stakes of Zion, men of strong 
character, men who think and reason for themselves, men who have 
tested the value of the gospel of Jesus Christ by observing its teach- 
ings, men who have not been afraid to go into the world and proclaim 
an unpopular doctrine, men who have been willing to offer t'heir lives 
in order that the gospel might be proclaimed. It is to humble men like 
these who do not exalt themselves in the eyes of their fellows, who 
believe in the divine mission of our Savior, who know as they know 
they live that our heavenly Father has revealed himself in this latter 
day, that our Lord has given a living testimony of the truth. This 
great Church has been presided over by men who have been specially 
prepared, specially taught, specially equipped for that high honor that 
has been conferred upon each as he has taken his place. Our heavenly 
Father in his wisdom has surrounded these leaders of Israel with oth- 
ers who like themselves have faith and who do not bow to the individ- 
ual, because of his personality or individuality as president of the 
Church, but who recognize him as the mouthpiece of our heavenly 
Father and sustain him and uphold him and pray for him, and love him, 
in order that they, too, may receive the blessings of our heavenly Father! 



ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH 



87 



There is no other organization like this in the world. There are 
no other people led as this people are led. It is truly said that those who 
preside are just men. It is through them that our heavenly Father will 
perform his work. It is through them that the gospel must be taught, 
and I call your attention to this fact : Not one of these men who have 
presided over the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints but has 
been willing" to give his life for it if need be. The first one did give his 
life, and the others have been just as willing, if .need be, in order that 
the work of our heavenly Father may be perpetuated, and that all men 
might be called to repentance. The man who presides over us today is 
not presiding because of his own native ability. He is not presiding 
because he is the son of some great potentate, but he is in the position 
he occupies because our Father in heaven knows the integrity of his 
soul. Realizing the determination he would have to carry this message 
to all the nations of the earth, he prepared him for the high calling that 
has been conferred upon him. Fie presides as the representative of 
i our heavenly Father. 

LET US TEACH OUR CHILDREN THE GOSPEL IN THE HOME 

Brethren and sisters, let us remember the teachings of the gospel 
of Jesus Christ. The good man to whom I have referred, and whose 
instructions I read, who was one of the early patriarchs of the Church, 
advised us to teach our children. If there is anything needed among 
the people today more than another, it seems to me it is that we shall 
honor Home Evening, as it was recommended to us by President Joseph 
F. Smith ; that we shall meet with our children around our own fire- 
places and teach them the gospel of Jesus Christ, the power of God 
unto salvation. And if we will do that, we have been promised that 
the Lord will add his blessing. 

TESTIMONY 

Fifty-seven years ago today I first saw the light, not very far 
from where I now stand. It has been fifty-seven years of experience, 
with some privations, some difficulties, some anxieties, and much hap- 
piness. In your presence I thank my heavenly Father for the oppor- 
tunity that has come to me. I am grateful to have the companionship 
of my brethren and sisters in this wonderful organization, and there 
has not been a day since I arrived at the age of accountability ; there 
has not been a moment of time since I had the power to reason and 
think and understand for myself that I have not known as I know that 
I live that this is my Father's work. God help us to be worthy of the 
splendid privileges that are ours. Help' us to be worthy of him who 
gave us {life and being and honored us with his holy Priesthood ; and 
in kindness and love let us reach after those who do not understand, 
drawing them by cords of kindness and love, that they, too, may par- 
take with us of this blessing which is the power of God unto salvation 
to all those who will believe and obey. 

That the Lord may give us this power, and that we may pass it on 



88 



G F.N URAL CONFERENCE 



to our children and our children's children to the latest generation, that 
in his own due time, when he shall gather his jewels, we, who have had 
this great opportunity, may find our names enrolled in the Lamb's book 
of life, is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS 

Notwithstanding I was born in the Church and have passed my 
sixty-sixth birthday, I feel but a mere child in this great latter-day work. 
In speaking to you, my brethren and sisters, this afternoon, I will call 
your attention to the word of the Lord to his servant, Moses, as re- 
corded in the Pearl of Great Price, Book of Moses, first chapter and 
thirty-ninth verse: . - 

THE WORK AND THE GLORY OF THE LORD 

"Behold, this is my work and my glory— to bring to pass the immortality and * 
eternal life of man." 

I conclude from these words that with the Lord the salvation of 
man was the end he had in view, and that all other works of his are but 
a means to that end. In these last days, after a period of spiritual dark- 
ness has been over the earth and the hearts and the minds of the chil- 
dren of men for centuries, our Father has restored anew the gospel, 
established his Church, and restored the holy Priesthood, having the 
same end in view. 

THE GOSPEL TO BE TAUGHT 

The gospel is the law of the Lord by which all men are to be judged 
and to be condemned or justified according to merits, therefore justice 
demands that the gospel be taught unto all men. The Lord has most 
graciously provided that this shall be done, that those who do not have 
the opportunity of hearing the gospel in the flesh shall have an oppor- 
tunity of hearing it in the hereafter, and that those who have not the 
opportunity of receiving the saving ordinances of the gospel in life may 
have the work done for them vicariously by their kindred who come 
after them. This principle of the living working for the dead, and of 
the dead looking to the living to do the necessary work for them, is what 
is called the turning of the hearts of the fathers to the children, and 
the hearts of the children to the fathers, and it has the same end in view, 
that of the salvation |of men. 

I think the President of this Church has the same motive concern- 
ing the Latter-day Saints and the children of men generally that our 
Father in heaven has, and that is to bring about, by the means at his 

command, — the organizations, institutions and workers in this Church, 

the salvation of the children of men. It would please the President of 
this Church more than anything else if we who are members of the 
Church would be true and faithful to our covenants and keep the com- 
mandments of the Lord. 



ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS 



89 



FAITH THE MOVING CAUSE 

If we had sufficient faith, my brethren and sisters, I feel sure that 
there would be no doubt in regard to our salvation. Faith is the mov- 
ing cause of all action. It is the foundation of all righteousness, and 
righteousness is the thing that is going to save men and women in the 
kingdom of God. One of the purposes of our meeting together in these 
conferences is that the faith of the Latter-day Saints may be more firmly 
established', that under the influence of the Spirit of the Lord, which is 
always present in these conference meetings, and the instructions that 
are given, we may be reminded of our first love, of this the gospel of 
our Redeemer ; that we may be reminded of the manner of men and 
women we should be. The very elect of mankind have been chosen 
out of the world, and very few indeed, in the language of the scripture 
— one of a city and two of a family — to carry on the work of our Father, 

looking to the saving of his children. 

/ 

TESTIMONIES HAVE STRENGTHENED FAITH 

Those who were present yesterday morning at the opening meet- 
ing of this conference and heard the remarks of President Heber J. 
Grant' must have been deeply impressed, as I was, with the strength of 
character and of testimony of this our beloved President. Many evi- 
dences were brought forth proving the truth of this work, and that 
Joseph Smith was indeed a prophet of God; and a powerful testimony 
was borne that God lives, and that Jesus is the Christ, the Savior and 
Redeemer of mankind. The testimonies of others of the brethren have 
been in accord, all calculated to strengthen the faith of the Latter-day 
Saints and to convince those who are not members of the Church. We, 
each and all of us, ought to feel as our Father in heaven feels in re- 
gard to man's salvation, and that so far as we have the power we should 
endeavor to lead men and women with whom we may be associated to 
an investigation of the truth, and possibly through the blessing of the 
Lord to membership in his Church, and finally to salvation. 

FURTHER CONCERNING TESTIMONY. 

I realize that some are less credulous than others. The evidences 
presented which have convinced us beyond question or doubt seem to 
be insufficient for the converting of many of our Father's children. 
For this, of course, we are sorry. 

Nature's testimony of God is incontrovertible. Men may question 
the authenticity and the truth of the scriptures, perhaps, but the evidence 
of nature is incontrovertible. The Apostle Paul in reasoning with the 
Romans used this expression : 

"For the invisible things of God from the creation of the world are clearly 
seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and 
Godhead ; so that they are left without excuse." 

Men are known by their works. A prophet is known by his works. 
The tree that bringeth forth fruit is judged by the fruit. The things 



90 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

which God uur Father has created, all that we see in nature, are his 
handiwork and testify of his existence, of his power, and of his love. 
Hence we sing that beautiful hymn: , 

"Earth, with her ten thousand flowers, 
Air, with all its beams and showers, 
Heaven's infinite expanse, 
Sea's resplendent countenance — 
All around, and all above 
Bear this record, God is Love." 

There are other evidences. The Savior said to one of his apostles, 
St. John, 20th chapter: 

"Thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed; blessed are they 
that have not seen, and yet have believed." 

The Lord expects men and women to receive the testimony of those 
who have seen : 

"And many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his disciples, which 
are not written in this book ; 

"But these are written that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the 
Son of God; and that believing ye might have life through his name." 

The scriptures tell us that no prophecy of the scripture is of any 
private interpretation, "for prophecy came not in olden times by the will 
of men, but holy men of God spake as they were moved upon by the 
Holy Ghost." The scriptures, then, are the product of the Holy Ghost, 
and they are written that they might testify of him. And they have so 
thoroughly testified of him that men believing on him, by reason of the 
testimony of these scriptures, have reasoned out also a philosophy, that 
God, who is the Father of Jesus Christ, is a personal, immortal and 
glorified being. 

Let me read to you of Henry Ward Beecher's conclusions, drawn 
from the scriptures. He says : 

"I am compelled to say that 1 must form an ideal of God through his Son 
Jesus Christ. Christ is indispensable to me. My nature needs to fashion the 
thought of God, though I know him to be a spirit, into something that shall 
nearly or remotely represent that which 1 know. 1 hold before my eyes there- 
fore a glorified form. But after all the glory, whatever may be the nimbus and 
the effulgence round about it, it is to me a glorified form of a glorified man, 
and I therefore fashion to myself out of the spirit, that which has to me as it 
were a divine presence and a divine being ; namely, a divine man." ■ 

Why cannot other intelligent men and women reach the same con- 
clusion from these same scriptures? It seems to require more evidence 
to convince some than others. To me these are convincing evidences, 
and the fact that we teach truly scriptural doctrine is one of the strong 
evidences of the truth of this work in which we are engaged. 

THE LORD HAS RAISED UP WITNESSES TO TESTIFY 

Now again the Lord has raised up witnesses who are to testify, 
and the people who hear them are supposed to believe, and if they do 
not believe they will be left without excuse. 



ELDER GEORGE E. RICHARDS 



91 



I will read from the first chapter and eighth verse of the Acts of 
the Apostles : 

"But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you; 
and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea, and it* 
Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth." 

That is the kind of witnesses the apostles of the Lord were to be 
in his day, and in this day he has also special witnesses, and the people 
are expected to hear their testimony. 

You remember the parable given by the Savior, of the rich man 
and the poor man, how that the rich man found himself in torment after 
life, because of his neglect to do the things he knew he should have done, 
and when he appealed to Father Abraham to send someone from the 
dead down to earth to visit his five brothers and warn them that they 
might not come to that place and condition of torment, the answer was, 
"They have Moses and the prophets. Let them hear them. And if 
they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither would they be persuaded 
though one were sent from the dead." * 

THEIR TESTIMONIES WILL STAND AGAINST THE WORLD 

These testimonies borne by the servants of God in this day will 
stand against the world. Men of the world need a tutor, a Phillip, to 
explain the scriptures to them so that they may understand them. 

MONUMENT TO THE THREE WITNESSES AND THEIR TESTIMONY 

Last Saturday we unveiled a beautiful monument here to the mem- 
ory of Oliver Cowdery, David Whitmer and Martin Harris, the Three 
Witnesses to the Book of Mormon, who testified that an angel of God 
came down from heaven and brought and laid before their eyes, that 
they beheld and saw, the plates from which the Book of Mormon was 
translated by the gift and power of God through Joseph Smith; that 
they heard a voice from heaven saying that the plates had been trans- 
lated by the gift and power of God, and that voice commanded them to 
bear record to the world, and they gave their record and testimony to 
the world. 

Another testimony, that of eight reputable men, who declared that 
Joseph Smith, having the plates from which the Book of Mormon was 
translated in his possession, showed the plates to them and that as many 
of the leaves as he had translated they did handle with their hands and 
they saw the engravings which were upon the plates, and declared that 
they had the appearance of ancient work and of curious workmanship. 

BOOK. OF MORMON TESTIFIES OF THE WITNESSES 

I shall read to you what is found in the Book of Mormon telling of 
these witnesses who should be raised up, long centuries yet to come, after 
this prediction. It is found in the Book of Ether 5 :3, 4: 

"And unto three shall they be shown by the power of God; wherefore they 
shall know of a surety that these things are true. 

"And in the mouth of three witnesses shall these things be established ; and 



<>2 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



the testimony of three, and this work, in the which shall be shown forth the 
power of God and also his word, cf which the Father, and the Son, and the 
Holy Ghost bear record — and all this shall stand as a testimony against the 
world at the last day." 

Why? Because men and women learning of these things are sup- 
posed to accept the testimony of these witnesses. 

The testimony of all these witnesses is a direct testimony of the 
truth of the Book of Mormon. We declare that it contains the fulness 
of the everlasting gospel as restored through an angel, as the plates 
from which this book was translated were given to Joseph by an angel. 
And thus the vision of John the Revelator on Patmos was fulfilled, 
when he saw that an angel should fly in the midst of heaven having the 
everlasting gospel to preach to them that dwell upon the earth, etc. 

THE TESTIMONY OF THE PROPHET JOSEPH SMITH 

Those witnesses and their testimony, to me (perhaps I am more 
credulous than some), is an equally strong testimony that Joseph Smith, 
who translated from those plates the Book of Mormon, is a true prophet 
of God ; and, being a true prophet of God, his story of his first expe- 
rience when he went into the woods to pray, and in answer to his prayer 
the Father and the Son appeared to him, must have been true. For, 
had it been false, he would have been a great imposter, and God never 
would have used an imposter in bringing to light this truth, the Book 
of Mormon, the fulness of the everlasting gospel. So that these testi- 
monies are to me just as strong evidence that Joseph Smith's story of 
the visitation of the Father and the Son is true, and that means that 
God the eternal Father is a personage having a body of flesh and bones 
and spirit, a glorified immortal being, and his Son Jesus Christ is like 
the Father. To me it is, also satisfactory evidence that what the Lord 
told Joseph Smith, as Joseph explains it to us, is true in regard to a 
universal apostasy, and the intention of the Lord to restore his gospel 
and his Church in the near future. The visitation of the angel Moroni 
to Joseph is an established fact by these witnesses, by their testimony, 
also the visitation of John the Baptist and the conferring of the Aaronic 
Priesthood upon Joseph and Oliver, and iater the visitation of Peter, 
James and John, who held the Melchizedek Priesthood, who conferred 
upon Joseph and Oliver the keys of that Priesthood. 

Now just a word or two from the Doctrine and Covenants in con- 
clusion. We read in the 20th section : 

"Therefore, having so great witnesses, by them shall the world be judged, 
even as many as shall hereafter come to a knowledge of this work. 

"And those who receive it in faith, and work righteousness, shall receive a 
crown of eternal life; 

"But those who harden their hearts in unbelief, and reject it, it shall turn 
to their own condemnation." 

May the Lord add his blessings, I pray, in the name of Jesus 
Chrfst. Amen.

ELDER SAMUEL O. BENNION 

President of the Central States Mission 

I am very happy, my brethren and sisters, to be in attendance at 
this conference, and I hope and pray that I may be led to say that which 
the Lord would have me say. 

I do not know just what effect the testimonies of men, who 
have been members of the Church for many years, have upon those 
who do not know the truth, or just how far they may be led through 
such testimonies to investigate the gospel. But there is one thing by 
which they must* be impressed, and that is that an organization that has 
held its own without a change for nearly a century is almost without a 
parallel in the world. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints 
has not changed in its doctrine. It is almost one hundred years since 
the Church was organized, and the doctrines that were taught by those 
early elders are still taught by the men and women of the present time. 

Those early leaders taught that man had an ante-mortal state, and 
we have held to that doctrine for a century. In my experience I have 
not found any man able to prove that doctrine to be untrue ; on the 
contrary, I have read the testimonies of hundreds of men and listened 
to thousands of them bear testimony that it is true, and give good scrip- 
tural evidence for it. The elders of the Church testified in the begin- 
ning concerning the Father and the Son appearing to the Prophet 
Joseph Smith, and declared unto the children of men that he is a per- 
sonal being. The Church has taught this doctrine since that time, for 
nearly one hundred years, and in my experience I have never found nor 
read of anyone who has been able successfully to prove that it is not 
true, or that it was not a doctrine from the beginning of time. 

These principles of the gospel must surely find lodgment in the 
hearts of the honest wherever they are found and where men are able 
to study them. I glory in the fact that the Church has never wavered in 
the least in all its history in doctrine or in organization ; that it has con- 
stantly grown until it has become the greatest organization in all the 
world, in its order and system, in the excellence of its social scheme, 
in the perfection of its doctrines, and in its spiritual power. The^ 
things must certainly attract the attention of men. They are a warn- 
ing to the children of men that the Lord has spoken, and the lives of 
men who testify of these things and live in accordance with these prin- 
ciples must be taken into consideration by those who oppose them and 
say they are not true. The Lord will undoubtedly call such to an ac- 
counting sooner or later. 

I have heard men and women by the hundreds testify that they 
know the gospel is true ; that its principles have been revealed from 
the Lord ; that they know they lived before they came into this world ; 
that they know that God our eternal Father has a body of flesh and 
bones ; that they do know that the power of the Priesthood is among 
the children of men and that the Lord has revealed, and does reveal 
and will constantly reveal his mind unto his servants here in mortality.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



They have testified unto me that they know they have heen born again; 
that the doctrines which they had heen taught previously were false; 
namely, that the Father through his Son had done all that there was to 
do, and left nothing for them to do but to acknowledge Christ and be 
saved. They have testified that they have found that there was some- 
thing for them to do; that they must needs be baptized and receive the 
laying on of hands through the authority of the Priesthood on the earth. 
As a result they were baptized by fire and born again into a newness 
of life; they were thereby able to comprehend that the Father and his 
Son were personal beings; they were able to comprehend that they 
lived before they came into the world ; they were able to understand the 
need of baptism for the dead, as well as for the living; they were able 
to see the eternity of the marriage covenant ; they were able to see the 
great plan of our Father and to realize that this life is just a part of 
the existence of a human being. This knowledge made them in reality 
new individuals, they were thenceforth different in their lives. 

Not long ago I had a conversation with a sister eighty-two years 
of age who had just been baptized into the Church. She told me that 
she had been so bitter all her life that she would not even talk about 
the gospel of Jesus Christ according to the "Mormon" idea of it, and 
while visiting with a friend who belonged to this Church she had made 
the request that religion be not discussed at all. The good sister, who 
was a very dear friend of hers, said, "All right, we will not discuss re- 
ligion." But she left the Book of Mormon open where this other sister 
could find it. She also left some tracts which she had purchased where 
they might be read by her friend if she so desired. The sister told 
me that she was so prejudiced when she saw that book open that she 
turned around and backed up to it and closed it for fear she might 
see something she would believe. However, at length, she read a 
pamphlet, and then another. She finally read the Book of Mormon, 
and was baptized. She told me that she had reared a good family, which 
she had loved as only a mother can love. She said she thought she had 
been as happy as a person could be when she was rearing her little 
children,) and when they grew to manhood and womanhood she had the 
privilege of living with them. She was still near them but now they 
were so enraged at her joining the Church that they would hardly let 
her visit them. Notwithstanding this she had never been so happy in 
all her life as she has been since she joined the Church. She had found- 
nothing else to compare with the happiness she has found through the 
revelations of the Lord to Joseph 'Smith the Prophet in this day. In 
the hours of the night when she awakens she finds herself never alone; 
she has much to think about, much to read, and much to do. She said 
to me, "I have been born again. I know that I lived before I came into 
this world, and I know that my Father has a body of flesh and bones, 
and I know that the Lord has spoken in these the last days and has 
revealed unto Joseph Smith the truth. I am born again." And she 
said also, 'T could no more go back to my old way of thinking and my 
old way of worshiping the Lord than I could go back to yesterday." 

Truly these testimonies written and spoken, distributed in all parts 



ELDER SAMUEL 0. BEN N ION

of the earth where Christians reside, must awaken in the hearts of the 
honest of the earth a desire to love the Lord. 

My testimony unto you, my brethren and sisters, is that I know 
there has been no change in the doctrines of the Church. I have read 
the writings of the early elders of this Church in the days of the Prophet 
Joseph and those who were with him — Brigham Young, Heber C. Kim- 
ball, Willard Richards, Wilford Woodruff, and all those mighty men. 
I have read many of their sermons recorded in the Journal of Dis- 
courses, and in the other histories that were kept and are now in exist- 
ence. I have made it a matter of investigation for many years, and I 
have never found any change. The same spirit which prompted those 
men prompts the men and women of today, and it is the greatest testi- 
mony to the children of men, or ought to be, that there is one guiding 
hand which directs and governs the destinies of this Church. 

I know my brethren and sisters, that God lives and that Joseph 
Smith was his prophet and is his prophet, and that the power of his 
priesthood and his prophetic appointment was delivered to Brigham 
Young, who followed him, and that it is here in the earth today, with 
President Heber J. Grant. I know there is no other organization under 
the shining sun that holds the Priesthood and the power of God to 
administer in the ordinances of the gospel on this earth. I know that 
the history of this Church must be recognized and reckoned with. 1 
know men who say there is no such thing as revelation in our day, yet 
the Book of Mormon has never been proved to be untrue by any man 
who has written or spoken about it. I know, my brethren and sisters, 
that the judgments of God are just, and that his rewards are certain 
and sure. I take great pleasure in bearing this testimony unto you. 

I take great pleasure and happiness in my work in the mission field, 
where I have been for a long time, and where I have traveled among 
the children of men in the six states of the Central States mission — 
fifteen millions of people. There is a great body of men and women 
there who bear testimony constantly that this is the work of God. The 
work of God our eternal Father is greater today than it has ever been 
before and more surely established in the hearts of the children of men, 
for witnesses such as this fine old sister I have referred to are found 
in almost all of the counties of the states where I preside. And what is 
true of that woman is true of others, whom the Lord God our eternal 
Father has raised up as witnesses in all parts of the world ; their testi- 
monies are the same. 

My brethren and sisters, we ought to be happy in a knowledge that 
this is the work of God, and that he has reserved us to come forth in 
this day and generation of time when the fulness of his gospel is in 
the earth. I pray that we may be able to keep the commandments of 
God and walk in his paths and sustain him through his priesthood, and 
I do it in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The choir and congregation sang, "High on the mbuntain top." 
The closing prayer was offered by Elder Mark Austin. 
The conference adjourned until 2 o'clock p. m.

GENERAL CONFEREN( 'E 



AFTERNOON MEETING 

The meeting fcegan at 2 o'clock in the Tabernacle. 
President Heber J. Grant presided. 

The choir and congregation sang, "We thank thee, O God, for a 
prophet." 

Prayer was offered by Elder Lewis R. Anderson, president of the 
Manti temple. 

A baritone solo was sung by Wm, H. Russell. "Open the gates of 
the temple." 

ELDER ORSON F. WHITNEY 

In the few minutes that are mine to occupy, I would like to say 
something for the especial benefit of the stranger within our gates — 
something that may help him or her to a better understanding than 
possibly they now possess of what the world terms "Mormonism." It 
may also serve as a reminder to the Latter-day Saints, especially to the 
younger or less experienced members of the Church. 

A COMMON ERROR 

The commonest error in relation to "Mormonism" is the notion 
that it is a new religion, and that it originated with Joseph Smith in the 
Nineteenth Century. Those who hold this view, and allow it to limit 
their vision of the subject, will never understand "Mormonism" aright. 

For this reason : They are considering only a part of it — a very 
important part, it is true, but still only a part ; and their comprehension 
o^f that is necessarily imperfect, since some knowledge of the subject 
in its entirety is essential to a thorough understanding of any part 
thereof. 

THE TRUE TITLE 

The only new thing about "Mormonism" is the nickname that it 
now bears. Its true title is "The Everlasting Gospel" (Rev. 14:6), the 
gospel of Jesus Christ. It did not originate with Joseph Smith, nor 
with any other man. It is not a product of human wisdom. It is of 
divine origin. It was instituted in the heavens before the earth was 
formed, as the means of uplift and promotion for "the lesser intelli- 
gences," in the midst of whom the Great Creator found himself at the 
beginning, and who became his sons and daughters, first in the spirit 
and afterwards in the flesh. 

THE GOSPEL'S ANTIQUITY 

It is the gospel of Christ, but it did not make its first appearance 
upon this planet at the time of Christ's crucifixion. While it seemed 
new to that generation, who were "astonished at his doctrine," in real- 
ity it was older than all the ages, older than Earth itself, and had been 
' given to man again and again before any preaching of it by the ancient 



ELDER ORSON F. WHITNE\ 



97 



Apostles. It was a restored gospel then, as it is a restored gospel now, 
and had been revealed from God out of Eternity at the very beginning 
of Time. 

THE MACHINERY AND THE POWER 

The gospel is more than a code of laws and ordinances, an em- 
bodiment of eternal principles, obedience to which must precede en- 
trance into the Church and Kingdom of God. The machinery is one 
thing; the power that moves the machinery is another. God is the 
author and giver of both. Divine authority, the authority of the Priest- 
hood, comes with the gospel, to make operative for man its laws and 
ordinances and the eternal principles of which it is composed. The gifts 
of the Holy Spirit are also necessary — imperatively so, in order to ren- 
der effective the great plan of salvation, exaltation and eternal glory. 
Faith, repentance, baptism, and the gift of the Holy Ghost are indis- 
pensable parts of the celestial machinery ; but of what avail, if the 
power were not turned on? 

The fall of man and man's redemption from the fall, are basic 
principles of the divine plan — the very foundations upon which it rests. 
If Adam had not fallen, had not become mortal and subject unto death, 
he and his descendants would not have been in a position to avail them- 
selves of the gospel's uplifting powers. In other words, the spirit would 
have had no body, and consequently would have been incapable of ex- 
altation. And if Christ had not died to redeem mankind, the machinery 
for human uplift would have stood still and death would have been per- 
petvfal. All that went before would have been in vain. Adam fell to 
give us mortal life. Christ died to give us life eternal. 

THE DISPENSATIONS 

There is only one gospel, but there are many gospel dispensations — 
as those periods are termed when God has spoken to man and revealed 
these saving principles, these exalting powers. ''Mormonism," as com- 
monly understood, stands for the restoration of the gospel in this Lat- 
ter-day Dispensation. But that is not all. It stands for the gospel itself 
in all the dispensations, ancient and modern. 

How many dispensations there are, I know not. But this I know : 
Whatever their number or the names by which they may bje properly 
known, they are all inter-related, are links of one great chain, parts of 
one vast whole; and each, from the beginning, has prepared the way 
for its successor, the dispensation that was to follow. Before I finish, 
1 hope to point out snme of those relationships. 

The relative importance of these dispensations is not to be gauged 
by the brief accounts given of them in the Bible. That sacred record 
was intended to emphasize the history and mission of the House of 
Israel, through which was to come the Savior of Jhe World. Other 
things of vital importance are only glanced at. The Bible merely hints 
at the existence of the Land of Zion, the visit of the Savior to the Ne- 
phrites, and the great events that were to take place upon this chosen 
ground.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



JOSEPH THE PROPHET 

Speaking of Joseph Smith. There are those who think that we 
worship him. We do not. We love him and revere his memory. He 
was God's prophet — that is our testimony concerning him ; and he stands 
at the head of this last and greatest of the gospel dispensations — that is 
his proper place. He never claimed anything beyond it. Why should 
we claim it for him? 

It is sometimes charged that we give him a standing next to Jesus 
Christ. I know of no warrant for such an assertion, nor for such a 
belief ; and I am fairly well acquainted with the Church's history, doc- 
trines, and divine revelations. Joseph, himself, testifies that Adam 
stands next to Christ, and Noah next to Adam, in the Priesthood. 

adam's presidency 

Joseph Smith also declares that Adam presides over all the gospel 
dispensations, including this, the Dispensation of the Fulness of Times. 
Each has its own immediate presiding authority ; but the great head of 
the human family, the prince and patriarch of our race, presides over 
them all. 

Is an illustration desired ? We have one right at hand. President 
Heber J. Grant, the now visible head of the Church, by virtue of his 
general presidency presides over all the stakes of Zion, over all our out- 
side missions, over every organization and institution in the Church ; 
and yet each one of these has, under him and those associated with' him, 
its local head, its immediate presiding authority. In like manner Father 
Adam presides over all the gospel dispensations. 

THE PRIESTHOOD 

Joseph Smith, in a great discourse on Priesthood, says : 

"The Priesthood was first given to Adam ; he obtained the First Presidency, 
and held the keys of it from generation to generation. * * * The Priest- 
hood is an everlasting principle. * * * The keys have to be brought from 
heaven whenever the Gospel is sent. When they are revealed from heaven, it 
is by Adam's authority." {History of the Church, vol. 3, pp. 385-386.) 

Adam was the first on earth to receive the gospel and to exercise 
the powers of the Priesthood. By means of it he was redeemed from 
endless death; and he taught his children these truths and transmitted 
them to posterity. 

It was decreed by the Almighty, in Adam's day, that the gospel 
"should be in the world until the end thereof." How can this be har- 
monized with the idea and the need of gospel restorations? In this 
way : The gospel, because of the world's unworthiness, has been with- 
drawn at times, leaving but a partial illumination to guide mankind. 
But those withdrawals have been only temporary. Whenever condi- 
tions have become favorable, and the Lord's purposes have demanded 
it, the fulness of the Truth has been restored — brought back again ; — 



ELDER ORSON F. WHITNEY 



99 



and by these repeated restorations, forming a continuous chain of dis- 
pensations, the Almighty has made good his decree, that the gospel 
''should be in the world until the end thereof." 

ANCIENT OF DAYS 

Says Joseph Smith: "I saw Adam in the Valley of Adam-ondi- 
Ahman. He called together his children and blessed them with a patri- 
archal blessing." This vision was, of course, retrospective, having ref- 
erence to the time when Adam dwelt upon the earth. In another place 
the Prophet refers to the same incident in these words : 

"Three years previous to the death of Adam, he called Seth, Enos, Cainan, 
Mahalaleel, Jared, Enoch and Methusaleh, who were all high priests, with the 
residue of his posterity who were righteous, into the valley of Adam-ondi-Ahman, 
and there bestowed upon them his last blessing. * * * And Adam stood up 
in the midst of the congregation, and notwithstanding he was bowed down with 
age, being full of the Holy Ghost, predicted what should befall his posterity to 
the latest generation." (History of the Church, Vol. 3, p. 388; Doctrine land 
Covenants 107:53-56.) 

This alone indicates a relationship between Adam's dispensation 
and ours. But there is more to the same effect. The world has not seen 
the last of Father Adam. He is coming again — coming as the Ancient 
of Days, to fulfill the prophecy of Daniel concerning him. And he will 
come to the very place where, bowed with the weight of his nine cen- 
turies (men kept the Word of Wisdom in those days), he blessed his 
posterity before the close of his earthly career. In the Valley of Adam- 
ondi-Ahman, now in Western Missouri, almost within hailing distance 
of the ancient site of the Garden of Eden, where the New Jerusalem is 
to rise, will sit the Ancient of Days, counseling his worthy children and 
preparing them for the second coming of the Son of God. 

A CLOSE RELATIONSHIP 

Adam's mighty blessing upon his posterity, forecasting the history 
of the human race — the mightiest patriarchal blessing ever given — taken 
in connection with his prospective return into the midst of his right- 
eous descendants, upon the precise spot where he bestowed his farewell 
benediction and uttered his wonderful, all-telling prophecy, shows a very 
close relationship between the first and the final dispensations of the 
gospel. 

ENOCH AND ZION 

And what of other gospel dispensations? What of Enoch, the 
seventh from Adam in the patriarchal succession? What of him and 
his period? Was it not prophetic of our day — symbolical of the build- 
ing up of Zion in this dispensation? What is said of Enoch and his 
city, sanctified by the Law of Consecration, without which there can be 
no Zion, and consequently no coming of the Christ? Moses says : "And 
the Lord called his people Zion, because they were of one heart and one 
mind, and dwelt in righteousness, and there was no poor among them." 



100 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Such a condition will be again, and the Lord will come again, as he has 
promised : 

"As I live, even so will I come in the last days, in the days of wickedness 
and vengeance. * * * And righteousness will I send down out of heaven, 
and truth will I send forth out of the earth, to bear testimony of mine Only 
Begotten; and righteousness and truth will I cause to sweep the earth as with 
a flood, to gather out mine elect from the four quarters of the earth, unto a 
place which I shall prepare, an Holy City, that my people may gird up their 
loins, and be looking forth for the time of my coming; for there shall be my 
tabernacle, and it shall be called Zion, a New Jerusalem. 

"'And the Lord said unto Enoch : Then shalt thou and all thy city meet 
them there, and we will receive them into our bosom, and they shall see us ; and 
we will fall upon their necks, and they shall fall upon our necks, and we will 
kiss each other. And there shall be mine abode, and it shall be Zion, which shall 
come forth out of all the creations which I have made; and for the space of a 
thousand years the earth shall rest." (Pearl of Great Price, Moses 7:60-64.) 

In other words, the Zion of Enoch foreshadowed the Zion of the 
Last Days, with which it is destined to blend. And not only Enoch, 
but all the patriarchs, prophets, and apostles who have lived on Earth 
since Time began, will come with Christ "when the Lord brings again 
Zion." 

AS IT WAS SO IT SHALL BE 

Noah, whose other name is Gabriel, the Angel of the Resurrection 
— how could we do without him ? He holds the keys to bring us forth 
from the grave. He is one of our ancestors. His three sons repeopled 
the earth after the Flood; Shem peopling Asia; Ham, Africa; and 
Japheth, Europe. We are from Shem, through Abraham and the House 
of Israel, though mixed with the children of Japheth, the Gentiles. 

In Noah's day "a veil of darkness" covered the. earth ; and accord- 
ing to revelation a like condition is to characterize the Last Day, thus 
foretokened. The spiritual part of that prophecy is even now fulfilling. 
What could be darker in a spiritual way than "the gross darkness" that 
covers the modern world in relation to the things of God? Flounder- 
ing — floundering — like blind men among breakers, not knowing how to 
swim, nor in which direction lies the shore ! Such is the plight of even 
the wisest among them. 

Of Noah's day, it is written: "As the days of Noe were, so shal 
also the coming of the son of man be." And it was the Son of Man 
though I prefer to call him the Son of God — who said it. Baptized with 
water in the days of Noah, the earth will yet be baptized with fire and 
with the Holy Ghost. 

ABRAHAM AND THE COVENANT 

Our relationship with Abraham, I have already touched upon. W 
are among his descendants, and are actually taking part in the fulfil 
ment of the promise made to him by Jehovah, that in his seed should 
all the nations of the earth be blessed. Are we not blessing the nations 
by carrying to them the gospel, and by administering its sacred or- 



ELDER ORSON F. WHITNEY 



101 



ciinances for the living and the dead? The great fulfilment of that 
covenant is in Jehovah himself, who came through the lineage of Abra- 
ham, to be the Savior of the world. But a part fulfilment is in the 
world-dispersion of the children of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, the 
blood of Israel, the blood that believes, supplemented by the present-day 
gathering of Israel, whose right it is to prepare the way before the God 
of Israel who is coming to reign. 

MISSION OF THE CHRIST 

Christ redeemed all mankind, "treading the wine press alone;" but 
the House of Israel prepared the way for his coming, and continued 
the work that he began. This is especially true of the prophets who 
foretold his advent, and the apostles who preached his gospel to Jew 
and gentile. Nor let the modern apostles, seventies and elders be 
overlooked, who are now preaching the gospel to the Gentiles, and ere 
long will carry it to the Jews. 

Nobody, I hope, connects the Savior's mighty mission only with 
the age in which he was crucified. That was- but a part of it. The 
death, on Calvary was no more the ending of that divine career, than 
the birth at Bethlehem was its beginning. The Savior's mission is uni- 
versal, extending from eternity into time and back again into eternity. 
All the ages of the past, all the gospel dispensations, from Adam to 
Joseph Smith, are parts of the all-embracing mission of the world's 
Redeemer. It is all Christ's work, from the hour of his election in the 
Eternal Councils, down to the Millennial Reign, during which he will 
sanctify the earth and prepare it for celestial glory. 

The Mosaic-Judaic Dispensation was but preparatory to the 
Christian Dispensation ; and the Christian Dispensation was a forerun- 
ner to the Dispensation of the Fulness of Times. They are linked to- 
gether, and are no more to be considered independently and apart, than 
are the histories of the United States, Great Britain, the Roman Empire, 
and the parent nations that preceded them. They are all parts of one 
stupendous whole. 

The first and second comings of the Savior complement each other. 
As Lamb then ; as Lion now ; not again to be sacrificed, but to ascend 
the Throne of David and reign over the House of Israel forever. It 
was to prepare the way before the glorious advent of the King of kings, 
that God's prophet, revelator and seer, Joseph Smith, was raised up, or 
rather sent down, to play his noble part in the winding up scene of the 
great Drama of the Ages. 

And this is "Mormonism," the everlasting gospel, the bond that 
unites the present and the past, the children and the fathers ; that binds 
together all the gospel dispensations, all things that are Christ's both 
in heaven and on earth. It is not an earthly growth. It is not of human 
planting. Its roots are grounded in eternity, and its branches have borne 
fruit through all the centuries of time. 

Well might Brother Nibley say, as he said yesterday, "What has 
the world to offer in the place of it ?"

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



ELDER DAVID O. McKAY 

An editorial in a local paper, last Sunday morning, referring to 
this great assembling of Latter-day Saints, contained the following com- 
ment : 

A PEOPLE OF STRONG CONVICTIONS 

"Those who attend this conference will see a host of sincere believers — in- 
deed, they more than believe, they 'know' as many of them will assert. Naturally 
it took a people of strong convictions to stick it out in this valley when the pio- 
neers came here in 1847. Quite as naturally a strong community would grow 
out of this beginning." 

It is true, the Latter-day Saints are a people of strong convictions ; 
and convictions — convictions of the truth — are the strongest, most po- 
tent factors in the world. It has been truly said that no historic event 
is so important as the advent of a conviction of a new truth. "The 
power of such conviction in the human soul is to build up institutions, 
to change the course of events, and to alter the tendencies of human 
affairs; and among all convictions there are none so strong, permanent, 
and unconquerable as religious convictions." "Ideas," says Paxton, "go 
booming through the world louder than cannon. Thoughts are mightier 
than armies." 

TWO POTENT CONVICTIONS 

If I were to couch in definite terms two of the most potent con- 
victions in the hearts of the Latter-day Saints, I would name: First, 
an abiding assurance that the gospel, as taught by tlic Redeemer zvhen \ 
he lived among men and which was later modified, changed and cor- 
rupted by men, has been restored by the Redeemer in its purity and ful- 
ness; and second, following naturally the first, a conviction in the 
heart of every member of this Church that the responsibility rests upon 
the membership of the Church to preach the restored gospel to every 
nation, kindred, tongue and people. It is this second conviction of 
which I wish to speak this afternoon. 

A DESIRE TO MAKE ALL PEOPLE CHRISTIANS 

Springing out of this sense of responsibility to bear witness to all 
people, is the desire to Christianize the world. Some Protestant min- 
isters do not like to .consider "Mormons" Christians. Be that as it may, 
the fact remains that the paramount desire in every Latter-day Saint's 
heart is to make all people Christians, and that is a conviction second 
only in power and urgency to the testimony that God has spoken in this 
dispensation. "Go ye and teach all nations," said the Savior to his dis- 
ciples. "This promise is unto you and to your children and to all that 
are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call," said Peter 
on the day of Pentecost. "Proclaim these things to the world," said 
the Prophet Joseph, through inspiration in this age. "that faith might 
be increased in the world, that mine everlasting covenant might be 
established."

WHAT THE LATTER-DAY SAINTS ARE DOING TO PREACH THE GOSPEL 

I know of no other religious conviction that has affected the daily 
life of a people more potently than this desire to have every nation hear 
the message of this latter-day gospel of peace. Very few indeed are 
the homes in the Church that have not been influenced by it. At the 
present time the people are supporting over 2,000 of their sons and 
daughters in various parts of the world at a monetary sacrifice of ap- 
proximately $1,800,000 a year. To know just how keenly this responsi- 
bility is felt and how willingly discharged, I will ask you to recall in- 
dividual cases : A young man was called from this city to go on a 
mission to the Pacific Islands. He responded and gave his message to 
the world as best he could. A few weeks ago he came into my office 
and said : "I have been home a year, and I have succeeded during that 
year in paying all but $100 of the $600 debt I had when I returned. In 
another two months I will have it all paid, and my tithing in full be- 
sides." "Well, was it worth it?" said I. "Twice as much," he promptly 
replied. "I would not have missed that experience for anything." I 
met a young man when I was coming home from the Eastern States 
mission who had spent all his earnings in that mission, and also several 
hundred dollars besides, which a banker in his home town had furnished 
him, merely upon the young man's promissory note. He has paid his 
note since coming home, and although he has been in il> health part of 
the time, he rejoices in his missionary service. I met a mother on the 
train whose son was then in the mission field. She said she was hav- 
ing a difficult time to pay the taxes and other expenses and to keep her 
son in the field, and sympathetically I suggested that perhaps he might 
better be released. She turned in her seat suddenly and said : "Brother 
McKay, I would rather work these fingers to the bone than to have my 
boy come home before his duty is performed." These illustrations show 
that this conviction to preach to the world is one which moves to action. 
It is truly powerful, permanent and we hope unconquerable. 

I have said two thousand missionaries are now in the field. Presi- 
dent Grant reported in his opening remarks that there have been ap- 
proximately between 35,000 and 40,000 missionaries sent into service 
since 1837. One of the Presiding Bishopric, informed me the other 
day that if we include local missionaries the number will approximate 
70,000. Suppose that we consider just for illustration, that there have 
been 35,000 foreign missionaries out. Crediting each missionary with 
an earning capacity of $100 per month and his average expense in the 
mission field at $40 a month, and assuming that each missionary has 
averaged two years in the field, this desire to Christianize the world has 
cost the members of the Church $117,600,000. That is not including 
the amount of money spent by the Church for the return fares of the 
elders, nor the amount of money spent on chapels and halls in the mis- 
sion fields. If you add merely the sum expended by the Church to that 
spent by the people during that time you will find that there has been 
expended by this Church for missionary purposes alone, approximately 
$121,500,000, over three-fifths of the assessed valuation of Salt Lake 
City during 1926, and nearly one-sixth the total assessed valuation of 



104 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



the State of Utah. In other words, the people have given in value, 
three-fifths of the city's assessed valuation in an expression of a desire 
to make the world believe in Christianity. I use that term in its proper 
sense — belief in 'Jesus Christ, the Redeemer of the world. Evidently 
there is a force behind this conviction that the world needs Christian- 
izing. 

WHY THE WORLD NEEDS CHRISTIANIZING 

But does the world need Christianizing? Our Protestant brethren 
say, "Why don't you send your elders out to the heathen, why go to 
Christian nations?" As I have said, our mission is to the whole world. 
We believe so-called Christian nations need the message as well as the 
so-called heathen lands, and Christian ministers by their own statements 
confirm this belief. For example : Recently in the Literary Digest 
under a glaring heading, "The crack of doom has sounded for Protest- 
antism," one Reverend Herbert Parrish says that it is his conviction 
that "the sooner Protestantism disappears from American life the bet- 
ter. Its narrow sectarian spirit, fostering division, incapable of a large 
synthesis of values, of unity, unfits it to represent our national religious 
life. * * * As a moral guide it is superficial, depending on the 
exterior force of state legislation to effect the redemption of the race. 
As a mystical experience it is sentimental, without intelligence, and with 
narrow vision. As a teaching force it is vague, negative and uncertain. 
As an organization it is illogical and chaotic." That I consider a very 
severe arraignment of Protestantism by a Protestant pastor. I do not 
know him, nor do I know by what authority he speaks. But having 
this in mind yesterday, as I listened to President Grant quote a minister's 
prognostication as printed in the Anaconda Standard, I thought, well, 
here is another Pastor proving that minister's prognostication correct. 

Probably a more trustworthy and authentic authority is Henry 
Emerson Fosdick, one of the leading thinkers in our nation today, who 
commenting on the need of modern religious leadership writes : 

"No society ever has been healthy whose religious life was unhealthy. Even 
those who are impatient of contemporary formulations of faith, those who are 
outside the churches, and alienated from their denominational loyalty, should still 
be deeply concerned about the fortunes of religion. A society which, providing 
for the future, builds great factories, immense railroad systems, and even in- 
numerable schools, but does not care whether the future has a wholesome relig- 
ious life, is playing a fatally short-sighted game. 

"In view of this fact the situation which we face is serious. Much of our 
contemporary Christianity is not making people better, but worse. It accentuates 
bitterness, brings out meanness, sanctions ignorance and bigotry, divides those 
ivho might otherwise be brotherly, and lapses from its high possibilities into a 
force for spiritual deterioration and decay:" 

Are not these statements and others that might be given, sufficient 
answer regarding the need of working for the Christianizing of the 
world ? 

ARE THE SO-CALLED "MORMONS" CHRISTIANS ? 

However, a more important question for us today is this : "Are the 
so-called 'Mormons' true Christians and does the Church of Jestis Christ 



ELDER DAVID O. McKAY 



105 



of Latter-day Saints contain the elements ot a world-wide Christian 
religion?" It is my sincere belief and testimony that the Latter-day 
Saints commonly called "Mormons,'' are Christians in the truest and 
fullest sense of the term, and that this Church is world-wide in its 
comprehensiveness, in organization, and in its blessing and salvation 
of the human family. As true Christianity should and as it did in the 
days of the Savior, "Mormonism" combines the essential elements in the 
teachings of Israel's prophets, priests and sages ; and in accepting the 
Jehovah of the Old Testament as the Savior of mankind, it fulfils the 
noblest aspirations of the Hebrew race, thereby indicating a world- 
wide scope so far as Israel's people and Israel's God are concerned. 

All that is "virtuous, lovely, of good report, or praiseworthy" in the 
teachings of all the great religious teachers of mankind — teachings that 
today are influencing hundreds of millions of God's children, are com- 
prehended in the ethical teachings of the Church of Jesus Christ. What 
Charles Foster Kent says of the effect of true Christianity, is equally 
true of "Mormonism:" 

"It simply and satisfactorily unites religion and ethics by emphasizing relig- 
ion and by giving to ethics the inspiration of a strong personal faith. It appeals 
to the individual will through both the reason and the emotions. Thereby it 
touches and completely commands the whole man : his intellect, his feelings, his 
faith and his acts. It sets before men a worthy goal ; in the present life true 
happiness, won through self-denial and service, and preserved by faith that frees 
men from the harrassing fears and worries of life. For the future it holds out 
the sure promise of individual peace and joy and growth, since the object of its 
faith is the God of the living, whose beneficent rule is revealed in every phase 
of human experience." 

"Mormonism" is an authoritative religion, yet at the same time the 
most thoroughly democratic Church on earth — a combination that is 
well worthy of serious thought. It emphasizes the universal bonds of 
human brotherhood. It seeks by training the individual conscience and 
will to establish a closely knit, world-wide fraternity. It glorifies hu- 
manity and all normal human relations. It is a spiritual force emanating 
from God himself. 

At one time it grieved me to know that this Church was not num- 
bered among Protestant churches. But now I realize that the Church 
of Christ is more than a protest against the errors and evils of Catholi- 
cism. This Church was established in the only way in which the Church 
of Christ can be established, by direct authority from God. Thus 
founded it invites the whole world to come to a Church recognized by 
God himself, and which offers every advantage that the human mind, 
the emotions and desires may contemplate in the ful filing of the in- 
dividual mission on this earth. "It is an ever-broadening wave of 
direct personal influence, destined ultimately to touch and transform 
all men, so that they like Jesus shall become Godlike." "Mormonism," 
as true Christianity, "subdues selfishness, regulates the passions, sub- 
ordinates the appetites, quickens the intellect, exalts the affections. It 
promotes industry, honesty, truth, purity, kindness. It humbles the 
proud, exalts the lowly, upholds the law, favors liberty, is essential to 
it, and would unite men in one great brotherhood."

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



THE WORLD OUR FIELD OF ACTIVITY 

Most earnestly do I hope that we shall never lose the great con- 
viction that the world is our field of activity. Can you think of any- 
thing more potent in moving a people to action ? 

THIS ENTAILS GREAT RESPONSIBILITY ON US AT HOME 

But what a responsibility this entails of leading good men and good 
women all over this world to know God, and to know what their mis- 
sion is on earth ! Fathers and mothers, fellow workers, do you fully 
realize today what it means to assume the responsibility of carrying 
the message of peace and good will to all men? The base of our opera- 
tions must be here at home. Neglect your duty here and all you under- 
take abroad will be compromised, because people can rightfully ask : 
What do you do at home? What life are you living at home? "What 
you are," says Emerson, "sounds so loud in my ears I cannot hear what 
you say." Every elder therefore who goes abroad to preach this gospel 
must first live the gospel to the best of his ability, and have a conviction 
in his heart that he is preaching the truth. True, at first this testimony 
may be somewhat indefinite; but all our children have it to some extent. 
They breathe it as they breathe the mountain air, but they often neglect 
to define it, to express it in the plane of consciousness. It is the duty 
of presidents of stakes, bishops of wards, to make definite in the minds 
of missionaries this testimony of the truth. Through study, service, 
humility and prayer, this testimony will increase. 

QUALIFICATIONS OF MISSIONARIES AND THE HOME 

Another qualification is this : Every elder should be a Christian 
gentleman always. A gentleman — who is he? "Whoever is open" — 
nothing to hide, no downcast look because of the consciousness of guilt ; 
"whoever is loyal" — loyal to the truth, to virtue, to the Word of Wis- 
dom — "true, of humane and affable demeanor, honorable himself and 
in his judgment of others, faithful to his word as to law, and faithful 
alike to God and to man — such a man is a true gentleman," and such a 
man the elder of this Church should be who goes out to Christianize the 
world. 

Brethren, it is a wonderful school to which we send our young 
men and women — the best in all the world. I weigh that sentence care- 
fully — the best school in all the world ! But it must never be considered 
a reform school for those who are the instructors therein. Keep young 
men who need reforming at home until they attain that degree of lead- 
ership which this Church requires. 

In conclusion, then, with the abiding assurance in our hearts that 
God has restored the true gospel of Christ; with the unshakable con- 
viction that he desires all mankind to hear this gospel, and^that upon 
the Church rests the responsibility of proclaiming it to the world; let 
us first conform our own lives to gospel standards, first set in order 
our own homes, our own states, and then continue to Christianize the 
world; for 



ELDER DAVID 0. McKAY 



107 



"Now the whole world hears. 
Or shall hear,— surely shall hear at the last, 

Though men delay, and doubt, and faint and fall, 

That promise faithful :— 'Fear not, little flock! 
It is your Father's will and joy to give 
To you the Kingdom !' " 

Amen. 



ELDER JOSEPH FIELDING SMITH 

I feel very keenly the responsibility that is upon me this moment, 
and yet I am glad to add a few words to those already spoken. We 
have assembled here to be instructed, and I suppose it is true in the case 
of each of the other speakers, as I know it is with me, that it is im- 
possible to express all the thoughts that arise in the mind as we listen 
to these services. 

PURPOSE OF THE CONFERENCE 

I take it for granted that the purpose of these conferences is that 
we who assemble here may hear instruction. Moreover that the in- 
struction may be as seed planted in our souls, taking root and growing, 
causing reflections in our minds. No doubt when we return to our 
homes we enlarge upon the things we have heard, and through faith 
and study gain greater knowledge, and thus draw nearer to our heav- 
enly Father in the truth. If we do not, then we are not obtaining the 
full benefit of the meetings and the instructions given by the brethren. 
It is our privilege and duty, therefore, to study and enlarge upon the 
things that here are spoken. 

THE FAITH OF YOUNG LATTER-DAY SAINTS 

, Reference has been made by some of the speakers to sentiments 
uttered by those not of our faith, and who are not kindly disposed to- 
wards the Church and its members, to the effect that the youth of 
"Mormonism" — and I place that word in quotation marks — are not 
walking in the footsteps of their fathers, and, that in time the children 
will depart from the faith and accept the teachings of the so-called 
"Christian" sects of the world. As one of the fifth generation in the 
Church I testify that I know this is not true, and that there is faith in 
Israel among the young people. 

The gospel is, as the Savior said, like a net cast in the sea, which 
gathers of all kinds, and naturally there will be some that will have to 
be cast out because they are not good. Without a doubt there are those 
who come into the Church with ulterior motives, and some who are 
always weak in the faith. These latter may become discouraged and 
depart from the Church because they have not understood the truth. 
Again, we know it to be a fact that the unrepentant transgressor will 
deny the faith and turn away in a spirit of bitterness. However, I am 
assured, and I have that assurance in my heart through the teachings 
I have received from the Spirit of the Lord and from the inspiration 



108 



GENHR. I L C VNFE RENCE 



that has come to me from the revelations of the Lord through his ser- 
vants, that the majority of this people will always remain true. 

SIGNIFICANT QUOTATION FROM DANIEL 

Elder Whitney this afternoon referred to the prophesying of Dan- 
iel concerning the restored gospel and the Priesthood. Let me present 
a verse that Daniel uttered which to us, and to all the world, if they will 
receive it, is very significant : 

"And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom • 
which shall never he destroyed ; and the kingdom shall not be left to other peo- 
ple, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall 
stand forever. 

"Forasmuch as thou sawest that the stone was cut out of the mountain 
without hands, and that it break in pieces the iron, the brass, the clay, the silver, 
and the gold ; the great God hath made it known to the king what shall come to 
pass hereafter; and the dream is certain, and the interpretation thereof sure." 

That is the statement of an ancient prophet concerning this latter 
day work — this gospel of the kingdom which has now been restored, 
and the organization the Lord has established, in other words, the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. It will never be destroyed. 
It shall not be given to other people. While many will come into the 
Church, and some will go out of it, the great majority of its members 
will remain true and faithful to the truth, and the Kingdom is bound 
to grow until jt shall fill the earth. 

WORLDLY RELIGIOUS SYSTEMS 

I think that the Protestant ministers, to whom Elder McKay re- 
ferred — Mr. Parrish and Mr. Fosdick — have spoken better than they 
knew in their arraignment of the Protestant world. Not only do their 
remarks apply to Protestantism, but to all creeds, sects and parties that 
are not recognized of the Lord, for he has decreed that in this dispen- 
sation of the fulness of times he would break in pieces and bring to 
naught every work that js not of him. He declared, through Paul, that 
it was "according to his good pleasure, which he hath purposed in him- 
self, that in the dispensation of the fulness of times he might gather 
together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven and which 
are on earth ; even in him." And as he has decreed, so he will fulfil. 
All things that pertain to the salvation of man have been restored in this 
dispensation preparatory to the coming of Christ and the setting up of 
his kingdom with absolute authority over all the earth. When that 
time comes, and Christ reigns, all that now exists contrary to that 
Kingdom and in conflict with it must come to an end. If people are 
engaged in works which are not approved of the Lord, the earlier they 
come to an understanding of the truth and come out of them and learn 
to serve the Lord, the better it is for them. It is far better to know the 
truth and forsake error than to remain in the systems of the world which 
are not approved by the Lord and therefore in due time must cease tc 
exist. That day is near at hand, and because of it the Lord has sent 
forth his servants in the world proclaiming his gospel and crying re- 



ELDER JOSEPH FIELDING SMITH 



109 



pentance, that all who will may hear and escape. It is within the reach 
of all who are willing to forsake error, to know the truth and the 
established work of the Lord. 

THE ENEMY SHALL NOT OVERCOME 

When the Priesthood was restored to Joseph Smith by John the 
Baptist (I speak now of the Aaronic Priesthood) the promise was made 
that it should remain on the earth and should not be taken away. So 
we look for the Church with all its power to grow and develop until 
all the righteous are gathered into the kingdom of God. For it is the 
will of our Father that all who are willing to serve him and seek light 
and truth shall have the opportunity. In a revelation given to the 
Prophet Joseph Smith, January 2, 1831, before the Church was one 
year old, the Lord said : 

"Wherefore, gird up your loins, and be prepared. Behold, the kingdom is 
yours, and the enemy shall not overcome." 

I have faith in that. He has given to us the kingdom. He has 
made us the promise that the enemy of the kingdom shall not overcome. 
We may have trouble. We have had trouble. We may meet with op- 
position, but that opposition shall fail in its endeavor to destroy the 
work of God. 

Now the Lord has said something more in the verses which follow 
the one I have given you, and these are very significant and very timely : 

"Verily I say unto you, ye are clean, but not all ; and there is none else 
with whom I am well pleased." 

THERE ARE SOME TARES IN THE CHURCH 

The Lord could not say he was well pleased with all the members 
of the Church. For, even then, as now, there were some in the Church 
who were not clean. Nevertheless he did declare this Church was the 
only one with which he was well pleased. He could not say that of the 
systems and organizations extant which will not hearken to his word 
and obey his commandments, but set up doctrines of their own, con- 
trary to his laws and ordinances. It is only natural, since he did estab- 
lish his Church, to speak of it in the terms which he did and while ex- 
pressing satisfaction with the organization as a whole yet point out 
forcibly the fact that there were in the Church some tares guilty of sin. 
After making this statement he further says: 

"For all flesh is corrupted before me ; and the powers of darkness prevail 
upon the earth, among the children of men, in the presence of all the hosts of 
heaven — 

"Which causeth silence to reign, and all eternity is pained, and the angels 
are waiting the great command to reap down the earth, to gather the tares that 
they may be burned ; and, behold, the enemy is combined." 

GREAT THINGS TO TAKE PLACE IN THIS AGE 

So the Lord points out the fact that great things are to take place 



110 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



in the earth in this day. The gospel has been restored, and the king- 
dom given to his Saints according to the prophecy of Daniel. It is not 
again to be removed, destroyed, or given to other people, and in his 
own way and time he is going to break down all other systems, that his 
kingdom may prevail and that he may come and reign as Lord of lords 
and King of kings upon the face of the whole earth. 

THE RESTORED CHURCH NOT TO BE REMOVED 

Again in reference to this same matter, which is in harmony with 
that which we have heard this afternoon from the other speakers, the 
Lord said : 

"And verily I say unto you, the rest of my servants, go ye forth as your 
circumstances shall permit, in your several callings, unto the great and notable 
cities and villages, reproving the world in righteousness of all their unrighteous 
and ungodly deeds, setting forth clearly and understandingly the desolation of 
abomination in the last days. 

"For, with you saith the Lord Almighty, I will rend their kingdoms ; I will 
not only shake the earth, but the starry heavens shall tremble. 

"For I, the Lord, have put forth my hand to exert the powers of heaven ; 
ye cannot see it now, yet a little while and ye shall see it, and know that T am, 
and that I will come and reign with my people. 

"I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end. Amen." 

So again in these modern scriptures the Lord has called attention 
to the fact that he is going to destroy systems and organizations and 
combinations that are false. And how is he going to do it? By giving 
their members the truth, if they will receive it ; by giving them the priv- 
ilege of coming out of those organizations to receive the truth and have 
every opportunity to come into his kingdom, for his hand is out- 
stretched ready to greet them. If they will not come ; if they will not 
receive his message, then of course they must fall with their systems. 
Truth will prevail ; truth will stand when all else is removed, and it is 
destined to cover the face of the earth. 

FALSE SYSTEMS TO BE DESTROYED 

In one of these scriptures I have presented, the Lord said the 
angels are waiting to reap down the earth. I heard President Wilford 
Woodruff make the statement, in this very spot where I now stand, at 
a conference of the Church, that these angels had been sent forth on 
their mission to reap down the earth, to tie in bundles the tares for the 
burning and to gather the Saints of God. I heard him make this state- 
ment on several occasions. Moreover he said from that time forth, and 
that was about the year 1894, earthquakes, pestilence, war, famine, 
plague, and other commotions among both men and the elements would 
increase and continue until the coming of Christ. 

In the revelation known to us as the "revelation on war," the Lord 
declared that he had decreed the overthrow of nations, "until the con- 
sumption decreed hath made a full end of all nations." In that day, 
when this shall come to pass, the nation set up by the Lord must reign 
supreme and all other powers, kingdoms, organizations and societies 
shall pass away, for so it is decreed. 



ELDER JOSEPH FIELDING SMITH

ADVICE AND ADMONITION TO THE SAINTS 

Now, just a word or two in conclusion, as advice and admonition 
to the Latter-day Saints. We are living in perilous times. I do not 
feel that we ought to sit down and take things easy, to partake of all 
the sins and follies of the world and their systems and do just as they 
do in all respects. We should strictly observe the Sabbath day. We 
should keep the Word of Wisdom. We cannot afford to discard the 
doctrine of prayer. If we turn away from these principles which mean 
so much to us, we cannot be approved of the Lord. The world is turn- 
ing from these fundamental principles. They do not mean to the or- 
dinary individual in the world what they used to mean. Many pro- 
fessed ministers of Christ are making light of these sacred things ; not 
all of them, for there are yet some who are devout and sincere in the 
things they are teaching. However, a great many professed teachers 
of the gospel have discarded the fundamental truth upon which sal- 
vation is based. We should not pin our faith in men, or in their phil- 
osophies and their worldly teachings. The world is full of doctrines 
and vain philosophy diametrically opposed to the gospel of Jesus Christ. 
And I say to you, my brethren and sisters, we ought to follow the ad- 
monition the Lord has given us to stand in holy places and be not 
moved, and be just a little more firm in the keeping of his command- 
ments. We should make a more careful search of the Scriptures and 
the revelations of the Lord. 

We have no business violating the Sabbath day. In the Priest- 
hood conferences, which have been held in the stakes of Zion during the 
past three months, we have put a great deal of stress upon this prin- 
ciple. We have been teaching the people the necessity of observing the 
Sabbath day and keeping it holy. I regret very much that, even in com- 
munities of Latter-day Saints, this doctrine is not looked upon as it 
ought to be by some ; that we have those among us who seem to feel 
that it is perfectly right to follow the custom of the world in this re- 
gard. They are partakers of the ideas and notions of the world in vio- 
lation of the commandments of the Lord. But if we do this the Lord 
will hold us accountable, and we cannot violate his word and receive the 
blessings of the faithful. 

We cannot afford to discard the doctrine of prayer. We should 
be teaching our children in our homes to pray ; we should pray in secret, 
and in our hearts, and'before our families. Without the spirit of prayer 
we cannot please the Lord ; we cannot stand before him in favor if we 
are not willing to acknowledge his hand in all things and keep his com- 
mandments. These are the words he has given us by revelation. 

NECESSARY TO WALK IN THE FULL LIGHT OF TRUTH 

We cannot afford not to pay our tithing, nor can we afford to turn 
away from any. other principles of the gospel. I fully endorse the re- 
mark made by one of the speakers here yesterday, that it is necessary 
for us to walk in the full light of the truth, not in part of the truth only. 
I haven't the privilege of discarding some of the principles of the gos- 



112 



GENER. IL CONFERENCE 



pel and believing others, and then feel that 1 am entitled to the full bless- 
ings of salvation and exaltation in the kingdom of God. Jf we want 
exaltation,, if we want the place which the Lord has prepared for those 
who are just and true, then we must be willing to walk in the full light 
of the gospel of Jesus Christ, and keep all the commandments. We 
cannot say that some of them are small and insignificant and therefore 
the Lord will not care if we violate them. We are commanded to live 
by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God. "Why call ye me 
Lord, Lord," he says, "and do not the things that I say?" So he spoke 
to his disciples when he was with them, and he has also spoken to us 
in this day in a similar way, saying: "If ye love me, keep my com- 
mandments." 

I pray that we may all walk in the light of the truth as it has been 
revealed to us, observing to do all things required by the Lord, which, 
through our faithfulness and perseverence, will insure our exaltation 
in the Kingdom of God. This is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

INTRODUCING STAKE PRESIDENTS \ 

I have been calling, from time to time, for brief remarks, not to 
exceed five or six minutes, from some of the stake presidents. All of 
the stake presidents, with the exception of one, who happened to be ab- 
sent, have had the privilege of either opening or closing our meetings 
by prayer. But there have been so many changes made of late in stake 
presidencies, that there are about thirty-six of them at present who 
have not had the opportunity of speaking. We will now call on some 
of those who have been longest in office, asking them to occupy five 
or six minutes. 

ELDER C. ALVIN ORME 

President of the Tooele Stoke of Zion 

My brethren and sisters: As I approach this position there is a 
scriptural saying which comes to my mind, to the effect that, "The 
place whereon thou standest is holy ground." 

I rejoice in the testimonies that we have heard during this con- 
ference. As I came into the building yesterday morning, President Grant 
was delivering his opening address, and I rejoiced in the testimony 
which he had in his heart of the divinity of the gospel of the Lord 
Jesus Christ, and the necessity of obedience unto that which has been 
revealed by the Lord, through the Prophet Joseph Smith — the sacred 
ordinances of the House of the Lord, in the temple marriages and 
other ceremonies, and in the testimonies of the healing power that has 
been in the Church since its organization. That power which char- 
acterized the ancient Church, and the power and authority given unto 
the apostles of the Lord Jesus Christ during his ministry, to heal the

sick, to open the eyes of the blind, and cause the lame to walk, is in this 
Church. I add my testimony, to those which have been given during 
this conference, that those principles and powers and gifts are with the 
Church, and that we enjoy them. As men and women in Israel who 
have had these precious truths and gifts given to us, may we treasure 
them, prize them highly, and live by the revelations which God our 
Father has given for our salvation. May we walk in his paths and at- 
tain the degree of glory and eternal life that he has promised unto the 
faithful, which all who have been baptized by immersion for the re- 
mission of sins, and who have had hands laid on them for the gift of 
the Holy Ghost, being born of the water and of the Spirit, shall have 
by living according to that which God has revealed. I bear testimony 
tc these things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER BYRON O. COLTON 

President of the Roosevelt Stake of Zion 

My (tear brethren and sisters: This is certainly a surprise to me, 
and I assure you that I am in need of your sympathy and faith, that the 
time I may occupy may be for our mutual benefit and blessing. 

I have rejoiced in all the testimonies which have been borne dur- 
ing this conference. The inspiration of the Lord has been with those 
who have spoken, and 1 am sure that the Saints who have been gath- 
ered together here have found joy in listening to them. 

From my youth I have been taught the principles of the gospel. 
In my early youth my father paid little attention- to the Church and its 
organization, but during all that period of some seventeen years, I have 
heard my mother repeatedly say she never ceased to pray that he might 
yield obedience to the principles of the gospel, and accept the same of 
his own volition. Though he was born of Latter-day Saint parents, as 
was the case with many "Mormon" youths at that time, he went into 
neighboring states and places, and for a time seemed to lose the faith, 
but later accepted it and has been true to it ever since. 

I am grateful to my heavenly Father that I was born of goodly par- 
ents, that through them a testimony of the truth has come to me. I do 
not hesitate to think that perhaps it would have been difficult for me 
to accept the gospel, had I been found in the world as many peo- 
ple have been. I rejoice in the opportunities that have come to me, in 
the responsibilities that have been given to me, because out of them I 
have found joy and satisfaction, and I have seen in my brethren a desire 
for the benefit and blessing of the people about them. In the councils 
of my brethren, into which I have had the privilege of being called, and 
in joining with them, I have never seen aught, nor heard aught that was 
not good, never any manifestation or desire, or intent to injure any, but 
always the spirit of service and consideration, that those who make up 
the Church and those not of the Church should be benefited and blessed. 
Nothing but good has ever been evidenced in their intent and their pur- 
poses. To these testimonies also have come the testimonies of the 
Spirit, and in trial and in responsibilities that I have borne I have seen 



114 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



evidences of the truth of this work. I do not doubt it. I have never 
had any doubt as to the integrity of the men who have been called of the 
Lord to lead this work. 

I see in the scriptures, in the standard works of the Church, in the 
writings of those whose minds have been drawn out to write of the 
things of the Lord, and teach the people, that which is for our good. I 
rejoice in the Book of Mormon. To me it is an indisputable testimony of 
the truth of this work. Its very existence demonstrates to me, together 
with a knowledge of its coming forth, that it is of the Lord. So also 
with the Pearl of Great Price. The thought came to me while some of 
the brethren were speaking this morning that it is a strange thing that 
the records which were found seemingly so mysteriously, that made up 
part of the Pearl of Great Price, should find their way into the 
hands of the Prophet Joseph, and yet, if the Lord had a servant on 
earth, if he had a prophet in existence, isn't it only natural that it should 
find its way into his hands, and should be published to the world? 

I bear you my testimony, my brethren and sisters, that the peace 
of the gospel has come into my soul, and I am satisfied without any 
doubt whatever of its truth. I see in its principles a philosophy that 
would serve the human race, principles that will mean our salvation 
temporally and spiritually; and I feel, my brethren and sisters, that 
the little service that I can render, the little value that I may be to my 
brethren and sisters, and to myself, in all the things that I may be able 
to do, and that the Lord may help me to do, is of little consequence un- 
less the Lord helps me and helps others to understand me and my en- 
deavors to keep his commandments and to serve in this work. It seems 
to me that the frailties of human kind, the weaknesses of human nature, 
and the littleness of men, particularly of myself, grow upon me from 
time to time, and I recognize how much I need the blessing and Spirit 
of the Lord and his help to uphold me and guide me in the work that I 
am called upon to do. 

I pray the Lord to bless us with satisfaction and with joy, and with 
a continued testimony of his goodness unto us. I thank him for these 
things that have come into my life, for the privileges and blessings that 
have come to me through the gospel, and I do it, and bear my testimony 
unto you, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 



ELDER WAYNE H. REDD 

President of the San Juan Stake of Zion 

The thought of standing before this vast audience and speaking to 
the Saints, and to those who may be listening in over the radio, almost 
overawes me. But I am happy in the thought that I am associated with 
this class of people. I feel that the greatest knowledge in this world 
is a knowledge of God, for the Savior said to know Jesus Christ is life 
eternal ; and I feel the greatest thing that anyone can do in this world 
is to conquer himself and to bring himself into line with the gospel of 
Jesus Christ. 



ELDER WAYNE H. REDD 



115 



The Lord in his goodness and mercy to me gave me a testimony, 
while yet in my teens, and as I have labored in the Church from that 
day to this, it has grown brighter, until I feel that I know that the gos- 
pel is true, whether I know anything else in the world or not. 

I have a great many things for which to be thankful, as one who 
comes from the land of magnificent distances and the home of the noble 
red men. I feel that the thing that we have most to be thankful for, 
that has happened in our neighborhood in recent years, is the fact that 
the Indians who have harrassed the people in that section since the set- 
tlement of that country a few years ago, are rounded up, and the gov- 
ernment has come there and taken charge of them and settled them, and 
has chosen one of our people to teach them how to live better. One of 
our returned elders is the man who is looking after them. The govern- 
ment is now putting their children in school and they are fed and 
clothed, and it is not necessary for them to pillage the settlers and to 
harrass the women and children. 

The Lord is good to his people, in every section where they turn 
unto him and serve him. The greatest desire of my life is that I may 
be worthy of the confidence that my brethren have imposed in me. I 
have every confidence in those who preside over me. Never in my life 
have I seen anything in their conduct that would cause me to lose con- 
fidence in them. I know that the Church of Christ is growing, and that 
those who are seeking after the Lord may find him. I have said a 
great many times that I think it is about the easiest thing in the world 
to know that the Lord lives, if men will be honest, truthful, virtuous, 
attend to their prayers, and live a Christ-like life. I want to say to the 
Latter-day Saints, that if our boys and girls will but function in the 
organizations of the Church, take part therein, and live clean lives, they 
will know that the Lord lives, that Jesus is the Christ, and that the resur- 
rection is a reality, the most wonderful knowledge in all the world. 

May we all be true to the covenants we have made with one an- 
other, and to the testimony of Jesus Christ which is implanted within 
our hearts ; and be obedient in all things, that we may be saved in his 
kingdom, is my prayer, in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

President Grant announced that the general priesthood meeting 
would be held Monday evening at 7 o'clock. 

The choir and congregation sang, "Redeemer of Israel." 

Benediction was offered by Elder Geo. W. Green, former counselor 
in the presidency of the Lethbridge stake of Zion. 

Meeting adjourned till 10 o'clock a. m., Tuesday, April 5, 1927. 



THIRD DAY 



MORNING MEETING 

The conference reassembled on Tuesday morning, April 5, 1927, 
at 10 o'clock. 

President Heber J. Grant announced the opening hymn, "O say 
what is truth?" which was sung by the choir and congregation. 

The opening prayer was offered by Elder Joseph R. Sheppard, 
president of the Logan temple. 

A duet, "O God, our help in ages past," was sung by Arlene Davis 
and Hyrum J. Christensen. 

ELDER JOHN M. KNIGHT 

President of the Western States Mission 

Words fail me, my brethren and sisters, adequately to express my 
feelings, in attending this conference. 1 have been thrilled by the testi- 
monies which have been borne in my hearing" by the presiding author- 
ities of the Church. 

I am very grateful for the privilege given unto me to render serv- 
ice in the mission field. That service has brought into my life a joy 
that is more than pleasure, a joy that is greater than happiness. It is a 
privilege to attend the sessions of conference, held here, semi-annually, 
and to partake of the spirit of these gatherings, to worship with you 
before the Lord. "Man," says one great philosopher, ''is incurably re- 
ligious. The desire to worship is inherent, inborn." 

We read frequently in the public press that there are some fifty 
million people in the United States identified with the various churches 
in this country ; that there are between fifty and sixty million people 
who are not identified or affiliated with any church organization. There 
is, however, a tremendous amount of personal religion in the world. 
I find in my association with the people that are not identified with 
any of these organizations that they are deeply religious, many of them, 
that they think for themselves, and it is from this class that the majority 
of our converts, in the Western States mission, come. 

I asked a prominent clergyman in the state of Colorado, a short 
time ago, what his greatest problems were. He answered me that the 
three great characteristics of present-day church life are, our intense 
triviality, the uncertainty of our position, and our complacency, na- 
tional, civic and religious. Said he, "We have sociability instead of 
sacraments, statistics instead of salvation." I assured him that we were 
not so situated, and stressed the fact that we were not uncertain with 
regard to our position on fundamental doctrines of the Church. The 
burden of our message to the world has been that God has spoken and 
that he has delivered his word and restored his gospel anew to the 
children of earth, in the nineteenth century. We have renewed the 



ELDER JOHN M. KNIGHT 



117 



promise that has come flown through the ages from the Master's lips, 
that if men will serve him and keep his commandments and yield obe- 
dience to the saving ordinances of the gospel, they shall know of the 
doctrine, whether it is of God, or whether we speak of ourselves. 

I asked a lady a few days ago why she was not identified with 
any of the churches of the world, and she replied, "Because in my in- 
vestigation of the various systems of religion, I have discovered so 
many theological contradictions." We invited her to make a thor- 
ough investigation of the claims made by the Latter-day Saints, and 
assured her that she would find no theological contradictions ; but, on 
the contrary, she would discover that the Church is built upon a solid 
foundation ; that it is built upon Jesus Christ our Lord and upon the 
foundation of apostles and prophets, the Savior of the world being 
the chief cornerstone; and that she would find peace to her soul if 
she would obey the commandments of God and the fundamental doc- 
trines that are taught by the Church. She has later assured me, hav- 
ing come into the Church, that she has had greater joy in the few 
months she has been identified with the Church of Jesus Christ of Lat- 
ter-day Saints than in all her experience up to joining the Church. 

There is only one way that we may be satisfied of the truth, and 
that is through the power of the Holy Ghost, which is promised to 
every individual who obeys the gospel of the Master. The clergyman 
to whom I have referred made this statement: "Christ is the supreme 
issue confronting the world at the present time." Our declaration to 
the world is that they may know the Christ if they obey his gospel. 
Through the power of the Holy Ghost they may be assured of his real- 
ity, and the efficacy of his atonement in redeeming the world. He de- 
clared to his disciples that all power was given him in heaven and in 
earth and instructed them to go out and preach the gospel of repent- 
ance, baptizing in the name of the Father, and pf the Son, and of the 
Holy Ghost, teaching people to observe all things whatsoever he had 
commanded them. He had said to his disciples that no man knoweth 
the Father save the Son. Neither knoweth any man the Son, save the 
Father, and him to whom he will reveal him. He invited men and 
women everywhere to come unto him, and to take upon themselves his 
yoke, for he said, "My yoke is easy, and my burden is light." Ampli- 
fying the statement of the Master, the Apostle Paul declared that no 
man, speaking by the Spirit, calleth Jesus accursed, and no man can say 
that Jesus is the Christ but by the Holy Ghost. 

We affirm that the Church which we represent out in the world, 
this Church, is the Church of Jesus Christ. He organized it ; he owns 
it, and it is his\ and the organizations represented here today are the 
instrumentality through which our Father may promulgate the glorious 
truths of the gospel to the nations of the earth. 

1 bear my testimony to you, my brethren and sisters, that I know, 
as I know that I live, that these things are true, that God lives, that 
Jesus Christ, his Son, is the Redeemer of the world, and that Joseph 
Smith was and is a prophet of the living God, and those who have been 



118 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



associated with him are men of God and are the mouthpiece of our 
Father unto the children of men. 

Reference was made to the fact that some of the younger genera- 
tion would deny the faith. I call to mind that we have in the Western 
States mission at least one who was associated with the Prophet Joseph 
Smith in Nauvoo. I attended a meeting in a small town where he re- 
sides and listened to his testimony. I listened to the testimony of his 
son and his grandson, and his great-grandson, and every one of them 
testified that he knew that Joseph Smith was a Prophet of God. The 
man who had been an eye and ear witness to the power that rested upon 
the prophet of the nineteenth century was no more sure of his position 
than the youngest man who bore his testimony, because he had re- 
ceived that witness from the Holy Spirit. 

May God help us to appreciate our responsibility and to render 
service in the cause of Christ, that the world may be left without excuse 
in the day of judgment, I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER JOHN G. ALLRED 

President of the Northcentral States Mission 

I sincerely desire that the few moments I occupy I may be inspired 
by that same spirit which has characterized this conference thus far. 

One of the ancient prophets, as he saw in prophetic vision the in- 
troduction of this great work, said that it was to be a marvelous work 
and a wonder. It is not only to be a marvelous work and a wonder in 
one way, but in every way. 

Another prophet, in speaking of the ministry of this great work, 
said that in the latter days the Lord would gather his Israel, one of a 
city and two of a family and bring them to Zion, where he would give 
them pastors after his own heart, who would teach them with knowledge 
and with understanding. 

When the Redeemer was in the world he chose twelve pastors. 
What was the status of these pastors? Certainly they were men after 
God's own heart. The Lord passed by men like Gamaliel who educated 
one of those pastors, and at whose feet one of those pastors listened 
and was taught ; passed by Herod and all of the mighty men, so far as 
worldly wisdom was concerned, and went out into Galilee and chose 
ordinary fishermen. He took those twelve men away to the mount, 
and said to them: "You have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, 
and ordained you, and I give you power." That power which he gave 
those men afterwards concerned the whole world. Even the Roman 
Empire was shaken to its foundations, for they defied it when they 
had Peter and John before them as prisoners, and charged them that 
they should not preach Jesus Christ any more in Jerusalem. The sim- 
ple answer of Peter and John was : "Shall we obey man or God ?'" and 
the Roman Empire said: "If ye do not obey man, we will incarcerate 
you with chains and ball." And they put them into prison, but that 
power which God had given them released them from that prison and 
they went back and said, W e are preaching things that we know ; we 



ELDER JOHN G. ALLRED 



119 



are not preaching that which we have believed or which we think is cor- 
rect. We are preaching that thing which we do know. They knew not 
only that Jesus was the Christ, but they knew that his doctrines were of 
God, by the same power that they knew he was the Christ. They knew 
that his doctrines contained the elements of salvation. 

Now what kind of pastors has the Lord raised up in this day and 
generation ? What of these forty thousand men who have been sent 
forth to preach this gospel from the beginning of this Church, in 1830? 
Where were they educated ? Where were they trained ? Whence came 
their knowledge? They were men after God's own heart, and one of 
the things that characterized these ministers was that they went out 
and declared the things which they knew. Not from book-learning ; 
not from scholastic education, but by the same power that Peter knew, 
and they knew by the same power that Peter knew, and they declared 
as Paul did when he said, ""Brethren, I come not to you with the wis- 
dom of men, nor the learning of the world, but with the revelations of 
Jesus Christ." And these young men and women have faith. They 
have been largely young men and women who have gone out into the 
world — men and women after God's own heart. And they have borne 
witness, and that witness has been effective because it has been inspired. 

Not long ago in our mission one of our young lady missionaries, 
only twenty years of age, was invited to dine with a sectarian preacher. 
As soon as the luncheon was over he proceeded to ridicule her and her 
religion. She was young in the field, and not able to cope with him and 
his learning, and after he had spoken at some length in ridicule of the 
message that she had been sent forth to proclaim, she simply gathered 
her wraps and hat, and stood at his door, and in the majesty of her 
young womanhood, and in the power of her calling, she bore testimony 
that she knew that Jesus Christ was the Redeemer of the world, and 
that Joseph Smith was a prophet of the living God. The wife pushed 
her husband aside and went over and put her arms around the girl and 
hugged her and said, "That is the kind of testimony ; that is the spirit 
that will win the world." 

God has chosen pastors after his own heart, and he has planted in 
the hearts of those pastors an individual testimony that God lives. Is 
it not true all over the missions? Ask these mission presidents, if the 
young men and women who come to them, many times without this 
testimony, do not in a few months time stand up and say, "I know the 
Church is true." That is the thing the world needs today— men and 
women who know whereof they speak, and who are able to back up 
what they say by the prophecies and teachings of the prophets of God. 

One elder said not long ago: "We want to preach the things the 
Lord has revealed, and then go to these scriptures and prove that that 
is the thing he revealed in ages past." 

This is the work of God. He is gathering Israel from the nations 
of the earth, one of a city and two of a family, and he is bringing them 
to Zion. He is doing it by the very power which he introduced into 
this great work and planted in the hearts of the young men and women 
of Zion, who, I testify, will never fail to proclaim this truth to the 



120 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



world. 1 have been associated with these young men and women to the 
delight of my soul, knowing that there arc no hotter men and women 
in all the world than these whom God has sent out to preach the gospel. 

1 bring' to you, my brethren and sisters, from the Northcentral 
States mission, the love, the faith, and a testimony of the integrity and 
the virtue of the young men and women who comprise that mission. God 
bless the Latter-day Saints. Send us more help. Men and women who 
do not know will know, if they come into the field and will live a godly 
life and follow the instructions of the brethren. They will know the 
truth and will be able to stand up with their brethren, shoulder to 
shoulder, and testify that they know this work is true. 

May God be mindful of his people ever, and bless them so that 
the testimony which they now have may increase and grow. May 
we be witnesses to the world, for this gospel of the kingdom shall be 
preached in it, not to convert the world, but as a witness, and then shall 
the end come. May we make this witness ring"* from one end of the 
earth to the other, and fulfil the responsibility which God has placed 
upon us, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER JOHN H. TAYLOR 

President of the Northern States Mission 

I am very happy, my brethren and sisters, to have the privilege of 
being a missionary, preaching the gospel of Jesus Christ. I am sure 
that all of the missionaries, at times, become more or less restless, and 
rather anxious about the advancement of the work in the mission field. 
At times we feel that the work is rather slow and that we are not quite 
accomplishing what we should accomplish. This feeling undoubtedly 
comes because of the love of the gospel that we have in our hearts and 
the knowledge that it is the gospel of salvation, and that without it men 
and women cannot be saved in the kingdom of God. Therefore, we are 
anxious that the gospel may come to the knowledge and understanding 
of all of the men and women of the earth. 

Recently I was approached by a gentleman who has charge of a 
radio station. He made inquiry as to whether we wanted to use a time 
on the Sabbath clay to deliver our message to the people by radio, reach- 
ing perhaps three million people. We have commenced that service at 
home and undoubtedly this kind of education, in the gospel of Jesus 
Christ, will be established in the different parts of the earth, so that all 
may have the. privilege of listening in and obtaining some understand- 
ing of the gospel we are preaching. 

The Lord is opening the way, and as we come to the large cities 
and are shut out of the buildings, and it is very difficult to get in touch 
with the people, the Lord is opening a way whereby we can reach them 
in their homes and explain the gospel to them. I am sure that we will 
never abandon the personal labor of the missionary, but we will some 
day reach more of the homes than we are reaching at the present time. 

This gospel is a strenuous one. It makes men and women work. 
It requires great service at the hands of people who belong to the 



ELDER JOHN H. TAYLOR 



121 



Church, Jand if jinen and women want to find an easy church, an easy 
way to get religion, the Church of Jesus Christ is not the place for them. 
\\ e require service at the hands of the people, and the nearer men and 
women live up to the gospel precepts, the stronger and the better they 
are. We are not afraid for our young people who understand the gos- 
pel of Christ. We are afraid for our young people when they are 
ignorant and untrained in the beautiful truths and doctrines that we 
teach in our Church. We are convinced and have proof of the fact that 
if our young people will study and learn the beautiful truths of the 
gospel that there is no danger of their going astray or accepting other 
teachings. We are not withholding books from them. We are not 
keeping them from association with men and women. In fact we send 
them out by the thousands that they may come in contact with the 
trained and the untrained, that they may more thoroughly become fa- 
miliar with the gospel of Jesus Christ. And just as surely as they will 
go out and study the gospel and acquire a knowledge of its principles 
and become educated in its service and acquire humility that they may 
have the Spirit of God, our young people will always stay with us and 
will grow up to be men and women who will serve God and keep his 
commandments. 

I am rather surprised, as I travel among the people, at their attitude 
in regard to Jesus Christ, the Son of God. I had the opinion when I 
was young that everyone believed in Jesus Christ, and that our great 
duty perhaps in a missionary line would be to preach Joseph Smith 
and his great mission. But we find that it is necessary in this day to 
preach Jesus Christ and him crucified. In fact that was the message 
and the admonition of the prophet to the first elders who went out into 
the world to preach the gospel. The instructions of today seem almost 
like repetitions of what has happened in the past. We read in the Hook 
of Mormon about Korihor and Nehor and others who went out and 
preached against the coming of the Savior, and told the people that he 
was not to come, and that it was not necessary to put faith in him, that 
in the end they should be saved in the kingdom of God. We know that 
we cannot be saved in the kingdom of God unless we acknowledge 
Jesus Christ as the Son of God, we know that he came upon the earth 
and gave his life that we might live again. 

May the Lord bless us and help us as a people to stand true and 
firm in the faith of our fathers. I trust that we will not give up our 
faith in our Lord and Master Jesus Christ. I trust that we shall never 
do anything that may cause us to lose our faith and so make us ashamed 
of the gospel or of the Prophet Joseph Smith. He is a prophet of God 
and restored to us the gospel of salvation. May we love our Savior, 
be true to his teachings and follow out his admonitions, I humbly pray 
in the name of Jesus Christ our Redeemer. Amen. 

ELDER WM. R. SLOAN 

President of the N orthzvestern States Mission 
This is truly an inspirational sight, my brethren and sisters, to 
stand in the presence of these mighty servants of our eternal Father, 



122 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



and I assure you I feel my weakness and my humility this morning as, 
perchance, I have never felt it before in all my life. 

I read an article in the February issue of Current History. The 
article is entitled "The Re-building of Pre-Historic America and Ameri- 
can Art." The writer said most of us believe it was Columbus- who 
discovered America, but that facts are now available to prove that 
America had been peopled ; that great cities and towns had flourished 
here, not only of tens and hundreds, but of thousands, many hundreds 
of years before the time of Columbus. 

As I listened to the remarks of President John M. Knight I was 
reminded of an experience which I had three years ago in his mission. 
Down in an Indian pueblo, — south of Albuquerque, New Mexico, I met 
an Indian by the name of Pablo Chito. He speaks English, Spanish 
and French and nine different Indian dialects. In my conversation 
with him I said: "Pablo, how do you account for these many tribes 
of Indians, and where do they all reside?" He said, "They are all resi- 
dents of the state of New Mexico." "Do you mean to tell me that each 
of them speaks a different dialect and that not one tribe understands 
the language of the other?" He said that was true. I said, "Pablo, 
have you ever read the Bible?" He said, "Yes, I have." I said: "Do 
you remember the 48th and 49th chapters of Genesis, where old father 
Jacob called his son Joseph, and he with his two sons, Ephraim and 
Manasseh, met that good old Patriarch? Father Jacob crossed his 
hands and laid his left hand on the head of Manasseh and his right hand 
upon the head of Ephraim. Joseph, seeing the mistake of his father, 
went to correct him, and said, "Father, you have your right hand upon 
Ephraim, and Ephraim is younger." Father Jacob said, "Joseph, I 
know what I am doing. Manasseh's blessings shall be great, but 
Ephraim's blessings shall be greater. Ephraim shall become a multitude 
of nations." Then in the next chapter we read of his calling his twelve 
sons together, and he said unto Joseph : "Joseph's blessings shall ex- 
tend above those of his progenitors. Joseph is a fruitful bough by a 
well, and his branches shall run over the wall, and they shall become 
a multitude of nations," etc. I said. "Pablo, have you read that?" He 
said, "Yes, I have," and he said, "I would like to tell you something, 
Mr. Sloan. Do you see that little house yonder?" As he pointed, 
he said: "That house was built four generations before Columbus dis- 
covered America. You think that he was the first man to discover 
America." Then he said : "Mr. Sloan, I have a diary that goes back 
twenty-three generations before Columbus discovered America, and 
there were many white men here before Columbus' day." This struck 
me with a force that I had never felt in my life before, -and I have tried * 
to analyze his statement. This man's diary goes back twenty-three gen- 
erations before Columbus discovered America. I have done some little 
temple work myself and I have been figuring back to enumerate, if I 
could, just what a numerous posterity that would mean, and I have only 
gone back twenty-one generations. If you read that wonderful Book 
of Mormon you will see that there have been thousands and millions 
of people who have lived on the American continent, and Mr. Hampden, 



ELDER WILLIAM R. SLOAN 



123 



in his article in Current History, enumerates them as millions and mil- 
lions of people. 

Just recently I received a letter from one of the missionaries in 
the Northwestern States mission in which he recounted this experience 
to me. He said : "President Sloan, we called on a man and left with 
him a Book of Mormon." I do not know why the missionary should 
have done this without any explanation whatsoever as to the contents of 
the Book of Mormon and as to its purpose. But he said the man took 
the book and as he read it he found that it spoke of a wonderful people 
which came from Jerusalem. They lived upon this continent for a few 
years and then they divided and subdivided, and conflicts arose, and a 
curse was placed upon some of these people and a dark skin was the 
result of this curse. This man thought to himself, "Can this be the 
negro race of people?" Then as he read further along in the book he 
found that some day these people were to become white and delightsome 
again, and he could not imagine that this would be the negro people. 
One day after reading from this book and thinking much about it he 
went to visit his daughter who lived just a half block distant from where 
he was then residing. He spent the afternoon and stayed all night at 
his daughter's home. During 'the night, after he had retired and fallen 
asleep, he had what you may call a dream or a vision, or what you will. 
He was taken into a valley through which a river of water was run- 
ning. Trees were on both sides of the stream, and among the trees and 
on each side of the river were numerous tents of Indians, or tepees, or 
wigwams, as you wish to call them. The Indians were there in hun- 
dreds, going about their daily duties, etc. He saw nothing to this, how- 
ever, except a large tribe of Indians. Then this part of the dream 
closed and he was carried over into his own home, into his own bed- 
room, and lying on a little center table near his bed was a copy of the 
Book of Mormon. He saw the book lying there and as he beheld the 
cover of it he saw a light emanating from the book, and it arose about 
twelve inches above the book. There it stood for a second or two and 
then gradually ascended clear into the heavens. He connected the two 
together and the next day he sought the elders. He said : "You did not 
tell me that the Book of Mormon was a history of the American Indians. 
Now I know it is. I know it is a record of God's dealings with those 
people, because he revealed it to me in my dreams last night." 

These experiences, the testimony of President Ivins and of the 
many other brethren who have spoken during this conference, have 
encouraged me in this work, and my knowledge of this truth that we 
are promulgating ; and my desire and my ambition is to do more in the 
future, if God will give me strength, to further his purposes in the 
earth. 

We are working hard in the Northwestern States mission. We 
have a wonderful group of young men and young women. Only two 
weeks ago, Sister Powell, one of our girls twenty years old, and her 
companion were compelled to move their place of residence, and they 
secured a little home not far from where they had been living. When 
they went into the little home they found that the stove and the lights 



124 



X ERA L CONFERENCE 



had to be connected with the gas. Sister Powell telephoned to the gas 
company office for them to send a man up to connect the gas. When the 
man received the call on the other end of the phone he said: "Who is 
talking, please?" She gave her name. "Your house number, please?" 
She gave her number. He said: "Will you tell me the business you 
are engaged in?" She said, "We are 'Mormon' missionaries working 
in the city of Portland." " 'Mormon' missionaries! This is quite pe- 
culiar," he said. "Only yesterday, as 1 have been investigating and 
studying and praying for light, and that God would bless me and lead 
me to the truth, a voice whispered to me and said, the 'Mormons' are 
going to call you up. And here you are calling me up as a member of 
the 'Mormon' Church. I am not going to send a man to connect the 
gas, but I am coming myself." 

My brethren and sisters, my time is up. I am happy to bring you 
the love and greetings of the missionaries of the Northwestern States 
mission, and in the words of the wonderful vision of the Prophet, re- 
corded in the seventy-sixth section of the Doctrine and Covenants, 

"Hear, O ye heavens, and give ear, O earth, and rejoice ye inhabitants 
thereof, for the Lord is God, and beside him there is no Savior.'' 

I bear you this witness, that Jesus is the Christ, that Joseph Smith 
is and was a prophet of God, and that the Book of Mormon is God's 
revealed truth, and I believe a man can get nearer the Lord by reading 
that book than any other book in the world. I believe the missionaries 
today in the Northwestern States mission are nearer God than they 
possibly have been for some time, because they are reading that book 
today. They are praying about it, and God is answering their prayers. 
1 pray that he shall continue to bles^ us. through Jesus Christ. Amen. 



ELDER DON B. COLTON 

Former President of the Uintah Stake of Zion 

My brethren and sisters: While 1 am greatly surprised now, I 
appreciate that President Grant has allowed me to enjoy in peace the 
meetings thus far. jl have listened and have been thrilled with the 
messages of this conference. 

Xot long ago in the city of W ashington I was invited to speak in 
one of the large churches of that city on the question of "What is 
'Mormonism?' " At the close of the talk opportunity was given for the 
asking of questions. One gentleman prefaced his question with re- 
marks about as follows: "At the time of the organization of the Church 
there were many Christian denominations in the world, hundreds of 
them, each trying as best it could. to teach the message of Christ. Your 
Church came as a discordant note, so to speak. You have been the 
cause of much trouble. Peace has been taken from some homes because 
of your message. Those who have joined your Church and lived their 
religion have suffered much persecution. Much dissension and dis- 
cussion have come as a result of it, and your own people have suf- 



ELDER DOS B. COLTON 



125 



fered much in being driven from the east to the west, and have become 
more or less an isolated people. Query: Why 'Mormonism' ? Why 
all of this turmoil and strife? Mas it been worth while?" 

I shall not have time this morning to answer in full that question, 
but I would like to call your attention to two or three of the points 
that I made in answering that gentleman. In the city of Washington, 
a year ago this last winter, the leading daily paper published for many 
weeks articles by the leading authors of the country under the heading, 
"What my religion means to me." I invited this man's attention to 
the fact that in every case except one these authors had said they had 
been compelled, during the course of their lives, to revise their ideas 
of religion ; that they had been taught in the days of their youth that 
the God whom they worshipped was a personal being with a body 
and with limitations. As they went out into the world and began their 
study in the colleges, they discovered that if (there is a God he could not 
be circumscribed with limitations. They saw the evidence upon every 
hand of his power and of his evefywhereness and they were compelled, 
so they said, to change their ideas of the being whom they had wor- 
shipped, and were forced to accept God as a force or as an omnipresent 
power in all the universe. In many cases these authors for a time 
wandered without any religion, but came back to the conviction that 
there is some force, some ipower, some influence, and that power and 
influence they had learned to call God. But they rejected entirely the 
idea of a personal God. This gentleman recalled reading all of these 
articles. Then I said to him, we are told in the scripture, that to know 
God and Jesus Christ whom he has sent is life eternal. 

It is, then, of vital importance, is it not, to know him? The ques- 
tion carries its own answer. To know him is the greatest blessing that 
can come to a human soul. But the question is, how does "Mormon" 
philosophy solve the problem and reconcile the omnipresence of God 
and yet proclaim him a personal being? 

"Mormon" philosophy, ! I say, has given an answer to that question. 
It has said, and does say, that God is a personal being, but that emanat- 
ing from him is a light which fills the immensity of space. The light of 
the sun, the light of the moon, the light of the stars — the light of all 
the heavenly bodies. Radio proves the presence of at least something 
that permeates every known object, no matter how opaque the substance. 
There is found in all the universe a substance, which for lack of a better 
term we call ether, In the 131st section of the Doctrine and Covenants 
it is ( revealed to us that there is no such thing as immaterial matter. 
But all the forces and everything that is in existence (and we know 
that the ether is in existence) is but a finer matter. I am not saying 
what it is. I do not know. It only proves, however, that there is a 
force, a something everywhere, and whether that be the instrument by 
which the Spirit of God, the light that emanates from him, operates 
and fills the immensity of space, perhaps is yet to be discovered. Suf- 
fice it to say that there is such an instrumentality. This is in accordance 
with ^David's description of God, for he said, "If I ascend up into 
heaven, thou art there ; if I make my bed in hell, behold, thou art there. 



126 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



If I take the wings of the morning, and dwell in the uttermost parts 
of the sea; even there shall thy hand lead me. and thy right hand shall 
hold me." 

So "Mormon" philosophy answers the question that has puzzled the 
thinkers of the day, in revealing how God can be a personal God and 
yet be omnipotent. Emanating from him is the light which proceedeth 
forth from the presence of the Father to fill the immensity of space. 
Ancient scriptures abundantly attest the fact that God is a personal 
being, and this is supplemented by the revelations of this day which at 
once answer the question that 'God may be and is a personal being, and 
at the same time his power and presence and influence are felt through- 
out all the length and breadth of the universe. So that "Mormonism" 
has answered one of the great perplexing questions of the day, and 
that alone would justify its existence. 

Another question, and I must be brief: Next to the great and 
important question of finding God is to find out who is man, and to 
that question "Mormon" philosophy has given a definite and reasonable 
answer. No man who thinks can believe anything else than that man is 
a dual being. As we stand by the bier of a loved one, we know that 
something has departed. Evolution, if it were accepted as truth, ex- 
plains only the body. That which we love, that which reasons, that 
which thinks, that which has ambition, that which distinguishes man 
and makes him a little lower than the angels, but much higher than the 
animals of the earth; that which is really man must be explained. So 
far as I have found, after extensive reading and earnest research, 
"Mormon" philosophy alone gives a reason and answer to the question, 
Who and what is man? He is composed of spirit and body which 
make up the soul, or the completed man, and that spirit did not have its 
origin by accident. It was and is the creation of our Father in heaven, 
and the material of which it is made is only finer matter, as explained 
in the 131st section of the Doctrine and Covenants. If it exists it is 
.something and is, therefore, matter. 

I could give you the explanations of Christian thinkers everywhere. 
I am sure if you were to "compare them with our answer and explana- 
tion as to the origin of man you would admit at once that "Mormon" 
philosophy has given an answer, not only consistent with logic, but con- 
sistent with the revealed word of God. We do not believe as Lyman 
Abbott, for instance, said, that it is possible when that first monkey- 
man stood up in the primeval forest, that God breathed into that body 
the soul that we inherit. We do not believe that. Every man has a 
spirit, is himself a child of God, created just as naturally and just as 
much in accordance with the laws of nature as is the body itself. 
We are all God's children. 

And so, in further answer to the question, Why "Mormonism?" Not 
only to reveal God, whom to know its eternal life, but to reveal man, his 
origin, his relationship to Deity, his wonderful mission here and here- 
after. 

Another answer, and an answer that is worth while, given in no 
other philosophy, is the doctrine concerning home. Sometimes it has 



ELDER DON B. COLT ON 



127 



been said by ill-advised people that "Mormonisrn" is not conducive to 
good homes. O, how utterly foreign to the truth is such a thought! 
"Mormon" philosophy has revealed to the earth that home is the 
only unit, when properly /commenced and fully appreciated, that shall 
endure forever, and reveals to man the wonderful relationship that 
does and shall forever exist between man and wife, between father and 
mother, and children, and gives us a picture of what it really is to 
become one in God's great family. No more ennobling truth was ever 
taught to the children of men. 

Now we see why Elijah the prophet should be sent to turn the 
hearts of the fathers to the children and the hearts of the children to 
the fathers, lest the earth be smitten with a curse, for it comprehends 
the binding in one of all the children of our Father into his great 
family. That alone justifies the existence of "Mormonisrn." I want 
to say to you that with all due respect to every other religion of the 
world, I do not believe there is any, other people who look upon the 
sacred relationship of home as we do. We believe that the binding to- 
gether of man and wife, the sealing of the children to their parents 
for eternity, will ultimately bring into one fold all the children of God. 

In brief, then, Why "Miormonism ?" To reveal God, whom to know 
is eternal life. To reveal man — who he is, and what his relationship 
to Deity is, — and to proclaim to him how to organize the one unit — 
home — that shall endure forever. These are some of the reasons, in 
brief, for the establishment of the "Mormon" religion in the midst of the 
other religions of the world. This gospel is the power of God unto 
salvation, the means for salvation, endless joy, endless increase, hap- 
piness and progress forever, worlds without end. 

God help us fully to appreciate the biggest and best thing in all the 
universe, I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER HENRY N. MICKELSEN 

President of the Lost River Stake of TAon 

I feel, my brethren and sisters, somewhat like Paul of old said, 
probably one of the weakest or the least of you. I appreciate more than 
words can express my fellowship and membership in this great work. 

I have not had the privilege as some have had of being born under 
the covenant, but I have had the privilege of studying for myself. There- 
fore, in my mature age, I became a convert to this Church, and I can 
say, as the scriptures say, that the little seed which was sown within me 
has developed and grown. Wherefore we know, if that be the case, 
that we are not in error but are continuing in the light. I, too, with 
the rest of you, in another sense, make the same statement as did Paul : 
"But I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached of me 
is not after man, neither did I receive it of men, but by and through the 
revelations of Jesus Christ." 

That is why we are all here. We have not received this gospel of 



128 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



man. but through the revelations of Jesus Christ. Not perhaps through 
a direct message, hut hy the influence that he has left us. 

I always appreciate hearing someone speak concerning the Book 
of Mormon. That hook is the reason for my standing before you to- 
day. 1 believed it to be the word of the Lord, and in reading it, said 
to my wife: "If the Bible is the word of the Lord, there is no question 
in this world that this book is also the word of the Lord." As the 
Bible is the history of the hand-dealings of the Lord with the people 
on the eastern hemisphere, so the Book of Mormon is a history of his 
dealings with the people on the western hemisphere. One substantiates 
the other, and together they give us a strong testimony. 

1 bear you my testimony that the Doctrine and Covenants and the 
Pearl of Great Price are true and from the Lord. No wonder we gather 
here as a host. No wonder men live and want to live worthy lives that 
they may continue to grow in this great work, that when we have 
finished our mission here we may take with us the intelligence which 
we have gained here. We should, therefore, be thankful to each other 
and continue to work in the Lord's cause, spending our means and liv- 
ing in such a way that our brethren who are not of our faith may see 
our good works and join with us. 

A young woman from New York City made the statement that it 
was foolish for the people in this intermountain country to build such 
a house as we are gathered in, that as far as religious worshipers are 
concerned it would be impossible for those who are residing in this city 
to fill it. And yet here it is filled to overflowing every conference. Why 
is it? It is because we all grow together in this Church. One is not 
greater than the other, only we respect, of course, our brethren who are 
over us in authority. But we grow together, we grow in intelligence, 
and we all take part. That is the reason that we are here today enjoy- 
ing the Spirit of the Lord and the great testimonies that have been borne. 

It is my testimony that this is the work of the Lord, and that it 
will grow, and that we will be exalted in our Father's kingdom if we 
continue faithful and do our bit by taking part in this great organiza- 
tion. May the Lord bless us in our righteous undertakings, is my 
prayer in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER COLEN H. SWEETEN 

President of the Curlew Stake of Zion 

My testimony has been greatly strengthened during this confer 
ence. In listening to the calls of our mission presidents for more mis 
sionaries, I feel very proud of the little stake that I have been asked t 
preside over, for we sense the responsibility of preaching the gospel not 
only to the world, but to the people who live in our stake who may not 
understand the gospel. The small stake that I preside over has but 
1,250 people. A year ago we had eleven long-term missionaries in the 
field. When the call came from President Grant for short-term mis- 
sionaries ten of our brethren volunteered. This is very pleasing to us 
who preside over that stake of Zion. During the last winter we have 



ELDER COLEN H. SWEETEN 



129 



had fourteen long-term missionaries in the field and three short-term, 
missionaries. 

We quite often hear people, who are trying to criticise, say that 
our people are not sincere in their belief. I do not see how any person, 
with a sane mind, can say that, after listening to the report that Elder 
David O. McKay read to us yesterday of the time and money that have 
been spent by the members of this Church, and after knowing, as 1 
know, of the effort our people are putting forth in our little stake to 
preach the gospel to people who do not understand it. I know that we 
are sincere, and I know that the gospel is true. I know that people who 
do not think we are sincere have never been humble enough themselves 
to ask their Father in heaven that they might understand the gospel. 
There is one truth that we cannot get away from, and it is this : We 
cannot understand the gospel without the assistance of our Father in 
heaven. We find in our organizations that wherever those in charge 
attempt to accomplish the work themselves, with their own power, with- 
out asking for the assistance of their Father in heaven, they fail. But 
wherever they are humble and pray for the assistance of our Father 
in heaven, he will always come to their rescue and help finish the 
work they are called to perform. If the people of the world who do 
not understand the gospel, and are always criticising, would get down 
on their knees with a prayerful heart and ask their Father in heaven to 
help them to understand the truth and the beauties of the gospel, I am 
sure that bur heavenly Father would come to their rescue. I know he 
has done this for me, and that he will do it for others. I know that 
the gospel is true, and that by trying to help others in this life we help 
ourselves. We always get more out of the effort of doing our duty 
than we put into it. May the Lord help us to perform our obligations 
here on the earth, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER ALFRED H. BELLISTON 

President of the Juab Stake of Zdon 

President Heber J. Grant recently complimented a gentleman for 
having splendid terminal facilities. That part is not bothering me at 
present. I would like to have a self-starter. Elder Geo. F. Richards, 
in one of the meetings of this conference, said that it required greater 
intelligence to create an idea than it did to find words with which to 
express it. I have an idea that there is truth in that statement. 

I rejoice this morning in being numbered among this people, and 
in having the privilege of rendering service in this great organization, 
the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. It is a most wonder- 
ful organization. It has nurtured me from my infancy. It has pro- 
vided for me all the facilities which I consider essential for my prog- 
ress and development. I am not saying how well I have observed and 
taken advantage of the opportunities that have been afforded, but it has 
always provided a means for the exercise of my ambitions and for my 
development. I thank the Lord that in my teens I became interested in 
the Church and its doctrines and organizations, and received the bene- 



130 



GENERAL CONFEREM E 



fits of its teachings; that early in my young manhood the Lord blessed 
me with wholesome surroundings and gave me the privilege and op- 
portunity of associating with men and women of greater wisdom than 
1 had, who were interested in my life and directed my footsteps in the 
ways of truth ; that it became my privilege to perform a mission to the 
world, and that even before my return from that mission, several 
months, in fact, I was chosen a member of the bishopric of my ward. 
1 have not been out of the harness since. As a representative of the 
third generation in the Church, 1 am happy today to say that the faith 
if still with the family and has not waned in the least from the days of 
my grandfather who embraced the gospel in his native land, England. 

A wonderful organization, I said. It has been an inspiration dur- 
ing this conference, as it has during many others that I have been priv- 
ileged to attend, to witness the great body of men of intelligence, busy 
men, who give their time and their talents for the furtherance of this 
work, and to look into the faces of thousands who have been called to 
positions in this Church to minister for the people and teach them the 
doctrines of Christ, that they may grow in the fear of the Lord. I say 
that it is an inspiration at this moment to see such men as 1 see before 
me. We ,do not seek positions in this Church, but they come to us as a 
rule through faithfulness, and I doubt not that the majority of these 
brethren who are before us, received their appointments with reluctance, 
feeling their incapacity and inability to discharge the duties and re- 
sponsibilities that would rest upon them in serving the people and ad- 
ministering in the various offices to which they have been called. 

As a parent I feel grateful to the Lord that provision has been 
made in the organizations of the Church to supplement the home and 
give proper teachings unto our children in the Sunday schools, in the 
Religion class and other organizations ; that means are provided where- 
by they can be taught the ways of the Lord and be led to fear him and 
keep his commandments. It is wonderful when we contemplate these 
things how kind the Lord has been to us, how merciful he is to us. 

I feel that this work is growing. I wish I could report, as the 
brother before me did, with respect to the missionary work. I think 
it is a wonderful report that he has just given. I felt that we were one 
of the smallest stakes in the Church, but we have nearly three times the 
number of people that the brother who has just spoken has in his stake. 
It is something to be proud of for a stake with so few members to furn- 
ish as many missionaries as he reports has been furnished by his stake. I 
can see how, in the future, that can strengthen the wards in his stake. 
These missionaries coming back to the stake with their experience and 
the zeal that they acquire in the work of the Lord, in their missionary 
efforts, will repay ten-fold for all the sacrifices that are made now 
in sending them abroad. I think that this is one thing in the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints that the world is jealous of, this mis- 
sionary system, the strength it brings to the people. It was said recentlv 
in a convention by a certain man who had heard many from Utah ex- 
press themselves that he wondered how it was that the men from Utah 
when assembled in conventions could express themselves so clearly. This 



ELDER ALFRED H. BELLISTON 



131 



gave the opportunity to explain to this gentleman our missionary sys- 
tem, for practically all of the male members of the Church have the 
privilege in their early manhood of going out and proclaiming the 
gospel, thus developing themselves to become useful and efficient in 
expressing their ideas and views on different questions pertaining to 
civil life. I am proud today to be numbered among this people, and to 
have the pleasure of serving them in our stake. I trust that we may 
grow and be united in our effort to serve the Lord and accomplish his 
purposes. 

May God add his blessings unto all of us, that we may do our duty 
faithfully, I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER STEPHEN L. CHIPMAN 

President of the Alpine Stake, Recently Returned from a Short-Term 

Mission in California 

In the fall of 1925, when President Grant announced that he 
desired men of experience to proclaim the gospel to the world, I was 
sitting by my counselor, President Clark, and I suggested to him : 
''There is an opportunity for you." He answered : "You have 
my consent." I thought that if I had his consent and could get 
the consent of the President, I should be delighted to go into the world 
and proclaim the gospel to the best of my ability. The President told 
me that if I could arrange' my affairs he would be delighted to have 
me go, and I responded to the call. I landed in San Francisco on the 
4th day of January. I did not go in the fall, on account of the business 
interests that- needed to be adjusted before I left. I labored in San 
Francisco but a very short time, and then was called to labor in Oak- 
land. From Oakland I was called to labor in San Jose, and at the first 
conference we held there, President Joseph W. McMurrin being present, 
I asked him if he had any objections to my asking the bishops in our 
stake to recommend missionaries to come down there and assist me 
in the work. He said he had none whatever ; if the bishops would 
recommend them, he thought it could be arranged. I am delighted to 
announce to the brethren and sisters present that we ' had twenty 
missionaries from the Alpine stake, laboring in the San Jose conference, 
while I was there. I was somewhat selfish in the matter, because I 
realized, being president of the stake, that when those missionaries re- 
turned they would strengthen us very materially, and besides it would 
do them good and it would do good to the people of the world. 

After I had labored in the mission field six months I was not 
satisfied. I liked the work so well that I asked permission to remain 
longer, and I did so with consent. I enjoyed my labors immensely. It 
was the joy of my life. Most of you are aware that later on we were 
overtaken in an accident, where eight of our missionaries were hit by an 
automobile, seven of whom were knocked down and five had to be 
taken to the hospital. I want to say that at the hospital we received 
very fine treatment from the doctors, the nurses and the attendants. 
They were all good to us, and during our stay with them the mission- 



132 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



aries taught the gospel to the people in the hospital. While we were 
sick we spoke of the Book of Mormon to them, and succeeded in placing 
twenty-five copies of that book among the nurses, the doctors, and 
the chief nurse of the hospital. We talked of the gospel to every nurse 
that waited upon us, and I think that some good will come out of this 
serious accident. I cannot understand why such an accident should 
have happened to a group of missionaries, choice, pure-minded, in- 
dustrious young people, who were willing to labor in the service of the 
Lord. I do not suppose that the Saints in early days in Missouri under- 
stood -Why it was that persecutions were heaped upon them. I 
suppose that the relatives of John the Baptist could not understand why 
he had to go to prison and was finally beheaded. I do not suppose 
that the Saints in ancient days understood why Paul and Silas should 
be imprisoned, and why Paul should be shipwrecked and beaten with 
many stripes a number of times. I do not understand these things, 
but I do know that the Lord is at the helm, and is able to sanctify 
all these conditions to the good of his people. When I regained con- 
sciousness at the hospital (I was unconscious for two or three hours), 
and found the doctors sewing up my head, and discovered what had 
happened, to me, it seemed to me that I was hurt everywhere from 
head to foot. I had two gashes in my head, my face was all skinned 
up, my lips were skinned, my hands and my side also, and there was a 
gash in one leg, and the other leg was broken. Well, it hit every 
place about me but the most prominent part, and that was my stomach. 

I revisited the hospital to find out how the nurses were getting 
a-long with the Book of Mormon. We found them interested and 
reading the Book. Among the nurses was a Chinese, girl who could 
speak English, and who claimed that she was a Christian. I induced her 
to take the Book of Mormon and read it. She said she had a brother 
who was a Ph. D. at the Lick Observatory, at Mount Hamilton. I 
made a trip up to Mount Hamilton and had the opportunity of talking 
to him and getting acquainted with him. I told him I knew his sister. 
I left him my card and the Articles of Faith, and told him who I was. 

I appreciated the opportunity of laboring in the mission field 
and am glad to return. California has good roads, and many flowers, 
although they are not so fragrant as Utah flowers. They have good 
fruit, but I do not think the flavor is quite so good as is the flavor 
of our fruit at home. I think the people at home are as beautiful as 
the people of California, but we find some fine people in California, 
splendid, sincere people. As a result of the accident we had many 
friends raised up to us, Catholic and Protestant, who entertained us 
and welcomed us into their homes, and had radio programs and regep- 
tions for us, and this gave us the opportunity of preaching the gospel 
to them. • 

I do not feel to regret the accident very much. I am hardly well 
yet, but I believe that I will get better, and all of the others who were 
hurt in the accident are better. The young lady who had to be in the 
hospital so long with her head crushed is well again. The doctors 
in California said to me: "There is no hope for her." I said: "Now

doctor, I have not felt that way, I believe she will get better." I had 
not seen the girl, and when they wanted to take me in to show her to 
me before she left there, I told them I did not want to see her on account 
of the condition of her face. She weighs twenty-four pounds more now 
than she did when she went into the mission field, and she looks more 
beautiful. She is restored, and you cannot see a scar or anything upon 
her face. It is wonderful. When the doctor was waiting upon me 
for my foot upon one occasion, he remarked to my good wife who was 
present: "That is one time when the guardian angels did not have 
charge of you." My wife said: ■ "Doctor, you are mistaken, that is 
the very time when they did have charge of us, and they saved every 
one of us." It would have been an easy matter for every one of the 
party to' have been killed, but the Lord preserved our lives, and I hope 
that those who are injured, and their parents and friends, will ap- 
preciate the kindness of the Lord in the preservation of our lives. 

I pray the Lord to bless us here at home, that we may set an 
example to the world that will help us, and help them. 

The only criticism I received while I was away was upon one 
occasion when speaking on the street corner. A man stepped up to me, 
after the meeting, and said: "Your talk was fine, but your people 
do not live according to what you are teaching) here tonight." I was 
speaking on the fruits of "Mormonism." I said to him: "Well, in 
what way?" He said that he had lived in Idaho, and that our people 
did not live up to their professions. I said : "I suppose there are 
some members of the Church who do not live up to all they should," 
but, I said, "the Savior himself got one bad one out of twelve, and it is 
just possible that the gospel net may gather in some, in these days, who 
are not as. they should be." That seemed to satisfy him. 

I want to say that we met hundreds of people who had been on the 
Temple Block, and who have visited the Bureau of Information, and I 
have yet the first individual to meet who has been heard to criticize or 
be unkind to us in our visits among them. In every instance they com- 
mended the splendid treatment they received here on the Temple Block 
and at the Bureau of Information. It is a wonderful missionary arrange- 
ment for the preaching of the gospel to the people of the world and pre- 
paring them to receive the elders. May God bless them, each and every 
one. Bless these brethren who preside that we may uphold their hands 
and stand by them in this glorious work of the Lord, I humbly pray, in 
the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

We have received telegrams from different sections announcing 
that people in Idaho and other places are listening in by radio to the 
proceedings of the conference. 

The choir and congregation sang the hymn, "How firm a founda- 
tion, ye Saints of the Lord." 

The closing prayer was offered by Elder Heber Austin. 

Conference adjourned until Wednesday, 10 o'clock a. m., April 
6, 1927. 



FOURTH DAY 



MORNING MEETING 

On Wednesday morning, April 6, 1927, at 10 o'clock, the con- 
ference reconvened, with President Heber J. Grant presiding. 

The choir and congregation sang, "We thank thee, O God, for a 
prophet." 

The opening prayer was offered by Elder Heber Q. Hale, president 
of the Boise stake of Zion. 

A mixed quartette sang, "An angel from on high." 

ELDER SYLVESTER Q. CANNON 

Presiding Bishop of the Church 

I sense the responsibility, my brethren and sisters and friends, v of 
occupying this position. I desire that I may have your faith, that 
I may be inspired to say those things that shall be profitable to all of 
us, I rejoice greatly in the testimonies and the instructions that have 
been given to us during this conference. I am sure they are calculated 
for the welfare, growth and development of the Latter-day Saints. 

When the Lord Jesus Christ was upon the earth, and was teach- 
ing men the principles of life and truth, there were some who followed 
him, as we have heard, from among whom he selected his Twelve 
Apostles. But a time came when the question was asked whether or 
not they would continue to follow him, and Peter responded : ""Whither 
shall we go, Lord, if we leave thee?" Where could they go to find any- 
thing to compare with that which he had presented unto them? I am 
reminded of the remark made by the Savior to some other followers of 
his. I would like to read a few words : 

"Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him. If ye 
continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed : 

"And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free. 

"They answered him, We be Abraham's seed, and were never in 
bondage to any man: how sayest thou, Ye shall be made free? 

"Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whosoever 
committeth sin is the servant of sin." 

At a later time, when Jesus was about to be crucified, he was 
before Pilate, the Roman Governor, and Pilate asked him some ques- 
tions, and, besides others, if he were a king. Jesus said : 

"Thou sayest that I am a king. To this end was I born, and for 
this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the 
truth. Every one that lis of the truth heareth my voice." 

Pilate said to him, "What is truth?" 

In the year 1837, when Heber C. Kimball and others of the 
apostles and elders were sent to England for the opening of the door of 
the gospel in that land, after arriving in Liverpool they traveled on to 



ELDER SYLVESTER Q. < CANNON 



135 



Preston, as 1 remember it, and as they alighted from the coach, or the 
stage, at that place, they saw a banner before them, erected as a part 
of the celebration in honor of Queen Victoria, and on that banner 
the words, "Truth Will Prevail." These brethren were encouraged 
by the words on that banner. They proceeded diligently and faith- 
fully in the prosecution of the work that they were called to perform ; 
and the harvest which was reaped through the power and influence of 
the holy Spirit as a result of their labors was wonderful. 

What is truth? We are told that it is the knowledge of things that 
have been, that are. and that are to be. The Latter-day Saints have 
accepted this gospel which we understand to be the truth. When the 
missionaries go out into the world to preach the gospel, they present 
these things which they declare have come from the Lord ; and those to 
whom the message comes are invited to investigate carefully, to compare 
these things with those which were declared by Jesus and by his apos- 
tles, and with those things that are contained in the scriptures from the 
very beginning. 

In every instance those who have accepted this message, after care- 
ful comparison and investigation, have become convinced that these 
principles are true, that the ordinances of the gospel conform exactly 
to those which were taught by the Savior and his apostles .in the previous 
dispensations, and that the restoration of the gospel, as declared by the 
Latter-day Saints, is true. So we have come to accept these principles 
as being the truth, the everlasting truth. In other words, the gospel 
is "the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth." The Latter- 
day Saints have been taught and have appreciated the fact that where- 
ever truth is to be found it is a part of the gospel. It is for our welfare, 
our blessing, and our development. 

In the world today there are many things that are in the nature 
of theories. The scientific method of investigation is to experiment, 
to establish a hypothesis or a theory and then to endeavor to prove 
whether or not that theory is correct. There are many theories in the 
world that some people accept as truth, and yet they are in a status of 
uncertainty. But things that are definitely and positively proved to be 
true are and should be accepted and lived up to. There are divine 
truths which are for the eternal welfare of men, and those divine truths 
are included and comprehended in the gospel of Jesus Christ. If men 
and women accept the truth, that is, the true gospel of Jesus Christ, 
then they shall be made free, — free from sin, from transgression, from 
superstition, and from all of those things that hinder men's progress. 

I believe, that the gospel of Jesus Christ as restored in this latter 
day, in its purity and fulness, could not have been established and carried 
forward as it has been done in any other land than in this land of 
liberty. I am sure that the Lord had in his purposes the establishment 
of this land of liberty that the gospel might be restored here and go 
forth to all other lands, that men might hear it and, so far as they 
love truth, accept it. But even in this land there has been, and is to 
some extent today — fortunately not nearly so much as there was 



136 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



formerly — a spirit of prejudice, of superstition and sometimes even of 
persecution against those who have accepted the truth. 

When the Latter-day Saints received the message which came 
through the Prophet Joseph Smith, and undertook to live it, they 
were persecuted in those early days. I was recently reading a report 
of the Rochester Historical Society of New York, telling of the be- 
ginnings of "Mormonism ;" and in that story, even today, they rehash 
old fables and falsehoods that were told against the Prophet Joseph 
Smith and other leaders of the Church in those early days. Even 
now they are continuing to spread misrepresentation by repeating those 
things which were used in a prejudicial way against the early Church 
leaders. Well, the Church, organized in New York state, moved west- 
ward, because the destiny of this work was westward. They estab- 
lished themselves at Kirtland, and they had difficulty there because 
of persecution and objection to the truth. 

The Latter-day Saints have always undertaken to maintain a spirit 
of kindness and patience, endeavoring to promulgate the truth because 
they love it, and because they recognize it as a pearl of great price. 
Yet many people who ought to be willing to accept the gospel and 
receive the benefits and blessings which come from it, have opposed 
it and have undertaken to persecute those who? have accepted it. The 
result was that in Kirtland there came a time when there were very 
dark days for the Church. There were those who, because of persecu- 
tion, could not stand, nor retain their love of the truth. They were 
affected more by the persecution of men, and they fell away from the 
truth. This did not change or alter the truth itself, but it did affect 
their standing and blessings which they would have been entitled 
to receive if they had retained their courage and faith in the gospel. 

So the people moved again westward to Missouri — -the place that 
the Lord had designated as the center stake — and there they undertook 
to live the gospel. It is true that they had some failings and weaknesses, 
but nothing to compare with the men who persecuted them. It was be- 
cause they were a strange people — -a peculiar people — who undertook to 
carry the gospel of Jesus Christ, the truth, into their every-day lives that 
they were persecuted and driven. There came a time when conditions in 
the Church apparently were in a very desperate status, because of the 
terrible persecutions. Joseph Smith and other leaders of the Church 
were imprisoned, and their very lives were in danger. The people were 
driven and persecuted in every way and some were massacred. Brig- 
ham Young and others who were not imprisoned were doing everything 
in their power to remove the Saints from Missouri, and to find a rest- 
ing place for them. There were those among them who could not retain 
the truth, whereby they could be free, and endure persecution and trial 
and trouble. 

Finally the Saints were established in Illinois, and there they built 
a beautiful city — the finest city in the state of Illinois. They estab- 
lished a wonderful community. Then again persecution followed, and 
those who ought to have been able to acknowledge and understand the 
truth of the gospel were the ones who were bitterly persecuting and 



ELDER SYLVESTER Q. CANNON 



137 



opposing this work. So, after all that effort, the leaders of the Church, 
Joseph and Hyrum Smith, were cruelly martyred, and others of the 
authorities of the Church were in danger of their lives, and the people 
themselves were finally driven out again and had to find another rest- 
ing place. 

So they came westward to this land. There were those, even then, 
who could not retain the truth, who could not continue in faith, who 
could not appreciate the fact that this gospel is the means whereby they 
could be free and overcome the bondage of sin, transgression, supersti- 
tion and those other things which are the result of the error that is 
abroad in the world. The Latter-day Saints who still retained and lived 
the truth came to this land, established themselves and began anew to 
built a community, where they could live in faith, unity and love, and 
promulgate the gospel abroad. Notwithstanding these different crises 
that have occurred, the work has gone steadily forward. After they had 
become established here these opposed to the truth were not satisfied. 
Because of the fact that they were growing, that the truth was becom- 
ing established and was prevailing, persecution began again later on and 
continued for a time. 

There have been, therefore, at various periods in the history of this 
people the various tests that have come to the Latter-day Saints to prove 
their devotion to the truth, and their willingness to maintain it. The 
gospel of Jesus Christ remains the truth. It is, as stated, the whole 
truth, it is divine truth, it is the will of the Lord. When the Lord speaks 
to man, through his prophets, as he has done, as recorded in the scrip- 
ture, it becomes his word and his will ; it becomes scripture ; it becomes 
the truth to mankind. While social and political conditions may vary 
at different periods of the world's history, the fundamental truths of 
the gospel remain. Those precepts that are essential to man's salvation 
endure. So these necessary principles of the gospel, restored in these 
days, remain as fundamental truths. They are unchangeable and in- 
variable. 

The Latter-day Saints who have been loyal have accepted and re- 
tained these principles, and they will always retain them, for they are 
true. There may be those who will fall away from the truth, whether 
it be as a result of persecution or whether it be because of the pleasures 
of the world. Whether it be the luxuries or the wealth that comes to 
men, there are those who cannot endure the conditions necessary to ob- 
serve the plain, simple, divine truths which make for salvation and for 
the blessing of' mankind. But their failure does not alter the truth, nor 
stay its progress. 

Fortunately, at the present time, there is very little persecution of 
the Latter-day Saints anywhere; but there are influences of the world 
among us in this community, and, in fact, influences in the world every- 
where, that tend to draw men and women away from the truths of the 
gospel of Christ. We recognize the fact that while the Latter-day Saints 
claim to possess the gospel of Jesus Christ in its fulness, and are en- 
deavoring to live in accordance therewith, there are many other people 
in the world who are living in accordance with principles of truth that 



138 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



form a part of the gospel. These are essential for the welfare, growth 
and development of mankind, in the promotion of ideals and the prac- 
tices that shall enahle them to accomplish the greatest good in life, and 
at the same time prepare themselves for eternity. 

There are, however, efforts and influences abroad in the <world 
which tend to draw people away from the truth, and from these prin- 
ciples which make for growth and development. Such influences are 
at work among us here. There is a growing" tendency toward a spirit 
of vulgarity, of profanity, and of obscenity, that is most disgusting in 
its nature. If we go, for instance, to the theatres today, we find the use 
of profanity, — the taking of the name of the Lord in vain — a most 
common and offensive practice. It is also noticeable in many of the 
magazines that are widely circulated. Also, the jokes, stories and 
actions on the stage, and in magazines, are, in too many instances, so 
vulgar and even obscene as to be revolting, to say the least. They are 
having their influence upon many people, particularly the young people. 
So, these deceptive efforts are abroad, and their purpose undeniably is 
to draw boys and girls, and men and women, away from the truth. 

My brethren and sisters, and especially my brethren who bear 
the Priesthood, who carry responsibility as presidencies of stakes, as 
bishoprics of wards, and all who have received this Priesthood, our 
responsibility and our opportunity — and also primarily the responsibility 
of fathers and mothers — is to endeavor to teach our children to restrain 
themselves in those thoughts, practices or habits that will tend to de- 
generate them, or tend to reduce their will-power, or their mastery of 
themselves. It is our business to train them, and forewarn them that 
if such habits are cultivated, or if they are allowed to grow in their 
minds, or any other habits of like character, they will tend to lead them 
away from this everlasting truth. 

I pray that the Lord may bless every one of us, that we may recog- 
nize these signs and these dangers. We realize that there are influences 
abroad that are just as insidious, just as dangerous for the maintenance 
of the standing and the faith of the Latter-day Saints as there were in 
the days when persecution prevailed. At the same time, we as a people 
should recognize the great heritage that has come to us from, our fathers 
through their stability, of faith, devotion, and love of the truth ; and 
measure up to that responsibility by training our children and those 
under our care, through example and good counsel, to resist these habits 
and tendencies that will lead them away from the truth and into 
error, and cause them sadness and sorrow. The gospel is a great 
ideal, a great set of principles, that makes for growth and development, 
for happiness and peace. It will prevail and triumph, whether or not 
any of us, individually, shall be able to endure in faith. 

May the Lord help and bless us that we may measure up to these 
opportunities and responsibilities, that we may be able to stem this tide 
and these influences that are abroad, to maintain those plain and simple 
standards of truth and of righteousness that shall make for happiness, 
peace, joy, and finally for salvation, I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 



ELDER CHARLES H. HART

ELDER CHARLES H. HART 

Of the First Council of Seventy and President of the Canadian Mission 

As announced in this conference, I have been called to preside over 
the Canadian mission. The call came to me at the close of a busy 
day on February 3, and on February 14 I was on my journey to that his- 
toric field, opened nearly ninety-five years ago by Joseph Young, the 
father of our late and beloved Seymour B. Young. I thought it was 
an appropriate thing to have a Seventy called to that field, opened 
by the man who was the first Seventy and the first president of Seventy 
in this dispensation. He was accompanied by Phinehas H. Young, 
Elial Strong and Eleazer Miller. In six weeks' time they had raised 
up a branch of the Church at Ernesttown, Ontario. 

The Reverend Harry Emerson Fosdick, who has been referred to 
in this conference, has just issued a book bearing date August, 1926, 
called Adventurous Religion. By that he means the same spirit and 
zeal and adventurous living that characterized the introduction of the 
gospel in the days of the Savior. He characterizes the incidents con- 
nected with Paul's ministry as "the most influential uprush of spiritual 
power in human history ;" that "Christianity began in a great adventure" 
and that "the life to which Jesus summoned men required insight and 
bravery to undertake, and fortitude to continue." If the Reverend Fos- 
dick would know of adventurous religion in this age, he need only 
consult the history of the Canadian mission. 

Elder Brigham Young made his way to Canada, in December, 
1832, wading through deep snow and crossing the lake when the ice 
was so thin that it bent under the weight of him and his companion, 
who could not walk together, the water above the ice wetting their 
shoes. He and his brother Joseph Young raised up a branch in West 
Loughborough, after baptizing forty-five souls. Elder Brigham Young, 
in July, 1833, returned to Kirtland, Ohio, accompanied by some twenty 
or thiry new converts. That was followed by the labors of Elder 
Orson Pratt. In fact, Elder Pratt thought he was the first in this 
dispensation to preach the gospel in Canada. He was followed by 
Elder Parley P. Pratt, in 1836, and what wonderful fruits these men 
had in the ministry. John Taylor was providentially found in the 
city of Toronto, and afterwards, as you know, he became president of 
the Church. I am a little ahead of my story, chronologically. I should 
record the fact that Presidents Joseph Smith and Sidney Rigdon preach- 
ed in this historic -field. Old father Nickerson and his wife, of Mount 
Pleasant, Ontario, drove to Kirtland and brought the Prophet Joseph and 
Sidney Rigdon to Mount Pleasant. There is a graphic account of this 
visit, by Lydia Knight (whose maiden name was Lydia Bailey) in her 
History, on pages 14 to 23. Lawyers abbreviate by using exhibits. 
May we refer to these pages as an exhibit to be read as an example of 
"adventurous religion." 

Someone has suggested that Canada is really entitled to much 
credit in opening up the British mission, because four of the converts 



140 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



in Canada accompanied Elders Heber C. Kimball, Willard'Richards and 
Orson Hyde to the British mission, referred to today. One of those 
persons was Joseph Fielding, the brother of Mary and Mercy Fielding. 

From this early work we can get some insight into what the Lord 
no doubt meant in telling Joseph Smith to "be not weary in well doing ;" 
that "from things that are small proceedeth that which is great;" that 
souls are precious in the sight of God, and if it be that' "one spends 
all his days in bringing save it be one soul into the fold, how great 
shall be his joy with him in the kingdom of my Father." Mary Field- 
ing now stands at the head of a posterity numbering several hundred, 
representing, as it were, a great cone of righteous humanity with the 
apex pointing to Mary Fielding Smith, the wife of the Patriarch, 
and with a base ever widening as the years come and go. 

I had a glorious experience in this mission, in "swinging around 
the circuit," touching the great cities of Hamilton, London, Toronto, 
headquarters of the mission; Ottawa, where the Dominion Parliament 
was in session, the great city of Montreal; Halifax, in Nova Scotia; 
the old city of St. John, New Brunswick ; and the cities of Bangor 
and Portland, Maine, and back again to headquarters. 

While at Toronto a friend entertaining us for dinner, with evident 
pride, showed me a copy of the new Catholic Encyclopedia. He him- 
self had studied for the Catholic ministry, but was still connected with 
a protestant church. He explained to me that this edition of the Cath- 
olic Encyclopedia had been sponsored by the Knights of Columbus. He 
called my attention to an article under the heading of "Mormons." 
Hastily glancing through it, I was agreeably surprised at the fair treat- 
ment of the subject throughout, with the exception of two or three 
sentences. One sentence is very closely connected with the important 
event of the erection and dedication the other day of a monument to 
the Three Witnesses to the Book of Mormon. In the edition of the 
Encyclopedia mentioned there is a statement that the Three Witnesses, 
whom we honor now by a beautiful little monument upon these grounds, 
had denied their testimony. I did not take a copy of the exact words 
of the later edition, but the earlier edition, the one copyrighted in 1911, 
uses this language: 

"In renouncing 'Mormonism' subsequently, Cowdery, Whitmer and 
Harris, the three principal witnesses, declared this testimony false." 

I am sure that the Knights of Columbus, if responsible for this 
error, will be pleased to correct it when their attention is called to it. 
because the statement is contrary to the facts. My father, James 
H. Hart, interviewed David Whitmer, in 1883. The interview was re- 
duced to the form of verse, afterwards read and approved by David 
Whitmer. It was published in the October, 1883, number of the Con- 
tributor, vol. 5, pages 9 and 10, to which I again make a reference for 
the sake of brevity. 

David Whitmer said: 

"My written statement I have ne'er denied. 
I saw the angel, and I heard his voice 
And wondrous things, that made my heart rejoice." 



ELDER CHARLES .H. HART 



141 



After giving an account of the visitation to him of the angel, 
he said : 

"If this be not the truth, there is no truth, 
And I have been mistaken from my youth ; 
If I'm mistaken, you may know from thence, 
That there's no God, no law, no life, no sense. 

"I know there is a God — I've heard his voice, 
And in his power and truth do still rejoice; 
Though fools may ridicule and laugh today, 
They shall know the truth of what I say." 

"I've suffered persecution at the hands 
Of hireling preachers, and their Christian bands ; 
I've braved their hatred, and have them withstood 
While thirsting for the youthful Prophet's blood. 

"They came, four hundred strong, with visage bold 
And said, 'Deny this story you have told ; 
And by our sacred honor, we'll engage 
To save you from the mob's infuriate rage.' 

"A mighty power came on me, and I spake 
In words that made the guilty mobbers quake ; 
And trembling seized the surging crowd, and fear ; 
But left unharmed, I felt that God was near." 

Had he been disposed to deny his testimony, a good time would 
have been when the mob came. 

I would also like to refer to an affidavit dictated by Charles M. 
Nielsen, formerly a city judge of this city, of a court room testimony of 
Oliver Cowdery. Again, I shall refer to this as an exhibit, to be read 
by you later when the same may be published. It is a court scene in 
Michigan, with Oliver Cowdery prosecuting a murder case. The at- 
torney for the defense said in a very sarcastic manner : 

"I hope, Mr. Cowdery, that when you are going to reply to my argument to 
the jury that you will tell us something about the angel who came down in his 
night clothes while you and Joe Smith were digging golden plates out of the 
Cumorah hill, by which you have deluded so many thousands of our countrymen, 
by deceiving them in regard to the coming forth of a certain book callied the 
Book of Mormon." 



The narrative continues: 

"Finally Oliver Cowdery's turn came to reply. I shall never forget how his 
face looked, no matter how long I shall live. He was as calm as a summer 
morning. There was no anger in his face or in his words. In addressing the 
court and the jury he said: ' 

" 'Oh, I do wish that I could escape replying to the challenge of my brother 
attorney representing the defendant in this case, but I can not. I dare not. The 
angel that appeared to us was not a dream. It was not in the night time. It 
was in the day time while the sun was shining brightly on a clear beautiful day. 
We were praying in turn as we were kneeling on the ground and while in the 
attitude of prayer, a brilliant light surrounded us, the glory of which I can not 
describe. It even surpassed the brilliancy of the sun. A beautiful personage 
stood before us, about two feet from the ground, and he told us that his nam.' 
was Moroni, and he declared to us that the Book of Mormon had been translated 



142 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

by the gift and power of God, and he commanded us to bear witness of the fact, 
and he said, 'If you ever deny what you have seen and heard here from me to- 
day, there is no forgiveness for you in this life nor in the life to come.' " 

There are other interesting matters contained in this affidavit that 
you may read at your leisure; also, another affidavit now being- pre- 
pared at my suggestion by Elder William H. Homer, who interviewed 
Martin Harris in the Kirtland Temple and heard his dying declaration, 
and that is the point that I am coming to — the force of a dying declara.- 
tion. 

As President Joseph Quinney, Jr., and I passed through the town 
of Bellville, Ontario, there was on trial before Judge Logie a murder 
case in which the prosecuting attorney presented an ante-mortem state- 
ment, a dying declaration, by one Charles St. Charles, a court bailiff 
who had been shot down. The principal testimony for the Crown 
was a dying declaration of Mr. St. Charles. The jury, after hearing 
the evidence, and being instructed by the court as to the weight that 
should be attached to a dying declaration, brought in a verdict of not 
guilty, and then a very unusual thing occurred. The judge evidently 
thought that the jury had disregarded the instructions of the court or the 
argument of counsel for the Crown as to the weight of a dying declara- 
tion, and rebuked the jury by telling the defendant that he might as easily 
have been convicted as acquitted upon the testimony taken, and that 
the court was not satisfied with the verdict and would report the case 
further. The English press in its conservative way criticized the 
judge for his invasion of the rights of the jury, but it indicated the 
weight he thought was attached very properly to a dying declaration 
under British law, a rule so strong in the law that judges in the states 
follow this rule, notwithstanding the sixth amendment to the Constitu- 
tion of the United States, which guarantees to every man the right to 
be confronted by the witnesses against him. The force of a dying state- 
ment was understood in the time of Shakespeare, as indicated in his 
play of "King John," where one Melum, on his death bed, gives evi- 
dence of the contemplated treachery of Louis, a French lord. When 
not believed Melum exclaims : 

"Have I not hideous death before my view, 
Retaining but a quantity of life, 
Which bleeds away even as a form of wax 
Resolveth from the figure 'gainst the fire? 
What in the world should make me now deceive, 
Since I must lose the use of .all deceit? 
Why should I then be false, 
Since it is true that I must die here, 
And live hence by truth?" 

The underlying strength of a dying declaration is given by jurists 
of the Supreme Court of one of our American states as follows : 

'When dissolution is approaching and the dying man has lost all hope of 
life, and the shadows of the grave are gathering in around him' and his mind is 
impressed with the full sense of his condition, the solemnity of the season and 
hour gives to his statement a sanctity of truth more impressive and potential 
than the formalities of an oath," etc. 



ELDER CHARLES H. HART

I might say that the testimony of each of these three men had 
the weight of a dying declaration, as you may plainly know from the 
documents outstanding on that question. David Whitmer, in a dying 
declaration, as well as these other men, affirmed the truth of those 
statements ; so that it is not true that they denied the testimony that 
is attributed to them in the Book of Mormon, and which is now per- 
petuated, not only in the hearts of the people, but in bronze upon this 
monument. I rejoice that our brethren were led to erect a monument 
to that very important fact in the history of the Church. 

While at Toronto, I had an opportunity of going forward with a little 
commission that President Joseph F. Smith laid upon me, sometime be- 
fore his death, of following up a discovery in that neighborhood — the dis- 
covery of what is called a "Stone Cist," somewhat like the one in which 
the sacred plates were found by Joseph Smith. The following is from 
the Records of the Past, the March and April numbers, 1909, pp. 75 
and 76. 

Discovery of stone Cist in Ontario : On the farm of T. M. Edmundson, near 
Streetsville, in Peel county, (about 22 miles west of Toronto) in the fall of 
1906. It had slabs of stone for sides and ends, a clay floor and no cap stones, 
but these may have been removed in cultivation years ago, without discovering 
the side slabs which were on level with the ground: 7 feet x 1 ft. x 4 x / 2 feet 
deep. Stone cists have been found in Tennessee, Illinois, at points on the Dela- 
ware river and in northern New Mexico."' 

1 found some people by that name but have not yet found Mr. 
T. M. Edmundson, but I hope to do so. 

We had a joyful time in meeting with the seventy-five fine young 
brethren and sisters who are missionaries in that field. I did not put 
in my application, as there are some points connected with a mission 
presidency that I am not versed in to begin with, but I would like to 
put in my application now for at least one stake president in each one 
of the eight districts, so that they may be inclined to follow the example 
of President Chipman of Alpine stake in having a score of their stake 
' workers join them, and then we will be pretty well equipped. We 
would also like to have a powerful broadcasting station somewhere 
within the radius of our mission field, and also a moving picture 
equipment. It is really a slow process to hunt for men in the mission 
where you have to persuade them to come to our meetings and then 
have so few of them there. We had good meetings throughout, but 
light attendance. 

I rejoice in this labor, my brethren and sisters. These young 
men and young women are going forward with zeal in this work of 
an "adventurous religion." If time permitted we might tell of examples 
from the experiences formerly and today in this mission, matching 
those in the ministry in the days of Paul. The Canadian missionaries 
have all pledged their loyalty and support to this cause. They are 
going forward in response to the commission given, as recorded in the 
1st section of the Doctrine and Covenants : 

"Hearken. O ye people of my church, saith the voice of him who dwells on 



144 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



high, and whose eyes are upon all men; yea, verily I say: Hearken, ye people 
from afar ; and ye that are upon the islands of the sea, listen together. 

"For verily the voice of the Lord is unto all men, and there is none to escape ; 
and there is no eye that shall not see, neither ear that shall not hear, neither 
heart that shall not be penetrated. * * * 

"And the voice of warning shall be unto all people, by the mouths of my 
disciples, whom I have chosen in these last days. 

"And they shall go forth and none shall stay them." 

And in that same section is a dignified presentation of the view 
of ^he Lord in reference to this Church, and it may well be read in 
contrast with the indictment published in the Atlantic Monthly 
for March, 1927, and referred to in the Literary Digest heretofore 
mentioned in this conference. Read that scathing indictment, which 
probably cannot be maintained upon all counts in connection with the 
dignified statement of the Lord through the Prophet Joseph, in section 
one, verse 30 upon which we can, and do, and must stand : 

"And also those to whom these commandments were given, might 
have power to lay the foundation of this Church, and to bring it forth 
out of obscurity and out of darkness, the only true and living Church 
upon the face of the whole earth, with which I, the Lord, am well 
pleased, speaking unto the Church collectively and not individually" — 
a distinction which should always be observed upon our part and the 
part of others. 

Now if I may conclude in the language of that same section : 
"For behold, and lo, the Lord is God, and the Spirit beareth record, 
and the record is true, and the truth abideth forever and ever ;" and that 
is my testimony in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER HENRY H. ROLAPP 

President of the Eastern States Mission 

My brethren and sisters: I believe this is the third time in my 
life that I have occupied a position of this kind in the Tabernacle in 
Salt Lake City. I have been on the General Board of the Sunday 
school for nearly twenty years, and twice I have spoken in the 
Tabernacle on behalf of that organization. This is the first time that 
I have been called upon to speak in. general conference. I know, of 
course, that it is because I have been called to preside over the Eastern 
States mission that the President has been kind enough to give me this 
privilege. 

I rejoice in the opportunity of preaching the gospel of Christ. 
I was converted in the old country, fifty years ago, next December. 
As a young man I felt very enthusiastic about the gospel of Christ. 
I can't remember the time, since then, when I have not had a testimony 
of the gospel of Jesus Christ. I have been called into many dif- 
ferent positions, civil, political, and otherwise, but I have always 
been blessed by the Lord with a knowledge that the gospel of Christ, 
as it was restored through the Prophet Joseph Smith, is true, and is 
that which ought to be preached to the world. 



ELDER HENRY H. ROLAPP 



145 



To the extent of my small ability, I shall go into the world and 
tell the story of "Mbrmonism." I shall keep on telling it until some- 
one will believe it and join the Church. 

As I think of the Church that Christ himself established, at the 
age that we have attained, ninety-seven years, and remember that the 
apostles were not even permitted to preach the gospel as we have the 
right to preach it, I am glad of the change in conditions. When a 
person in those days opened his mputh about the gospel that the Master 
had proclaimed, he took his life into his hands. As I have sat here and 
listened to all these men, these leaders of the Church, telling us of the 
principles of the gospel, and giving us encouragement in going on with 
the work, I have recognized how much greater is our opportunity 
for securing salvation, for securing a knowledge of the principles of 
the gospel, than was given unto those who lived in the days of the 
Master. Rome was the big city when that privilege finally came, three 
hundred or more years after the birth of Christ. It was Rome, a city 
that was amongst the Gentiles ; it was Rome that was regarded as the 
big Christian center. Today the Church of Christ, the big center of the 
Church of Christ, is here in Salt Lake City, among those who have 
builded this community. 

It is true, as Brother Charles H. Hart has just been telling us, 
that people are beginning more patiently to listen to the gospel. There 
isn't the same opposition to the elders that there was twenty or twenty- 
five years ago. We can go out and proclaim the fact that we belong 
to the "Mormon" Church. Twenty or twenty-five years ago that was a 
challenge for a discussion. Today it is accepted ; it is taken for granted. 
The other fellow may not believe it, but he will stand and listen to 
you. I have experienced it in my little life. I have been acquainted 
with more non-"Mormons" probably than I have with persons among 
the Latter-day Saints. Everyone knows that I am a Latter-day Saint, 
that I am a "Mormon," and 'they accept it, pay no particular attention 
to it, but they accept it as a fact. That is going to be a great help. 
I trust that we in the Eastern States mission will take advantage of that 
situation; that we will go forward; that we will preach the gospel 
by day and we will preach it by night. We will keep' on going. After 
all, that is the great thing — to get the knowledge or the belief into the 
hearts of men, and to get them into the Church, and get them so 
that we can lift them up. When you and I first entered we did not 
have much of an understanding of the gospel. It came to us by in- 
spiration from God above, but as we came along and you helped and 
everybody helped to give us more instruction, we began to see the 
grandeur of it and we appreciated it. 

I feel glad that I am going on a mission. Though it is late in life, 
probably, I shall do my best. I know that I have to follow a great man, 
a great orator, but I shall do my best, so long as the Lord shall keep 
me in that country, to convert the people to the fact that here in Utah 
and surrounding states are the Saints of God, those whom he has select- 
ed, as a small number, to bring out the truth in the world. I pray God 
that he will bless us all in doing that which we can do, at home or

abroad, preaching the gospel of Christ, so that we may bring men into 
this communion, all of which I ask, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER FRED J. TADJE 

Former President of the Swiss-German Mission 

My brethren and sisters : I am very grateful to my heavenly Father 
for the opportunity that I have had of fulfiling a mission ampng 
the German-speaking people. I am also very happy to have this 
privilege of being home again and enjoying the association of my 
brethren and sisters here in Zion. My spirit has responded to the 
treatment received during this conference. I feel that we have had 
a spiritual feast, for which I have longed, a number of years. I 
mean by that, I have longed for the opportunity of meeting again 
with the brethren and sisters in general conference assembled. 

I should like to state, briefly this morning, just what we have 
been doing in the mission field during the last four years. It is 
now just a little over four years since I left, with my family, on 
this mission, i Elder Charles S. Hyde, who was called to preside over 
the Netherlands mission, and a group of elders, went with us. We 
left Salt Lake City on March 16, 1923. On the evening of our de- 
parture from this city it was raining, and by morning we were in 
the midst of a very cold and violent snow storm, which made our 
train eighteen hours late by the time we arrived in Chicago. I be- 
came ill with grippe the first night out of Salt Lake City, and I 
believe because of the cold train and lack of hospital accommoda- 
tions, this cold brought on a very severe case of inflammatory 
rheumatism with which I suffered very severely on the whole trip, 
and a month after my arrival in the mission field. By the time we 
reached Liverpool I could hardly walk. Only with the greatest of 
difficulty was I able to move about, and when we. arrived in 
Cologne, which is about two-thirds of the way from Liverpool to 
Basel, I was rendered so weak that it was impossible for me to go 
on. We remained there five days. During all that time I was con- 
fined to a bed which was furnished by a family of Saints. In fact, 
they gave us the best accommodations possible. They turned over 
to us several rooms, which we appreciated very much. When I 
arrived in Basel I was almost a physical wreck, but I soon found a 
place to rest and expected to be well again in a few days. In this, 
however, I was very m,uch disappointed, as I was bedridden for 
nearly a month. I did not have the privilege when I arrived in the 
mission field of visiting in all the branches and conferences with 
elder Serge Ballif, who was presiding over that mission, and whom 
I was to succeed, for within an hour of my arrival in the mission 
field, in Basel. I was confined to my bed. When I had recovered 
sufficiently to leave my bedroom, conferences were arranged for all 
of the sixteen districts in the mission. About two weeks before I 
was to start on my trip I suffered a relapse and was forced to return 



ELDER FRED J. TADJE 



147 



to bed. My condition became almost hopeless, and I began to 
wonder how long it was going to last. Discouragement had not 
set in yet. for I knew positively that the Lord's purpose in calling 
me on this mission was not that I should spend my days in bed sick. 
That faith and assurance had been given me before I left this city, 
thanks to the Lord, but I became very anxious to meet the elders 
and the Saints. I began pleading with my heavenly Father to ren- 
der me physically fit, and to enable me to accomplish the desires of 
my heart. While I lay there so helpless, the second time, I gave 
every consideration to the advisability of calling off these confer- 
ences. I consulted with our mission secretary. Elder Kasteler, 
and we both were agreed that I would not be able to fill these con- 
ference appointments. So he was asked to give the conference 
presidents notice of the postponement. As he was leaving my bed- 
room — he was not entirely out of my sight — the Spirit of the Lord 
enlightened me, my brethren and sisters, and reminded me of an 
experience which I had had two or three days before. I asked 
Brother Kasteler to return, and I said to him : "It will not be nec- 
essary for you to write the conference presidents, for I am going to 
be well in time to attend those conferences." 

What do you think happened? The Spirit of the Lord gave me 
to understand that if I really wanted to I should be able to fill those 
appointments. Elder Kasteler marvelled about it, and in spite of 
my pains, I felt like shouting hosannas to the Lord for his good- 
ness unto me. Did I really want to be out in the field? Yes, in 
very deed. I knew positively that I was going to be well, for I 
wanted to be among those elders and Saints ; and so it came true ! 
The Lord heard my prayers and granted me the desire of my heart. 
I hope I shall never be found ungrateful to the Lord by forgetting 
this incident and a number -of others of a similar character which I 
experienced during this last mission. 

The physician warned me not to leave on this trip. It was the 
rainy season. It had rained almost incessantly. He felt I was go- 
ing out too soon after such a siege of illness. He turned to me and 
said: "Mr. Tadje, if I had complete control over you, you would 
not go away, but you would remain right here and take baths and 
other treatments ; because a recurrence of that rheumatism through 
the same cause might incapacitate you for life." He was in earnest, 
but I smiled and assured him that nothing like that was going to 
take place, and it did not, for I never had another .sick day on my 
mission. My health improved from day to day, and it appeared that 
traveling during the inclement season did me good instead of harm. 
When I returned from my first trip, which lasted approximately 
three months, I had completely recovered. 

The mission made progress by leaps and bounds. The Spirit 
of the Lord touched the hearts of the honest seekers for the truth. 
No man living can rightfully claim credit for the success the mis- 
sion enjoyed. During the last four years over five thousand^ souls 
were baptized in the Church in those countries. It> was a joy to 



148 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



hold conferences because of the host of people who would attend. 
Frequently there were a thousand and more people in attendance, 
at which four hundred, five hundred, or six hundred, were friends 
eager to hear our message. It was a common occurrence during the 
years of 11923 and 1924 to have a good-sized baptism after each con- 
ference. We baptized possibly from twenty or thirty to forty within 
a week or two weeks after this conference. We held these con- 
ferences every Sunday. 

It might interest you to know that we have splendidly organ- 
ized Sunday schools in the mission, also Relief Societies, Mutual 
Improvement associations of the Young Men and Young Ladies, 
and before we were released the - Primary organizations were al- 
ready functioning in a few of the larger branches, but they were 
not known by that name. This work was done in connection with 
the Sunday schools. Also a very remarkable work is done in the 
mission by our choirs. Organizations of one hundred voices, or 
more, would furnish the music at our special meeting's and confer- 
ences. Our local members in the mission are very diligent in 
•spreading the gospel. I have in mind a widow in the city of 
Chemjnitz, who used to bring over twenty children to Sunday 
school each Sunday morning. These were children of her neigh 
bors. Several rows of chairs were reserved for her each Sunday 
morning by the superintendency, and a similar work was done by 
these brethren and sisters throughout the whole mission. 

Due to the phenomenal success in the mission, as to making 
converts, it became apparent that more efficient wor,k could be 
done and many new members could be taught the principles of the 
gospel more efficiently, and the priesthood and auxiliary organiza- 
tions could be looked after better, if the mission were divided. The 
presiding brethren saw fit to do this, so the division was effected 
in 1925. President Hugh J. Cannon was appointed to preside over 
the western part of the former Swiss and German mission,, and I 
was transferred to preside over the eastern part of the mission with 
headquarters at Dresden. 

Many new fields have been opened up during the last year, and 
I am sure that thousands will yet accept the gospel in that coun- 
try, provided the conditions remain as favorable as they are at the 
present time. Germany is in very deed a fruitful field. Our mis- 
sionaries are enjoying perfect freedom ; and let me assure you they 
are doing a good work. Some of them will even do a better work if 
no opportunity is given them by our good parents here at home to 
spend money lavishly, comparatively speaking. Some elders get 
along with less than fifteen dollars a month in the mission, others 
spend twenty-five and a number of them, possibly the average, 
thirty dollars a month. I think the parents should not send more 
than about thirty dollars a month unless these elders are assigned 
to labor in new fields. Remember high expenditures lessen the 
spirituality of the elders. The German people are very hospitable, 
and the members of the Church even more so. They give food. 



'ELDER FRED J. TADJE

shelter, clothes and money to the Lord's servants. You have read 
what the revelation says about such people. We read in Section 
84 of the Doctrine and Covenants as follows : 

"And whoso receiveth you, there I will be also, for I will go before your 
face. I will be on your right hand and on your left, and my Spirit shall be in 
your hearts, and mine angels round about you, to bear you up. 

"Whoso receiveth you receiveth me; and the same will feed you, and clothe 
you, and give you money. 

"And he who feeds you, or clothes you, or gives you money, shall in nowise 
lose his reward. 

"And he that doeth not these things is not my disciple; by this you may 
know my disciples." 

I feel that there are many disciples in the Swiss and German 
and the German-Austrian missions, for they do feed the elders of 
the Church, they give our elders money, and they look upon them, 
as real servants of the Almighty. The Saints do more than this ; 
they observe the law of tithing in a most remarkable manner, and 
they fail not to donate liberally to the fast offering account. The 
mission ranks very high in these activities. I should like to show 
you just by one or two incidents, for I haven't time for more, how 
the attitude of the people toward the Church and its members has 
changed in Germany. Professor Thomas A. Beal, of the Univer- 
sity of Utah, was invited to deliver a lecture on Utah and the "Mor- 
m(ons ; ." at the University of Berlin, on the night of December 15, 
1925. There were from three hundred to four hundred people in 
attendance, and the address was well received. Before 1914 this 
would have been an impossibility. Also Elders David O. McKay 
and James E. Talmage, myself and many other elders have had 
the opportunity of preaching the gospel in the school halls of 
Prussia and in the City Hall of Berlin. This would have been 
simply impossible prior to the time of the Great War. 

I could relate other incidents to show you how the local mem- 
bers are respected now in the mission, whereas formerly they were 
despised by city officials. I may possibly be permitted to relate an 
incident that took place at the unveiling of the memorial tablet in 
honor of Karl G. Maeser, so that it will go into the record. The 
present owner of the property where Karl G. Maeser was born did 
not object to our erecting a tablet in his honor. I made a number 
of visits to the place, and each visit resulted in a religious conver- 
sation. He was always glad to see me and welcomed me in his 
home, but of all things in the world religion interested him, the 
least. He said : "Mr. Tadje, I simply cannot believe in the exist- 
ence of a God. I have heard and seen too much of ministers who 
are insincere ; therefore, the churches do not interest me. I cannot 
and will not trouble my mind about God and religion." I would 
hear that story every time that I conversed with him. At the close 
of the dedicatorial services I noticed that his little garden, in front 
of the house, had been trampled on by our people, and it did not 
look very good. I told him how sorry I was that we had ruined his 



150 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



little garden, but he said to me in all sincerity: "Mr. Tadje, our 
kind,, heavenly Father will let it grow again, I am sure." He added : 
"You may be surprised at hearing me talk that way, but, Mr. Tadje, 
I tell you my heart is full, my feelings almost overwhelm! me; be- 
cause, what I have seen and heard, today, convinces me that there 
is a just God in heaven." So impressive, my brethren and sisters, 
were the services incident to the unveiling of this memorial tablet. 

In conclusion, I wish to bear my testimony that I know pos- 
itively that the gospel is true ; I know positively that the super- 
natural elements, to which our esteemed President referred in his 
opening remarks, exist in the Church today. The Lord has been 
with us, and may he continue to bless us ; m,ay we abide in the faith 
continually by observing his commandments, I ask in the name 
of Jesus Christ. Amen. 



ELDER LEVI EDGAR YOUNG 

Of the First Council of Seventy 

1 noticed, by an editorial in the paper this morning, that a monu- 
ment is !to be erected in ,honor of the pioneer mothers of this great 
country of ours. I was thrilled when 1 read the account, and happy 
when I was informed a ;few weeks ago that the monument de- 
signed in sculpture, by a Utah son, Mahonri Young, would pos- 
sibly be accepted by the judges in the contest. As I see before me 
a number of pioneer mothers, I wish to say, on this occasion, that 
I am very grateful to God that the wonderful work of the pioneer 
mothers, who blazed the trails into the wilds of America, is to be 
recognized. For, if there ever lived fine womanhood, women who 
loved God and gave to the work of God all that was best, it was the 
pioneer mothers of this country and this great state. 

Ten years ago, this morning, President Woodrow iWilson, before 
the Congress of the United States, proclaimed war against Germany, 
and the United States entered that great contest. You pioneer mothers 
sent forth your sons and your grandsons. They fought in the war, 
they fell in battle, but they honored you in maintaining the finer ideals 
of civilization. The war was ended a few years ago, but there are some 
things greatly needed by all peoples of the world. The world today 
needs a higher morality, and to attain such it must recognize the 
existence of a divine Will and Personality, more than ever before. 
The idea that good can be disassociated from the idea of God is wrong. 
The world since the war needs a finer system, not only of religion, but 
of effort for a larger righteousness. This will be the greatest pre- 
ventive of war. Nations must have a deeper consciousness of the 
personal relationship between God and the individual, and a broader 
philosophy of history which attempts to unfold the divine purpose in 
the rise and progress of nations. What the world needs, therefore, is 
character, the kind of character that you pioneer mothers taught your 



ELDER LEVI EDGAR YOUNG 



151 



sons and your daughters ; and it is the gospel of Jesus Christ which 
brings out the idea of a belief in God, a God who is righteous and 
loving — a person. This must lie at the root of character, and today the 
Latter-day Saints realize more than ever that it is revelation that gives a 
new impulse to the spiritual advance of humanity. 

My brethren and sisters, life is a spiritual gift and a spiritual op- 
portunity. Salvation means the recovery of life. It was the Apostle 
Peter who wrote and said: "His divine purpose has granted to us all 
things that pertain to life and to godliness, through the knowledge of 
him who called us by his own glory and virtue." 

There has been ushered into the world a new force in history, and 
this was accomplished a hundred years ago by a barefoot boy, a child, 
who hardly had enough to eat, but who had linked his life with God's. 
His name was Joseph Smith. He was the "Mormon" prophet, the 
prophet of this new dispensation, and was born at the beginning 
of the nineteenth century. It was a new age of the world's history. 
The government of the United States had been organized. The common 
man had come into his own. The government under which we live had 
acclaimed for the first time in all history that man is endowed with 
certain inalienable rights, among which are life, liberty and the pursuit 
of happiness. The constitution of the United States had written large : 
"We, the people" ! It was the common man who was speaking, the. 
man upon whose shoulders rested the great work of the new age. So 
this new prophet came at an opportune time, for a new age had come ; 
a new age for the extending of the message of Christ Jesus our Lord 
was to be ushered in. To the world this Joseph Smith announced the 
word of God direct from heaven. The Priesthood of God was restored 
with all its rights, powers and blessings. The Church of Christ was 
reestablished and the knowledge of man's divine relationship to God 
was reaffirmed. The world was given a new faith. Michelet, the 
French historian, said at the beginning of that century: "If there is 
anything in the world that is needed, it is a new faith in Christ our 
Lord." This, the religion of Jesus Christ, asserted with a clearer 
vision, a deeper knowledge, the kingdom of God and its establishment 
upon the earth. It teaches the truth of God the Father and the infinite 
value of the human soul. It restores the higher righteousness and the 
commandment of love. It summons all men to Christ and says to them : 
"Rise up and be God's children." All must labor and put their hands, 
hearts and minds to the work of progress. Eternal progression and the 
immortality of the soul give, us the key to the higher life beyond. So 
through the work of this prophet a new day has dawned with a new sky 
over our heads. For in religion as in other things men are not owned 
any more but are guided. This religion of Christ, our Lord, 
claims today that men of truth are living more than ever in all history. 
This man Joseph Smith, therefore, was not a Calvin nor a Luther nor 
a Zwingli. He was far more than they were ; he was a prophet of fire, 
with a moral intensity, believing and teaching that. the Kingdom of 
Heaven is near at hand. He believed and taught that wrong and injustice, 



152 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



unrighteousness and sin, could not. stand before the oncoming of the 
kingdom of righteousness. The hearts of men are to be turned to usher 
in ithe kingdom and the glory of God. Prophet and seer, he was the 
great interpreter of the Spirit of Christ to the new thought of the new 
world. He did not arrive at truth by a logical process. He perceived 
it. Truth was spiritually discerned. So today, for a nation to enter 
into this great program of peace that we are dreaming and thinking 
about, that nation must discern truth and light direct from God. 

Christ today is acclaimed anew. There is a superb explanation of 
mind and thought and peace. Men of God are entering on the scene of 
action as never before. So lift up your eyes, O people of the world ! 
The supreme drama is enacting. My brethren and sisters, may we go 
forth from this conference with a greater testimony burning in our 
hearts; may our love for humanity increase; may our faith in God 
deepen. Amen. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

President Charles H. Hart's remarks about the Catholic Encyclo- 
pedia have brought the following memorandum from Brother Orson 
F. Whitney: 

"President Grant: "l wrote the article on 'Mormons' for the new Catholic 
Encyclopedia, by request of President Joseph F. Smith, and at the solicitation of 
Dean Harris. He signed it, and sent it to New York, where it was changed, 
things being written into it that the article, as it left my hands, did not contain. 
The assertion that the Three Witnesses denied their Testimony was one of these 
interpolations. I protested to the Dean, and he invited me to correct the mis- 
statement, which I did. Whether they published my second article in the Ency- 
clopedia (as promised) I know not. (Signed) Orson F. Whitney." 

Apparently they did not. 

The congregation sang, "Do what is right." 

The closing prayer was offered by Elder Joseph E. Cordon. 

Conference adjourned until 2 p. m. 

CONCLUDING MEETING 

The closing meeting of the 97th Annual Conference session was 
held on Wednesday, April 6, 1927, at 2 o'clock, in the tabernacle, a large 
congregation being in attendance. 

President Heber J. Grant presided, and announced that the con- 
gregation would sing the hvmn, "Now let us rejoice in the day of salva- 
tion." 

After singing, prayer was offered by Elder George H. Brimhall. 
The congregation sang, "Zion stands with hills surrounded."

ELDER STEPHEN L. RICHARDS 

During the noon hour,- 1 called upon Brother Richard R. Lyman. 
He is detained at home by sickness. He asked me to convey to the 
conference his love and blessing. I do so cheerfully, because I know 
of the depth of his feeling and regard for you, my brethren and sisters, 
and for the work of the Church. 

I know that the few moments which remain, the short time in 
which to conclude this conference, are very precious, and I shall be 
grateful indeed if I may leave just a thought, prompted by the proper 
spirit, as a contribution to the great work of the Church. I have been 
thrilled and inspired, as I am sure you have all been, by -the testimonies 
which have been given and the splendid remarks which have been made. 

INTELLIGENT RESPONSE TO THE SPIRIT OF THE SPEAKERS 

I have studied with some care the various congregations which 
have assembled during the conference. I have looked into the faces 
of these men who sit near the stand, many of whom I have the honor 
to know. I have seen in their countenances the impressions which have 
been made by the inspiring discourses, and I have noted that throughout 
the building on all the occasions when meetings have been held, great 
interest has been given to the proceedings. It is apparent that those who 
have gathered have responded to the spirit of the speakers and to the 
great truths to which utterance has been given. 

THERE ARE THE WAYWARD, THE CARELESS, THE INDIFFERENT 

As I have observed these congregations I have continually thought 
of an imaginary congregation which, perchance, might be assembled in 
this great "building. I have thought, and I regret that my belief is that 
it is true, that this building could be filled with another congregation 
of members of the Church made up of those who are indifferent, who 
are wayward, who are careless and negligent, and whose hearts and 
spirits do not respond to the message of truth as do yours. I have 
thought of these men and women who have come from good families, 
whose fathers and mothers have in some instances been the very pillars 
of the Church, and I have wondered, if such a congregation were assem- 
bled, just what we would say to them and just how we would endeavor 
to reach them with these great truths which are embraced within the 
gospel of Christ. 

OUR OBLIGATION TO INTERPRET THE GOSPEL TO THE NEGLIGENT 

These who are wayward and indifferent are scattered all through 
the stakes of Zion and the wards of the Church. Unfortunately there 
is scarcely a single family where there is not some problem, in which 
there is not someone who does not think and feel quite as the faithful 
think and feel, and to whom it is difficult to give interpretations of the 
gospel that may appeal. I would like to say that while I regard our 



154 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



greatest work to be the proclamation of the gospel abroad to the peoples 
of the earth, that men may know of the truth and be persuaded to come 
to the fold of Christ, nevertheless, I fully believe that our obligation 
to take and interpret the gospel to those who have in some measure at 
least departed from the faith, is of almost equal importance, and 1 
appeal to the men who preside over the stakes and the missions and the 
wards, and who administer in the various organizations of the Church, 
to do all that lies within their power to make the organizations of the 
Church reach this great multitude of good people who are worth re- 
claiming, in whose blood courses that tendency to faith that comes from 
Jgood ancestry. I sometimes think that it is infinitely more important 
to retain for the Church fine, intelligent men and women, whose fathers 
and mothers have been associated with the Church, than it is to secure 
others from distant lands. I believe that the message of the gospel 
will touch these people if we can but interpret it in terms that they can 
understand, and if we can induce them to open up their hearts to a 
reception of its great truths. 

CHANGES IN THE PHYSICAL WORLD AND THE WAYS OF THOUGHT 

Great changes have come to us in comparatively few years. Only 
a short time ago, within my own lifetime, changes of so tremendous 
a character and import have come as not only to have revolutionized 
the physical world, but in my judgment, to have very largely changed 
men's attitude and way of thinking. My grandfather came with the 
pioneers in 1847. He did not live seven years after coming here. 1 
thought that if he were to return to this valley, and with nothing but 
mortal eyes and wisdom were to see the city and all that has here been 
made, it would be beyond his recognition. 1 wonder if changes com- 
parable to that have not come about in. the ways and thoughts of youth. 
Surely they are not able to escape the influence of their environment. 
Men today worship at the altar of success pretty much in a godless way. 
We have come out of the world, it is true, but the world have come in 
among us. And they have brought to us their practices and their ideals. 
We are subject to their influence.- It is impossible to prevent men and 
women from responding in some degree to the influences which sur- 
round them. Science has revolutionized our lives. It affords us con- 
veniences and utilities which we use, and we are not so dependent upon 
divine aid as once we were. 

A PIONEER EXPERIENCE SHE DEPENDED ON GOD 

I recall a few years ago visiting" with an old lady in the southern 
part of the state. She was then ninety-two years old. She had been 
a pioneer, and in my conversation with her she gave me some of her 
experiences. She said that during the early days she and her family 
were for weeks without food. "For one period of three weeks," she 
said, "we lived entirely on nettles." I said : "Nettles, what do you 
mean by nettles?" She said: "Just the common stinging nettles that 



ELDER STEPHEN L. RICHARDS 155 



grow by the ditchbanks." I said : "How could you do it?" "Well," 
she said, "some way or other we got along. We were so interested in 
the great work going forward, our faith was such that we managed." 
One day, however, she said her two little girls came to her and said : 
"Mama, can't we have a little bread? Right there I went upon my 
knees," she said, "and I prayed God that he would grant a little bread 
to those two children. No sooner had I arisen -from my knees than a 
knock came at the door and there stood a neighbor. In her hands she 
held two slices of bread and a can of milk. She said : 'Sister, I thought 
perhaps your little ones might need this, and I brought it to them'." 
She believed that her prayer had been answered. I do ! She depended 
upon God. ; 

JUST AS NECESSARY TO APPEAL FOR DIVINE PROTECTION TODAY 

But today we do not depend upon God for bread, at least we do 
not think we do, but we do depend upon him for the bread of life. We 
depend upon him for inspiration, and it is just as necessary, if we 
could only make our youth believe it, to appeal today for divine pro- 
tection and guidance as it was in those early days to make appeal for 
the sustenance of life. 

NEED OF INTERPRETING THE GOSPEL IN THE LANGUAGE OF YOUTH 

Our boys and girls through their education have in many instances 
reached an independence of all these sacred things, the things which 
meant so much to their fathers and their mothers ; and my observation 
is that one of the things most needed today is an interpretation of the 
gospel in the language of these boys and these girls, so that they may 
understand its vitality and its import to them. All the facilities of the 
Church, all the work that we can do, in my judgment, should be directed 
to the saving of these priceless assets of the Church and of the Nation, 
and of ourselves — our children. I want them to have a testimony which 
I know is the most valuable thing- that can come to them. I wish they 
all could have heard the testimonies that have been uttered in this con- 
ference. I feel sure that the impression of the spirit would have been 
helpful to them. 

TESTIMONY 

I bear my testimony that I know that this is the work of God. 
I wish I could deliver it to every young man and every young woman, 
to every wayward man and wayward woman in the entire Church. I 
know it just as confidently, just as surely, as I know any other fact 
that has entered into my life. I know that Joseph Smith was a prophet 
of the living God. All of my feelings, every sensation that I can in- 
terpret, bears witness of that truth to me. I know that it is the Holy 
Ghost that makes that knowledge certain. I know, too, that that 
knowledge will come to every honest man and woman and to every 
young man and woman who strives for it and who lives for it, but I 



156 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



want us all to help in every way that we can to bring that knowledge 
to the youth of our Church, and to all those who have fallen by the 
wayside. I am grateful for that knowledge. It brings into my life more 
comfort, more satisfaction, more hope, more that is worth striving for, 
than all else, and I am very desirous that I may live to be worthy of a 
continuation of that testimony, that it may grow and ripen arid 
strengthen within me. 

My grandfather was with the Prophet Joseph in Carthage jail. 
He was his intimate friend ; he was his confidential secretary. He knew 
his thoughts, I believe, as well as one man may know the thoughts of 
another. He loved him. He was perfectly willing to give his life for 
the prophet. My grandfather has left his testimony that Joseph Smith 
was divinely chosen, that he was indeed a prophet of God, and I know 
that he did not lie, and I know that hundreds of other good men who 
knew this prophet have not falsified when they have g'iven their testi- 
mony of his divine work. 

God grant that the testimony of this latter-day work may come 
not only to the great hosts of faithful Saints who, from season to season, 
gather here to hear the word of the Lord, but to these hosts of worthy 
men and women who should be saved, who have strayed from the path 
of truth. I feel for one to consecrate my efforts to their reclamation 
and retention in the fold of Christ, and I know that could you speak 
here you would join in such a dedication. God bless you, my brethren 
and sisters, that you may carry forward this great and wonderful work 
to its glorious destiny, I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD 

I am happy, my brethren and sisters, to find myself in full accord 
with all that has been said in this important conference, and earnestly 
do T desire to add my testimony to those which have been borne, and 
to speak of one or two items, that have already been referred to, which 
have been weighing very heavily upon my own mind for more than a 
year past. I believe that this representative gathering of Latter-day 
Saints is an opportunity for the messages that have been delivered 
by the President of the Church and his associates to be carried, 
in the spirit of these instructions, to the various stakes of Zion. 

MEETING THE TESTING TIME 

I wish to read a few verses from the 115th section of the Doctrine 
and Covenants. The Lord said to his Church, in 1838 : 

"Verily I say unto you all : Arise and shine forth, that thy light may be a 
standard for the nations ; 

"And that the gathering together upon the land of Zion, and upon her stakes, 

may be for a defense, and for a refuge from the storm, and from wrath when it 

shall be poured out without mixture upon the whole earth." 
i 

I have felt that the Lord had in mind the very perils that are 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD 



157 



threatening the world and are endangering the faith of some neglect- 
ful Latter-day Saints, when he spoke of" finding a place of defense 
for us, a place where we may escape not only the physical dangers that 
will be in the world, but those storms of a moral character that are far 
more disastrous to people than physical destruction or physical injury-. 
It has been said during the conference that as a Church we are enjoy- 
ing a period of peace. I rejoice that after nearly a century of struggle 
and effort, contending against all kind of opposition, we have at last 
won the right to exist, a right conceded now by men and women gen- 
erally in the world. Reference has also been made to a condition of 
prosperity that is with us. I rejoice in that. I would not change 
the prosperity of the people, nor would I stir up strife. I welcome 
peace, it gives us a better opportunity to deliver our message to the 
children of men. But the thing I am concerned about is not so much 
what the world thinks about us just now as it is our own status with 
reference to keeping the commandments of God and how to meet the 
perils that are before us. I am not a pessimist, and yet seeing and 
feeling things most clearly, I want to be one of those watchmen upon 
the towers of Zion, with my brethren, who detect the storm that is 
coming and give a fair warning, and point out not only the danger, but 
the way to avert that danger. Therefore, I feel that we have probably 
reached, in the Church, in this period of our peace and prosperity, a 
testing time for us. If you will read the history of the past, no dis- 
pensation of the gospel has ever had so hard a time to maintain 
itself as during the period of its own peace and prosperity. Indeed, 
there is no gospel dispensation that has yet survived its peace and 
prosperity. In the time of its trouble, people were united, and stood 
shoulder to shoulder and endured all things and kept the faith and died 
for the faith. I say, I am not a pessimist, nor do I believe that we will 
lose the faith, nor do I believe that the dangers which threaten us are 
going to overwhelm us, and yet I am conscious of the fact that mere 
membership in this Church will not save a man or a woman. It will 
require something else. I cling tenaciously to the promise made through 
the Prophet Daniel, as the Lord inspired him, looking down to our own 
period of time and predicting the rise of this Church, insignificant 
as it was, like a stone cut out of the mountain without hands, yet if 
shall roll forth until it will fill the whole earth, and it shall not be 
left to another people, nor shall it fail. I have a comfort in that ; I 
have an abiding confidence that no matter what the difficulties are, the 
majority of this people shall survive even this peril, and that we shall 
demonstrate the thing that never has yet been done ; namely, maintain 
the truth and defend it in peace as well as in times of trouble, and that 
the work shall go on victoriously until Christ shall come to receive it, 
and that it shall roll forth until it fills the whole earth, for it is the 
last dispensation and it shall not fail. But many of us may fail. That 
is my fear, that is my anxiety. 

THE TEMPTATIONS OF PEACE AND PROSPERITY 

In the time of our peace and prosperity, we may be tempted n> be 



158 



i 

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



indulgent with ourselves. All over the world, I believe there is a grow- 
ing spirit, even in the hearts of many leaders, to become careless, to 
become more or less accustomed to the new order of things that obtain. 
This, after all, is most threatening to the life, to the peace of the people 
and to the stability of even governments themselves. The statement 
of a poet is still true, that : 

"Vice is a monster of so frightful mien, 
As to be hated, needs but to be seen ; 
Yet seen too oft, familiar with her face, 
We first endure, then pity, then embrace.^" 

We came out of the world to escape the evils of the world, but, 
as has just been observed, these world conditions have come to us. 
We are part of the world and the influences of the world and the 
practices of the world will naturally have their effect upon the lives 
of the Latter-day Saints. Is it possible that we ourselves are seeing 
so much of these things which a hundred years ago when this Church 
was brought into existence would have shocked us ; the present moral 
status, the frequency of divorce, and many common practices that are 
heralded abroad throughout our own country that would have been 
revolting then — is it possible that these vices have been seen so much by 
us that even some of us begin to feel a little bit calloused and almost 
wink at them? I hope not. I believe that this body of people here 
assembled have no such feeling as to compromise or tolerate evil. We 
are tolerant of the sinner, b*ut we cannot look upon sin with the least 
degree of allowance; and woe be to the man or woman, the leader in 
the wards or stakes or elsewhere, among the young people, who can 
wink at sin and compromise with it ! 

THE TENDENCY TO INDULGENCE AND RELAXATION 

Woe be ,to him who contributes to the establishment or the per- 
petuation of a state or condition that contributes to the delinquency, 
to the sin, to the transgression, of boys or girls or men or women. So 
far as we are concerned we stand solidly against immorality ; and let 
me say to you, my brethren and sisters, the culminating thing that 
shall come out of this tendency towards indulgence, towards relaxation, 
is immorality, and immorality is the plague of the world today, and that 
plague is threatening all about us, if it is not indeed creeping into 
the midst of Latter-day Saints. Therefore to our standards, men of 
Israel, which teach us to look upon virtue as precious as life itself, 
and that we (Would as isoon die as to lose our virtue. There is no 
cessation on the part of the enemy against this work. Though he 
may hot be conspiring to move mobs against us, nor to induce men 
to annihilate us, he is among the people with new means and ways, 
lulling them off to sin a little, to lie a little and to steal a little, 
and do other things with the promise : You will be beaten with a few 
stripes, but you will be all right. It is the doctrine of the devil which 
is intended to lead men gently down to hell, and we cannot be ignorant 
of it nor indifferent toward it. 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD 



159 



A WARNING AND A FOREWARNING 

When the Lord gave the Word of Wisdom he used this language 
in (the 4th verse of the 89th section of the Doctrine and Covenants : 

"Behold, verily, thus saith the Lord unto you: In consequence of evils and 
designs which do and will exist in the hearts of conspiring men in the last days, 
I have warned you, and forewarn you, by giving unto vou this word of wisdom 
by revelation." 

The Lord knew what was coming. He knew iback in Daniel's 
time. He could tell the nations what would arise. He knew the times 
of men's coming. He knew their habitations and their limitations and 
he could foretell them. God knew when he spoke to the Prophet Joseph 
Smith that which would come : "Knowing," said he, "the calamity 
that would come upon the earth." He spoke to Joseph Smith and 
through him sent a warning to all the world of the danger that was 
threatening and offered the means of escape. But the Lord is very 
much like an earthly father. What can an earthly father do to his 
grown sons and daughters more than to teach them of the danger. 
He cannot rescue them against their will, if they are determined to 
sin and transgress the law of God and man. They presently shall Come 
into bonds and imprisonment and be subject to the execution of the law, 
and when the judge renders his decision it may be years or a life of 
imprisonment or even the execution of the man himself. The father 
would be willing to give his life to save his son, but he cannot do it, 
neither can he cancel the judgment of the court nor set aside the majesty 
of the law. So it is with our heavenly Father. All he can do is to 
warn us, point out the danger, show us the way of escape, and when we 
resist it all we bind God. We speak of binding the devil, and the 
devil will be bound and have no power over us when we resist him, but 
we may resist the Lord in the same manner and thus bind his hands 
so that he can do nothing for us, for he himself is ruled by law, he 
cannot set aside the majesty of eternal law, nor save men in their sins. 
In the 88th section of the Book of Doctrine and Covenants we read : 

'"And again, verily I say unto you, that which is governed by law is also 
preserved by law and perfected and sanctified by the same. 

"That which breaketh a law, and abideth not by law, but seeketh to become 
a law unto itself, and willeth to abide in sin, and altogether abideth in sin, can- 
not be sanctified by law, neither by mercy, justice, nor judgment. Therefore, 
they must remain filthy still." 

So that God is rendered helpless in the case of a man or woman 
in this Church or out of this Church who resists him and who will not 
abide the law. 

THE WORD OF WISDOM GIVEN TO FORTIFY US 

Now the Lord gave us the Word of Wisdom to fortify us against 
the temptations of the day, giving us the power to resist, knowing 
that the man or woman who breaks the Word of Wisdom and uses 
tobacco, tea and coffee, will weaken his or her moral stability. So that 



160 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



in this other period that now has come, of other temptation that leads 
to graver sin and immorality, the individual has broken down his 
morale, his will and his power to resist, notwithstanding' the thing that 
he does is contrary to the will of God, has lost the power to stand when 
greater temptations come. God was steeling us and arming us and 
fortifying ns against the plague that is presently threatening us. 

ON MARRIAGE AND DIVORCE 

An article recently appearing in one of our magazines stated that 
the divorce rate is growing so rapidly that if it continues in the same 
increase in proportion to marriages, by the year 1936, there will be as 
many divorces each year as marriages in the United States. What 
will that do for the world or for the United States? It will destroy 
the family life, and when the family life is broken up and destroyed 
the government will be in peril. God's work can go forward only by 
men and women in the Church and in the state observing the sanctity 
of the marriage relationship. Side by side with us, in this and other 
states of the union we find forces tending to the destruction of family I 
life. In Russia and elsewhere there is a great rebellion, inspired by 
Bolshevism, which teaches the doctrine of companionship in marriage 
that may be changed and altered at will, and that the children are the 
property of the state. When these doctrines are spread abroad what 
is the antedote for them? It is the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. 
The Latter-day Saints have that which teaches them to prepare them- 
selves to come into holy places, and, over holy altars, receive each other 
by the authority that binds on earth and it is bound in heaven, in com- 
panionship as husband and wife, parent and children, ! for time and all 
eternity. No planning for divorce here in our own ranks. The evi- 
dence of the safety in God's plan is manifested, for there are twice as 
many divorces among our own people who are married outside of the I 
temple as among those who enter into this holy place and receive each 1 
other in this bond of union that begins to plan and to build forever and 
forever, and our divorce rate is 1/5 that of this country. If we want 
to escape the plague of divorce, if we want to escape the de- 
struction of family life — and when this is gone faith is gone, and there 
shall come quickly other perils in the wake of it, until we shall be 
threatened with the destruction of our civilization — we must preserve 
the foundation upon which family life rests, eternal unions. We may be 
found fault with as being narrow and intolerant by some of our outside ] 
friends, but we stand for those things that are fundamental. We al- 
ways shall stand for them, and we refuse to be absorbed by present 
world standards ; we expect to be victorious in defending our own. 
And presently, showing by the lives of the Latter-day Saints the fruits j 
of these things, it will awaken surely in the hearts of righteous men a 
consciousness that here in "Mormonism" is stability, a stability that will 
save men, save the family, save the home, save the nation. 

OUR GREATEST ASSET IS OUR BOYS AND GIRLS 

When Brother Pratt and I were in South America we presented 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD 



161 



pictures of the achievements of the Church, and I said to Brother Pratt, 
and have said many times since, that the greatest product we have is 
not our material prosperity. What I wanted was a picture of tens 
of thousands of "Mormon" boys and girls, and we have them, who keep 
the Word of Wisdom, who never have used tea, coffee or tobacco, 
who are as pure, as clean and undefiled as the angels of God. I 
would never have discovered the match of these boys and girls elsewhere 
in all the world, although I would have observed individual instances, but 
not in community groups like they may be found here, the product of this 
Church. So that my soul turns towards them in a sympathy today, 
confronted with conditions that are strange and new. They need us. 
There is now a warfare which will require the closest cooperation on the 
part of the leaders with their people, on the part of fathers and mothers 
towards their sons and daughters. No wonder the Lord said that with- 
out this principle, which joins parents and children to each other for time 
- and all eternity, the turning not only of the hearts of the living to the 
dead, but of the living children to their earthly parents, in a union that 
will 'preserve the family —the whole earth would be utterly wasted. 
The great saving thing in the world today is this principle upon which 
family life is established in this Church. 

TESTIMONY j 

Now the Lord bless us, brethren, that we shall go home with an 
awakened interest in the new problems that have arisen, with a con- 
sciousness that the people, to whom Brother Stephen L. Richards, has 
just referred, who are in danger and in peril because they keep not 
the commandments of God, that we shall reawaken their interest in 
these simple and yet all-important saving principles. They are the 
only hope of the world and the only hope of this Church. I know that 
God is with us. We are not in the dark. The light is in the ship ; 
the captain is inspired. He knows where he is going. God is at the 
helm and the storms may blow, they may become furious, but I declare 
to you as the Lord lives, that if the Latter-day Saints will only keep 
his commandments and accept of the plan he has offered, God is bound ; 
his promise will be fulfilled, we shall come out victorious and shall be 
far more distinguished than we are today, if we can only weather the 
storm that is threatening. God help us to do so, I pray in the name 
of Jesus Christ. Amen.

ELDER DAVID A. SMITH 

Of the Presiding Bishopric 

Early Sunday morning, two weeks ago, I stood in the grove 
where Joseph Smith first saw the Father and the Son. I recalled 
my first visit to that place. Then I was filled with the spirit of. 



162 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



happiness, peace and love. At that time I thought it was perhaps 
because I had pictured in my mind the beginning of that farm when 
my great-grandfather and his boys (one of them my grandfather) 
were clearing the land and building their house, using the crude 
methods of the year 1820. Since my first visit I have been there 
with members of the Church, and they have expressed the same 
feeling I had then, which feeling has possessed me on each visit to 
that place. I have been there with those not of our faith and they 
have mentioned an unusual feeling of peace. Last Summer a group 
of Protestant ministers visited the grove, and on leaving, one of 
them said, speaking of Joseph Smith: "He certainly chose an ideal 
setting for his vision, if such a thing- could be." Another answered, 
"Yes,, there is certaini}' a peaceful influence here. One could al- 
most imagine such a thing to be possible." 

I thank my heavenly Father that in my soul I believe in the 
testimony of Joseph Smith. I would like to dwell upon that thought, 
if time would permit, but 1 am limited and have another thought I 
wish to leave with you, God being my helper, and I sincerely pray 
that he will bless me that I may give advice that will have his 
approval. 

I am a son of the soil. I love the farm. I love to dig and plow 
and plant. I continued in that occupation until called from it by 
the Church into the position I now occupy. Where in any line of 
work or endeavor may we find such an opportunity to commune 
with the living God? Let me call your attention to the fact that 
from the very beginning there has been a relationship among God, 
man and the soil, making man dependent upon the soil for his very 
existence, and upon God for peace and happiness. When God placed 
man on the earth, he planted a garden eastward in Eden and placed 
man in it. Through transgression he was driven from that 
garden and was compelled to eat his bread by the sweat of 
his face. Father Abraham was led to a land of promise and Israel, 
his chosen people, established in this land of plenty. Through 
transgression, they were taken into bondage and finally because 
of their sufferings and pleadings, God took mercy upon them and 
led them out of bondage through Moses, unto the promised land, 
which he said had been prepared for them— a promised land for his 
chosen people. But when they chose to rely upon the words of 
men rather than the promise of God, they were required to wander 
in the wilderness forty years. With the exception of two, all. those 
over twenty years of age were deprived of enjoying the blessings 
faith would have brought them. 

We find in the history of this continent that when the word 
came to Lehi to preach to the people at Jerusalem and warn them 
of the destruction of that city, they believed him not and he was 
driven from their midst. Nephi, through his faith, was promised by 
the Lord that they should be led to a land of promise, a choice land, 
yea, a land choice above all other lands. And in this day, a prom- 
ise has been given to this people that they should be led to a prom-

ised land, a land that should be their inheritance forever, provided 
they were faithful in keeping his commandments, and showed by 
their works that they were worthy to continue in that inheritance. 

The other day we had a statement made to us, giving figures 
showing the amount it has cost to keep missionaries in the field. 
I wonder how miany have stopped to realize that most of this vast 
amount of money has been taken from the soil. God has given it 
to us, for he has given us a choice land, "a land choice above all 
other lands," for where in all the world can you find a land more 
productive than that which has been given to us? I sometimes 
wonder if we fully appreciate this blessing which has come to us. 
I stood the other day and looked at those great trees around the 
home erected by Joseph Smith and his sons before 1820, on that 
farm where the Father and the Son appeared to Joseph Smith and 
where the angel Moroni appeared on several occasions. They stand 
there today, as ornaments, as a comfort, for they bring shade and 
peace around that home, giving the impression that the builders 
had looked to the future. I wonder how many of us are looking 
to the future? How many of us are planting trees around our 
homes, are beautifying our homes? Are we farming, looking into 
the future, or just farming, impoverishing the soil, feeling that our 
inheritance is only temporary? There is in the world today a spirit 
of strife and selfishness and contention, and I am wondering if we 
are permitting this spirit to come into our midst. We should \k 
living for the future and the hereafter. As a people, we believe in 
co-operation, not that supposed co-operation that breeds hatred, 
strife, contention and ill-will, but that co-operation, that broth- 
erly love and good-will, which leads men to reach the out- 
stretched hand to those in need, to those who suffer, to those who 
hunger, to those who are ill. That is the proper co-operation, and 
we as Latter-day Saints believe in it and are expected to practice it. 
As I travel through the land, these thoughts come to my mind. We 
are establishing in some districts, dairy industries, creameries or 
cheese factories. Are we producing in abundance in order that we 
might have funds to continue our missionary work? Or, are we con- 
tending with one another? Are we feeling that the other fellow is 
o-etting more gain out of our product than he is entitled to? Are 
we leaving it for a few to carry the burden, increasing the over- 
head, or have we stopped to consider that the more we produce, 
the more we get, the more the manufacturer gets, the more the 
comjmunity gets? It is through co-operation and through produc- 
ing in abundance that we are blessed and not through individual 
effort, which often breeds a spirit of contention and strife. In many 
of our sections we have been blessed with canning factories and 
packing plants, in which the products of our farms may be put into 
a condition to find market elsewhere. They are a blessing to us, 
and aiso a curse, for I am afraid many who have garden plots are 
depending upon the can for their food, forgetting the home garden. 
Many fail to plant in the Spring that they may harvest during the 



164 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Summer to provide their families and those depending" upon them 
with good wholesome food, fresh from the soil. 

Let us support the canning factories, let us produce that they 
may prosper, for when they prosper we are bound to prosper; but 
let us not forget that there is a means of prospering- in our own 
household and through the opportunities God has given unto us. 
We find the spirit of contention, not with the majority, but with 
the few, and unfortunately sometimes we let the disturbing ele- 
ment be the dominating factor. Let us co-operate in our labors, 
and keep in mind the community interests. We have sugar fac- 
tories which have been a greater blessing to the farmers of this 
community than anything else that has come among us. All of 
these industries come to us to take the products of the farm and 
turn them into cash, and return that cash to us from an outside 
source, to provide means for our welfare and for the beautifying of 
our homes and to aid in the preaching of the gospel. All these are 
for our benefit and blessing, provided we acknowledge the hand 
of God and co-operate and work for the good of the community and 
forget our selfish interests. Selfishness has no place in this Church. 
We as individuals must, if we hope to succeed, if we hope to pros- 
per, if we hope to have the blessings of God continue with us, look 
to the welfare of our brethren. 

When the pioneers came here, they could see nothing but wil- 
derness, but that wonderful man, President Brigham Young, saw 
into the future, viewed the choice valleys and their possibilities, saw 
where water could be stored in the mountains until required and 
used as needed. God has provided for us abundantly and now we 
have discovered that he has provided something else for us, for 
we have the wonders of the world at our very door. People are 
coming in great numbers to rest in our scenic play grounds. Their 
impressions of us will be formed- through the appearance of our 
premises and by personal contact with us. Are we prepared to re- 
ceive them? Are our homes and surroundings inviting' and at- 
tractive? Are our lives such that when they come into our midst 
they can see our good works and go away with a feeling of praise 
and good-will toward us as a people? My brethren and sisters, 
what a wonderful opportunity has been given to us, what a won- 
derfully blessed people we are in having been gathered together in 
the valleys of the mountains, with all these wonders about us, and 
preserved and protected to this day. And now God is opening the 
way through which we may preach the gospel to those who are in 
darkness, without expending our means for that purpose, just by 
living as he would have us live, by precept and example, and by the 
appearance of our homes and our farms. Let us realize that God 
has blessed us abundantly. Let us turn to him in faith. Let us 
co-operate with one another that his kingdom may be built up in the 
earth and his people blessed as he has promised they would be 
blessed in the latter days. 

Let me call your attention to two passages of scripture : 



ELDER DAVID A. SMITH 



165 



"Verily I say unto you who have assembled yourselves together that you may 
learn my will concerning the redemption of mine afflicted people : Behold, I say 
unto you, were it not for the transgressions of my people — speaking concerning 
the Church and not individuals, they might have been redeemed now. But 
behold, they have not learned to be obedient to the things which I required at 
their hands, but are full of all manner of evil, and do not impart of their sub- 
stance as becometh Saints, to the poor and afflicted among them." (D. & C. 
105:1-3.) 

"Prepare thy work without, and make it fit for thyself in the field." * * * 
"I went by the field of the slothful, and by the vineyard of the man void of 
understanding; 

"And lo, it was all grown over with thorns, and nettles had covered the face 
thereof, and' the stone wall thereof was broken down. 

"Then I saw, and considered it well: I looked upon it and received in- 
structions. 

. "Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep ; 
"So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth; and thy want as an armed 
man." (Prov. 24:27-34.) 

God grant that we may receive and appreciate his blessings, 
I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 



ELDER JOHN WELLS 

Of the Presiding Bishopric 

I have enjoyed beyond measure the faith-promoting stories and 
testimonies concerning this great latter-day work, the manifesta- 
tions of the power of God, and the testimonies concerning the Book 

of Mormon. m , , . « • _ 

Eighteen hundred and ninety-four years ago— probably during 
the first week of April-our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ passed 
the last week of his mortal life. He had returned from a brief stay 
in Perca and at the close of the Sabbath arrived m Bethany with his 
disciples The following day, the first day of the week and known to 
us as Sunday, he entered the city of Jerusalem on an ass s colt. 

There were great numbers who had heard of his coming and 
he was hailed : "Hosanna: Blessed is the King of Israel that cometh 
in the name of the Lord." That day he returned to the little village 
of Bethany and the next morning— known to us as Monday— he 
evidently again walked to Jerusalem. Entering the temple, he 
found the Court of the Gentiles crowded- with those who sold ani- 
mals merchandise and who exchanged money. In the majesty 
of his power, he drove out all the people doing business, and said 
unto them, "My house shall be called the house of prayer ; but ye 
have made it a den of thieves." 

Again he returned to the little village of Bethany, and on the 
following day— according to those who have given deep thought and 
study to the life of the Master— he entered the temple once more 
for the last time, and here he delivered that remarkable series of 
reproofs to the scribes and Pharisees. 

In the evening, in the quiet little home of Simon and his lam- 



166 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



ily — Lazarus, Martha, and Mary — Mary anointed his feet, and it 
was then that he said that as long as his gospel shall be known the 
act of Mary will be remembered. 

The following day, Wednesday, he spent quietly with his dis- 
ciples on the Mount of Olives, gave them his last personal instruc- 
tions, explained to them some things he had said in the temple con- 
cerning the great events that would occur in the future and others that 
would occur before his second coming. 

On Thursday he asked his disciples to prepare for the Pass- 
over. Following the custom of the Galilean Jews,, he met in an 
upper room with his disciples, where he comforted their souls, ad- 
ministered to them what is known as the Last Supper, prayed to his 
Father to preserve and protect his disciples, and departed to the Garden 
of Gethsemane, where he was arrested. 

One of the outstanding features connected with the Church of 
Jesus Christ is that each person who has faith in God and who has 
sincerely repented of his sins and has been baptized for the remis- 
sion of his sins, having had hands laid upon his head for the gift of 
the Holy Ghost, mlay know the doctrine, whether it is of God, or 
not. Thousands and tens of thousands of Latter-day Saints can 
testify that this is the truth, that by obedience to this gospel they 
have received an inward witness that Jesus is the Christ, that the 
gospel has been restored, and that Joseph Smith is a prophet of 
God. This promise of a testimony is accorded to all people, even 
as many as the Lord our God shall call. 

Jesus had finished about two years of his ministry and was 
again laboring in his own province of Galilee, having been rejected 
in his own home of Nazareth. With his disciples he toured Galilee ; 
then, calling the disciples together, he sent them out to preach the 
gospel, giving them special instructions to go not to the Gentiles 
nor to the Samaritans, but rather to the lost sheep of the house of 
Israel. While they were away, the messengers came from John 
who was in prison, asking, "Art thou he that should come? or look 
we for another?" That day the Master healed the sick, gave sight 
to the blind, made the lame to walk, and when the day was over, 
he said to John's delegates, "Go your way, and tell John what things 
ye have seen and heard ; how that the blind see, the lame walk, the 
lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, to the poor 
the gospel is preached." They, no doubt, returned to John, and 
John was satisfied. A short time after, the Master heard that his 
forerunner had been beheaded, and he exclaimed, "Among those that 
are born of women there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptist: 
but he that is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he." 

His apostles returned and accompanied him to the east side 
of the lake of Galilee. He there labored and taught the people for 
three days, and his disciples suggested to him that the people would 
better be dismissed to get food in the neighboring villages. The 
Master said that he could not send them away for fear some would

faint, and asked how much bread and food they had. The disciples 
answered that they had a few loaves and fishes. Jesus told the 
disciples to seat the people in fifties and hundreds. Then he broke 
the bread and blessed it and passed it to his disciples, who dis- 
tributed it. Five thousand men, as well as women and children, 
were fed. One can imagine the excitement that followed. Here 
was a man who could give not only spiritual food, but could also 
feed their bodies. Well might they want to make him( a temporal 
king. 

He sent the disciples across the lake and .dismissed the multitude. 
In the night he walked across the water before his disciples had been 
able to land on the opposite side. They saw him but faintly 
in the early morning light and were sore afraid, but Jesus said 
unto them, "Be of good cheer; it is I ; be not afraid." Peter, im- 
petuous, bold, and a leader, asked the Lord if he could come, and 
was told that he could. He started to walk on the water, but the 
waves were rough and he called to the Lord to save him. 

Landing at Capernaum, he 'was met by people who had hur- 
ried around the end of the lake. There he tried to impress 
upon them that his kingdom was not of this world, that he had 
given them bread to feed their hunger, saying, "Labor not for the 
meat which perisheth, but for that meat which endureth unto ever- 
lasting life, which the Son of man shall give unto thee," and the 
multitude said unto him, "Lord, evermore give us this bread." 

The Master spoke so plainly that many of his disciples and fol- 
lowers discontinued following him. He then turned to his apostles 
and, addressing Peter, said : "Will ye also go away ?" and that good 
man responded, "Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast the words of 
eternal life. And we believe and are sure that thou art the Christ the 
Son of the living God." 

Jesus then moved away from Capernaum. The next we hear 
of him, he was on his way with his chosen disciples and probably 
a few of his close friends, in the direction of Caesarea Philippi. 
Perhaps he was dejected because of his inability to convince the 
people concerning his mission, and one of the gospel writers says 
that he went away to pray. No doubt the disciples stayed at a 
respectful distance. Then he returned and, addressing his disciples, 
said, "Whom do men say that I the Son of man am?" No doubt, 
each one answered the question in turn, "Some say that thou art 
Tohn the Baptist: some, Elias ; and others, Jeremiah, or one of the 
prophets." It was a common idea that Elijah would come before 
the great and dreadful day of the Lord, and they were looking for 
him to come before the Messiah. It was also understood among 
the Jews that Jeremiah had in his possession the Ark of the Cove- 
nant, that it was hidden in Mount Nebo, and would be placed back 
in the temple before the coming of the Messiah. 

Then Jesus turned to his disciples and said, "But whom say 



168 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



ye that I am ?" and then Peter, to whom the role of leadership had 
fallen, spoke — doubtless with the approval and concurring voice of 
his brethren — "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God." I 
can imagine what a comfort that would be to his Master to know 
that his disciples at least knew that he was the Christ, the Son of 
the living God. No doubt this testimony had been given by the 
Father to those twelve chosen men who were to be Christ's special 
witnesses and who were destined to carry his work and the mes- 
sage of the gospel to what was then known as the civilized world. 

Addressing Peter, the Master answered, "Blessed art thou, 
Simon Barjona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, 
but my Father which is in heaven. And I say also unto thee, That 
thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church ; and the 
gates of hell shall not prevail against it. And I will give unto thee 
the keys of the kingdom of heaven : and whatsoever thou shalt bind 
on earth shall be bound in heaven : and whatsoever thou shalt loose 
on earth shall be loosed in heaven." 

It is the desire and intent of c*ur Master, Jesus Christ, that all 
those who accept his doctrines and live according to his precepts, 
shall know his doctrine. At one time he declared, "My doctrine is 
not mjne but his that sent me. If any man will do his will, he shall 
know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak 
of myself." 

In Capernaum he said : "No man cometh unto me, except the 
father which hath sent me draw him ; and I will raise him up at 
the last day." To all who sincerely desire to find the truth and 
understand and accept it this is a promise, for they will know the 
truth, and he will draw them as he promised, and they will receive 
the testimony that is the outstanding feature of the gospel of 
Jesus Christ. 

It is our duty to pray to the Father for this testimony. It is 
our privilege to receive it, and no Latter-day Saint of years of dis- 
cretion need be without this testimony. In view of the great prob- 
lems that are arising in the world, I appeal to my brethren and 
sisters to see that there is taught to their children in the homes 
the story of the life and mission of Jesus Christ; also the story of the 
Prophet Joseph, and the restoration of the gospel through his in- 
strumentality, that there may grow into their hearts faith in the living 
God and a love for their fellow-men, that our young people will grow 
mighty in testimony and power to carry on this great work. 

I am thankful indeed for the gospel of Jesus Christ, for that 
testimony which has come to me. I am thankful for the privilege 
of laboring in the ministry, for the association I have with my 
brethren and sisters. May the Lord bless and sanctify this great 
gathering of Latter-day Saints that the influence felt here may go 
into all the homes of Zion, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen.

ELDER REY L. PRATT 

President of the Mexican Mission 

"Oh that my words were now written! Oh that they were printed in a 
book ! 

"That they were graven with an iron pen and lead in the rock forever ! 

"For I know that my Redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter 
day upon the earth : 

"And though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall 
I see God : 

"Whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall behold, and not another; 
though my reins be consumed within me." 

Many times in my life, my brethren and sisters, I have read 
this wonderful prediction of Job s and have marveled at it, and have 
been very greatly impressed by it. I think that in my study of 
the Scriptures nothing- else has so much impressed me as has testimony. 
Nothing else in the history of the Church to which we belong has so 
impressed me as have the testimonies given by the Prophet Joseph 
Smith. In reading his brief account of his life as given in the 
Pearl of Great Price, I turn back repeatedly and read over and over 
again, with added inspiration, the. wonderful testimony given in 
so simple a way concerning his vision. This good man, of whom 
I have read today, had been persecuted, he had been singled out 
and had suffered, and still he was able to testify, in an outburst, not 
of reason why, but to leave his testimony for the world, that not- 
withstanding all that had come, or that might come unto him, he 
knew that his Redeemer did in very deed live. And the Prophet 
Joseph Smith, strange as it might seem., inoffensive towards any 
human being, never having harmed his fellow-man, yet simply be- 
cause of the fact that he recounted that he had seen a vision, that 
he knew that God lived, that he had been visited by him and by his 
Son, he was singled out for persecution. He was invited to retract, 
and was assured that should he do so persecution would cease. But 
he testified in the simple words that he knew that he had seen a 
light, and that in the light he had seen two personages whom he 
knew to be God the Father and his Son Jesus Christ ; and further- 
more, he knew that God knew these things, and he dared not other 
than to continue to testify of this truth. And so he did testify, my 
brethren and sisters, to the day of his death, and sealed his testi- 
mony with his blood. 

In regard to the matter of testimony, I have concluded that 
those testimonies which have impressed me most have not been 
accompanied by reason why. They seem to carry with them their 
own conviction, and I verily believe-, my brethren and sisters, that 
they were given by the power of the Holy Ghost, and that same 
Spirit has witnessed to my spirit that they are true. 

It is a remarkable thing, when you review the life of Joseph 
Smith and the great work he brought forth and the wonderful 
things that he testified of. We heard in priesthood meeting a re- 



170 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



view of the coming forth of the Book of Mormon, given by Presi- 
dent Anthony W. Ivins, and of the wonderful things to which Jo- 
seph Smith attached his name — a document which set forth that 
there were once mighty cities upon this land, and those cities had 
not been discovered at that time, not even the ruins of them. He 
attached his name to the assertion that there had been a wonder- 
ful civilization upon this land, schooled in the arts and sciences, 
and he was even bold enough to affirm that the people worked in 
metal, of iron and steel. And he told of books written upon gold leaf, 
and that verily the book he translated was from engravings upon a book 
of gold leaf. And still Joseph Smith is not supposed to have known of 
the existence of anything in the world that would corroborate his 
statement at that time. We now find that those simple testimonies 
and statements are corroborated all the time by the findings of scientific 
men who are delving into the ruins of the country to the south of us, 
particularly. At last, steel instruments have been discovered on this 
continent, and they are attributed to the ancients who manufacured 
them and used them. 

The truth of these statements of the Prophet Joseph Smith has 
been borne in upon me, my brethren and sisters, as I have stood among 
these majestic ruins of Mexico and Central and South America. I have 
stood there and tried to imagine that the Book of Mormon was not true, 
but I have prayed that I might know of a surety for myself whether it be 
true or not. I want to tell you that in those solemn places, in those 
beautiful ruins, among majestic stones, larger than any I have ever 
seen in any other architecture of this modern day, I have had borne in 
upon my soul this truth that the Book of Mormon is true; that it is 
a new witness for God upon the earth, and that Joseph Smith was 
and is a Prophet of God. 

I have been impressed during this conference by the spirit of 
testimony. Tears have come to' my eyes more than once during 
this procedure because of the spirit of testimony that has come from 
the speakers to me. And I stand as a witness, my brethren and sisters, 
that these testimonies are true. 

We have spoken of the testimonies of great men in this Church. 
Now, the thought is, are they alone entitled to a testimony? Are 
they alone entitled to know whether there has been a restoration 
of the gospel or not? Are they alone entitled to know that God 
lives and that Jesus is the Christ? I think not. I think that the 
Savior has given us ample reasons to assume, by reason of his 
teachings, that all men, if they will comply with the" conditions up- 
on which a knowledge might come to them, may know of the truth of the 
doctrines that he taught, which are none other than the doctrines that 
Joseph Smith was an instrument, in the hands of God, in restoring 
to the people in this present day. They may know whether they 
be of God or whether they be of man. There are many people in 
the world — I know by contact with them — who would give a very 
great deal to be able to say that they know that the gospel is true ; 



ELDER REY L. PRATT 



171 



that they surely know, without shadow of a doubt, that God lives 
and that Jesus is the Christ. In the face of all the confusion and 
conflicting ideas that there are in the world, today, I know there 
are many honest-hearted people who would give a very great deal 
to be able to say what has been said in this conference by those 
who have spoken in regard to these things. But they do not know. 
How may they know? "If any man will do his will," says the 
Savior, "he may know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or 
whether I speak of myself." Are there any Latter-day Saints who 
are not in possession of a testimony in regard to these things? If 
there be such, I say unto them, as I have said to these men in the 
world, If you will put your lives in harmony with the principles of 
the gospel, as they have been restored in this age, and if you will 
humbly ask the Lord for a testimony concerning these things, he 
will bear witness unto you through the Holy Ghost, which you are 
entitled to have as a companion when you comply with the require- 
ments of the gospel, in unmistakable terms, that the gospel is true, that 
Joseph Smith is a prophet of God, that God lives, and that Jesus is the 
Christ, the Redeemer of the world. 

I admonish you, therefore, my brethren and sisters, to live 
humbly, to put your lives in harmony with the truth. We, as teach- 
ers, should possess this wonderful testimony, and we bear a won- 
derful responsibility in teaching it to our children, to our brethren 
and sisters, and to our friends in the world ; for all of those people, 
way out there, are our Father's children and heirs unto salvation, 
if they will but comply with the requirements of the law. We have 
a knowledge of the law and the conditions thereof, and we should 
teach them. There is a wonderful responsibility resting upon a 
teacher, my brethren and sisters. To those who assume to teach, 
in such a way as to destroy the faith of the youth of Zion, I tell you 
there is a terrible responsibility resting upon them. There is noth- 
ing that I would rather my children have than an implicit faith in 
God. Learning, riches, an influence in the world, or in the affairs 
of the world, do not compare with the great blessings of an abiding 
faith, and I wish to instill that, so far as God gives me power, in the 
minds of my own children. And so far as he gives me power, I shall 
testify, before the world, with an endeavor to instil that witness in- 
to the hearts of my fellow-men. 

I realize that the time is past. I am thankful unto the Lord 
for the privilege to participate in his work. I am thankful for the op- 
portunity of bearing my testimony to you. Of a surety I know 
that God lives, and I know that Jesus is the Christ, the Redeemer 
of the world. Of a surety I know that Joseph Smith was raised 
up to be an instrument in the hands of the Lord to restore to the 
world for the last time the great gospel of salvation. I know that 
the gospel is true, and, in the words of our beloved prophet, I know 
that God knows that I know these things, and I dare not other than 
testify of them.

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

The time has passed when we are supposed to dismiss, but 
there are a few things that I would like to say and I crave your 
indulgence while I do so. 

GROWTH OF THE CHURCH IN POWER AND TESTIMONY 

When I was made one of the apostles of the Church we did not 
have twenty stakes of Zion. We now have ninety-six, and we have 
voted to divide the Jordan stake, which will make ninety-seven, and 
to divide the Los Angeles stake, which will make ninety-eight, and 
to organize a new stake to embrace Oakland and San Francisco and 
vicinity, making ninety-nine stakes of Zion, or a little more than 
five times as many as there were when I was chosen to be one of 
the apostles. . 

Anybody who thinks the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints is not growing, is ignorant, to say the least. Zion is growing 
in power, strength and testimony. 

REGRET NO TIME TO HEAR FROM MORE STAKE PRESIDENTS 

I regret that we did not have the opportunity of hearing from 
at least a dozen more of our stake presidents. There are a dozen 
men who were ordained as far back as 1924, who have not yet had 
the opportunity of speaking in General Conference. But it seems 
that we can never quite get through, although we have had an extra 
meeting of two hours in (this conference. In addition, Brother Mc- 
Murrin, Brother Smoot, Brother Talmage and Brother Hyrum G. 
Smith are away. Somehow or other we never quite have time 
enough to hear from these presidents of stakes. Occasionally we 
hear from a few of them, but I would like to hear all of the ninety- 
six men, whom God has seen fit thus to honor, bear their testimony 
for a few moments before this congregation. I hope that we may 
hear from more of them next time. 

NEW STAKE TABERNACLE IN LOS ANGELES 

Speaking of the division of the Los Angeles stake, I have a tele- 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 



175 



gram from Leo J. Muir, the chairman of the tabernacle finance com- 
mittee, it having- been decided to erect a tabernacle, to be utilized 
by both stakes after the new one is organized : 

"Reports received this morning from the ward chairmen in- 
dicate tonight's total will reach $125,000 pledged for the Los 
Angeles stake tabernacle." 

I can remember when there were not a half dozen Saints in 
Los Angeles. The Church will match this $125,000 which has been 
pledged locally, so that there will' be in southern California quite a 
fine building, as a further evidence of the "decaying of the Church." 

OURS AN AMERICAN CHURCH 

There is one thing that 1 desire to emphasize, and that is that 
we are engaged in an American Church, born in the land of free- 
dom, born in fulfilment of prophecy. We believe and teach, and 
have taught from my earliest recollection that God has protected and 
fought on the side of America in all of the struggles we have had 
for liberty; that he was with Washington and his armies. We sus- 
tain and uphold the president of the United States and the officers 
of this great country. We rejoice in the wonderful response that 
has been made upon all occasions by the Latter-day Saints to calls 
for money and for men to fight the battles of our country, and in all 
things to sustain and uphold this country. 

TESTIMONIES AND WARNINGS ENDORSED 

I want to say that I endorse with all my heart the many splen- 
did remarks that have been made here. I rejoice in the virtue of 
the Latter-day Saints as a people. I endorse with all my heart, 
however, the warnings that have been given here. I have the most 
supreme and absolute contempt for men who are guilty of proclaim- 
ing that virtue should not be maintained; that there is no sin in 
sexual intercourse. It is the doctrine of devils. It is an inspira- 
tion from the devil himself, and the men who defend things of this 
kind are instruments in his hands to try to destroy virtue and to 
wipe from the earth liberty and right, and all that is of real genu- 
ine worth to humanity. 

CALL TO REPENTANCE OUR SUPREME OBLIGATION 

I want to emphasize that we as a people have one supreme 
thing to do, and that is to call upon the world to repent of sin, to 
come to God. And it is our duty above all others to go forth and 
proclaim the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ, the restoration again 
to the earth of the plan of life and salvation. Appeals are coming 
from all over the world for more missionaries. The Latter-day 
Saints should so organize their affairs, and so shape their finances, 
that more will be ready and willing, especially those of age and 
experience, with a testimony and knowledge of the divinity of this 
work, to go forth, not only on short, but on long missions. Too 
many of us are gradually setting our hearts upon the things of this 



176 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



world. We have so much to look after, so many business interests, 
so many important things, so far as dollars and cents are concerned, 
that we are neglecting the one great thing of all; namely, the 
proclaiming of the gospel, and making what people call sacrifices 
but what actually are the exact oppdsite. We have in very deed 
the pearl of great price. W e have that which is of more value than 
all the wealth and the scientific information which the world pos- 
sesses. We have the plan of life and salvation. The first great com- 
mandment was to love the Lord our God with all our hearts, might, 
mind and strength ; and the second was like unto it, to love our 
neighbor as ourselves. And the best way in the world to show our 
love for our neighbor is to go forth and proclaim the gospel of the 
Lord Jesus Christ, of which . he has ' given us an absolute knowl- 
edge concerning its divinity. 

God bless all of the Saints. God bless the president of the 
United States of America and his cabinet, and the governors of our 
states and the mayors of our great cities. And bless every honest- 
hearted man and woman upon the face of the earth, and give to 
those who seek for it (and he will) a testimony of the divinity of 
the work in which you and I are engaged. 

God bless and multiply the substance of the Latter-day Saints. 
May we cooperate for the advancement of the Church and for the 
advancement of this magnificent country that- God has given to the 
people who are located in it, is my prayer, and I ask it in the name of 
Jesus Christ, our Redeemer and Savior. Amen. 

The congregation sang, "Praise God, from whom all blessings 
flow." " 

The benediction was pronounced by President Anthony W. Ivins. 
The conference adjourned for six months. 



Professor Anthony C. Lund conducted the singing, assisted by B. 
Cecil Gates. Accompaniments and interludes were played on the great 
organ by Edward P. Kimball, Tracy Y. Cannon, Alexander Schreiner 
and Frank W. Asper. Stenographic notes were taken in the Tabernacle 
by Frank W. Otterstrom and Joseph Anderson, and in the Assembly 
Hall by Frederick G. Barker.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

I rejoice again to have the opportunity of meeting with the Lat- 
ter-day Saints in another general conference. I am very happy to see 
so many here at this, our opening session. I desire with all my heart 
that all that I may say during this conference, and all that is said by 
my associates who speak to you, shall be inspired of the Lord. I 
am grateful beyond expression for the rich outpourings of the Spirit 
of the Lord during our conferences that we have held since it fell to 
my lot to preside over the Church. I am free to confess that I ap- 
proached our June conference, and the other conferences that have 
been held here since my presidency, with fear and trembling. When 
I thought of the wonderful blessings of the Lord in the past at our 
general conferences and the inspiration to Brigham Young and those 
who have succeeded him, I desired with all my heart that there should 
be no falling off in the inspiration of the Lord to those who might 
address us, and earnestly supplicated him to this effect. And I am 
indeed grateful for the blessings that we have enjoyed, and I pray 
that that same blessing, that same rich outpouring of his Spirit may 
be given to all who shall speak to us during the sessions of this con- 
ference. 

A MAGNIFICENT GIFT TO THE CHURCH 

I received a letter last night that was very gratifying to me, and 
before making any remarks, I will read it : 

Salt Lake City, Utah, October 7, 1920. 
President Heber J. Grant and Council: 

Dear brethren: We desire to give to the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints our home on Miain and First North streets to 
be used preferably for the women's building, thus housing the three 
women's organizations, or for such other purpose as may be deemed best. 

Yours faithfully, 

(Signed) A. W. McCune, 

Elizabeth A. C. McCune. 

I remarked to one of the wealthy men of our Church, within the 
last forty-eight hours: "When you come to pass away don't leave all 
of your property to your family, but give a portion of it as an en- 
dowment for some good cause for the advancement of the work ol 
God." I have always regretted that those who have been abundantly 
blest of the Lord with the wealth of this world have failed to leave 
a part of it to some of our charitable institutions or our various or- 
ganizations. I believe that where a man is worth a half million dol- 
lars or even less, if he were to give a tenth or even a quarter of 
his means for some charitable purpose in this Church, the re- 
mainder that he left to his family would do them more good and they 
would have greater wisdom in handling it and would accomplish more 
than though all the wealth had been left to the heirs of the departed 
man or woman, as the case may be. My heart has gone out in grati- 
tude to the late Matilda M. Barratt for building us the splendid build-

ing known as the Barratt Hall, in the days of the adversity and fi- 
nancial hardships of our schools. And I pray God to bless Brother 
and Sister McCune'for this magnificent gift, and to multiply their 
substance.

THE SPIRIT OF HELPFULNESS 

This morning, after coming to my office, I happened to see lying 
upon my desk the first volume of what is known as Heart Throbs. 1 
had brought it from my home to have a couple of poems copied, several 
days ago, and as I looked at the book I remembered a poem in it that 
I decided to read here today : "I shall not pass again this way," is the 
title. Preceding the poem is the following note: 

(For several years before his death, Mr. Daniel S. Ford, the proprietor, 
editor and builder of the "Youth's Companion," because of delicate health, 
did his work and managed his mammoth business from a little room in his 
home in one of the beautiful parks of Boston. When loving hands cleared 
the plain, but convenient desk, there was found, in a conspicuous place, 
much worn with frequent handling, the following poem. If the poet had 
intended to describe Mr. Ford's daily words and actions, he could not 
have done so in more appropriate language.) 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



The bread that bringeth strength I want to give, 
The water pure that bids the thirsty live; 
I want to help the fainting day by day; 
I'm sure I shall not pass again this way. 

I want to give the oil of joy for tears, 

The faith to conquer crowding doubts and fears. 

Beauty for ashes may I give alway; 

I'm sure I shall not pass again this way. 

I want to give good measure running o'er, 
And into angry hearts I want to pour 
The answer soft that turneth wrath away; 
I'm sure I shall not pass again this way. 

I want to give to others hope and faith, 
I want to do all that the Master saith; 
I want to live aright from day to day; 
I'm sure I shall not pass again this way. 

I feel that every Latter-day Saint ought to have the same desire 
as Mr. Ford found expressed in this very beautiful poem. I am sure 
I have it in my heart this very day, as I stand before you. I feel, as 
expressed in the Psalms : 

Search me, O God, and know my heart; try me, and know my thoughts: 

And see if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way ev- 
erlasting.— 139:23, 24. 

The fear of the Lord is clean, enduring forever: the judgments of the 
Lord are true and righteous altogether. 

More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold: sweet- 
er also than honey and the honeycomb. — 19:9, 10. 

PAINED OVER POLITICAL AND FINANCIAL DIFFERENCES 

In speaking to a few friends the other day I made some remarks 
and as my secretary happened to be present to take notes, I decided 
to read what I said on that occasion: 

"I am anxious to see the Latter-day Saints devoted to the work of 
God above everything else in the world; and I have never been so 
pained in my life as I have been during the past few months over the 
conditions — political, financial, and otherwise — that we find among the 
people. The spirit of bitterness that seems to exist in the hearts of 
some true, faithful and honest Latter-day Saints, because of their dif- 
ference of ideas and opinions on business matters and political matters 
is very painful to me. I do hope and pray, with all my heart, that 
the Spirit of the Lord may come to the Latter-day Saints in great 
abundance ; that this spirit of almost hatred and animosity, that seems 
to be existing today among the people may disappear." 

THE LORD'S DEMAND 

In section 64:8-13, Doctrine and Covenants, we find the follow- 
ing: 

My disciples, in days of old, sought occasion against one another, and 
forgave not one another in their hearts, and for this evil they were 
afflicted, and sorely chastened: 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 



t 



Wherefore I say unto you, that ye ought to forgive one another, fo' 
he that forgiveth not his brother his trespasses, standeth condemned be- 
fore the Lord, for there remaineth in him the greater sin. 

I, the Lord, will forgive whom I will forgive, but of you it is re- 
quired to forgive all men; 

And ye ought to say in your hearts, let God judge between me and 
thee, and reward thee according to thy deeds. 

And he that repenteth not of his sins, and confesseth them not, then 
ye shall bring him before the Church, and do with him as the Scripture 
saith unto you, either by commandment or by revelation. 

And this ye shall do that God may be glorified, not because ye for- 
give not, having not compassion, but that ye may be justified in the eyes 
of the law, that ye may not offend him who is your Lawgiver. 

And in section 121 :45, 46, we read: 

Let thy bowels also be full of charity towards all men, and to the 
household of faith, and let virtue garnish thy thoughts unceasingly, then 
shall thy confidence wax strong in the presence of God, and the doctrine of 
the Priesthood shall distil upon thy soul as the dews from heaven. 

The Holy Ghost shall be thy constant companion, and thy sceptre 
an unchanging sceptre of righteousness and truth, and thy dominion shall 
be an everlasting dominion, and without compulsory means it shall flow 
unto thee for ever and ever. 

ILLUSTRATION FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE 

I have a very wonderful respect and regard for this quotation 
from page 240 of the Doctrine and Covenants. Some years ago a 
prominent man was excommunicated from the Church. He, years 
later, pleaded for baptism. President John Taylor referred the ques- 
tion of his baptism to the apostles, stating that if they unanimously 
consented to his baptism, he could be baptized, but that if there was 
one dissenting vote, he should not be admitted into the Church. As 
I remember the vote, it was five for baptism and seven against. A 
vear or so later the question came up again and it was eight for bap- 
tism and four against. Later it came up again and it was ten for 
baptism and two against. Finally all of the Council of the Apostles, 
with the exception of your humble servant, consented that this man be 
baptized and I was then next to the junior member of the quorum. 
Later I was in the office of the president and he said : 

"Heber, I understand that eleven of the apostles have consented 
to the baptism of Brother So and So," naming the man, "and that you 
alone are standing out. How will you feel when you get on the other 
side and you find that this man has pleaded for baptism and you find 
that you have perhaps kept himi out from entering in with those who 
have repented of their sins and received some reward ?" 

I said, "President John Taylor, I can look the Lord squarely 
in the eye, if he asks me that question, and tell him that I did that 
which I thought was for the best good of the kingdom. When a man 
holding the holy Priesthood of God goes forth to proclaim the gospel 
of the Lord Jesus Christ, to call the wicked to repentance; goes to 
proclaim that God lives, that Jesus is the Christ, that Joseph Smith was

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



a prophet of God, and that the gospel has been restored again to the 
earth, and that man in the mission home of the Church of Christ 
commits adultery, I can tell the Lord that he had disgraced this Church 
enough, and that I did not propose to let any such a man come back 
into the Church." 

"Well," said President Taylor, "my boy, that is all right, stay 
with your convictions, stay right with them." 

I said, "President Taylor, your letter said you wanted each one 
of the apostles to vote the convictions of his heart. If you desire me 
to surrender the convictions of my heart, I will gladly do it; I will 
gladly vote for this man to come back, but while I live I never expect 
to consent, if it is left to my judgment. That man, was accused before 
the apostles several years ago and he stood up and lied and claimed 
that he was innocent, and the Lord gave to me a testimony that he 
lied, but I could not condemn him because of that. I got down on 
my knees that night and prayed God to give me the strength not to 
expose that man, seeing that he had lied but that we had no evidence, 
except only the testimony of the girl that he had seduced. And I 
prayed the Lord that some day additional testimony might come, and 
it did come, and we then excommunicated him. And when a man can 
lie to the apostles, and when he can be guilty while proclaiming re- 
pentance of sin, I think this Church has been disgraced enough with- 
out ever letting him come back into the Church." 

"Well," repeated President Taylor, "my boy, don't you vote as 
long as you live, while you hold those ideas, stay right with them." 

A CHANGE OF HEART— THE SPIRIT OF FORGIVENESS 

I left the president's office. I went home. My lunch was not 
ready. I was reading the Doctrine and Covenants through for the 
third or fourth time systematically, and I had my bookmark in it. 
but as I picked it up, instead of opening where the bookmark was, it 
opened to : 

I, the Lord, will forgive whom I will forgive, but of you it is required 
to forgive all men; but he that forgiveth not his brother standeth con- 
demned before the Lord. 

And I closed the book and said : "If the devil applies for baptism, 
and claims that he has repented, I will baptize him." After lunch I 
returned to the office of President Taylor and I said, "President Tay- 
lor, I have had a change of heart. One hour ago I said, never while 
I live, did I expect to ever consent that Brother So and So should be 
baptized, but I have come to tell you he can be baptized, so far as I 
am concerned." 

President Taylor had a habit, when he was particularly pleased, 
of sitting up and laughing and shaking his whole body, and he laughed 
and said, "My boy, the change is very sudden, very sudden. I want 
to ask you a question. How did you feel when you left here an hour 
ago? Did you feel like you wanted to hit that man right squarely be- 
tween the eyes and knock him down?" 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 



7 



I said, "That is just the way I felt." 
He said, "How do you feel now?" 

"Well, to tell you the truth, President Taylor, I hope the Lord 
will forgive the sinner." 

He said, "You feel happy, don't you, in comparison. You had 
the spirit of anger, you had the spirit of bitterness in your heart to- 
ward that man, because of his sin and because of the disgrace he had 
brought upon the Church. And now you have the spirit of forgiveness 
and you really feel happy, don't you?" 

And I said, "Yes I do; I felt mean and hateful and now I feel 
happy." 

And he said: "Do you know why I wrote that letter?" 
I said: "No, sir." 

"Well I wrote it, just so you and some of the younger members 
of the apostles would learn the lesson that forgiveness is in advance 
of justice, where there is repentance, and that to have in your heart 
the spirit of forgiveness and to eliminate from your hearts the spirit 
of hatred and bitterness, brings peace and joy; that the gospel of 
Jesus Christ brings joy, peace and happiness to every soul that lives 
it and follows its teachings." 

LOVE AND FORGIVENESS 

And so he went on. I cannot remember all of the teachings, but 
he continued in this way, telling me that he could never have given 
me that experience, that he could not give to me a testimony of the 
gospel ; that I must receive that testimony for myself ; that I must 
have the right spirit come into my heart and feel it — the spirit of for- 
giveness, the spirit of long-suffering and charity — before there would 
any good come to me as an individual ; that by simply surrendering 
my will to his, and voting to baptize this man, I would never have 
learned the lesson that the spirit of joy and peace comes in the hour of 
forgiveness, and when our hearts are full of charity and long-suffering 
to those who have made mistakes. From that day to this I have re- 
membered those teachings. 

The Prophet of the Lord said : 

My boy, never forget that when you are in the line of your duty 
your heart will be full of love and forgiveness, even for the repentant sin- 
ner, and that when you get out of that straight line of duty and have the 
determination that what you think is justice and what you think is equity 
and right should prevail, you ofttimes are anything but happy. You 
can know the difference between the Spirit of the Lord and the spirit of 
the adversary, when you find that you are happy and contented, that you 
love your fellows, that you are anxious for their welfare; and you can tell 
that you do not have that spirit when you are full of animosity and feel 
that you would like to knock somebody down. 

I am reminded of one of the finest chapters in all the Bible (1 
Cor. 13) : 

Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not 
charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, 
and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove 
mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing. 

And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I 
give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing. 

Charity, suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not; charity 
vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up, 

Doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own. is not easily pro- 
voked, thinketh no evil; 

Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth: 

Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all 
things. 

Charity never faileth; but whether there be prophecies, they shall fail; 
whether there be tongues, they shall cease; whether there be knowledge, 
it shall vanish away. 

For we know in part, and we prophesy in part. 

But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part 
shall be done away. 

When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I 
thought as a child; but when I became a man, I put away childish things. 

For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face; now 
I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known. 

And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of 
these is charity. 

Many people imagine that charity is giving a dollar to somebody ; 
but real, genuine charity is giving love and sympathy, and that is the 
kind of charity that the apostle had reference to in this 13th chapter of 
First Corinthians. 

I remember that after that teaching given to me as a young man, 
as a boy, almost, by the President of the Church, I read this 
chapter about once a week for quite a while, then once a month for 
several months. I thought I needed it in my business, so to speak ; that 
it was one of the things that were necessary for my advancement. 

I remember that a year ago, here at the conference, I read a very 
splendid and wonderful song, the half of the first verse of which reads 
as follows: 

Let each man learn to know himself, , 
To gain that knowledge let him labor, 

Improve those failings in himself 

That he condemns so in his neighbor. 

The whole poem was published in the conference pamphlet. I 
quoted it some weeks ago, and was asked where one could get a 
copy, and again last Sunday, when I told some people that they could 
read it in next Saturday night's News. So I shall not take up your time 
by quoting the whole poem. I also quoted the four short verses from 
our hymn on page 66, a part of which reads as follows : 

Should you feel inclined to censure 

Faults you may in others view, 
Ask your own heart, ere you venture, 

If that has not failings too. 

I had not the slightest idea when I quoted these poems, that I 
would desire to quote from them again today ; but in view of the con- 



PRESIDENT HEBER L GRANT

demtiation and the spirit, almost, of animosity, and hate that seems to 
be manifested by some people among the Latter-day Saints, at the 
present time, regarding business and political affairs, I desire to em- 
phasize, with all the power of my being, the last verse of that little 
hymn, on page 66: 

Do not form opinions blindly, 

Hastiness to trouble tends, 
Those of whom we thought unkindly 

Oft become our warmest friends. 

EVERY MAN INNOCENT UNTIL PROVED GUILTY 

There are a great many people who believe that if a person is 
indicted, he is undoubtedly a criminal. There are very few people who 
stop to reflect upon the fact that when a Grand Jury finds an in- 
dictment against any man, it is seldom, if ever, the case that he is 
permitted to appear before the Grand Jury, or to have a representative 
there to state his case. The law itself provides — as I understand it — 
although I am not a lawyer — that every man shall be considered in- 
nocent until such time as he is proved guilty ; and no man is guilty, in 
the true sense of the word, of an offense, just because a Grand Jury 
finds an indictment against him. In criminal cases a man is to be con- 
sidered innocent unless the evidence against him shall be so conclusive 
that there is not even a reasonable doubt as to his guilt. Certainly 
Latter-day Saints ought to be as liberal in their judgments, as the 
cold law of the land; and certainly every man ought to be considered 
innocent in the estimation of the Latter-day Saints — particularly if 
that man is a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints and has devoted his life for the up-building of God's kingdom 
until such time as he has what is known as "his day in court." We 
can afford, I believe, to be as liberal as the cold law itself. 

I desire to repeat the last verse of that excellent hymn, which I 
learned thirty-five or forty years ago, when Francis M>. Lyman first 
sang it for me. I wrote it that very night, and learned it the next 
day. I would like every Latter-day Saint to apply the teachings of 
this splendid verse in his or her life, and if we do that I believe we will 
grow in love and charity; that the spirit of peace and happiness, that 
President Taylor promised me when I entertained the feeling of deter- 
mination to keep a man out of the Church, and the spirit of joy and 
peace which came to me, after the change of heart, will come to Lat- 
ter-day Saints: 

And in self-judgment, if you find 

Your deeds to others are superior, 
To you has Providence been kind, 

As you should be to those inferior. 
Example sheds a genial ray 

Of light, which men are apt to borrow, 
So first improve yourself today 

And then improve your friends tomorrow.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



REGRETS THAT THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS QUESTION IS IN POLITICS 

A year ago, at our conference, I expressed sincerely my regrets 
that bitterness was being engendered in the hearts of the Latter-day 
Saints, because what was known as the League of Nations had been 
injected into politics. I expressed my sincere regrets that this great 
document should ever have been made a subject for political dis- 
cussion. I felt that all people in these United States of America should 
approach the consideration of this great document, independent of 
party affiliation. I desire to express my regrets that, if anything, it is 
in politics more today than it was a year ago. 

I sincerely regret that what is known as the "sugar question" 
has been injected into politics, in this State of Utah. I feel in my 
heart of hearts that it has engendered bitterness, that it has created 
a great deal of animosity, and I think it is something that ought to 
have been eliminated from politics, and that all questions of that kind 
-:hould be settled by the interested people. I desire, beyond my power 
to tell, that there shall always be perfect harmony and perfect justice 
between the farmer and the sugar producer. I desire that all judg- 
ments by Latter-day Saints upon the course of men connected with 
any industry in this state, shall be withheld, at least, until there has 
been passed a final judgment by a court that has the right to pass up- 
on it. 

T wish to say to all Latter-day Saints: 

Judge not, that ye be not judged. For with what judgment ye judge, 
ye shall be judged; and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured 
to you again. 

KEEP THE COMMANDMENTS OF GOD 

I beg every Latter-day Saint to cultivate the spirit of charity, 
of long-suffering, and brotherly love. I say to all Latter-day Saints : 
Keep the commandments of God. That is my keynote speech, just 
those few words: Keep the commandments of God. Read the psalm 
that tells you not to fret your soul about the sinner. It is a magnifi- 
cent psalm to read. I thought some of reading it here to this congre- 
gation, but I have read so much that I am afraid you will get tired of 
the reading. Keep the commandments of the Lord. Be honest with 
God. Never fail to pay an honest tithing to the Lord, on every dol- 
lar that comes into your hands. "Oh but," says one, "the Church does 
not need it." You are right; you are correct. The Church does not 
need it, but the man who has made covenant with the living God to 
keep his commandments, and then does not keep them, he needs it. A 
man who is not honest with the Lord should repent and be honest with 
the Lord, and then the windows of heaven shall open and God will 
pour down upon the heads of the Latter-day Saints blessings, if they 
are financially honest with the Lord. Observe the Word of Wis- 
dom. Never indulge in those things that the Lord God Almighty, 
the Creator of heaven and earth, has told us are not good for man.

CONCLUSION 

I rejoice that we have national prohibition. I rejoice that many, 
even in. our own community, who were wrecks financially, almost 
wrecks spiritually, because of prohibition and the taking away of 
temptation, are making men of themselves today. I rejoice that pro- 
hibition — to my mind the greatest financial and moral blessing that 
has ever come to humanity: — has come to the people of the United 
States, and I hope and pray that it may soon come to every nation 
under heaven. 

I rejoice that the women have the franchise. I rejoice in all of 
the great and wonderful advancements that are being made for the 
benefit of mankind; and I rejoice, above all things, in a knowledge 
that God lives, that Jesus is the Christ, that Joseph Smith is a prophet 
of the true and living God ; that the Gospel of Jesus Christ, the plan 
of life and salvation, has been restored to the earth. I rejoice that 
you and I have a knowledge of that gospel ; and oh, may God help 
us to live it ; may he fill our hearts with charity, with love, with for- 
giveness, with the desire to serve him, and may we in very deed be 
Latter-day Saints, is my prayer and desire, and I ask it in the name 
of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

A duet, "I know that my Redeemer lives," was sung by J. R. 
Boshard and Elizabeth Evans. 

PRESIDENT ANTHON H. LUND 

I have listened with much attention to our President's remarks, 
and I hope that every heart will retain the good counsel he has given, 
and that all will remember it and make it the moving principle of 
their lives. 

KEY WORDS OF THE CONFERENCE 

Love and charity, forgiveness, and doing our duties that the Lord 
has laid upon us are the key words or the key 1 note to this conference. 
You who have had much experience in life know the truth of what 
the president has expressed. In our intercourse with one another it 
often happens that a word may displease us, or the act of our brother 
cause us to blame him, and, perhaps, enlarge upon what he has done 
until we make it almost a crime. We ought to be careful not to let 
anything like this cause bitterness and hatred in our hearts, for as the 
president read to us, the Lord will forgive whom he will forgive, 
but he commands us that we shall forgive one another. This is a 
beautiful principle. When we remember the relationship in which we 
stand to our heavenly Father and to his children we ought to practice 
the principle of charity toward one another. We generally love our 
own brothers and sisters, we are tender about what is said concern- 
ing them, we even feel anything said derogatory to their character to 
be almost the same as if it were said about our own. As we feel to- 



12 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



ward our own brothers and sisters, so we should likewise feel towards 
Dur brethren and sisters in the covenant and for all men. We should 
not let hatred enter our hearts. Let us forgive others their offenses 
'n the hope that we can have forgiveness for our own. 

BLESSEDNESS OF CHARITY AND FORGIVENESS 

The scriptures give us many examples of the blessedness of charity 
and forgiveness. I recall the story of David and Saul. Saul had 
learned that David had been anointed to become king of Israel. Al- 
though at one time he loved David, and David had been able with his 
singing and his harp to drive out the evil spirit from the old king, 
yet when the king heard of the destiny of his own house, that his son 
was not to rule in Israel, that the kingdom was to be given to David, 
his heart was filled with hatred. He took three thousand men and 
went down into the southern part of Palestine, among the mountains, 
hunting for David and the few followers he had with him, determined 
to kill him. Saul entered a cave where David and his associates were 
hiding. David knew the king had come to make him a captive and 
to take his life; yet he would not hurt Saul, because he was the 
anointed of the Lord. He cut off the skirt of Saul's robe and left the 
cave. In the morning when the king left the cave David cried to him 
and showed him what he had done. The king felt repentant for a 
little while. He knew he had been in the power of the man whose 
life he sought, and he acknowledged that David was more just than 
himself. He saw that David had not exercised the power he had to 
kill the one who sought his life. David felt reverence for the man who 
had been anointed by a prophet of God. I am sorry to say that Saul's 
good mood did not last long, but still there was a moment when he 
felt the power of forgiveness working upon him. 

SCRIPTURAL EXAMPLES 

Jesus in one of his parables tells about the servant that owed 
his master a great sum of money, so much that he could never pay 
it, but because of his pleading his master forgave him and let him go. 
When going from his master's house he met a man who owed him a 
very small amount. The servant that had been forgiven so much 
was not willing to forgive this other man the small amount that he 
owed, and being unable to pay the wicked servant cast him into prison 
until he could pay the debt. When the master heard of this unfor- 
giving man's act he called him back and measured out to him his 
punishment for being so hard-hearted and so ungrateful for the bless- 
ings he had received. 

Jesus taught his disciples how to pray, and one part of that 
prayer is, "Forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors." That 
is the principle. We all know how greatly we are indebted to our 
heavenly Father, and remembering this we ought to be willing to for- 
give all men their trespasses against us. 



PRESIDENT ANTHON H. LUND

CHRIST SET THE GREATEST EXAMPLE OF ALL 

Let us not entertain hatred against anyone, whether he is con- 
nected with the Church or not. That feeling ought not to be harbored 
in our breasts. Let us rather feel to imitate our great Master. He 
not only taught, as he did in the parable just related, the necessity 
and the importance of forgiving others as we want to be forgiven, but 
he showed forth this spirit in his life. When he was crucified at 
Golgotha — and it is said that the suffering of crucifixion is the keen-' 
est kind of torture — suffering intensely and knowing that he was in- 
nocent, and that those, for whom he had labored and desired greatly 
to save, had hung him on that accursed tree, he did not ask the Lord 
to take revenge upon them, but asked his Father in heaven, "For- 
give them, for they know not what they do." Just think of his ask- 
ing for their forgiveness when he was under such intense suffering 
on the cross ! There is the example for us. We must exercise 
charity for one another and avoid letting ill-feelings rankle in our 
hearts against any person. 

LET CHARITY DRIVE OUT BITTERNESS 

We have not the right to hate any of the creatures of God, but 
we have been commanded to love them, and also to forgive them if 
they have offended us. I believe that you can put this down as a 
principle, that to start with there are very few offenders who wilfully 
intend to offend, not having given full thought to their acts. They 
do something that offends us, and we at once feel offended and angry 
and, perhaps, we let it grow to that greater amount of anger that we 
call hatred. This should not be. Perhaps if we had spoken to our 
brother at once we would have learned that he did not really mean 
what we thought he did, and that we have become offended too hastily. 
Let us have enough charity for one another that we will not allow any- 
thing to be an offense to cause us hardness of heart. 

FORGIVENESS AND CHARITY BRING HAPPINESS 

I remember once I went with President Grant and two others of 
the apostles to investigate complaints against a certain bishop. Among 
those opposed to the bishop was a man who had much influence with 
the people. He and the bishop almost hated each other. We brought 
them together, they freely expressed their feelings and what had caused 
them. We acted as peacemakers, and when they saw their error, with 
tears in their eyes they clasped hands and forgave each other. It 
was a touching scene and joy filled all our hearts. After that the 
bishop was reconciled to his opposers. Now, brethren and sisters, 
those men felt happy afterwards. They felt that they had suffered foi 
a long time from something that they ought not to have borne in 
their hearts. As President Grant has told us, anyone who forgives 
his enemy or his brother what he has done against him feels joy ir. 
his heart and the spirit whispers that he has done the right thing. 



14 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Now, let us learn to have charity for one another, and carry it 
out in our every-day lives, and we will make life happy to ourselves 
and to our neig-hbors and our path will be much smoother. 

May the Lord help us to do our duties in all the different lines 
of work given us, and may we ever remember what we owe to our 
heavenly Father and try to show love to our brethren and sisters. 
I ask the Lord to help us in this matter, in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 

PRESIDENT CHARLES W. PENROSE 

I feel exceedingly thankful this morning for this great privilege 
of meeting with the Latter-day Saints, my brothers and sisters, once 
more in general conference. I have not fully known for a fact that 
T would be able to be here on this occasion. For several days past I 
have not been in my usual health and vigor, but thanks be to the 
Lord for this great blessing to me this morning. 

I have listened to words of life, eternal life, from the man who 
stands at the head of the Church to which we, most of us, if not all, 
belong. We have felt that the Lord has been with him in the instruc- 
tions which have been imparted, and that the same spirit and power 
which always belong to the leader of the Church have been with him 
in talking to us today, as they were in years that are past, from the 
days of President Rrigham Yioung to his successors in office down to 
the present moment. T cannot speak personally of the influence and 
power that attended the Prophet Joseph, whom God raised up when 
a youth to open up the latter-day dispensation — but I am familiar 
with his words that have been recorded, that have been published, 
and that are contained in the history of the Church and in many 
manuscript documents which the Church possesses. But I know that 
the same spirit that burned in his soul, and with which he inspired the 
Saints of God who were placed under his direction, has been with 
us right down to the present time since, his martyrdom. 

THE SPIRIT OF LOVE AND CHARITY, THE SPIRIT OF THE GOSPEL 

This morning I feel that that spirit is here in great power, and 
the words that have been spoken to us have been given to us in 
great plainness. We can all understand them, and we can appreciate 
the spirit by which they have been delivered. The spirit of love 
and charity is the spirit of the gospel. This is what Christ breathed. 
That is what his apostles carried with them except on occasions when 
they became a little dissatisfied with each other, and spoke against 
each other. Even Paul, the great apostle, as we call him because 
he wrote so much, dissented with Peter and boasted that he had 
charged him to his face with doing something that he thought was 
wrong; and yet Paul himself comjmitted the same kind of error, if it 
was an error — of course it was not — in regard to Timothy and in re- 



PRESIDENT CHARLES W. PENROSE 



15 



gard to other matters that came before his attention. Later he ar- 
rived at the position that "to a Jew he was a Jew ; to the Greek he 
was a Greek ;" and he became "all things unto all men, that he might 
win some unto Christ;" yet for one little act not in variance with 
that, he found fault with Peter. But that is only a side question. The 
apostles of old, as we have heard this morning from the revelation 
that President Grant has read, differed from each other sometimes ; 
and they found fault with each other; but, as the Lord said, the great 
fault was that they did not forgive each other "in their hearts." 
They might do it with their lips and by the clasping of their hands, 
but they did not forgive each other in their hearts, and therefore 
"they were sorely afflicted." 

LET US FORGIVE IN OUR HEARTS 

Now, Latter-day Saints, let us take that lesson to our hearts. If 
we are offended with any one, if we feel that somebody has grieved 
us or oppressed us, done us some wrong, let us forgive them in our 
hearts, if we want to be called saints of the Most High and so re- 
garded by the powers on high. It is in the soul of man where this 
feeling of charity should prevail, which is not merely the kind of 
charity that is shown forth in giving alms to the poor, or anything of 
that kind. That is only a very small manifestation. It is the spirit 
of brotherhood, the spirit of kindness, the spirit of forgiveness in our 
hearts, that we must entertain, towards one another, that counts. I 
have had considerable experience in high councils, in the course of 
my activities in the Church, and I have seen people who were re- 
quired to forgive one another arise and shake hands, and then go forth 
with the same spirit of bitterness in their souls that they had in the 
beginning, so that their feelings of repentance and charity were not 
genuine and did not count. 

I remember one particular case that occurred, not a thousand 
miles from Salt Lake, when two brethren engaged the high council 
a whole week in settling a difficulty about sheep. We used to have 
a great many difficulties on the sheep question. After we had spent 
all that time in regard to it a certain division was made and a con- 
clusion arrived at by the high council. Fifteen men, all desirous of 
doing right, having no personal interest in the matter except to do 
right, the Presidency and the High Council together, made a de- 
cision, and the brethren who had quarreled so much were required 
to shake hands in agreement over the decision, which they did. At 
the closing of the meeting one of them said to the other; "Well, I will 
shake hands with you ; I will forgive you, but I will have them there 
sheep in the resurrection, with interest !" 

THE DOCTRINE DECLARED BY THE LORD 

I wish to read a little scripture contained in the same writings 
from which President Grant read this morning. Christ's remarks 



16 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



in regard to judging are to be found in the 7th chapter of Matthew. 
"Judge not, that ye be not judged," that is in the first verse. I advise 
my friends here to read the whole of the discourse, so far as it re- 
lates to that matter; and now I want to read just a verse or two from 
the eighteenth chapter of Matthew : 

Moreover, if thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and tell him 
his fault between thee and him alone; if he shall hear thee, thou hast 
gained thy brother. 

But if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or twa more, that 
in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established. 

And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the Church: but if he 
neglect to hear the Church, let him be unto thee as a heathen man and 
a publican. 

You know the publicans in those times were tax collectors, and 
they were not very popular, any more than they are now, most of 
them. 

This is the doctrine enunciated by the Lord Jesus Christ when 
on earth, and that is now established in the Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints. It is another side to this question, perhaps, a 
little. The principle expressed to us this morning by President Grant 
and President Lund is what we need to carry away in our hearts 
from this conference. It is a key-note to our services, just as Brother 
Lund said. I have felt that, and I appreciate these things that have 
been said by the President more because of the opportunity that I 
have had for a few days past of thinking over matters when I was 
awake. I was asleep about half the time, but while I was awake the 
very passages that he has cited here, and some of the hymns that he 
has referred to, have passed over my mind and I have felt in my soul 
that this is the word to be carried to all Israel — the spirit of charity 
and brotherly love, which promotes real union. We must not become 
divided in our souls, in our spiritual natures, in our intercourse with 
each other. We may hold different views of certain matters that I 
will not even allude to here this morning, but that should not affect 
our brotherhood, our real sentiments of kindness and of charity to- 
wards each other, and it should not affect us when we attempt to 
pass judgment and have no right to do it. 

PASSING JUDGMENT ON OUR NEIGHBOR 

There is the point I want to draw your attention to. We Hot 
only want to entertain this spirit of kindness and charity, but even 
when we think certain persons have done something that is wrong, and 
that it affects us — "When thy brother trespasseth against thee," — as 
Jesus puts it, have we the right to pass judgment upon him., even in 
our minds? No we have not. The principle of justice and of mercy 
together will say : "Let that man stand uncondemned until he can 
defend himself." The stream of accusation is frequently very shal- 
low, and underneath it sometimes He dark purposes, and they are 



PRESIDENT CHARLES W. PENROSE 



17 



revealed when the person is placed on his defense and has the oppor- 
tunity of explaining. As I say in one of my little songs : 

School thy feelings; 

Condemnation never pass on friend or foe, 
Though the tide of accusation 

Like a flood of truth may flow. 

Hear defense before deciding, 

Aiid a ray of light may gleam, 
Showing thee what filth is hiding, 

Underneath the shallow stream 

The Lord has provided in his Church that justice shall be done, 
but it does not exclude mercy, of course. We have a splendid illus- 
tration of the exercise of mercy in that case that Brother Grant has 
told us about, in regard to what President John Taylor taught him. 
But people say sometimes when aggrieved: "If that is 'Mbrmonism' 
I don't want to have anything to do with it." What a foolish thing. 
Does "Mormonism" in any respect condone iniquity? Does it approve 
of oppression? Does it approve of injustice? Does it approve of one 
man doing wrong to another in any way, without recompense and 
making it right? It does not. People sometimes say, "Well, if that 
is what the Church allows I am not going to church." Oh, what folly 
— not going to church? Are you going to hurt yourselves? You hurt 
yourself when you do not fulfil the requirement of God to go up to 
the house of prayer on the Lord's day, as he has commanded. You 
hart yourself if you hold the Priesthood of the living God and you 
do not attend your quorum meetings and observe the duties that be- 
long to you, you are^ of fending yourself, you are doing harm to your- 
self. The Church has got so big now and so powerful, financially 
and otherwise — although it is pretty well up to the mark now in its 
finances' — yet it has advanced so far that it can do without you or me 
or anybody else. When we neglect a duty we neglect something 
that benefits ourselves, and we are the worse for it. So much for 
that. 

THE CHURCH PROVIDES FOR HEARING WHERE JUSTICE IS DONE 

But the Church supplies the means whereby everybody who is 
oppressed or trespassed against can receive a hearing, and get justice 
done. In what I have cited the Lord lays down the principle, and 
we have that embodied in the organization of the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints. We have a body of men who go from 
house to house to visit the Saints. We call them teachers. Well, 
they are, but this belongs to the duty of the priest, as you will read 
in the twentieth section of the Doctrine and Covenants. The priest's 
duty is to preach and teach and expound and baptize and to "visit 
the house of each member, and exhort them to pray vocally and in 
secret, and attend to all family duties," and so on. That is his duty. 



18 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



In addition to that the Lord says the teacher's duty is to watch 
over the Church and be with the Church always, and to see that there 
is no iniquity in the Church, neither hardness of heart, nor evil speak- 
ing. Why is it a sin? Because the great body of the people have 
been into the house of the Lord, and they have made a covenant that 
they will not speak evil of the Lord's anointed, have they not ? Take it 
to hea'rt ! Are we not under a covenant with the Lord that we will 
not speak evil of his anointed? Well, when we do that we break that 
covenant. We sin against that commandment of the Lord. So we 
should not do it .But some may say, "Well, I have a reason for it." 
Well, if you have a reason, do as Jesus says. Here are persons ap- 
pointed in the Church who will go with you to the individual that has 
trespassed' against you, or if you will do your duty properly you will 
begin by going to that person alone. 

THP PLAN TO BE PURSUED 

I have heard some awful things said about mighty good men in 
this Church, men of influence and 'authority and power in the 
Church. I have heard shameful things about them, said unwittingly, 
perhaps, but very disgracefully. Have persons who used such lan- 
guage gone to the individual who, they think, has been oppressive 
to them, or has done them harm or trespassed against them, — and 
talked the matter over with him alone? No, oh, no, oh, no. They 
have said, "He ought to be in the penitentiary." Well, that is not 
the right kind of talk for a Latter-day Saint, and especially for an 
elder in Israel, a bishop's counselor, or a high councilor, very wrong 
indeed in its nature. Here is the plan: If any man has trespassed 
against you, go to him in the spirit of kindness because you want 
the thing put right, and explain to him where you think he 
has done you a wrong, and see whether he has done you a 
wrong or not , or whether you may not be mistaken. But 
if you will not do that, which is the great commandment, 
then get the teachers, or men that are acting as teachers, two 
of them, to go with you and see him, talk it over and find out what 
the ftfcts are in the matter, and see if you cannot be reconciled with 
your brother. If you can, then the Lord says you have "gained your 
brother." He may repent, if he has done wrong, or he will explain, 
or have the opportunity of explaining where he is right. Now, let 
us apply that to present conditions and circumstances, and do not 
go away and repeat these things again. Do not speak evil of your 
brother ; become reconciled to him if you can, and if you cannot, 
why, get some wise man to go with you and talk it over. What then ? 
Well, if he does not see it as you do, but insists that he is in the 
right and you are in the wrong, what is the next step? Why, there 
is a court, we call it a bishop's court. The bishop, who is a common 
judge in Israel, by appointment, the bishop and his counselors can 
meet together as a court, and they can hear you and your witnesses, 



i 



PRESIDENT CHARLES W. PENROSE 



19 



if you have any, and then they will hear the accused man or woman, 
as the case may be, and hear his or her witnesses, then judge the mat- 
ter, and if satisfaction is not had, even in that court, Which is usually 
sufficient, or should be, because honest men, good men, are chosen 
to act in the bishopric, — the Lord bless them ! Some of them do not 
know quite as much as they might know if they had had more ex- 
perience, but they are honest men and wise men, and they are placed 
there by their brethren who have chosen them, and they have had 
the support by the lifting up of hands of the people. Now, if justice 
does not seem to be had by them, then what? Why, there is a High 
Council, composed of the presidency of the stake and twelve high 
priests, good mien, honorable men, men of experience men of character, 
all members of the Church, all men holding the priesthood of the 
Lord, and they have that appointment; they are established, they are 
high priests in Israel and they are set apart for that purpose. They 
meet together and they will see that justice is done. If it is necessary 
for the case to be brought before that body an opportunity is had for 
the accuser and for the accused ; and that full justice may be done, 
the Lord has appointed that half of that council shall stand up for 
the accuser and half for the accused, not that they should be biased 
either on one side or the other, but so that right may prevail. 

I know from experience in these matters that the brethren who 
are organized in these councils are men of honor and integrity and in- 
fluence in the Priesthood, ajul they will not judge a matter before they 
hear it. When the whole matter is heard, then the president of the 
council and his counselors together talk the matter over and make up 
the decision as they consider in justice and righteousness before the 
Lord, and present it to the council. If a majority of the council 
agree with them it stands. 

AN APPEAL MAY BE MADE 

An appeal can be made, if it is claimed that injustice is done, 
to the Presidency of the Church, who do not sit as a court, to hear 
witness, but go over all the evidence as presented and at- 
tested by the clerk, to see if there is any wrong and mistake made, 
any injustice done, and if so, that they can point out the means, as 
provided in Section 107 of the Doctrine and Covenants, how the mat- 
ter can be fully determined and heard again, if they so decide, and 
that the matter can be so looked into that every point, every part and 
every item of the decision can be questioned and examind, and a con- 
clusion arrived at as to its justice and righteousness. 

UNSAFE TO FOLLOW A RUMOR 

But is anything of that kind being done in the cases which have 
been referred to here this morning? Not at all. What are you doing? 
Following a rumor, a most unsafe thing to do. A certain rumor gets 
out that certain things have been done, and people think they know 



20 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



they are true, because of circumstances that arise ; but they do not get 
the other side, they do not pay any attention to it, and if anybody 
seeks to put forward the other side, it is said : "Oh, yes, you stand 
up for him of course." That is the spirit that is manifested. Now, 
we want to do away with that, and therein is the great lesson of this 
morning to me and to all of us, I hope. The Lord has given us the 
way and the means to settle our difficulties and differences in the 
Church, and so, as the old apostles taught us, the Latter-day apostles 
teach : "Don't go to law with your brother, if it can be avoided by 
taking the matter before the courts of the Church, or to a court of 
arbitration composed of persons chosen on either side, who can arbi- 
trate the matter in the right spirit. There are certain kinds of cases, 
like cases for the settlement of titles to land, that cannot be settled 
that way; they are outside of this jurisdiction. But the whole of our 
gospel and our teachings and our influence is ecclesiastical. We may 
say it is temporal as well as spiritual. Certainly : our Church embraces 
the temporal and the spiritual together, as the Lord does, and the au- 
thorities of this Church, in their station, preside over the whole 
Church, in all of its ramifications — the nlost beautiful and splendid 
and perfect organization on the earth. 

LET US POSSESS OURSELVES IN PATIENCE 

Now, let us take to heart the lessons of this morning, brethren 
and sisters. Do not, during this coming campaign, — I allude to it 
just simply in that way ; I do not want to talk politics, or to have it 
said I have been talking politics, — but in this coming campaign possess 
yourselves in patience, and do not abuse or misrepresent any other 
person or party. You have no right to do it. I do not care how 
strong a partisan you may be on your own side, you have no right to 
misrepresent the other. You have no right to lie about it or about 
them. You have no right to commit any kind of injustice. Tell the 
truth as you understand it before the Lord, but not the whole truth, 
if that truth includes abusing the other party. Do not misrepresent 
what other people believe, and say a certain party believes this. Do 
not do that. Tell them what you believe, if you want to tell them 
what you understand; make clear and plain the truth as it appears to 
you, and do not find fault with and abuse or misrepresent others, 
either parties or persons. Is that politics ? Call it what you like, 
it is the truth, it is the gospel. Jesus Christ, in the same discourse that 
we have heard about this morning, told his apostles to "seek first the 
kingdom of God and his righteousness — not "its," as we quote it 
sometimes, but seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, 
and all these temporalities that he was talking about shall be added 
unto you. How do we find out about the righteousness of God that 
we are to seek for in the gospel? The Apostle Paul, writing to the 
Romans, I believe, said : "I am not ashamed of the gospel of Jesus 
Christ, for it is the power of God unto salvation, unto every one that 



PRESIDENT CHARLES W. PENROSE 21 



believeth ; for therein is the righteousness of God revealed, from faith 
to faith." 

SOME DUTIES OF THE SAINTS 

Study the gospel, live the gospel. Seek to God, that you may 
understand his word, his righteousness, and pattern after it as you 
go on from faith to faith, and put away from your souls everything 
of the kind that has been spoken against this morning, but be filled 
with the spirit that cometh from above ; for God is love, and his 
tender mercies are over all his works. He loves us, and will lead 
us and will save us if we will keep his commandments and walk in 
his ways, and the time will come when we will meet together in his 
eternal presence, and all that belongs to us we shall get, everything. 

Now, let us forgive one another, in our hearts, if any offenses 
have been made, and proceed from this conference determined to carry 
that spirit wherever we go. And men who are in authority, presid- 
ing authorities, bishops, and all the brethren who hold the Priest- 
hood, who labor among the Saints, carry that spirit with you where- 
ever you go, and do not listen to evil things against your brethren, but 
speak of all the best you can. God bless you all in the name of 
Jesus Christ. Amen. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

I am grateful beyond expression that President Penrose has been 
able to speak to us. He has been at home, sick abed, most of the time 
during the last week. 

I will state that a general music committee has been selected, and 
will undoubtedly be sustained at our conference, with Elder Mc 
J. Ballard as the head of that committee. 

The congregation sang, "Come, come ye Saints." 
The closing prayer was offered by Elder Lewis Anderson, Presi- 
dent of the South Sanpete stake of Zion. 



AFTERNOON SESSION 

President Heber J. Grant presided and called the congregation to 
order at 2 o'clock. The house, both in the auditorium and galleries, 
was comfortably filled with representatives from all parts of the 
Church. 

The congregation sang, "Do what is right." 

Prayer was offered by Elder Edward C. Rich, President of the 
Montpelier Stake of Zion. 

The congregation sang, "Guide us, O thou great Jehovah."

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



PRESIDENT RUDGER CLAWSON 

My brethren and sisters, you will pardon me if I look straight 
ahead and do not turn to the right or to the left ; it is the only way. 

I was profoundly impressed by the stirring exhortation and testi- 
mony of President Grant this morning, which was strongly emphasized 
and reinforced by remarks of the brethren who followed. Surely it was 
a keynote address. We have received the word and we would do well 
to give heed to it. 

NATURE OF FORGIVENESS 

Forgiveness is one of the most attractive and beautiful principles 
of the gospel of Christ. You know Moses said : "The Lord is merciful 
and gracious, slow to anger, and plenteous in mercy." He is a God 
of mercy and of forgiveness and is long-suffering. We should be like 
him. Do you know that what some people call forgiveness is not al- 
ways forgiveness. "Yes," says one who has been wronged, "I'll for- 
give but not forget." I am reminded of the story of the two darkies, 
Rastus and Sambo. These darkies were at enmity all their lives. There 
was a great feud between them until Sambo came to his death-bed, and 
a friend said to him : "Sambo, in this solemn moment, surely you 
will forgive Rastus." Sambo said, "Yes," and turning to Rastus re- 
marked, "Rastus, if I dies you are forgiven, but if I lives, look out for 
me." Another illustration. One friend said to another: "Do you 
love your enemies ?" He answered : "No sir, but I sympathize with 
therm." "Well, I did not know they needed sympathy." "They don't," 
he said, "but they will when I get through with them." Remember, 
the admonition is, seek diligently faith, hope and charity, but the great- 
est of these is charity. 

THREE EVILS EXTANT IN THE WORLD 

I would like to speak for a few moments today upon the subject 
of three evils that are extant in the world at large and which have 
also crept into our community, in some places in a greater degree, in 
other places in a lesser degree ; but they are here neverthelss, and oh, 
what a triumvirate of evils ! I allude to profanity, the tobacco evil, and 
the bondage of debt. 

SACREDNESS OF THE NAME OF GOD 

You will remember that the Lord spoke to Moses upon one occa- 
sion and said to him that he was about to come down and manifest 
himself to his people.. Moses was instructed to sanctify the people 
that they might meet the Lord, to take two days for this important 
duty and on the third day the Lord would come down. This is what 
the record says of that manifestation of majesty and power: 



PRESIDENT RUDGER CLAW SON 



23 



And ft came to pass on the third day in the morning, that there wers 
thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the voice 
of the trumpet exceeding loud; so that all the people that was in the 
camp trembled. 

And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet with 
God; and they stood at the nether part of the mount. 

And Mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke, because the Lord de- 
scended upon it in fire: and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a 
furnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly. 

And when the voice of the trumpet sounded long, and waxed louder and 
louder, Moses spake, and God answered him by a voice. 

And so the Lord descended upon Mount Sinai and revealed him- 
self in power to the children of Israel and spoke to them, but I would 
like to say to you, that this great demonstration of the power of 
God, which must have been exceedingly impressive, was nothing, in my 
judgment, compared with the words which the Lord spoke upon that 
occasion. Remember, the thunders passed away, the lightnings ceased 
to flash, the earth trembled no more, but the words that were spoken 
have come thundering down through the ages and are known to us 
as the Decalogue, and these words, mark you, are binding today upon 
the children of Israel, and upon the whole world. 

Now, the first of these commandments was exceedingly impress- 
ive. The Lord said : "Thou shalt have no other gods before me. 

"Thou shalt not bow thyself to them, nor serve them : for 1 the 
Lord thy God am a jealous god." 

In the commandments that followed, the Lord made reference to 
the sacredness of the Sabbath day. He spoke in regard to the attitude 
of parents to children, that children should honor their parents. He 
-poke against the evil of killing, of stealing, of adultery and of bear- 
ing false witness. He also said: 

Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain; for the 
Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain. 

I remind you, brethren and sisters, that there are two great Priest- 
hoods in the Church of Christ. One is the Aaronic Priesthood, the 
other is the Holy Priesthood after the order of the Son of God, but 
out of respect and reverence to the name of the Supreme Being, to 
avoid the too frequent repetition of his name, they, the Church, in 
ancient days, called this Priesthood after Melchizedek. Melchizedek 
was a great high priest. He is spoken of as having been the king of 
Salem and the prince of peace. He must have been a great and good 
man, and surely he was highly honored in having the Priesthood 
named after him. But it was primarily for the purpose, mark you, 
of avoiding the too frequent use of the name of Deity. Jesus, during 
his ministry, emphasized this matter of profanity. It had his atten- 
tion, he took notice of it, and thus he spake to his disciples and to 
his people : 

And again ye -.rave heard that it hath been said by them of old time, 
thou shalt not forswear thyself but shalt perform unto the Lord thine 



24 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



oaths: but I say unto you, swear not at all; neither by heaven," for it is 
God's throne; nor by the earth, for it is his footstool; neither by Jeru- 
salem, for it is the city of the great king. Neither shalt thou swear by 
thy head because thou canst not make one hair white or black. But let 
your communictaions be yea, yea, and nay, nay, for whatsoever is more than 
these cometh of evil. 

Now brethren and sisters, we learn from these scriptures that 
the name of God is very sacred, and that it ought not to be used 
lightly. We have been told many times that even in our sermons it 
should not often be spoken, neither ought it to be used very much 
in our prayers. If that be the case, what shall we say of the man, 
and particularly if he be a man holding the Priesthood, if he takes 
the name of the Lord in vain ? The Lord has said he shall not be held 
guiltless, he must answer for it. You do not hear profanity every- 
where, you do not hear it in all places, but now and then, in various 
sections of the Church, you will hear the name of the Lord profaned. 
It is a great sin. It is a serious evil and the man, (and I might 
say also the woman) who is guilty of this fault hath need of re- 
pentance. 

TOBACCO IS NOT GOOD FOR MAN 

I would like to say a word or two upon the subject of the tobacco 
evil. This matter is before us. You know the slogan of the Young Men's 
organization, in fact, of all the auxiliary organizations of the Church, 
is that we stand for the non-use of tobacco, because we regard it as 
detrimental to the health and welfare of the people of God, and also to 
the people of the world if they would but recognize the fact. It is an 
evil wherever you find it. Especially so among the Latter-day Saints, 
because, we have the word of the Lord upon the subject. 

How very kind and merciful the Lord is that at almost the be- 
ginning of the Church, he should give us to know as a people, what 
is good for us and good for our bodies, good to eat and good to drink. 
He mentions various articles. You are familiar with them. We verily 
know, that the things which the Lord has said are goodTor us are good. 
We have proved it in times past. Every man knows it, every woman 
knows it, and the children are going to know it as they get knowledge. 
Bread is the staff of life. Water is a pure beverage from heaven, you 
might say. It comes from the earth but it might just as well come 
down from heaven. It is so harmless and so fine for the human sys- 
tem. We should eat the things that are good for us in reason, spar- 
ingly, especially in the use of meat. We must not go to excess, in 
the use of that article and if we eat it largely, to any extent, it should 
be in times of cold weather. Now the Lord has declared in positive 
language that no one needs to err, no one needs to go astray in this 
matter. He has said it in plainness and simplicity. He does not say 
bread and water are not good for the body, but he does say tobacco is 
not good for the body. It is not good even for sick cattle except 
to be used outwardly for bruises and so on, and I feel sure that if 



PRESIDENT RUDGER CLAW SON 



25 



tobacco, or tobacco juice was administered regularly, to an animal, 
say, a cow or a horse, if it had been healthy before it would be 
terribly sick thereafter. We are admonished to refrain from the use 
of this article and other things that are hurtful to the body. We should 
put them aside and pass them by. In this connection, it would be 
well to rememlber that a great and glorious blessing goes with the ob- 
servance of the Word of Wisdom. The Lord has told us clearly and 
strongly what would follow. "All saints," he says, "who remember to 
keep and do these sayings, walking in obedience to the commandments, 
shall receive health in their navel and marrow to their bones, and 
shall find wisdom and great treasures of knowledge, even hidden treas- 
ures. They shall run and not be weary; they shall walk and not 
faint." Yea, the Lord giveth a promise that the destroying angels 
shall pass them by as the children of Israel and not slay them. 

But aside from this promise, it ought to be the good pleasure of 
the Latter-day Saints to honor this commandment because it is from 
the Lord. He has spoken and we ought to listen and give heed to his 
word. Tobacco is particularly hurtful to young people, to the boys, 
many of whom fall into the habit of smoking cigarettes. They know 
not what they are doing. It may result in irreparable damage to them 
all through their lives. Listen to what Thomas A. Edison, the great 
inventor, says upon this subject. He says: "The injurious agent in 
cigarettes comes principally from the burning paper wrapper. The 
substance thereby formed is called 'Acrobin.' It has a violent action 
on the nerve centers, producing degeneration of the cells of the brain 
which is quite rapid among boys. Unlike most narcotics, this de- 
generation is permanent and uncontrolable. I employ no person who 
smokes cigarettes." 

If any of your boys are using cigarettes, you ought to take instant 
notice of it, and exert every power and every influence within your 
means to get them to overcome the habit. 

Another word upon the subject. In the Unpopular Review, of 
January, 1914, Henry W. Farnham, Professor of Economics in Yale 
University, had an intensely and illuminating article on our tobacco 
bill, and which we have kindly been permitted to quote. Says Professor 
Farnham : 

The importance of tobacco in our National budget is shown by the 
latest census figure, according to which it ranks eleventh among the in- 
dustries of the country with respect to the value of the product. Our man- 
ufactured tobacco was worth at the factory in 1909, four hundred and sixty 
million, six hundred ninety-five thousand dollars. It thus outranked bread 
and other bakery products, women's clothing, copper, malt liquors, automo- 
biles, petroleum and distilled liquors. It was but about one-third less im- 
portant than the manufactures of cotton. A careful statistician, Pro- 
fessor William B. Bailey of Yale, published nearly two years ago some 
figures showing that the people of the United States spent at that time 
in a single year about one billion, one hundred million dollars on to- 
bacco. As the receipts from the Internal Revenue Tax on tobacco have 
increased by abput fourteen per cent in the last two years, it seems fai, 



26 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



to assume that the general consumption has increased by this amount. It 
seems, therefore, conservative to state that at the present time the people 
are spending at least one billion two hundred million dollars for the pleas- 
ure of smoking and chewing. The significance of these figures can best 
be appreciated if we compare them with other items in our national budget. 
To put the matter concretely "tobacco takers" spend in a single year twice 
the amount spent by the entire country on railroad travel, and about three 
times the amount which it spends on its common school system. They 
pay out annually about three times the entire cost of the Panama Canal, 
they destroy directly about three times as much property as was destroyed 
in the San Francisco earthquake. Their smokes and chews cost them 
just about twice what it costs to maintain the government of the United 
States, including the interest on the public debt. Our smokers could, in 
a year and a half, pay off the entire bonded debts of our states, cities and 
counties, as it was in 1902, and in an additional nine months the entire 
interest-bearing debt of the United States, if they were willing to exer- 
cise the self-denial which was exercised a few years ago by the Persian 
people. 

■ These figures are impressive. I think I am safe in saying that 
vast sums are expended in our own state every year for tobacco and 
that thousands and tens of thousands of cigarettes are smoked by the 
young people in the State of Utah. It ought not to be. We must get 
together, we must be absolutely united, we must set our faces as flint 
against this evil, because it is breaking down the health and Weakening 
the constitution of our young people. It will never do. 

THE BONDAGE OF DEBT 

i 

Just a closing word upon the subject of indebtedness. Any man 
who has been in debt, any man or woman who is in debt now, surely 
knows the evil of indebtedness. It is bondage. It is worse than im- 
prisonment. It is time that our people, at least, should give this im- 
portant matter consideration. We do not know what is ahead. There 
may be evil times, we do not know. Mioney seems to be plentiful 
just now. How it comes and where it comes from I don't know, but I 
see a great deal of it wrapped up in the thousands and tens of thou- 
sands of automobiles that are plying throughout the country, in every 
city and in every country place. Surely, it is all right for a man to 
have an automobile for the use of himself and his family, and espe- 
cially to take his family out occasionally and particularly if his family 
lives upon a farm. I think it is a grand thought that a farmer may 
take his hard-working wife and his family out for a little fresh air 
and drive them over the country, in the country places, and in the 
city too. It is all right if he can afford it. If he has the money to 
invest in this luxury it is all right. But I would not think it is all right 
to put a large sum of money into an automobile, if he does not have 
it, and if he must needs mortgage the automobile or possibly mortgage 
his home in order to get it. To me that looks like a great evil, but 



PRESIDENT RUDGER CLAW SON 



27 



the thought that is in my mind is that we ought to retrench in our 
expenditures. I am safe in saying that this is an extravagant age in 
which we are living and much money is spent recklessly and wildly. 

Keep this in mind. Let us fight these three gigantic evils. 

The Lord bless you in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

Lola Leonard sang a sacred solo : "Sweet story of old." 



ELDER REED SMOOT 

I am very grateful for the privilege I had of attending the con- 
ference session this morning, and I desire to express my approval of 
all that was said. Every admonition I approved of, and' it met a re- 
sponsive answer in my heart. I enjoyed greatly that wonderful hymn 
that was sung so beautifully by Brother J. R. Boshard, and a member 
of the Provo choir, entitled "I know that my Redeemer Lives." I think 
that is my favorite song, and every time I hear it sung it builds me 
up in my faith and gives me confidence that there is a living God and 
that he has a watch-care, not only over his people, but over the whole 
world. 



NEED OF REFORMATION IN THE HOME LIFE OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE 

i am going to read an extract of a letter from a governor of one 
of the great states of our country. I believe that never in the history 
of the world has it been so necessary that there be a reformation in 
the home life of the American people, and to a certain extent, in our 
own homes in Zion, as exists today. This excerpt is as follows, in 
answer to a letter written the governor upon a question that I thought 
was very vital to the American people: 

The destiny, the greatness of America lies around the hearthstone. 
If thrift and industry are taught there and the example of self-sacrifice 
oft appears; if honor abide there, and high ideals; if there the building of 
fortune be subordinate to the building of character America will live in se- 
curity, rejoicing in an abundant prosperity and good government at home, 
and in peace, respect and confidence abroad. If these virtues be absent 
there is no power that can supply these blessings. Look well, then, to 
the hearthstone. Therein all hope for America lies." 

I am delighted to know that from the very beginning of the 
Church, immediately after its organization, the "Mormon" people 
became home-builders and home-owners, and in the early days of this 
Church, at least as far back as I can remember, the admonitions to 
the people were to secure a home and keep it unencumbered. That 
admonition is good today.

PEOPLE LIVING BEYOND THEIR MEANS 

I have been surprised to see in a few of the business concerns 
the amount of indebtedness owing by our people and in many cases 
it seems to me in amounts that it will be impossible for them to repay 
without some unforeseen relief. I want to echo the same idea ex- 
pressed by Brother Clawson and ask our people, as well as other people 
who are deeply in debt, to get out as soon as possible. The obligations, 
of our government were never so great, brought on by the wicked 
world war, but it is not only the government, it is the people generally 
throughout all parts of the country. The people generally have been 
living beyond their income. And as long as money was so easily ob- 
tained, many who never were in debt before, find themselves in 
that condition today no one can tell, but we know that there are 
thousands and tens of thousands of them, and we do know that from 
now on there must be a retrenchment in the mode of living by the 
people of the United States. Extravagances upon all hands, and 
sometimes as I look around in the large cities it seems to me that that 
old principle that made America so strong and powerful, that home- 
owning tendency, that hearthstone spoken of by the governor, is fast 
disappearing in many parts of our country. Instead of homes we 
see great buildings erected as apartment houses. From my front 
door in Washington I look upon the hill but a few rods away, and 
there is built what is said to be the largest apartment house in all 
the world. People are applying for space faster than it is possible to 
furnish. 

PRAYER IN THE HOME 

I hope and trust that the homes of the "Mormon" people will be 
homes in which prayer is always practiced, for there is power in prayer 
and as long as the father and the mother and the children of a home 
believe in prayer, and believe that God will answer the prayers, and 
offer those prayers with an honest and pure heart, there is not very 
much outside danger that will come to such homes. The five years that 
I was a counselor in the Presidency of the Utah stake there never was 
a case of dispute or trouble between the husband and wife that came 
under my observation, but what, upon inquiry, we learned that in that 
home prayer had ceased to be the rule. And I am one who believes 
that where the inmates of a home pray for strength, pray with faith, 
pray with their children and for their children, that there is not going 
to be an estrangement between the father and the mother, or the chil- 
dren and the parents. I hope and trust that where our people, through 
circumstances perhaps over which they have no control, are forced into 
apartment houses, that they will try to make the rooms they occupy 
in such a building a place where prayer shall be exercised. 

In our meeting the other day some of the presidents of the mis- 



ELDER REED SMOOT 



29 



sions reported some remarkable healings of the sick. As I listened to 
them I thought to myself, are there any more remarkable manifesta- 
tions of the power of God recorded in Holy Writ than those that were 
reported to us at that meeting, the blind made to see, — the paralyzed 
made to walk ! And I want to testify to you, my brethren and sisters, 
that I do know that there is that power in the Priesthood of the living 
God, that through faith and prayer and laying on of hands, the house- 
hold of faith can be healed. I think we are making headway in the 
world. I think that the walls of prejudice against this people are 
crumbling day by day. I think that the character of the people is bet- 
ter understood as time passes on, and I haven't a doubt in my mind 
but what all the purposes of the Father will be fulfilled in his own 
due time. And it is with us, as members of his Church, to see that our 
homes are put in order and that we ourselves are willing to keep the 
commandments of God as was requested of us this morning by Presi- 
dent Grant. . 



CONVERSIONS AT HOME AND ABROAD 

We have many missionaries in the field, some fifteen hundred, 
I think, and with all the expense attached to maintaining them in the 
missionary field, and with all of the baptisms that are performed by 
the missionaries, I want to say to the brethren and sisters here today 
that the number of such conversions in the world are not more than 
twenty-five per cent of the number of the children that are born of 
"Mormon" parentage. I may add that I was pleased with some of 
the reports that came to the Council of the Twelve in relation to the 
home missionary work in some of the stakes of Zion. I understand 
that the home missionaries in one stake of Zion have converted within 
the last year, or less, some thirty-eight persons, and I thought to my- 
self, a soul saved in Zion, a baptism made at home, is just as precious 
in the sight of the Father as one that is made abroad. And if with 
our lives and through our energies we can convert the people who 
live among us, the people who see our every-day lives, the people who 
know what this work has accomplished in this part of God's vineyard, 
how blessed it would be, and I am quite sure it would be approved 
of the Father. 

Now, brethren and sisters, I ask God's choicest blessings upon 
you, and I want to say with all the fervor of my soul that I know that 
the Father is at the head of this work, he is directing it, and I know 
that his servants are in full accord with the wish of the Presidency 
of the Church. May his blessings ever attend all of the people, and 
may they remember him in their tithes and in their offerings, for it is 
from him that all good comes, is my prayer, in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



ELDER ORSON F. WHITNEY 

IN TUNE WITH THE KEYNOTE. 

My spirit is in perfect tune with the keynote struck for this con- 
ference. I believe in charity and forgiveness. I fully agree with the 
one who said: "He that judgeth a matter before he heareth it is not 
wise." And we do not hear a matter by hearing one side of it. It 
is wrong to pass judgment before proof of guilt. The Prophet Joseph 
Smith was murdered while awaiting trial on a trumped up charge of 
which he had not been proved guilty, nor could he have been. He 
had surrendered for trial, but his plotting murderers declared : "The 
law cannot reach him, but powder and ball shall." And they forth- 
with carried out their wicked threat. This, however, is not the theme 
that was weighing upon my mind. 

TWO PHASES OF GOD'S WORK. 

I have been thinking of two great phases of the Lord's Latter-day 
work, one of them appealing more strongly, perhaps, to the traveling- 
ministry who are preaching the gospel in the world ; the other to 
those who are laboring at home in the Stakes of Zion and particularly 
in the temples of God. 

TEMPLES IN THIS DISPENSATION 

Temples and temple work is a subject that lies very near and is 
very dear to the heart of every faithful, thoughtful Latter-day Saint. 
This Church since its organization, has built eight temples — the first 
one at Kirtland, Ohio, in the year 1836 ; the next one at Nauvoo, 
Illinois, in the early forties; and it projected others at Independence, 
Missouri, and at Far West and Adam-ondi-Ahman in that state. Then 
came the departure of the Saints into the wilderness. The first tem- 
ple in Utah, the one at St. George, was dedicated in 1877, the year 
that President Brigham Young died. Next in order was the Logan 
Temple, completed in 1884; then the Manti Temple, in 1888. The 
great Salt Lake Temple, which occupied forty years in building and 
cost over three million dollars, was dedicated in April, 1893. Since 
that time, we have built a temple in the Hawaiian Islands, and an- 
other at Cardston, in the province of Alberta, Canada. And now the 
Church contemplates a temple at Mesa, Arizona, which will make the 
ninth, thus far, in this dispensation. 

THE KIRTLAND TEMPLE 

Among all these sacred structures there is one that stands out 
unique, with a character and history all its own. It is not the largest 



ELDER ORSON F. WHITNEY 



31 



of our temples, nor the costliest; but things occurred within its walls 
of which there is no counterpart in the history of any other house of 
God. P refer to the temple at Kirtland, which it was my privilege to 
visit, first, in 1877, and subsequently in 1914. One peculiarity of that 
temple — which yet stands — is the absence of a baptismal font, the 
principle of baptism for the dead not having been revealed to the 
Church that early. But there is something connected with the Kirt- 
land Temple of far greater consequence than a baptismal font, and 
without which there would have been no baptismal font in any of the 
temples since erected ; and without which, moreover, the whole work 
of God in this dispensation would have come to a standstill. 

JOSEPH AND OLIVER 

You will understand me more clearly after I have read to you a 
selection from the book of Doctrine and Covenants — a portion of Sec- 
tion 110, the caption of which runs as follows : "Visions manifested to 
Joseph the Seer and Oliver Cowdery, in the Kirtland Temple, April 
3rd, 1836." This was just one week after that house had been dedi- 
cated. Joseph and Oliver were the first and second Elders of the 
Church. They had been associated together in the translating of the 
Book of Mormon. They were together when John the Baptist re- 
stored the Aaronic Priesthood, and when the Melchizedek Priest- 
hood was brought back to earth by Peter, James and John. They 
were together in organizing the Church ; and now, six years after that 
event, they are together in the first temple erected by the Latter-day 
Saints, receiving from God one of the most wonderful manifestations 
ever vouchsafed to mortals. It came in order that what had gone 
before in the opening of this gospel dispensation, might not be in 
vain. The glorious appearing of the Father and the Son; the visita- 
tions of the Angel Moroni; the discovery of the Nephite 
plates; the restoration of the Priesthood, and the organization of the 
Church — all these events were preliminary to what was about to come. 
Here is the record of visions seen by Joseph and Oliver on that oc- 
casion : 

JEHOVAH APPEARS 

The vail was taken from our minds, and the eyes of our understanding 
were opened. 

We saw the Lord standing upon the breast-work of the pulpit, before 
us, and under his feet was a paved work of pure gold, in color like amber. 

His eyes were as a flame of fire, the hair of his- head was white like 
the pure snow, his countenance shone above the brightness of the sun, 
and his voice was as the sound of the rushing of great waters, even the 
voice of Jehovah, saying — 

I am the first and the last, I am he who liveth, I am he who was 
slain, I am your advocate with the Father. 

A wonderful revelation in itself, this proclamation from the 
mouth of Jehovah, the God of Israel, that he is no other than Jesus 



32 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Christ, the Savior of mankind. He accepts the house — the Temple 
built to his name — and the record thus continues : 

MOSES AND ELIJAH 

After this vision closed, the heavens were again opened unto us, and 
Moses appeared before us, and committed unto us the keys of the gather- 
ing of Israel from the four parts of the earth, and the leading of the ten 
tribes from the land of the north. . . . 

After this vision had closed, another great and glorious vision burst 
upon us, for Elijah the Prophet, who was taken to heaven without tasting 
death, stood before us and said — 

Behold, the time has fully come, which was spoken of by the mouth 
of Malachi, testifying that he (Elijah) should be sent before the great 
and dreadful day of the Lord come, 

To turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the children 
to the fathers, lest the whole earth be smitten with a curse. 

Therefore the keys of this dispensation are committed into your 
hands, and by this ye may know that the great and dreadful day of the 
Lord is near, even at the doors. 

THE GOSPEL TO THE NATIONS 

Up to this time the activities of the Elders who were preach- 
ing the gospel had been confined to various states of the Union and 
to the Dominion of Canada; but now the Ensign, previously lifted, 
was farther advanced. The keys of the gathering having been re- 
stored, preparations were made for sending the gospel from the Land 
of Zion into foreign lands, calling in from their long dispersion the 
children of Israel, scattered for generations through the various na- 
tions of the world. But if the keys committed by Moses, who held 
them at the time of Israel's exodus from Egypt, had not been con- 
ferred upon the Prophet presiding over this dispensation, the work 
of God would have halted then and there. There would have been 
no gathering of Israel, if the keys for the gathering had not been re- 
stored. 

FIRST FOREIGN MISSION 

In the summer of 1837, a little over a year after these keys were 
given to Joseph and Oliver, the Prophet, harassed and' tortured by 
conditions then prevailing at Kirtland, where everything seemed tot- 
tering to its fall — half the Quorum of the Twelve and many of the 
Seventies and Elders arraying themselves against the Lord's anointed 
— voiced the word of God to the effect that "something new must be 
done to save the Church." Yes, Satan saw what wlas coming; he 
knew the significance of the restoration of those sacred keys, and he 
did his utmost to destroy the Lord's work in its infancy. It was a 
period of apostasy; the things of the world were uppermost in the 
minds of the people, and many were neglecting their spiritual duties, 
and seeking to become rich at the sacrifice of principle. Such was the 
situation when, according to Heber C. Kimball, one of the Apostles, 



ELDER ORSON F. WHITNEY 



33 



the Prophet, sitting beside him in the Kirtland Temple, Sunday, June 
4, 1837, said: "Brother Heber, the Spirit of the Lord has whis- 
pered to me, 'Let my servant Heber go to England and proclaim my 
gospel and open the door of salvation to that nation.' " Heber C. 
Kimball and Orson Hyde, with Willard Richards, Joseph Fielding, 
Isaac Russell, John Goodson and John Snyder, crossed the Atlantic, 
landed at Liverpool penniless, proceeded to Preston in Lancashire, 
and there preached the first "Mormon" sermons ever heard on Euro- 
pean soil. Their success was marvelous. Whole villages were swept 
into the Church by these unlettered but divinely empowered apostles 
of the new dispensation. In eight months" they baptized two thou- 
sand souls, and Heber wrote back to Kirtland : "Glory to God, Joseph, 
the Lord is with us among the nations !" 

EARLIEST IMMIGRANTS 

Subsequently another apostolic mission, headed by Brigham 
Young and including a majority of the Twelve, crossed the ocean 
and carried the gospel to all parts of the British Isles. Five thousand 
converts were added to the Church ; a new edition of the Book of 
Mormon was published ; many thousands of tracts were distributed ; 
the Millennial Star was founded; a permanent emigration agency 
established; and in the month of June, 1840, the first company of Lat- 
ter-day Saints from a foreign land sailed from Liverpool to New 
York, bound for Nauvoo, Illinois, which had become the place of 
gathering. From that time on, Israel has been flocking from the na- 
tions, to meet the God of Israel when he comes, and to make the 
necessary preparation for his coming. All this by virtue of the keys 
restored by Moses, and conferred upon Joseph Smith and Oliver 
Cowdery in the Kirtland Temple. 

JUDAH TO RETURN 

About two months before that little company of forty-one Saints 
crossed the Atlantic on the ship Britannia, a notable conference was 
held at Nauvoo, and two of the Apostles, Orson Hyde and John E. 
Page, were called to go to Palestine and bless that land, that its 
barrenness might depart and the way be opened for the restoration of 
the Jews. For be it remembered that the gathering of Israel includes 
the assembling of "the dispersed of Judah" — their return to their an- 
cient homeland. America is the Land of Zion, and here the New Jeru- 
salem will stand. But Christ's kingdom will have two capitals, one 
in the Old World; one in the New; "for out of Zion shall go forth 
the law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem." 

ORSON HYDE IN PALESTINE 

John E. Page faltered and fell by the way; but Orson Hyde ac- 
complished his mission, though beset and hindered by many hard-

ships and difficulties. It took him a year and a half to reach the 
goal for which he had set out. Finally, on the 24th day of October, 
1841, from the summit of the Mount of Olives, overlooking Jerusalem, 
he offered to Jehovah, the God of Israel, a most fervent and eloquent 
prayer in behalf of his covenant people. He blessed the sterile land 
by the power of the holy apostleship, that it might become fruitful 
once more, and that Judah might repossess his ancient heritage. Af- 
terwards he predicted that the British nation would take an active 
part in the redemption of Palestine; a prophecy fulfilled at the close 
of the recent World War, when General Allenby, at the head of a 
British army, made his triumphal entry into Jerusalem. 

LATER MISSIONS TO THE HOLY LAND 

In the year 1872 a mission went from Salt Lake City to 
the Holy Land. President George A. Smith headed the party, which 
also included Lorenzo Snow, one of the Twelve Apostles, and his 
gifted sister, the poet, Eliza R. Snow. Upon reaching Palestine, 
President Smith duplicated the work done by Orson Hyde in 1841, 
dedicating the land for the return of the Jews and the rebuilding of 
Jerusalem. Other elders of the Church have since visited that once 
favored and yet to be glorified region. President Anthon H. Lund 
was there in 1898 ; and he likewise offered up an earnest prayer for 
the great consummation. All this because Moses restored the keys for 
the gathering of Israel in this dispensation. 

THE KEYS OF ELIJAH 

But what about the keys of Elijah? What is their significance? 
If you will read Sections 127 and 128 of the Doctrine and Covenants, 
and peruse pages 27 to 35 of "Joseph Smith's Teachings," you will 
learn what the founder of this Church had in mind relative to that im- 
portant matter. In connection with the building of temples and the 
work done in them by the living for the dead, we have from his pen 
this glorious utterance : "It is necessary, in the ushering in of the 
dispensation of the fulness of times, . . . that a whole and com- 
plete and perfect union and welding together of dispensations and keys 
and powers and glories should take place and be revealed from the 
days of Adam even to the present time ; and not only this, but those 
things which never have been revealed from the foundation of the 
world, but have been kept hid from the wise and prudent, shall be 
revealed unto babes and sucklings in this the dispensation of the ful- 
ness of times." 

A GREATER GATHERING 

In other words, there is to be another gathering, one still greater 
than the gathering of the dispersed house of Israel. It is the gath- 



ELDER ORSON F. WHITNEY 



35 



ering or bringing together of the gospel dispensations, and the bind- 
ing of all into one. This is called the dispensation of the fulness of 
times, and its peculiar distinguishing characteristic is, that it folds 
to its mighty bosom all the dispensations preceding it; the angels 
holding the keys of the past conferring them upon the Prophet who 
presides over this period or division of God's work, to the end that 
oneness and unity may be established as a condition precedent to the 
Savior's Millennial reign. Therefore came Moses and Elijah, John 
the Baptist, Peter, James and John and others, bringing and bestow- 
ing their keys, so that their work might be blended with the work 
done in this dispensation, which is destined to gather together all 
things that are Christ's, both in heaven and on earth. Especially was 
it necessary that Elijah should restore the keys of his calling and 
ministry — keys comprising the revelation of "the fulness of the Mel- 
chizedek Priesthood," with all its "ordinances, oracles, powers and en- 
dowments," the seals of which must be placed upon the House of 
Israel, that all may be made ready for Messiah's advent. 

THE WELDING LINK 

The Prophet says that there must be "a welding link between the 
fathers and the children" — the fathers in heaven yearning over their 
children on earth ; and therefore was Elijah sent. His keys empower 
the living to do saving work for the dead and seal them up to come 
forth in the first resurrection ; "to seal those who dwell on earth to 
those who dwell in heaven." "For we without them cannot be made 
perfect ; neither can they without us be made perfect." "This is the 
power of Elijah and the keys of the kingdom of Jehovah." The weld- 
ing link is baptism for the dead, with other vicarious work now go- 
ing on in the temples that God's people have erected. You brethren 
and sisters who labor in these temples may cherish in your souls the 
sweet conviction that you are helping to bind together the gospel dis- 
pensations and assisting to advance the mighty purposes of God. 

THE EVERLASTING GOSPEL 

"Mormonism," as it is called, did not originate in the nineteenth 
century. It is not of any one time nor of any one place. It is the 
everlasting gospel, the same yesterday, today and forever. There 
never has been and never will be another gospel ; but this one, framed 
in heaven, has been upon earth again and again, in a series of dispen- 
stations reaching like a mighty chain from the morning of creation 
down to the end of time. And all these dispensations must be linked and 
bound together before the God of Israel appears ; for unless a condi- 
tion of unity and power, resulting from faith and righteous works, 
exists at that time, the whole earth will be smitten with a curse. 
Not that the Lord wishes to curse, but rather to bless mankind. But 
the blessing that he desires to bestow at his coming would change into 
a consuming curse, if the necessary preparation were not made.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



PERFECTION THE GOAL 

The gospel is the plan of eternal progression, and perfection is its 
goal. Apart from our ancestors who figured in the former dispen- 
sations, neither we nor they can attain perfection. But by unity, 
which brings power, and by faith, which makes all things possible, the 
glorious end can be achieved. The sacred ordinances of God's 
House — baptisms, endowments, sealings, adoptions, etc., — all point to 
a perfect state of righteous love and unity. Why, for instance, 
do we marry for eternity, and not merely for time? It is because 
we are children of eternity, building for eternity, and "the man is not 
without the woman nor the woman without the man, in the Lord." 
Together they represent completeness, perfection; separated, they 
symbolize incompleteness, imperfection ; and nothing imperfect can en- 
ter into the Divine Presence. Let a man and a woman, single or mar- 
ried only for time, present themselves at the celestial gates, and it 
will be said to them, or of them, as it was said at the gates of Verdun : 
"They shall not pass." But they who are wedded for eternity, wedded 
according to God's law and by his sealing power and authority, shall 
pass by the angels and the gods and inherit a fulness of joy. The 
welding link must bind together husband and wife, parent and child, 
present and past, living and dead — "all things in Christ," to the end 
that there may be completeness, perfection, and that that condition 
of unity and love may prevail which is the required preparation for 
the coming of the Lord in his glory. Amen. 

The choir and congregation sang the hymn, "High on the moun- 
tain top." 

Benediction was offered by Elder Daniel G. Miller, President of 
the Yellowstone Stake of Zion. 

Conference adjourned until Saturday morning at 10 a. m. 



SECOND DAY. 

Conference convened in the tabernacle, Saturday morning, Octo- 
ber 9, 1920, at 10 o'clock. 

The congregation was called to order by President Heber J. 
Grant, who presided. 

The choir and congregation sang, "We thank thee, O God, for a 
prophet." 

Opening prayer was offered by Elder Orville H. Budge, President 
of the Logan Stake of Zion. 

The choir and congregation sang, "O ye mountains high." 



ELDER GEO. F. RICHARDS

ELDER GEO. F. RICHARDS 

I am very happy to be able to say to you, my brethren and sis- 
ters, that my feelings are in perfect accord with those of my brethren 
as expressed in their remarks in the sessions of the conference yester- 
day. I hope that I may be guided in my remarks by the Spirit of 
the Lord so as to speak forth the word of the Lord in truth, that it 
may find a ready response in the hearts of the Latter-day Saints, and 
that perchance we may be pricked in our hearts and be resolved that 
we will, with the help of the Lord, come nearer doing his will in 
the future than we have done in the past, for our own good, happiness, 
and salvation and also for the blessing and happiness of others and 
the glorifying of the name of our Lord. 

god's purpose in creation 

I call your attention, my brethren and sisters, to the words of 
the Lord to his servant Moses, spoken to him in the mount where the 
Lord talked with him face to face. The Lord said: "Behold, this is, 
my work and my glory — to bring to pass the immortality and eternal 
life of man." This then, I conclude, is the aim; all the other works 
of God are but a means to this end, to save and exalt his children 
with him in his kingdom. For this purpose the earth was created, 
the gospel plan was instituted, and as a part of that plan the Savior 
was chosen to be the Redeemer of the world. We read this in the 
holy scriptures : "For God so loved the world that he gave his Only 
Begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but 
have everlasting life." Whenever I have occasion to use this passage 
of scripture, in discourse, I feel that an explanation is necessary, or at 
any rate, is in good place, because of the fact that this scripture is used 
so largely by religionists in the world to justify themselves in the 
belief, that faith only, is necessary to salvation; that our Savior has 
done all, and that all that is necessary for us to do is to acknowledge 
him and his work, and we will be saved. This is a misunderstanding 
of the word of the Lord. An explanation is found in the following 
scripture : "He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do 
also." So that it is doing the works such as Christ did that is going 
to save us, rather than the mere intellectual assent or profession of 
faith in him and his ministry. 

LOVE, SACRIFICE, AND SERVICE 

There is another impressive passage of Scripture, also corrobor- 
ative of this fact which reads : "Though he were a son, yet learned he 
obedience by the things which he suffered, and being made perfect he 
became^ the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him." 
There is much other corroborative scripture. 

Now returning to that expression that "God so loved the world 



38 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



that he gave his only Begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him 
should not perish, but have everlasting life." We see in this three 
great principles exemplified, viz. : love, sacrifice, and service. The 
love of God our Father for his children led him to give his first- 
born Son, in the spirit, his Only-Begotten in the flesh, to a life of 
sorrow and an ignominious death, that they might be redeemed and 
saved in his kingdom on conditions of obedience unto the laws and 
ordinances of the gospel. Then we find the Son also, because of 
the love that he bore for us, his brothers and sisters, giving himself 
voluntarily. He said: "I lay down my life for the sheep. 
No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of my- 
self," and he said again: "Greater love hath no man than this: that 
a man lay down his life for his friends." Here we find the love again, 
an example to the human family. Here we find again sacrifice, all 
that could be made, a willingness to do the will of his Father at what- 
ever cost of sorrow and of suffering. Here we find a service rendered 
to the children of men necessary for their salvation ; and the salva- 
tion of men should be the prize, the pearl of great price, to be 
desired by them above any and all other blessings. 

LET US BE BOTH HEARERS AND DOERS OF THE WORD 

We were told by President Grant yesterday, in concluding his 
remarks, that what he desired is, that the Latter-day Saints will keep 
the commandments of the Lord. I thought, when he made that re- 
mark, of our weaknesses as a people. We are prone in this day and 
dispensation, as others have been in previous dispensations — as evi- 
denced by the nature of the counsel and instructions given by the 
prophets of old — to hear the word of the Lord and be not doers of it, 
or doers of it only in part. We go forth into the world bearing the 
message of the gospel, and we tell the people it is not sufficient to say : 
"Lord, Lord ;" that that will not save them in the kingdom of heaven, 
but they must do the will of our Father which is heaven, and his will 
has been expressed in the life and teachings of our Savior and of 
the apostles and prophets which have gone before and which are 
recorded here in the Holy Bible and in the Book of Mormon. We 
tell them that an assent merely to these things is not all that is neces- 
sary. Some of us have entered the Church by baptism and confirma- 
tion to membership, and we have halted by the way. Many of us have 
stopped progress, we are hearers only, of the word of the Lord in 
regard to bearing false witness, in regard to honesty, in regard to our 
tithes, our offerings, and many other requirements which are made 
upon us. What we most need, it seems to me, my brethren and sisters, 
is to be impressed with the necessity of doing the things that we 
know we ought to do. We are well enough educated as a people. 
We know what we should do in order to obtain salvation; and be- 
cause we know these things, if we do not do them, we will be under 
condemnation. 



ELDER GEO. F. RICHARDS

HOW WE MAY ASSIST THE LORD IN HIS PURPOSE 

I would like, if I could, to impress my hearers on this occasion, 
with the necessity of assisting the Lord in the great work that he has 
undertaken, to save and exalt the souls of men and women. He need ? 
our assistance. He has called upon us to so live before the world that 
they, seeing our good works, will be led to glorify" our Father in 
heaven. That is one way, in which we can assist the Lord in the 
accomplishment of this particular purpose, by being obedient unto 
him, by making his mind and his will our mind and our will, even 
as Christ our Savior who was the great exemplar and prototype of 
mankind did, for he set the example and told us to follow him. We 
are required to walk in the light as he was in the light, with the prom- 
ise that if we will do so, we shall have fellowship one with another, 
in him, and his blood will cleanse us from all sin ; but there are other 
things that we are called upon to do. We are called to love one an- 
other and to sacrifice and to serve one another. The Savior on one 
occasion was asked by a certain lawyer, who thought to entrap him 
in his sayings : "Master, which is the great commandment ?" The 
answer of the Savior was : "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with 
all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is 
the first great commandment and the second is like unto it: thou 
shalt love thy neighbor as thyself." Even as our Father and as our 
Savior loved the children of men, we are required to love them 
also, even as we love ourselves. There would be no bick-biting, there 
would be no evil-speaking, there would be no taking advantage of 
others, if we loved them as we love ourselves. There would be noth- 
ing left undone that we could do for the comfort of others, if we 
loved them as we love ourselves. If we loved the Lord with all our 
heart, we would give to him our lives and everything that we possess, 
if necessary, to assist him in this great work. 

WHAT CONSTITUTES THE STRAIGHT AND NARROW WAY? 

This gospel we have received is one of sacrifice, service and self- 
abnegation from beginning to end. That is what' constitutes the 
straight and narrow way that leads to life eternal. Some of us are 
more faithful, some are less faithful than others in our sacrifices. 
My brethren and sisters, there will come a time of accounting, and 
we will be judged and rewarded according to the sacrifices which we 
make, and the services we render to God and to our fellowmen. Let 
me tell you here that when we undertake to glorify our Father in 
heaven by living a good life, we help others along the way. Religion, 
true religion of the Master, is so different from politics. When we 
aspire to an office as politicians, and become candidates, our only 
hope of success is in the defeat and disappointment of somebody else. 
In this great work, if I, through the help of the Lord, shall be suc- 
cessful in saving my own soul, it will be through works of righteous- 
ness, through a good example which will be helpful, and no person 



40 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



will be deprived of the blessings he is laboring for because of my 
success, but just the reverse, he will be helped along the way. Now 
in this work of sacrifice and of service, we need encouragement, and 
stimulation. 

GET SOMEBODY ELSE 

There is a little poem that I desire to recite to you because I 
feel that it will have this effect. And let me say here, that I believe 
in the poets. I believe there is much inspiration from the Lord 
outside of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, in vari- 
ous ways, not the lest of which is found among the poets. This little 
poem is entitled "Get Somebody Else." The Lord is always to his 
servants calling, something more for us to do. Are we willing, or 
are we too mluch engrossed with the affairs of life ? The little poem 
reads : 

The Lord had a job for me 

But I had so much to do; 
I said, "you get somebody else, 

Or wait till I get through." 
I don't know how the Lord came out; 

No doubt he got along, 
But I felt kind o' sneakin' like, 

I knew I'd done God wrong. 

One day I needed the Lord 

Needed him right away, 
But he never answered me at all, 

And I could hear him say, 
Down in my accusing heart: 

"Child, I've got too much to do. 
You get somebody else, 

Or wait till I get through." 

Now, when the Lord has a job for me, 

I never try to shirk, 
I drop what I have in hand 

And do the Lord's good work. 
And my affairs can run along. 

Or wait till I get through. 
Nobody else can do the work 

God has marked out for you. 

I feel that I have occupied all the time that I should, and will 
close my remarks here, with my testimony to you, my brethren and 
sisters, that I know that this is the gospel of Jesus Christ, that it has 
in it the power of God unto happiness and salvation, in this life, and 
in the life to come ; and I exhort you, with all the earnestness of my 
soul, to live up to the light which you have received in the gospel, and 
promise you, as a reward, eternal life in the kingdom of our God. 
This I do in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

A solo, "Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace", was sung by Royal 
W. Daynes. 



ELDER DAVID 0. McKAY 



41 



ELDER DAVID O. McKAY 

It is an inspiration always to meet with the Latter-day Saints in 
conference. I rejoice with you in having this opportunity of listening 
to the words of love and inspiration with which this conference has 
been favored. I am overwhelmed, as I stand here and face this large 
interested audience, but I am free to say to you that if I had my choice 
I would not choose to speak to you, men of the Priesthood, and faith- 
ful women in the Church. I should prefer to give whatever message 
I have in my heart to another audience, this morning, which is scat- 
tered all up and down these counties and towns and valleys of the 
western states. I should like to speak to your boys and to your girls, 
to their playmates wherever they may be. However, since we have 
but very few of them here, I shall have to speak to them through 
you, because after all this conference, inspiring as it may be, is not 
an end in itself. The purpose of it shall not have been attained until 
the messages through you reach your sons and your daughters, and 
your neighbors' sons and daughters. Your happiness, your peace, 
depends upon your ability to get the message into their hearts. 

TO BE CARNALLY-MINDED IS DEATH TO BE SPIRITUALLY-MINDED IS LIFE 

AND PEACE 

If they were here this morning I would read the following text : 
"To be carnally-minded is death, but to be spiritually-minded is life and 
peace." Glorious words these — life, peace. The whole purpose and 
end of existence is life, and to obtain in that life, peace. Eternal life- — 
we have heard from Elder Richards, that the work and glory of God 
are to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man — and our 
purpose wherever we may be, is to live. 

THE HAPPY LIFE COMES FROM OBEDIENCE TO LAW 

I believe that we can meet our boys on that plane and appeal to 
them, and show them that the best life, the happiest life is the life 
that is prompted by the ideals of true religion. Many of them will 
turn aside when you say you are going to preach to them. I do not 
always blame them. I believe that too many of us stand on the side, 
as it were, and call to them to come back without ever entering into 
their lives. 

I was reminded this morning of an old story that appeared in one 
of our early school books. Many of you present will remember it, so I 
need not repeat it to you. You remember the author pictures some 
people sailing down the river towards the Niagara Falls, and the 
man on the shore cries : 

"Young men, ahoy, the rapids are below you !" 

But they went on laughing and carousing. Later he cried : 

"Young men, ahoy, the rapids are below you!" 



42 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



But they heeded not his warning call until they suddenly realized 
that they were in the midst of the rapids, and with all the power at 
their command they failed to turn their boat upstream, so, he says, 
shrieking and cursing over they go ! 

Well, it is a very impressive picture. The lesson left an indelible 
impression upon me, but today it seems incomplete. It is one thing 
to stand on the shore and cry: Young men, ahoy, there is danger 
ahead ; and it is another thing to row into the stream, and, if possible, 
get into the boat with the young men and by companionship, and by 
persuasion, by legitimate force, when necessary, turn the boat from 
the rapids. Too many of us stand on the shore and cry: Young 
men, ahoy ! Let us get into their lives, let us touch their personality by 
our personality, and let them feel that there is something real in this 
religion ; that it is the greatest thing in life, that nothing else can 
make them live as the true religious life. When they feel this they love 
it, and until they do feel it, until they do sense an immediate bless- 
ing, following activity, we are going to find difficulty in calling them 
into that realm where there is peace. Young people say : "We want 
to live. That is just what we are going to do. Let us have life, and 
have a good time." But their view is often distorted. They are 
seeking to live in the physical pleasures. They are seeking to live in 
the realm that brings only immediate sensation, and afterwards no 
peace. They fail to distinguish between the carnal pleasures and those 
which are intellectual and spiritual. I am not going to ask them not 
to have a good time. I think they should have a good time. Young 
men and young women are entitled to it ; all men and all women are 
entitled to it. We are all here to enjoy life in its fullest and most com- 
plete sense ; but the message of the gospel of Jesus Christ is this : that 
to live one must live in obedience to law, physical lam, intellectual law, 
spiritual law. Transgression of law always brings unhappiness, it al- 
ways brings death when carried to the ultimate end. 

HE WHO PLAYS THE CROOKED GAME LOSES 

I was deeply impressed, and I hope the young men of the United 
States were impressed, with the remark made by one who was na- 
tionally disgraced recently when he said, it seems to me, in a rather 
repentant spirit: "I have played a crooked game, and I have lost." 
Boys, that is the story of every one who plays the crooked game. 
The one who plays the game straight, who deep down in his soul 
does the right thing, because it is right, is the man who has that peace 
and contentment that we all so much long for. 

HE LIVES MOST WHO LISTENS TO THE URGENCE FOR A HIGHER, BETTER 

LIFE 

Let us seek to live intellectually. I welcome with all my heart 
the hundreds, and the thousands of boys and girls who are participat- 
ing in the realm of education in the auxiliary associations, and in the 



ELDER DAVID 0. McKAY 



43 



Church schools. What are they learning to do but to live! — to live 
completely and abundantly; and in the living to serve — serve their 
fellow men. He lives most who sees or hears "Tongues in trees, books 
in the runnig brooks, sermons in stones, and good in everything." He 
lives most who sees beyond these trees, these stones, these running 
brooks and sees God and goodness in it all, who sees an overruling 
providence in all this world and recognizes God's children as brothers 
and sisters, in every one of whom there is something good, ever striv- 
ing, to lift the man up out of the sensual world into the realm of 
true religion. I believe that there is in every human soul a something 
good calling for something better, very much as that something of life 
mentioned by Lowell when he said, referring to spring, "Every clod 
feels a stir of might, an instinct within it that reaches and towers 
and groping blindly about, it for light, climbs to a soul in leaf and 
flower." So there is in the human soul that divine element which is 
calling, striving, urging the person up to a higher, to a better life. 
Boys and girls should do right because it is right. The day is past 
when you can threaten them with punishment hereafter. The world 
has passed by the fears of a fire and eternal torment. They can be 
appealed to, however, upon the sound pirnciples of true religious liv- 
ing. It is the best because it works best. It is the best because it 
makes us happy and better here and now. We are better citizens, we 
are better friends, we are better football players, we are better stu- 
dents, we are better sons, we are better daughters, we are better every- 
thing, and the world should know' it. When we take the opposite view, 
as many of our boys unfortunately are doing, and seek life in im- 
mediate pleasures, transitory pleasures, indeed, we find only disap- 
pointment and eventually death, for to be carnally minded is death, 
but to be spiritually minded is life and peace. "Live while you live, 
the Epicure would say, and seize the pleasure of the present day." 
That is one view. "Live while you live, the sacred preacher cries, and 
give to God each moment as it flies ;" the other : "Lord, in my view, 
let both united be. I live in pleasure when I live to thee." 

PHYSICAL PLEASURES TO BE AVOIDED 

There is no peace in yielding to the temptation to transgress the 
laws of virtue and chastity. If there is one thing in all this world 
for which we should be thankful as Latter-day Saints, it is that there 
is a sentiment, founded upon the solid basis of revelation from God, 
that chastity among the young is as sacred as life itself. One of the 
most disintegrating influences today is that feeling that is creeping 
in amongst some of our young boys and young girls that they can 
violate the law of chastity with impunity. The law of the land may 
not reach them — they may avoid that. Their bishops may not detect 
their transgression. But God can. And deep down in their own souls 
they know that they have lost part of their life. They have lived as 
the Epicure would live, for the moment, and they have no peace. Their 



44 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



souls are turbulent. Why? Because they have stained the character of 
another, they have stained their own souls eternally. No one can trans- 
gress the laws of chastity and find peace. That is the message to our 
boys, to our girls. No matter what the opportunity, no matter what 
the temptation, let the young man of Israel know that to find happiness 
he must hold sacred his true manhood, let him know that he is going 
to live and live completely by refusing to yield' to that temptation. 
Then he is happy; he is happy. There is peace instead of turbulency 
in his soul. 

Next to that disintegrating evil, is the evil mentioned by President 
Clawson, tobacco — young men who are just learning to indulge in 
this physical pleasure, this sensual appetite, have been told by you 
parents, not to smoke. Some of the young men are not doing it in 
your presence. Some of your boys you think have not become addicted 
to that habit. In trying to correct this evil, have you stood aside and 
cried, Young man, ahoy, there is danger down there? Or have you 
tried to touch his soul? Have you tried to convert him to the fact 
that to indulge in the pernicious habit is to take part of his life, to 
weaken his physical being? Have you studied how to convince him 
of it? If you haven't you are standing on the shore simply crying to 
him instead of plunging in and trying to guide him around. 

The gospel of Jessu Christ when lived in its fulness, as we were 
admonished yesterday by the President in the keynote of this confer- 
ence, gives peace, life, physical life, intellectual life, spiritual life. 

The Word of Wisdom is a law that applies directly to the phys- 
ical world, the physical salvation and peace of man. Too many of our 
boys are unconverted to it. We haven't touched them by our appeals. 
We haven't given them facts, perhaps. They think we are preaching, 
simply crying to them to come back. I would that every young man 
knew this : that every person who indulges in the use of tobacco simply 
hampers his physical well-being to the extent that he uses that narcotic. 
Let us appeal to them. Let us unite as a body in the campaign that is 
now abroad in our land to eliminate the use of that weed, from our 
communities. The time has come when the Latter-day Saints should 
stand by their principles, not on the bank crying, but in the midst of 
the young, out with them, in their quarters, out with them to the 
picture shows, go out with them, mingle with them. It is all right 
to talk about the sacredness and the influence of our homes, and there 
is no one that will stand more solidly behind the importance of having 
the right influence in the home than I, but the fact remains that our 
boys are going out at night, night after night ; and you and I are out 
of our homes, during the day, so we are not associating with them 
very often in their homes, and it behooves us to get out into the pleas- 
ures more than we have, to go to their shows with them, aye and go 
to their parties and become acquainted and touch their lives. Then 
we may know, whether or not they are taking a cigarette once in a 
while. We can detect their breath, perhaps. We can see the com- 



ELDER DAVID 0. McKAY 



45 



panions with whom they are associated, and we can judge our boys 
and our girls greatly by the companions they keep, as well as by their 
actions in the home. To boys I would say, that if they want to live 
physically, if they want to be men strong in body, vigorous in mind, 
if they want to be good sports, enter the basket ball game, enter the 
football game, enter the contest in running and jumping, if they want 
to be good scouts, if they want to be good citizens, in business, any- 
where, avoid tobacco and live strictly the religious life. I am not 
afraid to call it the religious life to them. It is not a thing that will 
make them gloomy and sad. Live the gospel of Jesus Christ, for it 
is the science of life revealed from on high. Make them feel it as you 
feel it and I am sure we are going to save them, and by that I mean 
we are going to make them live happier and better. If we need any 
test, anything to help us on that, to appeal to them, we can find plenty 
of material to help us. I would like the boys to understand that 
the revelation given by the prophet Joseph is borne testimony to, today, 
by thousands and thousands of men and women. Here is one testi- 
mony, which I would like to read. It comes from a man who spent 
many years in the study of opium, in curing drunkenness, and who is 
now striving to cure the habit of tobacco. He has spent many years 
in the Orient and he has seen the effect of opium upon the eastern 
people. 

A COMPARISON 

He compares the effect of the cigarette with that of opium. Mr. 
Charles B. Towne in Habits that Handicap says: 

I have spent a good deal of time in the Orient in the interest of those 
who are trying to subdue the opium evil, and I may add that there is in 
China today a flourishing concern which has grown rich out of the sale 
of cigarettes. With the extremely cheap Chinese labor the concern was 
able to sell twenty cigarettes for a cent of our money. Up to the be- 
ginning of this enterprise, about 1800', the Chinese had never used to- 
bacco, except in pipes and in very minute quantities and in rolling their 
own crude cigarettes. The concern was sending salesmen and demon- 
strators through the country to show the people how to smoke cigarettes. 
Now it is estimated that one-half of the cigarette consumption of the 
world is in China. In trying to lessen the opium evil, in which they have 
to a very considerable extent succeeded, the Chinese are merely substitut- 
ing the cigarette evil. It is well known to the confirmed opium smoker 
that he needs less opium if he smokes cigarettes. The Chinese are spend- 
ing today twice as much money for tobacco as for opium. If any one 
thinks that China is the gainer by substituting one drug habit for the 
other I beg leave to differ. The opium smoker smokes in private with 
other smokers, and is thus not offensive to other people. He is not in- 
juring non-smokers, or arousing the curiosity of boys, or polluting the 
atmosphere, or creating a craving in others. In the West the opium habit 
is generally condemned, because the west is able to look with a new and 
unbiased mind on a drug habit that is not its own. I consider that cig- 
arette smoking is the greatest vice devastating humanity today, because 
it is doing more than any other vice to deteriorate the race.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



HOW LIFE AND PEACE COME 

To be carnally minded is death, but to be spiritually minded is life 
and peace — peace that comes by obedience to principle, peace that 
comes by overcoming habits, evil habits, peace that comes by self- 
mastery over appetite and over passion, the peace of the gospel of Jesus 
Christ. 

A man must earn his hour of peace, 

Must pay for it, with hours of strife and care, 

Must win by toil the evening's sweet release, 

The rest that may be portioned for his share. 

The idler never knows it, never can. 

Peace is the glory of the happy man, 

And man must win contentment for his soul, 

Must battle for it bravely day by day. 

The peace he seeks is not a nearby goal. 

To claim it he must tread a rugged way. 

The 'shirker never knows a tranquil peace, 

Peace but rewards the man who does his best. 

God help us as men of the Priesthood, as fathers and as mothers, 
to reach our boys and our girls, and impress upon them this great 
lesson, this divine truth that to be carnally minded is to be miserable, 
unhappy, perhaps not for the time being, but to lose part of our very 
life. To be spiritually minded, which means to obey the principles 
of the gospel in all that it means, is to have life, life eternal and peace. 
1 humbly pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 



ELDER ANTHONY W. IVINS 

Now, it came to pass that the people of Nephi, under the reign of the 
second king, began to grow hard in their hearts, and indulge themselves 
somewhat in wicked practices; 

Yea, a«d they also began to search much gold and silver, and began 
to be lifted up somewhat in pride; 

Wherefore I, Jacob, gave unto them these words as I taught them in 
the temple, having firstly obtained mine errand from the Lord. 

For I, Jacob, and my brother Joseph, had been consecrated priests, and 
teachers of this people, by the hand of Nephi. 

And we did magnify our office unto the Lord, taking upon us the re- 
sponsibility, answering the sins of the people upon our own heads, if we 
did not teach them the word of God with all diligence; wherefore, by la- 
boring with our mights, their blood might not come upon our garments, 
otherwise, their blood would come upon our garments, and we would not 
be found spotless at the last day. 

THE TEACHER MUST EXEMPLIFY IN DAILY LIFE THE DOCTRINES TAUGHT 

When I came into the conference yesterday, my brethren and sis- 
ters, I had no thought regarding what I might say, if called upon to 
address you, as I expected, because of past precedent, that I would be ; 
but since the beginning of the exercises these words of Jacob, the 
brother of Nephi, called and ordained under his hand to be a priest and 



ELDER ANTHONY W. IVINS 



47 



teacher to the Nephite people, were brought to my mind, because of the 
character of the services. I read these words many years ago, when I 
was only a boy, and was profoundly impressed by them, for I reasoned 
that as the responsibility of teaching the word of the Lord rests upon 
him who has been appointed to that particular calling in the Church, it 
devolves upon every member of the Church to give heed to the words 
so taught, because they come as from the Lord himself. They did to 
me, and I thought, this responsibility rests not alone upon the presiding 
authorities of the Church, but every member of it ; for there has never 
been a time, I suppose, in the history of the world, when the Priesthood 
has been so universally bestowed upon the members of the Church as 
it has been in this dispensation. So I reasoned that while the respon- 
sibility is not, perhaps, upon me, to the same extent, to stand as a 
teacher of the word of the Lord, having taken upon me the name of 
Christ, and having identified myself with his Church, and entered into 
covenant with him that I would, with his assistance, keep his com- 
mandments, I must in my daily life exemplify the doctrines which he 
taught. 

So, my brethren and sisters, in addressing you this morning I 
deeply feel this responsibility, and I have always felt it when I have 
stood up to expound the scripture or exhort my brethren and sisters 
in the Church. 

FOUNDATION PRINCIPLES OF THE CHURCH 

The foundation upon which the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints rests is faith in God the eternal Father, recognition of his 
power, recognition of his relationship to us as the Father of the spirits 
of all men, recognition of the control which he has over the universe 
and all of the creations of his hands. We must have faith in the Re- 
deemer of the World, believe that he was verily the Son of God, our 
elder brother ; that he came to earth in order that God might be man- 
ifest in the flesh, that men and women might see the Lord as he was, 
might hear him as he would have spoken had he been in person upon 
the earth, might see his life, and know by his life what the life of the 
Father would have been had he been upon earth ; might hear his voice 
and listen to his admonition, which was the voice of God, the Eternal 
Father, to the inhabitants of the earth. That is the foundation upon 
which the Church rests. We must believe in the Father and in the Son, 
and recognize the fact that the Holy Ghost, which is given to all who 
accept the Father and the Son, is the power and Spirit of God by 
which men are led in the way of everlasting life, by which they are 
given power over evil, by which they may learn to do well. 

THE SAINTS MUST ASSUME RESPONSIBILITY OF CARRYING THESE INTO 

EFFECT 

Once having assumed these responsibilities, then conues the more 
difficult task — clothed upon as we are with mortality — of carrying 



48 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



them into effect in our daily lives. It is a very great responsibility, 
my brethren and sisters. Never before, in the history of the world, 
has there been a greater necessity for the exemplification of the doc- 
trines of the Redeemer in the lives of the members of the Church than 
at the present time, because the world needs those influences. Without 
them I see very little hope for the world. And what are they? What 
are those simple things which the Lord has commanded us to observe, 
having once become members of the Church? 

THE REDEEMER'S CODE OF LAWS 

Seeing the multitude, Jesus went up into a mountain, and when 
he was seated his disciples came unto him; — and he preached the great- 
est sermon that was ever preached, the greatest sermon that ever will 
be preached ; for human tongue cannot express the same godlike senti- 
ments with the same spirit, and carry the same influence with it, that 
characterize the words of the Redeemer of the world. So I read from 
them : 

And he opened his mouth, and taught them, saying, 
Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. 
Blessed are they that mourn, for they shall be comforted. 
Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth. 
Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness; for 
they shall be filled. 

Blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain mercy. 
Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God. 

Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the children of 
God. 

Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake, for theirs 
is the kingdom of heaven. 

A very simple code of law, given to his disciples by the Redeemer. 
So, reasoning as my mind prompts me to reason, I take it for granted 
that except we do in humility the things which the Lord gives us to 
do from day to day, we are not in harmony with these words. I 
take it for granted that except we are merciful, we do not receive 
mercy, and are not in harmony with the words of Christ which I have 
read. I take it for granted that except we are pure in heart, we are 
not pleasing our Father in heaven ; that if we are not peacemakers, 
living at peace with each other and with the world, we are not in har- 
mony with this command which he gave us. 

Further he continues: 

Ye have heard that it hath been said, an eye for an eye and a tooth 
for a tooth; 

But I say unto you, that ye resist not evil, but whosoever shall smite 
thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also. 

And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let 
him have thy cloak also. 

And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain. 
Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow of thee 
turn not thou away, 



ELDER ANTHONY W. IV INS 



49 



Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shaltiove thy neighbor and 
hate thine enemy; 

But I say unto you, love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do 
good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you 
and persecute you. 

DISTINCTION BETWEEN FORGIVENESS OF SIN AND JUSTIFICATION OF 

WRONG DOING 

Not so easy, this latter admonition, my brethren and sisters, which 
carries with it this doctrine of humility, this doctrine of forgiveness, 
this doctrine of long-suffering' and kindness toward those who may 
appear to be your enemies, which has been dwelt on during this con- 
ference, and yet it is an admonition of the Lord. 

Now what does it really mean — this distinction I would like to 
draw? if the Lord will make it possible "for me to do so, as I under- 
stand this latter doctrine. If a man sues you at the law and you forgive 
him, if when he smites you upon the right cheek you turn the other, if 
when he compels you to go one mile with him you go with him twain, 
you are justified; but the fact that you extend forgiveness and mercy 
to him, does not in any degree justify the man who took you without 
cause to the law, or who smote you upon the cheek, or who took your 
coat and to whom you gave your cloak also. There is a most pro- 
nounced and direct distinction between forgiveness of sin and justifi- 
cation in wrong doing. The Lord has told us that he cannot look upon 
sin with any degree of allowance. He has made clear to us, beyond 
the question of a doubt, that men will be held accountable before him 
for the deeds done in the body. While he has taught us the doctrine of 
humility, the doctrine of forgiveness, he has always made it clear that 
mercy cannot rob justice one whit, but that the ends of justice must 
be satisfied as well as the ends of mercy. 

THE EXAMPLE OF CORIANTON 

When his father admonished him of his wrong doing, Corianton 
could not understand this doctrine. To him the Lord appeared to be 
not a God of mercy and love; but just the contrary, because he con- 
demned his wickedness, the wrong which he had done ; and then his 
father, inspired by the Spirit oi the Lord, explained to him that the 
mercy of God is extended to the penitent transgressor, and to him who 
turns away from sin, to him who repents from it By this act he pays 
the penalty, if he is sincere and has made amends for the wrong which 
he has done; and is held guiltless before the Lord. But justification 
of sin must never be confused with mercy and forgiveness which comies 
to the penitent sinner. It was not because the prodigal son had left 
his father's home, not because he had dissipated his heritage, not be- 
cause he had lived a life of riotous living and immorality until he had 
been reduced to a condition of poverty, that the arms of his father 
were held out to him in forgiveness, but because he returned, humble 
in his spirit; he came back and said, "Father, I have sinned against 



50 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



heaven and before thee, and am no more worthy to be called thy son. 
Just let me be thy servant, let me go out in the field and work with 
those who labor for you, that is all that I am worthy of." It was that 
spirit of repentance which brought the gladness which was shown to 
his father's heart when he came back, because the lost had been found, 
the dead lived again. And this, my brethren and sisters, is the very 
foundation of the doctrine of the gospel taught by Jesus Christ. I 
have seen this doctrine so perverted, so erroneously interpreted, 
that it has become the most obnoxious of all the doctrines which 
anti-Christ teaches in the world today, the doctrine that the 
mercy of Christ, the mercy of God as it was manifest through Christ, 
redeems men from sin, regardless of their acts ; that just to ask for- 
giveness and it is granted, and you may go on again in your trans- 
gression. It grew to such a degree that, sin was anticipated and men 
obtained indulgences — the world knows it perfectly well — for the com- 
mission of sin, on the theory that the Lord would forgive it. It is 
wrong; it is a pernicious doctrine. 

AN ILLUSTRATION FROM THE SPEAKER'S LIFE 

I had an example of this come into my personal life, one which 
I never can forget, because the crisis was right there with me as to 
whether I should do my duty as a man, as an officer of the law, or 
whether I should yield to the impulse of my nature to ignore the ob- 
ligation which I had assumed, in behalf of a friend, and he was a very 
dear friend too, but he was addicted to the use of liquor and when 
under its influence he was a lawless Mian. I had been appointed a 
peace officer. I had taken oath that I would administer the law as it 
existed. Upon one occasion this friend of mine, in the night time, in 
his crazy drunkenness, committed offenses which made it necessary 
for me to take him, and with some severity, too, and drag him, as- 
sisted by another man, to prison, throw him into an iron cell and lock 
the door. After I had done it my heart went out in sympathy to 
him. I knew it was not the man; I knew it was his inflamed 
brain, and that liquor was responsible for it. I thought of his 
mother, who was a widow. I could not endure the thought that 
he should remain there during the night as an ordinary crim- 
inal should have done, and as he should have done had he 
had his deserts, so I plead for him and obtained permission to release 
him. I went back to the jail, unlocked the door, and took him, to his 
home. He never forgave me for that act. I don't suppose he ever 
has until today. He argued that if I had been his friend I never 
would have taken him there. He argued that if I had been his friend 
I would have condoned his lawlessness. I could not do it. Had I 
done so I would have violated the oath of office that I had taken, and, 
worse than that, would have violated my conscience ; for I felt in my 
conscience that the law must be magnified. He was a transgressor of 
it. He is an influential man today. I suppose he is, because he is pos- 



ELDER ANTHONY IV. IV INS 



51 



sessed of wealth, and is a banker in this state. I do not think, to this 
day, that he ever forgave me ; but I forgave him — I forgave him the 
wrong he had done; I forgave him the violation of the law of which 
he had been guilty. There was nothing but sympathy in my heart for 
him, but I knew that in justice and in righteousness he must pay the 
penalty, and he did it, the following day in the court. 

FORGIVENESS COMES THROUGH REPENTANCE 

So, my brethren and sisters, this is the thought that I desire to 
leave with you : Do not, as the greatest church in the world has 
done, ever confuse this doctrine of God's mercy and forgiveness which 
comes to the penitent sinner, with the thought of unconditional for- 
giveness. It must come through repentance. We must abstain from 
sin. We must live humble, simple lives, the lives of Latter-day Saints. 

THE WORD OF GOD ON THE SUBJECT FROM THE BOOK OF MORMON 

I shall conclude my remarks with these words, because they are 
said better than I can say them. Thank the Lord for the scriptures. 
Thank the Lord for inspired men, for prophets in olden times, and 
for prophets in the day in which we live. I believe in God's word. 
I have endeavored to live by it. I cannot bring my conscience to be- 
lieve that I am justified in deviating from it, whatever may be the 
opinions of men : 

And now I, Mormon, speak unto you, my beloved brethren; and it is 
by the grace of God, the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, and his hob- 
will, because of the gift of his calling unto me, that I am permitted to 
speak unto you at this time. 

Wherefore I would speak unto you that are of the Church, that are 
the peaceable followers of Christ, and that have obtained a sufficient hope, 
by which ye can enter into the rest of the Lord, from this time henceforth, 
until ye shall rest with him in heaven. 

And now, my brethren, I judge these things of you because, of your 
peaceable walk with the children of men; 

For I remember the word of God, which saith by their works ye shall 
know them; for if their works be good, then they are good also. 

$ s)e $ $ * % 

Wherefore, all things which are good, cometh of God; and that which 
is evil, cometh of the devil; for the devil is an enemy unto God, and fighteth 
against him continually, and invitetlr and enticeth to sin, and to do that 
which is evil continually. 

But behold, that which is of God inviteth and enticeth to do good con- 
tinually; wherefore everything which inviteth and enticeth to do good, and 
to love God, and to serve him, is inspired of God. 

Wherefore take heed, my beloved brethren, that ye do not judge that 
which is evil to be of God, or that which is good and of God, to be of the 
devil. 

For behold, my brethren, it is given unto you to judge; that ye may 
know good from evil. 

If there is a man or woman in the Church of Christ who has not 
this gift, it is because they are not magnifying their calling, for every 



52 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



person who is confirmed into the Church has sealed upon him the gift 
of the Holy Ghost, for the express purpose that he may be able to de- 
termine for himself that which is right and that which is wrong, 
which is good and which is bad. 

For behold, my brethren, it is given unto you to judge, that ye may 
know good from evil; and the way to judge is as plain, that ye may know 
with a perfect knowledge, as the daylight is from the dark night. 

For behold, the Spirit of God is given to every man, that they may 
know good from evil; wherefore I shew unto you the way to judge; for 
everything which inviteth to do good, and to persuade to believe in Christ, 
is sent forth by the power and gift of Christ; wherefore ye may know 
with a perfect knowledge it is of God. 

But whatsoever thing persuadeth men to do evil, and believe not in 
Christ, and deny him, and serve not God, then ye may know with a per- 
fect knowledge it is of the devil, for after this manner doth the devil work, 
for he persuadeth no man to do good, no not one; neither doth his angels; 
neither do they who subject themselves unto him. 

And now, my beloved brethren, if this be the case, that these things 
are true which I have spoken unto you, and God will shew unto you with 
power and great glory at the last day that they are true; and if they are 
true, has the day of miracles ceased? 

Or have angels ceased to appear unto the children of men? — or has 
he withheld the power of the Holy Ghost from them? or will he, so long 
as time shall last, or the earth shall stand, or there shall be one man upon 
the face thereof to be saved? 

Behold I say unto you, Nay; for it is by faith that miracles are wrought; 
and it is by faith that angels appear and minister unto men; wherefore if 
these things have ceased, woe be unto the children of men, for it is because 
of unblief, and all is vain. 

* * * * * 

Woe be unto him that shall pervert the ways of the Lord after this 
manner, for they shall perish, except they repent. Behold, I speak with 
boldness, having authority from, God; and I fear not what man can do, 
for perfect love casteth out all fear; 

And I am filled with charity, which is everlasting love. 

Wherefore, if a man have faith, he must needs have hope; for without 
faith there cannot be any hope. 

And again I say unto you, that he cannot have faith and hope, save 
he shall be meek and lowly of heart; 

If so, his faith and hope is vain, for none is acceptable before God, 
save the meek and lowly in heart, and if a man be meek and lowly in 
heart, and confesses by the power of the Holy Ghost, that Jesus is the 
Christ, he must needs have charity; for if he have not charity he is noth- 
ing; wherefore he must needs have charity. 

And charity suffereth long, and is kind, and envieth not, and is not 
puffed up, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil, 
and rejoiceth in the truth, beareth all things, believeth all things hopeth 
all things, endureth all things. 

An exemplification of this doctrine of charity, corresponds with 
that which was given to us by the President of the Church, going 
beyond the giving of alms, into every walk of life and every act of 
ours. 



ELDER ANTHONY W. IV INS 



53 



Wherefore, my beloved brethren, if ye have not charity, ye are nothing, 
for charity never faileth. Wherefore, cleave unto charity, which is the 
greatest of all, for all things must fail; 

But charity is the pure love of Christ, and it endureth forever; and 
whoso is found possessed of it at the last day, it shall be well with them. 

Wherefore, my beloved brethren, — and my beloved sisters, I will add — 

Pray unto the Father with all the energy of heart, that ye may be filled 
with this love, which he hath bestowed upon all who are true followers of 
his Son Jesus Christ, that ye may become the sons of God, that when he 
shall appear, we shall be like him.; for we shall see him as he is, that we may 
have this hope, that we may be purified, even as. he is pure. Amen. 

A number of notices pertaining to special meetings were given and 
the choir and congregation sang, "Now let us rejoice in the day of 
salvation." 

The closing prayer was offered by Elder William H. Smart, Pres- 
ident of the Roosevelt Stake of Zion. 

Conference adjourned until 2 o'clock.

ELDER JOSEPH FIELDING SMITH 

"If ye love me, keep my commandments." 

These words were addressed by the Master to his disciples but a 
few hours before his death, as he had assembled with them to eat the 
passover, and give them the final instruction before he should suffer 
for the sins of the world. On that same occasion, and shortly before 
these remarks were made, he referred to the same subject, when he 
said : 

Little children, yet a little while I am with you. Ye shall seek 
me; and as I said unto the Jews, Whither I go ye can not come; so now 
I say to you. A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one 
another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another. 

I believe that I can do no better than to read other instructions 
that were given by our Lord and by his disciples, in regard to the 
same subject, because they have said it so much better than I could 
say it, and I firmly and faithfully believe all that is written. In this 
same discourse the Lord continued saying:

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth 
me: and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, 
and will manifest myself to him. 

Judas said unto him, (not Iscariot) Lord, how is it that thou wilt 
manifest thyself unto us, and not unto the world? 

Jesus answered and said unto him, If a man love me, he will keep -my 
words: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make 
our abode with him. 

He that loveth me not, keepeth not my sayings: and the word which 
ye hear is not mine, but the Father's which sent me. 



WE ARE HERE FOR THE TRUTH WHICH MAKES US FREE . 

I look over this congregation and I see before me men and 
women who have been gathered from all parts of the earth, or whose 
parents before them have been gathered out, by the preaching of the 
gospel. We have come to these valeys of the mountains, and our fath- 
ers before us, that we might be established in the truth which makes 
men free. Because here an ensign has been raised to the nations 
and the declaration has gone forth that in Zion may be found the 
word of the Lord, and so we came with the hope and desire of keep 
ing his commandments, making covenants, 'taking up"on ourselves 
obligations that would bring us eternal life. It would be a shame, 
after we have been gathered out in this manner, according to the pre- 
dictions of the prophets of old, if now, because of prosperity, or 
for any other cause, we should let the adversary find a place in our 
hearts to destroy the truth and the love we should have, one for an- 
other; for we are indeed the disciples of the Lord. If we love him 
we will keep his commandments. No question about that. And 
should there be in Zion any who offend or who fail to keep the com- 
mandments of the Lord, then it is evidence sufficient that they do 
not love him. I cannot have hatred in my heart for my fellow men, 
whether they be in the Church or out of it, if I abide in the com- 
mandment of the Lord. I must obey them, and I show by my works 
that I love the Lord my God with all my heart, with all my might, 
mind, and strength ; and in the name of Jesus Christ I serve him and 
love my neighbor as myself. This is the word of the Lord as it has 
been revealed in these modern times for the guidance of Israel. There- 
fore, I should have in my heart a feeling of love for my fellowmen, 
and especially for those who have made covenant with the Lord to 
observe his laws and walk before him in righteousness. What right 
have I to complain, or find fault, or endeavor to destroy the useful- 
ness of my brother? It matters not what the occasion may be, why 
should I engender feelings in my heart of enmity for one that I am 
called upon and commanded by the Lord to treat as a brother? We 
are not merely friends; we are brothers and sisters, the children of 
God, who have come out, as I have said, from the world to enter in- 
to covenants, to observe his laws and to abide by all things which 
are given us by inspiration. We are commanded to love one 
another. "A new commandment," the Lord has said, and yet like 



ELDER JOSEPH FIELDING SMITH 55 



many other commandments it is as old as eternity. There never was 
a time when that commandment did not exist and was not essential 
to salvation, and yet it is always new. It never grows old, because 
it is true. 

THE NEW AND EVERLASTING COVENANT 

I am reminded of an expression that occurs in one of the early 
revelations (section 22) shortly after the organization of the Church, 
when the Lord said that he had given unto the Church "a new and 
everlasting covenant, even that which was from the beginning." Those 
words are very significant. It was a new and everlasting covenant, 
and yet it had always existed, for it was from the beginning, and so 
this new commandment that we should love one another has always 
been. The truth does not grow old. Some people, you know, are ex- 
tremely progressive. They want a change in this and a change in 
that, and a change in the other thing, but the principles of the gospel 
never change. The principle of love is the same today that it was 
yesterday and will endure the same tomorrow, If I am not in har- 
mony with that principle, which is a principle of eternal truth, then 
I am under condemnation before the Lord and have no fellowship with 
him. 

FURTHER QUOTATIONS AND ILLUSTRATIONS ON THE POWER OF LOVE 

There are some other expressions of this nature that I desire 
to read, as I say, because they are stated so much better than I 
would be able to express them. John, known as the revelator, and 
the beloved disciple of the Lord, has borne witness likewise to this 
commandment. There is no wonder that the Lord loved him. He is 
spoken of, you know, in the scriptures, as the disciple whom the Lord 
loved. Why did the Master love him ? Because he loved the Master ; 
because he loved his fellowmen. Now I do not mean to say that 
the other disciples did not love the Lord, and that they had anything 
in their hearts but love for one another, but John stands out among 
them in this regard as one who had this gift in larger measure, per- 
haps, than did some of his fellows. Let me read to you one or two 
things that he has written. In his First Epistle, 3rd chapter and 
14th verse, I read this: 

We know that we have passed from death unto life, because we love 
the brethren. He that loveth not his brother abideth in death. 

I can not afford, therefore, to have enmity in my heart, to speak 
disparagingly of one of my brethren or of one of my sisters, because 
that is death to me. Now the next verse says : 

Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer; and ye know that no 
murderer hath eternal life abiding in him. 

I do not know that I would dare say a thing like that of myself, 



56 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



and yet it is true. That is to say, a man who has hatred in his heart 
for one of his brethren, not only for his own flesh and blood, but 
also for a brother in the covenant of the gospel, has the same spirit 
which exists in the heart of one who has murder in his heart. It is 
a murderous spirit and there is no eternal life for such a man. 

"Beloved, if God so loved us," John has said, "We ought also 
to love one another." 

Again : 

Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day 
of judgment: because as he is, so are we in this world. 

There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear; because 
fear hath torment. He that feareth is not miade perfect in love. 

We love him, because he first loved us. 

If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar: for he 
that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom 
he hath not seen? 

And this coirumflndment have we from him, That he who loveth God 
love his brother also. 

IN HARMONY WITH THE} KEYNOTE OF THE CONFERENCE 

These words which I have read are in harmony with the kev 
note of this conference. I endorse the remarks that have been made 
here by all the brethren. I rejoice that there is harmony and love 
in the hearts of the presidency, one for another, and the members of 
the council of the Twelve. We are not divided. We do not see dif- 
ferently, but we accept the same thing, and in the love of God have 
but one desire in our hearts and that is to serve him and keep his 
commandments . 

Now, I want to say a few words in regard to this phase of the 
subject, and I will repeat one of these verses: "He that loveth me not, 
keepeth not my sayings ; and the word which ye hear is not mine, but 
the Father's which sent me," and the preceding verse : 

ON KEEPING THE COMMANDMENTS 

"Jesus answered and said unto him, If a man love me he will 
keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto 
him and make our abode with him." Now, do we fully understand 
just what that means? The great promise that is made to the mem- 
bers of this Church who are willing to abide by the law and keep the 
commandments of the Lord is that they shall not only receive a place 
in the kingdom of God, but that they shall have the presence of the 
Father and the Son ; and that is not all, for the Lord has promised 
that all that he hath shall be given unto them. In section 84 of the 
Doctrine and Covenants this truth is very clearly set forth, and not- 
withstanding the fact that I may weary you, I shall read one or more 
verses : 

For whoso is faithful unto the obtaining these two priesthoods of 
which I have spoken, and the magnifying their calling, are sanctified by 
the Spirit unto the renewing of their bodies; 



ELDER JOSEPH FIELDING SMITH 



57 



They become the sons of Moses and of Aaron and the seed of Abra- 
ham, and the church and kingdom, and the elect of God. 

Now, I am not going to take time to explain all "of that which 
I have read, but I want to read a little more and give some explana- 
tion: 

And also all they who receive this priesthood receiveth rne, saith the 
Lord; 

For he that receiveth my servants receiveth me; 
And he that receiveth me leceiveth my Father; 

And he that receiveth my Father, receiveth my Father's kingdom; there- 
fore all that my Father hath shall be given unto him; 

And this is according to the oath and covenant which belongeth to the 
priesthood. 

That is in harmony with this expression which I have read here 
from John's gospel, that if we keep the commandments of the Lord — 
and I apply this to us, although he declared it unto his disciples then, 
it is just as true today — if we keep the commandments of the Lord, 
then we shall have both the Father and the Son and we shall dwell 
in their presence, we shall receive his kingdom as the elect and shall 
be heirs of God, joint heirs with our elder Brother in receiving the 
fulness of the kingdom, for all things are ours. O how wonderful, 
how great the blessings of the Lord to the Latter-day Saints and to 
all who are willing to go through the waters of baptism and abide 
by the law and keep the^commandments of the Lord! 

THE WHOLE DUTY OF MAN IS TO KEEP THE COMMANDMENTS 

A more timely thing could not be said than that which was uttered 
here as the keynote of this conference that we as Latter-day Saints 
should keep the commandments of the Lord. That is the whole duty 
of man. I have no right to do anything else. You have no right 
to do anything else. We have the privilege, but because we are ser- 
vants, who have gone through the waters of baptism and taken upon 
ourselves obligations, there is nothing else that we should do. Woe 
unto the man who has made covenant with the Lord in the waters 
of baptism and in the temple of the Lord to keep his laws and his 
commandments and then violates them! 

There is another passage of scripture here in explanation of one 
of the parables. You know the Savior spoke of the parable of the, 
wheat and the tares. It is not necessary for me to read it because 
you are familiar with it. But I want to read one verse of the inter- 
pretation. The Lord said: 

The field is the world; The good seed are the children of the kingdom, 
but the tares are the children of the wicked one. 

The enemy that sowed them is the devil; The harvest is the end of the 
world; and the reapers are the angels. 

As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so shall it 
be in the end of this world. 

The Son of man shall send forth his angels and they shall gather out 
of the kingdom all things that offend and them which do iniquity. 



58 



GENERAL . CONFERENCE. 



Now, he is not speaking of the world in that passage of scripture. 
He is speaking of Israel. If I have enmity in my heart, or hatred, 
then I offend. If I do not have a love for the principles of the gos- 
pel then I am an offense before the Lord. If I am not willing to 
live up to every word that proceedeth from the mouth of God, but 
make exception in my case, because, perhaps, I think I may hav 
weaknesses and may be different from other men, then I offend and 
am in danger. If we are not in harmony with the Church and King- 
dom of God in all things, and faithful in keeping the commandments 
of the Lord, the time may come when we shall be removed, for the 
angels of heaven will take a hand and all that give offense, all things 
that are impure, unholy, and stand in the way of progress and ad- 
vancement and the establishment of truth in the hearts of the people 
shall be removed. 

I never did learn to deliver a discourse without referring to the 
scriptures so you will have to pardon me. I will read one more pas- 
sage and this I expect will be the last that I will read. In the preface 
to the Lord's revelations he said this: 

And the arm of the Lord shall be revealed; and the day cometh that 
they who will not hear the voice of the Lord; neither the voice of his 
servants, neither give heed to the words of the prophets and apostles, shall 
be cut off from among the people. ■ 

How are they to be cut off? By being gathered out as the Lord 
declared in his explantion of the parable of the wheat and tares, when 
the angels shall go forth and cleanse and remove from Israel and 
the kingdom of God all things that offend. We have been com- 
manded to stand in holy places. We can not stand in a holy place, 
even though it be in the temple of the Lord, if our thoughts, our 
desires, and our feelings, are impure, because we would desecrate the 
house of the Lord, and to stand in holy places we must be in harmony 
with the truth and observe and keep all of the commandments that 
have been given unto us. 

GREATER COM PREHENSION OF THE GOSPEL MUCH NEEDED AMONG 
THE LATTER-DAY SAINTS 

I was in one of our northern stakes not long ago. I made the 
remark there that I thought the thing that was needed as much as 
anything else among the Latter-day Saints was a better understand- 
ing or comprehension of the gospel. And after I sat down we called 
upon one of the bishops and he got up and endorsed what I had said 
and put it to a vote of the people and it was adopted in that stake of 
Zion as a slogan, that we stand for a better comprehension of the gos- 
pel through study and by faith. I say to you, my brethren and sisters, 
you cannot keep the commandments of the Lord and walk in right- 
eousness unless you know what they are. The Lord has commanded 
us to search the scriptures, for the things which they contain are true 



ELDER JOSEPH FIELDING SMITH 59 



• 

and shall be fulfilled, and so I say to you, and this is my closing mes- 
sage : Search the scriptures ; make yourselves familiar with that which 
the Lord has revealed for your salvation, the salvation of your house, 
and of the world. Do not procrastinate the day of repentance. Let 
us walk humbly, righteously, diligently before the Lord and let, above 
-all things, this spirit of love dwell in our hearts for all men and more 
especially for our brethren. If we see them going wrong, if we see 
them doing that which they ought not do, there is a proper way to 
correct them. The Lord has pointed out the way and we can make 
the matter right nearly every time and if we can not make it right 
with the offending brother there is a procedure which we may take 
to make it right, and I have no right to backbite, to faukfind, to con- 
demn before others one of my brethren unheard, whether he be high 
or lowly. The Lord has pointed out the procedure in all of there 
matters for our guidance. 

Let us love the Lord for this is the foundation of all things. It 
is the first commandment, and the second commandment, to love our 
neighbors as ourselves, is like unto it, and when we have done that we 
have fulfilled the law, because there is nothing that will be left un- 
done. The Lord bless you, my brethren and sisters, let us stand to- 
gether united in the service of the Lord, I pray in his name. Amen. 

A solo entitled, "The way of life," was rendered by Ellen Open- 
ing. 



ELDER JAMES E. TALMAGE 

I am very thankful to find that I am in harmony with what has 
been said in this conference in the addresses of the brethren, from that 
of the president of the Church and the prophet of the Lord at the open- 
ing session, to the last Amen by the speaker who has just closed. A 
variety of topics have been touched upon, and I have felt to regret in 
a way that the time limitations did_not permit several of the speakers 
to go on as I could see from the trend of their remarks they would 
have done, had they had time — to a fuller elucidation of the very 
splendid principles they have presented. 

LOOKING AT THINGS FROM DIFFERENT ANGLES 

We have been able to look at things from different angles by 
following the remarks of the several brethren, and all harmonize. I 
believe that the remarks are peculiarly timely. Not that I feel that 
there is any great danger of the Latter-day Saints going astray as a 
body — for I have faith in them, and I know that they are the Lord's 
people — but because there are at this time conditions before the people 
upon which divergent views are held; and, consequently, not all see 
things from the same angle, and therefore do not have precisely the 



60 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



same image formed upon the retina of their spiritual and physical 
eyes. 

Very much depends, you know, upon our point of view. There 
are men who would not recognize a photograph of their own home if 
it were taken from the rear, for they have been in the habit of looking 
at it only from the front ; and such a one would probably say : "That is 
not mine; that is not the way I would build a house; it is all wrong." 

THE LORD CAN NOT LOOK UPON SIN WITH ALLOWANCE 

I was impressed by the brief and passing remark made by Brother 
Ivins, this morning, in which he incorporated one of the most profound 
epigrams in scripture, in which the Lord repeated words that he had 
before given through the mouth of his ancient prophet Alma. They 
appear in the 45th chapter, 16th verse, as Alma's words spoken under 
inspiration. In the first section of the Doctrine and Covenants, 31st 
paragraph, they appear as the direct words of the Lord : 

"For I the Lord cannot look upon sin with the least degree of allow- 
ance." 

I read further: 

"Nevertheless, he that repents and does the commandments of the 
Lord shall be forgiven; 

"And he that repents not, from him shall be taken even the light which 
he has received, for my Spirit shall not always strive with man, saith the 
Lord of Hosts. 

"And again, verily I say unto you, O inhabitants of the earth, I the 
Lord am willing to make these things known unto all flesh, 

"For I am no respecter of persons, and will that all men shall know 
that the day speedily cometh; the hour is not yet, but is nigh at hand, when 
peace shall be taken from the earth, and the devil shall have power over 
his own dominion; 

"And also the Lord shall have power over his saints, and shall reign 
in their midst, and shall come down in judgment upon Idumea, or the 
world. 

"Search these commandments for they are true and faithful, and the 
prophecies and promises which are in them shall all be fulfilled. 

"What I the Lord have spoken, T have spoken, and I excuse not myself: 
and though the heavens and the earth pass away, my word shall not pass 
away, but shall all be fulfilled, whether by mine own voice or by the voice 
of my servants, it is the same; 

"For behold, and lo, the Lord is God, and the Spirit beareth record, 
and the record is true, and the truth abideth forever and ever. Amen." 

This is no ancient scripture only. The principles involved were 
proclaimed early in the history of the race ; and they have been given 
anew to you, to me personally, to the people who are living in this dis- 
pensation, in this year of our Lord. 

"I the Lord cannot look upon sin with the least degree of allow- 
ance." I say that epigram is startling. It has attracted the attention 
of theologians ; it has led them to profound reflection ; it has enlight- 
ened their minds. In the scripture that I have read to you the Lord 
draws a yery clear distinction between sin and the sinner. The dis- 



ELDER JAMES E. TALMIAGE 



61 



tinction is real and vital. Some may say: Can there be sin without a 
sinner ? Can there be theft without a thief? Can there be falsehood 
without a falsifier? Can there be murder without a slayer? I take 
the liberty of reading to you a few lines of my own, with scripture in- 
corporated, as already published: 

Admittedly, sins may be planned but not executed, thought out, 
though not carried to the extent of actual commission, as is connoted 
by the Lord's words respecting adultery: "Ye have heard that it w 
said by them of old, Thou shalt not commit adultery : But I say unto 
you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath com- 
mitted adultery with her already in his heart." (Matt. 5 :27-28). 

Men may be potential liars, robbers or murderers, but, lacking op- 
portunity to become criminals in fact, or restraining their evil impulses 
through considerations of policy or personal advantage, they may main- 
tain outward signs of probity. The wearing of a sheep's fleece by a 
ravening wolf is no modern camouflage. 

But in all such dissemblings, the fact of wicked purpose exists ; and 
the evil purpose, thought, or desire, is of itself essentially sin ; and such 
a case, therefore, presents no phenomenon of abstract guilt, but actual 
and individual offense; for the thinker of evil is a sinner. 

Who of us can regard tuberculosis, smallpox, or the insidious and 
deadly influenza that has swept the earth, with other feelings than 
repugnance and fear? Yet we treat the afflicted person with effort 
to bring about his recovery ; and if we loved him while well, we do 
not hate him because he has become ill ; but, to the contrary, we be- 
come the more solicitous in his behalf. Health officers and the medi- 
cal fraternity look not upon disease with compromise, toleration or al- 
lowance. They are the marshalled assailants of physical malady, what- 
ever its disguise ; and their best means of waging war on disease is that 
of ministering to each afflicted one, while taking all measures possible 
to protect the well against infection. 

The germs of disease exist, whether they find lodgment in human 
bodies or not; and, by analogy, we may say that the spirit of or in- 
centive to thievery, adultery, or murder, is alive, as the definite con- 
tagion of evil, though men may or may not be actually overcome there- 
by. Now, in the case of physical affliction, definite treatment is in- 
voked ; and compliance with prescribed conditions is enforced so 
far as the patient will submit. 

In fine and purposeful irony, the Divine Healer met the casuistry 
of certain self-righteous scribes and Pharisees with the declaration : 
"They that are whole have no need of the physician, but they that are 
sick: I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance." (Mark 
2:17.) 

THE LORD, HOWEVER, IS MERCIFUL TO THE SINNER 

But as the scriptures abundantly affirm, and as experience demon- 
strates, there are none of us entirely free from sin; to the contrary, 
every one is in need of the Great Physician's healing ministrations. "Sin 



62 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



is the transgression of the law" (I John 3:4) ; furthermore: "There is 
none righteous, no, not one" (Rom. 3 :10) ; and again "If we say that 
we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us." (I 
John 1:8). 

I learn from the scriptures that the Lord hates sin in every one 
of its multifarious manifestations, but he is kind and merciful and 
long-suffering toward the sinner. It is true that disease may come 
upon us through our own neglect, or our own actual commission of 
overt acts. It may come upon us even against the best we can do. 
The diseases I have named, most of them, and diphtheria, and others, 
are classed by physicians as filth disease, because the germs that pro- 
duce them breed in uncleanness ; but even the cleanest of men, even the 
man who has lived according to the laws of health, may come down 
under the stroke of one of those dread maladies; and though I hate 
diphtheria, I may love with a yearning that leads me to fasting and 
prayer, the one who is stricken. Let us segregate the ideas even as 
the Lord hath done. 

A MEANS OF TREATMENT FOR THOSE WHO SIN 

Now the Lord has provided a means of treatment for those who 
are spiritually afflicted, even as means are provided for those who are 
physically ill, and by compliance with his laws of spiritual health we 
may, perchance, be healed, however ill we may have become. But 
we should not lose sight of the fact that the Lord has no compromise 
with sin. He has provided that if any man in this Church shall offend, 
he shall be dealt with as a man who is afflicted with smallpox 
must be dealt with, with the hope of saving him. The purpose of the 
Church is to heal, not to spread disease ; to build up, not to tear down ; 
to save, not to destroy, but that does not mean that we are to look upon 
sin in our midst in any namby-pamby way and pass it by. 

The Lord hath declared that there must not be iniquity in his 
Church, and he has provided officers whose specific and specified duty 
it is to hunt out iniquity, to run it down, so that every case may be dealt 
with, and the afflicted Ones perchance, be saved. He has not told us 
to cover up sin in the Church. That is not the Lord's will, nor purpose 
nor plan. He has told us that we should avoid gossip and slander and 
all kinds of misrepresentation, and speaking ill against our brethren, 
whether we regard them in their official capacity as officers of the 
Church, general or local, or otherwise. I have no right to speak in 
condemnation of my brother, unless I do it in an official capacity, in 
the exercise of the authority of the Holy Priesthood, and then I should 
do it in love and with yearning for him. 

SIN SHOULD BE EXPOSED 

You have raised your hands in this great building many times, 
sustaining me in the position to which I have been called. I make my- 
self the subject of the illustration. Perchance you will have an op- 



ELDER JAMES E. TALMIAGE 



63 



portunity to do that again, or to vote against me. But does that mean 
that because you vote and sustain me in my position that I am exempt 
from judgment if I do wrong? By no means. But there is a way in 
which your complaints, if you are in any way justified in making such, 
may be given consideration. If any one of you feel that you can not 
sustain me in my position, because of anything you know of me as being 
wrong, I pray you, come to me, come to me. I will give you a hear- 
ing; I will listen to you patiently, and if you do point out any error in 
my life, anything in which I have been doing that which I ought noi 
to do, the Lord being my helper I will thank you and bless you for it, 
and bless him who inspired you to come. Or, go to those who preside 
over you and me, and let diem judge between us. But do not go around 
gossiping about me, and trying to undermine my influence, which I 
desire before the Lord to be for good. Do not condemn me unheard. 
Do not pick out a rumor from the air. and think it over and magnify 
it until it becomes an established fact in your disordered mind. Bui 
on the other hand, if I am guilty of sin that makes me unfit to be one 
of the goodly company to which I have been called, that should be 
known ; it should be pointed out, in the proper way and in the proper 
spirit. 

DISCIPLINE REQUIRED IN THE CHURCH 

Now, the Lord has provided that those in his Church shall live 
according to the law, and he makes a distinction between the law per- 
taining to the Church and what we call the secular law, or the law 
of the land, but he requires obedience to each. My love for my brother 
in this Church does not mean that I am to shield him when he has 
violated the law of the land, nor that I am to stand between him and 
righteous judgment. This Church is no organization like that of the 
secret combinations of old, which the Lord hath said he hates, the 
members of which were pledged, and bound by oath and covenant, that 
they would stand by each other whether right or wrong, that they 
would cover up one another's crimes, that they would justify one an- 
other in theft and murder and in all things that were unclean. It is 
no such organization at all. It would not be of God if it were. 

The resurrected Christ, after his ascension, in giving the revelation 
through John, instructing the revelator to have messages sent to the 
different churches, included in the message to the church at Ephesus 
the word that he did have something good to say to them, because, as 
I read, "Thou hatest the deeds of the Nicolaitanes, which I also hate." 
(Rev. 1 :6.) He did not say he hated the members of that unholy 
band, but he did hate their doctrines and practises, which were the doc- 
trines of a secret combination, the members of which were pledged to 
stand by each other no matter what any one of them might do. That 
the Lord requires discipline in his Church is made plain in the revealed 
word, as you may read in the 42nd section of the Doctrine and Cove- 
nants :

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



"And again, I say, thou shall .,ot kill; but he that killeth shall die. 
"Thou shalt not steal; and he that stealeth and will not repent, shall 
be cast out 

"Thou shalt not lie; he that lieth and will not repent, shall be cast 

out. 

"Thou shalt lpve thy wife with all thy heart, and shalt cleave unto 
her and none else; 

"And he that looketh upon a woman to lust after her, shall deny the 
faith, and shall not have the Spirit, and if he repents not he shall be cast 
out. 

"Thou shalt not commit adultery; and he that committeth adultery, and 
repenteth not, shall be cast out." 

And then, to cut the matter short, he says : 

"Thou knowest my laws concerning these things are given in my 
scriptures; he that sinneth and repenteth not, shall be cast out." 

In the latter part of the same revelation, we find these instruc- 
tions : 

"And if a man or woman shall rob, he or she shall be delivered up 
unto the law of the land. 

"And if he or she shall steal, he or she shall be delivered up unto the 
law of the land. 

"And if he or she shall lie, he or she shall be delivered up unto the law 
of the land. 

"And if he or she do any manner o£ iniquity, he or she shall be de- 
livered up unto the law, even that of God. 

"And if thy brother or sister offend thee, thou shalt take him or her 
between him or her and thee alone; and if he or she confess, thou shalt be 
reconciled." 

Such is the law to the Church, and respecting the law of the land, 
the Lord has made it perfectly plain that we are subservient to it and 
are required to sustain it. Though we have our tribunals in the Church, 
established according to the order of the Lord, there is no conflict be- 
tween their administration and that of the courts of the land. 

TENDER TREATMENT FOR THE SPIRITUALLY SICK 

"Let no man break the laws of the land," saith the Lord in the 
58th section of the Doctrine and Covenants, "for he that keepeth the 
laws of God hath no need to break the laws of the land: Wherefore, 
be subject to the powers that be, until he reigns whose right it is to 
reign, and subdues all enemies under his feet." And then referring 
to the laws previously given he said : "Behold, the laws which ye have 
received from my hand are the laws of the Church, and in this light 
ye shall hold them forth. Behold here is wisdom." 

I remind you of the strictness with which the Lord regards his 
people. He has provided tender treatment for those who are spiritually 
sick, and it is our duty to assist those who are thus stricken. If I go 
to my brother in the spirit of kindness, and that spirit must be with 
me if I go to him in the power of my office and calling, giving unto 
him words of counsel, and he receive them not in the spirit in which I 
go, he becomes an offender before the Lord. If I do so when my 
brother comes to me, I become an offender. But you know there are 



ELDER JAMES E. TALMAGE 



65 



those among us and elsewhere — the world is full of them — who do not 
want to be criticized, except in the broad sense of the term, and then 
the criticism must be favorable. They want to be patted on the back ; 
they want to be told that everything they have said and done* is right ; 
and if you point out, perchance, that they should be on their guard 
against this or that, or they should right this wrong or that, too fre- 
quently they become offended against the one who has come to them 
even as a physician would come to one afflicted with disease. 

KEEP THE COMMANDMENTS OF THE LORD 

To the people I say, keep the commandents of the Lord as you 
have been admonished again and again. Do not lie, do not steal, do not 
take advantage of your neighbor, do not have lustful thoughts, do 
nothing that is unclean. Keep these commandments of the Lord. Bish- 
ops, presidents of stakes, keep ye the commandments of the Lord. 
When you have under your care those who are offending, you shall 
■deal with them as the Lord hath provided, in all kindness and with 
a desire to save them ; but nevertheless, you are not to cover up iniquity 
in the Church. The spirit in which this jurisdiction is to be exercised 
is set forth by the Lord in plainness, as I read to you from the 121st 
section of the Doctrine and Covenants : 

"Behold, there are many called, but few are chosen. And why are they 
not chosen? 

"Because their hearts are set so much upon the things of this world, 
and aspire to the honors of men, that they do not learn this one lesson — 

"That the rights of the Priesthood are inseparably connected with the 
powers of heaven, and that the powers of heaven cannot be controlled nor 
handled only upon the principles of righteousness. 

"That they may be conferred upon us, it is true; but when we under- 
take to cover our sins, or to gratify our pride, our vain ambition, or to 
exercise control, or dominion, or compulsion, upon the souls of the chil- 
dren of men, in any degree of unrighteousness, behold, the heavens with- 
draw themselves; the Spirit of the Lord is grieved; and when it is with- 
drawn, Amen to the Priesthood, or the authority of that man." 

TOLERATION ENJOINED 

You see the safeguards that the Lord has set. Now, the Lord hath 
enjoined love for our fellowmen upon us, such love as will cause us 
to do even disagreeable things for their welfare, to do that which 
we do not like to do, to speak a word of caution when, perchance, we 
would rather not, lest we be misunderstood ; but the Lord requires it at 
our hands ; and he has enjoined upon us tolerance toward one another. 
There are some who have never reasoned carefully along the line of 
the possibility of two men, for example, looking at things from dif- 
ferent points of view, and seeing different images, and yet both seeing 
the truth. "How is it possible," some have asked, "that two divergent 
ways may be right ?" Why, they may tum, and they may come to be 
right after all. I can not believe that two men, both desiring the same 
ultimate attainment, and that good, and both working toward that end 



66 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 

with full and sincere purposes of heart, can not both be right, although 
they seem for the time being to be going differently. 

Let me be specific. Do you mean to tell me that all good is in 
one or the other of the great political parties? Why, if so, if it be 
right to be a Democrat, then it is wrong to be a Republican. No, my 
friends. It may be perfectly right for you to be a Democrat and equally 
so for me to be a Republican, or vice versa. We have our different 
ways of looking at things, but if I believe that the principles of the 
Democratic party are right, I am not justified in condemning my 
brother who believes that the principles of the Republican party are 
right. I believe that both of these great parties, that is to say all 
honest members thereof, have at heart the country's good, the nation's 
welfare. They differ as to the best means of attaining this ; and to 
our great sorrow they have dragged into the field of partisanship ques- 
tions that never should have been brought in, because they are funda- 
mentally not partisan at all. 

THE CHURCH IN ALL THE AFFAIRS OF LIFE 

Only the other day I was asked, in the course of conversation 
with an intelligent gentleman, not a member of our Church : 
"Is the 'Mormon' Church in politics?" 

I answered him : "Most assuredly it is in politics, and also in busi- 
ness, in statesmanship, in all the affairs of life, teaching the people to 
do what is right so far as it possibly can." 

"Well, has the Church any candidates in the pending election?" 

"Yes, indeed," said I, "the Church has a full ticket, and is counsel- 
ing its members just how to vote." 

Now, let me tell you just how you should vote, just as I told him. 
The Church is telling its members to look upon the franchise as a 
sacred gift, to exercise it according to their very best judgment before 
the Lord, and the Church's ticket is the ticket of the best men, accord- 
ing to the best judgment of the people, to whichever party they belong. 
Vote the party ticket if you honestly feel that to be best, or vote for the 
men you think will most effectively subserve the needs of country, state, 
and people. 

OUR RELIGION MAKES FOR HONESTY AND TOLERANCE 

You have your agency and you know that you are free ; therefore 
do not offend the Lord, by going contrary to what you believe, hon- 
estly and after thought and prayer, to be right. But above all, do not 
say that because your brother does not see things just as you do in the 
political field, he necessarily is wrong. I was very much touched by 
the president's words — that he was pained at the evidence that had 
come to view, that some brethren condemn their fellows because these 
do not look on things as those of the first class do in matters political. 
Our religion should purify our politics, and make us honest, tolerant, 
and bold, to do that which is required of citizens, and to exercise our 



ELDER JAMES E. TALMA'GE 



67 



rights at the polls. Our religion should make us honest in business, 
truthful in all our doings. To be so is to be in line with the keeping 
of the commandments of the Lord. I pray that this may continue to be 
a characteristic of the Latter-day Saints, in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 



ELDER STEPHEN L. RICHARDS 

I always find it very difficult to reach a conclusion as. to how 1 
should best occupy my allotment of time on these occasions. I think 
I have been more perplexed than usual at this time to know what I 
ought to say, in an attempt to make some contribution to the great 
conference that we are now holding. I desire to say nothing that is 
inconsonant with the splendid remarks that have already been made, 
and with the excellent spirit that has here prevailed. I feel, as Brother 
Whitney expressed himself, to give over my thought to some matters 
that have been more or less weighing upon my mind ; and while I may 
not be able to give solutions to some of the problems that I see con- 
fronting us, I sincerely hope, with the aid of our Father's Spirit, to 
be able to present to you some questions which I believe deserve our 
serious consideration. 

THE "WORLD" HAS BROUGHT A TRANSFORMATION AMONG US 

May I, by way of premise, go back a few years in the history of 
the Church? Not many years ago the various communities of the 
Church, that is, the communities in which the Latter-day Saints dwelt, 
were made up almost exclusively of members of the Church. I think 
that not more, perhaps, than twenty-five or thirty years ago would 
have found our villages and our small towns, outside of the few large 
centers in this intermountain region, to be peopled almost entirely with 
members of our Church. These villages, these country towns, while 
all under the jurisdiction of the civil government and all functioning as 
municipalities, were nevertheless so exclusively made up of people all 
professing one religious faith, that necessarily there was a unity of ex- 
pression in matters of social intercourse, particularly, that was very 
marked. Nearly all of the activities in the societies that then prevailed 
were carried on under the jurisdiction of Church government. Our 
wards, being small centers of population, so formed as to make feasible 
and practical the administration of social affairs and functions, were 
under the jurisdiction of their bishops, and our people responded al- 
most with unanimous accord to the direction and the influence exer- 
cised by the Church in these various communities. We were hom- 
ogeneous. 

With the passing of years a very different condition has come to 
prevail. In the larger centers of the Church people whom we some- 
times designate as "outsiders" have come to be, in numbers, in the 



68 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 

majority, and in these smaller centers of the Church there has been 
such an influx of people, not members, that they form no inconsiderable 
part of the population of these rural communities, that were once al- 
most entirely made up of our people. With the influx of these people 
into our various comimunities have come very many practices that 
are wholly different from the practices and the standards that were 
once employed and upheld. The "world," as we commonly designate 
all that is outside of our Church, has literally come in upon us, and it 
has brought with it the practices of the world. 

OUR RELATIONSHIP TO THE "WORLD" 

As I have given my thought to this transformation I have 
ever asked myself the question : What is our real relationship to the 
world? How ought we to properly articulate in carrying forward the 
functions of our Church with these portions of our communities that 
are not of our Church? I have been very much perplexed in my 
thinking to answer for myself these questions, and yet I have regarded 
them as vital and essential to the proper going forward of our work. 
I have recognized the fact that in an attempt to answer those questions 
some possible offense might be given to those whom we designate 
as being of the world and not of us. But I have regarded it as desir- 
able that they, as well as we, should know how we regard our mutual 
relationship. I have been particularly concerned with the question, be- 
cause I have thought that it has very definitely affected many con- 
ditions in the Church that I regard as being serious today. May I il- 
lustrate ? 

ILLUSTRATION 

There has come in upon us the practices, the fashions, and the 
rules of conduct, and a standard to which the world adhere. People 
of the world, living for things somewhat different than we profess 
to live for, have sought by different means to attain their goals in 
life. There are among these people many first class men and women, 
many whom I am proud to call friends, and many with whom we all 
associate, and to whom we look up as being desirable in every sense 
of the word. But among these many good people there are also 
numbers who are wholly devoid of any of the conceptions that we 
ourselves have with reference to our duties to God and to one an- 
other. There are great numbers who in no sense, either in principle 
or action, stand by the ideals for which we stand and to which we de- 
vote our lives. 

We find also that in the establishment of the various institutions 
that we have among us there has come, in many cases, to dominate, 
the spirit of the world. I have reference particularly to our homes. I 
know that any thoughtful man, who has had any opportunity for obser- 
vation, will be convinced that throughout the whole country there 
is a growing tendency and disposition on the part of men and women 



ELDER STEPHEN L. RICHARDS 



69 



not to regard the home in the same light which we have always re- 
garded it. I know that men and women, united under the bonds 
of matrimony, in many cases, altogether too numerous, have failed 
to make of the great institution of marriage that which God intended 
it should be ; and I know, as you know, that the time which is devoted 
to social affairs, so-called social affairs, precludes both men and women 
in the world from making home such as it ought to be, in order to in- 
sure a citizenship that will carry forward the great ideals of this land. 

Now, has it not come to be the case, in very many of the com- 
munities where Latter-day Saints dwell with non-"Mormon" neigh- 
bors, that the Latter-day Saints themselves have entered into some 
of the same practices and partaken of some of the same influences 
that have brought to pass the condition which I have named? I 
ask you, is it reasonable to expect that young men and young women 
may associate with their neighbors and friends not of the Church, par- 
take in all of their social pastimes, devote themselves to these so- 
called teas and card parties and club arrangements, and at the same 
time not partake of those influences that deter men and women from 
functioning, as God intended they should do, in the building up of 
■the race and in the maintenance of homes which constitute the very 
foundation of our society and national structure? Is it reasonable to 
think that that influence which always comes from close contact be- 
tween personalities, when it induces a course of action in one direc- 
tion, is not very apt to induce a course of action along all directions 
in which the society of the world moves ? 

EVERY LEGITIMATE OPPORTUNITY FOR SOCIAL INTERCOURSE SHOULD BE 
PROVIDED WITHIN THE CHURCH 

In my own thinking I have come to the conclusion that, while 
it may be possible for our people to hold close communion and inter- 
course with those who do not profess our standards and ideals, and 
maintain their integrity, their virtue, and maintain in purity their own 
ideals and standards, it is unlikely that they will do so ; and I am con- 
vinced that it is right that the institutions of the Church should provide 
for our people, particularly for our young people, for whom we are 
all deeply solicitous, the facilities, the advantages, the necessary op- 
portunity for expression of all that is good within them, and the neces- 
sary opportunity for all kinds of social intercourse, in order that we 
may preserve in its original purity the truth of the gospel of Jesus 
Christ. 

A MISTAKE TO MARRY THOSE NOT OF OUR FAITH 

I welcome the stranger within our gates ; I welcome a fair and 
proper intercourse between men and women not of our Church and 
those of the Church ; but I would deplore any lack of opportunity 
within our Church which should lead our young people, in particular. 



70 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



to think that they have to go beyond the confines of the Church to 
find the necessary opportunity for gratification of all their legitimate 
social desires. This question, in my judgment, has very important 
and divers bearings in all phases of our life. I observe, and you 
know, that no inconsiderable number of the young men and young 
women of this Church are marrying outside of the Church. I grant 
that some might say that a liberal, broad-minded, tolerant policy 
would welcome such a situation. I believe it to be the mind of the 
presiding authorities of this Church, as well as the mind of all thought- 
ful Latter-day Saints, that it is the profoundest mistake for young men 
and young women of this Church to marry those who are not adher- 
ents of its faith. Experience has' demonstrated in so many cases that 
it would not be possible to enumerate them, that such a union, in our 
conception of that great relationship, is a failure, and that only in 
the most exceptional of cases does it prove to be for the happiness 
and the welfare of the parties concerned. I believe, my brethren and 
sisters, that it is necessary that we shall maintain our standards and 
our ideals, in order that they may appeal to the world, and in order 
that the world, seeing our good works, may be led to adopt these 
principles for the guidance of their lives. 

THE GOSPEL, A LIGHT TO THE WORLD 

I read in our Doctrine and Covenants the following : 

And even so, I have sent mine everlasting gospel into the world to 
be a light to the world, and to be a Standard for my people and for the 
gentiles to seek to it, and to be a messenger before my face to prepare 
the way for me. 

I regard that message, coming from our Father, to indicate to 
us that first we must maintain the great, high, magnificent standard 
of living that he has given to us, and then by maintaining that standard 
we will attract the people of the world to it, and let them know of 
the vitality of the great principles that we espouse, by incorporating 
them into our lives. I believe that the world does not want our doc- 
trines under the label of "Mormonism." I am convinced that many of 
the principles for which we stand are acceptable to many men and 
women in the world. I am convinced that many are now in course 
of adoption, and that they are gaining great headway among all the 
peoples of the country. But I am convinced that they do not want 
these principles under the label of "Mormonism." They want to work 
into them in their own way. They want to incorporate them into life 
and society under different names. They do not want them under the 
name of "M,ormonism." But I want them under that label. I want 
them to be known as the great life-saving principles that have been 
revealed in the gospel of Jesus Christ. I want the world to know that 
the only security that there is for perfect life, for advancement, for 
progress, for peace, lies in the gospel of Jesus Christ. I want the 



ELDER STEPHEN L. RICHARDS 



71 



Lord to be recognized as the giver of all these great, good, and vir- 
tuous things. I believe that the only way in which we can sustain 
them as the principles of the gospel in unity, in their integrity, is by 
cultivating a close adherence to the Church, and maintaining the 
standards for which it stands. 

OUR FORCES SHOULD BE UNITED AGAINST SIN 

I endorse heartily the words that have been spoken concerning 
sin, and I regret, beyond expression, the fact that sin is creeping in 
among us. I believe it is our duty, as it scarcely ever was our duty 
before, to unite our forces against this incursion of sin, and in order 
that we may the better do it I am convinced that we must provide 
within the Church, as are now provided, means and facilities to satisfy 
all the legitimate desires of our people. 

WE MUST PROVIDE RECREATIONAL INSTRUCTION AND EDUCATION 

In order to make some practical application of the principles that 
I here advocate, I would like to suggest, particularly to the officers 
of the Church, those who have jurisdiction over its various organiza- 
tions, that in my humble judgment we are equipped with every neces- 
sary organization to provide adequate facilities for all of our people to 
fully and richly live. I think we have the necessary club facilities. I 
think we ought to provide the necessary facilities for recreation, and 
I feel that it is the proper time to provide such opportunities that our 
young people, in particular, will not think themselves obliged to re- 
ceive their recreational instruction and education — because education 
and instruction come as much from recreation as in any other way — 
from sources in no wise under our control, and which bring baneful 
influences in among us. 

When you come to consider the fact that the moving picture bus- 
iness has today come to be one of the very largest businesses of the 
country — I heard it rated only a short time ago as fourth — when you 
come to consider that that business and its projections appeal to all 
our people, in every hamlet, in every village, in every community 
where we dwell, is it not time that some effort should be made to di- 
rect and supervise and, if possible, control its large influence upon the 
lives and the characters of out people? Has the time not come when 
we should be willing and able to provide recreational facilities, so that 
it could not be said that the commercialized dance hall or the com- 
mercialized theatre, or circuits of vaudeville, have a monopoly on all 
of the dramatic presentations, carrying with them their influence 
and the force of their instruction? 

INDISCRIMINATE MIXTURE DEPRECATED 

My judgment is that we must meet the situation soon, and that 



72 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 

we must give to our people, within the organizations of the Church, 
all the opportunity necessary for the development of culture, for the 
development of their better selves; and that in order to do it, it will 
probably be necessary to stand somewhat aloof from the world, 
whether they like it or not. I cannot but think that when the Lord 
said that we were the salt of the earth, he intended that we should 
so preserve the great principles of truth committed to our custody that 
they would not be tainted or polluted by any outside worldly influence ; 
and I regard it as well nigh impossible to keep them in their undefiled 
purity if we permit an indiscriminate mixture with all the influences 
and practices and fashions and fads that come into our midst, brought 
by those who are not of us. 

Now, I do not wish to be considered as intolerant of others. I 
recognize a very great obligation to the stranger who has come among 
us. I recognize the obligation that has been referred to a number of 
times during this conference to give him that which we have. I tol- 
erate his views with full willingness ; without reservation I accord 
to him the privilege of worshiping how or whom he may. I want him 
to know that there are no people in all this broad land who more 
thoroughly believe in the true principles of liberty and freedom than 
do our people. But I would like him to know, at the same time, that 
we are trying to carry forward the work of God, that we regard 
ourselves as the custodians of the principles of truth, committed to us 
in this last dispensation by the Lord himself, through his divinely 
chosen prophet; and I would like him to know that we do not want 
those great principles of truth in the slightest degree corrupted by 
any notions, by any practice, by any fashions that he may introduce 
among us. 

CLOSE ADHERENCE TO THE ORGANIZATIONS OF THE CHURCH COUNSELED 

Therefore my thought is, and I propound it in the form of a ques- 
tion, my brethren and sisters : Is it not incumbent upon us in these 
perilous times to adhere close to the organizations of the Church, to 
make them function fully in the lives of the people and provide, as God 
himself in his infinite wisdom and mercy and kindness has provided 
for us, all necessary opportunity for the complete development of man- 
hood and womanhood, under the auspices of the holy Priesthood of 
God ? I pray that we may think and study and act, and I do it in the 
name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

After a number of notices had been given out in relation to the 
overflow meetings on Sunday, the choir and congregation sang the 
"Doxology." 

The closing prayer was offered by Elder John W. Hart, Presi- 
dent of the Rigby Stake of Zion. 

Conference was adjourned until Sunday morning.

THIRD DAY 



Conference continued in the tabernacle Sunday morning, Oct. 10, 



President Heber J. Grant called the congregation to order at 10 
o'clock. 

The choir and congregation sang, "The Spirit of God like a fire 
is burning." 

Patriarch Warren Smith of American Fork, Alpine Stake, offered 
the opening prayer. 

The choir and congregation sang, "Praise to the man who com- 
muned with Jehovah." 



It is more than a hundred years since the Prophet Joseph Smith 
received his first vision. It is more than ninety years since the Church 
was organized. It is more than eighty-eight years since the prophet 
received and gave to the world the revelation on the Word of Wis- 
dom. 



The thought of the amount of time that has elapsed since these 
important events in the Church took place suggests that I read the 
following from the seventh chapter of Matthew — a few of the last 
stanzas in the Sermon on the Mount. I begin at the 15th verse: 

Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but 
inwardly they are ravening wolves. 

Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns, 
or figs of thistles? 

Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree 
bringeth forth evil fruit. 

A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree 
bring forth good fruit. 

Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast 
into the fire. 

Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them. 

Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the 
kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in 
heaven. 

Many will say to me in that day Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied 
in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done 
many wonderful works? 

And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, 
ye that work iniquity. 

Therefore whosoever [I draw attention to these words after these 
long years have passed in the history of the Church] therefore, whosoever 
heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them,, I will liken him unto a 
wise mao, which built his house upon a rock; 



1920.

A LESSON FROM THE SERMON ON THE MOUNT

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, 
and beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was founded upon a rocK. 

And every one that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them 
not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, which built his house upon the 
sand: 

And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, 
and beat upon that house; and it fell: and great was the fall of it. 

"WE STAND FOR THE NON-USE AND NON-SALE OF tobacco" 

More than eighty-eight years since the Word of Wisdom was 
given to the world through the Prophet Joseph Smith. A business 
man of this city stated in my presence a few days ago that the stir 
we are making with respect to the use of tobacco is having the ef- 
fect of increasing rather than having the effect of decreasing the 
amount of tobacco that is being used. This man needs but to be 
associated with our Church auxiliary organizations in order to learn 
that his assertion is not correct. If he had looked into the faces 
of those who assembled this morning as Mutual Improvement offi- 
cers and other workers, if he had seen their clean faces, if he could 
know their clean lives, if he could know the intensity of their deter- 
mination to labor for the improvement, the education, the uplift of 
the young people of the Church, he would realize that his assertion 
is not correct. Audiences of this same quality I see when meeting 
with the Young Men's Mutual Improvement workers in the various 
stakes of Zion. And what can be said of these can be said also of 
the workers in the Young Ladies' Mutual Improvement Associations, 
of the workers in the Relief Society, in the Sabbath Schools, in the 
Primary organizations and in the Religion Classes. 

The slogan of the Mutual Improvement Associations for this 
year is: "We stand for the non-use and non-sale of tobacco." When 
our legislature was in session recently one active Mutual Improvement 
worker presented a bill in the state senate providing for the abolition 
of the cigarette in the state of Utah. When he presented his argu- 
ments in favor of this measure his fellow legislators told him there 
was no sentiment or little sentiment in the state of Utah in favor of 
legislation of that sort and no serious demand for it. 

IS THE SENTIMENT OF THE PEOPLE FOR THE WORD OF WISDOM? 

I want to know whether we believe in the Prophet Joseph Smith 
or not. I want to know if this great multitude of people, assembled 
in this historic place, followers of the Prophet Joseph Smith, wor- 
shipers of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, believe in these revela- 
tions nearly eighty-eight years since that revelation was given. 
The President of the Church said in one of our meetings a little 
while ago: "Certainly in this length of time we ought to begin to see 
the fruits of our labors." 

The promises that are made in the Word of Wisdom and which 
were read yesterday by President Rudger Clawson, are, or ought 
to be in themselves, enough to induce us to live in accordance with 



ELDER RICHARD R. LYMAN 



75 



the teachings of this great revelation. Nor is it necessary for us to 
base our conclusions with respect to these matters entirely upon this 
revelation. 

ANDREW D. WHITE ON TOBACCO 

One of the great American educators, only a few years ago, asked 
the multitude of teachers who were before him, to go out and take 
to the young people of the country a message from him, Andrew D. 
White, against the habit of smoking. I wrote to this great teacher and 
college president later with respect to this matter. One sentence of 
his reply reads : "I consider any young man at school, in college or 
in any professional school, is seriously, indeed, almost fatally handi- 
capped by the habit of smoking." Andrew D. White was a great 
educator, and statesman. It was he who served so ably as ambassa- 
dor to the Imperial German empire. It was he who, as a professor 
at the University of Michigan, and as president of the Cornell Uni- 
versity, lived in close touch with college men for a period of fifty 
years. 

That the Latter-day Saints have a tremendous work to do we 
all agree. We can only do this work well if we live in accordance 
with the teachings of the gospel of Jesus Christ. We cannot stand 
around with our hands in our pockets and get things accomplished. 
We cannot drink tea, we cannot drink coffee, we cannot drink liquor, 
we cannot use tobacco, we cannot be unkind, or dishonest, and in 
reason expect to accomplish our tremendous task. If we live these 
teachings we shall be known everywhere for our good works — the 
charity that we extend, the kindness that we put forth, and the honor 
which characterize our dealings. These are the genuine products of 
the gospel of Jesus Christ. 

SENTIMENTS OF DAVID STARR JORDAN 

Another quotation on the subject of smoking from the great 
educator, David Starr Jordan : "I am not much of a mathematician, 
said the cigarette, but I can add to man's nervous troubles, I can 
subtract from his physical energy, I can multiply his aches and pains, 
I can divide his mental powers, I can take interest from his work and 
I can discount his chances of success." 

Another from Dr. Jordan. This I heard quoted many years 
ago by President Heber J. Grant : "Boys who smoke cigarettes are 
like wormy apples. They drop long before the harvest time. They 
rarely make failures in after life, because they don't have any after 
life. When the other boys are taking hold of the world's work these 
are concerned with the sexton and the undertaker." 

APPEAL TO ENFORCE THE LAWS 

"Whosoever," says the great Master, "whosoever heareth these 
words of mine and doeth them, I shall liken unto a wise man who 



76

built his house upon a rock and the rains descended and the floods 
came and the winds blew and beat upon this house and it fell not, for it 
was founded on a rock." I appeal to you as a young man, as a 
Mutual Improvement worker, one who is interested, intensely so, in 
the welfare of the boys of this state, I appeal to you every one to see 
to it that the laws of the state, as they exist today, are enforced, that 
these boys who, in their ignorance are destroying, by the use of cig- 
arettes, their chance of success may be protected against themselves. 

OUR DETERMINATION 

An election is coming. I wish that in all the conventions all 
over the state the same resolution had been adopted that was presented 
and adopted in one of the counties by one of the political parties. I 
think they used these words: "We stand for the non-use and the 
non-sale of tobacco in the state of Utah." 

When the next legislature meets, I beg of you, see to it that 
the men who represent you realize that there is in Utah a determina- 
tion to preserve the brains, the memories and the reasoning powers of 
our boys. We are determined to increase and not decrease their 
chances of success. Whosoever heareth these teachings and liveth in 
accordance with them, the great Master himself has likened unto the 
wise man who built his house upon the rock. The rains descended, 
the winds blew, the floods came and beat upon the house, and it fell 
not, for it was founded on a rock. Let the legislators know that our 
faith, too, is founded on a rock, I ask it through Jesus Christ. Amen. 

Emma Lucy Gates Bowen sang a solo, the words of which are 
found on page 66, L. D. S. Hymn Book, "Should you feel inclined 
to censure." 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD 

I am very happy, my brethren and sisters, that I find myself in 
complete accord with my brethren, and with all that has been said dur- 
ing the sessions of this wonderful conference. M an y times, as I ha*e 
sat here looking upon this wonderful scene — the gathering of the chil- 
dren of the Latter-day Saints who entered these valleys — I have been 
thinking, again and again, of the question : Do we really realize who 
we are and why we are here? 

WHO ARE WE? 

I am sure if we shall give it a moment's thought it will impress 
itself upon us that our being here is no ordinary circumstance ; and 
if we shall give attention to what the Lord has said, I am sure we shall 
be convinced that we are no ordinary race of individuals. We have 
learned, through the revelations of the Lord in this dispensation, that 
when "one of a city and two of a family" should be gathered, as we 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD 77 

have been gathered from the nations of the earth, those who would 
thus be gathered would be the children of Israel; and individually 
we have received assurances, through the words of the inspired patri- 
archs, that we are descendants of Joseph who was sold into Egypt, 
upon whose posterity were placed blessings beyond the blessings of 
his progenitors, and these blessings are ours, even to the utmost bounds 
of the everlasting hills, where we are now assembled. 

We have learned that the Lord has had in training, before they 
came into this world , tried and tested individuals, even as he revealed 
to Abraham, to be his leaders in the various dispensations — men whom 
he knew, prophets, statesmen, wise men, and leaders for all nations. 1 
am convinced also that when our Father sent these leaders into the 
world he did not send them alone. He sent, in connection with them, 
hosts of other tried souls who would be helps to those who were se- 
lected of the Lord to be his leaders. I believe, therefore, that when 
the time came for the birth into the world of the chosen prophet, 
Joseph Smith, who was selected before he came into the world to be 
the prophet of this last dispensation, — he did not come alone, but 
there came with him men and women like unto himself, tried souls. 
God knew them. He held them in reserve for ages, until this day 
should dawn. They were scattered among the nations of the earth. 
They were born in those houses where the blood of Israel still re- 
mained, and inherited the promises made to our ancient fathers. These 
choice souls were sifted among the nations of the earth, but they heard 
the call, and they came willingly because they had to, in very many in- 
stances ; and the Lord gave them no peace in their native lands. Their 
own homes were closed against them. They were denied admittance 
to their former circles, and so the way was closed up behind them, 
and the way was opened up before them. They followed the inspira- 
tion of the Spirit as it appealed to their souls, and the circumstances 
with which they were surrounded made it necessary for them to come. 
They came here that they may inherit the blessings and promises made 
unto their fathers. So I bear witness to you that the Lord not only 
called them but he was sifting them out as they came to these abiding 
places of the Latter-day Saints, sifting them out by trial, by difficulty, 
by the hardship of crossing the sea and crossing the plains, and the 
difficulties of the desert. All these things were as a sieve, parting 
those who would have been of no great profit in the establishment of 
this work, from those who had the faith, the quality and the power 
necessary to contribute to the establishment of Latter-day Zion. So 
I am impressed, my brethren and sisters, that we are shown whom we 
are — chosen sons and daughters of God, sent into the world in this 
age for a specific purpose, and we are gathered here for the accomp- 
lishment of definite things. 

THE CHOSEN SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF GOD 

I want to read what the Lord said on this subject. You will find 



78 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



in the eighty-sixth section of the book of Doctrine and Covenants, 
beginning with the fourth paragraph, these words : 

But behold, in the last days, even now while the Lord is beginning 
to bring forth the word, and the blade is springing up and is yet tender. 

Behold, verily I say unto you, the angels are crying tvnto the Lord day 
and night, who are ready and waiting to be sent forth to reap down the 
fields; 

But the Lord saith unto them, pluck not up the tares while the blade 
is yet tender, (for verily your faith is weak) lest you destroy the wheat also. 

Therefore let the wheat and the tares grow together until the harvest 
is fully ripe, that ye shall first gather out the wheat from among the tares, 
and after the gathering of the wheat, behold and lo! the tares are bound 
in bundles, and the field remaineth to be burned. 

Therefore, thus saith the Lord, unto you, with whom the Priesthood 
hath continued through the lineage of your fathers. 

For ye are lawful heirs, according to the flesh, and have been hid from 
the world with Christ in God; 

Therefore your life and the Priesthood hath remained and must needs 
remain through you and your lineage, until the restoration of all things 
spoken by the mouths of all the holy prophets since the world bega.n. 

Therefore, blessed are ye if ye continue in my goodness, a light unto 
the Gentiles, and through this Priesthood, a savior unto my people, Israel. 
The Lord hath said it. • 

I am willing to accept this statement. I believe it. I am con- 
vinced that the Latter-day Saints are the "wheat," and they have been, 
and are being gathered out from the midst of the "tares" of the earth. 
They are the salt of the earth, and the gathering of the wheat from 
the midst of the tares is almost completed. There remains but the 
gleaning of the wheat; and when the wheat is gathered the tares shall 
be bound in bundles, and the burning time remaineth for them. The 
Lord gathered this people out from the midst of the nations of the 
earth to preserve them from the desolations that would come. 

I bear witness to you that the angels of God, who hold the power 
delegated to them to pour out his judgments upon the wicked, marvel 
at God's leniency and patience to this generation. That is why they 
cried: "Why are we not permitted to go forth?" They are stayed 
and held back. 

THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THIS GENERATION 

I believe that great responsibility rests upon this generation, be- 
cause light has come into the world, and men sin in the presence of 
light and knowledge, and thereby their condemnation exceeds the 
condemnation of Sodom and Gomorrah. I believe that the Lord not 
only called the Latter-day Saints here to escape the judgments of the 
world, but he called us here to be a light unto the gentiles ; the world's 
hope, the world's inspiration. God has assigned a mission to the Lat- 
ter-day Saints. Let us not forget it. 

' I believe that we are to solve the problems of the world, and when 
I think of one of the most distressful things that exists in the world 
today — the great conflict between capital and labor, that is rending 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD 79 

the nations, that is poisoning the hearts of men, I feel that the Lat- 
ter-day Saints have a great mission to point the way for the solution 
of those questions. I believe the Latter-day Saints are one hundred 
years nearer their solution than anybody else in the world. The Lord 
gave us the key a long time ago; but we were not prepared to live 
up to it at that time. So, when he discovered our lack of training 
and ability to do this work, the Lord gave us another principle, known 
as the law of tithing; and the law of tithing, he states in these revela- 
tions, was to act as a schoolmaster to bring us to the higher law, the 
order that was established among Enoch and his people, by which 
there was no rich and no poor among them. I want to bear witness 
to you that the time of our probation in that school will not be forever. 
. I beleieve there are hundreds and thousands of Latter-day Saints who 
have profited under that schoolmaster, so that they are about ready 
for graduation, and I believe the day of their graduation is coming. 
When the Lord shall see fit, they shall be called by the leaders of this 
Church to join in the grand demonstration that shall prove, not "only 
to the Latter-day Saints but to the world, that the right order of things 
God ordained from the beginning can and will be established in these 
latter days. So, if we have not profited under this schoolmaster, if we 
have been poor attendants, if we have been truants, if we are not ready 
for graduation, let us repeat, my brethren and sisters, and resolve 
we are going to be honest with the Lord in the payment of our tith- 
ing, that we may be among those who shall be ready for promotion, 
and the accomplishment of these glorious purposes. For Zion must 
show the way. We have the key. We know the way, and we are in 
training to accomplish those things. I want to advise you, my brethren 
and sisters, there is no solution to those questions, except by and 
through the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. 

RESPONSIBILITY OF RICH AND POOR 

I will read you a few more words from the fifty-sixth section of 
the Doctrine and Covenants, sixteenth verse — an inspired statement 
that seems to fit exactly our times : 

Woe unto you rich men, that will not give your substance to the poor, 
for your riches will canker your souls; and this shall be your lamentation 
in the day of visitation, and of judgment, and of indignation.— The harvest 
is past, the summer is ended, and my soul is not saved. 

Do no let us mistake, my brethren and sisters, the meaning of 
the Lord. He has no purpose to deny the rich the blessings of heaven. 
He has no enmity in his heart against the rich whose hearts are broken, 
and who give to' the maintenance of his work. I rejoice that in this 
Church we do have men of wealth and means whose hearts are broken, 
and who pay their honest tithing, whose example is a shining one for 
all Latter-day Saints ; but there are those who live only for themselves, 
who hold all they get for themselves, and therein they are in jeopardy. 

I am reminded again of the suggestion made by the President in 



80 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



the opening of this conference, when he read us the letter from Brother 
and Sister McCune, giving their beautiful home to the Church — a 
splendid example for all others in their circumstances to follow. Our 
safety is in keeping the commandments of the Lord. The solution of 
the world's troubles will not come by the rich banding together and 
thinking only of themselves. Then the Lord said : 

Wbe unto you poor men, whose hearts are not broken, whose spirits 
are not contrite, and whose bellies are not satisfied, and whose hands 
ara not stayed from laying hold upon other men's goods, whose eyes are 
full of greediness, who will not labor with your own hands. 

Do you know anybody like that ? The world is full of them ! It 
is a sin of this age, that men of poverty become envious and are in as 
great condemnation before the Lord as the rich whose hearts are not 
broken, who are full of envy, who are full of malice toward those 
who have some of the things of this world. That is the spirit of 
Bolshevism. It should have no place in the hearts of Latter-day Saints. 
The • poor should love the rich, and the rich should love the poor, 
otherwise we shall never come into universal brotherhood and reach a 
solution of these problems, which we hope to be able to solve, by and 
through the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. 

But blessed are the poor [yes, and the rich, too], 

Blessed are the poor who are pure in heart, whose hearts are broken, 
and those spirits are contrite, for they shall see the kingdom of God com- 
ing in power and great glory unto their deliverance; for the fatness of the 
earth shall be theirs. 

For behold, the Lord shall come, and his recompense shall be with him, 
and he shall reward every man, and the poor shall rejoice; 

And their generations shall inherit the earth from generation to gener- 
ation, for ever and ever. 

I am just simple enough to believe it. There is no solution of 
these problems outside of the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ, and by 
adherence to these things the rich and the poor shall live together as 
brothers. We shall not be banded off, one group of laborers into one 
class, fighting only for themselves and their own against all others. 
We shall be living together in the spirit of love and co-operation. I 
believe that it is necessary that we Latter-day Saints should keep our 
minds upon these things, for this is the goal to which we are destined 
to come. 

SALVATION TO ISRAEL 

Then there is one other promise that was made. We were not 
only to be a light unto the Gentiles ; we were to be the means of bring- 
ing salvation to Israel ; and in conclusion I want to read a few words 
from the forty-fifth section of the book of Doctrine and Covenants, on 
that subject. These words are a repetition to Joseph Smith, on the 7th 
day of March, 1831, of words originally spoken by the Master upon 
the Mount of Olives, when he was discussing with the disciples the 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD 



81 



judgment that would come upon Jerusalem, its destruction, the dis- 
persion of the Jews, and then their gathering again, and the coming 
of the Lord in the last days. He said, beginning with the twenty-sec- 
ond verse: 

Ye say that ye know that the end of the wold comieth; ye say also 
that ye know that the heavens and the earth shall pass away; 

And in this ye say truly, for so it is; but these things which I have 
told you shall not pass away until all shall be fulfilled, 

And this I have told you concerning Jerusalem, and when that day 
shall come, shall a remnant be scattered among all nations; 

But they shall be gathered again, but they shall remain until the 
times of the Gentiles be fulfilled. 

And in that day shall be heard of wars and rumors of wars, and the 
whole earth shall be in commotion, and men's hearts shall fail them, and 
they shall say that Christ delayeth his coming until the end of the earth. 

And the love of men shall wax cold, and iniquity shall abound; 

And when the times of the Gentiles is come in, — [that is, the beginning 
of this period] — 

And when the times of the Gentiles is come in, a light shall break 
forth among them that sit in darkness, and it shall be the fulness of my 
gospel; 

But they receive it not, for they perceive not the light and they turn 
their hearts from me because of the precepts of men; 

And in that generation [the generation when the light shall break 
forth] 

And in that generation shall the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled. 
THE GOSPEL FIRST TO THE GENTILES 

Now, my brethren and sisters, plainly as anything that the Lord 
has ever given us, we understand that the beginning of the times 
of the Gentiles was when the light broke forth in these latter days, 
and the gospel was given first to the Gentiles. It was written in 
olden times that those who were first, the Jews, who received the gos- 
per first in former days, should be last in receiving it in the latter 
days ; and those who were last in receiving the gospel in former days, 
namely, the Gentiles, shal be first in the latter days. So the gospel dis- 
pensation in the latter days was to the Gentiles first; and now our 
souls thrill when we think of the great labor that has been accomp- 
lished among the Gentile nations for nearly a hundred years. For it 
is a hundred years ago now since that light began to break forth, and 
finally came in its fulness, ten years later, when the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints was established in the earth; and for all 
these many years, by thousands and tens of thousands, the elders of 
this Church have preached the gospel among the Gentile nations, and 
the blood of Israel hath been gathered out from the midst of the Gen- 
tiles, until the day of gleaning draweth nigh. There shall come a day 
when the Gentiles shall reject this gospel, they will close their doors 
against it. That will be the day when the wheat is gathered and when 
the salt of the earth is taken from among them. When that day comes 
they will care no more for the word of God, and they will close their 



' ■ 



82 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 

doors aganist it. When that day comes then cometh the day of the 
redemption of Israel, and that day is nigh at hand. For, when the 
Gentiles shall begin to reject this word, Israel shall begin to receive 
it. We see the evidences of God's preparation for that great work of 
the redemption of Israel under way. Our souls were thrilled as we saw 
the armies of the Allies march through the land of Palestine, and 
break down the power that had held that land under its dominion, in 
cruelty, for ages. 

THE JEWS NOW TURNING TOWARD JERUSALEM 

Now our souls are thrilled to see our half brothers, the Jews, 
turning toward the land of promise ; and for the first time since their 
long dispersion one of their own people, an orthodox Jew, is the ruler 
of the land of Palestine. The Jews will go there. God knows how to 
bring them. He did it in our case, and he knows how to bring them. 
They may say they will not go, but they will. The Lord will hedge 
up the way behind them, and he will open up the way before them, and 
unto his appointed place they shall go, in preparation for their conver- 
sion at the hands of the Master. For he shall come in the day of their 
trouble, to their deliverance. He will stand upon the Mount of Olives, 
which shall cleave in twain, and a valley shall open for their rescue 
from their oppressors ; and when they come to the feet of their Deliv- 
erer they shall see the marks of the nails in his feet and in his hands, 
and shall say: "What are these wounds?" Then he shall say unto 
them : "I am Jesus Christ, who was crucified. These are the wounds 
I received in the house of my friends." Then shall a nation be con- 
verted in a day, and shall respond and become God's chosen people. 

THE LAMANITES TO BE REMEMBERED 

Then another part of the House of Israel, the children of Father 
Lehi shall. not be forgotten, though they have long been in dispersion. 
A prophet of old, in the Book of Mormon, said that at the hands of 
the Gentiles they would suffer and be scattered, but again the Gentiles 
should become their blessing. I bear witness to you that God, through 
the Gentile nations, is preparing the Indians of this, the American con- 
tinent, through their allotments of land, through their education, and 
in divers other ways, for the acceptance and living of his gospel, and 
the day of their redemption draweth nigh. The Lord said, in the third ■ 
section of the Doctrine and Covenants, that for this very purpose the 
Book of Mormon was given to the Latter-day Saints, to bring to 
pass the redemption of Father Lehi's children, the Lamanites. 

THE LOST TRIBES SHALL ALSO HEAR 

Not only the Lamanites, but others of Israel shall hear — the lost 
tribes, to whom the Master said he would go, and they should hear 
his voice. My witness and testimony is that they are preparing them- 
selves ; that even now their prophets prophecy of their deliverance and 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD 83 

are preparing that people. The mountains of ice shall flow down 
before them, and a highway shall be cast up, and they shall come forth 
with songs of everlasting joy, to be crowned at the hands of the chil- 
dren of Ephraim. These are only a few of the glorious things that 
are before us. It is for that purpose we are assembled here. Let us 
look upon the means which God has given us as only a means to an end, 
and not the end' itself. 

OUR POSITION, STATION AND PRIVILEGE 

This is our station ; this is our position. These are our privileges ; 
and oh ! when we look upon them in all their glory, how mean, how 
small, and how petty it seems to me for us to get down and quarrel with 
each other, and backbite, and slander, and fight over the petty little 
things, and forget the glorious purposes God had in bringing us here. 

Now, the Lord keep our hearts upon his purpose and his mission 
for us, that we may be true unto him, and fail not to come unto the 
standard of perfection necessary to become the light of the world, the 
redeemers upon Mount Zion for Israel, the salt of the earth, the city 
set upon a hill, whose light shall shine forth to all men, and attract 
the good and the great from all nations, who shall come and say : "Let 
us go up unto the mountain of the house of the God of Jacob," for the 
light to the Gentiles is manifest, "and learn of her ways and walk in 
her paths," and become so perfect that we shall attract the attention 
of the angels of heaven ; and the Lord Jesus Christ shall come again 
to live upon the earth among men, I humbly pray in the name of the 
Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. 

At the close of Elder Ballard's sermon, President Grant proposed 
that out of love and respect to the prophet Joseph Smith, all the Lat- 
ter-day Saints would like to arise and sing, "We thank thee, O God, 
for a prophet." This was done with great spirit. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

I had no idea of saying anything more at this conference, but 
after listening to the very splendid remarks of Elder Ballard, I de- 
sire to read a revelation given a year before the Church was organ- 
ized. 

REVELATION TO HYRUM SMITH AND COMMENTS THEREON 

This revelation, among other things, says that it is not only for 
the man to whom it was given — Hyrum Smith, who was martyred 
with his brother, the Prophet Joseph Smith — but that it is to all of 
us, and therefore I desire to read it : 

A great and marvelous work is about to come forth among the chil- 
dren of men. 

Behold, I am God, and give heed to my word, which is quick and 



84 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



powerful, sharper than a two-edged sword, to the dividing asunder of both 
joints and marrow; therefore give heed unto my words. 

Behold the field is white already to harvest, therefore whoso de- 
sireth to reap, let him thrust in his sickle with his might, and reap while 
the day lasts, that he may treasure up for his soul everlasting salvation 
in the kingdom of God; 

Yea, whosoever will thrust in his sickle and reap, the same is called 
of God; 

Therefore, if you will ask of me you shall receive; if you will knock 
it shall be opened unto you. 

I will say that Hryum Smith and many other men came to the 
Prophet Joseph, believing that he was in very deed a prophet, believ- 
ing that God had chosen him to organize again the Church of Christ 
upon the earth, they came to him and asked : "What does the Lord 
desire at our hands?" And many of the revelations in the fore-part 
of the Doctrine and Covenants were given, before the organization 
of the Church, to individuals, in answer to this inquiry that they made 
of the prophet. This section I am reading is one of those revela- 
tions : 

Therefore, if you will ask of me you shall receive; if you will knock 
it shall be opened unto you. 

Now, as you have asked, behold, I say unto you, keep my command- 
ments. 

THE KEY-NOTE OF THIS CONFERENCE 

Remember, ye Latter-day Saints, that that is the key-note of this 
conference. 

Keep my commandments, and seek to bring forth and establish the 
cause of Zion, 

Seek not for riches, but for wisdom, and behold, the mysteries of 
God shall be unfolded unto you, and then shall you be made rich. Behold, 
he that hath eternal life is rich. 

"Verily, verily, I say unto you, even as you desire of me, so it shall 
be done unto you; and if you desire, you shall be the means of doing 
much good in this generation. 

TRIBUTE TO HYRUM SMITH 

No mortal man who ever lived in this Church desired more to 
do good than did Hyrum Smith, the patriarch. I have it from the 
lips of my own sainted mother, that of all the men she was acquainted 
with in her girlhood days in Nauvoo, she admired Hyrum Smith 
most for his absolute integrity and devotion to God, and his loyalty 
to the prophet of God. And God honored that man by allowing to 
come from his loins the late beloved President Joseph F. Smith. 

The devil, through his emissaries, thought to destroy this Church 
by having them kill the prophet and the patriarch ; but the son ' of 
the patriarch lived to be the Prophet of the living God, and his great- 
grandson sits here today as the Presiding Patriarch of the Church. 
Nothing can be done by the people of the world to retard the progress 
of the work of God. Murder and all that has been done against the 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 



85 



Latter-day Saints has had no effect whatever. The work of God 
has gone steadily on from the day that the Church was organized 
with only six members. 

Verily, verily, I say unto you, even as you desire of me, so it shall 
be done unto you; and if you desire, you shall be the means of doing 
much good in this generation. 

Say nothing but repentance unto this generation: keep my com- 
mandments, and assist to bring forth my work, according to my com- 
mandments, and you shall be blessed. * * * 

Behold thou hast a gift, or thou shalt have a gift if thou wilt desire 
of me in faith, with an honest heart, believing in the power of Jesus Christ, 
or in my power which speaketh unto thee; 

For, behold, it is I that speak; behold, I am the light which shineth 
in darkness, and by my power I give these words unto thee. 

And now, verily, verily, I say unto thee, put your trust in that Spirit 
which leadeth to do good; yea, to do justly, to walk humbly, to judge 
righteously, and this is my Spirit. 

No man in all the Church put his trust in that Spirit more per- 
fectly than did Hyrum Smith, or than did his son, the late prophet, 
Joseph F. Smith. 

Verily, verily, I say unto you, I will impart unto you of my Spirit; 
which shall enlighten your mind, which shall fill your soul with joy. 

And then shall ye know, or by this shall you know all things whatso- 
ever you desire of me, which are pertaining unto things of righteousness, 
in faith believing in me that you shall receive. 

Behold, I command you, that you need not suppose that you are 
called to preach until you are called. 

Remember, the Church was not yet organized. 

Wait a little longer, until you shall have my word, my rock, my church, 
and my gospel, that you may know of a surety my doctrine; 

And then behold, according to your desires, yea, even according to 
your faith, shall it be done unto you. * * * 

Keep my commandments, hold your peace, appeal unto my Spirit. 

Yea, cleave unto me with all your heart, that you may assist in bring- 
ing to light those things of which have been spoken; yea, the translation 
of my work; be patient until you shall accomplish it. 

The work of the translation of the inspired record, the Book of 
Mormon, was in progress at the time of the giving of this revela- 
tion. "Behold, this is your work," and it is the work of all the Latter- 
day Saints : 

Behold, this is your work, to keep my commandments, yea, with all 
your might, mind, and strength; 

Seek not to declare my word, but first seek to obtain my word, and 
then shall your tongue be loosed; then, if you desire, you shall have my 
Spirit and my word, yea the power of God unto the convincing of men; 

But now hold your peace, study my word which hath gone forth 
among the children of men, and also study my word which shall come 
forth among the children of men, or that which is now translating, yea, 
until you have obtained all which I shall grant unto the children of men 
in this generation, and then shall all things be added thereunto.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Behold, thou art Hyrum, my son, seek the kingdom of God, and all 
things shall be added according to that which is just. 
Build upon my rock, which is my gospel; 

Deny not the Spirit of revelation, nor the Spirit of prophecy, for woe 
unto him that denieth these things; 

Therefore, treasure up in your heart until the time which is in my 
wisdom that you shall go forth. 

Behold, I speak unto all who have good desires, and have thrust in 
their sickle to reap. (Doctrine and Covenants Sees. 6 and 11.) 

THE SAINTS EXPECTED TO STUDY THIS REVELATION 

Read this revelation, ye Latter-day Saints, over and over again, 
because it applies to you ; and time and time again you will find that 
the Lord Jesus Christ, who gave this revelation, repeats himself in 
saying: "Keep my commandments." 

Behold, I am Jesus Christ, the Son of God. I am the life and the 
light of the world. 

I am the same who came unto my own and my own received me not; 

But verily, verily, I say unto you, that as many as receive me, to them ■ 
will I give power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on 
my name. Amen. 

We will now ask Brother Joseph W. McMurrin to speak to us 
briefly. Brother McMurrin has proclaimed this gospel of Jesus 
Christ on three separate and distinct missions in Europe. He is now 
proclaiming the gospel as the President of the California mission. 

ELDER JOSEPH W. McMURRIN 

(Of the First Council of Seventy and President of the California Mission) 

My heart has been made exceedingly glad, my brethren and sis- 
ters, in listening to the doctrines of the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ 
as they have been expounded by the brethren of the presiding author- 
ities of the Church who have been called upon, during the sessions of 
this conference, to bear record concerning the truth. I thank the Lord, 
my brethren and sisters, that I have the opportunity of being present 
in this great gathering, and I am glad in my soul for the joy that is in 
my heart in connection with the wonderful purposes of Almighty God 
as they are being wrought out among the inhabitants of the earthj and 
among the people also who have given allegiance to the work of the 
Lord, and who have come up from the east and from the west, from 
the north and from the south, in response to the call that has been 
made by the Redeemer of the world through the glorious gospel that 
has been restored in this last dispensation. 

It has already been stated, my brethren and sisters, that it is my 
good fortune at the present time to be laboring in the missionary field, 
in the California mission. The California mission covers the state 
of California, and portions of the state of Nevada, and portions of 
the state of Arizona. We have about thirty branches of the Church 
in these three states. The great bulk of the Church population resides 



ELDER JOSEPH W. McMURRIN 



87 



in the state of California. California is not made up of people who 
are seeking, to any very great degree, to find the message of the 
everlasting gospel. There are, however, many very good men and 
women to be found in the state. Sometimes when our missionaries are 
attending to their missionary labors, going from home to home, seek- 
ing opportunity to present the precious principles of the gospel, they 
are asked: "Why are you coming here? We do not need your ser- 
vices. We have an abundance of churches, many educated ministers, 
and there is no room or place for you here. Why do you not go with 
the message that you say you have, to the people who are in darkness, 
to the heathen nations of the world?" We are striving to impress 
upon the minds of men and women with whom we come in contact, 
that the gospel message, as it has been revealed in this dispensation, 
is just as it has been declared to be by inspired men who, lit up by di- 
vine inspiration, have said that the gospel should be preached in all the 
world, to every nation, and to every kindred, to every tongue and to 
every people. We are under obligation not only to carry the gospel 
to those who live in heathen nations, but we are under like obligation 
to carry the gospel to every nation and to every people upon the face 
of the whole earth. 

We are trying to impress upon the missionaries, the young men 
and young women who have been appointed from time to time, to 
take up their ministry in the California mission, that they are under a 
very serious responsibility, and that it is their right to know and feel 
that they have been called, not by bishops, not by presidents, not by 
apostles, to be ministers of salvation, but that they have been called by 
the Lord God of heaven to represent him in the preaching of the gospel 
in the California mission, and that they should dedicate to the Lord 
our God, their time and means and their talents. We teach them that 
they should seek unto our Father in heaven, by right living, and by 
humble and secret prayer, that they may have the companionship of 
that Spirit that can take of the things of the Father and reveal them 
unto men. We are trying to impress upon their minds that the gospel 
of the Redeemer of the world cannot be taught acceptably to our 
Father in heaven in the enticing words of man's wisdom, but that 
it must be taught and can only be taught satisfactorily to the Lord, 
in the power and demonstration of the Holy Spirit. We are trying to 
tell men and women everywhere, who are not of our faith, that the 
Lord Jesus Christ is the Son of the living God, that he is the author 
of salvation, and the only source of divine authority, and that in ful- 
filment of the promises that have been made by holy prophets in all 
past dispensations, the divine authority essential to the preaching of 
the gospel and administering in its holy ordinances has again been 
revealed by the Lord our God in this the dispensation of the fulness 
of times. 

We are trying to bear record of the truth, but we are not build- 
ing up men. We are in no way trying to exalt the names of men, but 



■ 



88 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 

we are trying to advance and magnify the gospel of the Redeemer, 
which is the power of God unto salvation. As we bear this record con- 
cerning the wonderful things of the Lord Jesus Christ and his restored 
gospel, we also feel that we are under obligation, because of the 
commandment of God, to bear record to the wonderful mission of the 
prophet and disciple and apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ, Joseph 
. Smith, for we feel and know in our hearts that God has placed this re- 
sponsibility upon us, and that we must tell the inhabitants of the earth, 
wherever our lot may be cast, that the Lord Almighty has chosen as his 
instrument, Joseph Smith, to reintroduce in the latter time, the precious 
principles of the everlasting gospel. 

We are trying to impress upon men that they cannot be saved by 
simply declaring with their lips the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, 
but that they must do, as he has taught, as has been advocated in this 
conference. Men must not only be hearers of the word, but they must 
be doers also. We are trying to impress upon men the necessity of 
repentance, to turn away from the evils that are in the world, and from 
all improper conduct and give their hearts and their time and their 
attention to the Lord Jesus Christ, repenting in very deed of their 
sins, but turning away from all sinful conduct. We are trying to im- 
press upon men the importance of the principle of baptism, the prin- 
ciple that has been given by the Lord our God whereby men can 
receive a remission of their sins. Baptism, to the world, is a mystery. 
Most men are unable to conceive the necessity or the advantage of 
this great principle that has been given of God whereby men may be 
made members of the Church of Christ, and receive a remission of 
theiir sins, and by this act of humble obedience be fitted to enter into 
the kingdom of God. We are trying to bear record to our father's chil- 
dren that they can only comprehend and understand the message of the 
everlasting gospel by the power of the Holy Ghost, and that they can 
only be in possession of the Holy Ghost by yielding obedience to the 
principles that have been revealed. The companionship of the Holy 
Ghost can only be received by the laying on of hands. We are try- 
ing to bear record to the people that men cannot call themselves 
to preach the gospel, but that they must be called by the Almighty ; they 
cannot assume to take this authority unto themselves, but they must 
be ordained by revelation, and by prophecy, and by the laying on of 
hands. 

I am glad to say God fills our souls with joy and peace and con- 
tentment as we strive to preach these principles among the people, 
and he increases upon us, testimony, understanding and knowledge 
concerning his wonderful purposes. I am glad to bring up to you 
fathers and mothers assembled in this conference the glad news that 
your sons and daughters believe the message of the everlasting gospel, 
and that they are consecrating their time and their lives to advocate 
the principles of salvation, and' to reach the hearts of men with the 
message that has been committed into their hands. 



ELDER JOSEPH W. McMURRIN 89 

I would that men who are in authority and who select missionaries 
and recommend them to the Presidency of the Church, would sense 
more fully the great responsibility that rests upon the people of the 
Latter-day Saints in the preaching of the gospel, and that they would 
not only call the boys and girls — thank God for all of these young men 
and women — but oh, that there might be called into the mission field 
men of experience, thirty or forty years of age, men who have had 
experience in teaching the gospel, that they might be a help and a 
succor, and a sustaining power to the youth of Israel who respond so 
generally and so cheerfully to these missionary appointments. 

I am glad with you, my brethren and sisters, in the work of God. 
I believe in it from the crown of my head to the soles of my feet. I 
have confidence that all the promises of the Lord our God will be 
fulfiHed, no matter how marvelous they may appear, or how past 
possibility they may seem in the minds of men. They will all be 
brought to pass. God has so decreed and he has the power to fulfil 
his decrees and his promises. God help us to believe the promises that 
have been made and to yield obedience to the commandments of God, 
and may we be under the constant guidance of that kind, forgiving, 
glorious Spirit that belongs to the gospel of the Redeemer of the world, 
I humbly pray, through Jesus Christ, our Lord. Amen. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

No more diligent, faithful, inspiring mission president have I 
ever been associated with than Elder Serge F. Ballif, while presid- 
ing over the Swiss and German mission. He has been called to go 
back again to that country. The gospel found his father there and 
he gave up a place as a preacher, I understand, to come here and 
labor for his livelihood in this land as a Latter-day Saint. We will 
now hear from the new president of the Swiss and German mission, 
Elder Serge F. Ballif. 



ELDER SERGE F. BALLIF 

(Newly appointed President of the Swiss and German Mission) 

My beloved brethren and sisters: I say "beloved brethren and 
sisters" because we are all here born into the kingdom of God 
through baptism, by faith and by a knowledge which we have re- 
ceived from heaven of this great work that has been restored in our 
day, and therefore I say, we are all brothers and sisters, children of 
our heavenly Father. I am grateful from the very bottom of my 
heart that I have a standing in the Church and Kingdom of God. 
I thank the Lord for the knowledge of the gospel which I have re- 
ceived, and I know beyond all question of doubt that the gospel of 
Jesus Christ is true. 



90 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



As intimated by President Grant, I have spent a great deal of 
time in the mission field. Since 1890, I have devoted a great part 
of my time to missionary work. I have traveled in all the provinces 
of Germany, of Austria, Hungary, Switzerland and France. I have 
borne my testimony before the authorities of those lands ; I have 
borne my testimony before kings ; and I can say to you, my brethren 
and sisters, that I am not ashamed of the gospel of Jesus Christ. 1 
know it is the power of God unto salvation, to all those who hear 
and render obedience unto its principles. 

I feel to say this morning, as the Savior said when he was talking 
to his people and one of his servants said : 

Thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to speak with 
thee. 

But he answered and said unto him that told him, Who is my 
mother? and who are my brethren? 

And he stretched forth his hand toward his disciples, and said, Be- 
hold my mother and my brethren! 

For whosoever shall do the will of my Father which is in heaven 
the same is my brother, and sister, and mother. 

I feel today that those who are keeping the commandments of 
God, they are my brethren, they are my sisters in very deed. 

While I was laboring in my last mission, I never will forget 
the time when a great conference was called in Berne, the capital 
of Switzerland, and the president of this Church — the prophet, seer 
and revelator, Joseph F. Smith — met with us in that confer- 
ence. In speaking to that people, he held out his hand and said : 
"The time will come when this land will be dotted with temples, where 
you can go and redeem your dead." I thank God from the bottom 
of my heart that I have been called again to go into that land, I 
want to do my mite to bring about the fulfilment of the prophecy by 
President Joseph F. Smith in the capital of Switzerland. I believe 
it with all my heart, that soon the time will come when there will 
be temples erected in that land of Switzerland, and I also believe, 
my brethren and sisters, that there is no greater mission in all the 
world today than the mission of preaching the gospel in continental 
Europe. I have traveled in all the provinces of Germany. I know 
the meek and lowly of Germany ; and notwithstanding the great 
troubles, and the great bloodshed in those lands, during the last few 
years, I want to say to you that you will find the blood of Israel 
among the people in those provinces. I say that there will be a great 
and a mighty work accomplished in that land. I wish to say, also, 
that I go to Germany to represent you, and I want to represent you 
honorably and nobly. In turn, I want you, as my brethren and sisters, 
to support me in that land, that I may be faithful, that I may keep 
the commandments of God, that I may set an example that will be 
worthy of emulation; that I can say to those people: "The people of 
Utah are serving God and keeping his commandments." That is 
the greatest testimony that I can give. I wish to say to that people 



ELDER SERGE F. BALLIF 



91 



lhat we are observing the Word of Wisdom, the word of God, that 
we are paying our tithes and our offerings. I want to say to them 
that we are laboring in the temples of God to redeem our dead. I 
want to say to those people that there is love and harmony among 
the Latter-day Saints; that they are a unit; that they support, with 
all their might, mind and strength, the authorities of this Church, 
from the head to the very last ordained member; that the spirit of 
love, the spirit of peace, the spirit of harmony is found among the 
Saints in Zion, and not the spirit of criticism or fault-finding, but 
that they are a united people. We are all laboring for one common 
purpose, and that is to establish the Kingdom of God, here upon the 
earth. 

One more thing I want to say. When the Savior was preaching 
and ministering among his people, the sick were healed, the lame 
walked, the blind were made to see under his hands ; and when he 
called his twelve apostles he set them apart and ordained them ; he 
gave them power to heal the sick and to accomplish the mission that 
he had begun; and he said: "I send you out without money, with- 
out price. Freely you have received, freely you shall impart." When 
you send your young men into the mission field, I want to ask you, 
my brethren and sisters, to instil into their souls the principles of 
the gospel, which will be worth more to them than unlimited means; 
and by so doing you will help to build them up in their testimonies 
and knowledge, that Jesus is the Christ, the Redeemer of the world, 
and that Joseph Smith is a prophet of God. I do not care whether 
they have a dollar in their pockets or not; if they have only thac 
spirit burning in their bosom, God will open the way before them. 
There will be friends raised up to them ; they will accomplish a great 
and a mighty work, and the people in those lands will receive them 
with open arms. While, on the other hand, if you send them out) 
there with their pockets filled with money, you know what they will 
do; I do not need to tell you. With all my soul I believe in preach- 
ing the gospel without money and without price. The laborer is 
worthy of his hire, and I am willing to put my trust in the Lord. I 
will promise you, my brethren and sisters, that I never will ask one 
of your boys, in the mission field, to do one thing that I will not do 
myself, with them, with the help of the Lord. God bless the Latter-day 
Saints. May we be united in keeping his commandments is my prayer, 
and I ask it, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The choir and congregation sang the beautiful anthem composed 
by Evan Stephens, "Let the mountains shout for joy." 

Benediction was pronounced by Elder Edward H. Snow, President 
of the St. George Stake of Zion. 

The congregation adjourned until 2 o'clock. 



92 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 

FIRST OVERFLOW MEETING 



An overflow meeting of the conference was held in the Assembly 
Hall at 10 o'clock Sunday morning, October 10, presided over by El- 
der Geo. F. Richards, of the Council of the Twelve. The singing 
and music were furnished by the Cottonwood Stake chdir under the di- 
rection of Elder W. F. Robinson, Miss Bernnetta Lindsey, accompa- 
nist. 

The choir and congregation sang, "Redeemer of Israel, our only 
delight." 

Prayer was offered by Elder Arthur F. Barnes of the Salt Lake 
stake High Council. 

The choir sang, "Dream of Paradise," solo by Elder Manassa 
Smith. 

ELDER NEPHI JENSEN 

(President of the Canadian Mission) 

My brothers and sisters, I am deeply thankful for this opportun- 
ity of coming to Zion to worship our God with you. I am thankful 
for the opportunity of listening to the sweet singing of the choir this 
morning. In my heart I pray that the sweet spirit which has actu- 
ated the singers will actuate rqe in what I shall say to you. I want 
to say the thing that ought to be said ; I want to speak the words that 
will help you and help me to a better and deeper appreciation of the 
truth which God has revealed to us in the day and time in which we 
live, for I do know in my heart that the gospel of Jesus Christ is true, 
I know it is the power of God unto salvation ; and the dearest desire 
of my heart, at this time, is to impress the children of men with the 
truthfulness of the gospel which has come to us as our greatest 
heritage-. 

My heart has often been touched when I have been made aware 
of the bad name which our people have been given in the world. Just 
a few weeks ago, one of our lady missionaries in Canada went to a 
home in Toronto with the view of offering to the people of that home 
the Pearl of Great Price. When she made known to the folks that she 
was a "Mormon," the lady of the house sneered at her and scorned 
her, and said, "I would rather feed a criminal than feed a 'Mormon.' " 

When that young girl came to the mission home, and made a re- 
port of her experience, I was deeply touched in my heart, and I re- 
solved that I would use the humble talent given to me in writing and 
in speaking the defense of the best people in the world. And since 
coming home I have been deeply grieved to find that, even here, some 
of us so far forget ourselves as to be guilty of the crime which has been 
responsible for placing upon the fair brow of our religion the hideous 



ELDER NEPHI JENSEN 



93 



mask ; I refer to the crime of slander. Our people have suffered as no 
people have suffered since the days of the ancient Saints because of 
the crime of slander, and I do hope and pray that this sin shall not 
creep in among us. I do hope and pray that we will remember the 
noble words of the great Shakespeare : "Who steals my purse, steals 
trash ; 'twas mine, tis his, and has been slave to thousands ; but he 
that filches from me my good name, robs me of that which not 
enriches him, but makes me poor indeed." These are noble words. 
They are as true as anything that ever was written, and I have taken 
pleasure in quoting these words in the mission in which I work, 
and I commend them to Israel at home. When I have met the sland- 
erers of our people and our faith, I have often said I would rather be 
a ghoul, a graverobber, and scratch around among dead bones and 
steal grave clothes than rob people of their good name. I want to 
tell you that there is nothing so small, so ignoble as the disposition 
to want to magnify other men's faults. There is nothing that so 
soon brands a person as a small and ignoble soul as the desire to make 
out other people bad. 

A few evenings ago I spoke in the open air near the city hall 
in the great city of Toronto. While I was speaking, a man in the 
crowd who had a grudge against the "Mormons," and especially 
against that grand and great man Brigham Young, shouted out while 
I was speaking, "What about Brigham Young?' 

My feathers were up immediately, and I said, Brigham Young 
was a grand man; he redeemed a wilderness, he built an empire, and 
endowed colleges and universities, and if he should be talking to us 
today, to the little souls who are barking at his heels, he would be apt 
to say, "I don't mind being swallowed by a whale, but I do hate to 
be nibbled to death by minnows.' And after all is said, it is only 
small dogs that bark at the heels of our people in the hope of making 
them bad. 

I was deeply touched last night in meeting with a friend who, im- 
mediately upon my mention of some prominent men in this city who 
have given their lives to the service of God and the uplift of this peo- 
ple, spoke in disparagement of those men. Every time we do that 
sort of thing we condemn ourselves, for the Apostle Paul, in his letter 
to the Romans, said: "Therefore, thou art inexcusable, O man, who- 
soever thou art that judgest, for wherein thou judgest another, thou 
condemnest thyself ; for thou that judgest doest the same things." I 
commend to you these inspired words of the Apostle Paul, and I com- 
mend to you also a motto which I saw in Chicago recently upon a 
great bill board : "Throw away your hammer and get a horn. Knock- 
ers never did themselves or anybody else any good." 

Now I feel that I have talked as long as I ought to. I want to say 
that I rejoice with all my heart in the knowledge I have of the di- 
vinity of this work. I know that Joseph Smith is a prophet of God, 
and I know that Heber J. Grant is a prophet of God, as I know 



94 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



that light is light. So I know that great man is God's prophet, for I 
know that during the last year, the promise which he sealed upon my 
head, when he set me apart to labor in the Canadian mission, has 
come true ; and I testify to you that God Almighty is with that man, 
and does sustain him and uphold him by the power of the Holy 
Ghost. God bless you. Amen. 

ELDER REY L. PRATT 

(President of the Mexican Mission) 

I am very grateful, my brethren and sisters, that I have the 
privilege of attending this conference. I am thankful to the Lord that 
we have inspired men to teach us the principles of the gospel, and I 
am more grateful than I could possibly express for the gospel, that 
has been restored to us in these days in which we live. I am thankful 
to the Lord for the gifts and the blessings of it. 

I am thankful to the Lord that I have a testimony of the truthful- 
ness of the gospel, and that the power of the Priesthood is upon the 
earth today ; and I know as I know that I live that the men who stand 
today at the head of the Church are men endowed with the power of 
the Lord, and they are in very deed prophets, seers and revelators un- 
to the people. 

I should like to read to you the words of the Savior, for we be- 
lieve that the gospel restored to us is none other than that set up by 
him when he ministered among men here upon the earth, and I believe 
that the same powers and the same gifts and the same blessings follow 
those who believe and those who minister in his name and by his power. 
After he had appeared unto his apostles he gave unto them a com- 
mandment, as follows: 

And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel 
to every creature. He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he 
that believeth not shall be damned. And these signs shall follow them 
that believe; in my name they shall cast out devils; they shall speak with 
new tongues; they shall take up serpents, and if they drink any deadly thing, 
it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall 
recover. 

We as a people stand up and bear this message and this testi- 
mony in the world. Your sons and your daughters, many of them, 
are today in the world crying repentance to the children of men, and 
they are fearless and are boldly declaring to the people that if they 
will believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, have faith in him, and repent of 
their sins, and be baptized, they will be saved. And just so fearlessly 
and firmly do they declare that if they will not do so, they will come 
under the condemnation of the Lord. I believe, my brethren and 
sisters, that there is no other system in the world, no other plan, no 
gospel given to man save that which we have that is "the power of God 



ELDER REY L. PRATT 



95 



unto salvation." And we declare to the people of the world that these 
signs spoken of here by the Savior shall follow the believer, and I am 
a witness to you today that these things are true. The people of the 
world among whom we labor believe that the signs followed the be- 
lievers in days of old. They believe in the miracles recorded in the 
Bible, in the New Testament ; but men are wont to tell us in this day 
that we are not living in a day when these powers are made manifest 
unto the children of men. They believe that the apostles of old had 
great powers, and ministered unto the restoring of people to health 
and strength; that the blind were made to see, the deaf to hear, the 
dumb to speak, and the lame to walk ; but when we tell them that these 
things are a part of the gospel to us, they are skeptical, and they do not 
believe, and they do not have faith sufficient to bring these things down 
upon their heads for their blessing. They believe that the Lord's hand 
has been shortened and his power has been lessened. But.I am glad 
to say that we can witness before them that these things do exist in 
the world today through the gospel, as it has been restored and as 
we enjoy it. There is an account here, in the third chapter of the Acts 
of the Apostles, of a remarkable healing, that I would like to read to 
you. This is accepted and believed by the people of the world, I think, 
because it happened so long ago : 

Now Peter and John went up together into the temple at the hour of 
prayer, being the ninth hour. And a certain man lame from his mother's 
womb was carried, whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple which 
is called Beautiful, to ask alms of them that entered into the temple; who 
seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple asked an alms. And 
Peter, fastening his eyes upon him with John, said, Look on us. And he 
gave heed unto them, expecting to receive something of them. Then Peter 
said, Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have give I 1 thee: in the 
name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk. And he took him by 
the right hand, and lifted him up; and immediately his feet and ankle bones 
received strength. And he leaping up stood, and walked, and entered with 
them into the temple, walking, and leaping, and praising God. And they 
knew that it was he which sat for alms at the Beautiful gate of the temple; 
and they were filled with wonder and amazement at that which had hap- 
pened unto him. And as the lame man which was healed held Peter and 
John, all the people ran together unto them in the porch that is called 
Solomon's, greatly wondering. And when Peter saw it, he answered unto 
the people, Ye men of Israel, why marvel ye at this? or why look ye so 
earnestly on us, as though by our own power or holiness we had made 
this man to walk. The God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, the 
God of our fathers, hath glorified his Son Jesus; whom ye delivered up and 
denied him in the presence of Pilate, when he was determined to let him 
go. 

As I say, the world believe that this man, although paralyzed, 
was restored so that he walked with the brethren who had restored 
him, by the power of God. Now, do we believe — that is the vital point 
. for us to consider that the same power that rested upon these men 
exists in the Church today? When our little ones are sick, when sick- 
ness comes into the homes, can we call upon the elders with the same 
faith as evidenced here, believing firmly that the prayer of faith will

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



heal the sick? Time will not permit me to speak long, but I want to 
bear you my witness, I have seen many manifestations of the healing 
power of the Lord. 

I recall an incident in far off Mexico, where a little girl came 
into the presence of the elders, having suffered from smallpox, and 
as a result of that dread disease, a white film had grown over one of 
her eyes, causing total blindness in it. The elders administered to her 
and they testify that when she left them, the afflicted eye was as clear 
as the other one. 

Last June I was visiting the elders in the city of Laredo, Texas. 
On Sunday night we held a meeting in a hall we had rented, there 
being about eighty in attendance, and as Elder Pierce, the presiding 
elder, was speaking, I noticed a little confusion at the door, and as I 
looked more closely, saw that it was two persons supporting a man who 
was paralyzed, and bringing him into the meeting. They placed him 
on a rear seat, and all listened attentively till the meeting was out. 
Soon after the meeting was over, all those who had attended dispersed, 
with the exception of the man referred to and those who had brought 
him. I approached them and asked them what it was they wished, 
and one of the men who had helped to bring in the sick man replied : 

We have heard the teachings of these young elders and the claims by 
them made that the signs shall follow the believers in the gospel which 
they teach, and we believe what these elders have told us, and that they 
are endowed with power to lay hands upon the sick and they shall recover. 
It is our wish that you should lay hands upon this paralyzed man and bless 
him. 

The case looked to be a very hopeless one to me, but I said to the 
elders, "Brethren, the Lord has said that these things can be done, so 
let us exercise all the faith we can." 

So we gathered around the man and blessed him, after which we 
put him in his wagon and sent him on his way home. 

The next night we held meeting in the same place with about the 
same sized crowd present. This night the sick man was again present, 
but came before the services started, and I spoke to him, asking him 
how he felt, to which he replied, "I feel much better." I am sure I 
could not see wherein he looked any better, but I have no doubt that 
even then the Spirit of the Lord was operating in him and that he did 
really feel better. After the meeting we again blessed him. 

The next day I left Laredo, visiting in other parts of the mission, 
and it was ten days before I returned home. On reaching home and 
looking over my mail, I found a letter from one of the elders in Laredo 
who had assisted in administering to the sick man. He asked, "Do 
you remember the paralyzed man ? We have found that he was stricken 
a year ago, and during that time he has not been able to stand alone 
or to walk, but today he is walking all over." 

Brethren and sisters, that did not happen 2,000 years ago, but 
it was only three months ago. Peter said to the people who marveled 
when they witnessed the wonderful healing of the paralyzed man at 
the temple gate that it was not by his power, nor that of his brethren 



ELDER REY L. PRATT

that it had been done, but that once again the God of Abraham, Isaac 
and Jacob had manifested his power through his Son, Jesus Christ. 
So it was in the case I have related. It was not by my power, nor by 
the power of my brethren, but by the power of the Holy Priesthood 
that the paralyzed man was made well. God had once again made 
manifest his power through the Holy Priesthood and through his Son, 
Jesus Christ, in the healing of that man. I testify that this is true. 
About a month ago I visited Laredo again and learned that the sick 
man, subsequent to his healing had been baptized a member of the 
Church. He was not so wholly cured that he was able to walk with- 
out a cane, but had been walking with the assistance of a cane. 

On my last visit he asked that we administer to him again and 
after we had done so, he said, "I feel that I can now walk without 
the assistance of this cane," and he left the hall walking straight to 
the door with no assistance, very much to the surprise of all those who 
saw him. 

I call your attention to these circumstances in order that our 
faith may be renewed, and that we may believe that the Lord is the 
same yesterday, today and forever, and that there is no change, no 
variation, in him, and that his power and blessings may be made mani- 
fest wherever the faith of the people is sufficient to call down these 
blessings upon their heads. I testify that the Holy Priesthood, by 
which these things are done, is upon the earth today, just as much as 
it ever was. 

I have a clipping here from the Cosmopolitan magazine for the 
month of August, dealing with this subject which seems to be troubling 
the minds of some people, and the writer of this article asks, Why is it 
that we do not find in the religious world today, a manifestation of 
the power of God in the healing of the sick and in the revealing of his 
mind and will to man? Why is it that Elijah, Moses and the prophets 
of old, were able to see beyond the veil and tell the people what they 
saw, and to do other wonderful and mighty things which modern min- 
isters say cannot be done? He asked the religious world some very 
perplexing questions which I think would do them good to contemplate 
seriously. Speaking of the example cited, he said: 

"While these examples may not be of gifts we should class as psychic, 
they are instances of power. If the Old Testament is to be taken seriously, 
man was once in control of universal law beyond the point at which he 
stands today. But as I have stated, what was once a law is still a law, and 
if things were ever done, they can be done gain. The question naturally 
arises here as to whether the Old Testament is to be taken seriously or 
not. If it is not, then its mass of evidence as to universal powers once in 
the possession of man is worthless. But my appeal in the present series of 
articles is to those who believe the Old Testament to be the inspired word 
of truth. If that is so, how are these declarations of power, love, and the 
sound mind to be treated? Are they to be flatly denied, or deprived of 
substance by being explained away, or taken as historic? Either man had 
these powers or he had not. If he had not, shut the Old Testament and 
banish it from the churches. But if he had, why not seek to recover them,? 
If Moses or loshua or Peter or Paul of two or three thousand years ago 
could see beyond the material veil, and tell us what they saw, why cannot 



98 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 

the Moses or Joshua or Peter or Paul of the twentieth century do the 
same? Has it not become a matter of life and death to the whole Christian 
system that it should demonstrate its possession of power and love and 
the sound mind by deeds rather than by declarations?" 

I ask, can not the power of God today work the same miracles 
that it could in the days of old? I maintain that it can, and truly it 
seems to me that it has become a matter of life and death to the whole 
Christian system to demonstrate that it is in possession of this power, 
and I maintain that if the religious systems of the world continue with- 
out incorporating into their systems this power, their whole system 
will crumble under them and come to naught. 

I maintain that the Peters and the Pauls and the Joshuas and the 
Moses of this dispensation, as represented in the leaders of this Church, 
are endowed with power to look beyond the veil and to reveal to the 
children of men the thing that the Lord would have them know, and 
also to work through faith the same mighty miracles that were wrought 
through the Priesthood by those who held it in times that are past. And 
I testify that the signs poken of by the Savior of the world, will fol- 
low those who truly believe, in this day, just as much as in the time 
when the Savior himself, was upon the earth. 

The Lord bless you. Amen. 

The choir sang an anthem.

ELDER HEBER C. IVERSON 

(President of the Northwestern States Mission) 

My beloved brethren and sisters, when I look into your honest, 
eager faces, I feel the sincere desire of your heart for the word of God 
and his message to you. I am overwhelmed with my own inability, 
weakness and dependence upon him!, and trust, most sincerely, that 
if such message shall be delivered to you through me, I may enjoy 
the spirit thereof to the honor and glory of his name. 

You, who were privileged to attend the opening session of our 
conference, I am sure, you can say with me that it was a glorious 
event, and the glory of it has continued up to the present moment. 
My soul was overwhelmed with gratitude to God for the blessings 
therein obtained, and has since that time been filled with unspeakable 
joy. When President Grant announced to the audience the key- 
note of the conference, that it should be the love of God, which in- 
cludes, necessarily, the love of fellow man, the spirit of truth and for- 
giveness, which is God-love ; and when, with power befitting a prophet 
of God, he delivered to us his message, my soul was thrilled, and in 
my heart I said: 

We thank thee, O God, for a prophet, 
To guide us in these latter days; 



ELDER HEBER C. IVERSON 



09 



We thank thee for sending the gospel 
To lighten our minds with its rays. 

My favorite theme, my favorite scriptures, have been quoted dur- 
ing this conference. To my heart there is no thought more sub- 
lime than the love of God as evidenced in the love of his Son and 
manifest in those who possess his Spirit. "For the fruit of the spirit," 
says Paul, is "love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, 
faith ;" and inspiring in others love for their fellow man, the spirit 
of peace, in their souls, the gift of faith and of longsuffering. They 
are inspired by God's Spirit. How definitely the Lord declared this 
important principle when to him there came the lawyer, asking : "Mas- 
ter, which is the great commandment in the law." Remember his 
words: "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, with 
all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first and great com- 
mandment, and the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neigh- 
bor as thyself. On these two commandments hang all the law and 
the prophets." Nay, upon the first, we might say without being pre- 
sumptuous, hang all the law and the prophets, because the second is 
contained therein ; for by the same Master these words were spoken : 
"If a man say, I love God, and hate his brother (mark the strong 
language employed), he is a liar; for he that loveth not his brother 
whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen?" 
Hypocrisy, the spirit of the Pharisee, was most contemptible in the 
estimation of the Master, and brought forth such strong condemna- 
tion in such forceful language as he was not wont to use. Again 
he said, "A new commandment I give unto you, that ye shall love 
one another ; and hereby shall all men know that ye are my disciples, 
because ye love one another." 

An invariable evidence of discipleship of Christ is love for our 
fellow men. And to me these commandments are just as important, 
just as absolute as the commandment, "Except a man be born of the 
water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of heaven." 
for into God's presence no man can go with hatred in his heart to- 
ward his fellow men; for, "inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of 
the least of my little ones, ye have done it unto me," with which we 
receive the illustration of the interpretation, no man loves his God 
more than he loves his fellow man; no man will serve his God more 
than he is willing to serve and bless his fellow men, for in this way 
only we evidence to him our love for him. 

Upon my soul there has been a serious thought, and I must refer 
to it only, it is closely related to the thought of love of mankind, I 
fear that modern tendencies are drifting from that principle. I 
fear that most sacred institution, the home, is suffering greatly at 
the hands of the people of the world. And to our own people, I make 
a plea here. Among the many wholesome slogans that have been 
given to us may I be presumptuous enough to add one other — "Back 
to the Home." You no doubt have observed the tendency to stray 



100 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



from the home, and it was emphasized in the experience of the recent 
past, when into the ranks of the nation's defense were called our sons 
and our brothers, and in the avenues of commercial activities were 
called our daughters and our sisters; there they received magnificent 
salaries with which they could secure to themselves not only a good 
living, but many of the luxuries their hearts desired. To return to 
the simple duties of home has been a difficult task for many of our 
dear girls, and yet the noblest task that ever was laid upon the chil- 
dren of God. The immortal Roosevelt said: "No work, I care not 
how important it may seem to be, whether in church or state, in 
science or philosophy, begins to compare with that done in the home, 
by the father and the mother, who are the first of sovereigns and 
the divinest of priests." 

What is home? The best definition I ever read is this: "The 
place where mother is," be it a mansion or a humble cottage, a tent 
upon the desert sands; where the mother and her little ones, immor- 
tal souls, dwell, that is home. Therein is kept the first commandment 
given of God to our father and to his wife, our mother, in the garden 
of Eden, and because of its importance it came first. "Neither can 
we without our children be made perfect, nor they without us," and I 
decry with all the power of my soul, the abominable practice that 
has gone abroad, that form of murder known as race suicide. I was 
astonished when a good woman who has charge of one of our young 
ladies' associations told me that some of our girls belonging to the 
best families, noble girls, have had their minds poisoned concerning 
this matter to the extent that they had come to look upon criminal 
operations as little less than having a tooth treated or drawn. 

I think perhaps I can do no better than to read an article, be- 
cause it has become a subject of very sincere consideration by thinking 
men of the world. This article is taken from a Denver paper, and 
to President Knight I am obligated for possession of it, on the ques- 
tion of marriage and divorce and kindred evils. I shall take time 
to read an article on "the modern tendencies" which are strongly at- 
tacked by another thinking man, for it is evident that lying at the 
foundation of these evils is the deadly sin against which the Prophet 
Joseph F. Smith sounded a warning voice just shortly before his 
death; in his statement that "the dominant evil of the age is un- 
chastity," it is evidenced in so many ways, the spirit of it, is every- 
where. To your attention I call this article : 

"With science giving the shrug of doubt as to the existence of 
God, with law courts grinding out divorces and nauseum, with pass- 
ing literature that finds it pays to portray characters reeking with 
moral shame and condoning the offense, with young and old gone mad 
over the lurid motion film, with the drama depraved in spite of heroic 
efforts of the many who patronize and love the clean play, with the 
daily press mirroring the crimes and sins of society, with feminine 
dress mocking at decency and modesty, with ever-decreasing respect 



ELDER HEBER C. IVERSON 101 

for authority and reverence for the flag of our country, where is 
the power, who has the wisdom, where is the salvation of the youth 
of our land? 

"When Luther repudiated the sacramental idea of marriage he 
struck a blow at the family and set to work forces which today are 
placing the home in serious jeopardy. 

"Marriage, divested of its religious character and reduced to the 
condition of a pure civil contract, voidable at will, has become the 
plaything of the passions, and if those bonds are severed, the family 
is broken asunder, children are born by later unions, to one or both 
of the parents, and the family is torn from its true relationships. 
O, what a mockery! What a travesty of what St. Paul called, 'A 
great sacrament in Christ and in the Church.' And yet the world in 
which we live not only condones the evil of those who are guilty 
of this mockery, but admits them freely in the charmed circle of 
society. It repels with high disdain the poor Mjagdalene whom the 
Savior himself pardoned, but it honors with special friendship the 
Herods and their consorts. It is high time for society to outlaw 
such sacriligious profaners and offenders to Christian decency. 

"The pagans of old cast their infants from the Tarpeian rock, 
immolated them before the idol of Molock, but they had not learned 
the refinement of crime to which their modern devotees are addicted 
— birth control. Thre are women who profess to be Christians who 
are forever going about poisoning the minds and hearts of every 
young bride they can reach with the venom of their hell-flamed 
tongues, advising them to forestall the laws of nature and nature's 
God by preventing the conception, and birth and the rearing of chil- 
dren. Oh, Herod, Herod! what a tyro you were. The modern hus- 
band and wife have put you to shame in the damning sin of the 
'slaughter of the innocents'. They tell us it is a crime to bring 
children into the world in poverty, but why be hypocrites? If pov- 
erty be the cause, how happens it that the evil flourishes most among 
the wealthy. Not long since there was' a gathering of fashionable 
women in this very city. Among them were six women who boasted 
of eighteen husbands. The eighteen husbands and six wives boasted 
of four children, two of whom were weak-minded." 

There is a condition against which we Latter-day Saints, who 
have taken upon us the name of Jesus Christ and made covenants 
with our God, must set our faces as flint. And, oh, that woman 
who denies herself the glory of motherhood, the crown of the celes- 
tial glory which none other shall transcend, truly knows not what she 
does. "A partnership with God is motherhood. What purity, what 
love, what self-control should belong to her who helps God fashion 
an immortal soul." Can you think of any glory that can come to 
one greater than to enter into an actual partnership with God our 
Father and the Father of our children, and to be in sacred nearness 
to him in the guidance of those immortal, precious souls ! 



102 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 

God help us to know our duty and to do it, I pray in the name 
of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER JOHN M. KNIGHT 

(President of the Western States Mission and of Ensign Stake) 

"Know ye not that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, 
his servants ye are whom ye list to obey, whether of sin unto death, 
or obedience unto righteousness." This scripture has borne itself 
upon my soul as I have listened to the instructions received from 
our presiding brethren. There are two great forces working in the 
world, the forces of evil and of righteousness, or the powers of sin 
and the powers of God. 

I have been very much impressed with the sessions of this con- 
ference, and I shall leave this place with my face towards the rising 
sun, and my heart against doing the things against which our leaders 
have spoken. I believe there is no thing that will destroy the faith 
of the Latter-day Saints so much as criticism of the Presidency of 
the Church, or the presiding authority of the Church, and in the stakes 
of Zion, over one of which I have the privilege and honor to preside, 
I have raised my voice against these damning practices ; and I believe 
that it will undermine the faith of the young people of Zion if they 
indulge in these things. 

Permit me to read to you from the Book of Mormon. Alma, 
that mighty prophet of the living God who declares repentance to the 
people of this great nation, a thousand years and more ago, found 
the same condition prevailing among the people of that day and time, 
and he raised his voice in protest against it. I realize that it is time 
when we should instil into the hearts of our young people the love 
of God, a love for their fellow men, a love for the gospel of the 
Master. And I believe, in order to do that, we should be exemplary 
in our lives, that we should have in our souls a testimony of the 
truth, and we should endeavor to surround the youth with the influ- 
ences of the gospel of the Master, and to hedge up the way that 
the power of the adversary shall not overcome them in their lives. 
Alma, you will remember, desired that he might have the voice of 
an angel to declare repentance unto the ends of the earth, and then 
he says : 

I ought not to harrow up in my desires, the firm, decree, of a just God, 
for I know that he granteth unto men according to their desire, whether 
it be unto death or unto life; yea I know that he allotteth unto men, ac- 
cording to their wills; whether they be unto salvation or unto destruction. 
Yea, and I know that good and evil have come before all men; or he 
that knoweth not good from evil is blameless; but he that knoweth good 
and evil, to him it is given according to his desires; whether he desireth 
good or evil, life or death, joy or remorse of conscience. Now seeing that 
I know these things, why should I desire more than to perform the work 
to which I have been called? Why should I desire that I was an angel, 
that I could speak unto all the ends of the earth? For behold, the Lord 



ELDER JOHN M. KNIGHT 



103 



doth grant unto all nations, of their own nation and tongue, to teach his 
word; yea, in wisdom, all that he seeth fit that they should have; there- 
fore we see that the Lord doth counsel in wisdom, according to that 
which is just and true. I know that which the Lord hath commanded me, 
and I glory in it; I do not glory of myself, but I glory in that w:hich 
the Lord hath commanded me; yea, and this is my glory, that perhaps I 
may be an instrument in the hands of God, to bring some soul to re- 
pentance; and this is my joy. 

I care not, my brethren and sisters, how much opposition comes 
from without. We meet opposition in the Western States. There 
are men and women who, in the language that has been quoted by 
Elder Iverson, used by the reverend gentleman in a discourse in 
Denver, "with their hell-flamed tongues are poisoning the minds of 
the people" against this thing that is known as "M'prmonism;" but all 
the powers of darkness and of earth and hell combined cannot stay 
the onward progress of the work of God. He has set his hand the 
last time to accomplish his purposes in the earth, to establish the 
truth, and to bring to pass his righteousness, and there is no power 
that can stay its progress. It is destined to go on until it fulfills its 
destiny in the earth. But there is danger when there is internal 
strife, when there is bitterness in the hearts of the sons of God, 
that they will destroy our faith, and undermine our lives, and thus 
we will be servants to sin; and I raise my voice in protest against 
these practices. 

I rejoice, my brethren and sisters, in the testimony of the gospel 
and in the privilege that I have of lifting my voice in its defense. 
There is no joy that comes to the soul equal to that joy that comes 
in declaring the message of salvation. I want to say to you that 
men and women by the thousands are willing to listen to our message, 
and I care little for these fellows who oppose us. I want to testify 
to you that it is a splendid thing that opposition comes into the lives 
of the missionaries; it puts them on edge, it makes them determined 
and very anxious to bear witness of the truth that has been restored 
in this day and age of the world. 

Now, may we, my brethren and sisters, go from these gatherings 
and carry with us the inspiration and the spirit of them, and let us 
carry it to our various wards and stakes and missions, that the work 
of God may go on unhindered, and that our brethren and sisters who 
hold positions of responsibility may receive the sustaining power of 
the Priesthood of the Son of God, that they may carry on the great 
latter-day work entrusted to their care, I humbly pray, in Jesus' name. 
Amen. 



ELDER GEO. F. RICHARDS 

It was said by our Savior while he ministered among men, that 
he spoke as one having authority; and the scriptures tell us that if a 
man speak, "Let him speak as the oracles of God."

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



ENDORSEMENT OF THE PREVIOUS SPEAKERS 

You, my brethren and sisters, having accepted the principles of 
the gospel and the ordinances thereof, and having tried as well as you 
could to keep the commandments of God, in the midst of weakness, 
you know as well as those who have testified, this afternoon, in your 
presence, that this is, indeed, the gospel of Jesus Christ, and that it 
is indeed the power of God unto. salvation. I rejoice exceedingly, and 
join my brethren in adding my testimony to this great truth, and also 
endorsing that which has been said by those who have preceded me. 

THE PURPOSE OF INSTRUCTION 

I take it, my brethren and sisters, that in embracing the gospel 
and coming along thus far in your life's work, you are resolved 
and determined to be true and faithful unto the end, remembering 
that the race is not to the swift, neither the battle to the strong, but 
to those who endure faithful to the end. The instructions which are 
given are calculated to bring us to a remembrance of the covenants 
which we have made, of the undertakings which we have entered into, 
of the aim and objects we have had when, in our thoughtful moments, 
we have considered the purpose of our existence here, where we came 
from, and where we are going to ; and to remind us of our weaknesses 
and imperfections, and of the straight and narrow way in which we 
must travel continuously if we shall reach the goal and aim of our 
lives. 

I hope, dear brethren and sisters, that we will not be deceivers of 
ourselves, but hearing these things and locking them up in our lives. 
This is not what is intended, but rather that we shall consider these 
admonitions, cherish them in our minds, weigh them, and apply them 
to ourselves, that we may profit by them. For, if after we have been in- 
structed so thoroughly and plainly, in regard to our duties, we still con- 
tinue to neglect them, we will not be without condemnation in the day 
of judgment. This gospel is a "savor of life unto life, or of death 
unto death" unto those to whom it comes. The hearing of the word 
is just as much our condemnation, if we neglect to accept and live by 
it, as it is our salvation if we accept and live by the word of the Lord. 

IN COMMENDATION OF THE SAINTS 

I commend you, my brethren and sisters, for your integrity, faith- 
fulness, and many sacrifices which you are making for the gospel's 
sake. I know that this is pleasing to our Father in heaven. I know 
that you know that when you have done that which is right, and tried 
to live the law in the accomplishment of the Lord's purposes, you 
know he is pleased with you, and that his Spirit is upon you. You 
are happy in the work. I know, too, and you know, that if we love 
the brethren, it is a good index to our love of God, and if we love our 
Father and his Son Jesus Christ, we will keep the commandments ; 



ELDER GEO. F. RICHARDS 



105 



and if we do that we will obtain eternal life. That is what our 
heavenly Father has designed that we should do. That is what he has 
designed that we should attain to ; eternal life in his presence. And 
rnlay God help us to this end, and may none of us be failures, but may 
the success we will attain be to the advantage and glory of our lives 
in the world to come, I earnestly pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 

The choir and congregation sang the anthem, "Inflammatus/'.solo 
by Ada McDonald. 

Benediction was pronounced by Elder Joseph S. Lindsay of the 
Cottonwood stake of Zion. 



SECOND OVERFLOW MEETING. 

A second overflow meeting was held in the assembly hall of the 
Bureau of Information at 10 o'clock Sunday morning, October 10. 

Elder David A Smith, of the Presiding Bishopric, presided, and 
called the congregation to order. The music was furnished by the 
congregation under the leadership of President Winslow Farr Smith 
of the Northern States Mission. 

The congregation sang, "High on the mountain top." 

Prayer was offered by Elder Wallace S. Trowbridge. 

Congregation sang, "Israel, Israel, God is calling." 



ELDER SAMUEL O. BENNION 

(President of the Central States Mission) 

I am reminded very much this morning in our assembly here, of 
conferences that we frequently hold in the mission field. We usually 
have just such a place as this in many of the great cities of the country, 
and just about a gathering of this kind — though sometimes smaller; 
so I feel quite at home here. I have felt the Spirit of the Lord here. 
I felt it when our young elder prayed in opening the meeting; and I am: 
reminded of the words of the Savior, that where there are a few gath- 
ered together in his name, there he would be also. This is the Lord's 
work, it is not man's work. Our Father in heaven is at the helm, and he 
governs and controls, according to the conditions of men. It is true 
that he can do much better with men and women who are faithful, 
and true than he can with men and women who are not, but he guides 
and controls. This life of ours has much to do with our future life 
and with the destiny of the human family. 

When the Lord appeared unto the prophet Joseph Smith, he told 
him that the creeds of men were an abomination in his sight. Now I 



106 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



am reminded of a word that Brother Talmage gave us by way of in- 
struction yesterday, that it is not recorded that God hated man. I 
was glad to hear him say that, for we are God's children, no matter 
whether we belong to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 
or to any of the different denominations of the earth, or to none at 
all — we are the children of our Father in heaven, he is the Father of 
our spirits. And I am certain that he loves his children — not that he 
condones their iniquity, any more than a father or a mother here in 
the flesh condones the wrong-doing of the child that God has given 
them, but he loves his children. So, when he told Joseph the prophet, 
in answer to his prayer, that the creeds of men were an abomination 
in his sight, he had in mind the things that his children were doing 
and teaching. 

There were thousands of ministers, men who professed to have the 
authority of the Lord Jesus Christ, who had never considered, per- 
haps, what that authority really was, or what it meant to obtain it; 
and as a result, they were teaching doctrines that were erroneous. It 
had been a doctrine of the teachers of religion for centuries that God, 
our eternal Father, was without body, parts, or passions, that he filled 
the immensity of space, that he was everywhere present, and yet could 
dwell in the heart of the smallest child. They had never considered, 
as someone has said before, that anything without parts could never 
be a whole. And yet men who professed to act in the name of God 
and to teach men and women to worship God were teaching that doc- 
trine concerning our Father in heaven. This was an abomination in his 
sight, because it was untrue, and was leading men and women away 
from him as fast as they would listen to it. Those professors were un- 
doubtedly corrupt ; they drew near unto him with their lips while their 
hearts were far from him; for we cannot help but conclude that those 
who were without a guide would surely as the world go into trans- 
gression. A man that will teach an erroneous doctrine, and a man 
that will teach a doctrine merely for a livelihood must fail to be re- 
ceptive to the impressions which God Almighty has declared should 
come unto man, and must fall into error. There were thousands of 
people also who were preaching that God no longer spoke from the 
heavens above, that he no longer revealed himself. This is at once 
discovered to be an untrue principle, for it would be robbing God, our 
eternal Father, of his attributes of love and mercy and justice; for 
he whose love is greater than the love of any human being, so much 
so that there can be no comparison, could not forsake his children of the 
last generation of time when he in former generations walked" and 
talked with men and discussed life and life eternal, until they knew 
him by the thousands. Do you think that a mother — whose love 
is greater than any other love on the earth, could in the last portion 
of her life, so to speak, forsake the children that came to her the last, 
in preference to those that came to her in the beginning of her life, 
the elder children, whom she had been careful to teach, as Christ and 



ELDER SAMUEL 0. BENNION 



107 



our Father in heaven were careful to teach the children of men, ac- 
cording to the revelations we find in Holy Writ? If a mother failed 
to teach the children of her later years, would she be a real mother to 
them, as she had been to those who had come to her in the former 
portion of her married life? It is unreasonable to believe a mother 
would do it — in fact her love would increase, rather than decrease. 
And so it is with our Father in heaven ; for a man to say that he no 
longer speaks to men and that he has given unto the children of men 
all that is necessary, would be, as I stated before, to attempt to de- 
prive him of his rights, which no man can do. God has never said that 
he would not reveal himself, but he has stated that he would reveal 
himself unto his servants the prophets. But when men failed to kneel 
down and make an honest appeal unto him, there was nothing sincere 
about them, the mark of sincerity could not be found in their lives, and 
so he found they were unreliable, and as a result, the work of God was 
not found among the children of men. 

When the prophet Joseph appealed to him, he came to him and 
spoke to him, as one man speaks to another ; and Joseph saw and bears 
record, that he had' a body of flesh and bones, and that he was able 
to speak; he saw that the children of men were formed after him, 
that he was our Father in very deed. 

Through that revelation the prophet gives unto the children of 
m|en this fact, that God is a man, a man who was once mortal, who 
had become immortal as a result of his achievements, as a result of' 
the life that he had led in some former world; that we are his chil- 
dren, fashioned after him, and that the Holy Scriptures are true, 
and that men who profess to teach a doctrine contrary to this were 
teaching a thing that was abominable in the sight of God. Yet God did 
not hate those people, but he hated the things which they did, as he 
does today. There is not any doubt in my mind but that the Lord is 
very much displeased with the children of men, and especially the 
children of this Church, who have received the message from him, a 
testimony of Jesus, when he finds them doing things that are abso- 
lutely wrong. 

He gave unto the prophet Joseph Smith the testimony that he gave 
unto Peter, the testimony of the Holy Ghost, which says unto every 
man who has it, "I know that my Redeemer lives, that Jesus is the 
Christ, and that this is his work here upon the earth." Paul says that 
no man can say Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost, which comes 
as a result of obedience to law. Men were not obeying the gospel, 
they were not obeying the principles taught by the Christ and his apos- 
tles, they had drifted entirely away from it, and were teaching doc- 
trines that were untrue and leading the whole world astray, until 
there were none who were walking in the path which God had decreed 
the children of men should walk in in order to return to him. You will 
recall the incident in the life of the apostle Peter at the time when 
the Christ was about to be crucified. Peter had said to the Christ 



108 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



that he would follow him unto death, and the Savior turned unto him 
and said, "Before the cock crows, Peter, thou shalt deny me thrice." 
Why ? Because Peter did not at that time have the Holy Ghost. Christ 
had blessed those apostles, he had breathed the Holy Ghost upon them, 
but he said, "If I do not go, the Spirit, or the Comforter, will not 
come." And he told them that they were to go to Jerusalem, and they 
were to remain there until they should be endued with power from on 
high, and then they would receive the witness that he was the Christ. 
There was no need for it while the Christ was there. The miracles 
that he performed were absolutely genuine, and would prove to any 
man that desired to know, that he had the truth. So Peter had him 
as a witness as long as he was there, but when he was separated from 
him on that night before the crucifixion and was accused of being 
one who was associated with him, he denied him; when one of those 
maidens accused him of being one of those associated with Jesus, he 
said, "No, I am not," and even denied him three times ; the scripture 
says that he cursed, or swore; and then the cock crowed, and Peter 
wept bitterly. But upon the day of Pentecost, when the apostles were 
assembled at Jerusalem, as recorded in the second chapter of the Acts 
of the Apostles, we find that those apostles upon that occasion felt the 
power of the Holy Ghost. It came upon' them in such power that peo- 
ple heard it as it came — according to the description — like a mighty 
rushing of the wind; and those men, filled with power, spoke, and 
the people, gathered together from among all nations, heard, each one 
in his own language. They became pricked in their hearts, and they 
cried out, "Men and brethren, what shall we do?" Then came the 
Apostle Peter, that man who God had decreed should be at the head 
of his Church, to bind on earth and to bind in heaven, and to loose 
on earth and to loose in heaven, whichever he decreed, according to his 
judgment — which judgment would be, of course, inspired by that power 
which God gave unto him as a witness — and he stood there in the 
majesty of his power and said, "Repent, and be baptized every one of 
you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall 
receive the gift of the Holy Ghost." — They had not received it, they 
had partaken of the influence of it. It was there as a witness unto 
them, a special occasion; but Peter -declared unto them if they would 
repent, that they would receive the manifestation of it through the 
gifts as promised in Holy Writ. And so we are told that there were 
three thousand added to the Church at that time. 

Now, coming back to this generation of time ; Joseph Smith, the 
Mormon prophet, suffered persecution, yet he bore record that he 
saw the Father and the Son ; both before and after he had received 
baptism, and the witness of the Holy Ghost, that member of the God- 
head, which was placed in the Godhead to be a witness unto you and 
to me and unto all men that God lives, and that Jesus is the Christ — 
he declared that he had both seen and heard the voice of the risen 
Redeemer, that he had heard the voice of his Father in heaven, and 



ELDER SAMUEL 0. BEN N ION 



109 



he bore witness of it unto his death, he failed not at any time to be 
the man that God had decreed he should be as a result of his former 
obedience. The world did not have the light, because they had not 
walked in the path by which men obtain that light. They had at- 
tempted to climb up in some other way. Mien could purchase positions 
in the churches by their money and obtain pews just where they de- 
sired them, and if they did not go, their sins could be forgiven anyway 
— which thing was an abomination in the sight of God, our eternal 
Father. 

Joseph Smith brought again the gospel of Christ, so that there 
have been here gathered together within the vales of these mountains, 
a people who do know the Lord; and even if they have not lived as 
perfectly as they might have done, and are not doing as perfectly as 
they might do, the testimony of Jesus is in their hearts. When they 
go among the children of mien, they have that power renewed from 
on high, so to speak, and they speak with power and as one having 
authority, and they are not afraid. They go into the countries of this 
earth and bear testimony that God lives, and no man can say that he 
does live or that Jesus is the Christ without this great witness, which 
God has decreed should be the heritage of all men and women who 
desire to have it in their possession by obedience to his laws. 

So here has been introduced in the dispensation of time in which 
we live, a true order of worship, a worship which is not an abomina- 
tion in the sight of God, but a worship which pleases God, our eternal 
Father. And there never need be any fear of successful contradiction. 
The things that Joseph Smith brought into the world by way of prin- 
ciples of intelligence have never been proved to be untrue. Men may 
say that he was not a prophet of God, but I want to tell you this, 
that when men say he was not a prophet of God, the burden of proof 
is always upon the man who doubts and the man who contends, and 
not on the man who bears a testimony. Joseph Smith brought into 
the world the gospel of Christ, which binds men and women in the 
earth and in the heavens above forever, and no man has ever been able 
to prove it to be untrue. The Book of Mormon itself stands as a 
monument always before men — that the prophet Joseph saw heavenly 
beings in the dispensation of time in which we live, men who had 
died and passed away. They still live, they do not lose their identity, 
but they are individually real, and possess their faculties. He bears 
testimony of it, and that book itself, is a revelation to the children of 
men, and proof that he has spoken the truth. 

A man who professed to be a Presbyterian minister approached me 
not long ago, after one of our street meetings, in one of the Eastern 
States, and said, "I do not believe the Book of Mormon." 

I said, "Have you ever read it?" 

He said, "No." 

"I did not think you had," I said. "I told you that in order to 
believe the Book of Mormon, men must be humble, and prayerful, 



110 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



they must be honest and earnest, and must read it for the purpose of 
finding out whether it be true or whether it be false. You told the 
truth when you said you did not believe it, for I tell you that it takes 
work, and it takes faith, and it takes devotion to believe the Book 
of Mormon and to learn it, and it comes as a result of a declaration and 
a determination in the heart of man to know whether it is true or 
whether it is not. There is no gold-brick swindle in the 'Mormon' 
Church ; it is real. You can sort the principles, any one of them, and 
take them into your church and discuss them, and I tell you every- 
thing that you preach which comes through Joseph Smith the prophet 
will be an enlightenment to the minds of every man and woman who 
listens to you. Go ahead and do it, and I tell you you will be preach- 
ing the word of God, and Presbyterianism and all other 'isms' will dis- 
appear" 

I said further to him, "Personaly I have never desired to attack 
a man for his religious belief. I do not believe in it. I do not believe 
in debates. I never saw any good come from them. I never saw any 
good coming from one man and another getting into a quarrel, a 
physical quarrel. They nev.er were peaceful friends afterwards, never 
had confidence in each other. Men and women are not converted 
through conquest of that sort, they are only converted through in- 
telligent research and discovery; and when men and women do make 
an actual discovery, it is written in their hearts because they are the 
children of God and in their hearts dwells the Spirit which emanates 
from God, our eternal Father, who fashioned it in the world from 
which we came. And so I say to you, we make no attacks, we would 
like you to read the scripture, as we do. You do not believe Joseph 
Smith was a prophet, but if there is anything in the scripture which 
goes to prove that he was a prophet you ought to learn it. You are a 
child of God. There will come a time when you will have to stand be- 
for the judgment bar of God to give an account of the deeds done in 
the flesh, and I feel that I would be held accountable, inasmuch as I 
have come in personal contact with you, if I did not bear my testimony 
to you and give you something to think about and give you something 
to read and say unto you, in a friendly way, not in an antagonistic 
way, that you are in error." 

After I had discussed the gospel with him for half an hour he 
shook hands with me, and said, "I am glad to have had the interview." 

I want to tell you, my brethren and sisters, that the time will 
come when this thing called prejudice will be swerved to one side or the 
other, and men who are honest and yet who are living an abomination 
in doctrine and practice before God will accept the truth. — A man who 
is in adultery cannot accept the truth, a man who lies and a man 
who bears false witness, and a man who is not true to himself, will 
not accept the gospel of Christ, and he will not be in tune and in har- 
mony with the Spirit of the Lord. It will be absolutely necessary for 
him to repent. God does not love him in his iniquity — his heart yearns 



ELDER SAMUEL 0. BENNION 111 



for him, as the mother's heart yearns for her child; he, with greater 
power — so much greater than the human mind is capable of under- 
standing — yearns with a yearning that we are not capable at all of 
appreciating, for the return of one of his sons or daughters, no matter 
where they may be in the earth. 

Men were led by the power of the Adversary, through false preach- 
ing for centuries, when no man upon the earth had the power of the 
Holy Ghost as a witness in him. They were led' astray for centuries 
into believing that God had done it all, that he himself had fought 
the fight and there was nothing for the children of men to do but bow 
their heads and worship him and so be saved; it was an easy way to 
salvation, and thousands and millions of people accepted it. But 
when the true order of worship came, and it was taught that work, 
and faith, and intelligent devotion are necessary, there were only a few 
who found themselves willing and ready to accept the doctrine which 
God, our Father, had declared should be the way by which men should 
follow in order to return unto him. 

I say unto you, my brethren and sisters, this gospel of the King- 
dom of God will purify men and women, it will cause them to repent, 
and when they repent they are not an abomination, nor will their 
creeds be, in his sight, for everyone will know the truth, everyone will 
be a brother in very deed. The name of the prophet Joseph Smith will 
be revered and written into the hearts of the thousands of men who 
forsake sin. 

But, as was stated yesterday, and as has been written, "God cannot 
look upon sin with the least degree of allowance, and none need 
try to reach God — whether they be in the Church or out — when they 
have in their hearts the spirit of hate, the spirit of iniquity, the spirit 
of falsity, for those are the creeds which God hates, and which men 
and women must be relieved of before they can feel that sweet, beauti- 
ful influence which emanates from our Father in heaven. May God 
give you and me the grace and the power to live as we ought to live, 
I pray in Christ's name. Amen. 

ELDER CHARLES A. CALLIS 

(President of the Southern States Mission) 

"Where no counsel is, the people fall: but in the multitude of 
counselors there is safety." 

This scripture came to my mind and remained with me during 
Friday and Saturday as I listened to the voices of the inspired ser- 
vants of God ; and especially was it impressed upon my heart during 
the delivery of that splendid discourse by President Heber J. Grant. 

What a beautiful thing it is to forgive and to forget. A poet has 
said: "To err is human: to forgive is divine." 

Israel is blessed with wise counselors and happy is the man and 



112 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



the woman who walks in the path of counsel. The faults we have, the 
Lord seeks to remove, because thereby our progress in his kingdom 
is made more rapid. These faults act as a brake on our endeavors 
and make us fall short of the full measure of success which God has 
promised to his faithful children. 

Unto Joshua, that mighty warrior of old, came God's command 
to take a certain city. The soldiers were sent against the enemy, but 
they returned in the confusion of retreat. Upon the ground, upon his 
face, Joshua prostrated himself and asked God why "Israel turneth 
their backs before their enemy." The Lord said : "There is an accursed 
thing in the midst of thee, O Israel : thou canst not stand before 
thine enemies, until ye take away the accursed thing from among you." 

The accursed thing was found in the tent of one of Joshua's sol- 
diers. God had commanded those men that when the city of Jericho 
was taken they were to keep themselves away from the accursed thing 
in the city. One of the soldiers disobeyed. He took a garment upon 
which the curse rested. He also took some of the silver and gold 
which belonged to the Lord, to be used in the holy sanctuary and 
hid them in his tent. The man was dealt with according to divine in- 
junction, and then the command was repeated: "Go up to Ai." 
Joshua did so. The city fell into his hands, because the accursed 
thing had been removed from Israel. 

And when we violate a command of the Lord, when we take 
anything that is forbidden or keep anything that belongs to our Fath- 
er, it is an accursed thing: it is a brake on our endeavors, and to get 
rid of this thing is our first duty, so that we may go on in the path 
toward eternal perfection. 

Someone has said, "Blessed is the man who has found his work." 
Then thrice blessed are the people of God, for unto them hath been 
given a great work. The mission of this Church is to preach the 
gospel unto every nation and kindred and tongue and people. So 
long as a man will work there is hope for him, but when he sinks 
in despair and refuses to exert himself, then it is hard to save him. 
One of the shining and great evidences that we are the people of God 
is that in our hearts and in our lives is the spirit of service. Look at 
the magnificent work the Latter-day Saints are doing in the world. 
At great sacrifice, which is sacred- unto the Lord, they are sending 
their sons and their daughters to preach the gospel. The Book of 
Mormon is being distributed by the tens of thousands. The word of 
the Lord is being delivered to the world, to the children of our 
heavenly Father ; and the testimonies of the elders, the discourses they 
deliver, the books, the tracts that they distribute, the sermons that we ■ 
have heard during this conference, the testimonies of the servants of 
God upon the isles of the sea, in the north and the south, the east and 
the west — all these combine as the loud voice, saying: "Fear God, 
and give glory to him, for the hour of his judgment is come." That 
is the mission we are engaged in, and the Lord will bless his people 
for the sacrifice they are making. 



ELDER CHARLES A. CALLIS 



113 



We are a great people. Why? . Is it because we are great in 
ourselves? No. We recognize that the authority which we profess 
to hold- — and which we do hold, I testify unto you — is powerless un- 
less the spirit of service accompanies it. Is not authority, without 
service, without work, powerless as faith without works? The spirit 
of service is in our hearts, and this is what is making the people 
great. It has been said that it is not what we take in this life, but 
what we give up that makes us rich. And the Latter-day Saints have 
given, because, in the words of the Savior, it is more blessed to give 
than to receive; and the great work which the Father has definitely 
commissioned us to perform is making this people great, through the 
law of service and of sacrifice, which is the soul of the work in which 
we are engaged. 

If you will permit me, I want to substitute two words in a verse 
which was written to eulogize the world-famed Yale college. I want 
to substitute for "old Yale," the words "the Church," and then see if 
this does not apply to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 

"Miother of men, grown strong in giving, 

Honor to him thy lights have led, 

Rich in the toil of thousands living, 

Proud of the deeds of thousands dead, 

We, who have felt thy power and known thee, 

We, in whose lives thy lights avail, 

High in our hearts enshrined, enthrone thee, 

Mother of men, The Church." 

When the Prophet Joseph Smith was going to his martyrdom, he 
made a declaration, filled with love and charity, that will go ring- 
ing down the ages as one of the noblest truths that ever crossed mortal 
lips. He said, "If my life is of no value to my friends, it is of none 
to myself." That truth is the soul of the work of the Lord. It is 
the truth that is in the heart of President -Grant and all the leaders of 
this Church. It is the truth in the heart of every president that has 
presided over the Church of the Lord Jesus Christ. 

Now, brethren and sisters, we are not going about this work 
blindly. Our vision is clear. The prophet has said, "Where there is 
no vision, the people perish." But we are blessed with the vision of 
the Holy Ghost, that guides us into all truth. 

On the way to Atlanta from Chattanooga a few weeks ago, I was 
in conversation with a Baptist minister, a very fine gentleman. He in- 
vited me to answer his questions concerning the doctrines of the 
Church, which I did to the best cl my ability, and with a prayer in my 
heart that the Lord would help me. I said to him, "Do not these 
great events, this world war, this pestilence, portend some great event 
such as the second coming of the Son of God?" 

"Well," said he, "I think so now, but I did not used to think so ; 
and if any man seven years ago had predicted this world war would 



114 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



fall upon the world in its destructive fury and awful bloodshed, we 
would have laughed him to scorn, and then crucified him." 

I said, "The world did kill him, for the Prophet Joseph Smith did 
predict this world war. He was laughed to scorn, and the world 
killed him ; and he went to his doom a martyr for the testimony of 
Jesus Christ." 

Brethren and sisters, thank God for this vision, that we may see 
our duty clearly and thank God for our prophet, seer, and revelator, 
who by the mercy and the goodness of God, guides his people, and un- 
to whose counsel we will rally — because I know and I bear my testi- 
mony that the sons and the daughters of this people love the Church — 
and will come to her help in the divine mission which God hath com- 
missioned her to perform. 

I bear my testimony that we are led by prophets and apostles, wise 
counselors ; and if we will give heed — which we will do, with the 
help of the Lord — to their teachings and counsels, we shall reap 
eternal life, which is the greatest gift that God can give to man. 

The Lord help us to keep firm and faithful unto death, is my 
earnest prayer in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

i 

ELDER WINSLOW FARR SMITH 

(President of the Northern States Mission) 

I endorse from the bottom of my heart the words of the previous 
speakers, for I am engaged, as they are, in the mighty work of preach- 
ing the gospel of Jesus Christ. And we are not alone in this mighty 
ministry; there are 1,700 of us sent out from the stakes of Zion to 
bear the message of the restored gospel. There is joy in this work, 
for, as President Callis has said, It is the service that we give that 
brings us happiness. 

The missionary work of the Church is progressing. The mes- 
sage that Christ was in very deed the Redeemer of the world, that he 
gave us a plan of salvation that will save the souls of men, that the 
gospel, after the ages of darkness, was restored and given to the chil- 
dren of men through the Prophet Joseph — this message is what we 
are bearing to the world. We go where we are sent. We go gladly. 
We give our time, we give of our talents, we give the best that is in 
us, for we know that God's work is paramount, here on the earth, and 
that ultimately the gospel of our Lord will triumph. 

It is true that 

High on the mountain top 

A banner is unfurled; 

Ye nations, now look up; 

It waves to all the world; 

In Deseret's sweet, peaceful land; 

On Zion's Mount behold it stand. 

We have gathered this week by the thouands, from the north 
and the south and the east and the west, many of us from distant

parts, to hear the advice and counsel of our leaders ; and to sustain 
them in their high and holy callings. I trust, and I really believe, that 
all of us who attend these meetings and listen to the words of our 
leaders, go back to our homes more determined to keep the com- 
mandments of God than when we came here. 

It is a wonderful thing, this gospel of our Lord. It is not to 
be absorbed by merely sitting idly by and wondering how we are 
going to be saved. All of us have an idea of some kind, of salva- 
tion. Rarely do you meet a man who does not have some belief in im- 
mortality ; but when you propound to him the question, "What is 
the immortality in which you believe? what is the salvation for which 
you hope?" in most instances you will find that he cannot give you 
an intelligent answer. To the Latter-day Saint, however, who is liv- 
ing his religion, and who is progressing 1 in a knowledge of his relig- 
ion, through prayer, faith, and diligent study, there is a pointed, plain, 
beautiful conception of immortality and eternal life, that gives his 
life something new, gives him hope, gives him courage, and gives 
him an understanding that his life here on earth is more than merely 
gaining the things of this life. 

The Savior said, "This is life eternal, that they might know thee, 
the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent." And 
truly the Savior spoke the truth when he made this wonderful state- 
ment. It is life eternal to understand the plan of salvation and to 
order our lives so that we are in accord with its teachings. It is 
life eternal to find such joy in our lives here, by righteous living, 
that when the end shall come, we will pass away in peace, not 
fearing death, but knowing that we have fought a good fight here, 
and that for having fought this good fight, the reward that awaits us 
will truly be ours. 

Again, the Savior said, "Search the scriptures, for in them ye 
have eternal life." My brethren and sisters, we, the Latter-day Saints, 
are blessed above all peoples of the earth in regard to the scriptures 
that we have to search. We have the holy Bible, that grand old book 
that has come down through the ages to us. We worship God and 
we read of him and we search that scripture and we order our lives 
in a large degree by its teachings — to us the holy Bible is most sac- 
red — but we have more, we have the Book of Mormon, the parallel 
history, if I may say it, of the inhabitants of this continent. Then 
we have still more, we have the history or the recorded word of our 
heavenly Father as it has been given to his children in this day and 
age; and still more, we have that record, the Pearl of Great Price." 
These four books we accept as the standard works of the Church, 
as the divine revelations of our Father, as his law unto his Church. 

But, my brethren and sisters, in accepting them and declaring 
to the world that we believe them, do we know them? Do we search 
them, do we even read them? Do we study them that we may know 
the plan of salvation and that we may build up our most holy faith 
and our determination, by prayerful, consistent research? I fear that

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



far too many of us take this matter of life and this matter of our 
duty to ourselves in the truth, far too lightly. I fear that far too 
many of us leave our books dusty on the shelves, rather than taking 
them down and reading the wonderful words that they contain. We 
can turn chapter by chapter through the Book of Mormon, and every 
chapter that we read opens our minds to something new ; we car» 
study it phrase by phrase, and our minds will brighten, if we will only 
do it. How many here today have read the Book of Mormon through ? 
How many have read the other scriptures ? Ask yourselves these ques- 
tions. 

We are too prone, my brethren and sisters, to take life easy, ti> 
order our lives along the lines of least resistance. We are too prone 
to read the light, foamy, entertaing things of life, that do not benefit 
us, and to leave unread the vital works that make us mighty and 
strong and intelligent for our life's work. We have these four books, 
the holy scripture, which we should search. We have other works, and 
we can read and study and none of us will ever master one tithe of the 
wonderful truths embraced in these books. 

I want to read to you just one verse from the Book of Mormon. 
It is a beautiful verse, and has been published many, many times. I 
fear that most of us are not yet familiar with it. It is the 13th verse of 
the second chapter of Second Nephi : 

And if ye shall say there is no law, ye shall also say there is no sin. 
If ye shall say there is no sin, ye shall also say there is no righteousness. 
And if there be no righteousness, there be no happiness. And if there 
be no righteousness nor happiness, there be no punishment nor misery. 
And if these things are not, there is no God. And if there is no God, we 
are not, neither the earth; for there could have been no creation of things, 
neither to act nor to be acted upon; wherefore, all things must have van- 
ished away. 

In this marvelously philosophical verse that we have in that 
chapter, there is so much truth to be pondered over and thought about, 
that if we will take it, read it, study it, analyze it, and pray over it, 
our minds will be opened and we will have an understanding of the 
things of God as we never had them before. 

As I said a moment ago, we are too prone to follow the lines of 
the least resistance, and not to strive to search the scriptures and to 
find out the things of God. The things of God are more than faith, 
repentance, and baptism,, these first principles ; the things of God em- 
brace all truths, and if we search the scripture and master these basic 
truths of our Father, and then go outside and take the works of 
commentary of the great thinkers, we can day by day grow in an un- 
derstanding of God and really know him. 

"This is life eternal, that they might know thee, the only true 
God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent;" and, my brethren and 
sisters, we cannot hope to know the only true God nor Jesus Christ, 
if we do not seek them. True, it is within the power of our heavenly 
Father to bless us with positive knowledge, with no effort on our 
own part. It is within his power to magnify us so mightily that we 



ELDER WIN SLOW FARR SMITH 



117 



could stand up as shining lights so that the world would marvel at 
our wonderful achievements. But God moves along natural lines ; 
he gives us the intelligence, he gives us the faith, he gives us the 
wisdom, and if we will utilize these God-given faculties and will exer- 
cise them and will study and will seek, then we will know. Fre- 
quently do the missionaries come to us in the field with not even an 
idea of God. They have gone on a mission purely because they have 
been sent. How much finer, how much more capable would they 
have been if their parents had trained them in the home, and they had 
been trained in the schools and in the organizations of the Church, 
so that they had gone into the mission field positively knowing that 
the gospel of Christ is true; with no doubt in their minds. While 
they would not necessarily be wonderful preachers ; and while, prob- 
ably, they could not explain the gospel in detail, yet there would 
be something burning in their souls that tells them that the gospel is 
true, that Jesus was the Christ, and that Joseph Smith is indeed a 
prophet of the living God. This is life eternal to know these things, 
and in order to know them, we must search, with sincerity, we must 
be prayerful, and we must be really and truly and genuinely prayer- 
ful, — we must go on our knees before our God; he demands it. 

Why he instituted prayer, I do not know, but he did it, and it 
suffices me to know that since he did it, my duty is to bow myself 
before my God and to appeal to him in prayer. Why the other ordin- 
ances were given, I do not know, but they were, and they have a 
purpose, and he who fails to keep these commandments of our Fath- 
er cannot hope for the blessings. 

There is a remarkable relationship between keeping the command- 
ments of God and enjoying his blessing. God chose in the beginning 
to give to his children positive commandments, that was his scheme, 
he laid down the law, and he said, my children must abide by that 
law if they will have the blessings. The prophet Joseph tells us, as 
recorded in the 130th section of the Doctrine and Covenants, "There 
is a law irrevocably decreed in the heavens before the foundations of 
this earth, upon which all blessings are predicated, and when we ob- 
tain any blessings from God, it is by obedience to the law upon which 
it is predicated." And the opposite of this is trule, that when we vio- 
late the law, the punishment that God has designed that his children 
must take, if they violate the law, will be meted out to them. How, 
then, my brothers and sisters, can we hope to know, can we hope to 
develop, can we hope for the blessings of God if we do not exercise 
our God-given faculties. I said there is a relationship between the 
keeping of the commandments of God and the enjoying of his bless- 
ings. We must put ourselves in tune with him. We must keep his 
commandments. We must obey the law, or we cannot hope for, nor 
will we receive the blessings which God has in store for his children. 
In his justice, in his mercy, in his love for his children, he could not 
give to the sinner the blessing when he failed to keep the law, the 
same as we would give it to the righteous child who did keep that law. 



. 118 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 

Now, knowing these things, and knowing that we must know 
God, that we must find him out, that we must know for ourselves, 
why is it that we stand by, let the world go on and let the Church 
go on, while we do nothing toward the salvation of our own souls ? 

The message of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints 
is a wonderful one, it is the message of life and the message of sal- 
vation. The doctrines of the Church stand alone, they have borne the 
acid test of 100 years. The world, the best brains of the world have 
endeavored to disprove them. This wonderful book from which I 
have read, the Book of Mormon, has been held up to ridicule but 
after 100 years it stands unimpeached and unimpeachable, for it is 
indeed the word of the true and the living God. We have these 
things, they are ours, we have them in our hearts, most of them ; and 
the books lie on the shelves in far too many cases, dirty and dusty 
from disuse. Why dp we not magnify the intelligence that we have, 
study and learn, prepare ourselves, so that when the time comes and 
the opportunity presents itself for us to explain the principles of the 
gospel, that we will know what the gospel is, and that we will de- 
clare it to the people in power and in truth. 

The testimony that God lives is a gift to us ; it comes to us when 
we are worthy of it. He blesses us when we strive for that blessing and 
reach out and try to get it. He is indeed our Father in heaven, to 
whom we can go and from whom we can ask a blessing. We know 
that the world gazes on an immaterial something, which they worship, 
in a way, as God. We know the true and the living God, the God of 
Israel, and we know that in this day and age he reveals his mind and 
will to his children. That testimony that the Prophet Joseph gave 100 
years ago, rings in the hearts and the ears of the Latter-day Saints 
today. Hundreds are coming into the fold, the message is bearing 
fruit, and while he is not accepted generally, his teachings and his 
principles are being accepted by the world today. Mormonism is 
going forward, it will triumph ; and the message that the mission- 
aries bear by the hundreds and the thousands will bring the honest 
in heart into the Church, for it has the ring of sincerity. My broth- 
ers and sisters, it is life eternal to know God, it is life eternal to 
know his Son, it is life eternal to know that in this day and age God 
has revealed himself, his mind and his will to the children of men. 

May we be worthy, may our testimonies grow, may we, by right- 
eous living, be so strong and so solid that we will know of ourselves 
without a doubt that God lives and that this is his Church, is my 
prayer in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER DAVID A. SMITH 

(Of the Presiding Bishopric of the Church) 

At a gathering in this city, the other day, a prominent railroad 
man recently from Europe, in making a few remarks, stated that 
when he applied to the American Consul for a passport to come to 



ELDER DAVID A. SMITH 



119 



America, a numiber of questions were asked. One of them was, "Are 
you a Bolshevist?" he answered, "no." Another, "Are you a 'Mor- 
mon'?" and he answered, "no." 

I volunteered the information that these were the two extremes ; 
and he said, "Yes, I know what Bolshivism is : I have lived with it ; 
but until now, I have not known what 'Mormonism' is ; and I want 
to say to you men here that such a spirit of friendship, I have never 
seen in Europe." 

It was my pleasure to bring that man over here to the temple 
block; his time being limited I turned him over to Brother God- 
dard and some of his associates. I called for him again in an 
hour, in order to get him to his train, and he did not care to leave the 
block — he stayed here until the very last minute. He said, "Mr. 
Smith, it is wonderful, it is wonderful, and I want to know more of 
your people and your doctrine! I understand you have missionaries 
in Holland. I intend to look them up when I get home." 

A few months ago some business men from England, made a 
tour of the United States. I read a letter day before yesterday from 
one of those men, saying, "We regret that we considered our stay 
at Salt Lake City of so little importance that we did not allow more 
time for it. Of all the visits we made to the cities of the United 
States, none were so profitable as our visit to your city." 

Soon after they were here, a number of Boy Scouts, from New 
York, called upon us. Their leaders said that they had debated some 
time as to whether it would be wise to bring those boys to Salt Lake 
City, but inasmuch as their return trip took them this way, they 
thought they would stop off for a little while. He said, "We regret 
that we did not arrange to stay longer; we have not been treated so 
well in any city of the United States as you have treated us while we 
have been with you." 

A few months ago, Brother Oscar A. Kirkham, our Scout Leader, 
was chosen as morale officer to go to Europe with the Boy Scouts 
selected from all over the United States. Some objected to a "Mor- 
mon" going for this purpose, but the leaders of that work -recognized 
through their association with his, that he was clean, that he was a 
leader and in every way qualified to take that responsible position, 
and look after those young fellows who were going to visit Europe. 

My brethren and sisters, "what God hath cleansed that call not 
thou common." And I want to tell you that in the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints, we have the gospel in its purity. I am 
sorry to say that there , are some who profess to be laboring for the 
welfare of God's children who are constantly trying to drag it into 
the mire and to cover it with filth. O, it is a wonderful work, and 
those who labor in it unceasingly, in faith, with a desire to be help- 
ful, and to do God's work, receive joy and satisfaction in their work. 
I want to tell you that I have a testimony that this gospel is true. 
I know as well as I know anything in this world that President Heber 



120 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



J. Grant holds his position through the will of God, and that he is 
influenced through the Holy Spirit which is promised to all who are 
faithful. I have seen it manifest, through him, time and time again, 
and I want to say to you that he will be successful in his administra- 
tion, in just so far as we, his brethren and his sisters, God's children, 
will support him and uphold him with our means, with our faith, and 
with our prayers. 

All the world is looking upon us as they have never looked in all 
our history. Are we doing things that will cause them to distrust, now 
that they are beginning to see the good things? Let us be "swift to 
hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath." 

I get much comfort in the statement made by the Apostle James, 
a part of which we quote quite often: "If any of you lack wisdom, 
let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth 
not; and it shall be given him." As a rule, we stop here, but I think 
the most important part of this quotation is that which follows : "But 
let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a 
wave of the sea, driven with the wind and tossed. For let not that 
man think that he shall receive anything of the Lord." 

And again we are told, a double minded man is unstable in 
all his ways. Let us not be double minded ; and when we are in doubt, 
let us go to God in faith, nothing wavering; let our lives be such 
that our houses are in order, that we are in condition to go to God 
and ask for his blessings. I know, my brethren and sisters, that if 
we will do this, with faith, nothing wavering, God will make known 
unto us, as individuals, his will, as it concerns us, and we will know 
and understand. He is not forcing his doctrine upon us, nor his bless- 
ings, and he is not influencing us through his Spirit, except when we 
are in condition to be influenced. 

Miay God's choicest blessings rest upon us, I pray, my brethren 
and sisters, let us uphold the authorities of this Church, every one. 
They are men of God, who are trying to uphold each other and to 
accomplish all that God requires of them. So I say again, let us 
set our houses in order, let us take to our homes the spirit of this 
conference. O what a wonderful thing it would be for us, as a 
people, if we could at all times earnestly carry out the instructions 
of this conference. 

O I tell you, while the people of the world are looking upon us 
more favorably at this time, if we would carry out the instructions 
we have received during this conference, and especially the text of 
President Grant, "keep the commandments," it would only be a little 
time until they would be attracted by the great influence we would 
have for good. 

May God's choicest blessings be with us, I humbly pray in the 
name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 



ELDER DAVID A. SMITH 121 

The congregation sang, "Praise to the man." 
Benediction was pronounced by Elder Benjamin Goddard, of the 
Bureau of Information. 



THIRD OVERFLOW MEETING 

The third overflow meeting was held in the Assembly Hall, Sun- 
day afternoon at 2 o'clock, October 10. 

. £ 

Elder Reed Smoot, of the Council of the Twelve, presided. 

The music was furnished by the Cottonwood stake choir, under 
the direction of Elder W. F. Robinson, Miss Bernhetta Lindsay, ac- 
companist. 

Choir sang, "An angel from on high." 

Prayer was offered by Elder Frank B. Cassidy. 

The choir sang, "Grant us peace." 

e 

ELDER EDWARD J. WOOD 

(President of the Alberta Stake of Zion) 

I am sure we all appreciate very much the splendid meetings we 
have enjoyed during this conference and the excellent words and 
music we have just heard. Singing is a fine accomplishment that 
our people greatly appreciate, and we have good music in all our 
communities. 

I am pleased to be at conference again, though not altogether 
with the position that I now occupy. I once heard a man ask another, 
what a vacuum was. The man was called upon to address a con- 
gregation, and answer the question. He said: "A vacuum, I have it 
in my head, but I can't explain it." 

I am wondering if we all believe the statement in the hymn, 
that "an angel from on high," has visited us, and revealed the gospel 
in its fulness, so that we might better understand it than we could 
have done by reading ancient scripture. I speak of this because I 
come from the far north, Canada. 

We have in course of erection a very beautiful temple. Over five 
thousand people have passed through that unfinished building, thus 
far this year, from all over the world. I think of that particularly, 
since I am in the presence of Brother Smoot, of the Council of the 
Twelve, and our respected senator from Utah. His house in Wash- 
ington is visited by many strangers who speak of him, (often when 
he does not hear them) and the good he does by the courage he mani- 
fests in always standing before the people as a Latter-day Saint. 
Only recently some people coming through the country said they at- 



122 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



tended meeting at his house in Washington. Brother Smoot did not 
know of this. They did not belong to the Church, but they admired 
the man who is always an apostle. I thought of that this morning, 
while reading in the paper that in Washington the members of the 
Church thought of renting a hall instead of holding meetings in the 
residence of Brother Smoot. We little know the good we do in en- 
tertaining strangers. 

Let me read just a little from the Doctrine and Covenants of our 
mission. I am pleased to see so many of our brethren and sisters 
here this afternoon. I notice, however, the absence of young people. 
I believe I address mostly this afternoon the parents, and without 
desiring to take up much of your time, I wish to draw your atten- 
tion briefly to our mission here. I with you have spent many years 
in the mission field, aside from presiding with one of my brethren 
in one of the stakes in Canada. I believe on us rests very largely 
the responsibility of the carrying on the work of the Lord; and I 
believe our sentiments, our true feelings and beliefs are reflected 
largely in our children ; and when we hear the fear expressed that 
young people are not quite as much interested as they should be, I 
turn critically to myself, and I hope we will all do the same to our- 
selves this afternoon. We have had very little trouble, however, in 
that great country, Canada, where we have some of the finest, most 
stalwart young men and women in all the land of Zion. I believe 
that as a child is trained', not necessarily taught, he will be, to a great 
degree, when he becomes mature. "Train up a child in the way he 
should go, and when he grows old he will not depart from it." There 
is quite a difference between training a child and teaching it. Teach- 
ing is telling, training is not only to tell, but to get the child to do, and to 
know how to do. I read from the first paragraph of Section I of the 
Doctrine and Covenants : 

Hearken, O ye people of my Church, saith the voice of him who 
dwells on high, and whose eyes are upon all men; yea, verily I say, hearken 
ye people from afar, and ye that are upon the islands of the sea, listen to- 
gether. 

I think of this in connection with my missionary experiences in 
the islands of the sea. 

For verily the voice of the Lord is unto all men, and there is none 
to escape, and there is no eye that shall not see, neither ear that shall 
not hear, neither heart that shall not be penetrated. And the rebellious 
shall be pierced with much sorrow, for their iniquities shall be spoken 
upon the housetops, and their secret acts shall be revealed. And the 
voice of warning shall be unto all people, by the mouths of my disciples, 
whom I have chosen in these last days. And they shall go forth and none 
shall stay them, for I the Lord have commanded them. 

I wish to tell you a short experience of my own. I was called on a 
third trip to one of the islands, in the days of President Joseph F. 
Smith. I think of this special prophecy as I remember the many ob- 



ELDER EDWARD J. WOOD 123 



stacles placed in our way in going to the islands. I was called to take 
a special mission to Samoa and the South Seas. I am a British sub- 
ject by naturalization. I could not leave Canada without a passport, 
but the President of the Church had called me to be in Salt Lake City 
by an appointed time, and asked if 1 could come. I should have obtained 
my passport before answering the letter, but I said, yes, I will be there. 
Then I set to work to make good my promise by applying through all 
the means available for my passport. The time approached for my 
departure, and I could not get across the line without the passport, 
but it did not come in time for me to leave. I presented the matter to 
the Lord in prayer. I told him my difficulties, and I felt that I must 
make good my word, and at least make the attempt to come. So I 
boarded the train bound for Salt Lake City without any passport. 
When I arrived at the boundary line, the emigration officers asked 
for my passport. I thought all the time, "They shall go forth and none 
shall stay them." I thought of that, and I wished that the emigration 
officer believed as much as I did of its truth ; but he did not. How- 
ever, I was somewhat acquainted with him. He said, "I will let you 
go provided you furnish the passport after." "All right," I said, "I 
shall be pleased to do it." When President Smith set me apart, he told 
me that I should go. Now he did not know anything about my not 
having a passport. I knew it would be more difficult to get out of the 
United States than to get in — leaving the port of San Francisco and 
getting to an American possession in Samoa. I knew, or thought I did, 
that I must have my passport. President Smith, laying his hands upon 
my head, said: "Brother Wood, you shall go upon your mission to 
perform the business to be attended to, and return in safety." He never 
mentioned any appointed time. All the time he was blessing me I was 
wondering about my passport. I did hope it would come. I was 
promised by our attorney that it should be registered to me in Salt 
Lake City to be here the day after my arrival. J waited, and the next 
day it did not come. The time came for us to leave. At the Oregon 
Short Line office I wired home, to learn if any news had been received 
from Ottawa, the Washington of Canada. I did not get any reply. But 
President Smith said I should go ; here was the. prophecy and revela- 
tion that none should stay the disciples from preaching the gospel. 
As it mentions in the next verse : "Behold, this is mine authority, and 
the authority of my servants, and my preface unto the book of my 
commandments, which I have given them to publish unto you, O in- 
habitants of the earth." "And they shall go forth, and none shall stay 
them, for I the Lord have commanded them." The Lord had com- 
manded me, not the emigration officers at all. So, I set out on the 
train without my passport. But I received a wire at the station that 
my passport would be in San Francisco before the steamer left. I felt 
all right again. Well, we arrived in San Francisco, and went down to 
the emigration office the day before the steamer sailed. I was there 
without my passport. I expected it would be there that evening, but 



124 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



it did not come. And the steamer was to sail, and I was there without 
my passport. When the time came to answer at the emigration office, I 
got in line, and felt fine, knowing it would be all right, but I did not 
know how. When I saw the official ask the passengers for their pass- 
ports, and some were refused, some were asked a lot of questions, and I 
did not have my passport, I stood there just as if I had it, and he did 
not know anything different. When my time came, he said, "Sit down a 
little while, Mr. Wood; I will talk to you later." Well, I knew it 
would be all right. Did you ever feel that way, when you have just 
had the elders come in to administer to a sick child, and you knew 
positively that the child would be healed? I felt these promises run- 
ning through my mind, but how should they be fulfilled? When it 
came to my turn, the emigration officer said, "Well, the time is up, 
you must come to the office tomorrow at 9. The steamer sails at 
1, and you come up, Mt. Wood." The time arrived for me to meet 
again, in the morning, and I was in line. I felt all right, though I did 
not have any passport. The emigration officer finally said, "Let's 
see, Mr. Wood, you have got your passport, go right on board the 
steamer." I said, "Thanks," and I did not have any passport at all, 
though I had the commission from President Smith, which was worth 
more than all the passports from all the governments in the world. 
But I had yet a great many difficulties. I thought, "Now, I am on the 
steamier, how am I to get off?" The most important part of all is to 
present your documents or passports before you leave. I had three 
long weeks to wear away before I should land. The Purser takes a 
kind of genealogy of each of the people. When he came to me, he 
asked me to sit down; and said, "Of course, you understand you must 
present your passport, Mr. Wood." I said, "All right, I understand 
it." "Where did you come from?" I said, "From Canada." He said, 
"Sit down, Mr. Wood. I am delighted to see you people from Canada 
so willing to go down and preach the gospel to those natives." And 
I spoke of the gospel with him ; and he asked for no passport at all. 
Well, I had other difficulties, too, but I felt all right. 

When I arrived at Honolulu, I escaped another very difficult sit- 
uation by making a pleasant gospel conversation with the emigration 
officer at that port. Then we made two thousand more miles to the 
south. I knew the most difficult time was yet to come, that is, when 
we arrived at Tutuila. How in the world to work it there I did 
not know. But I prayed to the Lord, not only twice every day for 
those several weeks, but several times every day, that other avenues 
would be opened up so that no one could stay my passing. 

I remember when that steamer entered that most beautiful harbor 
which Mr. Robert Louis Stevenson named Pago Pago, I went up 
on land, and many of the natives that I had seen before met me, and 
made their characteristic salutation. They were glad that I had 
come. I saw one of our boys from Canada leading a splendid band, 
and they had come to welcome me. Then again I began to wonder 



ELDER EDWARD J. WOOD 



125 



when I would get off again, and yet whenever I would remember these 
promises, I would take courage again. The steamer only stayed there 
six hours, and we were lined up again. Now this was the final get- 
ting through without a passport, and I had to buoy up my spirit to 
meet the emergency. They came within one of me, when the emigra- 
tion officer said, "Sit down, I want to ask you a question." And 
he said to me, "Mr. Wood, get your passport ready." "All right." 
I had the missionary appointment from President Smith, I had the 
promise, and the prophecy in this revelation, that "none shall stay 
them." When he had called me, and it was my turn to present my pass- 
port, he turned to the man next to me and said, "Why, you are a 
New Yorker." And this officer went over and had a conversation 
with this man he called the New Yorker. When he came back, he 
said, "Let me see, Mr. Wood, I have had your passport all right, 
you may go on." 

My fellow parents, we are all just like one large family, regard- 
less of places of residence ; we are all Latter-day Saints ; we are all in- 
terested in one another. What is a success in Canada is courage to 
you, and what is your success here may make us feel well in Canada, 
because, not like other peoples of the world, we are all members of 
one large family. I say to you, that if, as parents, we can win our boys 
and girls to righteousness around our family hearths, it is far bet- 
ter than to place them in the hands of the Purity League, or even the 
ward teachers, or any one else. Let me, as the father of my children, 
and my wife as their mother, win the hearts of our boys and girls 
at home, win their confidence, and others will have very little trouble 
over them. I think of it when I see the mothers with their babies on 
their knees. Why they would not think of letting the little baby fall, 
not for all the world. They watch over its every movement, fearful 
that it might fall. Far easier it would be to heal the broken arm of 
the infant than the injured mentality, the perverted heart of the 
grown child who often leaves his home with very little concern of his 
parents. We are not concerned enough as parents over our children. 
When I think again of the Islands, of how those people there teach 
their children to respect their parents, it is marvelous in the extreme. 
You call those natives uncivilized. I have seen a young man wild, al- 
most uncooth in his habits, taken into the council of chiefs, at the 
death of his father, and at once he becomes dignified, almost ma- 
jestic, feeling the responsibilty of his father upon his shoulders in 
the council of chiefs. It is because the boy was taught when he was 
young, aye more, he was trained, how to act when he became a man, 
how to act the chief that his father was before he died. 

O the faith of those natives, if we only had it ! If we simply 
knew, if we had the knowledge (more than faith) of the mission of 
our Church itself, in which we are taught that when I go into eternity 
with my wife to whom I am sealed, my joy, our joy, will not be com-

plete until we have in our circle some, yes, every one, of our chil- 
dren. Let us not wait until it is too late. 

I remember once a woman on the Islands — to show you how the 
Lord goes before and with us, his elders and servants, and after us, 
on those Islands — a lady had a very sick child, and when they are 
sick they have faith in the power of the Priesthood to restore. We 
had only been there a few weeks. Nobody knew us there, did not know 
that we had arrived. A man came up to the house where we were 
holding service. He did not understand us; he had to speak 
through an interpreter; and he said to me, "There is a lady on the 
other Island with a sick child. She wants you three men to go to 
her, and heal her child." It was right on the verge of the war there. 
The first edict made by the king under the German government 
was that a "Mormon" missionary who preached was to be find $100 
for the first sermon, and for the second he was to be banished from 
the Island. They made that edict, and we thought we were in trouble 
till this man said, that that woman had asked that' we three men go 
unto her and lay our hands upon her child and the child should recover. 
We went out to a palm tree and talked to the Lord as I am talking 
to you, wanting the inspiration of his Spirit. Soon we decided we 
would go. After going across a strait some three miles in a little 
canoe, expecting almost every moment that the canoe would be over- 
turned, we arrived. The woman was standing in front of her house. 
She had her handkerchief to her eyes, and said, "I am glad that you 
have come. It is all right. Here is my child." And under the sheet 
was the body of the child. We lifted that up and saw the child, 
and we said, "the child is already dead, and we covered it up again; 
and she hastily said, "No, it is not dead at all. You do what I saw 
you do last night in my dream, and he will be well." We asked 1 the 
Lord, "suppose we administer to this child, and it does not get well, 
and they will say you are all evil spirits. They are a superstitious 
people." We had no faith that the child would recover. But the un- 
precedented faith of this native woman inspired us to do it. And she 
said, "Have you authority to do what I saw you do? You anointed 
that child with oil; you laid your hands upon his head." Yes, we 
had that authority. And then I thought of that passage that "my ser- 
vants must go forth, and my authority shall be with them, and none 
shall stay them." I said, "Yes, we have that authority." Said she, 
"have you the authority to refuse?" I said, "no." We anointed the 
child, laid our hands upon it, covered it up, and went away. The cy- 
clone came on, the social condition of the natives was upset ; we never 
heard of the woman and child for a long while. I didn't expect to hear 
from it, until about a year after when I saw a number of natives under 
trees, with long knives. I saw them running along beneath the trees in 
their half-clad condition. Then I thought again that none should stay 
the preaching of this gospel So I buoyed myself up as best I could, and 
marched on. I saw the natives surrounding me on all sides. and as I

came ,to a house in that tropical forest, they commenced to get closer 
to me, when all at once a woman marched out, and! said, "How do 
you do, Brother Wood ?" I rather sank back, and said, "I don't know 
you." "O yes, you do," and she turned and called a child about 
nine years of age. She stood the child upon the trunk of a tree, and 
then she bore this testimony to the great crowd of natives : "This child 
is a living testimony of the great power of the gospel, and the power 
and authority held by Brother Wood and his associates. They ad- 
ministered to this child /over two years ago. I have never seen them 
since, but I know they have the power of God with them, and all of 
you must listen to their message. I am the daughter of the high chief 
of the island, and you can come to my house and have everything 
you want." 

I went, and the natives followed along, and I sat up nearly all 
night preaching to them. We had a good spirit. I mention this to 
you to prove that the divinity and. power of the Priesthood is with the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints today. But the evil one 
is ever present. 

One morning, on one occasion, when I was dressing, I felt some- 
thing alive on my neck, and I hit it at once, and I was bitten? by a cen- 
tipede, one of the most deadly of insects on the Islands. My arm 
commenced to swell. The natives came and said, "Give us your last 
message ; you will die within an hour." I felt excruciating pain. Then 
up came the woman. The natives had told her that I was killed by the 
deadly insect, and I was there with them. The woman came up very 
leisurely. She shook my hand showing she expected consolation. She 
said, "That is all right, Brother Wood. Have you got any of that oil 
with you?" I said, "Yes, get my valise. "Now," she said, "Do what 
you did to my child, and you will be all right." I felt when she said 
that, that I positively knew it would be so. I anointed my hand, and 
the swelling left, just like taking a glove off my hand, and she turned 
to the natives who had gathered around, and said, "As I told you, the 
Lord is with this young man, and his Church, and his people." 

Brethren and sisters, let us inspire this faith, this confidence, in 
the hearts of our growing children, and never get away from the fact 
that we are responsible for them in their future life. God bless you. 
Amen. 



ELDER WM. H. MENDENHALL 

(President of the Bannock Stake of Zion) 

My beloved brethren : It is an inspiration to me to stand before 
this congregation, to look into your faces, and to listen to the testi- 
mony and the teachings of the presiding authorities during this con- 
ference. And I have been made to feel that the hand of the Lord is 



128 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



visible, and that he is leading and directing the brethren of the priesc- 
hood that preside over us in this Church. 

Permit me for a few moments to call your attention again to the 
revelation contained in the first section of the Doctrine and Covenants, 
that part that has been read and referred to by President Wood. The 
Lord inspired the Prophet Joseph Smith in this revelation, given be- 
fore the organization of the Church, when he declared that this gospel, 
the word of the Lord, shall be carried as a witness unto all nations 
by the men and women who may be called in the last day. 

When Brother Wood was relating his experience, showing that 
none should stay the hand of the Lord in carrying out his purposes, it 
reminded me of an incident in my missionary experience, when I la- 
bored on the Sandwich Islands. It was customary at that time, when 
the missionaries were going from one island to another, to present 
to the officials their missionary certificate, which we always carried 
in our pockets. I remember being sent out to one of the islands, when 
I first lived in that mission, and after I had taken my place on the 
boat the officer came around inquiring who we were, and asking for 
our missionary certificates. I presented my missionary certificate to 
him, but he did not want to accept it, and he told me I would have 
to go ashore. And I argued with him, that I had been called of the 
Lord as a missionary, that I had my missionary certificate signed by 
President Wilford Woodruff, and I was entitled to go where I had 
been sent by the president of that mission. While we were arguing, 
the steamer weighed anchor and began to leave the shore ; and in our 
heated argument he saw that was his last chance to get back on to 
the wharf; so he jumped on to the wharf, and I remained on the 
boat. It was too far for me to jump, so I went on my mission, as I 
had been directed by the president of that mission. So I know, my 
brethren and sisters, that the hand of the Lord is in the ministry of 
this gospel in the nations of the earth. And the Lord has said in this 
revelation, that this gospel shall be preached in all the world by his 
disciples who shall be chosen in the last days. They are gone forth. 
The gospel has been preached in almost all the nations of the world. 
Men and women are accepting its principles. They are becoming 
members of the Church, full of the Spirit of the Lord and a desire 
to serve him and keep his commandments. 

There is a certain responsibility rests upon us, in respect to our 
attendance at these conferences. I very often wonder in my mind, in 
my visits to these conferences, why so many people from all over 
Zion, and from the missions in the world, can spend their time and 
their means attending these conferences, and I wonder what benefit 
we derive from the attendance at the conferences. The Lord com- 
manded through the Prophet Joseph Smith that these conferences 
should be held, that the people might come up to the center place 
of Zion and hear the word of the Lord from the presiding authorities 
of his Church, that their faith in the work of the Lord might be 
strengthened, that our determination may increase to serve the Lord 



ELDER WM, H. MENDENHALL

and keep his commandments. So we come up here, and listen to the 
presiding authorities of the Church, the presidents of missions and 
brethren who are called upon from time to time to teach us the word 
of the Lord. It becomes our duty, in order that the purposes of the 
Lord might be fulfilled in these conference gatherings, that when we 
shall go to our homes, when we go to the different stakes and wards 
of Zibn, that we shall reflect the spirit, the admonition, the teaching, 
that we receive at these conferences in our lives, that by so doing the 
brethren and sisters who are not able to attend these conferences 
might be benefited in a general way for our having come up to wor- 
ship the Lord. Thus I understand why so many of us take advantage 
of this opportunity of gathering together. 

There is a great deal of work for us to do in the Church. We 
make every effort to send our boys into the mission fields to preach 
the gospel. We make every sacrifice necessary that they may be sus- 
tained while in the world preaching the gospel. We rejoice that 
they have been considered worthy by the presiding authorities of 
the Church to go out into the world to preach the gospel. Yet right 
here at home, in the stakes of Zion, in the wards, there is ample 
missionary work for us all. Among our neighbors, among our asso- 
ciates and friends, an opportunity presents itself for us to labor, to 
do missionary work. In this connection, I desire to read from the 
fourth section of the Doctrine and Covenants. Joseph Smith, Senior, 
early in the beginning of this work, in the year 1829, was full of a 
desire to promote the work of the Lord as in part it had been re- 
vealed to his son, Joseph the prophet. Joseph, Senior, accepted the 
testimony of his son. Desirous of helping in this great work, he 
went to his son, and he said: "My boy, what can I do to help this 
work along? What can I do that the same Spirit of the Lord that I 
possess, that has been manifest in your ministry, might be felt by 
all the people of the earth? What may I do to help you to accom- 
plish this work?" And the Lord said, through the Prophet Joseph 
Smith : 

Now, behold, a marvelous work is about to come forth among the 
children of men; therefore, O ye that embark in the service of God, see 
that you serve him with all your heart, might, mind, and strength, that ye 
may stand blameless before God at the last day; therefore, if ye have 
desires to serve God, ye are called to the work, for behold, the field is 
white already to harvest, and lo, he that thrusteth in his sickle with his 
might, the same layeth up in store that he perish not, but bringeth salva- 
tion to his soul; and faith, hope, charity and love, with an eye single to 
the glory of God, qualify him for the work. Remember faith, virtue, 
knowledge, temperance, patience, brotherly kindness, goodness, charity, 
humility, diligence. Ask and ye shall receive, knock and it shall be 
opened unto you. Amen. (Doc. and Cov. Sec. 4.) 

This is the admonition, the instruction, of the Lord through 
the Prophet Joseph Smith to his father, and it applies to us in our 
mjinistry and service in this Church. If we have a desire to serve 
the Lord, we are called to the ministry, we are called to set ex- 
amples that will be worthy of imitation. We are called to use our 

5

hands and the powers of our minds in the advancement of the work 
of the Lord among our associates and friends ; and the Lord charges 
us with the responsibility of being kind, full of love, and full of his 
Spirit in our ministry among the people, that we shall be charitable 
towards each other, that we shall uphold the authorities of the Church, 
that we shall in no way find fault with them or tear down their 
character, but that we shall sustain them in our ministry and labors, 
with our faith, prayers and determination, to the end that the work of 
the Lord may grow and increase in the earth, and that it shall ful- 
fil its destiny among the people. 

I rejoice in the testimony of the gospel. I know that it is true ■ 
I have no doubt in my mind. I am in harmony with the presiding 
authorities of the Church. I uphold and sustain them in their work. 
And when I was called upon a mission, a number of years ago, ! 
remember that President Heber J. Grant set me apart to labor as a 
missionary in the Sandwich Islands ; and I remember in blessing me 
he placed his hands upon my head and said, "Brother Mendenhall, 
if you will but serve the Lord, do your duty, rely upon him, the Lord 
will give you a knowledge of his work. The Lord will enable you 
to do much good while you labor upon the Islands, and you shall 
come home in safety. The Lord will prosper you so long as you 
accomplish the duties of your mission, and keep his commandments." 
I want to testify to you that the words of the prophet upon my head 
have been fulfilled. The Lord gave me a knowledge of the Hawaiian 
language. He gave me power and influence among the people, and I 
believe I was able to do some good ; and upon my return home, I 
have endeavored to devote my services to the work of the Lord, and 
I thank him for the blessings that I enjoy. This is my testimony in 
relation to this work that has been established on the earth for the 
salvation of the children of men. 

May the Lord help us to do our duty, is my prayer in the name 
of Jesus Christ. Amen.

ELDER PETER M. HANSEN 

(President of the Bear River Stake of Zion) 

My brethren and sisters: I have greatly rejoiced during this con- 
ference in the splendid music that we have heard, and in the admo- 
nitions and counsel that we have received from the servants of the 
Lord who have addressed us. The spirit of humility, peace, and love 
that has actuated the speakers has certainly made me rejoice that we 
live in. this day and age of the world when the gospel has been re- 
vealed, and that we have the privilege of living and enjoying the 
splendid privileges that are ours, as Latter-day Saints. We rejoice 
in these privileges, my brethren and sisters, and I feel to honor the

Lord and to keep his commandments, and feel that our spirits are in 
tune with the inspiration that we have received from' the brethren 
in authority in the Church. I hope we all feel grateful for these bless- 
ings, and that these things will spur us on to live nearer to the Lord 
in the future than we have in the past. 

In our stake of Zion we have been doing some little missionary 
work the past year among the people. Special missionaries have been 
called ; and in visiting among the Latter-day Saints, we found too 
many people in our stake of Zion who did not pray in their families, 
nor teach prayer in their homes, consequently their children were not 
becoming accustomed to pray. 1 fear this condition is too prevalent 
among us as Latter-day Saints, and consequently many of us have not 
the spirit of humility and love for the gospel of Jesus Christ that 
we ought to have burning in our souls. We also found too many 
who were not observing the Word of Wisdom, as we have heard 
in this conference. We found that too many of our acting teachers 
in the stake were not observing this commandment. When they went 
into the homes of the Latter-day Saints they could not teach this 
principle, because they were not observing it themselves. As a rule 
we found our young people living nearer up to this principle than 
many of our older brethren and sisters. Hence we have found it 
necessary to take up this labor among the people in our stake of 
Zion. I testify to you that we have met with splendid results. We 
have talked over the reports received from: different wards, two or 
three times now. We find a little improvement each time these re- 
ports come in, and the brethren and sisters will say, "you shall not 
have to report again that we are not observing this splendid law." 

As we have heard during this conference, this is a splendid law 
for the Latter-day Saints, and it has been preached to us now, as we 
have heard from Brother Lyman, for eighty years, and yet I fear 
that we are no nearer, perhaps, in observing this law than we were 
many years ago. To me it is a glorious principle. It is both our 
temporal salvation and financial. 

I attended the fair last Saturday, and saw a great many blessings 
that the Lord has showered upon us, in our crops and in our herds ; 
we can almost produce everything that we need here in this state- — 
beautiful fruits and vegetables and everything else that we need. It 
seems to me that there should not be an excuse for not living well up 
to the Word of Wisdom. One can always single out a man who is 
addicted to tobacco. He is not particular about his person, as a gen- 
eral rule. Hence we ought to take heed to this counsel' so often re- 
ceived from the brethren and sisters who live in harmony with this law. 

I remember Brother Francis M. Lyman came to our stake on 
one occasion, and said : "Now, Latter-day Saints, come out this after- 
noon, and I will teach you how to get rich." Well, we had a pretty 
good turn-out of the people and he told them : "No matter what you 
make, what you produce, put away 25 cents every day, and you will 



132 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



see how it will amount up, and you will prosper and the Lord will 
be with you and bless you." 

This has been a prosperous year for the Latter-day Saints. We 
have enjoyed prosperity, and we have enjoyed the blessings of the 
Lord generally, and the only way that I can feel satisfied is by re- 
membering the Lord and giving unto him that which belongs to him 
in tithes and offerings. 

I feel grateful for the privilege we enjoy as Latter-day Saints. 
The spirit of peace, love and union, I pray may be increased among 
us, that we may have a desire to keep the commandments, and live in 
harmony with the knowledge we have received and the privileges thai 
we enjoy. I pray that the Lord will bless us and inspire our minds, 
that we may live according to these practical principles of the gospel, 
which is my prayer, and I ask it in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The anthem "Hosannah" was rendered by the choir. 



ELDER GEORGE W. McCUNE 

(President of the Eastern States Mission) 

My dear brethren and sisters: I am glad indeed to be with you 
today, and partake of the wonderful spirit present. A little story 
comes to my mind. Once upon a time a splendid old couple lived 
in a community, and had won the respect of all their neighbors; and 
their neighbors were wont to show their love for this goodly couple 
on various occasions. And at one time they presented them with a 
nice jar of peaches, put up in brandy sauce. It seemed that this 
good couple did not like peaches, and when they acknowledged the 
token, they wrote a small note like this : "Dear friends, we regret 
to say that we did not like the peaches, but we did enjoy the spirit 
in which they were sent." 

I earnestly desire that I may speak to you a few minutes under 
the Spirit of the Lord which my brethren preceding me have enjoyed, 
so that you will enjoy the spirit with which I speak to you. 

I testify to you that the Spirit of God, like a fire, is burning; 
and if you have failed to enjoy it here this afternoon, it is not the 
fault of the brethren who have spoken to you, and it is not the fault 
of the music that has been rendered, for I do know that the Spirit of 
God is here,' and it is the sweetest thing in all the world. There is 
no place in all the world where I would rather be than here, today — or 
rather, just a few steps from here, where I expect soon to be. 

I bring you greetings from your sons and daughters who are 
laboring in the Eastern States mission. I am glad to report that 
they enjoy a wonderful spirit, that God is with them, that they are 
doing a wonderful work. I feel that we all need the gospel preached 



ELDER GEORGE W. McCUNE 



133 



unto us, and I know of no one in all the world' who can impress 
you more thoroughly with the need of a genuine repentance and a 
knowledge of the truth than those splendid sons and daughters whom 
you have sent out into the world, and I hope you will send back to 
them a message of good cheer. 

I was delighted in hearing President Wood relate some mani- . 
festations of God's power, for it is a fact that our Father in heaven 
has not changed, and he is pleased to bestow his power upon his 
servants who will serve him. He is the same yesterday, today and 
forever. We read of the wonderful blessings he poured out upon 
his people in ancient times, and I testify that he is willing to do 
the same to us, if we abide by his laws which called down the bless- 
ings of heaven upon them. I testify to you that we are enjoying the 
same gifts and blessings of God, for they do follow them' that believe. 

We enjoy many manifestations of God's glorious Spirit in the 
mission field, and we do at home, I realize. We recently had a little 
controversy — but I wish to stop here and state that we do not con- 
tend with the people of the world. We have no contention whatever 
with the people of the world, but we have a beautiful message of life 
and salvation to give to them, a message which gives no offense ; 
it is a positive inspiration for all humanity. We do not contend for 
it, but give it to the world for their acceptance or rejection. 

Upon one occasion, lately, a learned gentleman saw fit to chal- 
lenge our statements while speaking to a splendid congregation, and 
he got up and raved about the so-called "Mormons" being the 
richest people in all the world. He also said that we had come out 
there to get their women to take them back to Utah, but he seemed 
to feel very bad that the "Mormon" people were the richest people in 
all the world, and thought that was a terrible crime. I saw fit to 
answer him. I told him that we came not for their women, but I 
had to plead guilty to the second charge that our people were the 
richest people in all the world. He had made the statement that we 
owned many stocks and bonds, and one thing and another, but he did 
not state our original riches. I proceeded to tell him that over 85 per 
cent of our people own their own homes, and the land, not merely 
the furniture and fixtures in their homes, but the ground on which 
their homes were erected, and I pleaded guilty to that. They owned 
many good things of a worldly nature, and I called their attention to 
them, that their acquirements had been accomplished in the midst of 
drivings and persecutions, from the time the Church was organized 
until the time that we reached the valleys of the mountains, and even 
after that our Church property had been confiscated. And I called 
his attention to the fact that we had to meet the same taxation as other 
people, and we had also made the same contributions, fully up to the 
standard of any of them, in the recent war ; and, in addition to 
these, our young men, to a very large number, had given at least two 
years of their time in preaching the gospel, and they had borne their 



134

expenses while doing so, and that this necessitates taking them away 
from the various business interests of the community; and in addition 
to this we had paid one-tenth of all that God had given us, back to 
him ; and in the face of all this we were the richest people in the world. 

I then told them how it had been accomplished. 1 told them that 
they were not the greatest riches we possessed, but our greatest riches 
consisted in having a testimony that God lives, that we know that God 
has spoken in these last days, that we are willing to accept his won- 
derful revelations ; and through that means we had received and ac- 
cepted the gospel which is the power of God unto salvation, not 
only a salvation in the far off eternities, but an immediate salvation, 
so far as we would live it, and we were being saved temporally. In 
the words of the speaker I was answering, we were the richest people 
in all the world. We had the power of God unto salvation, not only 
intellectually but morally. And I rejoiced exceedingly in being able 
to proclaim these things. 

I rejoice in being present here this afternoon. There has been 
a wonderful spirit present. I hope 1 have said nothing to detract 
from what has been said previously. I felt at the conclusion of the 
brethren's talk that the feeling was almost too sacred to disturb. It 
is a wonderful thing to be able to come together and partake of the 
Spirit of the Lord, as we have today, and I hope that we will strive 
earnestly to take the message that has been given to us, and live it, 
for I know it has been an inspiration to all of us. 

After listening to the key-note speech of President Grant, and 
the addresses of the other brethren, I was telling some of my folks, 
at luncheon, that I felt that they were speaking to me personally, and 
the others responded with the same thought, that they felt that the 
message was to them directly. I hope we will all go to our homes 
feeling earnestly the desire in our hearts that we will keep the com- 
mandments, that we will strive to manifest the spirit of love and char- 
ity in all our walks and talks in life. 

In the world, the greatest difficulty we meet is the sense of in- 
difference, and after we have reasoned with people, and tried to explain 
the plan of salvation to them, they almost universally come back with 
the saying, "Well, we are all on the road to the same goal ; you are 
taking one road, and we are taking another, but we are all destined 
to reach the same goal." What a mistake ! The scriptures teach noth- 
ing of the kind, but the Master said, there is only one way, and 
he that entereth by another way is to be accounted as a thief and a 
robber. We have gone in through the narrow gate into the straight 
and narrow way, and we cannot afford to step to the right to take 
advantage of our brethren ; we cannot step to the left to steal or to 
lie or to disobey the commandments of God. We must keep on in 
the straight and narrow way if we want to become partakers of the 
kingdom of God. I hope that we will strive earnestly; and these ex- 
hortations I want to direct to myself even more than to you. 



ELDER GEORGE W. McCUNE

I rejoice exceedingly that I have been accounted worthy to go 
out and preach the gospel of my Redeemer. I realize that it is an 
opportunity. It is a blessed privilege to be given the opportunity to 
go out into the vineyard and work for the kingdom of God. I find 
that some are doing that at home. I was exceedingly gratified with the 
work that the father of one of our missionaries is doing in Ogden, and 
I had heard of it before. He is sending his friends the Liahona 
tracts, and other literature, as well as his own testimony, and I was 
glad to find that he has the same sweet joy and satisfaction in doing 
these things at home that we enjoy out in the world. And I exhort 
you, brethren and sisters, to live up to this opportunity so far as it 
is in your power, for it is a privelege and blessing, and we are all en- 
listed to it. 

I do not desire to take more of your time this afternoon. I feel 
that it would not be right, inasmuch as we have Brother Smoot and 
others that we would all like to listen to. As for me, I have heard 
a definition of a good speech that I like. The British premier says 
there are three fundamentals to a good speech, and I find much con- 
solation in his definition, because it is the only one that I have hopes 
of applying to myself. He says, the first is to stand up, the second 
is to speak up, and the third is to shut up. The blessings of the 
Lord I earnestly pray for us all, my brethren and sisters, in the 
name of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER REED SMOOT 

I have enjoyed the spirit of this conference greatly. I thank my 
heavenly Father for the privilege I have had of listening to the won- 
derful testimonies that have been borne, and the explanation of the 
sayings of the Savior, and the revelations of our heavenly Father. And 
I, like every one who has attended the conference, without a doubt 
in our minds, feel that the present conference is among the best con- 
ferences ever held by the Church. 

I have not the time to take up any special subject as the adjourn- 
ment hour is nearly at hand. 

BAPTISM FOR THE DEAD 

Yesterday I asked Hon. Albert J. Beveridge of Indiana, to at- 
tend the afternoon session of our conference. We came into the 
temple block by the east gate, and as we walked down the path to- 
wards the tabernacle, he stopped and looked at the temple. He asked 
when the "Mormon" people began to build this magnificent structure. 
I told him the erection of the building was begun in the year 1853, 
long before there was a railroad in this country, and at a time when 
the people had very little of this world's goods. I called his attention 
to the fact that the building of the temple was an evidence of the 
faithfulness and loyalty of the people to the work established by God

in this dispensation. It did not take so much ready money, but it 
did take a spirit of determination and sacrifice that could only come 
through a knowledge that they were working in the service of God. 
Said he, "What do they use the temple for?" I told him of the sacred 
ordinance.-; of baptism for the dead; I told him of the eternal 
marriage covenant, and that our people believed in both, and -the 
vicarious work that was preached by the apostles of old was attended 
to in our temples. He said, "What do you mean bv baptism for 
the dead?" Said I, "Senator Beveridge, we mean this, that we are 
carrying out the same instructions in regard to this wonderful princi- 
ple as taught in the days of the Savior and his ancient apostles. I 
referred him to Paul's letter to the Corinthians. And he said, "That 
is wonderful. Are there any other churches in all the world today 
that preach and practice it?" "No." "Well, tell me the operation." 
I said, "Suppose my great-grandfather had lived at a time (which 
he did) before the gospel, as revealed in this dispensation, had ever 
been preached, or a testimony of an elder of the Church had ever 
been heard ; some relative can be baptized for him. And that is a 
great part of the work that is done in the temple." 

IMPRESSIVENESS OF THE LAIE TEMPLE AND GROUNDS 

My brethren and sisters, the world will yet understand the work 
in our temples in carrying out the revelations and teaching of the 
Master; and sometime in the near future it will be a potent power 
to bring the people not only to an investigation of the gospel, but it 
will bring them to a realization that it is of God. 

I had an experience upon the boat not long ago in coming from 
Honolulu. I have not the time to go into it, but it was with a min- 
ister of the gospel telling me that I could find nowhere in the Bible 
that he believed in or taught from a reference to the principle of 
baptism for the dead. This conversation was the result of his recent 
visit to the Hawaiian Islands, and in his drive around the Island of 
Oahu, he had visited the temple grounds at Laie. And, my brethren 
and sisters, there have been few visitors to that island since the com- 
pletion of the temple, and I doubt ever will be, but who will stand in 
front of that magnificent building, that wonderful approach to the 
house of the Lord, and receive an impression of the sincerity at least, 
if not the knowledge, of this people, in temple work. 

PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH'S DEDICATION OF THE TEMPLE SITE 

Five years ago I had the privilege of going with President Smith 
and Bishop Nibley to the Hawaiian Islands. Somehow or other, my 
heart goes out to those people. They are of the blood of Israel, and 
the faith spoken of by Brother Wood as found in the people of Samoa 
is enjoyed' by the natives of the Hawaiian Islands, where the power 
and manifestation of God have been shown among that people. I 
attended a gathering of the people at Laie in honor of President 



ELDER REED SMOOT 



137 



Smith, in June, 1915. At the close of the exercises, President Smith 
came to me and said, "Reed, I want you to take a walk with me." 
And as we went out of the door, he said to Bishop Nibley, "I wish 
you would accompany us." I never saw a more beautiful night in all 
my life; the surroundings were perfect. You who have been at Laie 
know the surroundings ; all nature smiles. We walked toward the 
meetinghouse. Nothing was said of what we were going for until 
we stood at the back of the meetinghouse, and President Smith then 
said : "Brethren, this is the birthday of President ISrigham Young, 
June 1, 1915. I feel impressed to dedicate this ground for the erec- 
tion of a temple to God, for a place where the peoples of the Pacific 
Isles can come and do their temple work. I have not presented this 
to the Council of the Twelve or to my counselors ; but if you think 
there would be no objection to it, I think now is the time to dedicate 
the ground." I have heard President Smith pray hundreds of times. 
He has thrilled my soul many times with his wonderful spirit of 
prayer and his supplications to our heavenly Father. But never in 
all my life did I hear such a prayer. The very ground seemed to be 
sacred, and he seemed as if he were talking face to face with the 
Father. I cannot and never will forget it if I lived a thousand years. 
Five years, and the temple was completed and dedicated, and it is a 
marvelous building of beauty and loveliness, as every one who will 
visit it will see. 

LOVE OF THE NATIVES FOR PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH 

It was on the Island of Maui that God spoke to President George 
Q. Cannon. Our heavenly Father told him where to go, the very 
house to enter, and there he would find a man who would receive 
him. And it was on those islands that he, as a young man, was given 
the language by the power of God. And it was on those islands that 
President Joseph F. Smith began his missionary work. 

Talk about people loving a man! I do not believe it is possible 
for human beings to love a man more than did the natives of the 
islands love President Joseph F. Smith. Five years ago when he 
landed at Honolulu, on his arrival at the mission house, there stood 
in the front door President Smith's native "mamma," blind, but oh, 
what a greeting there was. No mother and son ever met with greater 
manifestations of love for each other. 

Temple building, temple work, salvation for our dead and salva- 
tion for ourselves have just begun ; the ninth temple is about to be 
erected in Arizona. I look to see the time when temples will be 
erected in all parts of the world, and the peoples of the world will 
understand that this wonderful principle revealed again to the Prophet 
Joseph is given for the world's salvation. 

WHO ARE THE NATIVE HAWAIIANS? 

I said these people were of the blood of Israel. I don't think 
there is any question about that. They are the direct descendants

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



of Lehi. When I was in Honolulu a little while ago, there was a 
great conference being held considering the question of where the 
natives of the islands came from and who they were. I have no 
doubt they drifted from America. We do know this., that not long 
ago the government of the United States, in order to determine how 
the trade winds affected navigation took a bottle and outside of the 
Golden Gate dropped it into the ocean; and inside of the bottle was a 
note asking the person finding the bottle to notify the government at 
Washington, the time and place. Twenty days after the dropping of 
the bottle into the ocean, outside of the Golden Gate, the bottle was 
picked up on the shores of Laie, the home of the "Mormon" people. 
Oh, I have heard President Smith tell those people that Laie should 
forever be a refuge for the natives of those islands. I have heard 
him dedicate the ground for that purpose, and I believe it was given 
by our Father to those people for that very purpose. 

Strange, folks say, that one hundred years or more ago, when 
each of those islands had a king, it was definitely understood by 
every king over the different islands, and it was lived up to strictly, 
that whenever a native of any of the islands reached Laie, the place 
of refuge, there was no power that could remove him from there. 
Laie was the natives' place of refuge in years past, and today it is 
the home of the natives belonging to our Church. 

May God bless us in our labors, I ask, in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 

The choir sang, "The sunset glories of the west." 
Benediction was pronounced by Elder Andrew Jenson, Assistant 
Church Historian. 



FOURTH OVERFLOW MEETING 

A fourth overflow meeting was held in the Bureau of Informa- 
tion assembly hall, Sunday afternoon at 2 o'clock, October 10. 

Elder Richard R. Lyman, of the Council of the Twelve, presided. 

The music was furnished by the congregation and the Swanee 
Singers of Granite Stake, under the direction of Elder J. S. Cornwall. 

The singers and congregation sang, "Do what is right." 

Prayer was offered by Elder Alfred W. Peterson. 

The Swanee Singers sang, "Just as God Leads." 

ELDER JONATHAN C. CUTLER 

(President of the Curlew Stake of Zion) 

It is certainly gratifying to see the interest manifested by the Lat- 
ter-day Saints in attending our conferences. I presume that on the 



ELDER JONATHAN C. CUTLER 



139 



Temple block, at the present time, in the three buildings, and on the 
grounds, there are not less than twelve to fifteen thousand Latter-day 
Saints, eager to get inspiration from the servants of the Lord. To me 
this is very gratifying and pleasing indeed. I feel truly thankful for 
the title Latter-day Saint which I bear. 1 am also pleased, and 
appreciate the honor to be counted worthy, to be a representa- 
tive of this great Church. While I feel that I am out of place to 
be called upon to address the Latter-day Saints who come so far 
to these conferences, and while I feel that the brethren and sisters 
who attend would rather hear the general authorities than some 
of the local brethren, yet, obedient to the call, I comply and desire 
that the Lord will bless me with his Spirit, and if he has anything 
to say, through me, I would only be too pleased to give utterance, for 
I desire to do all the good I can, and as little harm as possible. 

The Apostle Peter gives us to understand that God is no respecter 
of persons, but in all nations he that feareth him and worketh right- 
eousness is accepted of him. We are all God's children. We have a 
perfect right to be equal. We were created equal, and we have a per- 
fect right to remain equal, according to our works and our diligence 
here in the earth. But it is true we have our agency. We had it in 
the beginning, when the spirits were organized in the spirit world. 
God did not see fit to take our agency from us, but in the spirit world 
we exercised our free agency, and we still have the privilege here 
of exercising it. Men and women can do as they please. God is not 
going to compel us to do anything. As the poet says, "He'll call, per- 
suade, direct aright — in countless ways be good and kind — but never 
force the human mind." We are all acting on our own resources and 
responsibilities, — upon our own honor and judgment. God does not 
interfere, but gives all a chance; and he is no respecter of persons, 
and the call is to all, regardless of creed. 

There seems to be at present in the whole world a disregard for 
law and order. I look back to my younger days — I am still a boy, 
but I look back to when I was younger than I am today — and I see a 
marked change in conditions as they now exist. Remember that 
law and order were observed in heaven. It is true we had the right 
to exercise our agency, but, at the same time, law and order were 
prevailing, even in the spirit world, in heaven. The laws of our gov- 
ernment are patterned after the laws of God. Law and order at 
least should prevail here in this great nation of ours; in fact, they 
should in the whole world. But there is a strong tendency today 
to disregard both law and order. 

Before I arose from my bed this morning I received a thought 
that I pondered over. At the place that I was stopping, I heard in 
the hallway a mother say to her child, "Child, don't go down stairs." 
And the child said, "Why?" — seemed to rebel at once. That seems 
to be the condition at the presnt time ; we haven't learned the lesson 
that Adam learned. You remember the Lord told Adam in the be- 



140 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



ginning to offer sacrifice. There were no whys nor wherefores with 
Adam ; it was the Lord's right to speak and Adam understood it. 
You remember a little later, when the angel visited him, he put this 
question to him, "Adam, why do you offer sacrifice?" Adam said, "I 
know not, only that God has commanded it." 

Above all, I believe that Latter-day Saints should learn this les- 
son. We are beginning to fall into the ways of the world, and we 
question the authority of God here on the earth, and when we are 
asked, as the little child was asked this morning, not to go down the 
stairs, we want to know why. We do not follow the example of 
Adam. This seems to be the tendency in the Church today. We find 
that a great many of our people have lost track of the law of order 
and rule, and want to be a law unto themselves. 

It is very true that in cases, when the time is ripe and proper, 
we have a right to counsel. For instance, we take the body of law- 
makers that we have. When they go into council, they have a right 
there to express their opinions, they have a perfect right to discuss 
matters, give their ideas, and finally come to a conclusion, and it 
becomes a law. But then it becomes our duty, as subject to that law, 
to obey, and not to ask the whys and wherefores. They have taken 
it into council, and have decided upon the law, and I feel that it is 
the duty of every one to obey such law and order after it has been 
established. 

With Latter-day Saints, I feel that it is more important even 
than with other citizens of this great nation of ours. It is true that 
in the beginning, while in the spirit world, there was a council held ; 
and you remember that God called the gods together. They met 
in council. No doubt they discussed matters pro and con, but finally 
they decided upon a plan of redemption. That plan was accepted 
by all who were there. No doubt we were there, according to the 
words of Job, because he gives us to understand' — or the Lord 
does, in speaking to him, when he puts this question to him, "Job, 
declare, if thou hast understanding, where wast thou when this earth 
was created, when the morning stars sang together, and all of the 
sons of God shouted for joy?" We were present in the spirit world. 
We gave a voice of utterance to the plan of redemption, and sanc- 
tioned it while in the spirit world. But that did not deprive the spirits 
of their agency. After that council had decided upon a plan, we 
find that one man arose and rebelled against that great body. Lu- 
cifer, the son of the morning, rebelled against that council. He did 
not see fit to be governed by law and order, and became a law unto 
himself ; and he had such great influence and power, even after that 
council had decided upon a plan, that he drew away a third of the 
hosts of heaven, and they followed himi, using their agency. We who 
were valiant had greater blessings pronounced upon us. The bless- 
ing was given to all who were valiant, and kept their first estate, that 
the time would come when they would have the privilege of coming 



ELDER JONATHAN C. CUTLER 



141 



here upon the earth and taking a body, whereby the spirit might be 
clothed. We had a clear understanding, no doubt, of our second 
estate, and we are here now as the Lord promised that we should be, 
all who were valiant in the spirit world. 

Now, I believe above all that the Latter-day Saints should be 
subject to law and order. I believe I am thoroughly converted to 
the fact that all Latter-day Saints, when the law goes forth, have not 
the privilege to ask the whys and wherefores, because when we do 
this, I am sure that we grieve the Spirit of the Lord, and it leaves us. 
We read in the Doctrine and Covenants, where the Lord says, That 
it mattereth not whether he speaks by his own voice, or the voire 
of his servants, it is binding upon the hearer. Amos gives us to 
understand that "Surely the Lord God will do nothing but that lie 
reveals his secrets unto his servants the prophets." God has never 
had a people that he acknowledged upon the earth, for whom he did not 
provide a mouthpiece to lead them. After God had visited the boy 
prophet, and after the organization of the Church, Joseph was ap-. 
oarently left to himself, and he led the people as a prophet of God. 
And we are still led by that same authority here today. So it matters 
not whether the Lord speaks direct, or whether he speaks as he al- 
ways has spoken, through his mouthpieces here on the earth ; and it 
pains me to see the disrespect for the authority of God here in the 
earth that we find is being manifest among the Latter-day Saints. 

1 feel that we are living in the time that the Apostle Paul saw, 
and many of the other apostles and prophets. We are living in the 
times that Daniel saw. We are living in the day that John the Rev- 
elator saw when he said, "I saw an angel flying through the midst of 
heaven," etc. We are living in that very day. The angel Moroni 
has come. He has delivered his message unto mankind, he has de- 
livered the record of the forefathers, the Nephites and the Laman- 
ites, and the work is established again here upon the earth with the 
promise that no other people have ever enjoyed, and that is this, 
that it shall never be taken from the earth nor given to another people. 
This is the knowledge that Latter-day Saints possess today, that this 
gospel which is here never will be given to another people — though we 
have no particular promise that you and I will remain faithful ; that 
depends upon our own works, our own acts, whether we remain firm 
and true or not. 

I am reminded of a prediction made by Heber C. Kimball. And 
1 remember quoting this at one time in Summit county when I was 
there on a Mutual mission, and at the close of the meeting an elderly 
man came to me, and he corroborated what I said, except that while 
I put it "half," he said, "You have made a mistake ; I heard him make 
the utterance, that the day would come that two-thirds of the Lat- 
ter-day Saints would apostatize and leave the Church." I got this 
from this witness, who heard him say so. 

I ponder over this at times, and I wonder what is going to be 



142 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



the outcome. It is true, we are naturally looking after self,' but when 
we take a broad view of the situation of life and the hereafter, we are 
only one royal family. While, of course, we desire to be saved, 
with our immediate kin and relatives — and that seems to be the nearest 
and dearest wish to us — I believe our ambition is stronger, and we 
are working harder to save our immediate family, which I feel is per- 
fectly right and well. I believe we are just a little bit too selfish 
along this line. I have often thought this that I would not be for- 
tunate if my family were saved or exalted and all of my neighbors 
and associates were not enjoying the same blessing that I enjoy. I 
accept life as a reality. I accept life after we leave here as a reality. 
I believe the way I am living here I will want to live after I leave 
here. I believe the company that I enjoy here I will want to enjoy 
after I leave here ; and for that reason the communities that I live 
in and the good people that I get acquainted with and want to asso- 
ciate with here, I believe I will want to associate with when I get 
-on the other side. And so I take a broad view of the situation, and 
the reality of life here and hereafter ; I have the same interest for my 
neighbor, for my fellow man that I have for myself. 

I feel, then, that we should mete out charity to one another. I 
feel that we should live here as we desire to live when we go on the 
other side. I have heard a great many people express themselves 
that when we get on the other side there will be an awful change, 
that the separation that we call death is going to bring about a won- 
derful change — habits that we have formed here, things that we have 
been accustomed to here will leave us, that we will not be bothered 
with these bodies when we leave here. This is not the doctrine taught 
by Alma, by any means. It is just the reverse. And I believe that as 
Ecclesiastes says, "As we lay the body down, so shall we take it up 
again." I believe that if we have formed an evil habit, that habit will 
stay with us until we overcome it. If it would not, there would be 
no justice; mercy would take the place of justice, which God says is 
not going to be — for mercy will claim its own, justice will demand its 
own — and if the change which we call death is going to make us per- 
fect, I see no use of the extra exertion to be what we should be here 
in the flesh. But I am converted to the fact that when we leave 
here we will find ourselves in the condition just where we left this 
life. 

For an illustration, I am going to tell of an instance that oc- 
curred while I was laboring in Summit county, to show to you that 
the appetites which we have here go with us, and we only get rid of 
them by sacrifice. And I am converted that it is easier to get rid of 
these things here than it is after we leave here. I called at the home 
of a good brother and his wife and family. In our discussion, I found 
he had been a strong, heavy tobacco user. He told me of his expe- 
rience in quitting this habit. He told me that his brother had died 
some two years before, and that he also was a heavy tobacco user. 



ELDER JONATHAN C. CUTLER 



143 



After he had been dead two or three months, he appeared to his 
brother and his brother's wife, at their bedside, and said, "John, get 
up and roll me a smoke." His brother obeyed and got up and rolled 
him a smoke and offered it to him, and he appeared to sit down on a 
chair, and his brother sat clown by the side of him; and he said, 
"You inhale it ;" and he obeyed. His brother held the third draw 
and he said, "That will do ; now I can leave the earth." 

This coincides with what Parley P. Pratt gives us in the Kev to 
Theology. Here was a man who had been dead two or three long 
months, and according to his own testimony, he had not been able to 
leave the earth and go to the spirit world, but had been hovering 
around the earth. Parley P. Pratt tells us in the Key to Theology 
that at the place where the evil deeds are committed, the spirits linger in 
wretched loneliness for months. Now, according to the statement of 
this good brother, which I could not deny after questioning him, his 
brother came to him. 1 tried to make him think that it was imaginary, 
but he turned to his good wife and said, "Mother, did we imagine 
that my brother came, or was it real ?" She said, "We were as wide 
awake as we are at the present time ; we walked to him and conversed 
with him, and on leaving us, he went into the other room and awoke 
our elder son and he talked with him." 

1 bring this up as an illustration, because I have heard some of 
our good old brethren and sisters, and some of our younger ones say, 
I will take the extra stripe, I will satisfy the appetite while I am 
here, and take my chances on the other side. Now, this good brother, 
who had formed that habit, after the visitation of his brother to him, 
said, "If this is the condition of my brother, who left with that ap- 
petite, I am going to make the sacrifice and quit." He bore his testi- 
mony to me that it had been two long years since he had touched 
tobacco. 

Now I want to say to you, my brethren and sisters, in all candor, 
that life is a reality here, and I believe as we live here we will 
live after we leave here. I believe if I do not want to associate 
with a man here, he would be very repulsive to me on the other side. 
If I could not make him a congenial companion here, I do not believe 
I would want to on the other side, until some differences had been 
adjusted. 

Do we find conditions of this kind in our neighborhood today? 
I believe we do. We find neighbors who will not speak to neighbors. 
We find enmity exists, even in the settlements, and in some cases, in 
the immediate homes of the Latter-day Saints. It is entirely wrong, 
and this should be eradicated from the heart of every Latter-day Saint. 

I want to leave my witness that this body of Latter-day Saint 
may know the gospel is true. T know that God lives. 1 
know that Joseph Smith was a prophet, raised up in these the 
last days to bring about God's purposes before the second coming 
of Christ here to reign in the earth. The living oracles are here, handed 
down from Presidents Young, Taylor, Woodruff, Snow, down to Pres-

ident Smith — and today Heber J. Grant stands as a mouthpiece to us, 
and I say, God bless him, bless his associates, his counselors and the 
apostles, and all of the presiding authorities; and I would exhort 
you, my brothers and sisters, to pray for them, sustain them, and up- 
hold them, and if we will do it, God will sustain and uphold us, but 
if we do not, I am afraid we will be left to ourselves, and we will 
apostatize and leave the Church, as was predicted by Brother Kim- 
ball. 

May the Lord bless you, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 
The Swanee Singers sang, "The boys of the old brigade.'' 



ELDER JOSEPH F. McGREGOR 

(President of the Beaver Stake of Zion) 

I have been very much impressed, my brethren and sisters, at 
this conference with the necessity of doing something, impressed with 
the fact that this gospel is a gospel of service, and that in order to 
get the blessings of eternal life, we have something to do upon our 
part other than merely assent to the divinity of the mission of Jesus 
Christ. 

I recall when in the east at one time — I think Brother Lyman 
was there at Ann Arbor — the Reverend E. Fay Mills held a protracted 
meeting there, and he showed us the necessity, in his way, of accept- 
ing Jesus Christ, and the results if we failed to do this while we were 
sojourning here in mortality ; and he told a little story about a young 
lady who had been in the choir and who had not confessed the Savior. 
After his meeting, she had taken suddenly ill with pneumonia, and 
died within a few days. In the hymn book she had used she had 
written, "Almost persuaded." He showed the terrible condition of 
that young lady — if she had just been a little more zealous, she would 
have been persuaded, and therefore would have received the bless- 
ings of eternal life — as it was, she would go to hell, and remain there 
in torment throughout the countless ages of eternity! 

Now we do not believe any such rubbish. We believe that what- 
ever we get, we get through obedience to the laws and commandments 
of the gospel. John the Revelator, saw the books opened, and an- 
other book, which was the book of life, and the dead were judged 
out of the things that were- written in the book, according to their 
works; and we believe that we will get just what we merit, and not 
go to just the one place or the other. 

You know the old darkey in the south was preaching, and he was 
telling the people that they would either go to hell fire or else damna- 
tion, when they died — either one place or the other; and one of the 
congregation said, "What is that you say?" 



ELDER JOSEPH F. McGREGOR 



145 



And he said, "Yes, that is right, you will go either one place or 
the other." 

Then the darkey in the congregation said, "Then this darkey will 
take to the woods." 

And many of us would have' to take to the woods, were it not 
for the provision that our heavenly Father has made for us that we 
will get what we earn and work for here, during this probation. 

I think one of the most beautiful sections in the Doctrine and 
Covenants is what is commonly termed the "Vision." You know 
the Lord showed Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery that there was 
more than one place, and made it clear to them that there were many 
mansions in the Father's kingdom, and that we would not all go to 
the same place. Prior to this time, of course, it was believed that 
there was no half-way house — we went either to heaven or to hell. 

I will not take your time to read this section — you are all more 
or less conversant with it — but you remember the great blessings that 
the Lord has in store for those who go to the celestial kingdom. Those 
are the ones who are faithful, who are valiant here in this life for the 
gospel and for the principles of truth that have been laid down for 
our guidance by the Savior of the world. 

Then we have another class, who were not so valiant, who got 
into the terrestrial kingdom. And I wish you to notice there that 
among them are those to whom the Savior went and preached in the 
spirit world, those to whom he went and unlocked the prison door, 
that they might accept the gospel. Why should not they get into 
the celestial kingdom ? Why should they be shut out, if they then 
would accept it, and do the works? They have had the privilege, v. 
brethren and sisters, of accepting the gospel here on earth. It had 
been preached to them, and they had refused to accept it in mortality ; 
and therefore they were not in a position to get all the blessings that 
the Lord has in store for his faithful children. 

You will recall that Alma, in preaching to the Zoramites, told 
them to repent and turn unto the Lord ere it be too late. And many 
have said, "Why has Alma spoken in this way?" Because we believe 
that there is a chance hereafter ; and talk about the night coming 
when no work can be done — we think we will do a great deal of work 
hereafter, and that those who have not accepted the gospel here in 
mortality will do so on the other side. But, mind you, Alma was 
speaking to those people, the Zoramites, who were apostates. They 
had once accepted the gospel and then rejected it, and therefore they 
could not then have the opportunity that they might have had if they 
had not heard the gospel. It would have been better for them if they 
never had heard it than to have heard it and rejected it here. 

And so we find that among those in the terrestrial kingdom are 
those to whom the Savior went, those people who had had the op- 
portunity here while they were in mortality of accepting the gospel, 
and rejected it ; and therefore they did not get a celestial glory, they 
were not valiant. There were some honest hearted people among 



146 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



them, but they had been blinded by the worldly things, and while 
they might accept the Savior as a divine being and as the Redeemer 
of the world, yet they had not with full purpose of heart accepted 
the gospel and done the works that the Savior required at their hands. 
Therefore they could not get the blessings. 

So it rests upon this point, my brethren and sisters, to be valiant, 
valiant in the cause of our heavenly Father. What are we to do in 
order to be valiant? Why, keep the commandments, not one or two 
or three, or any stated number, but all the commandments that our 
heavenly Father has given us. You know the erroneous idea that 
the young man was working under who came to the Savior and 
wanted to know what good thing he might do in order to obtain 
eternal life. He seemed to think that by doing one good, great thing, 
he would get all the blessings that our heavenly Father has in store 
for his faithful children ; but the Savior disillusioned his mind ; he 
explained to him that he should keep the commandments, and that 
it was not one. In fact he told the Jews, on one occasion, that they 
took tithes of mint and anise, and so on, but neglected the weightier 
matters of the law — the first they ought to do, but not to leave the 
other undone. 

We must keep all the commandments ; and so, today, I believe 
it is a splendid thing for us to take stock of ourselves and find out 
where we stand. If we are in business, we often take stock — we take 
stock each year — and find out our assets and liabilities, and just where 
we stand financially. Isn't it a good thing to take stock of ourselves 
religiously, and find out just where we stand? Are we keeping the 
commandments of our heavenly Father, so far as we know them? 
Do we pay our tithes and offerings honestly before the Lord, from 
month to month? If not, then let us wake up and do those things. 
Are we attending our sacrament meetings? Are we responding to 
the calls of those who are over us in authority and performing every 
labor and duty required at our hands? Are we keeping up our com- 
munications with the heavens ? Are we thanking the Lord, and not 
being guilty of the sin of ingratitude in not thanking him for his 
goodness to us from day to day— and asking for the things that we 
need? I do not think we all ask for just what we ought to have. In 
many instances, perhaps, we are praying for those things that would 
not be good for us, if we got them. Let us be careful not to ask the 
Lord for anything we ought not to have, and then when we do ask 
for his blessings and ask for things that will be beneficial for us to 
have, we can do it in sincerity, in faith, believing that he will hear 
and answer us. I believe that oftentimes we think the Lord ought 
to respond the moment we ask him ; and if he does not, we think that 
our prayers have not been answered and he has turned a deaf ear to 
us, and that there is no efficacy in prayer. 

It is a little, as I remember, like an incident that occurred some 
time ago. I had an uncle who was an apostate, and he was talking 
about this revelation on war. He said that Joseph Smith was a far- 



ELDER JOSEPH F. McGREGOR 



147 



sighted man, and of course, he could see what was coming, and that 
there was a clash coming between the north and the south. And I 
said, "Why was it that he could see that other nations would step 
in, even the nation of Great Britain, and that they would be asked 
for help by the south, and they would grant it?" 

He said, "That shows that he was wrong, because it says they 
would call upon other nations, and other nations upon others, until 
all nations of the earth should be involved — that was not fulfilled, 
and therefore it is like the old adage of the law 'false in one thing, 
false in all,' and therefore we can throw it all away." 

I did not know how to answer him then, but now we can answet 
him. We can see how Great Britain and other nations have been 
involved in war; and we have taken these things in too small a com- 
pass, and have not been broad enough to realize that the Lord often 
requires time to perform his work. 

It reminds me of a little story I have heard of a little boy who 
wanted a baby in the home, and finally he asked his father if he 
might pray for one. His father told him yes, he might, if he wished ; 
and so for some months, whenever he said his prayers at night, he 
would ask the Lord to send a baby to their home. But no baby came, 
and he got tired and he quit asking for one. Finally one morning 
when he came downstairs, the nurse took him into the bedroom, and 
there were twins ! He said, "Pa, it is a good thing I stopped pray- 
ing when I did." So, I think it is a splendid thing for us to exercise 
a little patience and he will hear our pleadings. I am sure that he 
will. But do not let us neglect any of the duties that are incumbent 
upon us. 

I am thankful to the Lord that he has made provision for his 
children, and that very, very few of them will be lost, that even in 
the telestial, the lowest degree of glory, where all the wicked people 
and those who fail to get the terrestrial or the celestial glory will go 
(except the sons of perdition), the joy is beyond our ability to under- 
stand, it is so great and glorious. Is not this a grand idea, to think 
the Lord has made such provision for his children? Is it not worth 
the effort, my brethren and sisters, to ask to obtain the blessings that 
he has prepared for his children here upon the earth. And yet we 
ought not to be satisfied with anything but the highest, because the 
terrestrial is so grand that the prophet says that he could not explain 
it to the people, it was so grand. We do not wish to be satisfied 
with that — we do not want to be left without our companions, our 
wives, or our children — we want to work for a higher degree of glory. 
We may not be able to become great jurists or great scientists — our 
mental capacity may prevent us from being such — but we can be true 
Latter-day Saints. We have the ability, each and all of us, to do that, 
and the Lord does not require anything- at our hands, save he pro- 
vides ways and means for us to perform the commandment that he 
has given us, as Nephi has told us. So that, if we try, he just judges 



148 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



us by the intents of our hearts, and not always by what we do. I am 
very thankful for that. 

When it comes to the sons of perdition — they are those who 
sinned, wilfully, knowingly, after having tasted the good word of 
God and had been partakers of the gifts and powers of the world 
to come, and then threw it all away, rejected the Savior, crucified 
him, put him to an open shame — they are, as the prophet has said, 
like men standing and seeing the sunshine and yet declaring it does 
not shine. They are those who wilfully and deliberately cast them- 
selves overboard on the sea of life. They alone will be lost, and 
thank the Lord they are very few. 

I pray the Lord to bless us, my brethren and sisters, and help us 
that we may work and see the necessity of work. You know when 
you go out into the world, very often people will open their Bibles 
to the passage in which Paul says, "For by grace are ye saved, through 
faith ; and that not of yourselves : it is the gift of God : not of works, 
lest any man should boast." 

And I was glad the other day to hear Brother Richards explain, 
that "God so loved the world that he gave his Only Begotten Son, 
that whosoever should believe in him, should not perish," etc., and 
then go on and explain that works as well are necessary, that we 
have something to do on our part. 

When we hear the teachings of this conference, let us not be 
like the man who built his house on the sand, but like the man who 
built his house upon the rock. Let us be doers of the word, and not 
hearers only. In order that we may get the blessings, we must do 
the works, and if we do, we are as sure of our pay as anyone can be. 

I think it was Cardinal Wolsey who, at his death, had been de- 
prived by the king of all his emoluments, and who said: 

Had I but served my God with half the zeal I served my king, he 
would not, in mine age, have left me naked to mine enemies. 

If we will keep the commandments of the Lord, we can be sure 
that we will get our reward. God help us all to do it, I ask, in the 
name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER NELSON D. HOGAN 

(President of the Idaho Stake of Zion) 

My brethren and sisters: I can say that I have been delighted 
with the splendid counsel that we have received at this and all the 
sessions of this conference ; and if we can take some of the things 
home that we learn here, and put them into practice in our every 
day life, we will get something out of coming to conference ; but, on 
the other hand, if we go home and pay no more attention to what we 
have heard here, and do not put it into our lives, I do not think we 
will get very much good out of it. So, I trust, my brethren and sis- 
ters, that what we have heard in the different sessions of this confer- 



ELDER NELSON D. HOGAN 



149 



ence, we will try to take home and practice so that we will be bene- 
fited by meeting together. 

I believe, my brethren and sisters, that we will get everything 
we earn. If we are faithful in keeping the commandments of the 
Lord and that which he asks us to do, we will get the blessings for 
these things ; and, on the other hand, if we are neglectful and careless 
and indifferent, and do not the things that the Lord has required of 
us, we cannot expect to get something for nothing. I often think of 
it this way, that if we start to work for a man, we generally know 
what we are to get out of it. We know just about what the wages 
will be, and if. we are faithful in performing our duty, we will get 
a full pay. On the other hand, if we are careless, indifferent, lie 
around part of the time, when we come to get our pay, we will only 
get a part pay, and that is all we will ask for. I believe it is the 
same with the gospel. We know what we will get out of it, if we 
are faithful. 

So, it is up to us to be faithful and try to do everything we can 
for the cause and for ourselves. This is an individual work. I can 
not work out your salvation, nor can you work out mine ; we have 
each to work out our own, and work together and in harmony one 
with another. And if we can do this, our reward will be great. 

I was very much surprised when I was called to take a part in 
this meeting, thinking perhaps they had made a mistake in calling 
upon me to come here to talk to the people; but if I should relate 
some of the circumstances in my life, you would say I should have no 
reason to stand back. I was reared in the Church, but I am sorry 
to say that quite a lot of my life I did not improve the opportunities 
as I should have done. Still, I have acted as a bishop for fourteen 
years, and obtained some experiences out of this work. I have acted 
in the capacity of a stake president for three or four years. I am 
thankful, my brethren and sisters, that I have been counted worthy 
of these responsible positions, and I trust that I may live worthy, so 
that I can claim the blessings in store for the faithful. 

I ask the Lord to bless us, and cause that the things that we 
have heard at this splendid conference, will be taken home and in- 
corporated into the practices of our lives; they will then be of bene- 
fit to us. I ask the Lord to help us, that we may continue faithful to 
the end ; and I ask it in the name of Jesus. Amen.

ELDER THOMAS D. REESE 

(President of the Juab Stake of Zion) 

I have been delighted with the spirit of the conference. It has 
thrilled me with the idea that our people are up-to-date in meeting 



150 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



the issues that stand before us. I have been impressed with the 
spirit that we, as a people, should be careful in our utterances, that 
we should use discretion and judgment in these days of feverish po- 
litical excitement, and not stand at our back fence and quarrel with 
our neighbor over some things that probably little concern us. I 
have seen neighbors sometimes disputing and quarreling over men 
whom' they will never see on this earth, save it be in the magazines, 
whose hand they will never clasp, and yet their brother across the 
fence, by some untimely misjudged statement, they offend, and there 
will be then in their hearts anger and sadness, and the Spirit of the 
Lord will not find free place in which to thrive. 

In our stake, when I see men that become excited over politics, 
I have said that they are like some patients that I have had — when 
the fever gets to 105, I look for them, to be delirious, and I pull out 
my thermometer and test their temperature. When it is 105 they 
ofttimes say things that they do not know that they are saying. So 
when I meet a brother who is radical and talking upon the street 
too loud, I reach for my thermometer, and if his political temperature 
is 105, I say, "Brother, you are delirious, you ought to go home for 
fear that somebody else will catch the contagion." 

I was very much impressed with the remarks of Brother Lyman 
this morning, when he spoke of the tobacco question. He said that 
as a people we should hold out our hands and stay the evil, or any 
ether evils that may be in our midst. I have thought of this very 
much in collection with a lesson that I learned in life when I was i 
young man attending college in the east. 

In one of the big cities I had the privilege of studying in the 
anatomy room of the university with a great number of other stu- 
dents of the subject, and I was working along, doing some of the ex- 
tra work to earn a little money to remain at colleg'e, and I had the 
duty of going down to the morgue and there looking over the bodies 
that were unclaimed, that no one knew, and from those unclaimed 
bodies the state in that section gave the college the permission to take 
for scientific investigation or into the anatomy room. 

On one occasion, I stood there as the police force brought into 
the morgue a beautiful girl, seemingly, to look at her, and one of the 
men said, "This lady is a graduate from the slum, and we found her 
lifeless in the gutter." 

That so impressed me that I became immediately interested in 
that lady, and- letters were sent out all over the country, asking peo- 
plue to come and identify her, and it was not long before the ad- 
vertisements from papers were being answered and letters were being 
answered from different police headquarters, asking about that young- 
lady, and many a mother and many a father, and many a brother 
walked through that morgue to see if it were their daughter or sister, 
and O the expressions of sadness ! 

On one occasion there came an old lady, tottering upon her cane, 
and she was repeating as she came in the door, "Little Mary, I have 



ELDER THOMAS D. REESE 151 

l 

found you; little Mary, I have found you." Some of. the men es- 
corted her up to the casket, but as she looked upon it she said, "No, 
no, not my little Mary— but somebody else's little Mary." 

The words so impressed me that I thought, would it not have 
been right if some hand could have reached out and prevented this 
girl from destroying that beautiful body — because there was every 
mark upon it of dissipation, her arms had been pitted where she had 
used some of the vile and serious drugs that some people get in the 
habit of using. And I thought to myself, what right did that girl 
have to cause probably the sorrow that she must have caused some- 
where to some home? And I thought of the words of the old lady, 
"Somebody's little Mary." There must have been hundreds of little 
Marys who had wandered away from their homes and forgotten to 
write back to father and mother, and caused them, sorrow 'and 
anguish ; had destroyed the body that they had received and that 
should have given to this earth again bodies. 

And why are we so anxious to say to the boy, we are going to 
stop you from using tobacco, stop you from destroying your body? 
That is one of our missions, because, boy, your soul is greater, far 
greater, probably, than you understand. As Latter-day Saints, we 
understand that our boys and girls, who stand by our sides are our 
greatest wealth in this world and in the eternities. They will stand 
in the presence of God with us, as the riches above all riches that 
can be thought of in this earth, because we expect from that boy and 
girl that they will join in the perfection of godliness, and we expect, 
if they reach the perfection that the Savior spoke about, that they can 
in time stand out in the universe and create worlds like the one that 
we stand upon, with all the mountains and the valleys and the seas 
and the wealth that are in them. We hold that our boys' and our girls' 
souls are greater than the combined wealth of the world, if we can 
save them in godliness to our Father in heaven ; and therefore we 
have a right to stay anything that will destroy their bodies, or lead 
them away from this, the work of the Lor-d. 

And may God bless us, that we will understand this duty toward 
our boys and our girls and our neighbors, and that vile thoughts 
and anger and bitterness will not be a part of our lives, I aslc in the 
name of Jesus Christ. Amen. .

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



I think that you can perhaps sympathize with me, because I 
had no more idea of this than you have that you will be next. 

I have enjoyed the remarks of the brethren, in the meeting, and 
I have been thinking how Zion is growing. We attempted to go to 
the tabernacle, at half-past one, and were told that the seats were all 
taken, so that presidents of stakes were being turned away thai, 
early. And if that is the case, at half-past one, it appears that we 
may have to arrange after a while so that only the presidents of 
stakes shall come to the conference, because, as 1 understand it, they 
ought to be there in order to get the instructions, to give to their 
congregations in the various stakes of Zion. I remember when my 
father, who was a cripple, came to conference, that he always re- 
mained in the tabernacle, in a good seat, during the noon hour, going 
without his dinner, for fear that he could not get back to listen to 
the instructions of the brethren ; but in those days I am certain they 
did not have overflow meetings in the Assembly Hall and Bureau of 
Information building. 

Another thing I have been impressed with, too, as a difference 
between those days and these. As I remember it, in the days of 
President Young, he said that they had only one honest doctor in 
the Church, and that was Dr. Riggs, of Provo, and he did not know 
enough to kill a man. You have listened to two of the doctors this 
afternoon. It seems that they have learned how not to kill people, 
but how to save them. President McGregor and President Reese, to 
whom you have listened in this meeting this afternoon, are both prac- 
ticing physicians, both reputable men of the community, and both 
presidents of stakes — so you can see that Zion is growing. In those 
days I do not know what would have been said if they had made a 
doctor a president of a stake. 

Not only that, but it is not long since that we had one of our 
most prominent presidents of stakes die, who was a member of that 
other despised class, the lawyers, President Richard W. Young; and 
in the early days they looked upon the lawyers as even worse than 
the doctors. [Elder Lyman said : "He happens to be a lawyer him- 
self."] . It seems that either the doctors and the lawyers must be 
getting better, or else the people are getting more liberal in their 
attitude toward some of these things. . 

But I have been taught all my life, however, that the gospel 
which we believe in embraces the whole truth of the universe ; and 
if there is anything virtuous, or lovely, or of good report, or praise- 
worthy, our Articles of Faith say, we seek after these things ; so that 
it is the cry of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints that 
we shall go onward and upward until we become perfected, even as 
our Father in heaven is perfect. Amen. 

The Swanee Singers sang, "Sextette from Lucia." 



ELDER RICHARD R. LYMAN 



153 



ELDER RICHARD R. LYMAN 

As some others have already said, it is gratifying to see what 
progress we are making. Latter-day Saints are not satisfied with 
preaching and hearing sermons, or with praying and hearing prayers. 
These do not bring salvation. 

PEOPLE ARE TO BE JUDGED BY THEIR WORKS 

Those who are merciful, charitable, industrious, studious, those 
who are struggling to overcome shortcomings, weaknesses and im- 
perfections, are those who are really Saints. These are they who 
are truly Christians. In these important respects, we are getting bet- 
ter all the time. 

I was gratified with the keynote speech sounded by President 
Heber J. Grant in the first part of our conference session, in which 
he instructed us to keep the commandments. He repeated a portion 
of a poem: 

And in self-judgment, if you find 

Your deeds to others are superior; 
To you has Providence been kind, 

As you should be to those inferior; 
Example sheds a genial ray 

Of light, which men are apt to borrow; 
So first improve yourself today, 

And then improve your friends tomorrow. 

Such sentiments are a part of the genuine gospel of Jesus Christ. 
Those who live such teachings are really Saints. 

This quotation, as President Grant explained, was from a poem 
that was sung to him by Francis M. Lyman about forty years ago. 

As his son, let me say to you that I have known no other human 
being who lived more strictly in accord with what he himself thought 
to be right than did Francis M. Lyman. He has been called by many 
the great teacher of the Church. No one ever saw him or heard 
him teach a lesson in accordance with which he himself did not 
live. He never asked another to do more than he himself was doing. 

■ 

FAVORITE HYMN OF THE LATE PRESIDENT FRANCIS M. LYMAN 

President Penrose, in his opening remarks, quoted from one of 
his own hymns — the favorite hymn of the late President Francis 
M. Lyman. I am going to read all of it : 

School thy feelings, O my brother, 

Train thy warm, impulsive soul; 
Do not its emotions smother, 

But let wisdom's voice control. 

School thy feelings, there is power 
In the cool, collected mind; 



154 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Passion shatters reason's tower, 
Makes the clearest vision blind. 

School thy feelings; condemnation 
Never pass on friend or foe, 

Though the tide of accusation 
Like a flood of truth may flow. 

Hear defense before deciding, 
And a ray of light may gleam, 

Showing thee what filth is hiding 
Underneath the shallow stream. 



Should affliction's acrid vial 

Burst o'er thy unsheltered head, 

Shool thy feelings to the trial, 
Half its bitterness hath fled. 

Art thou falsely, basely slandered? 

Does the world begin to frown? 
Gauge thy wrath by wisdom's standard, 

Keep thy rising anger down. 

Rest thyself on this assurance: 
Time's a friend to innocence, 

And the patient, calm endurance 
Wins respect and aids defense. 

Noblest minds have finest feelings 
Quiv'ring strings a breath can move, 

And the gospel's sweet revealings, 
Tune them with the key of love. 

Hearts so sensitively moulded, 
Strongly fortified should be, 

Trained to firmness and enfolded 
In a calm tranquility. 

Wound not wilfully another; 

Conquer haste with reason's might; 
School thy feelings, sister, brother, 

Train them in the path of right. 



The intense feelings of some who are engaged in the present 
political campaign, I think, prompted the words of President Heber 
J. Grant on the subject of charity. Every word in this hymn applies 
to that same subject, and' to the more or less serious general condi- 
tion now existing. 

Ours is the gospel of Jesus Christ. It has been revealed — the 
heavens were opened more than a hundred years ago — and we ought 
to put forth our best efforts to live as the Savior himself lived, thus 
overcoming our shortcomings. 

THE HOME THE BEST MEASURE OF RELIGION 

We are measured best with respect to our religion in our own 



ELDER RICHARD R. LYMAN 



155 



homes. Are we kind? Are we generous? Are we thoughtful? Are 
we loving ? Or are we unfair, are we unkind, are we dishonest ? 

It is so easy to retaliate, it is so easy to exhibit temper, it is so 
easy to speak harshly, it is so satisfying, momentarily, to get revenge. 
On these points we have one glorious, one divine example. The 
great Master himself was persecuted, he himself was hated, this Di- 
vine One was crucified. During the agony of his crucifixion came 
that matchless, that divine example. In that moment of greatest dis- 
tress, in the anguish of his broken heart, and just before his spirit 
fled, he crowned his perfect life with a perfect crowh, when he ex- 
claimed, "O, Father, forgive them," I beg of thee, "for they know not 
what they do." 

That is the spirit of the gospel of Jesus Christ. That is the 
lesson we are trying to teach in this great conference. May this 
spirit go into every quarter of the Church, that we may be made hap- 
pier and better, I humbly pray, through Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The singers and congregation sang, "High on the mountain top." 
Benediction was pronounced by Elder David R. Lyon of the En- 
sign Ward and Stake of Zion. 



CLOSING SESSION 

Conference was called to order in the Tabernacle, at 2 o'clock by 
President Hbber J. Grant who presided. 

The choir sang, "God is my refuge and strength." 

Prayer was offered by Elder Wm. H. Richards, President of the 
Malad Stake of Zion. 

Wm. Worley sang a solo entitled, "If with all your hearts you 
truly seek me." 



PRESIDENT KEBER J. GRANT 

I am inclined to think that we will have to arrange, in the future, 
to have four days for conference. It seems that we can't get through 
in three days. 

A LETTER FROM ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH 

I have a letter from the absent member of the Council of the 
Twelve, Brother George Albert Smith. I would like to read it all. 
to you — some four or five pages — but I shall read only a very few 
words : 

Owen Woodruff is making good. He is a splendid man, and I hope 



156 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



to give him every opportunity and encouragement that lies within my 
power. 

Owen Woodruff is a grandson of President Wilford Woodruff, 
and the son of the late Elder Abram O. Woodruff, of the Council 
of the Twelve : 

President Angus J. Cannon is doing a wonderful work, and in my 
judgment ought not to be released until next spring, unless you have 
somebody to take his place who is thoroughly familiar with conditions 
in Switzerland and Germany. President Cannon has endeared himself 
to the members* of the Church all over. He loves them and they love 
him, and his heart is in the work. But for his mother and son I am sure 
he would be pleased to remain here indefinitely. His wife is doing a noble 
work, she stands by him and does her best all the timie. I visited, as far as 
my time would permit, the various conferences of Switzerland and Ger- 
many. President Cannon has nine men working full time in Switzerland, 
and thirty-eight giving full time in Germany, in addition to the five elders 
who have come from Utah. These men are all expecting to perform 
missions of two years or more. Many of them are traveling without purse 
or scrip and it is a real joy to see the faith that they manifest and to 
hear how the Lord blesses them. 

We held a meeting with the German missionaries at Leipzic. There 
were thirty-three present. As neat and fine a class of missionaries as 
I have ever seen. I was sorry to be compelled to leave them„ We held 
conferences in different parts of Germany, the largest being at Chem- 
nitz where more than seven hundred people assembled. We had a joy- 
ful time. * * * 

From present indications the Swiss and German mission will be the 
big end of the European mission, so that in selecting a successor for 
President Cannon, I hope you will choose a strong man who understands 
the people and can do the work. 

I wrote Brother Smith that we had chosen just that kind of 
a man; no better; and I believe you can all testify to that fact, after 
hearing Brother Ballif here today : 

The New Home in Basel is all that could be desired. It is a com- 
modious place that will be a credit to the Church, and there is plenty of 
room to build a chapel sufficiently large to take care of all our people 
who assemble there. I feel to compliment President Cannon on the pur- 
chase that he has made.

ELDER HYRUM G. SMITH 

(Presiding Patriarch of the Church) 

I think I am duly sensitive of the position to which I have been 
called, and I am very grateful indeed that the Lord permitted me to 
come into this sphere of action, through that wonderful and blessed 
lineage spoken of here this morning by the president of the Church. 
It has been made known to us that we are direct descendants of that

blessed in all the land, which has been given him by blessing through 
the patriarch that was blest of the Lord to have such a noble son. 

"There is a law, irrevocably decreed in heaven before the founda- 
tions of this world, upon which all blessings are predicated ; and when 
we obtain any blessing from God, it is by obedience to that law upon 
which it is predicated." During this conference we have been ad- 
monished to keep the commandments of the Lord. Therefore, we 
must first learn them, and from this quotation which I have just read 
we learn that we must obey the law upon which our blessings are 
predicated, if we get our blessings. 

While my brethren have been speaking to you in plainness, and 
inspired of the Lord, my heart has burned with enthusiasm and with 
that testimony which has been born in me of the truth of the work 
and of the importance of it ; and oh, how I have wondered why we 
are not more faithful. But then the thought comes, well, we are just 
mortals. We are weak, and wonderfully weak sometimes. We need 
the encouragement of one another. We need the support of one another 
as brothers and sisters in very deed. We need the prayers of on an- 
other. And when I see my brethren stand up in public and pray for 
the president of the Church and his counselors and the members ot 
the Twelve Apostles and then all the rest of the brethren who are 
called to hold positions of responsibility in the Church, I always come 
in for my share of the blessings because I need it. And therefore T 
would like to admonish my brethren and sisters to think of one an- 
other when we pray in our homes, think of those who need the bless- 
ings of the Lord. And I testify that the prayers of the Saints do 
prevail for g - ood. I think we have a wonderful testimony in this 
direction, in the sustaining blessings that have come to those who 
have spoken in this conference. Everyone has spoken under the in- 
fluence and power of the Holy Spirit in answer to the prayers of 
the Saints ; those who have gathered here in this great conference and 
the many hundreds, who are unable .to meet with us, many of them 
scattered throughout the nations of the world, who know of this oc- 
casion and are earnestly praying that the blessings of the Lord be 
upon this -conference "and upon those who are called to direct and 
preside in Israel. 

I testify unto my brethren and sisters, that the Lord lives, that 
he is blessing the land for our benefit. I have gone through many 
stakes of Zion during the past summer. I have seen the products of 
the earth in bounteous harvests in all the land that I have visited ; 
and oh, I do pray that the Saints will remember the Lord, in their 
harvests, for he has abundantly blest them. Water has been secured 
in the many wonderful canals and rivers that thread this country, the 
land has been blest, the homes of the peoples have been blest. We 
have been wonderfully provided for, and through all the stress of the 
high cost of living, none of us are particularly suffering. We can 
turn to the Lord and thank him abundantly, and as a humble servant, 
of the Lord, I do petition him in your behalf (and with you I wish 



158 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



to be numbered) to give unto you faith to acknowledge his hand in 
your blessings, temporally and spiritually, and faith to remember 
him in your tithes and offerings, and when you humble yourselves 
in prayer around the family altar, remember those whom the Lord 
has called to hold positions of responsibility, each and all in their 
callings, as they may labor either at home or abroad. And oh, 
brethren and sisters, let us not be compelled to keep the command- 
ments of the Lord. Let us love the Lord in such a way that we may 
not have to be compelled by the governments, either local or general, 
to keep our Father's biddings. Shame on us, if we have to be com- 
pelled. For then we are looked upon as slothful in very deed. 

I bless you, my brethren and sisters, in the name of the Lord 
Jesus, that through your faithfulness and obedience to the laws and 
commandments of the Lord you may not be looked upon as slothful, 
nor forgetful of your privileges, your blessings, or your birthrights, 
but that you may acknowledge the hand of God, and learn and love 
to live and keep his commandments in your homes, and in your labors, 
whether directly or indirectly, in his service. I bless you, my breth- 
ren and sisters, that you may have strength of memory sufficient to 
take home with you the spirit and teaching of this conference, and 
that you may not be forgetful of the kernels of truth and light, and 
that you may not be so burdened with the numerous teachings that 
you will lose sight of the important things, but remember them and 
put them into practice, and teach them to the many hundreds of our 
number who are not able to attend this conference. 

I bless you, my brethren and sisters, that you may be Saints in 
very deed, through your faithfulness and your devotion to the teach- 
ings which have been given in this conference, and may God be ever 
honored and glorified for his manifold mercies unto us as his chil- 
dren, I pray, through Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER JAMES N. LAMBERT 

(Recently Returned President of the Nlew Zealand Mission) 

I am indeed surprised, my brethren and sisters, to be called to 
occupy this position, but, nevertheless, I feel honored ;' and I trust 
that the few remarks I may make on this occasion may be dictated by 
the Spirit of the Lord. 

As stated by President Grant, I have ju"st returned from a mission 
to New Zealand, where for upwards of four years I presided over 
the work of the Lord. I am happy indeed to report that the New 
Zealand mission is progressing, that the Lord is at the helm, that he 
has sustained us in our efforts to preach the gospel to the people liv- 
ing on' those islands. We have had considerable trouble in securing 
missionaries to go there to preach the gospel, but through the prayers 
of the Saints and the efforts that have been put forth, a way has 



ELDER JAMES N. LAMBERT 



159 



been opened up for us to continue our work there. The people arc- 
anxious to hear the gospel, the natives particularly who take to it 
very readily, and I believe the reason is because of the blood of 
Israel that is in their veins. It was my privilege and blessing, acting 
under instruction from President Grant and his counselors, to bring 
a company of Maori Saints to the Hawaiian Islands to perform labors 
in the temple. While there it was demonstrated beyond any question 
of doubt that the people who now inhabit the New Zealand islands, 
and are known as Maoris, were at one time connected with the peo- 
ple living on the Hawaiian islands, known as Kanakas, or natives of 
that place. For a great number of years efforts have been put forth 
by people who have written the history of the New Zealand people to 
connect them in some way with the people who have come from the 
West; and when the statement has been put forth by a "Mormon" 
elder, that the Maoris at one time came from., the north, or particu- 
larly from the Hawaiian Islands, they, have been laughed to scorn. 
When directing this company to the Hawaiian Islands, in connecting 
up their genealogy, sixty-five generations back, with the genealogy 
of the Hawaiian people, it has been demonstrated clearly that they 
are one and the same people, or were at one time. 

It was my good fortune to witness a great number of the leading 
men of Honolulu, both whites and Hawaiians, who joined together in 
honoring the Maori people who had come there and who had dem- 
onstrated that they were connected with the Hawaiians. Never in 
my life have I seen people who were more anxious to show honor 
to native people than "the people of Honolulu were on that occasion. 
Something like three thousand or more gathered at the armory hall 
and, as President Woolley remarked to me, it would have done Presi- 
dent Smith's heart good indeed to have seen such an outpouring, such 
a desire on the part of the leading men there, to welcome our Maori 
Saints, as well as the Hawaiian Saints, because it was left to the 
Hawaiian Saints, not to the Hawaiian people generally, but to the 
Hawaiian Saints, to acknowledge that the connection that was made 
on that occasion was true. 

I rejoice, my brethren and sisters, for the privilege that has come 
to me in going to New Zealand to preside over that mission. I bring 
back to you, the parents, the fathers and the mothers of the elders 
who are laboring there, their best wishes. They are happy, they 
are contented in their work, they are desirous of spreading the gospei, 
of being equal in every way to the demand that is made upon them 
as representatives of the Lord Jesus Christ. They are doing a good 
work. The additions that are made, from year to year, show that 
our Church in that land is in a healthy condition. We are not dying 
out but on the other hand the principles of the gospel that we have 
taught the natives ever since the Church has been opened up in that 
land, ever since the gospel has been preached to that people, has 
demonstrated that we are preaching a gospel of temperance, a gospel 
that is doing them good, a gospel that is being felt, not only by the 



160 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



people who are obeying it, but by the people who represent the gov- 
ernment. Doctor Pomare, a prominent native, a man who has spent 
years in this land and was educated here and in Germany, stated in 
Parliament, a short time ago, that in all his visits in the various 
parts of New Zealand he had never seen a place that would compare 
with Nuhaka, a place that is composed of ninety-eight per cent "Mor 
mons," and when questioned further as to why it appealed to him, he 
said it was because of the cleanliness of the Latter-day Saints, be- 
cause of their teaching, sobriety, temperance, because of their teach- 
ing the people to be industrious and to attend to their own business. 
The members of Parliament were astounded. He was questioned 
over and over again in regard to it, and yet he claimed that it was the 
truth in every way, as he had demonstrated it while he was an officer 
in the health department, later when he was a representative in Par- 
liament, and then as a member of the Prime Minister's cabinet. 

I pray, my brethren and sisters, that the Lord will ever make 
us appreciative, make other people appreciate us, and that our light 
may shine before all people, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

Elder James H. Nielson and quartette sang, "Oh, give me back 
my prophet dear." 



ELDER SEYMOUR B. YOUNG 

(Senior President of the First CounciKof Seventy) 

I have great pleasure, my brothers and sisters, in standing before 
you this afternoon, to lift up my voice in testimony of the goodness 
of the Lord unto me and to my brethren and sisters of this great 
organization of which we form a part. The spirit of this conference 
has been one of divine acceptance, I believe to every Latter-day Saint. 
The Spirit of the Lord has been with our brethren, our leaders in all 
they have said and done during the sessions of this great conference. 

I had recently the pleasure of visiting Independence, Mo., the 
headquarters of our Central States mission. President Bennion had 
already started for the west to be present at this gathering. I had 
the pleasure of visiting at his home, at the mission headquarters, 
where I was royally entertained by the young missionaries, brethren 
and sisters who have charge of the home. I also visited further 
afield, out into the state in a northeast direction from Independence, 
one hundred miles away to the scene of the Haun's Mill Massacre, 
which occurred on the 28th of September, 1838, according to the 
records of the state and county. In visiting this sacred' spot, I tried 
to realize the sorrows of those who were at that time subject to the 
evil powers by which they were surrounded. Just a few weeks pre- 
vious to this terrible event, a little band of Latter-day Saints, my 
father and mother among them, twenty-five families in all, had left 
the town of Kirtland, wending their way across the state of Missouri 



ELDER SEYMOUR B. YOUNG 161 

and had stopped by the way-side to recuperate and earn some pro- 
visions at a mill kept by Mr. Haun. This little band of devoted 
Saints were attacked on the evening of the day above mentioned by 
a mob of two hundred men armed with guns and eighteen of the 
brethren were shot and killed, and several others! were seriously 
wounded. I am reciting this to recall to you this great fact : the de- 
votion of that little band of emigrants that were on their way west- 
ward to find a home. 

The Prophet Joseph Smith, with five of his brethren were at this 
time imprisoned in a dungeon in Liberty jail, subjected to the in- 
sults and abuse of an unrelenting guard during their term of con- 
finement in the Liberty jail. The old cell in which they were con- 
fined is still standing near the center of the town of Liberty, and 
that is the only remains of the old jail. 

After the massacre of the brethren, and on the following day, 
my father and four others that were left alive gathered up these 
bodies and placed them, by consent of Mr. Haun, in the circle of an 
old dry well which they prepared by enlarging the circle sufficiently 
to receive the bodies of the sixteen brethren and the one little boy, 
Sardius Smith, and there they were tenderly laid, and covered with 
mother earth ; and today this is their mausoleum. I recite this to 
show the faith of that devoted company of Latter-day Saints. The 
brethren left alive gathered up the families that had been bereaved, 
including the wounded and the widows and orphans, and helped them 
on their journey across the state till they reached the Mississippi 
river. After crossing the river they landed in the town of Quincy, 
where they were kindly received during their short stay in that city. 
In relating this incident, I am reminded of the early Christians who 
were compelled to enter the colliseum to make a spectacle for those 
more savage than the beasts, these were no doubt entreated to give 
up their faith and thus save their lives, but kneeling in the center 
of the arena they prayed and sang until they were devoured. How 
helpless they seemed, and, measured by every human rule, how hope- 
less was their cause; and yet within a few decades the power which 
they invoked proved mightier than the legions of the emperor. Like 
history might be recorded concerning the Latter-day Saints. From 
the imprisonment of the prophet in Liberty jail, from the horrible 
and cruel massacre at Haun's Mill, from the martyrdom at Carthage 
jail, the faith of the Latter-day Saints and power with God has in- 
creased. The faith of the Latter-day Saints induced them to continue 
their journey to these mountain valleys where they were led by an 
inspired prophet who succeeded the martyr, Joseph Smith, as their 
leader. Those composing this great gathering, at this conference, 
are an evidence that they were led by the inspiration of Almighty 
God to these mountain valleys. 

I rejoice because I can say at this time, as Nephi said of old : 
"I was born of goodly parents," and the faith of my father and 
mother has always been an encouragement to their children. I re- 

6 



162 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

i 

joice today that this gospel came to them in the early part of their 
lives, and that they were among the pioneers of this great work. 
Though witnessing the terrible scenes of slaughter in the very be- 
gining of their Church experience, they never turned from the faith, 
but deep down in their hearts cherished a love for the principles ad- 
vocated by the Prophet Joseph Smith. Today this gathering is a 
credit to the Latter-day Saints, and in the remarks that have been 
made by our leaders, the Prophet Joseph Smith is recognized as the 
leader of the dispensation of the fulness of times, the prophet of God 
in very deed. lie was faithful and true even unto death, and those 
who have followed him in his ministry, in the presidency of the 
Church, have exemplified to the world, to all the people who have 
listened to the gospel sound, that they, too, have been inspired with 
the divine mission of the Prophet Joseph Smith. 

After seventy years of experience in the Church, as a Church 
members, and as a laborer in this great work, responding to every call, 
I testify today that I know that God lives, that Jesus is the Christ, 
the Savior of the world, that Joseph Smith was indeed God's prophet 
inspired to bring before the world these great truths, and to plant the 
gospel again upon the earth, and to say to the world, God has again 
spoken from the heavens. 

May the spirit of this conference go with us to our homes, and 
continue with you brethren and sisters who are visitors, and with you 
presiding brethren, to every stake and ward in Zion, that all may be 
blessed with the spirit and teachings that we have received from the 
presiding brethren of the Church, that the Saints may continue to 
grow and increase in the knowledge of the truth, till they shall arise 
to a perfect knowledge, is my humble prayer through Jesus Christ, 
our Lord. Amen. 



ELDER BRIGHAM H. ROBERTS 

(Of the First Council of Seventy) 

I have been impressed, as doubtless you all have been, with the 
large appeal that has been made during this conference to the written 
scriptures. This large use of them is a testimony of their value, and 
certainly justifies the eulogy pronounced upon them by the Apostle 
Paul who said that "all scripture is given by inspiration of God, and 
is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction 
in righteousness, that the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly 
furnished unto all good work." 

I do not feel adequate to undertake the formulation of my own 
thoughts that have been inspired by my attendance upon this con- 
ference, and so I, also, will appeal to the written word to assist m- 
in discharging the duty I have to perform on this occasion. I think, 



ELDER BRIGHAM H. ROBERTS 



163 



however, that my appeal to the scriptures may be a little different 
from other appeals that have been made. Someone has said that 
when we read the scriptures God speaks to us; and when we pray, 
we speak to the Lord. So in a sense I give way, for the brief time 
that I am to occupy, in order to permit the Lord to deliver a message 
to you, a message of comfort, a message that should bring great en- 
couragement to the Latter-day Saints. And first a testimony of the 
majesty and glory of God, and then his message : 

"Hear, O ye heavens, and give ear, O earth, and rejoice ye in- 
habitants thereof; for the Lord is God, and beside him there is no 
Savior. Great is his wisdom, marvelous his ways, and the extent of 
his doings none can find out. His purposes fail not; neither are 
there any who can stay his hand. From eternity to eternity he is the 
same, and his years never fail." 

At this point I recall a sweet message in a rather popular hymn, 
namely: 

Change and decay in all around I see, 

Oh, thou who changeth not, abide with me. 

And now for the message: 

Thus saith the Lord: I the Lord am merciful and gracious unto those 
who fear me, and delight to honor those who serve me in righteousness 
and in truth to the end. Great shall be their reward and eternal shall 
be their glory, and to them I will reveal all mysteries, yea, all the hidden 
mysteries of my kingdom from days of old, and for ages to come will 
I make known unto them the good pleasure of my will concerning all 
things pertaining to my kingdom. Yea, even the wonders of eternity 
shall they know, and things to come will I show them, even the things 
of many generations, and their wisdom shall be great and their under- 
standing reach to heaven. And before them the wisdom of the wise shall 
perish and the understanding of the prudent shall come to naught. For 
by my spirit will I enlighten them, by my power will I make known unto 
them the secrets of my will, yea, even those things which eye hath not 
seen nor ear heard, nor yet entered into the heart of man." (Doc. and 
Cov. Sec. 76.) 

Such is the message of the Lord, such his word of encourage- 
ment and uplifting power to you. 

Now, I think perhaps we have time to speak a word to the 
Lord, and in speaking that word to him by use of the scripture, Jesus 
the Christ may be our mouthpiece. I pray you make what we now 
do an act of worship and prayer unto God : 

"Our Father which art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy 
kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.. Give 
us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our debts as we forgive 
our debtors. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from 
evil. For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, forever. 
Amen."

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



ELDER CHARLES W. NIBLEY 

' (Presiding Bishop of the Church) 

I am always awed in my spirit when I stand before this won- 
derful congregation. My soul is subdued. I have felt in my heart 
that we have had a time of rejoicing together this conference. I know 
with a certainty and a surety that this is the work of God. 

"mormonism" of special planting 

This thing called "Mormonism" is of his special planting and 
nurturing and bringing to pass. As was read in our hearing by 
President Grant this forenoon, "a great and a marvelous work is about 
to come forth." It is coming forth. We are only, it is true, at the 
beginning of it, but it is growing marvelously; and it has gathered, 
by the Spirit of the Lord, the inspiration of his Spirit in the hearts 
of our parents who received the gospel in the old countries and in 
this country, and brought us of the younger generation, to this choice 
and favored land. It has grown to such an extent, through his blessing, 
that we ourselves are not apprised of the influence and power that it 
exerts in this nation and in the world ; but it is his work that is 
doing it, it is he that hath made us and not we ourselves. So all 
honor and glory be given unto him through his beloved Son. I re- 
joice to be connected with such a work and such a people, the best 
people that the Lord has in all the world. There are many good 
people, many millions of good people, all over the earth, in many 
respects as good as we are ; but of all the world, of all those who 
dwell on the earth, this people up to this hour are the only ones, after 
all, who have been willing to listen to the call of the elders and the 
voice of the Spirit, who have sought him sufficiently so that they know 
in their hearts and souls, as well as you know, as well as the Latter- 
day Saints everywhere know, that this is the work of the Lord, that 
God lives, that Jesus is the Christ; not only so, but that he is our 
Father, that he is the only true and living God. Dead gods — there 
may be false gods, plenty on every hand, but our Eternal Father is 
the only true and living God, and Jesus Christ whom he hath sent. 
We worship him and he has revealed himself to this Church. He 
it is who has built up this Church ; Christ, our Redeemer and Savior. 
He it is who is guiding it now. It is not President Heber J. Grant ; 
it is not in his wisdom or power to guide this Church aright as a 
man, not at all, nor in Anthon H. Lund, nor C. W. Penrose. It is 
the Lord God Almighty that guides this Church, that has founded it, 
that has placed it where it is, and he will magnify it, lead it, bless it, 
and prosper it in the earth; and I say that the Lord has chosen a 
good people. They are the best, since they are the only ones, yet, 
who have been willing to listen to his call. Many more will come as 
the gospel is preached, and the gospel is to be preached in all the 



ELDER CHARLES W. NIBLEY 



165 



world, as a witness before the end comes, and there is an abund- 
ance of preaching to do. 

A GOOD MISSIONARY WORK 

I rejoiced in the priesthood meeting the other night to hear of 
the organization in some of the different stakes, Liberty stake, Granite 
stake especially, and probably in other stakes, missionary laborers, 
brethren called, sisters called, set apart by the power of the holy 
Priesthood to proclaim the gospel to their neighbors here at home, 
to visit from house to house ; a good work, very best kind of work ! 
Where is there any work that brings the joy that the preaching of 
the gospel brings, the reaching out to save a soul? There is no other 
joy like it. 

SAVING AND THRIFT ENJOINED 

I want to say a word or two upon another subject. We have 
been blest greatly as a people ; and during the late years, the years of 
the war, means have flowed in upon us in rich abundance. These 
conditions will not always continue. If we are in debt I think we 
ought to try to get out of debt. I think we ought to observe thrift. 
A good many people have forgotten what that word means. Thrift, 
saving, not necessarily being stingy, but save your means, economize. 
We have grown in the expenditure of our means to be extravagant and 
a good many of us are in debt heavily. We ought to make every 
effort this fall, and from now on, to free ourselves from debt. Then 
we will be free to go and preach the gospel if we are called to go. 
I know I try to economize, although I have plenty to live upon, yet 
if I may be pardoned for being a little personal, I haven't bought 
a pair of shoes for more than a year; I never had but two pairs of 
shoes at any one time in my life. I have had my old shoes patched 
up. I have felt it was my duty to economize, and to practice thrift, 
to be careful of expenditure ; and so, brethren and sisters, for the 
sisters also can help in this just as much as the brethren, let us try 
to practice old-time thrift and economy. I don't think it matters a 
great deal whether the feather in your wife's hat is just about six 
inches longer than the feather in my wife's hat. I don't think it 
makes such an awful difference. And that is about all there is in 
these foolish and extravagant expenditures. 

CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE ARIZONA TEMPLE 

I rejoice to know that the Latter-day Saints are remembering 
the Lord. I can testify to you, it is my privilege to do so, that the 
Latter-day Saints are a good people, notwithstanding all their weak- 
nesses — and we have a good many weaknesses, I have, oh, so many, 
doing foolish things, uttering foolish words. I need the Spirit of 
the Lord every minute to guide me and to direct me aright ; and yet, 
the Lord has blest the Saints, so that, they are remembering him in 
their tithes and in their offerings. I want to praise this people, not- 



166 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



withstanding a wave of criticism, a wave that carries us sometimes 
off our feet in this direction or the other. If we will only be a little 
patient, that will all pass by, and in thirty days probably we can say 
with McCarty, who, I think, was the author of If I inter e King — 
"Where are the woes of yesterday? The wind has blown them all 
away." 

A little while ago the Presidency sent out a notice which was 
printed in our newspapers, asking for those who felt like contributing 
to the building of the Arizona Temple, to send such offerings to the 
Presiding Bishop's Office. There has been reported something over 
five hundred wards out of nearly nine hundred wards and branches 
and missions, and more than seventy-seven thousand dollars has been 
received at the Presiding Bishop's Office up to this date. More . 
than three hundred wards have not yet reported. Some missions have 
not yet reported. In all there will pretty surely be received from the 
Saints for the building of the Arizona Temple more than one hun- 
dred thousand dollars. Now when you consider what the people are 
doing, sending out missionaries, doing so many things, building meet- 
inghouses, engaged in so many Church activities that take means, and 
then, this added contribution, I say it is a testimony that the Latter- 
day Saints, after all, are a mighty good people, and I believe the 
Lord in the main is pleased with us. 

THE CHURCH IN BUSINESS 

One other item, and I am through : I hear a very considerable 
criticism among our people here at home about the Church being in 
business. What right has the Church to be in business? they ask. It 
is not fair. Other churches are not in business. No, that is true. 
Other churches experience considerable difficulty in raising funds 
enough to pay their ministers. So they are trying to combine the 
different Protestant churches and thereby save considerable expense. 
And, since there is no special difference in doctrine, no special, posi- 
tive point for them to stand for, one church would be just as good as 
a dozen of that kind. But I want to tell you my brethren and sisters, 
that this is not that kind of a church. The Lord has established 
this Church. The time was when these Protestant churches had a 
very definite and positive principle and ground to stand upon and to 
stand for, to live and die for, if necessary, and they did die for it 
by the thousands and tens of thousands, and that principle was the 
principle of liberty, liberty to worship God as they pleased, liberty 
to give if they pleased, liberty to believe in indulgences being sold, if 
they wanted to believe in them, and liberty to disbelieve in it; and 
for this definite principle of liberty they fought and died that we might 
inherit the liberty that they purchased with their blood. I recall re- 
turning from Europe on one trip with President Smith, and I secured 
on the boat for him to read, because he didn't have much time to read 
except when at sea, Motley's Rise of the Dutch Republic, and after 
he had read it he made this observation: "Why the persecutions and 



ELDER CHARLES W. NIBLEY 



167 



trials that we have suffered as a people are nothing to what those 
Holland people, those Dutch people, have gone through in their eighty 
years' war." Liberty came to this nation, liberty has been established 
here. All honor to Protestantism. I take off my hat to the work that 
Protestantism has done for the world in bringing liberty, with its 
Luther and all who followed him. That having been accomplished, 
there seems to be little, so far as I can see — and I am not judging 
or criticising — of any definite purpose in Protestantism to stand for. 
But this Church is different, this Church is established to be in busi- 
ness. That is what it is here for, so that it has means to help in this 
direction and the other. Why what would it amount to without the 
ability to do things, to accomplish results? Do you need help in 
this direction, or the other, in colonizing, in building up towns and 
cities, in establishing this industry or the other, that will be for the 
benefit of the people? If so, the Church is here to help. That is 
what it is here for. 

THE CHURCH WILL GROW MORE AND MORE HELPFUL 

And it will grow more and more helpfvd all the time. Do not 
forget that, as Elder Ballard told us this forenoon, the Lord in 
his mercy, after he had revealed the law of consecration, and when 
we were not able, and we are not able yet by a long way, to accept 
that law, the Lord then revealed a lesser law, the law of tithing. 
The time will come when the law of consecration will be in force 
and instead of the Church being in business in a small' way, it will 
be in business in the greatest possible way, because it will control all 
our means. That is what it is here for. That is what it will accom- 
plish ultimately, but now we are not able, we are not far enough 
along to even consecrate ten per cent as tithing, so we need not 
clamor for the united order, or the law of consecration, not yet, until 
more of us — and I include myself in that number — until more of us 
are able to accomplish the consecration of ten per cent of what he 
gives us. So I raise my voice in protest against this criticism about 
the Church being in business, this or the other. As the years roll 
on it will be ten times more in business than it is now. The very thing 
that is criticised is largely what gives it power and influence in the 
world. 

I pray that the blessings of the Lord may be upon this people, 
continue upon them. I know they are a good people. This people 
shall be my people; their God my God; where they go or stay,. I 
go or stay, because there is none like them in all the world. God bless 
you. Amen. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

I regret to say that Brother J. Golden Kimball, who came from 
California to be present at our conference, on account of ill health 
is unable to be with us. 



168 GENERAL CONFERENCE 



ELDER RULON S. WELLS 

(Of the First Council of Seventy) 

"If any man say I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a 
liar, atid the truth is not in him." 

I have been greatly pleased in listening to the expounding of 
the law of God, the weightier matters of the law, which have been 
the theme of this great conference: judgment, mercy, love of God and 
love of our fellowmen. A great appeal has been made to the Latter- 
day Saints not to pass judgment upon their brethren, but to be chari- 
table unto all men, and particularly to the household of faith. No 
greater commandment has ever been given ; it is the greatest of all, 
that we should love God with all our hearts ; and the one that is like 
unto it, that we should love our neighbor as ourselves. These consti- 
tute the law and the prophets. If we do these things we will yield 
obedience to the commandments of God. "If you love me, keep my 
commandments." 

It devolves upon Latter-day Saints to cultivate the spirit of 
charity, good will and brotherly love toward the members of the 
household of faith, that we may be united, even as the heart and 
voice of one man, in all the things pertaining to the upbuilding 
of the Church and kingdom of God upon the earth ; and inasmuch as 
we ourselves are not perfect, we should not be too eager to pass judg- 
ment upon those who perchance may be less perfect than ourselves. 
Again, let no man boast of his own virtue or of his own righteous- 
ness; nor say in his heart or otherwise: "I am holier than thou," for 
let it be known, there are none righteous. "If we say we have no 
sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us." But if we 
have in our hearts the love of God and the love of our fellow men, 
nothwithstanding our weaknesses, there is hope for us ; we may be 
redeemed from sin and be brought to a knowledge of the truth ; we 
may be exalted and brought back into the presence of our Father. 
But, if we have not this love, neither for God nor man, there is no 
hope. Let no one think that because he may be in his outward life 
a little superior to some others, that he therefore is assured of his 
salvation and exaltation; he may be wanting in many virtues which 
may be hidden in the hearts of those whom he condemns. 

Instead of being so ready to judge others let us sit in judgment 
upon ourselves. Let us take an introspective view and perhaps we 
shall see that we are full of weaknesses and imperfections — a little 
selfish — not always true, hard-hearted, greedy, envious, or perhaps 
our thoughts are not always pure. I am appalled when I take an 
inventory of my own shortcomings and overwhelmed with the gi- 
gantic task that lies before me in my effort to overcome the world of 



ELDER RULON S. WELLS 169 

sin. Then comes to my mind the comforting words of the Apostle 
Peter : "Charity shall cover a multitude of sins." 

Let us then cultivate charity for the sinner. How beautifully 
did Brother Talmage differentiate between sin and the sinner. There 
are all grades of sinners, from those whose sins are slight to those 
who sin unto death ; but we are all sinners for "all have fallen short 
of the glory of God." If we can only appreciate this one truth, that 
we are all sinners and have need of repentance, and will let our 
hearts go out in love and charity towards all men, we will not be 
quite so ready to condemn them. When we bow the knee before the 
Lord in humble prayer and ask that he "forgive us our trespasses, 
as we forgive those that trespass against us." I think that our prayers 
will have greater weight with the Lord if we ourselves have charity 
and harbor no bitterness in our hearts, forgiving those who trespass 
against us. All men and all women are, to some extent, under the 
bondage of sin, and in order that we might be redeemed, in order 
that, we might be cleansed and purified from sin, the Lord in his 
mercy has revealed his glorious gospel, and happy are those who 
will receive the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ and through obe- 
dience make it effectual for the salvation of their own souls. 

If we see some others who are not so ready to lay hold on eternal 
life, through their obedience, as perhaps we have been, let our hearts 
go out in sympathy for them and let us manifest that sympathy by 
lending a helping hand. Let us endeavor to lift them up and bring 
them to a knowledge of the truth. Those that have no love of GoA 
and none of the milk of human kindness, have little chance to gain 
the presence of God. Greater by far are the opportunities of those 
who are still living a life of sin, if, at the same time, there is some- 
thing of the love of God and of their fellow men remaining in their 
hearts. I would rather be a pauper and eke out an existence in the 
slums of Liverpool, if I may yet have something of the love of God 
and human kindness still lingering in my heart — than to dwell in a 
palace and in luxury without it. I would rather be a drunkard and 
die in the gutter having charity and love for my fellow men in my 
soul than to occupy a high station among men and be honored by 
the world and yet be wanting in this principle. The gospel has been 
revealed for your benefit, for mine, for those who sin but a little, 
and for those who sin a great deal ; and the effect of it is, if we yield 
obedience to it, that we shall be cleansed from our sins, yea, though 
they are as scarlet yet shall we be made as white as wool. The very 
purpose of living upon this earth, at least one of the great purposes, 
is that we might repent of sin. We are a fallen humanity, fallen 
from the grace of God, full of weakness and imperfection; but 
through the atoning blood of Christ we can be cleansed and purified 
through obedience to his glorious gospel. 

Let us then practice the principles of eternal life. Let our hearts 
be full of charity towards all men, and let us garnish our thoughts 
with virtue unceasingly. Then we are promised that "our faith shall 



170 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

wax strong in the presence of God, and the doctrine of the Priest- 
hood shall distil upon our souls as the dews from heaven; the Holy 
Ghost shall be our constant guide and companion, and our scepter 
shall be a scepter of righteousness and truth; our dominion shall be 
an everlasting dominion, which without compulsory means shall flow 
unto us forever and ever." God grant that we may attain these 
blessings, my brethren and sisters, I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 



ELDER CHARLES H. HART 

(Of the First Council of Seventy) 

There has been a passage of scripture upon my mind today, ons 
given to the Prophet Joseph Smith, to this effect: 

Therefore strengthen your brethren in all your conversation, and in 
all your prayers, and in all your exhortations, and in all your doings. 

I feel that we have been strengthened during this conference 
by the prayers and by the exhortations of the brethren. It has been 
a source of continuing satisfaction to me that the spirit and teachings 
of this conference have been in accord with my own spirit and feel- 
ings. This text goes farther than the mere praying or preaching in 
a meeting. It goes, you will observe, to our daily walk and conversa- 
tion — to our doings. A sociologist of national repute, in a friendly 
spirit of constructive criticism, pointed out to me sometime ago, as 
I was preaching the gospel to him, some weaknesses which he had ob- 
served in communities largely made up of Latter-day Saints. I feel 
that the instructions of this conference will correct, or tend to correct 
in the fullest, the weaknesses which he pointed out. 

One of Tennyson's characters, "wearing the white flower of a 
blameless life," was one "who spake no slander, no, nor listened to 
it." Slander and the receiving of slander are condemned not only by 
the Holy Scriptures as presented in this conference, but by other 
writings, and by the laws that have been formulated against wrong- 
doing. The Talmud of old is strong against it, perhaps too strong. 
It says : "He that slanders, he who receives slander, and he who bears 
false witness against his neighbor, deserves to be cast to the dogs." 
Again, "All animals will one day remonstrate with the serpent and 
say : 'the lion treads upon his prey and devours it ; the wolf tears and 
eats it ; but thou, what profit .hast thou in biting ?' The serpent will 
reply, (Ecclesiastes 8:2) T am no worse than a slanderer.' " The same 
writings represent Deity (I think it is a misrepresentation) as saying 
to the prince of hell : "I from above and thou from below shall judge 
and condemn the slanderer." I accept the idea so far as it represents 
even the prince of evil as condemning slander. One of the things 
about slander is the difficulty of correcting it,, although the defamer 
may be penitent. Someone has given us the suggestion of one stand- 



ELDER CHARLES H. HART 171 



ing upon a tower, in a wind-storm, scattering feathers by the pound 
and then after becoming penitent, undertaking to gather the scattered 
feathers. So, a poet has said: 

Boys flying kites haul in their white-winged birds, 

But remember, you can't do that way when you're sailing, words. 

Thoughts unexpressed may sometimes fall back dead, 

But God himself can't kill them when they're said. 

I may add : unless he works a miracle, which he may not be 
willing to do for our benefit, although we become penitent. 

The slogan or keynote of this conference correlates nicely with 
the course of instruction given to the parents of the Church through 
the Sabbath Schools, an elaboration upon the ten commandments. 
Months of time have already been spent upon a single command : 
"Thou shalt honor thy father and thy mother," and so forth ; and in 
view of the fact that the other commandments which will be studied 
later are so largely negative in form, it is very timely that the instruc- 
tions of this conference should be given. 

There is modern revelation teaching the spirit of forgiveness and 
tolerance. My time is very brief and I shall read only a few of these 
verses given in connection with the Lord pointing out the weaknesses 
of his people at Kirtland, just as, at a later time, the shortcomings of 
the Saints in Missouri were declared to them : 

Now I speak unto you concerning your families; if men will smite 
you, or your families, once, and ye bear it patiently and revile not against 
them, neither seek revenge, ye shall be rewarded; 

But if ye bear it not patiently, it shall be accounted unto you as being meted 
out a just measure unto you. 

And again, if your enemy shall smite you the second time, and you re- 
vile not against your enemy, and bear it patiently, your reward shall be 
an hundred fold. 

And again, if he shall smite you the third time, and ye bear it pa- 
tiently, your reward shall be doubled unto you four fold ; 

And these three testimonies shall stand against your enemy if he 
repent not, and shall not be blotted out. 

And further: 

And again, verily I say unto you, if after thine enemy has come upon 
thee the first time, he repent and come unto thee praying thy forgiveness, 
thou shalt forgive him, and shall hold it no more as a testimony against 
thine enemy, 

And so on unto the second and third time; and as oft as thine enemy 
t-epenteth of the trespass wherewith lie has trespassed against thee, thou 
shalt forgive him, until seventy times seven; 

And if he trespass against thee and repent not the first time, never- 
theless thou shalt forgive him; 

And if he trespass against thee the second time, and repent not, never- 
theless thou shalt forgive him; 

And if he trespass against thee the third time and repent not, thou 
shalt also forgive him; 

But if ye bear it not patiently, it shall be accounted unto you as 
him, but shalt bring these testimonies before the Lord, and they shall not 



172 GENERAL CONFERENCE 



be blotted out until he repent and reward thee four fold in all things 
wherewith he has trespassed against thee. 

Some of us are less tolerant with our brethren than the custo- 
dians of the law are with the condemned criminal. In the first place, 
he is not convicted until either eight men or twelve men after hear- 
ing all the evidence, and arguments and instructions, have an abid- 
ing conviction to a moral certainty that he is guilty. Then, when 
he is imprisoned in modern times, he is treated as a human being, 
and not as an unforgivable outlaw. These are some of the facts de- 
veloped by our social committee in the recent course of instruction 
at Provo. They found that the old regime of punishment is being 
done away with, and that men are treated as human beings in our 
penal institutions ; that some offenses that used to be severely punished 
— the taking of a piece of bread from the table or the indulgence in 
conversation at the table, are no longer made punishable and the 
men, as they go to their work now, go singing and joyous with the 
humane treatment and the hope they have of redeeming themselves. 
They are not escorted to their road-work by an armed guard as form- 
erly, but by an unarmed foreman. When these men are strength- 
ened by their custodians, by conversation, by exhortations and by the 
fair treatment they receive, they are reformed and graduated. They 
look upon the prison as a school graduate does upon his Alma Mater, 
and they write back kind letters of appreciation for the consideration 
shown them and for the opportunity given to redeem themselves. The 
thought is that surely we can be as generous and as charitable to our 
brethren and to our sisters as the law is, and as the custodians of the 
law are, to those whom they may have in hand for correction. 

May the Lord bless the proceedings of this conference and may. 
we all be able "to strengthen our brethren in all our conversation 
and in all our prayers, and in all our exhortations and in all our "do- 
ings," is my prayer, and I ask it in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER LEVI EDGAR YOUNG 

(Of the First Council of Seventy) 

I have been interested in everything that has been said at this 
conference. May we all give our faith and prayers to the work of the 
Church in the missionary field of all the world, for the gospel of 
Jesus Christ must be taught to the children of God in every nation 
and clime. We have heard the humble testimony of Elder Serge 
Ballif who is leaving for Germany and Switzerland to preside over 
that great mission. Brother Ballif is a man of few words but wonder- 
ful spirituality, and he will do a good work in spreading the word of 
the Lord in Europe. I had the honor and pleasure at one time of 
presiding over the Swiss and German mission, and I want to add 
my testimony here that those Germanic peoples will accept the truth, 



ELDER LEVI EDGAR YOUNG 173 

for they are intelligent and have developed a wonderful civilization. 
The German people of the Empire of Germany will rise and accept 
freedom and truth and be saved. They are a good people, those 
Germans, and we as the Church of Christ as well as the government of 
the United States must approach them with the spirit of love and not 
of revenge and hate. No lasting peace can come to this world until a 
peace is based on the love of God for all peoples. 

I remember going once to the home of a German peasant in 
the little city of Gotha, when a man opened the door and went to 
strike me with a hammer. I turned to him and said: "Please read 
this little tract. It is the word of God to his children in these last 
days." He lowered his hammer, took the tract, and looked at the 
cover. I said to him : "Come, let us pray to God to help us see the 
truth as contained in this book." We knelt down together and prayed, 
and today, that man who received me in anger, is now a member of 
the Church, and is here in Zion. Love conquered him. Those Ger- 
man people are the children of God, and they must hear us in the 
Spirit of God's love. 

This has been a conference of good and mighty words inspired 
of the Lord. The subject of thrift and industry; of government and 
learning; and the divinity of the family life as well as the sanctity 
of the Church of Christ, all have been spoken about with great power. 
These are the institutions of civilization, and we as members of the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints stand for them in all 
their meaning to life. The great central theme of this conference, 
however, has been to know God and to keep his commandments. But 
we cannot know him without the spirit of love ; for now abideth faith, 
hope, love — these three, but the greatest of these is love. 

Let us stand for God and his work. He has spoken to us.; he 
has made himself known. His prophets arc upon the earth today. 
The great work is being carried on. Let us place our faith in him 
as never before, and go forth hand in hand, and heart to heart to- 
ward the perfect day which God is preparing for his children. Amen.

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

Before the close of this conference I desire to express to our 
heavenly Father, on behalf of myself and associates, the deep grati- 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 



177 



tilde of our hearts for the rich outpouring of his Holy Spirit that 
has been with all those who have addressed the conference since the 
first opening remarks. I pray God to bless the Latter-day Saints, to 
fill their hearts full of charity and love and long-suffering, to give 
them a love of God and of their fellows that they may, in very deed, 
remember the teachings of the Savior. May the people of Christ 
love God with all their might, mind, and strength, and may they love 
their brother as themselves. May the peace of heaven attend the 
Latter-day Saints. May the Lord bless their flocks, their herds, all 
their possessions, and all that pertaineth unto them. May they grow in a 
love of the gospel, in a love of truth, in a love of their fellows ; and 
I, as the mouthpiece of the Lord here upon the earth, bless all the 
Latter-day Saints and the honest the world over, and pray God to 
confound the wicked and to bring their schemes to naught, and I ask 
it in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

We Meet the Demand 

For Sanitation and Cleanliness 
in Schools and Churches 

As important as the cultivation of the mind is the 
safeguarding and promotion of health in the schools. 
Physical culture is now recognized as basic to mental 
growth. 

Without sound health, students cannot make the right 
progress with their studies. And without a clean and san- 
itary environment, every student's health is in jeopardy. 

Hence the war on filth and dirt that is now being 
waged by boards of education, teachers and parents. A 
sweet, clean school room is recognized as the heritage of 
every American boy and girl. 

We are lined up, too, in the fight for cleanliness and 
sanitation in the schools — ready with the best lines of 
janitorial equipment that the market now affords. Ex- 
clusive agents of the Banner Chemical Co., we are in a 
position to equip schools with — 

Disinfectants, Liquid Soaps, Liquid Soap Dispensers, 
Deodorants, Toilet Disinfectors, Drip Fluid, Paint Cleaner, 
Metal Polish, Furniture Polish, Automatic Floor Oiler, 
Sweeping Compound, Door Mats, Rubber Matting, Chem- 
ical Fire Extinguishers, Floor Brushes, etc, etc.

Two New And Important Church Books 



Prophecies by Joseph Smith and Their Fulfillment 
A Valuable Book, by Nephi L. Morris 

Was Joseph Smith a Prophet? What answers come from the cen- 
tury that has rolled by since he beheld his first vision? Have the Lat- 
ter-day Saints misplaced faith in him? After the progress of a hundred 
years, what has Time done with his claims to the title of a Prophet, 

In order to make plain the outcome of Time the author has dug up 
old and forgotten manuscripts and prints which he lays before the 
readers. 

Did you know that Joseph Smith foretold the War of the Rebellion, 
stating exactly where it should begin? Did you know that he foretold 
in th'e same prophecy exactly when the World War should occur? 

Did you know that he foretold the fate of Judge Stephen A. Douglas, 
the man who contended with Lincoln for the presidential chair? 

Did you know that he prophesied that this great Intermountain 
Empire should arise here as a result of the persecutions of the Saints at 
the hands of their enemies? 

Did you know that he placed the Garden of Eden in America and 
that today many great scientists agree with him? 

Did you know that he placed the date of the birth of the Savior 
as April 6th and probably the date ef His crucifixion as the same date? 

Does the Book of Mormon chronology of these evtents agree with 
his statements? 

Did you know that the United States has faithfully pursued the path 
pointed out for her by the Book of Mormon Prophets thousands of 
years ago? 

Did you know that Apostle Orson Hyde foretold the part that Eng- 
land should take in the restoring of Jerusalem to the Jews and that his 
prophecy was published in 1842 — seventy-five years before the event 
transpired? 

Read this interesting book for the answers to these questions.

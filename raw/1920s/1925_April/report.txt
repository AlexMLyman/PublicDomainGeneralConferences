of Latter-day Saints 



FIRST DAY 

The 95th Annual Conference of the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints convened in the Tabernacle, Salt Lake City, Utah, 
Saturday, April 4, 1925. 

President Heber J. Grant presided and announced the opening of 
the Conference at 10 o'clock a. m. He was sorry to state that 
President Chas. W. Penrose had been critically ill during the past six 
months and hence could not be present with us in this conference, 
which we all regret.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Central States; Charles A. Callis, Southern States; John M. Knight, 
Western States; Joseph W. McMurrin, California; Brigham S. Young, 
Northwestern States ; Rey L. Pratt. Mexico ; Joseph Quinney, Jr., 
Canada; Eugene J. Neff, Hawaiian, and Benjamin Goddard, Bureau

All the seats in the large Tabernacle were occupied, both in the 
gallery and in the main hall and on the choir stand. Hundreds were 
standing in the side aisles, both on the main floor and in the gallery. 

President Grant announced that the choir and congregation would 
sing, "O ye mountains high," out of respect to President Charles W. 
Penrose. President Grant read the poem in full, and stated that by 
permission of President Penrose the words in the song, "on the 'necks' 
of thy foes thou shalt tread," were changed, and would be sung, 
"on the 'schemes' of thy foes thou shalt tread." 

After the choir and congregation had sung the hymn with spirit 
and effect, the opening prayer was offered by Elder Samuel F. Smith, 
president of the Snowflake stake of Zion. 

A solo entitled, "Hosanna" was sung by Melvin Peterson. 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

It is very gratifying, indeed, to see this immense congregation 
here this morning, bespeaking the interest of the Latter-day Saints in 
the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. It is customary at the opening 
session of our conference to give some statistics and to refer to the 
condition of the Church at home and abroad. I am very pleased to 
be able to announce that the work of the Lord is growing all over 
/the world; and that there is never a month or a year but what the 
Church is stronger, spiritually and financially, than it was the month 
or the year previous. 

FINANCIAL STATEMENT 

The following financial statement I am sure will be of interest to the people 
here assembled : 

From the tithes of the Church there has been expended for stake and ward 
purposes, $1,352,663.43. 

For education, the maintenance and operation of Church schools, $727,808.93. 

For construction, maintenance and operation of temples, $442,018.46. 

For the care of the worthy poor and other charitable purposes, including 
hospital treatment, $175,520.77. 

For the maintenance and operation of all the missions, and for the erection 
of places of worship and other buildings in the missions, $700,664.09. 

This makes a total of $3,398,675.68, taken from the tithes for the maintenance 
and operation of the stakes and wards, for the maintenance and operation of 
Church schools and temples, for charities, and for mission activities. 

In addition to charities paid out of the tithes as before named, there have 
also been disbursed the fast offerings and Relief Society and other charities, 
amounting to $489,406.61, which amount added to the $175,520.77 paid from the 
tithes, makes a total of Church charities, $664,927.38.

this number 256 persons were divorced in the year 1924. 
Families owning their own homes, 72 per cent. 

PRESIDENT C. W. PENROSE SERIOUSLY ILL 

As announced in the opening, President Charles W. Penrose is in 
a precarious condition. He sends his love to all the brethren, and 
desires them to know that they have his confidence in all that they 
may do ; and his message to the Saints is to obey the law. wherever 
they reside. 

Elder Seymour B. Young, President of the First Council of 
Seventy, has passed away since our last conference, having been a 
faithful member of the Council for something over forty years. 

A MISSION HOME IN SALT LAKE CITY 

A home on State street has been dedicated for the entertainment 
of missionaries, and for the purpose of giving them instructions for 
a week or more, prior to their departure upon their missions ; and 
also to take care of any returning missionaries who may be stopping 
briefly in this city on their way home, after having filled an honorable 
mission. We are pleased to announce that at the dedication there was 
a rich outpouring of the Spirit of the Lord, and we feel assured in 
our hearts, judging from the inspiration of the occasion, that it will 
be a source of great benefit to our young men and young women 
who are called to go out into the mission field. 

CHANGES IN STAKES 

There have been some changes in a number of the stakes, and the new men 
chosen to preside are as follows : 

Curlew stake, Colen H. Sweeten. 
Yellowstone stake, John M. White. 
Nebo stake, Lee R. Taylor. 
San Luis stake, James P. Jensen. 
Young stake, Elmer F. Taylor. 

New wards have been organized since our last meeting as follows : 
Hillcrest ward, Grant stake. 
Inglewood ward, Los Angeles stake.

LaGrand Second ward, Nebo stake. 

Payson Fourth ward, Nebo stake. 

Santaquin Second ward, Nebo stake. 

Genola ward, Nebo stake. 

Virginia City ward, Los Angeles stake. 

Home Gardens ward, Los Angeles stake. 

Ballard ward Lost River stake. 

New stakes organized, since our last conference : 

Kolob stake, President George Ray Murdock. 

Palmyra stake, President Henry A. Gardner. 

In addition to the death of President Seymour B. Young we announce the 
death, since our last meeting, of David H. Cannon, president of the St. George 
temple, for many years ; Bishop James A. Wright, of Bingham ward, Jordan 
stake, and Bishop Armond T. Rose, of North Farmington ward, South Davis 
stake. 



Perhaps no one thing in connection with the Church is as dear 
to the hearts of the Latter-day Saints as our missionary labor. Count- 
ing the time, the salaries that might be earned by those who are in 
the mission field, and the expense of maintaining them there, the 
Latter-day Saints are expending today something over $2,000,000 a 
year for the spread of the gospel in the world. 

We know that the first and most important duty for us is to love 
the Lord our God with all our heart, might, mind and strength ; and 
second to that is love for our fellowmen. No people in all the world in 
proportion to their numbers, are giving such evidence of a love for their 
fellowmen, and a desire for their welfare, as are the Latter-day Saints. 
Our missionary work proclaims to all the world our willingness to 
make financial sacrifice and to labor with no hope of earthly reward, 
for the salvation of the souls of the children of our Father in heaven. 
I am sure that a general statement of the missions will be of interest 
to this congregation. 

We have in the California mission, presided over most ably by 
President Joseph W McMurrin, 125 missionaries. There are 8,625 
people in that mission. We own Church property in that mission 
valued at $289,114.04.

Each and all of the men presiding over these missions are giving 
the best in their power for the advancement of their missions. They 
are men of God, devoted to the welfare of their respective missions. 
And this can be said also of all the other missions, the statistics of 
which I shall now read, giving the name of the mission, the president, 
the missionaries, the membership and the Church property. 

European Missions : 

Armenian, Joseph W. Booth 2 164 450.00 

British, James E. Talmage 151 5,670 78,518.17 

(Here let me mention the splendid work Elder James E. Tal- 
mage is doing presiding over the European mission. The fact that he 
is a member of the Royal Society of Edinburgh gives him a standing 
in Europe that perhaps none of the rest of us could possibly have. 
He is receiving excellent consideration from newspapers there, and is 
working early and late, as he has done all his life. He is one of the 
most industrious, energetic men I have ever known, and is making 
a very splendid successor to< President David O. McKay, who did such a 
good work as the president of the European mission. )

world. ( i [ i j ij 1 1| 

Certainly when we consider the limited means of the people who

embrace the gospel all over the world — for the gospel seems to reach 
the poor — we have great cause to rejoice in the financial showing in 
our missions, as well as the wonderful showing financially here at 
home. 

PRESIDENT GRANT'S TOUR OF THE MISSIONS 

Since I last had the privilege of meeting with you in general 
conference, I have visited the missionaries in the east, and given them 
instructions — in Indianapolis, Indiana ; Minneapolis and St. Paul, Min- 
nesota; Detroit, Michigan, and Milwaukee, Wisconsin; also in Chicago, 
and held public meetings in all of these places except Chicago. 

At Minneapolis we had the pleasure of dedicating a very splendid 
meetinghouse and recreation hall erected there, and of meeting with 
a most excellent class of Latter-day Saints. We have chapels also at 
St. Paul and Minneapolis. The Saints at Detroit and at Indianapolis 
are gathering funds for the purpose of assisting in erecting chapels in 
those places. 

On Nov. 27, I left Salt Lake City for Independence to attend 
the funeral of my cousin and the cousin of President Joseph F. Smith, 
Thalia Grant Smith. The services were well attended. After that I 
had the privilege of holding meetings in Independence, Kansas City, 
and St. Louis; also at Fort Worth, San Antonio and Kelsey, Texas, 
and in Wichita, Kansas, and instructing the missionaries in all of these 
places, as well as holding public meetings, which were well attended. 
In a number of places we have excellent meetinghouses to meet in. In 
others we have rented halls. 

During this trip I had the privilege of speaking before the Cham- 
ber of Commerce in Kansas City, Missouri. The sectetary announced 
his regret that all of the six thousand members of that great body 
had not had the privilege of listening to my twenty minute talk. I 
said in reply : "I can remedy that very easily. I will have six thousand 
copies of this speech delivered at your office so that when you send out 
your next monthly statements you can enclose a copy." 

He expressed his pleasure in doing it. They were printed, and 
delivered, and I have received many letters from men who have read 
the speech, expressing their pleasure in having heard or read what 
I had to say regarding the faith of the Latter-day Saints. In that 
short address, speaking very rapidly (much more rapidly than I am 
doing now), I quoted all the Articles of our Faith and made com- 
ments upon them. It took four columns of the Christmas News to 
print that twenty and one-half minutes speech. I rejoice that there 
were at least a score of influential men who shook hands with me and 
expressed their pleasure in having heard the plain statement of the faith 
of the Latter-day Saints, as embodied in our Articles of Faith. 

When I stop to reflect that the Latter-day Saints were expelled 
from the state of Missouri under the exterminating order of the gov- 
ernor of that state, then to think that representative men of one of 



PRESIDENT HEBER J GRANT

the largest business organizations in Kansas City — one of the most 
progressive cities in the Union — would listen with attention and after- 
wards congratulate the President of the Church upon a speech in which 
he quoted the Articles of Faith, and some of them expressed regret 
that I did not have an hour instead of twenty minutes, and invited 
me to come back again, and take the hour, certainly we have to acknowl- 
edge that God is moving in a mysterious way his wonders to perform, 
and that the Latter-day Saints are becoming known for what they 
really are — a God-fearing, upright people, who are loyal to God and 
to their country. 

The newspapers in all these places gave me better notices and 
published fairer reports of the speeches I made than I have ever had 
before on any trip I have taken. 

On January 9, I left Salt Lake City for Los Angeles, for a brief 
visit, feeling very much the need of a little rest. I had the pleasure, 
on that short trip of only ten days, of speaking in the Adams ward 
and the Matthews ward in Los Angeles stake. 

Feb. 3, I left Salt Lake City for a visit to the California, the Cen- 
tral States, and the Southern States missions, first treading the sands 
of the Pacific, and a few days later the sands of the Atlantic. Meet- 
ings were held upon that trip, in Ocean Park, Oakland and San Fran- 
cisco; also in New Orleans, in Jacksonville, Florida, and in Atlanta, 
Georgia. 

In all of these places there was a splendid attendance, and again 
the newspapers gave very fair notices of the meetings and of what 
was said. In no case was there any attempt to ridicule or belittle or to 
change the remarks that I had made in public, where reports were 
taken, or where interviews were given. Some slight mistakes were 
made, but they were all unintentional mistakes. 

I have never enjoyed greater liberty in proclaiming the gospel 
than I did in some of the meetings on this last trip, lasting something 
over five weeks, visiting the California, the Central States and the 
Southern States missions. 

I believe this fully covers the activities of the Church that would 
be of interest to the Latter-day Saints, and of my own labors since 
we were together six months ago. 

... ABSOLUTE FAITH IN JESUS CHRIST 

I rejoice beyond the power with which God has endowed me to 
express my feelings, in the knowledge I possess regarding the divinity of 
this great Latter-day work in which we, as Latter-day Saints, are .en- 
gaged ; and as I travel I find a lack of belief in God, and in the divinity 
of Jesus Christ, even among the ministers of the gospel, I rejoice in 
the fact that every man and woman in the Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints has an absolute faith in God, in his individuality, 
and an absolute faith that Christ is the Son of God, the Redeemer of 
the world ; that he came to the earth with a divinely appointed mission

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



•to die for the sins of the world, and that he is in very deed the head 
of the Church of Christ. 

Upon the trip last mentioned, I cut from a newspaper a clipping 
which I had intended to read at this conference, but I have misplaced it. 
It was a recommendation by an English lord that people discard the 
"absurdity" of Jesus Christ as a God on earth and a Redeemer of the 
world, and that they accept the Mohammedan philosophy; suggesting 
that they could believe in all of the ethical teachings of the religion of 
Christ and Mohammed, but that they should get away from the 
absurdities of Christianity, and settle the various disputes and troubles 
that they were having in the Christian religion. 

Wherever I read that statement — and I read it in a number of 
places — I took the trouble to state to the people in the various places 
where I preached, the position of the Latter-day Saints as to the gospel 
in which we believe. I quoted the vision of Joseph Smith and Sidney 
Rigdon, as follows : 

"And this is the gospel, the glad tidings, which the voice out of the heavens 
bore record unto us — 

"That he came unto the world, even Jesus, to be crucified for the world, 
and to bear the sins of the world, and to sanctify the world, and to cleanse it 
from all unrighteousness ; 

"That through him all might be saved whom the Father had, put into his 
power and made by him ; 

"Who glorifies the Father, and saves all the works of his hands, except those 
sons of perdition who deny the Son after the Father has revealed him." 

I announced to the people that in the Church of Jesus Christ no 
man or woman would be admitted into the Church, or be permitted to 
retain fellowship who is not willing to accept this statement absolutely 
without mental reservation. I also read to them : 

V 

"And now, after the many testimonies which have been given of him, this 
is the testimony , last of all, which we give of him : That he lives ! 

"For we saw him, even on the right hand of God ; and we heard the voice 
bearing record that he is the Only Begotten of the Father — 

"That by him and through him, and of him, the worlds are and were created, 
and the inhabitants thereof are begotten sons and daughters unto God." 

I announced in those meetings, in some of which the majority of 
the audience were non-members of the Church, that every Latter-day 
Saint must subscribe to the doctrine that God himself visited the boy 
Joseph Smith, and that God himself introduced Jesus Christ to the 
boy as his well-beloved Son. I announced to these audiences that 
among the Latter-day Saints there is no evidence of "modernism" 
So-called, and that no man or woman will be fellowshiped in this 
Church who denies the individuality, the personality of God, or that 
Jesus Christ is in very deed the Son of the living God, the Redeemer of 
the world, 1

THE WORD OF WISDOM 

I regret to say that there is becoming evident among the Saints, a 
lack of interest and a looseness in observing the Word of Wisdom. I 
regret to have heard that there are men occupying positions as bishops' 
counselors, and as members of high councils, who do not observe this 
law; that certain bishops' counselors and members of high councils are 
not only drinking tea and coffee, but some of them are using tobacco. 
No man who uses tobacco is worthy to stand as high councilor in this 
Church. He owes it to himself to clean himself up or step aside and 
allow a man with more faith, with more manhood, with more integrity 
to God and his laws, to take the position that he occupies. 

President Wilford Woodruff from this stand, many years ago, 
called upon every man holding the Priesthood and occupying any of- 
fice in this Church, to obey the Word of Wisdom or to resign and 
step aside. I reiterate that men who do not obey the Word of Wisdom 
are not worthy to stand as examples before the people, to be invited 
into private priesthood meetings and to discuss matters for the welfare 
of the Church of God. Their disobedience shows a lack of faith in the 
work of God. I shall not take your time to read all of the Word of 
Wisdom, but I shall take time to read the words of the living God that 
must be acknowledged by every Latter-day Saint to be the word of 
God, or he or she is not entitled to be a member of this Church. 
After telling us what is good for us, the Lord makes a promise that 
is one of the most marvelous, one of the most uplifting and inspiring 
promises that could possibly be made to mortal man. He says : 

THE PROMISE 

"And all Saints who remember to keep and do these sayings, walking in 
obedience to the commandments, shall receive health in their navel and marrow to 
their bones ; 

"And shall find wisdom and great treasures of knowledge, even hidden 
treasures ; 

"And shall run and not be weary, and shall walk and not faint. 
"And I, the Lord, give unto them a promise, that the destroying angel shall 
pass by them, as the children of Israel, and not slay them." 

AN ILLUSTRATION OF THE DESTROYER REBUKED 

I shall never forget the occasion when a friend appealed to me, 
upon learning that the doctor had announced that his daughter, strick- 
en with diphtheria, would die before morning. He asked me to pray 
for that daughter, and after leaving his office I prayed with all the 
earnestness of my soul that God would heal that girl. While praying, 
the inspiration came to me : "The power of the living God is here 
on the earth. The Priesthood is here. Hurry! Hurry! Get John 
Henry Smith ; go and rebuke the power of the destroyer, and the girl 
shall live." 

The doctor waiting upon that girl, said she could not live till 
morning ; but when morning came he explained that he could not com- 



10 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



prehend it, and that he believed the girl was going to get well. He 
could not refrain from expressing his surprise at the change in the 
girl's condition over night. The power of the living God rebuked the 
destroyer. 

"And I, the Lord, give unto them a promise, that the destroying 
angel shall pass by them, as the children of Israel, and not slay them. 

The Lord has told us through the Prophet Joseph Smith : 

"If a person gains more knowledge and intelligence in this life, 
through his diligence and obedience than another, he will have so much 
the advantage in the world to come." 

No man who breaks the Word of Wisdom can gain the same 
amount of knowledge and intelligence in this world as the man who 
obeys that law. I don't care who he is or where he comes from, his 
mind will not be as clear, and he cannot advance as far and as rapidly 
and retain his power as much as he would if he obeyed the Word of 
Wisdom. 

TITHES AND REAL PROSPERITY 

The law of financial prosperity to the Latter-day Saints, under 
covenant with God, is to be an honest tithepayer, and not to rob the 
Lord in tithes and offerings. Prosperity comes to those who observe 
the law of tithing ; and when I say prosperity I am not thinking of it 
in terms of dollars and cents alone, although as a rule the Latter-day 
Saints who are the best tithepayers are the most v ros P erous men, 
financially ; but what I count as real prosperity, as the one thing of all 
others that is of great value to every man and woman living, is the 
growth in a knowledge of God, and in a testimony, and in the power to 
live the gospel and to inspire our families to do the same. That is 
prosperity of the truest kind. I would rather die in poverty knowing 
that my family could testify that, to the best of the ability with which 
God had endowed me, I had observed his laws and kept his command- 
ments, and by my example, had proclaimed the gospel, than to have 
all the wealth of the world. 

OUR RELIGION THE TRUTH 

Either we have the truth, and this gospel called "Mormonism," is 
in very deed the plan of life and salvation, the power of God unto 
salvation, through his Son Jesus Christ, and by following its teach- 
ings the greatest of all the gifts of God to man, namely, life eternal, will 
be ours, or it is not the truth. 

God has given to men and women all over the wide world, seek- 
ing for the light of his spirit, in answer to humble prayers, a testimony 
and a knowledge that this gospel is exactly what it purports to be — 
that it is the truth, that it will stand forever, and that those who live 
it shall be exalted eternally in the presence of our heavenly Father, 
and his Son, our Redeemer.

CLOSING TESTIMONY 

May God help each and every one of us who have a knowledge 
of the divinity of this work to live so that other men, seeing our good 
deeds, may glorify God and be led to investigate the plan of life and 
salvation. I bear witness to you here today, that I know God lives, 
that Jesus is the Christ, that Joseph Smith was and is a prophet of the 
true and living God, that he was a martyr, that he gave his life for 
this cause, and that his blood bears witness to the integrity, the honesty 
and inspiration of his mission as a prophet of the living God, because 
he was true even unto death. May God help us one and all to live 
the truth, is my prayer, and I ask it in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

A soprano solo, "The mighty God hath spoken", was sung by 
Mrs. Laurinda P. Brewerton. 



ELDER DAVID O. McKAY 

I have had a few surprises in my life, but I think none greater 
than this. However, it is a very agreeable surprise. I am thankful 
for the privilege of meeting this vast audience and partaking of the 
spirit of this inspirational gathering. It is a joy to look once again 
into the faces of close associates and dear friends. It is this element 
which makes the meeting this morning more appreciated them the 
meetings generally that I have attended during the past three or four 
years. 

THE SPIRIT OF ONENESS AND LOVE 

I am glad to report, however, that the spirit of the meetings abroad, 
wherever we meet Latter-day Saints, is the same as that which we 
have here this morning. It matters not in what part of the globe the 
meeting is held, whether in the islands of the sea, in Japan, in Syria, 
in the Scandinavian countries, in England, Germany, France, Holland — 
wherever one meets a group of Latter-day Saints whose faith in the 
gospel of Jesus Christ is unwavering, there one finds the spirit of 
oneness, the spirit of love, the spirit of willing sacrifice for the good 
of humanity. God bless the Latter-day Saints all over the world that 
they may continue in that same spirit. 

APPEAL FOR AN HONEST HEARING 

It is a source of regret to me that such people should be so grossly 
misunderstood. May I read the following: 

"We desire to hear of thee, what thou thinkest, for as concerning 
this sect we know that everywhere it is spoken against." 

These are the words of some Jews from Jerusalem to whom Paul, 
then a prisoner, bound in Rome, had made an appeal for an honest 



12 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



hearing". They referred to the sect called Nazarene. Everywhere 
it was spoken against. Today after nearly two thousand years every- 
body acquainted with Christianity knows that Paul was falsely accused, 
and that that sect was vilified by those who spoke against it. It is 
a simple matter today to understand the wrong that was done to Paul 
and to the believers in the lowly Nazarene, but it isn't so easy for some 
people to see that today in the matter of persecuting a religious or - 
ganization history is repeating itself. The Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints, as was the Church in the meridian of time, is 
everywhere spoken against, and its missionaries, are falsely accused. 
Paul, even at the time these men said they would like to hear him, was 
in Rome, because he had been accused of being a pestilent fellow, a 
mover of sedition, a profaner of the temple, all of which he denied 
before Festus. He denied these charges also before Felix, he denied 
them before King Agrippa, and bore his testimony before them, as 
President Grant has borne his testimony this morning, to the divinity 
of the Lord Jesus Christ. But everywhere the people spoke against 
him. 

IGNORANCE THE CAUSE OF MIS JUDGMENT 

I have been impressed during the last few years with this fact, 
that many people, British particularly, seem to choose to believe the 
bad things that are said against this people in preference to the good. 
I have tried to analyze why this is so ; and I have come to the conclusion 
that much of it is due to ignorance. There are two principal classes 
of men and women in the world who choose to fan this flame of igno- 
rance. These two classes are, first, those who will vilify an honest 
people for mercenary purposes ; and second, those who misunderstand 
or who misinterpret the doctrines of the Church of Christ and justify 
themselves in opposing it on the ground that they do not wish their peo- 
ple to be contaminated by false doctrines. The first class, those who 
wilfully tear down another's reputation to get gain, I think should be 
classed among the worst people on earth. The government handles a 
man who will take the life of another, and may make him forfeit his own 
life for that which he takes. I think next to the heinous sin of murder 
is the crime of murdering one's reputation to get gain. W.e have men 
and at least three women in the world who are guilty of this despicable 
thing. Such purveyors of falsehood have that within them which seems 
to feed upon the slander which is current among mankind. Oliver 
Goldsmith said that this spirit is like -the tiger which, after having 
tasted human flesh, ever afterwards pursues men in order *to satiate 
his appetite. So the slanderer who has once gratified his appetite with 
calumny, makes ever after the most agreeable feast upon murdered 
reputation. It is a difficult thing to oppose, indeed often it is best 
not to attempt to oppose it ; for as one great thinker has said, "Slander 
has a strange constitution, the more you oppose it the more it grows." 
Thus, because of the activity of this class of people, and also because 



ELDER DAVID O. McKAY 13 

of the activity of those who choose to misinterpret the gospel of Jesus 
Christ and justify themselves in opposing it, we find throughout the 
world that the Church of Jesus Christ is spoken against, not because 
of what the Church is, but because of what people think it is. There is 
a vast difference between those two things. 

IN SPITE OF ALL, THE WORK OF GOD IS GROWING IN EUROPE 

But, brethren and sisters, I am delighted to report to you that in 
spite of this condition the work of God is growing by leaps and bounds 
in the European mission. In Great Britain where I have spent much 
of my time during the past few years, I am pleased to report that the 
work is progressing, and that the outlook is most favorable. There 
150 young men are devoting their time to the spreading of the truth 
and to the contradicting of these vile stories that have received such 
current circulation in that country. The same may be said of the 
other missions in Europe. In Holland the work is growing. Only 
last October on a Wednesday night, Amsterdam hall, just dedicated 
for the little branch there, was crowded to overflowing, and that is but 
typical of most of the meetings held there. 

The French mission has just been organized, but in Switzerland 
the branches are growing, slowly it is true, but growing. 

In Belgium, part of the French mission, the work is increasing 
rapidly. 

In Syria, Brother Booth is devoting his life to the work among 
the Armenians, and the cause is in good hands. True we are not 
doing much missionary work there; but rather taking care of the little 
branch that is ours, waiting for the opening of that great mission. 

In the Scandinavian countries we find the same spirit of progress. 

GROWTH IN GERMANY BY LEAPS AND BOUNDS 

In Germany the work is growing by leaps and bounds. You will 
be interested to know that last March in Koenigsberg when we 'held 
our conference, there were sitting on the stand in the beautiful gym- 
nasium, part of a public school, seventy-five children who furnished 
music for the six hundred people assembled in a Sunday School 
session of conference. That night seventy-five adult voices furnished 
the music for the conference, the hall crowded to capacity, and as 
part of that service they rendered most efficiently and effectively part 
of Haydn's "Creation." On that same tour, on the following Tues- 
day at Stettin, We found the hall crowded to capacity at ten minutes 
to 7:00 o'clock. An excellent choir furnished the music. On our way 
to that service, publicly announced, we passed on our left the jail 
in which some of our elders had been incarcerated but a few years be- 
fore, for preaching, or attempting to preach the gospel of Jesus Christ. 
On the following Sunday in one of the large assembly rooms of a 



14 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



school house in Berlin there were assembled over one thou- 
sand children, Sunday School members, in one of the most 
inspirational Sunday School sessions I have ever attended. It is a sig- 
nificant fact that the street car officials of that great city, ran special 
cars for the benefit of the Latter-day Saint children. That afternoon 
we met in the Staat hall in Berlin, twelve hundred eighty-six people 
worshiping God there without molestation. Five minutes walk from 
where we met stands the jail in which President Clawson, my brother 
Thomas E., and some of their fellow-workers were incarcerated, a few 
years ago, for attempting to hold meetings such as we were holding 
there with permission of the Berlin authorities. On October 7, 1924, in 
Hamburg we held a most remarkable conference. On the Saturday 
night of which one hundred voices, nearly all of whom were members of 
the Church rendered Evan Stephen's "The Vision" in a most inspir- 
ational manner. Sunday night, as the concluding number of an in- 
spirational, never-to-be-forgotten conference, that same 'choir sang 
"The Martyrs." These two great productions have been translated into 
German by one of our own brethren. The choir had been trained by one 
of our own elders. 

THE FIRST CLASS PRESS MORE FAVORABLE 

Saturday night the choir of one hundred voices was assisted by 
one hundred fifty children who sang "Praise to the man who communed 
with Jehovah." A man not in the Church was sitting by my side, and 
when those combined choirs sang so inspiringly and in perfect tune, 
so far as my ear could detect, I dropped my head because of the tears 
in my eyes, and I saw tears rolling down my companion's cheeks, im- 
pressed beyond expression. These are but a few incidents indicative 
of the progress now being made in the European mission. Another 
encouraging indication is the fact that leading papers in London and 
in Liverpool and other great cities of the European mission have re- 
fused to print slanderous stories about the so-called "Mormons." A 
few years ago these vile slanders were given free currency. I will add 
also that the Latter-day Saints in those missions are united with the 
elders in counteracting the falsehoods and vilifications and vitupera- 
tions that are so generally accepted as true. Tracting societies, carried 
on by our own members, are quietly, though effectively, overcoming 
the ignorance that seems to be the cause of the misunderstanding against 
this great Church, which stands for all that the gospel of Jesus Christ 
contains. 

OUR ELDERS TEACH THE FUNDAMENTALS OF CHRISTIANITY 

Recently I read a summary of the fundamental teachings of Chris- 
tianity given by Albert P. Fitch, formerly professor in Amherst College, 
one of these modernists to whom President Grant has referred. The 
first fundamental in the spirit of Christianity he gives as the ethical 
and religious supremacy of Jesus Christ. This faith means believing 



ELDER DAVID 0. McKAY 



what Jestts said regarding the moral and religious nature of God and 
man. The second fundamental he names as the acceptance of Christ's 
religious teaching and practice on the ground that it sets forth the 
principle which can be workable on our world, and the one principle 
potent enough to overcome our world. As the third condition in that 
belief he begins with Jesus' teaching as to the nature and character of 
God and he names the Father whom Jesus teaches as having redemptive 
love freely and supremely given, supremely exemplified in good will 
toward man. The fourth condition of this universal belief in Jesus 
means to be a son and a brother in this kingdom, this divine family 
which Jesus teaches ; and to be a son and brother means to love our 
fellowmen the way God loves us. 

- These this prominent writer gives as the fundamentals of Chris- 
tianity. These the elders of the Church of Jesus Christ are preaching. 
Their aims are lofty, their purposes are sublime, and the world in- 
stead of speaking against them should encourage them and uphold them. 
Particularly this is true of the state of Utah. Every citizen of this 
state owes an obligation to the 2,000 missionaries who are out represent- 
ing this state in honor. Why should anyone condemn the missionaries 
who are out preaching the gospel of Jesus Christ without price, paying 
their own expenses for teaching to the world the Fatherhood of God, 
the brotherhood of man, and bearing witness in kindness and love, that 
our Father has appeared to man, that his Son Jesus Christ has been 
raised from the tomb and now lives, bearing witness to the word of 
the immortality of the soul? Who should vilify people for standing 
on that . sublime ground ? They testify further that the Church of 
Christ is organized in its perfection, and if the world will accept that 
Church and apply its principles economically, educationally and so- 
cially, the brotherhood of man will be established and the millennium 
for which all honest souls are longing will be hastened. 

TESTIMONY 

I testify to you here that God lives, that he is near to his servants, 
and will hear and answer them and guide them when they come to 
him. I know that my Redeemer lives. I know it! I know that he 
has spoken to man in this age. I know that his Church is established 
among men. God help us all to be true to it and help the world to see 
it as it is and not as ignorant men, and vicious men and women some- 
times picture it, I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

PRIESTHOOD CONVENTIONS 

During the past three months, by direction of the First Presi- 
dency of the Church, there have been held, in many of the stakes 
of Zion, priesthood conventions, the purpose of which was to stimu- 



16 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



late renewed zeal and increased activity in the councils and quo- 
rums of the Priesthood. I hail with delight the inauguration of 
this heaven-inspired movement, in which I am proud and happy 
to have taken part. 

The Priesthood, which means divine authority and the men in 
whom that authority is vested, is by far the most important thing 
in the Church of Christ; being, in fact, the rock upon which it 
rests. There could be no Church without the Priesthood. It is 
therefore of vital consequence that all the quorums and councils should 
function effectively toward the great ends for which they were 
instituted. 

To my mind the most enjoyable of the meetings held in con- 
nection with the priesthood conventions, were those in which the 
brethren who had been appointed to speak related instances of the 
power of the Priesthood that had come under their observation or 
within the range of their experience. What I heard in those meet- 
ings awakened in me a desire to discourse briefly upon the subject at 
this general conference of the Church. 

A GOD OF MIRACLES 

Among the words of the Savior, as recorded in the New Testa- 
ment, are the following: 

"Verily, verily, I say unto you. He that believeth on me, the works that I do 
shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do; because I go unto 
my Father." (John 14:12.) 

To what particular works did the Savior refer when he made 
this remarkable promise to his disciples? I believe that he had 
reference to or meant to include the wonderful works, connected 
with his mortal ministry — the miracles whereby he manifested his 
divine power, and concerning which it is written : He "did not do 
many mighty works" in certain places, "because of their unbelief." 

The "beginning -of miracles" in the Savior's ministry was the 
turning of water into wine, at the marriage feast in Cana of Galilee 
(John 2:11). Afterwards he fed a multitude of five thousand peo- 
ple with five loaves and two fishes. He walked upon the water, 
stilled the tempest, healed the sick, cast out devils, gave sight to the 
blind, raised Lazarus from the tomb, and did many other marvel- 
ous works. 

SIGNS TO FOLLOW BELIEF 

He endowed his apostles with the same power (Matt. 10:1-8), 
and having commissioned them to "go into all the world and preach 
the Gospel to every creature," he said, "And these signs shall fol- 
low them that believe. In my name shall they cast out devils; 
they shall speak with new tongues; they shall take up serpents; 
and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them; they 
shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover" (Mark 16:17, 
18). "And they went forth and preached everywhere, the Lord 



ELDER ORSON F. WHITNEY 



17 



working with them and confirming the word with signs following" 
(Ibid 5:20). No good Christian doubts this, nor does any faithful 
Latter-day Saint. 

HIGHER CRITICISM'S ATTITUDE 

Nevertheless, there is a growing disposition in these modern 
days to discredit and deny all such things — to do away with every- 
thing savoring of the supernatural. "Higher Criticism," as it is 
called, seems to regard this as its special mission. It would fain 
strip the Son of God of his divinity, and make him merely a good 
and a great man whose teachings are salutary and uplifting. Jesus 
Christ, we are told, was not miraculously begotten ; he did not do 
the mighty works attributed to him ; his blood did not atone for 
sin, nor was he raised from the dead to become the Author of the 
Resurrection. All these are myths and fables, invented for propa- 
gandist purposes, and are unworthy of credence by any intelligent 
mind. Such is the attitude of the so-called "Higher Criticism," 
otherwise known as "Modernism." The logic of its advocates is 
simply this: We cannot do works of that kind, and therefore 
works of that kind cannot be done. 

I concede the first proposition, but not the second. They who 
doubt the possibility of miracles are indeed without the power to 
perform them. But this does not prove that believers lack that 
power. Miracles are the fruits of faith. "These signs shall follow 
them that believe." The gist of the matter is this : These doubters 
have done away with God, or have tried to do away with him, and 
consequently are unable to conceive of a higher power than they 
themselves possess. 

ILLUSTRATIVE ANECDOTES 

Their position reminds me of an incident that occurred many 
years ago, when I was a ward bishop in this city. It was Sunday 
evening, and a Primary Association conference was in progress at 
the ward chapel. One of the sisters, a Primary teacher, gathered 
the little tots around her upon the stand, and told them, the story 
of Jesus feeding the multitude. Going home that night, one of 
the mothers, anxious to impress the lesson upon the mind of her 
little son, asked him the question: "What did Sister Blank tell 
you this evening?" "She told us about the Savior feeding the peo- 
ple," answered the boy. "How many people?" queried the mother. 
"Five thousand." "And what did He feed them with?" "Five 
loaves of bread and two fishes." "Well, now, how do you suppose 
he could do that?" The little fellow mused a moment, and then 
blurted out: "Well, I don't believe those in the middle got any." 

His child mind could not grasp the idea that it was a miracu- 
lous feeding of the multitude, and that it was done by the power 
of God, and not of man. 

Another little boy, of whom you may have heard — for I have 



18 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



told the story more than once in the congregations of the Saints — 
was of quite a different turn. Johnny was his name, and he had 
a little brother named Billy. The two were playing in their moth- 
er's door-yard. Johnny was whittling a stick, and Billy had just 
caught a fly. "Johnny," said he, "what a funny thing a fly is. See 
what lots of legs he's got. And every time I blow him he buzzes 
(suiting the action to the word). I wonder how God made him." 

Yes, and I wonder too. I wonder how He made the sunbeam, 
and the blade of grass, and the flowers and the trees. I don't 
know — all I know is that they are. 

But Johnny had an idea of how God made the fly. He went 
on whittling, and said : "Well, Billy, God don't make flies like 
men make houses. When he wants flies he says, Let there be flies, 
and then there is flies." 

Johnny had read the Bible, and understood it. He had learned 
the first great lesson of Scripture : "And God said, Let there be 
light, and there was light." His mind could allow for the differ- 
ence — the vast difference between the might of Omnipotence and 
the puny strength of mortal man. 

NOT CONTRARY TO LAW 

One objection — perhaps the main one — urged against a belief 
in miracles, is that they are contrary to law. But that is a great 
mistake. They are in strict conformity with law. The universe is 
governed by law, and its Creator works in consonance therewith. 
But there are greater laws and lesser laws, and the greater suspend 
at times the operation of the lesser. When this occurs, men ex- 
claim : "A miracle !" Others say : "It never happened, for it is 
contrary to law." Contrary to some law it may be, or may seem 
to be — some lesser law with whose everyday workings men are 
familiar; but not contrary to some higher law regarding which they 
may know little or nothing. 

CARLYLE ON NATURAL LAWS 

"What are the laws of Nature?" asks Carlyle, and answers his 
own question thus : "To me perhaps the rising of one from the 
dead were no violation of these laws, but a confirmation, if some 
far deeper law, now first penetrated into, and by spiritual force, 
as all the rest have been., were brought to bear on me with its 
material force. * * * 'They [the laws of Nature] stand writ- 
ten in our books of science', say you ; 'in the accumulated record of 
man's experience.' Was man with his experience present at the 
creation, then, to see how it all went on? Have any deepest scien- 
tific individuals yet dived down to the foundations of the universe, 
and gauged everything there? Did the Maker take them into his 
counsel, that they read his ground-plan of the incomprehensible 
All, and can say, This stands marked therein, and no more than 
this? Alas, not in any wise! * * * To the minnow, every 



ELDER ORSON F. WHITNEY 



19 



cranny and pebble and quality and accident of its little creek may 
have become familiar; but does the minnow understand the ocean 
tides and periodic currents, the trade winds and monsoons and 
moons' eclipses, by all which the condition of its little creek is 
regulated, and may from time to time (unmiraculously enough), be 
quite upset and reversed?" (Sartor Resartus, Natural Super- 
naturalism.) 

A grand old thinker, that Carlyle. Man is not a minnow, to be 
sure. But neither is man's finite wisdom any criterion by which to 
judge the infinite wisdom of the All-wise. 

ELISHA AND THE AX 

When Elisha the Prophet caused the sunken ax-head to float 
on the surface of the river into which it had accidentally fallen (II 
Kings 6:1-6), he was working in acccordance with law, but not any 
ordinary law. The Law of Gravitation, in obedience to which all 
things on earth tend toward a common center — the center of the 
earth — required the ax to stay where it was, at the bottom of the 
stream. But the Prophet evidently knew of a higher law which 
could suspend the action of the law of gravity as to that particular 
object. He invoked that higher law, and "the iron did swim." 

MOSES AND THE RED SEA 

When Moses divided the Red Sea, so that Israel might pass 
through and escape from the pursuing Egyptians, who were over- 
whelmed by the returning waters, he was working in accordance 
with law — divine law. And the same is true of all servants of the Lord 
who have wrought miracles at any time. 

JOSHUA AND THE SUN 

"Higher Crtiticism" laughs to scorn the idea of Joshua com- 
manding the sun and moon to stand still, so that Israel might have 
light enough effectually to defeat his enemies (Joshua 10:12-14); 
and the Bible account which declares that "the sun stood still and 
the moon stayed," is treated with derision. Because, forsooth, if 
the sun had halted even for a moment in its regular course, the 
whole mighty universe would have come crashing down into chaos 
and ruin. Well, perhaps so, if there had been no God to uphold 
it — the God who made the sun and moon, and whose almighty 
power holds them in their orbits and controls their every action. I 
see nothing more marvelous in controlling the heavenly bodies, 
than in creating them in the first place. Be it a fact, as is claimed, 
that it was the earth that stood still in Joshua's day, and that the 
sun and moon only seemed to be stationary, that does not affect 
the main argument. The same God who made the earth also made 
the sun and moon, and could have stayed them in their course had 
He so willed.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



WHAT ARE MIRACLES? 

Miracles are extraordinary results flowing from superior means 
and methods of doing things. When man wants light he strikes a 
match, or presses a button, or turns a switch — and lo ! there is light. 
When God wants light, he says: "Let there be light." It is 
simply a matter of knowing how to do things in a superior way, 
and having the power to do them. Man is gradually acquiring this 
power. It is a far cali from the tallow dip to the electric light. 
But the end is not yet. Improvements will continue to be made, 
and some day, perhaps, men may be able to make light just as the 
Lord makes it. Paradoxically, it might be said that the time will 
come when miracles will be so common that there will be none. 

MODERN INSTANCES 

The Latter-day Saints are not strangers to the miraculous work- 
ings of divine power. Our history as a people is replete with such 
occurrences. I could relate many experiences of my own in sup- 
port of this assertion, and so could these, my brethren, seated here 
upon the stand. 

My first experience of the kind was in the year 1877, when I 
was a missionary in the State of Ohio. I had been preaching in 
the farming districts near the town of Elyria, testifying that the 
miraculous "signs" promised by the Savior were in the Church of 
Christ today, the same as in days of old. A sick woman took me 
at my word and sent for me. She had been suffering for six weeks 
with neuralgia, and was almost maddened by the incessant pain. 
She asked me to administer for her relief. Up to that time I had 
never performed the healing ordinance, and felt very timorous over 
the outcome, fearing that if she were not healed I would be deemed 
an impostor and perhaps driven out of the neighborhood. More- 
over, her husband had threatened to kill any "Mormon" missionary 
who crossed his threshold. But I went — and was not molested. 

No sooner had I laid my hands upon that woman's head, than 
a power came upon me that I had never felt before, nor have I ever 
felt it since, in the same degree. It was a burning in my bosom, 
so powerful as to almost deprive me of speech, and it went like 
fire to the very tips of my fingers. I rebuked the pain in the name 
of Jesus Christ, and the woman was instantly healed. "Thank 
God !" she said, "the pain has gone." I sank into a chair and burst 
into tears, overcome by this manifestation of the goodness and 
power of God. 

Not long afterwards, I was visiting a family of Saints in the 
coal-mining region near the town of Akron. A married daughter 
of the household came trudging through a snow storm, with her 
two little children, a distance of three miles, to get me to baptize 
her. I did so, the immersion taking place in a little brook running 
through her father's lot. It was February, and the weather was 



ELDER ORSON F. WHITNEY 



21 



extremely cold. The moment I stepped into the icy stream a pain 
shot up to my heart, and I feared for a moment that I would have 
to step out again. I feared also that the little woman would not be 
able to endure it. So I silently prayed that the water might be 
tempered. Immediately there was a change in it — or else in me, 
for I felt the cold no more, nor did she complain of it at all. 

HEALING SELF-ADMINISTERED 

The baptism over, she went on her way rejoicing. But I was 
in distress. A pain had seized me in the elbow of my left arm, 
and it steadily grew worse. That evening I used some liniment 
upon it, but got no relief, and my arm continued to swell and 
stiffen. I could hardly move it next day, but by that time I knew 
just what to do. There was some consecrated oil in the house, 
but my green inexperience had made me think that it would be 
improper to use it on myself, there being no other elder present. 
But suffering had opened my eyes, and my faith was strong, for I 
felt that the pain had no business there. That night I carefully 
washed off the liniment, applied the holy oil, and rebuked the pain 
in the name of Jesus. The effect was instantaneous. I turned my 
arm over — the pain was gone ; and I have never felt a vestige of it 
since. 

THE GREATER SUSPENDS THE LESSER 

One more instance, and I am done. Some years ago I was en- 
gaged to deliver a lecture in one of the towns south of this city, 
and was on my way to the lecture hall when I received a message 
from the bishop of the ward, asking me to come and administer 
to his little daughter, who was critically ill. Her doctor had said 
that she could not live till morning. Taking with me another 
elder, I proceeded to the bishop's home, and we administered to 
the dying girl. Next morning a telephone message informed me 
that a marvelous change had taken place. The young patient, who 
had not slept for days prior to being blessed by us, immediately 
thereafter had sunk into a sweet and refreshing slumber. She 
slept twelve hours, and woke up — normal, and continued so. The 
doctor was astounded, and the parents, of course, were overjoyed. 
That girl, then fifteen years of age, and now twenty-four, is an 
active member of the ward in which she resides, has a good posi- 
tion, and goes to and from her work as well and happy as if she 
had never known a day's illness. 

Her physician had said that she could not live till morning — 
and no doubt he was right, from his viewpoint. Medical science 
had so decreed, and but for the interposition of Divine Providence, 
that decree would probably have gone into effect. According to 
the lesser law she could not live. But a greater law said : "She 
shall live." And the lesser could not operate in the presence of 
the greater.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



ALL THINGS POSSIBLE TO THEM THAT BELIEVE 

Miracles belong to no particular time or place. Wherever and 
whenever there is a legitimate demand for the exercise of divine 
power, that power will act, and marvels will result. We worship 
a God of miracles, and he changeth not, but is the same yesterday, 
today and forever (Mormon 9:7-11, 17-20). There is but one valid 
reason for the absence of miracles among any people, and that 
is the absence of faith. "All things are possible to them that 
believe." 

The choir and congregation sang, "How firm a foundation, ye 
Saints of the Lord." 

Benediction was pronounced by Elder Nelson J. Hogan, president 
of the Idaho stake of Zion. 

Meeting adjourned until 2 o'clock p. m. 



AFTERNOON SESSION 

President Heber J. Grant opened the meeting by announcing 
that the choir and congregation would sing, "O say what is truth?" 

After singing, Elder Colen H. Sweeten, president of the Curlew 
stake of Zion, opened the meeting with prayer. 

A duet, "For so hath the Lord commanded," was sung by Cannon 
Lund and August Glissmeyer. 

BISHOP CHARLES W. NIBLEY 

It is a great honor, I am sure, to be asked to speak to this con- 
gregation, but I approach this duty with fear and trembling. The meet- 
ing this morning, the first session of our conference, gave assurance 
that the Lord is still with his Saints, and still recognizes this work, and 
that he is sustaining his servants who labor for his honor and glory. 

There is a deep significance in Elder McKay's testimony given 
this morning, when he spoke concerning the changed conditions in 
some nations of the earth where hitherto our sons suffered imprisonment 
for trying to preach the gospel ; while now places of prominence are 
open to them, even the halls of the governments, in which Latter-day 
Saint missionaries have been invited to hold meetings. What has 
brought about this change? 

During recent years, especially since the World War, great changes 
have taken place in this direction. I call your attention to a revelation 
of the Almighty, given to the Church through the Prophet Joseph 
Smith found in Section 98, beginning at the 4th verse : 

"And now, verily I say unto you concerning the laws of the land, it is 



BISHOP CHARLES W. NIBLEY 



23 



my will that my people should observe to do all things whatsoever I command 
them. 

"And that law of the land which is constitutional, supporting that principle 
of freedom in maintaining rights and privileges, belongs to all mankind, and is 
justifiable before me. 

"Therefore, I, the Lord, justify you, and your brethren of my church, in 
befriending that law which is the constitutional law of the land; 

"And as pertaining to law of man, whatsoever is more or less than these 
cometh of evil. 

"I, the Lord God, make you free, therefore ye are free indeed; and the 
law. also maketh you free. 

"Nevertheless, when the wicked rule the people mourn. 

"Wherefore, honest men and wise men should be sought for diligently, 
and good men and wise men ye should observe to uphold ; otherwise, whatsoever 
is less than these cometh of evil." 

Again, in the 101st section of the same book, commencing at the 
77th verse, we find : 

"According to the laws and the Constitution of the people, which I have 
suffered to be established, and should be maintained for the rights and pro- 
tection jof all flesh, according to just and holy principles; 

"That every man may act in doctrine and principle pertaining to futurity, 
according to the moral agency which I have given unto him, that every man 
may be accountable for his own sins in the day of judgment. 

"Therefore, it is not right that any man should be in bondage one to 
another. 

"And for this purpose have I established the Constitution of this land, by 
the hands of wise men whom I raised up unto this very purpose, and redeemed 
the land by the shedding of blood." 

This last revelation was given just after the Saints had been driven 
from their homes in Missouri. Yet the Lord's words to his people 
were that the Constitution of the United States is that which "I estab- 
lished." This divinely conceived Constitution is, we are told, for the 
benefit of all mankind. The Lord said that its underlying principles 
are for the benefit of all flesh, not made for this country alone, but in- 
tended to govern the whole world. 

Why is it that the elders are not permitted to preach the gospel in 
Russia today, where there are a hundred and eighty million people who 
have scarcely heard of the gospel? It is because of the moral agency 
that the Lord speaks of in the revelation known as section 101. These 
people are denied their free agency. The rulers of this people have 
a wrong conception of the rights and privileges which the Lord says 
pertain to all mankind. 

In the 109th section of the Doctrine and Covenants is a prayer, 
given by revelation to Joseph the Seer, which was repeated in the 
Kirtland temple at the time of its dedication on March 27, 1836. I 
shall not undertake to read it, but shall quote only the 54th paragraph : 

"Have mercy, O Lord, upon all the nations of the earth ; have mercy upon 
the rulers of our land ; may those principles which were so honorably and 
nobly defended, namely, the Constitution of our land, by our fathers, be estab- 
lished forever."

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



These words were uttered as a part of the dedicatory prayer, not- 
withstanding the persecution the Saints had suffered prior to 1836, 
persecution suffered at the hands of people who were prejudiced, people 
who were ignorant as to what the Latter-day Saints stood for, ignorant 
as to their beliefs and their aims. Notwithstanding all this, and clearly 
showing the broad and liberal spirit of this great latter-day work where 
such matters are concerned, the words last quoted were uttered as a 
part of the dedicatory prayer. 

The revelations found in the Doctrine and Covenants, sections 
98 and 101, which I have quoted, and in which the Lord has said that 
no man should be in bondage to another, were given at a time when 
millions of negroes were in bondage in the southern part of the United 
States. At that time there existed a great question as to whether or 
not slavery should be perpetuated, and it seemed that the decision 
might be in favor of continuing to hold this black-skinned race under 
bondage to the white men who owned them. Thk question was 
settled a few years later, when the Supreme Court rendered its decis- 
ion in the Dred Scott case. Dred Scott was a negro who escaped from 
serfdom and went into one of the eastern states. His owner followed 
him and replevined him, claiming he was after his own property, just 
as he would go for a mule or an ox or a cow. Under the law the 
slave was his property. Chief Justice Taney, then at the head of the 
Supreme Court, delivered the decision that this was the law, the con- 
stitutional law. This discision was the law of the land; but in the 
justice and mercy of Almighty God, even a law which became a con- 
stitutional law, had to be overthrown, and the Lord raised up Abraham 
Lincoln and others -to see that the law laid down by Him — that one man 
should not be in bondage to another — was set right and true freedom 
established in this land. 

From that day on, millions more of slaves have been freed in 
Russia and other lands. In these latter-days, thrones have tottered 
and fallen, and in place of these has come a representative form of 
igovernment, a government of the people, a government which gives 
the people their moral agency, spoken of in the revelations I have read, 
and which the Lord says is pertinent to all mankind. 

It is true that there might be a constitution similar to ours in such 
countries as Mexico or Russia, and the results would not be at all the 
same, for the people of these countries are not as intelligent as are the 
people of this nation. But even in such countries, our Constitution 
could not help but produce a better government, for in that Consti- 
tution are the underlying principles which will, in time, teach these peo- 
ple to govern themselves intelligently. In order that the various peoples 
of the earth may at sometime reach the point at which they can in- 
telligently govern themselves, the Lord in his mercy has in the past 
overthrown nations comprised of millions of people who have been 
subjected to unrighteous domination. 



BISHOP CHARLES W. NIB LEY 



25 



Now, coming to our own land, our own Constitution, I think 
we hardly appreciate sufficiently what this Constitution means to us 
and to the work of the Lord. It is my belief that this Constitution, 
which the Lord declared he established, is for the benefit of all man- 
kind. Verse 77, Section 101, reads as follows: "According to the 
laws and constitution of the people, which I have suffered to be estab- 
lished, and should be maintained for the rights and protection of all 
flesh, according to just and holy principles." Certainly, the funda- 
mental, governing principles which the Lord has established on the 
earth under the name of the Constitution of the United States, were 
meant for all men, everywhere. These principles, with their accompany- 
ing freedom and liberty, are inseparably connected with our great 
latter-day work, it seems to me ; for the Lord tells us that this free- 
dom, this liberty, was brought about through the hands of wise men 
whom he raised up. Without this great Government of ours, this God- 
given Constitution, the gospel of Jesus Christ could never have found 
an abiding place in the earth. They are connected, correlated, inter- 
locked one with the other ; for the Constitution, like the gospel itself, 
is for the benefit of all flesh, for all mankind. 

The Book of Mormon tells us that so long as the people of this 
nation are willing to acknowledge Jesus Christ as the God of this 
land, or as the ruler of this nation, so long shall his mercies be ex- 
tended unto them. Notwithstanding the weaknesses of our people, and of 
other people, I believe that today there is a greater desire in the minds 
of millions of people of this nation to acknowledge God and to ac- 
knowledge Jesus Christ and to live righteous lives than there has ever 
been before. While in some ways wickedness may be increasing, yet 
there is an earnest desire in the hearts of millions of people in this 
nation to acknowledge God and serve him. 

Only a month ago President Coolidge delivered his inaugural 
address, and he closed it with the name of God upon his lips. These 
are the closing w T ords of that address : 

"America seeks no earthly empire built on blood and force. No ambition, 
no temptation, lures her to the thought of foreign dominion. The legions 
which she sends forth are armed, not with the sword, but with the cross. The 
higher state to which she seeks allegiance of all (mankind is not of human, 
but of divine, origin. She cherishes no purpose save to merit the favor of 
Almighty God." ! f ' ' ■ i jj 

Here is a direct acknowledgement, most direct, coming from the 
very head of the nation, showing that the nation believes in God, 
believes in his divine providence, and asks for nothing save the favor of 
God. 

When Abraham pleaded with the Lord that the cities of the plain 
might not be destroyed, he was told that if he could find ten righteous 
people, the Lord would spare them. I believe that, instead of ten 
righteous people in this nation of one hundred and ten millions, there 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



are millions of people who are righteous, who daily seek the Lord, and 
who try to live according to their beliefs. 

On the coin of the realm there is another direct acknowledgment 
that as a nation we believe in God, for, stamped on every silver dollar 
and on every goldpiece, are the words: "In God We Trust." 

Also, in our national anthem we have these words: 

"Then conquer we must, for our cause it is just, 
And this be our motto : 'In God is our trust !' 
And the Star-spangled Banner in triumph shall wave, 
O'er the land of the free, and the home of the brave." 

I believe that it is my duty and your duty to teach our children 
concerning this great God-inspired Constitution, this great law of 
liberty which he has given to this world, and which was never given 
before to any nation in any land. Never before has there been a rep- 
resentative government of this kind. Republics have been tried, hun- 
dreds of times, thousands of years ago, but never was there anything 
like this Government. If I had the time I could point out the differences 
between our God-given Government and those governments of men. 

In our nation's hymn "America," we have the words which were 
given, I believe, by the inspiration of the Almighty. ' The last verse 
of this hymn is the one that declares our beliefs as to who is the God 
of this land, and while we sing it, I believe that we feel in our hearts 
that Jesus Christ is indeed our God, the true Ruler over this great land 
of ours. The words of the last verse are these: 

"Our father's God! to thee, 
Author of Liberty, 
To thee we sing ; 
Long may our land be bright 
With freedom's holy light; 
Protect us by thy might, 
Great God, our King!" 
The Lord bless us. Amen. 



ELDER JOHN A. WIDTSOE 

About ten days ago it seemed as if I might be prevented from at- 
tending this great gathering. I took counsel with myself, and came to 
the conclusion that the general conferences of the Church, which I have 
been permitted to attend, with considerable regularity, ever since the 
days of my early manhood, have been a tremendous source of strength to 
me. I doubt whether any other Church activity has been more powerful 
in establishing and building my faith than these great general con- 
ferences. 

GOD GUIDES AND DIRECTS THIS PEOPLE 

I have been stirred by this conference; and uplifted in my feelings. 
I desire to bear witness to the truth of that which has been spoken. 



ELDER JOHN A. WIDTSOE 



27 



God has indeed been with us, and his word has been taught by his ser- 
vants who have been called upon to address us this day. It is always 
a source of gladness to me to recognize, in the events within the Church, 
that God does indeed guide and direct this people. 

THE TRUE MEANING OF LIFE 

These great gatherings are a constant marvel to me. There are none 
other like them in the world. I never attend one without pondering upon 
the real reason why these conferences bring out these hosts of people, 
all apparently of one mind, one heart, and one understanding. President 
Grant's remarks this morning gave the explanation. These thousands 
could not assemble every six months, and enjoy these meetings, unless 
we were certain about the great issues of human life. I believe that 
every person here belonging to the Church, who has caught the spirit 
of this great latter-day work, feels certain as to the origin of man, 
the purpose of life, and the destiny of humanity. Perhaps no search 
in the history of the world has been equal to the search for the truth 
regarding the origin and destiny of man. We have had times when great 
nations have given themselves to a search for wealth or for long life. 
The elixir of life and the philosopher's stone were the objects of man's 
seeking for many generations, and at other times men have sought other 
great things. But there has never been a time when the great majority 
of thinking people have not attempted to seek out the true meaning of 
life. We have found that true meaning. In the hearts of the Latter- 
day Saints there is an assurance as to the meaning of life, and that 
security of knowledge makes possible the many wonderful things that 
characterize this Church and Kingdom. 

UNCERTAINTY OF THE MEANING OF LIFE A CAUSE OF WICKEDNESS . 

As I travel about among those not of our faith it seems to me that 
the uncertainty concerning the meaning of life is a chief cause of the 
wickedness, indifference and fear which are found among the nations 
today. In fact, whenever uncertainty with respect to this fundamental 
problem attacks an individual, from that moment on, either fear develops 
with him, fear of the unknown, often leading to superstition, or he 
becomes indifferent, and says: "I don't know whence I came, I don't 
know where I am going, why should I care? Let me do my bit today, 
my little kindness, but pay no attention to the. churches or to organized 
forms of religion, because I don't really know what is the truth." 

REVEALED RELIGION GIVES THE INTERPRETATION 

Curiously enough, our wealth of modern, man-made knowledge 
sheds little light upon the meaning of life, unless interpreted in the light 
of revealed religion. How different with us Latter-day Saints ! If we 
know one thing with certainty, it is that we were in the beginning with 
God, that we came here according to a fully and completely devised 
plan, and that we shall live on after this life, forever and forever. 

Father Lehi, in his remarkable farewell address to his children, 



28 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



as recorded in the Book of Mormon, declares that "Adam fell that men 
might be;" and continues, "and men are that they might have joy." Any 
person reading this statement so frequently quoted among our people, 
must understand that the very essence of it is that there is no chance 
with respect to the great program of human life, but that this earth and 
all things on it, every living soul, fits into the great, eternal plan 
prepared by Almighty God before the foundations of this earth were 
laid. In another place in modern scripture we have a statement to the 
effect that not only shall we have joy in this life, on this earth, but 
that in the hereafter we shall have "immortality and eternal life." Not 
merely continued existence, from age to age, but eternal life with all 
that life implies — activity, development, growth and increase of every 
proper kind of character. Such doctrines give joy to the human heart. 
Such doctrines make it possible to live on this earth in the face of 
difficulties that men of necessity have to encounter. 

THE GREAT PRINCIPLE OF ETERNAL PROGRESS 

I am especially grateful for the doctrine that we shall go on, 
throughout the endless ages, far beyond the comprehension of man. I am 
indeed grateful that all has not been revealed today, because if we are 
to go on, today and tomorrow and throughout all time to come, then we 
shall be continually learning and increasing in knowledge. I find men 
occasionally who are very fond of discussing the unrevealed truths of 
the gospel. To them everything must be explained; there must be no 
mystery. This is completely out of harmony with the great principle of 
eternal progression, one of the cornerstones of the gospel of Jesus 
Christ. I am thankful that I do not understand all things ; that I have 
been given a certain field of knowledge into which I must fit this mortal 
life to the best of my ability ; and that I know for a certainty that on the 
tomorrow, when this life is passed, or perhaps before it is over, new 
light and knowledge may be given me. 

I am grateful also that man is that he "might have joy." I be- 
lieve that statement does not mean joy merely in the hereafter ; I be- 
lieve it means joy on this earth. As a people, we are and should be 
joyful, glad and happy. We should so live that those who come among 
us would observe that gladness is in our hearts, because of the truths 
that have been given us. The body, mind and spirit should be used to 
give joy, not sensual pleasure to man. However, merely knowing a doc- 
trine or a truth is not enough to make us fully happy, or to give us 
that complete joy of which Father Lehi speaks. Undoubtely, the one 
great way to achieve joy in this life is that laid down by President 
Grant this forenoon. A person, to enjoy satisfaction in life and to 
stand firmly upon his feet in the walks of life, must of necessity obey 
law which really means the proper use of knowledge. Conformity with 
law gives joy, opposition of law brings misery and unhappiness. 

OBEDIENCE 10 LAW 

How much of the law should a man obey? All of the law! Not one 



ELDER JOHN A. WIDTSOE 



29 



law should be forgotten. Let us obey all the law, with all our might 
and strength, and we shall find the joy that characterizes those who 
really understand life, and who have won the full measure of gladness. 
I am thankful that we have among the Latter-day Saints very many per- 
sons, perhaps the majority of the members, who so live that this great 
joy, which has been promised us, is theirs indeed. 

SINCERITY A DOMINANT TRAIT IN THE CHURCH AND ITS LEADERS 

Obedience to law must be impelled by simple honesty or sincerity. 
I wonder if we are quite sincere in our obedience, or if we give to the 
Lord with hidden motives in our hearts. We cannot be anything but 
sincere if we are true Latter-day Saints. Men who give of their time, 
talents or means without fully giving themselves, their hearts, only 
give in part. Throughout the history of this Church is the simple 
thought, that sincerity lies at the foundation of this organization. The 
people of the kingdom have come from all corners of the earth, after 
accepting this gospel with full sincerity, holding nothing back. The 
Prophet Joseph Smith was sincere. Brigham Young was sincere ; there 
was no doubt in their minds. They did not dissemble ; they were not 
playing a game; they were not acting a part; but sincerity is evident 
in everything that they did. Some so-called historians who have 
written about us, have laid as the foundation of their writings the 
assumption that Joseph Smith was a scoundrel who attempted to fool 
the people, and that Brigham Young became a "Mormon" because he 
loved wealth and power. That is not history. Those who will read the 
history of this Church, with honest hearts, freeing themselves of pre- 
judice, will come back to the conclusion that this work was founded in 
honesty. Any historians or purported historians who begin their work 
by assuming that the founders of this Church were dishonest or in- 
sincere, do not write history, they write travesty. History is more than 
a mere chronology of facts. History is a great interpretation of events. 
The events of "Mormonism" bring out clearly the fact that a sincere 
feeling has dominated all of its years. 

JOY COMES BY OBEYING THE WILL OF GOD 

I know, my brethren and sisters, that it is possible to be happy 
*in this Church and kingdom. I know that joy may be won by those who 
will do the will of God. I have tried, as you have, to keep the law 
fully. I bear you my testimony that as I try and try again to live the 
full law, a joy far beyond the power or the giving of man, becomes 
mine. 

A few years ago an old widow on her death bed asked : "Is this 
death ?" And the answer came ; "Perhaps it may be near." She then sat 
up in bed, asked that pillows support her, and said : "If this be 
death, then I want to testify of the joy I have had in finding and 
living the gospel of Jesus Christ. Gladness has come into my soul be- 
cause of this great gift which I found in my early womanhood." A week 



30 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



ago, on the train, I met the type of man who has found joy in this work. 
This man, not yet very old, but in the afternoon of life, told me the 
story of his life. He had been on three missions. His sons, five or 
six of them, had gone on missions. He had twice sold out his property 
that he might obey the call of the priesthood and go on missions. Now, 
in his declining years, yet vigorous and strong, he told me with what 
a joy he faced the coming years. His children were taught in the truth, 
he himself had a modest home, and the good things of life, so far as 
he needed them. I said to him: "Brother, you have sacrificed much, 
but you have also a great abundance of blessings to compensate you for 
the sacrifice you have made." He turned to me, looked into my eyes, 
and said : "Brother, I sacrificed, therefore have I the blessings. With- 
out sacrifice I should not have known the great joy which is promised 
to those who live the principle of the gospel." 

I bear witness again to the truth of this work, to its spiritual 
power and to its sufficiency in guiding men in all the affairs of life. 
I pray that we may be continually blessed by God, that we may always 
be willing to give unto him all that may be required of us, that we may 
go onward, and that the work may be prospered, in the name of the 
Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. 

A solo, entitled, "Flee as a Bird", was sung by Archibald 
Bronson. It was said that this was Brigham Young's favorite song. 



ELDER REY L. PRATT 

Of the First Council of Seventy and President of the Mexican Mission 

I am very happy, my brethren and sisters, to have the privilege 
of attending this wonderful gathering of the Church, and upon this 
opening day of our conference seeing so many people gathered together. 
Truly it is a marvelous sight to look into the faces of those who have 
congregated in this building, and to note that there are many who 
cannot find seats, and who are standing in the aisles, and some, I take 
it from their movements, who have gone to the Assembly Hall, or to 
some other place where they might receive the instruction and the 
admonition and advice that are given at this conference. I rejoice in 
this great latter-day work, and the spirit that prompts these great 
gatherings and brings these people from so great distances to be refresh- 
ed and admonished and built up in their faith in God, that they might 
learn more of all their duties to him and to their fellowmen, and go 
home to their respective abiding places and further the progress of this 
work of our Father. 

I rejoice that in the day and age in which we live, the kingdom of 
God is again established in the earth. I have an abiding faith and 
testimony that the kingdom forseen and foretold by that great man, 



ELDER REY L. PRATT

Daniel, in the interpretation he gave to the dream of the great king 
of Babylon, is now established upon the earth, as has been said at this 
conference. There is no doubt in the hearts and in the minds of 
Latter-day Saints regarding the existence of our Father in heaven. 
There is no doubt in the hearts and minds of Latter-day Saints re- 
garding the life and existence and work of our Redeemer and our 
Savior, Jesus Christ. There is absolutely no doubt today, either in the 
minds of the old or the young, as to whether this is the Church of 
God established in the earth or not, for we know that it is. I bear you 
my witness this afternoon that I know God has again spoken from 
the heavens, that he has revealed himself to his chosen servants, and 
that he has lestored the same power, keys, and Priesthood that he gave 
to his servants in all ages of the world and particularly 
to his servants in the meridian of time, when he gave to Peter and 
to his companions the keys of the kingdom. I know that the holy 
Priesthood is here upon the earth today. I rejoice, my brethren 
and sisters, that without the shadow of a doubt and without feeling 
in my heart any sense of hyprocrisy, I can say to you this after- 
noon that I know that Joseph Smith is a prophet of God, raised up 
to establish this work in the day and age in which we live. I rejoice 
that I have heard that testimony borne by my father. I rejoice that 
I have read that same testimony recorded in the words uttered by my 
grandparents, and I rejoice that I have lived long enough upon the 
earth to have heard my own son, I believe in all sincerity, bear that 
same testimony. 

I have labored now for nearly nineteen years in the missionary 
field, with your sons and daughters. There is nothing in all the wide 
world that brings me more joy or more happiness than to associate with 
them, and to hear them with all humility and in all sincerity declare 
to the world that they know these things are true. 

My brethren and sisters, I do not stop with this testimony, and I 
wish to go further this afternoon. It is of course, traditional now 
among us all, that Joseph Smith is a prophet of God, but I wish 
to continue my testimony and say I know that all who have succeeded 
him as presidents of this Church have been prophets of God; and 
while in the discharge of their duties, and living the lives of Latter- 
day, Saints, all who have occupied the positions of apostles have been 
in very deed apostles of the Lord Jesus Christ, men of the Lord, 
raised up to work in the ministry to perfect the Saints, and to be 
instruments through whom the revelations of the Lord might come, 
where they might minister, either at home or abroad. I bear you my 
witness today that, more than I know any other one thing, it seems 
to me, I know that President Heber J. Grant is a prophet of God, 
and that through him the Lord makes known his mind and will to 
this people. We can only be safe in obedience to the advice and to 
the counsel and to the admonition and to the reproof that may come 
to us through the sources of which I have spoken. 



32 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



I wish to leave with you this testimony and to say that I dedicate 
my life and my services to the Lord, and I desire to serve him by serving 
my fellow men. I rejoice at the opportunities that have come to me 
to labor in the ministry abroad. I have said before, and I stated this 
to our missionaries with whom I recently held a conference, that if 
I held no anticipation of reward in the future, I have been an 
hundredfold paid, more than perhaps I deserve, through the knowl- 
edge I have that through my teachings, I have brought hope into 
the lives of people who, before they knew me, were without hope, 
and that hope has been brought through the teaching of the principles 
of this everlasting gospel that is dearer to me than my life. 

May the Lord help us to be faithful and to be true to the great 
knowledge that has come to us, is my prayer, in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen, 

ELDER STEPHEN L. RICHARDS 

It is not considered indelicate to speak in laudation of one's country 
and extol its institutions and people. By the same token I am sure 
that it ought not to be considered indelicate to speak of one's church 
and his people, and to commend their achievements and their greatness. 
It seems to me desirable, particularly at this time, that attention should 
be called in rather liberal manner to the greatness and the richness of 
our people; this, at least in part, because an insidious and subtle effort 
seems to be made, and is now in progress, to underestimate the achieve- 
ments of this people and, in consequence, to undermine the faith and the 
confidence of those who study us and give some favorable attention to 
Us, and in particular the faith and the confidence of our young people. 

THE ATTITUDE AND SPIRIT OF OUR PEOPLE 

I believe that without arrogance and undue presumption, I am 
justified in saying that we are the greatest people on the face of the 
earth today. I recognize the fact that in making such a statement 
I should bring myself under some condemnation by those who set 
themselves up as critics of our work, our faith and our people. The 
most charitable consideration of them, however, I think is that they 
do not know and do not understand the genius of our work, and the 
attitude and spirit of our people. They cannot understand our great 
endeavor to follow in the footsteps of the Master and teach his gospel, 
unless they possess the spirit of the gospel which comes from the Lord 
himself. For while the things of man may be understood and com- 
prehended by the spirit and intelligence of man, the things of God 
cannot be understood except by the Spirit of God; and when men 
in criticism of our work, ridicule our members and belittle our high 
conceptions, they do not understand the import and significance of 
these conceptions or else, understanding them, they are prompted by 
an evil spirit to attempt to undermine the work and thwart its great 
purposes.

GREAT BY PROCESS OF NATURAL SELECTION 

I say, we are a great people. We are great by process of natural 
selection. You have heard of the blood of the Pilgrim fathers extolled. 
Sociologists today are saying that the perpetuation of that blood, the 
blood of those men who came from England and Holland and estab- 
lished this great republic, is indispensable to the perpetuation of the 
great principles of liberty, equity and justice which unaerly this mighty 
nation, its Constitution and institutions. It is my belief that the men 
who were drawn from the Old World to found this Government have 
been selected with no more care and to no higher purpose than the 
people who have been selected from all the hamlets and the villages of 
the Old and the New World to come to Zion to prepare the foundation 
of the Kingdom of the Living God. The same great qualities of in- 
dependent thinking, high manhood, power and strength, were indis- 
pensable in both instances ; so that by the heritage which we have from 
our great ancestors we are a great people. 

IN WHAT WE ARE GREAT AS A PEOPLE 

We have been great in achievement. The limited time at my 
disposal would in no sense justify me in attempting even to outline the 
remarkable acomplishments of the people of the Church within less 
than a century of time. You know in the main those accomplishments, 
and they bear witness to the integrity and the honor and the devotion 
of the Latter-day Saints. 

We are great in the message that we have to give to the world. 
That message is the greatest message that has ever come to mankind. 
It is the same message that came in the beginning of the world. It is 
the same message that will come in the end of the world, for the sal- 
vation of humankind, and the establishment of God s Kingdom. It 
contains truths which are indispensable to life, to the knowledge of life, 
and to all th at m akes life worth living. 

We are a great people in intelligence. I am fully aware of the fact 
that there might be many who would controvert that statement, because 
there are many today who measure intelligence by different standards 
and criteria than we set up for the measurement of pure, true intel- 
ligence. Intelligence, as I conceive it, is the power to grasp and as- 
similate the fundamental, essential truths of God and the universe, 
and those great truths which are embraced in the gospel of Jesus Christ 
are of such transcendent importance that they overshadow all other 
truths assuming that there is such a distinction so that the minds of men, 
which are capable of understanding, comprehending and knowing gos- 
pel truths, are possessed of the highest order of intelligence with 
which God has endowed the human family. In making that statement 
I wish in no sense to belittle that intelligence which is capable of grasp- 
ing the great truths of science and of making application of the laws 
of nature to the betterment of mankind. I rejoice in education, in its 



34 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



culture, in its refinement, and in the knowledge and power that comes 
from it, hut I maintain that the highest order of intelligence is that 
intelligence which is capable of receiving and enjoying a testimony of 
God's greatest and highest truth. 

We are a great people in power, not only in our own human power, 
although it is not inconsideralble ; but we are great in the power that 
God has given to us. He has endowed us with a portion of his own 
power, with a portion of his own strength, and with that power and 
through that power, the Church is established, this work is maintained 
and the Lord prepares the way for the coming and establishment of 
his own kingdom. This great power of the Priesthood, is the power 
without which this work would be impossible. It is the greatest power 
bestowed upon humankind. It is given for the most important offices 
and service to humanity. It is in very deed a portion of Godhood, 
and you men and boys who are privileged to possess it more nearly 
approach God in your Priesthood than in any other attribute or way. 

IN WHAT WE ARE RICH AS A PEOPLE 

Not only are we a great people, we are a rich people ; not so much 
in the things of this world, in money and possessions and property, 
but we are rich in those things which are essential to happiness and well- 
being. We are rich in humility. We recognize the power of the living 
God. We recognize our dependency on that power, and we subject 
ourselves to the laws of God and endeavor to be obedient to them. 
We are rich in virtue ; thank the Lord ! I believe there is no community 
in the broad land where there is so much of clean living, so much of 
pure thought, and a people so free from contamination by those 
practices which so generally prevail am'ong mankind. We are rich in 
that great asset of humanity, health. We are rich in health because 
we have endeavored to live the law of health, spoken of as the Word of 
Wisdom. We are rich in the love of God, and that is a great source 
of wealth. I think that is the greatest source of wealth that any 
people may enjoy. I have felt for years and years that if the love 
of God could come to the inhabitants of our own dear country, we 
should be free from the disturbances and disorders, and the problems, 
at least in large measure, which now confront us ; and having the love 
of God, we have in our hearts the love of man, illustrated and exempli- 
fied by our devotion to his interests and our sacrifices to teach him 
those vital thinigs so essential to his welfare and his happiness. We are 
rich in our homes, in the places where we live, in this wonderful 
heritage, in this great land of Zion itself. We would not exchange 
our habitat for any other place in the world. We were led to it. It 
came to us through divine appointment. It is a part of God's blessing, 
and mercy to us. Then we are rich in vision, without which a people 
perish. We have been given to see ahead. We are not relying upon 
the predictions and prognostications of men. We know where we 
are going. Thank the Lord for that great blessing. We know that the 



ELDER STEPHEN L. RICHARDS 



35 



direction we take leads to happiness and peace and joy and salvation. 
We know that the commandments which God has given to us are the 
promises upon which we may build a structure of endurance. There is 
no uncertainty with reference to our future. We know that our destiny 
is high and great, and that our objectives are all worthy our best and 
highest endeavor, a blessing that transcends our comprehension. 

OUR TREMENDOUS RESPONSIBILITY 

A people so great and so rich are surely charged with tremendous 
responsibility. We are charged with the responsibility of establishing 
and maintaining this great Church, this great instrumentality with 
all its facilities and agencies, designed to save the human family and to 
exalt men. We are charged with the responsibility of preserving, in- 
violate and free from corruption, the great truths of the gospel, of which 
we are living custodians. That is a tremendous responsibility. If we 
in any measure fail to discharge it faithfully, the very essence of 
eternal life, the gospel itself, may be in its effect and application, lost 
to mankind. But we are to preserve it and to keep it sacred and in- 
violate for the generations to come. 

We are charged with the responsibility of actually founding the 
kingdom of the living God ; we are making it here, for I believe as 
I stand here that the work we are now doing is in preparation for the 
kingdom that is to be established and presided over by the Lord God 
himself. Indeed I look upon our own work and endeavor as indicative 
of the same kind of work that shall be carried forward when the Lord 
does come to reign and to conduct the affairs of his kingdom himself. 
What a responsibility ! How much it means to us ! Men of God, 
women of Israel, I know that you thrill as citizens of this great country 
when you hear the glorious strains of the Star Spangled Banner, or the 
sacred anthem of America, and see the great flag of the country raised 
aloft. But I tell you that, thrilled as you may be by patriotic impulse, 
you are exalted as you stand under the banner of Christ to carry for- 
ward his mighty work and establish his glorious kingdom. God help 
us to be faithful to our trust, and worthy of our riches, I pray, in the 
name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER JOHN M. KNIGHT 

President of the Western States Mission 

My brethren and sisters, my heart has been made to rejoice in the 
testimonies and experiences given this day. I have pleasure in rep- 
resenting the people of the Western states mission and bringing to 
you greetings from them, also from your sons and your daughters who 
are laboring there, preaching the gospel of repentance . I have never 
associated with a finer group of men and women than those who are 



36 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



at present laboring tinder my direction. My heart has been filled to 
overflowing when I have listened to their testimonies concerning the 
establishment of God's work in the latter-days. They have an abiding 
faith in the living God, they have an abiding faith in the divine mission 
of Jesus Christ and in the atoning sacrifice that he made on Calvary, 
for the redemption and salvation of the human family. They have an 
abiding faith in the mission of the Prophet Joseph Smith, and those 
who were associated with him and those who have followed in his 
footsteps. Undaunted and unafraid they are proclaiming the message 
of salvation to the people of the Western states, and I want to say to 
you that those who are accepting their message are receiving the same 
spirit and the same testimony that have come into the lives of all Latter- 
day Saints who have obeyed the commandments of our eternal Father. 
They are ; not afraid to lay down the gauntlet and say to men and women 
everywhere : "If you will repent of your sins and yield obedience to the 
saving ordinances of the gospel, you shall know of the doctrine whether 
it is of God or whether we speak of ourselves." The testimony of 
hundreds of men and women who have received the ordinances of the 
gospel is to the effect that the Spirit of God has come into their lives, 
and all doubt has been removed from their souls. They have been made 
happy in the knowledge that God lives, and that his promises are true. 

I would like to relate just one or two experiences that ihave come 
to me from the men and women who have received the message of the 
gospel in their hearts and have obeyed it. I do this because several 
have said to me, since I came to attend the sessions of this conference : 
"Are those whom you are baptizing worth while? Are they faithful 
Latter-day Saints? Do they keep the commandments of God?" I want 
to say to you that I have seen genuine faith manifest on the part of many 
who have accepted the gospel and who are far removed from our or- 
ganized branches, isolated if you please, perhaps a single family alone 
in the community. 

I call to mind one family in the state of Wyoming, the qnly mem- 
bers of the Church in the small community where they reside, baptized 
a year ago last February, a widow with eight children, six boys and 
two girls. Just before Christmas of last year I received a letter from 
the oldest boy, nineteen years of age, to this effect. Said he: "Elder 
Knight, I believe that I am being neglected. I have Deen a member 
of the Church almost a year, and I have not yet been called upqn a 
mission. I want to go and preach thei gospel. I may not measure 
up to the standard of the missionaries that you have in Wyoming, but I 
will do my very best." Realizing that his mother is a widow, I wrote 
her a letter and asked her what should be done. She answered : "I 
knew that my boy had written you. I make approximately one hundred 
twenty-five dollars a month doing hospitalization work. The desire' of 
my heart is that all of my boys may do missionary work for the Church 
of Jessus Christ, and if I can pay a little each month I should like to 



ELDER JOHN M. KNIGHT 



37 



have my boy go as soon as he is out of school this year." Since then 
I have received several letters from that mother. In one of them she 
said that slhe had never earned more than one hundred fifty dollars 
in a single month, but on the first of February I received a letter from 
her in which she enclosed her tithing for the month of January — thirty 
dollars and fifty-cents. Said she: "Surely the Lord has been good 
to me. Last month, I made more than twice as much as I have ever 
made in a single mointh, before, three-hundred five dollars ;" and in 
the month of March I received another letter in which, she said : "En- 
closed find my thithing forty dollars. I made four hundred dollars in 
February." I will say that that young man will have the opportunity of 
going on a mission and preaching the gospel of repentaince. The Lord 
is opening up the way for that widow woman and not only the one boy, 
but- others will follow, and they will make valued defenders of the 
faith. 

In the city of Pueblo, three weeks ago tomorrow, another little 
woman came to me and said : "President Knight, I am ready to mort- 
gage my home that my oldest boy might have the desire of his heart 
to fill a mission to the nations of the world." I could mention many 
other circumstances of like character. One young man recently joined 
the Church in the state of Nebraska. He was prominently identified 
with one of the protestant organizations. Since his baptism he has 
taken an active part with our missionaries and now is spending two to 
four hours each day, tracting his home town and bearing witness that 
God has heard his prayers and that he knows the gospel taught by the 
Latter-day Saints is the power of God unto salvation. These men and 
women who are receiving the gospel are worth while. The same 
witness has come into their lives that has come into your lives, and 
•the lives of all who have accepted the gospel and obeyed the com- 
mandments of our eternal Father. I rejoice in my association with 
these men and women because of their faith and their devotion. 

We have been fortunate in baptizing a large number of converts. 
Among the number baptized three ex-ministers of the gospel. I asked 
one of them why he joined the Church, and he said : "For years I have 
been looking for a satisfying religion, and I did not find it in any of 
the protestant churches, neither did I find it in the Catholic church ; 
but when I investigated "Mormonism" there came a new light into my 
life, and I am happy to have come in contact with your missionaries." 
He said further: "I want all the books that have been written by your 
people, because, though I preached the gospel for many years, I realize 
how little I know about the great plan of salvation. The Bible has be- 
come a new revelation to me. Every time I open its lids, new in- 
spiration comes into my life, and I rejoice that I have at last found 
the truth." All these things give evidence to me that these men and 
women have been converted to the gospel of the Master. 

I do not desire to occupy more time. I rejoice in the blessings of

,fhe gospel. I know, as I know I live, that it is true, that God lives, 
that Jesus Christ is his Son, the Redeemer of the world, the only name 
hy which salvation may come to his children here upon the earth. I 
know, too, as I know that T live, that Joseph was the instrument in the 
hands of 'God of establishing again his work in, the earth. He was the 
pioneer, the path-finder, he blazed the way and gave to the children of 
men in our day a new faith in God and in (his glorious work. I know, 
too. that the men who preside in Israel today are prophets of God, in- 
spired to direct the destiny of Israel. May God bless us all that we may 
be obedient to their counsel, and that we may have power to reduce to 
practice in our lives the instructions' that are given to us by our file 
leaders, that is my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

ELDER B. H. ROBERTS 

Of the First Council of Seventy, and President 
of the Eastern States Mission 

I think we have been very fortunate today in the solos that 
have been rendered. I was especially thrilled, as I presume you 
were, by the first solo this morning, the opening line of which was . 

"Man, though dead, shall arise again." 

That declaration brought to my mind another great prophecy 
on the same subject, to which T think it will be profitable for us to 
pay some attention. Permit me to make a little explanation about 
it. Israel, both in ancient times and in modern times, were a 
people who endured great sorrows, both as a nation and as a people. 
They had war, famine, pestilences and many and great tribulations. 
In the days of Isaiah, the Prophet, their sorrows seemed to reach 
a climax, and this great Prophet of Israel presented their sorrows 
to the Lord, undoubtedly for the purpose of obtaining some word 
of comfort, some hope that would lighten their burdens and bring 
somewhat of joy into their existence. He voiced the sorrows of 
Israel in the following language: 

"Lord, in trouble have they visited thee, they pour out a prayer when thy 
chastening was upon them. 

"L'ke as a woman with child, that draweth near the time of her delivery, 
is in pain, and crieth out in her pangs ; so have wq been in thy sight,. O Lord ;" 

And the Lord answered the Prophet in the way of comfort and 

said : 

"Thy dead men shall live, together with my dead body shall they arise. 
Awake and sing, ye that dwell in dust : for thy dew is as the dew of herbs, and 
the earth shall cast out the dead." (Isaiah.) 

This was the word of comfort unto Israel, the renewal of the 
promise of immortality, of resurrection unto immortality. I pray 
you be reminded here who it is speaking. It is the Jehovah of the 
Jews, "the Lord God Omnipotent." Here was a prophecy: "Thy 
dead men shall live, together with my dead body shall they 
arise." And then comes the song, the praise and thanksgiving: 



ELDER B. H. ROBERTS 



39 



"Awake and sing, ye that dwell in dust; and the earth shall cast 
out her dead !" 

Seven hundred years passed away, and then came the fulfil- 
ment of Isaiah's prophecy: 

"And behold the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the 
top to the bottom, and the earth did quake and the rocks rent and 
the graves were opened, and many of the Saints which slept arose 
and came out of their graves after his [the Christ'st] resurrection, 
and went into the Holy City, and appeared unto many." (Matt. 27 :51-3.) 

* "Thy dead men shall live, together with my dead body shall 
they arise. * * * The earth shall cast out her dead." Here 
we have the prophecy of Isaiah and also its fulfilment. And yet 
we are living in a day when those who are supposed to name the 
name of Christ in reverence and faith, are not only denying the 
Deity of "the Lord God Omnipotent," as he was revealed in the 
flesh, but are equally strong in their denial of this great fact of 
the gospel of Jesus Christ, the resurrection from the dead. Com- 
paratively few men in the religious world, believe this unique doc- 
trine of the Christian faith, the literal, physical resurrection of the 
dead. Many cults and philosophies teach that in some way or 
other there may be a continuation of the life principle, and even of 
personality after death; but it was reserved as the peculiar and 
glorious doctrine of the Christian faith to teach the reality of the 
resurrection from the dead, the reuniting of the spirit and body 
after death. If this is not the head of the corner in the building 
of the Christian faith, it is at least one of the very chief founda- 
tion stones. St. Paul teaches us that, and shows us that if there 
be no resurrection of the dead, then the Christian faith is vain, and 
is all a mockery. Let me point that out to you a little. 

In his discourse upon this subject, showing how fundamental 
this principle is to the gospel of Jesus Christ, Paul of the early 
Christian writers was the first to mass the testimony extant in 
his day. You must remember that the gospels, as we now have 
them — Matthew, Mark, Luke and John — with their wonderful testi- 
monies concerning the resurrection of the dead, were not in 
existence at the time that the epistles were being written. Not the 
.gospels, but the epistles, are the first Christian documents of the 
meridian dispensations, and I think it quite true as an historical 
fact, that Paul was the first to mass the testimony on this subject. 
He said in his first letter to the Corinthians : 

"I delivered unto you first of 1 ' all that which I also received, how that 
Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; 

"And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day, according 
to the scriptures : 

"And that he was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve; 

"After that, he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once ; of whom 
the greater part remain unto this present, but some are fallen asleep." 

That is, some had died ; but he could appeal to the testimony of 



40 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



five hundred brethren who at once had beheld the resurrected 
Christ. 

"After that, he was seen of James; then of all the apostles. 

"And last of all he was seen of me also, as of one born out of due time." 

And now, upon this state of facts he proceeds to reason, and 
the keenness and the sureness of his logic cannot be questioned. I 
pray you hearken to it : 

"Now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead, how say some 

among you that there is no resurrection of the dead. 

"But if there be no resurrection of the dead, then is Christ not risen: 
"And if Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain, and your faith is 

also vain. 

"Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God; because we have testified 
of God that he raised up Christ; whom he raised not up, if so be that the dead 
rise not." 

Could you escape that conclusion? 

"And if Christ be not raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins. 
"Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished. 
"If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most 
miserable." 

And is not that just as true now as it was when Paul conducted 
the Saints at Corinth through this process of reasoning to that 
awful conclusion? Down into the very depths of despair does his 
reasoning bring us, if it so be that Christ did not actually rise from 
the dead. Behold, how hopeless, how vain is the faith of men in 
Christ if they eliminate from the scheme of his religion the doc- 
trine of physical resurrection from the dead. Thank God the apos- 
tles did not leave either the Corinthian Saints or those of us who 
come after them in that slough of despond to which he had con- 
ducted them ; but having brought us down to where we may see 
into the very depth of despair, now he proceeds to build upon the 
opposite supposition — no, not "supposition," but the truth ; namely, 
that Christ has risen from the dead. Hearken to him : 

"But now Christ is risen from the dead and become the firstfruits of them 
that slept. 

"For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the 
dead. 

"For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive. 

"But every man in his own order ; Christ the firstfruits ; afterward they that 
are Christ's at his coming. 

"Then cometh the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, 
even the Father; when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and 
power. 

"For he must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet. 
"The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death." 

That is the Christian faith; and yet Christians of today, in 
large part, do not believe it ; a few do, but only a very few. And 
believe me, Latter-day Saints, that among the many things required 
of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, one of the 



ELDER B. H. ROBERTS 



41 



many duties laid upon us in the preaching of the gospel in this 
dispensation, is this responsibility of being God's witnesses in 
the world for the truth, for the reality of this doctrine of the 
resurrection from the dead. Not in the survival of some essence 
or spiritual principle, but in a real life hereafter, in which spirit and 
body shall be reunited, and, as the Christ lived physically after he 
rose from the dead, and was a physical as well as a spiritual per- 
sonage, so too shall men now dead become : "Your dead men shall 
live again, together with my dead body," sayeth God, "they shall 
arise from their graves." That is the word of God, and I care not 
for the philosophies of men, nor their attempt to tell us that it is 
a matter of impossibility for them to be resurrected. If the mate- 
rial particles of this body that we call ours shall be preserved as 
peculiar to the spirit that has laboriously gathered that body 
through life and made it the garment of our spirits, I care not what 
becomes of those particles so far as our sight and touch may be 
concerned. I place my faith in the word and promise of Jehovah 
before he tabernacled in the flesh, that men should arise from the 
dead ; that together with his dead body they should arise and live ; 
and with all my heart I believe God competent and able to fulfil 
his promises. "Though a man be dead, he shall arise again." And 
as a poet has said, "Eternal form shall still divide eternal mind 
from all beside," and we shall know each other, and have asso- 
ciations that shall, when purified, be holy, and shall minister to 
our joy through all the ages that shall endure. That is my faith, 
in this great doctrine of the Christian faith, emphasized in this new 
dispensation of the gospel whereof we are heralds and witnesses. 
This is my testimony, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The choir and congregation sang, "High on the mountain top," 
and prayer was offered by Elder Levi S. Udall, president of the St. 
Johns stake of Zion. 

Conference adjourned until Sunday morning at 10 o'clock. 



SECOND DAY 
MORNING SESSION 

Promptly at 10 o'clock on Sunday morning, April 5, 1925, Presi- 
dent Heber J. Grant opened the meeting by announcing that the choir 
and congregation would sing, "We thank thee, O God, for a pro- 
phet." 

After the singing, Elder Junius F. Wells, assistant Church his- 
torian, offered the opening prayer. 

The hymn, "An angel from on high" was sung by Hyrum J. 
Christiansen and Edna Gotberg, with the choir. 

PRESIDENT ANTHONY W. IVINS 

As I stand before this vast congregation this morning, and con- 
template my early experiences upon this block, when the Latter-day 
Saints were few in number, with poor shelter, and very inferior ac- 
comodations compared with that which we at present enjoy, I am over- 
whelmed with gratitude as I think of that which the Lord has accom- 
plished, for I see in this gathering the fulfilment of his word, and the 
words of his servants, the prophets uttered more than four-thousand 
years ago, and come to understand my own littleness, my own inability, 
my utter dependence upon the Lord my God, for without his aid we are 
helpless, he has done it. It has not been the work of man, although 
devoted men and women have been the instruments in the hands of the 
Lord in the accomplishment of that which we see before us this morn- 
ing. Therefore, I give praise and glory and honor to God for all that 
I am, all that I hope to be, all that we are, all the we can hope to be, 
for our dependence is upon him. 

DO YOU BELIEVE THE PROPHETS? 

I desire, my brethren and sisters, as a preface to the remarks 
which I make, to read briefly from the second general epistle of the 
Apostle Peter to the Church, as follows : 

"We have also a more sure word of prophecy, whereunto ye do well that 
ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, 
and the day star arise in your hearts. Knowing this first, that no> prophecy 
of the scripture is of any private interpretation. For the prophecy came not in 
old time by the will of man, but holy men of God spoke as they were moved 
by the Holy Ghost." 

At the time when the Apostle Paul was arraigned before King 
Agrippa, to answer to charges which had been preferred against him, 
after recounting the circumstances of his conversion, he turned to 
Agrippa and said: 



PRESIDENT ANTHONY W. IVINS 



43 



"King Agrippa, believest thou the prophets? I know that thou believest." 
Then Agrippa said to Paul, "almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian." And 
Paul said : "I would to God that net only thou, but that all who hear me this 
day, were both almost, and altogether such as I am, save these bonds." 

I desire to paraphrase these words as follows: My brethren and 
sisters, do you believe the words of the prophets as they have been 
handed down to us through the holy Scripture? 1 know that you 
believe, and I would that all of you understood them, and compre- 
hended their importance and application to us, not as I understand them, 
but more fully and comprehensively. 

NEED OF KNOWING THE HAND-DEALINGS OF GOD WITH MAN 

To properly comprehend the great plan of human redemption, de- 
signed by the Father for the blessing of his children, it is necessary 
that we be familiar with his hand-dealings with the people of the 
world, from the beginning of time, as we count it, until the present. 
It is not sufficient that we familiarize ourselves alone with the dispen- 
sation in which we live, important though that be. We must know 
something of the past, as history has written it, the present as we see 
and understand it, and the future as the prophets have declared it. 
Without this grouping of the past, the present and the future, our 
vision will be restricted, and incomplete. 

LOOKING BACK FOUR THOUSAND YEARS 

I desire, my brethren and sisters,, to take you back more than 
four thousand years, to a period of time when- an event occurred 
which was of transcendent importance to us, when a promise was made 
by the Lord which has not yet been fully fulfilled, but toward the ful- 
filment of which we are rapidly moving. 

THE PROMISE TO ABRAHAM 

It was about 122 years after the deluge that the Lord called Abram. 
who at that time was seventy-five years of age, and a direct descendant 
of Shem, the chosen son of Noah, commanding him to go out from the 
country of his kindred, and from his father's house, into a land which 
he promised to give him, and to his posterity after him, for an ever- 
lasting inheritance. In obedience to the word of the Lord, Abram 
went from Haran, to which place he had been taken by his father, from 
Ur of Chaldea, and pitched his tent in the land of Canaan. Twenty- 
four years later the Lord spoke to him as follows: 

"And when Abram was ninety years old and nine, the Lord appeared to 
Abram, and said unto him: l am the Almighty God. Walk before me, and be 
thou perfect. 

"And I will make my covenant between me and thee, and will multiply 

thee exceedingly. 

"And Abram fell on his face, and God talked with him, saying, 

"As for pie, behold my covenant is with thee, and thou shalt be a father of 

many nations.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



"Neither shall thy name he called any more Ahram, hut thy name shall be 
Abraham, for a father of many nations I have made thee. 

"And I will make thee exceeding fruitful, and I will make nations of thee, 
and kings shall come out of thee." 

god's promise never fails 

We have here a promise made by the Lord, which, judged by hu- 
man standards, was impossible of fulfilment. Abraham was an hun- 
dred years old, and his wife, Sarah, ninety years of age, a supposedly 
barren woman, but the Lord had spoken, and his word never fails. 
Isaac was born, and the Lord repeated to him the promise made to his 
father. Isaac in turn, became the father of Jacob, through whose 
lineage, and the twelve sons who were born to him, the foundation 
was laid for the twelve tribes of Israel, the progenitors of a mighty 
nation. 

THE HISTORY OF ISRAEL AND THE STORY OF JOSEPH 

To follow the history of this interesting people from that time to 
the present in detail, would be impossible in the short time which is at 
my disposal. You who are familiar with the story know that twelve 
sons were born to Jacob, six of whom, Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah, 
Issachar and Zebulon, were the sons of Leah, his first wife. Joseph 
and Benjamin the sons of Rachel ; Dan and Naphtali the sons of Bilha, 
the handmaid of Rachel; and Gad and Asher, the sons of Zilpah, the 
handmaid of Leah. 

You are familiar with the story of Joseph, who was sold by his 
brethren to passing Ishmaelites who carried the boy into Egypt, and 
sold him to Potiphar, a captain of the king's guard. How he was 
cast into prison, and finally released and made the vice-regent of the 
king, the most powerful personage, except the Pharaoh, in all Egypt. 
You know how famine came to the land, which made it necessary for 
Jacob to send his sons to Egypt to procure food, where these men 
discovered that the governor of all the land was their younger brother, 
whom they had sold into slavery, and after returning to Canaan brought 
down their father and all of their possessions into Egypt, and were 
established in the land of Goshen, where they became a numerous people. 

But Egypt was not the heritage of Israel. Naturally they would 
have remained there and been absorbed by the Egyptians, but the Lord 
had decreed otherwise. He had given them Palestine as the land of 
their inheritance, and their return to that land was inevitable, even 
though it were against their will. 

After remaining in Egypt more than two hundred years, some 
chronologists say four hundred, the Lord delivered them from the 
bondage of the Egyptians, through his servant Moses, and under the 
leadership of Joshua they again entered and took possession of the 
promised land, a great people. From the seventy souls who went into 
Goshen with Jacob, there went out 603,500 men more than twenty years

of age, men able to bear arms, probably not less than three millions 
ot people in all. 

The history of the Israelitish people, from the time they crossed 
the river Jordan, under Joshua, and subdued Jericho, until the estab- 
lishment of the kingdom, under Saul, about four hundred years, is 
one of almost constant war and contention, which resulted in the 
subjugation of neighboring kingdoms and peoples, until Israel, under 
David, became the possessors of Palestine from Dan on the north to 
Beersheba on the south. 

It was under Solomon that Israel reached the zenith of her power 
and glory as a nation and kingdom. One hundred and twenty years had 
elapsed from the establishment of the kingdom, under Saul, until the 
division of the nation, which occured during the reign of Rehoboam, the 
son of Solomon. Five hundred years in all, since the return from 
Egypt. Years of conflict among themselves and with other peoples, 
years of faithlesness on the part of Israel, and suffering because of 
their transgression and indifference to the words of the prophets whom 
the Lord sent among them to call them back into the old way of right- 
eousness, but they said, we will not walk therein. When the watchmen 
whom the Lord placed on the towers of Zion sounded the warning trum- 
pet they said, we will not hearken. 

THE DAY OF THE PROPHETS 

It was the day of Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel and others of the 
prophets of old, through whom the Lord strove to keep the people 
in the path of righteousness and justice, the only road that leads to 
ultimate success, for final truimph has never been achieved and never 
will be, by a nation which denies the living God, and departs from the 
path which he has marked out for us to follow. In their pride of 
conquest Israel saw, in the glory which had come to them, fulfilment of 
the promise made by the Lord to Abraham. He had given them the 
land of promise, from north to south, and east to west, they were in 
possession of it, and in their pride believed themselves strong enough 
to hold it forever. 

THE DISSOLUTION OF ISRAEL 

1 The dissolution of Israel, as a great nation, commenced when the 
ten tribes, under the leadership of Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, broke 
away from Judah and Benjamin and established the kingdom of Israel, 
with Samaria as its capital city, while Judah and Benjamin, with a 
part, at least, of the tribes of Simeon and Dan retained Jerusalem as the 
capital city of their kingdom. 

Both nations rapidly relapsed into idolatry, Israel to the worship of 
the golden calf of the Egyptians, while Judah, to a great extent, turned 
to the worship of Bel of the Babylonians, and the idolatrous gods of the 
nations with which they were surrounded. 

In this condition Israel continued until about sevtn hundred years 



46 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



before Christ, when the Assyrian armies, under Sennacherib over- 
came the Israelitish armies, captured Samaria, carried the Ten Tribes 
captive into Assyria, at the head of the Euphrates, and brought people 
from their own country whom they established in the cities of northern 
Palestine, and the identity of Israel as a distinct people, was lost to the 
world. 

Judah continued to maintain a semblance of power for more than 
one hundred years after the fall of Israel, when they suffered the same 
fate. Judea was overrun by the Babylonian armies under Nebuchad- 
nezzar, Jerusalem taken, the temple desecrated, and despoiled of its 
wealth, and Judah carried captive into Babylon, as their brethren had 
been carried into Assyria. 

THE CHRISTIAN ERA USHERED IN 

This hasty and imperfect review brings us to the ushering in of the 
Christian Era. 

After the fall of the Babylonian kingdom to the armies of Media 
and Persia. King Cyrus permitted the Jews to return from Babylon 
to Palestine and rebuild their city and temple which had been destroyed 
by Nebuchadnezzar. With great enthusiasm this work was under- 
taken, and it appears that the Jews who returned from the Babylonian 
captivity showed greater faith in the God of their fathers than had 
been manifested before they were carried way. 

THE FATE OF THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL FORETOLD 

The fate which befell the House of Israel had been plainly out- 
lined by the prophets whom the Lord had sent to warn them that the 
penalty of disobedience would be the dissolution of the nation, and 
that they would be taken from the land of their inheritance, and scattered 
among the strange and unbelieving nations of the world. A final ful- 
filment of this prophecy occured when, about one hundred years after 
the birth of the Redeemer, Judea was trodden down by the Roman 
armies under Vespasian and his son Titus, Jerusalem taken, the temple 
destroyed, and the Jews scattered among the nations of the world, 
where they have remained until the present day. 

The prophets Zechariah and Ezekiel had declared that the shep- 
herds would neglect the flock, and that the sheep would be scattered, 
and become the prey of strange nations. To all human appearance, 
judged by every law of human reasoning, the promise made to Abra- 
ham had failed, he had been promised that Palestine should be the 
everlasting heritage of his children, and now they held dominion over 
no part of it. The end, it appeared, had come, the words of the prophets 
had been literally fulfilled, the promise made by the Lord if ever to 
be realized was still future. 

ISRAEL NOT FORSAKEN OF THE LORD SHALL BE GATHERED AGAIN 

Notwithstanding the fact that the Israelitish people had been scat- 



PRESIDENT ANTHONY W. IVINS 



47 



tered and lost to the world, to become the prey of strange and un- 
believing nations, the Lord had not forgotten nor forsaken them. He 
remembered the covenant made with their father Abraham, and de- 
creed that it should be verified. The prophet Jeremiah, six hundred 
years before the birth of Christ, speaking upon this subject, declared 
that the Lord who scattered Israel would gather him again, in these 
words : 

"Hear the word of the Lord, O ye nations, and declare it in the isles afar 
off, and say : He that scattered Israel will gather him, and keep him, as a shep- 
herd does his flock. 

"For the Lord'hath redeemed Jacob and ransomed him from the hand of 
him who was stronger than he. 

"Therefore they shall come and sing in the height of Zion, and shall flow 
together to the goodness of the Lord, for wheat and for wine and for oil and for 
the young of the flock and of the herd; and their soul shall be as a watered 
garden and they shall not sorrow any more." 

Isaiah, seven hundred years before the birth of the Redeemer, 
referring to this same matter, said : 

"And in that day [be spoke cf the Latter-days] there shall be a root of 
Jesse which shall stand for an ensign of the people; to it shall the Gentiles 
seek and his rest shall be glorious. And.it shall come to pass in that day the 
Lord shall set his hand again the second time to recover the remnant of his 
people who shall be left from Assyria and from Egypt and from Pathros and 
from Cush and from Elam and from Shinar and from Hamath and from the 
islands of the sea. 

"And he shall set up an ensign for the nations, and assemble the outcasts 
of Israel, and gather together the dispersed of Judah, from the four corners 
of the earth. 

"The envy also of Ephraim shall depart and the adversaries of Judah 
shall be cut off: Ephraim shall not envy Judah, and Judah shall not vex 
Ephraim." 

CHRIST* S PROMISE TO ISRAEL PRIOR TO HIS CRUCIFIXION 

During his ministry among the Nephite people, upon this conti- 
nent, after his resurrection from the dead, the Redeemer of the world, 
ref ering to this matter used the following language : 

"I will remember the covenant which 1 have made with my people ; and I 
have covenanted with them that I would gather them together in my own 
due time, that I would give unto them again the land of their fathers for their 
inheritance, which is the land of Jerusalem, which is the promised land unto 
them forever, saith the Father. 

"And it shall come to pass that the time cometh when the fulness of my 
gospel shall be preached among them ; and they shall believe in me, that I am 
Jesus Christ, the son of God, and shall pray unto the Father in my name." 

This entire chapter treats the subject to which I am referring, but 
I need not read further from it. 

More definite and direct on this subject than any other, and to 
which I desire more particularly to call your attention, are the words 
of the Redeemer, just prior to his crucifixion. He called his disciples 



48 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



together, and in answer to questions which they propounded, spoke 
as follows: 

"And now ye behold this temple which is in Jerusalem which ye call the 
House of God, and your enemies say that this house shall never fall, but verily 
I say unto you that desolation shall come upon this generation as a thief in the 
night, and this people shall be destroyed, and scattered among all nations. 

"And this temple which ye now see shall be threwn down, that there shall 
not be left one stone upon another." 

This was literally fulfilled at the time of the taking of Jerusalem 
by Titus, the son of Vespasian. 

"And it shall come to pass that this generation of Jews shall not pass away 
until every desolation which I have told you concerning them shall come to pass. 

"Ye say that ye know that the end of the world cometh, ye say also that ye 
know that the heavens and the earth shall pass away, and in this ye say truly, 
for so it is, but these things which I have told you shall not pass away until 
all shall be fulfilled. 

"And this have I told you concerning Jerusalem, and when that day shall 
come shall a remnant be scattered among all nations ; but they shall be gathered 
again ; but they shall remain until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled. 

"And in that day shall be heard wars and rumors of wars, and the whole 
earth shall be in commotion, and men's hearts shall fail them, and they shall 
say that Christ delayed his coming until the end of the earth. 

"And the love of man shall wax cold, and iniquity shall abound. And when 
the times of the Gentiles is come in; a light shall break forth among them 
that sit in darkness, and it shall be the fulness of my gospel; but they 
perceive not the light, and receive it not, but turn their hearts from me, because 
of the precepts of men. 

"And in that generation shall the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled." 

That the final destiny of Judah was different to that of Joseph is 
plainly indicated by the blessing pronounced upon him by his father. 

THE BLESSINGS OF JACOB 

Just before his death, Jacob called his sons to him and gave to 
each his last blessing. Upon Judah he pronounced the blessing of 
leadership, declaring that the scepter of power should not depart from 
his house until the coming of Shiloh, to whom the Jews looked forward 
as their final king. 

When he laid his hands upon the head of Joseph, he said : 

"Joseph is a fruitful bough, even a fruitful bough by a well, whose branches 
run over the wall. The blessings of thy father have prevailed above the bless- 
ings of my progenitors, unto the utmost bounds of the everlasting hills. They 
shall be upon the head of him who was separated from his brethren." 

The promise made to Abraham gave to him and his posterity after 
him the land of Canaan, which was to be the land of his inheritance, 
and this promise was renewed to Isaac, and to Jacob, and the Lord, 
through the latter, enlarged this promise to Joseph, his heritage, like 
a fruitful bough by a well, whose roots are well watered, ran over the 
wall, and extended beyond the heritage of Judah to the utmost bounds 
of the Everlasting Hills, to America, where the Zion of our God is 
to be established.

THE DESTINY OF ISRAEL PLAINLY INDICATED 

The scripture which I have just read indicates plainly the un- 
changable decree of the Lord regarding the destiny of the Israelitish 
people. Scattered and lost to the world as they have been, they are not 
lost to the Lord, nor has he forgotten the covenant which he made 
with their father Abraham, and which was reconfirmed upon the heads 
of Isaac and Jacob. 

THE WORK BEGUN IN THIS DISPENSATION 

With the opening of the present gospel dispensation, now nearly 
one hundred years ago, the Lord commenced the work which is destined 
to result in the establishment of Ephraim, and other descendants of 
Joseph upon this continent, where the Zion of our God is to be estab- 
lished, and the restoration of the Jews to Palestine, the land of their 
fathers. 

With the organization of the Church the Lord made plain the duty 
of its members. Men holding the restored priesthood, with its keys 
of authority, were sent into every country where they were permitted to 
go, proclaiming the opening of a new gospel dispensation, calling the 
people to repentance, and bearing witness that the mountain of the 
Lord's House was to be established in the tops of the mountains, and to 
be exalted above the hills, where we are today and that people from 
all nations should flow unto it, in order that they might be taught the 
way of the Lord, and learn to walk in his paths. 

THE JEWS TO BE RESTORED TO THE PROMISED LAND 

The promise made by the Lord, regarding the restoration of the 
Jews to the Promised Land was not overlooked. At the conference of 
the Church, held on the 6th of April, 1840, now eighty-five years ago, 
Orson Hyde, a member of the Council of the Twelve, and Tohn E. 
Page were called to go on a special mission to Jerusalem, for the 
purpose of dedicating the Holy Land for the latter-day gathering of 
the remnant of Judah. John E. Page failed in the accomplishment of 
the mission which was assigned him, .but Orson Hyde, after surmount- 
ing-many difficulties, a year and a half later knelt upon the Mount of 
Olives, and dedicated Palestine as the gathering place of the scattered 
remnant of Judah, and this servant of the Lord, moved upon by the 
spirit of prophecy, declared that inasmuch as it was by political power 
and influence that the Jews were scattered, it would be by political 
power and influence that they would be gathered, and that England 
was destined to be the nation which would take the leading part in the 
work of restoration. 

More than seventy-five years had elapsed, almost a generation, 
as the scripture counts time, since the light of the gospel had 
broken forth among those who sat in darkness, since Orson Hyde dedi- 
cated the land of Palestine for the latter-day gathering of scattered

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Tudah, and the Holy Land still remained under the dominion of the 
Turk, the star and crescent still floated from the minaret of a Moslem 
Mosque, where the temple of Solomon once stood. 

THE GREAT WAR AND BRITISH PROTECTORATE 

Then came the great world war, and final peace at Versailles when 
Great Britain was given the responsibility of establishing and maintain- 
ing a protectorate over the Holy Land. The British armies, it is true, 
had already occupied Jerusalem, but it was with the signing of the 
treaty of Versailles that the first definite step was taken looking to the 
fulfilment of the words of the prophets, who had declared the re- 
demption of Israel, and the restoration of Judah to the lands of their 
fathers, thousands of years ago. 

INTEREST OF THE JEWS IN THE RESTORATION 

The interest manifested by the Jewish people in the restoration of 
Palestine has few parallels in the history of the world. One is re- 
minded of the zeal which their fathers showed as they returned from 
Babylon to Jerusalem to rebuild their city and temple, when women 
as well as men worked, and gave lavishly of their most cherished pos- 
sessions that the task might be accomplished. 

Jewish societies have been organized in various parts of the world, 
having for their purpose the creation of a publicly recognized, legally 
acquired home in Palestine, and the building up of the Jewish home- 
land in the Canaan of their fathers. Many millions of dollars have 
been subscribed by Jews throughout the world, to be used in the pur- 
chase of land, and the development of the dormant resources of the 
country. 

WHAT HAS BEEN ACCOMPLISHED 

From statistics which I have gathered, I wish to read the following, 
which shows a part only of that which has been accomplished : 

Immigration 

At the close of the war there were about fifty thousand Jews in 
Palestine. At the close of 1924 this number had been doubled, and 
latest reports? tell us that Tews are pouring into Palestine at the rate 
of more than two thousand per month. 

Agriculture 

At the close of the war not more than one hundred thousand acre3 
of land were in Jewish ownership in Palestine ; since then through the 
Zionist movement as much more has been added by purchase. Swamps 
have been drained, sand dunes leveled, and agricultural exports, which 
before the war were practically nothing, now amount to more than 
twenty- five millions of dollars annually. Eighty-nine Jewish agri- 
cultural colonies are being developed. 



PRESIDENT ANTHONY W . IV INS 



51 



Schools 

One hundred and twenty schools have been established, as follows : 
39 kindergartens, 65 elementary schools, 5 secondary schools, 3 teachers 
training colleges, 4 technical schools, and 5 manual training schools. 
These schools have 497 teachers, and a large number of students in 
attendance. Besides these schools several agricultural training schools 
have been established, and a University at Jerusalem which was dedi- 
cated last week by Lord Balfour, has been established on a site which 
cost sixty thousand dollars. 

Large sums have been expended in the construction of roads, 
hydro-electric power plants are in course of construction, hospitals have 
been erected, and provision made for the care of the indigent and un- 
fortunate. According to the reports which have" been rendered there 
was expended from the first of April, 1921, to June 30, 1924, more 
than thirty five millions of dollars in the development of this under- 
taking. 

A movement such as this cannot fail to excite the interest and 
admiration of the civilized world. The Hebrew people have suffered 
during the past centuries as no- other people have ever suffered, so 
far as my study and observation entitle me to judge. They have been 
scattered among strangers, where they have been denied the right of 
citizenship, and participation in the commercial and industrial activities 
of the people. They have been ruthlessly robbed of that which they have 
honestly acquired by the labor of their own hands. Worse than all, 
pogroms have been declared against them, when the protection of the 
law has been officially declared to be inoperative, and permission given 
to wicked men and women to despoil them of their goods, and even 
deprive them of life itself. 

THE MOVEMENT MUST ELICIT PRAISE AND SYMPATHY 

The wonder is that they have survived and maintained their nation- 
ality during all these centuries of affliction, and now that they are under- 
taking to establish a home in the land of their fathers, where they may 
live in peace, and be a blessing to the non-progressive people who have 
so long dominated it, they certainly must elicit the praise and sympathy 
of all right thinking people. 

THE HAND OF THE LORD IN IT 

From a human point of view it is a movement of great interest, 
but to me the one outstanding feature is the manifest hand-dealing of 
the Lord, which I see in it, and which they themselves do not fully 
realize. It will come in a natural way, it may be England, it may be 
some other nation, but it will be the Lord who will direct. 

THE LORD WILL USE THE NATIONS TO ACCOMPLISH HIS PURPOSE 

When Cyrus led the victorious Medio-Persian army to the over- 
throw of the great Babylonian kingdom he was not aware that he was 



52 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



fulfilling the words of the prophets who had lived long before, but he 
did so in wondrous detail. When Alexander of Macedon halted his 
army, after he had crossed the Dardanelles and won the battle of Gran- 
icus, and notwithstanding the protest of his gene)ral=> delayed his 
campaign against Persia, in order that he might besiege and finally 
destroy Tyre, he had no knowledge of the fact that the prophets had 
declared that the greatest maritime city of the world should be destroyed 
in just that manner, but it was nevertheless true. 

So will the Lord continue to use the nations for the accomplish- 
ment of his purposes, until the words of his servants the prophets have 
all been fulfilled, until Zion is established, Judea redeemed, and his 
will done upon earth, as it is done in heaven. 

God bless the Jews in this important work. May the eyes of their 
understanding be opened, and the time soon come when Shiloh, to whose 
coming they have so long looked forward, shall stand upon the Mount of 
Olives, and they recognize in him, Jesus of Nazareth, the Redeemer 
of the world, whom their fathers rejected. And may we, Latter-day 
Saints, we people who are of Ephraim, appreciate the part we are play- 
ing in this great latter-day drama, the like of which was never played 
before, and never will be again, is my earnest prayer, through Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

I saw President Ivins turn this book down. He said before 
he started to speak, he was going to read the last verse of the inspired 
hymn by Parley P. Pratt that we have heard sung today: 

"Lo, Israel filled, with joy 
Shall now be gathered home, 
Their wealth and means employ 

To build Jerusalem; 
While Zion shall arise and shine. 
And fill the earth with truth divine." 

Another prophecy that was uttered by Parley P. Pratt over three 
quarters of a century ago is being fulfilled. 

ELDER REED SMOOT 

I do not believe that there is any other place in all the world where 
a gathering of people such as we have in this building this morning 
is possible. Every seat occupied, with thousands standing, and every 
person present listening for every word that falls from the mouth of 
the speaker, with every one interested in what may be said, and the 
prophecies that may be made, every soul having within herself or him- 
self a testimony that God lives and that this is his Church. 



ELDER REED SMOOT 



53 



THE GREATEST JOY OF LIFE 

While President Ivins was speaking this morning I thought to 
myself how wonderful it would be if every soul that breathes could 
have heard the speech delivered by him, and how would it be possible 
for men and women hearing him to doubt that there is a living God, 
and that the testimonies and prophecies uttered by his servants from 
the beginning of the world down to the present have been or will be 
fulfilled. The greatest joy I have in my life is that I know that the 
servants of God, speaking under the inspiration of his Holy Spirit, 
utter those things that God wants his people to know, and also give 
notice to the world that they will surely happen. 

WHAT IT MEANS TO LIVE THE GOSPEL 

There is no other church on earth with so perfect an organization to 
look after the welfare of its members, not only spiritually but physically 
and temporally as well. I haven't the time to point to examples, but in 
making that statement I feel positive that no one who has studied the 
organization of the Church, bearing upon these three great activities 
of life, could do otherwise than testify to the statements I have just 
made. To live its laws and requirements means spiritual salvation, 
physical development and temporal advancement. It is well that at 
these conferences the people are instructed along these lines, for they 
are part of the whole, and without the whole men cannot enjoy the 
fulness of life. 

THE BURDENS OF DEBT 

How often at these conferences have we heard the voice of Pres- 
ident Smith ring out, aye, not only as counsel and advice, but as a man 
clothed with authority to speak, pleading with the people to study and 
obey the temporal laws given to this Church ! How often have we 
heard him and others pleading with the people to keep out of debt ; and, 
if in debt, that we get out as soon as possible. That advice is not only 
good to our people and all people, but it is good to all nations and all 
countries, all states, all counties, all cities, for whoever dreamed a few 
years ago that the world would be in such a condition financially as it is 
today? Since the close of war I have exercised all my power to 
eliminate every unnecessary expense of our government with a view of 
lightening the burden of taxation upon the institutions of our country 
and individual taxpayers, and set an example, if you please, for states 
and for counties, and for cities, and foreign countries, as well, to follow. 

So, my brethren and sisters, for the few moments that I have at my 
command, I want to call briefly to your attention one subject that it 
seems to me will at least assist those who want assistance to keep out of 
debt and get out of debt. 

IDLENESS CONDEMNED 

I remember that in one of the early revelations given to the Prophet 
Joseph the Lord said : 



54 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



"Thou shalt not be idle, for he that is idle shall not eat the bread nor wear 
the garments of the laborer." 

May I add that in idleness there is decay and early death, not 
only in man but in everything in all the universe. Take a piece of 
machinery, let it be idle, and what will happen? It will be made useless 
much earlier than if in constant use. And I might proceed and call 
your attention, my brethren and sisters, to other matters of the mind and 
the body, but time will not permit. As far as I am concerned I would 
prefer to work out rather than to rust out, and if I had followed the 
advice of my doctors just before leaving Washington, I would be up 
in some of these mountains, not receiving a telegram, or a letter, seeing 
iiq people, but resting for four or five months. When he gave me that 
advice, all I had to say was, "Doctor, I will not do it." 

HOW TO REACH HAPPINESS AND CONTENTMENT 

It is not altogether the number of years that you live that counts, 
but the result of your labors that you will be judged by, not only 
among the children of men, but in the hereafter as well. I want to 
see the "Mormon" people the most contented and the happiest people 
in all the world. And let me testify to you today that the way to 
reach that happy sphere is to live the commandments that God has 
given us, and obey the same. 

MEANING AND NECESSITY OF THRIFT 

Thrift is what we need among our own people and among the 
nations of the world, and when I say thrift I mean it in its broadest 
sense. In speaking of thrift I mean the kind that makes better men, 
better women and better children, a thrift that will build a better nation, 
a better world. Thrift means much more than the mere saving of 
money, it means prosperity, good husbandry, economical management, 
frugality; it means individual efficiency; it means order and system; 
it means self-control, and in many cases self-denial. It means self- 
confidence ; it means character -building in its broadest meaning, morally, 
temporally and spiritually. The thrift that I want to impress upon you 
does not mean stinginess nor miserliness, nor does it include extrava- 
gance. Thrift and thriving mean the same thing. A thriving child never 
suggests skimping and saving ; a thrifty man is one who thrives 
on account of his own efforts. Many people have a wrong idea in 
thinking that thrift is the niggardly cutting down of necessary ex- 
penses ; they urge that they would rather be spendthrifts than misers. 

WASTE THE ENEMY OF THRIFT AND PROGRESS 

In this connection remember that waste is the universal enemy 
of all forms of thrift and progress. What do we get out of smoking? 
No good whatever. It is a violation of the very principle of thrift, 
and many people in this counrty are now indulging in it. I once made a 
speech at the Utah stake conference, years ago, when I was second 
counselor to the president of that stake. It was often designated the, 



ELDER REED SMOOT 



55 



"garbage can speech of Reed Smoot." Now, my brethren and sisters, 
I want to say to you that into that can, many times at the homes of the 
people who can least afford it, you will find the waste, aye, the wicked 
waste of the very necessaries of life. 

This subject is so broad that I find it is impossible for me 
to cover it, but I do want to call attention to the fact that in the 
United States 66 out of every 100 people who die leave no estate ; that 
out of the remaining 24 only nine leave an estate larger than five- 
thousand dollars. Think of this deplorable condition, that at the age 
of 65, 97 out of every 100 in America, are partially or wholly de- 
pendent on relatives or friends or the public for their daily bread for 
their clothing, and for a roof under which to sleep. 

A STORY OF LINLOLN AS AN ILLUSTRATION 

An eastern merchant once wrote Abraham Lincoln, when a young 
attorney, asking about the responsibilty and character of a fellow-towns- 
man, and Mr. Lincoln answered as follows : 

"Dear Sir : — Yours of the 10th received. I am well acquainted with the 
gentleman named, and know his circumstances. First of all he has a wife 
and baby. Together they should be worth fifty thousand dollars to any man. 
Then he has an office in which there will be a table worth about a dollar and a 
half, and three chairs worth, say, one dollar. Last of all, there is in one corner 
a rat hole which will bear looking into. Yours respectfully, Abraham Lincoln." 

WHERE OUR DANGER LIES 

I see my time has expired. I do not know how it is possible for 
any man or woman to attend one of these conferences and hear the 
testimonies given under the inspiration of the Spirit of God that we 
have here, to leave a meeting and say the "Mormons" are dishonest 
in their belief. I believe all that has been revealed ; I believe all that 
will yet be revealed; and I believe that this people will be instructed 
and directed under the influence of revelation from Almighty God. The 
only danger is ourselves. The Father will do his part, and desires that 
his children will do theirs. May God give us wisdom and judgment to 
fulfil every requirement made at our hands, that every calling, no 
matter were it may be, may be fulfilled in a way that evein the bitterest 
enemy that we have may see our works, and forever cease criticism of 
such a people. Go'd be with us forever. May his work grow and 
increase in the world for goodness, and in power, is my prayer in the 
name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

President Grant announced that brief testimonies would be given by 
a number of the brethren during the remainder of the time. 

ELDER CHARLES A. CALLIS 

President of the Southern States Mission 

Brethren and sisters, during the latter part of February and the 
early part of March, the Southern states mission was honored by a 



56 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



visit from President Heber J. Grant, As the President of the Church 
stood before those great audiences in Jacksonville, Florida, and Atlanta, 
Georgia, as a minister and a witness for Jesus Christ, I could feel in 
my heart that God had opened effectual doors for the President to 
deliver great messages to those large congregations. We have ex- 
perienced, through the ministry of the President of the Church, a great 
spiritual uplift. The poet says: 

V 

"Thy swift messengers are treading 
Thy high courts where princes dwell; 
And thy glorious light is spreading, 
Zion prospers ; all is well." 

There is in this gospel the power to bring the pence of mind that 
is dearer than all. Not long ago a young lady in the south who had not 
attained her majority heard the gospel preached by two of the humble 
servants of the Lord. That message, spoken under the power of the 
Holy Ghost, went to the heart of this young woman. She appealed to 
her father for permission to be baptized, but he refused, and said, "The 
church of your father and your mother will afford you spiritual con- 
solation." Her pleadings were of no avail. Some months afterwards 
the girl died. There came to the father a great awakening. Someone 
has said that "the awakening of the conscience is the grandeur of the. 
soul." His conscience began to trouble him; he felt in his heart that 
he had denied his daughter, the idol of his life, a sacred privilege to which 
she was entitled. He could have turned in his troubled state of mind 
to those outwardly magnificent but soul-unsatisfying institutions in 
which he had bidden her to remain, and said : "Canst thou not minister 
to a mind diseased? Pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow?" But 
the response would have been, " 'Where the tree falleth, there shall it 
be.' Death fixes a period to man's progress." So he turned in his 
distress to the standard that God has set up for the Gentiles to seek to, 
and his rest was glorious. He considered the doctrine of salvation for 
the dead, and he wrote me, stating the circumstances of his refusal to 
permit his daughter to be baptized. He said : "I believe in the doctrine 
of salvation for the dead ; I believe that there is in the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints the power to apply the grace of this gospel 
to those who have departed. And," said he, "you will relieve my mind, 
you will make me happy by having the temple work done for my darling 
daughter, who departed this life without receiving the gospel, because of 
my prejudice." And this was done. This man received peace. 

My brethren and sisters, it is my testimony that in this Church 
there is the power and the Priesthood to administer the saving ordi- 
nances of the gospel for those who have gone to the spirit world, who 
have not had the opportunity of receiving the gospel in this life. And 
this testimony I bear in humility and with gratitude of heart, in the 
name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 



ELDER HUGH J. CANNON

ELDER HUGH J. CANNON 

President of the Liberty Stake of Zion 

My brethren and sisters, this call came as a very great surprise, 
but it is always a pleasure to me to testify of the divinity of this gospel, 
no matter how much fright results from the calk 

When I see before me the thousands of people who share with me 
the knowledge that the gospel is true, when I contemplate their lives 
and think what the truth has done for them, I feel as Brother Smoot 
said, ''It is surprising that all the world cannot understand it." 

While waiting for this meeting to commence a little experience I 
had, not very long ago, came to my mind. You know the Church practice 
of having our families visited by the ward teachers, and I wondered 
how it is that people of the world have not thought of this simple 
means of keeping in touch with those whose spiritual welfare they are 
attempting to direct. 

A little while ago the Presidency of the Liberty stake suggested to 
the bishoprics that they would like to do- some visiting among the 
people and see how this work of ward teaching is being actually 
carried out. An invitation was extended to me to go out with two 
young boys in one of our wards. By appointment I met them on a 
certain street corner, and found them to be about fourteen years of age, 
The one in charge asked, "What would you like to do?" I replied,' 
"I would like to see how you do you teaching; just go ahead in your 
usual way." "Well, suppose we go into this house," he said, indicating 
his father's home, in front of which we were standing, "and have prayers 
together." We went in and they asked me to pray. From the time we 
entered that house until the work of teaching was finished for the 
night, not one word was spoken that did not pertain to the gospel of the 
Lord Jesus Christ. We went into one home, and the 'boys said to the 
head of the house who happened to be their bishop, "Are your chil- 
dren all together?" The bishop answered, "They will be, in a moment." 
We waited until all in the house were present and then we had prayers, 
after which the boys delivered their message, and in all my experience in 
the Church I have never seen such good teaching as those two fourteen- 
year-old boys did. When they got through in the first home, they 
turned to me and said, "Brother Cannon, haven't you something to 
say?" And I was obliged to say, "No." If I had opened my mouth 
to speak I would have broken down and cried, so deep was the Im- 
pression they made upon my heart. 

When we see simple things like this in the Church of Christ, and 
then compare them with the vain attempts which are made by the people 
of the world to put over their message, it seems to me that all mankind, 
if they will give it a moment's thought, must see in this Church the 
hand of a Divine Ruler, one who inspires his servants to direct and to 
institute in the Church the things which will make for salvation,

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



I can testify, and I rejoice in the testimony which I possess, that 
God does live, and that the men who preside over us, and who have 
presided over this Church from the beginning, are divinely called 
and divinely inspired. I rejoice in the testimony which I have of 
these things, and which I bear to you in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 

ELDER HENRY H. BLOOD 

President of the North Davis Stake of Zion 

One unaccustomed to standing before a congregation of this size 
cannot fail to be overawed as he occupies, for the first time, this posi- 
tion, and his trust must be placed in the Lord for guidance in the few 
words of testimony that he would like to bear. 

This morning, as I listened to what President Ivins told us, to 
his reading of predictions that have been made with reference to ancient 
Israel, and to the complete fulfilment, so far as the fulfilment has at 
this time been made complete, of all those predictions, my mind went 
also to the predictions that have been made with reference to modern 
Israel. I thought of that wonderful prediction made by the Prophet 
Joseph Smith, in the later years of his life, in which he said that the 
Latter-day Saints should be led to the Rocky Mountains, and that here 
in the midst of these valleys they should become a mighty people. It 
then was a wonderful prediction in itself, because he had never seen 
in his natural vision these valleys, and yet his prophetic eyes had been 
opened to understand what the future of this people should be. 

Later, when the people were led by the Prophet Brigham Young 
to these valleys, it is not surprising to me that when his eyes first 
beheld this spot upon which this tabernacle now is built, this valley 
in which this splendid city is located, he was able to say, "This is the 
place." 

I have watched within the short period of my own life that fulfil- 
ment of another prediction, which tradition says — I do not know that 
it is written — was made at the time the ward in which I live was first 
organized, very early in 1850. At that time it is said that President 
Brigham Young made a statement that the time would come when that 
section lying between Salt Lake City and Ogden would be so closely 
populated that it would be difficult to say when you left one settle- 
ment or town and entered another. At that time there was not much 
of a population in that particular district; indeed,. there was a section 
of that country lying between here and Ogden that did not at that 
time appear to lend itself to population — the Sand Ridge. We con- 
sidered it to be a place where no one could reside, a place inhabited 
only by lizards and an occasional jack rabbit, and yet the prophet 
of the Lord had said that it should become populous. Go there now, 
my brethren and sisters, traverse the section between this city and 
Ogden, and witness the literal fulfilment of that prediction which I 



ELDER HENRY H. BLOOD 



59 



have heard mentioned all the years of my life. Indeed it had scarcely 
begun to be fulfilled when I first remember that particular district. 
Today some of the best and most productive gardens are located along 
that section of the country between here and Ogden. And a more inten- 
sively cultivated section cannot be found in the state of Utah. Literally, 
it is true that one going from here to Ogden can scarcely tell when 
he leaves one settlement and enters another. Verily these predictions 
of modern prophets have been fulfilled, and in their fulfilling there 
has also been fulfilled that wonderful prediction contained in the 
35th chapter of Isaiah, wherein that prophet of old said, 

"The wilderness and the solitary place shall be glad for them; and the 
desert shall rejoice, and blossom as the rose." 

Men will say, of course, that this has been brought about by the 
hands of men, and so it has, but God's purposes are always fulfilled 
by men, by the instrumentality of men whom he raises up to fulfil his 
purposes. Men have gone out into the mountains, conserved the water 
supply, poured it upon the parched land, and the land has been made 
fruitful because of the work of man, but that is literally the way the 
Lord fulfils the predictions of his prophets. 

My testimony to you, my brethren and sisters, is that God is 
guiding the destinies of this people, that every word that has been 
spoken with reference to ancient Israel, and with reference to modern 
Israel, will be fulfilled, and I bear this testimony to you in the 
name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The hymn, "Let the mountains shout for joy," was sung by a 
quartette and the choir. 

The closing prayer was offered by Elder Henry N. Mickleson, 
president of the Lost River stake of Zion. 

Conference adjourned until 2 o'clock p. m. 



AFTERNOON SESSION 

At 2 o'clock p. m., April 5, the conference session was opened 
by President Heber J. Grant, who announced that the choir and con- 
gregation would sing, "Praise to the man who communed with 
Jehovah." 

The opening prayer was offered by Elder Albert H. Belliston, 
president of the Juab stake of Zion. 

The choir sang, "The morning breaks the shadows flee." 

In announcing the singing of this hymn President Heber J. Grant 
stated that it is the first hymn in the Latter-day Saints' hymn book, 
and that it is entitled to the place. 

H. L. Johnston, Tobar, Nevada, heard the Sunday morning service 
over radio. He sent a message saying, "Morning service came in fine-

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Appreciate opportunity of hearing the word of the Lord." The message 
was read by President Grant. 

PRESIDENT RUDGER CLAWSON 

My brethren and sisters, I am quite sure that this is the largest 
congregation of Latter-day Saints that I have ever had the privilege 
of standing before. I think there must be in this building at least 
nine thousand people, and in addition to that number there is a large 
audience in the Assembly Hall, and another congregation in the Barratt 
Hall, and still in addition to that there is a large congregation of people 
who are "listening in." I said to Brother John M. Knight, as we were 
leaving the building yesterday, that I sat right behind him on the stand 
and could hear every word he said. He seemed to be pleased with that 
information, and as he was able to make me hear him, I trust that I 
shall be able to make you hear me. 

TWO IMPORTANT DOCTRINES 

I have been deeply impressed with the sermons of the brethren 
who have spoken, both yesterday and today. President Grant in the 
opening address gave the key note to the conference. He explained 
clearly our belief in Deity ; yes our belief in God the Father and in Jesus 
Christ, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, which is one God, the God of 
the Bible. He also stressed, with his usual force and precision, two 
very important doctrines of the gospel — one the Word of Wisdom and 
the other the law of tithing. In my talk this afternoon, if I can come 
somewhere within the range of the keynote address, I will not be going 
very far astray. Another thing, it should be remembered that the 
doctrines of the gospel may be approached at different angles, which 
gives a little spice and variety to the discourses of the brethren. This I 
think is acceptable to the Lord and pleasing to the Latter-day Saints. 

GREATER AND LESSER LAWS 

How wonderful is the gospel of Jesus Christ. Paul the Apostle 
describes it as the power of God unto salvation to all those who believe 
and obey it. But the question naturally arises : "What is this salvation 
the apostle was referring to? You will find among the writings and 
sermons of the Prophet Joseph Smith some information upon this very 
important subject. He said that a man could not be fully saved until he 
had put all enemies under his feet in this world, and subdued or domi- 
nated all evil spirits in the world to come, as it was written of Christ 
that he should reign until he put all enemies under his feet, the last 
enemy being death. 

Within the scope of the gospel there are very many doctrines or 
laws. There are some people who presume to determine which are 
great and which are small. As for instance, you may hear a person 
say: Well, this doctrine of the gospel is one of the greater doctrines, 
and this other doctrine, well that is one of the lesser laws, It seems 



PRESIDENT RUDGER CLAWS ON 



61 



to me it is presumptuous upon the part of any man to determine 
a matter of that kind. Who can say, except God himself, the author 
of the gospel, which are the greater and which are the lesser laws, 
if there be any difference. I have been reflecting somewhat upon the 
two important doctrines or laws that the President so beautifully and 
powerfully emphasized in his address. One is the law of health, the 
other is the law of revenue; or in other words the Word of Wisdom 
and the law of Tithing. 

AS TO THE WORD OF WISDOM 

Relative to the Word of Wisdom, brethren and sisters, we are told in 
the revelation itself, which was given February 27, 1833, that it was 
given to show forth the order and will of God in the temporal salva- 
tion of his people. That sounds very fine to me. It is wonderful if 
we can be saved temporally. It is necessary, it is essential, and this was 
given, it seems, for that very purpose. The Lord then proceeds to tell 
his people what is hurtful to the body. He knew ; he has always known ; 
therefore he advises his people. He tells us that strong drinks are not 
good for the body, that tobacco is not good for the body, but was in- 
tended for all sick cattle, and is to be used with judgment and skill. 
We are also told that not only strong drinks are not good for the 
body, but that hot drinks, meaning tea and coffee, are not good for 
the body. 

In giving this great revelation, the Lord has not left his people 
in the dark, After pointing out some of the things that are exceed- 
ingly hurtful to the body, he points out the articles of food that are 
good for the body, namely all wholesome herbs to be used with prudence 
and thanksgiving, the flesh of beasts and the fowls of the air, to be used 
sparingly and not to excess ; all grain, the same being ordained for the 
use of man and of beasts, to be the staff of life. Here is a law that 
reaches out in opposite directions. It tells us on the one hand what is 
good for these our mortal bodies, on the other, what is bad for them. 
It is the law of health. Are the Latter-day Saints observing it ? Many 
are, some are not. Those who fail to keep it cannot plead ignorance, 
for the law has been in force upon the Church of Christ for ninety-two 
years, and is often mentioned in the congregations of the Saints. It 
should not be overlooked, nor forgotten, that this law was given with 
a promise of great blessings through its observance; for it is written 
down in the statute that, "all Saints who remember to keep and do 
these things, walking in obedience to the commandments, shall receive 
health in their navel and marrow to their bones, and shall find wisdom 
and great treasures of knowledge, even hidden treasures, and shall run 
and not be weary, and shall walk and not faint. And I, the Lord, give 
unto them a promise, that the destroying angel shall pass them by as the 
children of Israel, and not slay them." 

ITS SPIRITUAL AND TEMPORAL CHARACTER 

This promise greatly emphasizes also the spiritual character of the 



62 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



law, as well as the temporal, and justifies one in saying that the 
Word of Wisdom is not only temporal in its nature, but is also spiritual, 
for surely wisdom and great treasures of knowledge are spiritual. In 
further evidence of this the Lord said to Joseph Smith in the revelation 
of the Three Glories, namely: 

"For thus saith the Lord— I, the Lord, am merciful and gracious unto those 
who fear me, and delight to honor those who serve me in righteousness, and in 
truth to the end. 

"Great shall be their reward and eternal shall be their glory. And to them 
will I reveal all mysteries, yea, all the hidden mysteries of my kingdom from 
days of old, and for ages to come, will I make known unto them the good 
pleasure of my will concerning all things pertaining to my kingdom. 

"Yea, even the wonders of eternity shall they know and tilings to come 
will I show them even the things of many generations. 

"And their wisdom shall be great and their understanding reach to heaven ; 
and before them the wisdom of the wise shall perish and, the understanding of 
the prudent shall come to naught 

"For by my Spirit will I enlighten them and by my power will I make known 
unto them the secrets of my will — yea, .even those things which eye has not seen, 
nor ear heard, nor yet entered into the heart of man." 

THE PROMISE IS SURE 

Let me say here, in all solemnity, that those who fail to keep this 
law cannot justly claim the promise. 

I fancy I hear some one say : "Ah, Brother Clawson, my father 
was a good man, a faithful Latter-day Saint. He kept the command- 
ments of God, he was an observer of the Word of Wisdom. At the 
age of seventy he died, and the destroying angel came and took him 
away." 

My answer to that is : "Brother, would you make the promise 
of God of non-effect? Would you intimate that the Lord who gave this 
law and this promise unto its people failed in your father's case to 
keep his promise ? Surely it was not so. True, the angel of death may 
have been in your father's home when he passed away, in fact, may have 
come for your father, but he was not a destroying angel, no, he was an 
angel of peace, of mercy, of hope, of love, and he came to open the 
door of light and life and everlasting joy to your good father." 

Death comes to all. The death of the righteous is sweet but the 
death of the wicked, of the rebellious, of those who are wilfully neglect- 
ful of their duty and treat lightly the sacred commandments of God, is 
bitter. Oh, Israel, God will not be mocked in these latter days. His 
house is a house of order. His will is supreme. He gives the law 
and demands of his children obedience thereto. 

CONCERNING THE USE OF TOBACCO 

Again referring to those things that are hurtful to the body, I quote 
from an article by Will H. Brown of Oakland, California, as follows : 

"Tobacco A Source of Inefficiency 
"Newspaper dispatches from Washington, D. C. state that the amount spent 



PRESIDENT RUDGER CLAW SON 



63 



for tobacco in the United States for 1923, was $3,090,000,000. That -is more 
than $1,000,000 more than was spent fpr admission to movies and theatres, for 
imported silks, for candy and sweets, jewelry, face powder, lipsticks, perfumes, 
imported diamonds and precious stones, all combined. 

"The further statement is made that the tobacco bill of the United States 
for 1923 would pay the entire ordinary operating expenses of the Government 
for the next fiscal year, according to the new budget estimates. It has been well 
known for same time that the tobacco bill is far in excess of the total cost and 
valuation of the entire public school system of America. 

"But great as is the cost iin money, it is small in comparison with the cost 
in mental, moral and physical efficiency. The lack of care and thought on the 
part of many workers in many lines is a matter of common comment. A man 
who seated he had been a yardmaster for the last thirty-five years, wrote to one 
of the well known financial writers for the Hearst papers, saying : "There are 
only a few good men left in all the great railroad terminals." 

"The increase in crime and immorality, which is one of the alarming con- 
ditions now faced in this country, keeps pace with the increase in the use of 
tobacco. One prominent judge says he regrets to see a girl smoking, for he 
considers a cigarette in the ,mouth of a girl as a brand of the prostitute. Tens 
of thousands of women and girls are now smoking. We must remember, how- 
ever, that tobacco is no more demoralizing for one sex than the other." 

In face of the fact that tobacco exerts a baneful and demoralizing 
effect on the body and the mind, there are some members of the Church 
and even young men and boys, who have acquired the habit and go on 
using tobacco. It appears to be a matter of deliberate and wilful 
disregard of God's commandment. And then what shall we say of mem- 
bers of the Church, if there be any, and I fear there are, who not only 
violate the law of God, but also the law of man, by using bootleg 
whiskey that in some cases paralyzes the body and blinds the eyes. If 
the Latter-day 'Saints will but do their simple duty, they will be living 
above and beyond the law of prohibition, which is a righteous and 
most beneficient law. 

THE LAW OF REVENUE FOR THE CHURCH 

The time is gone. I might say in conclusion that the other great 
law emphasized was the law of revenue for the Church. No church 
under the heavens can be fully established and have assurance that it 
will prosper without revenue, and therefore the churches of the world 
have planned in various ways to raise revenue to meet their current 
expenses, and to build up their institutions. In many instances, they 
have adopted the custom of passing around the plate during their 
religious services, or in other words taking up a collection. Now the 
Lord knew very well that, if he established his Church, there must be a 
way provided for gathering revenue for the Church. In his wisdom 
he gave to us the law of tithing. It is very simple, it is very beautiful, 
In reading that law nobody need to go astray or to misunderstand it. 
It bears down equally upon all, according to their circumstances, and 
that idea alone is very valuable. For instance, if a man is getting one 
thousand /dollars a month, he pays one tenth, or one hundred dollars, 
for tithing. If a man is getting five hundred dollars a month, he pays 
fifty dollars tithing. If he is getting thirty dollars a month, three 



64 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



dollars tithing. If a man is getting ten dollars a month, which is in- 
conceivable, he should pay one dollar in tithing; and, as I have heard 
the law explained by our late President Joseph F. Smith, if a widow 
woman gathers ten eggs from her chickens, she should pay one egg for 
tithing, and will then have nine eggs left to go on with. Doubtless 
the widow woman will not miss that one egg. Doubtless the man that 
earns one thousand dollars a month, if he will be honest with the 
Lord and pay his tithing, will not miss the one hundred dollars. The 
Lord said to ancient Israel: "Why have you robbed me?" Ancient 
Israel said to him: "Lord, how have we robbed thee?" And the an- 
swer was : "You have robbed me in your tithes and offerings." Now, 
if we will pay our tithes and offerings, the Lord has said : "I will open 
the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall 
not be room enough to receive it." So there is a blessing and a 
promise that go with tithing as there is with the Word of Wisdom. 
The Lord bless you, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH 

The responsibility that rests upon one who occupies this position 
would be overpowering but for the knowledge that those who stand 
here do so in obedience to the requirement that has been made by our 
heavenly Father to convey to the children of men the message of the 
gospel. 

HOW MARVELOUS ARE THE WORKS OF GOD 

Many times during the sessions of this conference my eyes have 
been dimmed by tears, not necessarily because of the thing that was said, 
but because of the influence that has pervaded this great assembly. 
While enjoying the remarks of the brethren my mind has dwelt on the 
opportunities offered in this great and wonderful universe, and I 
have felt to exclaim : "How marvelous are thy works, O Lord!" You 
who are here today, if you will examine yourselves, if you will count 
your many blessings, will say with me, surely no people that have ever 
lived upon the earth have such occasion to be thankful for the mercies 
of our heavenly Father extended to them. Each of us a weak instru- 
ment, each of us comparatively helpless but for the mercy of the Lord 
that has been and is extended unto us. 

GRATITUDE FOR OUR MANY BLESSINGS 

I am reminded of a prophet of old who stated that he was born 
of goodly parents. How thankful we ought to be for that wonderful 
blessing. I stand here today as one of the humblest among you, thank- 
ful beyond expression for my ancestry, grateful for my wife and my 
children, appreciative of the opportunity I have of associating with the 
best men and the best women who live upon the earth. When I realize 
the former barrenness and sterility of the Western land, and now see 
this beautiful valley dotted by the homes of the children of our Lord,

the meeting houses and temples erected to him, and when I behold these 
wonderful mountains capped by eternal snow, and realize that our 
heavenly Father decreed that here his children should have their feet 
planted, and from here should go forth the word of the Lord, I feel 
deeply grateful that I have my humble home among this people in the 
midst of these delightful surroundings with the privilege of entering 
into the House of the Lord to receive his blessings with my brethren 
and my sisters. 

When I look into your faces I realize that you represent a great group 
of people who are not here today, many of whom, yes most of whom, 
are of necessity as grateful as we for the blessings that the Lord has be- 
stowed upon them. I have mentioned, only the physical comfort when 1 
have referred to the surroundings, but the greater and more precious gift 
of our heavenly Father is the blessing that has come to us to know that 
he lives, that [Jesus is the Christ, that Joseph Smith is the prophet of 
this latter dispensation, and that there is upon this earth at the present 
time a priesthood endued with powef from on high. What would it 
mean to us if suddenly there were taken from us this knowledge ? How 
would it affect us if we had to part with the authority that God hab 
conferred upon us ? It would mean that there had been closed to us the 
doors of the celestial kingdom. It would mean that the crowning 
blessing toward which I have been taught to look since I was a child 
would not be realized. That of the companionship of my loved ones, 
the association of the father and the mother, and I may say mothers, 
for in my case I was fortunate to have two mothers, the companionship 
of many other good men and good women, who are dear to me almost 
as life itself, could not be enjoyed in' the celestial kingdom. I have been 
taught to look forward to the time when I may have their eternal com- 
panionship, and I rejoice and with deep gratitude thank my Father in 
heaven for that assurance. 

GRATEFUL FOR A LIVING TESTIMONY 

When I ponder over the condition of the people of this world, 
the doubt that is in the mind of the human family, I am reminded that it 
is only a repetition of history. Then people of the earth during past 
centuries have received the ministry of our heavenly Father, through 
his divinely-appointed servants, but because of their indifference, and 
carelessness, because of selfishness and evil, they have forfeited the 
knowledge that God lives, and they have turned from the worship of 
the true and living God to worship Baal, and the other false gods, that 
men have erected under the influence of the adversary of all righteous- 
ness. Today, as I think of the men who stand as religious leaders 
among the people, and observe how helpless they are to inspire faith 
in the minds and lives of individuals, and realize that in the mercy of 
the Lord the Latter-day Saints have received, not something that is un- 
certain, but a living individual testimony that has been born into the 
lives of each soul who has complied with the simple requirements of our 



66 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



heavenly Father, namely — faith in him, repentance of sin, baptism by 
immersion for the remission of sins, and the laying on of hands for 
the gift of the Holy Ghost, I am profoundly grateful. Without ex- 
ception, each repentant baptized believer who has complied with these 
requirements of the Lord has received a witness for himself that this 
is our Father's work. 

THE FAITHLESS CONDITION OF THE WORLD 

Observing the faithless condition of the world today I am con- 
strained to read to you from a portion of the record of Mormon as 
contained in the Book of Mormon, and as inscribed on plates and buried 
in the Hill Cumorah by Moroni. He says : 

"And now, I speak also concerning those who do not believe in Christ 
"Behold, will ye believe in the day of your visitation — behold, when the 
Lord shall come, yea, even that great day when the earth shall be rolled to- 
gether as a scroll, and the elements shall melt with fervent neat, yea, in that 
great day when he shall be brought to stand before the Lamb of God — then will 
ye say that there is no God? 

"Then will ye longer deny the Christ, or can ye behold tfie Lamb of God? 
Do ye suppose that ye shall dwell with him under a consciousness of your 
guilt? Do ye suppose that ye could be happy to dwell with that holy Being, when 
your souls are racked with a consciousness of guilt that ye have ever abused his 
laws? 

"Behold, I say unto you that ye would be more miserable to dwell with a 
holy and just God, under a consciousness of your filthiness before him, than 
ye would dwell with the damned souls in hell. 

"For behold, when ye shall be brought to see your nakedness before God, 
and also the glory of God, and the holiness of Jesus Christ, it will kindle a 
flame of unquenchable fire upon yyou." 

CALL TO REPENTANCE 

Brethren and sisters, this is the record that was written by this 
man hundreds of years ago. As I said, history repeats itself. If there 
had been time I might have referred to the various dispensations when 
the Lord has revealed himself. I am now reading from one of the 
dispensations as recorded in the Book of Mormon: 

"O then ye unbelieving, turn ye unto the Lord ; cry mightily unto the Father 
in the name of Jesus, that perhaps ye may be found spotless, pure, fair, and 
white, having been cleansed by the blood of the Lamb, at that great and last day. 

"And again I speak unto j r ou who deny the revelations of God, and say that 
they are done away, that there are no revelations, nor prophecies, nor gifts, nor 
healing, nor speaking with tongues, and the interpretation of tongues ; 

"Behold I say unto you, he that denieth these things knoweth not the gospel 
of Christ; yea, he has not read the scriptures; if so, he does not understand them. 

"For do we not read that God is the same yesterday, today, and forever, and 
in him there is no variableness neither shadow of changing? 

"And now, if ye have imagined up unto yourselves a god who doth vary, 
and in whom there is a shadow of changing, then have ye imagined up unto 
yourselves a god who is not a God of miracles. 

"But behold, I will show unto you a God of miracles, even the God of 
Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob ; and it is that same God 
who created the heavens and the earth, and all things that in them are. 



ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH

"Behold, he created Adam, and by Adam came the fall of man. And because 
of the fall of man came Jesus Christ, even the Father and the Son; and because 
of Jesus Christ came the redemption of man. 

"And because of the redemption of man, which came by Jesus Christ, they 
are brought back into the presence of the Lord; yea, this is wherein all men are 
redeemed, because the death of Christ bringeth to pass the resurrection, which 
bringeth to pass a redemption from an endless sleep, from which sleep all men 
shall be awakened by the power of God when the trumpet shall sound ; and they 
shall come forth, both small and great, and all shall stand before his bar, being 
redeemed and loosed from this eternal band of death, which death is a temporal 
death. 

"And then cometh the judgment of the Holy One upon them; and then 
cometh the time that he that is filthy shall be filthy still; and he that is righteous 
shall be righteous still ; he that is happy shall be happy still ; and he that is un- 
happy shall be unhappy still. 

"And now, O all ye that have imagined up unto yourselves a god who can 
do no miracles, I would ask of you, have all these things passed, of which J 
have spoken ? Has the end come yet ? Behold I say unto you, Nay ; and God 
lias not ceased to be a God of miracles. 

"Behold, are not the things that God hath wrought marvelous in our eyes ? 
Yea, and who can comprehend the marvelous works of God? 

"Who shall say that it was not a miracle that by his word the heaven and 
the earth should be; and by the power of his word man was created of the dust 
of the earth; and by the power of his word have miracles been wrought? 

"And who shall say that Jesus Christ did not do many mighty miracles? 
And there were many mighty miracles wrought by the hands of the apostles. 

"And if there were miracles wrought then, why has God ceased to be a God 
of miracles and yet be an unchangable Being? And behold, I say unto you he 
changeth not ; if so he would cease to be God ; and he ceaseth not to be God ; and 
is a God of miracles. 

"And the reason why he ceaseth to do miracles among the children of men 
is because that they dwindle in unbelief." 

Remember he was preaching the gospel to the unbelievers. I want 
to repeat the last clause. 

"And the reason why he ceaseth to do miracles among the children of men 
is because that they dwindle in unbelief, and depart from the right way, and 
know not ;the God in whom they should trust. 

"Behold, I say unto you that whoso believeth in Christ, doubting nothing, 
whatsoever he shall ask the Father in the name of Christ it shall be granted 
him; and this promise is unto all, even unto the ends of the earth. 

"For behold, thus sairh Jesus Christ, the Sen of God, unto his disciples who 
should tarry, yea, and also to all his disciples, in the hearing of the multitude : 
Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature. 

"And he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved, but he that believeth 
not shall be damned; 

"And these signs shajl follow them that believe — in my name shall they cast 
" out devils ; they shall speak with new tongues ; they shall take up serpents ; and 
if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the 
sick and they shall recover; 

"And whosoever shall believe in my name, doubting nothing, unto him will 
I confirm all my words, even unto the ends of the earth. 

"And now, behold, who can stand against the works of the Lord? Who can 
deny his sayings? Who will rise up against the almighty power of the Lord? 
Who will despise the works of the Lord? Who will despise the children of 
Christ? Behold, all ye who are despisers of the works of the Lord, for ye shall 
wonder and perish. 



68 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



"O then despise not, and wonder not, but hearken unto the words of the 
Lord, and ask the Father in the name of Jesus for what things soever ye shall 
stand in need. Doubt not, but be believing', and begin as in times of old, and come 
unto the Lord with all your heart, and work out your own salvation with fear and 
trembling before him. 

"Be wise in the days of your probation ; strip yourselves of all uncleanness ; 
ask not that ye may consume it on your lusts,,\but ask with a firmness unshaken, 
that ye will yield to no temptation, but that ye will serve the true and living God. 

"See that ye are not baptized unworthily ; see that ye partake not of the 
sacrament of Christ unworthily; but see that ye do all things in worthiness, and 
do it in the name of Jesus Christ, the Son of the living God; and if ye do this, 
and endure to the end, ye will in nowise be cast out. 

'^Behold, / speak unto you as though I spake from the dead; for I know that 
ye shall hear my zuords." 

This man was the one who completed the record. This man hid 
it away, and yet it seems almost as if it were his dying witness unto 
the children of men. He calls attention to the fact that these words 
will reach them, and by the power of God they have reached hundreds 
of thousands, yea millions, of the children of men who dwell upon the 
earth. He was a prophet of the Lord. He had the authority to speak in 
the name of the Lord. He did testify without fear of the things that 
he knew were necessary for the salvation of men. He bore witness of 
the power that comes to those who possess the holy Priesthood, and in 
this day in which we live, although hundreds of years have elapsed, 
his testimony has been brought forth by the gift and power of God, 
translated and printed and scattered broadcast among the human family, 
as another witness of the divinity of our Lord and Master. 

THE GOSPEL A PANACEA FOR THE ILLS OF MANKIND 

My brethren and sisters, I thank my heavenly Father for the bless- 
ing' that comes to me this day. I am grateful to him for everything 
that I enjoy. I thank him for your companionship, and for the comfort 
and satisfaction that I enjoy, as I visit to and fro in the stakes of 
Zion, and in the missionary field in seeing men and women like your- 
selves who are anxious to know the will of our heavenly Father, and 
who in their hearts are saying: "Father in heaven, show me thy will 
and I will endeavor to keep thy commandments." In the past two 
months I have traveled more than eleven thousand miles in this wonder- 
ful land of America, from the eastern seaboard to the western sea- 
board. I have borne witness of the divinity of this work, I have found 
great and good men outside the pale of this, or of any church, who are 
apparently anxious to know what the end will be as a result of the 
condition that this world finds itself in. It has been my privilege to 
explain to some of these my faith in the divine mission of Jesus Christ, 
my knowledge that our heavenly Father loves his children, as he always 
has done ; the assurance that has burned into my soul, for which I am 
grateful, that I know that the work of our heavenly Father is upon the 
earth, that the gospel of Jesus Christ will solve the problem and be a pan- - 
acea for the ills that afflict mankind. I have borne witness of this, and I 



ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH 



69 



have found response in the hearts of some of these our Father's children 
who do not understand the truth. Again let me express my gratitude for 
the blessings that I enjoy. My heart is full of thanksgiving for all 
that has been bestowed upon me and upon you. God grant that we 
may sustain his name and his Church, that we will uphold the hands 
of those who preside over us, and by so doing continue to be worthy of 
that assurance that passeth understanding, that we are indeed the chil- 
dren of God, heirs of salvation in his celestial kingdom, as a result 
of observing his laws and keeping his commandments, is my prayer, 
in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS 

A great orator standing before his audience made use of this ap- 
peal: "Friends, Romans, countrymen — lend me your ears." I have 
no thought of attempting an oration on this occasion, or on any oc- 
casion, but in a very humble way to speak to you. I am not asking 
for your attention, but I do crave your hearts, your faith and a silent 
prayer that the Lord, by his holy Spirit, will lead me to say the things 
he would have you, my brethren and sisters and friends, to hear. I feel 
very greatly honored in being called to address this large congregation 
on the afternoon of the Sunday of our general conference. I also 
feel a very great responsibility in undertaking to lead in thought those 
who are present, and others, perhaps hundreds of thousands, who are 
hearing my words this aftenoon as they are broadcasted over the 
nation. 

IN HARMONY WITH THE SPIRIT OF THE CONFERENCE 

I want to say that I rejoice exceedingly in the proceedings of this 
conference thus far, in the spirit of the occasion, in the beautiful music 
which has been rendered, the testimonies which have been borne, and 
the instructions which have been imparted. I feel that I am in com- 
plete harmony with this spirit, and with all the proceedings of the 
conference ; that I can endorse without reservation the instructions which 
have been given, and that I can join my brethren with sincere testimony 
that I do- know that this is the work of the Lord, the plan and power of 
God for man's salvation. 

I rejoice exceedingly that I was born of Latter-day Saint parent- 
age, and that my heart has been inclined to love and obey the truth. 
I sincerely regret my imperfections and follies of life, and trust f hat 
my repentance may be genuine and enduring that my sins may be for- 
given. I desire to yield obedience unto every requirement of the gospel 



70 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



and to do the will of the Lord in all things and to use my influence 
with others persuading them to do likewise. 

LOVE OF GOD THE FIRST GREAT COMMANDMENT 

The ideals held up before us are greater perhaps than those pos- 
sessed by any other people in the world. The gospel law which has 
come to us is that by which our Savior lived. It was the living of the 
gospel that made him what he was, and what he is, the glorified Son of 
God, the Redeemer of the world. It is our privilege to follow in his 
footsteps, observing the same high standard of life, yielding obedience 
unto law and 1 authority, and to fcecome joint heirs with him in all that 
our Father possesses. It is my constant desire and prayer that I may 
be able to obey fully that first great commandment — to love the Lord 
my iGod with all my heart, with all my soul, and with all my mind ; and 
in order that I may do so, I need to count my "blessings often, naming 
them o'er and o'er, that by so doing I may appreciate more and more 
the mercy and kindness of my heavenly Father to me. This increases 
my love for him, and I believe it gives me strength and power better to 
meet the requirements of the gospel, that are made upon me. 

LOVE OF FELLOWMEN THE SECOND GREAT COMMANDMENT 

I desire also to observe, as fully as possible, that second great 
commandment, to love my neighbor as myself, and this is perhaps more 
difficult. I know that I should so love my fellowmen, that I would 
be able and willing to suffer for them, and even to die for them if 
necessary, as Christ has died for me. I ought so to love mankind that 
I would be willing to go to the ends of the earth in the preaching of this 
gospel of the kingdom to them. I should so love them that I would be 
abe to' meet insult and injury, persecution and even death without hav- 
ing in my soul the spirit of retaliation. If I were observing this second 
great commandment as I ought to do, I would feel as did the Prophet 
Stephen when he was being stoned to death, who prayed : "Lord, lay 
not this sin to their charge;" or as did the Savior, while upon the cross, 
who in his suffering and dying moments, prayed the Father to forgive 
those who were putting him to death, for, said he, "they know not what 
they do." Men of the world do not understand the things of the Spirit 
of God for they are known only by the Spirit of God, which gave them. 
Some men while thinking that they are doing God service, are working 
directly against his will and purposes, and some not only persecute 
but kill those who are trying to serve the Lord and to be messengers 
of righteousness for him. 

THE EXAMPLE OF PAUL 

There is the case of Saul of Tarsus. I think that his case should 
ever be before us — a man of intelligence, educated at the feet of Ga- 
maliel, living among the Saints of his day, and yet he engaged with 
those who persecuted the Saints, even holding the clothes of those who 
stoned to death the Prophet Stephen, and yet when the Lord took him 
in hand and converted him, he became the great Paul the Apostle to the 



ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS 



71 



Gentiles, and was ready to endure any kind of persecution or death for 
the gospel's sake. After this conversion he made the declaration that 
what he did while persecuting the Saints he did conscientiously, be- 
lieving that he was doing God service. So, brethren and sisters, we 
ought to look upon the world of mankind with a great degree of le- 
niency and of charity. We should realize that while they may be zeal- 
ous in their opposition to the work in which we are engaged and to us 
as a people, they may be conscientious and, if so, the mercy of God 
will reach out to them. 

IMPRESSED WITH THE GREAT NUMBERS OF THE SAINTS 

I have been impressed, in this conference, with the numbers of the 
Latter-day Saints, and with their faithfulness. This vast congregation, 
filling the tabernacle to overflowing, represents possibly two percent 
of the present population of the Church. I estimate that it would take 
about fifty such tabernacles to hold all of the present merribership of the 
Church. Then, remember that tomorrow will be the ninety-fifth an- 
niversary of the birth of this Church organization. And think of all 
the faithful men and women who during these ninety-five years have 
been members of this Church, have lived their lives of faithfulness and 
have gone beyond, and we will then begin to realize the magnitude of 
this work and what has been accomplished. 

TEMPLE WORK THE PAST YEAR — ITS IMPORTANCE 

In the temples of the Church there have been 477,000 baptisms for 
the dead performed during the past year, and more than half that 
number of endowments have been administered. When we think of this 
and realize that with each succeeding year there j will be an increasing 
number of such 'baptisms, we will begin to realize the growth of the 
Church, especially if we may properly call those dead persons as mem- 
bers of the Church for whom baptism has been performed. 

President Wilford Woodruff, speaking from this stand, upon the 
importance of this work devolving upon the Latter-day Saints, the re- 
deeming of their dead, said : 

"Ninety-nine out of every hundred," yea, said he, "nine hundred 
ninety-nine out of every thousand of those for whom this work is 
done vicariously will gladly receive the work." I feel sure the Lord is 
pleased with what the Saints have done in the way of preaching the 
gospel in all the world as a witness before the end shall come. If it 
is possible for us to increase our efforts and our numbers, and! do a 
greater work, of course we are anxious to do it. We should neglect no 
part of this great responsibility resting upon us, toward the living and 
the dead, looking to their salvation ; for it is the work and purpose of the 
Eternal Father to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man. 

AN EVIDENCE OF THE FAITH AND DEVOTION OF THE SAINTS 

I feel very happy, brethren and sisters, in the gospel of Jesus 
Christ, in your fellowship, and the association which I have with you 
and in observing your faithfulness. Just one week ago today, while I 



72 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



was visiting in the Uintah stake of Zion, a count was made of those 
present, which revealed the fact that twenty-seven percent of the entire 
population of that stake, were in attendance. ' We have had higher per- 
centages and lower. Circumstances are not alike in all the stakes, but 
to me this is an evidence of faithfulness and devotion on the part of 
the people. We have hundreds and thousands of men in the various 
stakes of Zion who scrupulously observe to keep the Word of Wisdom, 
and who are paying their tithes and who are devoting days, months 
and years of their time, and giving of their ability to carry on this 
work. Men and women could not be expected to do such things if they 
did not know of the truth of this work, that it is God's work and not 
man's. I rejoice in the testimony which my brethren and sisters have 
of its divinity. 

AS TO MATTERS FINANCIAL 

I am happy today, 'brethren and sisters, because the day before 
the opening of this conference I issued my check in favor of the bishop 
of my ward for the amount of my tithing in full. Oh, some may say : 
What does that amount to ? It amounts only to a tenth of my interest, 
T>ut that is more than some do. I would to the Lord that all the mem- 
bers of this Church could say that they have paid their tithing in full, a 
tenth of their interest and of their earnings. It is only a little thing 
but it makes me very happy. The day before the opening of this con- 
ference I drew my check to redeem a note, the last note that stands 
against me, and today I am out of debt, a very happy man. I thank 
God for this. It is not much, is it ? I wish all the Latter-day Saints 
could say as much in truth. In my associations among the people in 
the stakes I have observed their financial distress, and bondage, and 
my heart has been made sore and in a sense to bleed because of this. 
I believe that much of it, brethren and sisters, might have been averted 
had we given a little more careful thought and consideration, and exer- 
cised a little more wisdom before making our investments and specula- 
tions. Oh, brethren, if we would go to the Lord in that same earnestness 
before making these speculations that we do when we find ourselves in 
trouble, asking him to help us to extricate ourselves, I am sure we would 
be kept out of much of this difficulty. Brethren, we ought not to invest 
in anything, nor to engage in any enterprise that we cannot take to 
the Lord or to our brethren and ask advice and counsel upon, and con- 
scientiously ask God's blessings upon it. Now I admonish my brethren 
and sisters — for the brethren should take counsel with their wives — that 
they heed the admonition of the authorities of this Church, keep out of 
debt. If you are in debt, practice economy, pay your just debts and obli- 
gations as soon as you can, and make peace with your fellowmen, with 
the Lord, and with your own conscience ; then you will be happy ; also be 
faithful in meeting your obligations with the Lord and you shall be 
saved. 

May God help and bless all to this end, I pray, in the name of 
Jesus Christ/ Amen.,

IN DEFENSE OF THE MISSION OF JESUS CHRIST 

We have heard during this conference from a number of the 
speakers concerning the condition that prevails throughout the world ; a 
condition of unbelief in the mission of Jesus Christ and a division 
among those who profess to follow him. Some of those who have 
spoken at this conference have read from the Scriptures wherein the 
prophets of old refer to the condition which should prevail in the dispen- 
sation of the fullness of times. One of the speakers this afternoon read 
from the Book of Mormon certain prophecies concerning the latter days, 
which prophecies are very dear to me. In fact, as I read this volume of 
Scripture I am impressed more and more with its sacredness, with the 
message which it contains in defense of the mission of the Lord Jesus 
Christ, and the gospel which has been restored in the dispensation of 
the fulness of times for the salvation of souls. This record endears 
itself to me more and more day by day as I see unfolded the fulfillment 
of prophecies uttered by these prophets who now speak from the dead, 
and from the dust to the nations of the earth, crying unto them re- 
pentance, and calling upon them to believe in Christ. 

PROPHECY CONCERNING CONDITIONS THAT WOULD PREVAIL 

I am going to read one or two other verses from a prophecy 
that was uttered several hundred years before the coming of Christ, 
concerning conditions that would prevail in the world in this our day: 

"For the kingdom of the devil must shake, and they .which belong to it 
must needs be stirred up unto repentance, or the devil will grasp them with his 
everlasting chains, and they be stirred up to anger, and perish; 

"For behold, at that day shall he rage in the hearts of the children of men, 
and stir them up to anger against that which is good. 

"And others will he pacify, and lull them away into carnal security, that they 
will say : All is well in Zion ; yea, Zion prospereth, all is well — and thus the 
devil cheateth their souls, and leadeth them away carefully down to hell. 

"And behold, others he flattereth away, and telleth them there is no hell; 
and he saith unto them : I am no devil, for there is none — and thus he whispereth 
in their ears, until he grasps them with his awful chains, from whence there is 
no deliverance. 

"Yea, they are grasped with death, and hell; and death, and hell, and the 
devil, and all that have been siezed therewith must stand before the throne of 
God, and be judged according to their works, from whence they must go into 
the place prepared for them, even a lake of fire and brimstone, which is endless 
torment." 

THE MISSION OF THE LATTER-DAY SAINTS 

That is the condition we find in the world today, just as Nephi 
declared it should be; but the mission of the Latter-day Saints is to 



74 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



preach Christ and him crucified. The passage from the 8th chapter of 
John is a key by which we may know the truth ,and by which we may 
walk in the light and in the understanding of the gospel of Jesus 
Christ, neither faltering, nor turning to the right hand nor to left, but 
pursuing our steady course in righteousness and in truth, in full knowl- 
edge that Christ lives and that he has spoken, that he has revealed 
the power of the Priesthood, that he has organized his Church, and 
that there is salvation upon the face of the earth for all who will repent 
and receive the gospel. We shall know the truth if we will only do his 
will, and the truth will make us free. There is no virtue in doubt. 
The man who doubts concerning the principles of the gospel, the rev- 
elations of the Lord, the plan of salvation, is unfortunate. There is 
no reason for it, because as I have said, the key has been given unto 
us by which the door may be unlocked to knowledge so that men may 
say: "I know," and all doubt is removed. 

CONCERNING DOUBTS AND DOUBTING 

I have been very grateful to the Lord for one blessing that I have 
received that I suppose was born with me, and that is the blessing of 
faith in the principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ, and in his mission. 
I do not doubt. I have always accepted fully, and received the in- 
spiration, I believe, through the Spirit of the Lord, that these things 
are true, and I hope that I may always walk in the light, that 1 may 
always possess this spirit and this understanding. I know there are 
those even among us who are not so fortunate, they do have doubts 
arise in their minds, they are troubled at times. Many things pertain- 
ing to the dispensation in which we live, the revelations of the Lord, 
are to them mysterious, they cannot square them with other things 
that they have heard, or perhaps accepted, which are given through the 
spirit of man. The safe course is to follow the revelations of the Lord. 
It matters not what men have said, it matters not what they may 
teach in their own wisdom, if that is in conflict with the revelations 
of the Lord we need not accept it, for we have, as has been pointed 
out : "The more sure word of prophecy," by which we need not stumble 
nor falter nor be in doubt. Occasionally some one arises who feels 
that it is his duty to inform the world that the old members of the 
Church are still faithful in the doctrines that were taught by the Prophet 
Joseph Smith, and by President Brigham Young, but that the rising 
generation is departing from such things, that the children of these 
fathers are turning from the teachings of their fathers, as they put 
it. I am here to testify that this is not true. There may be, of course, 
and are, those among us who are not faithful, who do turn from the 
footsteps of their fathers. It has always been so. We may expect 
that in some cases it will continue, but so far as the Latter-day Saints 
are concerned, the majority of them will not turn from the faith of 
their fathers. It is not destined that such should be the case, for when 
this gospel was restored the Lord declared through his servants who 



ELDER JOSEPH FIELDING SMITH ?$ 



came from the heavens with the message of salvation, that the gospel 
was restored for the last time, and that it must grow and increase 
and the knowledge grow and spread until it shall fill the whole earth. 
That is the destiny of the thing the world calls "Mormonism." • So 
they are wrong in their conclusions when they expect the children to 
depart from the teachings of their fathers. 

Now to return to the question of doubt, and the testimony of the 
truth : I desire to read to you a few passages upon this point which 
I consider to be significant and worthy of consideration. These words 
were uttered in the early years of the organization of the Church : 

"As faith, then, is the principle by which the heavenly hosts perform their 
works, and by which they enjoy all their felicity, we might expect to find it set 
forth in a revelation from God as the principle upon which his creatures here 
below must act in ord,er to obtain the felicities enjoyed by the saints in the 
eternal world." — Lectures on Faith, 7 :6. 

"And again: 

"Let us here observe that a religion that does not require the sacrifice of 
all things never has power sufficient to produce the faith necessary unto life 
and salvation; for, from the first existence of man, the faith necessary unto 
the enjoyment of life and salvation never could be obtained without the sacrifice 
of all earthly things. It was through this sacrifice, and this only, that God has 
ordained that men should enjoy eternal life; and it is through the medium of the 
sacrifice of all earthly things that men do actually know that they are doing the 
things that are well pleasing in the sight of God. When a man has offered in 
sacrifice all that he has for the truth's sake, not even withholding his life, and 
believing before God that he has been called to make this sacrifice because he 
seeks to do his will, he does know, most assuredly, that God does 'and will accept 
his sacrifice and offering, and that he has not sought, nor will he seek, his face 
in vain. Under these circumstances, then, he can obtain the faith necessary for 
him to lay hold on eternal life. 

"It is in vain for persons to fancy to themselves that they are heirs with 
those, or can be heirs with them, who have offered their all in sacrifice, and 
by this means obtained faith in God, and favor with him so as to obtain eternal 
life, unless they, in like manner, offer unto him the same sacrifice, and through 
that offering obtain the knowledge that they are accepted of him. 

"It was in offering sacrifices that Abel, the first martyr, obtained knowledge 
that he was accepted of God. And from the days of righteous Abel to the 
present time, the knowledge that men have that they are accepted in the sight 
of God is obtained by offering sacrifice. And in the last days, before the Lord 
comes, he is to gather together his saints who have made covenant with him 
by sacrifice. (Psalm 1, 3, 4, 5': 'Our God shall come and shall not keep 
silence : a fire shall devour him, and it shall be very tempestuous round about him. 
He shall call to the heavens from above, and to the earth, that he may judge 
his people. Gather my saints together unto me; those that have made a cove- 
nant with me by sacrifice.' 

"Those, then, who make sacrifice, will have the testimony that their course 
is pleasing in the sight of God; and those who have this testimony will have 
faith to lay hold on eternal life, and will be enabled, through faith, to endure 
unto the end, and receive the crown that is laid up for them that love the appear- 
ing of our Lord Jesus Christ. 

I would like to read all of this, but I will only take certain parts of 

it: * >. .'•> ' H . ' • , ' -. ' . i ...j

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



"But those who have not made this sacrifice to God do not know that the 
course which they pursue is well pleasing in his sight; for whatever may be 
their belief or their opinion it is a matter of doubt and uncertainty in their mind; 
and where doubt and uncertainty are, there faith is not, nor can it be. For 
doubt and faith do not exist in the same person at the same time ; so that persons 
whose minds are under doubts and fears cannot have unshaken confidence ; and 
where unshaken confidence is not, there faith is weak ; and where faith is weak 
the person will not be able to contend against all opposition, tribulations, and 
afflictions which they will have to encounter in order to be heirs of God, and 
joint heirs with Jesus Christ; and they will grow weary in their minds, and the 
adversary will have power over them and destroy them." — Lectures on Faith, 
6:7-12. , , , 

MEANING OF SACRIFICE 

I believe that to be true, and let me add that in these passages 
,that I have read, the term "Sacrifice" does not mean that we are to 
inflict punishment upon ourselves. It does not mean that we are to 
be persecuted, or to deprive ourselves of comforts and blessings ; of 
mortal life, not in the least, but that we are willing to place upon the 
altar all things, even our lives, for the kingdom of God, and that we 
will accept in fulness all the principles of the gospel and put them 
into practice. Sacrifice of the world? Yes, if you want to call it 
such, and the things of the world, to a concentration of the mind and 
action upon the things of the kingdom of God, and therefore again I 
repeat that he who will do the will of the Father shall know of the 
doctrine. All doubt will be removed from the mind of the faithful 
believer, and he will stand in perfect light of the gospel of Jesus Christ. 
He will be able to declare unto all the world : "I know, for God through 
his holy Spirit has revealed it unto me." That is the privilege of every 
member of this Church, and where a man doubts the truth then there 
is evidence, as it has been pointed out, that he has not accepted in his 
heart the fulness of the gospel, or he has not put it into practice to 
its fulness, and therefore has not reaped the benefits and blessings 
which otherwise would be his. We stand firmly for the truth in the 
face of the conditions now prevailing in the world, and teach mankind,, 
and call upon them to repent of their sins, and believe in the Lord 
Jesus Christ. That all men may repent and accept him as the Redeemer 
of the world, the Only Begotten Son of God, I pray, for his is the only 
name given under heaven by which we may be saved. This is my 
testimony, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

ELDER REED SMOOTHS HEALTH AND LABORS 

I rejoice in the very wonderful attendance we have had today in 
this building, and in the Assembly Hall, and regret that we do not 
have accomodations for those who have been upon the ground. I have 
been made happy in the testimonies that have been borne thus far 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 



77 



during this conference. I am particularly grateful that Elder Reed 
Smoot has had the privilege of being with us, and of bearing his 
testimony to us here today. From the reports that we received 
of his condition of health I little expected that we would have this 
privilege. I rejoice in the very remarkable and wonderful mission 
that he has been performing as a Senator of the United States. He 
has gained the confidence and the respect of men all over this country. 
In my trips from the Pacific Coast to the Atlantic I came in contact 
with many influential men, and in the Southern states I met many men 
whose training and their politics were in direct opposition to those of 
Senator Smoot. All these influential men expressed to me their ad- 
miration for his devotion to his work as a Seinator. I believe that few 
men have ever made a finer record for themselves in the Senate of the 
United States than Elder Smoot has done. I rejoice in his accomplish- 
ments. I have met influential men from away across the Atlantic 
who have said to me that they had a poor opinion of our people until 
they saw the remarkable and spleen-did work and upright, honest life 
of one of the apostles. One man said : "If you were not a good people 
I am sure that Senator Smoot would not permit himself to be associated 
with you as one of the leaders of your Church." I pray that the bless- 
ings of the Lord may 'be and abide with him, that he may be restored 
to perfect health and strength, and have the opportunity of continuing 
his labors for the benefit of the people of this great country that we, 
as Latter-day Saints, love so well, and believe that the Lord Almighty 
was at the helm when it gained its freedom, and as the revelations say, 
that he inspired the Constitution of our beloved country. 

The choir sang, "O great is the depths", from Mendelssohn's 
oratorio, "St. Paul." 

The closing prayer was offered by Elder Joseph J. Daynes, presi- 
dent of the Grant stake of Zion. 

Conference adjourned until Monday, 10 a. m„ April 6. 



FIRST OVERFLOW MEETING 

An overflow meeting of the conference was held in the Assembly 
Hall at 10 o'clock a. m., Sunday, April 5, 1925. 

Elder Rulon S. Wells, of the First Council of Seventy, presided. 

The music was provided by the Highland Park choir, Elder Gerrit 
Dejong conductor ; Edward P. Kimball at the organ. 

The choir and congregation sang, "Come, come, ye Saints, no toil 
nor labor fear." 

Prayer was offered by Elder Ernest P. Horsley. 

The choir sang an anthem, "The radiant morn."

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



ELDER SAMUEL O. BE.NNION 

President of the Central States Mission 

I am very pleased, my brethren and sisters to be here to attend 
the conference of the Church. The great number of people that I 
have witnessed this morning and yesterday on the grounds and in 
the Tabernacle are an inspiration to me. I feel that I am deeply in- 
debted unto the Lord for the many manifestations of his power and of 
his goodness unto me in my service in the ministry. 

I bring you greetings from the Central States mission, from the 
missionaries who are there, your sons and your daughters, and from the 
people who are there. I can testify unto you that there is faith, much 
faith, to be found among the youth of Zion in the Central States, and 
that your boys and your girls are working hard for the establishment 
of the gospel of Christ in the six states comprising the mission. 

The Lord said that we should judge a tree by its fruits. I thought 
yesterday when the President of the Church was talking; what an 
inspiration it must be to any man, to any woman, regardless of their 
faith, to be able to hear or to read the great truths he taught ; and 
what an inspiration it was to those who were there to witness the 
power with which he spoke. My mind was led to the fact that hun- 
dreds of cities in this great country of ours spend vast amounts of 
money to gather crowds together for celebrations ; they are called upon 
to make donations continually in order to bring people into the centers. 
But here is a great congregation of people gathered together in this 
center of the intermountain region without one cent of advertising 
money having been spent. They come here of their own free will and 
choice, filled with a desire to serve the Lord, to obtain something that 
they can use to establish their lives in the future. And that has 
marked the work of the Church from the beginning. There is not 
any man who can read the history of the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints without being led to conclude that surely there is 
an overruling power that cements and holds its members and keeps 
them intact. 

I am led to think of one of the details of the work of the Lord 
that is going on in the homes of faithful Latter-day Saints. Every 
child, as soon as it is able to lisp a prayer is taught by the mother 
to pray unto the Lord — to pray for father, for mother, for brothers 
and sisters, and relatives ; for the President of the Church and for 
the apostles ; the presidents of the seventies, the bishopric ; the author- 
ities of the Church in the wards and in the stakes ; and for the mis- 
sionaries in the field. This is a part of the life of our boys and girls 
as they grow from childhood to manhood and womanhood, the father 
and the mother setting the example. This thing has established faith 
in the hearts of thousands of Latter-day Saints scattered throughout 
these intermountain regions, and it has made them the power they 
are in the hands of the Lord. People everywhere speak of the 



ELDER SAMUEL 0. BENNION 



79 



devotion of the -members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints to the cause that they represent in the earth. It is a common 
conclusion among the people in the world where our elders go that 
if a man desires to attack a missionary he'd better know where he 
stands before he does it, for they know that the missionaries of the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints are prepared to defend 
the Church, that they have a knowledge of the scripture that the Lord 
has provided for them. It is said that they go to the schools and 
colleges of our Church in order to prepare. The people do not really 
know the fact — that that preparation is begun in the great majority of 
cases with the mother and father at home, that the young people usually 
have not had much practice in public speaking or conversing upon the 
principles of the gospel — perhaps have not taken much part in Church 
activities, yet faith has been implanted in their souls from the beginning, 
and only needs to be kindled and it is aflame and they are found ably 
defending the principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ. They go forth 
testifying unto the children of men that the Lord lives, that he has 
revealed himself anew in this dispensation, that he did speak to Joseph 
Smith, the prophet, that he did authorize him to organize the Church 
in these last days, and that his Church has been establised in the 
earth to last forever, nevermore to be thrown down nor given to another 
people. And the people of the world have learned to conclude that the 
missionaries of the Church of Jesus Christ, as well as those at home, 
are earnest in their endeavors and that it is a marvelous work and a 
wonder that the Lord is performing with his pleople, a small handful 
compared to the countless numbers that inhabit the earth. 

It is a marvel how quickly our boys and girls respond to the call 
that is made of them and how soon they are able to defend the principles 
of the gospel of Jesus Christ in the ministry. A few days ago I had the 
privilege of holding a conference in Independence, Missouri, the place 
which some day will be the great center from which the Church will 
be governed and controlled. It is a holy place, made holy by those 
great predictions, blessings, and appointments that the Lord made in 
the beginning of this dispensation. One of the missionaries at that 
conference said that he had been a little disturbed as to how he was 
going' to meet a question that he knew would be put to him during a 
certain appointment, but that he had been on the street going to his 
work only a few moments when the answer came to him and he was 
able to defend the Church in such a way that his opponent was led to 
listen and in a measure accept his explanation of the gospel. 

The gospel of Jesus Christ is the power of God unto salvation. It 
is the plan by which the children of men come unto God, and there is 
no other. It is the most perfect way of living. The greatest blessing 
and joy and peace that can come to men and to women is to know 
the truth and to obey it, and to be filled with the power of God and 
see his power made manifest in the hearts of those who bear his name 
and who are worthy and faithful enough to declare it. It has been 



80 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



a joy, a privilege, the greatest thing that ever came into my life, to be 
associated with the missionaries of this Church in the different parts 
of the country. There is no place on the earth where there is a better 
feeling than among the men and women who consecrate their time to 
the preaching of the gospel of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. 
They are sweet, they are beautiful, their influence is heavenly, and 
the power of the adversary cannot stand in the presence of the Priest- 
hood and power of the Redeemer, that he has given unto his Church 
in these last days. 

I testify unto you that the Lord lives, and that he has revealed 
this gospel in these last days ; that his Priesthood, his power, his 
authority to preach the gospel and administer in the ordinances of it 
are vested in this Church and are not vested in any other church. I 
have failed to find any one in all my years of experience in the mission 
field who has been able to disprove any principle of the gospel of 
Jesus Christ that the Lord gave to Joseph the prophet. Every attempt 
to prove them wrong has merely verified their truthfulness 'and has 
made the truth of God stronger in the earth. 

It is glorious to be here; it is wonderful to live; to be engaged 
in the work of the conservation of the souls of men in these the last 
days is a privilege that surpasseth all other experience or understanding. 
Qod has been good to me and to those with whom I have had the 
pleasure of associating in the ministry. They have been noble, wonder- 
ful, great characters, and they are in the Church today, the majority 
of them standing in the testimony of Jesus and for the power of God 
in the earth, the result of their birth in these the last days and of 
the faith that their fathers and the mothers have planted within them. 

May God strengthen us, give us power more nearly to keep his com- 
mandments, I ask in the name of Christ our Lord. Amen. 



ELDER CHARLES H. HART 

Of the First Council of Seventy 

On the dav of Pentecost the people were assembled at one place 
with one accord and witnessed some marvelous manifestations of the 
power of the Holy Ghost. They heard, as it were, from heaven a 
rushing, mighty wind — a little different sort of a rushing, mighty 
wind from that which the people of Illinois and Indiana heard last 
month. After they had witnessed the outpourings of the Holy Ghost 
at Pentecost, and Peter, the chief apostle, had given instructions in 
the prophecies of Joel and David, the multitude were pricked in their 
hearts and exclaimed, "Men and brethren, what shall we do?" — 
meaning, as the Apostle Peter evidently understood it, What shall we 
do to be saved? They could have answered that question better if 
they had been able to answer another question which the Master asked 



ELDER CHARLES H. HART 



81 



of the Pharisees, when they were together in the multitude. He asked 
the question saying, "What think ye of Christ? Whose son is he?"— 
a question, by the way, that was answered very clearly and em- 
phatically yesterday by President Grant, by Brother B. H. Roberts, and 
others of the speakers. The M. I. A. this year will have as their 
slogan, "We stand for an individual testimony of the divinity of Jesus 
Christ." The M. I. A. can find in the conference proceedings of 
yesterday much rich material in support of the proposition which they 
desire to establish in the minds of the one hundred thousand members 
of the M. I. A. during the coming year. 

A similar question to that asked by the Master might be pro- 
pounded in this day, "What think ye of Joseph Smith ? Whose prophet 
was he?" and that question was well answered yesterday, and further 
testimony will be given today. , 

But to return to the question at Pentecost, asked by the multi- 
tude under the influence of the Holy Ghost, "Men and brethren, what 
shall we do?" It may not be necessary to give to an audience such as 
this the formula for spiritual salvation. Peter gave some of the es- 
sentials at that time when he said, "Repent ye, and be baptized, in the 
name of Jesus Christ, for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the 
gift of the Holy Ghost." And. to indicate that it was not a temporary 
promise or requirement, he added, "For the promise is unto you and 
to your children and to all that are afar off, even as many as the 
Lord, our God, shall call." I say you are well acquainted with the 
formula, if I may use that expression, for spiritual salvation; but may 
we not anxiously inquire day by day as we return to our homes and are 
confronted by the practical problems of every-day life, may we not also 
in anxiety exclaim and do it prayerfully, Men and brethren, what 
shall we do? Women and sisters, what shall we do? What shall 
we do to be saved — saved financially, preserved in health, and to 
correctly solve all the other problems that are so vital to us ? 

And do you not think this is a part of salvation? The Lord, in 
a revelation to the Prophet Joseph Smith, indicated that salvation was 
not confined to things that we generally understand to be purely 
spiritual. He gave a very broad meaning to the term spiritual. Listen 
to the 34th and 35th verses of the 29th Section of the Doctrine and 
Covenants : 

"Wherefore, verily I say unto you that all things unto me are spiritual, and 
not at any time have I given unto you a law which was temporal ; neither any man, 
nor the children of men; neither Adam, your father, whom I created. 

"Behold, I gave unto him that he should be an agent unto himself; and I 
gave unto him commandment, but no temporal commandment gave I unto him, 
for my commandments are spiritual; they are not natural, nor temporal, neither 
carnal nor sensual." 

And some of the philosophers have reached that conclusion; the 
late Elbert Hubbard put his conviction to the same effect in the form 
of a question when he said, "If we continue to progress, must there 
not come a time when we shall cease to differentiate and call some 



82 



GENERAL CONEERENCE 



things sacred and some things secular?" And, of course, his question, 
put in that form, really answers itself in the affirmative, and it is 
but in confirmation of the information received of the Lord by the 
Prophet Joseph Smith. And so when we return to our homes, exalted, 
refreshed, rested, ready to take up the battle of life again, — we shall 
encounter practical problems. The duty upon the head of the house- 
hold will be to safeguard the health of members of his family. Various 
members of the family may be in need of his help — young men going 
to school, the younger ones passing through the danger period of life, 
and the still younger ones whose footsteps need to be protected. And 
he may well exclaim, not only for his children but for himself and wife, 
"Men and brethren, what shall we do?" 

I saw a poor old man, who appeared, at least, to be very old and 
decrepit, crippled with rheumatism, agonized, but only 63 years of 
age. What was the trouble? In a short time he opened his mouth, 
and I discovered that he had a mouth full of pyorrhea-covered pus- 
bearing teeth, draining their poisonous cocci into his system every day 
that he lived ; various kinds of germs breeding there and being poured 
into his body; — and so he was all crippled up. I said, "Why don't 
you have your teeth taken care of, and get rid of the rheumatism?" 
His tonsils also were diseased, adding to the supply of germs his body 
had to deal with. He said, "I cannot afford it." If that were true, it 
was time for some community assistance, a community dentist or 
doctor, or for some one to be called upon a mission, if necessary, in 
order to take care of his case. He was helping to raise the death- 
rate reported yesterday which we may well be proud of, 7.3 per 
thousand. We hope that every God-fearing Latter-day Saint may be 
proud of those figures ; but in that connection, we must always keep 
in mind the credit due to the entire body and due to us as individuals. 
Let us not go to our homes all puffed up with the thought that we are 
wonderful and great individually, simply because the people that we are 
a part of are entitled to great praise because of a birth rate of 33, a 
death rate of 7.3, and a divorce rate of 15. Let us keep in mind always 
the distinction which the Lord gave through the prophet Joseph when 
he declared that he was well pleased with the people speaking of them 
collectively and not individually. Because good things may be said 
of this people collectively, let us not take them unto ourselves as a 
sweet unction to our souls, if we, as individuals, are entitled to none 
of the credit for these desirable qualities in the Church, because we 
are working against them. 

Again there are financial problems. The father and mother will 
sit down and try to plan whereby they can meet their just obligations, 
taking care of their children, paying their just debts, and being care- 
ful not to contract obligations they cannot pay. I do not have much 
patience with the Latter-day Saints who unnecessarily go into volun- 
tary bankruptcy simply because the government of the United States 
has provided the means whereby a man, under certain circumstances, 



ELDER CHARLES H. HART 



83 



may protect himself. Let us not unnecessarily take advantage of that 
to wipe out our debts. What would you think of President Grant 
if, during the time of financial adversity to him many years ago, he had 
taken the bankruptcy act and wiped out his indebtedness ? What would 
the people think of Abraham Lincoln if he had not insisted on paying 
every dollar of his indebtedness? We are called an honest people, a 
great people, and each one, who shares in the glory which comes to the 
Church he belongs to, should be very careful to contribute his share and 
not to do anything to bring down that general average. In addition to 
these health problems and financial problems there will be wisdom to 
be used not to unwisely educate, not to send the boy or girl to school 
at the time when the father and mother are suffering for the want of 
a little medical attention, for an education that he is not prepared to 
stand, nor to send him abroad to be educated under an infidel, an 
agnostic or unbeliever, only to have him lose the faith, when the father 
and mother have been at home drudging, perhaps, working their 
finger-nails off almost, to keep those same dear children under that 
instruction which will be pernicious for them. The problem will be to 
give our children education as fast as they are able to stand it, but 
not faster than their moral training will allow. 

And so, in these and hundreds of other problems which will con- 
cern the parents in their buying and selling, in their sowing and in 
their reaping, in their safeguarding of their family, in educating of 
them, and in training them to serve others, — the greatest service that 
they can engage in — they may well exclaim every day, "Men and 
brethren, what shall we do to be saved — this day and this week and this 
year?" 

And may the Lord help us to solve all problems aright in each 
one of our households, I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

A solo, the Ninety-first psalm, "He that dwelleth in the secret 
place of the most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty," 
was sung by Mrs. Irene Southwell Cummings. 

ELDER JOSEPH QUINNEY, JR. 

President of the Canadian Mission 

This is one of the privileges that I thoroughly appreciate — being 
called upon to say a few words iduring this great conference of the 
Church. I am thankful beyond my power to express for the blessing 
that has come to me in bemg called into the ministry — to be upon the 
firing line of truth, explaining to the best of my ability the plan of life 
and salvation as taught and practiced by Jesus Christ, the Lord. I am 
coming to feel more and more the great power of this Church, per- 
haps it is because my entire life, together with the lives of my com- 
panions, is devoted to the very highest and deepest things in life, and 



84 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



these things were only found where truth, spoken or lived, is the 
dominating- power in God's revealed plan of life. The last two years 
of my life have been the finest years, I believe, that I have ever spent. 
I think I appreciate more fully the richness of the gospel, what it 
means, and the relationship it bears to human life. It has been my 
privilege to witness many manifestations of God's great power through 
his servants as they have proclaimed and administered the ordinances 
of the the gospel to those in a foreign land. These young men and 
women are measuring up to the responsibilities resting upon them; 
they are choice in spirit and are enjoying - the richness of God's holy 
Spirit, and I want to say to you, especially those of you who have sons 
and daughters in the mission field, that you can feel justly proud of 
them because of the disposition and attitude they assume in responding 
to the responsibilities that are resting upon them as messengers of life 
and salvation to the country of the north. I said that I was grateful 
for the privilege of being a minister of the gospel of Jesus Christ, 
anid those who labor with me feel just the same way, and there is 
nothing that we would riot be willing to sacrifice in order to establish 
this Church or gospel in the hearts of the children of men. It is God's 
saving truth. [ 

The world today, or that part of the world in which I have been 
called to labor, comprises some of the finest people that it has been my 
privilege to come in contact with. The laws of the country are ob- 
served ; they are good laws, and generally speaking, people have respect 
for them and those who disobey the law are conscious always of the 
result. The people in the vicinity of our headquarters are especially 
good people. They are, as a rule, honest in their dealings, sincere in 
their convictions, as far as they are able to understand the great gospel 
plan as it was given by Jesus Christ when he was upon the earth. 
Many of them seem to be self-satisfied with what they have along 
these lines. Notwithstanding this fact, however, we are coming in 
contact daily with people who are not at all in sympathy with the gospel 
as it l has been restored through the instrumentality of the Prophet 
Joseph Smith. The reason for this, or one of the reasons, is because 
of prejudice and their not understanding our message. Many are 
pregnant with the thought that Jesus Christ was just a man — not an 
ordinary man, however, but one of those great men that came into the 
world and through his teachings and life left a great code of moral 
teachings. They do not look upon him as the Redeemer of the world 
and do not credit his literal resurrection. This thought is growing 
among a certain class of people throughout the world, and they are 
placing man's wisdom above that which is supposed to be inspired by 
God through his servants, the prophets. They seem to segregate them- 
selves from that simple, vital faith that is so prevalent among good 
Latter-day Saints, or at least I hope is prevalent, because I have come 
to feel that this simple, yet powerful, faith is the only thing that will

bring real joy and happiness into our hearts. Indeed, I think the 
greatest thing that can take possession of the mind and soul is the 
thought of God, for when we think of God we think of the most holy 
and divine personal Being of which we can conceive, and having faith 
in that kind of a Being, it seems to me causes us to understand more 
perfectly the relationship that obtains between us and him. You can 
rest assured that this vital, genuine faith is one of the great things that 
our missionaries begin to learn as they prosecute this great and mighty 
work in the world. 

We heard yesterday that signs were to follow those who believed. 
I am here to testify to you today that through this simple and abiding 
faith that comes through humility and prayer the gifts of the gospel 
of Jesus Chris are apparent. They are distributed among our young 
men and women who are called from day to day to officiate in the 
ordinances of the restored gospel ; and they witness through their faith, 
the healing of the sick, making the blind to see, and many other mani- 
festations that bring a perfect response to the idea that God lives, 
and that through the operation of his Spirit, those who are believing 
and receiving these blessings are coming into the Church. 

I rejoice in this, my brethren and sisters, for the reason that it 
is building my faith, adding additional testimony to that which I already 
have, and as I see this testimony growing and developing I praise God, 
my eternal Father. I am convinced that God lives, that he hears and 
answers prayers, and that our young men and women, through their 
diligence, are conveying, with conviction unmistakable, the gospel 
message to the hearts of those with whom they are privileged to come 
in contact. You will remember reading the words of Jesus Christ just 
prior to his crucifixion. He had been giving his disciples instructions, 
and telling them what would befall them for preaching his name and 
bearing witness of him as Christ, after which he withdrew himself 
and engaged in secret prayer, imploring his Father in heaven to keep 
firm the testimony that his disciples had obtained. "This is life eternal, 
that they might know thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom 
thoujiast sent." This eternal life is predicated upon the knowledge we 
must obtain from God and his beloved Son, and in order to know God, 
we must have that simple, vital faith in him, and this faith comes to 
every individual through prayer, humility, and determination to un- 
derstand the mighty message of the gospel. I am convinced that one 
of the best things (for us as parents to do is to teach our children the 
necessity of prayer, so that they can cultivate a faith that is inborn with- 
in them, and with this faith know Jesus Christ, and God, the eternal 
Father. I do not know of anything better than for a father and mother 
to call their family to their knees morning and night and thank God 
for the preservation of life, for the opportunity that has come to 
them in this day and time in learning more of the great gospel plan ; 
and the more we know of this gospel plan the more we understand 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



life itself. And understanding life, we become acquainted with God, 
our eternal Father, and his great creation. Aside from family prayer, 
I think we should advocate more strongly the necessity of commun- 
icating with God when we are alone, and convey to him with a perfect 
confidence the things that are in our hearts, making hi m feel and know 
our gratitude for the blessings of life and the opportunities that have 
come to us in knowing more about these precious truths. It is during 
moments of this kind, the solemn hours of life, if you please, where 
we are permitted to gather up all life and place it in the unit of spiritual 
power, and with that power grow strong in faith and have constantly 
the light of God's Spirit with us. And so, my brethren and sisters, 
let us pray alone to God, take him into our confidence, ask him for 
his protecting care, to give us light and power, to enaole us to under- 
stand more perfectly the great truths that have been revealed for the 
perpetuation of his glorious work. 

I desire to bear to you my humble testimony that I know that 
God lives. Indeed, I know as I know that I breathe the breath of life, 
that he does answer prayers, and the blessings in signs are following 
those who have faith in him. The prayer of faith is healing the sick, 
and they stand as great manifestations and as witnesses to the divinity 
of this great work. I have been near death's door more than once, 
anjd I sometimes marvel how it is that he has preserved my life. I am 
thankful beyond measure for the privilege that has come to me to 
bear this testimony in the presence of this great throng of people, and 
with the help of my heavenly Father I desire, with all the power I have, 
to continue to bear witness of God's mercy to me and the great testimony 
I have of the divinity of this great and mighty work. The gospel of 
our Lord Jesus Christ, as it has been restored in this day and time. 
God bless every one of us, that we may appreciate to the fullest, what 
we have in this glorious gospel of our Lord and Master, that we might 
be found worthy of all his blessings. I a:sk this in his name. Amen. 

ELDER JOHN WELLS 

Of the Presiding Bishopric 

It is a pleasure and a privilege to attend the conference gatherings 
of the Latter-day Saints, and at every gathering of this character we 
receive inspiration and encouragement. We get a deeper sympathy 
with the world and all its problems. It is a great privilege to be a 
Latter-day Saint. One of the old prophets said that in the latter days 
there would be a igreat distinction. Men and women would say they 
were "born in Zion," and happy are those to whom this blessing has 
come. 

Yesterday, when I heard the statement made by President Grant, 
showing the progress of this Church, the receipts and disbursements of 



ELDER JOHN WELLS 



87 



its funds, converts to the gospel at home and abroad, the number of chil- 
dren 'baptized into the Church, etc., I thought to myself "What hath 
God wrought!" Then my thoughts went back to the first prayer of 
the Prophet Joseph Smith, when he went into a wooded enclosure to in- 
quire of the' Lord as to which Church he should join, his family having 
already become affiliated with some of the sects whose members were 
proselyting in that neighborhood. I have walked up the little roadway 
leading from the farm-house, and have tried to visualize and picture 
the feelings of that boy as he went into that small enclosure to pray. 
And from that momentous event I again said to myself : "What hath 
God wrought !" 

The time had come when our Father and his Son Jesus Christ 
should again manifest themselves unto mankind, and the boy prophet 
became a new witness for God and was able to testify that God lives, 
that he saw him, that he heard his voice and that he was directed by 
his Son as to what his future conduct should be. 

When we think of the tremendous work the boy prophet did in 
the few short years of his life, we must conclude that it was no easy 
task. He reestablished the gospel of Jesus Christ. By the power and 
gift of God he translated and brought forth the Book of Mormon. 
Under the direction of the Lord a gathering place was established 
around Kirtland, and a few devoted men and women erected their 
house to the Lord — a house which is still holy to the Latter-day Saints. 

I wonder if many of us have tried to visualize what it meant to 
those few people in the way of sacrifice to erect that house' and how 
the Lord blessed them for their efforts. However, there was no rest in 
Kirtland. Persecution became so severe that the prophet and the lead- 
ing brethren moved to the land of Zion, the Lord having revealed 
that this should be the gathering place of the Latter-day Saints. There 
they met the inevitable conflict between the North and the South and 
suffered the consequence, being compelled to move from Missouri to 
Nauvoo, where they settled and developed a community, building a 
magnificent temple. Here the prophet received more doctrine and 
principles of government from the Lord, and the city of Nauvoo grew 
so rapidly that, it bade fair to rival Chicago. 

But the great conflict between the force of evil and the work of 
the Lord again developed. The Latter-day Saints were burdened, 
murdered and compelled to leave their wonderful city and its marvelous 
temple, and journey yet further westward across the wastes of Iowa, 
Nebraska and Wyoming. 

I have often thought of what a weeding-out process this great 
movement proved to be, for if there were any weak-kneed people, if 
there were any whose hearts were not filled with a testimony, they 
could not help but be thinned from the ranks of the Latter-day Saints. 
Many followed former leaders of the Church and strayed away into 
various groups. These have gone into oblivion ; however, many held 
on - to the gospel with what! we might call a "bull-dog grip," coming 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



to these valleys under the masterful leadership of the Prophet Brigham 
Young. Here they occupied these valleys of the mountains and estab- 
lished a new and higher civilization, based upon the gospel of Jesus 
Christ. The world has seen many civilizations rise and fall, most of 
which have been founded upon the lust for power, wealth and dominion 
over others. We have noticed this in the old civilization of Europe. 
Such was the condition in other parts of the world, whereas the Con- 
stitution of our great country was established by men who were in- 
spired of the Lord, and this land of America was redeemed by the 
shedding of blood ; and upon this continent, this land of Zion, there is 
being established a better and a higher type of civilization, based upon 
human liberty and freedom. 

In these valleys the Latter-day Saints are building a higher type 
of civilization, under the guidance and direction of the prophets of 
old, and in obedience to the principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ. 
The civilization of the Latter-day Saints is based upon the statement 
made by our Lord and Master to the man who inquired what he should 
do to inherit eternal life. Our Master said : "Thou shalt love the 
Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all 
thy strength, and with all thy mind ; and thy neighbor as thyself." 
Among the Latter-day Saints there is a spirit of mutual helpfulness, 
sympathy, brotherly love and kindness, a desire to cooperate in all tem- 
poral movements. There is also the spirit of homemaking and the love 
of home and its surroundings ; and the people have a desire to own 
the home in which they live or the land from which they derive their 
living. 

I don't believe in the idea that we should be completely and en- 
tirely satisfied with the progress we are making. Neither do I believe in 
being dissatisfied. All ambitious persons and those who are trying 
for higher ideals should be unsatisfied with their present condition, 
for this alone can bring about efforts to reach greater heights. 

In the 7th chapter of the gospel of Matthew, there is recorded 
some wonderful statements made by Jesus Christ. He warned his 
disciples 'to 

"Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's "clothing, but in- 
wardly they are ravening wolves. 

"Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or 
figs of thistles? 

"Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree 
bringeth forth evil fruit. 

"A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring 
forth good fruit. 

"Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into 
the fire. 

"Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them." 

We Latter-day Saints are willing to accept this standard. With 
all the weaknesses and frailties of human nature, both inherited and ac- 
quired, we are willing to be judged by this standard. 



ELDER JOHN WELLS

A few years ago an eminent man from the East called at the 
Presiding Bishop's office. He was interested in the great charity move- 
ment that has been developed in the United States. He said to me : "I 
hear you have a very low death rate." I answered that this was so. 
He asked if he might see the details of the death report for the last ten 
years and it was handed to him. He then asked permission to examine 
it alone, and upon being told that he might do so, he studied the large 
sheets giving numerous details of the causes of deaths. After a time 
he said : "I am through. I am astounded at the lack of causes of 
deaths from sex diseases. I notice very few, if any, deaths from 
alcoholism;" and he then commented on a number of other causes 
of death, and finally said : "Deaths are the results of the general habits 
and conduct of life." He drew his conclusions from figures. 

While there is room for improvement among our people, we have 
reason to be proud of the results that are being brought about through 
obedience to the gospel. The birth rate among the Latter-day Saints 
is 7.3 to the thousand. Then, the child born to the average Latter-day 
Saint home is welcome. This is indicated by the fact that out of each 
thousand children in the United States, 76 die before they have reached 
one year of age. Among the Latter-day Saints, out of each thousand 
children born, only 41 die before they become one year of age. 

My brethren and sisters, let us go home not satisfied, but deter- 
mined to do better than we have in the past to make our home life sweet, 
to gather our farrtiles around us and keep them fond of home. Let 
us develop a love of our fellow men, sympathy with their misfortunes. 
Let us teach our children to observe the law of tithing, to' observe 
the Lord's day and keep it holy and reserve that day for worship and 
rest, as the Lord desires. These are fundamental duties of the Latter- 
day Saints. 

May his blessings be with us in every honest endeavor to maintain 
the high standard of Latter-day Saints is my prayer in the name of 
Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The choir sang the anthem: "Ye shall dwell in the land." 

ELDER JOHN H. TAYLOR 

President of the Northern States Mission 

I am very grateful, my brethren and sisters, to have the oppor- 
tunity of being with you in the conference meetings. 

I am sure that we all recognize the fact that the teachings of the 
prophet Joseph Smith have modified the religious views of the world. 
It is interesting to meet people and see how they have changed their 
views in regard to the gospel of Jesus Christ. Sometimes our mis- 
sionaries, as they go from door to door and find so little encourage- 
ment go back to their rooms with a thought that perhaps they are 



90 



GENERAL CONEERENCE 



not accomplishing just as much as they could accomplish. I 
tell the missionaries that every time they are able to teach one truth 
to some one who has not understood that truth before, they have 
helped to advance the religious thought of the day, and that from 
this little seed of truth that the people have received they are able to 
understand another truth. By this means will the gospel of Jesus 
Christ fill the whole earth, and men shall worship God and honor Jesus 
Christ, the Son of God, because of the teachings that have been given 
to Joseph Smith from our Father. There is one thought, however, that 
people do not seem to be able to grasp, and that ,is that there is a 
straight and narrow way to get back into the kingdom of God. They 
seem to have the idea that by some inexplicable method they will be 
brought back into his presence, and that irrespective of the things that 
they have done upon the earth, he will forgive them and finally place 
them in the celestial kingdom. I hope that we, as Latter-day Saints, are 
not trying to deceive ourselves in regard to this thing. Men and women 
will only get the reward that they earn upon the earth, and with 
all the mercy that God will extend to them there still remains the 
attribute of justice, and men and women will pay the price of things 
that they do upon the earth if they are to receive the reward that 
God would have them receive in his kingdom. 

We have in the world a number of splendid Latter-day Saints 
who are laboring in the cause of Jesus Christ, men and women who 
are trying to see and understand the value of it and to have it take 
root in their hearts and give forth fruits that will count in the kingdom 
of God. Just a short time ago I received at the office a small box. 
I wondered what was in the box, and in opening it I was very 
much surprised to find that it contained a few dozen eggs, and inside 
of the box was a letter from an old man and woman something like 
eighty years of age living on a rented farm, hardly getting enough 
to hold things together and perhaps at times going without the food 
that they might desire. The letter in the box said, "President Taylor, 
we have no money: we can hardly get along, but we do have a few 
things on the farm, and we are sending in these few dozen of eggs 
that we may pay our fast offering to the Lord's poor." I like men 
and women who have faith to do something and to make the sacrifice 
necessary to be made to gain salvation. 

A while ago I received through the office a letter containing 
just one or two dollars, and in the envelope was a little statement 
from a widow down in one of our towns, with a family to support, 
and she said, "Brother Taylor, this is my tithing — not all that I 
would like to send, because we are hard up, but I am sure that God 
will open the way whereby I can pay my honest tithing to him, be- 
cause I need his blessings. And," said she, "if the worst comes 
to the worst, I have a guitar here in the home that we have had in the 
family for a number of years, and it is dear and precious because of 
the memories of the father and mother and the family, but before the 



ELDER JOHN H. TAYLOR 



91 



year is closed, if it is necessary we will take the instrument out and 
sell it and use the money to pay our tithing to the Lord, that he may 
bless us with the blessings which we as a family so much need." 

That is the kind of faith, the kind of people who count most with 
the Lord, men and women who sacrifice and do things because of their 
faith in the commandments of the Lord. 

My brethren and my sisters, let us not think that just because we 
are members of this Church it is not necessary to remember to 
be honest, generous, and sympathetic, and kind ; because by these 
fruits ye are known, not only by men on the earth but by God in the 
heavens above. And may the Lord bless us and help us and be with 
us, in our daily lives, that we may be worthy of God's blessings and 
mercy, I humbly ask in the name of Jesus Christ, our Redeemer. Amen. 

ELDER RULON S. WELLS 

Of the First Council of Seventy 

One of the most delightful things that characterize our general 
conferences, to my mind, is the presence of our mission presidents. 
It is always a delight to me when a breeze comes in from the mission 
field. It bears with it the spirit of testimony, and I delight to hear 
these presidents as they are called upon from time to time to address 
the congregations. There are, however, many missions that are of 
necessity not represented at our general conferences — those beyond the 
sea, in foreign lands. What a delightful thing it would be if there 
could come a message from all of these various missions! Who knows 
but that the time may yet come, through the wonderful modern inven- 
tions — through the use of airplanes and otherwise — that they may be 
brought from those distant lands and have their voices heard in the 
general assembly of the Church at each conference time? 

During the last few weeks it has been my lot to be very much 
engaged in matters pertaining to the Latter-day Saints that have gather- 
ed up to the land of Zion from those lands beyond the sea, where 
foreign' languages are spoken. Efforts are being made to bring them 
more closely in contact with the general authorities of the Church 
than ever have been made before. The gospel message has been 
carried unto them all in fulfilment of that vision that came to the be- 
loved disciple, who saw "another angel flying through the midst of 
heaven, having the everlasting gospel to proclaim unto them that dwell 
upon the earth, and to every nation, kindred, tongue, and people, and 
crying with a loud voice, Fear God and give glory to him, for the hour 
of his judgment is come." 

In fulfilment of that great prophecy the messenger came from 
the realms above; the gospel has been, and is now being proclaimed 
in many languages and to many people. The honest in heart are 
being gathered into the fold of Christ, and many of them have come 
up to the land of Zion to cast their lots and identify their interests among 



92 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



the people of God. Having come here, sometimes I think they have 
been greatly neglected, through a failure on our part to provide ade- 
quate means whereby they could realize the blessings which they hoped 
for when they left their native lands. They have come up here that 
they might be taught in the ways of the Lord, that they might learn to 
walk in his paths ; and yet, on account of the, to them, strange language 
spoken in the country of their adoption, they were unable to understand ; 
and, of course, it became necessary to provide these people with or- 
ganizations whereby they could hold meetings and hear the gospel and 
the teachings of it in their own native tongues, long before they 
would be able to acquire a knowledge of this English language. 

In order that they might have increased facilities for the holding 
of meetings, where they could be taught the principles of the gospel 
and be brought in closer contract with the presiding authorities of the 
Church and under its more immediate supervision, the First Presidency 
appointed a Committee of which Elder John A. Widtsoe of the 
Council of the Twelve is the chairman, to look into all matters per- 
taining to our foreign language Saints and to have a general super- 
vision over all such gatherings in cooperation, of course, with the 
regular stake and ward authorities. In pursuance of this purpose the 
foreign Latter-day Saints, residing in the six stakes of Salt Lake 
city and vicinity, have recently been reorganized and consolidated into 
one separate organization for each separate language and nationality. 
That is, one for the Danes, one for the Swedes, one for the Nor- 
wegians, and one for the Scandinavians (comprising the above three) ; 
also one for the Swiss and Germans and one for the Dutch, making 
six organizations altogether. 

In the opening remarks of President Heber J. Grant we learned 
that nearly 1,800 people were baptized in the Swiss and German 
mission during the year 1924 (and many will doubtless find their way 
to Zion in due time) and that favorable progress is also being made in 
the other missions. It is therefore highly important that adequate 
provision shall be made to look after the welfare and promote the in- 
terests of these foreign language Saints, handicapped as they are by 
reason of the prevailing language which they are only able to under- 
stand after many years of patient study and practice. And in further 
consideration for these people, the Church has been and is now publish- 
ing foreign language papers, the supervision and management of which 
have also been given to this committee. We who speak our own 
mother tongue, the English language, the language of America, can 
hardly appreciate what it means to these foreigners when they are sud- 
denly plunged into a new country, the customs, manners and language 
of which are to them unknown. 

Through the medium of these foreign language meetings and 
newspapers the Church is endeavoring to render a service of great 
value, a blessing and a comfort to our foreign Latter-day Saints : 
By instructing them in the principles of the gospel ; in teaching them 



ELDER RULON S. WELLS 



93 



their duties in the Church; in assisting and encouraging them to af- 
filiate with the regular organizations of the Church; in teaching them 
loyalty to their adopted country, and how to become real American 
citizens; in giving news from their native lands and the missions in 
which they were converted to the truth ; in giving news from their 
friends and kindred both at home and abroad, and also in inspiring them 
with patriotic love for their adopted country and loyal devotion to the 
great cause of truth for which they have left their native lands. 

There is very much yet to be done in this direction. Not nearly 
enough has been yet translated into their languages. Of course, the 
standard works of the Church are published in those foreign tongues, 
but think of the vast amount of literature that has been written by such 
men as Elders B. H. Roberts, James E. Talmage and others of our 
splendid writers, that ought also to be translated and published in those 
languages. 

Thus it will be apparent that the presiding authorities of the 
Church desire to make adequate provisions for these, our brethren and 
sisters, who like ourselves are of the House of Israel and have been 
converted through the labors of our missionaries, and our hearts 
should go out in love and sympathy for them and in appreciation of 
the peculair difficulties which they have to overcome by reason o'f their 
foreign tongue. And they should be made to feel that they "are no 
more strangers and foreigners but fellow citizens with the Saints and 
of the household of God." 

May the Lord help us to appreciate these things and to do our 
part in helping them feel in very deed that they are our brethren 
and sisters engaged in a common cause, in the upbuilding of the 
Church and kingdom of God. I pray that we may all do so, in the 
name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The choir and congregation sang, "The Spirit of God like a fire 
is burning." 

The benediction was pronounced by Elder Arthur F. Barnes.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



ELDER BRIGHAM S. YOUNG 

President of the N or thvoe stern States Mission 

My dear brethren and sisters, these occasions are very memorable 
in the life of a missionary, because he rarely has the opportunity of 
addressing so large a gathering as the present one. The work in the 
northwest is progressing. Our baptisms, I am happy to state, are 
gradually increasing, the spirit among the Saints is better at present 
than it has been in the past. We are making very strenuous en- 
deavors to erect churches where we lack them in the various places 
where we have organized branches, for (frequently we '.have only 
a Sunday School in some places, while in others we have branches 
with completely equipped organizations, Relief Society, Mutual Im- 
provement Associations, and Primaries. We are rather stressing the 
work of the Primaries; because we find that we are able to and do 
gather into our little associations the children of people who will not 
themselves attend our services. We have some very faithful local 
as well as missionary sisters, who are engaged in Primary work, and 
the average of the mission is that two-thirds of the membership is 
non-"Mormon." The parents in many instances are being interested 
through their children, the children carrying home to parents some 
suggestions of the truths that they have acquired in the Primary as- 
sociations. 

The missionary work which is the particular feature that engros- 
ses the greater part of my attention, because of the fact that I have 
largely to direct the labors in it and do not to the same degree come 
in personal contact with the brethren and sisters who constitute the 
various organizations — is of the character that I cannot speak in too 
high terms of the workers, their excellence, their faithfulnesss, their 
cleanness, the beauty of their lives and the strength they manifest in 
proclaiming the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ is an inspiring thing 
to any olne who has the opportunities that I have had to observe it so 
closely. 

We endeavor to teach the missionaries not only the gospel of 
Jesus Christ (and I refer more particularly to the first principles of 
the gospel), but we are also endeavoring to implant in their hearts 
a proper idealism of the greatness of this work with which we are 
associated. We endeavor to teach them that the missionary experience 
they are enjoying is only a small part of what is expected of them in 
the Church of Jesus Christ, that it is merely the laying of the fonnda- 
tion upon which they may build their future lives. We are endeavor- 
ing to establish in their hearts and consciousness the ideals of "Mor- 
monism," the greatest ideals that God has ever given his children to 
enjoy We teach them that they have come to the earth lor a specific 
purpose, that that purpose is the salvation of the souls of men, that 
the mere fact that they are in the field for a couple of years is onlv 



ELDER BRIG HAM S. YOUNG

incidental to the life that they are expected to lead, to the work they 
are expected to perform. And they are faithful, they are attentive in 
their desire, and endeavor to acquire a knowledge not only of the 
gospel but of the things pertaining to the progress of civilized peoples, 
the history of the world, and the association that men and women 
have with each other, all of which should have for its object the bene- 
fiting of society. These are the fundamental things we endeavor to 
teach the missionaries. They sometimes come to us crude; they come 
to us with a lack of understanding; they come to us sometimes with 
but little education ; and to the degree that they lack education, to that 
degree are they handicapped. We are learning that in order to reach 
any class of people you_must have a man or representative who is cap- 
able of teaching that class of people. And, while the boys and the 
girls are highly successful in their contacts with men of affairs, we 
find the more highly educated they are, the greater is their sphere of 
usefulness. I am convinced that the standards of education are being 
constantly advanced in our community, not alone for the purpose of 
improving the power of the missionaries, but that also we may rise 
to the lofty plane that sometime we must occupy in filling our destiny; 
for, as Brother Stephen L. Richards said yesterday, we are a great 
people, and there is no power that can prevent us from occupying a 
high place in the history of the world, if we will be true to the ideals 
that God, through his servants, has revealed to us. 

Speaking again of the Northwest, we have an Indian school on 
the Fort Peck Reservation, in Montana, which is maintained by the 
Church. We have at the present time thirty pupils in that school, 
which is the crowded capacity of the school. We cannot, with our 
present force of missionaries — for we are limited on the Reservation as 
well as in other parts of the mission — send out among the people of 
that tribe, the number of missionaries necessary to have contact with 
all the residents of the reservation. But we do take as many of their 
children into our schools as we can accomodate and teach them there 
the principles of the gospel, while at the same time we are giving them 
the fundamentals of education. We board them, and we provide lodg- 
ing for them ; they live at the mission home during the entire school 
year. And while some of the adjoining schools, which are conducted 
by other churches, have some difficulty in retaining their pupils, keep- 
ing them within the confines of the school, we have the same diffi- 
culty in getting the Indian children to go home and remain there, 
owing to the different spirit that characterizes the teaching of your 
boys and girls as its influence is reflected in the hearts and minds of 
those little children. I have seen them hang about their teachers in at- 
titudes of almost worship, because those boys and girls love these 
Indian children, and you cannot touch the Indian heart, any more 
than you can touch any other human heart, except by the glorious emo- 
tion of love. And so the Indian children love your sons and daughters,

and there has come to be a great respect for the ''Mormon" people. 

It was only a few days ago that I was in Wolf Point and had 
the opportunity of conversing with two of the chief Indians of the 
Assinniboine and Sioux tribes, George Conners and Meade Steele. 
I had met with them a year or more ago and they had asked me for 
letters to our senators and representatives in Congress, at Washing- 
ton. I had been very glad to comply with that request, particularly 
as I have the honor of being a personal friend of Senator Reed Smoot, 
of Senator William H. King, and also of Commissioner Spry, who is 
located in Washington. My correspondence has been chiefly with 
Senators Smoot and King, and these Indians testified to me that never 
had they met with such kindliness of treatment as was accorded them 
by these brethren. And, said they, "We have taken our other Indian 
friends, of tribes from other parts of the states, Oklahoma, and other 
places, and introduced them to Senators Smoot and King, and it is 
our fervent testimony that we have never had the same success in 
achieving our rights as has been accorded us under the able advice and 
tutelage of Senators Smoot and King." And so they say, "We know 
that your people are our friends; the great men among your people 
have evinced such great interest in the Indian affairs." And they both 
testified to me that by reason of the kindness they had received at 
the hands of our brethren they had been led to investigate the faith 
of, the Latter-day Saints, and each of them testified they knew the 
Book of Mormon to be true, because they had read it from cover to 
cover, and because it told them, illustrated to them the great truths, 
in a plainer and more direct manner, of the legends which are so 
generally maintained among them. 

The mission, as I have said, is prosperous. We are, I hope, 
doing our job. It is the desire of your sons and daughters to do the 
thing they have been sent there to do, and I would like the parents and 
the friends of the boys and girls in the mission field to encourage them 
in their work. But do not send them too much money ; they are just 
as well off without it. The boys and girls who have accomplished 
missions on the least money have evinced the highest development. 
So if you would have your boys and girls properly educated as mis- 
sionaries, do not in the kindness of your hearts, send them too much 
money. You may even stint them a little and it will not be to their 
injury. Sometimes young people, not having had previous experience 
in the expending of money, as is the case with some of them, do not 
always spend it judiciously. While they are good, they are just young 
people, and we may not be too lavish with our children, because lavish- 
ness in parents has a tendency to break down the finer and better morale 
of the nature than to increase it. Remember, brethren and sisters, 
that our fathers worked for what they had, as you doubtless are doing, 
and as I know in many instances the parents and friends are doing 
to maintain in the missionary fields their boys and girls, at great sac-

rdfice to themselves ; and it is only proper that the boys and girls in 
the field should share in those sacrifices. 

1 am grateful to you, to the Church, to the leaders of our com- 
munity, to God, for the opportunity he has given me for the associa- 
tions I enjoy with your sons and daughters. They are a great in- 
spiration to any man who observes their faithfulness and the beauty 
of their lives. Endeavor to encourage them when they shall return, 
that they may continue in the spirit of missionary labor; for if this 
people shall once come to realize their real mission in life, they will 
know that they are missionaries — not missionaries in the word alone 
but missionaries in every act of their lives. You cannot understand 
or know, how much you affect your environment by your acts, but 
every man every day writes his impress on the universe by the acts 
of his life, by the thoughts of his heart, by the words that he speaks ; 
and the highest idealism in "Mormonism" is that we shall save these 
children of our Father. Let us be worthy of the great heritage that 
has come to us from our forebears; let us be faithful to God. My 
testimony to you is that your boys and girls are faithful to God. They 
are striving to the full, as opportunity is afforded them, to perform 
the duties that they have gone out into the world to perform. 

My testimony is, brethren and sisters, that this is the gospel of 
Jesus Christ. This is the work of God. And your boys and girls 
are learning it by contrasting it with other religions, so called, of the 
world, and they are learning that "Mormonism" is indeed the truth 
of the Lord Jesus Christ That we may be worthy of what God has 
promised us, and that we may live so as to enjoy it, I humbly ask in 
the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER EUGENE J. NEFF 

President of the Hazvaiian Mission 

I believe my throat was never so dry as it is upon this occasion. 

I come from the land of Hawaii, from the land of perpetual sun- 
shine and flowers. I bring to you the love and greetings of our 14,000 
Saints who live on those fairy islands. I believe that there is no place 
in all the world, with the exception possibly of the stakes of Zion, 
where the gospel has been so firmly established as it has been in 
Hawaii, among those chosen people of Joseph. I commend the work 
of the people who were missionaries there in the early days of the 
Church, and who labored so assiduously to establish the work so 
firmly upon those islands. I believe that there has never been a man 
in Hawaii who has done more for the establishing of the cause of 
truth and righteousness in the Hawaiian Islands (except possibly it 
be the late Presidents Joseph F. Smith and George Q. Cannon) who 
has devoted his time, his ability, and talents to the growth of the 
work there any more than Samuel E. Woolley, who died day before

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



yesterday. I mourn his loss, because J know of the great good he has 
done among the people on those islands. I know their love for him, and 
I know the sorrow which will he in their hearts when they learn of his 
passing away. T believe, however, that it is the will of the Lord that 
lie should go, because his life the last few years has not been as happy 
as it might have been, and I believe in the spirit world he will have 
the privilege and the opportunity of laboring with the departed spirits 
of those people whom he so dearly loved. 

During the recent centennial anniversary of the Protestant churches 
in Honolulu, one of the speakers arose and said that in one hundred 
years and with the expenditure of vast fortunes, running into millions of 
dollars, the Protestant church had converted ten to twelve thousand men, 
while the "Mormon" Church had been there thirty years less time and 
had expended practically no money but had converted between sixty and 
seventy thousand people. They came to me and wanted to know why 
it was that the "Mormon" Church was able to reach the hearts and 
minds of the people more than they had done, and I told them our 
system of work among the people. Their representative replied, "I 
do not see so much difference in that." And I told him that it was not 
so much, possibly, in that, as in the fact that those people are the 
chosen seed of Joseph, and susceptible to the teachings of true religion. 

I have seen the heathen Chinaman, the Mohammedan Jap, those 
who had no belief in God, through intermarriage with the Hawaiian 
people the children of whom have become believers in the living God, 
who are susceptible to the gospel of Jesus Christ. I have never seen 
an infidel among the Hawaiian people ; I have never seen one who 
denied a belief in the true and living God. 

During a recent convention of sugar men in Washington, D. C, 
the Governor of the Territory was present. — And I might say that 
we have labored for the past twenty-five years to be recognized as a part 
of the United States, as a territory of the United States and not as 
an insular possession. It has been felt by some people that Hawaii 
should be merely an island possession of the United States, but it is 
a territory and has rights as a territory and is today being recognized 
as a territory. I have come here with the intention of convincing 
people here in Zion, if I can, that we are no longer a mere island of 
the sea, set apart from the people of the United States, but a part 
and portion and an integral part of the United States. — The Governor 
of Hawaii, made this assertion before some of our Utah sugar men, 
who were there gathered, "There has never been a church in Hawaii 
that has done more for the uplift of the Hawaiian people than the 
Latter-day Saints." And he further concluded by saying, "They are 
our foremost citizens of the Territory of Hawaii in the work of 
rehabilitating the Hawaiians." 

A law was passed by Congress a few years ago appropriating 
one million dollars to make possible the return of the Hawaiians to the 
soil. The Governor of the Territory made application to me to find one 



ELDER EUGENE ]. NEFF 



99 



of our returned "Mormon" elders, who had labored among the Hawai- 
ian and who was familiar with western farm life, to go there and direct 
|the rehabilitating of the Hawaiian people on the farms 

Mr. Samuel W. Robely, the Scout executive of" Hawaii met 
Oscar A. Kirkham in one of their conventions. He was found smoking 

Y l P?S r t ; K i rk ia T- Br ° ther Kirkham Patted him on the back and 
said, Robely, I think a great deal of you, but I would think a great 
deal more of you, and I believe you would make a better Boy Scout 
leader, if you would not smoke." Mr. Robley told me himself that he 
has never lit a cigarette or cigar silnce, but he has been reminded of the 
words of Oscar Kirkham. In a convention of Boy Scouts in Honolulu 
he made this assertion, "Before we become successful in some of our 
;Boy Scout organizations, we will have to convert these people to 
''Mormonism," to make them better Boy Scouts. For the state of 
Utah leads in the Boy Scout movement." 

We have in Hawaii today a man from Wisconsin who claims that 
fee is going to revolutionize the religious world; he is going to take 
pie best out of all the religions and put it together and make 
a religion that can be comprehended by all— a religion that is modern 
and not one that was fit and suitable for the Jewish people only. 
[He came to me and wanted to know what there was in our religion that 
we considered best, that would be fit and proper to make a part of this 
.new religion which he is trying to form. And I told him that I 
thought that we had that formed just as completely as any man-made 
religion and more so. He said, "I am not trying to make a religion of 
gory own, but I want to modernize Christianity and make it suitable to the 
day in which we live." And he told me of the churches in the east who 
liad two of the ten commandments from the Decalogue and substituted 
two others. The first was, "In six days the Lord made the heavens and 
Bie earth, the seas and the fountains of water, and all that in them is, 
and rested the seventh day." He said, "You don't believe that; that 
would be all right for the Jews in their day, but in our day, these 
[modern times, we cannot accept that doctrine and we have got to 
modernize Christianity." I told him that it was, possibly, because we 
Hid not understand the creation of this earth. We were in our church 
building at that time, which is built of concrete and lumber. I told 
pirn to examine those timbers and tell me how old the meetinghouse 
Etnight be, but he told me it was but a few years old. Then I said, 
Blow old are the timbers in this meetinghouse?" And he told me 
fthey might be many years old. And I said, "How long has it been 
since those timbers grew on the mountain side? How old was the seed 
from which those timber grew? And before that, where was the 
tree which produced the seed that grew the timbers which we sawed into 
lumber and made into that building?" I said, "It can go back to 
eternity ! In fact, all matter is eternal ; there is no creation of matter, 
but merely an organization." He said to me, "It is the first time I have 
lever understood it in that way ; I supposed the Lord created and brought 



100 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



these things to pass by the word of his mouth." And I told him that 
I thought he did not, any more so than we organized the building out ^ 
of materials which did not exist. 

The other thin?, he said, that we have got to substitute another 
thing for is the statement that the sins of the parents rest upon the 
children unto the third and fourth generation. He said, "this is un- 
kind unjust; no loving God would ever be so unkind and unjust to 
his children.'' I said. "All that I would ask you to do is make a 
trip to Molokai, the island of the lepers, that prison which is bounded by 
the ocean on three sides and a perpendicular precipice of 2,000 feet on 
the other side— a natural prison, where all those who have contracted 
leprosy are placed— and upon this island I will prove to you that the 
sins of the fathers do rest upon the children unto the third and fourth 
generation." I have seen those who have been afflicted with this 
dreadful disease, whose children have not had the disease, whose 
grandchildren have not had the disease, but in the third and the fourth 
generation I have seen leprosy break out among the descendants of those 
people who had that disease before. No one can tell me, I said, that 
the sins of the parents do not rest upon the children unto the third 
and the fourth generation of men. 

I am happy to be engaged in the missionary work. I come from 
the firing line, from the front, where we are battling to establish the 
kingdom of God and righteousness among the children of men. We 
have arrayed against us Satan and his forces ; we have come in conflict 
with them many times, but I am thankful to say that nearly every 
time we have come out victorious, and the splendid sons and daughters 
you are sending into the mission field are valiant fighters for the cause 
of truth and libertv in the world. I am happy in the thought that I 
have been called to' labor among such splendid young men and women. 
The early part of my life was cast among people who were not devout 
religionists, who were not given to religious worship; but today my 
whole life is devoted to the cause of truth and the labor among these 
splendid boys. I have heard them testify many times of the inspiration 
and love which they have from me. I want to bear testimony also 
that I receive inspiration from them; the love which I have for your 
sons and daughters in the mission field is almost akin to brotherly love, 
to the love which I have for my own brothers and sisters. 

The Hawaiian mission is prosperous, one of the biggest missions 
in the Church. I believe there are no sincerer, truer Latter-day Saints 
in all the world than we have upon the islands of the sea. I pray God 
that the spirit of the missionary work may penetrate the hearts of you 
fathers and mothers who are here at home, that you may be able to let 
your sons and daughters go into the mission field, that you will be will- 
ing to make the needed sacrifice to maintain them in the mission field as 
long as their services are needed. 

May the Lord bless us all. I testify to you that God has again 
spoken from the heavens, that his Church is again established on the 



ELDER EUGENE J. NEFF

earth, and that all that learn to obey his commandments and walk in 
obedience to the laws, will receive the blessings of eternal life in the 
celestial kingdom of our heavenly Father. May this be our happy lot, 
I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

Calloway, Milton Fisher and DeVon Meacham, sang, "Send out thy 
Light." 

ELDER A. WILLIAM LUND 

Assistant Church Historian 

I most humbly desire, my brethren and sisters, an interest in your 
faith and prayers for the few moments I may occupy this afternoon. 
I am thankful for the privilege I have had of attending the meet- 
ings, thus far, of our wonderful conference, and to have received 
the instructions of our president and other elders of the Church who 
have spoken to us. I rejoice in my membership in the Church of 
Jesus Christ. I value it above everything I have. I hope and trust 
that I may always be faithful and true to the covenants which I have 
made, with my Father, an(d that we all may be true to the covenants 
we have made with our Father when we accepted the gospel of Jesus 
Christ and took upon ourselves his name. 

The beautiful song just rendered, "Send out thy Light," seems 
to have been fulfilled in the sending forth of the missionaries of this 
Church, sending them out to preach the everlasting gospel, the light of 
the world, which will lead us back into the presence of our Father. 
These missionaries are clothed with his power to go into the world 
and preach unto men the gospel of life and salvation having the same 
Priesthood and power that have always made clear to the world the 
difference between the Church of God and all other churches. This 
Priesthood is the distinguishing feature which makes us the Church 
of Jesus Christ. It is God's power unto this people to act in bis name, 
so that they may carry forth the message of salvation, perform the 
ordinances of life eternal, so that men and women, obeying the 
gospel message, may enter his Church. This power of God has always 
been with his people from the very 'beginning. Whenever there has 
been a prophet of God among the children of men, he has been clothed 
with the power, the Priesthood of God, to act in his name. It is 
through this Priesthood that the revelations of God are given to men. 
It is the channel of revelation, it is that which constitutes a man the 
president of his Church and his prophet upon the earth. 

The power of this Priesthood has been manifested in many dif- 
ferent ways. It is manifested in the organization of the Church ; the 
healing of the sick ; the raising of the dead ; the wonderful prophetic 
utterances, and in the miracles that the prophets performed when they 
were upon the earth. 



102 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



It was by the power of the Priesthood that Elijah sealed the 
heavens, so that for three years no rain fell in the land and a sore 
famine afflicted the people. It was by this same power of the Priest- 
hood that Elijah raised the dead boy. Yon remember the story of how 
he went and lived with a widow and her son, during this famine; that 
they had just a little meal and oil which lasted until the fan line abated. 
The son was taken sick and died. The mother came to Elijah com- 
plaining that he had come to call her sins to remembrance and slay 
her son. The Prophet asked for her son and took him to his own 
room where, by the Priesthood he held, he raised this boy from the 
dead and brought him back again to his mother. 

It was the power of this Priesthood which gave Moses the ability 
to do the wonderful miracles that he did. Moses was called of God 
and was ordained, we are told in the Doctrine and Covenants, under 
the hands of Tethro, the priest of Midian, a man having the authority 
of God. and w*ho gave it to Moses. When Moses was instructed by 
God to go down into the land of Egypt and bring out of bondage the 
chosen people, the Israelites, he went clothed with the power of the holy 
Priesthood, and he made manifest to these people more than once the 
power of God in their behalf, that they might be taught again that 
there is a God in heaven, the God of Israel. They had lived for some 
hundreds of years in Egypt, under the teachings of the Egyptians, and 
had departed from the true and the living God in that they were wor- 
shiping idols. This is evidenced in the "fact that when Moses was 
away from the camp in the mountains, a short time, about forty days, 
receiving from God instructions to take back to the people and teach 
them the plan of life and salvation, the people prevailed upon Aaron 
the brother of Moses, to make a calf which they might worship. Now. 
the calf represented one of the gods of the Egyptians and Israel re- 
turned to the worship of idols while Moses was away. When Moses 
came down to the camp and heard the peoule singing, he asked what 
was going on, and when Joshua told him of the conditions, he cast the 
tablets of stone to the ground and broke them, even though they had 
written upon them, by the finger of God himself, the commandments 
which he desired taught unto his people. He went into the camp, de- 
stroyed the calf and scattered about the broken pieces, and then went 
back into the mountain to appeal to the Lord to forgive his children. 

Here is an example of strength and character that the Priesthood of 
God gives to a man when he obeys the principles and teachings of the 
gospel of Jesus Christ, for no greater temptation can ever be placed 
in the path of man than was given to Moses at this time. The Lord 
offered to make of Moses a mighty na - i<m : c ffered to make his seed 
numerous as the sands upon the seashore ; offered Moses the right 
that, through his seed all nations might be blessed, but Moses said, 
Not so, O God, thou hast made this covenant with thy servant Abra- 
ham and thy servants Isaac and Jacob, that of them thou wouldst 



ELDER A. WILLIAM LUND 



103 



make many nations auid that through their seed should all nations 
be blessed. Moses refused to accept of this wonderful blessing. He 
proved himself true to the trust and calling that God had given to him. 
He came back into the mountains and prayed to God, that he would 
forgive the people of Israel, and pleaded with him and wanted to know 
what the people of Israel would think of this kind of a God, that 
would take his children out into the wilderness and then destroy them. 
Moses offered himself that God destroy him and blot his name out of 
the book of remembrance, that he should never foe numbered more 
among the children of men, if only God would forgive the children 
of Israel. God did not withstand the pleadings of that faithful man, 
and he forgave the children of Israel their transgressions. 

This power of the Priesthood, when exercised rightly, heals the 
sick and raises the dead. You rememner the wonderful miracles that 
Jesus Christ himself did among the children of men. When the apostles 
after him went among the people, preaching unto them, they, too, did 
many wonderful things in the name of God. One striking example: 
after Peter and John had been away preaching for some time, they 
were returning to the city of Jerusalem, and as they neared the gate 
of the temple, called "Beautiful," there was a lame man there begging 
alms. He had been lame from his childhood, and begged alms of 
Peter and John. Peter said to him, "Silver and gold I have none; but 
such as I have, give I thee. In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth 
rise up and walk." And he arose, was made whole, through the ex- 
ercise of this Priesthood of God which Jesus Christ himself had given 
to Peter and to John. 

In the days in which we live, I testify to you in 'humility, this 
same power of the Priesthood of God has been made manifest. In the 
early history of the Church, one member of the Church, Elijah Ford- 
ham was lying very ill, in fact, he was upon his death bed. The 
Prophet Joseph came into the room and asked him if he knew him, 
and he said "Yes," then the prophet asked him if he had faith in God 
that he could be healed, and he said, he had. Then Joseph, taking 
him by the hand, said, "Brother Fordham, I command you, in the 
name of Jesus Christ, to arise from this bed and 'be made whole." 
And he arose from his bed and was made whole. 

This power also brings to the prophets of God a knowledge 
of things that shall come to pass. On the sixth day of August, 1842, 
the Prophet Joseph made a prophecy that the people should be led to 
the valleys of these mountains, that many would die from exposure, 
some from hardships that would befall them, but the Saints would 
come and build a wonderful colony here in the tops of the mountains. 
It has been literally fulfilled. This same spirit of prophecy rested 
upon President Brigham Young", the man who succeeded the Prophet 
"Joseph in the presidency of God's Church. Out on the plains, in 1846, 
he told the brethren that a temple of God would be erected in the tops 



104 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



of the mountains, and that endowments would be given in the tops 
of the mountains, which has been literally fulfilled. After the Saints 
had been driven from Nauvoo, where the people had received the 
blessing's of God in that wonderful temple, built by the sacrifice of our 
people both in time and means, and after suffering untold hardships, 
they came into this valley. Just a few .days after their arrival, President 
Young with some other members of the Twelve were standing upon 
this Temple block, when President Young struck his cane in the ground 
and said, "Here we will build a temple unto God." President Wilford 
Woodruff bears testimony that the temple was built upon the spot where 
President Young drove his cane into the ground. How did President 
Young know that the people would even stay here when they got here? 
How did he know that they would give of their time and their means, 
amounting to about four millions of dollars, for the erecting of that 
temple, except by the revelations of God, and by the witness of the 
Spirit of God to him that this was true? 

And so, if time permitted I could enumerate many other instances, 
showing that this Priesthood of God is with this people. I bear you 
my humble testimony, my brethren and sisters, that I do know that 
this is God's work, that this is his Church, that the men who have stood 
at the head of this Church are prophets of God, that the man who stands 
at the head of the Church today has the keys of the Holy Melchizedek 
Priesthood, the power of God to open the door of life eternal to all the 
world, the power to save every child of God if he will obey the gospel 
of our Lord and Master. 

I bear you my witness that God lives, that Jesus is the Christ, and 
that his gospel is the power of God unto salvation, through Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 

ELDER ANDREW JENSON 

Assistant Church Historian 

T have enjoyed the remarks made by the previous speakers and have 
listened with attention to the reports from the two presidents of mis- 
sions and to the historical narrative by Brother Lund. 

After listening also to the excellent discourse delivered this morn- 
ing by President Ivins, in which he recited the beautiful story of the 
Israelites, and also referred to the return of the Jews to their land — ■ 
their original land of inheritance — I was led to reflect upon an event 
which took place in Kirtland, Ohio, on the 3rd of April, 1836, when 
Moses appeared in the Kirtland temple and delivered unto Joseph 
Smith and Oliver Cowdery the keys for "the gathering of Israel from 
the four parts of the earth and the leading of the Ten Tribes from 
the Jand of the North." We understand by this that it referred not 
only to the Jews, but to the other tribes of the House of Israel as well, 
and that it means a general gathering dispensation. Many centuries 



ELDER ANDREW J EN SON 



105 



ago, the children of Israel were scattered to the four corners of the 
earth, but in the last days God, according to prophecy, will cause them 
to be gathered again from the islands of the sea, from the lands of the 
north, and from wheresoever they have been driven. In connection 
with this, I was thinking of some notes that I made recently regarding 
the preaching of the gospel in the different nations of the earth, as the 
question may consistently be asked : Have the Latter-day Saints been 
faithful and diligent in preaching the gospel to the nations and in 
gathering Israel? 

Jesus instructed his apostles, shortly before he ascended into 
heaven, to go out into all the world and preach the gospel to every 
creature. John, in his vision upon the Isle of Patmos, saw an angel 
flying through the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to 
preach to every nation, kindred, tongue and people. We see the ful- 
filment of that prophecy in the visit to Joseph Smith by the angel 
Moroni through whom the elders of the Church in our dispensation 
received their first commission to preach. 

While Joseph was engaged in translating the Book of Mormon, 
assisted by Oliver Cowdery, in Harmony, Pennsylvania, and in Seneca 
county, New York, in 1829 and 1830, they testified of the restoration 
of the gospel to the people in these localities and when these men had • 
been ordained to the Priesthood by John the Baptist, and, according to 
the command that he gave them, had baptized and reordained each 
other, they commenced to baptize others. The next to be baptized 
after Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery was Samuel H. Smith, a 
brother of the Prophet Joseph. From that time on until the 6th of April, 
1830, about thirty people were baptized altogether, and on the day 
mentioned, as you remember, the Church was organized, with six 
members. Of those baptized only six members seem to have been 
present when the organization was effected at Fayette ; at least the 
Church was organized with six members whose names are known. 

As soon as that was done, the preaching of the restored gospel 
commenced in earnest. Oliver Cowdery preached the first public 
discourse ever delivered by a Latter-day Saint elder in this dispensation, 
on Sunday, the 11th of April, 1830, and I venture to say that since that 
memorable Sunday there has never been a Sabbath day but what the 
elders of the Church have lifted up their voices and borne testimony 
to the truth of the gospel. At the present time several thousand elders 
raise their voices every Sabbath day preaching the gospel of Jesus 
Christ in the various stakes of Zion as well as in the missionary fields. 

Among the first elders of the Church was Peter Whitmer, Jr., who, 
together with Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery, as early as April, 
1830, commenced missionary journeys away from Fayette. One of their 
first trips was to Colesville, in Broome county, New York, about thirty 
miles from Fayette, where the Church had just 'been organized. In 
Colesville, the first convert to the restored gospel was Newel Knight, 



106 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



who afterwards became prominent in the Church. Soon a number of 
others embraced the gospel in that neighborhood, and so it is recorded 
in Church history that the Colesville branch was the first branch of the 
Church organized after the first organization in Fayette, New York, 
and it was also the first branch of the Church that fulfilled the com- 
mand of "gathering to Zion." The Colesville branch led the van of 
the gathering of Israel in these last days by traveling as a body about 
1300 miles from Colesville, New York, to the place designated for 
gathering, in Jackson county, Missouri. 

Soon after that, other elders entered the missionary field preach- 
ing the gospel. Thus Samuel H. Smith also became one of the first 
missionaries of the Church. He went to Lavonia, Livingston county, 
New York, and after suffering much persecution, the elders succeeded 
in getting a foothold there, and branches of the Church were soon 
afterwards raised up in that neighborhood. 

In August of the same year, Joseph Smith, Senior, and Don Carlos 
Smith performed a mission to St. Lawrence county, New York, where 
they converted a number of the Smith family. It seems that all of 
these except two became members of the Church, and most of them 
remained faithful and true adherents to the faith the rest of their 
• lives. 

In October, 1830, Oliver Cowdery, Parley P. Pratt, Peter Whitmer, 
Jr. and Richard Ziba Peterson were called by revelation on a special 
mission to travel to the far west to preach the gospel to the Lamanites, 
and thus a few months after the Church was organized, our missionaries 
had gone as far as 1300 miles away from Fayette preaching the gospel 
on the way, not only to the Lamanites but aho to the whites. 

I am relating these things, my brethren and sisters, that you may 
know that we have been diligent in keeping the commandments of the 
Lord in regard to preaching the gospel of Jesus Christ. First we 
preached in the United States, but after the keys had been given by 
Moses for gathering Israel, as has been referred to, the Elders also 
went into foreign lands. 

It may be interesting to know who the first elders in the Church 
were, and not only that, but who were the first missionaries of the 
Church — the first of the many thousands of missionaries who since 
have preached the gospel in nearly all parts of the world. We have 
between 1500 and 2,000 elders out in different parts of the world 
preaching the gospel at the present time. It has always been interesting 
to me to know who preceded me in preaching in the different localities 
where I have labored, and I imagine that the same is the case with 
others. The first sixteen missionaries in the Church were Joseph 
Smith, Jr., Oliver Cowdery, John Whitmer, David Whitmer, Samuel H. 
Smith, Joseph Smith, Sr., Don Carlos Smith, Parley P. Pratt, Hyrum 
Smith, Newel Knight, Richard Ziba Peterson, Peter Whitmer, Jr.,

Sidney Rigdon, Frederick G Williams, John Murdock and Orson Pratt, 
These elders alt labored as missionaries in the year 1830. 

It may be interesting for Patriarch Milando Pratt, who is present 
with us in this meeting, to l know that his father, Orson Pratt, was 
among the first missionaries of the Church, 'being only nineteen years 
old when first called into the ministry. He had been baptized on his 
birthday and soon afterwards was ordained to the Priesthood and sent 
out to preach. Orson Pratt died in 1881, a faithful elder in the Church, 
and one of the twelve apostles. 

Time will only permit me to refer very briefly to what has been 
done by our missionaries, but it seems important that we should know 
how diligent the elders of the Church have been from the beginning 
in introducing the gospel into the different states of the Union, and 
into many nations. 

First they preached in New York and Pennsylvania. In 1831, they 
went as far east as Vermont, where Joseph the prophet, Brigham Young 
and many others, who became prominent men in the Church, were 
born. Elder Jared Carter organized a branch of the Church at Benton, 
on the west side of the Green Mountains — the first branch in Vermont. 
The restored gospel was also preached in Illinois, Missouri, Kansas, 
Indiana and Michigan, in 1831 ; and even some of the elders entered 
Kentucky and Virginia the same year. 

The next year (1832) Orson Hyde and Samuel H. Smith filled 
an important mission to the Eastern, or New England, states, and during 
that year the gospel was first introduced in New Jersey, Massachusetts, 
Connecticut, Rhode Island, New Hampshire and Maine. In the last 
named state, Elder Wilford Woodruff later performed a splendid 
mission upon the Fox Islands. 

In 1834, the elders entered Tennessee. David W. Patten, Warren 
Parrish, Wilford Woodruff and Abraham O. Smoot were the first 
missionaries in that state. Wilford Woodruff and Henry Brown preached 
the gospel in Arkansas, in 1835. Into Maryland the gospel was in- 
troduced as early as 1837; and North Carolina was entered by Jedediah 
M. Grant (father of President Heber J. Grant), in 1838. The same 
year missionaries visited Iowa and later organized branches of the 
Church in that state, which afterwards 'became the home of many of 
the Latter-day .Saints after their expulsion from Missouri. 

The first Latter-day Saint missionaries entered South Carolina, 
in 1839. The first elder in that state was Lysander M. Davis. Mission- 
aries entered Wisconsin, in 1840, and that state has been a fruitful 
field of labor ever since. 

The first Latter-day Saint missionaries entered the states of 
Mississippi, Louisiana and Delaware in 1841, Florida about 1842, 
Georgia (where we now have the headquarters of the Southern States 
mission), Alabama and Texas, in 1843, and California, in 1846. The 
first Latter-day Saints in California were that company who, after sail- 



108 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



ing from New York in the ship Brooklyn, landed where San Francisco 
now stands, July 31, 1846. They found there only a small Spanish 
village, called Yerba Buena, which the Brooklyn people soon turned into 
a thrifty town called San Francisco, and made it not only an ordinary 
Anglo Saxon town, but with "Mormons" in the majority. 

In what is now South Dakota we find our people, in 1846. They 
entered at or near the point where the Vermillion river empties into 
the Missouri. An elder of the Church, by the name of James Emmett, 
tried to lead a company of Saints astray at the time the Church had 
lost its first leader and prophet, and the people did not know exactly 
whom to follow. James Emmett spent the winter of 1846 and 1847 
in what is now South Dakota with a number of people who followed 
him, and while he himself never became a faithful elder in the Church 
afterwards, most of his company returned to the fold. 

The Latter-day Saints were introduced into what is now Colorado, 
New Mexico and Arizona by the Mormon Battalion, in 1846 and the 
Saints were not only the first representatives of the Church in what is 
now the state of Colorado, but they were also the founders of the first 
Anglo-Saxon settlement in that part of our great country. The sick 
detachment of the Mormon Battalion, and a small company of Saints 
from the state of Mississippi, spent the winter of 1846-1847 at Pueblo, 
which up to that time, was a small Mexican and Indian village. 

In Nebraska, Winter Quarters (built by the Sanits in 1846) was the 
first Anglo-Saxon settlement of any importance. We were just as much 
the first Anglo-Saxon settlers of Nebraska as we were the first pioneers 
of Utah. 

Some of the exiled Saints from Nauvoo, Illinois, found them- 
selves, in 1846, traveling west and passing through what is now the 
state of Wyoming (it was not Wyoming until 1868), but the pioneers 
of 1847 were the first Latter-day Saints in that part of the country; 
they located Great Salt Lake City the same year. 

Members of the Mormon Battalion, after having served their 
country faithfully one year, returned eastward by way of Carson Valley, 
in Nevada, in 1847, and in 1851 our people made the first real settlement 
in Nevada, where Latter-day Saints have resided ever since. 

We entered Idaho in 1847. Samuel Brannan, who had led the 
Brooklyn company from New York to the Bay of San Francisco the 
previous year, being anxious to intercept Brigham Young and the 
pioneers, crossed the mountains to tell President Young what a beautiful 
country the San Juaquin Valley, in California, was. After meeting 
President Young on Green river, he became very much displeased 
when the president, as he entered the valley of the Great Salt Lake, 
said, "This is the place," and then stopped here, instead of going (ac- 
cording to Brother Brannan's advice) to locate in California, which in 
reality had many attractions at that time as compared to the Salt Lake 
country. In Idaho also we became the first settlers. Samual Brannan, 



ELDER ANDREW JEN SON 



109 



coming from California over the Sierra Nevada mountains by way of 
old Fort Hall passed through the southern part of what is now Idaho. 
Some time afterwards the Saints located the first Anglo-Saxon settle- 
ments in Idaho (Fort Limhi, in 1855, and Franklin, in 1860). 

The president of the Northwestern states mission, who is present 
with us today, may he interested in knowing that as early as 1850 
Charles C. Rich appointed Boyd Stewart to take a mission to Oregon, 
and that is the beginning of the missionary work which we have since 
carried on in that state and the great Northwest. We cannot tell 
exactly at the present time when the first elders entered what is now 
the state of Washington, from Oregon. We entered Indian Territory 
(now Oklahoma) in 1855, and we have carried on missionary work 
there ever since, both among Indians and whites. We entered Montana 
in 1869, Minnesota as early as 1875, and North Dakota about the same 
time. 

This covers all of the United States, and proves that the Latter-day 
Saints have preached the restored gospel in every state in the Union. 
In some states they have done more work than in otners, because of 
the tolerance or intolerance of the people. The Church has always 
had elders who were on hand to preach in all parts of the United 
States and elswhere. 

I shall now briefly refer to our foreign missions. As early as 
1832, the missionaries of the Church crossed the St. Lawrance river 
and lake Ontario into Canada and commenced to preach the gospel 
in that part of the British Dominions, and from that time until the 
present there have been Latter-day Saints in Canada and at times also 
flourishing branches of the Church. At the present time we have 
a well established mission in Canada. 

In June, 1837, the first Latter-day Saint missionaires crossed the 
Atlantic Ocean and opened the door for missionary work in Great 
Britain. I need not give details of that mission, for you know what 
Great Britain has been to the Church. Tens of thousands of Saints 
have gathered from England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland, to the 
gathering places in America, and the Church would look very much 
different to what it does today if it had not been for the acquisition 
that has come to it from the British Isles. 

Our missionaries entered British India in 1840, and in 1853, a 
regular mission was established there. Some of our brethren went 
there as sailors ; we have still members of the Church in India. 

In 1841, Orson Hyde arrived in Palestine as a missionary from 
America. He dedicated the land for the gathering of the Jews. In 
1843 Elder Noah Rogers, Addison Pratt, Benjamin F. Grouard and 
Knowlton F. Hanks started from Nauvoo, Illinois, for the Pacific 
Islands on a mission. Brother Hanks died at sea on his way to the 
Islands and was the first Latter-day Saint elder who found a watery 
grave. The other elders of that mission were successful in preaching 



110 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



the gospel on the Society Islands and neighboring groups, and about 
the time that Joseph Smith was mrytred in Carthage jail, Addison 
Pratt organized the first branch of the Church on the island of Tubuai 
— the first branch organized among a non-English speaking people. 
One of the missionaries who left Nauvoo in 1843 for the Pacific 
Islands, namely, Noah Rogers, stayed on the islands only a short time. 
Getting somewhat discouraged, he returned to America and was the 
first elder of the Church to circumnavigate the globe. He arrived in 
Nauvoo in time to become a victim of the persecutions then raging 
against the Saints, was exposed to the cold weather and the hardships 
on the plains of Iowa and took sick and died ; he was the first Saint 
buried at Mt. Pisgah, Iowa, where later about 250 Latter-day Saints 
found, so to speak, martyrs' graves. 

Erastus Snow, accompanied by John E. Forsgren, Peter O. Hansen 
and George P. Dykes, arrived in Copenhagen, Denmark, in 1850, as 
the first Latter-day Saint missionaries to that land. Elder Snow 
baptized the first converts August 12, 1850, and organized the first 
branch of the Church in Scandinavia (the Copenhagen branch) Sept. 
15, 1850. John E. Forsgren arrived in Sweden in June, 1850, and 
baptized his first convert in Gefle. July 26. 1850. From the beginning 
Denmark, Sweden, and Norway became known as the Scandinavian 
mission, which so far has been the most flourishing mission of the 
Church established among non-English speaking people. It is estimated 
that nearly one fifth of the present membership of the Church are of 
Scandinavian origin. 

In December, 1850, a number of Elders arrived in the Hawaiian 
Islands. We are pleased to have listened to the president of the 
Hawaiian mission today, telling us that this mission has grown until 
it now has 14,000 members. I have had the pleasure to write the 
history of the Hawaiian mission, as well as the history of all other 
foreign missions of the Church, and it is indeed interesting to note 
how our missionary work has progressed in many lands and climes. 

In Italy, Lorenzo Snow opened the gospel door in 1850. Tn 
Switzerland, Thomas B. Stenhouse first preached in 1851. Gudmund 
Gudmunson commenced to preach the gospel in Iceland and John 
Murdock in Australia, in 1851. In Norway the gospel was first in- 
troduced in 1851, by Elder Hans F. Peterson, who died many years 
ago in Ephraim, Sanpete county, Utah. To Chile, in South America, 
Parley P. Pratt and Rufus C. Allen went in 1851. They spent about 
seven months in Valparaiso and vicinity, but came away without bap- 
tizing anyone. It seems that they were unable to learn the Spanish 
language. One reason why so many young men are called on missions 
to the islands of the sea and other places, where foreign languages 
are spoken, is that people learn languages easily when young. For- 
iegners who come to America from some old countries when they 
are over twenty years of age usually find it a hard task to acquire 



ELDER ANDREW JEN SON 



111 



the English language so as to speak it without brogue. You can gener- 
ally detect that they are foreigners. We invariably acquire new 
languages when we are still in our teens better than later in life. 

In 1852, Lorenzo Snow and others visited Malta (the same island 
where the Apostle Paul preached the gospel centuries ago) and estab- 
lished a mission there. 

The first Latter-day Saint elders went to Siam in 1853 and also 
to Gibraltar, Germany and South Africa. Other elders, the same 
year, went to the West Indies. New Zealand became a missionary field 
for our elders in 1854, Holland in 1861, Austria in 1864, Finland in 
1875, Mexico from 1875 to 1879, the Samoan Islands in 1888, Belgium 
in 1889, the Friendly Islands (Tonga) in 1891, and Japan in 1901. 

I am hurrying to give you the merest outline. I have compiled 
many more details of these missions which perhaps may be used in 
Church publications later. 

In my endeavor to cover so much ground, I neglected to explain 
that while the Jews are being gathered to Palestine in their unbelief as 
to the mission of Jesus Christ, many of the Ten Tribes, who were 
taken to the Tigris country in the neighborhood of Nineveh, Assyria, 
and afterwards traveled northward (where they are now found in the 
lands of the north and upon the islands of the sea), become converts 
to true Christianity. Our elders have baptized many of them, and they 
gather as believers to the places which God has appointed for that 
purpose. Most of us here assembled are of Ephraim, or of the Ten 
Tribes; we are of Israel. This we are generally told in our patriarchal 
blessings and tradition bears out the same idea. There may be Gentile 
blood in our veins, but the blood of the House of Israel, we believe, 
predominates within us. Thus — while parts of the Ten Tribes gather 
as converts, the Jews gather to Palestine in their unbelief, and will 
not know the great Redeemer of the world until he shall place his foot 
upon the Mount of Olives and it shall be rent asunder; then, and not 
until then, will they recognize their Shiloh, or Messiah, in Jesus of 
Nazareth. 

May God continue to bless and prosper the missionary labors of 
our elders. May you who are younger than others of us who are fast 
growing old, continue to preach the gospel of Christ with unabated 
zeal until the heavenly message of salvation shall be preached to every 
nation, kindred, tongue and people, until Israel shall be gathered in 
fulfilment of prophesy, until Zion shall be fully established upon the 
earth and until Christ shall come and reign as King of kings and Lord 
of lords. May our children and grandchildren after us have occasion 
to rejoice exceedingly in, contemplating the integrity and faithfulness 
of their seniors, and, finally, may we all rejoice together in the celestial 
kingdom of our God and ever glorify him who has used us as humble in- 
struments in his hands to labor for the establishment of his Church 
and kingdom upon the earth. May God bless us, I humbly pray m the 
name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



A devotional anthem, words by Willard Done and music by Gerrit 
Dejong. was sung by the choir. 

ELDER DAVID A. SMITH 

Of the Presiding Bishopric 

It is now time for the dismissal of this meeting, but let me take 
just a minute to give one or two more thoughts for consideration. 

During the last half hour many have left this building, undoubtedly 
for the purpose of avoiding the crowd they would encounter when the 
meetings now being held are dismissed. Many of them have been stand- 
ing for the past two hours and perhaps feel justified in leaving. To my 
mind this should not be. We should enter a house of worship with a 
spirit of reverence. We should endeavor to keep order and should 
consider others above our own personal desires. In lea\ing a service 
before its conclusion we do not show this consideration, for we dis- 
turb the congregation and make it difficult for the speaker to follow 
his subject. It is hardly fair to remind you of this, for those who really 
need this reminder are on the outside, but I am sure we can all render 
a service to the Church by trying to encourage one another to avoid 
making such disturbances when attending a religious gathering. 

During this conference; a number of the mission presidents have 
called our attention to requirements for missionary work. President 
Young has just reminded us that there is a tendency on the part of 
parents to send missionaries more money than is actually needed for 
their missionary labors. The Savior's admonition to the Twelve was 
to go into the world, "And as ye go, preach, saying, The kingdom of 
heaven is at hand. 

"Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out devils ; 
freely ye have received, freely give. 

"Provide neither gold, nor silver, nor brass in your purses, 

Nor scrip for your journey, neither two coats, neither shoes, nor 
yet staves: for the workman is worthy of his meat," 

The records of the missions justify the statement that those en- 
gaged in this work of preaching the gospel, and who follow as nearly 
as possible this admonition, are doing the best work. This should be 
an evidence that the Lord is willing to assist his missionaries and will 
reward their faith and diligence. Let me suggest to those of you who 
have sons and daughters in the mission field that you communicate 
with the president of the mission and ask that he advise you as to the 
amount needed for those you are supporting. If you will then follow the 
advice given and endeavor to impress upon your son or daughter the 
importance of doing so, too, the burden now placed upon many who 
are struggling to maintain missionaries, who are laboring with com- 
panions who have more than they need, will be greatly reduced, and 



ELDER DAVID A. SMITH 



113 



a condition of equality will be more nearly brought about in the mission 
field. 

One more suggestion and I am through. The First Presidency 
have caused to be established a home where missionaries about to leave 
tor the mission field may receive a course of instruction before their 
departure, and where returning missionaries, who stay in Salt Lake 
City to report their labors, may find lodgings. Although this home has 
been in operation for only a month, we find that some of the out-going 
missionaries, especially the young men, find it difficult to adapt them- 
selves to the discipline and regulations, apparently not being accustomed 
to having their freedom curtailed. This, in my opinion, is a reflection 
upon their home training. 

The examinations given and the course of instruction pursued in- 
dicate that many are reporting for missionary work who have bodily 
defects which could and should be corrected before the missionary 
reports to Salt Lake City. 

We are also led to believe that the courses of study prepared es- 
pecially for the lesser priesthood are not being followed with a view 
to preparing young men for missionary service. It is not sufficient that 
they meet in class once a week to study an outline, but we should 
also provide daily, or weekly, labors for them to perform. Young 
men- and young women should not be called to the mission field until 
they have labored in the Church organizations, and have become familiar 
with the principles and ordinances of the gospel. I hope mothers and 
fathers will not leave this training wholly to the officers of the wards, 
but will cooperate with them and endeavor as far as possible to see that 
their children take advantage of every opportunity given to prepare 
themselves for the great missionary service. 

Now, may the Lord bless you and help you in your efforts to 
serve him, which we should do in the spirit of faith and humility. We 
cannot serve the Lord without serving our fellow men. May we always 
be united in our efforts to advocate his gospel and always have his holy 
Spirit to guide us, I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

"Praise God from whom all blessings flow," was sung by the 
choir and congregation. 

Benediction was pronounced by Elder Horace H. Cummings. 



THIRD DAY 



MORNING SESSION 

The conference continued in the great Tabernacle on Monday, 
April 6, 1925, at 10 o'clock a. m., President Heber J. Grant presiding. 

The choir and congregation sang, "Come, come, ye Saints." 

Elder Henry A. Gardner, president of the Palmyra stake, offered 
the opening prayer. 

A reading and song number, "The plan of salvation," from the 
oratorio by H. E. Giles, was rendered by Grace Emery, and Ray M. 
Haddock, with a double quartet. 

ELDER RICHARD R. LYMAN 

Ninety-five years ago today the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints was organized. One of the fundamental teachings of this 
organization is supported by the following scriptural passages : 

A FUNDAMENTAL TEACHING 

"Jesus answered them, and said, My doctrine is not mine, but his 
that sent me. 

"If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, 
whether it 'be of God, or whether I speak of myself." John 7:16, 17. 

In accordance with this teaching, you who have done his will, you 
who have kept his commandments, and therefore are entitled to and 
have the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, have recognized, I am sure, 
the voice of the Good Shepherd, in the remarks that have been made 
during this conference. That same spirit has testified to our souls 
that the words of the hymn just sung "An angel from on high, the 
long, long silence broke," are words of truth. This spirit has borne 
testimony to us not only that the words spoken are words of inspiration, 
but also that the work in which we are engaged is truly the work of the 
Master. , 

FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF THE Y. M. M. I. A. 

On the 10th day of June, 1875, under divine guidance, as we be- 
lieve, President Brigham Young gave instructions to Junius F. Wells 
to organize the first Young Men's Mutual Improvement Association. 
The great fundamentals which this pioneer leader said should character- 
ize the instructions given in these organizations is, faith in the gospel 
of Jesus Chrst as it has been revealed to the world through the Prophet 
Joseph Smith. 

The fundamental he emphasized is supported by the scripture above 
referred to : "If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doc- 
trine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself." He who 



ELDER RICHARD R. LYMAN 



115 



does not "know" should examine his own thoughts and conduct care- 
fully for the reason why he does not know, for the instruction is pos- 
itive that those who will do his will shall know. 

On the 10th day of June, 1925, it is proposed to celebrate the 
fiftieth anniversary of the establishment of this great voting men's 
organization. I cannot help but wonder if that seer, that revelator, that 
prophet Brigham Young even with his unusual vision could look into 
the future and see what these Young Men's Mutual Improvement or- 
ganizations have accomplished in this comparatively little time. 

AN EXPERIENCE 

Let me relate an experience which indicates the effectiveness of the 
work of the two Mutual organizations — Young Men's and Young 
Ladies'. At a conference one week ago yesterday — about this very 
hour — I asked all those present who were, or had been, officers in any 
of the Church organizations or in any of the Priesthood quorums to 
please stand. It seemed to me that all of those in that crowded meeting 
arose. So many stood that none could be seen seated except a few 
children in front. 

I asked again that all those leaders who have been trained in the 
Mutual Improvement Associations as officers or teachers, mem'bers of 
committees, or speakers on the program please stand. It appeared 
as if the same number arose the second time as the first. 

M. I. A. OBJECTIVES 

These great institutions appear to be operating effectively in every 
portion of the world where the Church is known. The purpose of the 
great pioneer leader in establishing these institutions is being ac- 
complished. Young men and young women are being made better. 
They are being taught the fundamental principles of the gospel, as these 
are laid down in the scriptures, they are being trained in public speaking 
and in bearing testimony, they are having instilled into their hearts 
that knowledge which comes from doing God's will, from living strictly 
in accordance with Christian teachings. They are demonsrtating that 
"if any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be 
of God, or whether I speak of myself." 

When, throughout the whole Church, I observe the intense activ- 
ity of great groups of our young people, when I see the phenomenal 
work they are doing in the mission field, when I observe the army of 
devoutly interested workers in the Sunday Schools and Mutuals, when 
I see the effectiveness of our work in debating, in public speaking, 
and in various other forms of recreation, I wonder if fifty years ago 
even the Prophet Brigham Young himself, with his inspired vision, 
could see how great, how influential and how effective the work of these 
institutions would be today. 

The excellence of the characters of the young people the Church 
is producing with the aid of the Mutuals and other Church agencies, 
prompts me to read one other passage of scripture : 



116 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



"Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter the kingdom 
of heaven; hut he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven. 

"Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied 
(in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name 
done many wonderful works? 

"And then will T profess, unto them, I never knew you: depart from 
me, ye that work iniquity. 

"Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, 
I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock: 

"And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, 
and beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was founded upon a rock." 
Matt. 7:21-25. 

A PEOPLE OF STERLING WORTH PRODUCED 

The more I study the doctrines of the Church and Church organ- 
ization, the more 'beauty and perfection I find. It is nearly a hundred 
years since, under the direction of the Prophet Joseph Smith, the 
Church was originally established. It is now practically fifty years 
since the Young Men's Mutual Improvement Associations were or- 
ganized and their work was begun, under the inspired leadership of the 
great pioneer prophet. A careful study of the results of these two 
great movements shows that a hardy people of sterling worth has been 
produced, I have analyzed these institutions and judging them by their 
fruits, I have concluded that I may fail, or you may fail, or others may 
not be able to live in accordance with the doctrines, teachings and com- 
mandments of the Church, yet the best judgment I have tells me that 
the Church and its organization and its effective work will go on in- 
definitely. As far as the welfare and progress of these organizations 
are concerned, we need have no fear, for the faith of the people to 
whom these institutions are entrusted is founded on a rock. 

When June 10th comes, and you see our great Jubilee commemorat- 
ing and celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of the organization of the 
Young Men's Mutuals, your hearts, like those of all other Latter-day 
Saints, will be thrilled with justifiable pride. The Young Ladies' 
organization is joining in this celebration. In it they will play an 
important part. You will see thousands of our members, young men 
and young women, marching through the streets of this city. The 
various divisions will be carrying great banners, indicating the strength 
and power of the young people who are workers in these two institu- 
tions of the Church. When you see them in the pink and vigor of 
manhood and womanhood, your souls will be stirred with the feeling 
that they cannot fail, for their faith is founded on a rock. 

THRIFT AND FINANCIAL SUCCESS 

The generation of young men and young women that the Church 
is producing is expected to be well nigh perfect. Among their own 
commendable characteristics they must have the spirit of, and they must 
practice, thrift. I was greatly interested in what Senator Smoot said 
upon that subject Sunday. I believe in thrift. We cannot have a 
great generation of strong characters unless they practice thrift. We

are to be a people of power, we are to be empire-builders. We can 
only secure the means necessary to attain these ends if we live within 
our incomes and in accordance with the principles of economy and 
thrift. 

Many years ago, when I was a young man and an officer in the 
Mutual Improvement organization of the Utah stake, when that stake 
covered all of Utah county, I asked a wise man who had been a finan- 
cial success what I should teach the young men with whom I came in 
contact as a Mutual Improvement officer, and as a teacher in the B. Y. 
Academy, at Provo, what lessons I should teach these young people in 
order to make them successful financially. 

"This is an easy matter," said the wise old pioneer. "All young 
people need to be taught is to spend less than they make." 

Are you spending less than you make? Are you teaching those 
with whom you are associated to live also in accordance with this 
splendid teaching? 

If the faith and integrity and real worth of the people are to be 
founded on a rock, they must practice economy and thrift. • 

It is said that automobiles may be responsible for many financial 
failures, that: "The sheriff has put many a man on his feet financially 
by taking away his automobile." 

AUTOMOBILES AND SUCCESS 

If the faith, the integrity and the real worth of the people are 
founded on a rock, they will not buy automobiles or other luxuries they 
cannot afford. 

I was told recently by a dealer in automobiles that when they sent 
a messenger to the home of a man who was purchasing a machine on 
the installment plan — the monthly payment plan — he found a home 
bearing evidence of poverty. In it were a woman and a family of 
children without the real necessities of life. The purchaser of the 
automobile was behind in his payments some two or three months. When 
asked concerning their financial condition the lady explained that they 
were not able to keep up their payments on the automobile, that all they 
had had to live on for the last three months was what they had secured 
from the Church. It is such as these who need to learn the lessons of 
thrift and economy. 

I appeal to you and to your children and to your children's children, 
and to your neighbors, and to your friends, and to all the people, not 
to purchase automobiles until they have the money with which to pay 
for them. Heaven bless you with sufficient wisdom to be able to see 
that the making of monthly payments on automobiles is tremendously 
expensive. 

If we have integrity founded on a rock, we shall prize our good 
names more than money, and our word will be as binding as our bond. 

QUALITIES REQUIRED OF LATTER-DAY SAINTS 

If there are people in the Church who are willing to assume obli- 
gations they cannot meet, then we are in need of more teachers like 



118 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Doctor Karl G. Maeser. We need to have impressed upon the minds 
of the people that life itself is no more precious than honor. We must 
have a people with vision, a people with judgment, a people who will 
meet their obligations and will assume no obligations they cannot meet. 

When students came to the B. Y. Academy at Provo that great 
teacher, Karl G. Maeser, had them give their word of honor that they 
would live in accordance with the teachings of the Church and obey 
the rules of the school. 

He explained that many students came to him and asked what he 
meant by "word of honor." That great teacher with high ideals ex- 
plained that if he were placed behind prison walls ever so high and ever 
so thick, extending to any depth in the ground, there would always 
be a possibility that at some time, in some way he would be able to 
escape. "But," said this splendid saint, "place me in the middle of 
that floor, draw a chalk line around me, have me give my word of 
honor never to cross that line. Can I ever escape? No, never! I die 
first." That is the sterling worth that is founded on a rock. It is 
qualities like this the people must have if the purposes of the Divine 
Master are to be accomplished. 

Faith and testimony, honor, integrity and mercy, these are qualities 
required of Latter-day Saints according to the gospel which, through the 
Prophet Joseph Smith, has been restored in these last days. The Mu- 
tuals and other auxiliary organizations have been established also under 
divine inspiration as helps in government. The fundamental aim of 
these institutions is to teach the members of the Church to "do his 
will." For if they "do his will," they shall know of the doctrine. 

KNOWLEDGE MUST BE FOLLOWED BY WORKS AND HONOR 

Nor is knowledge concerning the doctrines of the Church enough. 
We are to 'be judged not by our faith but by our works. Character is 
essential. Frugality is important. Economy must be practiced. Honor 
of the quality described by Dr. Karl G. Maeser must be a character- 
istic of the people. God himself has not power enough to accomplish 
his purposes with a people who are without honor. We believe in 
being honest, true, chaste, benevolent, and virtuous. The Mutuals 
and other organizations throughout the Church are doing their utmost 
to bring up a people who live in accordance with all these virtues. Our 
progress may appear to be slow, but actually it is rapid. The work 
is the work; of Divine Providence. We need fear only for our in- 
dividual selves. The cause being divine, will triumph finally. For the 
whole people we need have no fear, for their faith, their worksj and 
their integrity are founded on a rock. God bless you. Amen. 

ELDER J. GOLDEN KIMBALL 

Of the First Council of Seventy 

There has never been a time in my life, or any period of my life, 
when I felt better spiritually and more willing to do my duty and serve 



ELDER J. GOLDEN KIMBALL 



119 



the Lord and labor for his cause and for his interests. I pray God that 
the time shall never come in my life when I fear the face of man. The 
Lord at one time, in the early history of the Church, in a revelation, re- 
proved the elders because they would not open their mouths and' use 
the talents which the Lord had given unto them, and I am praying, as 
some old prophet prayed, "that the words of my mouth and the medita- 
tion of my thoughts be acceptable in thy sight, O Jehovah, my Rock and 
my Redeemer." 

I appreciate the fact that we are not all alike. I have not' been 
reared in the same pasture as some men have in this day and genera- 
tion. Neither do I speak the same language, but I try to make myself 
understood. 

I have been away for a short time in California. I have not as- 
sociated with the Gentiles, they did not seem to recognize me. I cannot 
remember now of any of them speaking to me, but I have learned a 
number of lessons. During /my loneliness I have sought after God. 
I love God ; I love him for his kindness, mercy, patience, and for his 
forgiveness. I sustain this work as best I know how, and I love 
the brethren, because they are kind to me, because they have patience, 
and because they are forbearing. 

I often ask the question, "Why do I live?" That puts me in mind 
of a story by Eugene Field, that master of tender verse. He tells the 
story of a young man, an ambitious poet, who sent him a poem, "Why 
do I live?" And he immediately answered, "Because you sent your 
poem by mail." 

During the time of my poor health my family were very much 
concerned. They wanted me to go through a physical examination. 
Nothing in the world frightens me like a scientific examination. I 
went to the clinic of the Stanford University, to a young physician 
of some considerable renown. I passed through an examination — the 
X-ray, and all that stuff. This young doctor did not believe in God, 
man, or the devil. I found that out. I told him I was a "Mormon." 
He said, "You will never get any better." I said, "O, yes, I will. I 
have a greater physician than you are." He said, "Who is he?" And 
I said, "The Lord Jesus Christ." He said, "There's nothing in it." 
He was drowned last year, and I am still alive. 

Whenever I am called to speak in the tabernacle, I always put up 
the danger signal, "Safety first," because I am always in danger. 

Now, brethren and sisters, in all solemnity, I want to read to you a 
little. I am sure I will be safe if I stick to the text. I was. acquainted 
with the Prophet Joseph Smith, only through the testimony of my 
father. No man in this Church has greater faith, greater respect, and 
did greater honor to the Prophet of God than Heber C. Kimball. His 
knees never trembled, his hand never shook, he never failed to sustain 
the Prophet of God. I have known every prophet of God, who has 
been the president of this Church since the Prophet Joseph Smith. I 
have personally talked to them ; I honored them ; they were always kind 
to me. I have often spoken of President Woodruff. Occasionally, 



when I was presiding in the South and returned home with an emigra- 
tion, he said, "Brother Kimball, sit down by me. Now, Brother Kim- 
ball, I have had visions; I have had revelations; I have seen angels, 
but the greatest of all is that still, small voice." I have heard that 
voice, I am a witness, and I know that God lives. 

I desire to read to you something, not new, not startling — the idea 
that we are the chosen people of God : Joseph Smith, the Prophet of 
the living God organized the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints, and the members became the chosen people of God to perform a 
great and lasting service for mankind. To preach the gospel of Jesus 
Christ ; they were entrusted with a mission which carries with it suffer- 
ing, sacrifice, sorrow, hatred and persecution, but the message brings to 
the human family, if they will have faith in God, repent of their sins, and 
be baptized by immersion and have hands laid upon them by the author- 
ized servants of God for the reception of the Holy Ghost — there will 
come to them joy, happiness, virtue, goodness and godliness. To accept 
this mission is to fill a high place in the world's history. To be a 
chosen people we have gone forth through trials, tribulations, suffer- 
ing, sorrow, hate and agony, sacrifice and humiliation, and have humbly 
and faithfully performed the heavy, responsible tasks laid upon us by 
Jesus Christ for the good of his Father's children. Surely we ought to 
be blessed, rewarded and entitled to recognition. A chosen people 
should not indulge in the thought that God's whole attention is ab- 
sorbed in watching over and caring for a favored few. Let the righteous 
of all, nations rejoice in God's grace and exult in his justice, which 
means that the righteous of all other nations have a share in the teach- 
ings of the kingdom of God and his righteousness. 

Brethren and sisters, I know we have had a great deal of praise. 
I have been deeply interested in what has been said — that we are the 
best people on earth. But a short time ago, a brother of mine, whom 
you know, a humble man at the wicker gate of the temple block, went 
down to Los Angeles to look around and see what the prospects were, 
as he was given a vacation. He is a gardener and a great lovelr of 
flowers, and he has helped beautify a great many places here in the city. 
He was working for a great florist down there in Los Angeles, and 
they sent him to a multi-millionaire's home, and he worked there six 
weeks. This wealthy man came out and talked to him. Kimball had no 
fear and told him he was a "Mormon." The man looked at him and 
said : "Well, I am awfully glad to have a 'Mormon' work on my 
place." Kimball told him he was a son of Heber C. Kimball. The 
man said, "Do you know that those old men, (that is the way he phrased 
it) Brigham Young, and Heber C. Kimball and those pioneers were the 
greatest people on earth, and we love to have"— he was speaking gen- 
erally of the "Mormon" and Gentile — "these Utah people come down 
here, because they are honest, because we can trust them." And he 
said, "I do not know but what the Gentiles associating with the 'Mor- 
mons' has helped the former to be honest. That is the testimony of a 



ELDER J. GOLDEN KIMBALL 



121 



multi-millionaire. I saw mighty few "Mormons" down there— if there 
were very many they did not make themselves known. 

I know I have spent a good deal of time, brethren in trying to 
live. About Christmas, 1923, I thought I was dying. I had a hem- 
orrhage of the lungs, and I bled quantities of blood. I thought I had 
hardly a pint left in me. I sent for my wife and handed her the keys 
to my safety box and said : "Here is the key to my safety box ; there 
is nothing in it. God bless you." I then sent for a great specialist 
to examine me and see what was the matter. He examined me and 
said, "How old are you ?" I said, "I am seventy years old." "Well," 
he said, "I thought you were forty-seven." I replied, "If that is the 
way you look at it, I am going td get out of here," and I did. I lay in 
bed for two weeks, and I thought of a testimony, and I could not get 
it worded right ; I could not link it together. I knew how I felt, so one 
day I got the Sunday edition of the San Francisco Examiner, a wonder- 
ful paper, and there I iound my testimony, worded as I would have 
liked to word it, as I did not know what was going to happen to me, 
but if I die tomorrow, which I do not intend to do, this is my testimony: 

"For he was the Son of God." 

The divinity of God was in Christ, in his life and his death, and the power 
that he has wielded among- men for their good, since his death, all prove it. 

He was God's Son, and he recognized all men as his brothers. 

"The common people heard him gladly." He was their friend, their brother, 
he walked with them, talked, lived and worked^ with them, aU the few short 
years of his life. And in the end he died for them. 

He suffered physically and mentally as they suffered, his Gethsemane was 
torture of the spirit, and his Golgotha was dreadful torture of the body. 

No miracle was done to save that noble spirit from the horror of physical 
pain. He not only lived and died but suffered fearful agony for the millions of 
his brothers then living, and untold millions of those brothers that were to come. 

He knew the agony that was preparing for him. 

"Father, all things are possible unto thee; take away this cup from me, 
nevertheless, not what I will, but what thou wilt." 

That was the Son of God, humbly pleading with his Father. 
"Even so, Father, for so it seemed good in thy sight." 
That was the Son of God, reconciled to his Father's will. 

******* 

Who dares deny that Christ is the Son of God, he to whom all men and all 
women were as brothers and sisters, who, himself sinless, forgave the sinful 
woman that sinful men would have stoned to death? 

He who spoke first for the children, for the poor, for the sick, whose acts 
of miraculous power were all for the hungry, the dying or the dead. He was the 
the Son of God. 

******* 

One "scientific historian" will tell you that in all the world's authentic 
histories there are but few words actually written concerning Christ — in real 
history. That may be true. But for nearly t\yo thousand years his name has 
made history. It has been written on every page, in the laws, in the lives, the 
hearts and histories of (men. 

Ten thousand steeples pointing to the sky, hundreds of millions whose daily 
prayers end, "For Christ's sake. Amen," prove his mission. 

Millions of the poor and unfortunate, all over the earth, who turn their eyes 



122 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



to heaven, trusting and finding comfort in his goodness and in his promises — 
all these are more important than any books of ancient history, any testimony of 
changing men. 

******* 

Christ was the Son of God, he was his own witness, and his works are the 
proof of his divinity. His spirit covers the earth and gradually redeems it from 
barbarism, as the sunlight covers the earth and gradually dissipates the night, 
when the morning sun rises. 

The learned historian assures you that, admitting the historical existence 
of Christ, it is certain that he was a poor youth among poor people, never in his 
life able to read or write, 

Let that pass, let the "higher criticism" jmake the most of it He could 
read the mind of God and interpret it to wicked men. He could read the hearts 
of children, of poor women, and share their sufferings, and die to help them. 

He was (indeed the Son of God. 

What was his work on this earth? It was a work of redemption, of light- 
giving, of comfort, justice, mercy, and above all, forgiveness. 

Dying in agony, his poor body hung upon the cross, nails in his feet and 
hands, and thorns piercing his head, he turned his eyes to heaven and, said, 
"Father, forgive them ; for they know not what they do." 

Were not these the words of God's true Son? 

Nineteen hundred and twenty-three years ago he came into this world, 
bursting and tearing asunder the ancient high wall of hatred, cruelty, slavery, 
misery. 

His glory came to the world like the sun shining through the clouds upon 
a troubled sea at the end, of a great storm. 

His name is the hope of 'millions. His teachings, of which we are all so 
unworthy, possess the power that will one day raise us above our present low 
condition of selfishness, meanness, hatred and war. 

"Go and sell that thou hast and give to the poor and thou shalt have treasure 
in heaven; and come and follow ./me." 

Those were the words of God's Son, words unheeded yet among men who 
still take from the poor to increase their own store. 

But the words were spoken, the power behind them can never die, can never 
be supplanted. 

"Woman, where are those thine accusers? Hath no man condemned thee?" 
"No man, Lord." 

"Neither do I condemn thee ; go and sin no more." 
Those words were spoken by the Son of God. 

"Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not; for of such 
is the kingdom of heaven." 

"Take heed that ye hurt not one of these little ones, for I say unto you that 
in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my Father which is in 
heaven." 

That was said by the Son of God. 

******* 

Where do we find words of comfort for the poor, the unfortunate, the 
humble among God's children? 

"Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. 

"Blessed are they that mourn : for they shall be comforted. 

"Blessed are the meek : for they shall inherit the earth. 

"Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they 
shall be filled. 

"Blessed are the merciful : for they shall obtain mercy. 

"Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God. 



ELDER J. GOLDEN KIMBALL 



123 



"Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake: for theirs 
is the kingdom of heaven. 

"Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say 
all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake." 

Christ was the Son of God and his teachings will rule this world. "Rejoice 
and be exceeding glad" on this return of the season of promise, this opening of 
another year." 

God bless you, my brethren and sisters, God blesa his Church for- 
ever, and his servants, and may God inspire them to be prophets, seers 
and revelators unto the children of men, I pray in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 

A baritone solo, "Come unto me," was sung by J. H. Wood. 

ELDER TAYLOR NELSON 

President of the Oneida Stake of Zion 

My brethren and sisters, I assure you that I feel very keenly the 
responsibility of this moment, yet I am happy to know that I am 
counted worthy of membership in this great Church, and that through 
the mercy and blessing of my heavenly Father I enjoy the testimony 
of the divinity of his work. 

I was impressed yesterday with the singing of that remarkable 
hymn by Parley P. Pratt: 

"Lo, in Cumorah's lonely hill 
A sacred record lies concealed." 

As the choir rendered the final hymn the spirit of it bore testimony 
to me again, as it has done on many occasions, and I now appreciate 
the divinitv of that great work which was translated by the gift and 
power of God through the Prophet Joseph Smith, from the ancient 
records delivered to him by the angel, Moroni. 

I have never seen Moroni, but I know that such a man lived. I 
have never seen the records from which the Book of Mormon was 
translated, but I know that such records were in existence. I know 
today that the Book of Mormon is divine. I have put to test the 
promise made by the writer of one of the closing chapters of that great 
record, wherein he said, 

"And when ye shall receive these things, I would exhort you that ye would 
ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not true; 
and if ye shall ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in 
Christ, lie will manifest the truth of it uno you, by the power of the Holy 
Ghost." 

I have put this to the test, and I know, through the whispering of 
the still small voice, that the Book of Mormon is divine. I know also, 
which would follow naturally, that he who was instrumental in the hands 
of our heavenly Father in translating that record was a prophet of God. 



124 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



This is my testimony to you here today, that I know this record is 
divine, and I know this work, is our Father's work, established upon 
the earth in these latter times for the salvation and exaltation of his 
children. This is my testimony, which I bear in the name of Jesus 
Christ, Amen. 

\ 

ELDER JOHN W. HART 

President of the Rigby Stake of Zion 

I desire an interest in your faith and prayers this morning, that I 
may be supported by the Spirit of the Lord in the few moments that 
I stand before you at this time. 

I have enjoyed this conference, as I always do enjoy them, and 
have rejoiced in the opportunity that I have of attending them and 
associating with you, my brethren and sisters, and those whom the 
Lord has chosen to direct the affairs of his Church in the earth today. 
I rejoice that we have men who are not afraid to speak the truth. No 
honest man sitting in the audience and looking into the faces of the 
General Authorities of the Church can help but say, that they are sin- 
cere and honest. 

I was forcibly struck this morning at a meeting of the Board of 
Education by a remark made by Elder David O. McKay, wherein he 
drew a little comparison to drive home his point. He said, "Latter-day 
Saints should not be ashamed of the gospel, nor should they hesitate 
to stand up and defend it at every opportunity." 

Last June it was my privilege to go to the city of Cleveland, I 
attended 'a convention there. My son, who was presiding over the 
Northern Indiana conference, came down and visited a few days with 
me. The business men were very kind to us. They went out of their way 
to do everything to make our visit pleasant while we were in that city. 
They would send their automobiles around to our hotel and place them 
at our disposal, in order that we might enjoy our visit with them. I 
told some of them that I did not want them to do that, that I was busy. 
I thanked them, however. But I said I would like to go out to the 
Kirtland temple, if it was agreeable to them. "Certainly," they said, 
and at the appointed hour they came, not only the chauffeur of the car 
but three of the business men of Cleveland, and they in company w'ith 
[the Governor of our own state and one or two others journeyed to 
Kirtland, and we were escorted through the temple by an elderly 
gentleman there, who said he was a patriarch in the church. Of course, 
the main thing that was talked about by him was in the nature of a 
criticism of the "Brighamites" and the Latter-day Saints in general. 
We listened to him, we were his guests, and when we left the building 
I turned to him and said : "My friend, I want you to know that I pre- 
side in one of the stakes of Zion. Now," I said " I have listened to 
you. Why didn't you tell us what happened in this building? Why didn't 



ELDER JOHN H. HART 



125 



you tell us that the Savior appeared here to Joseph Smith and Oliver 
Oowdery, and that Elijah appeared and conferred the keys of the 
turning of the hearts of the fathers to the children, etc.; and that 
Moses appeared and conferred the keys of the gathering; and Elias 
appeared also? Why didn't you tell something about that?" "O, well," 
he said, "we only do that when people ask us." I said "Well, I am 
going to tell these gentlemen." 

We left the building and went to the car. "Now, my friends," I 
said, "I do not want you to get our Church and this church confused. 
There is a vast difference between us," and I proceeded to tell them 
what happened in that temple, and why it was of so much importance 
to us in the history of the Latter-day Saints. And before I got through 
one of the gentlemen from Cleveland said, "Why, Mr. Hart, you know 
more about it than this man does." "I most certainly do, because he 
doesn't know anything about it." 

We journeyed to the city and about nine o'clock my son and I 
retired to our room, and were going to retire for the night. I had taken 
my coat and collar off, when a knock came at the door. I answered 
it, and there were the three gentlemen who went with us to Kirtland. 
They came to my room. They wanted jto excuse themselves and 
tried to leave, but I insisted that they stay, and assured them the only 
reason that I was going to retire was that I didn't have any other place 
to go that night. They came in, and, of course, I knew what they 
wanted. I had given them a pretty |good talk at noon that day, and 
they came there and inquired most earnestly regarding other things 
pertaining to our Church, and I had the privilege of relating to them 
some of the fundamental principles of the Church to which we belong. 
I entertained them there until 12:30, and during our talk I explained 
to them briefly the coming forth of the Book of Mormon, the organiza- 
tion of the Church, etc., and during' my talk along that line, at intervals 
one of the gentlemen raised his hand above his head and said, "Mr. 
Hart, that is the most wonderful story I ever heard." I said, "It is, 
it is one of the (greatest miracles of modern times." I said, "If we 
should strip the divine claim from that book, we coula not publish it 
half fast enough for the world to read it." "But," I said, "it is 
divine, it has stood the test of a hundred years, and we want the people 
to read it, we are not hiding it from them." 

When the time to separate came, I gave them a Book of Mormon, 
with a distinct understanding and a promise from them that they would 
read it. Since returning home I have had several letters from them 
to the effect that the first one had read the book and passed it on to 
the next one, and that they were enjoying it. 

Now, I simply state this, my brethren and sisters, to further 
testify to the fact that was stated this morning by Elder McKay, that 
we should not try to hide our light beneath a bushel, because the world 
is hungering and thirsting after the gospel of Christ, and I thank God 



126 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



that we have leaders here who are able, and not afraid, to present it to 
them upon every opportunity. It did my heart good when I heard 
President Grant state in his opening address where he had been, how he 
had traveled in the world, and visited, and embraced every opportunity 
that was presented to him to preach the gospel to the children of men 
wherever he went, and I know that he rejoiced in it, and that the Lord 
will bless him and every other man who will take this opportunity. 

Now, my brethren and sisters, I do not fear for these men. God 
will take care of them, but I am fearful for myself, and I hope and 
pray, and do pray continually, that the Lord will keep me in the path 
of rectitude, that I may be able to endure to the end. And may we 
all do this, is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

ELDER LARS OVESON 

President of the Emery Stake of Zion 

I have rejoiced exceedingly, my brethren and sisters, during 
this great conference, and I feel it a privilege to have the opportunity 
to come here upon this great occasion to listen to the inspired instruc- 
tions that are given from the- servants of the Lord. 

When we contemplate the wonderful things that have been accom- 
plished in the short period of time since the organization of the Church, 
ninety-five years ago, we cannot help but realize, it seems to me, that 
some divine power has operated and guided the Church from its earliest 
organization until the present time. 

In listening to the reports of the advancement and progress that 
have been made, as in the report that was made by President Grant at 
the opening session of this conference, and the reports that were made 
last evening in the Sunday School conference, and the reports that 
have been made of the Mutual Improvement organization, and in short 
in every organization of the Church, it has seemed a wonder. It is 
a wonder to the world, and they cannot understand how it is that a 
people who have met opposition all the way along the line have been able 
to advance and progress as they have done. To us, my brethren and 
sisters, it is clear, because we are engaged in the work of the Lord, 
and the Lord has guided and directed the movements of this Church 
and has inspired its leaders from the earliest organization to the present 
time. So we are not depending upon the wisdom of men; we are not 
depending upon the strength of men, but we realize and know that we 
are in the service of the Lord, and that we are working to accomplish 
the great purposes that he has established in this day and age of the 
world. 

I have been associated with the Church all my life, so to speak. 
I came to this country in my early boyhood. Though I was born in 
a foreign land, I have been associated with the people in these valleys 
of the mountains for more than sixty years, and I have had a little

experience and observed a few things that have transpired during 
that length of time, and I want to say, my brethren and sisters, that 
every word that has been spoken in this conference has found an echo 
in my soul, which makes me think that I am somewhere near right. 

I rejoice in the testimony of the truthfulness of what is called 
"Mormonism." I know that it is the work of the Lord; I know that 
it is the gospel of Jesus Christ, and that if we will live up to our 
privileges; if we will live up to our duties, brethren and sisters, there 
is no power can stay our progress, our advancement and our exalta- 
ton finally in the kingdom of our God. I rejoice to be here to par- 
take of the spirit which comes to us through these wonderful gatherings. 
I rejoice to bear my testimony to the truthfulness of this work of the 
Lord to the world, for I know it is true; I know it is for the uplift and 
the advancement of the children of God, and I pray that the Lord will 
help every one of us that we may remain faithful and true, that we 
may be found valiant workers in the cause of righteousness and help to 
build up his kingdom upon the earth, which I pray in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 

ELDER JAMES W. LESUEUR 

President of the Maricopa Stake of Zion 

"If I were a voice, a persuasive voice, 
That could travel the whole world through, 

I'd fly on the beams of the morning light, . 

And speak to men with a gentle might, 

And tell them to be true. 

"I'd fly, I!d fly, o'er land and sea, 
Wherever a human heart might be, 
Telling a tale, or singing a song, 
In praise of the right, in blame of the wrong." 

My brethren and sisters, I feel that such is the spirit of the Latter- 
day Saints. Our mission here upon this earth is to preach righteousness. 

Coming as I do from the Maricopa stake of Zion, we may have 
conditions there that are different from some of other stakes. We have 
a ward there made up of Indians, or Lamanites, and I want to say 
something in regard to that people. We find that they are the most 
faithful Saints that we have. For the last ten or twelve years they have 
been setting an example to us in many things. A report that we had 
some time ago from that ward shows that one hundred per cent of the 
members observe the Word of Wisdom and that for the last ten or 
twelve years they have done one hundred per cent ward teaching ; that 
they set an example in attendance at sacramental meetings, some coming 
a great distance, walking several miles to attend their meetings. 

A little over a year ago we held a conference with them. These 
good people are not hypocritical. When we asked them to sustain 
the bishopric, four of the Lamanite women voted against the bishopric. 
But when we asked them why, after the meeting, they said they would 



128 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



like to meet with the stake presidency and tell them why. So we made 
an appointment with them. They came and they said, it is because the 
bishopric did not see that the ward teachers did their full duty. The 
ward teachers went to their homes, and as they saw them out in their 
fields, they would say, "How are you today?" and if we said we were 
all right, they would say, "Well, we must be going on, so we can make 
one hundred per cent." 

Then we asked them what they should do? 

"Why," they said, "they should ask us to come into the house, 
they should sing with us, and pray with us, and then a subject should 
be assigned to them, and they should treat that subject and tell us 
something about the gospel, and about Jesus." 

We asked them if they would not give the bishopric another chance 
to make good? 

"Why," they said, "an Indian does not forget, and it is hard for 
an Indian to forgive." 

I showed them the necessity of forgiving the bishopric and giving 
them another chance. They finally said they would, aind so the 
bishopric, who were there and heard what they had to say, promised 
this people that they would do good work among them, and that the 
ward teachers would do their full duty. Later on, these sisters came 
and reported to us that the bishopric was doing an excellent work. The 
result of that is that the people have been visited in the Indian ward 
every month faithfully, not only by the teachers but by the bishopric. 
Last year we had thirteen converts made in that ward. We feel that 
it has resulted from the excellent work done by these good sisters 
who made their report. 

We are very much favored in the Maricopa stake of Zion in 
having the privilege of having a temple built in our midst. The work 
is progressing nicely. We are going to have a wonderful temple there 
in that pleasant climate, an excellent place for many of the people in 
this northern country to go in the winter time and do their temple 
work. This is going to be a very beautiful building, it will probably 
be a year before it is entirely completed, but it will be something that 
the entire Church can be proud of. A great deal of good is being 
done there at the present time. People are coming from all parts of 
the world to visit that temple, as it is near the main highway from 
ocean to ocean, and we have a great many visitors. A great many 
tourists come to that land in the winter time, and they all desire to 
visit the temple and see the wonderful work done there. It is a great 
credit to our Church. 

My brethren and sisters, this is a wonderful work and the Lord 
is at the helm, and he is blessing us greatly. We ought to be the 
best people in all the world. I want to bear testimony to you that I 
know that the gospel is true, and that this is the Lord's work, and I 
pray God to bless each and every one of us, that we may be faithful 
and true to it, which I ask in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD 

I desire to read a few words from the 133d section of the Doc- 
trine and Covenants, the same being a revelation given to the 
Prophet Joseph Smith in the month of November, 1831 : 

PREACHING THE GOSPEL AND THE GATHERING 

"Hearken, O ye people of my church, saith the Lord your God, and hear 
the word of the Lord concerning you — 



130 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



"The Lord who shall suddenly come to his temple ; the Lord who shall 
cqme down upon the world with a curse to judgement; yea, upon all the nations 
that forget God, and upon all the ungodly among you. 

"For he shall make bare his holy arm in the eyes of all the nations, and all 
the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of their God. 

"Wherefore, prepare ye, prepare ye, O my people; sanctify yourselves; 
gather ye together, O ye people of my church, upon the land of Zion, all you 
that have not been commanded to tarry. 

"Go ye out from Babylon. Be ye clean that bear the vessels of the Lord. 

"Call your solemn assemblies, and speak often one to another, and let every 
man call upon the name of the Lord. 

"Yea, verily I say unto you again, the time has come when the voice of 
the Lord is unto you : Go ye out of Babylon ; gather ye out from among the 
nations, frcjtn the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other. 

"Send forth the elders of my church unto the nations which are afar off ; 
unto the islands of the sea ; send forth unto foreign lands ; call upon all nations ; 
first upon the Gentiles, and then upon the Jews. 

"And behold, and lo, this shall be their cry, and the voice of the Lord unto 
all people: "Go ye forth unto the land of Zion, that the borders of my people 
may be enlarged,, and that her stakes may be strengthened, and that Zion may go 
forth unto the regions round about. 

"Yea, let the cry go forth among all people : Awake and arise and go forth 
to meet the Bridegroom ; behold and lo, the Bridegroom cometh ; go ye out to 
meet him. Prepare yourselves for the great day of the Lord. 

"Watch, therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour. 

"Let them, therefore, who are among the Gentiles flee unto Zion. 

"And let them who be of Judah flee unto Jerusalem, unto the mountains 
of the Lord's house. 

"Go ye out from among the nations, even from Babylon, from the midst of 
wickedness, which is spiritual Babylon. 

"But verily, thus saith the Lord, let not your flight be in haste, but let 
all things be prepared before you; and he that goeth, let him not look back lest 
sudden destruction shall come upon him. 

"Hearken and hear, O ye inhabitants of the earth. Listen, ye elders of my 
church together, and hear the voice of the Lord ; for he calleth upon all men, 
and he commandeth all men everywhere to repent. 

"For behold, the Lord God hath sent forth the angel crying through the 
midst of heaven, saying : Prepare ye the way of the Lord, and make his paths 
straight, for the hour of his coming is nigh — " 

The balance of the revelation continues in a declaration of the 
Lord as to his purposes concerning the gathering of the Jews to 
Jerusalem, and the mighty power which he shall manifest in their 
delivery; also concerning the restoration of the lost tribes of Israel, 
and their return. Continuing I shall read from the same section, 
beginning with verse 36 : 

"And now, verily saith the Lord,, that these things might be known among 
you, O inhabitants of the earth, I have sent forth mine angel flying through 
the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel, who hath appeared unto 
some and hath committed it unto man, who shall appear unto many that dwell 
on the earth. 

"And this gospel shall be preached unto every nation and kindred, and 
tongue, and people. 

"And the servants of God shall go forth, saying with a loud voice: Fear 
God and give glory to him, for the hour of his judgment is come;" 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD 



131 



In the same connection I desire to read a few verses from the 
88th section of the Doctrine and Covenants, commencing with the 
88th verse : 

^And after your testimony cometh wrath and indignation upon the people. 

"For after your testimony cometh the testimony of earthquakes, that shall 
cause groanings in the midst of her, and men shall fall upon the ground and 
shall not be able to stand. 

"And also cometh the testimony of the voice of thunderings, and the voice 
of lightnings, and the voice of tempests, and the voice of the waves of the sea 
heaving themselves beyond their bounds. 

"And all things shall be in commotion; and surely, men's hearts shall fail 
them; for fear shall come upon all people." 

Returning to the 133rd Section again I wish to read in conclu- 
sion of these quotations the 60th verse : 

"And for this cause these commandments were given; they were com- 
manded to be kept from the world in the day that they were given, but now 
are to go forth unto all flesh." 

RESPONSIBILITY OF THE CHURCH IN MISSIONARY WORK 

The remarks of our President in the opening session of this 
conference, and the interesting statistics which he read us con- 
cerning not only the affairs of the Church at home, but those in 
the mission field, awakened in my heart some thoughts and feelings 
concerning our missionary work and its responsibilities that I 
should like, if the Lord will help me, to express to you. I think 
that there is probably no responsibility greater than that which 
the Lord has placed upon this Church, as indicated in the words I 
have just quoted, to carry this gospel to all flesh. I believe that the 
record of the Church reveals the fact that we have looked upon it 
as one of our chief responsibilities. When the President was quot- 
ing the statistics and the amounts expended in the stakes of Zion 
and in the mission fields, I was impressed when he said that if we 
should compute the time of the missionaries and the means required 
to maintain them in the field that that item alone last year would 
have amounted to approximately two millions of dollars. And then 
in addition to that, the further statement of the amount which the 
Church itself has expended in the mission fields approaching an- 
other million dollars. No other single item in which the Church is 
actively engaged, therefore, has received such contributions of ser- 
vice and means. 

THE SPLENDID RECORD OF THE PAST 

We are certainly giving the greatest of our contributions to dis- 
charge this great, sacred and holy obligation which the Lord has 
placed upon this Church. I think as Ave look over the past we have 
some reason to feel grateful that the generations that have preceded 
us, with us have looked upon this responsibility as of deep import- 
ance, and there has not been wanting men, nor women, when they 



132 GENERAL CONEERENCE 

I 

have been called, to go into the world to discharge this great ob- 
ligation. We learned some few conferences ago from President A. 
W. Ivins that we had sent into the world approximately sixty thou- 
sand missionaries since this Church was organized. Figuring the 
expense of sending them and maintaining them there, with a very 
reasonable allowance for the value of their services, I would con- 
clude that in means and in service rendered, this Church has con- 
tributed upwards of one hundred millions of dollars in discharg- 
ing this great obligation to the world. It has not only cost the 
services of men, it has cost sacrifice on the part of many thousands 
of wives and mothers and fathers at home who have borne the extra 
burden. Many have suffered themselves to be denied the neces- 
sities of life, in order that they might maintain their sons in the 
mission field. And not only that, many of these precious sons 
have given their very lives to the great cause. We have held back 
nothing from this great call that the Lord has made upon us to 
carry these glad tidings to all men. 

THE LABORS AHEAD FOR THE FUTURE 

Splendid as our record has been in the past, I am concerned 
now about the future. I read in these words that this message 
must go to all flesh. We have not yet, with all our zeal, with all 
our earnestness and desire to do this work, reached all flesh. I am 
looking forward to the fulfilment of that commandment of the 
Lord on the part of the willing, faithful seventies and elders of 
this Church. 

While Russia, as referred to in this conference, has not yet re- 
ceived this message, and Russia is passing through the crucible, she 
will come out when she has paid the price, and find liberty and 
freedom. That is my faith, and when that day comes I hope and 
expect that we shall have sufficient men and women, if need be, 
to go into that great nation, that they, too, may hear the glad 
news, and I believe that countless thousands shall receive it. 

I am looking also to the great South American republics, where 
we have no servants of the Lord today. Only one brief visit has 
been made there in the history of the Church. Here, too, there 
are millions waiting the coming of this message. When the Lord 
is ready he shall inspire his servants to call for men to go and open 
up these fields. I am not worrying about the time when the call 
shall come. My only fear is that it shall come all too soon for 
many of us, who will not be prepared to respond. 

The great nation of China, is a heathen nation. I do not 
expect to see great numbers of people join the Church in such 
lands, but the obligation is upon us to carry the news to them, for it 
must go to all flesh, whether they receive it or not ; and whosoever 
shall receive it shall find the full salvation of God, through their 
obedience and repentance, but they must hear the glad news ; other- 
wise the Lord has not fulfilled his promise to the peoples of the 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD 



133 



world, and this obligation I say is yet resting upon the elders of 
this Church. 

MATURE MEN AS WELL AS THE YOUNG MUST PREPARE! 

I would not deny the splendid young men who are going into 
the missionary field today the right and the privilege to preach the 
gospel. They are principally boys in their teens, however. It is 
the greatest blessing that could come to them. I hope, however, 
that fathers and mothers shall not be looking upon the missionary 
field as a mere training- school for their boys. Natural]) 1 this is a 
by-product that comes from sending a boy upon a mission. He 
finds himself and finds the Lord. It is a miracle. The greatest 
miracle of "Mormonism" today is the miracle of the "Mormon" 
missionary. The marvelous transforation through which he goes 
under the influence of the Spirit of God, as he goes forward to 
preach this gospel. But what I am anxious for is that we shall 
have mingled and associated with these striplings, these youths, 
more of the mature men of the Church, you men who have hereto- 
fore preached the gospel. I know from my experience in the mis- 
sionary field that your help is needed and is of great value to the 
younger missionaries. Your wisdom, your courage, your judgment 
•will greatly increase the usefulness and efficiency of these 3'ounger 
men, and I would like to appeal to you, men, who have been upon 
missions years ago, and are still in good health, to begin to plan 
in the budget of the next few years to set aside a portion of time 
and some means which may be accumulated to provide you another 
opportunity to go into the world and help to discharge this great 
obligation. 

THE TIMES OF THE GENTILES 

President Ivins, yesterday morning, read to us some scriptures 
concerning the times of the Gentiles, that in the day when this 
gospel shall burst forth, and its light should be seen, it should be 
the beginning of the times of the Gentiles, and that that genera- 
tion that saw the light come forth should not pass away until the 
times of the Gentiles should be fulfilled. I do not know how many 
years that means, but I do know that there is a limited time, 
wherein we are given the opportunity to preach this gospel to the 
Gentile nations, and then cometh the day of the House of Israel. 
And it seems as if the day of the House of Israel — and President 
Ivins called our attention to it yesterday — is already dawning. 
Therefore we must be awake and about our Father's business, that 
we may stand acquitted before God and before men. I recognize 
that it is a day of settlement, a day of reckoning. The cry is, "This 
is the hour of God's judgment." I know the Lord does not wish 
to send judgments upon an unwarned and unprepared people. As 
it was in the days of Noah, so shall it be in the days of the coming 
of the Son of man. This is a day of warning. The ark was the 



134 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



means of salvation in those former days, it shall be the gospel of the 
Lord Jesus Christ in these latter-days. God has never let his peo- 
ple go into wickedness, sin and transgression, and into peril, with- 
out warning them, and in connection with the warning there has 
always been the means of escape. 

THE GREAT OBJECT IN SENDING MISSIONARIES 

There are two great objects we have in mind in sending these 
missionaries out into the world. There has been scattered, as 
President Ivins indicated in the scriptures and the prophecies 
which he read, among the Gentile nations the blood of Israel, and 
they are to be gathered, one of a city and two of a family, a few 
here and a few there. They who receive and accept the gospel are 
the ones in that household who have the blood of Israel in the'ir 
veins. By some process which I may not understand, nevertheless, 
it is true, we are to find them. There are many of them yet that 
we have not found, our own kindred, our own brothers and sisters 
in our own blessed household. We are anxious to find them. We 
will discover them in the isles of the sea, in the Old World and 
in the New World. Many of them are here, for the Lord is calling 
many of these sons of Israel to the American continent, though 
they know not why ; but he is bringing them to the rising of the 
brightness of Zion's glory, where they have an opportunity to find 
the truth, such as they do not have elsewhere. I was impressed 
with that when I listened to the statistics the President read, that 
one-half of the missionaries of this Church are in America, where 
but one-seventh of the people of the world are, and yet here is 
where the greater number of our baptisms are being performed. 
The Lord is bringing from the islands of the sea and from the 
continents of the Old World men and women to this country where 
they may have better opportunity to hear the truth and embrace 
it, and then they will be where the Lord wants them. Neverthe- 
less we are to search diligently and then we are to warn them that 
all men may be left without an excuse, and that we may be under 
no obligation. It isn't the obligation entirely of the man who hap- 
pens to have a son, however, it is an obligation resting upon every 
man and every woman in this Church, and we apportion the mis- 
sionary calls out among the wards and stakes of Zion, so many 
per thousand. 

DUTY OF QUORUMS AND WARDS IN MISSION WORK 

It is the duty and obligation, therefore, of each ward not only 
to see that its quota is filled and these missionaries are sent into 
the field, but that they are kept there, and if the finances of the 
father who happens to have a son in the mission fails him, it ought 
to be a matter of reproach to a ward that would allow their repre- 
sentative to come home merely because the father of that boy can- 



ELDER MELV1N J. BALLARD 



135 



not furnish the means. There must be a spirit of co-operation, 
on the part of the men and women of this Church to discharge 
this obligation the Lord has placed upon us. I have often thought 
of some of our professional brethren. I recognize from my expe- 
rience in the missionary field that these young men that we send 
out are not always able to deliver the message to certain groups — 
the educated classes. They feel abashed and ashamed. Like at- 
tracts like, and they naturally go to their own kind, where truly 
we have found the bulk of the members of this Church. Neverthe- 
less, our obligation is to teach this truth to kings, to presidents, sen- 
ators, governors, bankers, teachers, lawyers, and to men and women 
in the professional world. And many of these young men feel 
wholly unqualified. I have felt many times not justified in saying 
that we had fairly and fully warned men when we have done our 
best, because our best was not a good presentation always. 

THE USE OF SHORT-TERM MISSIONS 

Since this Church has offered men the privilege of going on 
short-term missions to preach the gospel, I would like to see 
some of our brethren who could not go for a long period of time 
prepare themselves to go for a shorter period. It is the best vaca- 
tion in the world that you could take, to go into the mission field 
for six months and preach this gospel. You would come back 
physically strong, mentally alert and spiritually recharged, and it 
would be the greatest blessing that could come to you. I would 
like to see more of it. 

THE JUDGMENTS OF GOD 

I do not want to see the judgments of God come upon men, 
and yet after the testimony, as I have just read, of his servants, 
shall come the testimony of thundering and of lightning and of 
earthquakes and peril and disaster. I was impressed two weeks 
ago as I read the dreadful story of the cyclone that swept through 
the southern part of the states of Illinois and Indiana, with these 
words that I have just read. Particularly was I impressed with it 
because the city of Murphysboro, in Southern Illinois, where 
one-half of the city was destroyed, and more than two hundred of 
our Father's children lost their lives, happens to be the very identi- 
cal city where I preached my first gospel sermon twenty-eight 
years ago. I had the privilege of tramping over that entire belt 
of country, where this great disaster swept the land, for over two 
years without purse and without scrip, preaching this gospel, warn- 
ing men. A few obeyed, but the majority turned a deaf ear. 

A LOVE FOR THE SOULS OF MEN 

Do I rejoice to see days of sorrow like those which befell the 
peoples of this land? No, I feel like weeping, I feel like the Master 
did as he wept upon the Mount of Olives over Jerusalem that had 



136 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



rejected him. No man can spend, as you men have done, years of 
your life in the missionary field — 1 was privileged to labor thirteen 
years, — and carry this gospel message to the children of men with- 
out a love for mankind. I have preached this gospel in sunshine, 
in dust, through the mud, I have wandered in the cold of winter, 
as well as the heat of summer, and have sought men. No man can 
do that who does not have in his heart a love for the souls of men. 
I love them. I would stay these dreadful days, but I cannot. All 
can do is to warn them, that they may repent and find the sal- 
vation which we offer them. The wedding is prepared. We are 
bearers of the invitation calling men to come to the wedding feast. 
Let us not be slack in continuing to give ourselves freely, as our 
fathers have done, not only to send our sons, but give ourselves, 
and discharge this great obligation, which yet rests upon this 
Church. For I bear witness to you that fast and swift moving 
events are happening and transpiring, and unless we shall be alert 
and awake we shall be behind in the Lord's great program. God 
help us to be fully up to all his expectations of us, and find our- 
selves fully justified in the efforts that we put forth, though men 
may reject us, in seeking to bring men unto Christ, is my prayer, 
and I ask it in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. , 

ELDER HYRUM G. SMITH 

Patriarch of the Church 

It is indeed a wonderful and glorious opportunity to bear the 
holy Priesthood which has been restored to the earth, and to be a 
servant of the Lord, to be a bearer of the message of life and salvation. 
In the brief service which I have been able to render, in the name of 
/the Lord, I have Jearned that he is very kind and merciful to 
his children, that he has placed in the Church, officers to take 
care of every department and phase of his work. In his great 
Sermon on the Mount the Lord himself comforted the hearts of those 
in the different walks of life, for he realized that there were men and 
women in the world who needed comfort and guidance and consolation. 

I desire to express my appreciation of the strength the Lord 
has given to me in his service while officiating for him in 
further comforting his children in the different walks of life. 
Day after day, week after week, month after month, individuals, mem- 
bers of the Church from the different walks of life, have been 
strengthened and encouraged and comforted through a humble ministry 
which the Lord has placed in the Church. I regret, however, to ex- 
press the thought that while many seek advice and council and comfort, 
they do not always follow it. We are very much like other people— 
we are mortal, we have our weaknesses, and our faults. We are like 
a good many people in the world, we know much better than we do. 
We believe in the gospel, but we do not practice it quite as well as we 



ELDER HYRUM G. SMITH 



137 



believe it. There are many people in the world who believe the gospel, 
but they are afraid of the water, or something else ; and there are many 
people who believe in the religion of the Latter-day Saints who are 
afraid to so express themselves. There are good men and wmen in 
the world who believe and obey the gospel and receive its comforting 
and consoling blessings. The Lord inspired the Prophet Joseph Smith 
to declare these words. 

"There is a law, irrevocably decreed in the heaven before the 
foundations of this world, upon which all blessings are predicated— And 
when we_ obtain any blessing from God, it is by obedience to that law 
upon which it is predicated." 

Therefore, we must learn the law upon which our blessings are 
predicated and when we render obedience to that law, our blessings 
will be forthcoming. 

In conversation with one of our good sisters who had raised a 
large family, and had made many sacrifices, for she was the mother of 
eleven children, I learned that she had never been to the House of 
the Lord, and so I persuaded her, or attempted to persuade her, 'to 
go and encourage her husband to go with her and receive these im- 
portant blessings. She advised me that she thought she had already 
clone all that was necessary. She had reared her family, and through 
her faithful labors and sacrifices she had fulfilled what she thought 
was a good mission, and now she wanted to have some blessings of 
her own. But I tried to teach her, and did teach her, that her sacrifices 
and all of her many blessings that she hand enjoyed in the past would 
coire to an end at her death, unless she went and had her blessings 
sealed upon her by the authorized servants of the Lord, at a place 
which the Lord has prepared, and that we call his house. I encouraged 
her to do the right thing that her blessings might be received, and her 
comfort come in due time ; for the Lord has declared that unless we 
obey his law, which is his word, all vows and contracts have an end 
at death. Therefore, if this good woman does not seal her vows and 
contracts, of course, in company with her companion, according to 
the law of the Lord, which is his word, the blessings which she craves 
will in time come to an end, and she will not have a claim upon those 
blessings which her heart desires. Therefore the law which the Lord 
has established for the comfort, salvation and union of homes, with 
mothers and fathers and children must be complied with before we can 
receive these eternal blessings. 

I have heard a good many people say : "Well, what is the use 
of having blessings pronounced? We get our blessings any way. if we 
live for them." That is very true, because we must live for our 
blessings if we get them, but there comes great comfort and consolation 
from having our blessings both pronounced and sealed upon us by 
authorized servants of the Lord in obedience to his word and his law. 
For the Lord has placed in his Church authorized agents to bear his 
power and his authority not only to pronounce, but to seal these bless-

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



ings, that the Lord may have an anchor upon the souls of men and 
women forever, for neither death nor the destroyer will end these 
precious blessings, but the receiver will posses and enjoy them forever 
and ever. 

And so I appreciate the privilege that has come to me as an humble 
servant of the Lord officiating in his name, not only encouraging, 
persuading and urging my brethren and sisters, my fellowmen to come 
unto Christ, and to serve the Lord and to keep his commandments, but 
to receive blessings, privileges and opportunities that will never come 
to an end, because they are of an eternal character and rendered in 
obedience to the word and law of the Lord. They will belong to 
them forever, just the same as the children of this good mother I re- 
ferred to, will belong to their parents, provided they go to the house 
of the Lord together with those children and are sealed at the altar of the 
Lord forever, thne death will not separate them, nor will any other 
power, except the power of sin and transgression ; for the Lord has 
declared that his blessings will come when we obey the laws upon which 
they are predicated. Only today have I ministered in this important 
calling for the comfort and blessing of those who are distressed in 
spirit ; many seek blessings for comfort because they have been wayward 
and indifferent, many because they have not lived up to their privileges 
in keeping the commandments of the Lord. I regret to say that too 
many of us fail to call upon the Lord or his servants until we are in 
distress, as the song which has been sung has reminded us that we 
call upon the Lord in our distress. How much more pleased the Lord 
would be if we would go to him in our gratitude, when we are 
showered with blessings, in our health and in our vigor and in our 
usefulness, rather than go in distress and sorrow, at the eleventh hour 
of our distress, perhaps! 

And so I would like to bear my testimony, my brethren and sisters, 
to the kindness and mercy of the Lord to his children, to the members 
of his Church, those who have come into his fold. I know that the 
Lord does comfort those who seek him, in faith and in true devotion, 
and that the blessings will come to those who render obedience to the 
commandments and the laws upon which their blessings are predicated. 
I have witnessed the joy and the great comfort and satisfaction that 
have come to the hearts of fathers and mothers when they have re- 
ceived their blessings in the house of the Lord. I have also heard many 
testimonies of my brethren and sisters who have declared in their 
humility and in their faith that the Lord has heard their prayers, that 
he has fulfilled the promises pronounced upon their heads through the 
servants of the Lord, because they have rendered obedience to the 
laws which govern their blessings. 

Now my brethren and sisters, I exhort you to look upon the gospel 
in all of its phases in a practical sense ; learn the laws upon which your 
blessings are perdicated, for they are simple enough and will be made 
clear to your understanding if you seek to know them. Let me exhort 



Elder hyrum g. smith 



-139 



you also to hold yourselves in keeping with the commandments of the 
Lord, concerning the laws of health known to us as the Word of 
Wisdom. I should like to refer you, both old and young, to the many 
examples that are written in the old scriptures as well as to the lives of 
those who are before you today in the ministry as general and local 
authorities of the Church, these men who are here before me today, 
the bearers of the Priesthood, the standard bearers in the stakes 
and wards of the Church, men who are free from the contaminating 
influences of the world, from habits that would prevent the reception 
of the precious blessings of God, men whom we believe and know 
to be clean and upright in their habits through observing the teachings 
of the gospel, and the laws of God which bring to them the joy, the 
comfort and the satisfaction of knowing that they are keeping his 
commandments and receiving his blessings. 

Among the examples recorded in ancient times I should like to 
refer you to the example given us by that Hebrew character who was 
taken from his home in Jerusalem with three other Hebrew boys at 
the time of the destruction of the temple and the capture of Jerusalem 
under the Babylonian chief. Daniel was taken to Babylon as a captive 
with the intention on the part of the great chief to feed and care for 
him well that he might grow up and become a wonderful and worthy 
servant, coming from the best and choicest of all the Hebrew families, 
but the boy refused the food that was offered him, because he had 
learned that it would defile his body and make it unfit for the blessings 
of the Lord. And so if you will read the story of his life to the very 
end, you will see a complete fulfilment of the promise of the Lord that 
is made to you and to me and to all Israel who will obey the com- 
mandments of the Lord concerning the Word of Wisdom ; for Daniel 
was able to find hidden treasures of knowledge, and he was able to 
pass by the destroying angels ; for when he was placed in the lions' den 
and the king watched during the night and at the dawn of the morning 
shouted out to Daniel to know if he was still alive, and Daniel answered 
back: 

"O king, live for ever. 

"My God hath sent his angel, and hath shut the lions' mouths, that 
they have not hurt me." 

I pray God to bless you, my brethren and sisters, bless all the 
officers and members of the Church, in all the stakes and wards of 
Zion, and in the mission fields, and in all the places and capacities 
which the Lord has placed his work, that his name and work may be 
honored and glorified, that his children may receive his blessings 
through learning and obeying the laws upon which the blessings of the 
Lord are predicated, both spiritual and temporal. 

God bless you my brethren and sisters, throughout all the Church, 
and throughout all the land, that his peace may be in your homes, in 
your dwelling places and his blessings be upon your fields and 
flocks, that you may not forget the Lord, for he will not forget

you, so lung as you are true and faithful in keeping and observing his 
commandmnets, and I bless you my brethren and sisters, by the 
authority which the Lord has given me to bless all Israel, that peace 
and health and happiness may be in your homes, until your mortal 
missions are finished, and I do it humbly, in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen.

ELDER JOSEPH W. McMURRIN 

Of the Council of Seventy, and President of the 
Calif orma Miss-ion 

I do not suppose, my brethren and sisters, that anyone in attendance 
at this general conference of the Church has had as trying an experience 
as I have had during these meetings. 

The President, in calling upon the brethren to address the con- 
ference, has gone from stand to stand. I know the brethren that 
occupy the stand that I have the honor to sit in, have felt several 
times that they were about to be called upon to speak, only to discover 
that they were mistaken. My companions for the past three days 
have been taken from either side of me as they in turn have been 
called to speak, and now at the last moment I am to have the pleasure 
after speaking for a brief time of sitting without any further anxiety 
for a few minutes during the closing moments of this general con- 
ference. It does create in the minds of men who are called upon to 
address these great assemblies a very great feeling of anxiety. Presi- 
dent Charles W. Penrose upon one occasion made a remark of that 
character and heaved a sigh of relief when he came into one of the 
stake conferences, here in the city, and expressed to me personally 
the pleasure he felt when he thought that he would be under no responsi- 
bility to address the people. There were other brethren who had 
been especially appointed to attend that stake conference and the 
responsibility of speaking would be upon them. I have heard President 
George O. Cannon in his life time more than once make a similar 
declaration. You are all acquainted with the fact that it is quite a 
common thing for these brethren who belong to the presiding authorities 
of the Church to intimate when they stand up before the people that 
they have a feeling of anxiety, and desire the help and the assistance 
that can be given by the congregation through their faith and their 
prayers. 

I am very happy, my brethren and sisters, notwithstanding the 
rather trying experience that I have had during the conference, to 
say that my spirit is in harmony with the teachings that have been 
presented during these meetings. I respond in my soul to the testi- 
mony and teachings and information imparted by President Heber J. 
Grant in the opening meeting, and as I have listened to the brethren 
who have been called upon to speak to the people I have felt in

my whole being that I could say Amen with all my heart to the 
counsels and testimonies that have been delivered. 

I have the pleasure, my brethren and sisters, of laboring as a 
missionary in California. The mission covers the state of California 
passed away considerable anxiety because 'of sickness. \ We have 
had in that mission during the year that has just passed an average 
of about one hundred and twenty-five missionaries. Of this number I 
believe at the close of last year, or at the opening of this year, there 
were about thirty-nine lady missionaries, and the balance of the force 
is made up of young men such as have been spoken of here during 
these conference meetings. I am happy to say that these men and 
women, speaking in a general sense, at the present time are in the 
enjoyment of good health. There are some minor troubles, but no 
serious illness. We have had, however, during the year that has 
passed away, considerable anxiety because of sickness. We have 
had both men and women who have submitted to surgical operations 
for appendicitis, and in one or two instances the cases were very 
serious, and the surgeons and nurses that waited upon them despaired 
of their lives. We are very thankful, however, that through the 
blessings and mercy of the Lord our God the lives of the missionaries 
who have been thus in danger have been spared, and they have been 
raised up to health and vigor and have been able to again take up the 
prosecution of the work resting upon them as ambassadors of the Lord 
Jesus Christ. 

I would like to say to bishops and stake presidents, that I fear 
at times there is not sufficient attention given to the physical condi- 
tion of men and women who are being called to labor as missionaries. 
I think possibly in some instances there is a wrong impression in the 
minds of some people regarding the nature of missionary work. I 
am quite satisfied that some times there is a feeling that an individual 
who is run down can be called into the mission field and there 
recuperate. Such a thought I am sure is a very great mistake. Mis- 
sionary work, when it is faithfully performed, is hard work, the 
strongest men, and the strongest women, who come into the California 
mission find in the performance of their missionary duties that they 
have all that their physical powers will enable them to do ; and it is 
a very great mistake to send into the mission field, either men or 
women, who are not possessed of good physical power, for they not 
only are unable themselves, as a general thing, after prosecuting their 
work for a brief season to continue that work, but they demand also 
attention of other missionaries in nursing them and this interferes 
with the service that the healthy missionary might render. I am 
very glad to have received the information since coming to attend 
this conference that more careful attention than ever before is being 
given to the health of missionaries to make as sure as possible that 
they are in .good physical condition before they go out to preach the 
gospel.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



The California mission is probably unlike any other mission. Some 
eighteen months ago, or such a period, the presiding authorities of the 
Church felt that it would be for the advantage of the work of the 
Lord to organize a stake of Zion in that mission. That is something 
that has not taken place heretofore in any mission field. In the city 
of Los Angeles, which is the most populous part of the California 
mission, a stake of Zion was organized. That stake, I am glad to 
say, has made very splendid advancement. It was organized with 
six wards and three branches, and it has grown now to have seventeen 
wards and twenty-two Sunday schools. I do not suppose that in any 
ether mission it can be said that there was received and recorded, during 
the year 1924, over thirty-six hundred Church members, who had 
come in from adjoining communities from the stakes and wards here 
in Utah and Idaho, and from Arizona and from other sections, but that 
is what took place in the California mission last year. Over thirty- 
six hundred members were recorded in the books of the stake of the mis- 
sion, who had come from other sections of the country. I do not suppose 
that thirty-six hundred Latter-day Saints actually came into Cali- 
fornia during the year. Possibly many of them had been in the 
state for a considerable period of time, some of them no doubt may 
have been there for some years, but they have only now been recorded 
as members of the Church on the records of the mission or on the 
records of the stake. 

There have also been a large number who have been transferred, 
probably thirteen hundred or fourteen hundred Church members have 
received their certificates of membership during the year, and have been 
transferred to other communities. This, of course, causes changes 
in officers. There have already been in the Los Angeles stake since 
its organization changes in four or five different bishoprics, and there 
have also been a number of changes in the high council. This is 
brought about by the fact that the Latter-day Saints who are in Cali- 
fornia as a general thing are not in the condition as home owners 
indicated by the report made by President Grant at the opening of this 
conference. They are not home-owners. There is but a very small 
percentage of the members of the Church in the California mission who 
own their own homes. They are wage-earners as a general thing. 
They are living, many of them, in rented apartments, in fact the 
great majority of them are in rented apartments, and many of them are 
living in furnished apartments, and it is an easy matter when one 
doesn't own a home if he hears that there is a little better prospect in 
some other section to pick up his grip and call for a drayman to 
take his trunk to the railroad station and go elsewhere. I am glad 
to say. however, notwithstanding the large number of people who 
have come to California who are Latter-day Saints, there has been work- 
as a general thing in the past for all of this great influx of people 
as well as for tens of thousands who have come from all parts of the 



ELDER JOSEPH W. McMURRIN 



143 



nation. At the present time, however, conditions are not as desirable 
as they have been, from a working point of view in the past. 

I would recommend that if there are any Latter-day Saints who 
have the thought in their minds of coming to California for the purpose 
of finding employment they be a little slow in putting such 
thought into execution. I think I can safely say that there are more 
men in California at the present time than there is work, and that there 
are many idle men in California. Rents are very high. California 
is a wonderful state, a beautiful country, a desirable place for habitation 
in many respects, but it is not a very desirable place for men and women 
to come to who do not have money in their pockets, and I would 
like to say that Latter-day Saints without money will be altogether 
better off, and they will be altogether safer, in these well-established 
communities where the people own their homes, than to migrate to 
California. 

We have the experience in the California mission of having our 
headquarters in the city of Los Angeles and that is also the head- 
quarters of the Los Angeles stake of Zion. We are performing 
missionary work just in the same manner that we conducted missionary 
work before the stake was organized. I think that our missionary 
service has been of very great value to the stake organization, for the 
local brethren who are tied up with their employment could not have 
gone out among the people and looked up these hosts of strangers 
and have established the organizations that have been established by the 
labor o>- the missionaries, and which has increased the organizations 
within the stakes from nine to twenty-two, as I have stated. 

There are at the present time about six thousand members in the 
Los Angeles stake of Zion. There are a little less than nine thou- 
sand members in the California mission outside of the Los Angeles 
stake of Zion, so that we have there some fifteen or sixteen thousand 
enrolled members of the Church within the California mission, when 
we include the membership of the Los, Angeles stake. There are 
thousands possibly in the state that are still unknown to us. We also 
have gone out into the Maricopa stake by the expressed desire of the 
bishopric of the Phoenix ward and the presidency of the Maricopa stake, 
and have performed some very effective missionary work in the city 
of Phoenix. Phoenix is the capital of the state of Arizona. I am 
glad to say that I recently heard from the lips of Bishop Price the 
very highest words of praise and commendation for the splendid ser- 
vices that were being rendered in the city of Phoenix, by California 
missionaries who through their labors are strengthening the hands 
of the bishopric, and drawing many strangers into the meetings. Hr 
reported to me that they had more strangers coming to their meetings 
since the last missionaries were sent into that city than had ever been 
in the habit of attending their meetings before. 

We have also gone out during the same period into the northern 
part of the state, and at times have labored to some extent in com- 



144

munities that form part of the Snowflake stake of Zion, but we have 
only gone there by the invitation and with the full permission of the 
authorities who preside over that stake. These things, I take it, are a 
little different to conditions that prevail elsewhere in the missions 
here in the United States or in other sections. 

I am proud to be a missionary, my brethren and sisters. I am 
proud of my companionship. The young men and the young women 
who make up the missionary corps of the California mission, are not 
experienced men, they are not experienced women. They come into the 
mission with a very great degree of anxiety. They come ofttimes 
wondering whether they have any right or authority to speak in the 
name of the Lord Jesus Christ, whether they have authority to ad- 
minister the sacred and holy ordinances of the gospel, but thanks be 
to God through faithful labor almost without a solitary exception 
they have found God, they have learned that by keeping the com- 
mandments of God, our heavenly Father is not very far from any 
one of us. They have received manifestations of the Spirit of God, 
they have laid their hands upon those who have been seriously af- 
flicted and the Lord our God has heard their humble prayers, and by 
his mysterious power he has healed those who have been afflicted. 
He has poured into their souls understanding in relation to the doc- 
trines of the gospel, until they have soon come to be able to stand 
upon their feet and bear witness of the truth as it has been revealed 
in the dispensation in which we live. And they are not doubting, they 
are full of conviction, they are full of understanding, they are full of 
determination, they are full of humility, they are full of willingness and 
ready to go and come and anxious to labor to the very best of their 
power that the message of the gospel may be preached among the 
people. We are trying to impress upon the minds of men and women 
with whom we come in contact that there has indeed been this rev- 
elation of the gospel that has been spoken of so frequently during 
our conference meetings, that in our own time the heavens have been 
opened, that the Lord our God has made his appearance, with his Son, 
our Redeemer, and that by the sending of holy angels he has con- 
ferred authority upon men to call people to repentance and that the mis- 
sionaries speak legally in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. The mis- 
sionaries believe that they have that authority, and in the fear of God 
they are going among the people, calling men and women to repentance, 
expounding to them the principles that have been revealed, ready and 
willing and anxious to administer to them the holy ordinances of the 
gospel, if people will believe and repent. I am glad to be one with 
them. 

My soul is filled with joy and thanksgiving and praise. The 
hands of the servant of God who presides over this Church were laid 
upon my head before I went to California, and blessings were pro- 
nounced upon my head that it seemed to me when I commenced my 
ministry in the midst of that people never could have fulfilment, yet 



ELDER JOSEPH W. McMURRIN

I stand here before this great congregation this afternoon and bear 
witness that in the mercy and providence, and through the power of God, 
he has fulfilled marvelously the promises that have been placed upon 
my head, and I feel that I am under obligation to give my service 
to my Father in heaven for the building up and advancement of his 
work. 

God gave me my life in the days of my young manhood, and 
raised me up from a deathbed by his power, and I have covenanted 
with my Father in heaven upon many occasions that I would try to 
manifest appreciation for the marvelous power that was manifest 
in my own behalf when he raised me from that condition of 
death. I know that Jesus Christ is the Son of the living God. I know 
that this Church is in very deed the Church of Jesus Christ. I know 
that the power and authority of the Priesthood has been conferred upon 
men, and that by that authority men minister and expound and preach 
the gospel of the Redeemer of the world. Jesus Christ himself taught 
that it was in vain to teach for doctrine the commandments of men — 
"In vain do ye worship me, teaching for doctrine the commandment* 
of men." That is just as true today as it was when those words fell 
from the lips of the Lord Jesus Christ, and we are not teaching the 
commandments of men, we are teaching the doctrines that have been 
revealed by the Lord, and we are under obligation to teach and maintain 
the truth. God help us to do it, I humbly pray, in the name of 
Jesus Christ. Amen. 



ELDER LAWRENCE G. KIRKMAN 

President of the Tzvin Falls Stake of Zion 

This is a new experience for me. I am rather young in my office 
and rather young in the preaching of the gospel of Jesus Christ, and 
yet in humility I appreciate this wonderful privilege. It seems to me 
that the Latter-day Saints have experienced a multitude of sensations 
during this conference. It seems to me that never in my life have I had 
so many thrilling sensations during meetings of a conference as I have 
had during the last two or three days. 

We live in sunny southern Idaho, an altitude a little lower than this, 
and a wonderful climate of about sixteen or seventeen hours of sunshine. 
In the summer time the sun rises at about 5 :00 o'clock in the morning 
and at the longest day we have a most glorious sunset at about 8 :20 
in the evening. Perhaps that would be strange to you people in the 
mountains, but where we live there is scarcely a mountain either east 
or west of us, but some small mountains south and north; therefore 
the sun comes almost at is does in the east, from the ground, and 
sets in the ground in the west in the evening. We have been blessed 
wonderfully, it seems to me, in this splendid country, with the most 
wonderful soil, I think, in the United States, the most productive land 



146 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



I have ever seen, and it is undoubtely a selection of the best people 
from all over the United States, progressive men who have been willing 
to pioneer, leave their homes and their business and risk their fortunes 
in a new country. Such people seem to comprise the personnel of this 
country, and I have had a great deal of pleasure in explaining the 
gospel of Jesus Christ to a number of these broad-minded, sensible 
men. There is not the prejudice there that you would expect in a 
country of this kind. I believe we are treated almost as generously as 
any other church in that locality. 

About eighteen years ago when we moved to Idaho, if you will 
pardon the personal reference, we had a membership of about two 
hundred people in the city of Twin Falls. Today we have two thriving 
wards, one with a Sunday school of two hundred twenty-five to two 
hundred and fifty members, and another Sunday school with about one 
hundred sixty or one hundred seventy-five members. A number of good 
Latter-day Saints have gathered in that locality and are making their 
homes there, and with the best prospects, and I feel that the Latter- 
day Saints have been fortunate indeed to cast their lot there. The gospel 
of Jesus Christ, it seems to me, is dearer to the people there than in 
other communities where I have lived. I can safely say there is not 
a member of the stake presidency, high council or any other stake 
officer who does not observe the Word of Wisdom. There perhaps are 
two or three stake members who do not pay a full tithing. I say 
this very humbly without the least degree of boasting, because I feel 
that the atmosphere in which we live is rather conducive to that con- 
dition, that we are forced to live the gospel of Jesus Christ because of 
the demand made of us by our neighbors, and it is a good thing, and the 
missionary element which President McMurrin has just mentioned is 
very noticeable there. 

I wish the President would see fit to send missionaries into that 
country — the greatest missionary field in the world. I have traveled 
many days and many nights, sometimes for weeks, without an op- 
portunity of preaching the gospel to a single soul during my missionary 
labors, but in Twin Falls every day we could have hundreds of op- 
portunities. Men are commencing to inquire about the gospel ; they are 
reading the Book of Mormon. We are giving out a great number of 
tracts, and I wish we could have ten or fifteen missionaries constantly 
to help us in that splendid field. , 

I pray for the success of the Church of Jesus Christ. I pray that 
the gospel may spread and that the honest in heart may gather out, 
that they may have this thrill that you people have been experiencing 
during the last two or three days. That sensation is not known to the 
person outside of the Church. He may seek other thrills and other 
experiences that are sometimes unwholesome. God bless us that we may 
cultivate and enjoy these pleasing, happy, stimulating thrills that will 
make men and women better, I humbly pray, in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen.

ELDER HARRY L. PAYNE 

President of the St. Joseph Stake of Zion 

My beloved brethren and sisters, I assure you it is with a feeling 
of timidity that I stand before this vast audience today, and I humbly 
pray that the few words I may utter may be guided and directed by the 
Spirit of the Lord. I rejoice in the opportunity that I have of being 
a humble servant in the work of the Lord. I am indeed grateful for 
the testimony which I have of the divinity of this work in which we are 
all engaged. My heart has been touched, and I have been thrilled, 
during the services of this conference in listening to the wonderful 
testimonies of our brethren, in listening to the words of inspiration which 
have been given to us through the power and blessings of the Lord, 
and his warning, advice, and admonition to this people. 

Reference has been made by many of the brethren to the fact that 
as a people we stand upon our individual testimony. I want to say, 
my brethren and sisters, also that with this individual testimony there 
comes an individual responsibility to every one who has named the 
name of Christ. No one else in all the world can save me but myself. 
No one can work your salvation except yourself. It is after all an 
individual work, and we have embarked in the service of the Lord, 
and we have made covenants with the Lord that we would keep his 
commandments and do his will. The Master while here on the earth 
said : "I must do the works of him that sent me, while it is day, for the 
night cometh when no man can work." My brethren and sisters, the 
responsibility of doing this individual work is upon us today, not at 
some far distant time, and I am wondering, and have wondered, dur- 
ing the services of this conference, how many of us are going home 
and reduce to practice the admonitions and instructions that have been 
given us from the servants of the Lord. After all we have each and 
every one an individual work to perform. I think it was Emerson who 
said : "No man is born into this world whose work is not born with 
him." No one is born into the work of God whose work is not bor*n 
with him. 

"There is surely somewhere a lowly place, 

In regions of a field so wide, 
Where I may labor through life's short day, 
For Jesus the crucified." 

Surely my brethren and sisters, in the work of God there is a 
place, there is opportunity for every one of us to do that work which 
God and Jesus Christ, our Redeemer, our Master and Captain, expects 
us to do. I am reminded of the words of the poet who said : 

"Out of the night that covers me, 

Black as the pit from pole to pole, 
I thank whatever gods may be, 

For my unconquerable soul.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



In the fell clutch of circumstance, 

I have not winced nor cried aloud, 
Under the bludgeonings of chance, 

My head is bloody, but unbowed. 
It matters not how strait the gate, 

How charged with punishments the scroll, 
I am the master of my fate : 

I am the captain of my soul." 

God help us, my brethren and sisters, to realize the responsibilities 
resting - upon us individually. May we be able to carry to our wards 
and stakes the words as they have been given to us from the servants 
of the Lord, and inspire anew a determination upon the part of our 
brethren and sisters who have not been favored to be here, to be 
more faithful in the future than they have hitherto beeta in the work 
of the Lord, for I bear you my testimony in humility, in fear and in 
trembling that I know as I know that I live that this is God's work. I 
know that Jesus is the Christ, I know that Joseph Smith was and is in 
very deed a prophet of the living God, and I know that Heber J. 
Grant who stands at the head of the Church today is God's mouth- 
piece and prophet. May God help us to realize the responsibilities rest- 
ing upon us, and to discharge them faithfully and well, I pray, in the 
name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER JAMES B. LARSEN 

President of the Shelley Stake of Zion 

My brethren and sisters, when I came into the meeting this after- 
noon I met a lady on the grounds with whom I lived when I attended 
school at Snow Academy, and, of course, I was very grateful and happy 
to see her, and she said to me : "I suppose when you were living with 
me you did not think that some day you would be a president of a 
stake," and I can assure you that I did not think, and had not thought, 
at that time, that I would ever occupy this position. But I can truth- 
fully say that I am grateful that I have been called to this position, and 
I hope that I will be able to give real service in this work. 

I have a testimony of the truthfulness of this gospel. I know 
that the Lord hears and answers our prayers. This testimony came to 
me while I was at that school, the Snow Academy, down at Ephraim, 
Sanpete county. I remember, on a certain occasion, that I wanted very 
much for the Lord to hear my prayers, and he did hear them, and 
all night long, or nearly so, I poured out my soul to him. Finally I 
went to sleep, and in the morning I awoke with an assurance that has 
never left me througout all the years that have passed since that time. 
I knew somehome that the Lord had heard my prayer, and that my 
prayer was answered, and it has been answered and fulfilled to the 
letter. Everything that I asked for in that prayer lias been brought 
about, and I knew that morning, when I awoke after having slept just

a very little while, that it would be just as I am telling you that it 
has been. 

I rejoice in being privileged to be in attendance at this conference. 
Like the other brethren who have spoken, I have been thrilled. My 
eyes have been filled with tears many times during this conference, and 
the Spirit of the Lord has borne testimony to me, every fiber of my 
body has responded and said Amen, and what has been said is true. I 
add my testimony, my brethren and sisters, to those which have been 
borne already, that this is the Church of Christ, that this is the work 
of the Lord that we are engaged in, and I am grateful with you to be 
privileged to be of service in this great and glorious cause. I know that 
the Lord can bless us, I know that he can make us equal to whatever 
call is made of us, and if we will only humble ourselves, if we will only 
put ourselves in condition the Lord will bless us and make us equal to 
these responsibilities and duties and calls that come to us, and they are 
blessings to us. , 

I am grateful to have the privilege of working with our people. 
We have a wonderful people, in our section of the country, and my 
testimony is strengthened in everything I do, and the more I do, and the 
more I serve, in this Church, the greater becomes my testimony of the 
divinity of this work. 

I leave my testimony with you that this is the Church of Christ, 
that we are engaged in the service of the Master, and I only hope 
that I may remain steadfast. I know that the Church can go on 
without me, and I do know that I cannot go on without the Church ; so 
I hope and pray that I may be able to continue steadfast to the end, 
because I know that this is the work of God. May God bless us and 
help us that we may be able to remain faithful to the end, I pray, in the 
name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

CLOSING REMARKS 



I desire to express my gratitude and thanksgiving to the Lord for 
the rich outpouring of his spirit during our conference. It seems to 
me that we have never had as large an attendance at any other con- 
ference within my recollection as we have had during this conference. 
I feel that all those who have spoken here have been blessed of our 
heavenly Father. As nearly as I can judge, the people have been 
deeply interested in what has been said to them and their hearts have 
responded to the teachings of those who have addressed them during the 
conference. I regret that we did not have at least another hour, so 
that I could have announced that during my presidency every stake 
president has had the privilege of speaking or of uttering a prayer 
from this stand. As it is, I believe all our 94 stake presidents have 
had that privilege with the exception of those chosen last year — not more 
than half a dozen. 



I know of nothing that I have enjoyed more in our conference 
than the brief testimonies of the men who stand at the head of the 
various stakes of Zion. There was a burning power in those testi- 
monies of their individual knowledge regarding the divinity of this 
work. It is that personal knowledge, that still, small voice of rev- 
elation coming to every honest, prayerful soul, in answer to prayer, 
which gives the power to this Church. Without this individual testi- 
mony, coming as it does to men and women all over the world when 
they hear this gospel and supplicate God for his spirit, we would not 
be what we are today — a united people, one in heart and soul, one with 
God and one with our Savior. 

That God our heavenly Father may help us to be loyal and true to 
him and that we may ever show by our faithfulness, by our honesty to 
men and women, and by the uprightness of our lives that we are in 
very deed the servants and handmaidens of the living God, striving for 
the spread of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, is my earnest prayer. 



I leave my blessing with the people who have assembled in this 
conference, and with all Israel, as well as the honest the world over. I

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



pray God from the bottom of my heart to bless the president of the 
United States of America, to bless his cabinet, to bless the senators, to 
bless the representatives, to bless those who stand at the head of all the 
states of our great country, that they may supplicate their God and their 
Redeemer for guidance, so that this country may in very deed be under 
the guidance of the Creator of the universe. This is my prayer, and I 
ask it in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The 'choir and congregation sang, "Guide us, O thou great 
Jehovah." 

Benediction was pronounced by Elder William H. Gallahan presi- 
dent of the Wayne stake of Zion, and the conference adjourned for six 
months. 



President Anthony C. Lund conducted the singing, assisted by B. 
Cecil Gates. Professor John J. McCiefiati played the accompaniment-, 
interludes, etc., on „the great organ, assisted by Edward P. Kimball, 
Tracy Y. Cannon, Alexander Shreiner, and Frank W. Asper. 

Stenographic reports of the discourses were made in the Tabernacle 
by Franklin W. Otterstrom, assisted by Joseph Anderson ; and in the 
Assembly Hall by Frederick G. Barker.
